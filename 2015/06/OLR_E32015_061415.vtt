Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki!

00:14.000 --> 00:17.360
Although tomorrow is officially day zero, the E3 keynotes begin tonight with Bethesda's

00:17.360 --> 00:20.600
announcements, some of which may have already been revealed during a live streamed rehearsal.

00:20.600 --> 00:23.780
Join us for the keynote reaction, expectations, and all the week's news starting right now

00:23.780 --> 00:27.440
on the show, where every gamer has a voice!

00:27.440 --> 00:31.440
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.440 --> 00:34.600
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.600 --> 00:36.520
where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.520 --> 00:43.420
This is Orange Lounge Radio with a special mini E3 2015 episode for this June the 14th

00:43.420 --> 00:45.220
of 2015.

00:45.220 --> 00:50.040
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me in studio as she always does, say hello to DarkSakura

00:50.040 --> 00:51.040
or Jamie Summers.

00:51.040 --> 00:52.260
Except when I don't.

00:52.260 --> 00:54.220
Except when you don't, like last week.

00:54.220 --> 00:58.760
But I hear a lot of good things are going on at work for you.

00:58.760 --> 01:03.340
Good things and it's been such a combination of bad and good at the same time, that I'm

01:03.340 --> 01:05.580
sort of like, what?

01:05.580 --> 01:08.340
Well I hope you were feeling a lot of the love listeners were sending you last week,

01:08.340 --> 01:09.340
they missed you.

01:09.340 --> 01:11.700
Thank you everybody, I appreciate it.

01:11.700 --> 01:14.660
Also joining us in studio tonight, say hello to Tech Master Loki!

01:14.660 --> 01:15.660
Hi.

01:15.660 --> 01:19.180
Hi, and who actually had two milkshakes for dinner tonight, correct?

01:19.180 --> 01:27.740
Well, technically I had, you know, a garlic fries and a, was it a cheese, you know, sandwich.

01:27.740 --> 01:30.220
Okay, so you had a little bit before you brought the milkshakes to you.

01:30.220 --> 01:34.660
But then I had two milkshakes because, you know, I wanted a large milkshake from In-N-Out

01:34.660 --> 01:37.340
but they didn't have a large milkshake, they only have one size, so.

01:37.340 --> 01:39.420
I was like, I'll just get two.

01:39.420 --> 01:43.660
Which is a mistake because those milkshakes are extremely heavy.

01:43.660 --> 01:48.180
But I was determined, I paid money for them to finish both.

01:48.180 --> 01:52.220
I did, but it's just like, oh, that's a lot of food.

01:52.220 --> 01:56.500
Alright, well, tonight is a little bit different edition of Orange Launch Radio.

01:56.500 --> 01:59.980
Those of you on the podcast feed are probably going to realize, gosh, this week's OLR seems

01:59.980 --> 02:02.980
really short, especially for a big week as such as E3.

02:02.980 --> 02:05.860
Well here's what's going on guys, we're having to do a little bit of production on the fly

02:05.860 --> 02:10.380
tonight because we got bumped back a little bit by the Nintendo World Championships, which

02:10.380 --> 02:16.540
just wrapped up not even like two minutes ago, it's now 6.25 or so on the west coast,

02:16.540 --> 02:18.460
9.25 on the east coast.

02:18.460 --> 02:23.380
And this is not a pre-E3 show, we're in it, we're sitting in it.

02:23.380 --> 02:26.140
Announcements are starting to come out, we're going to talk about some of those in just

02:26.140 --> 02:27.140
a moment.

02:27.140 --> 02:30.860
Bethesda's press conference starts at seven, so we got a lot to get through tonight.

02:30.860 --> 02:35.180
But you know, not only did our show get bumped back a little bit by all the Nintendo World

02:35.180 --> 02:40.940
Championship stuff going on, but our good pal Bobby Blackwolf, he does a show every

02:40.940 --> 02:45.500
Sunday right before us on the network at five o'clock Pacific, eight o'clock Eastern, and

02:45.500 --> 02:49.780
that Nintendo World Championships tonight just ate up his show entirely, and I felt

02:49.780 --> 02:51.820
really bad for him.

02:51.820 --> 02:55.260
A lot of us really enjoy hearing from Bobby, and he's always good enough to have us on

02:55.260 --> 02:59.220
his show every single week, so I thought, you know what, let's bring him on to OLR tonight.

02:59.220 --> 03:01.020
Bobby, how you doing?

03:01.020 --> 03:04.140
Are you a squid, or are you a kid?

03:04.140 --> 03:09.420
I'm having an identity crisis, I think I might be both.

03:09.420 --> 03:11.940
Have you been playing any Splatoon at all, Bobby?

03:11.940 --> 03:12.940
You want to know what?

03:12.940 --> 03:15.540
I had not really seen it or played it until tonight.

03:15.540 --> 03:17.380
I see what all the fuss is about.

03:17.380 --> 03:18.980
I may be go getting it.

03:18.980 --> 03:19.980
It's a lot of fun.

03:19.980 --> 03:25.260
You know, for a first person shooter, the whole different mechanic where it's what's

03:25.260 --> 03:28.940
covered in paint that really makes the difference, just has this whole little different spin

03:28.940 --> 03:29.940
on it.

03:29.940 --> 03:30.940
It's actually a third person shooter.

03:30.940 --> 03:34.180
Yeah, it's not about the kills, you know what I mean, yeah, it really is a third person

03:34.180 --> 03:35.180
shooter.

03:35.180 --> 03:38.460
Anyway, I'm having a lot of fun with it.

03:38.460 --> 03:45.180
Some of the Amiibo on disc DLC, some of that kind of bugs me, and some of the online, so

03:45.180 --> 03:50.100
it's flawed, but it's still really strong, especially for an original IP title.

03:50.100 --> 03:54.020
Yeah, but no, the Nintendo World Championships, I watched the whole thing.

03:54.020 --> 03:55.380
I was in it in 1990.

03:55.380 --> 04:00.980
I was a semi-finalist in Atlanta, so I kind of have a personal connection to it, and so

04:00.980 --> 04:02.300
I watched the whole thing.

04:02.300 --> 04:07.740
Wow, the logistics and what they pulled off in three and a half hours, the pacing was

04:07.740 --> 04:08.740
amazing.

04:08.740 --> 04:11.620
It did not feel like a three and a half hour show.

04:11.620 --> 04:14.580
Evo could learn a thing or two.

04:14.580 --> 04:17.020
Are you irritated that you got bumped tonight, Bobby?

04:17.020 --> 04:18.780
No, you know, it's fine.

04:18.780 --> 04:23.660
What I'm going to probably most likely do is I may do my show for this week where I

04:23.660 --> 04:25.380
talk about the press conferences.

04:25.380 --> 04:31.000
I may do Tuesday night at 8 p.m. Eastern, 5 p.m. Pacific, leading into anime jam sessions,

04:31.000 --> 04:33.300
so you know when I would usually have you guys on?

04:33.300 --> 04:35.100
I'm going to have anime jam session on.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.100
Nice.

04:36.180 --> 04:39.740
So I'm still going to have a show, it's just going to be Tuesday after all the press conferences.

04:39.740 --> 04:42.100
It's all mixed up here at the Voice of the Geeks Network this week.

04:42.100 --> 04:43.100
It's crazy.

04:43.100 --> 04:45.340
So what do you think about the news, since we're talking a little bit about E3 and stuff,

04:45.340 --> 04:51.860
about Microsoft bumping a lot of their big titles to Gamescom because they have that

04:51.860 --> 04:56.180
great of a lineup that's like, you know, hey, I want to learn more about Crackdown, sorry,

04:56.180 --> 05:00.020
got to wait until Gamescom.

05:00.020 --> 05:03.020
They're going to do what they're going to do.

05:03.020 --> 05:06.020
Ask me after they show what they're going to show Monday morning.

05:06.020 --> 05:09.380
I don't know, I just think it's pretty awesome if they have that great of a lineup.

05:09.380 --> 05:10.380
Yeah.

05:10.380 --> 05:13.060
I hope that's the case.

05:13.060 --> 05:16.100
I was going to ask you about this, Bobby, too, since, you know, this wasn't technically

05:16.100 --> 05:20.600
an E3 press conference, but you know, anybody that knows your show on the network, you know,

05:20.600 --> 05:25.580
you are a really big connoisseur of VR and Oculus and all that.

05:25.580 --> 05:30.500
And Oculus had a lot to say this week, which did tie into the 360 a little bit, because

05:30.500 --> 05:36.180
the, excuse me, the Xbox One, because the Xbox One controller is going to be the official,

05:36.180 --> 05:43.460
I guess, controller of the Oculus Rift, leading some to wonder, could Microsoft be unveiling

05:43.460 --> 05:45.840
an even deeper partnership tomorrow?

05:45.840 --> 05:47.540
What are your thoughts on all that, Bobby?

05:47.540 --> 05:51.740
Well, and for one thing, that actually wasn't, it was the first E3 press conference.

05:51.740 --> 05:53.900
E3 called it the first E3 press conference.

05:53.900 --> 05:54.900
Oh, my bad.

05:54.900 --> 05:56.860
So that actually was.

05:56.860 --> 06:00.620
They are partnering, Oculus is partnering with Windows 10.

06:00.620 --> 06:04.020
They're just using the Xbox One controller, because right now, the de facto controller

06:04.020 --> 06:08.300
for the Oculus Rift games on PC is the Xbox 360 wired controller.

06:08.300 --> 06:09.700
That's what everybody uses.

06:09.700 --> 06:12.260
So they're going to bundle in the Xbox One controller.

06:12.260 --> 06:16.540
They are doing, a lot of people think that the Oculus Rift is going to go on the Xbox

06:16.540 --> 06:17.540
One.

06:17.540 --> 06:18.540
It's not.

06:18.540 --> 06:20.500
The Xbox One can't handle it.

06:20.500 --> 06:21.660
Neither can the PS4.

06:21.660 --> 06:26.060
That's why there's a breakout box with the Morpheus that has an extra GPU and CPU.

06:26.060 --> 06:31.300
But they're doing the game streaming to Windows 10, so what they're doing with the Xbox One

06:31.300 --> 06:37.260
is you can game stream your Xbox One games in 2D into a 3D theater.

06:37.260 --> 06:39.540
And that's the partnership between Xbox and Oculus.

06:39.540 --> 06:44.140
But it's more Windows 10 and Oculus, which is why the Oculus Rift, when it comes out,

06:44.140 --> 06:47.540
is only going to run on Windows, and I didn't say Windows 10.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.900
It may still run on Windows 7 and 8 and stuff.

06:49.900 --> 06:54.180
But not on Mac OS X, not on Linux, not at launch.

06:54.180 --> 06:55.180
Not at launch.

06:55.580 --> 06:58.820
Very interesting too, because you talk about a lot of things where we can see applications

06:58.820 --> 07:03.280
that aren't just gaming, and people sometimes forget, there's more to this Oculus thing

07:03.280 --> 07:04.280
than gaming.

07:04.280 --> 07:08.300
In fact, I would argue to be really successful, the Oculus is going to need to be more than

07:08.300 --> 07:09.300
gaming.

07:09.300 --> 07:11.900
And we've talked about some of the demos here previously on the show that you've showed

07:11.900 --> 07:15.620
me like the Cirque du Soleil and the Paul McCartney concert and so forth.

07:15.620 --> 07:20.220
So I mean, do you think that the non-gaming stuff we're going to see maybe twice as much

07:20.220 --> 07:22.700
of that as we even do gaming over the coming weeks?

07:22.740 --> 07:27.580
Maybe, because I know Oculus is doing a big thing with the Oculus Studio in the 360 movies

07:27.580 --> 07:29.900
and the experiences like that.

07:29.900 --> 07:32.200
So I think we're going to be seeing the games right now.

07:32.200 --> 07:35.500
And they showed a lot of AAA games, everybody's like, where's my AAA games?

07:35.500 --> 07:39.620
Well, they showed them to you, and then they're going to be investing $10 million into indies,

07:39.620 --> 07:41.300
which is great.

07:41.300 --> 07:47.740
So it's going to be really neat to see what comes out of it and where it goes from here.

07:47.740 --> 07:51.700
Let's talk a little bit about E3 predictions and what we think is going to happen in the

07:51.700 --> 07:56.060
coming days here, because this is always a fun game to do, especially because next

07:56.060 --> 07:58.340
week we'll look back and see how wrong we were.

07:58.340 --> 08:02.900
Loki and I did this a little bit last week, but Jamie, I'll ask you in a moment if you

08:02.900 --> 08:06.140
want to chime in with anything you might have wanted to give in about what you want to see

08:06.140 --> 08:07.140
at E3.

08:07.140 --> 08:10.340
But Bobby, I know you've talked a little bit on your show, but what do you hope to see

08:10.340 --> 08:11.900
coming in the coming days out of E3?

08:11.900 --> 08:16.000
I know this is a little weird for you, because this is what, only the second year in many

08:16.000 --> 08:20.920
years that you aren't there in person, but we've talked about why and so forth.

08:20.920 --> 08:22.960
So looking forward.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.840
You know what?

08:24.840 --> 08:28.720
What I always say, even when I'm there, what's the thing I'm looking forward to see most

08:28.720 --> 08:30.960
is the thing I don't know about yet.

08:30.960 --> 08:35.220
I want to know the one thing that nobody knows about that just surprises everybody, surprises

08:35.220 --> 08:36.440
me and all that stuff.

08:36.440 --> 08:40.840
That's what I look forward to seeing.

08:40.840 --> 08:46.920
But I'd love to, I can't wait to hear what Oculus Touch, how that integrates, and how

08:46.920 --> 08:47.920
it actually works.

08:47.920 --> 08:52.460
The thing that was the big problem with input is tracking hands is hard.

08:52.460 --> 08:54.760
Tracking fingers is easy, though.

08:54.760 --> 08:58.340
So that's what they solved with the Oculus Touch is they track your hands with the things

08:58.340 --> 09:02.300
you're holding, but they can track your fingers inside of that.

09:02.300 --> 09:04.900
And then that gives you all the full range of everything.

09:04.900 --> 09:06.400
And that's not coming out until holiday.

09:06.400 --> 09:10.400
So the Oculus Rift will come out, and then the Oculus Touch comes later, which is going

09:10.400 --> 09:13.720
to be kind of scary, because it's going to be a peripheral that you're going to have

09:13.720 --> 09:16.280
to get later, and who knows how many people are going to support it.

09:16.800 --> 09:21.960
Go to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, because again, we do tape live every Sunday

09:21.960 --> 09:27.240
night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern-ish, you know, when we're not being pushed around

09:27.240 --> 09:32.200
by E3 things going on, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, unless, you know, his show

09:32.200 --> 09:34.920
also gets bumped, and he just comes on our show and makes it work.

09:34.920 --> 09:41.100
But we do get live comments from our chatroom, including Megaman400, that's my buddy Delvin

09:41.100 --> 09:44.720
from Video Game Realness in our chat, saying, E3, get hyped.

09:44.720 --> 09:49.840
There's a lot of hype going around for E3, and I think what Nintendo did today with the

09:49.840 --> 09:54.600
Nintendo World Championships was probably a great way to, you know, get that hype going.

09:54.600 --> 09:55.600
I see a lot of...

09:55.600 --> 09:57.320
I didn't get to see the whole thing, admittedly.

09:57.320 --> 10:00.920
I have so much going on that I was kind of busy during the day, but certainly I was feeling

10:00.920 --> 10:04.640
a lot of the energy at the end there, and I see a lot of people on Twitter going like,

10:04.640 --> 10:07.760
you know, Nintendo, maybe you shouldn't, like, put this to bed for 20 years.

10:07.760 --> 10:10.240
You should think about doing this type of thing annually.

10:10.240 --> 10:11.600
I don't know.

10:11.600 --> 10:15.680
Loki, sometimes you're a vocal critic of Nintendo, but you seemed really into what was going

10:15.680 --> 10:16.680
on.

10:16.680 --> 10:17.680
What are your thoughts?

10:17.680 --> 10:18.680
Well, I liked the World Championship.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.480
I thought that was done well, and same with, like, even the Smash Brothers tournament.

10:20.480 --> 10:23.920
Their live presentations were good.

10:23.920 --> 10:26.920
So they have that going for them, and even, like, the kind of go...

10:26.920 --> 10:32.240
Yeah, pretty much the whole live presentation part of Nintendo, like the E3 live from the

10:32.240 --> 10:34.920
Treehouse thing last year was great.

10:34.920 --> 10:40.080
I thought, and I know I've commented today, I wish more developers would do that, because

10:40.080 --> 10:43.900
that was, I think, a lot more effective at showing their titles, because they had so

10:43.900 --> 10:44.900
much to unveil.

10:44.900 --> 10:48.680
They didn't even fit it in all the three directs that they had last year, and I don't know

10:48.680 --> 10:53.600
how many directs they're having this year, because they already had one today.

10:53.600 --> 10:57.120
So I think it's a good thing, and I think that they...

10:57.120 --> 11:00.400
It's definitely a good way to show off, you know, Mario Maker, that's for sure.

11:00.400 --> 11:04.080
Yeah, I think a lot of people were definitely turning their heads when they saw what was

11:04.080 --> 11:06.080
in a lot of those levels, like, okay, there's gonna be much...

11:06.080 --> 11:08.720
You're like, okay, you can, you know, do some stuff in Mario Maker.

11:08.720 --> 11:12.920
I've seen ROM hacks before, okay, cool, I know what to expect, but it's like kind of

11:12.920 --> 11:16.100
a lot more exciting, like, oh, hey, you can actually do this.

11:16.100 --> 11:19.320
That's really ridiculous, you know, that type of stuff.

11:19.320 --> 11:20.320
Yeah, absolutely.

11:20.320 --> 11:21.400
Bobby, what do you think?

11:21.400 --> 11:22.920
Is this something they should do every year?

11:22.920 --> 11:25.820
Yeah, I mean, this was actually really good.

11:25.820 --> 11:29.560
What you didn't get to see was they announced a new game, Blast Ball, for the 3DS, which

11:29.560 --> 11:34.720
is soccer with mechs, three versus three, and they showed that for the first time, and

11:34.720 --> 11:37.080
everybody was playing it for the first time.

11:37.080 --> 11:41.080
But I just really liked the tone that they set really early on, and this was kind of

11:41.080 --> 11:44.960
a...they did something that was a little controversial with some people.

11:44.960 --> 11:50.200
DJ Wheat is, you know, alleged in the esports commentating, well, he's got a family, and

11:50.200 --> 11:52.120
his son is DJ Mini Wheat.

11:52.120 --> 11:53.120
He's nine.

11:53.120 --> 11:54.480
He loves Splatoon.

11:54.480 --> 11:59.400
They opened with Splatoon and actually brought DJ Mini Wheat out to commentate with his father.

11:59.400 --> 12:00.400
Oh, fun.

12:00.400 --> 12:01.400
And the other people.

12:01.400 --> 12:06.560
And he was actually dropping more knowledge and more strat than most esports commentators

12:06.560 --> 12:07.560
out there.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.560
And a lot of people were like, get the kid.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.000
The kid is annoying, blah, blah, blah.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.960
But that really set the tone that, you know, this is family-friendly and, you know, we're

12:14.960 --> 12:15.960
for everybody.

12:15.960 --> 12:21.200
Oh, and kids are so important, and kids are the market for Splatoon right now.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.200
You know what I mean?

12:22.200 --> 12:24.680
Well, I shouldn't say that, because a lot of adults, obviously, like, I'm enjoying it

12:24.680 --> 12:25.680
and so forth.

12:25.680 --> 12:29.720
But I mean, like, there's lots of kids that are super into Splatoon, like, just seeing

12:29.720 --> 12:34.220
on Twitter, especially a lot of gamer mommies and gamer daddies playing Splatoon with their

12:34.220 --> 12:35.220
kids.

12:35.220 --> 12:36.220
Well, here's my thing.

12:36.220 --> 12:40.360
If you throw kids into Splatoon, like, kids are hooked into Call of Duty right now.

12:40.360 --> 12:44.220
But it's a little bit more, you know, it's not so violent.

12:44.220 --> 12:46.500
It's actually age-appropriate for them.

12:46.500 --> 12:49.620
You know, if you can get them hooked into, like, you know, online, competitive online

12:49.620 --> 12:53.940
gameplay like Call of Duty, then you're not going to have a problem.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.340
And they made sure that you got Splat not killed.

12:56.340 --> 12:57.340
Yes.

12:57.340 --> 12:58.340
Yeah.

12:58.340 --> 12:59.340
Yeah.

12:59.340 --> 13:02.220
And it's interesting, because also you notice there's little nuances with Splatoon that

13:02.220 --> 13:04.620
it doesn't tell you who splatted you.

13:04.620 --> 13:06.860
It just tells you what weapon you got splatted with.

13:06.860 --> 13:11.740
But you don't even know necessarily who landed the quote-unquote, I guess, Splat Shot.

13:11.740 --> 13:15.380
Who got the Splat Shot on you instead of Kill Shot, Splat Shot, because it doesn't tell

13:15.380 --> 13:16.380
you who.

13:16.380 --> 13:17.380
So it's kind of interesting.

13:17.380 --> 13:18.380
Little nuances like that.

13:18.380 --> 13:21.460
I want to make sure Dark Soccer is able to get in a word here, because you watched a

13:21.460 --> 13:23.740
little bit of the NWC with us here in studio and with Dan, right?

13:23.740 --> 13:25.420
What was your thoughts on that whole thing?

13:25.420 --> 13:26.420
Super Metroid.

13:26.420 --> 13:27.900
You enjoyed that part of it?

13:27.900 --> 13:29.900
I heard I missed it, yeah?

13:29.900 --> 13:30.900
It's funny though.

13:30.900 --> 13:33.700
We're like, oh, we're Baby Metroid.

13:33.700 --> 13:36.460
And then you hear the people, oh, this is the sad part.

13:36.460 --> 13:38.420
It's all the feels.

13:38.420 --> 13:41.580
Did they save the animals at the end?

13:41.580 --> 13:43.740
In the little side passage, you can save the animals?

13:43.740 --> 13:44.740
Oh, no.

13:44.740 --> 13:47.420
It was basically, how quickly can you get out?

13:47.420 --> 13:48.420
Dicks.

13:48.420 --> 13:49.420
Fuck the animals.

13:49.420 --> 13:50.420
We're out of here.

13:50.420 --> 13:51.420
We've got to win.

13:51.420 --> 13:53.420
Blinded by the trophy.

13:53.420 --> 13:54.420
I see how it is.

13:54.420 --> 13:55.420
I see how it is.

13:55.420 --> 14:03.100
Well, pretty much they were pretty good players, although I think that the very last level

14:03.100 --> 14:05.700
had to have been some stage fright or something.

14:05.700 --> 14:09.700
Yeah, I feel bad for that guy who really got caught up on the wall jumps, but I get caught

14:09.700 --> 14:10.700
up on wall jumps too.

14:10.700 --> 14:13.020
The wall jump boss is the worst.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.660
He's still a very talented guy, I forget as far as he is.

14:14.660 --> 14:19.700
He's just going to end up in an asylum someday, kind of like, what is it?

14:19.700 --> 14:20.700
You're morbid.

14:20.700 --> 14:27.060
Like Ace Ventura, Pet Detective, wall jumps, wall jumps, laces out, laces out.

14:27.060 --> 14:28.060
Oh, God.

14:28.060 --> 14:29.060
All right.

14:30.020 --> 14:32.980
What are you hoping to see out of E3 in these coming days?

14:32.980 --> 14:33.980
Stuff.

14:33.980 --> 14:36.500
Just stuff?

14:36.500 --> 14:40.460
I want my faith in the industry to be redeemed.

14:40.460 --> 14:45.700
Ah, so you don't want any giant fuck ups where somebody says something.

14:45.700 --> 14:46.700
Don't fuck it up.

14:46.700 --> 14:47.700
Don't.

14:47.700 --> 14:49.500
Good luck and don't fuck it up.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.660
I've never even watched that show.

14:51.660 --> 14:52.660
You really should.

14:52.660 --> 14:53.660
Haven't you?

14:53.660 --> 14:55.660
Did you interview one of the contestants for one of your other sites?

14:55.660 --> 14:56.660
I did, Tatiana.

14:56.660 --> 14:57.660
Yeah, that's funny.

14:57.660 --> 15:03.340
I remember back when I was having that site, I was working on the site with Tiara.

15:03.340 --> 15:04.340
Yeah, good times.

15:04.340 --> 15:05.340
Good times.

15:05.340 --> 15:10.980
Anyway, surely, surely you've got to be on the edge of your seat like me for EA's conference

15:10.980 --> 15:13.620
tomorrow and Mass Effect.

15:13.620 --> 15:18.620
Like I'm going to be effing pissed if they don't show anything for Mass Effect.

15:18.620 --> 15:21.820
You'll pay for the whole seat, but you'll only need the edge.

15:21.820 --> 15:22.820
So get a refund.

15:22.820 --> 15:25.380
I want a goddamn trailer tomorrow and I want a name.

15:25.380 --> 15:26.380
Give me the name.

15:26.780 --> 15:27.780
We'll see.

15:28.660 --> 15:33.620
And I want to know if, I'm hoping we might get to see some of the voice actors and actresses.

15:33.620 --> 15:35.340
I want more Dragon Age DLC.

15:35.340 --> 15:36.340
See if Jennifer Hale's in it.

15:36.340 --> 15:37.340
I'm sure you'll get that.

15:37.340 --> 15:42.060
I want them to announce Wolf Hunt DLC and that won't make me happy.

15:42.060 --> 15:46.640
All right, let's go into recapping a little bit of the news from today with what little

15:46.640 --> 15:47.780
time we have left.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.860
And Bobby, I'll check in with you too so you can get your word in edgewise on any of this

15:50.860 --> 15:53.100
news this week you want to get in on.

15:53.260 --> 15:57.300
Let's start off the top here with some of the Nintendo stuff that's gone on today.

15:57.300 --> 16:01.140
Loki, another big announcement at the NWC this evening, right?

16:01.140 --> 16:02.140
Yes.

16:02.140 --> 16:05.580
And then on top of that, I'm so surprised to see that someone actually beat me to a

16:05.580 --> 16:08.060
tumbler that's timed to penis.

16:08.060 --> 16:09.060
Really?

16:09.060 --> 16:10.060
Is there actually a tumbler?

16:10.060 --> 16:11.060
Seriously.

16:11.060 --> 16:15.660
And here's the quote, eventually all user-generated content will tend towards the crude drawings

16:15.660 --> 16:16.660
of fallacies.

16:16.660 --> 16:17.660
I'm sure it's one of our listeners.

16:17.660 --> 16:18.660
Probably.

16:18.660 --> 16:20.540
Jamie, is that one of your tumblers?

16:20.540 --> 16:21.540
Time to penis?

16:21.540 --> 16:22.540
I have to check.

16:22.540 --> 16:23.540
Anyway.

16:23.540 --> 16:24.540
That's pretty awesome.

16:24.540 --> 16:32.820
Anyways, so lots of news from Nintendo today actually, including Mother 1 being released

16:32.820 --> 16:37.540
on Wii U Virtual Console as Earthbound Beginnings.

16:37.540 --> 16:41.580
And they actually took the, they actually localized it.

16:41.580 --> 16:45.860
Which makes me wonder, is Earth, is Mother 3 that far behind?

16:45.860 --> 16:50.340
Well, keep in mind, they may not have had to do as much work as you think, because they

16:50.340 --> 16:52.580
had localized that game before.

16:52.580 --> 16:56.180
There was that English ROM that was floating around on the internet several years ago.

16:56.180 --> 16:57.940
I'm still floating around out there today.

16:57.940 --> 17:00.180
So they had already fully translated that into English.

17:00.180 --> 17:04.220
They just made a business decision not to ultimately put that game out on the NES.

17:04.220 --> 17:09.140
And then there were weird things with that ROM that made it unbeatable until people hacked

17:09.140 --> 17:10.140
it.

17:10.140 --> 17:12.900
So they didn't just do this translation yesterday.

17:12.900 --> 17:16.260
They might have gone in and, I mean, somebody will have to do a side-by-side comparison

17:16.260 --> 17:19.900
with the old prototype versus what ultimately goes on a Virtual Console.

17:19.900 --> 17:23.660
I'm sure there was some tweaking that had to be done, but I don't think this was a months

17:23.660 --> 17:24.660
and months project.

17:24.660 --> 17:30.420
I think this is something where Nintendo is getting a little more tuned in to what fans

17:30.420 --> 17:32.780
around the world want.

17:32.780 --> 17:36.020
And this is one of those things where you kind of look at it and go, you know, they

17:36.020 --> 17:38.300
really should have just released this five or six years ago.

17:38.300 --> 17:45.020
And also was the Nintendo Direct about Smash, which kind of confirmed all the leaked DLC

17:45.020 --> 17:51.380
tales that were out there before, including DLC characters, including Roy from Fire Emblem.

17:51.380 --> 18:00.140
They also have Ryu from Street Fighter 2, and then they were also adding, who else was

18:00.140 --> 18:01.140
it?

18:01.140 --> 18:02.140
Lucas.

18:02.140 --> 18:03.140
Lucas, yes.

18:03.140 --> 18:04.140
But I thought they already talked about Lucas.

18:04.140 --> 18:06.740
They had talked about Lucas previously, so that wasn't necessarily new information.

18:06.740 --> 18:09.300
It was just the fact that, you know, it's, well, they'd even said it was going to come

18:09.300 --> 18:10.300
out today.

18:10.300 --> 18:12.760
So it was more like Lucas and friends.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.120
Maybe the Earthbound thing is tied into Lucas's release.

18:16.120 --> 18:20.400
Like, I know Lucas isn't from the original, but he's from one that isn't even out here.

18:20.400 --> 18:24.320
But maybe that was part of why they did that today was like, it's Lucas and we're going

18:24.320 --> 18:28.760
to do like an Earthbound, you know, adjacent type of release, which is, you know, because

18:28.760 --> 18:33.240
they like to use Smash Brothers to promote all the virtual console stuff, clearly.

18:33.240 --> 18:38.440
So what do you guys think about Ryu in Smash Brothers?

18:38.440 --> 18:40.840
Dark Sakura, you loved Street Fighter, right?

18:40.920 --> 18:45.480
Yeah, it was very pretty because the intro was like the Super Street Fighter II Turbo

18:45.480 --> 18:46.480
opening.

18:46.480 --> 18:54.320
Actually, no, not the Turbo opening, just the regular Super Street Fighter II.

18:54.320 --> 18:57.800
And that one, the moment I was like, oh, happy.

18:57.800 --> 18:58.800
I'm excited about it.

18:58.800 --> 19:01.600
And then his level is level in the game.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.600
Yeah.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.600
And his music's in there.

19:03.600 --> 19:04.600
Yeah.

19:04.600 --> 19:05.600
Yeah.

19:05.600 --> 19:10.560
Which I must say that that was probably my first video game crush was Ryu.

19:10.560 --> 19:14.960
The funny thing, though, about that is that they don't have a Street Fighter game that

19:14.960 --> 19:17.080
they've released on the Wii U.

19:17.080 --> 19:21.320
Street Fighter IV is not coming in the Wii U, or V.

19:21.320 --> 19:22.320
Here's the thing.

19:22.320 --> 19:26.560
It's almost like, and I've seen them do this with other characters, it's like Mega Man.

19:26.560 --> 19:32.560
Most people have the sentimental tie to it from Super Nintendo Street Fighter II, right?

19:32.560 --> 19:34.580
And they do still have that on virtual console.

19:34.580 --> 19:39.640
So you could argue that you can play Ryu on the Wii U, it's just, hey, I made a little

19:39.640 --> 19:40.640
crime.

19:40.640 --> 19:41.640
Ryu, Wii U.

19:41.640 --> 19:44.680
And then to go along with that, of course, they have a new, well, they announced more

19:44.680 --> 19:45.680
Amiibos.

19:45.680 --> 19:48.080
So you're gonna have the Mii Amiibos as well.

19:48.080 --> 19:52.560
Rob, the robot, is gonna be an Amiibo.

19:52.560 --> 19:54.640
They even talked about, of course, Lucas.

19:54.640 --> 19:58.700
And they even said Mewtwo was gonna be an Amiibo as well.

19:58.700 --> 20:03.760
With that, though, the Mii fighters are getting more costumes as well, including stuff from

20:03.760 --> 20:14.340
Virtua Fighter, Tekken, and Street Fighter II in there as well, Mega Man EXE, I saw that,

20:14.340 --> 20:20.840
and then Mega Man X, because I know you could do Zero for the Sword Fighter.

20:20.840 --> 20:21.840
Right.

20:21.840 --> 20:24.680
Bobby, what are your thoughts on some of the news today?

20:24.680 --> 20:29.480
I don't know if you're a big Smash Brothers player, but would Ryu maybe change your mind?

20:29.480 --> 20:30.480
Maybe.

20:30.480 --> 20:35.760
I mean, it was neat to see, and they're bringing Virtua Fighter costumes and stuff.

20:35.760 --> 20:40.520
So I'll definitely hop in and maybe check it out, maybe buy the Ryu one.

20:40.520 --> 20:44.640
Earthbound Beginnings, I'm gonna be running up once we're done tonight and gonna go play

20:44.640 --> 20:48.880
that, because I did play the Earthbound Zero ROM a lot.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.480
And I love Earthbound, it's much better than Super Metroid.

20:51.480 --> 20:58.240
Yeah, no, it's kinda neat how they're taking the DLC thing and they really are extending

20:58.240 --> 20:59.240
their games.

20:59.240 --> 21:01.440
Mario Kart 8, they're doing it with Smash Brothers.

21:01.440 --> 21:07.120
They are making amiibo for every Smash Brothers fighter, including three, four of the Miis.

21:07.120 --> 21:10.200
So you got your Brawler Mi and the other two types of Miis.

21:10.200 --> 21:13.320
Oh, that was Game & Watch was gonna be another amiibo.

21:13.320 --> 21:17.120
And what's kinda weird about that one is they actually have different Game & Watch characters

21:17.120 --> 21:18.360
you can snap in there.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.360
That's kinda cool.

21:19.360 --> 21:23.740
I like that if they're gonna whore this amiibo thing to death, which I'm worried they're

21:23.740 --> 21:25.920
getting right, they're starting to teeter on that edge.

21:25.920 --> 21:31.240
Speaking of which, I was gonna mention, along with that, they're also teasing 8-Bit Mario,

21:31.240 --> 21:38.000
Animal Crossing, amiibo, and then other- See, and I'm worried that 8-Bit Mario unlocks

21:38.000 --> 21:41.320
things in Mario Maker that are already on the disc, you know what I mean?

21:41.320 --> 21:46.800
Like I'm just like, okay, I am starting, this is starting to get to that point.

21:46.800 --> 21:54.600
8-Bit Mario, 8-Bit Mario, he unlocks the fuckin' Tenderworld Championship levels that you play.

21:55.280 --> 22:00.080
What I'm hoping is that trophy, that the dude won, is an amiibo.

22:00.080 --> 22:03.520
It might, it might be, we'll see.

22:03.520 --> 22:08.760
A lot of folks in chat talking about the leak themselves, the fact that Ryu and Roy were

22:08.760 --> 22:11.920
leaked to the internet a couple days ago, well actually just about yesterday, I think.

22:11.920 --> 22:16.880
No, Ryu and Roy were leaked a while ago, that's- Oh, that's right, the files were leaked, but

22:16.880 --> 22:21.080
then the actual footage was yesterday, but that's because there was a patch in Japan

22:21.080 --> 22:23.400
or something that hackers gonna hack.

22:23.400 --> 22:25.200
They got in there and pulled all the data.

22:25.200 --> 22:28.520
So I see some folks in our chat room talking about, you know, I wish this stuff hadn't

22:28.520 --> 22:33.880
leaked because it would have been such more of a OMG mic drop and then the ceiling opens

22:33.880 --> 22:39.240
up and more mics drops type of moment for Nintendo, but unfortunately they lost that

22:39.240 --> 22:42.600
and we're seeing a lot of that, we're seeing a lot of leaks this year at E3.

22:42.600 --> 22:45.000
Can you drop mics in Mario Maker?

22:45.000 --> 22:48.680
That might be, maybe that's what the trophy unlocks, or the amiibo unlocks.

22:48.680 --> 22:49.680
We'll see.

22:49.680 --> 22:50.680
We'll see.

22:50.680 --> 22:52.840
What do you think about all these leaks, Loki?

22:52.880 --> 22:53.880
Are hackers gonna leak?

22:53.880 --> 22:54.880
I don't know.

22:54.880 --> 23:02.600
Don't trust your valuable secrets to people that are gonna break your NDAs.

23:02.600 --> 23:07.640
Or don't fucking send shit out in a pre-patch before you announce it.

23:07.640 --> 23:10.360
You know what else RuPaul says, besides the quote we had earlier?

23:10.360 --> 23:17.200
RuPaul also says this, maybe for this one, DarkSakura, trust no bitch.

23:17.200 --> 23:18.200
Maybe that's what-

23:18.200 --> 23:22.820
And Nintendo should know that because I remember a couple years ago when they announced

23:22.820 --> 23:28.060
the Wii U and actually announced the name of Wii U, they designed their booth with LCD

23:28.060 --> 23:32.300
screens all around it so they didn't have to send the name or the logo of the Wii U

23:32.300 --> 23:33.300
to printers.

23:33.300 --> 23:34.300
Oh my gosh.

23:34.300 --> 23:38.140
And all the actual hard copy signs said, New Nintendo Console.

23:38.140 --> 23:41.820
And then they announced the name and then they had all the LCD screens in the booth

23:41.820 --> 23:44.220
have the logo and all that stuff and all the branding.

23:44.220 --> 23:47.180
Probably because no one would have believed how stupid the name was.

23:47.180 --> 23:51.860
Alright, well we've got a whopping 10 minutes until Bethesda's gonna take the stage with

23:51.900 --> 23:56.420
whatever they're announcing tonight, which we figure is probably around Fallout 4.

23:56.420 --> 23:57.420
We know there's-

23:57.420 --> 23:58.420
Doom.

23:58.420 --> 23:59.420
A leak.

23:59.420 --> 24:00.420
Yippee.

24:00.420 --> 24:02.980
Speaking of leaks, we know Dishonored 2 is gonna be hitting there as well.

24:02.980 --> 24:04.500
I thought that was rumored for a long time.

24:04.500 --> 24:05.500
Yeah, it has.

24:05.500 --> 24:06.500
So we're gonna find out.

24:06.500 --> 24:08.940
But since we only have about 10 minutes, I wanna try and at least get a few of these

24:08.940 --> 24:12.860
other big stories from the week out of what we can and what little time we have here.

24:12.860 --> 24:15.820
And I wanna make sure Jamie gets at least two, three minutes to do the classic game

24:15.820 --> 24:16.980
of the week as well.

24:16.980 --> 24:17.980
Throw that out there.

24:17.980 --> 24:21.260
So, Loki, why don't you give us one of the big stories that came up this week.

24:21.260 --> 24:22.260
We'll talk about it quick.

24:22.260 --> 24:25.820
So this one doesn't make any- well, I guess it makes sense, but YouTube.

24:25.820 --> 24:28.660
They're gonna be doing YouTube gaming now.

24:28.660 --> 24:32.720
It's own Twitch streaming service.

24:32.720 --> 24:39.300
They also have a gaming app and yeah, it's a whole website dedicated to gaming.

24:39.300 --> 24:43.900
I'm really excited for this because I've been saying for a long time Twitch needs a viable

24:43.900 --> 24:47.820
competitor and I know you guys are like, hitbox, but the problem with these other sites is

24:47.820 --> 24:49.340
that none of them have an app.

24:49.340 --> 24:50.340
They're all like, you know, startups.

24:50.420 --> 24:51.420
Yeah, but I'm still-

24:51.420 --> 24:55.300
They're not really tied in, but YouTube has their paws in a lot of these places and they're

24:55.300 --> 24:57.020
gonna roll out the gate with the app and everything.

24:57.020 --> 25:02.220
So I feel like YouTube is the first viable competitor we're seeing to Twitch.

25:02.220 --> 25:04.420
And they'll let you scream hatred, I'm sure.

25:04.420 --> 25:06.380
Well, I don't know.

25:06.380 --> 25:07.380
If you want.

25:07.380 --> 25:08.880
Maybe, maybe not.

25:08.880 --> 25:09.880
Maybe they won't feature it.

25:09.880 --> 25:10.880
Who knows?

25:10.880 --> 25:11.880
I don't know.

25:11.880 --> 25:15.420
But with the whole YouTube stuff, the only thing that worries me, I have other concerns

25:15.420 --> 25:19.640
about YouTube, such as the whole, you know, content ID matching and all that.

25:19.940 --> 25:23.840
So I wonder how this whole, you know, if they're going to have the live element, how that is

25:23.840 --> 25:26.400
going to, you know, come into play.

25:26.400 --> 25:30.220
I feel like they don't do the content and copyright strike thing very well.

25:30.220 --> 25:34.120
So I'd like to see how that's going to be improved, but I feel like competition will

25:34.120 --> 25:37.280
make this a little better between the two because, you know, now they're going to be

25:37.280 --> 25:41.280
competing for people to use this particular service.

25:41.280 --> 25:42.280
I don't know.

25:42.280 --> 25:45.200
Bobby, your thoughts?

25:45.200 --> 25:46.200
Competition is good.

25:46.200 --> 25:50.120
You can already stream live YouTube channels, like on the PS4 YouTube app.

25:50.120 --> 25:52.660
So it's already on the consoles and everything.

25:52.660 --> 25:54.840
So yeah, competition is good.

25:54.840 --> 25:57.700
Dungeon Buster says, I like Twitch's reaction when they tweeted something like, Welcome

25:57.700 --> 25:58.700
Player 2.

25:58.700 --> 26:01.320
And I'm like, I bet Hitbox is out there going, ouch.

26:01.320 --> 26:02.320
Yeah.

26:02.320 --> 26:05.780
And actually, Tigerclaws corrected me in chat saying, Hitbox actually has an app.

26:05.780 --> 26:09.440
And I'm not trying to like throw the shade and hate on Hitbox.

26:09.440 --> 26:10.440
That's not what I'm doing.

26:10.440 --> 26:14.720
Like, you know, props to them for trying, but I feel like their foot is not wedged in

26:14.720 --> 26:17.320
the door the way that YouTube is.

26:17.320 --> 26:21.920
You know, we know as well that YouTube tried to buy Twitch at one point and that didn't

26:21.920 --> 26:22.920
work out.

26:22.920 --> 26:23.920
Amazon got them.

26:23.920 --> 26:27.760
So it's almost like this was always in Google's cards that they were going to have something

26:27.760 --> 26:28.760
like this.

26:28.760 --> 26:29.760
So here we go.

26:29.760 --> 26:34.480
And, you know, you even go to things like PAX and I'm sure at E3 even, there's a Twitch

26:34.480 --> 26:36.180
booth and a YouTube booth now.

26:36.180 --> 26:38.560
You didn't see that three, four years ago.

26:38.560 --> 26:42.640
You know, these guys regularly show up to these gaming conferences now, and now we're

26:42.640 --> 26:44.160
going to have ourselves a little battle.

26:44.160 --> 26:46.320
So this'll be, this'll be interesting.

26:46.320 --> 26:48.720
Very interesting.

26:48.720 --> 26:53.620
Another big announcement that came out this week was the fact that the Mega Man Legacy

26:53.620 --> 26:55.880
Collection is going to be happening.

26:55.880 --> 27:00.920
The Mega Man Legacy Collection was announced for the Nintendo 3DS, the PlayStation 4, the

27:00.920 --> 27:06.520
PC and the Xbox One, but not the Wii U, which is interesting.

27:06.520 --> 27:07.880
We'll put Miibos on there.

27:07.880 --> 27:08.880
You got a Miibos.

27:08.880 --> 27:10.500
But yet it's on the 3DS.

27:10.500 --> 27:12.520
So I'm not, you can't say it's a technical thing.

27:12.520 --> 27:14.920
You can't handle the power of Mega Man.

27:14.920 --> 27:18.760
So I'm not sure what's up with that, and there's a lot of people that don't know what's up

27:18.760 --> 27:19.760
with that.

27:19.760 --> 27:24.480
But anyway, it's going to be coming out, I believe the price is somewhere around $15

27:24.480 --> 27:25.760
is what we're looking at.

27:25.760 --> 27:29.200
And it's going to feature the first six Mega Man games.

27:29.200 --> 27:33.460
Now some of you, and I'm sure many of you actually even right now, are making that comparison

27:33.460 --> 27:40.720
to the, what, the original Xbox and the PlayStation 2 and the GameCube release of the Mega Man

27:40.720 --> 27:41.720
Museum.

27:41.920 --> 27:42.920
I don't remember what they called it.

27:42.920 --> 27:47.240
Just the Mega Man collection or something like that that came out that was the first

27:47.240 --> 27:49.920
eight Mega Man games.

27:49.920 --> 27:55.080
And if I remember right, it had the arcade fighter and all that stuff too.

27:55.080 --> 27:58.640
So you're actually losing a few games with this newer collection.

27:58.640 --> 28:04.200
However, some things to note, this is cheaper, although one could argue that you could find

28:04.200 --> 28:07.440
a used copy of that old collection probably for just as much.

28:07.440 --> 28:11.960
But it's also going to have a new museum mode and a challenge mode.

28:11.960 --> 28:15.680
Challenge mode will have different gameplay segments from all six games, sounds a little

28:15.680 --> 28:19.520
bit like NES Remix, but with the Mega Man games maybe.

28:19.520 --> 28:23.320
And also I guess some type of like leaderboard will be there as well.

28:23.320 --> 28:28.480
And what's also interesting about this is this is coming from, and the name of the company

28:28.480 --> 28:32.000
escapes my mind, Digital Eclipse, is that the company that's putting this out?

28:32.000 --> 28:34.060
I think it is.

28:34.060 --> 28:38.020
And they've been kind of dormant for a little while and they've basically resurfaced with

28:38.020 --> 28:46.200
this saying that their goal right now is to make the criterion collection of video games.

28:46.200 --> 28:52.280
And so this is in some ways the first inductee into that very special collection of video

28:52.280 --> 28:53.340
games.

28:53.340 --> 28:57.540
So I'm interested.

28:57.540 --> 29:03.700
I think it'll look better on the TV like the one I have now as opposed to hooking up the

29:03.700 --> 29:05.780
old collection and playing it there.

29:05.780 --> 29:10.740
I'm intrigued by some of this online and challenge mode and some of these extra things, but yeah,

29:10.740 --> 29:14.420
they're going to have a big hill to kind of get over with the whole, why aren't these

29:14.420 --> 29:16.260
other games there and so on.

29:16.260 --> 29:18.960
Why isn't this running native 1080p?

29:18.960 --> 29:20.500
Is this totally upscaled?

29:20.500 --> 29:22.900
Well, I don't know.

29:22.900 --> 29:26.860
Why can't Samus crouch?

29:26.860 --> 29:27.860
What do you mean?

29:27.860 --> 29:28.860
What do you mean it's cropped?

29:28.860 --> 29:29.860
I can't see what they didn't.

29:29.860 --> 29:30.860
They didn't fix it.

29:30.860 --> 29:31.860
So you could do widescreen in this.

29:31.860 --> 29:32.860
What's up with that?

29:32.860 --> 29:33.860
I don't know.

29:33.860 --> 29:34.860
We'll see.

29:34.860 --> 29:40.860
Jamie, would you, would you pay 15 bucks for this type of collection on the PC?

29:40.860 --> 29:41.860
I don't know.

29:41.860 --> 29:42.860
No, no.

29:42.860 --> 29:43.860
You have to see a little more.

29:43.860 --> 29:44.860
Yeah.

29:44.860 --> 29:45.860
Got to get your hands on with it.

29:45.860 --> 29:46.860
I understand.

29:46.860 --> 29:49.860
Why pay $15 when you could pay $2 on a Steam sale?

29:49.860 --> 29:50.860
Exactly.

29:50.860 --> 29:54.060
Bobby, you're going to pick this up?

29:54.060 --> 29:59.820
No, I've never been very good at Mega Man, so I've already played him and lost.

29:59.820 --> 30:01.420
Oh, and that's how it goes.

30:01.420 --> 30:03.620
If you can't beat the demo, you don't buy the game, right?

30:03.620 --> 30:04.620
That's right.

30:04.620 --> 30:06.380
That's why I never bought Mega Man 9 or 10.

30:06.380 --> 30:07.940
Oh, man.

30:07.940 --> 30:08.940
Those were some hard demos.

30:08.940 --> 30:12.220
All right, well, guys, we're coming up about on 7 o'clock.

30:12.220 --> 30:15.940
We're going to have to take a break here because Nintendo chopped off the beginning of our

30:15.940 --> 30:18.340
show, and now Bethesda's chopping off the middle here.

30:18.340 --> 30:21.060
They're going to nuke it for more of it, if you will.

30:21.060 --> 30:25.100
But you know, Jamie's got to get a word in edgewise here, people, and every week here

30:25.100 --> 30:28.940
on the show, she likes to take us on a trip down memory lane.

30:28.940 --> 30:31.260
You know what, Jamie, screw all this new shit.

30:31.300 --> 30:35.180
All this stuff people are going to see this week, it don't matter.

30:35.180 --> 30:36.180
It don't matter.

30:36.180 --> 30:38.380
You've got a thousand games out there you can already play, right?

30:38.380 --> 30:40.100
Yeah, and this one's old as balls.

30:40.100 --> 30:43.860
So here it is, the classic game of the week.

30:43.860 --> 30:47.260
Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey,

30:47.260 --> 30:49.300
you should check this game out this week.

30:49.300 --> 30:51.100
Screw all this newfangled shit.

30:51.100 --> 30:54.580
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

30:54.580 --> 31:00.620
In honor of Bethesda's upcoming chat about stuff, I'm going back to something that kind

31:00.660 --> 31:02.860
of started a lot of this for them.

31:02.860 --> 31:09.980
Back to 1994, for PC-DOS, yes, I'm talking about Elder Scrolls Arena, the first in the

31:09.980 --> 31:14.540
Elder Scrolls lineage, I should say.

31:14.540 --> 31:20.540
So basically, it has a lot in common with its sequels, I mean, this one pretty much

31:20.540 --> 31:25.460
laid the foundation of it, but you are playing from first person's perspective.

31:25.460 --> 31:29.500
You have melee combat with your mouse, you can drag a cursor across the screen to attack.

31:29.500 --> 31:34.700
You have magic with a menu and everything, and it's basically going around and going

31:34.700 --> 31:45.540
to inns, farms, dungeons, killing creatures, doing story stuff, exploring, and it actually

31:45.540 --> 31:48.040
was a pretty, I'd say a difficult one.

31:48.040 --> 31:55.340
This one just was not really one of the easiest games I think I've ever played, but there

31:55.340 --> 32:00.500
is a little bit more of a story behind this one too.

32:00.500 --> 32:11.500
Basically it has to deal with banishing an apprentice, the main baddy guy, banished his

32:11.500 --> 32:20.500
apprentice to the, I guess, killed her pretty much, and her soul basically makes it through

32:20.500 --> 32:24.660
and teaches you how to escape the dungeon and a bunch of other stuff, you have to rescue

32:24.660 --> 32:27.580
the real emperor and lots of other stuff.

32:27.580 --> 32:31.700
I didn't play too much of this one myself, but I figured I was going to bring it up just

32:31.700 --> 32:34.980
because it's Bethesda.

32:34.980 --> 32:40.420
And without this game, we wouldn't have Skyrim or Elder Scrolls Online, which was a big deal

32:40.420 --> 32:41.420
this week.

32:41.420 --> 32:45.220
But the biggest influence of this one, this was a really big thing I liked, was that they

32:45.220 --> 32:57.580
thought that because it had been highly influenced by Ultima and by pen and paper roleplay games,

32:57.580 --> 33:03.900
as well as just a few other type of first person games that had been out including Legends

33:03.900 --> 33:05.080
of Valor.

33:05.080 --> 33:11.100
So I'm only going to keep this one quick because I know we've got stuff coming up, so there

33:11.100 --> 33:12.460
you go.

33:12.460 --> 33:19.260
As far as any kind of releases on this, it came out Christmas Day 1994, well it was supposed

33:19.260 --> 33:23.660
to, but then it got released on November 28th before the Christmas rush.

33:23.660 --> 33:31.300
And it came out on CD-ROM and three and a half inch floppy disk, but the CD-ROM had

33:31.300 --> 33:38.580
enhanced speech, different CG video sequences, and then in late 1994 it was re-released as

33:38.580 --> 33:45.100
a deluxe edition with the CD-ROM with the latest patch, as well as a map of Tom Reel

33:45.100 --> 33:48.700
and a big hint book.

33:48.700 --> 33:54.700
And then it was later released in 2004 as freeware, but it was the three and a half

33:54.700 --> 33:57.500
floppy disk version and not the CD-ROM.

33:57.500 --> 34:02.660
And you may need a DOSBox to run it since it was a DOS based program.

34:02.660 --> 34:08.420
And then later on in 2007, the CD-ROM version was released as a limited edition re-release

34:08.420 --> 34:14.100
for PC, and it included DOSBox on it so you would have compatibility issues and it had

34:14.100 --> 34:16.060
the same type of cover as Morrowind.

34:16.060 --> 34:17.380
So there you go.

34:17.380 --> 34:23.260
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week arena, Elder Scrolls.

34:23.260 --> 34:29.220
There it is, we're at about seven o'clock and this has never happened to us, trying

34:29.220 --> 34:33.180
to do a live OLR before, but we're being bumped by a press conference.

34:33.180 --> 34:38.660
So we are going to take a break here while the Bethesda press conference begins and we'll

34:38.660 --> 34:41.660
be back whenever it's over to wrap up and get your guys' thoughts.

34:41.660 --> 34:44.700
Hey Bobby, thanks so much for joining us at the beginning of the show here.

34:44.700 --> 34:48.700
I'm sorry that we didn't get to spend more time with you or that your own show got bumped,

34:48.700 --> 34:50.620
but I'm glad we got to have a little chat.

34:50.620 --> 34:52.740
It's always nice to come on this side of the fence.

34:52.740 --> 34:54.580
It is, you should make it happen more often.

34:54.580 --> 34:57.020
All right, take care my friend, we're gonna let you go while we go to break.

34:57.020 --> 34:58.020
All right, see ya.

34:58.020 --> 34:59.020
All right, see ya.

34:59.020 --> 35:04.500
All right, and we'll be back after this to get your reactions to Bethesda and more when

35:04.500 --> 35:12.620
Orange Lounge Radio returns.

35:12.620 --> 35:18.040
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live with this E3 2015 special edition for

35:18.040 --> 35:21.300
June the 14th of 2015.

35:21.300 --> 35:25.140
For those of you listening on the podcast feed, you're probably like, wow, that went

35:25.140 --> 35:26.140
by really fast.

35:26.140 --> 35:30.900
But in real time, as we're live on this Sunday evening, a whole 90 minutes just went by as

35:30.900 --> 35:35.460
we watch the Bethesda press conference here at Studio N7.

35:35.460 --> 35:38.460
I do want to note, just because I never got around to housekeeping, because we've had

35:38.460 --> 35:41.900
to move really fast tonight, you'll notice tonight's episode does not have an official

35:41.900 --> 35:49.380
number designation, so we will resume with episode 602 next week, June the 21st of 2015,

35:49.380 --> 35:53.220
since tonight's show is super abbreviated, we're having to cut a lot of corners, we're

35:53.220 --> 35:56.420
not going to be able to do gaming week and probably a lot of our usual segments.

35:56.420 --> 36:00.660
Some people don't know how to read a calendar and don't know when E3 starts, and it's like,

36:00.660 --> 36:04.740
okay, E3's next week, you don't need to be doing all your press conferences like a week

36:04.740 --> 36:05.740
in advance.

36:05.740 --> 36:09.840
I know, I know, there's so much that it's spilling over into the day before.

36:09.840 --> 36:14.500
DarkSakura actually had to leave, she has training going on at work, so she had to be

36:14.500 --> 36:18.180
in early, so she knew she had to leave at 830, and once the press conference is going

36:18.180 --> 36:21.380
on and on, you know, she realizes she has to leave.

36:21.380 --> 36:23.980
She'll be back next week for episode number 602.

36:23.980 --> 36:28.860
Meanwhile, though, with our E3 2015 special, since we did just watch the Bethesda press

36:28.860 --> 36:32.060
conference and things are fresh in our mind, let's talk about our thoughts.

36:32.060 --> 36:37.380
And in a little while, I will be opening up the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR or username

36:37.380 --> 36:41.700
on Skype, Orange Launch Radio, so you guys can share your thoughts as well.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.840
But first, let's talk here in studio.

36:43.840 --> 36:46.500
So, Loki, what did you think overall Bethesda's first go at the press conference?

36:46.500 --> 36:47.780
I thought it was pretty good.

36:47.780 --> 36:52.060
The only weak point I think that was in there was Battlecry.

36:52.060 --> 36:55.620
I think that just didn't look that interesting at all.

36:55.620 --> 36:58.980
But everything else looked fine, you know, Fallout 4 looked great, Doom looked better

36:58.980 --> 37:02.740
than I thought it was gonna, and Dishonored 2 was nice.

37:02.740 --> 37:05.820
Battlecry is a holdover from last year, because that was one of the few games that Bethesda

37:05.820 --> 37:11.700
had last year, when being at E3 last year, their booth only consisted of the evil within

37:11.700 --> 37:16.180
in that game, Battlecry, which was for a lot of the Team Fortress elements.

37:16.180 --> 37:20.620
I thought it was fun to play, I'll check out that beta when it goes out, especially

37:20.620 --> 37:23.220
since they're using the free-to-play model.

37:23.220 --> 37:29.220
But yeah, I think next to a lot of the other stuff they were showing, it kind of, you know,

37:29.220 --> 37:34.980
it was a footnote, I think, compared to Doom, which I wasn't really expecting to care about.

37:34.980 --> 37:40.900
You know, I used to love the old-school first-person shooters, like Doom, Quake, Wolfenstein, I

37:40.900 --> 37:43.660
used to love those old-school games, but I don't know, they kinda, somewhere along the

37:43.660 --> 37:47.620
way a lot of them lost me, and I played some here and there, like I get into Halo, you

37:47.620 --> 37:52.420
know, but I gotta say that Doom looked really, really nice, like the graphics, obviously,

37:52.420 --> 37:53.660
were astounding.

37:53.660 --> 37:57.120
It had a lot of that nostalgic feel, like I think you pointed out, oh, the door noise

37:57.120 --> 38:00.620
is the same from the old games, the little elevator and stuff.

38:00.620 --> 38:06.460
But I thought what was really neat about that was the little big planetization of it, with

38:06.460 --> 38:08.900
the, what was it, Snap Map, whatever they called it?

38:08.900 --> 38:12.580
I thought that was the most interesting thing in the entire press conference.

38:12.580 --> 38:16.740
Just the fact that they're opening up all these, you know, abilities for Doom, and the

38:16.740 --> 38:21.940
fact that, okay, so you can have like a classic deathmatch, but you could also do like a Gears

38:21.940 --> 38:25.340
of War, what do they call that, locust mode, or Mass Effect multiplayer?

38:25.340 --> 38:26.340
Yeah, like a horde mode.

38:26.340 --> 38:30.400
Yeah, where it's like, that's what it is, horde mode, where it's like co-op, you versus

38:30.400 --> 38:33.660
all the demons, and you can like design that yourself.

38:33.660 --> 38:38.660
I thought that was, especially if they have it in a way that you can kinda compare how

38:38.660 --> 38:41.940
you do against your friends, and, you know, have things that you're working towards on

38:41.940 --> 38:46.500
the leaderboard, I think that stands to be a really notable concept for me.

38:46.500 --> 38:50.580
So I mean, that I think says a lot about a press conference, when it can take a game

38:50.580 --> 38:55.040
that wasn't really on your radar, or you're feeling very passive, meh, there's a lot of

38:55.040 --> 38:58.720
stuff fighting for my attention right now, and a press conference can put a game on your

38:58.720 --> 39:03.300
radar like that, and I think they did a really good job with that, with Doom.

39:03.300 --> 39:08.020
I gotta admit though, and I'm gonna take a lot of shit for this, but I'm ready for it,

39:08.020 --> 39:13.740
I wasn't grabbed by Fallout 4 in the same way, which I know sounds ludicrous considering

39:13.740 --> 39:19.980
how much is going on in that game, but I just, and I guess when I tried to play Fallout 3

39:19.980 --> 39:22.880
before or whatever, like I just couldn't get into it the same way I can get into a Skyrim

39:22.880 --> 39:27.740
game, and I can't put my finger on what it is that's not drawing me in, I feel like I

39:27.740 --> 39:32.620
will kinda owe it to Fallout 4 to check it out eventually at some point, but I wasn't

39:32.620 --> 39:35.340
like screaming my head off like those people in the audience for November time.

39:35.380 --> 39:40.020
I'm hoping that a Fallout game like Fallout 4 though, the way it seems that you're brought

39:40.020 --> 39:46.260
up in this, you know, Fallout 3, see I never played Fallout 3, and I have Fallout New Vegas

39:46.260 --> 39:50.180
and I tried playing it, but I don't, like the premise to me it seems like that you're

39:50.180 --> 39:54.420
a character already in this world, so you're kinda supposed to be familiar with everything,

39:54.420 --> 39:59.340
whereas this is like, okay you've been, you know, locked in this vault for 200 years,

39:59.340 --> 40:01.060
and you come out and you don't know anything.

40:01.060 --> 40:03.820
You don't know what the hell's going on, and it's great because I don't know what the hell's

40:03.820 --> 40:05.220
going on in the Fallout universe.

40:05.220 --> 40:09.740
Now Bobby's voicing up in our chatroom, and I will reintroduce our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com

40:09.740 --> 40:13.180
reminding us that Fallout New Vegas wasn't really a Bethesda game, so that might not

40:13.180 --> 40:18.100
be the best game to base your judgements on, because that was, they contracted out with

40:18.100 --> 40:21.340
a third party developer to try to keep the series going.

40:21.340 --> 40:27.020
Well I did play Fallout 3, so I'm gonna tell you I'm not sure it is gonna change your opinion.

40:27.020 --> 40:31.340
There are some neat things that the game does, and again I'm not like, I think there's always

40:31.340 --> 40:35.060
these video games, and I do this all the time on OLR, there's a lot of video games

40:35.060 --> 40:36.060
like this.

40:36.060 --> 40:39.260
Before you brand me a hater or cynic or whatever, there's a lot of games where I stand back

40:39.260 --> 40:43.820
and I look at it and I go, I bet that's a really awesome game for other people, and

40:43.820 --> 40:47.500
I see why other people are into it, but eh, I'm not really into it.

40:47.500 --> 40:52.220
Case in point, a lot of sports games for me, it's very rare I really get into a sports

40:52.220 --> 40:55.500
game, but you know, when I see some of the, you know, previews and some of the things

40:55.500 --> 40:59.560
that they do, you know, I understand how other people get into them, it's just, eh, not really

40:59.560 --> 41:00.560
for me.

41:00.560 --> 41:03.520
Honestly, I think Pokemon would be another really good example of that.

41:03.520 --> 41:07.880
I get why people are so into Pokemon, but every time I try to sit down with it, I never

41:07.880 --> 41:11.160
get past the first couple gyms, you know, it's just the way it is.

41:11.160 --> 41:13.840
So, anyway, just my thoughts there.

41:13.840 --> 41:20.160
At least I know Fallout 3 would run okay on my machine, because my machine's crap.

41:20.160 --> 41:21.160
Yeah.

41:21.160 --> 41:24.400
Let's see, so what else did they talk about?

41:24.400 --> 41:29.280
They of course did their little, you know, it's out now mic drop, ceiling opens, hundreds

41:29.280 --> 41:33.000
of mic, no, I guess it wasn't that big of a mic drop moment, but the whole little tablet

41:33.000 --> 41:35.920
game that they were talking about with the Fallout Shelter, which looks really cute,

41:35.920 --> 41:40.560
I'll certainly check that out, if nothing else, I like those tiny tower types of games.

41:40.560 --> 41:44.720
I noticed a little shade thrown at second screen gaming experiences, what'd you think

41:44.720 --> 41:45.720
of that?

41:45.720 --> 41:49.040
He said that a lot of second screen gaming experiences are crap, and I was kinda like,

41:49.040 --> 41:52.920
is that a dig at Wii U, or is that specifically the tablet types of games?

41:52.920 --> 41:58.540
I think he's talking more like, I don't think he's digging at Wii U, I think he's talking

41:58.540 --> 42:05.180
about stuff that Microsoft and PlayStation has as far as second screen stuff.

42:05.180 --> 42:09.460
I don't think he's, you know, it seems like, yeah, and I do have to agree, a lot of it's

42:09.460 --> 42:15.400
been crap, you know, just like, ooh, you have a map, or ooh, you could pick a song or something.

42:15.400 --> 42:18.900
There's a part of me though that gets up there and says, you got a lot of balls criticizing

42:18.900 --> 42:24.980
Nintendo when you just showed that you have a Donkey Kong clone in your little pip game

42:24.980 --> 42:28.420
thing, which looked cute, I mean, don't get me wrong, I just, I was, so yeah, I'm

42:28.420 --> 42:34.060
hoping that he just, you know, he just ran his mouth and was more targeting the tablet

42:34.060 --> 42:37.900
based experiences and not so much maybe, you know, what Nintendo tries to do with the Wii

42:37.900 --> 42:38.900
U.

42:38.900 --> 42:42.140
Well, he clearly isn't talking about Nintendo because they're not getting Fallout, so, you

42:42.140 --> 42:43.140
know.

42:43.140 --> 42:44.140
Yeah.

42:44.140 --> 42:48.460
Maybe they can run Fallout Vault, whatever that is, you know, the iPad game.

42:48.460 --> 42:49.460
Yeah.

42:49.460 --> 42:52.420
Act F agrees that that's more like tablet and mobile stuff.

42:52.420 --> 42:55.620
Fifth Dream in our chat saying, PlayStation 4 doesn't even like, tell you when a game

42:55.620 --> 43:00.620
has second screen except maybe on the back of the box, Vidpower says, to be fair, he

43:00.620 --> 43:06.020
also made it fun of themselves right after, so, there you go.

43:06.020 --> 43:09.060
What do you think about them getting into the trading card game business with the Elder

43:09.060 --> 43:10.060
Scrolls?

43:10.060 --> 43:13.260
Man, I just don't care, it's not a genre that's interested, interesting to me at all, so.

43:13.260 --> 43:16.060
You were hoping for Elder Scrolls Skyrim HD.

43:16.060 --> 43:20.460
Well, they had clips of Skyrim, I, see, I wasn't sure if it was like a retrospective

43:20.460 --> 43:25.140
like here's all these great games that we've made in the past, or here's some clips of

43:25.180 --> 43:28.860
games we're going to be talking about today, you know, that type of thing.

43:28.860 --> 43:32.060
And they had Dishonored, you know, I thought, okay, well, they have Dishonored, then maybe

43:32.060 --> 43:34.500
they're going to have, you know, Skyrim.

43:34.500 --> 43:38.460
Yeah, I mean, we're getting the Dishonored special edition, which is great for people

43:38.460 --> 43:40.900
like me that didn't even check out the game the first time.

43:40.900 --> 43:48.020
Maybe Skyrim thing will come later or something, or maybe it's, you know, I don't know, don't

43:48.020 --> 43:50.460
want to detract from Fallout 4, I guess.

43:50.460 --> 43:53.700
Perhaps, that could be very true as well.

43:53.700 --> 43:54.700
Let's see.

43:55.260 --> 44:00.940
Talking about the limited edition Fallout 4, the little pip device that actually uses

44:00.940 --> 44:02.940
your real smartphone.

44:02.940 --> 44:07.940
I got to say, you know, again, I'm not super into Fallout, but when I saw that, I was like,

44:07.940 --> 44:10.260
all right, that's pretty fucking rad.

44:10.260 --> 44:17.180
Like if I was, you know, more into the series, I'd be like hitting up Amazon, how can I preorder

44:17.180 --> 44:18.180
that right now?

44:18.180 --> 44:19.180
Because that did look pretty badass.

44:19.180 --> 44:24.460
Although, I have to wonder, does that only fit the like fives and sixes, iPhones and

44:24.460 --> 44:25.460
the smaller androids?

44:25.460 --> 44:26.460
Because I got a six plus.

44:26.460 --> 44:27.460
Is that going to fit?

44:27.460 --> 44:28.460
It's supposed to fit all phones.

44:28.460 --> 44:29.460
All right, I hope so.

44:29.460 --> 44:30.460
I mean, it doesn't matter.

44:30.460 --> 44:33.780
I'm not going to really end up getting one, because I think it's going to be easily $100,

44:33.780 --> 44:34.780
but...

44:34.780 --> 44:37.540
Oh, well, just $100?

44:37.540 --> 44:38.540
At least, at least.

44:38.540 --> 44:39.540
I'm talking three digits.

44:39.540 --> 44:41.700
That's probably like, I'm guessing that's like $200 right there.

44:41.700 --> 44:43.780
Well, it's just a shell for your smartphone.

44:43.780 --> 44:45.900
It's not an actual, you know...

44:45.900 --> 44:47.100
Yeah, I understand that.

44:47.100 --> 44:49.980
I understand it's just a shell or a statue or whatever.

44:49.980 --> 44:53.120
They have that type of stuff, but those are expensive.

44:53.120 --> 44:57.840
Just like what, Titanfall had a fucking statue in that shit, and it was fucking expensive.

44:57.840 --> 44:58.840
I don't know.

44:58.840 --> 44:59.840
I just expected the expensive.

44:59.840 --> 45:00.840
All right.

45:00.840 --> 45:04.600
Well, we'll get all your guys' thoughts on the Bethesda press conference just a little

45:04.600 --> 45:05.600
later.

45:05.600 --> 45:08.080
For now, though, we want to just touch on a few stories that...

45:08.080 --> 45:09.920
I may have to buy Fallout 3.

45:09.920 --> 45:11.880
I have been buying lots of stuff on Steam sale.

45:11.880 --> 45:12.880
You know what?

45:12.880 --> 45:16.040
There is a Steam sale going on right now, as you know about, for sure, and maybe now

45:16.040 --> 45:17.980
is the great time to pick up Fallout 3.

45:17.980 --> 45:21.360
You know, we didn't talk about our gaming weeks, because we've had no time, but I don't

45:21.360 --> 45:24.040
know about you, but I succumbed to that Steam sale.

45:24.040 --> 45:27.760
I bought Cities Skyline, which is that...

45:27.760 --> 45:33.540
This is the game that SimCity should've been, but I've played maybe 15 minutes of it, so

45:33.540 --> 45:37.760
I'm not in any position to tell you about the game, but I definitely see, like, wow,

45:37.760 --> 45:39.520
there's some strong SimCity parallels here.

45:39.520 --> 45:44.360
I bought some stuff for my son to play with me with.

45:44.360 --> 45:49.240
So I bought Lego Batman 2, because, you know, I've been talking to him about that, because

45:49.240 --> 45:51.080
he's kind of getting bored of Lego Marvel superheroes.

45:51.080 --> 45:55.320
We beat it, like, a long time ago, and, you know, this game is similar to that, because

45:55.320 --> 45:59.520
it has an open world and everything, so I bought that for him and for me to play.

45:59.520 --> 46:03.440
And then I also bought Lego Movie, the video game, because we watched part of the Lego

46:03.440 --> 46:07.320
Movie, and I like the movie, and it's awesome, and the game's, like, five bucks, so I was

46:07.320 --> 46:08.320
like, you know, whatever.

46:08.320 --> 46:10.120
And then I bought some other stuff, too.

46:10.120 --> 46:11.120
I've been...

46:11.120 --> 46:13.680
You know what I've been playing a lot of?

46:13.680 --> 46:14.680
I know.

46:14.680 --> 46:15.680
Shocking.

46:15.680 --> 46:18.040
I've been, like, playing a lot of their clicker game on there.

46:18.280 --> 46:20.720
Oh, their little, um, for the sale?

46:20.720 --> 46:21.720
The clicker game for the sale?

46:21.720 --> 46:23.400
Yeah, I've been playing that a lot.

46:23.400 --> 46:24.400
It's a little laggy.

46:24.400 --> 46:28.320
Like, I love the concept of a thousand people all playing it at once, but, like, I notice

46:28.320 --> 46:30.640
I'll click something, and all of a sudden, the health bar's like, whoo!

46:30.640 --> 46:35.240
Like, it's got some technical challenges, but it was a clever little thing for a sale.

46:35.240 --> 46:36.240
I gotta say.

46:36.240 --> 46:37.240
I'm trying to think of whatever else I bought.

46:37.240 --> 46:43.520
I mean, I actually have to literally look at my stupid list here of what I bought.

46:43.520 --> 46:51.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

46:51.000 --> 46:53.840
use the passphrase, net.

46:53.840 --> 46:54.840
I don't know.

46:54.840 --> 46:56.400
I bought a few other things, too.

46:56.400 --> 46:58.880
Oh, Castle Crashers, because that was dirt cheap.

46:58.880 --> 47:05.640
I bought that, and then, what else did I buy?

47:05.640 --> 47:06.640
I don't remember.

47:06.640 --> 47:11.040
But, yeah, I know I bought the two LEGO games, because, I don't know, they're kind of addicti-

47:11.040 --> 47:16.640
Oh, Command & Conquer Red Alert 3, because I love Command & Conquer Red Alert, and that

47:16.640 --> 47:17.760
was pretty cheap.

47:17.760 --> 47:23.640
And they had, you know, was it that ten-level, four-level thing that came from that Humble

47:23.640 --> 47:29.120
Bundle with EA, and I just wanted the full game, so I was like, okay, I'll do it.

47:29.120 --> 47:31.440
More comments from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

47:31.440 --> 47:36.120
Kaijuto says, Bethesda may have just won E3, that was so freakin' good.

47:36.120 --> 47:39.520
Dungeon Buster saying, Fallout 3 is good, just be sure to get it with all the DLCs since

47:39.520 --> 47:42.120
one of those actually gives you a real ending.

47:42.120 --> 47:46.440
VidPower in chat says, I'm ashamed to admit that I've never played any Fallout games.

47:46.440 --> 47:47.820
Don't be afraid to admit that.

47:47.820 --> 47:52.120
It's like me coming out and being afraid to say, I don't have the same feelings the rest

47:52.120 --> 47:53.120
of you do to it.

47:53.120 --> 47:57.360
I never played through Oblivion all the way, or at least, if I did, actually I may have,

47:57.360 --> 47:59.320
it was a long time ago.

47:59.320 --> 48:04.820
There is no time to play every single, unless you're getting paid to do it, there is not

48:04.820 --> 48:08.200
enough time to play every single critically lauded game start to finish.

48:08.200 --> 48:11.160
I would even think, even if you are paid to do it, there's just not enough hours in

48:11.160 --> 48:14.560
the day if you're exploring every nook and cranny of every critically lauded game.

48:14.560 --> 48:16.800
So you do have to pick and choose a little bit.

48:16.800 --> 48:20.880
And if you play any MMOs, then that just cuts your hours even more.

48:20.880 --> 48:24.640
I'm gonna wait and see if this gets on sale even more, because it's only 40 or 50% off

48:24.640 --> 48:26.720
right now, so.

48:26.720 --> 48:32.560
MegamanX400 in chat says, we can't call E3 winners yet.

48:32.560 --> 48:35.200
Let's put it this way, they've started off pretty strong.

48:35.200 --> 48:36.200
Stop it!

48:36.200 --> 48:39.960
I mean, this was definitely better than the Oculus little thing, but.

48:39.960 --> 48:42.320
This was the best E3 Sunday ever.

48:42.320 --> 48:47.640
In fact, this is the first E3 Sunday ever, but between the Nintendo stuff this morning

48:47.640 --> 48:48.640
and Bethesda.

48:48.640 --> 48:53.000
Well, let's put it this way, they have, you know, I'm expecting great things from Microsoft

48:53.000 --> 49:00.680
and from EA, okay, maybe not so much from EA, but Microsoft and, you know, Sony, Nintendo,

49:00.680 --> 49:03.260
I'm expecting great things from them, so hopefully we'll see that.

49:03.260 --> 49:08.780
And Ubisoft, Ubisoft has been rocking it, like, each year, it seems like, so I'm looking

49:08.780 --> 49:11.900
forward to having some great announcements from them as well.

49:11.900 --> 49:16.420
However, I mean, Watch Dogs was kind of a letdown, although, I can't even really say

49:16.420 --> 49:19.780
that, you know what, it sounded like a letdown, I have to fucking give myself, I haven't played

49:19.780 --> 49:22.300
it yet, so I don't know.

49:22.300 --> 49:26.780
But like, I'm not as excited, like, about Watch Dogs, or I wasn't as excited about the

49:26.780 --> 49:32.500
crew at, when originally those sounded really awesome, and I don't really give a shit about

49:32.540 --> 49:35.780
their Tom Clancy game that they have coming, well, both Tom Clancy games that they have

49:35.780 --> 49:41.060
coming out, I just don't care about those, so I don't know.

49:41.060 --> 49:45.460
And I'm sure we'll see another fucking Just Dance game, it's just gonna be, whatever.

49:45.460 --> 49:49.320
Bobby's reminding me in chat that Connect had that big event during OLR a few years

49:49.320 --> 49:53.420
ago, hashtag space ponchos, that's right, because then they do it twice, they did it

49:53.420 --> 49:57.420
twice, it was weird that year, they did one on Sunday and one on Monday, and like, it

49:57.420 --> 50:02.100
was like a repeat, I don't know, anyway, so I guess it wasn't the first E3 Sunday ever,

50:02.100 --> 50:04.700
but the first in a long time, okay?

50:04.700 --> 50:05.700
Calm down.

50:05.700 --> 50:11.620
Alright, so it's gonna be a fun week, it is gonna be a fun week, and I'm sad I have to

50:11.620 --> 50:16.200
work tomorrow, I gotta pay the bills, I gotta pay the bills, but I'll be looking for my

50:16.200 --> 50:20.700
bullet point list of what I missed at Microsoft and what trailers I have to view, and then

50:20.700 --> 50:25.300
whatever fucking Mass Effect came out, give me the Mass Effect, get it all right now.

50:25.300 --> 50:29.440
I will be watching the live blogs because I have to take phone calls so I can't actually

50:29.440 --> 50:35.480
stream it like I used to, whereas at work, you know, previous employers, that was considered

50:35.480 --> 50:40.320
part of my job, so I would literally get up from my desk, go to a conference room and

50:40.320 --> 50:46.200
stream that shit on a big fucking TV, because I made the excuse for myself to do that, because

50:46.200 --> 50:49.840
my boss wasn't there anyways, because he'd be at E3, and I'd be like, no one's gonna

50:49.840 --> 50:50.840
tell me not to.

50:50.840 --> 50:54.960
But I like that Sony is at night, because then I can come home and watch the Sony thing

50:54.960 --> 50:58.240
on my PS4 and it'll be just fine.

50:58.240 --> 51:01.680
And there's always YouTube later, and a lot of times, you know, you're just really watching

51:01.680 --> 51:05.840
for trailers and gameplay video and stuff, I mean, and that's all gonna be up later on,

51:05.840 --> 51:06.840
so it's not a big deal.

51:06.840 --> 51:10.400
I hope the PlayStation thing isn't like three hours long this year, they had a long show

51:10.400 --> 51:15.080
last year, and it was different when you're there, it doesn't seem to crawl as much, but

51:15.080 --> 51:17.600
when you're not there, it can drag.

51:17.600 --> 51:24.600
All I ask is if they don't waste time on things, like, keep your gameplay demos somewhat short,

51:24.600 --> 51:30.000
like even Doom 1 seemed kinda long, I understand why, I mean, they're teasing each other's

51:30.000 --> 51:35.800
weapons and stuff, but it seemed long, and I just, I hope that, you know, they kinda

51:35.800 --> 51:38.200
shorten that stuff down a bit.

51:38.200 --> 51:43.440
Like Nintendo, especially Nintendo, we don't need you to explain how the gameplay elements

51:43.440 --> 51:45.860
work and stuff, just show us the fucking gameplay.

51:45.860 --> 51:50.200
If you wanna explain how that shit works, you can save that for the fucking Nintendo

51:50.200 --> 51:51.600
treehouse shit.

51:51.600 --> 51:55.880
Alright, let's move on, let's try to cover some of the other news that's come up in the

51:55.880 --> 51:59.720
past week, we're gonna improvise a little bit here, cuz Loki and I are pretty much having

51:59.720 --> 52:03.880
to make up a show as we go tonight, with Dark Sakura having left, and we lost an hour we

52:03.880 --> 52:08.920
thought we'd have, so, since you brought up Steam, I'll talk about this with Valve, and

52:08.920 --> 52:12.480
then Loki, I know you had a Valve marked thing, maybe you wanna bring that up, I don't know,

52:12.480 --> 52:15.680
but I wanna talk about this because, you know, with the Steam sale going on, there's a little

52:15.680 --> 52:20.400
bit of controversy going on with that, that apparently some developers and publishers

52:20.400 --> 52:23.360
are hiking up their prices.

52:23.360 --> 52:28.840
In fact, Bethesda being called out as one of them, that Wolfenstein The New Order apparently

52:28.840 --> 52:37.240
was hiked up from $45 to $60, then went on sale half off for $30.

52:37.240 --> 52:44.160
It's not just Bethesda, Ubisoft took Assassin's Creed Black Flag from $29.99 to $39.99, and

52:44.160 --> 52:48.620
then there was a 40% off sale, so it goes down to $23.99.

52:48.660 --> 52:55.000
And then, Grand Theft Auto 5 also being pointed out because what they did, they jacked up

52:55.000 --> 53:02.140
the price of the game to $80, but they did it with a card, they gave you consumables.

53:02.140 --> 53:08.060
All they're doing is, well, a couple things, they're putting it out with one of their stupid

53:08.060 --> 53:16.020
shark cards, so basically what they're doing is giving you a free DLC or free in-game item,

53:16.060 --> 53:20.580
money in the game, but the game's still the same price as it normally is because they

53:20.580 --> 53:23.420
can do that, it's digital goods, it doesn't cost them anything.

53:23.420 --> 53:24.420
So really, that's what they're doing.

53:24.420 --> 53:26.940
So it's not really a discount.

53:26.940 --> 53:31.420
The other thing, though, that someone was saying, and I'm not really sure how the details

53:31.420 --> 53:35.780
work on this, but they were saying that because of the fact that it's put out there with a

53:35.780 --> 53:43.980
piece of consumable, an in-app purchase, if you will, you can't refund the game, per the

53:43.980 --> 53:46.460
Steam rules.

53:46.460 --> 53:50.540
I'm not sure if that's the case, but then also I come up to the conclusion of, why would

53:50.540 --> 53:51.540
you want to do that?

53:51.540 --> 53:56.740
Because it's Grand Theft Auto 5 and it's amazing, there's no reason why you would need to return

53:56.740 --> 53:58.740
the game, it is amazing.

53:58.740 --> 54:03.540
Well there you go, so some people kind of push in those Steam, I mean, there's nothing

54:03.540 --> 54:07.900
wrong with what they're doing, and technically in retail a lot of this stuff happens too,

54:07.900 --> 54:08.900
is that, you know...

54:08.900 --> 54:14.980
I think they forget that there are websites that do track the price changes, and people

54:14.980 --> 54:17.940
are going to catch on to your shit.

54:17.940 --> 54:18.940
Just be honest with it.

54:18.940 --> 54:23.700
I mean, if you're going to mark it down 10%, mark it down 10%, a la Witcher 3.

54:23.700 --> 54:26.260
At least they were pretty honest with it.

54:26.260 --> 54:31.940
Hey, I'll take a 10% discount versus you jacking the price up and making it seem like it's

54:31.940 --> 54:38.540
more of a discount, because I'll be like, wait a second, wasn't this just $44 last week?

54:38.540 --> 54:40.540
I mean, I don't know.

54:40.540 --> 54:46.500
Alright, did you want to talk about maybe the Dota 2 thing, since that's also Valve?

54:46.500 --> 54:53.820
Sure, so they're going to have Dota 2 Reborn, I guess they're going to make it easier to

54:53.820 --> 55:01.900
play the game, and it's going to be a new client for Dota 2, and they're going to allow

55:01.900 --> 55:07.500
people to spectate Dota 2 a little bit easier as well as play it even easier.

55:07.500 --> 55:13.820
And they're going to have some new features to Dota TV, including new DVR-style pause

55:13.820 --> 55:26.260
and rewind, also broadcasting in 1080p 60fps streams, and I guess they're saying they're

55:26.260 --> 55:28.620
upgrading their chat room.

55:28.620 --> 55:34.060
So basically trying to up the quote-unquote quality of their MOBA that's really not even

55:34.060 --> 55:38.340
that old anyway, but I always thought they had a pretty good tutorial in that game, but

55:38.340 --> 55:41.780
there's a lot more micromanaging that happens in Dota compared to a game like Heroes of

55:41.780 --> 55:42.780
the Storm.

55:42.780 --> 55:49.980
New tutorials, and they're saying guided bot matches.

55:49.980 --> 55:51.860
But then there's something else with that, right?

55:51.860 --> 55:56.460
All our fascinations with Gabe walking out on stage and dropping the mic, not going to

55:56.460 --> 55:57.460
happen, right?

55:57.460 --> 56:02.220
No, I don't believe that's going to be the case.

56:02.220 --> 56:08.980
Just because they're saying they're not taking meetings for any upcoming products is what

56:08.980 --> 56:10.140
they said.

56:10.140 --> 56:11.140
So they're like...

56:11.140 --> 56:12.140
That doesn't fucking mean anything.

56:12.140 --> 56:13.140
They're not at E3.

56:13.140 --> 56:17.540
We don't need to fucking meet with you people to talk about Half-Life 3, okay?

56:17.540 --> 56:21.580
I thought he was supposed to be there though at the PC gaming thing, I thought Valve was

56:21.580 --> 56:22.580
part of that.

56:22.580 --> 56:23.580
I thought so too, but I don't know.

56:23.580 --> 56:24.840
So who gives a shit?

56:24.840 --> 56:29.780
You don't need to fucking take meetings for that stuff, you could arrange that shit later

56:29.780 --> 56:30.780
on.

56:30.780 --> 56:31.780
And I think it's probably...

56:31.780 --> 56:33.260
I mean, come on.

56:33.260 --> 56:34.260
Come on.

56:34.260 --> 56:37.660
You can't tell me that if they were going to be taking meetings for some upcoming products

56:37.660 --> 56:40.460
that that shit wouldn't leak out in a heartbeat.

56:40.460 --> 56:45.500
I mean, it's like, yeah, hey guys, we're taking meetings for Half-Life 3.

56:45.500 --> 56:48.920
No, you can't tell me that won't leak out.

56:48.920 --> 56:51.300
No one is not breaking the NDA on that shit.

56:51.300 --> 56:55.060
You get the exclusive story that Half-Life 3 is fucking confirmed.

56:55.060 --> 56:56.620
I mean, come on.

56:56.620 --> 56:57.620
That is why.

56:58.180 --> 57:01.620
I would completely distrust any of the journalists out there with that shit.

57:01.620 --> 57:03.700
So I don't expect them to...

57:03.700 --> 57:06.220
I don't think that this necessarily means anything.

57:06.220 --> 57:11.140
I think it's just, yeah, they're not going to have a booth there.

57:11.140 --> 57:16.480
They're not going to be taking press meetings about their games, but it doesn't mean they

57:16.480 --> 57:17.980
won't announce anything.

57:19.100 --> 57:20.100
All right.

57:20.820 --> 57:23.180
Well, let's move on.

57:23.180 --> 57:27.580
I guess we'll do a couple more stories and I think we'll open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAMO-LR.

57:27.580 --> 57:30.140
Or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

57:30.140 --> 57:33.180
So Loki, you want to just pick one other story you think is worth mentioning here?

57:33.180 --> 57:34.180
Sure.

57:34.180 --> 57:36.100
Let's talk about amiibos some more.

57:36.100 --> 57:42.900
And this is actually from one of the executives that's in charge of the team that produces

57:42.900 --> 57:47.660
Disney Infinity, John Viganocci.

57:47.660 --> 57:51.940
He's basically saying this whole shortage of bullshit is ridiculous.

57:52.940 --> 57:55.860
You know, they're saying it...

57:55.860 --> 57:58.820
This is, I guess, part of an interview that they had with Game Informer.

57:58.820 --> 58:03.200
It is, given the turbulent release of amiibo characters, are you doing anything to prepare

58:03.200 --> 58:05.700
for the high demand of Star Wars figures?

58:05.700 --> 58:10.340
And he replied, there is never an intention to create a shortage of any figures.

58:10.340 --> 58:13.980
It isn't irresponsible and rude to your hardcore fans.

58:13.980 --> 58:16.680
They don't want to create frustration or the hunt.

58:16.680 --> 58:19.100
So they will be stocking the shelves well.

58:19.100 --> 58:25.740
And I gotta say, from my experience with dealing with retailers and stuff, Disney was

58:25.740 --> 58:31.460
probably the easiest when it came to ordering this kind of bullshit.

58:31.460 --> 58:32.740
And I'll tell you why.

58:32.740 --> 58:38.940
And it's because, previously, before this whole amiibo stuff was happening, it was Skylanders

58:38.940 --> 58:40.820
and fucking Disney Infinity.

58:40.820 --> 58:47.180
And Skylanders, well, the way they create shortages is it's all fucking random.

58:47.180 --> 58:51.500
So you can't order specific, like, if I'm out of this specific character, I can't fucking

58:51.500 --> 58:54.100
order that specific character from Activision.

58:54.100 --> 58:57.460
I just have to order some of these, I just have to order some of these single character

58:57.460 --> 59:00.420
packs and hope to God that I get what I'm looking for.

59:00.420 --> 59:01.760
Or I can get a bunch of fucking comps.

59:01.760 --> 59:04.380
It's literally blind packs, which is ridiculous.

59:04.380 --> 59:08.860
And I think that is how a lot of the toy industry works, but Disney's not like that.

59:08.860 --> 59:13.620
You're out of fucking Mickey, you order Mickey, you get Mickey, that's it, done.

59:13.620 --> 59:19.540
The only bullshit that they have, and to be honest, all three of these Disney, Nintendo,

59:19.540 --> 59:22.900
and Activision do this shit, is the fucking retailer exclusives.

59:22.900 --> 59:25.740
And that's about it, and it's time with this shit.

59:25.740 --> 59:30.820
So they're all kind of on an even playing field there, but yeah.

59:30.820 --> 59:34.940
Disney knows how to fucking manufacture toys, and this isn't new for them, that's why they

59:34.940 --> 59:40.380
have a better handle on it than Activision and Nintendo, who just kind of got into this

59:40.380 --> 59:41.380
industry.

59:41.380 --> 59:42.380
Yeah.

59:42.380 --> 59:43.380
And this is their own retail.

59:43.380 --> 59:46.060
I mean, Disney has stores in the mall, Disneyland, Disney World.

59:46.060 --> 59:47.820
Yeah, they fucking know how to manufacture toys.

59:47.820 --> 59:52.460
This is like, yeah, we've been manufacturing toys for a long time now, and Nintendo and

59:52.460 --> 59:55.740
fucking Activision are just getting into this shit.

59:55.740 --> 01:00:00.040
They're only a few years old into it, Nintendo even less than that, and so that's why they're

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:02.220
having all this hiccup shit.

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:07.180
It's because, I don't know where exactly they manufacture half this stuff for Disney, but

01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:11.180
I'm pretty sure that they know how to make sure that stuff is in stores.

01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:16.820
Now, don't get me wrong, they're not immune to shortages, but they're usually quick to

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:18.820
recover from it.

01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:22.340
ActDeft in chat over at live.vognetwork.com saying, a reasoning behind why Disney can

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:26.520
put any Disney Infinity figurine is that they have the shitload of money to do so.

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:29.980
Not to mention, they're probably really easy and cheap to produce.

01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:33.460
Rama saying that Disney doesn't run their retail stores, the Children's Place runs all

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:34.460
the Disney stores.

01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:40.220
And I would still argue, when it's carrying Disney's name, there's probably some different

01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:43.100
relationships than you would see elsewhere in the industry.

01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:45.860
But that's a fair point, anyway.

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:49.100
So anyhow, let's see.

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:52.480
I'm going to do a quick story here about Street Fighter V, which is going to get a lot of

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:55.500
attention at E3 in this coming week, I'm sure.

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:59.140
Sure this will be a big deal at Capcom's booth for people that are there.

01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:05.420
Street Fighter V, of course, coming to PlayStation 4 and PC, but not going to be coming to Xbox

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:06.420
One.

01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:09.820
Now, there's been a lot of us saying, oh, sure, Street Fighter V doesn't come to Xbox

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:13.460
One, but Super Street Fighter V, or Street Fighter V Turbo, or Street Fighter V Special

01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:18.380
Edition, Street Fighter V Part II, whatever you want to call it, the inevitable will come

01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:19.820
out for Xbox One.

01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:24.700
But based on some comments this week that a Capcom representative said to GameSpot,

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:25.700
maybe not.

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:28.740
Quote, the reality is that this is a real partnership.

01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:33.300
We are console exclusive for this franchise, for this numbered run.

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:36.580
The relationship with Sony does open doors for things we haven't been able to do in the

01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:37.580
past.

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:41.420
The relationship serves as a gameplay and development purpose and not just a marketing

01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:42.420
value.

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:48.100
Hmm, I wonder if this is Capcom really holding firm on this whole Microsoft, you fucking

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:50.900
did this to yourself when you wouldn't allow cross play.

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:56.820
So you know, and I have to admit, the no cross play thing on Microsoft, I don't think is

01:01:56.820 --> 01:01:57.820
doing him any favors.

01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:02.200
I think as far as Elder Scrolls Online, since we just watched Bethesda go, I think that

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:06.340
really sucks that it's separated for Xbox One and PlayStation.

01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:11.340
Now granted, I get that even if it's separate from PlayStation and PC, yes, it is.

01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:15.420
They're all separated, which I was probably a Bethesda decision since one had to be separated

01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:16.980
that I'll be separated.

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:21.300
But I can see also that the voice chat thing would lend some complications.

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:25.420
Like you wouldn't be able to have voice chat across Xbox One and PlayStation.

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:28.020
So I get you might have some other difficulties there.

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:33.100
But if these other MMOs like Final Fantasy 11, Final Fantasy 14, if they can do it, you

01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:36.100
know, I don't see why Elder Scrolls Online couldn't do it.

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:40.620
So I just think I think Microsoft really needs to reevaluate that policy.

01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:42.780
But you know, whatever.

01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:45.740
This is this is what it's it's coming to.

01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:46.920
So we'll see.

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:51.460
And Sony and Nintendo apparently allowed cross play between their consoles with some game.

01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:58.460
I don't remember what game that was, where Sony and Nintendo actually worked together

01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:00.900
between the two.

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:03.100
What was it?

01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:11.900
I guess it was pure chess is the game they're calling out of all things interesting.

01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:14.220
The one game that no one bought.

01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:15.360
Yeah, right.

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:20.060
So anyhow, so but I wouldn't expect Street Fighter five on the Wii U anytime soon.

01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:21.060
Just saying.

01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:22.060
Let's do it.

01:03:22.060 --> 01:03:26.380
Let's open up the Skype line 1877 game OLR or username on Skype orange lounge radio.

01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:29.500
If you want to give us a call, we'll talk about whatever you might want to say about

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:34.600
Bethesda's press thing or any general E3 thoughts, things you might be looking forward

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.340
to in this next week.

01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:41.520
I apologize due to the time tonight, I'm going to have to cut out a few of our regular segments.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:43.780
No rapid fire news, no.

01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:45.060
I'm actually going to skip foogle.

01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:46.060
I apologize.

01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:50.780
I know a lot of you guys answered on Facebook and Google Plus this week, but just incentive

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:53.940
to go check those community communities out if you're not already on them.

01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:58.700
Facebook dot com slash orange lounge radio and Google dot com slash plus orange lounge

01:03:58.700 --> 01:03:59.700
radio.

01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:01.260
And if you're mad, well, be mad at Nintendo.

01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:05.700
They ran in 30 minutes over tonight than they were supposed to finish.

01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:11.580
So again, the Skype line is open 1877 game OLR or username on Skype orange lounge radio.

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:16.220
Loki, you want to pull one of these other stories here while we wait for a call?

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:17.220
Sure.

01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:21.260
So apparently Metal Gear Solid five is going to have some sort of microtransactions.

01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:25.060
They're basically calling them optional game purchases.

01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:29.980
And some of the examples they're saying may include the ability to create your own emblem

01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:31.820
in the game.

01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:36.980
So not necessarily anything that's going to, you know, help you win the game and just,

01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:39.500
you know, customization stuff.

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:40.500
Hmm.

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:41.500
Gotcha.

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:45.380
I see maybe more like decoys, maybe still they're going down that path.

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:46.440
Well, it's Konami.

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:47.440
They're going down that.

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:48.440
Well, what's Konami got now?

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:49.440
Let's go to the phones.

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:50.440
Hi.

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:51.440
You're on orange lounge radio.

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:52.440
Who's this?

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:53.440
Hi.

01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:54.440
This is Reginator.

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:57.560
What's on your mind tonight?

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:58.560
Not too much.

01:04:58.560 --> 01:04:59.560
Yeah.

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:05.400
Just to touch on the sales that have been going on.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:12.920
I just want to get your overall opinion on both the GOG sale and the Steam sale.

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:16.520
What are your general feelings and thoughts about those sales?

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:19.440
Well, who doesn't love a sale, dammit?

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:21.600
I'm excited to see the sales on both sides.

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:24.800
I did actually end up participating in the GOG sale myself.

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:31.000
I bought an old-school PC game that I remember playing the shit out of when I first got a

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.520
CD-ROM in my computer.

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:36.440
And the game is called Castles 2.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:40.160
And it was on GOG, and it was even on sale for like, I don't know, four bucks.

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:43.520
It's actually the CD-ROM version that you download, and so it actually has some of the

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:46.320
little cheesy CD-ROM movies and things in it.

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:50.080
So I thought that was really cool, and I bought that, and then that gave me the free SimCity

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.600
2000, which I thought was a nice little bonus.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:54.680
So I participated in that sale.

01:05:54.680 --> 01:06:00.800
And then I think I mentioned over on Steam, I bought the Cities Skyline, and that was

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:03.080
on sale from 30 bucks to 20 bucks, I think.

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:06.760
So I haven't been able to play a whole lot of that, but I'm encouraged by what I see

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:07.760
so far.

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:11.520
So I participate in both those sales, keeping my eye on Humble Bundle, too, because they've

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:13.160
got a lot of sales going on.

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:19.540
So E3 is video game Christmas for a lot of people, so there's going to be a lot of sales

01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:22.460
to match that as well.

01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:25.020
I think the other thing, too, is that Steam minigame.

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:29.980
I think it's been a while since we've seen Steam do something a little extra for a sale,

01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:31.860
beyond just the trading card thing.

01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:36.220
Like I feel like we haven't gotten a little something extra extra during a sale in a while,

01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:41.420
so even though the game, the clicker game is a little bit, eh, buggy, I applaud them

01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:42.980
for trying to do something a little different.

01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:45.140
Played 120 levels of it the other day.

01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:46.140
Oh my god.

01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:51.100
I got in right at 9 a.m. yesterday, right, and I must have gotten some game with some

01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:56.080
uber players, because by the end of the day, or by the time it was over, I was on level

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:57.080
like 1,758.

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:59.900
It was something crazy.

01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:00.900
So yeah.

01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:03.380
It sucks that they reset your stats, though, each time.

01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:07.940
Yeah, but it seems like you get the trading card, you get one trading card for just checking

01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:13.560
it out, and then you get another for, I guess, playing it for maybe 20 minutes or something.

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:16.320
So you can get a lot of cards that way.

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:22.520
Brak, the man in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says Steam will never top that potato ARG

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:23.640
for Portal 2.

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:24.640
That was pretty amazing.

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:27.960
That was the one that, wasn't that the one that culminated in the early release of the

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:29.000
game on Steam or something like that?

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:35.320
It did, because you had to like play different games that had Portal stuff in it, and had

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:40.080
a potato stuff, and I guess playing those games would help count down the timer or something

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:42.480
like that, and it would release it earlier.

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:49.400
So, RageNator, you mentioned you hadn't bought anything in the Steam sale yet.

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:50.400
Is there a reason for that?

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.280
Is there something you're waiting for?

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:54.280
What's your thoughts on the Steam sale?

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:59.720
Well, I kind of blew my load, financially speaking, on the GOG sale.

01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:00.720
Ew.

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:01.720
Okay.

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:02.720
All right.

01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:03.720
Fair enough.

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:09.280
Yeah, I kind of went nuts on the GOG sale.

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:13.840
I bought a little bit too much, or a little bit more than I should have.

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.000
He meant the load of cash in his bank account, everybody.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
That's what he meant.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
He meant a load of cash, everybody.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Yeah.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Yeah.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:30.160
Including the free games I meant to get through there, I got like 30 games through the GOG

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:31.160
sale.

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:32.160
Wow.

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:38.360
Well, you're not even checking out the clicker heroes inspired minigame on Steam, getting

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:41.280
your cards or whatever, or nah, not for you?

01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:48.640
I tried to, but I couldn't get into it, so I kind of assumed that the way the game was

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:54.840
explained to me, you hit the craft badge first, then get into the game, collect more cards.

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:56.380
No, you don't need the badge first.

01:08:56.380 --> 01:08:57.380
You can get in there.

01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:00.040
If it doesn't work for you, try to join a friend's game.

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:03.440
That was the only way I was able to get it to work the first time, is I joined a friend's

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:07.600
game instead of doing my own game, and then it worked for some reason, so keep hammering

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:08.600
at it.

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:09.600
Yeah.

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:10.600
You're right.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:19.840
Yeah, no, in regards to the Steam sale, might be able to buy something once they, you know,

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:23.200
will have to be like dirt cheap, like under $10, so.

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.360
Well, there's a lot of indie stuff.

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:28.320
Keep your eye out, because there's a lot of indie games that are coming down to like two

01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:34.440
or three bucks, because especially the stuff that's rewards from people's participation

01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:37.960
in the clicky game, that's pretty much nothing but indie stuff.

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:42.960
I've seen a few AAA games in there, but mostly indie stuff, so, and those get really, really

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:43.960
cheap.

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:44.960
Raise your hand.

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:45.960
I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls.

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:46.960
All right, buddy?

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:47.960
Thanks for calling in, though.

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:48.960
Sure.

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:49.960
Take care.

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:50.960
Have a nice night.

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:51.960
Bye.

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:52.960
Bye-bye.

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:53.960
1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:54.960
Our username on Skype.

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:55.960
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:57.960
Loki, you want to pull another one of these, or?

01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:58.960
Sure.

01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:02.600
You know, it's kind of funny, looking at this, like, recommended list from Steam about games

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:06.480
I should buy, and most of them are saying in-library.

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:07.940
I have a problem.

01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:08.940
You have a big problem.

01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:09.940
I have a problem.

01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:11.760
We actually have another call coming in right now, so let's get to it.

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:12.760
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:13.760
Who's this?

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:14.760
Hey, this is Akdeaf.

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:15.760
Hey, Akdeaf, buddy.

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:16.760
What's on your mind?

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:18.360
Well, let's talk about the usual.

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:20.000
I talk about Amiibos.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.880
That's the main thing now.

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:22.880
That's your thing now.

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:27.640
I was going to say, I saw, I did happen to catch, was that they showed off what Ryu looks

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:29.840
like when Kirby sucks him up.

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:30.840
Oh, yeah.

01:10:30.840 --> 01:10:31.840
I love the hair.

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:36.600
Yeah, I got the DLC today, and yeah, that's pretty awesome.

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:39.080
In Dreamland 64, that's pretty awesome.

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:41.400
Did you see my sexy picture on Twitter?

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:44.280
Shout out to my Twitter, at SKIE, Sky on Twitter.

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:46.480
You see my sexy picture with my new NES Amiibo?

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:48.800
Oh, no, I didn't see it.

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:52.340
Oh, you gotta go back to my, I got my NES Amiibo from Japan.

01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:57.240
One of the three that I have coming, because, here's the hilarious part.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:03.240
Alan bought me one for a birthday gift, and I didn't know that he did that.

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:06.120
He bought from some import thing, I don't know.

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:12.480
When Play Asia had the Japanese ones go up, both Shane and I were on there, and we both

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:13.480
bought one.

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:16.920
We were just like, I don't know, I just didn't trust that even if Shane would get one, that

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:20.760
he would actually get one, because people cancel pre-orders all the time, right?

01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.120
So I was like, we need to buy two.

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:24.200
So he bought one, and I bought one.

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:26.640
Now I have three NES Amiibo coming from Japan.

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:29.840
Shane told me he's just gonna keep the one that he gets, but I'm still gonna have an

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:35.240
extra one, so I'm deciding, am I gonna hang onto it to try to trade for something else,

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:40.640
or maybe, maybe I'll do a giveaway.

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:41.640
We'll see.

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:42.640
Hmm.

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:43.640
That's nice.

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:45.040
More to come on that.

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:49.460
I would think people might be motivated for a NES Amiibo of all things.

01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:52.040
Those things are region-free, but I don't know, I don't wanna get too ahead of myself,

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:53.040
I don't know.

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:55.040
Anyway, what'd you wanna say about Amiibos?

01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:04.120
Well, first thing, I helped organize an Amiibo tournament yesterday, so I got to see, like,

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:07.520
three people with the NES Amiibo, sorry.

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:09.520
So yeah, at least I got to see it now.

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:17.960
Hopefully I can get mine soon, too, but aside from that, you know how we're always complaining

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:21.760
about Nintendo and not producing enough Amiibos?

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:22.920
Yeah.

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:31.600
So apparently, some of the CPSI certificates of compliance got updated recently.

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:39.560
Some of the Amiibos that appear in this update are Jigglypuff, Charizard, Ness, Lucario,

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:46.880
Rosalina and Luma, Captain Falcon, Pit, Fox, Whiffit Trainer, and Villager.

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:52.180
And also, Nintendo of America tweeted that at least Pit and Whiffit Trainer are going

01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:59.580
to appear in stores in the next few weeks, so yeah, if anyone that is looking for the

01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:06.900
rare Amiibos, like Villager, especially, and some of the store exclusives, and are still

01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:12.180
looking for them, well, probably they will appear in the next few weeks or at least before

01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:15.020
the month ends, so that's pretty big.

01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:16.620
I'm cautiously optimistic.

01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:20.980
I'll believe it when I can walk into a store and see what I see these pictures out of Japan

01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:24.500
and Europe where the shelves just line with them, because I'm telling you what, I went

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:28.180
into a Target just yesterday, because we were there for something else, and I was like,

01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:32.340
oh, let's just go look at the Amiibo for fun, see what they have, LOL.

01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:34.660
They were fucking picked dry.

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:35.660
Picked dry.

01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:39.820
Like, there was maybe like two Marios and a Zelda hanging on the shelf.

01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:40.820
That's it.

01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:44.660
Like, I was like, damn, like, you can't even get a goddamn Pikachu anymore.

01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:45.660
That's crazy.

01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:46.660
Yeah, sorry.

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:57.140
Yeah, usually when a wait just launches, the Amiibos are really, really scarce, so yeah,

01:13:57.140 --> 01:14:01.140
you really find some of the even common ones.

01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:02.660
Well, let me ask you this.

01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:06.960
Do you think it's about to break with these Amiibos, because earlier, before the press

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:11.760
conference began, we were talking about a leaked ad or something that had come out that

01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:17.480
showed that there was an 8-bit Mario Amiibo and these Animal Crossing Amiibo, and it's

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:20.480
like, why are there Animal Crossing Amiibo when you haven't announced Animal Crossing

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:21.480
Wii U yet?

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:23.520
Although, clearly, that's the thing.

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:26.800
I think that they originally were talking about those, I think they had actually announced

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:27.800
those a while back.

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:28.800
Well, there were the cards.

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:32.480
No, so actually, the Amiibos are actually going to be for that stupid 3DS game.

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:33.480
Oh, pfft.

01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:34.480
Well, anyway.

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:36.240
No one's going to buy it for that 3DS game.

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:37.240
Yeah.

01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:38.240
Now, Wii U.

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:39.240
Animal Crossing.

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:43.880
See, and this is where I'm torn on Amiibos, because I hate those little fucking things

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:44.880
and everything.

01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:45.880
God damn, they're so annoying.

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:46.880
But I wanted Isabelle!

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:49.640
But isn't it too early for, like, an Animal Crossing?

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:51.640
Don't you think it's a little early for an Animal Crossing?

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:54.720
Like, we just fucking had an Animal Crossing a couple years ago.

01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:57.480
I think it's too, like, soon for an Animal Crossing Wii U game.

01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:59.960
Can we just, like, get something better?

01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:05.200
Well, I'm going to counter and say, and I know immediately what your response is going

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.200
to be, but please let me finish my sentence.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:08.940
Alright, go ahead.

01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:14.980
But if the game is something different, but still Animal Crossing, but it's like, no,

01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:19.620
they really did reinvent the game from the ground up, there's some, like, new twist on

01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:20.620
Animal Crossing.

01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:21.620
Low-key retort.

01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:28.020
I'm not going to say anything, because, you know, I know how ridiculous that idea is.

01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:33.300
Just like, oh yeah, we, we, you're the mayor now, and it's an island, and, um, yeah.

01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:34.580
There you go.

01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:36.860
It's, we moved where the shops are now.

01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:37.860
They're different.

01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:38.860
Different spots.

01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:42.080
And, you know, hey, all those random things that you wanted to wait for, and that actually

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:44.620
made it worthwhile to play the game, to see some new stuff in there.

01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:46.500
Yeah, we just did all second to one corner.

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:50.540
Oh, and still no fucking virtual console games in the, in this, because, you know, fuck you,

01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:52.100
that's why.

01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:57.380
I'm just, I, I'm just, you know, call me crazy, but maybe they could do an Animal Crossing,

01:15:57.380 --> 01:15:59.040
it's like actually a different game.

01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:00.040
But we'll see.

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.040
I don't know.

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:06.380
Well, New, New Leaf was kind of a different game, because even, even though it has this,

01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:12.060
uh, still the same core gameplay, you, you really had more stuff to do.

01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:13.060
Yeah, that's right.

01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:17.860
So, uh, I can really argue about, oh, it's the same thing, but with less stuff.

01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:23.660
Yeah, you can talk about, yeah, the, the lack of virtual console games, and some of, some

01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:29.420
of the shops that, uh, kind of limited, are limited, at least not from the start.

01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:34.380
But playing the game, it's, uh, at least, uh, from my perspective, that I played the

01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:40.260
original, at least on the GameCube, and, and didn't play one until New Leaf.

01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:43.900
There was a lot of things new, and pretty, pretty damn fun.

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:46.540
I, I played that game for almost a year straight.

01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:49.620
Let me, let me just, let me just throw out a crazy idea, I mean, some of you are gonna

01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:54.300
want to give me a drug screening after I say this, but what if they did, like, uh, I don't

01:16:54.300 --> 01:16:59.100
know, like an always online type of game, where you could have more than one person

01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:03.120
in your town, where you coexist, like in the, like in the older games, where like four people

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:06.880
could live in one town, but what if that could all happen, like, at the same time?

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:07.880
I would really like that.

01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:08.880
I would too!

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:09.880
Like, a lot.

01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:10.880
Think of the children.

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:11.880
Think of the children.

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:12.880
I know.

01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:17.280
You're gonna have the pedophiles living right next door, having access to the animal genitals

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:18.280
right there.

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:19.280
I know.

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:24.120
It's just, it's, think of the children, they will be lured, lured out by strangers, because

01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:26.540
they'll be like, hey, you want some candy, child?

01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:31.440
And the sign in front of my house that says, I heart butts, you know, the poor children,

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:32.440
the poor children.

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:35.960
Well, at least they tried with this platoon, but, yeah.

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:39.760
Anyway, that was all deviation, quickly, because I want to let you go so we can get more calls,

01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:42.260
but quickly, your thought on all these amiibo.

01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:44.760
Is it too much, Act F'd?

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:50.560
Is it too much, kinda, are people really burned out on them?

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:51.560
Not at all.

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:53.840
That's what I'm gonna say.

01:17:53.840 --> 01:18:00.040
Nintendo fans, and I say this as one, Nintendo fans are fucking nuts, like, especially for

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:05.840
collectibles, like, it's like fucking nuts squared, and I, I, I fully confess that's

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:06.840
me too.

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:09.960
I have no reason to have all those amiibo in the living room that I do.

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:12.440
Yeah, and you know what's gonna be great, Rob?

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:14.480
Let's flash forward ten years from now.

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:15.480
Jesus.

01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:19.240
Nintendo has their next console coming out, but for some reason, in ten years, some reason,

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:23.160
okay, well, whatever, yeah, for some, they already have it out, okay, whatever, okay,

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:28.640
for some reason, and this just seems to happen all the time with Disney Infinity, or maybe

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:33.200
not Disney Infinity, but like Skylighters and stuff, it's just like, you know what,

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:36.560
the old ones just don't work with the new one.

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:41.120
Sorry, our new system, the old amiibos aren't gonna fucking work with it.

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:42.120
You better buy this.

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:46.760
It's the new amiibo lineup, and that's what it's called, because it's Nintendo, they just

01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:53.400
call it new amiibo, and then this is, this is a new amiibo Mario Party 11.

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:56.080
Oh, yeah.

01:18:56.080 --> 01:19:01.800
Alright, act deaf, I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls, but thank you for calling

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.960
in and making me hate myself a little bit.

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:06.680
Hey, thanks for the problem, for protecting me.

01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:07.680
Take care, buddy.

01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:12.640
Well, look at Nintendo, like, they have to, um, well, they have Mario Maker, that's great,

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:15.600
and you know what, I'm really glad that they have it, and I think that's gonna be a pretty

01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:19.040
awesome game, but then you got, like, you know, all these other games out there that

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:23.120
build in their own level editors with the game, you know, that's just something that

01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:24.120
comes with it.

01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:27.360
There's so many confessions in our chat room, Brak the Man says, I have 31 amiibo and I

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:32.480
hate myself every day, Black Wolf says, I have three and I hate myself, uh, Raginator

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:35.320
says nuts squared, more like deez nuts squared.

01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:39.480
I have one amiibo, and I didn't even buy it, and it's sitting on a shelf unopened, and

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:41.200
I still hate myself for having it.

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:47.760
Fifth Dream is suggesting a me-bew, because with a ew, a me-bew, anyway, hi, you're on

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:50.160
Orange Songs Radio, who's this?

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:51.160
It's Ronma.

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:52.160
Ronma, I know you got that.

01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:55.320
You're like talking like Cat now, and it's like, me-bew!

01:19:55.320 --> 01:20:00.800
Yeah, there's sad kitties in Ronma's profile, because they heard us talking about amiibo.

01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:01.800
That too.

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:04.840
What's on your mind, my friend?

01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:11.200
Man, listen, Loki, I feel you on the amiibos, because, look, I don't hate myself, because

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:16.440
I had the two that I want, and they're sitting up, sitting on my wall here, and that's it.

01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:17.440
That's all I need.

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:22.080
Don't get me wrong, they would be cool, like, as statues, so I could pay five bucks and

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:27.120
get like the one I want, and that's it, because it's just, they don't add enough to the games,

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:30.920
like, okay, yeah, I can train one in fucking Smash Brothers, whoopty shit.

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:33.680
AkumaJP is in chat saying, sorry.

01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:34.680
Don't be sorry.

01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:35.680
No, no, no.

01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:38.680
A Bowser amiibo is perfect for this little bastard, just saying.

01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:40.000
No, no, no, no, no.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:45.040
I have, thank you, thank you again for saying that to me, I'm just saying, you know, I think,

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:50.480
like I feel that now I'm part of the problem, because, you know, I own one, so, yeah, that's

01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:54.320
my whole thing, it's like, you know, my stance of not owning one, I can't do that anymore

01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.440
because I still haven't.

01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:00.360
You make Loki a hypocrite every day, everybody in chat should be thanking you, AkumaJP.

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:04.400
It's the only thing on my desk at work that's game-related, so there you go.

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:05.400
Congratulations.

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:09.760
No, but it's just, I don't know, where was I going with this?

01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:10.760
I don't even remember.

01:21:10.760 --> 01:21:11.760
I don't know.

01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:15.160
Why don't we let Rama talk about whatever he called in to talk about tonight.

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:18.800
Okay, I got a couple of things, I'm gonna get the heck up on out of here now.

01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:24.320
As with Amiibo, I got the ones I want, but I tell you what, when they announce the real

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:28.400
Amiibo, I will shank a mofo for one, okay?

01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:29.400
I will.

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:30.400
What's the real Amiibo?

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:31.400
Are you talking about the new?

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:32.400
The new?

01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:33.400
No, Ryu.

01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:34.400
Oh, the Ryu Amiibo.

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:38.240
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you said the new, oh, the Ryu Amiibo, oh my god, people are

01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:39.880
gonna get killed for those.

01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:42.920
What about the ones that, like, what is it, the two Rob the Robots, they have different

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:45.520
paint colors, you know, depending on which region they're from?

01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:47.080
Oh yeah, that shit's gonna be funny.

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:51.000
Somebody will die at a GameStop for one of those Ryu Amiibos, and it's so morbid of me

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:55.200
to say, and I hate that I'm saying it, but, like, it's just people are crazy.

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:56.200
Rob?

01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:57.200
What?

01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:03.400
Supposedly, about a few weeks ago, two people were stabbed at a Walmart for a couple of

01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:04.400
Amiibos.

01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:08.800
Well, yeah, don't go to Walmart, but that's another story.

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:14.080
Let me tell you, I was at an anime nexus weekend, and my friend cosplayed Little Mac, and he

01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:18.680
said he was gonna walk around with a chain with all these Amiibos, I'm like, you do

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:23.080
realize someone's gonna snuff you, you do realize someone's gonna jack you.

01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:25.600
I can't help you.

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:28.000
Because the thirst for those Amiibos is real.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.320
It is real.

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:33.320
I feel like every week this show is turning into the Amiibo show, and I'm-

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:35.040
As Nintendo would like it to be.

01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:38.720
I'm worried that this is, like, this is the game industry's future, because we're all

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:39.720
obsessed with these little fuckers.

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:43.120
No, we used to talk about Skylanders and Disneyfinity shit before, we'll eventually get tired of

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:46.640
it, eventually we'll be like, okay, listen, I can't talk about every fucking time they

01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:49.520
announce a new character for Amiibos, no one gives a shit anymore.

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:53.080
That's true, there came a point where it's like, okay, we can't talk about Skylanders

01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:54.080
anymore.

01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:57.120
Or Rock Band songs, like, when they were used to announcing Rock Band DLC, it's like, okay,

01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:00.320
we can't report on this every fucking week, because there is a new song every fucking

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:01.320
week.

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:02.320
Fair enough.

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:03.320
Fair enough.

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:07.240
So, Rama, you will cut a bitch for a Ryu Amiibo.

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:08.240
That's right.

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:12.120
I'm right there with you, and then, I swear to God, if somehow there's some type of street

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:19.800
fighter Wii U game, and then they start giving us other fighters, like Chun-Li, Cammy, it's

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:20.800
over.

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:22.120
Shown up.

01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:27.080
Why can't I, can I get my Ryu on in Mario Kart 8, or something like that?

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:30.240
Can we get some Mario Kart 8 themed DLC?

01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:31.240
You never know.

01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:33.480
We got the Mega Man outfit for the kart.

01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:37.000
Or, like, can we get, like, I wanna see some more, like, I'm glad that they have all those

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:41.360
cross, well, and the other thing that only some Amiibos work with some games is fucking

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:47.160
stupid too, but I'm saying, you know, why can't we just have, like, maybe all of them

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:51.000
work with all games, you know, if you patch that shit in later, if you're gonna put out

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
a game, you know.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.520
Well, with, to be fair, with as many of these little fuckers that are coming out, it's gonna

01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:00.040
be hard, like, for your game to support every single Amiibo.

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:01.040
Whoa!

01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:03.400
You're saying that they have too many for the games that they have out there?

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:04.400
Yes, yes I am.

01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:06.400
Then maybe they should stop fucking producing them.

01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:07.400
That's an idea.

01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:08.400
Alright.

01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:11.920
Rama, did you just call in to talk about your love of Ryu Amiibo, or do you have any other

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:12.920
thoughts you wanna share with us tonight?

01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:13.920
No!

01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:17.160
I had a couple more things, but you know, when Loki is ranting, it's like hearing the

01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:21.240
preacher talking, like, preach, you know?

01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:25.280
I'm reminded of a scene from Orange is the New Black, but I don't wanna spoil anything,

01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:30.440
so I'll just leave it there, but you know I got made to marathon it yesterday.

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:32.120
That's a meme, just so you know.

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:33.120
Is it?

01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:41.360
Okay, real quick, the whole partnership with Oculus and Xbox, I'm not surprised since both

01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:46.800
companies are owned by one, I'm not surprised, not owned, but more or less, you know what

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:47.800
I'm saying.

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:50.920
What, Facebook and Microsoft are in bed together, is that what you're saying?

01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:57.960
Well, we all know that Microsoft has a nice, sizable interest investment in Facebook, and

01:24:57.960 --> 01:25:03.040
if you haven't realized, as Facebook is doing their physical changes, it kinda looks like

01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:08.640
a modern MSN or Windows 10 layout per se, so I'm not surprised by that.

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:12.880
Facebook competes with Microsoft in some spaces, such as like, you know, Skype, like what we're

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:16.800
using right now, Facebook would far prefer that we use their integrated messaging program.

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:20.160
I don't think that they're actually partnering with them in that sense, I just think that

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:24.400
they didn't wanna fuckin' design a controller, I mean, aside from the Oculus Touch, which

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:29.840
is a stupid name, I must admit, but I mean, honestly, the Xbox 360 controller works awesome.

01:25:29.840 --> 01:25:33.920
I was using an Xbox 360 controller on my laptop until it broke, and then I realized,

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:37.920
hey, guess what, I can sync up my PlayStation 4 controllers to it, it works just like the

01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:38.920
Xbox 360 one.

01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:43.240
When you strip out all the tinfoil hat and all these conspiracy theories about what are

01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:48.960
these two companies doing in bed together, to be honest, the Xbox 360, or the one controller,

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:54.840
I mean, I'm kinda using these terms interchangeably, it really is like the definitive PC gamepad,

01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:57.960
and I realize there's hundreds of different gamepads you can get out there, but there's

01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:04.320
so many games out there that will just recognize a 360 or a one controller, and they just work.

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:09.600
Even Final Fantasy XIV, you can tell that this game, they pitched it for 360 and the

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:14.480
one, because when you plug in that controller, Final Fantasy XIV will change all the icons

01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:15.960
to an Xbox controller.

01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:21.440
Well, it's just that most games utilize that now, and it's not to say that it's the best

01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:26.040
controller, but I think for PC, it is the best controller, I mean, what other competitors

01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:27.040
are out there.

01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:32.920
Please, don't tell me that the Steam controller is a fucking contender here, it's not, I mean,

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:36.200
they're gonna try to make that shit work, but I just don't see it happening.

01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:41.240
So if, I mean, and if Oculus is trying to level set the experience, which is something

01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:44.920
that like Morpheus on the Sony side doesn't have to deal with, but if Oculus is trying

01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:49.800
to level set the experience, saying, you know, you need a computer that's at least X level,

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:53.800
and at least they're kinda level setting, okay, this is the controller that we anticipate

01:26:53.880 --> 01:27:00.280
is gonna be in everybody's hand, because, you know, when your vision senses are 100%,

01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:04.920
and your audio senses, if you're doing it right, are 100% taken over by the Oculus experience,

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:09.400
then, you know what, your touch might as well all be consistent as well, so, I don't know.

01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:10.400
Just a thought.

01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:12.640
Anything else you wanna get out there, Ama?

01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:16.320
My last thing, I've been getting heat from some friends about Bethesda, because, look,

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:23.200
I don't like them, I've tried the Fallout series, didn't like it, thought it was crap.

01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:27.680
When I discovered they had Wolfenstein, I held my breath, I'm like, I don't know.

01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:31.360
Because I kept, when I listen to you guys, I have other friends, we're talking about

01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:35.760
Elder Scrolls, and Skyrim, and all the bugs and the issues, I'm just like.

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:37.800
That's what makes it great.

01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:39.680
It's so buggy sometimes.

01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:43.740
Like, today I was playing it, and all of a sudden, like, I was walking, I saw this hunter

01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:46.680
in front of me, and she pulled out her bow, I'm like, what the fuck's going on?

01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:50.320
All of a sudden, fire rained from the sky, and she died, I'm like, oh, hey, there's a

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.320
dragon up there.

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:55.760
I didn't even hear that dragon, and I shot the dragon, and it's bones rag-dolled crazily

01:27:55.760 --> 01:28:00.480
down the hill, because their rag-doll controls aren't very good.

01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:03.120
Acteft in chat says, the bugs are features.

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:11.920
Well, those are features I don't want in Wolfenstein, which is why I should, because I said this,

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:18.600
if I pick up Wolfenstein, and I like it, and it's not buggy, and it's not chaotic, I'll

01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:19.600
get Doom.

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:24.600
And I find myself screaming at the game, because Bethesda can't get stuff done, right?

01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:27.240
I'm like, I will just wait until Doom becomes a budget title.

01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:30.960
Well, the best part about buying Wolfenstein, I'm not sure if we're outside the window or

01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:35.440
not, but if you buy Wolfenstein, you do get a Doom beta entry.

01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:43.520
I was gonna say, though, but you've gotta pick it up on PC, too, because I have the,

01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:49.000
like, you know, the Steam Workshop integrations, fantastic, and so, like, for example, my game

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:56.320
that I'm playing right now, I have the Saints Row Dubstep Gun spell, and it's awesome.

01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:57.320
Are you throwing things in this house?

01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:58.320
Yes, I'm throwing things.

01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:03.200
Rama, we're gonna let you go to try to squeeze in one more call, but Anime Jam Session, you

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:07.000
have that lucky Tuesday night slot where you're gonna be right after all this E3 stuff, so

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.660
I can't imagine you won't be dipping into video games at least a little bit this week

01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:12.640
on Anime Jam Session, yeah?

01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:18.880
No, we are, we just came back from Anime Next, so we got so much cover, and the big, big

01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:24.200
controversy because so many of the fans are pissed that the convention is moving to Atlantic

01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:25.200
City.

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:27.240
Oh, yeah, I heard there's a lot of stuff going on.

01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:31.400
Wow, when there's enough drama in your fandom, you don't got time for E3.

01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:36.840
Well, did you see the screenshot from what, I think, one of the titles that, you know,

01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:42.280
kind of the shocking announcement was, like, Platinum Games is doing a new Transformers

01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:43.280
game.

01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:44.280
Did you see the screenshot of that?

01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:48.200
Where it looks like it's straight out of the fucking 80s cartoon, like, the way they shaded

01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:49.200
everything.

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:50.200
It's awesome.

01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:51.200
Nice.

01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:52.200
I don't know.

01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:53.200
Alright.

01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:54.200
Rob, let me just say this, let me get out of here.

01:29:54.200 --> 01:29:58.280
When you talk about the fandom and the drama and all that, and my fandoms, this is all

01:29:58.280 --> 01:29:59.280
I gotta say.

01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:00.280
Girl, please.

01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:04.680
You have no idea, brah.

01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:06.560
Trust no bitch.

01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:07.560
Exactly!

01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:15.000
Alright, let me tell you, Magfest, we're gonna have some drinks, and I'm gonna tell you some

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000
stories, okay?

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Okay!

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:23.680
Everything, I tell you, this is the reason why I watch RuPaul's Drag Race.

01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:25.280
It's not, it's not a gay thing.

01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:28.000
It's not a, it's a life thing, people.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.240
There's so much advice.

01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:32.400
Anyway, another week, another week.

01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:33.720
Alright, take care, my friend.

01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:34.720
You too.

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:35.720
Bye.

01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:41.040
1A77 game, OLR, or username on Skype, OrangeLaundry.

01:30:41.040 --> 01:30:44.840
I'll try to squeeze in one quick call, if we have anybody else who wants to call in,

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:47.200
but otherwise we'll probably wrap things up here.

01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:50.120
Any of these other stories you think we ought to mention here, Loki?

01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:52.120
I just bought Fallout 3, game of the year edition.

01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:53.760
Did you really, on Steam, just now?

01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:54.760
Yeah.

01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:55.760
Alright.

01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:56.760
How much was it?

01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:57.760
$11.99.

01:30:57.760 --> 01:30:58.760
That's not bad.

01:30:58.760 --> 01:30:59.760
That's not bad.

01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:03.760
But I was actually hesitating, I was like, it's $11.99, and it's like, it's not like

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:04.760
purchasing a title.

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:05.760
Was it, but was it on...

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:09.240
It's 40%, no, it could go cheaper, or whatever.

01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:11.920
I don't give a shit, it's like a dollar or something.

01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:13.360
Can you do the refund thing, if it's tomorrow?

01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:18.000
I could, but I'm, I don't care, it's not, at that point it doesn't matter.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:25.560
Alright, last chance, guys, 1877 game OLR, username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:29.960
Let's see, I do want to mention this about the Arc System Works, apparently bought not

01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:34.560
only the Double Dragon Rites this week, but River City Ransom, oh my god, does this mean

01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:39.120
we could have like a crossover, or just the fact that River City Ransom could be making

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:40.360
a comeback?

01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:41.800
That would be awesome.

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:48.520
Don't forget Arc System Works, they made Hardcore Uprising, that was just fucking Contra, straight

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:50.480
up, like that was a Contra game.

01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:51.480
It was.

01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:52.480
And it was great.

01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:57.080
And if they're gonna remake River City Ransom like that, or reimagine or whatever the hell

01:31:57.080 --> 01:32:00.400
you want to call it, I'm so in, that's gonna be a lot of fun.

01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:06.420
So yeah, and if they somehow incorporate the Double Dragon universe into that too, amazing.

01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:10.160
So totally down to see what happens with those guys.

01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:13.320
Loki, one more before we close up shop?

01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:21.560
Okay, let's see, let's go ahead and talk about this, I guess, oh, Bloodstained, that did

01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:22.560
pretty well.

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:28.640
It was the most funded Kickstarter ever, I'm not sure if that's actually true, maybe most

01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:29.640
funded game?

01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:33.160
I think it's the most funded game, I think it still got beat by like Oculus and the Watch

01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:34.160
thing.

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:40.040
Yeah, I was gonna say, even, fuck, I want to say, no, I want to say that stupid Ouya

01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:41.040
out.

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:42.040
Yeah, the Ouya.

01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:43.040
But anyways.

01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:46.040
But this is the most funded, like, game software, I guess you could say.

01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:55.280
Yes, so $4.2 million, it beat out, was it Tormund's Tides of, I have never heard of

01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:56.280
that game.

01:32:56.280 --> 01:33:00.080
But I guess that one got $4.1 million a few years ago.

01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:04.640
Didn't they, I thought the Bloodstained thing ended up with like $5.5 million, it's crazy.

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:06.120
I thought it was even higher than that.

01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:08.240
Let's take a look here real quick, because I don't trust our people.

01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:11.920
Alright, take a peek while we get to this call, because they hit their last stretch

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:13.920
goal, which was $5.5 million, so I'm sure they got it.

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:14.920
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?

01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:16.920
Yeah, what's up guys, this is Kaijuto.

01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:17.920
Hey Kaijuto, what's up buddy?

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:22.920
Not much, I'm gonna keep this short, I just want to say, Bethesda completely won me over,

01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:27.560
I had no interest in their press conference, I was saying to myself, that we asked for

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:33.120
Fallout 4, I've never been a Doom fan, so I mean, there was really nothing I thought

01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:38.040
they were gonna offer me that was gonna sway me, but man, was that a great press conference.

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:42.840
I mean, it's probably one of the best I've seen in E3 in a long time, not even when they

01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:45.700
brought out the new consoles, was I impressed.

01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:49.320
Here's the $64,000 question, why?

01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:53.080
Just every game they showed, that dynamic game engine, that everything that you can

01:33:53.080 --> 01:33:58.000
do in Fallout, how everything is just like done on the fly, and just also the graphics,

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:03.000
I'm not really a graphics hoarder, but I mean, those games look beautiful, Doom, Fallout

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.800
4, Dishonored, even that indie game that they showed looked pretty good.

01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:11.280
I mean, I was completely impressed and blown away by everything that they showed it, I

01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:16.600
mean, they also had a lot of charisma that they put into the presentation that also made

01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:22.960
it a lot of fun to watch too, and that app, I was so disappointed that it was only for

01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:29.800
the iOS, because I have an Android, but that app is impressive as well, and when they mentioned

01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:35.360
it was free, and there's no paywall, I mean, they just hit everything, everything they

01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:38.080
said just sounded so freaking great and amazing.

01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:41.800
It's probably coming to Android, but they probably just had an in with Apple where it

01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:42.800
went live tonight.

01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:46.760
Well, it's also, they're developing it for, you know, like a handful of Apple devices

01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:52.600
versus the, you know, severely fragmented Android, you know.

01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:55.040
Yeah, but there's still some standards in that.

01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:58.740
I hope it comes out for Android, but the fact that he said that they, you know, they made

01:34:58.740 --> 01:35:02.620
some close friendships or partnerships with Apple, I was just like, oh, I think this thing

01:35:02.620 --> 01:35:04.080
is probably gonna be exclusive.

01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:05.080
We'll see.

01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:09.360
Which I don't get, which I'm, you know, that's one thing we'll get into another time, but

01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:11.000
it just pisses me off how many people just want it.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:15.600
Well, I guess I'll just have to push start and bring up my arm in the game as a menu

01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:21.000
instead of, you know, launching my separate app on my phone that that app will eat through

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.400
my battery like a fucking, you know, cookie monster in a bowl of cookies.

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:28.560
They're talking about Tiny Tower Fallout Shelter, that's, that's, well that looks pretty cool

01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:29.560
too.

01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:30.560
Yeah, I see, but that's the one that's out.

01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:33.920
But that one though, I'm hoping that they just port that shit over to like fucking Xbox

01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:34.920
or PS3.

01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:39.960
They did say in chat that is out now, so it came out in the past hour.

01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:44.660
It's not out this minute, this minute, but they, they are rolling it out right now, which,

01:35:44.660 --> 01:35:48.480
which was really great when you said that it was just like, yeah, they, I mean, they,

01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:49.760
they did an impressive show.

01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:50.760
You know what?

01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:53.440
I will say this, you know, especially considering that they didn't really have any like triple

01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:56.120
A like talent, like celebrities basically on set.

01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:59.280
I mean, obviously talented game developers, certainly, but they didn't have it.

01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:01.240
They didn't pull any celebrity stunts really.

01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:02.240
I mean, one card.

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:03.960
They had Adam Seskler and Morgan Webber.

01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:05.560
I don't even know.

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:09.560
I mean, yes, they're gaming celebrities, but I'm talking about like, there was no Joel

01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:13.480
McHale, Esha Tyler, those types of things, right?

01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:14.920
And they weren't on stage either.

01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:17.120
They did the pre and the post show, they weren't on stage.

01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:23.640
So I mean, I would argue that, you know, especially for a first year E3 show, they did a really

01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:28.960
good job and no real technical hiccups except, you know, the one yesterday that ruined one

01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:32.760
of the surprises, but okay, if that's, if that's going to be their hiccup, then so

01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:33.760
be it.

01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:34.760
So, yeah.

01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:35.760
And weren't they late too or something?

01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:39.880
Cause I thought it was supposed to start at like nine Eastern time and they didn't start

01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:44.240
till way late, but I don't know if I got my time.

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:48.280
Their pre-show with Morgan and all that started a little earlier.

01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:52.480
The conference was always supposed to be seven Pacific, 10 Eastern, but they had started

01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:56.760
a little pre-show, but we didn't acknowledge it cause we wanted you to stay with OLR until

01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:58.280
it was ready to go.

01:36:58.280 --> 01:36:59.280
So yeah.

01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:00.280
All right.

01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:01.280
Yeah.

01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:02.280
I was.

01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:03.280
Yeah.

01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:04.280
Just great show.

01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:05.280
All right.

01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:06.280
I don't know.

01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:07.280
I think, I don't even think they should do a press conference next year.

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:08.280
Like this year was so good.

01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:11.920
I think they should just wait until they have another blockbuster game, like the next elder

01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:14.120
scrolls or whatever, and then do one.

01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:15.120
Just don't bother.

01:37:15.120 --> 01:37:17.680
Cause you're not going to be able to live up to what you did tonight.

01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:18.680
One and done.

01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:21.960
Well, that might be the case, sir, because last year they only had two games to show.

01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:22.960
This is just a different year.

01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:23.960
Now they have more happening.

01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:26.480
So, all right, my friend, I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up.

01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:27.480
Have a good night.

01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:28.480
Later.

01:37:28.480 --> 01:37:29.480
All right.

01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:30.480
Later.

01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:31.480
All right.

01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:32.600
Well, believe it or not, I know it seems like it was a really short night tonight on the

01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:36.160
podcast for those of you listening midweek, although, you know, even there might even

01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:40.560
be less of you during the week because a lot of you are going to be caught in with E3 excitement,

01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:44.520
but it is about nine 30 on the West coast, meaning 30 after midnight on the East coast.

01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:46.600
So we are going to go ahead and shut down OLR for the night.

01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:47.600
I apologize.

01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:51.040
I know we didn't get to a lot of our usual segments, which include a lot of the ways

01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:55.600
that you guys interact with the show, including our mailbag, our frugal question of the week

01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:56.600
and so forth.

01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:00.080
We're going to make some tough decisions for time, but we will get back to all the

01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:01.640
voices next week.

01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:03.640
A big wrap up show next week.

01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:09.360
I'm sure there will be lots of opinions on things we, we, things we don't know exist

01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:12.320
today that we will in 24 hours.

01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:13.320
Think about that.

01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:16.080
We're 24 hours away from what we'll be talking about on OLR.

01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:19.720
I just want you to see this real quick because platinum games is fucking fantastic, but look

01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:20.720
at this shit.

01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:21.720
Fucking look at that game.

01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:22.720
Oh yeah.

01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:23.720
Straight out of a cartoon.

01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:24.720
That's going to be awesome.

01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:26.720
I'm not even that excited about transformers games, especially after playing some of the

01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:29.720
ones that activisions put out, but Hey, platinum games is awesome.

01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:31.720
So you can't go wrong there.

01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:32.720
All right.

01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:35.720
Well, uh, dark Sakura sadly couldn't stick with us for the rest of the show tonight,

01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:39.720
but I'm sure if she were here, her final thought would be something like reject false icons.

01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:43.720
Uh, and um, thank you Bobby again for sitting in on the first half of the show with us.

01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:47.720
Thank you to our live listeners who stuck with us tonight with all the weird oddities

01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:48.720
tonight.

01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:50.720
And thank you to everybody who listened on the podcast as well.

01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:53.720
If you enjoyed orange light, if you didn't enjoy orange light, if you didn't enjoy orange

01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:56.720
launch radio, just tell a friend or five about the show.

01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:59.720
Help us spread the word because word of mouth is all we have.

01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:02.720
Uh, and the more voices we get the better because we can all learn something from each

01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:07.720
other as long as we can all not be jerks, which luckily we're very fortunate that, uh,

01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:12.720
the oil army is very good at, uh, conducting themselves, uh, respectfully and respectful

01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:13.720
of others.

01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:16.720
So, uh, anyhow, getting final thoughts for the night.

01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:18.720
Um, Loki, your final thoughts tonight?

01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:22.720
I hope I'm done spending non steam stores, you know, steam sale cause, uh, you're not

01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:26.720
I got to check my bank account, make sure I'm not spending too much.

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:27.720
I have been pretty good.

01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:31.720
I, you know, it seems, it feels like I've been spending a lot, but I am a lot of times

01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:37.720
when I do that, I, uh, or when I check with that, it's, I end up canceling when I have

01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:38.720
in my cart.

01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:40.720
I'm like, I don't really need that.

01:39:40.720 --> 01:39:48.720
Uh, my final thought is I am so excited for final fantasy 14 heavens ward, um, this week.

01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:54.720
And, um, I don't know how I can handle all this E3 stuff and then a new fucking expansion

01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:55.720
to an MMO.

01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:57.720
We all know what a fucking time sync those are.

01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:00.720
I don't know how I'm going to be able to handle that all in one week.

01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:05.720
Uh, and then my only other final thought would be, uh, I marathon sense eight this week,

01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:07.720
the Netflix show that's by the Wachowski, uh, siblings.

01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:10.720
And, um, I think they did it with Tom Twiker as well.

01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:12.720
Uh, it was, it was really good.

01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:13.720
A little slow to start.

01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:16.720
Didn't like episode 10, but the rest of it.

01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:17.720
Fantastic.

01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:18.720
Great show.

01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:19.720
You like the Wachowskis don't you?

01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:20.720
I do like the Wachowskis.

01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:21.720
You should check out the show.

01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:22.720
You have Netflix?

01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:23.720
Yeah.

01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:24.720
You probably enjoy that show.

01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:26.720
That's why I kept seeing you talking about Sense8.

01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:28.720
I didn't know what it was about.

01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:31.720
Um, it's, it's sci-fi a little bit.

01:40:31.720 --> 01:40:35.720
And so at a very high level, I'm not going to say anything that you wouldn't read in

01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:36.720
a TV guide.

01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:41.720
It's basically eight people that all share sensations with each other and they're all

01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:42.720
around the world.

01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:44.720
So they're all kind of like connected.

01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:47.720
I don't want to say they have the same brain, but they're all connected.

01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:50.720
Like they can kind of feel each other's brain activity and stuff.

01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:53.720
And that leads down this whole science fiction story type of path.

01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:57.720
So, but not like if you're looking for like special effects, craziness, like the matrix,

01:40:57.720 --> 01:40:58.720
you're not going to get that here.

01:40:58.720 --> 01:40:59.720
It's a TV show.

01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:01.720
There's a few car chases and things like that.

01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:02.720
That's it.

01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:03.720
Sure.

01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:04.720
All right.

01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:05.720
Anyway, that's it.

01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:06.720
We're done.

01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:07.720
We're out of here for the night.

01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:10.720
Thank you guys again for listening to the show and we will see you in seven days where

01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:13.720
we will all be exhausted, but ready to talk about E3.

01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:14.720
Have a great night, everybody.

01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:46.720
See you next week.

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:14.720
Bye.

01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:14.740
Bye.
