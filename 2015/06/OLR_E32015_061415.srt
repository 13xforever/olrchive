00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki!

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,360
Although tomorrow is officially day zero, the E3 keynotes begin tonight with Bethesda's

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,600
announcements, some of which may have already been revealed during a live streamed rehearsal.

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,780
Join us for the keynote reaction, expectations, and all the week's news starting right now

00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,600
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

9
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,520
where every gamer has a voice.

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:43,420
This is Orange Lounge Radio with a special mini E3 2015 episode for this June the 14th

11
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:45,220
of 2015.

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,040
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me in studio as she always does, say hello to DarkSakura

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,040
or Jamie Summers.

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,260
Except when I don't.

15
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,220
Except when you don't, like last week.

16
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,760
But I hear a lot of good things are going on at work for you.

17
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,340
Good things and it's been such a combination of bad and good at the same time, that I'm

18
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,580
sort of like, what?

19
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,340
Well I hope you were feeling a lot of the love listeners were sending you last week,

20
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,340
they missed you.

21
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,700
Thank you everybody, I appreciate it.

22
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,660
Also joining us in studio tonight, say hello to Tech Master Loki!

23
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,660
Hi.

24
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,180
Hi, and who actually had two milkshakes for dinner tonight, correct?

25
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:27,740
Well, technically I had, you know, a garlic fries and a, was it a cheese, you know, sandwich.

26
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,220
Okay, so you had a little bit before you brought the milkshakes to you.

27
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,660
But then I had two milkshakes because, you know, I wanted a large milkshake from In-N-Out

28
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,340
but they didn't have a large milkshake, they only have one size, so.

29
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,420
I was like, I'll just get two.

30
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,660
Which is a mistake because those milkshakes are extremely heavy.

31
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:48,180
But I was determined, I paid money for them to finish both.

32
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,220
I did, but it's just like, oh, that's a lot of food.

33
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,500
Alright, well, tonight is a little bit different edition of Orange Launch Radio.

34
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,980
Those of you on the podcast feed are probably going to realize, gosh, this week's OLR seems

35
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,980
really short, especially for a big week as such as E3.

36
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,860
Well here's what's going on guys, we're having to do a little bit of production on the fly

37
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:10,380
tonight because we got bumped back a little bit by the Nintendo World Championships, which

38
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:16,540
just wrapped up not even like two minutes ago, it's now 6.25 or so on the west coast,

39
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,460
9.25 on the east coast.

40
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:23,380
And this is not a pre-E3 show, we're in it, we're sitting in it.

41
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,140
Announcements are starting to come out, we're going to talk about some of those in just

42
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,140
a moment.

43
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,860
Bethesda's press conference starts at seven, so we got a lot to get through tonight.

44
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,180
But you know, not only did our show get bumped back a little bit by all the Nintendo World

45
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:40,940
Championship stuff going on, but our good pal Bobby Blackwolf, he does a show every

46
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,500
Sunday right before us on the network at five o'clock Pacific, eight o'clock Eastern, and

47
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,780
that Nintendo World Championships tonight just ate up his show entirely, and I felt

48
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,820
really bad for him.

49
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,260
A lot of us really enjoy hearing from Bobby, and he's always good enough to have us on

50
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,220
his show every single week, so I thought, you know what, let's bring him on to OLR tonight.

51
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,020
Bobby, how you doing?

52
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,140
Are you a squid, or are you a kid?

53
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:09,420
I'm having an identity crisis, I think I might be both.

54
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,940
Have you been playing any Splatoon at all, Bobby?

55
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,940
You want to know what?

56
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,540
I had not really seen it or played it until tonight.

57
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,380
I see what all the fuss is about.

58
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,980
I may be go getting it.

59
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,980
It's a lot of fun.

60
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:25,260
You know, for a first person shooter, the whole different mechanic where it's what's

61
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,940
covered in paint that really makes the difference, just has this whole little different spin

62
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,940
on it.

63
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,940
It's actually a third person shooter.

64
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,180
Yeah, it's not about the kills, you know what I mean, yeah, it really is a third person

65
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,180
shooter.

66
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,460
Anyway, I'm having a lot of fun with it.

67
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:45,180
Some of the Amiibo on disc DLC, some of that kind of bugs me, and some of the online, so

68
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,100
it's flawed, but it's still really strong, especially for an original IP title.

69
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,020
Yeah, but no, the Nintendo World Championships, I watched the whole thing.

70
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,380
I was in it in 1990.

71
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,980
I was a semi-finalist in Atlanta, so I kind of have a personal connection to it, and so

72
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,300
I watched the whole thing.

73
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:07,740
Wow, the logistics and what they pulled off in three and a half hours, the pacing was

74
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,740
amazing.

75
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,620
It did not feel like a three and a half hour show.

76
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,580
Evo could learn a thing or two.

77
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,020
Are you irritated that you got bumped tonight, Bobby?

78
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,780
No, you know, it's fine.

79
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:23,660
What I'm going to probably most likely do is I may do my show for this week where I

80
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,380
talk about the press conferences.

81
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:31,000
I may do Tuesday night at 8 p.m. Eastern, 5 p.m. Pacific, leading into anime jam sessions,

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,300
so you know when I would usually have you guys on?

83
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,100
I'm going to have anime jam session on.

84
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,100
Nice.

85
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,740
So I'm still going to have a show, it's just going to be Tuesday after all the press conferences.

86
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,100
It's all mixed up here at the Voice of the Geeks Network this week.

87
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,100
It's crazy.

88
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,340
So what do you think about the news, since we're talking a little bit about E3 and stuff,

89
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:51,860
about Microsoft bumping a lot of their big titles to Gamescom because they have that

90
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,180
great of a lineup that's like, you know, hey, I want to learn more about Crackdown, sorry,

91
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,020
got to wait until Gamescom.

92
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,020
They're going to do what they're going to do.

93
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,020
Ask me after they show what they're going to show Monday morning.

94
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,380
I don't know, I just think it's pretty awesome if they have that great of a lineup.

95
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,380
Yeah.

96
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,060
I hope that's the case.

97
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,100
I was going to ask you about this, Bobby, too, since, you know, this wasn't technically

98
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,600
an E3 press conference, but you know, anybody that knows your show on the network, you know,

99
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,580
you are a really big connoisseur of VR and Oculus and all that.

100
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:30,500
And Oculus had a lot to say this week, which did tie into the 360 a little bit, because

101
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:36,180
the, excuse me, the Xbox One, because the Xbox One controller is going to be the official,

102
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:43,460
I guess, controller of the Oculus Rift, leading some to wonder, could Microsoft be unveiling

103
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,840
an even deeper partnership tomorrow?

104
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,540
What are your thoughts on all that, Bobby?

105
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,740
Well, and for one thing, that actually wasn't, it was the first E3 press conference.

106
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,900
E3 called it the first E3 press conference.

107
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,900
Oh, my bad.

108
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,860
So that actually was.

109
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,620
They are partnering, Oculus is partnering with Windows 10.

110
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,020
They're just using the Xbox One controller, because right now, the de facto controller

111
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,300
for the Oculus Rift games on PC is the Xbox 360 wired controller.

112
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,700
That's what everybody uses.

113
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,260
So they're going to bundle in the Xbox One controller.

114
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,540
They are doing, a lot of people think that the Oculus Rift is going to go on the Xbox

115
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,540
One.

116
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,540
It's not.

117
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,500
The Xbox One can't handle it.

118
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,660
Neither can the PS4.

119
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,060
That's why there's a breakout box with the Morpheus that has an extra GPU and CPU.

120
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:31,300
But they're doing the game streaming to Windows 10, so what they're doing with the Xbox One

121
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:37,260
is you can game stream your Xbox One games in 2D into a 3D theater.

122
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,540
And that's the partnership between Xbox and Oculus.

123
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:44,140
But it's more Windows 10 and Oculus, which is why the Oculus Rift, when it comes out,

124
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,540
is only going to run on Windows, and I didn't say Windows 10.

125
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,900
It may still run on Windows 7 and 8 and stuff.

126
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,180
But not on Mac OS X, not on Linux, not at launch.

127
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,180
Not at launch.

128
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,820
Very interesting too, because you talk about a lot of things where we can see applications

129
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,280
that aren't just gaming, and people sometimes forget, there's more to this Oculus thing

130
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,280
than gaming.

131
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,300
In fact, I would argue to be really successful, the Oculus is going to need to be more than

132
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,300
gaming.

133
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,900
And we've talked about some of the demos here previously on the show that you've showed

134
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,620
me like the Cirque du Soleil and the Paul McCartney concert and so forth.

135
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:20,220
So I mean, do you think that the non-gaming stuff we're going to see maybe twice as much

136
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,700
of that as we even do gaming over the coming weeks?

137
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,580
Maybe, because I know Oculus is doing a big thing with the Oculus Studio in the 360 movies

138
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,900
and the experiences like that.

139
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,200
So I think we're going to be seeing the games right now.

140
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,500
And they showed a lot of AAA games, everybody's like, where's my AAA games?

141
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,620
Well, they showed them to you, and then they're going to be investing $10 million into indies,

142
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,300
which is great.

143
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:47,740
So it's going to be really neat to see what comes out of it and where it goes from here.

144
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,700
Let's talk a little bit about E3 predictions and what we think is going to happen in the

145
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:56,060
coming days here, because this is always a fun game to do, especially because next

146
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,340
week we'll look back and see how wrong we were.

147
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,900
Loki and I did this a little bit last week, but Jamie, I'll ask you in a moment if you

148
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,140
want to chime in with anything you might have wanted to give in about what you want to see

149
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,140
at E3.

150
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,340
But Bobby, I know you've talked a little bit on your show, but what do you hope to see

151
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,900
coming in the coming days out of E3?

152
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:16,000
I know this is a little weird for you, because this is what, only the second year in many

153
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,920
years that you aren't there in person, but we've talked about why and so forth.

154
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,960
So looking forward.

155
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,840
You know what?

156
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:28,720
What I always say, even when I'm there, what's the thing I'm looking forward to see most

157
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,960
is the thing I don't know about yet.

158
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,220
I want to know the one thing that nobody knows about that just surprises everybody, surprises

159
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,440
me and all that stuff.

160
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,840
That's what I look forward to seeing.

161
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:46,920
But I'd love to, I can't wait to hear what Oculus Touch, how that integrates, and how

162
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
it actually works.

163
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,460
The thing that was the big problem with input is tracking hands is hard.

164
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,760
Tracking fingers is easy, though.

165
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,340
So that's what they solved with the Oculus Touch is they track your hands with the things

166
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:02,300
you're holding, but they can track your fingers inside of that.

167
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,900
And then that gives you all the full range of everything.

168
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,400
And that's not coming out until holiday.

169
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,400
So the Oculus Rift will come out, and then the Oculus Touch comes later, which is going

170
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,720
to be kind of scary, because it's going to be a peripheral that you're going to have

171
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,280
to get later, and who knows how many people are going to support it.

172
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,960
Go to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, because again, we do tape live every Sunday

173
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:27,240
night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern-ish, you know, when we're not being pushed around

174
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,200
by E3 things going on, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, unless, you know, his show

175
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,920
also gets bumped, and he just comes on our show and makes it work.

176
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:41,100
But we do get live comments from our chatroom, including Megaman400, that's my buddy Delvin

177
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,720
from Video Game Realness in our chat, saying, E3, get hyped.

178
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,840
There's a lot of hype going around for E3, and I think what Nintendo did today with the

179
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,600
Nintendo World Championships was probably a great way to, you know, get that hype going.

180
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
I see a lot of...

181
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,320
I didn't get to see the whole thing, admittedly.

182
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,920
I have so much going on that I was kind of busy during the day, but certainly I was feeling

183
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,640
a lot of the energy at the end there, and I see a lot of people on Twitter going like,

184
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,760
you know, Nintendo, maybe you shouldn't, like, put this to bed for 20 years.

185
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,240
You should think about doing this type of thing annually.

186
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,600
I don't know.

187
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,680
Loki, sometimes you're a vocal critic of Nintendo, but you seemed really into what was going

188
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,680
on.

189
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,680
What are your thoughts?

190
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,680
Well, I liked the World Championship.

191
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,480
I thought that was done well, and same with, like, even the Smash Brothers tournament.

192
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,920
Their live presentations were good.

193
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,920
So they have that going for them, and even, like, the kind of go...

194
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:32,240
Yeah, pretty much the whole live presentation part of Nintendo, like the E3 live from the

195
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,920
Treehouse thing last year was great.

196
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,080
I thought, and I know I've commented today, I wish more developers would do that, because

197
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,900
that was, I think, a lot more effective at showing their titles, because they had so

198
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,900
much to unveil.

199
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,680
They didn't even fit it in all the three directs that they had last year, and I don't know

200
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,600
how many directs they're having this year, because they already had one today.

201
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,120
So I think it's a good thing, and I think that they...

202
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,400
It's definitely a good way to show off, you know, Mario Maker, that's for sure.

203
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,080
Yeah, I think a lot of people were definitely turning their heads when they saw what was

204
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,080
in a lot of those levels, like, okay, there's gonna be much...

205
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,720
You're like, okay, you can, you know, do some stuff in Mario Maker.

206
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,920
I've seen ROM hacks before, okay, cool, I know what to expect, but it's like kind of

207
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,100
a lot more exciting, like, oh, hey, you can actually do this.

208
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,320
That's really ridiculous, you know, that type of stuff.

209
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
Yeah, absolutely.

210
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,400
Bobby, what do you think?

211
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,920
Is this something they should do every year?

212
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,820
Yeah, I mean, this was actually really good.

213
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,560
What you didn't get to see was they announced a new game, Blast Ball, for the 3DS, which

214
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,720
is soccer with mechs, three versus three, and they showed that for the first time, and

215
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,080
everybody was playing it for the first time.

216
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,080
But I just really liked the tone that they set really early on, and this was kind of

217
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,960
a...they did something that was a little controversial with some people.

218
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:50,200
DJ Wheat is, you know, alleged in the esports commentating, well, he's got a family, and

219
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,120
his son is DJ Mini Wheat.

220
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,120
He's nine.

221
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,480
He loves Splatoon.

222
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,400
They opened with Splatoon and actually brought DJ Mini Wheat out to commentate with his father.

223
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Oh, fun.

224
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
And the other people.

225
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:06,560
And he was actually dropping more knowledge and more strat than most esports commentators

226
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,560
out there.

227
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,560
And a lot of people were like, get the kid.

228
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,000
The kid is annoying, blah, blah, blah.

229
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,960
But that really set the tone that, you know, this is family-friendly and, you know, we're

230
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,960
for everybody.

231
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,200
Oh, and kids are so important, and kids are the market for Splatoon right now.

232
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,200
You know what I mean?

233
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,680
Well, I shouldn't say that, because a lot of adults, obviously, like, I'm enjoying it

234
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,680
and so forth.

235
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,720
But I mean, like, there's lots of kids that are super into Splatoon, like, just seeing

236
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,220
on Twitter, especially a lot of gamer mommies and gamer daddies playing Splatoon with their

237
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,220
kids.

238
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,220
Well, here's my thing.

239
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,360
If you throw kids into Splatoon, like, kids are hooked into Call of Duty right now.

240
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,220
But it's a little bit more, you know, it's not so violent.

241
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,500
It's actually age-appropriate for them.

242
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,620
You know, if you can get them hooked into, like, you know, online, competitive online

243
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,940
gameplay like Call of Duty, then you're not going to have a problem.

244
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,340
And they made sure that you got Splat not killed.

245
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,340
Yes.

246
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,340
Yeah.

247
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,340
Yeah.

248
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,220
And it's interesting, because also you notice there's little nuances with Splatoon that

249
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,620
it doesn't tell you who splatted you.

250
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,860
It just tells you what weapon you got splatted with.

251
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,740
But you don't even know necessarily who landed the quote-unquote, I guess, Splat Shot.

252
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,380
Who got the Splat Shot on you instead of Kill Shot, Splat Shot, because it doesn't tell

253
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,380
you who.

254
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,380
So it's kind of interesting.

255
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,380
Little nuances like that.

256
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,460
I want to make sure Dark Soccer is able to get in a word here, because you watched a

257
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,740
little bit of the NWC with us here in studio and with Dan, right?

258
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,420
What was your thoughts on that whole thing?

259
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,420
Super Metroid.

260
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,900
You enjoyed that part of it?

261
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,900
I heard I missed it, yeah?

262
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,900
It's funny though.

263
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,700
We're like, oh, we're Baby Metroid.

264
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,460
And then you hear the people, oh, this is the sad part.

265
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,420
It's all the feels.

266
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,580
Did they save the animals at the end?

267
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,740
In the little side passage, you can save the animals?

268
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,740
Oh, no.

269
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,420
It was basically, how quickly can you get out?

270
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,420
Dicks.

271
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,420
Fuck the animals.

272
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,420
We're out of here.

273
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,420
We've got to win.

274
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,420
Blinded by the trophy.

275
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,420
I see how it is.

276
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,420
I see how it is.

277
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:03,100
Well, pretty much they were pretty good players, although I think that the very last level

278
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,700
had to have been some stage fright or something.

279
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,700
Yeah, I feel bad for that guy who really got caught up on the wall jumps, but I get caught

280
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,700
up on wall jumps too.

281
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,020
The wall jump boss is the worst.

282
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,660
He's still a very talented guy, I forget as far as he is.

283
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:19,700
He's just going to end up in an asylum someday, kind of like, what is it?

284
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,700
You're morbid.

285
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:27,060
Like Ace Ventura, Pet Detective, wall jumps, wall jumps, laces out, laces out.

286
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,060
Oh, God.

287
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,060
All right.

288
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,980
What are you hoping to see out of E3 in these coming days?

289
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,980
Stuff.

290
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,500
Just stuff?

291
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,460
I want my faith in the industry to be redeemed.

292
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:45,700
Ah, so you don't want any giant fuck ups where somebody says something.

293
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,700
Don't fuck it up.

294
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,700
Don't.

295
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,500
Good luck and don't fuck it up.

296
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,660
I've never even watched that show.

297
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,660
You really should.

298
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,660
Haven't you?

299
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,660
Did you interview one of the contestants for one of your other sites?

300
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,660
I did, Tatiana.

301
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,660
Yeah, that's funny.

302
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:03,340
I remember back when I was having that site, I was working on the site with Tiara.

303
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,340
Yeah, good times.

304
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,340
Good times.

305
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:10,980
Anyway, surely, surely you've got to be on the edge of your seat like me for EA's conference

306
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,620
tomorrow and Mass Effect.

307
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:18,620
Like I'm going to be effing pissed if they don't show anything for Mass Effect.

308
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,820
You'll pay for the whole seat, but you'll only need the edge.

309
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:22,820
So get a refund.

310
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,380
I want a goddamn trailer tomorrow and I want a name.

311
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,380
Give me the name.

312
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,780
We'll see.

313
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:33,620
And I want to know if, I'm hoping we might get to see some of the voice actors and actresses.

314
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,340
I want more Dragon Age DLC.

315
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,340
See if Jennifer Hale's in it.

316
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,340
I'm sure you'll get that.

317
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:42,060
I want them to announce Wolf Hunt DLC and that won't make me happy.

318
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,640
All right, let's go into recapping a little bit of the news from today with what little

319
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,780
time we have left.

320
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,860
And Bobby, I'll check in with you too so you can get your word in edgewise on any of this

321
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,100
news this week you want to get in on.

322
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,300
Let's start off the top here with some of the Nintendo stuff that's gone on today.

323
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,140
Loki, another big announcement at the NWC this evening, right?

324
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,140
Yes.

325
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,580
And then on top of that, I'm so surprised to see that someone actually beat me to a

326
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,060
tumbler that's timed to penis.

327
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,060
Really?

328
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,060
Is there actually a tumbler?

329
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,060
Seriously.

330
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:15,660
And here's the quote, eventually all user-generated content will tend towards the crude drawings

331
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,660
of fallacies.

332
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,660
I'm sure it's one of our listeners.

333
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,660
Probably.

334
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,540
Jamie, is that one of your tumblers?

335
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,540
Time to penis?

336
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,540
I have to check.

337
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,540
Anyway.

338
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,540
That's pretty awesome.

339
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:32,820
Anyways, so lots of news from Nintendo today actually, including Mother 1 being released

340
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:37,540
on Wii U Virtual Console as Earthbound Beginnings.

341
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,580
And they actually took the, they actually localized it.

342
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:45,860
Which makes me wonder, is Earth, is Mother 3 that far behind?

343
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,340
Well, keep in mind, they may not have had to do as much work as you think, because they

344
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,580
had localized that game before.

345
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,180
There was that English ROM that was floating around on the internet several years ago.

346
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,940
I'm still floating around out there today.

347
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,180
So they had already fully translated that into English.

348
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,220
They just made a business decision not to ultimately put that game out on the NES.

349
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:09,140
And then there were weird things with that ROM that made it unbeatable until people hacked

350
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,140
it.

351
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,900
So they didn't just do this translation yesterday.

352
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,260
They might have gone in and, I mean, somebody will have to do a side-by-side comparison

353
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,900
with the old prototype versus what ultimately goes on a Virtual Console.

354
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,660
I'm sure there was some tweaking that had to be done, but I don't think this was a months

355
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,660
and months project.

356
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:30,420
I think this is something where Nintendo is getting a little more tuned in to what fans

357
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,780
around the world want.

358
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,020
And this is one of those things where you kind of look at it and go, you know, they

359
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,300
really should have just released this five or six years ago.

360
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:45,020
And also was the Nintendo Direct about Smash, which kind of confirmed all the leaked DLC

361
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:51,380
tales that were out there before, including DLC characters, including Roy from Fire Emblem.

362
00:17:51,380 --> 00:18:00,140
They also have Ryu from Street Fighter 2, and then they were also adding, who else was

363
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,140
it?

364
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,140
Lucas.

365
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,140
Lucas, yes.

366
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,140
But I thought they already talked about Lucas.

367
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,740
They had talked about Lucas previously, so that wasn't necessarily new information.

368
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,300
It was just the fact that, you know, it's, well, they'd even said it was going to come

369
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,300
out today.

370
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,760
So it was more like Lucas and friends.

371
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,120
Maybe the Earthbound thing is tied into Lucas's release.

372
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,400
Like, I know Lucas isn't from the original, but he's from one that isn't even out here.

373
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,320
But maybe that was part of why they did that today was like, it's Lucas and we're going

374
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,760
to do like an Earthbound, you know, adjacent type of release, which is, you know, because

375
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:33,240
they like to use Smash Brothers to promote all the virtual console stuff, clearly.

376
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,440
So what do you guys think about Ryu in Smash Brothers?

377
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,840
Dark Sakura, you loved Street Fighter, right?

378
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,480
Yeah, it was very pretty because the intro was like the Super Street Fighter II Turbo

379
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,480
opening.

380
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:54,320
Actually, no, not the Turbo opening, just the regular Super Street Fighter II.

381
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,800
And that one, the moment I was like, oh, happy.

382
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
I'm excited about it.

383
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,600
And then his level is level in the game.

384
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Yeah.

385
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,600
And his music's in there.

386
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Yeah.

387
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
Yeah.

388
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,560
Which I must say that that was probably my first video game crush was Ryu.

389
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,960
The funny thing, though, about that is that they don't have a Street Fighter game that

390
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,080
they've released on the Wii U.

391
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,320
Street Fighter IV is not coming in the Wii U, or V.

392
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,320
Here's the thing.

393
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,560
It's almost like, and I've seen them do this with other characters, it's like Mega Man.

394
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:32,560
Most people have the sentimental tie to it from Super Nintendo Street Fighter II, right?

395
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,580
And they do still have that on virtual console.

396
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:39,640
So you could argue that you can play Ryu on the Wii U, it's just, hey, I made a little

397
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,640
crime.

398
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,640
Ryu, Wii U.

399
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,680
And then to go along with that, of course, they have a new, well, they announced more

400
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,680
Amiibos.

401
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,080
So you're gonna have the Mii Amiibos as well.

402
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,560
Rob, the robot, is gonna be an Amiibo.

403
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,640
They even talked about, of course, Lucas.

404
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,700
And they even said Mewtwo was gonna be an Amiibo as well.

405
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:03,760
With that, though, the Mii fighters are getting more costumes as well, including stuff from

406
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:14,340
Virtua Fighter, Tekken, and Street Fighter II in there as well, Mega Man EXE, I saw that,

407
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:20,840
and then Mega Man X, because I know you could do Zero for the Sword Fighter.

408
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,840
Right.

409
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,680
Bobby, what are your thoughts on some of the news today?

410
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:29,480
I don't know if you're a big Smash Brothers player, but would Ryu maybe change your mind?

411
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,480
Maybe.

412
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,760
I mean, it was neat to see, and they're bringing Virtua Fighter costumes and stuff.

413
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,520
So I'll definitely hop in and maybe check it out, maybe buy the Ryu one.

414
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,640
Earthbound Beginnings, I'm gonna be running up once we're done tonight and gonna go play

415
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,880
that, because I did play the Earthbound Zero ROM a lot.

416
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,480
And I love Earthbound, it's much better than Super Metroid.

417
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:58,240
Yeah, no, it's kinda neat how they're taking the DLC thing and they really are extending

418
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,240
their games.

419
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,440
Mario Kart 8, they're doing it with Smash Brothers.

420
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,120
They are making amiibo for every Smash Brothers fighter, including three, four of the Miis.

421
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,200
So you got your Brawler Mi and the other two types of Miis.

422
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,320
Oh, that was Game & Watch was gonna be another amiibo.

423
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,120
And what's kinda weird about that one is they actually have different Game & Watch characters

424
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,360
you can snap in there.

425
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,360
That's kinda cool.

426
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,740
I like that if they're gonna whore this amiibo thing to death, which I'm worried they're

427
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,920
getting right, they're starting to teeter on that edge.

428
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:31,240
Speaking of which, I was gonna mention, along with that, they're also teasing 8-Bit Mario,

429
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:38,000
Animal Crossing, amiibo, and then other- See, and I'm worried that 8-Bit Mario unlocks

430
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,320
things in Mario Maker that are already on the disc, you know what I mean?

431
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:46,800
Like I'm just like, okay, I am starting, this is starting to get to that point.

432
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:54,600
8-Bit Mario, 8-Bit Mario, he unlocks the fuckin' Tenderworld Championship levels that you play.

433
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,080
What I'm hoping is that trophy, that the dude won, is an amiibo.

434
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,520
It might, it might be, we'll see.

435
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,760
A lot of folks in chat talking about the leak themselves, the fact that Ryu and Roy were

436
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,920
leaked to the internet a couple days ago, well actually just about yesterday, I think.

437
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:16,880
No, Ryu and Roy were leaked a while ago, that's- Oh, that's right, the files were leaked, but

438
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,080
then the actual footage was yesterday, but that's because there was a patch in Japan

439
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,400
or something that hackers gonna hack.

440
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,200
They got in there and pulled all the data.

441
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,520
So I see some folks in our chat room talking about, you know, I wish this stuff hadn't

442
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:33,880
leaked because it would have been such more of a OMG mic drop and then the ceiling opens

443
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:39,240
up and more mics drops type of moment for Nintendo, but unfortunately they lost that

444
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,600
and we're seeing a lot of that, we're seeing a lot of leaks this year at E3.

445
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,000
Can you drop mics in Mario Maker?

446
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,680
That might be, maybe that's what the trophy unlocks, or the amiibo unlocks.

447
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,680
We'll see.

448
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,680
We'll see.

449
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,840
What do you think about all these leaks, Loki?

450
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,880
Are hackers gonna leak?

451
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,880
I don't know.

452
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:02,600
Don't trust your valuable secrets to people that are gonna break your NDAs.

453
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:07,640
Or don't fucking send shit out in a pre-patch before you announce it.

454
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,360
You know what else RuPaul says, besides the quote we had earlier?

455
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:17,200
RuPaul also says this, maybe for this one, DarkSakura, trust no bitch.

456
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Maybe that's what-

457
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,820
And Nintendo should know that because I remember a couple years ago when they announced

458
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:28,060
the Wii U and actually announced the name of Wii U, they designed their booth with LCD

459
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:32,300
screens all around it so they didn't have to send the name or the logo of the Wii U

460
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,300
to printers.

461
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,300
Oh my gosh.

462
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,140
And all the actual hard copy signs said, New Nintendo Console.

463
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:41,820
And then they announced the name and then they had all the LCD screens in the booth

464
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,220
have the logo and all that stuff and all the branding.

465
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,180
Probably because no one would have believed how stupid the name was.

466
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:51,860
Alright, well we've got a whopping 10 minutes until Bethesda's gonna take the stage with

467
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,420
whatever they're announcing tonight, which we figure is probably around Fallout 4.

468
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,420
We know there's-

469
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,420
Doom.

470
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,420
A leak.

471
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,420
Yippee.

472
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,980
Speaking of leaks, we know Dishonored 2 is gonna be hitting there as well.

473
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,500
I thought that was rumored for a long time.

474
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,500
Yeah, it has.

475
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,500
So we're gonna find out.

476
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,940
But since we only have about 10 minutes, I wanna try and at least get a few of these

477
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,860
other big stories from the week out of what we can and what little time we have here.

478
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,820
And I wanna make sure Jamie gets at least two, three minutes to do the classic game

479
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,980
of the week as well.

480
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,980
Throw that out there.

481
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:21,260
So, Loki, why don't you give us one of the big stories that came up this week.

482
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,260
We'll talk about it quick.

483
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,820
So this one doesn't make any- well, I guess it makes sense, but YouTube.

484
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,660
They're gonna be doing YouTube gaming now.

485
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,720
It's own Twitch streaming service.

486
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:39,300
They also have a gaming app and yeah, it's a whole website dedicated to gaming.

487
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,900
I'm really excited for this because I've been saying for a long time Twitch needs a viable

488
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,820
competitor and I know you guys are like, hitbox, but the problem with these other sites is

489
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,340
that none of them have an app.

490
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,340
They're all like, you know, startups.

491
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,420
Yeah, but I'm still-

492
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:55,300
They're not really tied in, but YouTube has their paws in a lot of these places and they're

493
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,020
gonna roll out the gate with the app and everything.

494
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:02,220
So I feel like YouTube is the first viable competitor we're seeing to Twitch.

495
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,420
And they'll let you scream hatred, I'm sure.

496
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,380
Well, I don't know.

497
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,380
If you want.

498
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,880
Maybe, maybe not.

499
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,880
Maybe they won't feature it.

500
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,880
Who knows?

501
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,880
I don't know.

502
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,420
But with the whole YouTube stuff, the only thing that worries me, I have other concerns

503
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:19,640
about YouTube, such as the whole, you know, content ID matching and all that.

504
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:23,840
So I wonder how this whole, you know, if they're going to have the live element, how that is

505
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,400
going to, you know, come into play.

506
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,220
I feel like they don't do the content and copyright strike thing very well.

507
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:34,120
So I'd like to see how that's going to be improved, but I feel like competition will

508
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,280
make this a little better between the two because, you know, now they're going to be

509
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,280
competing for people to use this particular service.

510
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,280
I don't know.

511
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,200
Bobby, your thoughts?

512
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,200
Competition is good.

513
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,120
You can already stream live YouTube channels, like on the PS4 YouTube app.

514
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,660
So it's already on the consoles and everything.

515
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,840
So yeah, competition is good.

516
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,700
Dungeon Buster says, I like Twitch's reaction when they tweeted something like, Welcome

517
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,700
Player 2.

518
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,320
And I'm like, I bet Hitbox is out there going, ouch.

519
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,320
Yeah.

520
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,780
And actually, Tigerclaws corrected me in chat saying, Hitbox actually has an app.

521
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,440
And I'm not trying to like throw the shade and hate on Hitbox.

522
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,440
That's not what I'm doing.

523
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,720
Like, you know, props to them for trying, but I feel like their foot is not wedged in

524
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,320
the door the way that YouTube is.

525
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,920
You know, we know as well that YouTube tried to buy Twitch at one point and that didn't

526
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,920
work out.

527
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,920
Amazon got them.

528
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,760
So it's almost like this was always in Google's cards that they were going to have something

529
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,760
like this.

530
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,760
So here we go.

531
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,480
And, you know, you even go to things like PAX and I'm sure at E3 even, there's a Twitch

532
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,180
booth and a YouTube booth now.

533
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,560
You didn't see that three, four years ago.

534
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,640
You know, these guys regularly show up to these gaming conferences now, and now we're

535
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,160
going to have ourselves a little battle.

536
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,320
So this'll be, this'll be interesting.

537
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,720
Very interesting.

538
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,620
Another big announcement that came out this week was the fact that the Mega Man Legacy

539
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,880
Collection is going to be happening.

540
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:00,920
The Mega Man Legacy Collection was announced for the Nintendo 3DS, the PlayStation 4, the

541
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:06,520
PC and the Xbox One, but not the Wii U, which is interesting.

542
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,880
We'll put Miibos on there.

543
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,880
You got a Miibos.

544
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,500
But yet it's on the 3DS.

545
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,520
So I'm not, you can't say it's a technical thing.

546
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,920
You can't handle the power of Mega Man.

547
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,760
So I'm not sure what's up with that, and there's a lot of people that don't know what's up

548
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,760
with that.

549
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,480
But anyway, it's going to be coming out, I believe the price is somewhere around $15

550
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,760
is what we're looking at.

551
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,200
And it's going to feature the first six Mega Man games.

552
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,460
Now some of you, and I'm sure many of you actually even right now, are making that comparison

553
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:40,720
to the, what, the original Xbox and the PlayStation 2 and the GameCube release of the Mega Man

554
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,720
Museum.

555
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
I don't remember what they called it.

556
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:47,240
Just the Mega Man collection or something like that that came out that was the first

557
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,920
eight Mega Man games.

558
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:55,080
And if I remember right, it had the arcade fighter and all that stuff too.

559
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,640
So you're actually losing a few games with this newer collection.

560
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,200
However, some things to note, this is cheaper, although one could argue that you could find

561
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,440
a used copy of that old collection probably for just as much.

562
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,960
But it's also going to have a new museum mode and a challenge mode.

563
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:15,680
Challenge mode will have different gameplay segments from all six games, sounds a little

564
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,520
bit like NES Remix, but with the Mega Man games maybe.

565
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,320
And also I guess some type of like leaderboard will be there as well.

566
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:28,480
And what's also interesting about this is this is coming from, and the name of the company

567
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,000
escapes my mind, Digital Eclipse, is that the company that's putting this out?

568
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,060
I think it is.

569
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:38,020
And they've been kind of dormant for a little while and they've basically resurfaced with

570
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:46,200
this saying that their goal right now is to make the criterion collection of video games.

571
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:52,280
And so this is in some ways the first inductee into that very special collection of video

572
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,340
games.

573
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:57,540
So I'm interested.

574
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:03,700
I think it'll look better on the TV like the one I have now as opposed to hooking up the

575
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,780
old collection and playing it there.

576
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:10,740
I'm intrigued by some of this online and challenge mode and some of these extra things, but yeah,

577
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:14,420
they're going to have a big hill to kind of get over with the whole, why aren't these

578
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,260
other games there and so on.

579
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,960
Why isn't this running native 1080p?

580
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,500
Is this totally upscaled?

581
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,900
Well, I don't know.

582
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,860
Why can't Samus crouch?

583
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,860
What do you mean?

584
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,860
What do you mean it's cropped?

585
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,860
I can't see what they didn't.

586
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,860
They didn't fix it.

587
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,860
So you could do widescreen in this.

588
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,860
What's up with that?

589
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,860
I don't know.

590
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,860
We'll see.

591
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:40,860
Jamie, would you, would you pay 15 bucks for this type of collection on the PC?

592
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,860
I don't know.

593
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,860
No, no.

594
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,860
You have to see a little more.

595
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,860
Yeah.

596
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,860
Got to get your hands on with it.

597
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,860
I understand.

598
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,860
Why pay $15 when you could pay $2 on a Steam sale?

599
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,860
Exactly.

600
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:54,060
Bobby, you're going to pick this up?

601
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:59,820
No, I've never been very good at Mega Man, so I've already played him and lost.

602
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,420
Oh, and that's how it goes.

603
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,620
If you can't beat the demo, you don't buy the game, right?

604
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,620
That's right.

605
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,380
That's why I never bought Mega Man 9 or 10.

606
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,940
Oh, man.

607
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,940
Those were some hard demos.

608
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,220
All right, well, guys, we're coming up about on 7 o'clock.

609
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:15,940
We're going to have to take a break here because Nintendo chopped off the beginning of our

610
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,340
show, and now Bethesda's chopping off the middle here.

611
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,060
They're going to nuke it for more of it, if you will.

612
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:25,100
But you know, Jamie's got to get a word in edgewise here, people, and every week here

613
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,940
on the show, she likes to take us on a trip down memory lane.

614
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,260
You know what, Jamie, screw all this new shit.

615
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:35,180
All this stuff people are going to see this week, it don't matter.

616
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,180
It don't matter.

617
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,380
You've got a thousand games out there you can already play, right?

618
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,100
Yeah, and this one's old as balls.

619
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,860
So here it is, the classic game of the week.

620
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:47,260
Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey,

621
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,300
you should check this game out this week.

622
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,100
Screw all this newfangled shit.

623
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,580
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

624
00:30:54,580 --> 00:31:00,620
In honor of Bethesda's upcoming chat about stuff, I'm going back to something that kind

625
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,860
of started a lot of this for them.

626
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:09,980
Back to 1994, for PC-DOS, yes, I'm talking about Elder Scrolls Arena, the first in the

627
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:14,540
Elder Scrolls lineage, I should say.

628
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:20,540
So basically, it has a lot in common with its sequels, I mean, this one pretty much

629
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:25,460
laid the foundation of it, but you are playing from first person's perspective.

630
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:29,500
You have melee combat with your mouse, you can drag a cursor across the screen to attack.

631
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:34,700
You have magic with a menu and everything, and it's basically going around and going

632
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:45,540
to inns, farms, dungeons, killing creatures, doing story stuff, exploring, and it actually

633
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,040
was a pretty, I'd say a difficult one.

634
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:55,340
This one just was not really one of the easiest games I think I've ever played, but there

635
00:31:55,340 --> 00:32:00,500
is a little bit more of a story behind this one too.

636
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:11,500
Basically it has to deal with banishing an apprentice, the main baddy guy, banished his

637
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:20,500
apprentice to the, I guess, killed her pretty much, and her soul basically makes it through

638
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,660
and teaches you how to escape the dungeon and a bunch of other stuff, you have to rescue

639
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,580
the real emperor and lots of other stuff.

640
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:31,700
I didn't play too much of this one myself, but I figured I was going to bring it up just

641
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,980
because it's Bethesda.

642
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:40,420
And without this game, we wouldn't have Skyrim or Elder Scrolls Online, which was a big deal

643
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,420
this week.

644
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:45,220
But the biggest influence of this one, this was a really big thing I liked, was that they

645
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:57,580
thought that because it had been highly influenced by Ultima and by pen and paper roleplay games,

646
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:03,900
as well as just a few other type of first person games that had been out including Legends

647
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,080
of Valor.

648
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:11,100
So I'm only going to keep this one quick because I know we've got stuff coming up, so there

649
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,460
you go.

650
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:19,260
As far as any kind of releases on this, it came out Christmas Day 1994, well it was supposed

651
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:23,660
to, but then it got released on November 28th before the Christmas rush.

652
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:31,300
And it came out on CD-ROM and three and a half inch floppy disk, but the CD-ROM had

653
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:38,580
enhanced speech, different CG video sequences, and then in late 1994 it was re-released as

654
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:45,100
a deluxe edition with the CD-ROM with the latest patch, as well as a map of Tom Reel

655
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,700
and a big hint book.

656
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:54,700
And then it was later released in 2004 as freeware, but it was the three and a half

657
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,500
floppy disk version and not the CD-ROM.

658
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:02,660
And you may need a DOSBox to run it since it was a DOS based program.

659
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:08,420
And then later on in 2007, the CD-ROM version was released as a limited edition re-release

660
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:14,100
for PC, and it included DOSBox on it so you would have compatibility issues and it had

661
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,060
the same type of cover as Morrowind.

662
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,380
So there you go.

663
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:23,260
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week arena, Elder Scrolls.

664
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:29,220
There it is, we're at about seven o'clock and this has never happened to us, trying

665
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:33,180
to do a live OLR before, but we're being bumped by a press conference.

666
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:38,660
So we are going to take a break here while the Bethesda press conference begins and we'll

667
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,660
be back whenever it's over to wrap up and get your guys' thoughts.

668
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,700
Hey Bobby, thanks so much for joining us at the beginning of the show here.

669
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:48,700
I'm sorry that we didn't get to spend more time with you or that your own show got bumped,

670
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,620
but I'm glad we got to have a little chat.

671
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,740
It's always nice to come on this side of the fence.

672
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,580
It is, you should make it happen more often.

673
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:57,020
All right, take care my friend, we're gonna let you go while we go to break.

674
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,020
All right, see ya.

675
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,020
All right, see ya.

676
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:04,500
All right, and we'll be back after this to get your reactions to Bethesda and more when

677
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:12,620
Orange Lounge Radio returns.

678
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:18,040
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live with this E3 2015 special edition for

679
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,300
June the 14th of 2015.

680
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:25,140
For those of you listening on the podcast feed, you're probably like, wow, that went

681
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,140
by really fast.

682
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:30,900
But in real time, as we're live on this Sunday evening, a whole 90 minutes just went by as

683
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:35,460
we watch the Bethesda press conference here at Studio N7.

684
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,460
I do want to note, just because I never got around to housekeeping, because we've had

685
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,900
to move really fast tonight, you'll notice tonight's episode does not have an official

686
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:49,380
number designation, so we will resume with episode 602 next week, June the 21st of 2015,

687
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,220
since tonight's show is super abbreviated, we're having to cut a lot of corners, we're

688
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,420
not going to be able to do gaming week and probably a lot of our usual segments.

689
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:00,660
Some people don't know how to read a calendar and don't know when E3 starts, and it's like,

690
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,740
okay, E3's next week, you don't need to be doing all your press conferences like a week

691
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,740
in advance.

692
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,840
I know, I know, there's so much that it's spilling over into the day before.

693
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:14,500
DarkSakura actually had to leave, she has training going on at work, so she had to be

694
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,180
in early, so she knew she had to leave at 830, and once the press conference is going

695
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,380
on and on, you know, she realizes she has to leave.

696
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,980
She'll be back next week for episode number 602.

697
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:28,860
Meanwhile, though, with our E3 2015 special, since we did just watch the Bethesda press

698
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:32,060
conference and things are fresh in our mind, let's talk about our thoughts.

699
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:37,380
And in a little while, I will be opening up the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR or username

700
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:41,700
on Skype, Orange Launch Radio, so you guys can share your thoughts as well.

701
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,840
But first, let's talk here in studio.

702
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,500
So, Loki, what did you think overall Bethesda's first go at the press conference?

703
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,780
I thought it was pretty good.

704
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:52,060
The only weak point I think that was in there was Battlecry.

705
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:55,620
I think that just didn't look that interesting at all.

706
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,980
But everything else looked fine, you know, Fallout 4 looked great, Doom looked better

707
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,740
than I thought it was gonna, and Dishonored 2 was nice.

708
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:05,820
Battlecry is a holdover from last year, because that was one of the few games that Bethesda

709
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:11,700
had last year, when being at E3 last year, their booth only consisted of the evil within

710
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:16,180
in that game, Battlecry, which was for a lot of the Team Fortress elements.

711
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:20,620
I thought it was fun to play, I'll check out that beta when it goes out, especially

712
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:23,220
since they're using the free-to-play model.

713
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:29,220
But yeah, I think next to a lot of the other stuff they were showing, it kind of, you know,

714
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:34,980
it was a footnote, I think, compared to Doom, which I wasn't really expecting to care about.

715
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:40,900
You know, I used to love the old-school first-person shooters, like Doom, Quake, Wolfenstein, I

716
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,660
used to love those old-school games, but I don't know, they kinda, somewhere along the

717
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:47,620
way a lot of them lost me, and I played some here and there, like I get into Halo, you

718
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:52,420
know, but I gotta say that Doom looked really, really nice, like the graphics, obviously,

719
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,660
were astounding.

720
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:57,120
It had a lot of that nostalgic feel, like I think you pointed out, oh, the door noise

721
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,620
is the same from the old games, the little elevator and stuff.

722
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:06,460
But I thought what was really neat about that was the little big planetization of it, with

723
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,900
the, what was it, Snap Map, whatever they called it?

724
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:12,580
I thought that was the most interesting thing in the entire press conference.

725
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:16,740
Just the fact that they're opening up all these, you know, abilities for Doom, and the

726
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:21,940
fact that, okay, so you can have like a classic deathmatch, but you could also do like a Gears

727
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,340
of War, what do they call that, locust mode, or Mass Effect multiplayer?

728
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,340
Yeah, like a horde mode.

729
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:30,400
Yeah, where it's like, that's what it is, horde mode, where it's like co-op, you versus

730
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,660
all the demons, and you can like design that yourself.

731
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:38,660
I thought that was, especially if they have it in a way that you can kinda compare how

732
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:41,940
you do against your friends, and, you know, have things that you're working towards on

733
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:46,500
the leaderboard, I think that stands to be a really notable concept for me.

734
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,580
So I mean, that I think says a lot about a press conference, when it can take a game

735
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:55,040
that wasn't really on your radar, or you're feeling very passive, meh, there's a lot of

736
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,720
stuff fighting for my attention right now, and a press conference can put a game on your

737
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,300
radar like that, and I think they did a really good job with that, with Doom.

738
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:08,020
I gotta admit though, and I'm gonna take a lot of shit for this, but I'm ready for it,

739
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:13,740
I wasn't grabbed by Fallout 4 in the same way, which I know sounds ludicrous considering

740
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:19,980
how much is going on in that game, but I just, and I guess when I tried to play Fallout 3

741
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,880
before or whatever, like I just couldn't get into it the same way I can get into a Skyrim

742
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,740
game, and I can't put my finger on what it is that's not drawing me in, I feel like I

743
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:32,620
will kinda owe it to Fallout 4 to check it out eventually at some point, but I wasn't

744
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,340
like screaming my head off like those people in the audience for November time.

745
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:40,020
I'm hoping that a Fallout game like Fallout 4 though, the way it seems that you're brought

746
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:46,260
up in this, you know, Fallout 3, see I never played Fallout 3, and I have Fallout New Vegas

747
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:50,180
and I tried playing it, but I don't, like the premise to me it seems like that you're

748
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:54,420
a character already in this world, so you're kinda supposed to be familiar with everything,

749
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:59,340
whereas this is like, okay you've been, you know, locked in this vault for 200 years,

750
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,060
and you come out and you don't know anything.

751
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,820
You don't know what the hell's going on, and it's great because I don't know what the hell's

752
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,220
going on in the Fallout universe.

753
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:09,740
Now Bobby's voicing up in our chatroom, and I will reintroduce our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com

754
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:13,180
reminding us that Fallout New Vegas wasn't really a Bethesda game, so that might not

755
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:18,100
be the best game to base your judgements on, because that was, they contracted out with

756
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:21,340
a third party developer to try to keep the series going.

757
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:27,020
Well I did play Fallout 3, so I'm gonna tell you I'm not sure it is gonna change your opinion.

758
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:31,340
There are some neat things that the game does, and again I'm not like, I think there's always

759
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:35,060
these video games, and I do this all the time on OLR, there's a lot of video games

760
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,060
like this.

761
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,260
Before you brand me a hater or cynic or whatever, there's a lot of games where I stand back

762
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:43,820
and I look at it and I go, I bet that's a really awesome game for other people, and

763
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:47,500
I see why other people are into it, but eh, I'm not really into it.

764
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:52,220
Case in point, a lot of sports games for me, it's very rare I really get into a sports

765
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:55,500
game, but you know, when I see some of the, you know, previews and some of the things

766
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,560
that they do, you know, I understand how other people get into them, it's just, eh, not really

767
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,560
for me.

768
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,520
Honestly, I think Pokemon would be another really good example of that.

769
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,880
I get why people are so into Pokemon, but every time I try to sit down with it, I never

770
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,160
get past the first couple gyms, you know, it's just the way it is.

771
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,840
So, anyway, just my thoughts there.

772
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:20,160
At least I know Fallout 3 would run okay on my machine, because my machine's crap.

773
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,160
Yeah.

774
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,400
Let's see, so what else did they talk about?

775
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,280
They of course did their little, you know, it's out now mic drop, ceiling opens, hundreds

776
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,000
of mic, no, I guess it wasn't that big of a mic drop moment, but the whole little tablet

777
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,920
game that they were talking about with the Fallout Shelter, which looks really cute,

778
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,560
I'll certainly check that out, if nothing else, I like those tiny tower types of games.

779
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,720
I noticed a little shade thrown at second screen gaming experiences, what'd you think

780
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,720
of that?

781
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,040
He said that a lot of second screen gaming experiences are crap, and I was kinda like,

782
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,920
is that a dig at Wii U, or is that specifically the tablet types of games?

783
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:58,540
I think he's talking more like, I don't think he's digging at Wii U, I think he's talking

784
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:05,180
about stuff that Microsoft and PlayStation has as far as second screen stuff.

785
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:09,460
I don't think he's, you know, it seems like, yeah, and I do have to agree, a lot of it's

786
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:15,400
been crap, you know, just like, ooh, you have a map, or ooh, you could pick a song or something.

787
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,900
There's a part of me though that gets up there and says, you got a lot of balls criticizing

788
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:24,980
Nintendo when you just showed that you have a Donkey Kong clone in your little pip game

789
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:28,420
thing, which looked cute, I mean, don't get me wrong, I just, I was, so yeah, I'm

790
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:34,060
hoping that he just, you know, he just ran his mouth and was more targeting the tablet

791
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:37,900
based experiences and not so much maybe, you know, what Nintendo tries to do with the Wii

792
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:38,900
U.

793
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:42,140
Well, he clearly isn't talking about Nintendo because they're not getting Fallout, so, you

794
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:43,140
know.

795
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,140
Yeah.

796
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:48,460
Maybe they can run Fallout Vault, whatever that is, you know, the iPad game.

797
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,460
Yeah.

798
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:52,420
Act F agrees that that's more like tablet and mobile stuff.

799
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:55,620
Fifth Dream in our chat saying, PlayStation 4 doesn't even like, tell you when a game

800
00:42:55,620 --> 00:43:00,620
has second screen except maybe on the back of the box, Vidpower says, to be fair, he

801
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:06,020
also made it fun of themselves right after, so, there you go.

802
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:09,060
What do you think about them getting into the trading card game business with the Elder

803
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,060
Scrolls?

804
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:13,260
Man, I just don't care, it's not a genre that's interested, interesting to me at all, so.

805
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:16,060
You were hoping for Elder Scrolls Skyrim HD.

806
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:20,460
Well, they had clips of Skyrim, I, see, I wasn't sure if it was like a retrospective

807
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:25,140
like here's all these great games that we've made in the past, or here's some clips of

808
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:28,860
games we're going to be talking about today, you know, that type of thing.

809
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:32,060
And they had Dishonored, you know, I thought, okay, well, they have Dishonored, then maybe

810
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,500
they're going to have, you know, Skyrim.

811
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,460
Yeah, I mean, we're getting the Dishonored special edition, which is great for people

812
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,900
like me that didn't even check out the game the first time.

813
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:48,020
Maybe Skyrim thing will come later or something, or maybe it's, you know, I don't know, don't

814
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:50,460
want to detract from Fallout 4, I guess.

815
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,700
Perhaps, that could be very true as well.

816
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,700
Let's see.

817
00:43:55,260 --> 00:44:00,940
Talking about the limited edition Fallout 4, the little pip device that actually uses

818
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,940
your real smartphone.

819
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:07,940
I got to say, you know, again, I'm not super into Fallout, but when I saw that, I was like,

820
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,260
all right, that's pretty fucking rad.

821
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:17,180
Like if I was, you know, more into the series, I'd be like hitting up Amazon, how can I preorder

822
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,180
that right now?

823
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,180
Because that did look pretty badass.

824
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:24,460
Although, I have to wonder, does that only fit the like fives and sixes, iPhones and

825
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,460
the smaller androids?

826
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:26,460
Because I got a six plus.

827
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:27,460
Is that going to fit?

828
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,460
It's supposed to fit all phones.

829
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,460
All right, I hope so.

830
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,460
I mean, it doesn't matter.

831
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,780
I'm not going to really end up getting one, because I think it's going to be easily $100,

832
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:34,780
but...

833
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:37,540
Oh, well, just $100?

834
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,540
At least, at least.

835
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:39,540
I'm talking three digits.

836
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,700
That's probably like, I'm guessing that's like $200 right there.

837
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,780
Well, it's just a shell for your smartphone.

838
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,900
It's not an actual, you know...

839
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,100
Yeah, I understand that.

840
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,980
I understand it's just a shell or a statue or whatever.

841
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:53,120
They have that type of stuff, but those are expensive.

842
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:57,840
Just like what, Titanfall had a fucking statue in that shit, and it was fucking expensive.

843
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:58,840
I don't know.

844
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,840
I just expected the expensive.

845
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:00,840
All right.

846
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,600
Well, we'll get all your guys' thoughts on the Bethesda press conference just a little

847
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,600
later.

848
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,080
For now, though, we want to just touch on a few stories that...

849
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,920
I may have to buy Fallout 3.

850
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,880
I have been buying lots of stuff on Steam sale.

851
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:12,880
You know what?

852
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,040
There is a Steam sale going on right now, as you know about, for sure, and maybe now

853
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,980
is the great time to pick up Fallout 3.

854
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:21,360
You know, we didn't talk about our gaming weeks, because we've had no time, but I don't

855
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,040
know about you, but I succumbed to that Steam sale.

856
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,760
I bought Cities Skyline, which is that...

857
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:33,540
This is the game that SimCity should've been, but I've played maybe 15 minutes of it, so

858
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:37,760
I'm not in any position to tell you about the game, but I definitely see, like, wow,

859
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,520
there's some strong SimCity parallels here.

860
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:44,360
I bought some stuff for my son to play with me with.

861
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:49,240
So I bought Lego Batman 2, because, you know, I've been talking to him about that, because

862
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:51,080
he's kind of getting bored of Lego Marvel superheroes.

863
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:55,320
We beat it, like, a long time ago, and, you know, this game is similar to that, because

864
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,520
it has an open world and everything, so I bought that for him and for me to play.

865
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,440
And then I also bought Lego Movie, the video game, because we watched part of the Lego

866
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,320
Movie, and I like the movie, and it's awesome, and the game's, like, five bucks, so I was

867
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,320
like, you know, whatever.

868
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,120
And then I bought some other stuff, too.

869
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,120
I've been...

870
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,680
You know what I've been playing a lot of?

871
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,680
I know.

872
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:15,680
Shocking.

873
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,040
I've been, like, playing a lot of their clicker game on there.

874
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,720
Oh, their little, um, for the sale?

875
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,720
The clicker game for the sale?

876
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,400
Yeah, I've been playing that a lot.

877
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,400
It's a little laggy.

878
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,320
Like, I love the concept of a thousand people all playing it at once, but, like, I notice

879
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,640
I'll click something, and all of a sudden, the health bar's like, whoo!

880
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:35,240
Like, it's got some technical challenges, but it was a clever little thing for a sale.

881
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,240
I gotta say.

882
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,240
I'm trying to think of whatever else I bought.

883
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:43,520
I mean, I actually have to literally look at my stupid list here of what I bought.

884
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:51,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

885
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,840
use the passphrase, net.

886
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:54,840
I don't know.

887
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,400
I bought a few other things, too.

888
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,880
Oh, Castle Crashers, because that was dirt cheap.

889
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:05,640
I bought that, and then, what else did I buy?

890
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,640
I don't remember.

891
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:11,040
But, yeah, I know I bought the two LEGO games, because, I don't know, they're kind of addicti-

892
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:16,640
Oh, Command & Conquer Red Alert 3, because I love Command & Conquer Red Alert, and that

893
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,760
was pretty cheap.

894
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:23,640
And they had, you know, was it that ten-level, four-level thing that came from that Humble

895
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:29,120
Bundle with EA, and I just wanted the full game, so I was like, okay, I'll do it.

896
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,440
More comments from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

897
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,120
Kaijuto says, Bethesda may have just won E3, that was so freakin' good.

898
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,520
Dungeon Buster saying, Fallout 3 is good, just be sure to get it with all the DLCs since

899
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,120
one of those actually gives you a real ending.

900
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:46,440
VidPower in chat says, I'm ashamed to admit that I've never played any Fallout games.

901
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,820
Don't be afraid to admit that.

902
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:52,120
It's like me coming out and being afraid to say, I don't have the same feelings the rest

903
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,120
of you do to it.

904
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:57,360
I never played through Oblivion all the way, or at least, if I did, actually I may have,

905
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,320
it was a long time ago.

906
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:04,820
There is no time to play every single, unless you're getting paid to do it, there is not

907
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:08,200
enough time to play every single critically lauded game start to finish.

908
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,160
I would even think, even if you are paid to do it, there's just not enough hours in

909
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:14,560
the day if you're exploring every nook and cranny of every critically lauded game.

910
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,800
So you do have to pick and choose a little bit.

911
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,880
And if you play any MMOs, then that just cuts your hours even more.

912
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,640
I'm gonna wait and see if this gets on sale even more, because it's only 40 or 50% off

913
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,720
right now, so.

914
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:32,560
MegamanX400 in chat says, we can't call E3 winners yet.

915
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,200
Let's put it this way, they've started off pretty strong.

916
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,200
Stop it!

917
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,960
I mean, this was definitely better than the Oculus little thing, but.

918
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,320
This was the best E3 Sunday ever.

919
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:47,640
In fact, this is the first E3 Sunday ever, but between the Nintendo stuff this morning

920
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,640
and Bethesda.

921
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:53,000
Well, let's put it this way, they have, you know, I'm expecting great things from Microsoft

922
00:48:53,000 --> 00:49:00,680
and from EA, okay, maybe not so much from EA, but Microsoft and, you know, Sony, Nintendo,

923
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,260
I'm expecting great things from them, so hopefully we'll see that.

924
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:08,780
And Ubisoft, Ubisoft has been rocking it, like, each year, it seems like, so I'm looking

925
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:11,900
forward to having some great announcements from them as well.

926
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:16,420
However, I mean, Watch Dogs was kind of a letdown, although, I can't even really say

927
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:19,780
that, you know what, it sounded like a letdown, I have to fucking give myself, I haven't played

928
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:22,300
it yet, so I don't know.

929
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:26,780
But like, I'm not as excited, like, about Watch Dogs, or I wasn't as excited about the

930
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:32,500
crew at, when originally those sounded really awesome, and I don't really give a shit about

931
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:35,780
their Tom Clancy game that they have coming, well, both Tom Clancy games that they have

932
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:41,060
coming out, I just don't care about those, so I don't know.

933
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:45,460
And I'm sure we'll see another fucking Just Dance game, it's just gonna be, whatever.

934
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:49,320
Bobby's reminding me in chat that Connect had that big event during OLR a few years

935
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:53,420
ago, hashtag space ponchos, that's right, because then they do it twice, they did it

936
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:57,420
twice, it was weird that year, they did one on Sunday and one on Monday, and like, it

937
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:02,100
was like a repeat, I don't know, anyway, so I guess it wasn't the first E3 Sunday ever,

938
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,700
but the first in a long time, okay?

939
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,700
Calm down.

940
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:11,620
Alright, so it's gonna be a fun week, it is gonna be a fun week, and I'm sad I have to

941
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:16,200
work tomorrow, I gotta pay the bills, I gotta pay the bills, but I'll be looking for my

942
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:20,700
bullet point list of what I missed at Microsoft and what trailers I have to view, and then

943
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:25,300
whatever fucking Mass Effect came out, give me the Mass Effect, get it all right now.

944
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:29,440
I will be watching the live blogs because I have to take phone calls so I can't actually

945
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:35,480
stream it like I used to, whereas at work, you know, previous employers, that was considered

946
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:40,320
part of my job, so I would literally get up from my desk, go to a conference room and

947
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:46,200
stream that shit on a big fucking TV, because I made the excuse for myself to do that, because

948
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,840
my boss wasn't there anyways, because he'd be at E3, and I'd be like, no one's gonna

949
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:50,840
tell me not to.

950
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:54,960
But I like that Sony is at night, because then I can come home and watch the Sony thing

951
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,240
on my PS4 and it'll be just fine.

952
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,680
And there's always YouTube later, and a lot of times, you know, you're just really watching

953
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:05,840
for trailers and gameplay video and stuff, I mean, and that's all gonna be up later on,

954
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,840
so it's not a big deal.

955
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,400
I hope the PlayStation thing isn't like three hours long this year, they had a long show

956
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:15,080
last year, and it was different when you're there, it doesn't seem to crawl as much, but

957
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,600
when you're not there, it can drag.

958
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:24,600
All I ask is if they don't waste time on things, like, keep your gameplay demos somewhat short,

959
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:30,000
like even Doom 1 seemed kinda long, I understand why, I mean, they're teasing each other's

960
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:35,800
weapons and stuff, but it seemed long, and I just, I hope that, you know, they kinda

961
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,200
shorten that stuff down a bit.

962
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:43,440
Like Nintendo, especially Nintendo, we don't need you to explain how the gameplay elements

963
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,860
work and stuff, just show us the fucking gameplay.

964
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:50,200
If you wanna explain how that shit works, you can save that for the fucking Nintendo

965
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,600
treehouse shit.

966
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,880
Alright, let's move on, let's try to cover some of the other news that's come up in the

967
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,720
past week, we're gonna improvise a little bit here, cuz Loki and I are pretty much having

968
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:03,880
to make up a show as we go tonight, with Dark Sakura having left, and we lost an hour we

969
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:08,920
thought we'd have, so, since you brought up Steam, I'll talk about this with Valve, and

970
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:12,480
then Loki, I know you had a Valve marked thing, maybe you wanna bring that up, I don't know,

971
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,680
but I wanna talk about this because, you know, with the Steam sale going on, there's a little

972
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:20,400
bit of controversy going on with that, that apparently some developers and publishers

973
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,360
are hiking up their prices.

974
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:28,840
In fact, Bethesda being called out as one of them, that Wolfenstein The New Order apparently

975
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:37,240
was hiked up from $45 to $60, then went on sale half off for $30.

976
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:44,160
It's not just Bethesda, Ubisoft took Assassin's Creed Black Flag from $29.99 to $39.99, and

977
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:48,620
then there was a 40% off sale, so it goes down to $23.99.

978
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:55,000
And then, Grand Theft Auto 5 also being pointed out because what they did, they jacked up

979
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:02,140
the price of the game to $80, but they did it with a card, they gave you consumables.

980
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:08,060
All they're doing is, well, a couple things, they're putting it out with one of their stupid

981
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:16,020
shark cards, so basically what they're doing is giving you a free DLC or free in-game item,

982
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:20,580
money in the game, but the game's still the same price as it normally is because they

983
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:23,420
can do that, it's digital goods, it doesn't cost them anything.

984
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:24,420
So really, that's what they're doing.

985
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:26,940
So it's not really a discount.

986
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:31,420
The other thing, though, that someone was saying, and I'm not really sure how the details

987
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:35,780
work on this, but they were saying that because of the fact that it's put out there with a

988
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:43,980
piece of consumable, an in-app purchase, if you will, you can't refund the game, per the

989
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,460
Steam rules.

990
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:50,540
I'm not sure if that's the case, but then also I come up to the conclusion of, why would

991
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:51,540
you want to do that?

992
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:56,740
Because it's Grand Theft Auto 5 and it's amazing, there's no reason why you would need to return

993
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:58,740
the game, it is amazing.

994
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:03,540
Well there you go, so some people kind of push in those Steam, I mean, there's nothing

995
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:07,900
wrong with what they're doing, and technically in retail a lot of this stuff happens too,

996
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:08,900
is that, you know...

997
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:14,980
I think they forget that there are websites that do track the price changes, and people

998
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:17,940
are going to catch on to your shit.

999
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:18,940
Just be honest with it.

1000
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:23,700
I mean, if you're going to mark it down 10%, mark it down 10%, a la Witcher 3.

1001
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,260
At least they were pretty honest with it.

1002
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:31,940
Hey, I'll take a 10% discount versus you jacking the price up and making it seem like it's

1003
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:38,540
more of a discount, because I'll be like, wait a second, wasn't this just $44 last week?

1004
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,540
I mean, I don't know.

1005
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:46,500
Alright, did you want to talk about maybe the Dota 2 thing, since that's also Valve?

1006
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:53,820
Sure, so they're going to have Dota 2 Reborn, I guess they're going to make it easier to

1007
00:54:53,820 --> 00:55:01,900
play the game, and it's going to be a new client for Dota 2, and they're going to allow

1008
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:07,500
people to spectate Dota 2 a little bit easier as well as play it even easier.

1009
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:13,820
And they're going to have some new features to Dota TV, including new DVR-style pause

1010
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:26,260
and rewind, also broadcasting in 1080p 60fps streams, and I guess they're saying they're

1011
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:28,620
upgrading their chat room.

1012
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:34,060
So basically trying to up the quote-unquote quality of their MOBA that's really not even

1013
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:38,340
that old anyway, but I always thought they had a pretty good tutorial in that game, but

1014
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:41,780
there's a lot more micromanaging that happens in Dota compared to a game like Heroes of

1015
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:42,780
the Storm.

1016
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:49,980
New tutorials, and they're saying guided bot matches.

1017
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,860
But then there's something else with that, right?

1018
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:56,460
All our fascinations with Gabe walking out on stage and dropping the mic, not going to

1019
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,460
happen, right?

1020
00:55:57,460 --> 00:56:02,220
No, I don't believe that's going to be the case.

1021
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:08,980
Just because they're saying they're not taking meetings for any upcoming products is what

1022
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:10,140
they said.

1023
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:11,140
So they're like...

1024
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:12,140
That doesn't fucking mean anything.

1025
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,140
They're not at E3.

1026
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:17,540
We don't need to fucking meet with you people to talk about Half-Life 3, okay?

1027
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:21,580
I thought he was supposed to be there though at the PC gaming thing, I thought Valve was

1028
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:22,580
part of that.

1029
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:23,580
I thought so too, but I don't know.

1030
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,840
So who gives a shit?

1031
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:29,780
You don't need to fucking take meetings for that stuff, you could arrange that shit later

1032
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:30,780
on.

1033
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:31,780
And I think it's probably...

1034
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,260
I mean, come on.

1035
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:34,260
Come on.

1036
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:37,660
You can't tell me that if they were going to be taking meetings for some upcoming products

1037
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:40,460
that that shit wouldn't leak out in a heartbeat.

1038
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:45,500
I mean, it's like, yeah, hey guys, we're taking meetings for Half-Life 3.

1039
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:48,920
No, you can't tell me that won't leak out.

1040
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,300
No one is not breaking the NDA on that shit.

1041
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:55,060
You get the exclusive story that Half-Life 3 is fucking confirmed.

1042
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:56,620
I mean, come on.

1043
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:57,620
That is why.

1044
00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:01,620
I would completely distrust any of the journalists out there with that shit.

1045
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:03,700
So I don't expect them to...

1046
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,220
I don't think that this necessarily means anything.

1047
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:11,140
I think it's just, yeah, they're not going to have a booth there.

1048
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:16,480
They're not going to be taking press meetings about their games, but it doesn't mean they

1049
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,980
won't announce anything.

1050
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:20,100
All right.

1051
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:23,180
Well, let's move on.

1052
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:27,580
I guess we'll do a couple more stories and I think we'll open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAMO-LR.

1053
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:30,140
Or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

1054
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:33,180
So Loki, you want to just pick one other story you think is worth mentioning here?

1055
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:34,180
Sure.

1056
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:36,100
Let's talk about amiibos some more.

1057
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:42,900
And this is actually from one of the executives that's in charge of the team that produces

1058
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:47,660
Disney Infinity, John Viganocci.

1059
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:51,940
He's basically saying this whole shortage of bullshit is ridiculous.

1060
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:55,860
You know, they're saying it...

1061
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:58,820
This is, I guess, part of an interview that they had with Game Informer.

1062
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:03,200
It is, given the turbulent release of amiibo characters, are you doing anything to prepare

1063
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,700
for the high demand of Star Wars figures?

1064
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:10,340
And he replied, there is never an intention to create a shortage of any figures.

1065
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:13,980
It isn't irresponsible and rude to your hardcore fans.

1066
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:16,680
They don't want to create frustration or the hunt.

1067
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,100
So they will be stocking the shelves well.

1068
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:25,740
And I gotta say, from my experience with dealing with retailers and stuff, Disney was

1069
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:31,460
probably the easiest when it came to ordering this kind of bullshit.

1070
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:32,740
And I'll tell you why.

1071
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:38,940
And it's because, previously, before this whole amiibo stuff was happening, it was Skylanders

1072
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:40,820
and fucking Disney Infinity.

1073
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:47,180
And Skylanders, well, the way they create shortages is it's all fucking random.

1074
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:51,500
So you can't order specific, like, if I'm out of this specific character, I can't fucking

1075
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:54,100
order that specific character from Activision.

1076
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:57,460
I just have to order some of these, I just have to order some of these single character

1077
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:00,420
packs and hope to God that I get what I'm looking for.

1078
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:01,760
Or I can get a bunch of fucking comps.

1079
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,380
It's literally blind packs, which is ridiculous.

1080
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:08,860
And I think that is how a lot of the toy industry works, but Disney's not like that.

1081
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:13,620
You're out of fucking Mickey, you order Mickey, you get Mickey, that's it, done.

1082
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:19,540
The only bullshit that they have, and to be honest, all three of these Disney, Nintendo,

1083
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:22,900
and Activision do this shit, is the fucking retailer exclusives.

1084
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,740
And that's about it, and it's time with this shit.

1085
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:30,820
So they're all kind of on an even playing field there, but yeah.

1086
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:34,940
Disney knows how to fucking manufacture toys, and this isn't new for them, that's why they

1087
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:40,380
have a better handle on it than Activision and Nintendo, who just kind of got into this

1088
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:41,380
industry.

1089
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:42,380
Yeah.

1090
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:43,380
And this is their own retail.

1091
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:46,060
I mean, Disney has stores in the mall, Disneyland, Disney World.

1092
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:47,820
Yeah, they fucking know how to manufacture toys.

1093
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:52,460
This is like, yeah, we've been manufacturing toys for a long time now, and Nintendo and

1094
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:55,740
fucking Activision are just getting into this shit.

1095
00:59:55,740 --> 01:00:00,040
They're only a few years old into it, Nintendo even less than that, and so that's why they're

1096
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,220
having all this hiccup shit.

1097
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:07,180
It's because, I don't know where exactly they manufacture half this stuff for Disney, but

1098
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:11,180
I'm pretty sure that they know how to make sure that stuff is in stores.

1099
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:16,820
Now, don't get me wrong, they're not immune to shortages, but they're usually quick to

1100
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:18,820
recover from it.

1101
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:22,340
ActDeft in chat over at live.vognetwork.com saying, a reasoning behind why Disney can

1102
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:26,520
put any Disney Infinity figurine is that they have the shitload of money to do so.

1103
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:29,980
Not to mention, they're probably really easy and cheap to produce.

1104
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:33,460
Rama saying that Disney doesn't run their retail stores, the Children's Place runs all

1105
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,460
the Disney stores.

1106
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:40,220
And I would still argue, when it's carrying Disney's name, there's probably some different

1107
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:43,100
relationships than you would see elsewhere in the industry.

1108
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:45,860
But that's a fair point, anyway.

1109
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:49,100
So anyhow, let's see.

1110
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:52,480
I'm going to do a quick story here about Street Fighter V, which is going to get a lot of

1111
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,500
attention at E3 in this coming week, I'm sure.

1112
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:59,140
Sure this will be a big deal at Capcom's booth for people that are there.

1113
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:05,420
Street Fighter V, of course, coming to PlayStation 4 and PC, but not going to be coming to Xbox

1114
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:06,420
One.

1115
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:09,820
Now, there's been a lot of us saying, oh, sure, Street Fighter V doesn't come to Xbox

1116
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:13,460
One, but Super Street Fighter V, or Street Fighter V Turbo, or Street Fighter V Special

1117
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:18,380
Edition, Street Fighter V Part II, whatever you want to call it, the inevitable will come

1118
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:19,820
out for Xbox One.

1119
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:24,700
But based on some comments this week that a Capcom representative said to GameSpot,

1120
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:25,700
maybe not.

1121
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,740
Quote, the reality is that this is a real partnership.

1122
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:33,300
We are console exclusive for this franchise, for this numbered run.

1123
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:36,580
The relationship with Sony does open doors for things we haven't been able to do in the

1124
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:37,580
past.

1125
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:41,420
The relationship serves as a gameplay and development purpose and not just a marketing

1126
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:42,420
value.

1127
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:48,100
Hmm, I wonder if this is Capcom really holding firm on this whole Microsoft, you fucking

1128
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,900
did this to yourself when you wouldn't allow cross play.

1129
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:56,820
So you know, and I have to admit, the no cross play thing on Microsoft, I don't think is

1130
01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:57,820
doing him any favors.

1131
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:02,200
I think as far as Elder Scrolls Online, since we just watched Bethesda go, I think that

1132
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:06,340
really sucks that it's separated for Xbox One and PlayStation.

1133
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:11,340
Now granted, I get that even if it's separate from PlayStation and PC, yes, it is.

1134
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:15,420
They're all separated, which I was probably a Bethesda decision since one had to be separated

1135
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:16,980
that I'll be separated.

1136
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:21,300
But I can see also that the voice chat thing would lend some complications.

1137
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:25,420
Like you wouldn't be able to have voice chat across Xbox One and PlayStation.

1138
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:28,020
So I get you might have some other difficulties there.

1139
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:33,100
But if these other MMOs like Final Fantasy 11, Final Fantasy 14, if they can do it, you

1140
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:36,100
know, I don't see why Elder Scrolls Online couldn't do it.

1141
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:40,620
So I just think I think Microsoft really needs to reevaluate that policy.

1142
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:42,780
But you know, whatever.

1143
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:45,740
This is this is what it's it's coming to.

1144
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:46,920
So we'll see.

1145
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:51,460
And Sony and Nintendo apparently allowed cross play between their consoles with some game.

1146
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:58,460
I don't remember what game that was, where Sony and Nintendo actually worked together

1147
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:00,900
between the two.

1148
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:03,100
What was it?

1149
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:11,900
I guess it was pure chess is the game they're calling out of all things interesting.

1150
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:14,220
The one game that no one bought.

1151
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,360
Yeah, right.

1152
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:20,060
So anyhow, so but I wouldn't expect Street Fighter five on the Wii U anytime soon.

1153
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:21,060
Just saying.

1154
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:22,060
Let's do it.

1155
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:26,380
Let's open up the Skype line 1877 game OLR or username on Skype orange lounge radio.

1156
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:29,500
If you want to give us a call, we'll talk about whatever you might want to say about

1157
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:34,600
Bethesda's press thing or any general E3 thoughts, things you might be looking forward

1158
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,340
to in this next week.

1159
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:41,520
I apologize due to the time tonight, I'm going to have to cut out a few of our regular segments.

1160
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,780
No rapid fire news, no.

1161
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:45,060
I'm actually going to skip foogle.

1162
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:46,060
I apologize.

1163
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:50,780
I know a lot of you guys answered on Facebook and Google Plus this week, but just incentive

1164
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:53,940
to go check those community communities out if you're not already on them.

1165
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:58,700
Facebook dot com slash orange lounge radio and Google dot com slash plus orange lounge

1166
01:03:58,700 --> 01:03:59,700
radio.

1167
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:01,260
And if you're mad, well, be mad at Nintendo.

1168
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:05,700
They ran in 30 minutes over tonight than they were supposed to finish.

1169
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:11,580
So again, the Skype line is open 1877 game OLR or username on Skype orange lounge radio.

1170
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:16,220
Loki, you want to pull one of these other stories here while we wait for a call?

1171
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:17,220
Sure.

1172
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:21,260
So apparently Metal Gear Solid five is going to have some sort of microtransactions.

1173
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:25,060
They're basically calling them optional game purchases.

1174
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:29,980
And some of the examples they're saying may include the ability to create your own emblem

1175
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:31,820
in the game.

1176
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:36,980
So not necessarily anything that's going to, you know, help you win the game and just,

1177
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:39,500
you know, customization stuff.

1178
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,500
Hmm.

1179
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:41,500
Gotcha.

1180
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:45,380
I see maybe more like decoys, maybe still they're going down that path.

1181
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:46,440
Well, it's Konami.

1182
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:47,440
They're going down that.

1183
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,440
Well, what's Konami got now?

1184
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:49,440
Let's go to the phones.

1185
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:50,440
Hi.

1186
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,440
You're on orange lounge radio.

1187
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,440
Who's this?

1188
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:53,440
Hi.

1189
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,440
This is Reginator.

1190
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:57,560
What's on your mind tonight?

1191
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,560
Not too much.

1192
01:04:58,560 --> 01:04:59,560
Yeah.

1193
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:05,400
Just to touch on the sales that have been going on.

1194
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:12,920
I just want to get your overall opinion on both the GOG sale and the Steam sale.

1195
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:16,520
What are your general feelings and thoughts about those sales?

1196
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:19,440
Well, who doesn't love a sale, dammit?

1197
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,600
I'm excited to see the sales on both sides.

1198
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:24,800
I did actually end up participating in the GOG sale myself.

1199
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:31,000
I bought an old-school PC game that I remember playing the shit out of when I first got a

1200
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,520
CD-ROM in my computer.

1201
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:36,440
And the game is called Castles 2.

1202
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:40,160
And it was on GOG, and it was even on sale for like, I don't know, four bucks.

1203
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:43,520
It's actually the CD-ROM version that you download, and so it actually has some of the

1204
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:46,320
little cheesy CD-ROM movies and things in it.

1205
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:50,080
So I thought that was really cool, and I bought that, and then that gave me the free SimCity

1206
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:52,600
2000, which I thought was a nice little bonus.

1207
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:54,680
So I participated in that sale.

1208
01:05:54,680 --> 01:06:00,800
And then I think I mentioned over on Steam, I bought the Cities Skyline, and that was

1209
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:03,080
on sale from 30 bucks to 20 bucks, I think.

1210
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:06,760
So I haven't been able to play a whole lot of that, but I'm encouraged by what I see

1211
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:07,760
so far.

1212
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:11,520
So I participate in both those sales, keeping my eye on Humble Bundle, too, because they've

1213
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,160
got a lot of sales going on.

1214
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:19,540
So E3 is video game Christmas for a lot of people, so there's going to be a lot of sales

1215
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:22,460
to match that as well.

1216
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:25,020
I think the other thing, too, is that Steam minigame.

1217
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:29,980
I think it's been a while since we've seen Steam do something a little extra for a sale,

1218
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:31,860
beyond just the trading card thing.

1219
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:36,220
Like I feel like we haven't gotten a little something extra extra during a sale in a while,

1220
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:41,420
so even though the game, the clicker game is a little bit, eh, buggy, I applaud them

1221
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:42,980
for trying to do something a little different.

1222
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:45,140
Played 120 levels of it the other day.

1223
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:46,140
Oh my god.

1224
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:51,100
I got in right at 9 a.m. yesterday, right, and I must have gotten some game with some

1225
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:56,080
uber players, because by the end of the day, or by the time it was over, I was on level

1226
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,080
like 1,758.

1227
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,900
It was something crazy.

1228
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:00,900
So yeah.

1229
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:03,380
It sucks that they reset your stats, though, each time.

1230
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:07,940
Yeah, but it seems like you get the trading card, you get one trading card for just checking

1231
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:13,560
it out, and then you get another for, I guess, playing it for maybe 20 minutes or something.

1232
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:16,320
So you can get a lot of cards that way.

1233
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:22,520
Brak, the man in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says Steam will never top that potato ARG

1234
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:23,640
for Portal 2.

1235
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:24,640
That was pretty amazing.

1236
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:27,960
That was the one that, wasn't that the one that culminated in the early release of the

1237
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,000
game on Steam or something like that?

1238
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:35,320
It did, because you had to like play different games that had Portal stuff in it, and had

1239
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:40,080
a potato stuff, and I guess playing those games would help count down the timer or something

1240
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,480
like that, and it would release it earlier.

1241
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:49,400
So, RageNator, you mentioned you hadn't bought anything in the Steam sale yet.

1242
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:50,400
Is there a reason for that?

1243
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,280
Is there something you're waiting for?

1244
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,280
What's your thoughts on the Steam sale?

1245
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:59,720
Well, I kind of blew my load, financially speaking, on the GOG sale.

1246
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:00,720
Ew.

1247
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:01,720
Okay.

1248
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:02,720
All right.

1249
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:03,720
Fair enough.

1250
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:09,280
Yeah, I kind of went nuts on the GOG sale.

1251
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:13,840
I bought a little bit too much, or a little bit more than I should have.

1252
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:17,000
He meant the load of cash in his bank account, everybody.

1253
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
That's what he meant.

1254
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
He meant a load of cash, everybody.

1255
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Yeah.

1256
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Yeah.

1257
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:30,160
Including the free games I meant to get through there, I got like 30 games through the GOG

1258
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:31,160
sale.

1259
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:32,160
Wow.

1260
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:38,360
Well, you're not even checking out the clicker heroes inspired minigame on Steam, getting

1261
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:41,280
your cards or whatever, or nah, not for you?

1262
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:48,640
I tried to, but I couldn't get into it, so I kind of assumed that the way the game was

1263
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:54,840
explained to me, you hit the craft badge first, then get into the game, collect more cards.

1264
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:56,380
No, you don't need the badge first.

1265
01:08:56,380 --> 01:08:57,380
You can get in there.

1266
01:08:57,380 --> 01:09:00,040
If it doesn't work for you, try to join a friend's game.

1267
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:03,440
That was the only way I was able to get it to work the first time, is I joined a friend's

1268
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:07,600
game instead of doing my own game, and then it worked for some reason, so keep hammering

1269
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:08,600
at it.

1270
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:09,600
Yeah.

1271
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,600
You're right.

1272
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:19,840
Yeah, no, in regards to the Steam sale, might be able to buy something once they, you know,

1273
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:23,200
will have to be like dirt cheap, like under $10, so.

1274
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,360
Well, there's a lot of indie stuff.

1275
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,320
Keep your eye out, because there's a lot of indie games that are coming down to like two

1276
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:34,440
or three bucks, because especially the stuff that's rewards from people's participation

1277
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:37,960
in the clicky game, that's pretty much nothing but indie stuff.

1278
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:42,960
I've seen a few AAA games in there, but mostly indie stuff, so, and those get really, really

1279
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:43,960
cheap.

1280
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:44,960
Raise your hand.

1281
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:45,960
I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls.

1282
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:46,960
All right, buddy?

1283
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:47,960
Thanks for calling in, though.

1284
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:48,960
Sure.

1285
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:49,960
Take care.

1286
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:50,960
Have a nice night.

1287
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:51,960
Bye.

1288
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:52,960
Bye-bye.

1289
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:53,960
1-877-GAME-OLR.

1290
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:54,960
Our username on Skype.

1291
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:55,960
Orange Lounge Radio.

1292
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,960
Loki, you want to pull another one of these, or?

1293
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:58,960
Sure.

1294
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,600
You know, it's kind of funny, looking at this, like, recommended list from Steam about games

1295
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:06,480
I should buy, and most of them are saying in-library.

1296
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:07,940
I have a problem.

1297
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:08,940
You have a big problem.

1298
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:09,940
I have a problem.

1299
01:10:09,940 --> 01:10:11,760
We actually have another call coming in right now, so let's get to it.

1300
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:12,760
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1301
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:13,760
Who's this?

1302
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:14,760
Hey, this is Akdeaf.

1303
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:15,760
Hey, Akdeaf, buddy.

1304
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:16,760
What's on your mind?

1305
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,360
Well, let's talk about the usual.

1306
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,000
I talk about Amiibos.

1307
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,880
That's the main thing now.

1308
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:22,880
That's your thing now.

1309
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:27,640
I was going to say, I saw, I did happen to catch, was that they showed off what Ryu looks

1310
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,840
like when Kirby sucks him up.

1311
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:30,840
Oh, yeah.

1312
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:31,840
I love the hair.

1313
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:36,600
Yeah, I got the DLC today, and yeah, that's pretty awesome.

1314
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:39,080
In Dreamland 64, that's pretty awesome.

1315
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,400
Did you see my sexy picture on Twitter?

1316
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:44,280
Shout out to my Twitter, at SKIE, Sky on Twitter.

1317
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:46,480
You see my sexy picture with my new NES Amiibo?

1318
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,800
Oh, no, I didn't see it.

1319
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:52,340
Oh, you gotta go back to my, I got my NES Amiibo from Japan.

1320
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:57,240
One of the three that I have coming, because, here's the hilarious part.

1321
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:03,240
Alan bought me one for a birthday gift, and I didn't know that he did that.

1322
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:06,120
He bought from some import thing, I don't know.

1323
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:12,480
When Play Asia had the Japanese ones go up, both Shane and I were on there, and we both

1324
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:13,480
bought one.

1325
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:16,920
We were just like, I don't know, I just didn't trust that even if Shane would get one, that

1326
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:20,760
he would actually get one, because people cancel pre-orders all the time, right?

1327
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,120
So I was like, we need to buy two.

1328
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:24,200
So he bought one, and I bought one.

1329
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,640
Now I have three NES Amiibo coming from Japan.

1330
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:29,840
Shane told me he's just gonna keep the one that he gets, but I'm still gonna have an

1331
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:35,240
extra one, so I'm deciding, am I gonna hang onto it to try to trade for something else,

1332
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:40,640
or maybe, maybe I'll do a giveaway.

1333
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:41,640
We'll see.

1334
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:42,640
Hmm.

1335
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:43,640
That's nice.

1336
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:45,040
More to come on that.

1337
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:49,460
I would think people might be motivated for a NES Amiibo of all things.

1338
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:52,040
Those things are region-free, but I don't know, I don't wanna get too ahead of myself,

1339
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:53,040
I don't know.

1340
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,040
Anyway, what'd you wanna say about Amiibos?

1341
01:11:55,440 --> 01:12:04,120
Well, first thing, I helped organize an Amiibo tournament yesterday, so I got to see, like,

1342
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:07,520
three people with the NES Amiibo, sorry.

1343
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,520
So yeah, at least I got to see it now.

1344
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:17,960
Hopefully I can get mine soon, too, but aside from that, you know how we're always complaining

1345
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:21,760
about Nintendo and not producing enough Amiibos?

1346
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:22,920
Yeah.

1347
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:31,600
So apparently, some of the CPSI certificates of compliance got updated recently.

1348
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:39,560
Some of the Amiibos that appear in this update are Jigglypuff, Charizard, Ness, Lucario,

1349
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:46,880
Rosalina and Luma, Captain Falcon, Pit, Fox, Whiffit Trainer, and Villager.

1350
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:52,180
And also, Nintendo of America tweeted that at least Pit and Whiffit Trainer are going

1351
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:59,580
to appear in stores in the next few weeks, so yeah, if anyone that is looking for the

1352
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:06,900
rare Amiibos, like Villager, especially, and some of the store exclusives, and are still

1353
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:12,180
looking for them, well, probably they will appear in the next few weeks or at least before

1354
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:15,020
the month ends, so that's pretty big.

1355
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:16,620
I'm cautiously optimistic.

1356
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:20,980
I'll believe it when I can walk into a store and see what I see these pictures out of Japan

1357
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:24,500
and Europe where the shelves just line with them, because I'm telling you what, I went

1358
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:28,180
into a Target just yesterday, because we were there for something else, and I was like,

1359
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:32,340
oh, let's just go look at the Amiibo for fun, see what they have, LOL.

1360
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:34,660
They were fucking picked dry.

1361
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:35,660
Picked dry.

1362
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:39,820
Like, there was maybe like two Marios and a Zelda hanging on the shelf.

1363
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:40,820
That's it.

1364
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:44,660
Like, I was like, damn, like, you can't even get a goddamn Pikachu anymore.

1365
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:45,660
That's crazy.

1366
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:46,660
Yeah, sorry.

1367
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:57,140
Yeah, usually when a wait just launches, the Amiibos are really, really scarce, so yeah,

1368
01:13:57,140 --> 01:14:01,140
you really find some of the even common ones.

1369
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:02,660
Well, let me ask you this.

1370
01:14:02,660 --> 01:14:06,960
Do you think it's about to break with these Amiibos, because earlier, before the press

1371
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:11,760
conference began, we were talking about a leaked ad or something that had come out that

1372
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:17,480
showed that there was an 8-bit Mario Amiibo and these Animal Crossing Amiibo, and it's

1373
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:20,480
like, why are there Animal Crossing Amiibo when you haven't announced Animal Crossing

1374
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:21,480
Wii U yet?

1375
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:23,520
Although, clearly, that's the thing.

1376
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:26,800
I think that they originally were talking about those, I think they had actually announced

1377
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:27,800
those a while back.

1378
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:28,800
Well, there were the cards.

1379
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:32,480
No, so actually, the Amiibos are actually going to be for that stupid 3DS game.

1380
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:33,480
Oh, pfft.

1381
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:34,480
Well, anyway.

1382
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:36,240
No one's going to buy it for that 3DS game.

1383
01:14:36,240 --> 01:14:37,240
Yeah.

1384
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,240
Now, Wii U.

1385
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:39,240
Animal Crossing.

1386
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:43,880
See, and this is where I'm torn on Amiibos, because I hate those little fucking things

1387
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:44,880
and everything.

1388
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:45,880
God damn, they're so annoying.

1389
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:46,880
But I wanted Isabelle!

1390
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,640
But isn't it too early for, like, an Animal Crossing?

1391
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,640
Don't you think it's a little early for an Animal Crossing?

1392
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:54,720
Like, we just fucking had an Animal Crossing a couple years ago.

1393
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:57,480
I think it's too, like, soon for an Animal Crossing Wii U game.

1394
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,960
Can we just, like, get something better?

1395
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:05,200
Well, I'm going to counter and say, and I know immediately what your response is going

1396
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,200
to be, but please let me finish my sentence.

1397
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,940
Alright, go ahead.

1398
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:14,980
But if the game is something different, but still Animal Crossing, but it's like, no,

1399
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:19,620
they really did reinvent the game from the ground up, there's some, like, new twist on

1400
01:15:19,620 --> 01:15:20,620
Animal Crossing.

1401
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:21,620
Low-key retort.

1402
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:28,020
I'm not going to say anything, because, you know, I know how ridiculous that idea is.

1403
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:33,300
Just like, oh yeah, we, we, you're the mayor now, and it's an island, and, um, yeah.

1404
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:34,580
There you go.

1405
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:36,860
It's, we moved where the shops are now.

1406
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:37,860
They're different.

1407
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:38,860
Different spots.

1408
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:42,080
And, you know, hey, all those random things that you wanted to wait for, and that actually

1409
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,620
made it worthwhile to play the game, to see some new stuff in there.

1410
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:46,500
Yeah, we just did all second to one corner.

1411
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:50,540
Oh, and still no fucking virtual console games in the, in this, because, you know, fuck you,

1412
01:15:50,540 --> 01:15:52,100
that's why.

1413
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:57,380
I'm just, I, I'm just, you know, call me crazy, but maybe they could do an Animal Crossing,

1414
01:15:57,380 --> 01:15:59,040
it's like actually a different game.

1415
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,040
But we'll see.

1416
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:01,040
I don't know.

1417
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:06,380
Well, New, New Leaf was kind of a different game, because even, even though it has this,

1418
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:12,060
uh, still the same core gameplay, you, you really had more stuff to do.

1419
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:13,060
Yeah, that's right.

1420
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:17,860
So, uh, I can really argue about, oh, it's the same thing, but with less stuff.

1421
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:23,660
Yeah, you can talk about, yeah, the, the lack of virtual console games, and some of, some

1422
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:29,420
of the shops that, uh, kind of limited, are limited, at least not from the start.

1423
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:34,380
But playing the game, it's, uh, at least, uh, from my perspective, that I played the

1424
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:40,260
original, at least on the GameCube, and, and didn't play one until New Leaf.

1425
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:43,900
There was a lot of things new, and pretty, pretty damn fun.

1426
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:46,540
I, I played that game for almost a year straight.

1427
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:49,620
Let me, let me just, let me just throw out a crazy idea, I mean, some of you are gonna

1428
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:54,300
want to give me a drug screening after I say this, but what if they did, like, uh, I don't

1429
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:59,100
know, like an always online type of game, where you could have more than one person

1430
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:03,120
in your town, where you coexist, like in the, like in the older games, where like four people

1431
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:06,880
could live in one town, but what if that could all happen, like, at the same time?

1432
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:07,880
I would really like that.

1433
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:08,880
I would too!

1434
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:09,880
Like, a lot.

1435
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:10,880
Think of the children.

1436
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:11,880
Think of the children.

1437
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:12,880
I know.

1438
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:17,280
You're gonna have the pedophiles living right next door, having access to the animal genitals

1439
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:18,280
right there.

1440
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:19,280
I know.

1441
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:24,120
It's just, it's, think of the children, they will be lured, lured out by strangers, because

1442
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:26,540
they'll be like, hey, you want some candy, child?

1443
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:31,440
And the sign in front of my house that says, I heart butts, you know, the poor children,

1444
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:32,440
the poor children.

1445
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:35,960
Well, at least they tried with this platoon, but, yeah.

1446
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:39,760
Anyway, that was all deviation, quickly, because I want to let you go so we can get more calls,

1447
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,260
but quickly, your thought on all these amiibo.

1448
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:44,760
Is it too much, Act F'd?

1449
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:50,560
Is it too much, kinda, are people really burned out on them?

1450
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:51,560
Not at all.

1451
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:53,840
That's what I'm gonna say.

1452
01:17:53,840 --> 01:18:00,040
Nintendo fans, and I say this as one, Nintendo fans are fucking nuts, like, especially for

1453
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:05,840
collectibles, like, it's like fucking nuts squared, and I, I, I fully confess that's

1454
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,840
me too.

1455
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:09,960
I have no reason to have all those amiibo in the living room that I do.

1456
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:12,440
Yeah, and you know what's gonna be great, Rob?

1457
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,480
Let's flash forward ten years from now.

1458
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,480
Jesus.

1459
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:19,240
Nintendo has their next console coming out, but for some reason, in ten years, some reason,

1460
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:23,160
okay, well, whatever, yeah, for some, they already have it out, okay, whatever, okay,

1461
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:28,640
for some reason, and this just seems to happen all the time with Disney Infinity, or maybe

1462
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:33,200
not Disney Infinity, but like Skylighters and stuff, it's just like, you know what,

1463
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:36,560
the old ones just don't work with the new one.

1464
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:41,120
Sorry, our new system, the old amiibos aren't gonna fucking work with it.

1465
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,120
You better buy this.

1466
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:46,760
It's the new amiibo lineup, and that's what it's called, because it's Nintendo, they just

1467
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:53,400
call it new amiibo, and then this is, this is a new amiibo Mario Party 11.

1468
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:56,080
Oh, yeah.

1469
01:18:56,080 --> 01:19:01,800
Alright, act deaf, I'm gonna let you go so we can get more calls, but thank you for calling

1470
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,960
in and making me hate myself a little bit.

1471
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:06,680
Hey, thanks for the problem, for protecting me.

1472
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:07,680
Take care, buddy.

1473
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:12,640
Well, look at Nintendo, like, they have to, um, well, they have Mario Maker, that's great,

1474
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:15,600
and you know what, I'm really glad that they have it, and I think that's gonna be a pretty

1475
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:19,040
awesome game, but then you got, like, you know, all these other games out there that

1476
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:23,120
build in their own level editors with the game, you know, that's just something that

1477
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,120
comes with it.

1478
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:27,360
There's so many confessions in our chat room, Brak the Man says, I have 31 amiibo and I

1479
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:32,480
hate myself every day, Black Wolf says, I have three and I hate myself, uh, Raginator

1480
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:35,320
says nuts squared, more like deez nuts squared.

1481
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:39,480
I have one amiibo, and I didn't even buy it, and it's sitting on a shelf unopened, and

1482
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:41,200
I still hate myself for having it.

1483
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:47,760
Fifth Dream is suggesting a me-bew, because with a ew, a me-bew, anyway, hi, you're on

1484
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:50,160
Orange Songs Radio, who's this?

1485
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,160
It's Ronma.

1486
01:19:51,160 --> 01:19:52,160
Ronma, I know you got that.

1487
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:55,320
You're like talking like Cat now, and it's like, me-bew!

1488
01:19:55,320 --> 01:20:00,800
Yeah, there's sad kitties in Ronma's profile, because they heard us talking about amiibo.

1489
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:01,800
That too.

1490
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,840
What's on your mind, my friend?

1491
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:11,200
Man, listen, Loki, I feel you on the amiibos, because, look, I don't hate myself, because

1492
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:16,440
I had the two that I want, and they're sitting up, sitting on my wall here, and that's it.

1493
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:17,440
That's all I need.

1494
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:22,080
Don't get me wrong, they would be cool, like, as statues, so I could pay five bucks and

1495
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:27,120
get like the one I want, and that's it, because it's just, they don't add enough to the games,

1496
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:30,920
like, okay, yeah, I can train one in fucking Smash Brothers, whoopty shit.

1497
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:33,680
AkumaJP is in chat saying, sorry.

1498
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:34,680
Don't be sorry.

1499
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:35,680
No, no, no.

1500
01:20:35,680 --> 01:20:38,680
A Bowser amiibo is perfect for this little bastard, just saying.

1501
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:40,000
No, no, no, no, no.

1502
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:45,040
I have, thank you, thank you again for saying that to me, I'm just saying, you know, I think,

1503
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:50,480
like I feel that now I'm part of the problem, because, you know, I own one, so, yeah, that's

1504
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:54,320
my whole thing, it's like, you know, my stance of not owning one, I can't do that anymore

1505
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,440
because I still haven't.

1506
01:20:55,440 --> 01:21:00,360
You make Loki a hypocrite every day, everybody in chat should be thanking you, AkumaJP.

1507
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:04,400
It's the only thing on my desk at work that's game-related, so there you go.

1508
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,400
Congratulations.

1509
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:09,760
No, but it's just, I don't know, where was I going with this?

1510
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:10,760
I don't even remember.

1511
01:21:10,760 --> 01:21:11,760
I don't know.

1512
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:15,160
Why don't we let Rama talk about whatever he called in to talk about tonight.

1513
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:18,800
Okay, I got a couple of things, I'm gonna get the heck up on out of here now.

1514
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:24,320
As with Amiibo, I got the ones I want, but I tell you what, when they announce the real

1515
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:28,400
Amiibo, I will shank a mofo for one, okay?

1516
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:29,400
I will.

1517
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:30,400
What's the real Amiibo?

1518
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,400
Are you talking about the new?

1519
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:32,400
The new?

1520
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,400
No, Ryu.

1521
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:34,400
Oh, the Ryu Amiibo.

1522
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:38,240
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you said the new, oh, the Ryu Amiibo, oh my god, people are

1523
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:39,880
gonna get killed for those.

1524
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:42,920
What about the ones that, like, what is it, the two Rob the Robots, they have different

1525
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:45,520
paint colors, you know, depending on which region they're from?

1526
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,080
Oh yeah, that shit's gonna be funny.

1527
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:51,000
Somebody will die at a GameStop for one of those Ryu Amiibos, and it's so morbid of me

1528
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:55,200
to say, and I hate that I'm saying it, but, like, it's just people are crazy.

1529
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,200
Rob?

1530
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:57,200
What?

1531
01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:03,400
Supposedly, about a few weeks ago, two people were stabbed at a Walmart for a couple of

1532
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:04,400
Amiibos.

1533
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:08,800
Well, yeah, don't go to Walmart, but that's another story.

1534
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:14,080
Let me tell you, I was at an anime nexus weekend, and my friend cosplayed Little Mac, and he

1535
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:18,680
said he was gonna walk around with a chain with all these Amiibos, I'm like, you do

1536
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:23,080
realize someone's gonna snuff you, you do realize someone's gonna jack you.

1537
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:25,600
I can't help you.

1538
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:28,000
Because the thirst for those Amiibos is real.

1539
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,320
It is real.

1540
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:33,320
I feel like every week this show is turning into the Amiibo show, and I'm-

1541
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,040
As Nintendo would like it to be.

1542
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:38,720
I'm worried that this is, like, this is the game industry's future, because we're all

1543
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,720
obsessed with these little fuckers.

1544
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:43,120
No, we used to talk about Skylanders and Disneyfinity shit before, we'll eventually get tired of

1545
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:46,640
it, eventually we'll be like, okay, listen, I can't talk about every fucking time they

1546
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:49,520
announce a new character for Amiibos, no one gives a shit anymore.

1547
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:53,080
That's true, there came a point where it's like, okay, we can't talk about Skylanders

1548
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:54,080
anymore.

1549
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:57,120
Or Rock Band songs, like, when they were used to announcing Rock Band DLC, it's like, okay,

1550
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:00,320
we can't report on this every fucking week, because there is a new song every fucking

1551
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:01,320
week.

1552
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:02,320
Fair enough.

1553
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:03,320
Fair enough.

1554
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:07,240
So, Rama, you will cut a bitch for a Ryu Amiibo.

1555
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:08,240
That's right.

1556
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:12,120
I'm right there with you, and then, I swear to God, if somehow there's some type of street

1557
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:19,800
fighter Wii U game, and then they start giving us other fighters, like Chun-Li, Cammy, it's

1558
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:20,800
over.

1559
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,120
Shown up.

1560
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:27,080
Why can't I, can I get my Ryu on in Mario Kart 8, or something like that?

1561
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:30,240
Can we get some Mario Kart 8 themed DLC?

1562
01:23:30,240 --> 01:23:31,240
You never know.

1563
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:33,480
We got the Mega Man outfit for the kart.

1564
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:37,000
Or, like, can we get, like, I wanna see some more, like, I'm glad that they have all those

1565
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:41,360
cross, well, and the other thing that only some Amiibos work with some games is fucking

1566
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:47,160
stupid too, but I'm saying, you know, why can't we just have, like, maybe all of them

1567
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:51,000
work with all games, you know, if you patch that shit in later, if you're gonna put out

1568
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
a game, you know.

1569
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,520
Well, with, to be fair, with as many of these little fuckers that are coming out, it's gonna

1570
01:23:56,520 --> 01:24:00,040
be hard, like, for your game to support every single Amiibo.

1571
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:01,040
Whoa!

1572
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:03,400
You're saying that they have too many for the games that they have out there?

1573
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:04,400
Yes, yes I am.

1574
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,400
Then maybe they should stop fucking producing them.

1575
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:07,400
That's an idea.

1576
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:08,400
Alright.

1577
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:11,920
Rama, did you just call in to talk about your love of Ryu Amiibo, or do you have any other

1578
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:12,920
thoughts you wanna share with us tonight?

1579
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:13,920
No!

1580
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:17,160
I had a couple more things, but you know, when Loki is ranting, it's like hearing the

1581
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:21,240
preacher talking, like, preach, you know?

1582
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:25,280
I'm reminded of a scene from Orange is the New Black, but I don't wanna spoil anything,

1583
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:30,440
so I'll just leave it there, but you know I got made to marathon it yesterday.

1584
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:32,120
That's a meme, just so you know.

1585
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:33,120
Is it?

1586
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:41,360
Okay, real quick, the whole partnership with Oculus and Xbox, I'm not surprised since both

1587
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:46,800
companies are owned by one, I'm not surprised, not owned, but more or less, you know what

1588
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:47,800
I'm saying.

1589
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:50,920
What, Facebook and Microsoft are in bed together, is that what you're saying?

1590
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:57,960
Well, we all know that Microsoft has a nice, sizable interest investment in Facebook, and

1591
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:03,040
if you haven't realized, as Facebook is doing their physical changes, it kinda looks like

1592
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:08,640
a modern MSN or Windows 10 layout per se, so I'm not surprised by that.

1593
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:12,880
Facebook competes with Microsoft in some spaces, such as like, you know, Skype, like what we're

1594
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:16,800
using right now, Facebook would far prefer that we use their integrated messaging program.

1595
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:20,160
I don't think that they're actually partnering with them in that sense, I just think that

1596
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:24,400
they didn't wanna fuckin' design a controller, I mean, aside from the Oculus Touch, which

1597
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:29,840
is a stupid name, I must admit, but I mean, honestly, the Xbox 360 controller works awesome.

1598
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:33,920
I was using an Xbox 360 controller on my laptop until it broke, and then I realized,

1599
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:37,920
hey, guess what, I can sync up my PlayStation 4 controllers to it, it works just like the

1600
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:38,920
Xbox 360 one.

1601
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:43,240
When you strip out all the tinfoil hat and all these conspiracy theories about what are

1602
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:48,960
these two companies doing in bed together, to be honest, the Xbox 360, or the one controller,

1603
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:54,840
I mean, I'm kinda using these terms interchangeably, it really is like the definitive PC gamepad,

1604
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:57,960
and I realize there's hundreds of different gamepads you can get out there, but there's

1605
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:04,320
so many games out there that will just recognize a 360 or a one controller, and they just work.

1606
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:09,600
Even Final Fantasy XIV, you can tell that this game, they pitched it for 360 and the

1607
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:14,480
one, because when you plug in that controller, Final Fantasy XIV will change all the icons

1608
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:15,960
to an Xbox controller.

1609
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:21,440
Well, it's just that most games utilize that now, and it's not to say that it's the best

1610
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:26,040
controller, but I think for PC, it is the best controller, I mean, what other competitors

1611
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:27,040
are out there.

1612
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:32,920
Please, don't tell me that the Steam controller is a fucking contender here, it's not, I mean,

1613
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:36,200
they're gonna try to make that shit work, but I just don't see it happening.

1614
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:41,240
So if, I mean, and if Oculus is trying to level set the experience, which is something

1615
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:44,920
that like Morpheus on the Sony side doesn't have to deal with, but if Oculus is trying

1616
01:26:44,920 --> 01:26:49,800
to level set the experience, saying, you know, you need a computer that's at least X level,

1617
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:53,800
and at least they're kinda level setting, okay, this is the controller that we anticipate

1618
01:26:53,880 --> 01:27:00,280
is gonna be in everybody's hand, because, you know, when your vision senses are 100%,

1619
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:04,920
and your audio senses, if you're doing it right, are 100% taken over by the Oculus experience,

1620
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:09,400
then, you know what, your touch might as well all be consistent as well, so, I don't know.

1621
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:10,400
Just a thought.

1622
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:12,640
Anything else you wanna get out there, Ama?

1623
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:16,320
My last thing, I've been getting heat from some friends about Bethesda, because, look,

1624
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:23,200
I don't like them, I've tried the Fallout series, didn't like it, thought it was crap.

1625
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:27,680
When I discovered they had Wolfenstein, I held my breath, I'm like, I don't know.

1626
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:31,360
Because I kept, when I listen to you guys, I have other friends, we're talking about

1627
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:35,760
Elder Scrolls, and Skyrim, and all the bugs and the issues, I'm just like.

1628
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,800
That's what makes it great.

1629
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:39,680
It's so buggy sometimes.

1630
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:43,740
Like, today I was playing it, and all of a sudden, like, I was walking, I saw this hunter

1631
01:27:43,740 --> 01:27:46,680
in front of me, and she pulled out her bow, I'm like, what the fuck's going on?

1632
01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:50,320
All of a sudden, fire rained from the sky, and she died, I'm like, oh, hey, there's a

1633
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:51,320
dragon up there.

1634
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:55,760
I didn't even hear that dragon, and I shot the dragon, and it's bones rag-dolled crazily

1635
01:27:55,760 --> 01:28:00,480
down the hill, because their rag-doll controls aren't very good.

1636
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:03,120
Acteft in chat says, the bugs are features.

1637
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:11,920
Well, those are features I don't want in Wolfenstein, which is why I should, because I said this,

1638
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:18,600
if I pick up Wolfenstein, and I like it, and it's not buggy, and it's not chaotic, I'll

1639
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:19,600
get Doom.

1640
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:24,600
And I find myself screaming at the game, because Bethesda can't get stuff done, right?

1641
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:27,240
I'm like, I will just wait until Doom becomes a budget title.

1642
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:30,960
Well, the best part about buying Wolfenstein, I'm not sure if we're outside the window or

1643
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:35,440
not, but if you buy Wolfenstein, you do get a Doom beta entry.

1644
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:43,520
I was gonna say, though, but you've gotta pick it up on PC, too, because I have the,

1645
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:49,000
like, you know, the Steam Workshop integrations, fantastic, and so, like, for example, my game

1646
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:56,320
that I'm playing right now, I have the Saints Row Dubstep Gun spell, and it's awesome.

1647
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:57,320
Are you throwing things in this house?

1648
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:58,320
Yes, I'm throwing things.

1649
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:03,200
Rama, we're gonna let you go to try to squeeze in one more call, but Anime Jam Session, you

1650
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:07,000
have that lucky Tuesday night slot where you're gonna be right after all this E3 stuff, so

1651
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,660
I can't imagine you won't be dipping into video games at least a little bit this week

1652
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:12,640
on Anime Jam Session, yeah?

1653
01:29:12,640 --> 01:29:18,880
No, we are, we just came back from Anime Next, so we got so much cover, and the big, big

1654
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:24,200
controversy because so many of the fans are pissed that the convention is moving to Atlantic

1655
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:25,200
City.

1656
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:27,240
Oh, yeah, I heard there's a lot of stuff going on.

1657
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:31,400
Wow, when there's enough drama in your fandom, you don't got time for E3.

1658
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:36,840
Well, did you see the screenshot from what, I think, one of the titles that, you know,

1659
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:42,280
kind of the shocking announcement was, like, Platinum Games is doing a new Transformers

1660
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:43,280
game.

1661
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:44,280
Did you see the screenshot of that?

1662
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:48,200
Where it looks like it's straight out of the fucking 80s cartoon, like, the way they shaded

1663
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:49,200
everything.

1664
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:50,200
It's awesome.

1665
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:51,200
Nice.

1666
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:52,200
I don't know.

1667
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:53,200
Alright.

1668
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:54,200
Rob, let me just say this, let me get out of here.

1669
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:58,280
When you talk about the fandom and the drama and all that, and my fandoms, this is all

1670
01:29:58,280 --> 01:29:59,280
I gotta say.

1671
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:00,280
Girl, please.

1672
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:04,680
You have no idea, brah.

1673
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:06,560
Trust no bitch.

1674
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:07,560
Exactly!

1675
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:15,000
Alright, let me tell you, Magfest, we're gonna have some drinks, and I'm gonna tell you some

1676
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
stories, okay?

1677
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Okay!

1678
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:23,680
Everything, I tell you, this is the reason why I watch RuPaul's Drag Race.

1679
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:25,280
It's not, it's not a gay thing.

1680
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:28,000
It's not a, it's a life thing, people.

1681
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,240
There's so much advice.

1682
01:30:30,240 --> 01:30:32,400
Anyway, another week, another week.

1683
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:33,720
Alright, take care, my friend.

1684
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:34,720
You too.

1685
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:35,720
Bye.

1686
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:41,040
1A77 game, OLR, or username on Skype, OrangeLaundry.

1687
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:44,840
I'll try to squeeze in one quick call, if we have anybody else who wants to call in,

1688
01:30:44,840 --> 01:30:47,200
but otherwise we'll probably wrap things up here.

1689
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:50,120
Any of these other stories you think we ought to mention here, Loki?

1690
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:52,120
I just bought Fallout 3, game of the year edition.

1691
01:30:52,120 --> 01:30:53,760
Did you really, on Steam, just now?

1692
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:54,760
Yeah.

1693
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:55,760
Alright.

1694
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:56,760
How much was it?

1695
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:57,760
$11.99.

1696
01:30:57,760 --> 01:30:58,760
That's not bad.

1697
01:30:58,760 --> 01:30:59,760
That's not bad.

1698
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:03,760
But I was actually hesitating, I was like, it's $11.99, and it's like, it's not like

1699
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:04,760
purchasing a title.

1700
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:05,760
Was it, but was it on...

1701
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:09,240
It's 40%, no, it could go cheaper, or whatever.

1702
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:11,920
I don't give a shit, it's like a dollar or something.

1703
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,360
Can you do the refund thing, if it's tomorrow?

1704
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:18,000
I could, but I'm, I don't care, it's not, at that point it doesn't matter.

1705
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:25,560
Alright, last chance, guys, 1877 game OLR, username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

1706
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:29,960
Let's see, I do want to mention this about the Arc System Works, apparently bought not

1707
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:34,560
only the Double Dragon Rites this week, but River City Ransom, oh my god, does this mean

1708
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:39,120
we could have like a crossover, or just the fact that River City Ransom could be making

1709
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:40,360
a comeback?

1710
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:41,800
That would be awesome.

1711
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:48,520
Don't forget Arc System Works, they made Hardcore Uprising, that was just fucking Contra, straight

1712
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:50,480
up, like that was a Contra game.

1713
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:51,480
It was.

1714
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:52,480
And it was great.

1715
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:57,080
And if they're gonna remake River City Ransom like that, or reimagine or whatever the hell

1716
01:31:57,080 --> 01:32:00,400
you want to call it, I'm so in, that's gonna be a lot of fun.

1717
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:06,420
So yeah, and if they somehow incorporate the Double Dragon universe into that too, amazing.

1718
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:10,160
So totally down to see what happens with those guys.

1719
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:13,320
Loki, one more before we close up shop?

1720
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:21,560
Okay, let's see, let's go ahead and talk about this, I guess, oh, Bloodstained, that did

1721
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:22,560
pretty well.

1722
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:28,640
It was the most funded Kickstarter ever, I'm not sure if that's actually true, maybe most

1723
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:29,640
funded game?

1724
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:33,160
I think it's the most funded game, I think it still got beat by like Oculus and the Watch

1725
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:34,160
thing.

1726
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:40,040
Yeah, I was gonna say, even, fuck, I want to say, no, I want to say that stupid Ouya

1727
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:41,040
out.

1728
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:42,040
Yeah, the Ouya.

1729
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:43,040
But anyways.

1730
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:46,040
But this is the most funded, like, game software, I guess you could say.

1731
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:55,280
Yes, so $4.2 million, it beat out, was it Tormund's Tides of, I have never heard of

1732
01:32:55,280 --> 01:32:56,280
that game.

1733
01:32:56,280 --> 01:33:00,080
But I guess that one got $4.1 million a few years ago.

1734
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:04,640
Didn't they, I thought the Bloodstained thing ended up with like $5.5 million, it's crazy.

1735
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:06,120
I thought it was even higher than that.

1736
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:08,240
Let's take a look here real quick, because I don't trust our people.

1737
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:11,920
Alright, take a peek while we get to this call, because they hit their last stretch

1738
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:13,920
goal, which was $5.5 million, so I'm sure they got it.

1739
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:14,920
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio, who's this?

1740
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:16,920
Yeah, what's up guys, this is Kaijuto.

1741
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:17,920
Hey Kaijuto, what's up buddy?

1742
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:22,920
Not much, I'm gonna keep this short, I just want to say, Bethesda completely won me over,

1743
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:27,560
I had no interest in their press conference, I was saying to myself, that we asked for

1744
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:33,120
Fallout 4, I've never been a Doom fan, so I mean, there was really nothing I thought

1745
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:38,040
they were gonna offer me that was gonna sway me, but man, was that a great press conference.

1746
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:42,840
I mean, it's probably one of the best I've seen in E3 in a long time, not even when they

1747
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:45,700
brought out the new consoles, was I impressed.

1748
01:33:45,700 --> 01:33:49,320
Here's the $64,000 question, why?

1749
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:53,080
Just every game they showed, that dynamic game engine, that everything that you can

1750
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:58,000
do in Fallout, how everything is just like done on the fly, and just also the graphics,

1751
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:03,000
I'm not really a graphics hoarder, but I mean, those games look beautiful, Doom, Fallout

1752
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,800
4, Dishonored, even that indie game that they showed looked pretty good.

1753
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:11,280
I mean, I was completely impressed and blown away by everything that they showed it, I

1754
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:16,600
mean, they also had a lot of charisma that they put into the presentation that also made

1755
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:22,960
it a lot of fun to watch too, and that app, I was so disappointed that it was only for

1756
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:29,800
the iOS, because I have an Android, but that app is impressive as well, and when they mentioned

1757
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:35,360
it was free, and there's no paywall, I mean, they just hit everything, everything they

1758
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:38,080
said just sounded so freaking great and amazing.

1759
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:41,800
It's probably coming to Android, but they probably just had an in with Apple where it

1760
01:34:41,800 --> 01:34:42,800
went live tonight.

1761
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:46,760
Well, it's also, they're developing it for, you know, like a handful of Apple devices

1762
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:52,600
versus the, you know, severely fragmented Android, you know.

1763
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:55,040
Yeah, but there's still some standards in that.

1764
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:58,740
I hope it comes out for Android, but the fact that he said that they, you know, they made

1765
01:34:58,740 --> 01:35:02,620
some close friendships or partnerships with Apple, I was just like, oh, I think this thing

1766
01:35:02,620 --> 01:35:04,080
is probably gonna be exclusive.

1767
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:05,080
We'll see.

1768
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:09,360
Which I don't get, which I'm, you know, that's one thing we'll get into another time, but

1769
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:11,000
it just pisses me off how many people just want it.

1770
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:15,600
Well, I guess I'll just have to push start and bring up my arm in the game as a menu

1771
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:21,000
instead of, you know, launching my separate app on my phone that that app will eat through

1772
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,400
my battery like a fucking, you know, cookie monster in a bowl of cookies.

1773
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:28,560
They're talking about Tiny Tower Fallout Shelter, that's, that's, well that looks pretty cool

1774
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:29,560
too.

1775
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:30,560
Yeah, I see, but that's the one that's out.

1776
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:33,920
But that one though, I'm hoping that they just port that shit over to like fucking Xbox

1777
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:34,920
or PS3.

1778
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:39,960
They did say in chat that is out now, so it came out in the past hour.

1779
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:44,660
It's not out this minute, this minute, but they, they are rolling it out right now, which,

1780
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:48,480
which was really great when you said that it was just like, yeah, they, I mean, they,

1781
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,760
they did an impressive show.

1782
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:50,760
You know what?

1783
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:53,440
I will say this, you know, especially considering that they didn't really have any like triple

1784
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:56,120
A like talent, like celebrities basically on set.

1785
01:35:56,120 --> 01:35:59,280
I mean, obviously talented game developers, certainly, but they didn't have it.

1786
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:01,240
They didn't pull any celebrity stunts really.

1787
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:02,240
I mean, one card.

1788
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,960
They had Adam Seskler and Morgan Webber.

1789
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:05,560
I don't even know.

1790
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:09,560
I mean, yes, they're gaming celebrities, but I'm talking about like, there was no Joel

1791
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:13,480
McHale, Esha Tyler, those types of things, right?

1792
01:36:13,480 --> 01:36:14,920
And they weren't on stage either.

1793
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:17,120
They did the pre and the post show, they weren't on stage.

1794
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:23,640
So I mean, I would argue that, you know, especially for a first year E3 show, they did a really

1795
01:36:23,640 --> 01:36:28,960
good job and no real technical hiccups except, you know, the one yesterday that ruined one

1796
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:32,760
of the surprises, but okay, if that's, if that's going to be their hiccup, then so

1797
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:33,760
be it.

1798
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:34,760
So, yeah.

1799
01:36:34,760 --> 01:36:35,760
And weren't they late too or something?

1800
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:39,880
Cause I thought it was supposed to start at like nine Eastern time and they didn't start

1801
01:36:39,880 --> 01:36:44,240
till way late, but I don't know if I got my time.

1802
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:48,280
Their pre-show with Morgan and all that started a little earlier.

1803
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:52,480
The conference was always supposed to be seven Pacific, 10 Eastern, but they had started

1804
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:56,760
a little pre-show, but we didn't acknowledge it cause we wanted you to stay with OLR until

1805
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:58,280
it was ready to go.

1806
01:36:58,280 --> 01:36:59,280
So yeah.

1807
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:00,280
All right.

1808
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:01,280
Yeah.

1809
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:02,280
I was.

1810
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:03,280
Yeah.

1811
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:04,280
Just great show.

1812
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:05,280
All right.

1813
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:06,280
I don't know.

1814
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:07,280
I think, I don't even think they should do a press conference next year.

1815
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:08,280
Like this year was so good.

1816
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:11,920
I think they should just wait until they have another blockbuster game, like the next elder

1817
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:14,120
scrolls or whatever, and then do one.

1818
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:15,120
Just don't bother.

1819
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:17,680
Cause you're not going to be able to live up to what you did tonight.

1820
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:18,680
One and done.

1821
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:21,960
Well, that might be the case, sir, because last year they only had two games to show.

1822
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:22,960
This is just a different year.

1823
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:23,960
Now they have more happening.

1824
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:26,480
So, all right, my friend, I'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up.

1825
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:27,480
Have a good night.

1826
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:28,480
Later.

1827
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:29,480
All right.

1828
01:37:29,480 --> 01:37:30,480
Later.

1829
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:31,480
All right.

1830
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:32,600
Well, believe it or not, I know it seems like it was a really short night tonight on the

1831
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:36,160
podcast for those of you listening midweek, although, you know, even there might even

1832
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:40,560
be less of you during the week because a lot of you are going to be caught in with E3 excitement,

1833
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:44,520
but it is about nine 30 on the West coast, meaning 30 after midnight on the East coast.

1834
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:46,600
So we are going to go ahead and shut down OLR for the night.

1835
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:47,600
I apologize.

1836
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:51,040
I know we didn't get to a lot of our usual segments, which include a lot of the ways

1837
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:55,600
that you guys interact with the show, including our mailbag, our frugal question of the week

1838
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:56,600
and so forth.

1839
01:37:56,600 --> 01:38:00,080
We're going to make some tough decisions for time, but we will get back to all the

1840
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:01,640
voices next week.

1841
01:38:01,640 --> 01:38:03,640
A big wrap up show next week.

1842
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:09,360
I'm sure there will be lots of opinions on things we, we, things we don't know exist

1843
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:12,320
today that we will in 24 hours.

1844
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:13,320
Think about that.

1845
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:16,080
We're 24 hours away from what we'll be talking about on OLR.

1846
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:19,720
I just want you to see this real quick because platinum games is fucking fantastic, but look

1847
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:20,720
at this shit.

1848
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:21,720
Fucking look at that game.

1849
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:22,720
Oh yeah.

1850
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:23,720
Straight out of a cartoon.

1851
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:24,720
That's going to be awesome.

1852
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:26,720
I'm not even that excited about transformers games, especially after playing some of the

1853
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:29,720
ones that activisions put out, but Hey, platinum games is awesome.

1854
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:31,720
So you can't go wrong there.

1855
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:32,720
All right.

1856
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:35,720
Well, uh, dark Sakura sadly couldn't stick with us for the rest of the show tonight,

1857
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:39,720
but I'm sure if she were here, her final thought would be something like reject false icons.

1858
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:43,720
Uh, and um, thank you Bobby again for sitting in on the first half of the show with us.

1859
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:47,720
Thank you to our live listeners who stuck with us tonight with all the weird oddities

1860
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:48,720
tonight.

1861
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:50,720
And thank you to everybody who listened on the podcast as well.

1862
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:53,720
If you enjoyed orange light, if you didn't enjoy orange light, if you didn't enjoy orange

1863
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:56,720
launch radio, just tell a friend or five about the show.

1864
01:38:56,720 --> 01:38:59,720
Help us spread the word because word of mouth is all we have.

1865
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:02,720
Uh, and the more voices we get the better because we can all learn something from each

1866
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:07,720
other as long as we can all not be jerks, which luckily we're very fortunate that, uh,

1867
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:12,720
the oil army is very good at, uh, conducting themselves, uh, respectfully and respectful

1868
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:13,720
of others.

1869
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:16,720
So, uh, anyhow, getting final thoughts for the night.

1870
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:18,720
Um, Loki, your final thoughts tonight?

1871
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:22,720
I hope I'm done spending non steam stores, you know, steam sale cause, uh, you're not

1872
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:26,720
I got to check my bank account, make sure I'm not spending too much.

1873
01:39:26,720 --> 01:39:27,720
I have been pretty good.

1874
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:31,720
I, you know, it seems, it feels like I've been spending a lot, but I am a lot of times

1875
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:37,720
when I do that, I, uh, or when I check with that, it's, I end up canceling when I have

1876
01:39:37,720 --> 01:39:38,720
in my cart.

1877
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:40,720
I'm like, I don't really need that.

1878
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:48,720
Uh, my final thought is I am so excited for final fantasy 14 heavens ward, um, this week.

1879
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:54,720
And, um, I don't know how I can handle all this E3 stuff and then a new fucking expansion

1880
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:55,720
to an MMO.

1881
01:39:55,720 --> 01:39:57,720
We all know what a fucking time sync those are.

1882
01:39:57,720 --> 01:40:00,720
I don't know how I'm going to be able to handle that all in one week.

1883
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:05,720
Uh, and then my only other final thought would be, uh, I marathon sense eight this week,

1884
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:07,720
the Netflix show that's by the Wachowski, uh, siblings.

1885
01:40:07,720 --> 01:40:10,720
And, um, I think they did it with Tom Twiker as well.

1886
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:12,720
Uh, it was, it was really good.

1887
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:13,720
A little slow to start.

1888
01:40:13,720 --> 01:40:16,720
Didn't like episode 10, but the rest of it.

1889
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:17,720
Fantastic.

1890
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:18,720
Great show.

1891
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:19,720
You like the Wachowskis don't you?

1892
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:20,720
I do like the Wachowskis.

1893
01:40:20,720 --> 01:40:21,720
You should check out the show.

1894
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:22,720
You have Netflix?

1895
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:23,720
Yeah.

1896
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:24,720
You probably enjoy that show.

1897
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:26,720
That's why I kept seeing you talking about Sense8.

1898
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:28,720
I didn't know what it was about.

1899
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:31,720
Um, it's, it's sci-fi a little bit.

1900
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:35,720
And so at a very high level, I'm not going to say anything that you wouldn't read in

1901
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:36,720
a TV guide.

1902
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:41,720
It's basically eight people that all share sensations with each other and they're all

1903
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:42,720
around the world.

1904
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:44,720
So they're all kind of like connected.

1905
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:47,720
I don't want to say they have the same brain, but they're all connected.

1906
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:50,720
Like they can kind of feel each other's brain activity and stuff.

1907
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:53,720
And that leads down this whole science fiction story type of path.

1908
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:57,720
So, but not like if you're looking for like special effects, craziness, like the matrix,

1909
01:40:57,720 --> 01:40:58,720
you're not going to get that here.

1910
01:40:58,720 --> 01:40:59,720
It's a TV show.

1911
01:40:59,720 --> 01:41:01,720
There's a few car chases and things like that.

1912
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:02,720
That's it.

1913
01:41:02,720 --> 01:41:03,720
Sure.

1914
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:04,720
All right.

1915
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:05,720
Anyway, that's it.

1916
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:06,720
We're done.

1917
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:07,720
We're out of here for the night.

1918
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:10,720
Thank you guys again for listening to the show and we will see you in seven days where

1919
01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:13,720
we will all be exhausted, but ready to talk about E3.

1920
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:14,720
Have a great night, everybody.

1921
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:46,720
See you next week.

1922
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:14,720
Bye.

1923
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:14,740
Bye.
