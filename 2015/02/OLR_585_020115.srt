00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,520
This week, Nintendo rolled out an update adding more 8-player Smash compatible levels, and

2
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,640
for those of you looking to monetize them, there are guidelines for that as well.

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,880
We have so much more for you tonight, including a new segment along with your calls, comments,

4
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,920
and emails, all happening right now on the show, where Evergamer has a voice.

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,040
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,680
where Everygamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:46,640
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this February 1st, 2015, with the 585th episode of our program.

8
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,040
My name is Rob Roberts, here with you over the next three hours or so to talk about video

9
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,180
games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts.

10
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,480
Say hello over there to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,480
Yo.

12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,480
Hey, how you doing?

13
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,480
I'm okay.

14
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,040
Better than I was.

15
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,040
Yeah?

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,040
I know.

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,040
You and I were both talking before the show.

18
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,040
We were both fighting off headaches.

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,040
What's up with that?

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,560
Yeah, we were punching them in the face, but they were being bitches, and we had to put

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,560
some bitches down.

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,160
I feel better now, thanks to Captain Ibuprofen.

23
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,160
I feel a little better.

24
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,960
I feel better thanks to coffee and meat.

25
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,440
I feel better thanks to the power of positivity.

26
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,440
The power of song!

27
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,440
All right.

28
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,440
No.

29
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,320
Also, speaking of the power of song, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

30
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,320
Hello.

31
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,280
Hello, how you doing?

32
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,880
I'm very full.

33
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,880
Full, yeah?

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,520
That sandwich was a maze.

35
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,320
You got a new place that you've never brought to the show before?

36
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,320
Yes.

37
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,320
And what's that?

38
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,480
Firehouse Subs, I guess, is what this is called.

39
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,900
And I had no idea that that chain existed in California, because the first time I ever

40
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,420
had that Firehouse Subs was at Dragon Con in Atlanta, and Travis Donovan, my pal from

41
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,120
Understation Live, I'm sure you all know him here at VOG, was losing his mind with Jenna,

42
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,560
because I guess they didn't have those where he was from, or I don't know, but he was just

43
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,560
very excited about the Firehouse.

44
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,040
He was like, you gotta try it, you gotta try it.

45
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,040
So I had it.

46
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,960
It was, and I shouldn't say this, because we're not paid to endorse this stuff, but

47
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,640
whatever, it was pretty good, I gotta say.

48
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,640
I still prefer Quiznos, rest in peace.

49
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,880
That's my favorite sub sandwich.

50
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,880
They're not gone.

51
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,880
I've got one that's still right around the corner of my mouth.

52
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,880
I know, you lucky punk.

53
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,880
The only one in the area.

54
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,880
That's the only one in all of Sacramento anymore.

55
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,880
Pretty much, yeah.

56
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,640
I'm like, I don't know how they, it's seriously the worst location for that, but somehow they've

57
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,640
survived.

58
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,640
I know, I know.

59
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,040
All right, so you found some new food to bring to the show, so that's good.

60
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes, because I got the same sandwich yesterday, and it was the beef brisket, well, I had the

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,040
intent because yesterday it was like, you know, damn, I don't know if I want the meatball

62
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,460
sub or if I want the brisket sandwich, I'm like, I always get the meatball sub whenever

63
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,440
I go someplace just to try it.

64
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,100
I think everybody goes through that phase where you find that food you love so much,

65
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,760
you're eating it for like a week.

66
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,680
I can't eat that for a week, there's no way, it's like so much, like I got their large

67
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,440
sandwiches like a foot long and it's just packed full of meat.

68
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,600
It's just like so much meat on there.

69
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,280
I just can't, I can't eat more.

70
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,280
I want to eat more, but I, I literally will get sick if I eat more.

71
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,400
Jamie, has there ever been a food that you discovered and then you had to eat it for

72
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,880
like an entire week?

73
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,880
Yes.

74
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,920
What was that?

75
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,440
My favorite sick food?

76
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,440
Mm.

77
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
Burritos.

78
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,440
Burritos?

79
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,440
Just no specific burritos?

80
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,440
No, seriously.

81
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,600
Well, it was, I used to be addicted to the California burritos that were basically the

82
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,880
carne asada, but I wouldn't get like salsa or anything with it.

83
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:33,160
It would be meat, potatoes, and cheese, and I ate it for almost a whole week in a row.

84
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
Wow.

85
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,000
Well, no, I mixed it up with breakfast burritos too, which was egg, potato, and cheese, but

86
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,280
I had like this sick that would not go away and all I wanted to eat was burritos.

87
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,600
So I ate burritos for a week.

88
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,600
Awesome.

89
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Awesome.

90
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,180
I would say for me it was vanilla Coke was the thing that I had to have like every single

91
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,180
day.

92
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,180
It's like, why am I gaining all this weight?

93
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,180
They have that there.

94
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,180
The Coke free summer shoes.

95
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,180
Oh, I know.

96
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,060
I'm talking about, remember when like it came out, it was probably like 2002, 2003.

97
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,680
It was just kind of eh.

98
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,100
Remember when I had pneumonia?

99
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,180
I do.

100
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,260
And all I ate for like a week and a half was French onion soup.

101
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,260
Literally.

102
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,580
That's all I had was French onion soup.

103
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,420
Because I couldn't eat anything else, like solid food was like no.

104
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,420
I would do that too.

105
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,960
I'd go over to Panera and get French onion soup all the time.

106
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,420
Remember Mimi's Cafe before they got crappy?

107
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,420
I do.

108
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:27,500
They had, they had the, uh, the five cheese grilled cheese with French onion soup.

109
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,500
That was crack.

110
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,500
All right.

111
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,060
People are going to think we're a podcast about food and it is inevitable.

112
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,060
We always get into food.

113
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,060
We're talking about food the whole show.

114
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,980
Is it called Orange Lounge Radio because you guys talk about oranges?

115
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,980
Well, kind of.

116
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:44,000
I mean, we never talk about anything that healthy, but yeah, we should do a spinoff

117
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
called the Soup Lounge.

118
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,100
We just talk about food.

119
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,880
But we do have you guys who join us live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine

120
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,840
o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com and if you are listening live

121
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,880
over at live.vognetwork.com, you can head into our chat room there and comment along

122
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,880
with the show.

123
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,320
And we oftentimes are looking at the chat room during the show and we pick some comments

124
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,320
to read on there.

125
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,840
We can't read every single line because then you guys would fill out the entire show with

126
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,840
your conversation.

127
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,680
But we do pick out some key comments.

128
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,680
Right now, most folks in chat talking about sandwiches.

129
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,920
I mean, I can't possibly imagine why.

130
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,560
We have SSG100Matt who says Potbelly is the new Quiznos these days.

131
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,280
It's actually pretty good.

132
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
Let's see.

133
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,920
Pow says, I felt that way when I discovered ramen for the first time.

134
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,240
I still feel that way about ramen.

135
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,480
I just haven't eaten it because it's so much sodium.

136
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,480
Hold on.

137
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,920
It was my first time living alone, so I obviously ran out of budget in 10 days.

138
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,080
I got my first paycheck.

139
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,080
So ramen the rest of the month, I got so sick of it.

140
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,080
Yeah, I did.

141
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
Get this.

142
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,440
When I first moved to California, Dan's pantry was literally ramen and tomato soup.

143
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,120
And I'm like, no.

144
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,520
So okay, last food topic, I promise, and then we'll get into games.

145
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,720
But the video game news is like super depressing this week, what we're going to start off with.

146
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,680
So I'm putting it off intentionally.

147
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,680
So here's my question about ramen, because I think this is super weird and this is something

148
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,680
Alan does.

149
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,320
He's going to kill me for saying it.

150
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,440
But like, he likes to just eat the ramen, like without putting it in the water or anything

151
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,440
like that.

152
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
Yeah, what's your problem with that?

153
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
Oh, no.

154
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,440
They actually sell ramen snacks like that.

155
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,080
You just season it up and you just kind of shake it a little bit and get it incorporated

156
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,080
in there.

157
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,000
And you have to break it apart first, because if you can't just eat the whole piece.

158
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,320
Yeah, you just don't just put the whole brick in your mouth.

159
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,240
See, I can't eat ramen like that anymore unless I make it myself, because I will actually

160
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,980
break out my, I will do it donburi style.

161
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:40,280
You're not supposed to eat ramen like it's shredded wheat in a cereal bowl.

162
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,280
No, you don't.

163
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,520
You take the packaging, you put it on the counter, you slam your fist down on it, but

164
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,360
not too hard because you don't want it to explode.

165
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,040
You just want it to like shatter and then you pour it into a bowl and put the seasoning

166
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,080
over it and away you go.

167
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,080
It's awesome.

168
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,320
Especially if you don't want to wait for it to cook.

169
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,320
If it's super salty.

170
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
Oh my gosh.

171
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,320
No, thank you.

172
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,880
It's just like, that's too much sodium.

173
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,880
It's like, I have a heart attack just thinking about it.

174
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,600
Exactly why I don't eat ramen anymore.

175
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,200
Guys, you know when chat says just eat a rice cake.

176
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,320
My other favorite thing to do with ramen was when we used to just like make like kind of,

177
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,720
I don't know, a melting pot of all different types of ramen.

178
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
Just like, oh, hey, we got some beef.

179
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,720
We got some chicken.

180
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,080
We got some pork.

181
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,080
We got some shrimp or whatever.

182
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,080
Just pour it all together.

183
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
Mix it together.

184
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
Done.

185
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,240
It's some flavor of ramen.

186
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,440
See the way to do it, you get just the noodles.

187
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,800
Actually, I prefer to do this with udon.

188
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,920
You put a, you slice up a boiled egg, you put in like you actually make your dashi stock

189
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:36,080
from scratch and it is the best thing on a cold day.

190
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,240
And then lastly, Alan Alchemy since he was the inspiration for this and chat says you

191
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,080
pound it with your fist or just pinch the shit out of it and make bite sized nuggets.

192
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,400
I don't use the spice packet though.

193
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,400
You know what?

194
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,160
That was almost my food of choice while playing Final Fantasy XI.

195
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,320
I'm surprised you don't remember that.

196
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,320
I do.

197
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,320
I actually do remember that.

198
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
All right.

199
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,320
Thank you for bringing up a video game.

200
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,320
We should take the topic to video games.

201
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,520
But I'm going to be honest, guys.

202
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,040
This is, this has kind of been a shitty week in video games.

203
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:06,160
There's been a lot of real bad news and we'll get to some of it as we go on throughout the

204
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,800
show and bring up the different topics.

205
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,040
But I think there's one y'all are thinking about, y'all have been talking about on Twitter

206
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Let's talk about it now.

207
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,200
Let's talk about it here for our kickoff topic here.

208
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,720
Jamie, some big, some big news in the blogging world, right?

209
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,400
Some crap is what it is.

210
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
Yeah.

211
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,840
So AOL is a bunch of shits.

212
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,840
And that's the news.

213
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,840
That's the news.

214
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,840
Okay.

215
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,840
Well, it's business.

216
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,160
You know, I can't say that the whole company is a bunch of shits, but it's a shitty decision.

217
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:44,400
So Joystiq has basically been dissolved by AOL along with Wow Insider and Massively.

218
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:50,600
There are layoffs of their staff with Joystiq 13 staffers laid off.

219
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,760
The Massively folks are going to be out of work by February 3rd.

220
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,000
And Wow Insider has also lost their staff.

221
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:05,800
So basically three whole sections of video game joy on the internet, some of the last

222
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,200
bastions of decent news are gone.

223
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:17,120
So as of February 3rd, which might as well be today.

224
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,480
Which I would say this.

225
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,520
If you want to petition about something, fucking petition about that.

226
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:29,000
If you show them that they're going to be losing a potential source of a big source

227
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,240
of revenue, this is...

228
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,800
Here's my concern.

229
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,760
And I absolutely say this with no disrespect to these companies or the people that work

230
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:46,840
there because as much as I razz the big corporate blogs sometimes, and obviously AOL is going

231
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,000
to be corporate when you're owned by AOL.

232
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,400
I'm very much, and I've always been about support indie podcasting, support indie blogging

233
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,760
and this stuff that's homegrown.

234
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,720
I always, I did have a place for Joystiq and the AOL blogs in my heart.

235
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,680
And part of that was because I felt like they were one of the rare blogs.

236
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,080
And when I say they, I mean Joystiq, Wow Insider, Massively, all of them.

237
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,440
They were one of the rare blogs that really kind of treated a lot of what they saw in

238
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,880
the indie scene.

239
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,920
Not just indie development games, but indie development publishing and podcasting and

240
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,560
everything as something that's like, they're equal.

241
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,920
I never felt like poo-pooed by anybody that had worked at Joystiq or any of these other

242
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,920
organizations.

243
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:35,560
I felt there was like, there's a common respect and a common decency and sense of, I guess,

244
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,800
decency there that I'm going to be honest, keeping it real, I haven't felt from other

245
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
places.

246
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,800
I'm not going to name names.

247
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,880
I'm not going to focus on negatives.

248
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,080
But all that stuff aside, I just kind of feel like there was a lot of real decent stuff

249
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,800
happening at Joystiq.

250
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,080
And it kind of blows my mind.

251
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:57,320
Obviously one of the big hot button issues in last year's was ethics and games journalism.

252
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,360
I'm not going to go too far down that slippery slope.

253
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,760
But what concerns me here is that I see people celebrating the loss of these blogs.

254
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,940
And I don't think there's anything to celebrate when these were some of the most ethical people

255
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,280
that were still around in what they were doing.

256
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,680
They don't run headlines that were clickbait like we see a lot of other sites do.

257
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,300
I mean, you guys know what game blogs out there do this consistently and you see it

258
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,740
shared on Facebook.

259
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:27,160
It's like, you know, check out these 12 hot cosplays from such and such that are very

260
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,680
only like tangentially related to video games.

261
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,320
I wish you guys could hear how hard I'm rolling my eyes.

262
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,400
Whereas Joystiq wasn't really about that.

263
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,760
And I always kind of, you know, I really, really respected them for that.

264
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,720
So I feel the pain of their loss.

265
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,020
Now to go to the part that I wanted to follow up to what Jamie was saying with, you know,

266
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,500
a big source of revenue and so forth.

267
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,680
Here's the hard question is, was it a big source of revenue?

268
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:00,840
Because I'm not as much as I liked reading it and I like supporting them and so forth.

269
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,840
Is there a lot of money to be made in that arena anymore?

270
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:10,200
And I'm not so sure there is, especially when tons and tons of people are using ad block

271
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,320
these days.

272
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,040
Where was Joystiq making money?

273
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,880
Or a lot of these corporate blogs, for crying out loud.

274
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:28,080
And I think a lot of these things that tailor headlines that foster the Facebook shares

275
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:32,620
and these clickbait articles and things like that, they get enough advertising revenue

276
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,860
from the people maybe that don't use ad block or whatever.

277
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,700
But unfortunately, these people who run their ships a little more ethically, like Joystiq

278
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:47,180
did, unfortunately, I think probably did end up costing money to run.

279
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,180
And it sucks.

280
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:53,280
Like, I mean, it's not an easy thing to say, but I think that's just the reality, you guys.

281
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,980
How was Joystiq making money?

282
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:59,580
I'm not so sure that, you know, you weren't paying to access it.

283
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:02,060
I bet a ton of you have ad blocker running.

284
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,620
Did you whitelist Joystiq?

285
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,620
Yeah.

286
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,700
I did too.

287
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,700
I did too.

288
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,380
But I bet there's a lot of people out there that didn't.

289
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,360
You know, and I'm not trying to make you feel bad, but I think that's also just the reality

290
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,360
of where we are.

291
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,020
And I think that's a lot, I mean, a lot of people just, you know, a lot of websites you

292
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:21,180
may block ads on, but I say, yeah, maybe that's me, unfortunately, because they didn't go

293
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,700
that route of trying to be clickbaity with your headlines that they didn't get a lot

294
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,100
of those shares or something on social media.

295
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,020
Maybe that was the case.

296
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,460
Let's see, go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

297
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,820
SHA100Matt says, yep, if people clicked on more ads, maybe they would have a case in

298
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,460
terms of revenue, but Joystiq doesn't really sell anything.

299
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,660
Let's see, RageNator says, the one big site that I really read was 1UP.com, but they bit

300
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,160
the dust.

301
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,980
Let's see, Dungeon Buster says, I drifted away from Joystiq years ago, but not because

302
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,900
of any ethics or issue with their reportage, just so many other sites arrive later to satisfy

303
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,900
my news needs.

304
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:01,900
Well, you know, and to be fair, there's a lot of, and I'm not accusing Joystiq of this,

305
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,960
I'm saying there is a lot of out there in the games journalism world, there's a lot

306
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,420
of copy paste journalism that goes on out there, you know, and I think there are a lot

307
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,900
of places for people to get news and thanks to things like Twitter and Facebook that keep

308
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:20,460
us a little more tapped in, I think people get their news maybe a little more directly

309
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,000
on social feeds where you don't necessarily even have to click over to a site like Joystiq

310
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
to see it.

311
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,720
And I think all those little things kind of hurt them, you know, collectively.

312
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,720
And again, I so apologize if any, I don't think any of those staffers happen to listen

313
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,240
to this show, but if you do, trust me, my heart goes out to you guys and I'm so sorry

314
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,880
if it sounds like I'm being a jerk right now.

315
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,480
And on top of that, the fact that they had the, they ran a story about, you know, their

316
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,760
site closing, they didn't even have an answer from, you know.

317
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,760
Yeah.

318
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,280
And there's that shady shit too, where it's like, you know, maybe they were making tons

319
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,280
of money.

320
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,080
Yeah, that's pretty nice to hear that your job's gone from somebody else other than,

321
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,080
you know, your boss.

322
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,680
That part's pretty shit.

323
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:04,240
I mean, here's, okay, here's the silver lining at the end, and maybe there will be another

324
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,620
website that will pick up a lot of these writers, but I just really hope there's no pressure

325
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,200
to make these writers make more clickbaity headlines.

326
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,440
I really hope that isn't what it turns into because that, I don't think that's what anybody

327
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,480
wants to see happen here out of this is, you know, it's gotta be more TMZ style stuff in

328
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,480
order to get clicks.

329
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,760
I really hope that doesn't happen, but here's an interesting comment in our chat room again

330
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,800
over at live.vognetwork.com.

331
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,840
Apricot Sushi says, I think the fact we're seeing a lot of people turn to Patreon while

332
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,200
big sites are getting cuts and going under says a lot.

333
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:43,440
Well, I think it's inevitable, and I'm almost positive, and I could be end up proving wrong,

334
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,040
being proved wrong, but I'm almost positive at least the WoW Insider branch, you're gonna

335
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:53,320
see either a Patreon or a Kickstarter coming from those guys next week because in their

336
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:59,680
goodbye note, they were like, you should follow us on Twitter, and on February 3rd,

337
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,480
you never know what the future might hold, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, like just put it

338
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,040
on a neon sign already, and believe me, I'm not blaming those guys for doing it.

339
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:15,840
If you're gonna do this Patreon or a Kickstarter route, strike while the iron is hot, you know,

340
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,480
people are gonna miss these sites when they're gone, and they're realizing that right now,

341
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,360
so would people be willing to pay for these sites?

342
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,400
I bet they would right now.

343
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,800
The longer you go on, I think the harder it's gonna be to justify, but especially something

344
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:36,000
like World of Warcraft that has a very tight-knit community, Blizzard has a lot of very rabid

345
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,840
fans that will support games that when Blizzard makes it, they'll play it, but if another

346
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:46,560
company makes it, they won't play it, consider what I'm talking about there with games like

347
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,320
Heroes of the Storm and Overwatch, right?

348
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:55,680
So there's a very loyal base there that I think will bolster up and support WoW Insider

349
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,000
specifically, because that's kind of the one.

350
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,320
Joystiq hasn't really hinted if they're planning anything like that massively, I have no idea

351
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,340
what they're planning either, but it seems like especially with the WoW Insider branch,

352
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,400
that's almost a given that that's what's gonna happen next week, is that there's gonna be

353
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,720
a Patreon or a Kickstarter to keep them going, so hopefully they will get the money to keep

354
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,880
their thing going, but how long?

355
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,320
A year?

356
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,320
Three years?

357
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,320
Who knows?

358
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,320
So.

359
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:30,840
Anyway, I'm sad to hear about this loss again, you know, Joystiq was a blog that I would

360
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,740
visit on a regular basis, I thought they were great, and you know, even some of the few

361
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:40,080
things that we've done on this show that went viral, quote-unquote, like the whole, you

362
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,480
know, you guys remember years and years ago, there was a whole president cat thing, and

363
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,720
we had a good time here on OLR, we were joking around about a Japanese game, Sukiban, so

364
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,480
I ran a Wii, that was about a cat that was all these little different mini games, and

365
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,960
Jamie said, oh, I think it translates kind of loosely to President Cat, and I'm like,

366
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,160
that's an awesome name for a game, let's have President Cat on the Wii, and why don't we

367
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,400
get games like this out here, and we started tweeting them, and the company noticed, right?

368
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,400
Well, Joystiq actually was like the first major blog to run a story on that, and I always

369
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,800
thought that was like really cool, I was like, wow, they're like tapped into indie sources

370
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,800
like that, you know?

371
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,640
Or even before that Katamari.

372
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:18,400
Yeah, and then, so it wasn't just the good news, but the not so good news, right?

373
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,800
Like the time that we posted some information that Namco didn't like that we posted, and

374
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,840
that went viral too, but again, I mean, despite the fact that that one was a little more painful

375
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,160
for us, it was still that they were tuned into what was going on in the indie world

376
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:39,360
as well as the PR, the things that they were getting handed from PR, which I wouldn't be

377
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,560
surprised if some of the Joystiq people end up in those positions where they're, you know,

378
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:49,000
doing PR and other types of, you know, on the other side of it for companies, big companies.

379
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,720
So, let's see, going again for some more comments from our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

380
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,800
Let's see, Dungeon Buster says, specialist sites have also added to the competition.

381
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:08,040
If I want pure industry news, I can go to places like Develop or Game Biz.

382
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,080
Tao says, I stopped going to any gaming site.

383
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,400
I just can't take the comments.

384
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,400
They make me lose faith on the human race.

385
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,640
Well, unfortunately, we don't have a lot, a lot, a lot of articles at vognetwork.com.

386
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,080
I mean, we just, we can't, right now, we're not at a stage where we can afford to pay

387
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,780
people to do articles, but if people want practice or resume type stuff, we're always

388
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,840
looking for people to write stuff, and so we do have some people that write some things

389
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,840
very limited.

390
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,540
If we do ever turn a profit, I'd be happy to pay writers.

391
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,240
We get some of that coming on vognetwork.com.

392
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,680
We moderate comments, all of them, so, you know, and obviously our site is family enough

393
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:53,420
where that's not really a problem for us yet, but you never know what's going to go viral.

394
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:57,080
You just never know what's going to go viral, and then once it goes viral, then everybody's

395
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,920
got something to say, so.

396
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,760
You know what the rule, the stem of the problem is?

397
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,760
What's that?

398
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,920
Too many of those free month subscriptions at AOL.

399
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,840
It just hurt them so much that it just can't recover.

400
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,040
Those fortresses built out of the free discs, the free sample discs.

401
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,040
Just did them in.

402
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,040
Oh boy, alright.

403
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:22,920
Anyhow, so, having a drink, throwing one back for our friends over at AOL, Joystiq, WoW

404
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,960
Insider, and Massively.

405
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,360
May y'all, and I should say, because it's not picked up in any of the game blogs, but

406
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,600
there's another AOL blog that I read quite frequently, the unofficial Apple web blog,

407
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,360
TUAW, that was also impacted by this, and they're getting shuttered.

408
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:44,440
So pouring out a 40 to all those fine blogs over at AOL, and may y'all land on your feet

409
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,240
real soon.

410
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,920
At least y'all have the respect of a lot of people in the industry, and so I think with

411
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,880
that on your resume and considering the situations, I think y'all are going to bounce back real

412
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,880
quick.

413
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,880
I really hope so.

414
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,880
I really hope so.

415
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,480
And hey, you won't be working for AOL anymore.

416
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,600
Thumbs up.

417
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,160
Try to look for the silver lining.

418
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:07,800
Alright, let's get into some of the regular segments we do here at Orange Launch Radio,

419
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,040
and then we'll get into some other news going on this week, but yeah, not a lot of great

420
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,040
news this week, guys.

421
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,040
I don't know.

422
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,040
I don't know.

423
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,060
Anyway, let's try to cheer things up a little bit with the games themselves.

424
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,160
You know, sometimes we play video games to put us in a better mood, and talk about the

425
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,280
games that we've been playing this week with How Was Your Gaming Week?

426
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,120
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

427
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,520
I really didn't play too much.

428
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,840
I did some Dragon Age, but other than that, no, I did play some Final Fantasy XIV for

429
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:41,200
a little bit on Monday, but really, I haven't really done much else in terms of gaming just

430
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,100
because it's been a really stupidly, stupidly busy week.

431
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:55,360
That and I did buy somebody in this little group of ours a game that I am going to request

432
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:01,560
that he play as soon as he gets a chance to.

433
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,840
I will not say what it is until said person is ready to announce it.

434
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,600
Well, doesn't he have to finish the previous one?

435
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,940
No.

436
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:17,480
He needs to go right into the second one, because, okay, I'll just fuckin' say it.

437
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,960
I bought Rob Five Nights at Freddy's 2, and he's gotta play it.

438
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,280
I don't care if he's finished the first one, he has to play it, because the third one's

439
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,280
coming out.

440
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,400
Yeah, I did see that in my Steam library.

441
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,200
I have to do the VoG Jam stream first, which is still something, or the YouTubes.

442
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,200
I'm not gonna end up doing a live stream anymore, because all the games run in different resolutions

443
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,020
and things, so I'm gonna just make a variety of YouTubes, but until I finish that project,

444
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,880
no live streams.

445
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,600
But that will be on the list.

446
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,700
Hopefully, I can get Shane to come over, or maybe you to come over, and you guys can taunt

447
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,720
me a little bit while I play.

448
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,700
I'm sure it'll be a hoot and a holler.

449
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,660
Just in time for Five Nights at Freddy's 3, which I'm sure is coming out very soon.

450
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,460
I really wish that would become a movie series.

451
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,460
It might.

452
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,460
I think it could.

453
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:06,580
I think it probably should, honestly, because it's such a simple premise, and, you know,

454
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:12,260
I mean, hell, they're remaking, like, really shitty movies now, so why not just do one

455
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,260
of those?

456
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,460
It's starting to become a Minecraft-level phenomenon.

457
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:21,380
I mean, maybe not that big, because it's gonna be harder to market it towards kids.

458
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,140
I think it's a...

459
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:29,620
You can't just compare A to B, but it is definitely, like, a phenomenon in the style of Minecraft.

460
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:33,700
I think there's so much, like, lore and all this other stuff that people are...

461
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,700
That's the part I like about it.

462
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:41,340
I can't play the games for shit, but I watch the videos and read the crap about it.

463
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,240
And that, going back and reading, like, the actual case that they theorized it was based

464
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,800
off of, it was...

465
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
That creeped me out.

466
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,760
The fact that the original thing happened, with that, what was it, a Chuck E. Cheese

467
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,760
or something?

468
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,760
Yeah.

469
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,760
Yeah.

470
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,760
A showbiz pizza, I think.

471
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,760
Yeah, it was a showbiz.

472
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,760
What it was back in the day.

473
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,760
It's saying Pizza Time Theater.

474
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

475
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,400
All right, so, if that's it for your gaming week...

476
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
Thank you, Nolan Bushnell.

477
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

478
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,280
I didn't play a whole ton.

479
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,440
I was actually working on my game most of the week, and I've gotten...

480
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,760
I'm trying to get to the point where I can just, like, play a level, and then once I

481
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,640
get that, I can actually just start building levels for it.

482
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,120
So I have the starting sequence part done for each level, and then I was just working

483
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,640
on the finishing thing.

484
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:36,240
The problem is my logo that I did in 3D for, like, the end part when you finish a race.

485
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,120
It didn't look very good.

486
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,660
Just shot straight on, because it's black and white, so it looked 2D almost.

487
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:46,700
So I needed it kind of spinning towards the camera to make it look cooler.

488
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:53,980
So I'm working on that, and then my cat decides to start programming last night, and so she

489
00:24:53,980 --> 00:25:00,540
sat down on my laptop and did a fighter plays on all of my scripts in my game, and so I

490
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,540
had to fix that.

491
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:05,940
Thankfully, that was pretty quick to fix, and, you know, she's so jealous.

492
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,940
I swear to God.

493
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,260
It's like, you're not paying attention to me all the time.

494
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,260
What the hell?

495
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,300
So I did that, and then actual game playing.

496
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,700
I played more of LEGO Marvel Super Hero just because my son's playing it.

497
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,920
I'm already finished with the game, so there's not really much more I need to do with it,

498
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,460
other than I just messing around with some of the glitches in the game and stuff.

499
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,020
So that was fun.

500
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,220
And what else?

501
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,380
Oh, watch some more awesome games done quick.

502
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:40,020
Like I watched the run for I Wanna Be the Boshi and New Super Mario Bros. and, oh,

503
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,540
New Super Mario Bros Wii.

504
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,620
What else?

505
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:49,500
Part of the Portal 2 run, but I fell asleep, so, oh well.

506
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,500
But I'm really digging that stuff.

507
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:56,660
I do want to play some more Gata the Hell, but I just haven't gotten around to it.

508
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:01,140
And I don't know, I've been looking at my PlayStation Network library and I'm like,

509
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,860
crap, man, I've got a lot of stuff that I haven't touched on there yet.

510
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,060
Like I bought Battlefield 4 a while ago, I'm like, shit, I haven't even played that.

511
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:12,420
And then my stack of games I bought when I got the system, I'm like, shit, I still haven't

512
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,220
even played Watch Dogs or Destiny yet, and it's just sitting in the case, just collecting

513
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,220
dust.

514
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,580
So I've got a lot of stuff to play.

515
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,580
After I finish my game.

516
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,580
Alright.

517
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,580
And then my other game.

518
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,540
Good priorities, good priorities.

519
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,540
My gaming week.

520
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:30,340
Actually, I've had a pretty active gaming week, although not a lot of new stuff to note,

521
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,180
since not a lot of new stuff has been coming out, but I was continuing to play Fantasy

522
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,860
Life earlier this week.

523
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,860
And I've been having fun with that.

524
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:41,060
I started to get into some of the crafting a little bit since I was doing a wizard for

525
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,060
my life in the beginning.

526
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:46,220
I was like, oh, let me try going into, I think they call it tailor cloth crafting, whatever.

527
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:49,700
I think it's a tailor to see if I can maybe make myself some armor.

528
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,860
So you know, it's kind of playing a little bit of that story.

529
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,980
And now I'm like, oh, maybe I should get into gathering and I can totally see where this

530
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,300
is like a gamer add like me guys worst nightmare because it's like, oh, I want to play a little

531
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,300
bit of this.

532
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,540
Oh, but then I want to play a little bit of this because I always see these little mind

533
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,540
things everywhere.

534
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,540
I want to mind those.

535
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,540
Oh, and I want to fish and I've got to do this.

536
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,300
And I'm never going to get anywhere in that game because I'm going to keep getting distracted

537
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,780
by all these different things there is to do.

538
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:15,140
Dude, level five is really good at making grind fests.

539
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:19,020
They are very, very good at making grind fests and, but Fantasy Life is good.

540
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,660
I talked about that last week and I'm having fun with that game.

541
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,020
Let's see.

542
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,220
So was playing a little bit of that.

543
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:30,460
A lot of Diablo three on PC with the season is ending on Tuesday.

544
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,820
So Alan has actually been very helpful.

545
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,500
He's been playing a lot more than me.

546
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:40,420
He's going to hit Paragon 300 tonight on his seasonal character, 300 Paragon levels.

547
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,520
He was at like two 96 or something before the show.

548
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,980
So he'll definitely hit that tonight.

549
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:47,100
I'm at maybe one 50.

550
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:52,780
I mean, I've been playing a lot, but not like a lot, but I've been having fun and Alan helped

551
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,780
me get some achievements.

552
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:59,020
We finally, uh, we killed, uh, this guy on torment six, you have to get to get an achievement.

553
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,480
It's like this complicated thing where you have to build all these keys, these, some

554
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,480
of the boss.

555
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,480
And we did that.

556
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,260
We got to greater lift rift level 30, which I didn't think I'd be able to see on my wizard,

557
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:11,220
but by golly, we did it and got a new place on the scoreboard.

558
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,460
So that was all really exciting.

559
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,360
So that was seasonal on a PC.

560
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,900
I haven't been playing as much on PlayStation four, but a friend of mine picked it up on

561
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,000
PS four and I know I have other friends that play on there.

562
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,660
So probably what I'll do in the downtime between seasons on PC, I'm probably going

563
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,900
to try to pick up PS four because it is still one of my goals this year to get my platinum

564
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,180
trophy in Diablo.

565
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:30,180
Dang it.

566
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,340
So that's something I will certainly work on.

567
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,780
So, uh, yeah, I played a little bit of that as well.

568
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:38,100
Um, so yeah, kind of a, a lot of the same stuff.

569
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,940
I'm like some final fantasy 14 here and there a little bit.

570
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:46,460
I did some geometry wars three earlier today, um, but not a lot, a lot of new stuff to note.

571
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:52,460
Um, one other thing I will mention, uh, princess Irene, who was on the show a few weeks ago,

572
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,140
she does her other show, uh, the multi-tap podcast.

573
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,940
She was here promoting that.

574
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,320
Uh, she called me up the other day and was like, let's go play DDR.

575
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,700
And I was like, Oh my gosh, it's been forever.

576
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,700
Why not?

577
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,260
Let's go play DDR like old school times.

578
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:09,340
So we actually went out to Roseville golf land, which, which really is where this show

579
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,740
was born.

580
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:17,780
Despite the sad commentary, you mean spawned from the pits, uh, despite where, uh, you

581
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,820
know, despite the state of arcades today and the fact that it's like, it's all like ticket

582
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:25,520
grabbing machines now, I did see some pretty cool arcade cabinets.

583
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,600
So they had a Mario Kart deluxe.

584
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,180
I did not know there was now a Mario Kart deluxe cabinet and it looked fancy.

585
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:35,340
I didn't get a chance to play it cause there was just kids nonstop going through that game,

586
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,340
but it looked really fun.

587
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,340
Uh, sad though.

588
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:40,380
It was like the Mario Kart tracks on the arcade games are so like blah.

589
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,980
It's just like, yeah, it's like, Ooh, well it's a loop.

590
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,980
They were in the early games.

591
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,980
I don't know about deluxe though.

592
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,980
I haven't played deluxe yet.

593
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,580
So at least for the first couple.

594
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:53,460
Um, so, but I saw, I was like, wow, those are some fancy looking cabs.

595
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,180
Uh, so we played a little bit of DDR, so that was fun.

596
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:01,780
Uh, we were playing some max two for you, uh, old school DDR fans, but man, when you

597
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,820
don't play DDR for a long time, you really lose stamina.

598
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,820
Okay.

599
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:09,740
So like Irene and I were like, all right, we'll do some, we'll do some standard and

600
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,620
some basic songs, red foot and yellow foot songs.

601
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,300
We were, we were doing okay on that.

602
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:18,980
So then for the last song I was like, okay, we got to try and do something on maniac.

603
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,420
Let's do something on maniac.

604
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,660
So I put it on the hardest difficulty green feet.

605
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,660
Right.

606
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,460
And I was like, let's do blow my whistle, baby.

607
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,460
Everybody.

608
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,460
Everybody remembers that song, right?

609
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:35,060
If you've ever walked by a DDR max two machine, you've heard that you've heard this song before,

610
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,060
right?

611
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,660
It's really annoying and awesome to play.

612
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:41,540
Uh, but it's only like a seven foot song, so it won't be that hard, right?

613
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,900
Oh my God.

614
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:47,380
Because the seven footer is usually like nonstop running and jumping and all that stuff.

615
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:55,240
Like at the end of it, I was, I was like having a full on as I, I, I, I remember even

616
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:01,680
just trying like basic stuff in the last time I played, I need to get my stamina back out

617
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,680
of shape.

618
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,980
Oh, I need to get my stamina back.

619
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:10,260
Uh, and uh, then for the very, very, very last song, you know, Irene and I said, okay,

620
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,820
this is the last song we're going to do all day.

621
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,820
This is fine.

622
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,500
So I was like, all right, fuck it.

623
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,960
Let's do, let's do another maniac song.

624
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:27,960
She put it on a Ryan seven, eight, which is the, like, I'd cue up the MP3.

625
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,880
I love it when you sing DDR songs, Loki, but that's honestly what it sounds like.

626
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,840
But the, I will never, okay.

627
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,880
So the, the, the pattern that you dance to in the song, do, do, do, do, do, do, do,

628
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,320
do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

629
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:45,560
That's how fast your feet are moving and that do jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump,

630
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,680
jump, jump, jump, jump, like that's how fast your feet are moving.

631
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,680
Right?

632
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:55,400
So I did that one on nine footer and I'm very proud because my 36 year old ass got a 300

633
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:00,600
combo and I damn near full combo the whole song I fucked up in the last six measures

634
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,600
though.

635
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,080
Like there's just too much going on at the end, but I, I was so close to a full combo

636
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,460
and I was like, this old guy still got it.

637
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,060
So that felt pretty good to be able to do that.

638
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,540
It has kind of motivated me a little bit to try and get my stamina back a little bit.

639
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:17,020
So I need to like do one of those like couch to 5k type things or something.

640
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,340
Just something to get me in the habit of moving.

641
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,340
Couch to nine feet.

642
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,500
What do they call that?

643
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,500
It's a couch to 5k.

644
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,500
Is that what?

645
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,500
Okay.

646
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,500
But it should be, um, we should do a...

647
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,500
Oh, couch to nine footer.

648
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,500
Couch to nine feet.

649
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,500
I get it now.

650
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,500
Yeah.

651
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,580
Uh, I, I really do want to do something like that.

652
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,420
I was never skinnier in my life than the years I played DDR.

653
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:37,060
Of course it helped that I was dating a vegan who really loved to cook.

654
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,700
And so like vegans don't eat.

655
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:44,020
I don't even know, like, you know, the newer machines, like they don't even have the same

656
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,020
foot levels anywhere.

657
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,420
I'm like, I don't understand, you know, what these levels are anymore.

658
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,420
Yeah, no, I know.

659
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,940
Well, it was a max two machine.

660
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:54,740
I can, I can speak max to max two, maybe extreme.

661
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,340
That was back from my day stream.

662
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,540
It's like kind of, eh, no.

663
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:03,420
So anyway, and then, uh, Alan alchemy's in chat reminding me of something else we saw,

664
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:07,380
uh, over at Roseau golf land, a fucking candy crush arcade game.

665
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:10,500
They had a fucking flappy bird and a candy crush.

666
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,860
Like all these fucking iPhone games are becoming arcade games that shoot out tickets.

667
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:22,580
Why would you play a game that's free, but instead pay money because you get tickets

668
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:25,220
and you can redeem those tickets for crap.

669
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:30,100
I'm surprised the tickets don't get you codes to get something in the game on your iPhone.

670
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,100
The camp flappy bird.

671
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,300
Oh, just to get good, give it full circle.

672
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,060
Why not gives you, what is it?

673
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,740
Like little gum drop bombs or whatever the fuck they are in candy crush.

674
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:43,660
You can trade in tickets and get a code for some of those on iTunes or Google play or

675
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,660
whatever.

676
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,660
Surprise.

677
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,700
I wouldn't be surprised off.

678
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,700
That was the thing.

679
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,700
They bring it full circle.

680
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,700
All right.

681
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,700
Anyway, that was my gaming week.

682
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,900
Very long winded, but, uh, you know, a little trip to the arcades and all that good stuff.

683
00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:00,300
Um, before we get into tonight's gaming news, some quick housekeeping, uh, we will be here

684
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,740
throughout the coming weeks.

685
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,660
No shows off planned yet, except maybe in early March.

686
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,900
That's still developing.

687
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:10,580
Uh, however, you can always friend us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

688
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:16,100
You can also friend us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. And we are going to be debuting

689
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,140
a new segment tonight.

690
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,940
As Jason mentioned in the intro, I'll tell you more about that at the beginning of part

691
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,740
B is where we're going to put it right before we get into rapid fire news.

692
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:27,560
I'll talk to you more about that when we get there and try something new based on some

693
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,380
things you guys said last week, believe it or not, this is, this is an interactive show.

694
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:36,340
And just because we've been doing it for coming up on 13 years this June, doesn't mean

695
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:40,700
we can't change things once in a while when the listeners, uh, give good ideas and suggestions

696
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,700
and feedback.

697
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:45,520
So we'll talk about that at the beginning of part B. Uh, meanwhile, let's get into some

698
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,660
gaming news, lots of other stuff going on in the world.

699
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,660
We're going to start off.

700
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,900
I have a feeling we're going to get into it.

701
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,900
Here we go.

702
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,100
Loki started us off with some gaming news.

703
00:34:54,100 --> 00:35:03,440
So new to our, uh, Nintendo has graciously allowed people to use their content and collect

704
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,940
ad revenue from it on YouTube.

705
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,340
That's so awesome.

706
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:14,260
So nice of them, except there's some little asterisks is that you need to be aware of.

707
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:18,860
First off, uh, this would be through their brand new affiliate program, the Nintendo

708
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,440
creators program.

709
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:26,920
So when you sign up with them, um, you can basically register whole channels or certain

710
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,920
videos.

711
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:35,840
And basically if you do, um, just an individual video, you will be offered 60% of the ad revenue.

712
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:42,880
Um, and if for a whole channel, 70% of the ad revenue and, um, they are basically paying

713
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,440
you via PayPal.

714
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:50,320
So they're collecting all the ad revenue and then paying you on the backend for that.

715
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,680
And I guess, um, they'll allow you to use their videos and make money off them.

716
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,000
I think it's crap.

717
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Why do you think it's the reason?

718
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,080
I think it's crafts because she makes so little from ad revenues anyways.

719
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:08,240
In fact, a good, good explanation for this was, um, total biscuit actually did a breakdown

720
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,240
of this and why this was a bad thing.

721
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:17,440
And basically breaking down that, say you make a hundred dollars on a video for ad revenue.

722
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:23,800
And at the end, after you're done paying, you know, the fees for, um, YouTube, from

723
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,920
PayPal, from, um, what Nintendo takes out for every hundred dollars that you're actually

724
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,860
making in ad revenue, you're actually only collecting two or $22 of that.

725
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,680
And so it's just, it's crap.

726
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,520
Honestly, I think this type of thing is not a good thing considering that, you know, you

727
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,760
had some companies like Microsoft that were kind of, you know what, we don't want you

728
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,160
using our properties for, uh, making, you know, money off of them, basically use, make

729
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:54,120
any sort of monetization, but then they went ahead and reversed their stance on that.

730
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,920
And I think that that's kind of the way that the company should be, honestly, cool.

731
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,760
If you want to participate in this, go right ahead.

732
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:05,400
But like, if I had the time to make, you know, more videos and stuff that had to do with,

733
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,880
you know, game play and stuff like that, I would not be choosing incentive products.

734
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,640
There's plenty of, plenty, plenty of other games out there rather than Nintendo games

735
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,720
that I could be playing.

736
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:20,200
I've got a whole fucking Steam backlog that, you know, is a testament to that.

737
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:28,020
I don't need to have the privilege of paying them money to show their game online.

738
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,760
That's so fucking backwards.

739
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,700
This is the kind of shit that gets you into the mess that you're in right now, where your

740
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,280
first party games are the only thing supporting that damn system.

741
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,120
So I don't know.

742
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,280
I've had a lot of time to think about this topic and I'm about to say some things that

743
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:49,820
might actually contradict things I've said 10, 15 episodes ago when, you know, this topic

744
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:54,200
first came up and I, opinions sometimes change, they shift and so forth.

745
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,160
But this is where my head is currently at with this stuff is that there are some things

746
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,440
I agree with you on, Loki.

747
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,960
Fundamentally though, I believe Nintendo deserves a cut.

748
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,960
I do.

749
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,560
I'm going to ask some people to hear that, but I fully believe that Nintendo deserves

750
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,280
a cut of the money.

751
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,800
And I think the best example I would have for this is something like Mystery Science

752
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:19,160
Theater 3000, where if, you know, if they are going to be skewing a movie and interjecting

753
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,980
their own dialogue and so forth, they still have to secure the rights for that movie and

754
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:29,240
give a cut or pay a one time fee or something from the original movie maker, unless the

755
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,440
movie's what, 75, 50 years old, and it's considered the public domain at that point, which I think

756
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,620
has happened with some of the movies they've done in the past.

757
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,800
But I digress.

758
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,400
I know a lot of Let's Players say that, well, people don't watch it for the games, they

759
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,280
watch it for the commentary or the opinions or things like that.

760
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:48,240
Well, if that's the case, try putting your commentary or opinion out there without the

761
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,980
game and see how well that does.

762
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:54,360
I do think the games do play an integral part and these things would not exist without the

763
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,360
game.

764
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:00,720
That being said, I think the method this is all being done is a little screwy and I can

765
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,720
agree with that.

766
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:07,000
I totally get the concept where it's stupid that YouTube takes a cut and PayPal takes

767
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,680
a cut and then, then, then, like that's all a little bit ridiculous and I get that.

768
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,860
Everybody's taking a piece off the top.

769
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:18,640
Here's where I think the problem ultimately lies and I think you've got the Let's Players

770
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,000
pointing fingers at Nintendo, you've got Nintendo pointing fingers at the Let's Players.

771
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,320
Do you know where the real fucking problem is?

772
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:30,960
The problem is YouTube and I've been saying this forever.

773
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,240
That's the one message that I think I have been consistent on from the very beginning.

774
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:42,040
The problem is YouTube but they are such a behemoth that nobody is making them do anything

775
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,280
about it and that's what blows my mind.

776
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:49,760
In my opinion, YouTube should have an established standard for this shit and be done with it

777
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,760
already.

778
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:57,040
But YouTube also needs to have some type of appeal system for their users as well as the

779
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,040
companies that want to contest things that are being used outside of copyright law that

780
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,120
are on the service and so forth.

781
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:07,200
YouTube is a giant fucking brainless robot.

782
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,640
Not only that but they're going to continue content ID matching stuff and you basically

783
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:17,040
have to get approval before you're able to make money off those videos.

784
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:22,760
Say for example you do a review series and you're reviewing a Nintendo game or something

785
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:27,440
like that then they could just say oh we're not going to approve your video.

786
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:33,280
Say you're critical on a certain Nintendo game, theoretically they could just say no

787
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,440
we're not going to approve your video.

788
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:42,880
I understand that's a little extreme but as I'll talk about later on in the show, it may

789
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:49,240
not be that out of the norm considering how people are manipulating the system to get

790
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,140
what they want.

791
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:55,620
There is a certain amount of fair use that needs to be allotted so that you can have

792
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,700
these reviews and you can have these critical opinions and so forth.

793
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:04,780
But when people have like 90 minute long let's plays where it's just we're making jokes along

794
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:08,380
with this game that we're playing along in the background, I'm not so sure that meets

795
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,420
the guidelines of fair use.

796
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:16,740
But YouTube needs to come out and say it is X, the line is drawn here so that way at least

797
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,900
everybody's playing by the same rules.

798
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:21,580
I understand let's plays but let's say for example you're doing a news show or something

799
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:27,420
like that on YouTube and you're talking about the news and a Nintendo story comes up like

800
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:31,140
oh Nintendo announced that such and such games coming out and you're talking about that and

801
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:37,860
you have part of the trailer playing in the background and they monetize that video.

802
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,220
In my opinion that's a YouTube problem.

803
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:45,380
That is fair use and YouTube should not be allowing that to be contested because a robot

804
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,780
fucking match that.

805
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,780
That's the problem.

806
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:52,020
And I've told yeah that's fair use if you're doing a news thing and you show an incidental

807
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,860
Nintendo thing absolutely that should be the news thing.

808
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:59,380
But here's the other side of that is that I also think there should be and this this

809
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:02,780
should be something that maybe Nintendo should kind of step up.

810
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:08,740
There should be kind of like a certain threshold like if you're making less than a hundred

811
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:14,180
dollars a year on YouTube videos which is where a lot of people are at a lot a lot of

812
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:17,220
people are at that line if you're making like less than a hundred dollars a year on

813
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:20,580
YouTube videos I kind of don't think this should apply to you.

814
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:26,180
And I think I mean I'm you know I understand the need for consistency and so forth but

815
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:30,100
if Nintendo wants to be good guy Nintendo then draw a line.

816
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:34,900
But I'm sorry I do have a lot of problems feeling sympathy for these people that like

817
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,140
you make millions of dollars.

818
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:43,580
You know somebody like PewDiePie makes millions of dollars off these let's plays and so forth

819
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:48,020
and you know they're complaining about oh we know we're going to get you know some of

820
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:51,300
this money to and it's all this whole ass line system whatever Nintendo wants to cut

821
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:55,760
the money but but but but I'm sorry I have a little problem feeling that much sympathy

822
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:01,260
for you when then XYZ gaming company just had to lay off 200 people this week and we're

823
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:04,300
going to hear an incident of that a little later on in the show.

824
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:08,620
Here's the reason why they have that kind of attitude is because they're fucking having

825
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:14,340
PewDiePie fucking quoted like a box quoted on a fucking advertisement in stores like

826
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:18,060
they showed that for I don't remember what fucking game it was but they had a PewDiePie

827
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,060
quote on it.

828
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,420
I think it was for Dying Light.

829
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:25,680
That's why that's why he's got a big head about this shit is because he's fucking getting

830
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,400
quoted as part of marketing for these games.

831
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,220
So yeah I mean he's a major channel and the fact that he's saying that I'm not going to

832
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:39,380
cover Nintendo products you know unless I feel like playing one of their games then

833
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:44,340
that's fine he has the right to do that but at the same time that's also kind of his thought

834
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:48,940
is that and I don't want to defend him because honestly personally I don't like the guy but

835
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:55,900
I find I find him I've seen 60 seconds of a video of his one time and that's it but

836
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:01,300
I'm not naive enough not to think he's not no I understand it could be a personality

837
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:05,860
plays on YouTube whatever I don't that's fine I just don't like his videos but I don't

838
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:12,780
I'm not faulting him for it per se but I'm just saying that you know it's up to his thought

839
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:19,660
is that he's helping market these games and that they should be thankful that he is you

840
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:25,300
know playing their products because he's in the past driven like for example they you

841
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:29,500
know in his Tumblr he cited you know like skate three he showed them playing skate three

842
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,100
all of a sudden that game shot back up through the charts even though it had been out for

843
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:37,980
a while that type of thing so he's got a sort of a point but at the same time I mean you

844
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:41,440
shouldn't feel entitled by that but I just think they're going about it the wrong way

845
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:48,300
I think you want people to be making like fan videos for it and so what if they're making

846
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:52,920
some money off of ad revenue I mean are you really that hard up for money that you need

847
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:58,340
to be making pennies off of these videos I mean it's not pennies though Loki I mean some

848
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:03,220
people it's not pennies but it's ad revenue though it's not if they want to put out creative

849
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:07,940
videos and charge ad revenue for it then by all means Nintendo you make some new original

850
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:12,940
content out there like let's plays hell just hire some of your treehouse people or something

851
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:16,420
to do some like interesting videos and start monetizing that shit if that's what you want

852
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:21,620
to collect money on but I feel I would actually agree that Nintendo can make a lot of money

853
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:27,620
doing in-house productions of this stuff I but but I also think you know it's not you

854
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:31,660
know that's why I talk about the threshold when we are talking about pennies then maybe

855
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:34,820
Nintendo should just write it off good guy Nintendo right but what we're talking about

856
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:37,740
hundreds of thousands of dollars which is what we're talking about with people like

857
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:42,460
PewDiePie I think it's totally okay that's that's ten people's jobs for the year out

858
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:46,500
of their pockets it's making no money on their pockets it's just like oh we feel we should

859
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,560
be getting paid some more money that's all it really is I think of anything you should

860
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:56,780
be putting as as few barriers between you and the people that want to you know expose

861
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:00,700
your game to others or like play up the game I mean if you're just putting that barrier

862
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,420
out there and saying okay well you could do this but you're gonna have to jump through

863
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:08,820
all these hoops in order to be getting paid you know for monetizing these videos fuck

864
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:14,820
it just I wouldn't do it I would just play something else I understand the concept of

865
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:18,520
it doesn't hurt them and so forth and the free advertising and so forth but you have

866
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:23,140
to understand there's another layer this is something that somebody said to me this week

867
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:27,160
about a particular game as I was telling this individual you should check out this

868
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:31,260
game you know I know it gets a lot of mixed reviews and some people say good things about

869
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:34,540
it some people say not so good things about it but I kind of think this game is up your

870
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:38,380
alley you should check it out and the person said to me isn't that one of those games it's

871
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:41,760
about three hours to beat and I said yeah it's only about three hours to beat and they

872
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,460
said you know I'll just look up a let's play of it on YouTube and I'll just watch it on

873
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:50,620
YouTube that way I don't have to spend the money and buy it that was something that was

874
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:55,340
said to me I am not making it up that it I mean I might be summarizing some quotes

875
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:58,660
and things but essentially that is the gist of the conversation then that's a problem

876
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:03,300
that that happens that's a problem then with the game designer if that your game is basically

877
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,580
good for one playthrough and that's it and there is no replayability to it then yes I

878
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:11,980
don't think you should spend the money on that if for example a perfect example of that

879
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:17,960
is that fucking Melger solid you know ground zeros bullshit that they put out they charge

880
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:22,320
you know like 30 bucks for and it's like a four hour game there's not much replayability

881
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:27,080
there so I'm not gonna spend my money on it so I see that exactly if like let's say for

882
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:30,640
example Call of Duty campaign if you're looking at like the single-player version of Call

883
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:35,040
Duty and you just want to know what the story is and say fuck it I wouldn't purchase the

884
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,520
game if it you're only gonna get one playthrough out of it what if I told you this game it

885
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:43,800
was a $10 indie game same problem though if it's three hours long and you're paying $10

886
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,720
so it costs 15 to go see a movie can I take a three hour movie and just put it on YouTube

887
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:54,080
no you cannot but there's some interactive problem there well then I'm sure that they're

888
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:59,080
gonna they can just monetize or do a copyright claim on if that's the problem they have such

889
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:03,200
a problem with people putting the if their three hour game on YouTube then do a copyright

890
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,960
claim against it since they can do that for the movie that I mean I'm assuming if that's

891
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:12,040
the problem they don't want the exposure of their short game on YouTube then they have

892
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:16,040
the rights to make a claim against it all right let me read some comments from chat

893
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,960
I don't mean to ignore folks in chat and Jamie I have no idea if you even have a thought

894
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:25,120
on this or if you're just kind of like there's there's no answer to this problem I don't

895
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:32,400
know Jamie I'm always like I like free money I like playing Nintendo I'm telling you personally

896
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:37,800
if I have you know whenever I finish a game someday I don't fucking care there's more

897
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,280
exposure it gets better for me you making money up if you're making hundreds of thousand

898
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,320
dollars of it yeah I'm a little jealous but good for you I mean who cares I think that

899
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:52,400
indie developers should have their own licensed let's play channels I I just I honestly think

900
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:58,080
if like twitch I almost said Justin TV if twitch TV could come out and just be like

901
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:03,940
we have signed agreements with Nintendo Sony and Microsoft on the rules for let's plays

902
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:08,120
and we're gonna introduce twitch on demand and you can record these let's plays and we'll

903
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:12,040
interject ads into it and you're gonna get 75% and they get 25% I don't know I'm making

904
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:16,840
these numbers up if they were to roll that out like this week and we have signed agreements

905
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:23,160
with these big three huge industry standard players and we have these signed agreements

906
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,840
this is how it's gonna be that would stab YouTube in the fucking heart it would and

907
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:33,000
now now it's game fucking on once again it's is the fewer barriers you have between your

908
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:39,640
consumer and you know their money basically you know making money off these videos the better it

909
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:43,640
will be if it's easier for me to make money off of twitch than it is YouTube then of course I'm

910
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:47,560
gonna go to twitch all right I got to do some chat room comments because it is a show where every

911
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:52,680
gamer has a voice sadly I can't read everything but let me get to some comments here um sg100

912
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:57,400
matt saying it's not about the amount of money it's about drawing a line and people profiting

913
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,640
off your products if they don't draw it now then there will be a point that someone will make

914
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:07,640
millions and millions off their game and the creators not seeing any of that uh pow in our

915
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:12,760
chat room at live.vog network.com says also it's a cultural thing I like this because it makes you

916
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:18,600
consider something different it's a cultural thing Japanese corporations are fighting a lot to stop

917
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:24,760
the quote let's watch the ending on YouTube thing uh now that pow says that it actually makes me

918
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:30,760
think Sony does this too you just don't hear about it as much but uh developers can block sections of

919
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:35,400
games from being recorded remember that uh when they they do the recording on ps4 sections of

920
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,880
games can be blocked so that way the endings of games can't be posted as easily you just like

921
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:43,640
telling me to a movie who gives a shit I'm sorry I don't buy that as an excuse

922
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:51,720
uh I kind of agree to a point that you can't stop it but they can make it harder uh let's see

923
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:57,240
dungeon buster says YouTube dug themselves into this hole in flying by the seat of their copyright

924
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:03,800
pants for so long uh let's see Kaijuto in chat says I disagree video games are not movies it's

925
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:09,960
different uh tiger claw says this is affecting giant bomb as well you'll have to watch videos

926
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:14,360
of their Nintendo coverage on their site well what's interesting about that solution is it's

927
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:20,440
removing YouTube which I have said is the problem it's removing YouTube from the equation which

928
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:25,400
considering that most of the stuff I think giant bomb bomb does is and I don't visit that site

929
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:29,160
every day so you'll have to correct me if I'm wrong most of the cases where they're using this

930
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:33,640
are going to be the review and news type I don't they don't do a lot of extended let's plays right

931
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:39,000
I don't think so they might but if they do and I'm just not aware of it keep in mind

932
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:44,040
Nintendo would have every right to step in and say you need to remove it or we're not

933
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:48,040
going to give you these games if you don't I mean they would have the right to play hardball

934
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:53,240
I mean I realize that could have ramifications but that could be an alley we go down if that happens

935
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:59,160
Marissa Congusto in chat at live.vognetware.com says still have to pay when you sample a song

936
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:03,080
I don't think it should matter if the profit is negligible but after that I see the point

937
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:10,280
so uh and powen chat says people go to jail in Japan for posting a single anime episode

938
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:15,320
it's not different with games it is different because there's an interactive element to games

939
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:21,080
where it's an anime episode there is not if you post a video of a game online it's not the same

940
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:25,160
as playing a game whereas if you post a movie online it's the same as watching the movie because

941
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:29,640
you're watching on the internet versus watching in a theater I'm with you to a point I mean

942
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:35,160
obviously I don't think anybody should go to jail over a let's play but uh I I think the let's play

943
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:39,480
simply would not exist without the game makers that's that they had a hand in creating the

944
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:46,280
content too it's a shared thing and if somebody were to step in and say rob those let's plays

945
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:50,680
that you've done of the classic games from 25 years ago comp the commodore company or whoever

946
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:56,040
wants a cut I'd be like all right they're gonna get five cents I sure know Nintendo's in a good

947
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:02,040
spot right now because their games are quality and they make some really awesome games but they're

948
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,720
not the only ones that make really awesome games out there and I gotta be honest this whole indie

949
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:10,840
resurgence thing there's a lot of great good indie games and you know what those indie guys don't

950
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:15,880
give a fuck about you monetizing their videos and so what's gonna come down to eventually is that

951
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:20,440
those people are just gonna be like oh hey you're gonna put barriers in front of me to play

952
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:25,320
these games well I'm just gonna play these games right here instead is what's gonna come down to

953
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:31,320
and they'll it'll be great for the indie guys to to be fair though just you know not all indie

954
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:36,040
guys I seem to recall Phil Fish which I realize is a controversial figure but he's made his

955
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:43,720
opinion very clear that he is in the minority thankfully and well he's got his own set of

956
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:50,200
issues but that's neither here nor there so but for the majority I think that people are pretty

957
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:56,040
open to the idea of you playing stuff and remember there's a whole you know let's play list of like

958
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:00,520
all the publishers and stuff that are okay with you doing that so I think that's a I think I think

959
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:05,560
it's a bummer there's not a standard I kind of I feel like there should just be a freaking standard

960
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:10,200
already but I as somebody who has done let's plays and puts things on YouTube and decides am

961
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:14,760
I going to monetize this or not I love that as a resource I do love that as a resource and when

962
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:20,520
I do a Nintendo game I just don't monetize it but I'm also like I'm not in a position I have

963
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:25,960
yet to see a check from YouTube and I've got a long way to go like I just don't have that type

964
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:31,160
of volume so it's not really something I think about but I kind of I like to think that if I

965
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:35,000
were in a position where I'm making a thousand dollars a month even off YouTube videos then I'd

966
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:40,360
be like all right well if you know the companies want their 25 30 percent per video even 50 percent

967
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:44,760
really per video then I guess they could be entitled to that but I don't think they should

968
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:50,920
be entitled to a hundred percent because I do think the creator of the let's play does share

969
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:56,680
in that with the people that made the game so the answer is somewhere in the 50 50 range somewhere

970
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:01,880
in there anyway um that's our thoughts on this we could go on for three hours and fill on this topic

971
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:06,520
alone I'm sure you guys have some strong opinions about this we welcome emails participate at orange

972
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:10,600
law on trading.com is the place to send emails we'll probably be continuing the discussion on

973
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:15,880
this on our forums a little bit this week as well which you can access at forums.vognetwork.com but

974
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:19,640
for now lots of other stuff going on in the news so we're going to get to some other news which

975
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:25,000
includes speaking of Nintendo there were some updates to Super Smash Brothers this week and

976
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,960
this is pretty cool because this is a pretty big update for a company that hasn't done a lot of

977
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:34,440
content patches for their games really we've they've been behind a little bit in that so this

978
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:40,760
is really cool to hear that Super Smash Brothers got 15 new eight player stages in a free update

979
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:46,440
so 15 modified eight player stages were added to Super Smash Brothers Wii U this week and you just

980
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:51,320
get it in a patch that you download and you're going to get new stages like Pokemon Stadium 2,

981
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:59,080
Wii Fit Studio, Luigi's Mansion, all these new levels for eight people to brawl in so that's

982
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:03,720
pretty cool I guess eight player mode must be doing very well for them to add all these stages

983
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:08,760
I bet it uh I bet this thing is a riot at conventions and anime conventions and gaming

984
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:13,080
conventions or my house or your house see I haven't I haven't had enough people over here

985
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:17,560
to play eight player Smash I mean we'll do computer characters but I bet if you actually have

986
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:23,480
eight people there playing I bet it's a riot it's chaos is it really it's great oh man you have to

987
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,840
have a huge tv to be able to see that though well this is in my living room yeah you guys have a

988
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:31,160
pretty decent sized tv I think we have the one here is too small 50 something inch yeah see that

989
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:35,960
that probably Dan wants us to get a 72 inch that would be perfect for Smash you need to be like

990
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:41,000
those uh people I was seeing online that was projecting the the football thingamabob today

991
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:46,200
on like a huge screen in their backyard that's what you need for Smash Brothers dear lord

992
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:53,320
you know what the whole neighborhood to be able to see I want Meta Knight to be the size of my head

993
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,400
all right well anyhow um some other interesting little kind of you know this could have been a

994
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:05,080
thing in Super Smash Brothers uh I guess through some discovery I don't know what this was like

995
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:09,480
if they had actually gone through files what was it disc files they were poking through files on

996
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,960
the disc well apparently uh Rhythm Heaven was going to have a character in the game

997
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:19,480
which actually makes a lot of sense now that we think about it uh also a stage based on Dr Mario

998
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:25,720
was going to be included which again makes a lot of sense now I would think that DLC would be a

999
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:30,200
great way to especially there's a new Rhythm Heaven game coming out for Wii U at some point

1000
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:36,040
wouldn't that be a great tie-in to then have the character in Smash Brothers as DLC of course you

1001
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:42,840
know I know Sakurai has said there's no plans for DLC but come on you want to talk about ways

1002
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:48,040
Nintendo can make more money here's one of them there's no plans for DLC well there I know he

1003
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:53,080
has said there's they already have a DLC character beyond Mewtwo beyond Mewtwo so that's like the one

1004
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:59,880
but I just I can't see how it could just be one I don't get it so anyhow it could have been it

1005
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:08,200
could have been a thing uh Darsaka well you know what's this the saying hackers gonna hack indeed

1006
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:15,560
well they have found an exploit in the new 3DS that lets you run Game Boy Color ROMs

1007
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:22,280
yep it was only a matter of time basically um it's something that you can do to side load Game Boy

1008
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:33,720
Color ROMs it's a trick put out by a YouTube user named Kazowar who basically used emulation

1009
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:41,160
meant for virtual console games to load the ROMs instead so his guide says that it relies on a

1010
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:47,480
buffer overflow error that's currently in the web browser so if you load it with specific timing

1011
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:54,840
you can get the uh you can replace a Game Boy Color game with a ROM on an SD card or something

1012
00:58:54,840 --> 00:59:02,200
stored online so of course uh it's actually it works with the last release 9.4 but um we're

1013
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:07,640
probably gonna see it patched out before too long so yeah I'm sure Nintendo will be patching that

1014
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:13,240
right up but like laugh it up kids in the meantime uh Pokemon Yellow for all hooray

1015
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:20,680
hmm yeah or uh some of the classics yeah yeah well you know I think Pokemon's like the one game

1016
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:24,520
people really want to see on virtual console that just isn't coming to virtual console

1017
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:28,120
why put it on virtual console when you can remake it and I don't know I don't actually don't know

1018
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:32,040
why those games don't really show up on virtual console I think you just nailed it uh Pokemon

1019
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:36,760
Pinball did on Wii U because I picked that one up but uh yeah the Pokemon games themselves don't

1020
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:39,720
really end up on virtual console you need something that's gonna use what the little

1021
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:45,320
accelerometer thing in the yeah so uh well I think you know you said it hackers gonna hack

1022
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:50,440
and uh if there's a way for people to play free games you know on their device that's what they're

1023
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:55,400
gonna do you know just throwing it out there though not that I'm excusing it because you know

1024
00:59:55,400 --> 01:00:01,720
the piracy you know that's not supposed to supposed to happen that's very bad but you know

1025
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:07,320
Nintendo could combat that a little bit if virtual console were a little more lucrative than just

1026
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:12,360
straight up emulation you know what I mean like being able to play it online with my friends

1027
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:17,880
which granted could still be considered emulation but hear me out here if there was a little more

1028
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:23,960
to to to enrich the pot of virtual console it would make those options look a lot more attractive

1029
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:29,640
and piracy look like the gutter option yeah it would look like oh this is this is the low class

1030
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:33,960
option whereas if I pay the premium I'm going to get all these other cool features like

1031
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:41,080
maybe multiple save states or uh maybe high definition textures or you know remastered

1032
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:46,920
sound or I don't know there's a lot of things that they could do 3D effects which very very few um

1033
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:52,200
uh the 3DS virtual console things have and they're usually considered separate releases and not a part

1034
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:56,440
of the virtual console family but I've been saying that forever that virtual console could really

1035
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:00,680
stand to sweeten the pot oh achievements would be another I know Nintendo doesn't have a centralized

1036
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:06,520
achievement system but they could easily create one they could get on that I'm sure they will with

1037
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:12,440
the next two or three consoles from now that they create just put it in the freaking Mario universe

1038
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:19,080
call it coins you unlocked a coin and you know have the coins be have the coins be usable to like

1039
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:24,280
buy backgrounds on the Wii U or 3DS or something even though I guess people are willing to pay real

1040
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:30,120
money for the background so they don't need fake coins I just I don't know anyway there's an award

1041
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:36,440
yeah award a certificate I don't know anything this is my just my silly thought how to make

1042
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:41,320
virtual console a lot more lucrative and convince people to buy games all over again but maybe you're

1043
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:45,480
right they're saving that for the Wii U 2 or whatever the next console is because that's how

1044
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:51,160
they'll get you to pay five dollars for Super Mario Brothers again because this time it has

1045
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:56,680
achievements or multiplayer or something or they just want anything they'll just put they'll still

1046
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:01,560
charge you five dollars for Super Mario see who buys it again yeah maybe or you know you just

1047
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:08,600
buy an original Nintendo and 50 50 cent Mario Brothers dot-com cart you're right you could

1048
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:12,920
you could except the old Nintendos are getting harder and harder to play on the newer TVs

1049
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:17,000
because you don't really have the um okay or you can buy one of those retron systems then

1050
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:22,040
okay there you go there you go all right anyhow moving on with more news Loki all right so if you

1051
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:32,440
want to take part of the Sony online breach class action lawsuit rewards then now's your time

01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:42,920
to go ahead and sign up for that so if you head on over to PSNSOESettlement.com you can actually

1053
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:51,240
sign up and register to receive such rewards as three months free of PlayStation Plus or some

1054
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:56,760
games that they already offered up to people that are affected by the breach the first time

1055
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:03,640
or some shitty dynamic themes for your PlayStation 3 which really why would you pick that that's

1056
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:08,680
literally the worst option that you can pick on all of those to qualify you must have had a

1057
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:14,520
PlayStation Network curiosity or Sony entered online entertainment account on or before May

1058
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:23,320
14th 2011 and uh you can receive I guess one or two one or two games um the three months

1059
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:28,920
or those stupid themes I don't know why you'd pick those things I'm not even considering that

1060
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:34,440
an option but uh yeah I went ahead and did that even though I got my free games yeah I was to say

1061
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:39,880
I guess I could do this because hey free game but I do kind of feel like well you know Sony

1062
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:44,040
kind of already gave free games whatever they're offering up free PlayStation Plus so I'm gonna

1063
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:49,480
take it yeah and you know have you never had PlayStation Plus ever let me tell my PlayStation

1064
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:53,560
Plus now but it's gonna extend it three more months oh well shit and that's maybe what I'm

1065
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:57,640
gonna grab out of that yeah exactly so I mean yeah I thought originally that was only supposed

1066
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:02,840
to be for people who never had PlayStation Plus before no get that oh it's for anybody but there's

1067
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:06,440
a lot of people ask and you know getting that minute drops it down the one month but that's

1068
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:10,360
still an extra month that's still an extra month so you know I'll do that because all the games

1069
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:16,360
that they were offering up or literally the same games that they had um before as part well no it

1070
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:22,200
wasn't exactly the same they had like uh puppeteers on there now so they had some decent games but

1071
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:28,600
it's just a lot of them already had um I just didn't want them so and the themes like I said

1072
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:33,080
themes are not even really an option for me at all yeah why would I do that uh running a little

1073
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:36,920
behind on our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com but I wanted to read a comment there's there's

1074
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:40,760
still a lot of people talking about the copyright dispute and I totally understand that but trying

1075
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:45,080
to pick out some of the comments of the stories we just read uh Dartetsuya says to be fair I'm

1076
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:49,400
sure they'll still offer a discount for owners of the previous versions of the ROM he's talking

1077
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:53,560
about the virtual console thing about how Wii U 2 or you know whatever it's gonna be obviously well

1078
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:57,560
that's assuming that their their online services can talk to each other because they still haven't

1079
01:04:57,560 --> 01:05:02,920
quite figured that out too well to be fair you can get if you bought it on the Wii and then you

1080
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:06,920
have the Wii U you can get the game for like a dollar and it is it is a better experience on

1081
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:11,640
Wii U than it was the Wii but you know it's it's worth about that dollar you know what I mean so

1082
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:19,560
I hate to be fair that is stupid I'm sorry when and we're we're living in a day and age where

1083
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:25,320
you know Call of Duty Advanced Warfare you can buy it on PlayStation 4 and get it on PlayStation

1084
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:32,840
3 for you know 3 for free or vice versa but yet Nintendo can't fucking offer me a free copy of

1085
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:41,000
goddamn ROM that they've made tons and tons of money off of already I mean that see this is

1086
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,240
exactly the type of company that we're dealing with here that feels that they are owed money

1087
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:49,240
for every fucking step of the way so you actually reminded me of a game I totally played for a

1088
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:52,200
little bit this week that I forgot to talk about during my gaming week so I guess I'll bring it up

1089
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:56,520
now because talking about ROMs and things I played Metroid Prime Trilogy because that came out on Wii

1090
01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:00,600
U it was only 10 bucks right I played a little bit of it I mean I didn't play enough of it obviously

1091
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:04,680
I didn't even think about it during my gaming week but I played a little bit of that and I gotta say

1092
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:09,320
that was kind of nice to be able to buy that for ten dollars on Wii U because there was no fucking

1093
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:13,720
way I was gonna pay like fifty dollars for it at GameStop or whatever it was or they were way

1094
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:18,200
overcharging for it because there was a lot of copies of it that's awesome yeah that they're

1095
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:22,360
you know that they charge the extra money for you wonder why they set that precedence because

1096
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:26,360
Nintendo makes fucking exclusive deals with them all the goddamn time once again and you know I

1097
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:30,680
don't like that and I don't like that so I was very happy when Nintendo was like we're gonna

1098
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:34,840
offer it for ten dollars digitally I was like all right cool now I can finally pick this up because

1099
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:40,120
I had Prime 3 and I think I had Prime 1 on the GameCube but I don't even really have a way to

1100
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:46,040
play GameCube games anymore my Wii's not even hooked up so I never bought Prime 2 so I was like

1101
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:49,720
all right I'll spend ten dollars on the collection the only thing that kind of bummed me out and I

1102
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:57,000
forgot that they changed this in Prime trilogy is that you only have Wii motion controls in Prime 1

1103
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,520
and 2 well Prime Metroid Prime was for the GameCube and used a GameCube controller so I

1104
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:06,840
thought oh I'll be able to use my classic controller that nope I got to use the Wiimote

1105
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:11,960
and the nunchuck that's not a problem with the Wii I mean that was the way they did it on trilogy

1106
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:17,880
for the Wii I just forgot about that yeah oh but god damn we spend any ounce of effort to like I

1107
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:23,560
don't know make it better you know fuck us you know for you know expecting them to do something

1108
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:28,840
I would have appreciated the ability to use classic no no effort and all the fucking reward

1109
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:36,120
that is why they're fucking charging for fucking advertisement yeah all right anyhow moving on

1110
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:44,920
you know who is paying who valve yes valve is paying valve has actually paid out a lot of money

1111
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:52,360
they've paid over 57 million dollars out to content creators folks who have created items

1112
01:07:52,360 --> 01:08:01,400
for team fortress 2 dota 2 counter strike global offense and this is also spread out amongst 75

1113
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:07,240
different countries so basically all of these people who have been throwing stuff you know out

1114
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:13,640
there for valves products have been reaping the benefit I mean they are clearly appreciative

1115
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:21,400
in fact they've even uh you know said uh one of their developers uh uh Alden Kroll said uh today

1116
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:25,640
we're happy to announce that after a ton of work the first curated workshops for non-valve games

1117
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:31,400
have opened so they've expanded it dungeon defenders eternity and chivalry medieval war

1118
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:39,560
so there's more and more coming out so they're like hey thanks you're keeping our stuff alive

1119
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:44,280
here's some money I wasn't even thinking of valve when we were talking about all these other

1120
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:49,720
stories you know um probably it has to do with consoles versus pc and for obvious reasons I

1121
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:55,400
associate valve a little more with pc ends of things and mac computers in general right so

1122
01:08:55,400 --> 01:09:00,040
I kind of associate valve with that but it is interesting that valve is not only a game maker

1123
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:05,240
but they have this service and now they have this whole game streaming thing within it where you can

1124
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:09,640
stream the games to your friends and so forth I mean they've essentially built that for their own

1125
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:14,040
games now granted there's no revenue sharing in that there's none of that comes into play but just

1126
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:18,680
kind of kind of interesting to see how things are are from that angle and then what you just

1127
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:22,840
mentioned right there with all these community market things that are selling for uh quite a bit

1128
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:30,040
of money there and I bet valve gets quite a nice cut of that as well well uh speaking of steam now

1129
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:34,520
you can't make any community market items for this game I don't think anyway yet I don't even know if

1130
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:40,040
there's trading cards but you can get the definitive version of Quantic Dream's indigo

1131
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:48,280
prophecy it is now available on steam as well as ios pc mac linux all those different platforms

1132
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:55,400
it is available for nine dollars and 99 cents uh you can pick that up uh if you don't know uh

1133
01:09:55,400 --> 01:10:01,160
the game indigo prophecy uh it is by the folks who made heavy rain if I'm not mistaken Quantic

1134
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:07,800
Dream right so you can check out this early uh early game of theirs um this version now the

1135
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:14,200
original game was capped at a resolution of 1024 by 768 but this new version will allow resolutions

1136
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:22,680
up to 2880 by 1800 and they say they gave every game texture in the game a facelift so some have

1137
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:28,680
four times the detail that they used to have but for ios there is a two gigabyte size limit

1138
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:32,760
so some of the textures are only double what they used to be so I mean but if you're going to be

1139
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:37,160
playing the game on something a little more portable than something on your desktop I would

1140
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:41,720
think that uh that would be a given there that it's not going to be quite quite the same so

1141
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:48,760
uh that's pretty cool uh and in the faqs they say no cut or censored content in this version

1142
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:54,920
so if you're worried if anything got cut along the way don't worry you don't have to do you ever

1143
01:10:54,920 --> 01:11:00,920
play indigo prophecy you guys anybody in this room no it may be my steam library I honestly

1144
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:04,520
don't know do you think you picked it up and you just haven't I may have picked it up at one time

1145
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:12,680
I wouldn't know though all right so there you go uh awesome well let's travel around the world and

1146
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:18,840
check out some release dates we're gonna go uh see what's coming out to a store near you yeah

1151
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:59,720
all right well I usually would do the japanese release dates right now but the website I use

1152
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:04,120
for those is down so I'm going to try to find an alternate resource here real quick uh dark soccer

1153
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:09,800
would you mind uh doing things out of order here live radio it's a blast there's only one it's on

1154
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:16,440
the february 4th grow home will be out on pc which um I don't even know what that's about

1155
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:24,040
I'm gonna look at it maybe you like have a one of those uh hydroponic gardens that uh

1156
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:30,920
oh it's by ubisoft it's an experimental pc platformer called grow home with a little

1157
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:42,200
robot and it looks like he's stuck hanging out in um nights into dreams yeah all right well uh

1158
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:45,800
I guess I'm not gonna be able to do japanese releases this week so sorry japan nothing is

1159
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:50,920
coming out in your region absolutely nothing I'm just kidding uh let's move on though uh we've

1160
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:56,120
got a few more news stories for you guys than the classic game of the week first up loki all right

1161
01:12:56,120 --> 01:13:02,440
so sony has pulled the support for a few of their non-game apps on the vita which is kind of sad

1162
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:10,600
um I remember also they've dropped was it um near but I guess the maps app and the youtube app will

1163
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:17,800
be removed as well um I guess the maps app you know which I think used some of the features of

1164
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:26,280
near um is not or it's expected to be removed as part of um I guess a march update and then the

1165
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:33,320
youtube app will be gone by april 20th so they're seeing though that you could still access youtube

1166
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:39,640
through the web browser but it is kind of lame that they're removing that and honestly I don't

1167
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:44,360
know why they would be doing that unless maybe they were doing an update to the whole I I'm some

1168
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:49,400
part of me is like hoping that maybe they're doing just an update to the whole operating system on

1169
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:55,000
the vita maybe that's going to be taking effect sometime soon and they're just removing this stuff

1170
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:00,120
because it's going to be replaced by something better because I can't imagine that you know

1171
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:06,680
having google maps on there is such a drain or of resources or something I don't really understand

1172
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:14,920
why they would remove that but kind of disappointing um well the near I never understood

1173
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:23,000
anyway so I I I haven't used that since the vita first came out near I think was more of like kind

1174
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,960
of street passing but without going anywhere but it didn't make sense they never explained it very

1175
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:33,400
well in the interface it was kind of silly um which I understand near isn't necessarily getting

1176
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:38,200
shut down or whatever but without the maps functionality in the vita that may I think it's

1177
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:42,840
probably a licensed thing wasn't uh wasn't vita licensing that from google wasn't sony licensing

1178
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:47,640
the maps thing from google the license probably ran out and they decided so few people use it they

1179
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:52,760
didn't want to renew it that's my thought anyway oh it's probably what it is uh and then uh the

1180
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:57,480
youtube app probably because it works on the website and the vita you know level of people

1181
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:01,000
who use youtube on the vita is so small they probably just don't want to use the resources

1182
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:05,320
updating the vita app anymore so they have no no more support for it because youtube does add new

1183
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:11,400
stuff like uh god what is it I saw now on the web is that it will auto play the next thing on the

1184
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:16,040
playlist which I hate that shit when I go to youtube I want to watch one video if I want to

1185
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:20,520
watch a playlist I'll let you know I'll make my own playlist but uh yeah I mean so the youtube

1186
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:23,960
technologies are changing all the time so they probably just didn't want to build that into

1187
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:30,280
uh the apps I'm actually glad they're going html5 oh did they yeah I thought they I thought they

1188
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:35,080
were already on that for a while well I mean one thing I don't know if you've noticed um flash has

1189
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:40,120
had like a bajillion updates lately it's so annoying and then now it's it freaking locks me

1190
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:44,600
like it shuts flash down on every website unless I'm willing to update which is a real pain in the

1191
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:48,840
butt while I'm trying to do these shows no well the other thing too is that I think that that

1192
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:53,960
might be part of the reason why they've gone to html5 yeah but that of course you know watching

1193
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:59,960
youtube on ios devices without having uh their app would you know that would help right but I

1194
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:05,000
mean the app's all right yeah but I just think it's needed the technology is finally you know

1195
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,880
yeah make it becoming more accessible to other people I like to use the app to load something

1196
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:13,240
up and then I push the button that plays it on my playstation 4 that's what I like just

1197
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:16,360
just trying to find something with the controller is a pain in the ass we've got a chromecast for

1198
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:22,680
that oh yeah I don't have a chromecast for that so 30 bucks all right I'm cheap I have a playstation

1199
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:29,000
4 that plays almost everything so I don't usually need one all right uh one more story for you guys

1200
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:34,120
and this is about uh this is about a series that I love I love this and I'm not sure how I feel

1201
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:40,360
about this news um one of my very very very favorite puzzle games ever is luminous and

1202
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:45,720
luminous of course was a game that came out from q entertainment uh they also did another great

1203
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:52,360
puzzle game very underrated game on the ds not the 3ds but the ds it was called medios and I love

1204
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:56,760
this game and they did like a disney version of it that was eh and then they did a version on the

1205
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:01,720
xbox 360 that was really weird to control with a controller but it was it was adequate for what it

1206
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:09,880
was but anyway luminous and medios are two big awesome puzzle games uh that are apparently now

1207
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:17,800
part of mobcast mobcast acquired luminous and medios from q entertainment so what are they

1208
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:25,240
doing they're making a new luminous game for ios and android this will be a collaboration with

1209
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:31,480
tetsuya mizuguchi so that's very interesting so that's where i feel mixed is because i love a lot

1210
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:37,720
of q entertainment stuff but granted that's probably because of tetsuya mizuguchi so to hear

1211
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:43,400
that he's still involved makes me a little more hopeful um i guess it's cool that it's coming to

1212
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:51,400
cell phones uh i remember there was a luminous on ios and it was awful because the controls were

1213
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:57,800
awful so if they're gonna fix that then i guess uh it'll be better i'm also very interested to

1214
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:02,920
see what this is going to mean for medios because now medios with touch controls i could kind of see

1215
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:09,400
that that actually might be really cool um so i'm curious to see how this all plays out so anyway

1216
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:15,960
um mizuguchi is going to be working on luminous from his new studio enhance games but of course

1217
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:22,760
mizuguchi left q entertainment uh after founding co-founding it in 2003 he left it in march so i

1218
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:27,000
mean you know again i think a big part of the reason why i like q entertainment so much is

1219
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:33,080
because of him so if he was gone anyway then at least he's still involved with these these babies

1220
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:39,880
uh luminous and medios so um good luck mob cast and don't fuck it up because i really love these

1221
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:46,680
games and i really need them to be good on the uh mobile devices if that i mean i kind of wish

1222
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:51,880
it was console but i understand the vita one may not have done as well as y'all wanted it to and

1223
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:55,240
maybe that's why q entertainment was looking to get rid of it or maybe they realized there wasn't

1224
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:59,640
much they could do with it without tetsuya mizuguchi so i don't know i'm trying to keep an

1225
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:05,080
open mind please please please don't screw it up mob cast please all right well let's go back to

1226
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:10,520
let's go back to a more classic time in gaming's history because playing games on your portable

1227
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:15,960
phones what is that about that's not something we used to do back in the day snake no you didn't

1228
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:20,920
even have snake there was no more your phones were still attached to the wall remember my

1229
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:25,960
that's mario nokia phone yeah that was great you see that over there by the coffee machine

1230
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:29,480
you see that on the wall that's a phone jack you ever seen one of those before

1231
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:37,320
yes and notice how it's rob i'm older than you i know you are that where i get my internet from

1232
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:41,720
no no back in the day a little different all right yeah back in the day you'd have to call

1233
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:45,640
you have to call aol have a second one put in so people could use the phone instead of knocking

1234
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:50,120
you offline that's why aol was made although i'm not really sure we should introduce our listeners

1235
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:56,920
to what the modem really sounds like all right listen to dubstep you'll get an idea all right

1236
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:03,480
here it is your classic game of the week from way back when today's game is hino tori ho

1237
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:11,160
hen uh gaonoboken which translates to phoenix chronicles gal's adventure and it was uh the

1238
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:15,720
version in particular that we're covering today is the famicom version that was done by konami

1239
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:22,440
not the msx one it had a similarly named one on msx um but the games were based off the manga

1240
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:31,880
called a hino tori or phoenix uh done by um osamu teska who did uh tetsu on adam uh as in uh

1241
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:37,560
what did we call him over here again astro boy yeah i had to think about that for a moment

1242
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:43,320
because uh he also did um kimba the white lion and blackjack so those are a few others that

1243
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:48,600
people over here might be more familiar with um so basically it's the story of a guy uh named

1244
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:55,720
gaol who as a kid lost an arm and an eye and he was teased poor guy and he grew up bitter

1245
01:20:56,440 --> 01:21:05,160
very bitter and so uh as the story goes he's going um he uh basically got married had a you

1246
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:13,400
know had a family and then went crazy and killed his wife so he's dark story yeah so basically he

1247
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:21,080
went to try to reform his wife he became a buddhist became a sculptor and now uh he

1248
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:30,840
is on a uh quest to recover pieces of a phoenix statue that's uh basically he's trying to get

1249
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:35,800
eternal life by drinking the blood of the phoenix so basically it's a platform game

1250
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:41,400
um you have to take gaol through uh 16 different levels to get 16 sculpture fragments and put the

1251
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:47,640
phoenix back together um you have boss enemies at the end of each stage um in some levels instead

1252
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:54,040
of the boss enemy you actually have to avoid traps um or you know walls or different things to you

1253
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:59,720
know that try to impede your process it also has a life system so you have three lives and each have

1254
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:04,040
a number of hit points so if you you know get hit by something you lose a hit point and when you get

1255
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:08,920
zero you lose one of the three lives you also uh can lose lives by falling into a pit or failing

1256
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:15,560
to complete the level before the timer runs out um and then um you also have a little thing that

1257
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:20,200
you can do where if you are in a situation where you're trapped and can't progress you can press

1258
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:25,880
the select button and he self-destructs you start the level over um and if he of course loses all

1259
01:22:25,880 --> 01:22:30,760
three of his lives he uh you get game over and you get the chance to continue from the beginning

1260
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:37,080
of the stage so it's really a simple game i mean it's super fun uh i have i've played this one

1261
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:43,400
before um i like the msx one because sort of like shock troopers except and well kind of like that

1262
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:48,520
actually it's like a shooter like a playing game except you're running on the ground um but i like

1263
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:53,640
the adventure games a little bit better especially since you know it's got such a compelling story

1264
01:22:53,640 --> 01:23:00,200
and i don't know if anyone's ever read any of the uh phoenix manga but it's such a good story i mean

1265
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:05,880
it really is there's uh ferronome fans out there there's oavs i think the last one came out in 80

1266
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:11,400
something i want to say but just gorgeous animation and it's nice you know that the

1267
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:17,720
video games made it into parts of the story as well so um and it's so you're basically looking

1268
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:26,600
at a little bit of uh one of the best known uh manga anime series that have been out but added

1269
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:32,920
into the video game lore as well so there you go can you say the name of this game one more time

1270
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:42,520
oh good lord in notary he notary hole and uh gal no bulking so um but now for anyone

1271
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:46,840
who is a fan of diverse systems okay look here you listen

1272
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:59,320
no i am not listening okay um there was a cd done by uh tomoyan that was 8-bit versus diverse systems

1273
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:04,840
and one of the songs from the series made it in so uh if you listen to the end of the show you

1274
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:11,480
might get to hear it uh live live live not podcast if not then you have to go out and

1275
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:19,960
purchase a legitimate copy of or just find it on youtube all right uh there it is uh your classic

1276
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:24,360
giveaway and i'm looking at chat there's a few people in chat talking about how um old anime

1277
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:28,440
was dark i'm sorry i haven't watched i haven't watched a lot of the old ever watched dog of

1278
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:34,920
flanders old prepare to cry old cartoons to me are like the muppet babies okay and the stuff

1279
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:39,880
i grew up on which you know the muppet babies wasn't really a dark show although it would have

1280
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:51,800
been funny if it was uh i just i was just thinking about i was reading the chat actually because pow

1281
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:57,000
was like phoenix mongola was so good without being preachy yeah because i mean i've i've

1282
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:03,880
always been a fan of um tesica his work has been just top notch and really uh approached topics

1283
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:11,800
that were not really i think touched it at the time that he did it so it's very very brilliant

1284
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:18,040
mind all right well there it is your classic game of the week pow dog of flanders where happiness

1285
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:24,040
goes to die all right well that was a good pick that was one i have to admit i didn't really know

1286
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:28,600
a lot about that game but knowing that it didn't i'm all about education that's good you got to

1287
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:33,720
educate the masses heck yeah and i'm surprised you didn't you know most people you would expect

1288
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:41,400
would have done something this week like techmo bowl or super high impact fuck the superb i was

1289
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:45,720
trying to think of games that had owls as the head character i'll see that would have been there but

1290
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:49,400
i would that would have just had me doing ocarina of time and how we wanted to shoot that owl in

1291
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:56,520
his face i kept throwing so many deck uh games and star owls i keep thinking of harry potter

1292
01:25:56,520 --> 01:26:01,480
i don't know why head fig games the star what if there had been a head big in the angry inch video

1293
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:10,200
game where you play as head big as the head big rpg you have to go never mind i don't know you're

1294
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:15,160

1296
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:33,560
and on the fourth day dark sakura said let there be head big awesome and there was snipping all

1297
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:38,680
right uh look we're gonna take a break guys we got plenty more show to come when we come back

1298
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:42,680
with more of orange launch radio right after this we have uh rapid fire news frugal question

1299
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:47,640
of the week and that news segment coming up when we come back with more of orange launch radio right

1300
01:26:47,640 --> 01:27:01,720
after this welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live on this sunday night february the 1st

1301
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:07,960
with the 585th episode of our show already in progress all right so i've been teasing

1302
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:11,800
out earlier in the show that we're going to try out a new segment in the show and we're

1303
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:16,600
going to put it right here and this is a response to you know last week you guys were talking about

1304
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:22,200
or we all were really talking about the uh forums over at vog network.com and how um you know not a

1305
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:27,240
lot of people are really using the forums and some of you guys in chat were like well you know we

1306
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:31,080
we'd probably use the forums a little more if there were you know some discussions that you

1307
01:27:31,080 --> 01:27:35,240
know were were motivating us to go over there and post so i thought you know what all right all

1308
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:39,720
right you know we get into a lot of debates here on the show we get into a lot of topics that we

1309
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:45,560
talk about that maybe we're not always necessarily done even though we have a generous three hours

1310
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:50,440
which is longer than most podcasts go for uh sometimes even three hours isn't enough to talk

1311
01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:54,600
about all the things that go on in gaming during the week so we might go over to the forums and

1312
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:59,320
continue a conversation so you'll probably see me posting on the forums a lot uh either on the

1313
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:04,760
orange lounge radio forum or in our general video gaming vog network forum you might see loki or

1314
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:09,800
dark sakura pop over there as well as they have some things to say and then you guys have some

1315
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:16,920
things to say and we're gonna kind of wrap that all into a segment we call forum follow-up so

1316
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:20,840
let's get started with tonight's forum follow-up to some of the topics from last week's show

1317
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:28,680
all right so for tonight's forum i thought something a little funky for this segment

1318
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:31,960
would be a little bit a little bit different for you guys all right uh let's get to tonight's

1319
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:37,080
forum follow-up so there's uh two topics i want to follow up on tonight and one is last week we

1320
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:43,080
were talking about uh what makes a game worthy of your subscription fees and i made a post over

1321
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:47,880
on the forums kind of expanding on my thoughts a little more about uh elder scrolls online and the

1322
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:52,200
fact that elder scrolls online was going to be losing the subscription fee element of it and i

1323
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:56,280
kind of asked the question like what why is it that some people will still pay for wow they'll

1324
01:28:56,280 --> 01:29:01,480
pay for final fantasy 14 what makes the game more worthy of those subscription fees and you can read

1325
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:06,920
what i had to say on it over on the forums or you can listen to what flaco jones said in response

1326
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:13,480
and flaco jones on this topic said i hate sub fees hate hate hate but i re-subbed to wow because

1327
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:19,320
i love the game and i just had to see the new content i only pay 30 days at a time though never

1328
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:24,280
recurring so i have the option to start and stop when i want it's worth it because i'm having a

1329
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:30,680
blast but i think a sub model is so outdated and a rip-off when 60 games like skyrim dragon age and

1330
01:29:30,680 --> 01:29:35,480
diablo give you hundreds of hours of content let's not talk about how many hours i've sunk

1331
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:42,360
into diablo 3 okay you know it just popped it in my head huh i can quit any time yeah right yeah

1332
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:45,640
i'm sure that's what alan would say about diablo 3 right now because he's not playing right now or

1333
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:49,160
anything he's either playing that or dragon age inquisition it's got to be one of those he's

1334
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:53,080
playing laundry he's playing with sanrio to be fair he's playing i did go back and pet sanrio

1335
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:58,120
by the way good good uh continuing on with flaco jones's thought here uh hundreds of hours of

1336
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:04,120
content for one price and maybe add on some dlc to pay for later if wow just charge subs to do

1337
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:09,880
stupid endgame crap like rating or whatever i'd be the happiest gamer ever because i just like to

1338
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:16,280
level and question stuff and i think paying for the expansion should cover the cost at least um

1339
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:21,080
so that was on that topic and then another topic to follow up on was amiibos at the top of the show

1340
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:25,720
last week i was talking a little bit about amiibo and how i personally was feeling like i'm kind of

1341
01:30:25,720 --> 01:30:31,240
over it like i am over this amiibo fever i hate this artificial shortage that nintendo is creating

1342
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:36,440
they should just have an online store when this stuff is so popular like i i spelled out my

1343
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:43,880
thoughts on the forums a little more um verbosely and some of you guys responded to uh my thoughts

1344
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:49,560
and so i want to read some of those responses uh gamer fox replied and said the extremely limited

1345
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:55,240
availability of certain amiibo is a real turn off it's also frustrating to order the products online

1346
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:59,880
as orders have been canceled or postponed indefinitely but for me most of the hunt

1347
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:04,440
happens in person and i've been pretty lucky so far in scoring some from various retailers like

1348
01:31:04,440 --> 01:31:08,680
toys r us which is right by my house i'm not looking for a complete collection which sets

1349
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:13,160
me apart from others perhaps i'm okay with not getting all those really limited characters as

1350
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:18,440
long as they're not ones that i really want like uh like bowser or legend of zelda characters

1351
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:23,240
my latest pickup last night was literally a stroke of pure luck i can see how that kind of roll the

1352
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:28,920
dice can be frustrating for fans i entirely echo that sentiment i'm mostly collecting the amiibo

1353
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:32,920
because they're collectibles and i like the figures i'm also hoping for some increased

1354
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:39,800
functionality from nintendo down the line too and then uh pow also responded to this and said

1355
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:44,440
i like the amiibo but the low availability changed my initial plan to get them all

1356
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:49,080
i'm not going to start a collection when even mr awata is telling me that having the whole

1357
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:53,000
collection is going to be hard i got the ones that i consider to be classics and now i'm

1358
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:57,800
done with amiibo i wasn't surprised with the initial sold out panic moment but i am surprised

1359
01:31:57,800 --> 01:32:02,440
with nintendo's lack of interest for restocking them i'm not buying the whole shelf space is a

1360
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:07,160
challenge story since i was born in europe and many of my european buddies don't have as many

1361
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:12,280
issues to find them than my american friends sorry but the idea that shelf space is an issue in the

1362
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:17,880
usa but not in japan sounds like a bad joke even if that excuse is true you have an online store

1363
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:24,040
nintendo use it oh pow really summarizes my feelings on the matter uh personally very well

1364
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:28,440
i think it makes a great point there is it's like okay so you somehow have the shelf space in japan

1365
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:32,280
but you don't have it here i mean i guess i understand the collectibles may be a little more

1366
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:36,520
of a thing in japan but i just i have a hard time believing that shelf space is that big of a

1367
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:42,440
concern here especially with how crazy some of that stuff sells and um you know even today target

1368
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:48,840
released the rosalina figures and i know multiple people on twitter that were up at the crack of

1369
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:55,080
dawn to go line up a target and get their rosalina figures you know and like i'm not one to knock on

1370
01:32:55,080 --> 01:33:00,440
other people's hobbies and what's fun for you and if you got a reward out of that i'm happy for you

1371
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:06,440
and so forth but it's kind of one of those like i am like over it like if why can't i just log on to

1372
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:12,520
amazon and buy it like a new pair of socks like or any other nintendo game or something like that

1373
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:19,080
like i don't understand why it's such a it's like it's february 1st it's not the holidays where

1374
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:23,880
we're all lining up for that stuff it's just it's so weird to me so weird uh looking in the chat room

1375
01:33:23,880 --> 01:33:28,440
over at live.vog network.com fifth dream says ami bover it

1376
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:35,880
anyway uh i hate to i hate to leave that so negative on amiibo but that was uh that was

1377
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:39,400
some of the feedback but i have seen a lot of positive i think the people that feel real

1378
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:43,720
positive about amiibo are just too busy playing super smash brothers and leveling their amiibos

1379
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:48,760
to 50 uh to comment this week i guess i'm gonna assume that's the case so anyway there it is

1380
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:53,000
first edition of forum feedback we obviously we're never gonna be able to read every forum post

1381
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:57,160
and they'll usually have to be edited for length but we do you know it is a show where every gamer

1382
01:33:57,160 --> 01:34:01,560
has a voice and our forums is another place where you can share your voice over at vog network.com

1385
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:17,320
use the passphrase rice all right let's get into some rapid fire news tonight loki

1386
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:28,440
okay so i don't know you know basically dragon's dogma online sounds pretty awesome and it's this

1387
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:34,920
brand new free-to-play game that they're gonna be putting out on playstation 4 playstation 3 and pc

1388
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:40,360
now i never really got into the original dragon dogma game but this almost sounds like and

1389
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:45,880
i don't know if you've heard much about it rob it almost sounds like to me the co-op stuff that

1390
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:52,200
they have for dragon age inquisition because it's basically going and be going off um with parties

1391
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:59,720
i guess they're saying um parties of eight are um you know i guess up to four players for certain

1392
01:34:59,720 --> 01:35:05,320
parties and then they also have um you can spawn ai players as well so up to a party of eight four

1393
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:12,600
player real people and then um i guess that you just kind of go off on these like quests and stuff

1394
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:16,520
and do different missions or whatever but they're also going to have these hub worlds where there's

1395
01:35:16,520 --> 01:35:21,800
a bunch of people they can interact with so maybe a little bit dragon age inquisition and maybe a

1396
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:28,200
little bit like fancy star online i guess i don't know well those are some of my favorite games

1397
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:32,520
although i in all honesty i kind of find the dragon age inquisition multiplayer to be a little

1398
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:37,880
bit repetitive it's it's it feels way more grindy than mass effect did it doesn't it doesn't click

1399
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:41,800
the same for me but again i know other people are really enjoying it so i'm not to knock on

1400
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:45,800
other people's fun but this dragon's dogma sounds very interesting i don't know much about the online

1401
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:50,360
one but uh i'd check it out yeah they haven't really announced any sort of dates or anything

1402
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:56,040
and right now it's just scheduled for japan this year so i guess we'll have to wait a little bit

1403
01:35:56,040 --> 01:36:03,960
before we hear about it or hopefully it does come over here who knows um but yeah um sounds

1404
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:09,560
interesting uh they're saying though they also um there was a european trademark for the game as

1405
01:36:09,560 --> 01:36:15,160
well so hopefully that means that there will be um an international release for it as well at least

1406
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:23,160
in the uk um and then to go along um with a game that i've been playing lately which is the lego

1407
01:36:23,160 --> 01:36:32,280
marvel superheroes they have now um announced a few more lego titles for 2015 and with that

1408
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:41,800
includes um lego jurassic world and lego's marvel adventures or marvel's avengers yeah so um

1409
01:36:42,520 --> 01:36:48,440
i guess i'll have to pick up the avengers game and they haven't really said yet when those are

1410
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:54,920
supposed to be coming out oh um also if you're not into the licensed lego like movie properties

1411
01:36:54,920 --> 01:37:00,280
they also have the lego ninjago shadow of ronin that's supposed to be coming out later on i got

1412
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:08,360
made to watch some of that show the lego ninjago yes i'm trying to get my son to watch other lego

1413
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:15,560
stuff because uh you know they don't really have um it made more marvel games it made my soul hurt

1414
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:20,760
have they done lego jurassic park games before or is this the first lego jurassic park toys i think

1415
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:25,640
huh but not not the games not not games i think i mean i remember the jurassic park games back when

1416
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:30,120
like that first movie was out and like i the super nintendo one was scary as hell because that was

1417
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:33,960
right when first person and doom doom s type of games were really starting to take over so they

1418
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:39,400
kind of did that on super it was scary interesting see what they do um i don't know they had raptors

1419
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:44,040
in one of the levels in lego marvel superheroes the thing that doesn't click for me is that

1420
01:37:44,040 --> 01:37:47,240
jurassic park and that whole thing it's not i i didn't think it was supposed to be something that

1421
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:53,880
was cute like it's kind of scary i guess it's you know it's pg-13 scary it's you know poltergeist

1422
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:58,200
scary but it's still scary yeah i don't know how they're gonna exactly do that could could they do

1423
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:05,400
lego poltergeist if they can do lego can we have a little lego gypsy lady and if you don't own

1424
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:09,640
consoles though but you have um an ios device they also announced that they're gonna be bringing the

1425
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:15,640
lego movie and lego batman 3 beyond gotham to those devices as well huh interesting so um i

1426
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:19,880
don't know i'm interested in checking out the lego marvel avengers i'm a little worried that they may

1427
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:27,240
i don't know it may not be as robust as like the first game honestly that's what kind of kept me

1428
01:38:27,240 --> 01:38:33,240
away from lego batman 3 is that it wasn't open world like you know marvel superheroes was i'm

1429
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:38,280
more interested in lego batman 2 but i don't really want to pick that up for my playstation

1430
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:46,200
3 since i'm using a playstation 4 now um and then they have announced the titles for xbox's uh games

1431
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:54,600
of gold for february so in february you'll be able to get uh for xbox one idarb which is kind of a

1432
01:38:54,600 --> 01:39:02,360
strange sports game that has a ton of integration with uh twitch and twitch chat you can basically

1433
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:08,760
troll the people playing the game with um chat comments and uh you'll actually get to play that

1434
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:16,840
uh free and i think earlier um it's supposed to be coming out in february i'm not sure when

1435
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:21,320
it's exactly launching let's see here now they haven't said when it's launching standalone

1436
01:39:21,320 --> 01:39:26,360
outside i'm guessing outside of february but uh you'll be able to you know pick it up for free

1437
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:36,360
and then also on xbox 360 for the first half of the month they will be giving you um let's see

1438
01:39:37,240 --> 01:39:41,480
well so i guess it's idarb for the first half of the month i thought that was only on xbox one

1439
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:46,520
though i know that the other two titles uh brothers a tale of two sons will be coming out as well and

1440
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:52,280
then the second half of the month they're gonna have sniper elite v2 so lots of 505 stuff for

1441
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:57,960
this month i guess um so yeah let's see your free titles so go pick them up even if you don't want

1442
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:03,880
them because you might someday and it's free uh the folks in chat over at live.vog network.com

1443
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:09,240
talking a lot about the lego stuff uh tiger claw says uh lego jurassic world willing uh which will

1444
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:13,720
include all four movies so i didn't know that is that going to incorporate the whole lore hopefully

1445
01:40:13,960 --> 01:40:17,480
well i can't imagine that they'd be able to stretch out one movie's worth of stuff into

1446
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:22,600
that i don't know and then fifth dream says uh lego the rocky horror picture show and links me

1447
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:26,600
to a youtube i can't do youtubes or broadcasting live but i can only imagine what that must look

1448
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:33,000
like i somehow think that is not an official lego brand i don't think but if it was that's hilarious

1449
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:37,560
oh my god i can see them doing remember they were trying to push for the lego uh back to the future

1450
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:41,400
or something like that i could see i'll be cool well tiger claw says uh the lego games i'd love

1451
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:45,800
to see happen one day they need to do lego teenage mutant ninja turtles exactly i was just about to

1452
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:49,960
say that because they have the toys for that so why not i would be fun totally be down for that

1453
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:55,640
i know my son be down for that too all right uh let's do some more quick news here uh starting

1454
01:40:55,640 --> 01:41:03,480
off with this a wonder boy spiritual successor monster boy could happen for weu and this is going

1455
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:08,920
to be based off a kickstarter uh the kickstarter page for the game says that right now the game is

1456
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:14,520
only going to be coming to the playstation 4 and pc but there are some other formats and some folks

1457
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:21,720
hoping that weu xbox one would be some of those other formats so monster boy is an all-new adventure

1458
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:26,920
uh that is uh created with the creator of the original monster world uh it can be considered

1459
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:31,480
an official part of the series but since the trademark is owned by sega they had to change

1460
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:36,920
the name new hand-drawn graphics and an improved art style uh new transformations replacing the

1461
01:41:36,920 --> 01:41:40,680
bear and the hamster uh the game will still have an open world but some of the environments have

1462
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:44,600
changed that fit a little more with the monster world universe so if you're curious in checking

1463
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:48,920
that out again and you know i i'm sure a lot of folks would love to see that come to weu

1464
01:41:48,920 --> 01:41:52,200
but it's going to have to make a lot of money so i get over to that kickstarter you can come

1465
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:56,360
to at least playstation 4 uh that is on kickstarter if you want to check that out for

1466
01:41:56,360 --> 01:42:03,800
monster boy i'm sure if you look that up you will find it quickly um cave story 2 it's probably a

1467
01:42:03,800 --> 01:42:11,240
thing um especially if some of the things revealed on desktops at packs south are to be believed

1468
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:18,840
uh during pack south uh i guess uh a folder for cave story 2 was spotted on a laptop from the

1469
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:25,320
game publishers but you know i mean duh the cave story 2 is probably a thing this doesn't strike me

1470
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:29,880
as something that's particularly surprising but there you go it looks like something that is being

1471
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:34,360
worked on or i mean anything could be in that folder though it could just be concepts it could

1472
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:39,960
be things that were ultimately cancelled i kind of doubt it but it could be it could be it could

1473
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:45,720
be fanfic it could be fanfic it very well could be it could be uh could be things downloaded from

1474
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:52,280
deviantart who knows anyhow um speaking of deviantart and uh some of the art people are

1475
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:58,520
going to make with this world of warcraft in the latest patch 6.1 is going to be giving out a new

1476
01:42:58,600 --> 01:43:06,680
item called the s e l f i e camera that's right it's a selfie camera and that's what it does it

1477
01:43:06,680 --> 01:43:13,080
allows you to have your character take selfies did the gnomes make it um i'm assuming they had

1478
01:43:13,080 --> 01:43:20,520
to have i don't know who made gnomes gave us disco balls i know it's a trinket that you actually

1479
01:43:20,520 --> 01:43:27,160
equip on your character um and that's you know i don't see any of the lore behind this but i'm

1480
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:32,360
sure it's got to be a gnome thing sure it has to be anyway i'm glad that selfie cameras can

1481
01:43:32,360 --> 01:43:37,000
be part of world warcraft lore yeah right well i imagine it's going to be the type of thing that

1482
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:44,360
people uh do uh machinima use this in machinima it's like a new camera angle for some people

1483
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:47,960
but the other thing about the selfie camera is that not only do you take selfies of your

1484
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:52,920
character but this is actually kind of funny because you do a mission and you get an upgrade

1485
01:43:52,920 --> 01:44:01,720
kit that gives you the selfie camera mk2 and now you get filters for your selfies instagram in wow

1486
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:08,440
yeah it worked out well for them in grand theft auto 5 so i can't i can't i can't complain filter

1487
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:16,200
yeah it's a little it's a it's a little stretching it you know trying to incorporate into lore but

1488
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:21,640
whatever i guess it should be noted now it should be noted that also coming in the 6-1 patch for

1489
01:44:21,640 --> 01:44:26,280
world of warcraft is twitter integration and i think maybe facebook integration but i know

1490
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:30,840
just twitter integration where you can tweet you mean spam integration from you can tweet from

1491
01:44:30,840 --> 01:44:36,760
within world of warcraft so gosh this makes an awful lot of sense because now not only can people

1492
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:42,600
post selfies of their real selves through instagram they can post selfies of their fake selves

1493
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:47,880
right there in world of war you realize we're a patch away from slash pizza

1494
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:55,080
i'm surprised it's not already a thing that's why i don't remember slash slash panda express

1495
01:44:55,080 --> 01:45:02,920
i think was the thing yes so there it is uh the selfie camera coming to world of warcraft dark

1496
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:11,240
sakura well um moving into a different uh genre we'll go into some fighting games um

1497
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:18,200
mortal kombat x it is x not 10 right so anyway at least that's how they're going yeah yeah

1498
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:25,560
stupid anyway um ermak is the latest roster uh latest person showing up in the roster

1499
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:33,080
and um there are uh already videos of them up on the nether realm twitch stream um katana and

1500
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:38,280
reptile are also on the character select screen um they're going to be played on the next stream

1501
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:44,840
but right now ermak and uh it's going to be out on april 14th don't get it for me for my birthday

1502
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:49,800
that clueless gamer stream video was hilarious did you see that the clueless gamer that conan

1503
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:54,600
o'brien did with the two two football guys playing mortal kombat and i know football but it was

1504
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:59,400
really funny it was really really funny because surely actions surely you've heard of the guy

1505
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:04,840
from the seahawks that got up there and was like i'm only here so i won't get fined and he was

1506
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:08,120
answering all the questions of the president i'm only here so i won't get fined well he was in the

1507
01:46:08,120 --> 01:46:12,680
conan o'brien video and he was much more animated like you know you actually got to see like a more

1508
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:16,440
personable side of him but what i thought was great is that they were sitting there playing

1509
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:21,080
mortal kombat and you know conan says something about like what type of games do you like guys

1510
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:27,880
like to play and that same guy who goes mario kart because toad and it's just but i mean and i

1511
01:46:27,880 --> 01:46:31,160
actually i actually did write a tweet about this because i thought it was very interesting that

1512
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:39,880
this obvious mortal kombat x promo video kind of turned into uh mortal kart um mario kart nintendo

1513
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:44,360
discussion and just speaks to the power of those games that nintendo makes like the reaction to

1514
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:49,720
like some of the the fatalities well even oh my god even my reaction to the fatalities like okay

1515
01:46:49,720 --> 01:46:54,120
look i love mortal kombat there's always been a place for mortal kombat it's very over the top

1516
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:57,720
but you guys know i don't like gore i don't like saw and all this which i know is weird like how

1517
01:46:57,720 --> 01:47:02,120
do you like mortal kombat but you don't like gore it's really really fake because yeah in the

1518
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:07,640
original mortal kombat games it was over the top stupid fake like in mortal kombat 2 okay they

1519
01:47:07,640 --> 01:47:13,400
slice off the person's head and just a big glob of blood goes you know it's really stupid and fake

1520
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:19,240
right but now as i'm watching more and more for this one i'm like okay it's still over the top but

1521
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:25,720
it's it's getting a little much like getting the skin cam or the the skeleton where they chop off

1522
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:30,360
the front half of the guy's face and the brain falls out and others i'm like this is this is

1523
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:35,480
getting to be a bit much i'm not sure about my feelings was it like he sucker punched her in

1524
01:47:35,480 --> 01:47:40,520
the vagina or something like that that was hilarious you can't do that oh yeah their

1525
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:46,120
reaction to that was was it was it was cassie cage did that it was uh cassie cage did the split thing

1526
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:52,600
that her dad johnny cage used to do right and she punches that b girl in the she visited her place

1527
01:47:53,160 --> 01:48:00,200
and it was uh it was like their reaction was like oh fisting in mortal kombat yes yes yes hilarious

1528
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:04,600
anyway well how about something a little bit less violent i mean it's still violent but less violent

1529
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:10,840
okay um udon um udon has done some fantabulous uh capcom artwork they've done some of the last

1530
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:18,200
few of the official uh art books and whatnot and uh some of the comics but they um have a

1531
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:25,240
project out right now that's called the uh capcom fighting tribute where they're basically taking

1532
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:31,080
fan submissions to go into the book um they've extended the uh deadline until february 9th so

1533
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:36,760
that you can go on to uh the udon blog and do your submission but some other people who um have uh

1534
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:43,240
contributed to the past ones i mean uh which were the uh street fighter tribute and dark stalkers

1535
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:49,560
tribute were like brian leo malley and scott campbell and wendy chew different people you know

1536
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:54,760
who tremendous artwork um were in some of the previous editions so if you make it in you would

1537
01:48:54,760 --> 01:49:00,120
be in good company and you have to put olr somewhere in your artwork yes hide it somewhere

1538
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:08,120
in there please hide it make us make us a easter egg and then in more serious news the fcc has

1539
01:49:08,120 --> 01:49:15,800
raised minimum broadband standards by a whole bunch minimum broadband is now 25 mbps instead

1540
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:23,240
of four um and the new minimum upload speed is three from one so that means that basically

1541
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:30,200
homes that don't have good broadband are now going to be federally granted better broadband

1542
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:36,680
which is funny because uh talking with some of my friends overseas like they're on average like six

1543
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:43,240
you know and that's good so we really are spoiled for broadband over here but if we've got the

1544
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:48,600
technology and the means to do it why not and it's also that they can't market something as

1545
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:53,480
broadband unless it reaches these certain levels right yeah exactly got it because i mean i think

1546
01:49:53,480 --> 01:50:02,440
now you've got uh at least what 2k on uh certain dial-ups and yeah so uh this is you know it's

1547
01:50:02,440 --> 01:50:09,160
good news it means that we're gonna have better you know faster internet for more people or playing

1548
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:16,920
a you know rock band online let's hope there's a new rock band to play online we'll see all right

1549
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:22,200
well let's get to the foogle question of the week uh you take facebook and google plus you slam it

1550
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:33,880
together you get foogle each week we like to ask a question of our facebook and google communities

1551
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:38,600
and we're going to read some of our favorite answers on the show right now uh we asked a

1552
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:44,280
pretty easy question this week because you know obviously you know we're not oblivious to what's

1553
01:50:44,280 --> 01:50:48,360
going on in the real world there's probably a lot of people listening to the podcast this week and

1554
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:53,960
less live because of a particular phenomenon that seems to happen this time of year it's the

1555
01:50:53,960 --> 01:50:58,920
commercial bowl right everybody's watching the commercials for the puppies right the puppies

1556
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:04,600
all playing against each other the katy perry concert all right well anyway look uh so we all

1557
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:09,400
know there's a big football game today uh and we're sure you all know about big sports games

1558
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:17,720
like madden and fifa but what's your favorite obscure sports game now a lot of things qualify

1559
01:51:17,720 --> 01:51:22,120
as sports so i purposely let's left this vague because i want to see what people came up with

1560
01:51:22,120 --> 01:51:28,040
so maybe it's something you see on espn 3 or the ocho or maybe it's a foot basket baseball game

1561
01:51:28,040 --> 01:51:32,920
that not a lot of people have heard about so what's your favorite non-mainstream sports game

1562
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:39,480
so some of the comments in chat ander says i love magic the gathering that was on espn at one point

1563
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:45,640
so i guess that counts does magic the gathering count of sports i guess i guess i guess it does

1564
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:49,400
whatever you consider have you ever been to a tournament rob there are people who sweat there

1565
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:54,600
that's that's true that is true uh critical myth says i wish it'd been a better game

1566
01:51:54,600 --> 01:51:59,640
but the quidditch ea game from the ps2 era was fun for a little while there you go some harry

1567
01:51:59,640 --> 01:52:03,640
potter quidditch weren't some people trying to turn that into a real sport at some point like

1568
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:09,000
quote i mean like a sport in the real world rules already it's on a foot foot thing yeah where you

1569
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:13,400
play it i would think you'd at least play it on roller skates so you can glide it's kind of like

1570
01:52:13,640 --> 01:52:17,640
with a broom handle between your legs so it just looks like you go around whipping

1571
01:52:17,640 --> 01:52:25,000
people with your giant broom handle okay maybe this is maybe i just need to keep some thoughts

1572
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:32,920
to myself uh mike b replies on facebook saying i would like to see croquet and badminton i'm

1573
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:36,840
surprised there's never been a there's got to be a croquet or a badminton game out there somewhere

1574
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:43,000
especially badminton come on everybody loves a shuttlecock you know what that's what they're

1575
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:47,720
called i want lawn darts the game who in lawn darts game where you you know if you hit somebody

you win you uh win like 50 million points for they have a lawn darts game it was in one of

1577
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:55,880

1578
01:52:55,880 --> 01:53:02,680
darts in there okay but i want lethal lawn darts all right lethal is that a dream game lethal

1579
01:53:03,640 --> 01:53:11,080
then that would be i think there were lawn darts in zombies ate my neighbors i think maybe i don't

1580
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:15,080
remember you know why lawn darts were banned because of people you know getting poked with them

1581
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:23,400
impaled because those are huge francisco you replied and said uh does daytona usa on the

1584
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:41,480

1605
01:55:46,360 --> 01:55:50,920
guys for participating with the frugal question of the week let's get back to some news loki

1606
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:58,760
all right yeah does unit racers count because that i mean i think you'd erasers ought to count

1607
01:55:58,760 --> 01:56:08,040
that's a great race a great one unicycles anyways um sega sammy is cutting hundreds of jobs

1608
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:14,600
they're basically prioritizing on digital games because uh console market isn't working out for

1609
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:22,200
them too well but they're going to be cutting or i should say soliciting voluntary retirement

1610
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:29,960
for around 300 employees and they're saying um 120 are supposed to be approached by next month

1611
01:56:31,160 --> 01:56:39,320
and most of the layoffs um include the in i guess uh include the uh san francisco

1612
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:41,960
offices in southern california offices

1613
01:56:44,680 --> 01:56:49,560
this makes me sad first first it was the fact that the sega logo wasn't on that building anymore

1614
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:53,320
and it was a zinga logo that went up on that building and now now to hear that sega is no

1615
01:56:53,320 --> 01:56:57,400
longer going to have a presence at all in san francisco is depressing to say the least

1616
01:57:00,760 --> 01:57:07,640
i don't know i just think i think the uh sonic's just not working out for them i guess i don't

1617
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:12,600
well i don't you know i don't i don't know like there there seems to be some things that sega

1618
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:19,720
seems to do pretty well on that um that uh kart racing game the sega all-stars sonic racing that

1619
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:24,360
was pretty good it was a competent game i mean it wasn't quite at the level of mario kart but

1620
01:57:24,360 --> 01:57:28,200
it was a good kind of bandage for that first year of the wii u when there wasn't a mario kart like

1621
01:57:28,200 --> 01:57:31,880
it was they need to just go back to the day when they're making like dreamcast games because the

1622
01:57:31,960 --> 01:57:39,320
dreamcast stuff was awesome also like fantasy star online 2 like fantasy star online had a

1623
01:57:39,320 --> 01:57:43,400
birthday this week in the us anyway i know the japanese release was a little sooner but in the

1624
01:57:43,400 --> 01:57:48,680
us fantasy star online had a birthday this week and and it made me think how long has fantasy

1625
01:57:48,680 --> 01:57:53,800
star online 2 been out and then they even have nova on the vita and we just don't even don't

1626
01:57:53,800 --> 01:57:57,880
even have a lick of a trace of it here in the us i guess they just don't think it's gonna do well

1627
01:57:57,880 --> 01:58:02,040
and now that this closure is happening it just makes me go well shit if they're gonna focus

1628
01:58:02,040 --> 01:58:07,720
only on mobile and stuff now we're hosed we're not gonna see it anymore it's very sad maybe

1629
01:58:07,720 --> 01:58:12,680
they're the next company that's gonna go under uh i hate to think that but doesn't sega also

1630
01:58:12,680 --> 01:58:18,360
have a big business i mean they're probably that but they have a huge business in um arcade games

1631
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:23,640
they run arcades in japan and here don't they yeah i wouldn't want to see them go under them

1632
01:58:23,640 --> 01:58:28,600
they do the crane games a lot of it's possibly that we just won't see they'll go the way konami

1633
01:58:28,600 --> 01:58:34,600
whereas yeah they're you know you're gonna see maybe a release or two a year and it's just all

1634
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:39,800
gonna be mobile tiles well but at least konami's got pt silent hills if nothing else that's true

1635
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:44,600
there's nothing else and he is all metal gear yeah your solid five t is all it will be a good

1636
01:58:44,600 --> 01:58:52,360
year for them and winning 11 that still cares about that wrong country yes this country doesn't

1637
01:58:52,360 --> 01:59:00,120
care about that other countries it's important in other countries so all right uh well i'm i

1638
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:06,600
don't know this this news makes me very sad and it was i mean for me this was the same day as all

1639
01:59:06,600 --> 01:59:11,960
the nintendo stuff we were debating earlier so i mean where some of my thought comes from on why

1640
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:17,080
i do think game companies should get a cut because when i hear about stuff like this i'm like well

1641
01:59:17,080 --> 01:59:22,520
maybe yeah i mean if if even if the sega that they got a cut from let's play videos only amounted to

1642
01:59:22,520 --> 01:59:28,040
like a hundred thousand dollars that could still be like two people's jobs well in san francisco

1643
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:32,760
salaries maybe only one person's job but you know it could still help them in keeping some of these

1644
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:38,200
that's never how that money's that's never how it's been it's not about keeping someone's job

1645
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:44,520
it's you know that's a hundred thousand extra dollars that they could have you know in profit

1646
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:48,680
not like oh we're not gonna keep we're gonna keep another person here uh some comments in chat over

1647
01:59:48,680 --> 01:59:53,800
at live.vog network.com s2100 matt says alien isolation sold like crazy for them recently

1648
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:59,080
but that isn't an originally licensed title dungeon buster says sonic boom tanked hard

1649
01:59:59,080 --> 02:00:04,680
everyone hated it yeah sonic boom didn't look super appealing to me i must say shocking that

1650
02:00:04,680 --> 02:00:09,880
they took no feedback from anybody and like said hey you know everyone's like you know what those

1651
02:00:09,880 --> 02:00:16,120
were hog sections in the games before we fucking hated them just give us sonic and they're like

1652
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:22,600
hey we're gonna put more of that stuff in there we're gonna make him super tall for no fucking

1653
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:28,360
reason all right well uh thanks to some hackers because you know hackers gonna hack uh some

1654
02:00:28,360 --> 02:00:33,720
hackers took a look at the uh new nintendo 3ds and the new nintendo 3ds xl which coming out here

1655
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:37,640
in the states in a couple weeks but uh the japanese ones are already out there right i was talking

1656
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:42,280
about my experience playing one on last week's show uh the hackers have found out by looking

1657
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:48,360
through these consoles that there is a video decoder that supports h264 why is this important

1658
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:55,000
because it's the same video format used to stream wii u content to the gamepad so of course folks

1659
02:00:55,000 --> 02:01:02,280
are speculating could the new 3ds actually function as a wii u gamepad which is funny

1660
02:01:02,280 --> 02:01:06,360
because i want to say when the wii u first came out i threw this suggestion out there about the

1661
02:01:06,360 --> 02:01:11,400
current 3ds but some folks were saying it couldn't handle it the processing power wouldn't be enough

1662
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:16,440
well now here we are with the new 3ds that maybe does have the processing power to handle that

1663
02:01:16,440 --> 02:01:26,840
is this nintendo's way around producing um new uh or or the standalone uh gamepads wii u gamepads

1664
02:01:26,840 --> 02:01:31,800
so that you can have games that support more than one gamepad because right now games can't really

1665
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:37,880
support more than one gamepad but if they made it so that oh well you could use your new 3ds as a

1666
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:42,200
as a full functional wii u controller then that would open it up for all these new experiences

1667
02:01:42,200 --> 02:01:47,560
assuming of course people have new 3ds is available but in a lot of nintendo households

1668
02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:52,360
they probably do so it wouldn't surprise me to hear that this is the route they're going to go down

1669
02:01:53,160 --> 02:01:59,880
i don't know why can't i use the gamepad as a 3ds that's a great question and i think that's

1670
02:01:59,880 --> 02:02:03,960
something you'll probably i mean virtual console i i can't believe it hasn't already happened where

1671
02:02:03,960 --> 02:02:09,720
ds games are coming out on virtual console at least ds games but i don't know maybe it's still

1672
02:02:09,720 --> 02:02:16,840
a matter of time we'll see so we'll see what develops with that dark sakura well you know

1673
02:02:16,840 --> 02:02:22,920
everyone is everyone familiar with the left behind series i roll insert here well um there

1674
02:02:22,920 --> 02:02:29,720
is a Hawaiian court sided with the securities exchange commission sec against an executive from

1675
02:02:29,720 --> 02:02:39,720
the publisher left behind games who was caught um doing uh using insider information um for stock

1676
02:02:39,720 --> 02:02:49,320
trading so basically uh he uh got the got kicked pretty hard for it so basically um the founder

1677
02:02:49,720 --> 02:02:55,960
this is the same court that also nailed the founder Troy Linden for uh found him liable

1678
02:02:55,960 --> 02:03:02,440
for 3.6 million in disgorgement interest and penalties um after granting sec's motion for

1679
02:03:02,440 --> 02:03:13,880
summary judgment so basically uh for being a you know quote christian organization they sure are

1680
02:03:13,960 --> 02:03:25,400
some greedy bastards mailed that's it all right i'm starting to see if anybody is commenting that

1681
02:03:25,400 --> 02:03:31,800
over at live.vognetwork.com in our chat room but uh most people still still stuck on the 3ds uh

1682
02:03:31,800 --> 02:03:36,280
tiger coloss saying it'd be nice if the new 3ds had the ability to broadcast the games on twitch

1683
02:03:36,280 --> 02:03:42,120
instead of having people send in their old 3ds to get it modded with a 3ds capture device but

1684
02:03:42,120 --> 02:03:46,600
it sounds like Jamie what you're talking about is more where i say oh these companies should get

1685
02:03:46,600 --> 02:03:51,000
that extra hundred thousand dollars they can help them save jobs that money would really be used for

1686
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:56,280
things you're talking about right like insider stock trading and all that type of crap it just

1687
02:03:56,280 --> 02:04:05,720
means i just i hate people who are more interested in their own personal greed than in the well-being

1688
02:04:05,720 --> 02:04:12,360
of other people that's i'm gonna get political with it i'm gonna get political that's a problem

1689
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:19,800
with capitalism there has to be some kind of balance in the system that's going to make sure

1690
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:24,680
that other people are going to be well taken care of so but you know the thing is that as many

1691
02:04:24,680 --> 02:04:30,120
people get nailed for this there's more of them getting you know pats on the back from their

1692
02:04:30,120 --> 02:04:36,360
investors or from the people they've done favors for or you know their government buddies so it's

1693
02:04:36,360 --> 02:04:41,560
just i'm i'm gonna stop before i go on a tangent it's fine it happened everybody has personal

1694
02:04:41,560 --> 02:04:46,200
thoughts on things i'm served some may disagree but that's that's why we're the show where every

1695
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:50,840
gamer has a voice all right uh a few more stories for you guys before we get to the mailbag logie

1696
02:04:51,560 --> 02:04:58,520
so he is getting some more seed money uh with the chinese e-commerce company alibaba apparently

1697
02:04:58,520 --> 02:05:05,080
they've injected 10 million dollars into uh the console and the thought is that they're

1698
02:05:05,640 --> 02:05:11,720
possibly going to be using the uia software and game library to um add it to their set top box

1699
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:17,720
and you may remember that they have that uia everywhere um initiative that they started off

1700
02:05:17,720 --> 02:05:21,880
with the mad cats mojo console which actually i haven't really heard too much about that console

1701
02:05:21,880 --> 02:05:27,640
since it's i'm pretty sure that's out already i wonder how that works with the mojo and if it

1702
02:05:27,640 --> 02:05:35,800
works well it'd be interesting to see um julie erman didn't confirm that but apparently it's

1703
02:05:35,800 --> 02:05:41,160
been reported by the wall street journal and uh basically you know they had all they've confirmed

1704
02:05:41,160 --> 02:05:46,680
is that they've been working with other partners to bring their platform and games to devices um

1705
02:05:46,680 --> 02:05:57,480
you know starting with the mad cats um device here in the u.s and um zao mi in china so i don't

1706
02:05:57,960 --> 02:06:02,760
it's interesting i keep forgetting about the uya yeah i was like i was gonna ask like so what's the

1707
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:07,960
uya been up to for the past years because fuck if i know i mean it seems like there's still you know

1708
02:06:07,960 --> 02:06:11,800
when i guess like stuff on there but yeah when i go to some of the trade shows like at e3 last

1709
02:06:11,800 --> 02:06:17,160
year at the indie cave booth you know it definitely is there's a lot of indie support for uya but the

1710
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:23,480
thing is a lot of the stuff that's on uya i feel like is still available on steam so as somebody

1711
02:06:23,480 --> 02:06:28,520
who already owns a pc and does a lot of gaming there i don't always see the need to get the uya

1712
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:33,240
separately but this is very interesting if uya is going to try and carve a niche for itself maybe in

1713
02:06:33,240 --> 02:06:37,960
foreign markets where you know especially in a place like china a lot of these other consoles

1714
02:06:37,960 --> 02:06:43,400
don't do business in china or i think wasn't the xbox one like supposed to like just come out in

1715
02:06:43,400 --> 02:06:47,960
china but then it got pushed back and you know but like they're trying to kind of break through

1716
02:06:47,960 --> 02:06:52,280
so it'd be very interesting if the uya can maybe carve a niche for that and being you know because

1717
02:06:52,280 --> 02:06:57,160
china's a pretty big place if you weren't aware it would be interesting to see if maybe uya can

1718
02:06:57,160 --> 02:07:02,920
make money in those markets that are tapped for some of the other big players it would be

1719
02:07:02,920 --> 02:07:06,920
interesting to see i i'm kind of curious to do some more research on that mojo console just

1720
02:07:06,920 --> 02:07:12,440
because i know that's out already and one of the cool things about it was you're able to map like

1721
02:07:12,440 --> 02:07:18,200
controls using the controller for games that didn't necessarily support controllers if that

1722
02:07:18,200 --> 02:07:22,920
makes sense yeah um so i'm kind of curious to see it looks like that they just basically run the

1723
02:07:22,920 --> 02:07:29,000
uya games through an app on the actual device plus you know can do just android games as well so

1724
02:07:30,120 --> 02:07:36,760
i'd be curious to see how that how that looks or and also to see if the games on that console play

1725
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:42,040
better than say on the uya itself because uya itself isn't that powerful so it'd be kind of

1726
02:07:42,040 --> 02:07:48,120
interesting to see you know how that would differ and besides that looks like i like their controller

1727
02:07:48,120 --> 02:07:56,040
a lot better all right well um moving on to a story about final fantasy 15. i know a lot of

1728
02:07:56,040 --> 02:07:59,960
you guys are looking forward to final fantasy 15 of course we don't know the date for that yet but

1729
02:07:59,960 --> 02:08:06,760
we do know a demo is coming out with final fantasy type 0 hd which is due on the playstation 4 but

1730
02:08:06,760 --> 02:08:10,440
even though we're being promised that we're going to get this final fantasy 15 demo with

1731
02:08:10,440 --> 02:08:16,760
final fantasy type 0 there is a possibility that the final fantasy 15 demo may not make it in time

1732
02:08:16,760 --> 02:08:22,200
for final fantasy type 0 hd and where this is coming from is from an ask me anything that was

1733
02:08:22,200 --> 02:08:27,160
done this week uh the director behind type 0 hajima tabata actually went on reddit to do one

1734
02:08:27,160 --> 02:08:31,560
of these ask me anythings and one of the things he said about the final fantasy 15 demo he didn't

1735
02:08:31,560 --> 02:08:36,920
want to share you know he wanted to focus on type 0 and getting people to pre-order it but uh as far

1736
02:08:36,920 --> 02:08:41,800
as the final fantasy 15 demo went he said the team is doing its best but they're still optimizing the

1737
02:08:41,800 --> 02:08:48,760
game it may not make type 0's hd launch a few details were given out though that you will be

1738
02:08:48,760 --> 02:08:55,000
able to jump in the game and cindy's identity will be revealed in or is it cindy or sydney i

1739
02:08:55,000 --> 02:09:00,920
thought it was sydney because it's a female cid now in 15 or i guess we're gonna get that answer

1740
02:09:00,920 --> 02:09:07,800
if uh you know perhaps if uh cindy or sydney or whatever her name is is the actual incarnation

1741
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:12,040
of syd in the game or maybe it's like syd's daughter or something who knows there's a

1742
02:09:12,040 --> 02:09:15,960
million things that could be going on uh we'll find that out in the final fantasy 15 demo

1743
02:09:15,960 --> 02:09:21,000
apparently whenever that comes out it may not actually come out i would imagine what would

1744
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:27,800
happen if it doesn't make type 0's release is that you'll get a code for the demo that will download

1745
02:09:27,800 --> 02:09:33,880
whenever they do release it a couple weeks later but it may not be the same time now keep in mind

1746
02:09:33,880 --> 02:09:38,360
this isn't the first game to ever have this happen for example a game like crackdown way

1747
02:09:38,360 --> 02:09:43,240
back on the xbox 360 yes the original crackdown on 360 one of the big reasons why people bought

1748
02:09:43,240 --> 02:09:48,440
that game was because of the halo 3 demo right but the halo 3 demo was not the exact same time

1749
02:09:48,440 --> 02:09:53,480
as crackdown came out it was well after you know it was a couple months after so it's not like

1750
02:09:53,480 --> 02:09:57,960
there isn't precedent for this ever happening before so i want to say that they said originally

1751
02:09:57,960 --> 02:10:02,200
that it wasn't going to be at the same time maybe a later date but you just get access to it i think

1752
02:10:02,200 --> 02:10:07,560
a lot of people might be assuming that i don't know i was going to pick up type 0 anyway the

1753
02:10:07,560 --> 02:10:13,080
final fantasy 15 demo is just kind of icing on the cake in my opinion but we'll see we'll see if uh

1754
02:10:13,080 --> 02:10:17,800
it impacts sales or what have you meanwhile we're going to go to the mailbag you guys send us emails

1755
02:10:17,800 --> 02:10:22,200
every week at participate at orange lounge radio.com and dark soccer is going to dive into

1756
02:10:22,200 --> 02:10:28,360
the mailbag head first and uh find some emails from y'all that are worth going but first this

1757
02:10:28,360 --> 02:10:36,040
time but first cannonball cannonball yep so we actually have a bunch of emails from uh robert m

1758
02:10:36,040 --> 02:10:39,560
all right i i hope they're all as short as the first one so i'll go look at them

1759
02:10:40,520 --> 02:10:45,240
after hearing the raging spazzinators advice i plan to call sony support next week i'm writing

1760
02:10:45,240 --> 02:10:50,120
this wednesday 1 28 instead of repairs or replacement work this week has been pretty

1761
02:10:50,120 --> 02:10:54,600
busy and i haven't actually had any of the issues i described for a while but have no intention of

1762
02:10:54,600 --> 02:10:59,320
taking it for granted is there any way to back up key save data onto physical media just to be

1763
02:10:59,320 --> 02:11:05,480
on the safe side before we go further i'm going to see if he figured it out for himself but i

1764
02:11:05,480 --> 02:11:10,760
just want to say for those that aren't aware if you didn't hear last week's show um in a nutshell

1765
02:11:10,760 --> 02:11:16,120
i'm cutting corners but this guy was worried that his playstation was failing and he was wondering

1766
02:11:16,120 --> 02:11:21,080
should he buy a new playstation 3 like what should we what should he do and a lot of us were saying

1767
02:11:21,080 --> 02:11:28,040
just call sony and see you know weigh your options if nothing else indeed indeed so next email from

1768
02:11:28,040 --> 02:11:36,040
robert m addenda since my last email i did contact sony via live chat today sunday about 1 30 to 1 45

1772
02:11:49,320 --> 02:11:54,520

thank you very much for writing that email seriously because um without going into this

1792
02:13:43,240 --> 02:13:48,520
too much i was having a bit of a rough week earlier this week and i got some kind of bad news

1793
02:13:48,520 --> 02:13:52,600
midweek and it's kind of one of those things where it's like eh we'll probably get around it we'll

1794
02:13:52,600 --> 02:13:57,960
get over it but it's it's one of those things where it was a hump and not a good kind yeah it

1795
02:13:57,960 --> 02:14:03,880
was it was the not good kind of hump and sometimes you know there's a lot of i don't know i don't

1796
02:14:03,880 --> 02:14:09,640
know how to phrase it but sometimes i feel like this show has been around for so long and yet

1797
02:14:09,640 --> 02:14:13,960
for some people it's just not good enough what we're doing what we're doing is just not

1798
02:14:13,960 --> 02:14:19,640
legitimate enough and i'm not sure what legitimate even is but apparently oh and i know what you're

1799
02:14:19,640 --> 02:14:23,960
talking about on certain days of the week we're not it you know type of thing and it's just it

1800
02:14:23,960 --> 02:14:27,960
depends what you're trying to do as far as legitimacy god it's so frustrating sometimes

1801
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:33,880
it's like you know i'm just trying to create a good show here but whatever and honestly like

1802
02:14:33,880 --> 02:14:39,240
not even an hour after i was just kind of dealing with all those frustrations i peek in the mailbag

1803
02:14:39,240 --> 02:14:43,080
just to get an idea of what's going to be coming for the show a little early and i actually saw

1804
02:14:43,080 --> 02:14:49,400

1839
02:18:30,360 --> 02:18:37,560
of bullshit going on in the world i just want to say just people for the few people of you who

1840
02:18:37,560 --> 02:18:43,720
restore my faith in humanity on a daily basis by doing nice things by adopting puppies and kittens

1841
02:18:43,720 --> 02:18:52,680
and you know leaving you know paying somebody's playing you know paying somebody's tab at dinner

1842
02:18:52,680 --> 02:18:57,800
for a complete stranger doing nice things we need more of you people in the world and fewer of the

1843
02:18:57,800 --> 02:19:03,240
assholes that are only looking to line their own pockets or looking out for number one if if i i

1844
02:19:03,240 --> 02:19:12,040
encourage people this if you vote if you act in you know the public interest anything that you do

1845
02:19:13,480 --> 02:19:17,800
every so often just look beyond yourself and ask yourself if someone else is going to benefit from

1846
02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:25,480
it too that's all i ask and then actually benefit other people all right now loki um i guess just

1847
02:19:26,280 --> 02:19:30,040
fb my cat you're not a programmer cat you don't know what the fuck you're doing

1848
02:19:30,040 --> 02:19:31,080
so i'm messing with my shit

1849
02:19:33,720 --> 02:19:39,480
minda does that too um especially when she tries to program with her ass i mean come on

1850
02:19:39,480 --> 02:19:45,080
that takes talent you can't do that minda's trying to guide dan by headbutting his mouse hand

1851
02:19:48,120 --> 02:19:51,240
uh the cat should just get together and see if they take over the world

1852
02:19:52,040 --> 02:19:55,800
i i don't really have a good fu of the week i do have a lot of things i want to say i

1853
02:19:55,800 --> 02:20:02,440
just don't want to say them publicly so i'll just say an fu to um fuckery that's i'm gonna

1854
02:20:02,440 --> 02:20:09,160
just give a general fu to fuck fucking fuckery that's that's my fu of the week very creative no

1855
02:20:09,960 --> 02:20:13,800
all right uh just a couple more stories for you guys then we'll get to the skype line at

1856
02:20:13,800 --> 02:20:19,640
1877 game olr or a username on skype orange lounge radio but not yet we have a few more stories first

1857
02:20:19,640 --> 02:20:28,600
all right so um xbox they've done pretty well i guess for uh the fourth quarter so it's kind

1858
02:20:28,600 --> 02:20:35,800
of confusing so quarter two of their 2015 financial year uh which i guess just recently

1859
02:20:35,800 --> 02:20:44,600
ended on december 31st they've um sold 6.6 million consoles during that time probably because they

1860
02:20:44,600 --> 02:20:49,560
did that nice no price break and threw games in there that's how you do it you know and they'll

1861
02:20:50,360 --> 02:20:56,360
because people didn't care about connect unfortunately um basically you know their comment

1862
02:20:56,360 --> 02:21:02,920
was our sales engagement worldwide continues to focus on helping uh customers and partners

1863
02:21:02,920 --> 02:21:07,240
transition to the cloud navigable i'm sorry i'm already losing interest in what this guy's saying

1864
02:21:07,240 --> 02:21:13,080
so i'm going to stop there um and then of course you know not to be outdone by that

1865
02:21:13,960 --> 02:21:22,680
uh 1.84 million new 3ds units have shipped in 2014 i'm assuming this is just the japan since

1866
02:21:23,320 --> 02:21:29,880
obviously the new 3ds isn't out here yet um and the wii u is up to 9.2 million units

1867
02:21:30,520 --> 02:21:36,440
so probably think well the new 3ds is because people need their new shit and well the wii u

1868
02:21:36,440 --> 02:21:41,080
just because it's some really good first party software for this year so hopefully

1869
02:21:41,160 --> 02:21:49,560
keep that momentum going but yeah all right we'll see uh i'm very curious to see what nintendo's

1870
02:21:49,560 --> 02:21:54,360
e3 looks like that's for sure all i need to see is a new excite truck a new excite truck

1871
02:21:54,360 --> 02:22:01,160
fuck this might be waiting a while exactly exactly if you gotta if i want to excite you know truck

1872
02:22:01,160 --> 02:22:06,120
sequel i gotta make it myself all right well uh getting into one more story here and i felt this

1873
02:22:06,120 --> 02:22:12,680
was a very good note to end on tonight and speaking about like family and listeners and

1874
02:22:12,680 --> 02:22:17,400
you guys that motivate us to do great things every week some of you guys are out there doing great

1875
02:22:17,400 --> 02:22:22,040
things in the gaming community and um i think this is really cool because uh this guy i don't

1876
02:22:22,040 --> 02:22:26,600
know if this guy still listens to the show but i know he has in the past and you guys may not have

1877
02:22:26,600 --> 02:22:31,320
actually known this if you've heard about this guy in the media but um he was somebody he follows me

1878
02:22:31,320 --> 02:22:36,360
on twitter okay so i know he listened to olr at one point and i know you send emails and stuff so

1879
02:22:36,360 --> 02:22:41,160
i know i've heard this guy before i don't know if he still listens but if you are still listening

1880
02:22:41,160 --> 02:22:48,920
to the show kevin ddr a big congrats to you because i don't know if you know kevin ddr but

1881
02:22:48,920 --> 02:22:53,320
even though ddr is in his name which of course we all love ddr kevin ddr is very famous now for

1882
02:22:53,320 --> 02:22:57,640
tetris he does he was in the awesome games done quick and he did the whole tetris thing that was

1883
02:22:57,640 --> 02:23:03,080
really blowing a lot of people away right well he was streaming on twitch and he actually reached

1884
02:23:03,080 --> 02:23:10,440
a very very difficult to achieve grandmaster ranking in arika's tetris the grandmaster three

1885
02:23:10,440 --> 02:23:16,200
this makes him the first player in north america to actually achieve this rank and because it was

1886
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:21,480
streaming when it was happened you can actually see a little stream of it online uh so in order

1887
02:23:21,480 --> 02:23:27,000
to get the grandmaster promotional exam which yes this is all built into a tetris game here's what

1888
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:32,760
you have to do you have to get a gm rank during the majority of your last several master mode

1889
02:23:32,760 --> 02:23:37,960
playthroughs this means you have to have the maximum drop speed level by clearing several

1890
02:23:37,960 --> 02:23:43,240
dozen lines in under seven minutes and then you have to play a minute's worth of tetris on a

1891
02:23:43,240 --> 02:23:49,960
credit scroll with pieces that turn invisible while they are dropping apparently there's five

1892
02:23:49,960 --> 02:23:56,360
people hidden yeah it's crazy there's five players in japan that have achieved this rank and now kevin

1893
02:23:56,360 --> 02:24:02,200
ddr has uh done this in the us so congrats if you are out there somewhere listening or what have you

1894
02:24:02,200 --> 02:24:08,280
um big congrats to you on that feed that's amazing and what's also amazing about this i've got to say

1895
02:24:08,920 --> 02:24:15,560
is that between kevin's efforts at awesome games done quick and what he did this week on twitch

1896
02:24:15,560 --> 02:24:22,120
more people are talking about this tetris the grandmaster game than are talking about ubisoft's

1897
02:24:22,120 --> 02:24:29,000
buggy tetris game that was just released on playstation 4 like three weeks ago it seems like

1898
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:34,840
i don't want to say no one curr but doesn't it seem like we're getting the less exciting version

1899
02:24:34,840 --> 02:24:41,000
of tetris here what is what is what is up with that where you know we've got this exciting

1900
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:46,040
competition going on over here yet the one they release here in the states is kind of it's it's

1901
02:24:46,040 --> 02:24:51,320
got some frame skip going on it's not it's not because it's casuals over here it's dirty filthy

1902
02:24:51,320 --> 02:25:01,480
casuals marissa congusto in chat says this sounds like tetris snm i i guess i don't know

1903
02:25:02,360 --> 02:25:05,560
kevin will have to let us know if he's out there listening somewhere although he's probably a

1904
02:25:05,560 --> 02:25:09,640
little busy playing tetris although i i would think he deserves a break at this point i don't

1905
02:25:09,640 --> 02:25:16,040
know so there you go uh a good note to end on there uh something that uh people i remember

1906
02:25:16,040 --> 02:25:20,440
listening to the show from a long time ago are out there doing it's fantastic uh we are going

1907
02:25:20,440 --> 02:25:25,480
to open up the skype line you guys uh i gotta get on the right account though so while i open

1908
02:25:25,480 --> 02:25:31,800
up the skype line over at 1877 game olr or a username on skype orange lounge radio uh

1909
02:25:31,800 --> 02:25:35,320
loki do you happen to have any last minute stories for us tonight yeah as i alluded to

1910
02:25:35,320 --> 02:25:40,200
earlier in the show when we were talking about nintendo and stuff like that and how you know

1911
02:25:40,200 --> 02:25:47,800
people can abuse copyright claims tech lands who just released dying light is doing such a thing

1912
02:25:48,440 --> 02:25:56,760
they are filing dmca claims against videos they're showing mods for the game and not even

1913
02:25:56,760 --> 02:26:05,880
necessarily like cheating mods but like there was a mod for example that um what was it they had

1914
02:26:05,880 --> 02:26:12,840
there was one it was just like a like a small it was like a one text file mod that they had

1915
02:26:13,800 --> 02:26:18,840
um but basically yeah they're slapping claims against anybody that's putting up mods in the

1916
02:26:18,840 --> 02:26:24,680
game they're saying because um you know it affects single player as well as multiplayer

1917
02:26:26,200 --> 02:26:30,440
i don't know i think it's kind of lame well if it affects single player i mean

1918
02:26:31,320 --> 02:26:37,400
well who cares about single player um you know because whatever well is it oh is it just if it's

1919
02:26:37,480 --> 02:26:41,320
your own single player then but does it affect other people's single players

1920
02:26:42,440 --> 02:26:47,080
no it's just i think your own single player game they're talking about gotcha i was trying to

1921
02:26:47,080 --> 02:26:57,240
remember what it was that was they were modding it was um what was it here oh it was a mod to

1922
02:26:57,240 --> 02:27:04,760
remove film grain from the game a film grain like filter that's on the actual thing so there was a

1923
02:27:04,760 --> 02:27:13,640
mod to remove that and they were dmca you know it's so stupid that they would do that it's like

1924
02:27:13,640 --> 02:27:20,920
who gives a shit it's fucking film green oh my god that ruined the game all right uh let's get

1925
02:27:20,920 --> 02:27:25,560
to the phones we got somebody calling in here uh again 1877 game olr or username on skype

1926
02:27:25,560 --> 02:27:28,600
orange launch radio but we do have a call on the line hi you're on orange launch radio who's this

1927
02:27:29,320 --> 02:27:34,760
hi this is regina here hey regina what's on your mind uh not no not a whole lot uh

1928
02:27:35,640 --> 02:27:41,560
uh one question and the one comment uh it serves uh the question since it's the

1929
02:27:42,360 --> 02:27:49,240
quickest part of the call um do you know if uh the three of you or maybe even bob you

1930
02:27:49,240 --> 02:27:57,160
are planning on really doing anything with uh uh bob's uh you know sting group uh like in terms of

1931
02:27:57,160 --> 02:28:04,360
like doing like events or organized uh play gates or wherever you want to call them uh i know it's

1932
02:28:04,360 --> 02:28:11,240
been a while since we uh anything has really been done with the group yeah you know the

1933
02:28:11,240 --> 02:28:16,680
participation for those events wasn't as good as we had hoped it was uh very small for some of the

1934
02:28:16,680 --> 02:28:21,640
outings that we did um but i think if we can get people enthusiastic about a certain game or

1935
02:28:21,640 --> 02:28:26,360
something i think we're more than open to that idea um excited even and maybe we just have to

1936
02:28:26,360 --> 02:28:30,120
mix it up a little bit i mean now especially in the day and age where you can do streaming

1937
02:28:30,120 --> 02:28:35,240
maybe bobby or myself or jamie or hell anybody on the network with this capability there's no reason

1938
02:28:35,240 --> 02:28:39,000
they can't do it it could even be you know somebody like brad or john from critical myth one of our

1939
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:44,040
other shows um electric sisterhood loved it love to see them get involved too could be uh like

1940
02:28:44,040 --> 02:28:49,960
streaming a game and then other vog people can actually like join in on that same game or

1941
02:28:49,960 --> 02:28:53,720
something and and like maybe like do like a group live streaming event or something i think it might

1942
02:28:53,720 --> 02:28:59,560
just be about doing something a little more to kind of stir up the interest i don't know plus

1943
02:28:59,560 --> 02:29:05,400
it's also hard finding the right game because you have to find games that people own unless you can

1944
02:29:05,400 --> 02:29:09,800
find just the right free to play game but then you know is it something that's going to be a big

1945
02:29:09,800 --> 02:29:14,760
download what is that going to entail you know sometimes it's about finding that right game that's

1946
02:29:14,760 --> 02:29:19,320
why it's good to do games that a lot of people have like i don't know minecraft a lot of people

1947
02:29:19,320 --> 02:29:25,480
have that game um mario kart 8 uh did a little tournament on there it had pretty good participation

1948
02:29:25,480 --> 02:29:31,160
so i think a lot of times just about finding that right mix so yeah i can definitely see the point

1949
02:29:31,160 --> 02:29:38,120
now my original line of thought was you know i could be way off the mark here but you know if

1950
02:29:38,120 --> 02:29:45,400
uh you know the vog administrators you know a group of administrators you know really you know

1951
02:29:45,480 --> 02:29:51,000
for lack of a better term pick things up with the steam group and start organizing stuff

1952
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:59,800
now maybe they would possibly draw new members into the group and then hopefully in turn draw

1953
02:29:59,800 --> 02:30:09,400
traffic to the vog sites and i'm i'm lying about that you and bobby and walking dark sakura who

1954
02:30:09,400 --> 02:30:16,040
would love to see uh new listeners know new registered members to the site so and so forth

1955
02:30:16,040 --> 02:30:21,400
i'm i'm all for bringing more cool minded people you know people that will respect the number one

1956
02:30:21,400 --> 02:30:26,840
rule is uh don't be a dick when you game online i'm all for bringing more people in that that uh

1957
02:30:26,840 --> 02:30:30,920
like-minded people to do that so whatever we have to do to get visibility i'm i'm willing to try

1958
02:30:30,920 --> 02:30:34,760
ideas you know if you don't try it you'll never know if something will work or not so i'm willing

1959
02:30:34,760 --> 02:30:38,520
to i'm willing to give the vog game night another go so we'll uh we'll have to talk about that

1960
02:30:38,520 --> 02:30:47,080
offline and and uh figure out a good good plan all right now um in regards to robert m's email

1961
02:30:47,080 --> 02:30:55,000
um i heard that he posted a question i didn't hear the full question uh he asked about backing up

1962
02:30:55,000 --> 02:31:00,600
stuff right yeah he wanted to see if you could actually back things up from the ps3 uh like

1963
02:31:00,600 --> 02:31:05,240
your i guess your save data and things like that which you should be able to do to a uh correctly

1964
02:31:05,240 --> 02:31:09,000
formatted hard drive because i've actually done that myself with uh one of my portable drives

1965
02:31:09,800 --> 02:31:18,920
yeah yeah um i the only thing i ever really backed up personally was uh game saves you know you can

1966
02:31:18,920 --> 02:31:23,960
back those up to the cloud or if you have like a external hard drive the flashlight you can back

1967
02:31:23,960 --> 02:31:29,080
up your you saves that way oh i totally forgot that's right if this guy's a playstation plus he

1968
02:31:29,080 --> 02:31:34,760
can uh he can back up all his game saves into the cloud really easy yeah the only ones that

1969
02:31:34,760 --> 02:31:41,240
you're more or less forced to back up to the cloud as opposed to um a local drive would be

1970
02:31:41,240 --> 02:31:46,440
the ones that are copy protected those ones you have to do on the cloud uh but the rest of them

1971
02:31:46,440 --> 02:31:52,200
if you might have like a local copy copy of those you can put those on flash drive or whatever

1972
02:31:52,200 --> 02:31:58,440
like uh loki mentioned you know to use the local driver you have to be you know for me

1973
02:31:58,440 --> 02:32:03,800
in fact 32 right that's right but there's um there's more instructions online on how to do

1974
02:32:03,800 --> 02:32:08,360
that but um definitely if you if this uh guy doesn't have playstation plus uh he should go

1975
02:32:08,360 --> 02:32:13,720
get his free one from the lawsuit and uh he can back up that data into the cloud that would be a

1976
02:32:13,720 --> 02:32:21,800
good idea so yeah and um just so that i don't necessarily hog up a whole lot of time not like

1977
02:32:21,800 --> 02:32:29,720
tonight but in the future answering questions or whatnot but if robert um has any questions that

1978
02:32:29,960 --> 02:32:36,840
he thinks i may be able to help him with he can easily contact me personally through skype uh

1979
02:32:37,560 --> 02:32:43,640
my guys you know skype gave on their spazzing in towards yeah spazzing in their period psp

1980
02:32:44,360 --> 02:32:51,480
um you know uh as long as i'm online you know he's more than welcome to call me and you know i

1981
02:32:51,480 --> 02:32:58,600
ask ask way so there you go our our own as kuba jp in chat says our sony tech support reggie

1982
02:33:00,280 --> 02:33:03,960
i think it's ragey i don't know anyway all right well spaz nator i'm gonna let you go okay

1983
02:33:04,600 --> 02:33:10,600
sure sounds good all right my friend all right uh one eight seven seven game olr and you know

1984
02:33:10,600 --> 02:33:16,760
again rage nators point spaz nators point spaz a rage nators point is uh show our vog group on

1985
02:33:16,760 --> 02:33:21,400
steam a little love and uh i know all three of us are on it right i'm on it you're on it yeah but

1986
02:33:21,400 --> 02:33:29,080
i don't play my scene but you're there so uh you can check that i actually i am on uh steam and uh

1987
02:33:29,160 --> 02:33:33,560
i broadcast all my gameplay now here's the thing if you watch a steam broadcast of mine

1988
02:33:33,560 --> 02:33:38,040
i don't commentate or do anything over it i just you can watch me playing the game but i don't do

1989
02:33:38,040 --> 02:33:41,960
any commentary but if i'm on twitch then i'm usually doing commentary webcam and all that

1990
02:33:41,960 --> 02:33:47,160
stuff but i like being able to peek at games just to see like what the games look like in motion

1991
02:33:47,160 --> 02:33:50,520
because you know trailers only show you so much screenshots only show you so much but actually

1992
02:33:50,520 --> 02:33:57,080
watching somebody kind of playing the game goes a long way a long way in my opinion one eight seven

1993
02:33:57,080 --> 02:34:01,720
seven game olr username on skype orange lounge radio we're going to uh try to keep it open a

1994
02:34:01,720 --> 02:34:06,120
little bit here to try and get some more calls um meanwhile loki any other last minute stories that

1995

2003
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:55,720
network.com matt made a little post there with some of his youtubes there just be careful if

2004
02:34:55,720 --> 02:35:02,040
you shot any nintendo games might be you might be owing some money over to nintendo i'm just giving

2005
02:35:02,040 --> 02:35:07,720
you crap i'm just giving you crap um let's see uh i don't really see a lot of other tweets besides

2006
02:35:07,720 --> 02:35:14,280
that at least that came in today sometimes we get tagged in in posts that are unrelated here

2007
02:35:14,280 --> 02:35:19,080
i was getting a few tweets about rockage as kind of like a follow-up to last week's interview

2008
02:35:19,080 --> 02:35:22,680
and some of the bands actually reached out to say hello which i thought was really cool

2009
02:35:22,680 --> 02:35:26,440
and so some folks were asking like you know are you going to be at rockage did you figure that out

2010
02:35:26,440 --> 02:35:30,760
so yes if you were listening to last week's show and you heard our interview all about rockage

2011
02:35:30,760 --> 02:35:36,680
san jose i will be there for sure saturday for sure i can't be there sunday because i got to get

2012
02:35:36,680 --> 02:35:42,440
back and do olr right guys so i'm going to be here back here on sunday i'm trying right now to see if

2013
02:35:42,440 --> 02:35:46,920
i can find a place to stay in the bay area if i have a friend over there that might let me crash

2014
02:35:46,920 --> 02:35:52,440
with them so i could stay friday night um so that way because i'm too cheap for a hotel and that way

2015
02:35:52,440 --> 02:35:56,600
i can drive down and maybe get a little bit of the concert friday night after work uh we'll see what

2016
02:35:56,600 --> 02:36:00,200
happens all right well we do have the phones lighting up with some more calls wow all of a

2017
02:36:00,200 --> 02:36:03,400
sudden lit up with some more calls let's get to it hi you're on orange launch radio who's this

2018
02:36:03,400 --> 02:36:08,280
it's shane hey shane i haven't heard from you in a while what's up well you guys sound bored so i

2019
02:36:08,280 --> 02:36:14,600
thought i'd give you a call what are you bored too yes i'm super bored hey we're all bored why

2020
02:36:14,600 --> 02:36:19,720
don't we talk about the weather it's dark out there's no weather that i can see but it might

2021
02:36:19,720 --> 02:36:24,760
be foggy though so that's awesome it might be what do you think of the uh x right power ranger

2022
02:36:25,560 --> 02:36:32,920
stabbing oh why you gotta why you gotta go to a downer um i don't have like a real opinion on it

2023
02:36:32,920 --> 02:36:40,200
because it sounds like it may be self-defense and that's fine i'm more like kind of laughing about

2024
02:36:40,200 --> 02:36:46,040
how all these outlets that i keep reading the story on make up the most random stories about

2025
02:36:46,040 --> 02:36:51,640
him like apparently he was the red ranger in the animated samurai power rangers which

2026
02:36:51,640 --> 02:36:59,000
there wasn't an animated samurai power ranger uh season and so that's funny and then one person

2027
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:04,360
or not one person one site linked to him and showed him as the red samurai ranger and then

2028
02:37:04,360 --> 02:37:09,080
put a clip of him up and it didn't even have him in it it had the red samurai ranger which he was

2029
02:37:09,080 --> 02:37:17,240
not so i don't know i think he is innocent proven guilty so we'll see i am so lost right now and

2030
02:37:17,240 --> 02:37:21,000
all this power ranger stuff you're talking about i wish we could just talk about the new american

2031
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:26,280
one because it's so good i've watched it six times now since it debuted this yeah but this is you

2032
02:37:26,280 --> 02:37:31,320
you have to send that my way because i won't so i'll know what you're talking about because i

2033
02:37:31,320 --> 02:37:35,960
talk about it a lot all the time this is also you that we're talking about so you're biased

2034
02:37:35,960 --> 02:37:40,200
inherently no they told me the story and it sounded like it's pretty cool because it had

2035
02:37:40,200 --> 02:37:44,920
dinosaurs and shit all right well it is a video game show are there any video games you've been

2036
02:37:44,920 --> 02:37:50,520
playing lately shane um i've been playing gravely default a lot lately um and i feel bad because

2037
02:37:50,520 --> 02:37:55,800
it didn't make like my top three list or whatever um of last year and that game came out last year

2038
02:37:55,800 --> 02:38:01,000
but i never beat it and now that i've picked it back up again um it's really really good i'm

2039
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:07,640
loving it i'm sad that i somehow just kind of skipped over it and let it go to uh you know

2040
02:38:08,680 --> 02:38:13,880
video game like i don't know what do you want to call like crematorium or something because

2041
02:38:13,880 --> 02:38:18,680
it just sits over there waiting to die what burned what got you in the mood to play go

2042
02:38:18,680 --> 02:38:27,240
back and visit bravely default um fancy explorers oh oh actually um since you brought that up uh

2043
02:38:27,240 --> 02:38:30,920
you know last week i talked about my thoughts you know you were good enough to bring your new three

2044
02:38:31,400 --> 02:38:36,760
that you bought you bought a japanese new 3ds and you brought it over so i could check it out

2045
02:38:36,760 --> 02:38:40,920
so i talked about my own thoughts last week but we didn't really get your thoughts um first off

2046
02:38:40,920 --> 02:38:50,040
why did you decide to import a japanese new 3ds so one reason let's go with the let's go with the uh

2047
02:38:50,040 --> 02:38:56,600
doesn't make me sound incredibly crazy reason um they announced in the last nintendo direct

2048
02:38:56,600 --> 02:39:04,280
a new rhythm heaven game for japan nothing for us and i've been wanting to play final fantasy

2049
02:39:04,280 --> 02:39:10,600
explorers as well so i figured that was a good enough reason those two reasons together good

2050
02:39:10,600 --> 02:39:16,360
enough and there's always like japanese games i want to play that i you know either don't get a

2051
02:39:16,360 --> 02:39:20,760
chance to or by the time they come out here i already forgot about them so because i have like

2052
02:39:20,760 --> 02:39:27,960
a really really short attention span um the bigger reason is probably because they did not bring out

2053
02:39:27,960 --> 02:39:33,800
or they are not bringing out the system in blue so i was able to get it in blue i knew i knew when

2054
02:39:33,800 --> 02:39:37,800
you said there was a crazy reason i was like it's because he got a blue one they don't have one yes

2055
02:39:37,800 --> 02:39:42,600
it's a very pretty blue so i'm okay with it what's like the color of my car it's a very nice blue

2056
02:39:42,600 --> 02:39:49,240
what if they announce at e3 that there will be a blue 3ds in the holidays oh well i already got

2057
02:39:49,240 --> 02:39:53,800
one i don't need a different well unless it's a different shade so considering that most people

2058
02:39:53,800 --> 02:39:57,640
haven't paid the premium to import a system from japan so most people haven't got their hands on it

2059
02:39:57,640 --> 02:40:03,160
yet oh and it's not also i've had japanese systems before so this is like nothing incredibly new for

2060
02:40:03,160 --> 02:40:08,200
me what are what should people know about the new 3ds is it worth it what are your thoughts on it

2061
02:40:08,200 --> 02:40:14,280
i think it's worth it i think it feels sturdier i love the head tracking um the little nub of a

2062
02:40:14,280 --> 02:40:19,720
c-stick is great i think it's really comfortable that i didn't like that at all yeah you're weird

2063
02:40:19,720 --> 02:40:26,280
um the shoulder buttons having four there is kind of cool too i don't find it cumbersome to pick

2064
02:40:26,280 --> 02:40:31,480
you know like put my fingers on there and find the right shoulder buttons um i think it's just

2065
02:40:31,480 --> 02:40:39,160
a nicer system that is the system yeah and the japanese one i never realized how much we were

2066
02:40:39,160 --> 02:40:45,960
missing out on like the e-shop until i got this system it's not even it's not even fair like it's

2067
02:40:45,960 --> 02:40:50,840
night and day they have so many good things on their e-shop i'm i'm a little jealous in that

2068
02:40:50,840 --> 02:40:55,800
regard but i still i don't know i kind of don't think the new 3ds is really worth it if you just

2069
02:40:55,800 --> 02:41:00,680
bought a 3ds but maybe you know if you've been holding out or whatever and you're still rocking

2070
02:41:00,680 --> 02:41:05,960
a regular ds or a dsi or something maybe now's the time to upgrade the new 3ds is definitely a

2071
02:41:05,960 --> 02:41:11,640
good replacement for that but yeah if you got one like over the holidays um i wouldn't say probably

2072
02:41:11,640 --> 02:41:16,840
you need to upgrade until a game comes out that says oh you can't use it on your 3ds you have to

2073
02:41:16,840 --> 02:41:20,600
have the new 3ds just waiting for that real quick before i let you go what did you think i don't

2074
02:41:20,600 --> 02:41:25,640
know if you heard the story earlier about the rumor that the video encryption technology in

2075
02:41:25,640 --> 02:41:32,360
the new 3ds is the same as what the wii u uses to stream to the wii u gamepad so folks are speculating

2076
02:41:32,360 --> 02:41:36,840
that the new 3ds will in fact be able to serve at some point as a wii u gamepad what do you

2077
02:41:36,840 --> 02:41:45,000
think of that um that makes sense to me i mean it's got the nfc chip inside too which you know

2078
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:52,840
for those stupid stupid amiibos um they do that on the wii u controller as well so it i thought

2079
02:41:52,840 --> 02:41:58,040
it was going to happen earlier than this but yeah it's totally gonna work with the wii u i don't see

2080
02:41:58,040 --> 02:42:03,560
it not working with the wii u not a fan of the amiibo huh no i want like four of them but they're

2081
02:42:03,560 --> 02:42:09,560
all two of them wait one of them is out now another one comes out like in a few weeks the

2082
02:42:09,560 --> 02:42:15,160
one that's out now is chic and i really would like that but i'm not waking up at four in the morning

2083
02:42:15,160 --> 02:42:19,800
the morning of to wait for a store to open i'd rather do that for something i care about more

2084
02:42:19,800 --> 02:42:24,600
yeah not some little dumb toy i'm not getting back into something like skylanders and that's

2085
02:42:24,600 --> 02:42:30,040
all this is but somehow worse all right well shane i should let you go so we can try to take

2093
02:43:07,720 --> 02:43:12,680
open by the way 1877 game olr or a username on skype orange lounge radio and i should mention

2094
02:43:12,680 --> 02:43:17,880
alan is cooking right now and it smells great here i'm freaking hungry it does smell good you

2095

2096
02:43:24,440 --> 02:43:28,840
to go out for cheesecake they have low carb cheesecake oh my god it's amazing low carb beans

2097
02:43:28,840 --> 02:43:33,240

2098
02:43:33,240 --> 02:43:37,400
red velvet then that's like the very the absolute worst thing you could possibly order on that whole

2099
02:43:37,400 --> 02:43:41,000
fucking menu i'll help you eat a bite of it yeah we'll see all right let's get to the phones hi

2100
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:45,960
you're on orange launch radio who's this hello oh my god is that marissa yes

2101
02:43:48,440 --> 02:43:51,560
how you doing i have nothing for doctor to say i just wanted to say hi

2102
02:43:53,240 --> 02:43:58,920
oh that's okay for you for you i will stop writing my fanfic you can you you can call in

2103
02:43:58,920 --> 02:44:03,640
and talk about whatever the hell you want you want to talk about the weather you you could probably

2104
02:44:03,640 --> 02:44:07,480
even get away with talking about the super bowl on the show and we wouldn't care gasp

2105
02:44:07,480 --> 02:44:13,400
okay but i still say that one of these days we're gonna have to do a spin-off on the voice

2106
02:44:13,400 --> 02:44:18,360
of games network to have robin morris's giggle time yes let's do it it's the voice it's the

2107
02:44:18,360 --> 02:44:22,920
voice of geeks network but that's okay the voice of giggling i'm sorry i bring my damage i'm

2108
02:44:22,920 --> 02:44:27,000
actually blonde don't tell anybody that's all right that's right well you know it was it

2109
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:30,520
originally well i i don't know how far it was i think some people know this by now i think it's

2110
02:44:30,520 --> 02:44:34,680
because originally it was going to be the voice of games network so you might have heard about it

2111
02:44:34,680 --> 02:44:39,880
when we were first planning it but then we we thought that wasn't inclusive enough of

2112
02:44:39,880 --> 02:44:44,840
all the shows we wanted to represent so we we expanded a little so there you go the definition

2113
02:44:44,840 --> 02:44:48,280
of vog changed before it launched i didn't remember that conversation a long time ago

2114
02:44:48,280 --> 02:44:55,400
but i'm also just blonde but thank you for trying to bail me out i really appreciate it i fucking

2115
02:44:55,400 --> 02:45:04,360
tried marissa i did for you i'm only here so i won't get fined well uh i'm sorry about uh

2116
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:09,400
you know a backstory i tried to get a guest on but they had a tragedy but if you're interested

2117
02:45:09,400 --> 02:45:14,760
i know we've gone back and forth but i got my vo friends and i know they would love to call in

2118
02:45:14,760 --> 02:45:18,760
if you're interested and i can uh i know we've talked back and forth about it casually but if

2119
02:45:18,760 --> 02:45:22,760
you're interested i'd be happy to have a whole bunch of fun people call in i think the listeners

2120
02:45:22,760 --> 02:45:27,000
would love to hear from some more people in the vo especially um you know some of the the favorite

2121
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:31,640
voices from some of the video games they play or i find i here's the thing with voice actors that

2122
02:45:31,640 --> 02:45:37,800
i think people like fucking love to find out is that you know obviously the voice actors that are

2123
02:45:37,800 --> 02:45:44,040
out there take on a lot of different projects so to find out that like somebody who did this voice

2124
02:45:44,040 --> 02:45:51,000
in this game is also this voice or this cartoon character from some beloved 80s or 90s cartoon

2125
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:55,720
is like a total trip i think i think people love to like see those connections at least i

2126
02:45:55,720 --> 02:46:02,280
do right maybe it is it is an amazingly um small world like um trying to give an example of one of

2127
02:46:02,280 --> 02:46:07,160
my friends it's kind of obscure but in dishonored one of the uh you know the the background i forget

2128
02:46:07,160 --> 02:46:13,000
the term for it um on the uh the propaganda that you hear that's guy named greg burger

2129
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:17,080
he's also eeyore and orson on garfield and friends who you're talking about yeah the

2130
02:46:17,080 --> 02:46:21,400
phone always surprises me is on the flip side like he was one of the raid ants you know right

2131
02:46:21,400 --> 02:46:27,240
like you know or rob paulson everybody knows who he is you find out what they've done commercials

2132
02:46:27,240 --> 02:46:32,520
he's your friendly hannah dealer you know so that's always it really surprises me because

2133
02:46:32,520 --> 02:46:37,000
you can see people and then like you know like i have an ear for jim cummings chris was playing um

2134
02:46:37,880 --> 02:46:41,720
at any any video game like i'll even like be listening to music and i go jim cummings

2135
02:46:42,280 --> 02:46:48,760
but uh um but when you hear the like the the voices that ambient stuff you just hear every

2136
02:46:48,760 --> 02:46:53,160
day too that can always be really shocking and they're all on screen all the time so they're

2137
02:46:53,160 --> 02:47:00,120
always really happy to talk to people no my gosh i just well i mean hell we talk to gamers we talk

2138
02:47:00,120 --> 02:47:05,640
i mean as long as people have some type of passion for video games whether it be the part of creating

2139
02:47:05,640 --> 02:47:09,400
them or the part of playing them you know it's a show where every gamer has a voice so i think we

2140
02:47:09,480 --> 02:47:13,560
want to i think we want to hear from lots of voice actors who help make those games um i know we're

2141
02:47:13,560 --> 02:47:17,560
going to be probably getting some bands on thanks to some of the connections i'm hopefully making

2142
02:47:17,560 --> 02:47:21,560
next week and you know some of the other stuff we've got brewing behind the scenes i i am all

2143
02:47:21,560 --> 02:47:26,280
for more interviews and talking to more people i think you guys like hearing them yeah yeah i

2144
02:47:26,280 --> 02:47:29,720
think you guys like hearing the interviews so i have a friend too that can also talk about he

2145
02:47:29,720 --> 02:47:37,000
does a lot of mocap and so that means that you're no longer allowed to be ugly so i'm like oh i

2146
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:41,960
don't have a figure of a supermodel now this mocap stuff shit well now a lot a lot of that

2147
02:47:41,960 --> 02:47:47,400
mocap stuff is like you wear that skin tight suit that has all the balls on it and the the mocap

2148
02:47:47,400 --> 02:47:53,960
stuff captures the balls but that's what it does yeah that's what he does yeah yeah i was having

2149
02:47:53,960 --> 02:47:59,480
a friend tell me about uh some some people that he knew that were mocapped for a sports game

2150
02:47:59,480 --> 02:48:03,400
uh for some of the not not one of the athletes but some of the background people and that was

2151
02:48:03,480 --> 02:48:08,520
the whole process that went through kind of neat so yeah it is crazy to watch the behind the scenes

2152
02:48:08,520 --> 02:48:13,960
of that all right well marissa um i look forward to trying to get some some peeps from your
