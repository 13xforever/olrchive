00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tonight, we interview the developer of Flom, an art game that pits old against new, modern against tradition, and an adventure through art history.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Join us for the exploration as well as the headlines from This Week in Gaming, along with your questions, comments, feedback, and more, right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this February the 22nd, 2015, the 588th episode of our show.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:58,000
My name is Rob Roberts, but you can find me on Twitter at Skie, here with you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-host.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I actually looked at my Twitter once.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Did you?

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Once.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah, you ended up floating more over to Tumblr than Twitter.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
There's a lot of social media out there. There's a lot.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The Tumblars are great.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Alan finally had to sit down and teach me how to use Snapchat, because I did not understand the interface at all, and I still think the interface is really terrible.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Isn't that the thing to swap-

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh, hi, TechMasterLoki, how are you?

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Sorry, isn't that the thing to swap nudes or something back and forth? Is that what that-

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I think they- well, here's the thing-

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No, that's where people send you dick pictures, and then you get to comment on them.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Here's the thing about Snapchat is I kind of think that's the CD underbelly, you know, the internet is for porn type of thing.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I mean, you can use email to send those types of pictures if you want, right?

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yeah, if you were in like 1996 or something like that.

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But I think that might have been how their business started.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Hey, back in the day it used to be really expensive to send pictures of your junk out to people.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But I think a lot of younger people use Snapchat. Not for that reason, because I'll be very, very, very wrong, although sadly there probably are a few.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
They should be ashamed.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Children don't do anything wrong.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I know, but here's the thing. I think a lot of like, especially at college and so forth, use it as like a blogging thing, because now they built this whole- I didn't even realize this existed until Alan explained it to me.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:18,000
There's a whole like, you can build a story. And so the snap videos that you take over a 24 hour period or whatever can all go into like a story.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Is that where you put like googly eyes on the penises and then like make little caption bubbles and stuff like that?

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I did see the thing going around on Tumblr where someone snapchatted like different people and then they started drawing over them.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yeah, that you can do that too.

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That might be a reason to get that, but no.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It is very silly, but I only bring that up because that's huge. Apparently that is huge. That app is worth millions and millions of dollars.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And I didn't understand it until a couple days ago, even though I tried to download it because some friends of mine were like, look me up on Snapchat.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And I couldn't figure it out until Alan was like, okay, you're going to tap this button and it's going to do that.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And then you're going to swipe right and it's going to do that.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You know your old win.

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
When you have to have someone to show you how to use an app.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Right? It threw me back to the days when I used to have to like explain to my dad how to call the BBS's that I was calling to download porn.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I mean, play door games. Play door games. Very important.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
All right. Anyhow, we're here with you guys every Sunday night live at the Voice of Geeks Network.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Which tapes Sunday nights at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Which I'll tell you a little more about his show a little later in the show because he had a really neat interview tonight.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'll tell you more about that later.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But yeah, you can tune in live. And if you are live, you should join our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And we do read comments from chat throughout the show.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And you can participate in the program, ask questions, have comments out there that we can throw out there on the discussions we're having.

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
On a lot of various game topics.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Tonight though, we're going to welcome to the show a friend of Dark Sakura's.

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Dark Sakura, perhaps you should do this introduction because you've been hyping this game on the show for the past few weeks.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And I always do this. So Dark Sakura, why don't you introduce our guest tonight?

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Hi. Okay. My voice just decided to fart on me.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I would like to introduce a very, very cool guy who was first met as my teacher. I did some intern work.

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I like how you're pointing to me on the radio.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Because.

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Because you're here live in the studio.

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
No one can see that.

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This is Steve.

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm going to take a picture of your hand.

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Just say hi.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Hello.

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Hello.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Wait, are you taking pictures over there?

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm taking pictures of her hand.

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Is that in Snapchat?

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah, it's going to go on Instagram.

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
On Instagram?

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
On Instagram, yeah. We're a little bit old.

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
No, there's nothing. Wait, Instagram is old? I think I missed that memo.

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Little old. Next big thing coming up next.

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
All right. Well, welcome to Orange Lawn Tradios, Steve.

75
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Oh, that came out like shit.

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Didn't he ask you, Dark Sakura, what should I expect on Orange Lawn Tradios? You say, well, we like to swear a lot.

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We say fuck a lot.

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay.

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That was, I think, what I said.

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
All right.

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Well, saying and doing. Go ahead.

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Speaking of apps, I want to give you ample opportunity to talk about why you're here and what this might have to do with gaming and so forth.

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And he's here because I lured him with food.

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Well, there's that.

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You lured me with food?

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Just get down here.

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But we want to talk about the app that Steve has had a huge...

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Oh, I'm sick of talking about the app.

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Oh, wait. I'm just talking about it now.

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's been a while.

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Well, we don't have to talk about it.

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's been a while.

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But then nobody knows about it.

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh, that's the hard part.

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Steve, you're the creator of a game that's available on iTunes and it's for the iPad and iPhone.

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Not Android yet, right?

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This is not available on Android yet?

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Not on Android.

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That's what I hear the most.

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah.

101
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And it's from our point of view, although everyone's argued with me about it.

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh, that's a good filter.

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
That is a really good filter.

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Okay.

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We're putting that on Instagram.

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It still looks bad.

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But the game is called Flom.

108
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's called Flom.

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Which is...

110
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's an interesting name because when first, I think Dark Sakura and one of her, I'm going

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
to say a random tangent moments at like the beginning of the show.

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I was like, what's up, Dark Sakura?

113
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And she goes, Flom!

114
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And I'm like, you made me flan?

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What?

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
This is a great name.

117
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What?

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That's a funny word.

119
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Flom.

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What is that?

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What does that title mean?

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Nothing.

123
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I love it.

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yes.

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You're an honest man, Steve.

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I love it.

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It was a nonsense word.

128
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I kept putting on Twitter because I wasn't sure what to do with Twitter when it first

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
came out.

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And I had a friend that I drove crazy by just typing the word flam every few days.

131
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Didn't it end up in one of your syllabuses once?

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I threw it in there too.

133
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yeah.

134
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Because I was teaching and that's a playground.

135
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Really.

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
So I just kept driving a friend crazy.

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The whole concept for this game started and then eventually I didn't know what to name

138
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
it.

139
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And I was like, what the hell?

140
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And since it is based on modern art, Dadaism, supposedly the legend was they just sort of

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
picked it at random from a dictionary.

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
So, what the hell?

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Here's this word.

144
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You can name it anything you wanted.

145
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Tell us a little bit about your background because Dark Sakura met you when you were

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
an instructor in one of her design classes, right?

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So your background isn't necessarily, you know, we talked to a lot of game designers

148
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,200
in game development, but we also really support here at OLR people like you and me and Loki

149
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,000
and Dark Sakura that want to create their own games, right?

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yeah.

151
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So tell us a little bit about your background.

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Not necessarily as a game designer, but your background is in book design and print design,

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
right?

154
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's everything else.

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,400
Well, my background in game design was I played them when I was a kid.

156
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,320
And I didn't realize what a different world it was until I watched Tron again, the original

157
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,020
one, and saw the arcade.

158
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,860
And I remember the arcades were so crowded.

159
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:05,200
We used to try to somehow get to the San Francisco airport in order to play the video games there

160
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,800
because there was no one playing them.

161
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,320
And you didn't have to have a ticket to get past screening back in the day.

162
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,320
No, you didn't.

163
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,840
You could just go hang out and watch the planes and they'd eventually throw you out because

164
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,200
you were a kid.

165
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:23,760
But you could actually, eventually when we got cars in high school, we'd drive out there

166
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,920
and basically pay for our parking by returning old baggage carts.

167
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,920
Oh, that's amazing.

168
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,880
It was a quarter each one.

169
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,960
What kind of games in the 80s do you remember?

170
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,960
What kind of games do you remember playing?

171
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,480
I remember blowing up shit.

172
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,920
And that's what I, you know, I grew up in the 70s.

173
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,560
We had car chases.

174
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,840
Bullet is one of my favorite films.

175
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,560
I used to watch it with my dad.

176
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,840
He's San Francisco mainstay.

177
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,840
Yeah.

178
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,400
You want to see San Francisco before the traffic, go watch Bullet.

179
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:57,440
And there was, what was it, The Driver, which was, someone look up the film, The Driver.

180
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,720
It's a great little film that no one knows about.

181
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,160
So I was fascinated with car chases, watching things blow up.

182
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,280
Eventually we had Knight Rider, we had Dukes of Hazzard.

183
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,000
And in the video games, you start seeing these metaphors.

184
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,600
I mean, Pong was originally tennis and then it started becoming alien invaders, space

185
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,760
battles and stuff.

186
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,520
And I was fascinated with the early stuff.

187
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,520
Pole position for racer.

188
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,480
I remember that was like an early, early racing.

189
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,480
It was pole position.

190
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,420
And then I don't know if you were still checking out arcades, maybe when things shifted a little

191
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,080
bit to like roadblasters, I remember was our early favorite.

192
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,680
They were closing eventually.

193
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,680
Yeah.

194
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,400
I remember they were in the malls and then things started closing.

195
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:43,060
I remember there was a jump to 50 cents a game and you would have to stand in line to

196
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,160
play each game.

197
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,420
You'd have to stack up quarters just to take over a game from someone.

198
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,300
So how did this all come together?

199
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,620
Because you mentioned that you've been wanting to do this game Flom for, I was reading in

200
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,460
some of the press and the website and so forth, that you've been wanting to put this game

201
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,900
together basically for five years.

202
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,900
It's been a process.

203
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,900
It's been a while.

204
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,920
High school plus one, if you think about it.

205
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:10,100
How did that come together where you say, okay, I remember these arcades and these games

206
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,820
I used to play because I love to blow shit up and we'd sneak into the airport where we're

207
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,400
not supposed to be there to play these old games.

208
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,060
And I have my love of design.

209
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:22,620
How did those two worlds collide, the design world and the game world?

210
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,740
Always looking for different things.

211
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:31,600
And I know the great John Kureka over at Rocketeer Games and he just sort of threw a little idea

212
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,600
at me regarding a game that he had sitting there that he wasn't doing much with.

213
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,240
And I just sort of went out and started designing stuff.

214
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,240
And I remember I even came up to him after six months and said, here's some of my ideas.

215
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,640
And he's like, what are you doing?

216
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:51,840
I had no idea that I was actually playing with something, but I wanted to do a little

217
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,800
shooter just like the ones I remember.

218
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,920
And I remember them being a lot different than what I see out there.

219
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,800
I've tried playing a new version of Asteroids.

220
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,640
It's just not the same without the black and white screen and the glowing stuff.

221
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:12,840
So that's interesting you bring that up because I noticed that the graphics in Flom kind of

222
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,040
take a, I don't want to say a simplistic approach because we're not talking about black

223
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,640
and white, but we're definitely talking about like, really, I mean, I'm just struck by like,

224
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,380
it's like moving art pieces kind of all coming together.

225
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,220
Where did that come from, the idea to do that?

226
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,220
It was a play.

227
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:34,320
One of the things I noticed, and this is where I first met Dark Sakura, I'm still working

228
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,320
on that because I know you as Jamie.

229
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,320
You can just call me Jamie.

230
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,320
Yeah.

231
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,040
And she was taking my history class, which is an hour and 20 minutes of stand up twice

232
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,760
a week.

233
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,700
And I was noticing as I got into the modern art movements, which I really enjoyed, that

234
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,440
there was some stuff going on in there that is tappable.

235
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,640
And one of the big connections was the De Stijl movement out of Holland, which most

236
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,640
people don't know about.

237
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,320
I even polled students to this day, what do you know about Holland?

238
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,960
And pretty much all they know today is wooden shoes, windmills, and Dutch Bros coffee.

239
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,960
And weed is legal.

240
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
Yes.

241
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,960
Weed is legal.

242
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,560
I know nobody wants to say that out loud.

243
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,560
Hookers and pot.

244
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,560
Hookers and pot.

245
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,560
Really?

246
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
Let's...

247
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
And now Colorado is our Holland.

248
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,560
Oh, that's right.

249
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,560
They don't have to go to Holland anymore.

250
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,560
Yeah.

251
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
Can you get hookers in Colorado?

252
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,560
Maybe.

253
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,560
Maybe in 2016.

254
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,560
Rob, you can get hookers anywhere.

255
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,560
Yeah.

256
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,560
Anyway.

257
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,800
I could go walk down the street and get a hooker.

258
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,800
Hold on.

259
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,320
We're trying to talk about a classy game here.

260
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,080
Don't be mucking it up with hookers and pot.

261
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,080
All right.

262
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,080
Wait, what neighborhood is this?

263
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,880
So I saw the connections, which they were doing things with lines, orthogonals, a lot

264
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,920
of things that looked like pixel art.

265
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,520
It reminded me a lot of Pong.

266
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,880
And it reminded me of how the early games were all low resolution.

267
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,160
There were all these 8-bit things.

268
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,000
And they were doing it with drafting paper and other tools.

269
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,680
So I started researching.

270
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,440
There was a movement tied to it, and that's what gave me the idea for a flom movement,

271
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,220
which is more Spinal Tap than anything else, which is I've created a fake art movement.

272
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,220
We have a manifesto.

273
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,000
We have all the stuff at the website.

274
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,980
And we'll see who bites onto that.

275
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:15,060
And then I started talking to other people about it and getting them interested in it.

276
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,900
And as I move forward, there's a big problem with Holland in that they're not big into

277
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,060
blowing things up.

278
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,760
You have to kind of go into other art movements.

279
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,780
And I made my way to Italy, which was the Futurists.

280
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,740
And the Futurists were all about violence and blowing things up.

281
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:36,700
So much, their best artists were lost in World War I.

282
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,440
Interesting.

283
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,400
So yeah.

284
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,080
And then it was research, research, research.

285
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,260
After that, lots of reading.

286
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,120
We have a bibliography at the website.

287
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,280
Oh, and where is the website for people who want to check it out?

288
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,280
It's flom.us.

289
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,280
F-L-O-M-M.us.

290
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,280
Flom.us.

291
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,600
And you can see much more about the game.

292
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,320
The game is available for $2.99 on iTunes.

293
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,040
Low price, just so you can play with it.

294
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,040
There it is.

295
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,660
And hopefully you sell enough of it so you can get the Android fans a piece of that too

296
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,660
at some point.

297
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,660
That would be next.

298
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,700
And other stuff.

299
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,700
And even at this point, it's been in development so long, I have ideas for other versions.

300
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,700
Flom 2.

301
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,700
Yeah, we don't have a lot of unlocking stuff in there.

302
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:22,060
But the idea was we just build it in a way that we could build alternate versions of

303
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,260
it with different looks.

304
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:28,780
Well, I noticed though, that there was still like some like you had different like vehicles,

305
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:32,820
like essentially, like, you know, if you're going to say straight up shooter, basically,

306
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,820
there's many different types of spaceships, but I feel weird calling it that because it's

307
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,900
not really what it what it is.

308
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,940
You have all these different types of like, modern art pieces that you can control in

309
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,940
the game, but some of them unlock right in the game.

310
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,140
It's that was just to keep you going.

311
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,020
And you can beat the game.

312
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:53,260
You just have you have to transform the villain into something modern.

313
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,780
And you do that by collecting power ups and just shooting him.

314
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,780
One of the concepts with just the overall look is what would it be like flying through

315
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,940
a Hannah Hawk collage?

316
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,380
And H O C H is the spelling of you want to look up her work.

317
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,380
And I do it with students.

318
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,020
She's one of my heroes too.

319
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,020
Yeah.

320
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,860
You look at that stuff and go, what if this stuff animated?

321
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,020
What if you were flying through stuff like this?

322
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,260
And then I started going farther and going, what if you're flying through a Kandinsky

323
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,260
painting?

324
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,740
What if you're flying through Cubism?

325
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,660
And it just, it became just a series of backgrounds.

326
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:32,780
I spent probably the first two years just making backgrounds and doing sketches.

327
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:36,020
And yeah, I noticed there's a lot of like little details in some of the art that's in

328
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,020
the game.

329
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,020
Like I, this instantly caught my eye.

330
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,220
I said the little bullets that my car, I think I picked a car to control the little bullets

331
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,940
that my car was shooting would say tat, tat, tat, tat, tat.

332
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,060
Like it, like it wasn't like I was throwing bullets.

333
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,060
I was throwing words.

334
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:50,180
I thought that was kind of neat.

335
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:56,820
Strangely enough, that happened later on because, because we took our time with this.

336
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,220
I was just sitting there one day and I was showing this to another graphic designer and

337
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:05,800
the bullets were more like a painting, little paints, paint blurs and stuff.

338
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:11,200
And I realized one of the big things on the list was Marinetti sound poetry.

339
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:17,380
Go back, look 1914, 1916, he was taking words and liberating them.

340
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:22,640
The Italian thing would be parole in liberta, liberated type.

341
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,460
And so this is actually a manifestation of what was sound poetry.

342
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,100
He was doing poetry based on noises.

343
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,060
And I was like, why not put the type in there?

344
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,860
And the, the font I had to use, I had to redraw it so you could actually read it while you're

345
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,860
playing the game.

346
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,860
That's awesome.

347
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,460
Um, I want to, uh, check in with our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com and if any

348
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,340
of you happen to have questions for Steve, uh, you can go ahead and put that out in the

349
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,340
chat room.

350
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,480
Although I think we all realize you guys may not have all tried the game yet because many

351
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,580
of you are probably just now really getting to hear what it's all about besides dark soccer.

352
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,580
Just saying, play it!

353
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,260
Uh, here on the show, uh, isn't my word not good enough?

354
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,420
Hey guys, you're hearing a little more about it.

355
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,060
We gotta do something else cause when you tell people to play things, they don't want

356
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,060
to play them.

357
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,260
So avoid it like the plague.

358
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,260
It will make you sick.

359
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,820
And I would love to show a video or something, but unfortunately it is Orange Lounge Radio

360
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,060
so I can't really show.

361
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,320
So I just have to urge people to go check out the website when they can, uh, to see

362
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,320
a little more about it.

363
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,260
I have put a few photos up though on my Facebook page.

364
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,260
There you go.

365
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,260
For screen captures.

366
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,420
So everybody friend Jamie on Facebook immediately.

367
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,420
Do it now.

368
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:29,900
Well, my, my fan page, but I also put a few up on, um, my Steam profile because I've uploaded

369
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,900
screenshots.

370
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,900
Nice.

371
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,620
We tried to do a trailer that actually looked like the game.

372
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,420
I thought we came close.

373
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,420
Okay.

374
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,060
I kept, I kept seeing trailers that didn't work.

375
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,780
In fact, uh, as, as we were building the trailer, the game was looking better than the trailer.

376
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,220
So, uh, we kept rethinking everything.

377
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,860
Well, let me ask this real quick and I don't, I don't wanna, I do want to get to some of

378
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,300
the other video games y'all been playing this week and some of what's going on in the industry

379
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,780
and we do talk a lot of big games this week, for example, you know, big AAA titles, we'll

380
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,900
get into talk about the order a little later in the show.

381
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,860
I'm sure people are dying to know what we thought about our, uh, you know, what's going

382
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,520
on with all the hubble around that game right now.

383
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,260
But here at OLR, you know, we like to support not just the big, big stuff everybody's heard

384
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,060
about, but you know, we've been really big and it's kind of been a theme for us almost

385
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:20,260
so far in 2015 about the fact that, you know, anybody can create things and you know, if

386
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,500
you want to do a game, go out and make a game.

387
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,340
You know, we were talking about that with the vog jam and when we had the cooking with

388
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,700
unity guys on last month and so forth.

389
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,820
And so, you know, now we have you here talking about this game that's on iTunes where you

390
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:38,900
had an idea and you went forth and now you are a game maker.

391
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,500
Tell us a little more about that process because I know you didn't do it alone.

392
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,260
How did you collaborate with others?

393
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:49,320
How did you come together for this common vision of flom?

394
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,960
It was talking to a lot of people and I don't just see it as a game.

395
00:18:53,960 --> 00:19:00,500
Part of my philosophy is figure out what you want to do and find some way to make it happen.

396
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,720
And I've been bringing up ideas of, because I've had people come back to me with this,

397
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,080
is okay, you have a game and you have sort of a fake art movement going on here.

398
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,620
Next thing would be shows.

399
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,920
Next thing would be bringing other artists into the fold.

400
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:17,040
And I've been talking to a bunch of people and trying to figure out what we could do

401
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,280
because the things do cost money.

402
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,580
But it's enjoy what you're doing.

403
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,240
That's what it's really about.

404
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,760
Now my background, which you started talking about, I've been a graphic designer for a

405
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,960
long time.

406
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,600
I've worked for corporations.

407
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,560
I've worked for, you name it, accountants, lawyers.

408
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,280
I've worked for everything you could possibly think of, bands.

409
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:45,140
In fact, I started stocking a band and that's how I got my musician.

410
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:49,820
I was listening to a lot of garbage and I got to know this wonderful band called The

411
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,820
Start.

412
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:55,420
They were playing nearby and I became friends with their drummer and she did the music for

413
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,700
the game.

414
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,700
And that was one of the plans even before I was doing a game that we should work on

415
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,700
something together.

416
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,700
Interesting.

417
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,860
So it's kind of like you, over the years in the interactions you've had with people, you

418
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,980
kind of, it sounds like you've kind of been keeping like a Rolodex a little bit in your

419
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,980
mind.

420
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,040
Like, I want to work with her on the music.

421
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,020
I want to work with him on the programming.

422
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:18,220
You've basically been assembling the Avengers for the past few years.

423
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,220
That's what it is.

424
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,220
You're Nick Fury.

425
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,220
Gnome who finished the game.

426
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,220
Nick Flommy.

427
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,220
You're Nick Flommy.

428
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,220
Yeah.

429
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,300
I have both eyes though, for now.

430
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:33,220
Gnome, who was the final programmer, is a superhero.

431
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,860
He brought a smoothness to the animation.

432
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,860
He brought some stuff in there that's so subtle that what's great was just telling him what

433
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,860
my vision was for everything.

434
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:47,160
And even when I say smoothness, the vision was to make it look like old animated stuff

435
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:53,020
from the 20s without getting so hokey that you just have a lot of dust and dirt on everything.

436
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:58,340
So those little details, he really understood and it did take us a while to get it together.

437
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,340
Just pulling it together.

438
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,500
But our projects will go on forever.

439
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,500
We know that.

440
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:08,100
YYR is in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com saying collaborations like that are so great.

441
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:13,200
And I know YYR is very similar to what you did where he's kind of like a single person

442
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:19,160
developing his own games, but I know he had a friend that did a lot of music that's helped

443
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,780
him out with some of the music stuff in like Snake 360 and some of the games that he did.

444
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:31,420
So that's great to hear just people that enjoy games who have all these different skills

445
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,420
coming together to assemble their own Avengers teams.

446
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,480
I think that's so neat.

447
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,360
I do want to move forward with some of the other stuff we have on deck for tonight's

448
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,360
show.

449
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,840
But Steve, one kind of last chance to pitch to our listeners, why should they go check

450
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,280
out Flom in the iTunes store right away?

451
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,460
Well, it goes a little bit farther.

452
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:55,340
It did grow out of education, which is, it's that little thing that no one wants to talk

453
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,340
about.

454
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:02,160
But one of my plans with the game was to bring an educational element to it.

455
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,120
Another thing I remember as a kid was we'd watch TV shows and we'd learn something from

456
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,800
them and they were a bit more heavy-handed about it.

457
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:14,300
So my approach to the game was everything in there relates to something that has existed

458
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,560
in art history.

459
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:22,080
And it became actually part of, I didn't finish it, but I was getting a master's in education.

460
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,000
And the game is based on using alter media to get people to learn stuff.

461
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,300
So if you're playing the game and you don't know what's in the background and you go looking

462
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,780
for it, chances are you're going to find something.

463
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:38,780
So if you're a gamer and an art history nerd, there definitely is something here for you.

464
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,580
This might help studying a lot better than just memorization.

465
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,460
And you know what?

466
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,720
Edutainment games are so important.

467
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,540
And we were just talking about this last week.

468
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,540
It had come up on the show.

469
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:52,540
We were reminiscing down the line about games that were educational.

470
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,640
And some of the games I remember in my youth, and I think a lot of people think about things

471
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,820
like Carmen Sandiego, Number Munchers, there were a lot of big, big ones.

472
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,860
Oregon Trail.

473
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,620
Of course, that's the one I think everybody knows, that one, the Oregon Trail.

474
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,020
I did some work for them too.

475
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:08,020
I had Oregon Trail all over my computer at one point.

476
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,880
That may have seeded this thinking.

477
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,880
Get out.

478
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,880
What did you do for Oregon Trail?

479
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,740
I did a whole bunch of marketing sell sheets for them.

480
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:20,120
And then I did like one of the, it was like a redrawing of a redrawing of Carmen Sandiego.

481
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,180
So purple and red everywhere.

482
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:27,140
You invited a guy that worked on Oregon Trail to this show and neglected to tell me?

483
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,140
Oops.

484
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,460
I worked on so many projects, I didn't even remember.

485
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,460
Oops.

486
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,460
Well.

487
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,260
Like I was paying attention in class.

488
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,260
I mean, oh, hi Steve.

489
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,020
No, I never came up, did it?

490
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,180
Now I'm in the presence of royalty.

491
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,180
I mean, but think about it.

492
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,180
Those games.

493
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,180
I wasn't on the main team.

494
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,780
This was more of a marketing side of things.

495
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,820
It's like you talk to the guy that did it though.

496
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,100
It's like the degrees are lessening, right?

497
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:56,580
So they had another thing called Nelly Nut that never premiered in the US.

498
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:59,620
And I don't know what happened to it, but I did all these materials for it.

499
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,620
Interesting.

500
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,620
Someone look it up.

501
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,620
I think I might have looked it up.

502
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,620
Something like that.

503
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,620
Did you do anything with Odell Lake?

504
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,620
Because a lot of the fans are there.

505
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,620
No.

506
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:11,780
I got sick of red and purple after a while.

507
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,700
There's a Nelly Nut TV, that was a 2003 TV show.

508
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,860
Yeah, well it was before that.

509
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,260
So I don't know what happened with it.

510
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:25,700
Well I did check out the game myself and you know, it's such a neat like style to it.

511
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:33,020
I think it's different than if I were to tell you, go download this shooter game on iOS.

512
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,420
You're going to have this perception in your mind of what that is.

513
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:40,880
But like Flom is different and it really is kind of like shooter meets this other world

514
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,880
over there.

515
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,140
So it's definitely worth visiting.

516
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,380
That was the hard part.

517
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:49,180
The only other thing I can pitch really quick is I've been on social media for a while.

518
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,180
Tumblr.

519
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,020
There are two Tumblr pages.

520
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,200
We have a music one now that's a spillover page.

521
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,600
But it started with the concept of modern art is the avant-garde.

522
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,140
And what does the avant-garde mean back then?

523
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,900
What does it meant since and what does it mean today?

524
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,240
So right now on just Flomis.

525
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
Just look for Flomis.

526
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,240
It comes up.

527
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,180
Flomis on Tumblr and Flomishin, which we do playlists every week.

528
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,420
Right now we're covering London Fashion Week because there's some really cool stuff coming

529
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:21,620
out of Europe right now.

530
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:26,400
It's about looking at design and art, not just the old stuff, but contemporary stuff.

531
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,940
And I hope to just keep going with this and see where it ends up.

532
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,940
All right.

533
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,940
Well, best of luck to you.

534
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,740
I did link them all in the chat room earlier.

535
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,740
Awesome.

536
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,020
But for the podcast listeners, since you don't have the links, we will link it in the show

537
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,380
notes of course over at vognetwork.com.

538
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,220
But again, the website's really easy to find.

539
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:45,260
It's just Flom, F-L-O-M-M dot U-S.

540
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,260
There you go.

541
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,260
And best of luck to you.

542
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,940
Steve, please feel free to stay throughout the show.

543
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,820
I know you don't play a lot of the modern games that we'll probably get into talking

544
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,940
about, but we love our retro stuff too.

545
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,580
Feel free to jump in with anything that you have to add, but if you have to go, I understand

546
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,580
that as well.

547
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,220
I always wonder why they walk off talk shows after a while, because you just sit in the

548
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,220
back room and stare at the wall.

549
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,620
That's when you go in the green room and eat the free food and drink the wine.

550
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,620
Sadly, this is a-

551
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,940
You just stuffed a chimichanga down my throat.

552
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,940
As I mentioned-

553
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,940
And that means something in art.

554
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,900
As I mentioned when you first got here off air, we're very much hobbyists here at OLR.

555
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,380
And it's, I was like, welcome to my house.

556
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,580
Here's the spare room that happens to be a studio.

557
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,580
All right.

558
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,580
Anyway.

559
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,420
YYR asked real quick, if there's time, can we ask if there'll be a demo?

560
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:35,540
YYR saying that a demo or a light version is usually very convincing on selling these.

561
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,200
Has that something you guys have given any thought to?

562
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,100
We're going to wait a little bit.

563
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,300
We had a temporary demo, it was a little bit clunky about a year ago.

564
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,900
And the fun thing, actually, I guess this was a good thing.

565
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,940
People were getting addicted to it, but we looked and said, no one's going to buy it

566
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,320
if they get so hooked on the demo.

567
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,580
So I do have one idea I haven't told anyone about yet, which is if we do have a demo,

568
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,460
it will be a pared down version of the game.

569
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,860
You won't be able to beat anything.

570
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:03,100
And the main boss will not show up for the game.

571
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:07,340
You're going to have his stand in, which is just sort of the middle manager in the game.

572
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:10,420
He just sort of shows up and he's not going to be much of a challenge and you get to blow

573
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,420
him up really quick.

574
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,420
Good.

575
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,140
Then Bobby will be able to complete the demo and buy the game that way.

576
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,180
There you go.

577
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,740
So basically you're going to put out a Bobby Black Wolf mode.

578
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,260
That's an inside joke here, I know you wouldn't understand, but you're going to put out a

579
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,260
Bobby Black Wolf mode as the demo.

580
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:29,620
Or to date myself, it's Johnny Carson when he had a guest host on Monday.

581
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,860
Let's see if anyone gets that.

582
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,860
I actually get it.

583
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,860
I do.

584
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,860
All right.

585
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,860
That's amazing.

586
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:40,620
That's actually kind of funny because Dan and I were just watching old Carson episodes

587
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,580
like two days ago.

588
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:47,820
YYR is suggesting have the main boss show up, fight for five seconds, and then it cuts

589
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,820
you off.

590
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,020
You guys, you guys may have to collaborate off of it in there and see, hold on.

591
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,020
Oh yeah.

592
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,020
There you go.

593
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:57,820
That's the Kanye just jumps in and says, nah, I'm going to let you finish if you buy the

594
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,820
game.

595
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,420
Well, that's another career girl goal.

596
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,420
I want to win.

597
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,860
I want to win a Grammy.

598
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:07,140
So when he comes up there, I'm going to start a fist fight.

599
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,140
It's a noble goal.

600
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,540
He's going to take me down, but I'm not going out with it.

601
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,540
Getting a few punches.

602
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,460
I have a feeling he won't be back.

603
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,420
Just call it, call it, call it a hunch, but I have a feeling he won't be back.

604
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,420
All right.

605
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:22,260
Anyway, we got to get into some of the other games going on besides just the floms in the

606
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,260
world.

607
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,860
We want to talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been

608
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,260
playing this week.

609
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,380
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

610
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,380
I played flom.

611
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,460
Why haven't the rest of you?

612
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,460
No.

613
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,460
I did.

614
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:38,900
I played actually a crap load of dragon age today because I'm about ready to wrap up my

615
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,900
fanfic.

616
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:45,620
Five chapters ahead again every time I, I've been double posting chapters every day this

617
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:49,020
week because the story is burning its way out of my brain.

618
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,960
Like it won't stop.

619
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,660
And hopefully this is going to give me my inspiration to actually sit down and work

620
00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:01,860
on my book because I have another book idea that I've been wanting to do for a while too.

621
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:09,620
I also got to play with somebody else's new 3DS and it's actually kind of comfortable

622
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,180
and I like the red one.

623
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:15,180
I understand why Shane imported a blue one because the blue one is very pretty and this

624
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,900
is Shane and it's a shame.

625
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,380
But I like the red one and I think I might want it.

626
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:29,620
However I did also finally sit down and play the Oregon Trail.

627
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,620
You know the Oregon Trail.

628
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,340
Oh, not the Oregon Trail, but the Oregon Trail.

629
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,340
Oh yes.

630
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,660
That's the, that's like the zombie one.

631
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,660
That's the riff on that.

632
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,660
Right?

633
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,660
Exactly.

634
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:44,500
We drove our station wagon through the mountains, stopped at a few malls, killed some zombies

635
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:50,420
and stole cans of food, and then everybody but me died.

636
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,140
The end.

637
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,780
Was this real life or was this a game?

638
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,900
Dot, dot, dot.

639
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,900
Dot, dot, dot.

640
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:00,140
Loki, how was your gaming week?

641
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:04,220
I played a little bit of Lego Marvel Super Heroes because my son wanted to play that

642
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,980
and I usually just play for a second.

643
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,540
I've been noticing, like I said, that game is glitchier and glitchier every time I play

644
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,540
it.

645
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,180
Mostly I worked on my game this week.

646
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:17,820
So I was trying to make a second level for it, but instead I ended up going back and

647
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,340
just kind of tweaking some of the gameplay stuff.

648
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:25,380
Like one of the things I had before was that the scale of everything makes the curbs a

649
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,500
little too high to actually just get over.

650
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,740
You can't just drive over them so that's why I added the jump in there in the first place.

651
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,260
So it's still a little bit difficult to get over them and my son is having trouble trying

652
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:39,380
to play the game and so I'm going to make all these curb ramp things so that you just

653
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,620
drive over them and it works just fine.

654
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,260
You need robot goats.

655
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:46,580
Hey, I can put it on the list.

656
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,580
Seriously, any idea.

657
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,300
I will draw you a robot goat.

658
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,140
I don't need a robot goat drawn.

659
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,220
I can do that.

660
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,220
I'm just saying.

661
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,220
I'm putting all-

662
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,340
Maybe she wants to draw you one as a present.

663
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,340
Fine.

664
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,860
It's fine.

665
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,500
But anyways, yeah.

666
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,500
I added more detail to it.

667
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,700
I was going to have a new video to upload but apparently my video was too epic for YouTube

668
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:13,620
to encode and so it's like, sorry, I can't encode this two gigabyte file that you're

669
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,620
trying.

670
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:19,220
It was an uncompressed AVI file that had like 60 frames per second, 1080p.

671
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:23,700
It's just like, you got to put some sort of compression on this thing because I can't

672
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,860
deal with it.

673
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,900
So yeah, unfortunately I couldn't upload that.

674
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,900
Hopefully soon.

675
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,780
But I got a lot of other stuff done.

676
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:36,060
I got my script to handle falling off the map so now it respawns you and everything

677
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:40,500
which is kind of cool and added more detail so it looks a little bit more polished.

678
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,180
So I'm just adding polish right now because the problem is I don't want to go back and

679
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:47,260
have to edit the map later on.

680
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:52,180
I just want to have that map being able to persist between levels so that's why I'm making

681
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,460
my fixes now and then I'll do the levels.

682
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,140
That and I haven't decided what I'm doing for level two yet.

683
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:02,100
Well, I got to have something easy to ease into everything so that people can kind of

684
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,980
understand the gameplay part because the first level is not really much of anything other

685
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,580
than falling through the map.

686
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,820
And so the first level has got to be kind of like, hey, here's how to play it a little

687
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,540
bit and then it's going to get fucking nuts.

688
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:19,300
But I have to have one level in between falling through the map and fucking nuts.

689
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,980
So you have to have your kind of super basic level.

690
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:26,920
Yeah, so I haven't figured out what broken thing I want to add to that yet.

691
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,920
So I haven't figured it.

692
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:32,660
And once I figure it out, then it'll be easy because I have a list like it's growing every

693
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:37,960
day and my son keeps bugging me about it because one of the ideas he wanted is like, you should

694
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:43,360
have mops on your car and you clean up stuff on the road.

695
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,320
I'm like, okay, so you just drive over it and it cleans up.

696
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,760
No, you should shoot the mops out the front of your car and it cleans up stuff.

697
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,280
I'm like, okay, I'm taking any idea you have and I'm putting it in the game.

698
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,720
I don't care how stupid it is.

699
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,720
It's going in there.

700
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,720
Everything.

701
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:03,520
And so it'll be fun, but I'm working on it.

702
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,520
All right.

703
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,520
Well, good luck.

704
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:09,480
It's not as easy as it sounds to make a game, that's for sure.

705
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:14,620
My gaming week, I played quite a few classics that I keep talking about here on the show

706
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:17,480
every week, like Diablo three continuing on with seasons.

707
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,080
I'm already paragon 50 for this season and climbing.

708
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,760
I have to ask you, since you brought up Diablo, sure.

709
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:37,520
Did you see that, nevermind, they did the Icewind Dale ultimate edition came out, re-released.

710
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,520
I didn't know if you'd be interested in that.

711
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,040
I was going to tell you about it, but I forgot.

712
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,040
So I interrupted you to tell you.

713
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,040
That's all right.

714
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,040
I'll have to check that out.

715
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,040
Okay.

716
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,040
Bye.

717
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,040
All right.

718
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,040
Bye.

719
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,040
You're leaving?

720
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,040
All right.

721
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,040
So still been playing Diablo three, working on seasons, logged into Final Fantasy 14 for

722
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,320
the first time in like three weeks the other night and I kind of missed it and I hadn't

723
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,600
really been doing the new content.

724
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,360
So I finally was like, all right, time to suck it up and do this Ampedor keep hard mode.

725
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,860
And it was actually a really fun dungeon.

726
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,240
So I enjoyed that.

727
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,280
I've been playing other standbys on consoles as well.

728
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:07,920
Like I had a friend over earlier today and we were playing some stuff on the Wii U because

729
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:13,360
we use a great living room console to play Mario Kart eight and super smash brothers,

730
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,960
of course, which I feel like I'm getting a little better at smash brothers.

731
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,960
Thank God.

732
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,360
Because I was, I was really worried there for a minute.

733
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,960
I love that video that you put out, the realistic clapping.

734
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,960
The what?

735
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,960
Have you ever seen that?

736
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,600
The realistic clapping in Smash Brothers?

737
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,880
Oh, I saw a link to it, but I didn't watch it.

738
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,880
What is it?

739
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,560
It's like, it's just basically someone adding fully sounds to the clapping.

740
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,800
Cause a lot of it, you know, if you watch it, how they actually clap, it's really stupid.

741
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,640
But like some of them are really funny, like Donkey Kong, because there's like, it's like,

742
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,640
it's just really silly.

743
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,640
Okay.

744
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,640
Yeah.

745
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,640
Like at the end of the match, some of the clapping is really silly.

746
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,640
Okay.

747
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,640
I gotcha.

748
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,640
I gotcha.

749
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:48,640
Um, let's see.

750
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,360
So, uh, there was, um, that, and then we were speaking of living room games, we were playing

751
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,200
Jackbox Party Pack, which is always a good time.

752
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,080
And, uh, I, I literally cried from laughing so hard at one of Alan's drawings.

753
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
I loved it so much.

754
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,880
I put it on my Twitter over at twitter.com slash sky, S K I E.

755
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,600
You have to see it and I've submitted it as evidence for why Alan is the best drawful

756
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,600
player in the world.

757
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:15,200
Uh, so hopefully you'll check that out at some point, um, new stuff though, I did actually

758
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,200
play some new games.

759
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,880
I'll talk about these very quickly.

760
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,600
Um, I played Pokemon shuffle on the 3DS.

761
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,920
I have a full review that's going to go up to vog network probably tomorrow, Monday,

762
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,920
uh, which I wrote out just because I had a lot of very strong feelings about the game.

763
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,560
So I just kind of wanted to get it all out, uh, and write it out.

764
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,200
So I don't necessarily want to spoil all of it, but I will say this much.

765
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,000
Um, it is a free game.

766
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,600
And so when a game is free, you have to really kinda, you know, you have to go, okay, well

767
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,200
at the end of the day, it's free.

768
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,800
So even if it's a bad game, it's still free.

769
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,800
Yars.

770
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,800
Huh?

771
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
That's true.

772
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,200
I would say Pokemon shuffle is still better than Yaris.

773
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,200
I'll give it that.

774
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,440
But I would say being kicked in the crotch is better than Yaris.

775
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:07,160
My biggest problem with Pokemon shuffle is that the game, the balance of the 99 cent

776
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,400
jewels that you buy on the Nintendo network and what those jewels actually buy you in

777
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,600
the game is a little bit off to me.

778
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:20,200
And mostly, and most importantly at the end of the day, here's where I believe Nintendo's

779
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,760
biggest problem is with this and, and some of the Nintendo fanboys are going to want

780
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,700
to fight me on this, but really think this one out guys, because this is what really

781
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,660
bothers me about Pokemon shuffle.

782
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:35,460
So Pokemon shuffle is kind of trying to be like a Facebook or a mobile game type of experience.

783
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,760
Like that's the free to play game, right?

784
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:43,120
It's trying to be the Facebook or free mobile game game that's available on your 3DS instead,

785
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,120
right?

786
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,960
Because Nintendo doesn't really want to make stuff for mobile.

787
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,800
So they're making, I guess, these more mobile and free experiences that are available on

788
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,300
the 3DS.

789
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:56,600
But the problem and what's missing is that on Facebook, like what's huge on Facebook

790
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,740
and mobile right now, like trivia crack, right?

791
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,740
Is like a big one.

792
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,360
There's a lot of people playing that on Facebook and a lot of people playing that on mobile.

793
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,940
Why do we play trivia crack?

794
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:08,800
We are signing into trivia crack so we can play against our friends and compete with

795
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,920
our friends.

796
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,680
And when we beat our friends in a match, we go, ha ha, I beat you and oh, wasn't that

797
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,920
question funny and you're trying to work your way up the leaderboards and all this

798
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,920
stuff, right?

799
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:24,480
Pokemon shuffle is a social media game with no social interaction.

800
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,520
Now some, you know, people that maybe have gotten more enjoyment out of it than I did

801
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,080
might say, but Rob, you're forgetting about street passes.

802
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:35,940
You can street pass people and you'll get their little card and it tells you, you know,

803
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,720
about themselves and so forth.

804
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,980
Eh, I say it's a really weak implementation that's next to nothing.

805
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:46,700
All it tells you is this is how many Pokemon they've collected, eh.

806
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:51,660
And like when you play Pokemon X and Y or white and black, ruby, sapphire, whatever

807
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,180
it is, you're collecting the Pokemon.

808
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,380
You might give them your own names.

809
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,980
You're going to customize their abilities.

810
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,820
You start to, you start to breed the Pokemon at some point, right?

811
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:05,260
So you start to feel a little more connection to this collection you're making.

812
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,180
Pokemon shuffle, eh eh.

813
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:12,220
You fight this particular Pokemon and there's a 40% chance you're going to catch it.

814
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:18,620
Ubi, you can increase that to a 70% chance if you buy a great ball for 2,500 coins.

815
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,740
Oh, you're out of coins?

816
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:26,220
Why don't you spend a 99 cent jewel on more coins to up your chances of collecting this

817
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:33,580
Pokemon that at the end of the day will increase the number on your street pass card by one?

818
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:40,060
So my issue with Pokemon shuffle is that as fun as a puzzler as it is for the 15 minutes

819
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:44,620
you play it before you run out of energy, there's no point to the game.

820
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,540
There's no point to the game.

821
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:52,040
So that was, that was where I got lost a little bit on Pokemon shuffle.

822
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,400
But for the 15 minutes you play it, it's a fun little puzzler game.

823
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,120
So I didn't give the game an F, but I didn't exactly give it an A either.

824
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,420
So anyway, there's that, Pokemon shuffle.

825
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,580
One other game I'm going to talk about, and I hate to be so negative, usually I'm so positive

826
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,580
on games.

827
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:10,500
There's so many great games out there, but what, let it go.

828
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:16,180
I can't let this one go because this game that I played was bad and I was really disappointed

829
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,080
because it was a game I was looking forward to.

830
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,740
We talked about it a couple of weeks ago on the show and I was like, they're making this

831
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,740
game.

832
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:26,580
They're going to remake Qbert for the PlayStation four.

833
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:30,540
It's not good.

834
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:37,480
And I hate to say it because I'm a fan of Qbert, but I'm not a fan of Qbert Reloaded.

835
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,980
When you play the game on PlayStation four, you can play classic Qbert.

836
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:46,580
And actually, funny enough, where the game is best is when you're just doing the classic,

837
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:49,840
you know, arcade board emulation, whatever.

838
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,980
If that's all you want out of Qbert on PlayStation four, then cool.

839
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,980
You're going to get it.

840
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:56,220
But yes, then there's this new mode as well.

841
00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:00,700
It's the Qbert Reloaded where, yes, they've switched things to now it's a hexagonal board

842
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,580
and I'm okay with that.

843
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:09,740
I'm okay with the switch to a hexagonal board if it controlled well, but it doesn't.

844
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,860
And the game really dies on its controls.

845
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:20,060
I have never seen a game where the controls were like the reason why it sank.

846
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:23,760
And I think for me, the controls in Qbert Reloaded, awful.

847
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,520
And it's just, the old Qbert game from the 80s really snaps.

848
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,120
You know, I think that was the thing about it.

849
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,520
Yeah, it has the joystick that's in the four angular directions.

850
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,520
It's you know, upright, up left, down left, you know, that whole thing.

851
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,180
But it really snaps when you play it.

852
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,800
And I noticed that when playing in the classic mode.

853
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:46,240
But when you're playing in this hexagonal new Qbert mode, it's not just the fact that

854
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,280
they made them six sided squares.

855
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,580
That I can deal with.

856
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,880
But the fact is that Qbert doesn't snap.

857
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:56,400
He kind of slogs.

858
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,440
You have to probably get your hands on it and play it yourself, which I'm actually not

859
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,660
recommending you do.

860
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:04,480
But if you really go look at a YouTube or something and look at how he moves.

861
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,760
And it's just so different.

862
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,960
And it just feels cheap.

863
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,940
Especially for like a PlayStation 4 game, it feels cheap.

864
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,820
And I'm okay with retro and classic things.

865
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:19,920
But when I'm looking at this game going, didn't they have a Qbert on PlayStation 1 that was

866
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,960
more fun than this?

867
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,680
There was a Qbert on ColecoVision that was really fun.

868
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:28,400
There was a Qbert on PlayStation 1 that was like a Qbert reimagined or whatever that was

869
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,400
better than this.

870
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,400
And I hate to say it.

871
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,640
Yeah, I do remember that.

872
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,880
I know that there's people that worked hard on this game.

873
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,280
And I don't like giving games bad reviews for that.

874
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:43,600
But I'm sorry, I have a responsibility to say that this game just it's not it wasn't

875
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,300
it's only worth it to play the classic Qbert game.

876
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,360
Just I wouldn't even really touch the new one.

877
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:53,560
It's it's I can't I sat there the other night trying to move around the board.

878
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,080
And I just fell off the board repeatedly fell off the board.

879
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:01,400
It'd be nice if maybe I could re customize the controls or something maybe make the buttons

880
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,400
hopper.

881
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,220
I don't even know if that would fix it, though.

882
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:08,400
And then you saw that video I uploaded right where the little springy guy was his name

883
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,920
Clyde is name quietly, which was chasing you down the thing, right.

884
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:17,020
So you the trick is you go to a flying disk to get away from quietly right.

885
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:21,640
So here's the thing, quietly grabs me right as I'm about to get on the disk.

886
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,120
So I die.

887
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,580
But I die as I'm falling on the disk.

888
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:29,540
And the disk takes my dead body to the top of the grid, and then drops me on the top

889
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,540
of the grid.

890
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,540
That's awesome.

891
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,820
So now not only am I dead, but I burned the disk.

892
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,100
That's still really funny.

893
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:40,700
And I'm not sure if it's because it's a heart meter now instead of just I was like the hell

894
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,700
just happened.

895
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,080
I just I didn't like it.

896
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,200
It's not funny when you're playing it.

897
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,200
I know that.

898
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,200
No.

899
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:52,160
It's a part of Qbert's corpse lying, you know, desiccating on this disk as it's floating

900
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,880
to heaven.

901
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,320
Okay.

902
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,320
That's really funny.

903
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:02,200
I would commission art of that continues in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,

904
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,400
why would anyone remake Qbert?

905
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,960
It's hard to remake a classic game, right?

906
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,160
Like, but some of them are done really well.

907
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:16,160
And I would say Pac-Man, not only Pac-Man versus but Pac-Man.

908
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,120
Why can't I?

909
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,120
Pac-Man CE.

910
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,120
Yeah.

911
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,120
Yeah.

912
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,120
Championship edition thing.

913
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,120
Thank you.

914
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,120
Why can't I?

915
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,120
DX especially is so good.

916
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,400
Like that's a great reboot of a classic game.

917
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:33,080
And I would say, well, if you can reinvent a classic game like that, then that's a, that's

918
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,840
a note of how you do it really.

919
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,200
But this is not, you know, it's just not.

920
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:43,280
And I think, I think Qbert is a classic game that a lot of people really forget about.

921
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,160
I think it was a really cool game.

922
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,840
There was actually a proper sequel to Qbert called Qbert's Cubes.

923
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:53,880
But I bet nobody really knows the game unless maybe you found it randomly on a mayhem emulator

924
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,880
somewhere.

925
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,520
It wasn't a, it wasn't a very big, big deal.

926
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,520
So anyway.

927
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,120
It wasn't really that good of a game either.

928
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,200
Tigerclaw in chat says, could be worse.

929
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,440
What if they remake Dig Dug?

930
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,440
They did.

931
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,320
They did do a Dig Dug on Xbox 360, didn't they?

932
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,240
Yeah, because they had all these different versions.

933
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:17,240
They did Dig Dug and they also did Rally, whatever the other Rally game was.

934
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:22,680
All they really did to Dig Dug, all they really did was it was the same game with high definition

935
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,680
graphics.

936
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,240
But like, it was like, you were still running like the same ROM.

937
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,160
It was just like a prettier graphic overlay on top of it.

938
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,840
So, and that was, that was okay because they only charged $5 for it too.

939
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,040
And it was, it was fine.

940
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,360
I, well, I played that one.

941
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,480
It was part of one of those comp, the Namco compilations that they had.

942
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,760
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

943
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,800
There was one in the arcades in the nineties that was pretty good too, that I actually

944
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,800
really liked.

945
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,800
So.

946
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,840
Oh, Act Deft naming another classic reinvention that was really good.

947
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,560
Space Invaders Extreme was extremely fun.

948
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,560
That's right.

949
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,400
That was a frickin rad game.

950
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,600
So yeah, classic game reinventions can be done right, but I can also understand the

951
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,800
hesitation a lot.

952
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,520
Qbert is not the first to be done poorly.

953
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,800
So there you go.

954
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:08,440
Anyway, all right, let's get on to, let's get on to some other news instead of just

955
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,440
our gaming week.

956
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,320
Let's get into what has been going on around the video game world this week.

957
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,160
Quickly, some housekeeping.

958
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:19,560
We will be here next week on March 1st, but we will not be here on March 8th.

959
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:24,400
That is because I am going with Bobby Blackwolf and some of our listeners.

960
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,640
PAX East is where I'm going to be.

961
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,720
So I'm looking forward to seeing you guys all around the show.

962
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,160
I imagine it's going to be a pretty crazy crowd.

963
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,400
I'm going there as a fan just like anybody else.

964
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,560
So I'll probably be trying to get some hands on with any classic games that they have there.

965
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,600
If there's Qbert there, the classic version on the ColecoVision, I'll probably be there

966
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:45,600
playing it.

967
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,880
So I remember the first time I went to PAX East, they had a really great little classic

968
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,880
game room.

969
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,920
So I hope to check that out.

970
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,120
Please, if I don't have the VOG shirt on, I'm sure Bobby will.

971
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,880
So if you see one of us at the show, please, please pull us over and say hello.

972
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,400
We'd love to say hi and meet you and talk to you.

973
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,280
And yeah, don't be shy.

974
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,560
We're gamers just like you.

975
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,920
So we'll be around.

976
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,320
And whatever else they show.

977
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,280
Final Fantasy XIV is having a panel at PAX East.

978
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,600
So I personally can't wait to go and check that out.

979
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,560
So we will be there at PAX East.

980
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:19,920
Speaking of Bobby, I mentioned earlier in the show that he had a pretty cool show tonight.

981
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,320
And I promised I would give this a shout out here on OLR and I want to make good on that.

982
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:28,360
Bobby had a Kickstarter campaign on his show tonight.

983
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:35,240
And it's for a, it's not really a game, but it's a virtual reality rock opera.

984
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,720
And they described it as Fantasia meets Tron.

985
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:42,520
And I was kind of like, that is awesome meets awesomer.

986
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,240
So I was a fan of this.

987
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,520
This was Nurin, the New Renaissance is the name of the project.

988
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,080
And you can find that over on Kickstarter.

989
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:54,680
If you need the link, it'll be over on vognetwork.com and Bobby's latest show notes.

990
00:46:54,680 --> 00:47:00,480
But one of the guys behind this happens to be Vert, who's a pretty well-known composer

991
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,480
these days.

992
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,640
You know, did you happen to play the Ducktales remastered?

993
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,840
Did you play that in the soundtrack to that game?

994
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,040
Yeah, that was Vert.

995
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:13,920
So Vert, along with Jesse Seeley, who are behind this game, the core team that make

996
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,240
up this experience, they were both on Bobby's show tonight.

997
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,280
And it was a great interview and a great listen.

998
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,120
So I wanted to, I promise, because Vert actually came into the chat room and was chatting with

999
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,680
folks during Bobby's show.

1000
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,000
So I promised Vert I would give it a shout out here on OLR.

1001
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:34,600
So shout out Nurin over on Kickstarter, N-U-R-E-N, $15 will back the experience.

1002
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,560
And the soundtrack.

1003
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:38,680
And I was like, you know what, if nothing else, that soundtrack is going to rule.

1004
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:42,640
They actually played a little bit of it on Bobby's show, and it was awesome.

1005
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,640
So there you go.

1006
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:44,640
All right.

1007
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,640
That's our housekeeping.

1008
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,600
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

1009
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:52,960
We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, and google.com slash

1010
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,440
plus orange lounge radio.

1011
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,320
Let's get into some news.

1012
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:01,080
There's a bit more going on this week than there was in previous weeks.

1013
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,480
Some big topics we got to get into tonight, right, Loki?

1014
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:09,360
Yeah, so everybody wants to know, why can't you just find amiibos out in the stores?

1015
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:15,640
Well, apparently, according to the president of Nintendo, they're blaming the labor strike

1016
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,640
that apparently is going on in the US.

1017
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,880
They're saying that for the last six months, labor negotiations on the west coast of the

1018
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:29,620
United States have made getting goods to shore slow, as the amount of berths open are lower

1019
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:32,560
than usual, and therefore harbors are congested.

1020
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:37,240
Many of the goods sent to the US have not arrived to their destination, however, this

1021
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:41,800
had little effect on amiibos and software sales, as they are light enough that we can

1022
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,340
even ship by air, if we have to.

1023
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:51,160
Even though the new Nintendo DS has had a handicap against its supply, the public has

1024
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,940
still shown huge interest in it, and its sales are phenomenal.

1025
00:48:54,940 --> 00:49:02,660
So they're blaming that as the reason why you're not able to find them in the United

1026
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:03,660
States.

1027
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:05,180
No, there's that one guy buying them all.

1028
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:11,300
I just, I don't believe that that's all the case, and he even kind of goes back and saying,

1029
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:15,900
well, true, this is holding things up, however, they're actually light enough that we can

1030
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:21,220
ship them by air, so he kind of goes back on his excuse.

1031
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:23,180
This is an awfully convenient excuse kind of thing?

1032
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,180
Yeah.

1033
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:28,500
I'm willing to hear it out a little bit, like, okay, like, you know, the 3DS, especially

1034
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:32,860
in the case of the new 3DSs, I feel like the amiibo thing's been going on longer than the

1035
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:37,100
Port Strike, so I'm not, I don't know how much I buy it there.

1036
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:43,100
But with the new 3DSs, demand for that does seem to be a lot higher than, like, it's not

1037
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:47,980
even so much the Monster Hunter system and the Majora's Mask system, because those sold

1038
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:51,260
out within seconds, right, and that was way before, those were the preorders when there

1039
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:53,500
was no Port Strike or whatever thing going on.

1040
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:56,940
We're talking about, it's even hard right now to find just the plain red systems and

1041
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:00,820
the, what other color is there, red and black, something like that.

1042
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:04,260
They're just, I'm not really interested in buying one right now, so that's why I haven't

1043
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:05,260
tried to run out and find one.

1044
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:10,300
I don't know why they're so popular right now when there's nothing exclusive for them.

1045
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:14,980
I can't figure it out either, to be honest, and I have a lot of friends that are buying

1046
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:17,700
them, and I don't mean to, like, well, I do, I should do this.

1047
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,980
I understand that, like, you get them for the future and stuff, but.

1048
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:25,780
And I know a lot of people that are buying them because they haven't bought a DS since

1049
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:29,860
either the original 3DS or even further back than that.

1050
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,980
So that I get, I get, I totally get that, because, like, if you're new to the XL thing

1051
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:39,300
as well, then okay, yeah, there's a lot of new stuff, but I'm just like, otherwise, I

1052
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,940
don't know why.

1053
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:45,420
Maybe it's the Majora's Mask or the Monster Hunter thing, like, you know, to be fair,

1054
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:50,500
to be fair, I had a 3DS, and when they put out that Zelda one, the Triforce one, I had

1055
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:51,500
to have it.

1056
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,780
So I sold my old one and bought the 3DS with the Zelda sound.

1057
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:58,260
I don't know, if you want Majora's Mask on the outside, just buy a sticker or some shit

1058
00:50:58,260 --> 00:50:59,260
for it.

1059
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,260
I don't understand why it's there.

1060
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:01,900
But it's not official that way!

1061
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:04,980
Who gives a fuck if it's official or not?

1062
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,940
I can't show off to all my gamer friends!

1063
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:10,660
Yeah, ooh, look at, I got this 3DS that everyone else has.

1064
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:14,000
Yeah, I just, I don't get it, but whatever.

1065
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,940
And then also, the other thing is, there, I think we talked about how there's gonna

1066
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:23,060
be some exclusive amiibos, you know, they're gonna be doing like a silver and gold Mario

1067
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,060
and stuff like that.

1068
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:30,740
Well, apparently the gold Mario is gonna be exclusive for Walmart, and it's gonna be offered

1069
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:37,940
around Easter time, which is also when Mario Party 10 apparently is coming out, but I just

1070
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:39,020
don't get it.

1071
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:43,960
If you paint it gold, then all of a sudden people are gonna go batshit crazy for it because

1072
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:46,180
it's slightly different than something else.

1073
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:53,260
Okay, cool, I guess, you know, that's important to you.

1074
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:57,660
It's just the little, and the other thing is that I think that, isn't it like for these

1075
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,620
supposedly limited edition things?

1076
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:05,020
Yeah, well, they've done that, they did like crystal figures and stuff like that in Disney

1077
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:09,660
Infinity, and I know they have variants in Skylanders as well.

1078
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:14,980
The only thing I have to ask is, are they gonna show up as gold and silver in the game,

1079
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:20,980
because that's how they are in, you know, Disney Infinity and Skylanders, is they actually

1080
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:25,580
show up in their variants in those games, so it kind of, you know, behooves you a little

1081
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:29,780
bit to buy these limited editions, because at least it shows up differently.

1082
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:34,740
If it's just seriously just a paint job, and it's just gonna show up as a regular Mario

1083
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:37,820
when you hook it up to the game, then it's kind of stupid.

1084
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:41,940
Well, see, that was what I was wondering about, is like, if there are like any legit perks

1085
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:46,020
to having them, other than them just being, ooh, sparkles.

1086
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:47,020
I don't know.

1087
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:50,260
I mean, cool, I guess.

1088
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:55,680
Mario Party 10 comes out on March 20th, apparently, on the Wii U, so I guess we'll find out when

1089
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:56,740
that comes out.

1090
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:59,060
But no word on the silver one yet, right?

1091
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:00,820
No word on the silver one yet.

1092
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:05,420
Yeah, Act After Chat is noting that there's also a silver Mario coming out, but we don't

1093
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:06,420
know.

1094
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:10,020
Yeah, it's probably, if I would guess, usually the big players and that kind of stuff, it's

1095
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:16,060
either gonna be Toys R Us or GameStop, probably.

1096
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:19,620
Some folks in chat talking about the 3DS, and kind of responding to what I was saying

1097
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:25,020
a little bit ago about the, you know, why did you get a new 3DS, continues in chat,

1098
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:27,940
says, Xenoblade Chronicle, more people will get to play it.

1099
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:31,620
True, but it isn't out yet, you know, and it will be out, but.

1100
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:35,700
And just think about it, too, you're like, oh, I bought a new 3DS for Xenoblade Chronicles,

1101
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:41,380
but what if they put out a special Xenoblade Chronicles new 3DS when that comes out?

1102
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:43,140
See, that's what I'm afraid of.

1103
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:48,060
And you know that there's still at least one or two more Nintendo Directs before that comes

1104
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:49,060
out, so.

1105
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,060
Good thinking, good thinking.

1106
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:53,100
I'm, you know, I wouldn't doubt that they're gonna do something like that.

1107
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,380
Let's see, Act F saying, a lot of people were worried that those gold and silver Mario were

1108
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:00,380
Club Nintendo Elite rewards, despite Nintendo stating that all Elite rewards were gonna

1109
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:03,740
be digital games, but, you know, people were still worried.

1110
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:08,220
AkumaJP saying, sorry to say, impulse buy, I got the Zelda new 3DS.

1111
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:10,020
Hey, you know what?

1112
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:12,340
I am not one to tell you how to spend your money.

1113
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:15,740
You earn your hard-earned money, you spend it on whatever the hell you want, but I can

1114
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:21,620
just sit here and say, for me, I don't really understand why, but at the same time, I have

1115
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:28,420
Mass Effect 3 on PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U.

1116
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:33,020
And people go, you are stupid, and I go, here's my middle finger.

1117
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,260
So, it's what I like.

1118
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:36,900
What's more surprising is that I don't have all this.

1119
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,900
And how often do you play Mass Effect 3 on-

1120
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:40,900
Yeah, Rob.

1121
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:45,060
Any more, it's very rare, but I still think the multiplayer is still really good, but

1122
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:47,300
to be fair, multiplayer is really PC, if anything.

1123
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:48,940
So, have you finished it on Wii U?

1124
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,900
I didn't play it start to finish on Wii U, but I had to see how the comic was.

1125
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:55,180
Remember, it was only like 18 bucks, and I bought it on Wii U.

1126
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:59,500
That was more of a collector's thing at that point, you know?

1127
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:03,540
Are you grilling everybody that's spending $12 on little amiibo figures?

1128
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,020
Do you give them the third degree, Loki?

1129
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:06,020
I would.

1130
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:07,020
I just silently judge them.

1131
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:08,180
Why are you buying that?

1132
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,540
I don't understand why you'd buy that.

1133
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:10,540
It does nothing.

1134
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:11,540
Because they're cute.

1135
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:12,540
They're cute.

1136
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:13,540
They're not cute.

1137
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:14,540
They're statues, and they don't even move.

1138
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:18,020
Let's see, the SEG in chat asks- Hi, SEG.

1139
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,020
Question.

1140
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:24,180
Is there any feature advantage to getting a Wii U when I have a 3DS XL, beyond using

1141
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:26,460
the 3DS as a controller in Smash Brothers?

1142
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:31,380
So, I'm assuming, is there any more, like, synergy things between the two systems?

1143
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:34,940
Because obviously, my obvious answer would be, well, you can't play Mario 8 on the new

1144
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:35,940
3DS.

1145
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:36,940
Amiibo support.

1146
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:37,940
Yeah, amiibo support.

1147
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:40,500
I would imagine that there's probably stuff that they haven't talked about yet that they're

1148
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:45,580
gonna do with it, unless they come out with yet another new, new 3DS.

1149
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:50,180
I would think that, remember, there was the rumor a couple months ago, that makes an awful

1150
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:55,580
lot of sense, that the streaming technology that's built into that new 3DS matches what's

1151
00:55:55,580 --> 00:56:00,540
in the Wii U, so someday, they'll probably be able to be Wii U game pads, and I wouldn't

1152
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,980
doubt at all that that would end up being true.

1153
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:04,980
Yeah, the problem is, though, is that the Wii, I understand that they could be Wii U-

1154
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:05,980
But that's not announced yet.

1155
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:06,980
I understand.

1156
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:07,980
Just to be clear.

1157
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:12,620
They could be Wii U, you know, game pads, but the problem is that the Wii U can't, I

1158
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:16,900
don't think, can handle more than one stream, which is why you don't have games that support

1159
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:20,980
multiple game pads.

1160
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:22,540
But not yet, but maybe soon.

1161
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:23,540
Who knows?

1162
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:24,540
All right.

1163
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:28,180
5th Dream in chat says, hey, this isn't a Judge Rob podcast, okay?

1164
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,700
Thank you, 5th Dream.

1165
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:30,700
Thank you.

1166
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:31,700
Nice to know I have at least one supporter.

1167
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:32,700
What?

1168
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:33,700
What?

1169
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:34,700
I'm judging you.

1170
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:35,700
Yeah, yeah.

1171
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:38,260
For other reasons, other reasons, not your gaming choices.

1172
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:43,340
All right, speaking of gaming choices and Amiibo and so forth, Nintendo's Amiibo is

1173
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:47,760
said to soon be unlocking NES and SNES- Games?

1174
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:48,760
Game demos.

1175
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,760
Oh, demos.

1176
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:50,760
Just demos.

1177
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:55,560
The Wii U app that's apparently going to be available sometime in the first half of this

1178
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:59,560
year, which I imagine will be one of those surprise Nintendo Directs, will allow players

1179
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:04,920
to enjoy what they call highlighted scenes from certain games when you tap certain Amiibo

1180
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,920
to the game pad.

1181
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:10,880
These demo scenes will be constrained by a time limit, but other scenes will be available

1182
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,880
if you tap the Amiibo again.

1183
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,360
This was all in a presentation that Satoru Iwata gave in a presentation to Japanese investors,

1184
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:21,880
saying, quote, we hope that when you tap your Amiibo, the quickly changing game scenes will

1185
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:26,980
pleasantly surprise you and make you feel as though you have just changed a game cartridge.

1186
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:27,980
This sounds-

1187
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:28,980
Stupid.

1188
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:29,980
Yes.

1189
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:30,980
Incredibly.

1190
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:31,980
No.

1191
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:32,980
You're a hater.

1192
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:33,980
I'm not a hater.

1193
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:36,600
It sounds a little bit like the NES remix.

1194
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,600
A little bit.

1195
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:41,680
Like maybe an Amiibo would unlock a few stages in this NES remix style thing.

1196
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,680
I'm not a hater.

1197
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:43,680
That's what it sounds like.

1198
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:44,680
Here's my problem.

1199
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:45,680
Really?

1200
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:51,680
I sold goddamn Super Mario Brothers for the NES, okay, in digital form, and you're still

1201
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:55,040
fucking charging like $5 for that shit.

1202
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,040
Don't get me wrong.

1203
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:00,480
I think that game is deserving of $5, but you can't possibly, you know, give it away

1204
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,920
for free a little bit.

1205
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:08,680
I mean, you have all this digital stuff that is basically out there that they could be,

1206
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,440
you know, incentivizing people to buy.

1207
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,640
I guess they don't really need any incentive to buy Amiibos because people are just buying

1208
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:19,160
them for no apparent reason, but I just think unlocking demos is stupid.

1209
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:23,640
I mean, it's just, I don't know, it seems kind of pointless.

1210
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,720
It does seem a little cheap.

1211
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:31,400
Maybe if Animal Crossing never happened, and I didn't see that, oh, hey, cool, they had

1212
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:37,920
a game where I could, you know, unlock full NES games and play them, you know, if maybe

1213
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,920
if that didn't happen, it would feel so ripped off about it, but you know, the fact that

1214
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:46,200
they did that at one time kind of pisses me off that they're doing this now.

1215
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:50,200
Food for thought, Nintendo, if anybody happens to be out there listening and you're like,

1216
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,520
this guy, Loki, is a hater.

1217
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,520
Here's some food for thought.

1218
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,600
Honestly, what I think could maybe sway some people is that if you're going to do these

1219
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:00,520
demos or whatever, fine, but I cited NES Remix, right?

1220
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:06,020
And part of what made NES Remix really cool were those stages that brought something different

1221
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:07,720
to the classic games.

1222
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:13,640
For example, when you could play as Peach from Mario 2 in stages from Mario 3.

1223
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:19,760
If I could use my Peach amiibo to, like, unlock new experiences like that that are still classically

1224
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,140
inspired or whatever, that would be cool.

1225
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:25,680
Think like Sonic and Knuckles with NES games.

1226
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:26,960
Why not?

1227
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,000
Because I would take effort and they won't do it.

1228
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,860
And I tell you, that is exactly why.

1229
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:35,120
I hope you're wrong, sadly, I don't think you are.

1230
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:38,080
It's as minimal effort as possible.

1231
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,320
They're going to go to great lengths to build this app anyway.

1232
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,320
Why not?

1233
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:46,420
No, that's the thing, they're just doing that because I think it's to kind of combat the

1234
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:49,180
argument that these amiibos don't really do anything.

1235
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:50,180
And that's really what it is.

1236
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:56,880
It's like, well, see, now we can say that they unlock shit in Hyrule Warriors and it

1237
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:03,000
unlocks, you can play them in Mario Party 10 and you can use them in Smash and now they

1238
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,840
unlock a demo instead of it just being for a handful of things.

1239
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:11,480
I think that's what it is because right now, things are really crazy with amiibos and people

1240
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,440
are just wanting to snap them up.

1241
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,480
But given a year, I think it's going to be less crazy.

1242
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:23,400
I think that if we see that they're not implementing the stuff in a reasonable way, like, and it's

1243
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,440
like, okay, well, these are the only, there's only a handful of games that these are actually

1244
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:31,040
going to work with, then I think people are going to stop, you know, snatch them up.

1245
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:34,600
Granted, there are still going to be people that buy everything because there are people

1246
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:37,440
like that in Skylanders and Disney Infinity, so I wouldn't doubt it.

1247
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,040
Well, let me throw this out there too, because just a really quick follow up here, because

1248
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:46,160
this is going to have an impact on this as well, and that is the fact that amiibo cards

1249
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,880
are being talked about again.

1250
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:52,080
And again, from this same, you know, financial briefing, Satoru Iwata was talking about how

1251
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:56,640
well the amiibos are doing and so forth, or I'm sorry, the amiibo, I guess the plural

1252
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,040
of amiibo is still amiibo.

1253
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:04,280
I keep wanting to say amiibai, but it's, the plural of amiibo is amiibo, but I have

1254
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:06,480
to fight that urge to say amiibos.

1255
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:12,040
But anyway, so Satoru Iwata says, in contrast to the current figure-shaped amiibo available,

1256
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:18,120
we will make amiibo in the form of cards this year as one of our future plans, as Mr. Miyamoto

1257
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:21,240
mentioned in the corporate management policy briefing in October.

1258
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:24,640
So that is still something that's highly likely on the table as we get closer to the end of

1259
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:25,640
the year.

1260
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:29,880
And that probably answers how we're gonna be able to get Wii Fit Trainer now that all

1261
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,760
those figures are long gone.

1262
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,040
You know, we'll have the cards, you'll have a Wii Fit Trainer card.

1263
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:39,920
I just, for me, again, it really depends on how those guys are priced.

1264
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:40,920
Exactly.

1265
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,320
Oh hey, there's that card, it's $10.

1266
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:46,560
I don't think, here's what I think will happen.

1267
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:51,120
I don't think a singular card will be $10, but I think they're gonna sell them in packs

1268
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:52,120
of three.

1269
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:53,120
Blind packs.

1270
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:57,040
Oh, fuck you for saying that, blind packs.

1271
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,680
Oh, please no, no.

1272
01:01:58,680 --> 01:01:59,680
Don't give them any ideas.

1273
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:03,960
If Nintendo's listening, I want you to immediately delete the last 20 seconds of this show so

1274
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,960
you never heard Loki say that.

1275
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:09,160
I wasn't thinking that, I was thinking like a pack of three.

1276
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:15,520
Like here is series one amiibo cards, and you get three of them for $12, but it's what,

1277
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:21,000
Wii Fit Trainer, who else was in that first series, Marth, and who else can't you get

1278
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,000
anymore?

1279
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,200
I know some amiibo fan in the chat is yelling it out, but whoever was in that series that's

1280
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,480
really hard to get now, oh, Villager was in that series, right?

1281
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,120
So those would be like the first set of cards.

1282
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,400
I would think maybe it could be a thing.

1283
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:39,440
So Black Wolf in chat says, edit it out, I just might, we'll just have the passphrase

1284
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:40,440
there instead.

1285
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:42,840
It'll be like, why did it jump from one thought to another?

1286
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:48,200
It usually doesn't do that in the past, but no, I had to cut out what Loki said.

1287
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:54,680
Of all the things I could have censored Loki on on this show over the past 13 years, it's

1288
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:55,680
gonna be that.

1289
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,680
It's gonna happen.

1290
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:57,680
It's gonna be that.

1291
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,680
And you know why it's gonna happen?

1292
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:03,400
Because, you know, they've already done this kind of bullshit with the other type of, Disney

1293
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:06,680
Infinity does this with their fucking power-ups, it's blind packs.

1294
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:10,120
So I wouldn't doubt, I wouldn't doubt that they would do that.

1295
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,020
How dare you?

1296
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:14,640
Because they need to make money, and that's what it is.

1297
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:17,880
They're gonna make money because they're like, well, you could trade them with your friends!

1298
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:18,880
It's social!

1299
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,360
Trade them when they come over and play Mario Kart with you and sit on your couch!

1300
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:25,480
Nobody interacts in person anymore.

1301
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:33,520
But to be fair, Jamie, the Wii U is still the undisputed champion of living room play.

1302
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:36,440
You know, like I had a friend over earlier today, we were having a great time playing

1303
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,440
Mario Kart.

1304
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,600
I didn't think of better stuff to do in the living room, no I'm kidding.

1305
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:41,600
Anyway.

1306
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:42,600
Speaking of Jamie, let's-

1307
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:46,140
It's never as much fun as watching you play ABBA.

1308
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:47,140
Everything we'll ever talk-

1309
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:48,140
The ABBA game.

1310
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:49,140
You're watching ABBA You Can Dance.

1311
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:50,140
Yeah, that was great.

1312
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:51,140
Can I get an ABBA amiibo?

1313
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:55,060
Would it be, um, an ABBA meebo?

1314
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:56,060
ABBA meebo.

1315
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:57,060
ABBA meebo.

1316
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:58,060
A man can dream.

1317
01:03:58,060 --> 01:03:59,740
I have a dream!

1318
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:13,260
This is the person that gave you Super

1319
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:17,300
It's like you put the card in another card, like in his sleeve, and I could have, like,

1320
01:04:17,300 --> 01:04:19,300
my little ABBA meebo.

1321
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:21,240
ABBA meebo.

1322
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,980
This is a thing now, the ABBA meebo.

1323
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:23,980
Okay.

1324
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:24,980
So-

1325
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:30,180
And then when I beat you in Smash Brothers, I can say, the winner takes it all!

1326
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:33,420
The loser's standing small.

1327
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:35,140
Loki looks like he's in pain over there.

1328
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:39,300
It's like, for some reason that singing gave me a headache, I still know.

1329
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,300
And now I have a migraine.

1330
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,940
You know you have to get more frames now because you have two ABBA albums now.

1331
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:44,820
Maybe change the topic quick.

1332
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:45,820
Twitch!

1333
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:47,140
Wait, this is making me twitch.

1334
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:53,060
Yes, that song made me.

1335
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:56,540
So anyway, uh, Twitch has put out an announcement.

1336
01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:57,820
They're gonna do TwitchCon.

1337
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:00,460
It's a fan festival type thing.

1338
01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:06,280
Um, so yeah, Twitch is gonna be doing the first ever fan and content creator gathering

1339
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:12,820
called TwitchCon, and, uh, the announcement came out on the 20th, but it's gonna be September

1340
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:18,580
25th through 26th in San Francisco at the place that I can never pronounce right, the

1341
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:28,860
Moscone Center, um, where we, uh, it was right next door to where GamerX was last year.

1342
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:34,500
Um, so basically it's gonna be put together by Twitch and by, uh, ReadPop.

1343
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:39,140
So it's gonna get basically broadcasters, fans together, you know, just have everyone

1344
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:42,100
come together and see what happens and play games.

1345
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,140
Will the swap be attending as well?

1346
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:45,260
What?

1347
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:50,420
I'm just wondering.

1348
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:56,360
So how do you feel about another convention?

1349
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:57,980
It's oddly quiet, isn't it?

1350
01:05:57,980 --> 01:05:58,980
Tweet, tweet, tweet.

1351
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:01,820
Um, you know, it's a good idea.

1352
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:05,960
If it's probably gonna be, you know, prohibitive though with all the other shit I've got going

1353
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,740
on this year.

1354
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:11,420
That's what a lot of people are saying is that it's like, oh yay, another convention

1355
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:15,500
on the calendar, you know, it's, it's like, we've got a lot of conventions throughout

1356
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:16,500
the year.

1357
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:19,060
It's also a little bit strange because, you know, I understand the, that YouTube does

1358
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,060
something similar.

1359
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:23,460
They have like kind of this, they have a ball pit, they don't have a ball pit, but they

1360
01:06:23,460 --> 01:06:26,460
have like a kind of like a content creator gathering type thing.

1361
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:32,800
But Twitch to me doesn't seem like it's much of the same type of content you would see

1362
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:38,260
on YouTube where it's more of like, you know, obviously it's live stuff and not so much

1363
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:43,180
like, you know, shows or anything like, you're not going to have like, you know, TV show

1364
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:45,060
or, you know, web series or something like that.

1365
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:51,420
It's more of, you know, live playing or like let's plays or tournaments or something like

1366
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:52,420
that.

1367
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:56,700
So I don't know what they would be doing necessarily here, what you're going to go see there.

1368
01:06:56,700 --> 01:07:01,140
Are you going to see tournaments, see people live streaming their games because that seems

1369
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:02,140
kind of boring.

1370
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:08,620
Well, I know one of Twitch's niches is the live, like sports style events like, you know,

1371
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:11,660
the League of Legends tournaments and the Starcraft tournaments and so forth.

1372
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:15,980
I would think that they could probably get a lot of the big players and the E-leagues

1373
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:18,460
and so forth kind of together under one roof.

1374
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:22,020
I mean, it's not like there are already a lot of those events as well, but to have something

1375
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:25,900
that's kind of like sanctioned by Twitch that might, you know, be playing obviously and

1376
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:29,060
highlighted on Twitch, I think could draw a lot of that content.

1377
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:33,180
And I kind of have a feeling that's what TwitchCon's big strength would be is that they'll probably

1378
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:36,380
get a lot of that, you know, major league gaming, esports.

1379
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:41,140
They're going to have a lot of that going on at the con, I would think.

1380
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:47,100
Along with panels on, you know, how to be a better broadcaster and, you know, how to

1381
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:51,140
become a partner and how to make money, you know, all those other types of things.

1382
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:53,900
So, but again, there's just so many cons.

1383
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:58,140
You guys, like RuPaul just announced DragCon in May.

1384
01:07:58,140 --> 01:07:59,820
How can I not want to go to that?

1385
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:01,820
Like I don't even dress up.

1386
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:03,820
I just, I just think they're bitchy fun.

1387
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:04,820
I love it.

1388
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:07,180
So I kind of want to go just to get sassed.

1389
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:08,180
But you know what?

1390
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:12,460
We kind of had that at GamerX anyway, especially since I just kept running into Queens at Sephora.

1391
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:17,580
Like the one I had to fight off for the, the green emerald Pantone eyelashes.

1392
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:22,340
Well, at least GX is a different time of year this year where there isn't a lot of cons.

1393
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:23,340
So I'm happy about that.

1394
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:24,340
It's like the first week of December, right?

1395
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:25,860
Yeah, it's right in December this time.

1396
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:26,860
Hallelujah.

1397
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:27,860
Yeah.

1398
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:29,580
Which is a true story.

1399
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:32,940
I did fight off a drag queen at a Sephora for Pantone emerald green eyelashes.

1400
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:38,700
YYR in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says if they host a whole bunch of tournaments,

1401
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:39,980
that could be a big draw.

1402
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:42,740
Admission will cost $80 and a pound of salt.

1403
01:08:42,740 --> 01:08:45,660
Well, I could see them doing like, you know, that'd be kind of cool.

1404
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:50,740
Like more of like an X Games type thing, but you know, just like big old tournament thing.

1405
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:51,740
That'd be kind of cool.

1406
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:53,100
I can see that.

1407
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:55,500
At least it's just over the bridge in San Francisco.

1408
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,820
So I mean, it's kind of local for us.

1409
01:08:57,820 --> 01:09:02,820
So Moscone Center is literally next door to where gamer X two was last year.

1410
01:09:02,820 --> 01:09:07,900
And it's also across the street from the Metreon, which a lot of, you know, if you remember

1411
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:10,900
the PlayStation store in San Francisco, there's only sadness there now.

1412
01:09:10,900 --> 01:09:11,900
Well, yeah.

1413
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:13,660
Now it's just a movie theater really and nothing else.

1414
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:14,660
Some eateries.

1415
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:19,700
But, uh, you know, back in the day that was like a big hub for Sony and DDR players definitely

1416
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:23,020
remember the arcade that used to be there, uh, was huge for some tournaments.

1417
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:26,780
So, you know, that little block right there in San Francisco is pretty awesome.

1418
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:29,500
Does it still have the walk of game down there?

1419
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:34,700
I think it does still exist, but like there's literally nothing else up there.

1420
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:39,700
So unless they, Oh, actually they might've turned that into the target now.

1421
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:40,700
That might be the target.

1422
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:42,020
It might be the walk of target.

1423
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:45,660
It might be like socks and underwear now.

1424
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:46,660
I don't know.

1425
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:47,660
That's disappointing.

1426
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:48,660
We'll see.

1427
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:56,540
To register participation for this week's episode of Warren Jones Radio at vognetwork.com,

1428
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:57,900
use the passphrase PINK.

1429
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:58,900
All right.

1430
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:01,180
Uh, moving on, uh, with some more news.

1431
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:02,180
Loki.

1432
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:03,180
All right.

1433
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:07,380
So don't call it a comeback, but, uh, there's going to be some more rock band DLC coming

1434
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:08,380
out.

1435
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:09,380
That's right.

1436
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:11,380
They're, they're coming back.

1437
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:16,660
They're saying on February, uh, well, on February 17th, they released, was it Back to the Shack

1438
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:23,340
from Weezer, Rise of the Phoenix from Tenacious D. Um, each of those will be sold for $1.99.

1439
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:26,060
And apparently they're still working on some more stuff.

1440
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:31,940
Um, they're even saying that, um, you know, they may have some more stuff to reveal soon.

1441
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:33,180
What does this all mean though?

1442
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:34,180
What does this all mean?

1443
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:38,540
Gee, what could those song titles, could those song titles be implying anything Rise of the

1444
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:46,620
Phoenix really like, can we please get Elton John's The Bitches Back in like a month?

1445
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:52,340
Basically, you know, according to an unnamed source, cause you know, that's always good,

1446
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:56,180
is that they're working on another rock band game that's going to be coming out for PlayStation

1447
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:59,020
4 and Xbox One.

1448
01:10:59,020 --> 01:11:03,860
Um, could this be announced at PAX East?

1449
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:07,340
I'll feel a lot better about having to spend the money to go out there if that's the case.

1450
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:08,340
It's quite possible.

1451
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:10,940
I think one of the, the, where is, where is harmonics?

1452
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:11,940
Boston.

1453
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:17,180
Well, one of the, um, the hints also was they showed all the different pins that you can

1454
01:11:17,180 --> 01:11:21,780
collect, but the harmonics one had a big question mark on it, cause they're not showing what

1455
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:22,780
it is yet.

1456
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:23,780
Oh, okay.

1457
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:29,900
Uh, it would make sense that they would reveal that there, um, I think that's cool.

1458
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:34,900
I hope they put it out, but I also hope that my instruments work with it because I have

1459
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:36,540
them all on Xbox 360.

1460
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:38,560
A converter would be nice.

1461
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:39,560
That would be nice.

1462
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:45,280
I mean, I have got like, um, I've got my converter thing for my controllers to use Xbox 360 controllers

1463
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:50,840
on it, but I've, yeah, I hope that there's some sort of way to use that cause I don't

1464
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:51,840
want to have to buy.

1465
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,960
I'm, well, I, I'm telling you this much, I'm not going to buy new instruments for when

1466
01:11:55,960 --> 01:11:56,960
it comes out.

1467
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:00,280
Can we get a new DJ Harrow please too?

1468
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:01,280
That I would buy.

1469
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:02,280
Talk to the other company about that.

1470
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:03,280
I know.

1471
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:04,280
I know.

1472
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:08,640
I would pay money though for that and kind of have to make my own if I don't, you know,

1473
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:09,640
get one soon.

1474
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:10,640
All right.

1475
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:14,120
Uh, well I, I, I hope that, uh, it does happen.

1476
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:16,840
I'd love to see it at PAX East except I know I'll never get to play it cause it's going

1477
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:20,480
to be the world's worst line, uh, to get in and play that game.

1478
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:22,000
But at least hopefully I'll get to see it.

1479
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Nothing else.

1480
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,840
I mean, Rock Band's got a formula, they don't really have to break it.

1481
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:29,160
I'd be curious to see what they do with it.

1482
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:33,100
What, what the new systems can bring to that.

1483
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:34,760
Excellent point from Black Wolf in the chat room.

1484
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:35,760
So excellent.

1485
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:37,880
I want stage kit compatibility.

1486
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,120
Yes, please.

1487
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:42,560
Hey, I, I wonder if you can still get those.

1488
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,560
That'd be pretty awesome.

1489
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,360
Maybe you can get them discount or something.

1490
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:51,600
Um, knowing that there's a big social element in gaming now that wasn't there a few years

1491
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:56,200
ago and I'm talking about Twitch basically and um, you know, the fact that people stream

1492
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:57,480
live and so forth.

1493
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:03,200
I wonder if there's going to be some type of connected living room experience through

1494
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:09,120
like streaming a video or something where you can now be in a band with somebody that

1495
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:13,120
lives, you know, in another house basically.

1496
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:17,920
Like I noticed that a grandpa from Hoard House just joined our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

1497
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:23,680
So I could play keyboards in my house and grandpa could sing over in his house.

1498
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:27,960
You know, he could sing a, you know, a journey song, whatever, any way you want it.

1499
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:29,480
That's the way you need it.

1500
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:30,960
Like he, you know, right.

1501
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,760
And then we could actually see each other while we're playing.

1502
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:37,080
That would be kind of cool because I seem to recall in the three 61 you wouldn't get

1503
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:41,000
to hear the other person because of the delay, which makes sense.

1504
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:44,660
And to be fair, that delay is still going to be there, but maybe they'll do something

1505
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:48,960
where like after you do the song, you can watch a performance that like puts all you

1506
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,960
guys together or something like there's something they could do.

1507
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:56,400
I'm sure it would be actually sort of interesting is if they had something that worked with

1508
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:02,200
like, you know, your cameras or whatever that you, uh, it compiles into like one of those

1509
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,160
YouTube esque, you know, multi-panel videos.

1510
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:05,160
Yeah.

1511
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,160
Yeah.

1512
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:07,160
That would be actually be kind of funny.

1513
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:08,160
That would be kind of cool.

1514
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:09,160
I bet.

1515
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:10,160
I wouldn't watch myself.

1516
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:11,160
I bet.

1517
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:13,040
That's what maybe the ultimate thing would be is that you could create like a music video

1518
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:16,560
from all four different places or something like it would film all people and like put

1519
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:17,560
it all together.

1520
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:18,560
That would be pretty cool.

1521
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:19,560
That would be pretty cool.

1522
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:24,640
Not even necessarily for if you've got like a harmonizing with the two mics, which they

1523
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:25,640
have like a Beatles rock band.

1524
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:29,440
I'm going to make it a point this week to play DJ hero.

1525
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:30,440
That's like, that's a good goal.

1526
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:31,440
That's a good goal.

1527
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:32,680
All right.

1528
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:38,480
Um, so, uh, earlier this week on, um, you know, we, we have an interesting relationship

1529
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:41,880
with this particular site, but it's being reported around the internet and it's a story

1530
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:47,320
that Kotaku ran, uh, where they interviewed the legend of Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma,

1531
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:52,080
uh, who was talking a lot about, you know, the Zelda and what to expect in the new Zelda

1532
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,360
and so forth.

1533
01:14:53,360 --> 01:15:01,400
But, um, uh, he was also talking about Tingle and, uh, some of the, um, lore and things

1534
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:04,040
behind Tingle, one of Loki's very favorite characters.

1535
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,040
Oh yeah.

1536
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:08,560
So what he said about Tingle, I guess the heart of the character, there's a little bit

1537
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:10,240
of a gag kind of feeling to it.

1538
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:14,360
The way the design of the character started is that we needed to think about how the character

1539
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:17,040
at the player would get access to maps in this game.

1540
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:20,400
Of course you could go with a situation where as soon as he sees an area, you just open

1541
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:23,480
up your map and it fills in for you, but we wanted to do something a little different.

1542
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:25,260
So we thought, what if you had to buy maps?

1543
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:27,720
Then suddenly we needed a character that you would buy maps from.

1544
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:30,360
We ultimately ended up with a character here that had a little bit of humor to him that

1545
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:34,320
came from thinking of what sort of person would sell a map and well, we decided it would

1546
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,320
be the kind of person who makes the map.

1547
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:40,360
And the way he makes the map is by floating through the air so that he can see the contours

1548
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:41,500
of the land and draw them.

1549
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:44,520
But as soon as we get that far in the process, we realized anybody that would fly through

1550
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:47,300
the air making a map, it's got to be a really weird person.

1551
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:52,340
So at that point we decided, okay, we'll go with this and make him a really weird guy.

1552
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:55,300
So when we made this character, we had this notion that one of the ways he might be a

1553
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:58,900
little bit weird is that he had this notion that he never wanted to grow up.

1554
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:02,540
And so I think to that extent, the clothes do fit this image of him and the whole thing

1555
01:16:02,540 --> 01:16:05,180
comes together as a very Peter Pan kind of visual.

1556
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:08,500
You know, if you think about it, it's this guy in his thirties in a green suit and is

1557
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:10,680
flying and never wants to grow up.

1558
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:13,220
It all sort of comes together around that.

1559
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:19,840
And then the ever classy Kotaku asked, so is Tingle gay basically?

1560
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,860
And Anuma replied to that and said, he's not gay.

1561
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:25,020
He's just an odd person.

1562
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:29,480
And I don't, I kind of feel like that question was unnecessary.

1563
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:31,280
It really was like, why, why does it matter?

1564
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:34,000
But I also, that's kind of where I'm at.

1565
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Like who cares?

1566
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,000
It's a video game character.

1567
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:41,380
They don't think of, okay, what kind of sexuality is this video game character going to have?

1568
01:16:41,380 --> 01:16:48,640
But I also understand that in some ways Tingle has become a bit of a gay icon and sometimes

1569
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:49,640
that happens.

1570
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:54,400
Like I seem to recall gaygamer.net did like a little feature that was bestowing some type

1571
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,480
of like character of the year award.

1572
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:57,480
I don't know.

1573
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:00,180
I don't, I sorry, I don't remember the exact title they bestowed on him, but it was some

1574
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:01,680
type of like honor.

1575
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:08,600
So I don't know, like, but so part of me says, okay, well I guess, I guess the fans have

1576
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:14,160
kind of painted this image or whatever of, of Tingle and, and, you know, it held him

1577
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:17,440
up in this regard or whatever, but I still kind of feel like, well then why do you want

1578
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:22,780
to poke a hole in that question by saying, you know, so tell me yes or no, is he gay?

1579
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:27,300
And I kind of wish Enuma had just said, I don't really have an answer for that.

1580
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:33,000
Or just said, we haven't really explored that part of the character or it's a video game

1581
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,620
and we don't plan on putting Tingle in a relationship anytime soon.

1582
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:38,660
So go with that what you will.

1583
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:40,980
How about what the fuck does it matter?

1584
01:17:40,980 --> 01:17:42,040
Or something like that.

1585
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:43,860
So it really doesn't matter.

1586
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:48,780
But I'm not going to blame Enuma for that because I also realized the culture in Japan

1587
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:50,860
is very different from the culture here.

1588
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:53,780
And he probably didn't know what the fuck to say, honestly.

1589
01:17:53,780 --> 01:17:54,780
Well that's a stupid question.

1590
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:55,780
I don't blame him.

1591
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:56,780
It's, it's.

1592
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:57,780
Yeah.

1593
01:17:57,780 --> 01:17:58,780
It's dumb.

1594
01:17:58,780 --> 01:17:59,780
It's just a video game.

1595
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:00,780
It was just.

1596
01:18:00,780 --> 01:18:04,580
It's not a video game that requires him to have sexual relations with other characters.

1597
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:08,780
Why do people have to keep fucking stuff up with doing it?

1598
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:14,220
But I could see, I want to be fair and I can see the flip side to it of, again, he was

1599
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:16,380
a gay icon or whatever.

1600
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:22,460
But I kind of also look at that and go, well, ABBA was a gay icon in many ways because of,

1601
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:27,220
you know, they made these, these outfits out of nothing that were, you know, hilarious

1602
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:29,440
and their songs were fun and so forth.

1603
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:35,620
But ABBA was, there's, there's like the actual term of homosexuality.

1604
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:37,940
There's nothing homosexual about ABBA.

1605
01:18:37,940 --> 01:18:44,120
In fact, they were quite the incestuous little group where they were married in straight

1606
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,160
relationships.

1607
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:49,400
One guy was married to one girl and then they divorced and married the other girl.

1608
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:52,100
Each guy married, like, so ABBA was kind of crazy like that.

1609
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:57,680
But my point is, is that gay icons don't always necessarily mean gay people.

1610
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:00,560
Does that make sense?

1611
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,760
Well, well, what was the deal with Donna Summer for the longest time?

1612
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,040
She actually was relatively homophobic.

1613
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:11,720
Yes, I think she did come around in the end, but it was a little bit of that whole mixed

1614
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:16,280
message where, you know, the church was telling her one thing, you know, and that whole, that

1615
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:17,800
whole situation was going on.

1616
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:20,840
So, uh, and Dungeon Buster in chat says, I agree with Sky.

1617
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,440
I think Anuma was just caught completely off guard.

1618
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:25,240
No one expects the Kotaku Inquisition.

1619
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:31,000
I just, I just kind of like, why did that have to be a question?

1620
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,520
It would make for a headline for them if they're like, confirm Tingle is gay.

1621
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:36,520
You know what I mean?

1622
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:38,080
That's why they asked that stupid thing.

1623
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:39,080
Anyway.

1624
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:40,080
All right.

1625
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,080
So there it is.

1626
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:42,880
That's, uh, that's some news that's been going around this week.

1627
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:43,880
Let's move on.

1628
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:48,200
Um, uh, and so it looks like Steve has an early class tomorrow.

1629
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:49,200
Oh, makes sense.

1630
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:50,200
Yeah.

1631
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,520
So one more plug for Flom.

1632
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:52,520
Check out Flom.

1633
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:53,520
Yes.

1634
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:54,520
Go please everybody.

1635
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:59,320
I will give two people $3 to go buy the game.

1636
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:00,720
I will gift it to a couple of you.

1637
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:03,240
How can they sign up for free money, DarkSakura?

1638
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:04,240
I will.

1639
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:06,880
How will you know that they bought the game and not a taco?

1640
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,920
Send me your Apple ID and I will gift you the game.

1641
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:09,920
Only two people though.

1642
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:10,920
Only two people.

1643
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:11,920
All right.

1644
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:14,080
Anyway, uh, let's move on.

1645
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,080
Uh, DarkSakura, you have a story for us.

1646
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,660
This game is pretty freaking cool.

1647
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:19,840
It's called Killer Queen.

1648
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:24,560
It is the world's first 10 player arcade strategy game.

1649
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:29,880
It wasn't released for iOS or Android or any home handheld thing.

1650
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:30,880
It's not a computer game.

1651
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:37,040
It is a full fledged fucking arcade game and it's 10 players and you can only find it in

1652
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,880
five places in the country.

1653
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:43,200
So well, I guess technically that would be in the world as well.

1654
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:52,720
Um, but it was put out by two people, Nikita Mikros and Joshua Debonis.

1655
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:55,080
And it's just really weird.

1656
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:58,180
You don't have to play it one different, one way.

1657
01:20:58,180 --> 01:21:00,960
You can beat it several different ways.

1658
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:03,520
You have five players, so it's five against five.

1659
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:08,400
You have to have, they say that you need to have at least, you know, four on a team to

1660
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:12,680
make it really worthwhile or three on a team.

1661
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:14,800
But you can beat Killer Queen different ways.

1662
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,580
You can collect berries and take them back to your base.

1663
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:20,280
You can ride a snail toward your goal.

1664
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:21,280
Yuck.

1665
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:22,280
Snails are disgusting.

1666
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:31,880
Um, you basically, you just have to make, you just have to win by any means necessary.

1667
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:35,120
You know, hopefully by confounding the other people.

1668
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:41,480
But each team has four grunts and a queen and you can also win by the way, by killing

1669
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:42,840
the queen three times.

1670
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:46,660
The enemy's queen, but the queen has wings and she gets to sort of spout around like

1671
01:21:46,660 --> 01:21:51,120
she's in joust and the grunts though have to run around on the ground until they level

1672
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:52,920
up and get more capabilities.

1673
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:56,940
Um, so they have to keep bringing more berries to your team.

1674
01:21:56,940 --> 01:22:04,520
So it's sort of like capture the flag, quit it, kill bees, the game.

1675
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,440
And in our chat room, it's just so bizarre.

1676
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:10,760
In our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, SSG100Matt says, played this at MagFest and

1677
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:12,560
it's amazing.

1678
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:20,560
See, I want, okay, I want more people to play this game and then like send us pictures of

1679
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:21,560
them playing it.

1680
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:22,760
So you have to find them.

1681
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:31,440
If you find the killer queen and take a picture of it, I will buy you a copy of Flom.

1682
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:32,440
That's only two people though.

1683
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:33,440
Only two people.

1684
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:34,440
Max two people.

1685
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:35,440
Max two.

1686
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:36,440
All right.

1687
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:41,240
So, uh, yeah, I, I'm excited to hear though that there's like an actual like arcade experience

1688
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:42,240
going on with this.

1689
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:43,560
That's, uh, that's always nice to know.

1690
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:48,120
Well, the places that you can find it, um, there is one at Logan arcade in Chicago.

1691
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:54,120
Um, there's also one in Portland at, uh, ground control.

1692
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:55,680
Oh, that place.

1693
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:57,960
That's like the retro arcade, if I'm not mistaken.

1694
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:58,960
I went there once.

1695
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:04,920
There's a league night at that location, I believe that they say there's also in California

1696
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:05,920
anywhere.

1697
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:07,400
LA San Francisco.

1698
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:11,920
I just saw the two in there, but you know, I'll go hunting around and see if there are

1699
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:12,920
any other locations.

1700
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:13,920
All right.

1701
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:19,840
Um, yeah, they are just, it's really pretty too on top of that, just really kind of cute

1702
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:21,480
and pixely in an old school way.

1703
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:22,480
All right.

1704
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:25,720
We're going to travel around the world now and check out some release dates and see what

1705
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:28,120
games are coming to a store near you.

1706
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:32,080
Uh, you can find killer queen in an arcade, uh, or a few of them anyway, but you can find

1707
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:36,040
these games on shelves this week around the world, uh, starting in the U S Loki.

1708
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:37,040
Yes.

1709
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:41,720
So this week, uh, you can pick up dragon ball, Xenoverse, which is going to be coming out

1710
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:48,320

1711
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:58,600
Also under night in birth exe late, which is by axis for, um, the PlayStation three.

1712
01:23:58,600 --> 01:23:59,600
And let's see what else?

1713
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:00,600
Nice.

1714
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:06,840

And let's see what else here.

1718
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:21,920
Uh, that might actually be it.

1719
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:25,520
Uh, let's see here.

1720
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:26,520
Last call.

1721
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,520
Dragon balls.

1722
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:29,520
Xenoverse is also on PC.

1723
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:30,520
Apparently that's it.

1724
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:31,520
Here it is.

1725
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:34,440
Uh, going over to Japan and checking out the releases there on the PlayStation four this

1726
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:35,440
week.

1727
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:42,220
Dragon quest heroes on route to, uh, Sakaiju no jewel comes out this week from Squeenix.

1728
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:44,720
It's a dragon quest heroes game on the PlayStation four.

1729
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:46,520
So I've had a lot of people looking forward to that.

1730
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:48,760
Uh, I can't say I blame you for that one.

1731
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:55,240
Uh, on the Xbox one, um, really nothing in Japan this week, but, uh, I imagine the Xbox

1732
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:58,080
one, unfortunately for them, hasn't been gaining a lot of steam over there, so there's probably

1733
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:03,080
not a lot of games there, but dragon quest heroes is also on the PlayStation three this

1734
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:04,080
week.

1735
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:05,080
So you can check that out.

1736
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:08,000
Uh, as I mentioned previously on the show, there's really nothing on the Wii U until

1737
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,400
March over in Japan.

1738
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:15,420
Uh, so checking out the PlayStation Vita PlayStation Vita has captain earth mind labyrinth this

1739
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:22,360
week, as well as Diabloic lovers, dark fate and Osmophia vivace comes out this week and

1740
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:26,560
the game called parfait comes out, uh, on the Vita as well.

1741
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:27,760
This is about butter.

1742
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,400
Uh, what is parfait about?

1743
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,240
It's regular and limited edition.

1744
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:34,520
It's parfait you were thinking of.

1745
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:35,520
Is it about yogurt?

1746
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:38,120
No, it's about girl, girls and maid outfits.

1747
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:44,600
Um, are they making, it might be, it might be a visual novel of a somewhat adult nature

1748
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:50,880
because I'm noticing in this picture, she's not wearing pants, so she is, she's just putting

1749
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:55,680
them on, caught her only in America.

1750
01:25:55,680 --> 01:25:59,680
Do we refer to as trousers as pants in other countries?

1751
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,680
Pants are your underwear?

1752
01:26:00,680 --> 01:26:01,680
And she was wearing them.

1753
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:02,680
Well, okay.

1754
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:05,360
But technically it was a skirt.

1755
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:06,360
Wow.

1756
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:09,600
And this is just a straight up upskirt shot right here that we've got on this.

1757
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:11,400
So, um, wow.

1758
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:15,840
I can't believe it's not butter.

1759
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:20,640
I don't know what else to say about parfait, uh, but Hey, how about the Nintendo three

1760
01:26:20,640 --> 01:26:25,160
DS because on the Nintendo three DS this week, there's Dora Moji and Nobita no Kanji

1761
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:31,600
Daisak Suen comes out this week and Kinero no Korda three full voice special comes out

1762
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:35,520
in a regular edition and a treasure box edition.

1763
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:41,960
And this looks like yet another visual novel on the three DS, but this one's like music

1764
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:47,200
and this guy's a doctor and he forgot his shirt in the shower in this picture.

1765
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:50,120
So you wear your shirt in the shower, Rob?

1766
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:55,040
I suppose not, but I do find this a bit of a gratuitous picture here.

1767
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:57,160
It's not so much the fact that he's in the shower.

1768
01:26:57,160 --> 01:27:01,200
It's the look that's on his face of the, ah, well, you would look like that too.

1769
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:02,960
We don't see what his other hand is doing.

1770
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:03,960
Yeah.

1771
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:10,120
Maybe if my other hand wasn't visible.

1772
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:11,120
There you go.

1773
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:12,120
Those are us.

1774
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:16,940
What you have to look forward to in Japan this week, um, sinning dark Sakura.

1775
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:18,680
How about the UK?

1776
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:20,800
In the UK we have some stuff.

1777
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:27,200
On the 24th there is, there came an echo on PC and on the 25th a good snowman is hard

1778
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:36,160
to build for Mac PC homeworld remastered collection for PC odd world, new and tasty for Mac PC.

1779
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:40,480
And then on everything else, resident evil revelations too.

1780
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:43,320
And seriously, it is on just about everything else.

1781
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:51,000
On the 27th Dragon Ball Xenoverse, um, also Dying Light on a few things, Dynasty Warriors

1782
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:56,280
Eight Empires, uh, Pneuma, Breath of Life, and Trains, a new era.

1783
01:27:56,280 --> 01:28:01,640
As long as it's not the banned train, I'm happy and that's it.

1784
01:28:01,640 --> 01:28:02,640
All right.

1785
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:06,080
Just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week.

1786
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,080
Loki.

1787
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:10,560
So I think this was mentioned a while back and I want to, I can't remember if they said

1788
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:15,720
this in actual, in their press conferences or whatever, but it was that originally the

1789
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:19,800
Xbox ones are going to become dev kits at some point.

1790
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:23,320
Like they're going to allow people to be able to develop games using that instead of an

1791
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:24,320
actual dev kit.

1792
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:27,360
That way it'll open the market up a little bit more to any developers.

1793
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:34,220
Well, apparently the rumor is now that developers, um, will be able to use the Xbox ones as dev

1794
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:36,920
kits later this year in an update.

1795
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:40,360
They're saying that, you know, developers will also be able to use beta apps to test

1796
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:45,080
them with community apps will finally be able to run in the background, allowing third party

1797
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:50,720
music apps to continue outputting music while a game is playing, um, stuff like that.

1798
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:52,840
So that's pretty cool.

1799
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:55,580
I hope that actually ends up being true.

1800
01:28:55,580 --> 01:29:04,720
And apparently the announcement may, um, be made in April during their build conference.

1801
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:05,720
I don't know.

1802
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:06,720
I'm looking forward to it.

1803
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:07,720
Thanks again.

1804
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:08,720
Xbox one, I guess.

1805
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:11,120
Couldn't that be an announcement for game developers conference, which is coming up

1806
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:12,120
as well.

1807
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:14,120
I mean, I know there's been a lot of talk about PAX East, but let's not forget game

1808
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:15,720
developers conference is happening.

1809
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:20,660
And although we don't usually get E3 style announcements at GDC, uh, we did get things

1810
01:29:20,660 --> 01:29:23,440
like the PlayStation move was unveiled at GDC.

1811
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:27,600
So sometimes things that will impact, uh, gaming development, I would expect that we

1812
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:31,320
might find a little more out about project Morpheus at GDC.

1813
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:34,360
Not necessarily like, you know, a day and date type of thing, but maybe like an update

1814
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:39,280
on what development is available for something like that, since it seems like VR is a huge

1815
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:40,440
direction for the industry.

1816
01:29:40,440 --> 01:29:41,440
Yeah.

1817
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:45,080
The theory is that they're going to be publishing like a software development kit preview, I

1818
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:50,140
guess in may, that's going to switch those dev to retails to, um, dev kits.

1819
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:54,120
So I will have to see, but I think the build conference that they're talking about is Microsoft

1820
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:59,800
actually has one for developing on, you know, um, all their windows platforms.

1821
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:04,000
And a lot of these have to do with kind of universal apps that they're going to meld

1822
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:07,040
together with, you know, all their windows 10 platforms.

1823
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:11,320
Uh, now Bobby who follows a lot of the development community, Bobby Black Wolf says, actual developers

1824
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:13,680
are already using retail Xbox ones as dev kits.

1825
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:16,160
This is about extending that to the general public.

1826
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:20,200
So maybe that's why you're like, I thought this was familiar, uh, also Bobby saying and,

1827
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:23,160
and confirming in some ways what I was just saying, there was a four hour presentation

1828
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:25,320
about project Morpheus at GDC.

1829
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:26,680
Not surprised to hear that at all.

1830
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:31,240
And I didn't know that I didn't look, you know, I'm, I don't go to GDC, although funny

1831
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:35,920
enough, because of the way my flight to PAX East is, I'm probably going to San Francisco

1832
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:39,360
to see people that are going to GDC and like go to dinner one night.

1833
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:42,600
And then I'm flying to PAX East the next day while GDC is still going on.

1834
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:46,400
So it's just the way things work out in this crazy world.

1835
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:49,960
So anyway, uh, let's move on.

1836
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:53,320
We're almost to the classic game of the week, but I want to talk about new games for a minute

1837
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:54,320
here.

1838
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:56,080
And this isn't so much as a story as it is.

1839
01:30:56,080 --> 01:31:00,760
I just wanted to bring up this topic because it's been a lot of discussion this week, and

1840
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:07,080
that is the reception to a pretty high, excuse me, I'm so nervous, I'm burping.

1841
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:12,720
It's the release to a pretty high profile PlayStation four game that came out this week.

1842
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:14,920
And that is of course the order.

1843
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:17,880
And you know, I don't know how much stock you guys put in Metacritic.

1844
01:31:17,880 --> 01:31:23,600
I think a lot of big outlets are starting to really walk away from scoring and the way

1845
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:27,320
that their reviews kind of impact Metacritic, because I know Joystiq did that right before

1846
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:28,320
they closed.

1847
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:33,240
I think I saw Eurogamer just recently had walked away from giving games a score now.

1848
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:37,500
So you know, I think some places are starting to reject this Metacritic thing a little bit,

1849
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:42,800
but any way you slice it, the order is sitting at a 65 right now on Metacritic.

1850
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:47,960
And a lot of people are saying it's kind of a, although it's a very pretty experience,

1851
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:49,760
it's a very pretty looking game.

1852
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:57,760
It's a bit of a hollow experience and a lot of attention being called to the play length

1853
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:03,420
of the game, which is depending on who you're asking, anywhere from five to eight hours

1854
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:07,080
about is how long it's going to take you to play the order from start to finish.

1855
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:11,200
Now full disclaimer, I haven't played this game myself yet.

1856
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:17,240
I can really only state these opinions based off of what I've heard other people saying

1857
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:18,900
about the game.

1858
01:32:18,900 --> 01:32:21,920
And I believe Loki and Dark Soccer are in the same boat where they haven't played this

1859
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:22,920
game themselves yet.

1860
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:23,920
I have no interest to play that game.

1861
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:24,920
I mean, it looks okay.

1862
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:27,000
It's just, it's not my...

1863
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:31,480
I wasn't really looking forward to like a third person cover based shooter type game.

1864
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:32,960
I have other stuff I'm doing.

1865
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:33,960
Yeah.

1866
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:36,160
And that's kind of my thing too, is I was like, all right, even though the game looks

1867
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:40,800
very pretty, I wasn't really interested in the game to begin with as much as I am some

1868
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:41,800
other titles.

1869
01:32:41,800 --> 01:32:44,080
If I was going to spend $60 in games, there's a bunch of stuff on sale right now that I

1870
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:47,640
could be picking up, but I didn't want to buy any more games that I'm not going to play

1871
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:51,760
yet because I still haven't touched Watch Dogs or Destiny yet.

1872
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:54,000
Or Battlefield 4 because I picked that up as well.

1873
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,720
So I haven't picked it, played any of that.

1874
01:32:55,720 --> 01:33:02,000
So let me ask this because a lot of people are saying that if you're going to pay $60

1875
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,960
on a game, it ought to be more than five to eight hours in length.

1876
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:11,480
So and even there's some question out there and I saw some tweets going around and one

1877
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:14,120
tweet I remember seeing that came through on my feed and I don't remember who wrote

1878
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:18,780
it because it was somebody retweeted or something, but it said something about if you're factoring

1879
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:23,280
a game's length into the review, you're doing it wrong or something like that.

1880
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:25,360
And I was kind of like, well, wait a minute.

1881
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,480
I'm not so sure I agree with that.

1882
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:35,360
I think the value is important, but at the same time, and I want to make this very clear,

1883
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:41,600
I don't think the order, you know, I think the order is just one particular game.

1884
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:46,360
I don't think that means all games that are only five to eight hours in length that are

1885
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:49,440
$60 are bad just because of their length.

1886
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:53,080
I think it just really depends on the quality of what is filling that time.

1887
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:55,640
It's not necessarily the game's five hours.

1888
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:57,520
It's how much replayability is there?

1889
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:59,240
Because it could be five hours long.

1890
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:03,360
But if I can replay it multiple times and get enjoyment out of playing that over and over

1891
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:05,000
again, then that sounds good.

1892
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:09,840
But the problem is it sounds like it's a lot of cut scenes that are kind of, you know,

1893
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:12,200
extending the gameplay time a bit.

1894
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:15,720
So I don't really know how much enjoyment I would really get out of it unless it's a

1895
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:17,240
really, really good story.

1896
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:21,600
I just don't know if that's the case.

1897
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:26,560
I mean, it could be a pretty looking game, but once again, that doesn't necessarily, you

1898
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,680
know, there's a lot of games that look good.

1899
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:30,120
Grand Theft Auto five looks good.

1900
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:32,360
There's hundreds of hours of gameplay there.

1901
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:34,800
Skyrim looks good.

1902
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,240
And that's a really long game.

1903
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:41,720
Or even if you want to talk short games, Journey looks nice.

1904
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:47,640
It's not necessarily, you know, really cinematic or not to like film quality cinematic, but

1905
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:52,480
it's still a fun game and it's short, but you get a lot of replayability out of it.

1906
01:34:53,040 --> 01:34:55,960
I'm going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

1907
01:34:55,960 --> 01:35:00,680
Alan Alchemy says, so Parasite Eve length, which is a fucking amazing game.

1908
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:02,040
Was it that short?

1909
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:02,920
I don't even remember.

1910
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:06,280
I mean, I played Parasite Eve all the way through, but I think Parasite Eve was a shorter

1911
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:06,600
game.

1912
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:11,360
So it wasn't like a lot of people because it came out in that same kind of era as Final Fantasy

1913
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:11,960
seven and eight.

1914
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:14,840
People think it was a lot longer because those games are longer, but I don't think I don't

1915
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:15,280
think it was.

1916
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:20,920
You know, the Resident Evil games weren't very long because I could sit and beat two.

1917
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:24,080
And we were paying forty, fifty dollars for those games and you didn't hear all this

1918
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:24,480
complaining.

1919
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:28,400
My complaint, you know, I was complaining, though, back when they put out, was it that

1920
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,360
Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes thing?

1921
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:34,880
And that was only like a few hours long and it was half the price and I was still seeing

1922
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:35,640
that was a rip off.

1923
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:38,560
So why would I change my mind on some?

1924
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:44,440
And you can't argue that, you know, Metal Gear Solid five, Ground Zeroes is a cinematic

1925
01:35:44,480 --> 01:35:45,920
game, it is.

1926
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:49,840
And so I think there's more replayability on that, though, than there is on this, because

1927
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:52,960
this sounds very linear, whereas that's kind of more open world.

1928
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:57,840
Alan Alchemy further asks, should a game like Skyrim or Dragon Age Inquisition cost three

1929
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:59,040
hundred and fifty dollars then?

1930
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:01,200
No, I think what's happening is the other way around.

1931
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:06,000
I think because Skyrim and Dragon Age Inquisition are also sixty dollar games, people go, well,

1932
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,600
those games are hundreds and hundreds of hours.

1933
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,880
But then, you know, the order is over in eight hours.

1934
01:36:10,520 --> 01:36:11,600
The order should be twenty bucks.

1935
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:15,320
And that's that's even unrealistic as far as, you know, not all games are going to be

1936
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:17,160
hundred hour epic and they really shouldn't be.

1937
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:22,320
But I'm saying, though, let's let's take like, for example, Resistance, Fallen Man or

1938
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,440
something like that, a game that's kind of linear.

1939
01:36:24,440 --> 01:36:26,120
It's got a single player campaign to it.

1940
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:29,560
And I enjoyed the campaign and I think it was worth sixty dollars.

1941
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:32,720
And there's a little bit of replayability there because you can play it again and get

1942
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:33,720
more weapons and something like that.

1943
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:34,920
And there's multiplayer.

1944
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,000
So there's that on top of it.

1945
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,200
So that overall makes it like kind of a well-rounded experience, whereas this is just

1946
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:43,480
like a really short, linear game with no multiplayer in it.

1947
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:48,320
Like, I can understand if it had like multiplayer aspect to it, it might be a little

1948
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:51,480
bit it might be worth a little bit more, but it doesn't even have it.

1949
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:56,360
It's like and just the excuses, like the whole development process, like their excuses

1950
01:36:56,360 --> 01:37:01,160
were, well, we don't want to be 60 frames per second because it's not as cinematic as

1951
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:04,520
30 frames per second, which really was just because they wanted to push higher fidelity

1952
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:09,280
and they couldn't do that with, you know, a higher frame rate or oh, well, you know,

1953
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:12,840
it's short because it's this, you know, and they're making excuses.

1954
01:37:12,840 --> 01:37:14,320
And it's just I don't like it.

1955
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:19,160
And especially, which I'm assuming this thing has a season pass because goddamn, all

1956
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:21,720
games nowadays seem to have season passes with DLC.

1957
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:26,320
I want to see what they put out for DLC, because, you know, if that's stuff that could

1958
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:30,720
have easily been, why don't you just how about just wait until the, you know, whatever

1959
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:34,000
complete edition comes out or something like that, that might be a little bit more

1960
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,200
worth it. And if it is terrible, I think some people are worried that the order may

1961
01:37:38,200 --> 01:37:43,000
have DLC and that and I can actually I can kind of get where some of that might be a

1962
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,360
little bit justified. Like if this DLC comes out and then they're asking even more

1963
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:49,800
money for it, where some people are going to get like really irritated with that.

1964
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:53,720
I mean, at least Parasite Eve never tried to sell DLC on top of it type of thing.

1965
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:56,760
Right. But anyway, there's a lot of great comments in our chat room here.

1966
01:37:56,760 --> 01:38:00,520
I want to make sure I get through some of these over in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1967
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:05,560
The SAG is there saying for a buyer's review, cost versus gameplay length needs to be

1968
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:10,680
noted. Academic criticism not relevant, which isn't to say it's the factor, but just

1969
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:11,400
something to know.

1970
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:13,400
You know, I think I agree with that.

1971
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:19,840
You know, I remember it was an EGM or games, I think it was EGM that used to do that

1972
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:24,560
where they would have kind of a review in there, like a little chart almost showing

1973
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:26,120
replayability over time.

1974
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:26,680
Yeah, yeah.

1975
01:38:26,680 --> 01:38:28,080
And I love that.

1976
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:29,080
I think that's a great idea.

1977
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:30,720
And this kind of would fall into it.

1978
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:35,120
It's like if this game has a ton of replayability to it, then by all means, a five hour

1979
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:37,440
time frame on it doesn't mean really much of anything.

1980
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:41,480
It's just, you know, I mean, like a lot of arcade games were short.

1981
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:43,520
Right. Let me get through some more of these comments.

1982
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:44,280
There's so many good ones.

1983
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:48,960
acteft in live.vognetwork.com says portal one is an hour short and who doesn't love

1984
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,880
portal one? Well, maybe once you know how to do it, portal one's an hour.

1985
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:57,640
But still, I would say portal two was maybe a maybe a five hour game.

1986
01:38:57,640 --> 01:39:00,480
Right. And it was full, it's been so long since I played it.

1987
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:04,200
Then again, it did have the multiplayer element to it, but it still was a shorter

1988
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:07,560
game. And I didn't see people complaining about, you know, the length of that.

1989
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:11,200
But then again, it's also something that now with, you know, the level letters and

1990
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:13,080
stuff, the replayability is huge.

1991
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:14,480
Let me get through some more comments.

1992
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:20,040
Let's see over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster is pointing out that the $40

1993
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:21,920
for the orange box went towards the entire package.

1994
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:22,920
Let's not forget portal one.

1995
01:39:23,120 --> 01:39:25,160
They weren't selling for $60 by itself.

1996
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:28,560
The orange box is one of the greatest gaming values they've ever released.

1997
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:32,040
Kaijuto says you're paying for the experience, not the game time.

1998
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:35,520
That's like saying shorter movies should cost less than longer movies.

1999
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:39,720
Can we, hold on, if you want to pay less for a shorter game, just rent it like people

2000
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:41,040
have been doing for years.

2001
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:44,640
Can we get a remastered version of the orange box on these consoles?

2002
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,280
I buy that again.

2003
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:52,120
And you know, the movie is a good comparison because honestly, people will buy a Disney

2004
01:39:52,120 --> 01:39:53,880
movie that's 90 minutes long.

2005
01:39:53,920 --> 01:39:59,640
They'll buy a $29 Blu-ray of The Lion King and not even give it a second thought.

2006
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:00,960
And it's like a 90 minute movie.

2007
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:05,480
But a movie like that, you can watch over and over and over and over and over and over

2008
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:05,920
and over again.

2009
01:40:05,920 --> 01:40:08,440
And probably, especially if you're a child and never get sick of it, right?

2010
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:10,560
Yeah, but then you're comparing like stories.

2011
01:40:10,720 --> 01:40:16,040
I mean, like I said, if the story of The Order is really, really, really good, then

2012
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:17,280
there's no problem there.

2013
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:22,720
I just, I have a hard time believing that it's like, you know, if the story that would

2014
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:26,960
have to be that good would be like, for me, it would have to be along the lines of like

2015
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:29,480
Bioshock Infinite or something like that.

2016
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:32,880
You know, something really like, wow, you know, that's a really cool story.

2017
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:37,640
So, yeah, and I think the bottom line here and just kind of to try to wrap this subject

2018
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:44,000
up is that I think just because a game is six to eight hours and is $60 doesn't mean

2019
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:49,480
that the game is instantly bad or a bad value and we shouldn't necessarily turn away

2020
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:53,360
and not even try a game because it's only six to eight hours and happens to be $60

2021
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:56,440
because there are a lot of good, compact experiences out there.

2022
01:40:56,640 --> 01:41:00,600
It sounds to me like The Order is just not one of those experiences.

2023
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:05,480
For as hyped as this game was, you know, it might be very pretty and so forth, but the

2024
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:09,360
game, again, from what I'm hearing secondhand, maybe the game just wasn't

2025
01:41:09,360 --> 01:41:10,200
particularly memorable.

2026
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:14,520
It sounds to me that they spent so much time on getting the visuals right on it, that

2027
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:17,600
they ran out of time to make the rest of the game and then they just had to put it up

2028
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:20,280
because it had already been delayed and delayed and delayed.

2029
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:24,640
And now it's just like, well, it's short, but we'll just make it up later in DLC that

2030
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:25,640
we can sell or something.

2031
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:26,240
Yeah.

2032
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:29,920
All right, anyhow, I'm sure there's plenty more to say on this topic, but maybe we'll

2033
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:33,480
take that to the forums for a little bit of a follow up next week.

2034
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,840
Anyhow, I do want to move on, though, because we're running a little long for this

2035
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:37,520
half of the show.

2036
01:41:38,240 --> 01:41:42,920
But excuse me, we have to get to our classic game of the week.

2037
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:49,960
Every week, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game where she's

2038
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:57,720
like, hey, back in my day, you paid $60 to be a little square that would bounce a ball

2039
01:41:58,280 --> 01:41:59,160
and you loved it.

2040
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:02,960
It's the classic game of the week.

2041
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:07,760
Dark Sakura, well, maybe this isn't really a square with a ball, but it is a classic

2042
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:07,800
game.

2043
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:09,640
It's at least 10 years old to qualify.

2044
01:42:09,640 --> 01:42:10,680
It's older than some of you kids.

2045
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:11,240
That's right.

2046
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:13,120
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?

2047
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:14,840
The classic game is Batagun.

2048
01:42:15,440 --> 01:42:21,400
It is a vertical shoot-em-up game that was put up by a developer called Toaplan.

2049
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:26,480
The name translates to exceptional or extraordinary.

2050
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:33,800
It was an arcade game that came out in 1993, and there was a second version that was

2051
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:39,480
shown at the Arcade Operators Union in Japan that never came out because Toaplan went

2052
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:40,240
into bankruptcy.

2053
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:42,920
It was called a Batagun special version.

2054
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:46,760
It appeared, though, on the second-hand market, by the way.

2055
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:56,520
There were two versions out on the Sega Saturn, one in 1996 that was recoded by an

2056
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:58,280
offshoot of Toaplan called Gazelle.

2057
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:05,280
This is the game that many people will say started the bullet hell genre or manic

2058
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:05,680
shooter.

2059
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:13,200
Basically, as the game was being developed, the employees would go up.

2060
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:15,320
Well, let me rephrase this.

2061
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:20,600
People who were involved in the development of the game went on to work at Cave and

2062
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:21,320
made this a thing.

2063
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:29,200
The main programmer of the game was Seneki Ikeda, who had a...

2064
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:36,160
I'd probably say this game, since it's pretty vicious with how hard it can get.

2065
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,200
I need to find this guy and go, why?

2066
01:43:40,200 --> 01:43:47,720
Anyway, the special editions had a few different challenges and had a smaller

2067
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:54,200
hitbox, a shield, more powerful bombs, scoring items, and multiple game rounds or

2068
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:56,080
loops that got harder and harder.

2069
01:43:56,480 --> 01:44:02,440
The Saturn versions were almost the same, but they had a few different things,

2070
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:07,200
including rearranged music and lack of slowdown in some cases.

2071
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:12,320
So it actually, you couldn't rely on the slowdown to give you more time to judge

2072
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:14,000
where your bullets were.

2073
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:17,440
So basically, it's the joystick two-button control.

2074
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:23,760
You have a fire, you have a bomb, and you gain experience points that are separate

2075
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:24,520
from the score.

2076
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:29,440
So every 288 points, your gun will level up and get stronger.

2077
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:34,520
So it's kind of like RPG elements in a shoot-em-up.

2078
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:38,320
The characters, though, were like super fucking generic-looking, as I'll get out.

2079
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:42,920
You had Geno, who actually looks kind of like Trunks from Dragon Ball Z.

2080
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:52,840
And then you have just the generic girl named, I'm going to mispronounce her name,

2081
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:53,800
Beltiana.

2082
01:44:55,280 --> 01:45:01,560
And then you had the other guy who's like the pretty boy, bad boy guy named Iceman,

2083
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:07,720
who's like, I'm sure was a complete rip-off of Val Kilmer's character in Top Gun.

2084
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:13,840
So anyway, you also can get points by collecting these V-shaped medals.

2085
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:17,840
And you get 3,000 points when the thing's finished for every one of those that you

2086
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:20,360
have, and 5,000 points for larger ones.

2087
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:23,760
And then if your ship is destroyed, you lose all your medals.

2088
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:26,120
You get an extra life at 1 million points.

2089
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:30,280
Now, the names of the ships just have the best names, the bad guys.

2090
01:45:32,360 --> 01:45:39,480
You have Deep Purple, Madzilla, Deep Steel Darkness, Jupiter, and Ground of the

2091
01:45:39,480 --> 01:45:40,120
Galaxy.

2092
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:45,240
It's with an R in it for how it was romanized, Galaxy, but I still think it's

2093
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:45,520
awesome.

2094
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:48,920
My favorite, though, is Mad Steel Darkness, because that's just a cool name, and I

2095
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:49,880
would steal that for a band.

2096
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:50,920
So there you go.

2097
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:52,120
Botsugan.

2098
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:58,680
I have to admit, I have not really, I don't have a familiarity with this game until

2099
01:45:58,680 --> 01:45:59,880
you are mentioning it here.

2100
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:04,840
I did not realize this was a game to thank for the bullet hell, but I can definitely

2101
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:05,640
see it in this.

2102
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:06,440
Yep.

2103
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:11,560
Did you see, like, just how, I mean, for as pretty as this game is, and the good

2104
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:15,920
music and really fun that it is, did you see just how absolutely generic the

2105
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:16,560
characters are?

2106
01:46:16,600 --> 01:46:17,160
Yeah.

2107
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:19,480
Seriously, it's like, this guy looks like Trunks.

2108
01:46:19,800 --> 01:46:22,600
This guy looks like, you know, generic anime guy number three.

2109
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:23,800
What year is this from?

2110
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:24,680
1993.

2111
01:46:24,760 --> 01:46:30,440
So yeah, they all have that sort of mid to early 90s anime looking everybody.

2112
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:30,760
It's okay.

2113
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:32,920
I don't, I don't fault the game for that, really.

2114
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:37,800
This is actually a game I'm looking to get on Saturn, but I haven't, um, you

2115
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:40,520
know, when it's come across my path, I haven't had the money for it, so.

2116
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:41,640
All right.

2117
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:42,840
So there you go.

2118
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:44,040
There it is.

2119
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:46,280
Your classic game of the week.

2120
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:49,640
Batsu gun here on orange laundry.

2121
01:46:49,640 --> 01:46:51,560
That's a good, I always say gun though.

2122
01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:52,360
Cause it's a shooter.

2123
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:56,120
Surely you understand where I'm making my mistake.

2124
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:57,480
All right.

2125
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:02,680
Um, dark soccer, what, what, uh, bullet hell shooters do you think we would owe

2126
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:03,240
this game?

2127
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:04,040
Thanks.

2128
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:05,560
Espa galuda.

2129
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:07,000
Because I like saying espa galuda.

2130
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:12,280
I think for a while I was calling it escaped beluga.

2131
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:18,040
Uh, that is going to do it here on orange launch radio for the first half of our

2132
01:47:18,040 --> 01:47:21,000
show, but don't go anywhere because there is plenty more show to come.

2133
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,720
When we come back, we're going to get into the Fugu question of the week, some

2134
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:28,120
rapid fire news, your emails, or maybe it's just email this week and your calls.

2135
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:30,200
We got more OLR, uh, to go.

2136
01:47:30,200 --> 01:47:32,360
We got, and it's already 7 55.

2137
01:47:32,360 --> 01:47:36,200
We got to get going here, uh, to try to get done here by nine o'clock or midnight

2138
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:36,760
on the East coast.

2139
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:38,600
Or I guess we just go along tonight.

2140
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:42,440
We'll find out when we come back with more of OLR right after this.

2141
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:55,320
Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live with our 588th episode on this

2142
01:47:55,320 --> 01:47:59,000
February, the 22nd of 2015.

2143
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,040
And, uh, wow.

2144
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:04,520
I can't believe we're 588 episodes in, which means 600, believe it or not, we're

2145
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:09,240
gonna, we're gonna more than likely get to 600 and 600 is looking on the horizon.

2146
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:12,680
Uh, and the date for that, just if you guys are planning, it looks like it's going to

2147
01:48:12,680 --> 01:48:17,240
be May 24th would be the date that episode 600 is going to fall onto.

2148
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:21,960
Uh, that is assuming there is no more canceled shows after the PAX East week.

2149
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:23,960
Cause obviously if we cancel shows, it gets pushed back.

2150
01:48:23,960 --> 01:48:24,920
Wouldn't that be funny though?

2151
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:29,400
Because if we ended up, if we canceled like four shows, not that I'm saying we

2152
01:48:29,400 --> 01:48:33,000
should do that, but it would, uh, it would actually end up that our 600th episode

2153
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,320
and our 13th anniversary would be on like the same day.

2154
01:48:35,320 --> 01:48:36,600
So that would be kind of funny.

2155
01:48:36,600 --> 01:48:40,200
Uh, but anyway, just for those of you guys, uh, playing along at home, uh, I

2156
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:42,120
don't know if we're going to do anything super big.

2157
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:46,280
We always talk about like, should we do something special for the 10 year, for

2158
01:48:46,280 --> 01:48:49,400
the 500, for the 11 year, should we do something special that we never do?

2159
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:54,760
So 13 is kind of a weird, 13 is kind of a weird one, which, but it's 13.

2160
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:58,120
I mean, you know, that's kind of a lucky number for a lot of people.

2161
01:48:58,120 --> 01:48:58,680
So I don't know.

2162
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:01,480
That would be a, uh, our bar.

2163
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:03,720
Don't we get a bar mitzvah when we turn 13?

2164
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:04,280
That's what we need.

2165
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:05,800
The orange lounge radio bar mitzvah.

2166
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:11,640
Jamie's giving me these looks of like, um, dot, dot, dot.

2167
01:49:12,280 --> 01:49:14,280
Are you going to read from the Torah and Klingon?

2168
01:49:14,280 --> 01:49:15,000
I guess I can.

2169
01:49:16,760 --> 01:49:18,440
Maybe grandpa from Horthouse would be willing.

2170
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:19,480
He probably knows Klingon.

2171
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:20,040
He's a nerd.

2172
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:21,240
True.

2173
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:23,160
You knew where that came from, right?

2174
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:29,080
There was an episode of Frasier where he went to the, to the, uh, bar mitzvah and

2175
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:30,360
read the speech in Klingon.

2176
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:35,400
Uh, actually grandpa's in chat right now saying a Jerry Lewis telethon or Rob

2177
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:36,360
Roberts telethon.

2178
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:42,040
Actually, I'm all about the charity stuff and we have yet to really do a big, big

2179
01:49:42,040 --> 01:49:42,920
charity push.

2180
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:45,960
So that's always a possibility, especially considering if I'm not

2181
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:50,680
mistaking, May 24th would be Memorial day weekend.

2182
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:51,240
Right.

2183
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:53,400
So, or is it the next week?

2184
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:53,800
I don't know.

2185
01:49:54,440 --> 01:49:56,280
Maybe we'll actually kind of fall at a good time.

2186
01:49:56,280 --> 01:49:56,680
We'll see.

2187
01:49:58,120 --> 01:49:58,440
All right.

2188
01:49:58,440 --> 01:50:02,120
Uh, anyway, for now let's get into, maybe that's something we can plan on our

2189
01:50:02,120 --> 01:50:03,080
forums.

2190
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:05,320
Let's do a segment we like to call forum feedback.

2191
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:13,960
If you were not aware, Orange L'Antranio has a forum at the voice of geeks network

2192
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:18,840
vog network.com, uh, over at forums.vog network.com.

2193
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:20,360
That's VOG network.com.

2194
01:50:20,360 --> 01:50:22,760
And I got to say props to you guys this week.

2195
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:27,320
Clap, clap, clap, clap, because now it's not just me making topics.

2196
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:29,000
The listeners are making topics.

2197
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:29,560
Thank you.

2198
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:31,560
And this is starting to take off a little bit.

2199
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:32,840
Who says forums are dead?

2200
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:34,600
You guys are, you guys are helping out in a big way.

2201
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:35,240
Thank you so much.

2202
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:38,200
I want to feature a couple of posts that were made on the forums this week.

2203
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:40,600
I'm actually going to focus.

2204
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:42,680
I can't read every post that's made.

2205
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:47,000
We make posts to have discussions, but I want to at least touch on a couple of the, uh,

2206
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:47,800
listener made ones.

2207
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:53,080
YYR made a post on nostalgia, which had come up in our last episode.

2208
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:55,960
When does nostalgia come up on Orange L'Antranio?

2209
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:56,840
That never happens.

2210
01:50:57,960 --> 01:51:03,720
Anyway, uh, but YYR started a topic on nostalgia, wanting to touch specifically on the discussion

2211
01:51:03,720 --> 01:51:07,640
that happened late in the episode with this, with Sonic and nostalgia.

2212
01:51:07,640 --> 01:51:11,160
I think somebody had made the comment about George RR Martin should kill off all Sonic's

2213
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:11,400
friends.

2214
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:12,280
Remember that?

2215
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:18,920
So the caller that suggested it was akin to chasing that first high may have been onto

2216
01:51:18,920 --> 01:51:22,760
something for some people at least, but while the human body is constantly changing and

2217
01:51:22,760 --> 01:51:27,080
no two drug samples are the same old video games are unique in the fact that they never

2218
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:28,280
change ever.

2219
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:32,520
Every old game is exactly the same as it was all those years ago.

2220
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:36,040
Now, I'm not sure if I'm just different or strange, but in recent times when I've gone

2221
01:51:36,040 --> 01:51:40,520
back and played Mega Man 2, Super Mario World or other favorite games I played as a kid,

2222
01:51:40,520 --> 01:51:42,760
I feel the same joy as I did back then.

2223
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:46,360
Everything is just as I remembered it, and I love revisiting these old classics again

2224
01:51:46,360 --> 01:51:47,000
and again.

2225
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:50,360
This applies even to old Atari or Commodore games.

2226
01:51:50,360 --> 01:51:53,400
I wonder if maybe this is because I've gone back to this stuff every few years.

2227
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:56,040
There hasn't been a huge gap of 15 or 20 years.

2228
01:51:56,040 --> 01:51:58,360
How does everyone else feel when revisiting these old things?

2229
01:51:58,360 --> 01:52:00,920
Rebel Romance replied to this and said,

2230
01:52:28,360 --> 01:52:33,800
Me, when I play Super Mario Brothers 2, and it's a very specific moment in Mario Brothers

2231
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:39,240
2, when I play Super Mario Brothers 2, and I don't use those warp zones, I actually play

2232
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:44,600
the game straight through, and I get to World 1-3 where you fight the boss Mauser.

2233
01:52:44,600 --> 01:52:45,080
Remember that?

2234
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:45,880
Remember the boss Mauser?

2235
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:48,520
Mario 2 had some really awesome characters.

2236
01:52:48,520 --> 01:52:49,560
Never really came back.

2237
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:50,760
Like, there was what?

2238
01:52:50,760 --> 01:52:51,880
Fry Guy and...

2239
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:53,720
Yeah, but those weren't technically...

2240
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:57,560
I know they were part of the whole the Japanese Doki Doki.

2241
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:02,840
But if they can repurpose the Shy Guys...

2242
01:53:02,840 --> 01:53:06,360
Come on, Shy Guys came from that game, and they've been repurposed in all these other

2243
01:53:06,360 --> 01:53:06,920
Mario games.

2244
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:09,160
If they can do that, they can bring back Wart or something.

2245
01:53:09,160 --> 01:53:10,920
I'm waiting for a Mario game where we take him on again.

2246
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:12,200
But anyway, I digress.

2247
01:53:12,760 --> 01:53:20,840
When I play Mauser, I remember that night, and it was New Year's Eve, probably when I

2248
01:53:20,840 --> 01:53:21,960
was 10 years old.

2249
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:25,160
I might be fudging the year a little bit, but I think I was 10 years old on New Year's

2250
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:25,800
Eve.

2251
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:30,520
I stayed up all night because you could do that because it was New Year's Eve, so a 10

2252
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:31,560
year old could be up all night.

2253
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:34,680
That was the one day a year you got to be a total insomniac as a kid, right?

2254
01:53:35,320 --> 01:53:38,040
I stayed up all night trying to beat him.

2255
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:40,360
And I finally did, but I remember it took several tries.

2256
01:53:40,360 --> 01:53:41,160
And I just...

2257
01:53:41,160 --> 01:53:46,040
I don't know, when I play Mauser in Super Mario Brothers 2, I'm taken back to, I'm staying

2258
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:46,840
up all night.

2259
01:53:46,840 --> 01:53:47,720
I'm being bad.

2260
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:49,320
I'm staying up all night and playing video games.

2261
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:50,040
This is what I love.

2262
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:55,080
So I don't know if you guys have any specific moments you remember like that, but that's

2263
01:53:55,400 --> 01:53:55,880
something for me.

2264
01:53:55,880 --> 01:53:58,200
No, but I have a thought about Sonic, though.

2265
01:53:58,200 --> 01:54:02,280
See, the thing is, I think the new series now, Sonic Boom, is they're trying to be very

2266
01:54:02,280 --> 01:54:03,480
formulaic with it.

2267
01:54:03,480 --> 01:54:08,360
Instead of just making a Sonic game and making a good Sonic game, like they did with the

2268
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:12,600
original Sonic games, now it's like, we got to turn it into a franchise.

2269
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:17,240
But not necessarily a franchise that is a video game franchise, but a franchise that

2270
01:54:17,240 --> 01:54:20,360
we can put on lunch boxes and we can sell all this stuff.

2271
01:54:20,360 --> 01:54:24,120
They want to turn it into like a Skylanders or even...

2272
01:54:24,120 --> 01:54:25,560
See, Pac-Man did the same thing.

2273
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:29,080
They turned it into the Ghostly Adventures thing and they're trying to sell the TV show

2274
01:54:29,080 --> 01:54:32,280
to get the kids hooked on it, but kids don't give a shit about it.

2275
01:54:32,280 --> 01:54:33,720
And that's the problem is...

2276
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:37,480
It was kind of when Pac-Man went back to its roots with the Championship Edition and so

2277
01:54:37,480 --> 01:54:40,200
forth, like the original designer had a hand in that, right?

2278
01:54:40,200 --> 01:54:44,760
When you got Pac-Man Battle Royale, these are all like really strong offerings in the

2279
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:45,720
Pac-Man series, right?

2280
01:54:45,720 --> 01:54:49,880
Even like the cartoon, like I've watched some of the cartoon with my son.

2281
01:54:49,880 --> 01:54:52,040
The Ghostly Adventures isn't terrible.

2282
01:54:52,040 --> 01:54:53,960
It's just, I don't know.

2283
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:56,680
I just think Sonic Boom is just kind of way off.

2284
01:54:56,680 --> 01:54:59,640
It's not the same thing, I guess.

2285
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:03,000
It's kind of like how Skylanders isn't Spyro, maybe.

2286
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:06,600
Anyway, I love these type of stories.

2287
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:10,680
And YYR is actually in chat right now saying, that is so specific and it's interesting that

2288
01:55:10,680 --> 01:55:14,360
you remember the positive aspect of that and not the, it took so many tries part.

2289
01:55:14,360 --> 01:55:18,440
You know, also not to get like too deep or whatever, but like, I have serious memory

2290
01:55:18,440 --> 01:55:18,920
problems.

2291
01:55:18,920 --> 01:55:20,120
Just ask Alan about this.

2292
01:55:20,120 --> 01:55:23,000
Like Alan has to remind me of shit all the time.

2293
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
I double book myself constantly.

2294
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:26,760
I forget things all the time.

2295
01:55:26,760 --> 01:55:29,080
Heaven help you if I'm supposed to remember your birthday.

2296
01:55:29,080 --> 01:55:31,160
If it weren't for Facebook, I'd probably forget them all.

2297
01:55:31,160 --> 01:55:33,320
Like I just, I have a horrible memory.

2298
01:55:33,320 --> 01:55:39,560
So when I do have like things like that, that I really cling to another, I'll tell you,

2299
01:55:39,560 --> 01:55:42,760
I'll give you one more since you like that one YYR, I'll give you one more.

2300
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:45,080
And I remember a lot of you when you were younger remember this.

2301
01:55:45,080 --> 01:55:49,640
I remember again, this was a stay up all night slumber party and my friend Devin growing

2302
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:52,920
up his house, we were playing star tropics for the first time.

2303
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:53,960
And he had just got it.

2304
01:55:53,960 --> 01:55:57,000
And we were playing, I swear to God, we were playing that game all fucking night.

2305
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:00,360
And we got to the part where you had to have the letter.

2306
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:06,760
And I swear to God, I can't remember what I did last week, but I can remember the layout

2307
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:09,880
of Devin's kitchen going to get the jar.

2308
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:13,160
Cause it was like, it was like an old school, like Mason jar type of thing that we got.

2309
01:56:13,160 --> 01:56:17,800
We filled with water and put that letter in there so that you could see that code that

2310
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:18,920
actually came up on there.

2311
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:23,240
So anyway, I do, I have these like really random ass memories in gaming.

2312
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:25,800
So when things like that come up, I cling to them.

2313
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:29,960
Or in case you don't have the mail cause you bought the game used and you have to call

2314
01:56:29,960 --> 01:56:31,400
Nintendo hint line.

2315
01:56:31,400 --> 01:56:35,880
They're like, well, I just put the letter in the, in, in, in the, uh, in water.

2316
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:37,320
I'm like, what letter?

2317
01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:38,680
And their letter came with the manual.

2318
01:56:38,680 --> 01:56:39,800
I don't have the manual.

2319
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:40,120
Okay.

2320
01:56:40,120 --> 01:56:41,480
The code seven 67.

2321
01:56:41,480 --> 01:56:43,880
Oh my gosh.

2322
01:56:43,880 --> 01:56:45,320
Uh, why, why are I'm sorry?

2323
01:56:45,320 --> 01:56:46,200
Seven 47.

2324
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:50,360
I have to write everything down or ask people to remind me, but I will always remember how

2325
01:56:50,360 --> 01:56:52,680
to get through the beams of the quick man stage.

2326
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:53,000
Yes.

2327
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:54,920
I am high fiving you from California.

2328
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:55,240
Yes.

2329
01:56:55,240 --> 01:56:56,520
I totally remember that.

2330
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:56,760
Okay.

2331
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:57,560
You want one more story?

2332
01:56:57,560 --> 01:56:58,120
One more story.

2333
01:56:58,120 --> 01:56:59,560
Rob was literally doing that by the way.

2334
01:56:59,560 --> 01:57:02,040
I, I don't lie here on OLR.

2335
01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:06,760
I also remember getting in a heap shit ton of trouble in the fifth grade.

2336
01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:10,600
I got busted because the teacher was trying to teach.

2337
01:57:11,160 --> 01:57:14,280
Which is ironic now that I'm also a teacher, but the teacher was trying to teach and I

2338
01:57:14,280 --> 01:57:19,080
wasn't having it because I just got the latest episode of Nintendo power or at least episode

2339
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:23,080
latest issue of Nintendo power with Simon Belmont on the cover.

2340
01:57:23,080 --> 01:57:26,440
It was that very controversial cover on, if you remember, I got that and I brought it

2341
01:57:26,440 --> 01:57:30,280
to school and, um, I was showing one of my friends while she was trying to teach and

2342
01:57:30,280 --> 01:57:31,160
she got so pissed.

2343
01:57:31,160 --> 01:57:32,360
She took it away from me.

2344
01:57:32,360 --> 01:57:36,840
But what's funny about that memory is that what was on the cover, which if I remember

2345
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:39,800
why it was kind of a graphic decapitation was on the cover.

2346
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:40,840
That wasn't an issue.

2347
01:57:41,800 --> 01:57:43,720
I never got in trouble over that.

2348
01:57:43,720 --> 01:57:46,520
I got in trouble for bringing literature to school.

2349
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:50,120
Nowadays, you'd be like supporting, you know, terrorism or something like that.

2350
01:57:50,120 --> 01:57:52,440
And they arrest you.

2351
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:52,840
Anyway.

2352
01:57:53,640 --> 01:57:55,720
YYR says, wasn't that the second issue ever?

2353
01:57:55,720 --> 01:57:57,640
It was one of the first five for sure.

2354
01:57:58,200 --> 01:57:59,240
It might've been the second one.

2355
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:01,000
It was, it was an early one for sure.

2356
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:01,640
For sure.

2357
01:58:01,640 --> 01:58:05,080
Anyway, uh, moving on, uh, let's get to it now.

2358
01:58:05,080 --> 01:58:08,120
You know what the payback I get for that is, by the way, when I'm trying to teach class

2359
01:58:08,120 --> 01:58:12,280
and people are on the fucking internet while I'm trying to teach, teach a class anyway,

2360
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:18,040
uh, going to another topic from our forums one more tonight where a Flacco Jones has

2361
01:58:18,040 --> 01:58:23,000
started a topic on video games, genre mashups, uh, because, uh, he was talking about that.

2362
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:26,840
We had the guys from Star Mazer on last week, which by the way, congrats.

2363
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:28,280
They made their Kickstarter goal.

2364
01:58:28,280 --> 01:58:30,440
And I'd like to think we helped a little bit.

2365
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:33,560
Surely their own telethons and they did like a 24 hour thing on Friday.

2366
01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:37,080
That was probably a big part of it, but they not only hit their goal, they did make it

2367
01:58:37,080 --> 01:58:43,240
to 180,000, which was their first stretch goal for, um, bringing in more musical talent.

2368
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:46,280
So some of those great names that they were talking about are going to be on this soundtrack.

2369
01:58:46,280 --> 01:58:48,440
So congrats to those guys from Star Mazer.

2370
01:58:48,440 --> 01:58:52,440
But, uh, Flacco Jones had been listening to the interview and said, I was intrigued by

2371
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:54,920
the merging of point and click and shmup genres.

2372
01:58:54,920 --> 01:58:58,520
And I wanted to know what other genre mashups the listeners could come up with.

2373
01:58:58,520 --> 01:58:59,320
I'll start.

2374
01:58:59,320 --> 01:59:03,080
When I interviewed with Konami to be a game tester years ago, one of the questions they

2375
01:59:03,080 --> 01:59:05,240
asked me was, what is your favorite type of video game?

2376
01:59:05,240 --> 01:59:09,080
And I answered, I like RPGs and sports games the most.

2377
01:59:09,080 --> 01:59:11,880
The interview commented that he never heard that combination before.

2378
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:15,080
And that got me thinking about not the individual genres, but combining them.

2379
01:59:15,080 --> 01:59:16,680
Well, I don't play them as much anymore.

2380
01:59:16,680 --> 01:59:20,200
One of the things I liked most about playing sports games was career mode.

2381
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:24,200
If there even was one now take that concept and really expand it to incorporate elements

2382
01:59:24,200 --> 01:59:28,280
of RPGs, where you upgrade your character skills, not just through combat or playing

2383
01:59:28,280 --> 01:59:31,640
the games in this case, but through all sorts of other methods, such as interaction with

2384
01:59:31,640 --> 01:59:33,960
other characters, side quests, and so on.

2385
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:38,440
If during your career mode, your athlete makes a blunder on social media, for example, they

2386
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:40,280
actually lose stats.

2387
01:59:40,280 --> 01:59:44,200
There's a ton of possibilities beyond just playing a sporting event and getting better

2388
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:46,600
or worse throughout the season or career.

2389
01:59:46,600 --> 01:59:51,080
Now, Bobby Black Wolf joined in and followed this up saying, you know, the NCAA football

2390
01:59:51,080 --> 01:59:52,040
games did that for a while.

2391
01:59:52,040 --> 01:59:55,400
You'd have to schedule your off time and that affected your stats the next game.

2392
01:59:55,400 --> 01:59:57,640
Spend free time studying raises your awareness.

2393
01:59:57,640 --> 01:59:59,800
Spend time into the gym raises your toughness.

2394
01:59:59,800 --> 02:00:02,280
Spend time with your girlfriend distresses you.

2395
02:00:02,280 --> 02:00:05,720
In your dorm room, you would even have a picture of your current girlfriend.

2396
02:00:05,720 --> 02:00:08,440
And as you got better, you got hotter girlfriends.

2397
02:00:08,440 --> 02:00:10,200
Well, that's interesting, but okay.

2398
02:00:11,560 --> 02:00:15,160
You can then take that character and import them into Madden, which would take his stats.

2399
02:00:15,160 --> 02:00:18,440
And then Madden also has stuff like press interviews and coach interactions.

2400
02:00:18,440 --> 02:00:20,120
It's very basic, but the groundwork is there.

2401
02:00:20,120 --> 02:00:25,240
They even simulate Twitter now where you can see ESPN pundits and fans tweeting about your

2402
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:26,440
action on the field.

2403
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:29,480
Oh my gosh.

2404
02:00:30,120 --> 02:00:33,640
And then YYR said, has there been a combined fighting music game yet?

2405
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:36,360
Like if you hit enemies off beat, they barely flinch.

2406
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:39,880
But if you punch them perfectly on beat, they explode into bloody chunks.

2407
02:00:39,880 --> 02:00:44,200
Not so much that, but Def Jam Icon was a fighting game set to music.

2408
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:48,440
See, and Bobby Black Wolf has suggested Kickbeat to that actually as well.

2409
02:00:49,160 --> 02:00:53,640
And YYR said, Kickbeat's kind of a rhythm game at its core, but I meant something like

2410
02:00:53,640 --> 02:00:57,000
you have free control over your character and their attacks, like final fight.

2411
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,840
But the timing of the attack matters.

2412
02:00:58,840 --> 02:01:00,680
Also bloody explosions, very important.

2413
02:01:00,680 --> 02:01:05,080
Def Jam Icon, but it wasn't bloody explosions, but it would like, if you hit stuff on the

2414
02:01:05,080 --> 02:01:07,000
beat, then it would do more damage.

2415
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:07,800
In a way.

2416
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:14,840
I mean, I don't, this is kind of out there, but go back to the old school Kung Fu on the

2417
02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:15,960
8-bit NES.

2418
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:17,400
Do you remember Kung Fu?

2419
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:20,760
Like it was like a side scroller and you were going up the different stories to, I don't

2420
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:23,320
know, rescue your girlfriend who was on the fifth floor or something like that.

2421
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:27,240
You know, there was a pattern to the way those enemies would show up.

2422
02:01:27,240 --> 02:01:30,840
And for some people you would kind of get it to the music, right?

2423
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:36,600
So in a way, like a game like Kung Fu, you could probably memorize some of the patterns

2424
02:01:36,600 --> 02:01:38,760
of the guys that come out to the music.

2425
02:01:38,760 --> 02:01:43,320
I don't know, but I think I kind of just like maybe the concept is rooted in there somewhere,

2426
02:01:43,320 --> 02:01:45,800
somewhere, but of course we need more bloody explosions.

2427
02:01:45,800 --> 02:01:47,560
I completely understand that.

2428
02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:52,680
Anyway, great suggestions, great suggestions on the forums.

2429
02:01:52,680 --> 02:01:53,720
I love these posts.

2430
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:54,280
Post more.

2431
02:01:54,280 --> 02:01:55,240
You guys are doing awesome.

2432
02:01:55,240 --> 02:01:57,240
Forums.vognetwork.com.

2433
02:01:57,240 --> 02:02:00,760
Don't be shy, but remember I can't read everything on air because I've already spent 15 minutes

2434
02:02:00,760 --> 02:02:05,160
reading that and we got to get into some more segments like our rapid fire news.

2435
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:05,800
Loki.

2436
02:02:05,800 --> 02:02:09,800
Yeah, it's funny that you mentioned Star Tropics because this story actually has to do with

2437
02:02:09,800 --> 02:02:10,920
Star Tropics.

2438
02:02:10,920 --> 02:02:18,200
Apparently this guy named Brad Smith was playing Star Tropics and noticed that there was something

2439
02:02:18,200 --> 02:02:25,160
kind of funky about the sound in the game and actually went through and edited the ROM

2440
02:02:25,160 --> 02:02:31,720
to fix the problem, to basically fix, there was like this little bit of, I don't know

2441
02:02:31,720 --> 02:02:36,440
what you'd call it, like part of the melody or whatever that cuts out in the game that

2442
02:02:36,440 --> 02:02:40,680
comes back later on in like the overworld and it just sounds weird.

2443
02:02:40,680 --> 02:02:45,960
So he found out what it was and, you know, edited some code errors in there.

2444
02:02:45,960 --> 02:02:51,560
Now it plays fine, but it's kind of cool that people go back and bug fix stuff, you

2445
02:02:51,560 --> 02:02:53,640
know, from a long time ago.

2446
02:02:53,640 --> 02:02:56,360
Kind of like how they remember the ET and made ET better.

2447
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:57,160
That was pretty cool.

2448
02:02:59,240 --> 02:03:00,840
And then this is kind of funny.

2449
02:03:02,200 --> 02:03:06,920
Did you know that there was a Carmen Sandiego game that took place entirely in North Dakota?

2450
02:03:07,960 --> 02:03:12,040
Yes, there was a Where in North Dakota is Carmen Sandiego.

2451
02:03:12,040 --> 02:03:15,160
I believe that I brought this up when I actually covered Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego.

2452
02:03:15,160 --> 02:03:16,120
Did you really?

2453
02:03:16,120 --> 02:03:17,400
I don't, I didn't remember it.

2454
02:03:17,400 --> 02:03:18,200
I believe I did.

2455
02:03:18,200 --> 02:03:18,680
Oh, maybe.

2456
02:03:19,400 --> 02:03:23,800
It actually happened a few other places were able to license the character for doing a

2457
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:26,360
local edutainment games.

2458
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:28,760
Is this something making the blog rounds again this week or something?

2459
02:03:28,760 --> 02:03:29,320
Yes.

2460
02:03:29,320 --> 02:03:30,040
Okay, I got it.

2461
02:03:30,680 --> 02:03:35,080
But they actually had like a review that was done of the game and kind of showing it and

2462
02:03:35,080 --> 02:03:36,360
it looked like it was pretty decent.

2463
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:41,480
Yeah, originally there were supposed to be 20 different states kind of trying to license

2464
02:03:41,480 --> 02:03:45,400
their own versions of the game, but it never ended up happening.

2465
02:03:45,400 --> 02:03:51,320
So let me think if she's in North Dakota, she's probably in, I don't know, Bismarck

2466
02:03:51,320 --> 02:03:53,080
because where else are you going to go in North Dakota?

2467
02:03:54,440 --> 02:03:57,640
Well, there's lots of different cities there.

2468
02:03:57,640 --> 02:03:58,840
So she's in a field.

2469
02:03:59,960 --> 02:04:00,520
I'm kidding.

2470
02:04:00,520 --> 02:04:01,000
I'm kidding.

2471
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:04,840
I don't want angry North Dakotans messaging me, but apparently, yeah, you can actually,

2472
02:04:04,840 --> 02:04:05,880
I think, download the game.

2473
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:14,120
They were saying that it's on Asimov's Apple II FTP, which is ftp.apple.asimov.net.

2474
02:04:15,640 --> 02:04:16,440
So that's kind of cool.

2475
02:04:17,640 --> 02:04:22,840
And then this is where in North Dakota is Carmen Sandiego Bismarck.

2476
02:04:23,480 --> 02:04:24,680
She's in Bismarck.

2477
02:04:27,240 --> 02:04:29,640
Anyways, I'm singing way too much on tonight's show.

2478
02:04:29,640 --> 02:04:30,680
I apologize.

2479
02:04:30,680 --> 02:04:32,040
I apologize.

2480
02:04:32,040 --> 02:04:32,760
It's very sweet.

2481
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:38,680
This is one of the old shareware games I used to love back in the 90s, Raptor Call of the

2482
02:04:38,680 --> 02:04:39,320
Shadows.

2483
02:04:39,320 --> 02:04:46,200
It was a shmup game that came out, and now they have a brand new kind of addition of

2484
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:55,160
it, the 2015 edition on Steam that you can get for $4.49, and it brings back, was it

2485
02:04:55,160 --> 02:04:56,120
27 levels?

2486
02:04:56,120 --> 02:05:02,520
And I want to say, was this Apogee or, I don't remember who made this, but it was

2487
02:05:02,520 --> 02:05:03,720
awesome, so go check it out.

2488
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:09,960
And it had a mode, and they had like, I wonder if the Easter eggs are still in there, because

2489
02:05:09,960 --> 02:05:13,800
they had a mode with like, if you played it on the developer's birthday or something,

2490
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:18,520
like the enemies became lizards and stuff, and it would have like funny music and, I

2491
02:05:18,520 --> 02:05:18,840
don't know.

2492
02:05:20,360 --> 02:05:26,920
All right, well, moving on to, this isn't so much a classic video game, but it's definitely

2493
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:31,640
a classic board game that does have a video game adaptation.

2494
02:05:31,640 --> 02:05:33,080
A lot of people really love this game.

2495
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:35,000
It shows up in a lot of board game parties.

2496
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
It's Settlers of Catan.

2497
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:42,200
Settlers of Catan apparently has been optioned to be made into a movie or TV show.

2498
02:05:42,200 --> 02:05:42,920
What?

2499
02:05:42,920 --> 02:05:43,320
Right?

2500
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:45,160
This is gonna be weird.

2501
02:05:45,160 --> 02:05:50,360
Producer Gail Katz, known for movies like Pawn Sacrifice, Air Force One, and The Perfect

2502
02:05:50,360 --> 02:05:55,880
Storm, bought the film and television rights for Settlers of Catan, saying she's excited

2503
02:05:55,880 --> 02:05:59,720
by vivid, visual, exciting, and timeless world of Catan.

2504
02:06:00,680 --> 02:06:05,080
Now, the weird thing is, there's really no plot to Settlers of Catan, so...

2505
02:06:06,040 --> 02:06:08,840
It's all about trading your sheep for wood or...

2506
02:06:08,840 --> 02:06:11,880
But at the same time, that means there's a lot you can do with it.

2507
02:06:11,880 --> 02:06:17,640
So, I don't know, Clue was a board game, is like one of the best movies ever.

2508
02:06:18,360 --> 02:06:20,280
So, but then there's also Battleship.

2509
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:22,120
So, I'm hoping...

2510
02:06:22,120 --> 02:06:26,680
But the problem is like, whenever I hear that they're licensing like some sort of fantasy

2511
02:06:26,680 --> 02:06:33,720
or medieval like genre game, it's just like, hey, we want to try to be the next Game of

2512
02:06:33,720 --> 02:06:35,720
Thrones, and that's what I always worry about.

2513
02:06:35,720 --> 02:06:37,000
No, I hope not.

2514
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:40,760
It's just like, I don't know, there's not really a story to Settlers of Catan.

2515
02:06:40,760 --> 02:06:44,920
Unless you do like something like ridiculous, like it's a bunch of people that play Settlers

2516
02:06:44,920 --> 02:06:49,240
of Catan professionally or something like that, then maybe there'd be some silly movie

2517
02:06:49,240 --> 02:06:51,160
out of that, but I don't see it.

2518
02:06:51,880 --> 02:06:54,760
Anyhow, the Xbox One, the screenshots.

2519
02:06:54,760 --> 02:06:58,920
We talked about this, I think, a couple weeks ago on the show because there was a tweet

2520
02:06:58,920 --> 02:07:01,080
or something that had gone out from Phil Spencer.

2521
02:07:01,080 --> 02:07:04,200
However, this week it's rolling out to beta testers.

2522
02:07:04,200 --> 02:07:10,200
It's going to be part of the March system update, and this will allow you to say, Xbox,

2523
02:07:10,200 --> 02:07:14,520
take a screenshot, you know, if you have that Kinect, or you can double tap the Xbox button

2524
02:07:14,520 --> 02:07:17,480
on the controller and then press Y to take a picture.

2525
02:07:17,480 --> 02:07:21,400
There's a little demo video that shows how it works, but it's just a screenshot, y'all.

2526
02:07:21,400 --> 02:07:22,600
It's not that complicated.

2527
02:07:22,600 --> 02:07:23,960
Glad to hear you're getting that feature.

2528
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:31,720
And lastly, a video game hall of fame being created at the National Museum of Play, another

2529
02:07:31,720 --> 02:07:36,760
term, I guess another way to call the strong, which is the folks that are behind this,

2530
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:39,080
museumofplay.org.

2531
02:07:39,080 --> 02:07:44,760
It's a New York-based outfit, and they are considering any game, basically, right now

2532
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:49,000
for its freshman class of World Video Game Hall of Fame honorees.

2533
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:52,760
It could be arcade, console, computer, handheld, or mobile.

2534
02:07:53,640 --> 02:07:57,800
Visit the Strong's website and make a case for why it is your choice.

2535
02:07:58,600 --> 02:08:03,480
I guess the website for that is worldvideogamehalloffame.org

2536
02:08:03,480 --> 02:08:06,440
slash nominate, so you can check that out.

2537
02:08:06,440 --> 02:08:13,400
So, quickly, what video game are we going to ask the OL Army to go nominate?

2538
02:08:14,520 --> 02:08:19,320
What video game do we believe they should be nominating into the Hall of Fame?

2539
02:08:19,320 --> 02:08:21,160
I was going to say President Cat.

2540
02:08:21,240 --> 02:08:21,740
No.

2541
02:08:23,480 --> 02:08:24,760
Duh, The Guardian Legend.

2542
02:08:25,960 --> 02:08:27,560
I could support The Guardian Legend.

2543
02:08:28,280 --> 02:08:30,520
Very overlooked classic on the NES.

2544
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:31,880
Loki, you okay with that?

2545
02:08:31,880 --> 02:08:32,520
I'm fine with that.

2546
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:33,480
Alright, The Guardian Legend.

2547
02:08:33,480 --> 02:08:34,920
That or Miss World Nude Nights.

2548
02:08:40,600 --> 02:08:42,040
Both are classics in their own right.

2549
02:08:44,760 --> 02:08:48,520
Go ye fourth listeners, make it work, make it happen.

2550
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:52,840
Get either The Guardian Legend or Miss Nude World 96.

2551
02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:55,160
Come on Dark Soccer, you have to admit that's a pretty good choice.

2552
02:08:55,160 --> 02:08:55,660
No.

2553
02:08:55,960 --> 02:08:57,640
Everybody, move your body.

2554
02:08:57,640 --> 02:08:58,280
Guardian Legend.

2555
02:08:59,080 --> 02:08:59,640
There is nothing else.

2556
02:08:59,640 --> 02:09:01,080
It's a singing episode, it's a musical episode.

2557
02:09:01,080 --> 02:09:01,960
There is nothing else.

2558
02:09:03,160 --> 02:09:06,760
I don't know, I might go nominate Miss Nude World 96 now.

2559
02:09:06,760 --> 02:09:07,260
Alright.

2560
02:09:09,320 --> 02:09:12,200
Alright, Dark Soccer, if you want you can change the topic with some more news.

2561
02:09:12,840 --> 02:09:13,340
Spawn.

2562
02:09:13,340 --> 02:09:19,900
Uh, yes, there is a topic that was discussed with Todd McFarlane

2563
02:09:20,540 --> 02:09:26,300
as if Spawn was going to be showing up in the new Mortal Kombat game.

2564
02:09:27,660 --> 02:09:31,340
He said that they have access to use Spawn if they want to.

2565
02:09:31,340 --> 02:09:32,300
It's up to them.

2566
02:09:32,300 --> 02:09:36,060
He gave them a window of time, so if they want to, it could happen.

2567
02:09:37,420 --> 02:09:38,140
So, we'll see.

2568
02:09:38,140 --> 02:09:47,740
In other news, Nintendo has happy, happy fun stuff going on with the 25th anniversary of Fire Emblem.

2569
02:09:47,740 --> 02:09:50,540
They're doing a symphony concert in Japan.

2570
02:09:50,540 --> 02:09:57,340
This is going to be taking place, uh, looking at Tokyo Dome City Hall between July 24th and 25th.

2571
02:09:58,140 --> 02:10:01,660
And, uh, someone give me a ticket so I can go.

2572
02:10:03,340 --> 02:10:03,840
Please.

2573
02:10:04,300 --> 02:10:05,420
I'm begging a little bit.

2574
02:10:05,980 --> 02:10:09,820
And then, last but not least, houses for, uh, card games.

2575
02:10:09,820 --> 02:10:10,940
Exploding Kittens!

2576
02:10:11,660 --> 02:10:17,180
Exploding Kittens, put out by the oatmeal, has broken all Kickstarter records.

2577
02:10:18,460 --> 02:10:27,180
They raised 8.78 million dollars with, uh, 219,382 backers.

2578
02:10:28,540 --> 02:10:29,020
So...

2579
02:10:29,020 --> 02:10:29,660
I'm one of them.

2580
02:10:31,340 --> 02:10:34,140
You get to have Exploding Kittens as a card game.

2581
02:10:34,220 --> 02:10:36,700
And the NSFW deck, which you know, like,

2582
02:10:36,700 --> 02:10:41,740
I think, seriously, like, 90% of the people who backed it opted for the NSFW deck.

2583
02:10:41,740 --> 02:10:43,020
Because we're all perverts.

2584
02:10:43,660 --> 02:10:44,540
You know what?

2585
02:10:44,540 --> 02:10:45,040
What?

2586
02:10:45,500 --> 02:10:49,500
The oatmeal has been behind another Kickstarter that I think actually was a little bit more,

2587
02:10:50,780 --> 02:10:53,820
I would say, important than Exploding Kittens.

2588
02:10:55,100 --> 02:10:57,980
There was the funding out for a Nikola Tesla museum.

2589
02:10:58,940 --> 02:10:59,580
Oh, I remember that.

2590
02:10:59,580 --> 02:11:00,860
IndieGoGo, yeah, I remember that.

2591
02:11:01,580 --> 02:11:05,580
Which actually, um, had a contribution by Elon Musk of Tesla Motors.

2592
02:11:06,380 --> 02:11:07,340
So, same.

2593
02:11:08,700 --> 02:11:10,940
But Exploding Kittens, Dark Soccer, it's...

2594
02:11:10,940 --> 02:11:11,260
Rob!

2595
02:11:12,780 --> 02:11:13,100
Fine!

2596
02:11:13,100 --> 02:11:14,860
Then when I get my deck, you can't play.

2597
02:11:16,140 --> 02:11:16,640
All right.

2598
02:11:17,500 --> 02:11:20,220
We're gonna get to the Fugu question of the week, but I just wanted to, uh,

2599
02:11:20,220 --> 02:11:24,300
I wanted to mention to Loki, you know, because we were joking about Miss Nude World 96.

2600
02:11:24,300 --> 02:11:28,060
Do you know what I just realized as I was walking to the kitchen and getting some water?

2601
02:11:28,060 --> 02:11:29,580
This is gonna be the 20th anniversary.

2602
02:11:29,580 --> 02:11:32,780
The 20th anniversary is next year.

2603
02:11:32,780 --> 02:11:34,460
I feel like we should celebrate.

2604
02:11:35,900 --> 02:11:37,340
Well, you know what that means.

2605
02:11:37,340 --> 02:11:39,420
Strippers in Miss New World 96.

2606
02:11:39,420 --> 02:11:44,140
Rob, the moment you said that, the line popped into my head from Resident Evil.

2607
02:11:44,140 --> 02:11:46,220
I feel like we're having a secret meeting.

2608
02:11:48,380 --> 02:11:56,300
It's gonna be one weird, one weird cam show on, uh, on, was it that PlayStation thing?

2609
02:11:56,300 --> 02:11:58,780
That's every week here at OLR is a secret meeting.

2610
02:11:59,420 --> 02:12:02,460
All right, let's get to the Fugu question of the week.

2611
02:12:10,460 --> 02:12:11,820
You guys know the drill by now.

2612
02:12:11,820 --> 02:12:16,780
You take Facebook, you take Google Plus, you slam it together, and you get Fugu.

2613
02:12:16,780 --> 02:12:21,340
And every week we ask a question of our, uh, Facebook and Google Plus communities,

2614
02:12:21,340 --> 02:12:25,020
uh, that we will check out the responses here.

2615
02:12:25,020 --> 02:12:28,620
Uh, I guess I could read them all tonight because, uh, very few of you responded over

2616
02:12:28,620 --> 02:12:29,420
on Google Plus.

2617
02:12:29,420 --> 02:12:31,260
Remember it was getting, it was like a tie last week.

2618
02:12:31,260 --> 02:12:34,860
It was like three and three, but this week Facebook decided to be kind to us and showed

2619
02:12:34,860 --> 02:12:35,740
the post to more people.

2620
02:12:35,740 --> 02:12:40,220
So we only got one answer on Google Plus to this question and it's about Killer Queen.

2621
02:12:40,780 --> 02:12:45,020
No, not the infamous Queen song, uh, although that is awesome too.

2622
02:12:45,020 --> 02:12:47,660
And I would sing it for you, but I've hit my quotient for the night.

2623
02:12:47,660 --> 02:12:51,100
However, it's the arcade game that Dark Soccer was talking about earlier.

2624
02:12:51,100 --> 02:12:54,540
Now this had us thinking about multiplayer arcade experiences.

2625
02:12:54,620 --> 02:12:56,780
This is a 10 player arcade game, right?

2626
02:12:56,780 --> 02:12:59,660
So many of you grew up in or around arcades.

2627
02:12:59,660 --> 02:13:04,300
What was an epic multiplayer experience that you remember from playing in the arcade?

2628
02:13:04,300 --> 02:13:07,500
This can be recent or this can be a long time ago.

2629
02:13:07,500 --> 02:13:11,500
You know, as an example, Dark Soccer, Loki and I, we all met playing DDR, which, you

2630
02:13:11,500 --> 02:13:15,420
know, wasn't necessarily a multiplayer game, but that was absolutely an experience.

2631
02:13:15,420 --> 02:13:16,940
But that usually led to other stuff.

2632
02:13:16,940 --> 02:13:20,860
Like I remember Dark Soccer and I one night going to town on the grid, which was like

2633
02:13:20,860 --> 02:13:22,700
around the corner from DDR.

2634
02:13:23,660 --> 02:13:25,020
Yeah, it looked like a fun game.

2635
02:13:25,020 --> 02:13:25,900
Yeah, we played that.

2636
02:13:25,900 --> 02:13:29,500
Anyway, so I was wondering if you guys had some like multiplayer experiences as well.

2637
02:13:29,500 --> 02:13:30,540
Sumo game.

2638
02:13:30,540 --> 02:13:35,420
The, oh God, that wasn't really a multiplayer game, but yeah, it was definitely a, we all

2639
02:13:35,420 --> 02:13:37,500
stood around it and went the fuck?

2640
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:40,060
Well, you know what we had when I worked in an arcade?

2641
02:13:40,060 --> 02:13:41,020
Run and gun.

2642
02:13:41,020 --> 02:13:42,060
Oh yeah.

2643
02:13:42,060 --> 02:13:43,980
All right, let's get to some of the listener responses here.

2644
02:13:44,700 --> 02:13:50,060
Act Deft is our lone Google Plus reply tonight saying, I remember the Suzuka eight hours

2645
02:13:50,140 --> 02:13:53,740
machines with four bikes and a main screen in the middle so anyone could watch what every

2646
02:13:53,740 --> 02:13:54,780
player was watching.

2647
02:13:54,780 --> 02:13:57,900
I also remember the Super Street Fighter two tournament edition cabs.

2648
02:13:57,900 --> 02:13:59,580
Those were really cool.

2649
02:13:59,580 --> 02:14:04,300
Yeah, Street Fighter two in some ways really just like lit the multiplayer stuff, you know,

2650
02:14:04,300 --> 02:14:05,580
on fire in the arcades.

2651
02:14:05,580 --> 02:14:09,100
Like at least for my youth, that was such a huge part of it.

2652
02:14:09,660 --> 02:14:13,900
I don't think you can even have a conversation about multiplayer arcade games without mentioning

2653
02:14:13,900 --> 02:14:14,940
Street Fighter two.

2654
02:14:15,900 --> 02:14:20,940
Ragenator replies over on Facebook saying, for me it was playing Samurai Shodown 4, Amakusa's

2655
02:14:20,940 --> 02:14:26,060
Revenge on a four slot Neo Geo MVS at my former college's coffee house.

2656
02:14:26,060 --> 02:14:29,660
We had the same regulars playing that game constantly against each other and it was a

2657
02:14:29,660 --> 02:14:30,060
blast.

2658
02:14:30,700 --> 02:14:35,420
Andy R says, I remember when Blaze Blue first came out and Sunnyvale Golf Land was pretty

2659
02:14:35,420 --> 02:14:37,020
much the only place that had it.

2660
02:14:37,020 --> 02:14:39,820
My friends and I journeyed up there from school to play it.

2661
02:14:39,820 --> 02:14:43,260
It was about a three hour drive and after we had fun with the game, one of my friends

2662
02:14:43,260 --> 02:14:46,140
was joking about buying the arcade board for the game.

2663
02:14:46,140 --> 02:14:49,980
We would end up doing the trip again for DJ Max Technica, rest in peace.

2664
02:14:49,980 --> 02:14:51,260
Hey Andy R, you know what?

2665
02:14:51,260 --> 02:14:55,420
We hear you because we used to make that same trip to Sunnyvale Golf Land to play Beatmania

2666
02:14:55,420 --> 02:14:56,300
2DX.

2667
02:14:56,300 --> 02:15:00,300
So actually back in the day, we used to drive to Arcade Infinity.

2668
02:15:00,300 --> 02:15:04,300
That's about a six hour drive from Sacramento to go to LA and play all the, we would go

2669
02:15:04,300 --> 02:15:06,620
to Korea town to play the stuff there.

2670
02:15:07,420 --> 02:15:09,260
Oh, good times, good times.

2671
02:15:09,260 --> 02:15:12,460
This is like, I can't imagine road tripping for an arcade anymore these days.

2672
02:15:13,580 --> 02:15:16,300
Red The Haze replies and says, mine would be virtual on.

2673
02:15:17,020 --> 02:15:20,220
My friend and I tried it for the first time a few years ago and we got really hooked and

2674
02:15:20,220 --> 02:15:24,220
dropped more than $10, which was a lot for us poor college students back then.

2675
02:15:24,220 --> 02:15:27,740
Now I regret not picking up those twin sticks for the Dreamcast when I saw them at a local

2676
02:15:27,740 --> 02:15:28,700
game store.

2677
02:15:28,700 --> 02:15:32,700
Degenerate Johnny replies and says, back when I lived in Detroit as a kid, my friends and

2678
02:15:32,700 --> 02:15:35,660
I treated our local arcade comic book store as a second home.

2679
02:15:35,660 --> 02:15:40,140
We often finished multiplayer games in one sitting, X-Men, Simpsons, Ninja Turtles, so

2680
02:15:40,140 --> 02:15:40,540
on.

2681
02:15:40,540 --> 02:15:44,860
However, none stood out more than the summer day in 1994 when the arcade received its latest

2682
02:15:44,860 --> 02:15:47,980
game, Aliens vs. Predator from Capcom.

2683
02:15:47,980 --> 02:15:48,700
Hell yeah.

2684
02:15:48,700 --> 02:15:52,700
Once the owner plugged in the game, my friends and I were on it like shit on Velcro.

2685
02:15:53,260 --> 02:15:57,340
After hours of dumping quarters, we finally beat this intense four player beat-em-up.

2686
02:15:57,340 --> 02:16:00,220
It was a truly epic moment in our early gaming lives.

2687
02:16:00,220 --> 02:16:04,300
What made it more epic was that the game made us stay up till midnight, first time for me.

2688
02:16:04,300 --> 02:16:08,540
Punishment from our parents followed, of course, for this 10 year old, but was worth it.

2689
02:16:08,540 --> 02:16:15,340
Oh my God, you were 10 out in Detroit until midnight playing Aliens vs. Predator?

2690
02:16:17,980 --> 02:16:19,980
That's, that's, oh my God.

2691
02:16:21,660 --> 02:16:22,860
I would have spanked you.

2692
02:16:24,620 --> 02:16:25,100
All right.

2693
02:16:26,220 --> 02:16:27,580
And not in the sexy way.

2694
02:16:28,140 --> 02:16:31,980
SSJ100 Matt replies and says, Killer Queen is an amazing game.

2695
02:16:31,980 --> 02:16:35,340
It was at MAGFest this year and it was easily the most popular arcade game in the whole

2696
02:16:35,340 --> 02:16:36,060
weekend.

2697
02:16:36,060 --> 02:16:39,740
But anyway, I have a lot of memories as a kid playing Turtles in Time and the Simpsons

2698
02:16:39,740 --> 02:16:41,180
arcade game with friends.

2699
02:16:41,180 --> 02:16:45,420
Later on, I played a lot of the grid and gauntlet legends in my teenage years, especially with

2700
02:16:45,420 --> 02:16:47,900
the help of the saved profile functions in the game.

2701
02:16:48,460 --> 02:16:53,660
Our buddy Jonas, our explicit, replied and said, hmm, having a group of six people, myself

2702
02:16:53,660 --> 02:16:58,300
included, play the six player X-Men arcade game without dying during my time in the Philippines

2703
02:16:58,300 --> 02:16:59,260
as a kid.

2704
02:16:59,260 --> 02:17:04,060
Playing an eight player Virtua Racing in the Luxor Casino Las Vegas when they had it before

2705
02:17:04,060 --> 02:17:09,900
the release of Daytona Racing in 1994 and the Crazy Panic Park tournaments at California

2706
02:17:09,900 --> 02:17:10,780
Extreme.

2707
02:17:10,780 --> 02:17:11,420
Nuff said.

2708
02:17:12,140 --> 02:17:13,660
Last but not least, Dark Tetsuya.

2709
02:17:14,380 --> 02:17:19,740
I think the most epic multiplayer experience has got to be Namco's Galaxian 3.

2710
02:17:19,740 --> 02:17:24,860
Imagine six cockpit seats with a Vector Star Wars style flight controller, two giant 50

2711
02:17:24,860 --> 02:17:27,100
inch monitors and a giant booth to house it in.

2712
02:17:27,100 --> 02:17:29,900
I played it in Santa Cruz at the boardwalk back in the late 90s.

2713
02:17:29,900 --> 02:17:31,420
It was amazing.

2714
02:17:31,980 --> 02:17:32,860
Great answers, you guys.

2715
02:17:32,860 --> 02:17:36,460
Those answers took me back and reminded me of a lot of good stuff, too.

2716
02:17:36,460 --> 02:17:39,900
Like, again, random ass memories from when I was a kid.

2717
02:17:40,620 --> 02:17:43,420
I went to go play Mortal Kombat 2.

2718
02:17:43,420 --> 02:17:48,140
It was a convenience store that had Mortal Kombat 2, like a 7-Eleven type of place, more

2719
02:17:48,140 --> 02:17:49,500
like mom and pop owned.

2720
02:17:49,500 --> 02:17:51,660
We would go to this convenience store to play Mortal Kombat 2.

2721
02:17:51,660 --> 02:17:53,500
It was like the only place in town that had it.

2722
02:17:53,500 --> 02:17:55,420
Like the big arcades didn't even have it.

2723
02:17:55,420 --> 02:17:56,060
That was always fun.

2724
02:17:56,060 --> 02:17:59,260
Like having like a bunch of different stores around towns that would have each would have

2725
02:17:59,260 --> 02:18:00,220
like one arcade game.

2726
02:18:00,620 --> 02:18:02,380
We got to go play Captain Commando.

2727
02:18:02,380 --> 02:18:04,140
Let's go to this like cafe over here.

2728
02:18:04,140 --> 02:18:04,380
Right.

2729
02:18:04,380 --> 02:18:05,900
And that's just going to go play Street Fighter.

2730
02:18:05,900 --> 02:18:11,900
It's at 7-Eleven or we'd have like the one bowling alley that had the Mortal Kombat 2.

2731
02:18:11,900 --> 02:18:12,620
Yeah, it used to.

2732
02:18:12,620 --> 02:18:14,780
It's like slot machines in Vegas, right?

2733
02:18:14,780 --> 02:18:16,540
You would see you go to the grocery store.

2734
02:18:16,540 --> 02:18:17,820
Oh, there's a slot machine over there.

2735
02:18:17,820 --> 02:18:21,100
You know, wherever you go, there's going to be gas stations, slot machines, right?

2736
02:18:21,660 --> 02:18:24,780
It used to be like that with arcade games for a period of time in the 90s.

2737
02:18:24,780 --> 02:18:26,380
But now it's kind of like that, right?

2738
02:18:26,380 --> 02:18:29,580
When I moved out here, you know, right at the end of the 90s, right at the end there.

2739
02:18:29,580 --> 02:18:32,620
And Dan and I would just, we'd do what we called our arcade circuit.

2740
02:18:32,620 --> 02:18:37,580
We would go to Crest View Lanes because they had Air Guys.

2741
02:18:38,220 --> 02:18:40,780
They had Blazing Star.

2742
02:18:40,780 --> 02:18:44,220
Rest in peace, that ghetto ass bowling alley is still standing.

2743
02:18:44,220 --> 02:18:46,380
Even though it's been closed for like five years.

2744
02:18:47,020 --> 02:18:47,900
It makes me so sad.

2745
02:18:47,900 --> 02:18:49,500
I just want all those games to be mine.

2746
02:18:49,500 --> 02:18:54,300
I'm just waiting for them to get that land and make it a strip mall.

2747
02:18:54,300 --> 02:18:55,260
You know that's what's going to happen.

2748
02:18:55,260 --> 02:18:57,340
At least I can play Blazing Star on my iPad.

2749
02:18:57,340 --> 02:18:57,840
That's true.

2750
02:18:59,740 --> 02:19:00,860
Great answers, you guys.

2751
02:19:00,860 --> 02:19:01,420
Took me back.

2752
02:19:01,420 --> 02:19:02,220
I love it.

2753
02:19:02,220 --> 02:19:04,860
All right, let's go back to some long news.

2754
02:19:04,860 --> 02:19:07,420
We're having a long show tonight, but this is some good stuff tonight, guys.

2755
02:19:08,300 --> 02:19:10,540
But some more recent stuff that's going on in gaming.

2756
02:19:10,540 --> 02:19:11,180
Loki.

2757
02:19:11,180 --> 02:19:11,740
Yes.

2758
02:19:11,740 --> 02:19:20,060
So there's been a class action lawsuit against Nvidia for their new GeForce GTX 970 graphics

2759
02:19:20,060 --> 02:19:20,300
card.

2760
02:19:20,300 --> 02:19:23,580
Apparently it's due to false advertising.

2761
02:19:23,580 --> 02:19:29,420
And the reason being is that people have found that since it has four gigabytes of video

2762
02:19:29,420 --> 02:19:34,620
RAM on there, apparently when games allocate more than three and a half gigabytes of RAM,

2763
02:19:34,620 --> 02:19:35,900
it starts to slow down.

2764
02:19:35,900 --> 02:19:42,060
Apparently, according to the lawsuit, the last half of a gigabyte runs 80% slower than

2765
02:19:42,060 --> 02:19:43,100
it's supposed to.

2766
02:19:43,100 --> 02:19:47,500
And this is causing stuttering on high resolution games and whatnot.

2767
02:19:47,500 --> 02:19:50,220
So interesting.

2768
02:19:50,940 --> 02:19:56,940
I've been hearing, you know, just I always look into like, you know, possibly upgrading

2769
02:19:56,940 --> 02:20:01,100
my desktop computer at one time, which is in parts right now.

2770
02:20:01,100 --> 02:20:10,140
But, you know, I had GeForce, well, GTS 880s at one time, or not 880s, 8800s.

2771
02:20:10,140 --> 02:20:15,020
This is before they had just the three digit cards.

2772
02:20:15,020 --> 02:20:23,420
Anyways, also saying, though, that apparently Nvidia has acknowledged that the GTX 970 uses

2773
02:20:23,420 --> 02:20:30,380
a different memory subsystem designed than its higher end GTX 980, but said the difference

2774
02:20:30,380 --> 02:20:31,580
is negligible.

2775
02:20:31,580 --> 02:20:36,300
But apparently it was something that a lot of people felt otherwise.

2776
02:20:36,300 --> 02:20:39,660
So be interesting to see how how this ends up.

2777
02:20:41,180 --> 02:20:41,900
I don't know.

2778
02:20:41,900 --> 02:20:46,380
I think it kind of sucks, though, especially if, you know, these cards seem to come out

2779
02:20:46,380 --> 02:20:50,380
so often and they keep pushing near just how much they can do.

2780
02:20:50,380 --> 02:20:54,300
And, you know, I guess it makes for healthy competition.

2781
02:20:54,300 --> 02:20:58,140
I guess now ATA comes out with something that works a little better than people decide to

2782
02:20:58,140 --> 02:20:59,980
go that camp and why not?

2783
02:20:59,980 --> 02:21:00,380
I don't know.

2784
02:21:01,420 --> 02:21:05,820
Akuma JP in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says I'm using a GTX 970.

2785
02:21:05,820 --> 02:21:06,700
No problem here.

2786
02:21:06,700 --> 02:21:07,740
All ultra settings.

2787
02:21:08,380 --> 02:21:11,100
So maybe it just depends on what I mean.

2788
02:21:11,100 --> 02:21:13,660
That's that's the thing about building your own computer.

2789
02:21:13,660 --> 02:21:16,540
Your own computer is that everything has to get along in the box.

2790
02:21:16,540 --> 02:21:17,580
So you might have a serious problem.

2791
02:21:17,580 --> 02:21:21,420
Also, I'm wondering, too, because, like, I mean, I understand you're running all ultra

2792
02:21:21,420 --> 02:21:25,820
settings, but are you I don't know how much of the four gigabytes of video RAM seems like

2793
02:21:25,820 --> 02:21:26,700
an awful lot.

2794
02:21:26,700 --> 02:21:32,140
And I don't know if we're talking like, you know, 4K displays and stuff like that.

2795
02:21:32,140 --> 02:21:33,660
Is that what you're trying to output on this?

2796
02:21:33,660 --> 02:21:39,260
Because it seems like that most games would not use four gigabytes of video RAM.

2797
02:21:39,260 --> 02:21:42,780
I mean, at least I think that they wouldn't, but I don't know.

2798
02:21:42,780 --> 02:21:43,500
Maybe they would.

2799
02:21:44,140 --> 02:21:45,740
But I think the ultra ultra.

2800
02:21:45,740 --> 02:21:50,860
I'm thinking like, you know, this sounds to me like if you're running like ultra settings

2801
02:21:50,860 --> 02:21:55,020
on like multiple monitors or something like that, that it would run into the situation.

2802
02:21:55,020 --> 02:21:56,380
But I don't know.

2803
02:21:56,380 --> 02:21:59,900
Maybe it's in once again, you know, this is something that I guess will come out, you

2804
02:21:59,900 --> 02:22:05,340
know, if this lawsuit goes forward, that maybe it was just a batch of cards that was defective

2805
02:22:05,340 --> 02:22:07,980
or something like that and something that they fixed.

2806
02:22:07,980 --> 02:22:08,380
I don't know.

2807
02:22:08,380 --> 02:22:09,660
Hopefully they work it out.

2808
02:22:09,660 --> 02:22:15,740
We'll see how we always talk about these lawsuits and things like that.

2809
02:22:15,740 --> 02:22:16,380
It's crazy.

2810
02:22:17,420 --> 02:22:20,860
Rama says, fanboys in their Nvidia, Team AMD for life.

2811
02:22:21,580 --> 02:22:25,340
Bobby Blackwolf says, I'm going to be getting a GTX when the consumer rift comes out because

2812
02:22:25,340 --> 02:22:28,060
Nvidia works better with the Oculus stuff for whatever reason.

2813
02:22:28,060 --> 02:22:29,980
My current AMD has issues.

2814
02:22:30,700 --> 02:22:31,020
All right.

2815
02:22:31,020 --> 02:22:32,460
Anyhow, let's move on.

2816
02:22:32,460 --> 02:22:34,140
I want to talk about Yokai Watch.

2817
02:22:34,140 --> 02:22:36,380
You know, this series is huge in Japan, right?

2818
02:22:36,380 --> 02:22:37,100
Huge.

2819
02:22:37,100 --> 02:22:39,980
But it, for whatever reason, hasn't shown up in America.

2820
02:22:39,980 --> 02:22:42,940
And I think a lot of people are wondering, especially those that are a little more tuned

2821
02:22:42,940 --> 02:22:47,100
into what's going on in the Japanese culture and what's popular over there, wondering when

2822
02:22:47,100 --> 02:22:49,660
is Level 5 going to bring this over to the States?

2823
02:22:49,660 --> 02:22:50,780
Well, guess what?

2824
02:22:50,780 --> 02:22:57,100
Yokai Watch developer Level 5 has confirmed a deal to bring these 3DS games to an English

2825
02:22:57,100 --> 02:22:57,580
audience.

2826
02:22:58,700 --> 02:23:04,220
It's, you know, this series is kind of like Pokemon, but there's more to it than that.

2827
02:23:05,100 --> 02:23:10,700
Anyhow, merchandising and licensing and so forth, probably something that's going to

2828
02:23:10,700 --> 02:23:11,340
follow with this.

2829
02:23:12,140 --> 02:23:17,180
Hasbro actually has got that with Level 5, and they're going to launch these toys in

2830
02:23:17,180 --> 02:23:18,300
2016.

2831
02:23:19,340 --> 02:23:22,940
They're going full throttle here in the States.

2832
02:23:22,940 --> 02:23:27,100
Anime, comics, books, music, Monopoly boards, the games themselves.

2833
02:23:27,100 --> 02:23:28,940
It's all happening here in the States.

2834
02:23:28,940 --> 02:23:32,060
The Yokai Watch franchise has been hugely successful, and we are ready to bring the

2835
02:23:32,060 --> 02:23:38,220
brand to new markets across multiple platforms, said Akihiro Hino, who is the Level 5 president.

2836
02:23:38,220 --> 02:23:39,740
So here it is.

2837
02:23:40,460 --> 02:23:46,220
So not just the fact that it's coming Stateside, but it's coming Stateside with bells and whistles,

2838
02:23:46,220 --> 02:23:50,140
which that's kind of good because that tells me it's not going to be like a fringe game

2839
02:23:50,140 --> 02:23:53,900
because sometimes when Japanese games finally come out in the US, they're hard to find.

2840
02:23:53,900 --> 02:23:54,620
They're fringe.

2841
02:23:54,620 --> 02:23:57,100
It's like they have one run and then they're gone.

2842
02:23:57,820 --> 02:23:58,780
You don't find them again.

2843
02:23:58,780 --> 02:24:03,100
So they're putting all this licensing and freaking Hasbro is behind it too.

2844
02:24:03,100 --> 02:24:05,020
This game is not going to be hard to find.

2845
02:24:05,020 --> 02:24:07,740
They're expecting this to be a big, big thing.

2846
02:24:07,740 --> 02:24:11,500
Like a Yu-Gi-Oh or Naruto or something like that.

2847
02:24:11,500 --> 02:24:12,540
So that's good to know.

2848
02:24:12,540 --> 02:24:13,740
So here we go.

2849
02:24:13,740 --> 02:24:14,860
I already wanted it.

2850
02:24:14,860 --> 02:24:20,780
I would imagine E3 is going to be very telling for this, especially if I'm Nintendo and I

2851
02:24:20,780 --> 02:24:23,340
would get people really psyched about what's coming for the 3DS.

2852
02:24:24,700 --> 02:24:28,700
I think you can fully expect to see some of that in their Nintendo Direct at E3.

2853
02:24:29,180 --> 02:24:30,540
Anyway, Dark Sakura.

2854
02:24:31,260 --> 02:24:33,180
Well, things are getting serious in Australia.

2855
02:24:33,980 --> 02:24:37,340
What's going on right now is that there was a report out from Torrent Freak

2856
02:24:37,980 --> 02:24:41,740
that Australia is considering a three strikes copyright enforcement system.

2857
02:24:42,860 --> 02:24:49,340
Meaning that for anyone who participates in file sharing or infringing of copyright or

2858
02:24:49,340 --> 02:24:54,300
illegal sharing of different movies and music and things like that,

2859
02:24:54,300 --> 02:24:57,100
there is a three strikes copyright infringement rule.

2860
02:24:58,780 --> 02:25:01,180
They give them the three strikes and then take action.

2861
02:25:02,460 --> 02:25:08,860
So it's just a little blurb on here says this copyright notice scheme code is designed to

2862
02:25:08,860 --> 02:25:14,940
facilitate a cooperative industry led copyright notice scheme throughout which internet service

2863
02:25:14,940 --> 02:25:19,580
providers and the owners of copyright works will work to deter the practice of online

2864
02:25:19,580 --> 02:25:21,260
copyright infringement, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2865
02:25:22,620 --> 02:25:24,940
Step one is an educational notice.

2866
02:25:24,940 --> 02:25:26,940
Step two is a warning notice.

2867
02:25:26,940 --> 02:25:28,540
Step three is a final notice.

2868
02:25:29,340 --> 02:25:37,900
And then each notice can be appealed with a cost of $25 Australian dollars.

2869
02:25:38,620 --> 02:25:44,860
And if the appeal is upheld, then the fee will be refunded, which I mean,

2870
02:25:44,860 --> 02:25:49,820
it kind of sounds fair right now, but this doesn't say what the actual

2871
02:25:51,820 --> 02:25:54,860
punishments that are going to be used against these people are.

2872
02:25:54,860 --> 02:25:57,740
So there's a little bit more about it on Torrent Freak.

2873
02:25:59,500 --> 02:26:03,740
The article is, let me see if I can get the link for folks.

2874
02:26:04,300 --> 02:26:04,540
Yeah.

2875
02:26:04,540 --> 02:26:09,340
It's just a big, long URL on Torrent Freak, but just look up Torrent Freak and Australian

2876
02:26:10,540 --> 02:26:12,220
ISP three strikes rule.

2877
02:26:14,220 --> 02:26:17,980
It's a very interesting bit of information.

2878
02:26:19,820 --> 02:26:20,140
I don't know.

2879
02:26:20,140 --> 02:26:23,340
Good luck enforcing it is kind of where my head's at.

2880
02:26:23,340 --> 02:26:25,020
That's sort of what I'm thinking on that one.

2881
02:26:25,020 --> 02:26:27,580
I'm not saying that stealing is okay.

2882
02:26:28,220 --> 02:26:35,340
If you're going to pirate things, then you have to realize that there are consequences,

2883
02:26:35,340 --> 02:26:38,300
be it these very tangible things that they're talking about here,

2884
02:26:38,300 --> 02:26:42,220
or just moral consequences in some ways of doing something like that.

2885
02:26:43,100 --> 02:26:46,780
We get into a lot of gray areas and so forth, but the fact of the matter is,

2886
02:26:46,780 --> 02:26:49,420
if you download a CD, you are stealing it.

2887
02:26:49,420 --> 02:26:50,460
Don't copy that floppy.

2888
02:26:50,460 --> 02:26:50,960
Right.

2889
02:26:51,500 --> 02:26:55,340
But it's going to be very interesting to see how something like this is universally

2890
02:26:55,340 --> 02:27:00,780
enforced without spying on people or what that comes out.

2891
02:27:00,780 --> 02:27:04,620
I mean, how are you going to enforce that uniformly?

2892
02:27:04,620 --> 02:27:09,100
Because that's another big thing is that you can't make an example out of one person.

2893
02:27:09,100 --> 02:27:14,700
And a lot of people who make laws probably also download CDs illegally,

2894
02:27:14,700 --> 02:27:16,060
or at least have a one point in their life.

2895
02:27:16,780 --> 02:27:22,140
I'm certain that there's very few people who are that morally upstanding that they haven't done it.

2896
02:27:22,140 --> 02:27:22,540
Right.

2897
02:27:22,540 --> 02:27:24,140
Well, also this is Australia.

2898
02:27:24,140 --> 02:27:28,300
So I want to say that I know there's some games over there that either don't come out

2899
02:27:28,300 --> 02:27:30,780
because of their stupid like R18 thing.

2900
02:27:30,780 --> 02:27:33,740
I think they finally fixed the rating system, but it's still like,

2901
02:27:33,740 --> 02:27:34,620
I just don't know.

2902
02:27:34,620 --> 02:27:37,660
Things have been censored for really random things in Australia.

2903
02:27:37,660 --> 02:27:40,540
You know, again, I don't live there.

2904
02:27:40,540 --> 02:27:42,460
Maybe we have some Australian listeners who can email us

2905
02:27:42,460 --> 02:27:46,060
and clue us in a little more as to what the situation is really like over there.

2906
02:27:46,060 --> 02:27:50,380
But I do remember distinctly when the new Mortal Kombat came out,

2907
02:27:50,620 --> 02:27:53,500
not Mortal Kombat X, obviously, but Mortal Kombat 9 or whatever.

2908
02:27:53,500 --> 02:27:58,220
Like one of my friends from Australia on Facebook posted a picture of like the disc saying,

2909
02:27:58,220 --> 02:28:02,220
thanks so and so for mailing me a copy of this because we can't get it here in Australia.

2910
02:28:03,900 --> 02:28:05,820
So because it was banned or whatever.

2911
02:28:05,820 --> 02:28:07,900
And I think we talked about it on the show years ago.

2912
02:28:07,900 --> 02:28:11,980
So, but I thought they had fixed a lot of those issues where now there is a rating,

2913
02:28:12,540 --> 02:28:15,340
but somehow stuff still gets kind of censored.

2914
02:28:15,340 --> 02:28:15,840
I don't know.

2915
02:28:16,540 --> 02:28:19,580
Anyway, we're about to the mailbag.

2916
02:28:19,580 --> 02:28:20,460
But first, Loki.

2917
02:28:21,020 --> 02:28:21,340
Yeah.

2918
02:28:21,340 --> 02:28:25,900
So there's a rumor that apparently the Phantom Dust developer,

2919
02:28:25,900 --> 02:28:28,140
Dark Side Games has shut down.

2920
02:28:28,780 --> 02:28:31,180
And this would be kind of disappointing because they were supposed to be,

2921
02:28:31,180 --> 02:28:32,860
you know, partnering with Microsoft for this.

2922
02:28:32,860 --> 02:28:36,300
But apparently, you know, according to a rumor, they're saying, you know,

2923
02:28:36,300 --> 02:28:41,900
that the development of Phantom Dust or that basically their relationship has now ended.

2924
02:28:41,900 --> 02:28:45,340
And, you know, they had a great respect for the studio and their work in the industry.

2925
02:28:45,340 --> 02:28:49,020
But while they do not have anything to share about Phantom Dust at this time,

2926
02:28:49,020 --> 02:28:55,180
we can confirm development of the title continues just without Dark Side, I guess.

2927
02:28:57,500 --> 02:29:02,060
So apparently they're saying that the 50 staff members have been

2928
02:29:03,740 --> 02:29:06,460
forced to close since they lost the Phantom Dust contract.

2929
02:29:08,220 --> 02:29:09,900
But the game is not done with.

2930
02:29:09,900 --> 02:29:11,420
I've never seen that as more on Twitter.

2931
02:29:11,420 --> 02:29:15,020
The game is still coming, but this doesn't bode well.

2932
02:29:15,020 --> 02:29:18,220
Because that means if they got the contract pulled, somebody wasn't happy with it.

2933
02:29:18,860 --> 02:29:23,660
Not necessarily they were right in that call, but it's strange.

2934
02:29:24,620 --> 02:29:28,380
Well, you know, I hate reporting on these layoff type of stories because, you know,

2935
02:29:29,260 --> 02:29:33,660
one guy in a boardroom somewhere, a girl or group of people made that decision.

2936
02:29:34,220 --> 02:29:36,860
And I don't know, it's always tough to hear about.

2937
02:29:37,420 --> 02:29:41,900
So hopefully those folks will be able to find positions elsewhere really soon.

2938
02:29:43,580 --> 02:29:46,860
Meanwhile, speaking of legal crap going on,

2939
02:29:46,860 --> 02:29:49,260
this is something that came out a little earlier in the week.

2940
02:29:49,260 --> 02:29:55,820
Do you guys remember when Bethesda was going after that game Scrolls that Mojang put out because

2941
02:29:55,820 --> 02:30:00,060
Bethesda had the name for like Elder Scrolls and so forth?

2942
02:30:00,060 --> 02:30:04,300
Now they ended up reaching an agreement, but some lawyers made a bunch of money off of that.

2943
02:30:04,300 --> 02:30:08,460
Well, get this, the developer behind the indie title Fortress

2944
02:30:08,460 --> 02:30:14,380
Fallout says that Bethesda's parent company Zenimax Media forced him to abandon the

2945
02:30:14,380 --> 02:30:19,260
trademark for the game because of infringement with, of course, the Fallout series, which

2946
02:30:19,260 --> 02:30:23,420
hasn't had a new game in a while, but perhaps something is being announced real soon.

2947
02:30:23,420 --> 02:30:24,140
I don't know.

2948
02:30:24,140 --> 02:30:28,060
But anyway, Zenimax asked in a letter that the creator, Jordan Marin,

2949
02:30:29,340 --> 02:30:32,140
who by the way goes by CaptainSparklez on YouTube,

2950
02:30:33,260 --> 02:30:38,700
immediately expressly abandoned the application for Fortress Fallout and cease any and all current

2951
02:30:38,700 --> 02:30:42,700
or proposed use of any mark incorporating the term Fallout.

2952
02:30:43,580 --> 02:30:46,780
And because, you know, again, this is just one guy.

2953
02:30:46,780 --> 02:30:50,380
He's just complying with it because of a lack of resources.

2954
02:30:51,020 --> 02:30:56,300
Our lawyers say that Bethesda is notoriously litigious company.

2955
02:30:56,300 --> 02:30:59,260
Obviously, they have lots of money and resources that they're disposable,

2956
02:30:59,260 --> 02:31:01,500
which me and my partner don't really have at the moment.

2957
02:31:01,500 --> 02:31:04,860
So essentially we are being strong armed and having to change our name,

2958
02:31:04,860 --> 02:31:08,300
which is unfortunate because I personally don't feel there's any confusion

2959
02:31:08,300 --> 02:31:11,500
between Fortress Fallout and the Fallout game franchise.

2960
02:31:12,140 --> 02:31:14,540
And certainly looking at the screenshots,

2961
02:31:14,540 --> 02:31:18,460
there's really nothing in common with this game and Fallout.

2962
02:31:18,460 --> 02:31:21,500
There's no game is not about nuclear fallout or anything like that.

2963
02:31:23,340 --> 02:31:24,780
So I don't know this kind of.

2964
02:31:26,860 --> 02:31:27,980
I mean, it's one of them.

2965
02:31:27,980 --> 02:31:31,820
I understand he would, if they had the money to fight it, he would probably win.

2966
02:31:31,820 --> 02:31:35,740
But at the same time, he doesn't get settled out of court, just like the scrolls thing did.

2967
02:31:35,740 --> 02:31:37,180
Yeah, that's probably what would happen.

2968
02:31:37,180 --> 02:31:40,540
And it's easy to point a finger and go stop being an asshole.

2969
02:31:41,500 --> 02:31:43,580
But also there's that whole element of,

2970
02:31:43,580 --> 02:31:46,620
well, if you don't protect a trademark, then you're at risk for losing it.

2971
02:31:46,620 --> 02:31:50,540
So on one hand, Bethesda has the responsibility to do something like this.

2972
02:31:50,540 --> 02:31:51,980
But then you kind of look at it and go,

2973
02:31:51,980 --> 02:31:53,420
who gave them a trademark on the name?

2974
02:31:54,060 --> 02:32:00,380
Just just Fallout for everything like star Fallout star for all games to begin with.

2975
02:32:00,380 --> 02:32:03,020
I mean, that's I don't know, especially, I think,

2976
02:32:03,020 --> 02:32:05,900
I think when it comes down to that, like you shouldn't be able to have like,

2977
02:32:06,700 --> 02:32:09,260
you know, I shouldn't be able to make a game called Fallout.

2978
02:32:09,260 --> 02:32:13,020
It's like, maybe do you remember it was we just had this discussion like a year ago

2979
02:32:13,020 --> 02:32:15,980
when it was Candy Crush Saga and the Banner Saga.

2980
02:32:15,980 --> 02:32:17,340
Like it was that whole thing again.

2981
02:32:17,340 --> 02:32:18,860
Everybody was looking at King going,

2982
02:32:18,860 --> 02:32:22,780
who the fuck gave them the patent or trademark, excuse me, on Saga?

2983
02:32:22,780 --> 02:32:23,900
Like, how did they?

2984
02:32:23,900 --> 02:32:26,060
It just needs to be a lot of reform.

2985
02:32:26,060 --> 02:32:27,980
Yeah, but it's not going to happen.

2986
02:32:28,780 --> 02:32:32,620
Of course, there's no duking it out with, you know, Square for Saga Frontier.

2987
02:32:32,620 --> 02:32:33,100
Right.

2988
02:32:33,100 --> 02:32:35,900
Well, this this just goes to show, you know, and Bobby

2989
02:32:35,980 --> 02:32:38,300
Black was in chat saying, well, the USPTO did.

2990
02:32:39,260 --> 02:32:42,700
Well, yes, we know how that happens, but it's kind of one of those things where it's like,

2991
02:32:42,700 --> 02:32:46,540
okay, maybe we really need to look at some of this trademark and intellectual property

2992
02:32:46,540 --> 02:32:49,900
in the way we do, because, you know, we haven't really modernized that very

2993
02:32:51,260 --> 02:32:52,380
for the Internet age.

2994
02:32:52,380 --> 02:32:55,900
And I think we're starting to see that kind of bite us in the ass a little more.

2995
02:32:55,900 --> 02:32:56,380
I don't know.

2996
02:32:59,420 --> 02:33:04,620
And Bobby Black Wolf pointing out Vanguard V was originally Vanguard Valkyrie until CCP

2997
02:33:04,620 --> 02:33:07,180
came along because of Eve Valkyrie.

2998
02:33:07,180 --> 02:33:10,540
But both were VR games that included space combat.

2999
02:33:10,540 --> 02:33:11,980
That's a little bit more similar.

3000
02:33:11,980 --> 02:33:12,860
That's a little.

3001
02:33:12,860 --> 02:33:16,300
At least you can kind of look at that and go, okay, kind of see that.

3002
02:33:16,300 --> 02:33:20,860
But, you know, when these games really don't have anything in common, it's unfortunate.

3003
02:33:20,860 --> 02:33:21,420
Unfortunate.

3004
02:33:23,340 --> 02:33:25,420
Anyhow, let's get to the mailbag.

3005
02:33:25,420 --> 02:33:26,860
You guys email us every week.

3006
02:33:26,860 --> 02:33:29,420
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

3007
02:33:29,980 --> 02:33:33,660
Dark Soccer is going to dive into the mailbag and find some emails she believes are worthy

3008
02:33:33,660 --> 02:33:35,180
of reading on the program tonight.

3009
02:33:35,180 --> 02:33:35,900
Dark Soccer.

3010
02:33:36,860 --> 02:33:37,900
Who's emailed us?

3011
02:33:37,900 --> 02:33:39,820
You were wrong, because we have three emails.

3012
02:33:39,820 --> 02:33:40,540
Three emails?

3013
02:33:40,540 --> 02:33:41,180
There's only one.

3014
02:33:41,180 --> 02:33:41,740
Three mail.

3015
02:33:41,740 --> 02:33:43,180
There was only one yesterday.

3016
02:33:43,180 --> 02:33:44,140
Three mail.

3017
02:33:44,140 --> 02:33:45,260
Three mails.

3018
02:33:45,260 --> 02:33:45,900
Tree mail.

3019
02:33:45,900 --> 02:33:46,620
It's like survivor.

3020
02:33:47,500 --> 02:33:48,780
Um, okay.

3021
02:33:49,580 --> 02:33:51,020
This comes from Robert M.

3022
02:33:51,020 --> 02:33:51,820
News item.

3023
02:33:51,820 --> 02:33:54,860
YouTube personality and Minecraft fan Jordan captains.

3024
02:33:54,860 --> 02:33:55,660
Oh, this is.

3025
02:33:55,660 --> 02:33:57,100
Oh, is this the story I just read?

3026
02:33:57,100 --> 02:33:57,340
It is.

3027
02:33:57,340 --> 02:33:57,820
Never mind.

3028
02:33:57,820 --> 02:33:58,380
How funny.

3029
02:33:59,580 --> 02:34:01,340
I will skip them past all of that.

3030
02:34:01,340 --> 02:34:01,580
Okay.

3031
02:34:02,300 --> 02:34:06,460
Regarding last week's FUGL topic, I'm surprised nobody mentioned Rocky's Boots.

3032
02:34:06,460 --> 02:34:09,900
I used to play with that at Science Center Lab all the time.

3033
02:34:09,900 --> 02:34:13,660
I also saw Cosmic Osmo there long before missed.

3034
02:34:13,660 --> 02:34:14,540
Still busy at work.

3035
02:34:14,540 --> 02:34:18,220
Should be able to take time to back up things on my PS3.

3036
02:34:18,220 --> 02:34:21,020
Cloud save and put in a repair ticket soon.

3037
02:34:21,020 --> 02:34:21,820
Trademark.

3038
02:34:21,820 --> 02:34:22,460
Quote fingers.

3039
02:34:23,020 --> 02:34:23,420
Period.

3040
02:34:25,740 --> 02:34:26,860
I mentioned Rocky's Boots.

3041
02:34:26,860 --> 02:34:27,580
I love that game.

3042
02:34:28,300 --> 02:34:31,580
If I didn't mention on last week's show, I certainly mentioned it in the past month at

3043
02:34:31,580 --> 02:34:31,900
some point.

3044
02:34:31,900 --> 02:34:33,100
I remember talking about it on the show.

3045
02:34:33,100 --> 02:34:33,980
I love that game.

3046
02:34:33,980 --> 02:34:34,480
Love it.

3047
02:34:35,820 --> 02:34:36,460
Next email.

3048
02:34:36,460 --> 02:34:36,960
Yep.

3049
02:34:37,580 --> 02:34:39,260
I was excited to hear.

3050
02:34:40,540 --> 02:34:43,580
Here is H-E-A-R, not H-E-R-E.

3051
02:34:43,580 --> 02:34:45,180
About last week's forum topic.

3052
02:34:45,180 --> 02:34:47,340
Classic Edutational Games.

3053
02:34:47,340 --> 02:34:50,300
Though I wish someone would have mentioned my favorite robot odyssey.

3054
02:34:50,300 --> 02:34:54,700
It was from around the same time as Oregon Trail and it was like a super advanced Rocky's

3055
02:34:54,700 --> 02:34:55,260
Boots.

3056
02:34:55,260 --> 02:34:59,180
The protagonist falls into robotropolis and has to find his way out.

3057
02:34:59,180 --> 02:35:01,900
You can go inside robots and inside computer chips.

3058
02:35:02,860 --> 02:35:03,820
Sorry, my neck.

3059
02:35:04,460 --> 02:35:06,140
Once any of these you...

3060
02:35:07,100 --> 02:35:07,580
Okay.

3061
02:35:07,580 --> 02:35:11,340
Once inside any of these, you design all the logic circuits that tell a robot how to move

3062
02:35:11,340 --> 02:35:14,380
around, how to use its sensors and pick things up, et cetera.

3063
02:35:15,660 --> 02:35:19,900
I was only about eight when I first tried to play it, but what I learned about logic

3064
02:35:19,900 --> 02:35:22,460
gates, flip flops, et cetera, stuck with me.

3065
02:35:22,460 --> 02:35:24,540
It's even available now via emulation.

3066
02:35:24,620 --> 02:35:27,420
Thanks for reminding me about this great game and keep lounging.

3067
02:35:27,420 --> 02:35:28,780
That's from Salmonax.

3068
02:35:30,540 --> 02:35:32,780
I vaguely remember that game.

3069
02:35:32,780 --> 02:35:37,980
I think that was another MECC game, I think, who made a lot of those.

3070
02:35:37,980 --> 02:35:38,300
What was it?

3071
02:35:38,300 --> 02:35:41,020
It was like Minnesota Entertainment.

3072
02:35:41,020 --> 02:35:45,260
I don't remember what it stood for, but I know MECC made a lot of those classic games

3073
02:35:45,260 --> 02:35:49,820
like Oregon Trail and Number Munchers and all those games and Rocky's Boots, I believe.

3074
02:35:49,820 --> 02:35:51,500
So I wonder if that was another one of their titles.

3075
02:35:52,940 --> 02:35:53,660
Sounds familiar.

3076
02:35:53,660 --> 02:35:54,220
Last email.

3077
02:35:54,220 --> 02:35:55,260
It's called Email Plus One.

3078
02:35:56,540 --> 02:35:58,780
In case you don't have any emails tonight, here's one for you.

3079
02:35:58,780 --> 02:35:59,180
Smile.

3080
02:35:59,180 --> 02:35:59,500
Cheers.

3081
02:35:59,500 --> 02:35:59,980
Andy R.

3082
02:36:01,260 --> 02:36:02,140
That's it?

3083
02:36:02,140 --> 02:36:02,940
That's it?

3084
02:36:02,940 --> 02:36:03,340
Yeah.

3085
02:36:03,340 --> 02:36:03,820
Cheers.

3086
02:36:04,780 --> 02:36:05,260
Here you go.

3087
02:36:05,260 --> 02:36:05,660
Well, thank you.

3088
02:36:05,660 --> 02:36:06,300
Thank you.

3089
02:36:06,300 --> 02:36:10,140
Thank you for just leaving a safety net in there just in case.

3090
02:36:10,140 --> 02:36:13,820
Luckily, we had a couple other emails in there to fill out the sack, but...

3091
02:36:13,820 --> 02:36:14,700
Very kind of you.

3092
02:36:14,700 --> 02:36:15,260
Very kind.

3093
02:36:15,260 --> 02:36:15,740
Yes.

3094
02:36:15,740 --> 02:36:16,140
Cheers.

3095
02:36:16,940 --> 02:36:17,580
You know what?

3096
02:36:17,580 --> 02:36:18,220
I love that.

3097
02:36:18,220 --> 02:36:19,340
Just getting an email.

3098
02:36:19,340 --> 02:36:20,220
Just wanted to say hey.

3099
02:36:21,500 --> 02:36:22,940
I just want to get an email that goes,

3100
02:36:22,940 --> 02:36:23,740
sup bitches.

3101
02:36:24,940 --> 02:36:25,820
And then I'll know you.

3102
02:36:25,820 --> 02:36:29,260
You do know that grandpa stole that and he uses that on Hoard House every week now.

3103
02:36:29,260 --> 02:36:29,660
Really?

3104
02:36:29,660 --> 02:36:30,300
Yeah.

3105
02:36:30,300 --> 02:36:31,580
He stole my sup bitches?

3106
02:36:31,580 --> 02:36:32,940
You should charge him a quarter.

3107
02:36:33,500 --> 02:36:34,700
You just have me on the show.

3108
02:36:36,220 --> 02:36:36,620
We can.

3109
02:36:36,620 --> 02:36:37,580
We should have you on the show.

3110
02:36:37,580 --> 02:36:38,460
I mean, Becky.

3111
02:36:38,460 --> 02:36:41,500
We just had a sill residency on Hoard House.

3112
02:36:41,500 --> 02:36:42,380
She did two weeks.

3113
02:36:42,380 --> 02:36:43,900
She did because she's been on vacation.

3114
02:36:43,900 --> 02:36:47,180
So she did two weeks on Hoard House and she was fabulous.

3115
02:36:47,180 --> 02:36:49,740
I mean, I mean, this, his Star Trek thing.

3116
02:36:50,300 --> 02:36:51,740
Oh, you want to go on a Star Trek show?

3117
02:36:51,740 --> 02:36:55,340
Because Becky and I have been like talking DS9 like over the past three weeks.

3118
02:36:55,340 --> 02:36:58,620
Oh, well, grandpa make it so.

3119
02:36:59,660 --> 02:37:00,220
Engage.

3120
02:37:00,860 --> 02:37:01,820
I wonder if he's still listening.

3121
02:37:01,820 --> 02:37:02,140
I don't know.

3122
02:37:02,140 --> 02:37:05,500
It was in chat earlier, but, uh, he might've left to go poop or something.

3123
02:37:05,500 --> 02:37:05,900
I don't know.

3124
02:37:05,900 --> 02:37:06,540
That's what he does.

3125
02:37:07,100 --> 02:37:07,500
All right.

3126
02:37:07,500 --> 02:37:09,900
Actually, we have things we need to work on, Rob.

3127
02:37:09,900 --> 02:37:10,380
Yeah.

3128
02:37:10,380 --> 02:37:10,620
All right.

3129
02:37:10,620 --> 02:37:12,140
We've sort of been throwing around.

3130
02:37:13,100 --> 02:37:14,380
Like poop on a doorstep.

3131
02:37:15,500 --> 02:37:16,780
That's it for the mailbag tonight, right?

3132
02:37:17,340 --> 02:37:17,580
Yeah.

3133
02:37:17,580 --> 02:37:18,060
Yeah.

3134
02:37:18,060 --> 02:37:21,260
Participate at orange lounge radio.com.

3135
02:37:21,340 --> 02:37:22,460
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

3136
02:37:38,620 --> 02:37:47,020
Um, FU goes to my muse for being, uh, rabid and making me want to work on my story all

3137
02:37:47,020 --> 02:37:47,500
the time.

3138
02:37:48,300 --> 02:37:51,900
But at the same time, thank you to all of the people who have given me valuable feedback

3139
02:37:51,900 --> 02:37:53,260
and make me feel like a rock star.

3140
02:37:53,260 --> 02:37:54,060
So thanks.

3141
02:37:56,300 --> 02:38:02,300
Uh, just FU, I guess, to lack of sleep I've been giving myself for the last two months.

3142
02:38:03,180 --> 02:38:06,220
Hopefully I'll catch up on sleep or maybe not.

3143
02:38:08,220 --> 02:38:11,900
Uh, my view of the week goes to my back cause it's been randomly hurting and you know what

3144
02:38:11,900 --> 02:38:12,540
I blame?

3145
02:38:12,540 --> 02:38:18,300
I think, I think I just need a new bed because I've had that bed since it's been a while.

3146
02:38:18,300 --> 02:38:23,020
The bed I have, I've had probably since like seven or eight years.

3147
02:38:23,020 --> 02:38:24,060
So I'm ready for a new bed.

3148
02:38:24,620 --> 02:38:25,260
Talk to me.

3149
02:38:25,260 --> 02:38:30,860
I have, um, Dan and I, when we bought ours, we did things a really smart way and I will

3150
02:38:30,860 --> 02:38:31,420
share it with you.

3151
02:38:31,420 --> 02:38:31,740
Okay.

3152
02:38:31,740 --> 02:38:32,300
Sounds good.

3153
02:38:32,940 --> 02:38:35,580
That's something we're in the market for soonish.

3154
02:38:35,580 --> 02:38:38,060
I think we, Alan and I talked about it anyway.

3155
02:38:38,060 --> 02:38:40,700
Cause uh, I will say a thank you.

3156
02:38:40,700 --> 02:38:44,780
As of this month, that brand new washer and dryer that we have out there in the garage,

3157
02:38:44,780 --> 02:38:46,860
those brand new front loaders paid off.

3158
02:38:47,420 --> 02:38:48,060
I own them.

3159
02:38:49,260 --> 02:38:49,980
Thumb.

3160
02:38:49,980 --> 02:38:50,700
Exactly.

3161
02:38:50,700 --> 02:38:52,140
Responsibility.

3162
02:38:52,140 --> 02:38:53,020
Congratulations.

3163
02:38:53,020 --> 02:38:53,820
You own a washer.

3164
02:38:53,820 --> 02:38:54,460
You're an adult.

3165
02:38:55,580 --> 02:38:56,460
I should get a star.

3166
02:38:56,460 --> 02:38:59,980
And here's your dryer and your washer and here's a fridge.

3167
02:39:00,620 --> 02:39:01,660
Happy adulthood.

3168
02:39:01,660 --> 02:39:02,700
Oh man.

3169
02:39:02,700 --> 02:39:04,540
Go on The Price is Right and win some new ones.

3170
02:39:04,540 --> 02:39:05,260
All right.

3171
02:39:05,260 --> 02:39:07,900
Uh, let's get to just a couple more stories for you guys.

3172
02:39:07,900 --> 02:39:12,620
And then we're going to get to the Skype line at one eight seven seven game OLR or our username

3173
02:39:12,620 --> 02:39:14,620
on Skype, orange lounge radio.

3174
02:39:14,620 --> 02:39:18,460
That's all one word, orange lounge radio, but first Loki.

3175
02:39:19,100 --> 02:39:21,500
So you may hear the words, I'm not dead yet.

3176
02:39:22,140 --> 02:39:27,020
And in reference to, um, the last guardian, but a lot of people still don't believe that.

3177
02:39:27,020 --> 02:39:33,900
But Sony is once again, confirm me that yes, even though we just failed to, we've abandoned

3178
02:39:33,900 --> 02:39:35,580
the trademark for the last guardian.

3179
02:39:35,580 --> 02:39:36,940
It's still in development.

3180
02:39:36,940 --> 02:39:37,820
We promise.

3181
02:39:37,820 --> 02:39:40,060
Swear it's still being made.

3182
02:39:40,060 --> 02:39:44,620
It's just the makers of the guardian legend sued us for trademark infringement.

3183
02:39:44,620 --> 02:39:46,620
So we had to abandon that trademark.

3184
02:39:47,180 --> 02:39:49,580
What if the game were to come back with a new name?

3185
02:39:49,580 --> 02:39:50,080
It might.

3186
02:39:51,180 --> 02:39:56,300
I mean, that's like something that I don't think anybody asked, like why?

3187
02:39:56,300 --> 02:39:58,460
Maybe somebody did, but I just didn't see it on Twitter or anything.

3188
02:39:58,460 --> 02:40:03,580
Like what if it's as simple as the game just has a new name for whatever creative reason?

3189
02:40:03,580 --> 02:40:05,100
Shadow of the Colossus 2.

3190
02:40:05,100 --> 02:40:07,100
It's, it's been in development this long.

3191
02:40:08,620 --> 02:40:12,060
Are you really going to care if they change the name into something else, you know, to

3192
02:40:12,060 --> 02:40:12,540
match the vision?

3193
02:40:12,540 --> 02:40:16,300
It would be pretty bad-ass if it was Shadow of the Colossus 2, where he rides around on

3194
02:40:16,300 --> 02:40:21,180
that other, you know, giant, you know, dog, dragon, griffin, whatever the fuck that thing

3195
02:40:21,180 --> 02:40:23,020
is, and like fights other.

3196
02:40:23,020 --> 02:40:25,580
I just would like to know, like, what's the fucking status?

3197
02:40:25,580 --> 02:40:26,300
That's all I wanted.

3198
02:40:26,300 --> 02:40:27,340
What's the fucking status of that game?

3199
02:40:27,340 --> 02:40:30,940
And if it's not Shadow of the Colossus 2, can I just get a Shadow of the Colossus 2?

3200
02:40:30,940 --> 02:40:34,460
Because I would be down with that as well, because imagine how big the Colossus, you

3201
02:40:34,460 --> 02:40:38,060
know, they could be so much bigger, and it'd be so much more epic.

3202
02:40:38,060 --> 02:40:41,180
And imagine taking down, you know, them with a group of people.

3203
02:40:41,180 --> 02:40:44,060
But then again, we're starting to get into Monster Hunter territory at that point.

3204
02:40:45,340 --> 02:40:49,580
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, the Last Guardian broke your heart, just like I said it would,

3205
02:40:49,580 --> 02:40:50,860
or just as I said it would.

3206
02:40:50,860 --> 02:40:53,900
The Last Guardian is really Frog Fractions 2.

3207
02:40:55,900 --> 02:40:56,860
I'm okay with that.

3208
02:40:56,860 --> 02:40:58,380
I, I'm totally okay with that.

3209
02:40:58,380 --> 02:40:59,820
I'm also, I see it also be okay.

3210
02:40:59,820 --> 02:41:01,580
What fucking happened to Frog Fractions 2?

3211
02:41:01,580 --> 02:41:02,140
Wasn't there like a giant Kickstarter?

3212
02:41:02,140 --> 02:41:03,260
No one's found it yet.

3213
02:41:04,620 --> 02:41:07,580
Doesn't, didn't he have to share it with Kickstarter backers or something?

3214
02:41:07,580 --> 02:41:08,540
Wasn't that part of the thing?

3215
02:41:08,540 --> 02:41:09,420
No, he hasn't.

3216
02:41:09,420 --> 02:41:11,020
It's just that no one's found it yet.

3217
02:41:11,820 --> 02:41:16,380
If you just say Frog Fractions on Twitter, the creator will like favorite your tweet.

3218
02:41:16,380 --> 02:41:19,980
Like I found this out, like every time I've said something about Frog Fractions, like

3219
02:41:19,980 --> 02:41:21,260
the creator favorites the tweet.

3220
02:41:21,260 --> 02:41:24,940
Like, you know, he's running tweet deck and he has like a Frog Fractions column or something

3221
02:41:24,940 --> 02:41:26,780
that every time somebody mentions that game.

3222
02:41:27,340 --> 02:41:30,220
So I just, I would, I, I hope it shows up soon.

3223
02:41:30,220 --> 02:41:32,060
I'll start mentioning it every day now.

3224
02:41:32,060 --> 02:41:35,660
No, but, uh, I would like to know what happened to Frog Fractions 2.

3225
02:41:35,660 --> 02:41:37,820
Maybe that could be the order 1886.

3226
02:41:39,260 --> 02:41:43,100
All of a sudden, you know, like 30 days in, we're going to get some frogs appearing.

3227
02:41:45,980 --> 02:41:47,980
It isn't just five hours long.

3228
02:41:47,980 --> 02:41:49,100
It's Frog Fractions.

3229
02:41:49,100 --> 02:41:54,860
Uh, Sega is clarifying in chat that no, only when the gig is up, apparently is, is the

3230
02:41:54,860 --> 02:41:58,300
thing is where the, the Kickstarter backers get it on that.

3231
02:41:58,300 --> 02:41:58,700
All right.

3232
02:41:58,700 --> 02:42:03,020
Anyhow, last but not least tonight, one more story for you guys.

3233
02:42:03,020 --> 02:42:08,460
And, um, I had to pick this one because what better note to end on tonight than something

3234
02:42:08,460 --> 02:42:11,180
completely self-referential.

3235
02:42:11,180 --> 02:42:14,460
After all, last week was President's Day.

3236
02:42:14,460 --> 02:42:19,260
After all, President's Day was on a Monday and you got to love games journalism sites.

3237
02:42:19,260 --> 02:42:20,140
God bless them.

3238
02:42:20,140 --> 02:42:24,700
They'll find anything remotely related to a video game to run a story and get some clicks.

3239
02:42:24,940 --> 02:42:29,420
But I am totally okay with this one because Destructoid ran an article on President's

3240
02:42:29,420 --> 02:42:32,940
Day called We Salute You, President Cat.

3241
02:42:32,940 --> 02:42:38,700
And it actually said, Sukiban Shacharina, also known as President Cat, was one of those games

3242
02:42:38,700 --> 02:42:41,340
destined to never leave Japan despite our pleas.

3243
02:42:41,340 --> 02:42:44,780
Back in 2009, Western fans petitioned for a localization.

3244
02:42:45,420 --> 02:42:46,140
Who could that be?

3245
02:42:47,260 --> 02:42:51,500
But this mini game collection about a CEO cat was perhaps ahead of its time.

3246
02:42:51,500 --> 02:42:52,940
It sold miserably.

3247
02:42:52,940 --> 02:42:55,740
No matter, our love for Rina is unwavering.

3248
02:42:55,740 --> 02:42:56,620
Just look at that face.

3249
02:42:56,620 --> 02:42:57,740
That was a whole article right there.

3250
02:42:57,740 --> 02:42:58,540
Poor Rina.

3251
02:42:58,540 --> 02:43:02,380
Sorry I just read the whole damn thing on air, but, you know, props to Destructoid.

3252
02:43:02,380 --> 02:43:06,860
Go give him a click for running that article because that just made me giggle because I

3253
02:43:06,860 --> 02:43:08,460
thought back to when we did that.

3254
02:43:09,100 --> 02:43:14,380
President Cat is not the literal translation of that name, right?

3255
02:43:14,380 --> 02:43:16,540
Sukiban is like a female delinquent.

3256
02:43:17,340 --> 02:43:22,620
Shacho is like a corporate leader, if I remember correctly, like a president of a company or

3257
02:43:22,620 --> 02:43:23,180
CEO.

3258
02:43:23,180 --> 02:43:26,300
So you have basically delinquent bitch in charge.

3259
02:43:27,260 --> 02:43:28,220
Rina.

3260
02:43:28,220 --> 02:43:32,620
And I don't think HBIC cat has that same ring to it.

3261
02:43:33,180 --> 02:43:34,940
The head bitch cat.

3262
02:43:34,940 --> 02:43:37,260
Although, I kind of like that now.

3263
02:43:38,460 --> 02:43:39,500
It's a different year.

3264
02:43:39,500 --> 02:43:41,340
2015, the atmosphere is different.

3265
02:43:41,340 --> 02:43:43,500
An unspayed female cat is called a queen.

3266
02:43:45,100 --> 02:43:48,380
So anyway, the point is, I'm loving it.

3267
02:43:48,940 --> 02:43:54,300
Essentially, Dark Soccer, you said, and you were the one who was like, so it's like President

3268
02:43:54,300 --> 02:43:54,620
Cat.

3269
02:43:54,620 --> 02:43:56,700
And then we all took the ball and ran with it.

3270
02:43:56,700 --> 02:43:58,700
We're like, President Cat, yes.

3271
02:43:58,700 --> 02:43:59,660
Vote President Cat.

3272
02:43:59,660 --> 02:44:01,900
Who wouldn't fucking play a game called President Cat?

3273
02:44:01,900 --> 02:44:07,980
And now, like, the accepted Western name of this game is President Cat.

3274
02:44:07,980 --> 02:44:09,420
Everyone, you're welcome.

3275
02:44:09,420 --> 02:44:13,660
I wonder if someone were to put out a game similar to that called President Cat if they

3276
02:44:13,660 --> 02:44:15,340
could be sued by that company.

3277
02:44:15,340 --> 02:44:16,700
Well, I think that company went under.

3278
02:44:17,660 --> 02:44:27,420
You know what, President Cat Bankrupt Company, we need to talk to you and Bobby and a few

3279
02:44:27,420 --> 02:44:27,980
people.

3280
02:44:27,980 --> 02:44:29,100
And Steve, get Steve back.

3281
02:44:29,100 --> 02:44:30,380
And we'll get Steve back.

3282
02:44:30,380 --> 02:44:32,300
Well, I still need a CEO for my game.

3283
02:44:32,300 --> 02:44:35,660
And it was going to be a dog CEO, but I can be swayed.

3284
02:44:35,660 --> 02:44:38,380
Akuma JP in chat says, but the game was horrible.

3285
02:44:38,380 --> 02:44:43,500
Now, wait a minute, because even if the game only sold 100 copies, which, by the way, I

3286
02:44:43,500 --> 02:44:47,500
want to see the receipts, because that story was ran on some website.

3287
02:44:47,500 --> 02:44:49,820
But where was the receipts to prove that?

3288
02:44:49,820 --> 02:44:51,260
Because I have a copy.

3289
02:44:51,260 --> 02:44:55,900
Considering we got people here in the States to import that game.

3290
02:44:55,900 --> 02:44:57,580
Loki bought that game.

3291
02:44:57,580 --> 02:45:03,420
Like, was OLR really responsible for, like, 10% of the sales of this game?

3292
02:45:03,420 --> 02:45:05,260
Because I kind of don't think that's the case.

3293
02:45:05,260 --> 02:45:10,220
Like, I'm not that stuck on myself with this program that I think we had that big of an

3294
02:45:10,220 --> 02:45:10,700
impact.

3295
02:45:11,420 --> 02:45:17,020
See, I think that we should do our own President Cat and have it just full of OLR in jokes

3296
02:45:17,020 --> 02:45:18,300
and just crazy shit.

3297
02:45:19,020 --> 02:45:27,180
But we would be remiss if we didn't have a nod to one of the greatest Sukeban characters

3298
02:45:27,180 --> 02:45:30,940
ever who used to beat people up with yo-yos.

3299
02:45:30,940 --> 02:45:35,260
But the point was, just to remind everybody, the game wasn't that bad.

3300
02:45:35,900 --> 02:45:40,620
It was a little silly, but you played a cat in minigames.

3301
02:45:40,620 --> 02:45:45,340
Like, the Incredible Crisis.

3302
02:45:45,340 --> 02:45:47,500
It was like an Incredible Crisis, but with a cat.

3303
02:45:47,500 --> 02:45:48,700
And it was funny.

3304
02:45:48,700 --> 02:45:54,060
And we played it, because Loki imported it, and we had a region-free Wii, and we checked

3305
02:45:54,060 --> 02:45:54,860
that out, and it was fun.

3306
02:45:54,860 --> 02:45:57,180
I need to region mod my Wii so I can play that game.

3307
02:45:57,180 --> 02:45:58,460
Yeah, it was a lot of fun.

3308
02:45:59,340 --> 02:46:04,540
And remember, the whole point behind that was, they were putting shit out on shelves.

3309
02:46:04,940 --> 02:46:11,580
You know, Barbie's jewel-collecting adventures, and shitty Flash game adapted for Wii Part

3310
02:46:11,580 --> 02:46:12,940
2 types of things.

3311
02:46:12,940 --> 02:46:17,500
There was so much shovelware on the Wii, I think the point behind that whole rant in

3312
02:46:17,500 --> 02:46:23,660
the first place was, why can't we get an awesome concept like this, with all this poo-poo

3313
02:46:23,660 --> 02:46:27,100
crap-crap that's out on the Wii, that in 2009, there was a lot of crap.

3314
02:46:27,100 --> 02:46:30,700
You can't tell me if that game came over here, that people wouldn't eat that up.

3315
02:46:31,660 --> 02:46:33,500
Because, people love cats.

3316
02:46:33,500 --> 02:46:38,300
People love cats doing anything, especially if it came out around the time, was it, that

3317
02:46:38,300 --> 02:46:40,460
was 2009, why couldn't, you know.

3318
02:46:41,340 --> 02:46:45,660
At least Destructoid's on our side, because that's not the first time they ran a President

3319
02:46:45,660 --> 02:46:46,380
Cat story.

3320
02:46:46,380 --> 02:46:49,340
I think they ran a President Cat story when it first happened, and I want to say President

3321
02:46:49,340 --> 02:46:53,580
Cat came up again on their site, when they were talking about, because like, remember

3322
02:46:53,580 --> 02:46:53,740
how-

3323
02:46:53,740 --> 02:46:56,220
It was Wii games that were kicked off, you know.

3324
02:46:56,220 --> 02:47:00,300
It was Operation Rainfall, what should they focus on next, type of thing, because you

3325
02:47:00,300 --> 02:47:03,100
know, everything that was on their wish list, they got, right?

3326
02:47:03,100 --> 02:47:09,180
Was Xenoblade, and not Last Guardian, you didn't get that last story, and Pandora's

3327
02:47:09,180 --> 02:47:12,700
Tower or whatever, so they got all those games, I think there was an article like, what should

3328
02:47:12,700 --> 02:47:15,900
they do now, and President Cat was one of those games.

3329
02:47:15,900 --> 02:47:16,700
So, anyway.

3330
02:47:18,700 --> 02:47:19,740
Just wanted to throw that out there.

3331
02:47:21,100 --> 02:47:21,660
Good times.

3332
02:47:22,220 --> 02:47:23,740
Let's do it, let's open the Skype line.

3333
02:47:23,740 --> 02:47:28,220
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

3334
02:47:28,220 --> 02:47:32,220
Don't be shy, if you want to get in, call now, because we're not going to have the opportunity

3335
02:47:32,220 --> 02:47:36,220
open very long, since it's already midnight on the East Coast, 9 o'clock here on the West

3336
02:47:36,220 --> 02:47:37,580
Coast, but we've had a good long show tonight.

3337
02:47:38,220 --> 02:47:40,940
I will go around the room and check if there's any last minute stories while we wait to see

3338
02:47:40,940 --> 02:47:42,460
if Skype lights up at all.

3339
02:47:42,460 --> 02:47:42,860
Loki?

3340
02:47:44,700 --> 02:47:45,020
Nope.

3341
02:47:45,580 --> 02:47:46,700
No last minute stories?

3342
02:47:46,700 --> 02:47:50,620
I don't have any unfortunately, and I was looking too, I was trying to find something.

3343
02:47:50,620 --> 02:47:51,580
We're trying?

3344
02:47:51,580 --> 02:47:56,060
Alright, that's okay, because we do have a call coming in, so let's get to our calls

3345
02:47:56,060 --> 02:47:56,540
tonight.

3346
02:47:56,620 --> 02:47:58,060
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

3347
02:47:58,860 --> 02:47:59,900
Hey, this is Akdeft.

3348
02:47:59,900 --> 02:48:01,340
Hey, Akdeft, what's on your mind, buddy?

3349
02:48:02,460 --> 02:48:06,300
Well, I have a lot of stuff on my mind, like President Cat.

3350
02:48:06,300 --> 02:48:08,460
Remember when Joystiq ran the article, too?

3351
02:48:08,460 --> 02:48:09,180
I do.

3352
02:48:09,180 --> 02:48:10,460
Wasn't that your fault?

3353
02:48:10,460 --> 02:48:10,700
Yeah.

3354
02:48:12,700 --> 02:48:15,100
Yeah, you emailed them the tip or something, right?

3355
02:48:15,820 --> 02:48:21,340
Yeah, I think I emailed them an article you wrote on the old OLR page.

3356
02:48:21,340 --> 02:48:23,500
Oh yeah, back when I actually had articles on that site.

3357
02:48:23,500 --> 02:48:23,900
Yeah, yeah.

3358
02:48:24,620 --> 02:48:30,380
Because I seem to recall our tweets, I mean, this is again, this is like six years ago

3359
02:48:30,380 --> 02:48:35,820
at this point, believe it or not, our tweets to the company were getting read, and they

3360
02:48:35,820 --> 02:48:40,940
started, they basically were doing the very Japanese humble equivalent of, what the fuck

3361
02:48:40,940 --> 02:48:43,980
is happening right now, type of thing on their Twitter.

3362
02:48:43,980 --> 02:48:47,900
And so I remember writing an article at Orange Lounge Radio about like, here's what's going

3363
02:48:47,900 --> 02:48:49,900
on and why we're all trying to get President Cat.

3364
02:48:49,900 --> 02:48:50,620
And they took our hashtag.

3365
02:48:51,260 --> 02:48:52,540
Yeah, they took our hashtag.

3366
02:48:53,100 --> 02:48:54,540
They called it President Cat.

3367
02:48:55,340 --> 02:48:56,940
So that was, I loved it.

3368
02:48:56,940 --> 02:48:57,500
I loved it.

3369
02:48:57,500 --> 02:49:01,740
So yeah, and then you went to Joystiq with that, and then I'm sure a ton of other sites

3370
02:49:01,740 --> 02:49:02,780
kind of copy paste from there.

3371
02:49:03,740 --> 02:49:08,220
In the 13 year history of this show, that's like the one thing that went viral.

3372
02:49:09,580 --> 02:49:10,220
Yeah.

3373
02:49:10,220 --> 02:49:13,340
That and something that got us a cease and desist from Namco, but we won't go there.

3374
02:49:15,420 --> 02:49:22,300
Oh, well, anyways, I wanted to talk about another thing coming up soon in a few weeks.

3375
02:49:23,180 --> 02:49:31,500
That I'm going to Mexico City, to what it's called the Distrito Pedal here, to the Zelda

3376
02:49:31,500 --> 02:49:33,740
Symphony of the Goddess concert.

3377
02:49:33,740 --> 02:49:34,140
Nice.

3378
02:49:34,700 --> 02:49:36,380
And I'm pretty excited about it.

3379
02:49:37,580 --> 02:49:43,260
Last year, they, well, not last year, like two years ago, but it wasn't, I think December,

3380
02:49:43,260 --> 02:49:44,940
so more or less.

3381
02:49:45,900 --> 02:49:52,940
Friends from over there from Mexico City went and they talk really good stuff about it.

3382
02:49:53,660 --> 02:49:59,420
And they pretty much told me, you have to come, you have to go and see the concert.

3383
02:49:59,420 --> 02:50:04,220
You have to listen and you have to pretty much live the experience.

3384
02:50:04,220 --> 02:50:12,380
So yeah, eventually I did promise them that if Zelda of the Goddess concert would return

3385
02:50:12,380 --> 02:50:13,820
to Mexico, I would go.

3386
02:50:14,540 --> 02:50:19,100
And yeah, the return, it's going to be in Monterrey also.

3387
02:50:19,980 --> 02:50:23,580
And in Mexico City, I'm going to, again, the Mexico City concert.

3388
02:50:23,580 --> 02:50:32,700
And yeah, again, I'm pretty excited to just go there and hear all the songs and pretty

3389
02:50:32,700 --> 02:50:35,740
much live the, sorry, live the experience.

3390
02:50:36,860 --> 02:50:38,540
I'm really excited for you.

3391
02:50:38,540 --> 02:50:42,300
I wish I was able to go see, it's going to be in San Jose, or I think I might have just

3392
02:50:42,300 --> 02:50:42,620
missed it.

3393
02:50:42,620 --> 02:50:46,540
Like it was just here and I wanted to go see it, but just, you know, there's so much other

3394
02:50:46,540 --> 02:50:47,180
stuff going on.

3395
02:50:47,180 --> 02:50:48,460
I don't always get out to everything.

3396
02:50:48,460 --> 02:50:55,340
So, but I'm excited to hear that you're going and to get a little wrap up here on the show

3397
02:50:55,340 --> 02:50:55,820
afterwards.

3398
02:50:56,700 --> 02:50:57,420
Yeah, definitely.

3399
02:50:57,420 --> 02:51:05,100
When, well, when I go to the concert, I will eventually, well, talk to you guys and probably

3400
02:51:05,100 --> 02:51:07,500
write an article for the Vlog Network.

3401
02:51:07,500 --> 02:51:07,820
Yeah.

3402
02:51:07,820 --> 02:51:08,540
It'd be awesome.

3403
02:51:08,540 --> 02:51:11,500
The return to, I love that song, hopefully.

3404
02:51:13,100 --> 02:51:13,660
Love it.

3405
02:51:13,660 --> 02:51:18,780
Hey, I got to ask while you're on the line, the Wii U had kind of a big release this week.

3406
02:51:18,780 --> 02:51:20,460
Surely you have something to say about it?

3407
02:51:21,340 --> 02:51:22,380
More or less, yeah.

3408
02:51:23,660 --> 02:51:29,660
Yeah, of course, if you know me and have listened to the show for many years, you know, I love

3409
02:51:29,660 --> 02:51:33,420
Kirby and yeah, I did get Kirby and the Rainbow Course.

3410
02:51:33,420 --> 02:51:34,140
And how is it?

3411
02:51:34,780 --> 02:51:39,820
It's not, well, I don't know how I can put it.

3412
02:51:39,820 --> 02:51:40,700
It's good.

3413
02:51:40,700 --> 02:51:41,100
Definitely.

3414
02:51:41,100 --> 02:51:41,740
It's good.

3415
02:51:41,740 --> 02:51:43,260
If you like Kirby, you'll love this.

3416
02:51:44,300 --> 02:51:47,660
If you like Canvas Course, you'll definitely love this also.

3417
02:51:48,460 --> 02:51:55,180
But I don't know how to put it yet because I have only played the first world.

3418
02:51:56,140 --> 02:51:58,860
Well, basically the first three levels and a boss.

3419
02:51:59,820 --> 02:52:08,780
So the game, I don't know if I can compare it to Canvas Course, but it's definitely the

3420
02:52:08,780 --> 02:52:09,500
same mechanic.

3421
02:52:10,140 --> 02:52:12,460
But it feels completely different.

3422
02:52:12,460 --> 02:52:13,980
Also, it's really weird.

3423
02:52:14,860 --> 02:52:16,620
I'm definitely loving it.

3424
02:52:17,500 --> 02:52:21,740
And I pretty much, yes, playing this on multiplayer.

3425
02:52:21,740 --> 02:52:23,900
multiplayer makes the experience way better.

3426
02:52:25,180 --> 02:52:29,740
Interesting that you hesitated there a little bit, though, because a lot of people on Twitter

3427
02:52:29,740 --> 02:52:31,260
are really eating this game up.

3428
02:52:31,260 --> 02:52:32,460
So I was really surprised.

3429
02:52:32,460 --> 02:52:34,540
I would have thought you'd be falling right in line with that.

3430
02:52:34,540 --> 02:52:36,940
But maybe you just have to give it a little more.

3431
02:52:36,940 --> 02:52:38,300
And you said you only played the first world.

3432
02:52:38,300 --> 02:52:42,220
So maybe it'll start to really hook you a little later on.

3433
02:52:42,220 --> 02:52:46,220
Yeah, I've been busy with other stuff and work.

3434
02:52:46,220 --> 02:52:49,340
And I haven't been able to play a lot of games.

3435
02:52:49,340 --> 02:52:54,860
I have my Doris Mask still wrapped in Spox and Monster Hunter 2.

3436
02:52:54,860 --> 02:52:55,820
I know how it goes.

3437
02:52:55,820 --> 02:52:56,700
I know how it goes.

3438
02:52:56,700 --> 02:52:59,580
So yeah, I barely made some time to play Kirby.

3439
02:52:59,580 --> 02:53:01,660
But again, it's good.

3440
02:53:03,020 --> 02:53:06,300
For the $40 you pay for the game, it's definitely great.

3441
02:53:07,020 --> 02:53:10,460
It's definitely something anyone should check out, at least.

3442
02:53:11,980 --> 02:53:17,180
But again, if you're looking for something like Canvas Course, it's kind of like that,

3443
02:53:17,180 --> 02:53:19,260
but not exactly like that.

3444
02:53:19,260 --> 02:53:21,100
So again, it's weird.

3445
02:53:21,820 --> 02:53:22,300
But yeah.

3446
02:53:22,860 --> 02:53:23,340
All right.

3447
02:53:23,980 --> 02:53:26,380
Well, I'm gonna let you go so we can get some more calls.

3448
02:53:26,380 --> 02:53:27,500
But thanks for the call.

3449
02:53:27,500 --> 02:53:28,460
Hey, thanks for having me.

3450
02:53:28,460 --> 02:53:30,300
And hope you have more time to play Kirby this week.

3451
02:53:31,100 --> 02:53:31,740
I'll try.

3452
02:53:31,740 --> 02:53:32,620
All right, take care, buddy.

3453
02:53:33,420 --> 02:53:33,980
Thanks.

3454
02:53:33,980 --> 02:53:37,500
All right, 1877 game OLR or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

3455
02:53:37,500 --> 02:53:39,660
But the phone is lighting right back up.

3456
02:53:39,660 --> 02:53:40,780
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

3457
02:53:40,780 --> 02:53:41,180
Who's this?

3458
02:53:41,740 --> 02:53:42,220
Hey, what's up?

3459
02:53:42,220 --> 02:53:42,860
This is SkyJudo.

3460
02:53:42,860 --> 02:53:43,500
Hey, SkyJudo.

3461
02:53:43,500 --> 02:53:44,540
How you doing this week?

3462
02:53:44,540 --> 02:53:45,180
I'm all right, man.

3463
02:53:45,180 --> 02:53:45,420
How are you?

3464
02:53:45,980 --> 02:53:46,460
Not too bad.

3465
02:53:46,460 --> 02:53:47,100
What's on your mind?

3466
02:53:47,660 --> 02:53:48,140
Not much.

3467
02:53:48,140 --> 02:53:51,020
I just want to address what you were talking about earlier with the

3468
02:53:51,020 --> 02:53:53,580
why did people buy the new 3DS.

3469
02:53:53,580 --> 02:53:54,300
Sure.

3470
02:53:54,300 --> 02:53:56,940
I'm one of those people that got 3DS day one.

3471
02:53:57,500 --> 02:54:01,340
And the main reason why I got it is just for the simple fact of the upgrade.

3472
02:54:01,340 --> 02:54:04,540
It's an improved version over the last 3DS.

3473
02:54:05,420 --> 02:54:11,420
Me, I was one of the people that didn't really see much of a problem with the original 3DS.

3474
02:54:11,420 --> 02:54:16,140
Like, I didn't experience the 3D issues or any other type of stuff.

3475
02:54:17,900 --> 02:54:22,460
The only thing I noticed about the original 3DS was how slow some of the games started

3476
02:54:22,460 --> 02:54:27,740
to become later on when I got into Mario Golf and the new Smash Brothers.

3477
02:54:27,740 --> 02:54:30,700
I noticed those games took a really long time to load up.

3478
02:54:30,700 --> 02:54:33,820
Does the new 3DS really speed that up?

3479
02:54:35,820 --> 02:54:41,100
Yeah, well, some things that were laggy with the original are still laggy with the new

3480
02:54:41,100 --> 02:54:42,220
one, like Pokemon.

3481
02:54:42,860 --> 02:54:46,380
One of the issues that people have with Pokemon is when you did 3D battles, the game would

3482
02:54:46,380 --> 02:54:48,540
lag, and that's still there.

3483
02:54:48,540 --> 02:54:53,260
I don't know why that couldn't get cleaned up, but Smash Brothers loads pretty fast.

3484
02:54:53,260 --> 02:54:55,260
Mario Golf is super fast now.

3485
02:54:55,260 --> 02:54:59,900
You can get through tournaments and read your stats and all that stuff without waiting almost

3486
02:54:59,900 --> 02:55:01,740
two minutes just to get through the damn game.

3487
02:55:03,740 --> 02:55:04,060
I don't know.

3488
02:55:04,060 --> 02:55:05,580
Those are probably the only games that I tried out.

3489
02:55:06,060 --> 02:55:06,540
Interesting.

3490
02:55:06,540 --> 02:55:09,900
I actually didn't realize that the new 3DS, I mean, I knew that the chipset and everything

3491
02:55:09,900 --> 02:55:10,940
in there was more powerful.

3492
02:55:10,940 --> 02:55:12,060
Like, I knew that.

3493
02:55:12,060 --> 02:55:16,860
But my, I guess, assumption was that no game was really utilizing that yet.

3494
02:55:16,860 --> 02:55:20,380
And that was part of my hesitation, Kajudo, is that I'm sitting here going, well, there's

3495
02:55:20,380 --> 02:55:24,860
nothing out in America yet that you have to have the new chipset for.

3496
02:55:24,860 --> 02:55:29,340
So, and like Loki said, by the time they release Xenoblade here, they'll probably have a Xenoblade

3497
02:55:29,340 --> 02:55:31,740
3DS that'll sell out in five minutes, right?

3498
02:55:31,740 --> 02:55:36,300
So I'll wait for something like that since I'm not, like, I already have a Zelda 3DS

3499
02:55:36,300 --> 02:55:40,300
and me personally, I prefer that Triforce design way more to Majora's Mask.

3500
02:55:40,300 --> 02:55:43,900
But that's also because I'm more of a classic Zelda fan than I ever was in Majora's Mask,

3501
02:55:43,900 --> 02:55:45,340
although I want to give this new one a try.

3502
02:55:46,140 --> 02:55:46,780
But I digress.

3503
02:55:46,780 --> 02:55:51,820
I did not realize that it would have that big of an impact on the older games.

3504
02:55:53,820 --> 02:55:58,220
I think also people coming at it, it's almost like if you're getting a new system with the,

3505
02:55:58,220 --> 02:56:02,380
it's going to sound silly to say, but it's like you get a new system with the added buttons.

3506
02:56:02,380 --> 02:56:06,700
You have the new, whatever the hell that is, RZ, LZ, whatever the hell they're going to do later.

3507
02:56:06,700 --> 02:56:11,500
I mean, they have some functionality with the new, with the Smash Brothers game.

3508
02:56:12,060 --> 02:56:16,060
It's not that big of a deal, but you can use that button with Smash Brothers.

3509
02:56:16,060 --> 02:56:18,140
That's to set up your Amiibo.

3510
02:56:18,140 --> 02:56:23,260
And don't forget about the little nipple rubbing button on the side.

3511
02:56:23,260 --> 02:56:24,300
What do you think of that nipple?

3512
02:56:25,980 --> 02:56:26,940
That thing's a nipple, man.

3513
02:56:27,820 --> 02:56:29,180
It's a freaking nipple.

3514
02:56:29,180 --> 02:56:31,100
What do you think of the nipple on the 3DS?

3515
02:56:31,100 --> 02:56:36,300
It's so weird to make a YouTube video and hold my 3DS up to like my chest and just start rubbing.

3516
02:56:38,860 --> 02:56:39,100
Yeah.

3517
02:56:39,100 --> 02:56:39,820
Parvert.

3518
02:56:39,820 --> 02:56:40,060
Yeah.

3519
02:56:40,060 --> 02:56:40,540
Parvert.

3520
02:56:41,180 --> 02:56:42,460
That's what it is though.

3521
02:56:42,460 --> 02:56:43,980
Say how much I love my new 3DS.

3522
02:56:43,980 --> 02:56:47,020
But yeah, that's all that is.

3523
02:56:47,020 --> 02:56:48,220
But I mean, it works great.

3524
02:56:48,220 --> 02:56:53,900
And I mean, I'm not, I don't know what other games use it other than Monster Hunter,

3525
02:56:53,900 --> 02:56:55,340
but I play Monster Hunter.

3526
02:56:55,660 --> 02:56:56,860
Final Fantasy.

3527
02:56:56,860 --> 02:56:58,460
Final Fantasy Explorers use that.

3528
02:56:58,460 --> 02:57:01,900
And I only know that because Shane let me play his Japanese one and he had that.

3529
02:57:03,340 --> 02:57:05,740
But I'm assuming that game has to come out here.

3530
02:57:05,740 --> 02:57:08,780
I mean, it's Final Fantasy and Manhunt is well enough here.

3531
02:57:08,780 --> 02:57:11,820
So I just, I would assume that game has to come out here, but maybe it won't.

3532
02:57:11,820 --> 02:57:12,140
I don't know.

3533
02:57:12,140 --> 02:57:13,500
I'm waiting for E3.

3534
02:57:13,500 --> 02:57:17,260
But I'm wondering if the, I know it didn't sell well, but I think the Resident Evil

3535
02:57:17,260 --> 02:57:18,060
game uses it too.

3536
02:57:18,060 --> 02:57:24,380
I know they had a few like shooter type games or something that will use that nipple control.

3537
02:57:24,380 --> 02:57:28,300
But like I said, I played Monster Hunter, so that was another reason.

3538
02:57:28,300 --> 02:57:31,260
I never wanted to invest in that, whatever that thing was.

3539
02:57:31,260 --> 02:57:33,260
What was that stick thing they were talking about?

3540
02:57:33,260 --> 02:57:34,620
No, it was like the little extra.

3541
02:57:35,580 --> 02:57:37,020
Yeah, it took batteries, right?

3542
02:57:37,020 --> 02:57:39,740
That was like the main reason why I didn't want it was because I was like, wait a minute,

3543
02:57:39,740 --> 02:57:41,900
this thing takes AA batteries?

3544
02:57:41,900 --> 02:57:43,500
You got to put AA batteries in this thing?

3545
02:57:43,500 --> 02:57:43,900
Yeah, yeah.

3546
02:57:43,900 --> 02:57:45,180
And that's why I never bothered with it.

3547
02:57:45,180 --> 02:57:46,220
So yeah.

3548
02:57:46,220 --> 02:57:50,220
But yeah, so I mean, it's like I said, it's a big upgrade.

3549
02:57:50,220 --> 02:57:54,860
And plus, I think a lot of people were on the fence and buying the 3DS, you know, because

3550
02:57:54,860 --> 02:57:57,660
they were hearing, you know, that the 3D is not really that great.

3551
02:57:57,660 --> 02:58:00,700
And for some people, you know, they were saying it was like a disappointment.

3552
02:58:00,700 --> 02:58:04,540
So I think some people were on the fence and after those people heard the improvements,

3553
02:58:04,540 --> 02:58:06,060
they actually went out and bought it as well.

3554
02:58:06,060 --> 02:58:07,500
Because I mean, it was selling out everywhere.

3555
02:58:07,500 --> 02:58:09,100
I was surprised that I got one.

3556
02:58:09,100 --> 02:58:14,060
Actually, I had to go to Best Buy and get it that way because GameStop was completely

3557
02:58:14,060 --> 02:58:14,620
sold out.

3558
02:58:14,620 --> 02:58:19,500
That 3D, that 3D enhancement with the head tracking really does work really well, though.

3559
02:58:19,500 --> 02:58:21,580
I mean, that I mean, I'll give the system that.

3560
02:58:21,580 --> 02:58:25,500
For me, though, I just was like, I'm not going to drop that kind of money just for that.

3561
02:58:25,500 --> 02:58:27,020
That's what I saw as the biggest improvement.

3562
02:58:27,020 --> 02:58:31,900
And I was like, I don't really use 3D enough or rely on it enough to really do that.

3563
02:58:31,900 --> 02:58:35,100
But yeah, I mean, that gives me some things to think about.

3564
02:58:35,100 --> 02:58:38,140
I think ultimately, though, I mean, and I've said this in the very beginning, I'm going

3565
02:58:38,140 --> 02:58:42,700
to end up getting a new 3DS eventually, but I'm just waiting for that must have game that's

3566
02:58:42,700 --> 02:58:44,620
probably being announced at E3 this year.

3567
02:58:45,340 --> 02:58:49,180
Yeah, I'm just going to tell you before I hang up, one of the things that made me realize

3568
02:58:49,180 --> 02:58:52,540
how good the 3D is, and the 3D is not the biggest draw of this thing.

3569
02:58:52,540 --> 02:58:57,100
I don't want people thinking at all, if you're not in the 3D, then don't bother with the

3570
02:58:57,100 --> 02:58:57,420
system.

3571
02:58:57,420 --> 02:58:59,100
I mean, it goes beyond the 3D.

3572
02:58:59,100 --> 02:59:02,940
The 3D is not the biggest deal, but I just wanted to mention the 3D because I was playing

3573
02:59:02,940 --> 02:59:05,340
Smash Brothers, and I can't remember what the level was.

3574
02:59:05,340 --> 02:59:11,580
I'm playing one of these cartoon looking levels, and I'm starting swatting in front of my face

3575
02:59:11,580 --> 02:59:14,860
because I'm thinking there's flies flying in front of me like a little bug.

3576
02:59:14,860 --> 02:59:18,060
And that's actually coming off of something moving around in the game in the 3D.

3577
02:59:18,060 --> 02:59:19,180
That's how good the 3D was.

3578
02:59:19,180 --> 02:59:20,940
And I'm just like, wait a minute, that's not a bug.

3579
02:59:20,940 --> 02:59:21,980
That's actually in the game.

3580
02:59:23,340 --> 02:59:25,740
I thought it was like a little gnat or something flying around my screen.

3581
02:59:25,740 --> 02:59:26,460
I'm like, what the hell is that?

3582
02:59:28,060 --> 02:59:29,580
I mean, it literally pops up at you.

3583
02:59:29,580 --> 02:59:36,300
I think if you follow Adam Sessler a lot, when the 3DS first came out, they remember

3584
02:59:36,300 --> 02:59:39,740
how everyone was like, oh, this thing must have been made with angel blood or something

3585
02:59:39,740 --> 02:59:42,540
they were saying about it because it was so crisp and everything.

3586
02:59:42,540 --> 02:59:43,980
Yeah, I remember seeing it.

3587
02:59:43,980 --> 02:59:48,380
And then when it came out, Adam Sessler was saying, wait a minute, that's not the system

3588
02:59:48,380 --> 02:59:51,180
that we saw, that they showed us in the demo.

3589
02:59:51,180 --> 02:59:51,980
That's not the system.

3590
02:59:51,980 --> 02:59:58,140
I wonder if he saw the new 3DS and if he would say that this is closer to what they originally

3591
02:59:58,140 --> 03:00:01,740
saw because he went out and said, that's not the 3DS that we saw.

3592
03:00:01,740 --> 03:00:04,380
The one that they're selling in retail is not the 3DS that we saw.

3593
03:00:04,380 --> 03:00:09,100
I also remember that particular, I was there at E3 that year they first showed the 3DS.

3594
03:00:09,100 --> 03:00:12,700
And I remember just kind of being in awe when they actually were showing it to us.

3595
03:00:12,700 --> 03:00:14,860
And it was like, oh my God, it really does work.

3596
03:00:14,860 --> 03:00:16,700
The 3D on this thing really works.

3597
03:00:16,700 --> 03:00:19,180
Kind of seeing it for the first time was really kind of inspiring.

3598
03:00:19,180 --> 03:00:21,100
But yeah, I don't know.

3599
03:00:21,100 --> 03:00:23,020
Maybe they had a different tracking system there or whatever.

3600
03:00:23,020 --> 03:00:27,180
But I don't remember being really disappointed by the first 3DS model or whatever.

3601
03:00:27,180 --> 03:00:30,300
I was just more blown away by it's 3D without glasses.

3602
03:00:30,300 --> 03:00:33,500
And it was the first time we were really seeing that in mass.

3603
03:00:33,500 --> 03:00:35,980
Anyway, Kajuda, I got to let you go so we can try to squeeze in some more calls.

3604
03:00:35,980 --> 03:00:37,740
But I will leave you with this comment.

3605
03:00:37,740 --> 03:00:42,540
Bonds006 in our chat room over at live.vognore.com says they gave us a condom for the Wii and

3606
03:00:42,540 --> 03:00:44,060
now a nipple for the new 3DS.

3607
03:00:44,620 --> 03:00:45,100
There you go.

3608
03:00:45,980 --> 03:00:46,540
All right.

3609
03:00:46,540 --> 03:00:47,900
Have a good one, my friend.

3610
03:00:47,900 --> 03:00:48,300
You too.

3611
03:00:48,300 --> 03:00:48,540
All right.

3612
03:00:48,540 --> 03:00:48,780
Bye.

3613
03:00:49,500 --> 03:00:52,220
1877 game OLR username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

3614
03:00:52,220 --> 03:00:55,180
I can probably squeeze in one more call here, although we are running a little late.

3615
03:00:55,180 --> 03:00:58,460
And I know some of us have to work Monday morning as do some of you.

3616
03:00:58,460 --> 03:01:00,620
So I can't let things go on too much longer.

3617
03:01:01,180 --> 03:01:04,060
But I will try to squeeze in one more call if somebody wants to try and get in there.

3618
03:01:05,260 --> 03:01:06,140
I know it was lighting up.

3619
03:01:06,140 --> 03:01:07,020
We might have a few more.

3620
03:01:07,020 --> 03:01:07,820
Oh, there we go.

3621
03:01:07,820 --> 03:01:08,780
It's lighting up.

3622
03:01:08,780 --> 03:01:10,220
You got to wait for that delay sometimes.

3623
03:01:10,220 --> 03:01:11,420
Just a little bit of a delay.

3624
03:01:11,420 --> 03:01:12,380
Hi, Orange Launch Radio.

3625
03:01:12,380 --> 03:01:12,780
Who's this?

3626
03:01:13,420 --> 03:01:13,660
Hey.

3627
03:01:13,660 --> 03:01:14,700
Hey, it's Ronva.

3628
03:01:14,700 --> 03:01:15,100
Hey, buddy.

3629
03:01:15,100 --> 03:01:15,580
How you doing?

3630
03:01:16,140 --> 03:01:16,620
Not much.

3631
03:01:16,620 --> 03:01:17,740
Just chilling, relaxing.

3632
03:01:17,740 --> 03:01:18,780
You know how I do.

3633
03:01:18,780 --> 03:01:19,900
Yeah, that's good.

3634
03:01:19,900 --> 03:01:22,380
You've been watching the Oscars on the other television or something?

3635
03:01:23,260 --> 03:01:24,060
Actually, no.

3636
03:01:25,020 --> 03:01:25,660
Come on.

3637
03:01:25,660 --> 03:01:27,660
When OLR is on, my TV is off.

3638
03:01:27,660 --> 03:01:29,100
I respect that.

3639
03:01:29,100 --> 03:01:29,580
I do.

3640
03:01:29,580 --> 03:01:31,180
I see, obviously, it's inevitable.

3641
03:01:31,180 --> 03:01:35,500
Whenever we go up against something big, people are talking about it in chat and even on Twitter.

3642
03:01:35,500 --> 03:01:37,980
I'm trying to look at Twitter like, oh, what's going on in gaming?

3643
03:01:37,980 --> 03:01:39,340
But everybody's talking about the Oscars.

3644
03:01:39,340 --> 03:01:43,420
Apparently, I'm hearing however you might feel about Lady Gaga.

3645
03:01:43,420 --> 03:01:46,380
Apparently, she did some type of tribute to the Sound of Music on the Oscars, and they're

3646
03:01:46,380 --> 03:01:48,060
saying she killed it.

3647
03:01:49,100 --> 03:01:51,180
Some are saying they got goosebumps on how good it was.

3648
03:01:52,220 --> 03:01:53,820
As somebody who actually...

3649
03:01:53,820 --> 03:01:54,780
I don't mind her music at all.

3650
03:01:54,780 --> 03:01:56,540
I think she's a great, great pop artist.

3651
03:01:56,540 --> 03:01:58,140
The Sound of Music will be very strange.

3652
03:01:58,140 --> 03:02:00,300
Well, I'm dying to hear it.

3653
03:02:01,100 --> 03:02:06,220
Well, a friend of mine did take voice acting and singing lessons with her in a class years

3654
03:02:06,220 --> 03:02:06,700
ago.

3655
03:02:06,860 --> 03:02:11,900
Right now, on my Facebook, more people are talking more about how the Lego movie got

3656
03:02:11,900 --> 03:02:16,860
snubbed and the live performance of Everything is Awesome was phenomenal.

3657
03:02:16,860 --> 03:02:17,740
That's what I keep seeing.

3658
03:02:17,740 --> 03:02:18,300
Oh, that's cool.

3659
03:02:18,860 --> 03:02:20,460
We're taking Sarah actually there?

3660
03:02:20,460 --> 03:02:22,380
Oprah got a Lego Oscar.

3661
03:02:22,380 --> 03:02:23,580
I want one.

3662
03:02:23,580 --> 03:02:24,140
How was...

3663
03:02:24,140 --> 03:02:25,820
I want to know how new a Patrick Harris was.

3664
03:02:25,820 --> 03:02:26,940
Like, I don't usually...

3665
03:02:26,940 --> 03:02:30,460
You know, there's part of me that kind of doesn't really care about the Oscars, especially

3666
03:02:30,460 --> 03:02:31,900
when I haven't seen a one.

3667
03:02:31,900 --> 03:02:34,460
I don't think I've seen a single one of the nominated movies this year.

3668
03:02:34,460 --> 03:02:36,060
Was Interstellar nominated?

3669
03:02:36,060 --> 03:02:36,940
I have no idea.

3670
03:02:36,940 --> 03:02:37,820
See, that's where I'm at.

3671
03:02:37,820 --> 03:02:40,460
I'm like, if Interstellar was nominated, then I saw that one.

3672
03:02:40,460 --> 03:02:42,700
And if it wasn't nominated, I'm kind of surprised that it wasn't.

3673
03:02:42,700 --> 03:02:45,420
But anyway, I just think that's just how out of it I am these days.

3674
03:02:46,380 --> 03:02:46,780
Anyway.

3675
03:02:48,300 --> 03:02:51,980
So Rob, tell me, did you get The Cross of St. Olaf?

3676
03:02:55,420 --> 03:02:58,620
I saved my three Hail Betty Whites for missing the Oscars tonight.

3677
03:02:58,620 --> 03:03:00,300
Or I'm gonna lose my card.

3678
03:03:01,500 --> 03:03:02,140
Something like that.

3679
03:03:02,380 --> 03:03:06,300
Yeah, yes, I'm prepared.

3680
03:03:06,300 --> 03:03:06,940
Hail Betty White.

3681
03:03:06,940 --> 03:03:07,660
Hail Betty White.

3682
03:03:08,620 --> 03:03:10,780
Okay, two more things I want to touch on.

3683
03:03:10,780 --> 03:03:11,980
I'm gonna get the heck up on out of here.

3684
03:03:11,980 --> 03:03:13,980
Now, you talked about President Cat.

3685
03:03:13,980 --> 03:03:19,100
Now, I was one of those that shared this on social media back then.

3686
03:03:19,100 --> 03:03:24,540
And one of my friends, he ran the game room for Zenkai Con.

3687
03:03:24,540 --> 03:03:28,860
And he told me he got a copy of the game for the game room.

3688
03:03:29,260 --> 03:03:32,460
And I went to check the game from time to time.

3689
03:03:32,460 --> 03:03:35,500
Let's just say there were a lot of people waiting around to play this game.

3690
03:03:35,500 --> 03:03:36,140
Thank you.

3691
03:03:36,700 --> 03:03:37,420
Thank you.

3692
03:03:37,420 --> 03:03:41,660
See, and again, there's another copy that essentially OLR sold.

3693
03:03:41,660 --> 03:03:44,060
I mean, Rama sold it, but threw us, right?

3694
03:03:44,060 --> 03:03:44,540
No, no, no.

3695
03:03:44,540 --> 03:03:45,980
OLR sold it.

3696
03:03:45,980 --> 03:03:47,260
I just endorsed it.

3697
03:03:47,260 --> 03:03:49,580
So how did you tell me that that game only sold?

3698
03:03:51,580 --> 03:03:55,500
Did it sell 100 copies in America because of OLR?

3699
03:03:55,500 --> 03:03:57,340
I would maybe, although that's a lot.

3700
03:03:57,340 --> 03:03:59,420
I don't think we have 100 people that listen to this show.

3701
03:03:59,420 --> 03:04:03,260
But I would believe that maybe there's that.

3702
03:04:03,260 --> 03:04:07,820
But only 100 copies in Japan when we know all these people that I know bought them.

3703
03:04:08,860 --> 03:04:10,940
That's why I'm like, I want to see the receipts on this game.

3704
03:04:16,940 --> 03:04:17,580
That's great.

3705
03:04:17,580 --> 03:04:19,660
I'm so glad to hear that was a hit at anime cons.

3706
03:04:19,660 --> 03:04:22,060
In fact, I wish somebody would take it to more anime cons.

3707
03:04:22,380 --> 03:04:27,180
If there ever is, heaven forbid, a vogcon, like we need another fucking con.

3708
03:04:27,180 --> 03:04:32,140
But if there ever is a vogcon or whatever, then we'll have to have President Kat in the

3709
03:04:32,140 --> 03:04:32,940
game room.

3710
03:04:32,940 --> 03:04:36,940
Although, since pretty much we tell people, just go to Dragon Con because we're the most

3711
03:04:36,940 --> 03:04:40,300
vog host show up anyway, maybe we'll just have President Kat up in the hotel room.

3712
03:04:40,300 --> 03:04:40,620
I don't know.

3713
03:04:41,340 --> 03:04:41,900
Fair enough.

3714
03:04:44,060 --> 03:04:49,020
And you were talking about the Fugu question week about multiplayer in the arcade.

3715
03:04:49,020 --> 03:04:51,420
Now, it wasn't in the arcade.

3716
03:04:51,500 --> 03:04:53,100
This was at home.

3717
03:04:53,100 --> 03:04:58,140
Years ago, I lived with some friends and my friend's older brother used to work the night

3718
03:04:58,140 --> 03:04:59,820
shift at this ice rink.

3719
03:04:59,820 --> 03:05:04,380
So he started taking the N64 down because there's nothing else to do on night shift,

3720
03:05:04,380 --> 03:05:04,700
you know?

3721
03:05:04,700 --> 03:05:05,980
So everything's already locked down.

3722
03:05:06,860 --> 03:05:11,900
So I got wind of them, they were playing Conqueror's Bash Fur Day.

3723
03:05:11,900 --> 03:05:13,500
I'm like, what?

3724
03:05:13,500 --> 03:05:14,940
Is everyone taking turns playing?

3725
03:05:14,940 --> 03:05:15,580
I'm like, oh, wait.

3726
03:05:17,100 --> 03:05:18,460
Multiplayer.

3727
03:05:18,460 --> 03:05:25,180
So we had a tradition of going down to the ice rink two, three times a week.

3728
03:05:25,740 --> 03:05:33,420
We would sit there around N64, 20 inch big screen at night, and just sit there and just

3729
03:05:33,420 --> 03:05:36,220
multiplayer the hell out of each other on every level.

3730
03:05:36,220 --> 03:05:39,500
Now, it would be me and my friend's oldest brother.

3731
03:05:40,940 --> 03:05:43,740
We were pretentious assholes for sniping.

3732
03:05:43,740 --> 03:05:47,900
So we would snipe everyone and then eventually, whatever levels it is where you could just

3733
03:05:47,900 --> 03:05:52,300
snipe, we would just find a bunker and just sit there and just try to snipe each other

3734
03:05:52,300 --> 03:05:57,180
from either side of the stage, not paying attention to his two other brothers trying

3735
03:05:57,180 --> 03:05:58,620
to kill us and each other.

3736
03:06:03,100 --> 03:06:07,660
We'd sit there talking like we're old buddies in Vietnam and stuff like that.

3737
03:06:07,660 --> 03:06:10,940
It was just ridiculous, but it was just a fun and just amazing.

3738
03:06:11,980 --> 03:06:13,180
You have the best stories.

3739
03:06:13,180 --> 03:06:14,780
I always think I have good memories.

3740
03:06:15,180 --> 03:06:17,340
Then it's some fricking con.

3741
03:06:17,340 --> 03:06:18,860
You create more memories.

3742
03:06:18,860 --> 03:06:19,740
I hope you keep a book.

3743
03:06:20,460 --> 03:06:22,540
Look, Rob, let me tell you something.

3744
03:06:22,540 --> 03:06:25,180
You mentioned earlier that your memory is bad.

3745
03:06:25,180 --> 03:06:26,540
My memory is bad, too.

3746
03:06:26,540 --> 03:06:29,420
At least you have somebody to remind you.

3747
03:06:30,220 --> 03:06:35,820
I have someone who reminds me I have a bad memory and not telling me what I need to remember.

3748
03:06:38,460 --> 03:06:39,420
I am lucky.

3749
03:06:39,420 --> 03:06:42,300
Well, I do have Jamie for that, but I am lucky to have Alan.

3750
03:06:42,300 --> 03:06:42,860
What can I say?

3751
03:06:43,580 --> 03:06:43,980
All right.

3752
03:06:43,980 --> 03:06:45,500
Oh, sappy, sappy, gross.

3753
03:06:45,500 --> 03:06:45,820
All right.

3754
03:06:46,700 --> 03:06:47,980
Anyway, I'm going to go ahead and let you go.

3755
03:06:47,980 --> 03:06:48,700
OK, my friend?

3756
03:06:49,260 --> 03:06:49,580
All right.

3757
03:06:49,580 --> 03:06:50,300
Take care, bro.

3758
03:06:50,300 --> 03:06:50,700
Take care.

3759
03:06:50,700 --> 03:06:51,980
I'm going to miss you at PAX East.

3760
03:06:53,020 --> 03:06:55,100
Well, we'll see.

3761
03:06:55,100 --> 03:06:55,500
All right.

3762
03:06:55,500 --> 03:06:56,220
Take care.

3763
03:06:56,220 --> 03:06:56,540
All right.

3764
03:06:56,540 --> 03:06:57,020
Bye.

3765
03:06:57,020 --> 03:06:57,520
Bye.

3766
03:06:58,140 --> 03:07:00,780
Ramo will find a way, even though all those tickets are long gone.

3767
03:07:00,780 --> 03:07:01,580
He'll find a way.

3768
03:07:01,580 --> 03:07:03,260
He'll be like, there's some forum.

3769
03:07:03,260 --> 03:07:06,060
I knew a guy who knew a guy had PAX East tickets.

3770
03:07:06,060 --> 03:07:06,860
All right.

3771
03:07:06,860 --> 03:07:08,380
That is going to do it for Skype calls tonight.

3772
03:07:08,380 --> 03:07:11,340
I'm so sorry, but just due to time, we are running really long this week.

3773
03:07:12,300 --> 03:07:15,980
Having Steve here took up a little bit of a chunk of time in the beginning of the show,

3774
03:07:15,980 --> 03:07:19,180
although we love talking to him and wish Flom the best of success.

3775
03:07:19,900 --> 03:07:22,460
But that is it for the main part of the show tonight.

3776
03:07:22,460 --> 03:07:23,580
It's time to wrap things up.

3777
03:07:23,580 --> 03:07:27,500
I want to thank everybody for tuning in and listening to another episode of OLR.

3778
03:07:27,500 --> 03:07:29,740
Your support means so much, you guys.

3779
03:07:29,740 --> 03:07:34,380
The fact that many of you here live would choose to listen to us over the Oscars,

3780
03:07:34,380 --> 03:07:36,060
that really does mean an awful lot.

3781
03:07:36,060 --> 03:07:39,260
And even if you did end up watching the Oscars this week and you just happen to be listening

3782
03:07:39,340 --> 03:07:43,180
to us on the podcast feed, hey, you made it through a nearly three and a half hour show

3783
03:07:44,540 --> 03:07:47,100
while you were at work on your commute or what have you.

3784
03:07:47,100 --> 03:07:51,180
And I thank you for spending time during your week with us.

3785
03:07:51,740 --> 03:07:53,100
And we want to hear from more of you.

3786
03:07:53,100 --> 03:07:54,780
So please tweet at us at OLR.

3787
03:07:56,060 --> 03:07:59,900
Send us a Facebook message on Facebook or whatever people do.

3788
03:08:00,700 --> 03:08:01,740
Send us a Snapchat.

3789
03:08:02,620 --> 03:08:03,820
Just keep it clean.

3790
03:08:03,820 --> 03:08:05,660
No, tweet at us.

3791
03:08:05,740 --> 03:08:06,220
Email us.

3792
03:08:06,220 --> 03:08:09,180
Participate at orangeontrady.com or post on our forums.

3793
03:08:09,180 --> 03:08:10,460
Just let us know you're out there.

3794
03:08:10,460 --> 03:08:13,820
Even if you're like the guy who emailed us tonight that was like, hey, I just want to say hey.

3795
03:08:13,820 --> 03:08:15,100
What's up?

3796
03:08:15,100 --> 03:08:15,600
What's up?

3797
03:08:18,220 --> 03:08:21,020
And now my response will be not much ASL.

3798
03:08:23,980 --> 03:08:27,500
All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight,

3799
03:08:27,500 --> 03:08:30,300
because it is time to wrap up the show and get on out of here.

3800
03:08:30,300 --> 03:08:34,140
If you did enjoy Orange on Trady though, please remember, tell a friend or five about the show.

3801
03:08:34,140 --> 03:08:34,700
Spread the word.

3802
03:08:34,700 --> 03:08:36,700
It is the show where every gamer has a voice,

3803
03:08:36,700 --> 03:08:39,500
but we can't spread those voices if they're not out there to share them.

3804
03:08:39,500 --> 03:08:45,180
So please bring more awesome people into this little family we have here at VOG Network and OLR.

3805
03:08:46,220 --> 03:08:49,500
We will be back in seven days time Sunday to do all over again,

3806
03:08:49,500 --> 03:08:53,260
but then that show's got to last for two weeks because we will be off for PAX East.

3807
03:08:53,260 --> 03:08:56,860
But again, if you are going to be in Boston, A, protect me from the snow.

3808
03:08:57,420 --> 03:09:00,140
B, please introduce yourself and come say hello.

3809
03:09:00,140 --> 03:09:01,740
I can't wait to meet people over at PAX East.

3810
03:09:02,300 --> 03:09:04,220
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

3811
03:09:04,300 --> 03:09:05,580
Loki, you look ready to go.

3812
03:09:05,580 --> 03:09:07,340
What's on your mind for your final thought tonight?

3813
03:09:07,340 --> 03:09:08,380
I gotta work more on my game.

3814
03:09:09,260 --> 03:09:10,220
I can't wait to play it.

3815
03:09:10,220 --> 03:09:11,740
And apparently someone doesn't like my music.

3816
03:09:12,300 --> 03:09:13,660
Don't read the comments.

3817
03:09:13,660 --> 03:09:14,380
Don't read the comments.

3818
03:09:15,420 --> 03:09:16,620
What'd you post to YouTube about it?

3819
03:09:16,620 --> 03:09:23,100
Oh, I've posted several YouTubes about the game, but the music is trash.

3820
03:09:23,100 --> 03:09:25,820
I'm like, it's kind of that way.

3821
03:09:25,820 --> 03:09:26,540
Don't read comments.

3822
03:09:26,540 --> 03:09:27,500
Well, no, no, no, no, no.

3823
03:09:27,500 --> 03:09:29,660
The thing is, it's on purpose.

3824
03:09:29,660 --> 03:09:30,300
It's on purpose.

3825
03:09:30,300 --> 03:09:32,700
Like a lot of the whole point of that song is supposed to be kind of-

3826
03:09:32,700 --> 03:09:33,820
The artist's vision.

3827
03:09:33,900 --> 03:09:37,580
It's supposed to be kind of annoying because it's all the things that are wrong with games.

3828
03:09:37,580 --> 03:09:39,500
But at the same time, I really do like that song.

3829
03:09:40,620 --> 03:09:41,500
And it's free.

3830
03:09:41,500 --> 03:09:45,020
That's really the main reason why it's in the game because it's free.

3831
03:09:46,300 --> 03:09:49,900
My final thought tonight is I want to thank Steve for being here tonight.

3832
03:09:49,900 --> 03:09:51,740
And even though he had to leave early, I understand.

3833
03:09:52,380 --> 03:09:56,380
And I want to just thank all you guys again for listening and being a part of the show.

3834
03:09:56,380 --> 03:09:57,500
You guys make my Sunday nights.

3835
03:09:57,500 --> 03:10:02,780
And I was talking to somebody again over the weekend about giving up your Sunday nights

3836
03:10:02,780 --> 03:10:03,900
every single week.

3837
03:10:03,900 --> 03:10:07,100
And I don't know if I really see it as giving it up.

3838
03:10:07,100 --> 03:10:10,380
It's just, this is how we all get to hang once a week.

3839
03:10:12,380 --> 03:10:12,940
We get up.

3840
03:10:14,140 --> 03:10:15,260
We get up to get down.

3841
03:10:15,980 --> 03:10:16,780
That's my final thought.

3842
03:10:16,780 --> 03:10:18,220
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight.

3843
03:10:18,220 --> 03:10:20,140
I'm going to have pie and none of you can stop me.

3844
03:10:20,780 --> 03:10:21,500
I want pie.

3845
03:10:22,300 --> 03:10:23,260
No, you have to go get Alan.

3846
03:10:23,260 --> 03:10:24,780
You do have to go get Alan.

3847
03:10:24,780 --> 03:10:25,260
Maybe I can convince-

3848
03:10:25,260 --> 03:10:26,780
So I said I brought you taquitos.

3849
03:10:26,780 --> 03:10:27,820
You did bring me taquitos.

3850
03:10:27,820 --> 03:10:29,500
Maybe I can convince Alan to go get pie.

3851
03:10:30,140 --> 03:10:31,340
I offered lucky food.

3852
03:10:31,660 --> 03:10:34,540
Well, I had just eaten like a bunch of pizzas.

3853
03:10:35,740 --> 03:10:38,220
And then later I got hungry, so I had Chinese.

3854
03:10:38,220 --> 03:10:39,900
Akuma JP wants to see your work, Loki.

3855
03:10:39,900 --> 03:10:41,420
You got to put that in her chat room.

3856
03:10:41,420 --> 03:10:45,420
Well, just if you go to YouTube, Loki OLR is my username on there.

3857
03:10:45,420 --> 03:10:47,020
Or you just go look at my Twitter.

3858
03:10:47,020 --> 03:10:47,900
I post videos on it.

3859
03:10:47,900 --> 03:10:49,020
I don't have like a-

3860
03:10:49,020 --> 03:10:49,820
I was gonna-

3861
03:10:49,820 --> 03:10:56,460
I had a video that I was set to upload Saturday, but it just didn't happen because it's too

3862
03:10:56,460 --> 03:10:58,300
high quality apparently for YouTube.

3863
03:10:58,300 --> 03:10:59,500
It couldn't encode it.

3864
03:10:59,500 --> 03:11:03,900
So I'm gonna record it this time as an MP4 instead of an uncompressed-

3865
03:11:03,900 --> 03:11:09,020
This is me sitting here who's been owed those great, great creators their proper

3866
03:11:09,020 --> 03:11:10,700
playthrough videos for like a month now.

3867
03:11:10,700 --> 03:11:11,180
So I can't-

3868
03:11:11,180 --> 03:11:16,220
And I even tried using the software to convert it to a format that YouTube could use, but

3869
03:11:16,220 --> 03:11:18,380
the framerate just wasn't good enough for me.

3870
03:11:18,380 --> 03:11:19,900
So I'm gonna do it again.

3871
03:11:20,620 --> 03:11:23,260
It's fine because I gotta add some stuff to the game anyways.

3872
03:11:23,260 --> 03:11:24,060
It continues.

3873
03:11:24,060 --> 03:11:26,380
Anyway, we're out of here for the night.

3874
03:11:26,380 --> 03:11:27,260
We got to get pie.

3875
03:11:28,220 --> 03:11:29,580
Man, I want pie.

3876
03:11:30,780 --> 03:11:32,460
That's the thought I'm leaving you with tonight.

3877
03:11:32,460 --> 03:11:32,960
Pie.

3878
03:11:33,580 --> 03:11:34,460
It's delicious.

3879
03:11:34,460 --> 03:11:35,100
Good night everybody.

3880
03:11:35,100 --> 03:11:36,380
We'll see you in seven days.

3881
03:11:37,260 --> 03:11:39,980
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
