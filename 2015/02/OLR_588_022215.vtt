Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight, we interview the developer of Flom, an art game that pits old against new, modern against tradition, and an adventure through art history.

00:19.000 --> 00:27.000
Join us for the exploration as well as the headlines from This Week in Gaming, along with your questions, comments, feedback, and more, right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:47.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this February the 22nd, 2015, the 588th episode of our show.

00:47.000 --> 00:58.000
My name is Rob Roberts, but you can find me on Twitter at Skie, here with you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-host.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
I actually looked at my Twitter once.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Did you?

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Once.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
Yeah, you ended up floating more over to Tumblr than Twitter.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
There's a lot of social media out there. There's a lot.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
The Tumblars are great.

01:12.000 --> 01:21.000
Alan finally had to sit down and teach me how to use Snapchat, because I did not understand the interface at all, and I still think the interface is really terrible.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Isn't that the thing to swap-

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
Oh, hi, TechMasterLoki, how are you?

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
Sorry, isn't that the thing to swap nudes or something back and forth? Is that what that-

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
I think they- well, here's the thing-

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
No, that's where people send you dick pictures, and then you get to comment on them.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.000
Here's the thing about Snapchat is I kind of think that's the CD underbelly, you know, the internet is for porn type of thing.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
I mean, you can use email to send those types of pictures if you want, right?

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Yeah, if you were in like 1996 or something like that.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
But I think that might have been how their business started.

01:45.000 --> 01:50.000
Hey, back in the day it used to be really expensive to send pictures of your junk out to people.

01:50.000 --> 01:57.000
But I think a lot of younger people use Snapchat. Not for that reason, because I'll be very, very, very wrong, although sadly there probably are a few.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
They should be ashamed.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Children don't do anything wrong.

02:00.000 --> 02:09.000
I know, but here's the thing. I think a lot of like, especially at college and so forth, use it as like a blogging thing, because now they built this whole- I didn't even realize this existed until Alan explained it to me.

02:09.000 --> 02:18.000
There's a whole like, you can build a story. And so the snap videos that you take over a 24 hour period or whatever can all go into like a story.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.000
Is that where you put like googly eyes on the penises and then like make little caption bubbles and stuff like that?

02:23.000 --> 02:28.000
I did see the thing going around on Tumblr where someone snapchatted like different people and then they started drawing over them.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Yeah, that you can do that too.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
That might be a reason to get that, but no.

02:34.000 --> 02:42.000
It is very silly, but I only bring that up because that's huge. Apparently that is huge. That app is worth millions and millions of dollars.

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
And I didn't understand it until a couple days ago, even though I tried to download it because some friends of mine were like, look me up on Snapchat.

02:49.000 --> 02:57.000
And I couldn't figure it out until Alan was like, okay, you're going to tap this button and it's going to do that.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
And then you're going to swipe right and it's going to do that.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
You know your old win.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
When you have to have someone to show you how to use an app.

03:05.000 --> 03:14.000
Right? It threw me back to the days when I used to have to like explain to my dad how to call the BBS's that I was calling to download porn.

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
I mean, play door games. Play door games. Very important.

03:18.000 --> 03:24.000
All right. Anyhow, we're here with you guys every Sunday night live at the Voice of Geeks Network.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
Which tapes Sunday nights at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

03:30.000 --> 03:35.000
Which I'll tell you a little more about his show a little later in the show because he had a really neat interview tonight.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
I'll tell you more about that later.

03:36.000 --> 03:43.000
But yeah, you can tune in live. And if you are live, you should join our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
And we do read comments from chat throughout the show.

03:45.000 --> 03:53.000
And you can participate in the program, ask questions, have comments out there that we can throw out there on the discussions we're having.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
On a lot of various game topics.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.000
Tonight though, we're going to welcome to the show a friend of Dark Sakura's.

04:02.000 --> 04:08.000
Dark Sakura, perhaps you should do this introduction because you've been hyping this game on the show for the past few weeks.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
And I always do this. So Dark Sakura, why don't you introduce our guest tonight?

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
Hi. Okay. My voice just decided to fart on me.

04:17.000 --> 04:24.000
I would like to introduce a very, very cool guy who was first met as my teacher. I did some intern work.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
I like how you're pointing to me on the radio.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Because.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Because you're here live in the studio.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
No one can see that.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
This is Steve.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
I'm going to take a picture of your hand.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Just say hi.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Hello.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Hello.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Wait, are you taking pictures over there?

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
I'm taking pictures of her hand.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.000
Is that in Snapchat?

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Yeah, it's going to go on Instagram.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
On Instagram?

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
On Instagram, yeah. We're a little bit old.

04:44.000 --> 04:49.000
No, there's nothing. Wait, Instagram is old? I think I missed that memo.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Little old. Next big thing coming up next.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
All right. Well, welcome to Orange Lawn Tradios, Steve.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Oh, that came out like shit.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.000
Didn't he ask you, Dark Sakura, what should I expect on Orange Lawn Tradios? You say, well, we like to swear a lot.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
We say fuck a lot.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Okay.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
That was, I think, what I said.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
All right.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Well, saying and doing. Go ahead.

05:10.000 --> 05:16.000
Speaking of apps, I want to give you ample opportunity to talk about why you're here and what this might have to do with gaming and so forth.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
And he's here because I lured him with food.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Well, there's that.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
You lured me with food?

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Just get down here.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
But we want to talk about the app that Steve has had a huge...

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Oh, I'm sick of talking about the app.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
Oh, wait. I'm just talking about it now.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
It's been a while.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Well, we don't have to talk about it.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
It's been a while.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
But then nobody knows about it.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Oh, that's the hard part.

05:34.000 --> 05:41.000
Steve, you're the creator of a game that's available on iTunes and it's for the iPad and iPhone.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
Not Android yet, right?

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
This is not available on Android yet?

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
Not on Android.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
That's what I hear the most.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Yeah.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
And it's from our point of view, although everyone's argued with me about it.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Oh, that's a good filter.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
That is a really good filter.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Okay.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
We're putting that on Instagram.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
It still looks bad.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
But the game is called Flom.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
It's called Flom.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Which is...

06:03.000 --> 06:08.000
That's an interesting name because when first, I think Dark Sakura and one of her, I'm going

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
to say a random tangent moments at like the beginning of the show.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
I was like, what's up, Dark Sakura?

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
And she goes, Flom!

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
And I'm like, you made me flan?

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
What?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
This is a great name.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
What?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
That's a funny word.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Flom.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
What is that?

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
What does that title mean?

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Nothing.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
I love it.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Yes.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
You're an honest man, Steve.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
I love it.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
It was a nonsense word.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
I kept putting on Twitter because I wasn't sure what to do with Twitter when it first

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
came out.

06:36.000 --> 06:43.000
And I had a friend that I drove crazy by just typing the word flam every few days.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Didn't it end up in one of your syllabuses once?

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
I threw it in there too.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Yeah.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Because I was teaching and that's a playground.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Really.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
So I just kept driving a friend crazy.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
The whole concept for this game started and then eventually I didn't know what to name

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
it.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
And I was like, what the hell?

07:01.000 --> 07:07.000
And since it is based on modern art, Dadaism, supposedly the legend was they just sort of

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
picked it at random from a dictionary.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
So, what the hell?

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Here's this word.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
You can name it anything you wanted.

07:13.000 --> 07:18.000
Tell us a little bit about your background because Dark Sakura met you when you were

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
an instructor in one of her design classes, right?

07:21.000 --> 07:25.000
So your background isn't necessarily, you know, we talked to a lot of game designers

07:25.000 --> 07:31.200
in game development, but we also really support here at OLR people like you and me and Loki

07:31.200 --> 07:34.000
and Dark Sakura that want to create their own games, right?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
Yeah.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
So tell us a little bit about your background.

07:36.000 --> 07:42.000
Not necessarily as a game designer, but your background is in book design and print design,

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
right?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
It's everything else.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.400
Well, my background in game design was I played them when I was a kid.

07:48.400 --> 07:54.320
And I didn't realize what a different world it was until I watched Tron again, the original

07:54.320 --> 07:57.020
one, and saw the arcade.

07:57.020 --> 07:58.860
And I remember the arcades were so crowded.

07:58.860 --> 08:05.200
We used to try to somehow get to the San Francisco airport in order to play the video games there

08:05.200 --> 08:06.800
because there was no one playing them.

08:06.800 --> 08:10.320
And you didn't have to have a ticket to get past screening back in the day.

08:10.320 --> 08:11.320
No, you didn't.

08:11.320 --> 08:14.840
You could just go hang out and watch the planes and they'd eventually throw you out because

08:14.840 --> 08:17.200
you were a kid.

08:17.200 --> 08:23.760
But you could actually, eventually when we got cars in high school, we'd drive out there

08:23.760 --> 08:26.920
and basically pay for our parking by returning old baggage carts.

08:26.920 --> 08:27.920
Oh, that's amazing.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.880
It was a quarter each one.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.960
What kind of games in the 80s do you remember?

08:31.960 --> 08:32.960
What kind of games do you remember playing?

08:32.960 --> 08:34.480
I remember blowing up shit.

08:34.480 --> 08:38.920
And that's what I, you know, I grew up in the 70s.

08:38.920 --> 08:41.560
We had car chases.

08:41.560 --> 08:42.840
Bullet is one of my favorite films.

08:42.840 --> 08:44.560
I used to watch it with my dad.

08:44.560 --> 08:45.840
He's San Francisco mainstay.

08:45.840 --> 08:46.840
Yeah.

08:46.840 --> 08:50.400
You want to see San Francisco before the traffic, go watch Bullet.

08:50.400 --> 08:57.440
And there was, what was it, The Driver, which was, someone look up the film, The Driver.

08:57.440 --> 09:00.720
It's a great little film that no one knows about.

09:00.720 --> 09:04.160
So I was fascinated with car chases, watching things blow up.

09:04.160 --> 09:08.280
Eventually we had Knight Rider, we had Dukes of Hazzard.

09:08.280 --> 09:11.000
And in the video games, you start seeing these metaphors.

09:11.000 --> 09:17.600
I mean, Pong was originally tennis and then it started becoming alien invaders, space

09:17.600 --> 09:18.760
battles and stuff.

09:18.760 --> 09:20.520
And I was fascinated with the early stuff.

09:20.520 --> 09:21.520
Pole position for racer.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.480
I remember that was like an early, early racing.

09:23.480 --> 09:24.480
It was pole position.

09:24.480 --> 09:28.420
And then I don't know if you were still checking out arcades, maybe when things shifted a little

09:28.420 --> 09:32.080
bit to like roadblasters, I remember was our early favorite.

09:32.080 --> 09:33.680
They were closing eventually.

09:33.680 --> 09:34.680
Yeah.

09:34.680 --> 09:37.400
I remember they were in the malls and then things started closing.

09:37.400 --> 09:43.060
I remember there was a jump to 50 cents a game and you would have to stand in line to

09:43.060 --> 09:44.160
play each game.

09:44.160 --> 09:48.420
You'd have to stack up quarters just to take over a game from someone.

09:48.420 --> 09:51.300
So how did this all come together?

09:51.300 --> 09:55.620
Because you mentioned that you've been wanting to do this game Flom for, I was reading in

09:55.620 --> 09:59.460
some of the press and the website and so forth, that you've been wanting to put this game

09:59.460 --> 10:00.900
together basically for five years.

10:00.900 --> 10:01.900
It's been a process.

10:01.900 --> 10:02.900
It's been a while.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.920
High school plus one, if you think about it.

10:04.920 --> 10:10.100
How did that come together where you say, okay, I remember these arcades and these games

10:10.100 --> 10:13.820
I used to play because I love to blow shit up and we'd sneak into the airport where we're

10:13.820 --> 10:16.400
not supposed to be there to play these old games.

10:16.400 --> 10:19.060
And I have my love of design.

10:19.060 --> 10:22.620
How did those two worlds collide, the design world and the game world?

10:22.620 --> 10:24.740
Always looking for different things.

10:24.740 --> 10:31.600
And I know the great John Kureka over at Rocketeer Games and he just sort of threw a little idea

10:31.600 --> 10:36.600
at me regarding a game that he had sitting there that he wasn't doing much with.

10:36.600 --> 10:39.240
And I just sort of went out and started designing stuff.

10:39.240 --> 10:43.240
And I remember I even came up to him after six months and said, here's some of my ideas.

10:43.240 --> 10:44.640
And he's like, what are you doing?

10:44.880 --> 10:51.840
I had no idea that I was actually playing with something, but I wanted to do a little

10:51.840 --> 10:53.800
shooter just like the ones I remember.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.920
And I remember them being a lot different than what I see out there.

10:56.920 --> 10:59.800
I've tried playing a new version of Asteroids.

10:59.800 --> 11:05.640
It's just not the same without the black and white screen and the glowing stuff.

11:05.640 --> 11:12.840
So that's interesting you bring that up because I noticed that the graphics in Flom kind of

11:12.840 --> 11:17.040
take a, I don't want to say a simplistic approach because we're not talking about black

11:17.040 --> 11:21.640
and white, but we're definitely talking about like, really, I mean, I'm just struck by like,

11:21.640 --> 11:25.380
it's like moving art pieces kind of all coming together.

11:25.380 --> 11:27.220
Where did that come from, the idea to do that?

11:27.220 --> 11:28.220
It was a play.

11:28.220 --> 11:34.320
One of the things I noticed, and this is where I first met Dark Sakura, I'm still working

11:34.320 --> 11:35.320
on that because I know you as Jamie.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.320
You can just call me Jamie.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.320
Yeah.

11:37.320 --> 11:42.040
And she was taking my history class, which is an hour and 20 minutes of stand up twice

11:42.040 --> 11:43.760
a week.

11:43.760 --> 11:49.700
And I was noticing as I got into the modern art movements, which I really enjoyed, that

11:49.700 --> 11:52.440
there was some stuff going on in there that is tappable.

11:52.440 --> 11:57.640
And one of the big connections was the De Stijl movement out of Holland, which most

11:57.640 --> 11:58.640
people don't know about.

11:58.640 --> 12:01.320
I even polled students to this day, what do you know about Holland?

12:01.320 --> 12:05.960
And pretty much all they know today is wooden shoes, windmills, and Dutch Bros coffee.

12:05.960 --> 12:06.960
And weed is legal.

12:06.960 --> 12:07.960
Yes.

12:07.960 --> 12:08.960
Weed is legal.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.560
I know nobody wants to say that out loud.

12:10.560 --> 12:11.560
Hookers and pot.

12:11.560 --> 12:12.560
Hookers and pot.

12:12.560 --> 12:13.560
Really?

12:13.560 --> 12:14.560
Let's...

12:14.560 --> 12:15.560
And now Colorado is our Holland.

12:15.560 --> 12:16.560
Oh, that's right.

12:16.560 --> 12:17.560
They don't have to go to Holland anymore.

12:17.560 --> 12:18.560
Yeah.

12:18.560 --> 12:19.560
Can you get hookers in Colorado?

12:19.560 --> 12:20.560
Maybe.

12:20.560 --> 12:21.560
Maybe in 2016.

12:21.560 --> 12:22.560
Rob, you can get hookers anywhere.

12:22.560 --> 12:23.560
Yeah.

12:23.560 --> 12:24.560
Anyway.

12:24.560 --> 12:25.800
I could go walk down the street and get a hooker.

12:25.800 --> 12:26.800
Hold on.

12:26.800 --> 12:28.320
We're trying to talk about a classy game here.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.080
Don't be mucking it up with hookers and pot.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.080
All right.

12:31.080 --> 12:35.080
Wait, what neighborhood is this?

12:35.080 --> 12:39.880
So I saw the connections, which they were doing things with lines, orthogonals, a lot

12:39.880 --> 12:41.920
of things that looked like pixel art.

12:41.920 --> 12:44.520
It reminded me a lot of Pong.

12:44.520 --> 12:46.880
And it reminded me of how the early games were all low resolution.

12:46.880 --> 12:49.160
There were all these 8-bit things.

12:49.160 --> 12:53.000
And they were doing it with drafting paper and other tools.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.680
So I started researching.

12:54.680 --> 12:59.440
There was a movement tied to it, and that's what gave me the idea for a flom movement,

12:59.440 --> 13:03.220
which is more Spinal Tap than anything else, which is I've created a fake art movement.

13:03.220 --> 13:04.220
We have a manifesto.

13:04.220 --> 13:06.000
We have all the stuff at the website.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.980
And we'll see who bites onto that.

13:08.980 --> 13:15.060
And then I started talking to other people about it and getting them interested in it.

13:15.060 --> 13:19.900
And as I move forward, there's a big problem with Holland in that they're not big into

13:19.900 --> 13:21.060
blowing things up.

13:21.060 --> 13:23.760
You have to kind of go into other art movements.

13:23.760 --> 13:26.780
And I made my way to Italy, which was the Futurists.

13:26.780 --> 13:30.740
And the Futurists were all about violence and blowing things up.

13:30.740 --> 13:36.700
So much, their best artists were lost in World War I.

13:36.700 --> 13:38.440
Interesting.

13:38.440 --> 13:40.400
So yeah.

13:40.400 --> 13:43.080
And then it was research, research, research.

13:43.080 --> 13:44.260
After that, lots of reading.

13:44.260 --> 13:46.120
We have a bibliography at the website.

13:46.120 --> 13:49.280
Oh, and where is the website for people who want to check it out?

13:49.280 --> 13:50.280
It's flom.us.

13:50.280 --> 13:51.280
F-L-O-M-M.us.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.280
Flom.us.

13:52.280 --> 13:56.600
And you can see much more about the game.

13:56.600 --> 14:00.320
The game is available for $2.99 on iTunes.

14:00.320 --> 14:02.040
Low price, just so you can play with it.

14:02.040 --> 14:03.040
There it is.

14:03.040 --> 14:05.660
And hopefully you sell enough of it so you can get the Android fans a piece of that too

14:05.660 --> 14:06.660
at some point.

14:06.660 --> 14:07.660
That would be next.

14:07.700 --> 14:08.700
And other stuff.

14:08.700 --> 14:13.700
And even at this point, it's been in development so long, I have ideas for other versions.

14:13.700 --> 14:14.700
Flom 2.

14:14.700 --> 14:17.700
Yeah, we don't have a lot of unlocking stuff in there.

14:17.700 --> 14:22.060
But the idea was we just build it in a way that we could build alternate versions of

14:22.060 --> 14:23.260
it with different looks.

14:23.260 --> 14:28.780
Well, I noticed though, that there was still like some like you had different like vehicles,

14:28.780 --> 14:32.820
like essentially, like, you know, if you're going to say straight up shooter, basically,

14:32.820 --> 14:35.820
there's many different types of spaceships, but I feel weird calling it that because it's

14:35.820 --> 14:37.900
not really what it what it is.

14:37.900 --> 14:41.940
You have all these different types of like, modern art pieces that you can control in

14:41.940 --> 14:44.940
the game, but some of them unlock right in the game.

14:44.940 --> 14:47.140
It's that was just to keep you going.

14:47.140 --> 14:49.020
And you can beat the game.

14:49.020 --> 14:53.260
You just have you have to transform the villain into something modern.

14:53.260 --> 14:56.780
And you do that by collecting power ups and just shooting him.

14:56.780 --> 15:00.780
One of the concepts with just the overall look is what would it be like flying through

15:00.780 --> 15:03.940
a Hannah Hawk collage?

15:03.940 --> 15:07.380
And H O C H is the spelling of you want to look up her work.

15:07.380 --> 15:08.380
And I do it with students.

15:08.380 --> 15:10.020
She's one of my heroes too.

15:10.020 --> 15:11.020
Yeah.

15:11.020 --> 15:12.860
You look at that stuff and go, what if this stuff animated?

15:12.860 --> 15:15.020
What if you were flying through stuff like this?

15:15.020 --> 15:18.260
And then I started going farther and going, what if you're flying through a Kandinsky

15:18.260 --> 15:19.260
painting?

15:19.260 --> 15:22.740
What if you're flying through Cubism?

15:22.740 --> 15:26.660
And it just, it became just a series of backgrounds.

15:26.660 --> 15:32.780
I spent probably the first two years just making backgrounds and doing sketches.

15:32.780 --> 15:36.020
And yeah, I noticed there's a lot of like little details in some of the art that's in

15:36.020 --> 15:37.020
the game.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.020
Like I, this instantly caught my eye.

15:38.020 --> 15:42.220
I said the little bullets that my car, I think I picked a car to control the little bullets

15:42.220 --> 15:44.940
that my car was shooting would say tat, tat, tat, tat, tat.

15:44.940 --> 15:47.060
Like it, like it wasn't like I was throwing bullets.

15:47.060 --> 15:48.060
I was throwing words.

15:48.060 --> 15:50.180
I thought that was kind of neat.

15:50.180 --> 15:56.820
Strangely enough, that happened later on because, because we took our time with this.

15:56.820 --> 16:00.220
I was just sitting there one day and I was showing this to another graphic designer and

16:00.220 --> 16:05.800
the bullets were more like a painting, little paints, paint blurs and stuff.

16:05.800 --> 16:11.200
And I realized one of the big things on the list was Marinetti sound poetry.

16:11.200 --> 16:17.380
Go back, look 1914, 1916, he was taking words and liberating them.

16:17.380 --> 16:22.640
The Italian thing would be parole in liberta, liberated type.

16:22.640 --> 16:26.460
And so this is actually a manifestation of what was sound poetry.

16:26.460 --> 16:29.100
He was doing poetry based on noises.

16:29.100 --> 16:31.060
And I was like, why not put the type in there?

16:31.060 --> 16:34.860
And the, the font I had to use, I had to redraw it so you could actually read it while you're

16:34.860 --> 16:35.860
playing the game.

16:35.860 --> 16:36.860
That's awesome.

16:36.860 --> 16:41.460
Um, I want to, uh, check in with our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com and if any

16:41.460 --> 16:44.340
of you happen to have questions for Steve, uh, you can go ahead and put that out in the

16:44.340 --> 16:45.340
chat room.

16:45.340 --> 16:48.480
Although I think we all realize you guys may not have all tried the game yet because many

16:48.480 --> 16:52.580
of you are probably just now really getting to hear what it's all about besides dark soccer.

16:52.580 --> 16:53.580
Just saying, play it!

16:53.580 --> 16:57.260
Uh, here on the show, uh, isn't my word not good enough?

16:57.780 --> 16:59.420
Hey guys, you're hearing a little more about it.

16:59.420 --> 17:02.060
We gotta do something else cause when you tell people to play things, they don't want

17:02.060 --> 17:03.060
to play them.

17:03.060 --> 17:05.260
So avoid it like the plague.

17:05.260 --> 17:06.260
It will make you sick.

17:06.260 --> 17:09.820
And I would love to show a video or something, but unfortunately it is Orange Lounge Radio

17:09.820 --> 17:11.060
so I can't really show.

17:11.060 --> 17:14.320
So I just have to urge people to go check out the website when they can, uh, to see

17:14.320 --> 17:15.320
a little more about it.

17:15.320 --> 17:18.260
I have put a few photos up though on my Facebook page.

17:18.260 --> 17:19.260
There you go.

17:19.260 --> 17:20.260
For screen captures.

17:20.260 --> 17:22.420
So everybody friend Jamie on Facebook immediately.

17:22.420 --> 17:23.420
Do it now.

17:23.580 --> 17:29.900
Well, my, my fan page, but I also put a few up on, um, my Steam profile because I've uploaded

17:29.900 --> 17:30.900
screenshots.

17:30.900 --> 17:31.900
Nice.

17:31.900 --> 17:34.620
We tried to do a trailer that actually looked like the game.

17:34.620 --> 17:36.420
I thought we came close.

17:36.420 --> 17:37.420
Okay.

17:37.420 --> 17:39.060
I kept, I kept seeing trailers that didn't work.

17:39.060 --> 17:43.780
In fact, uh, as, as we were building the trailer, the game was looking better than the trailer.

17:43.780 --> 17:46.220
So, uh, we kept rethinking everything.

17:46.220 --> 17:49.860
Well, let me ask this real quick and I don't, I don't wanna, I do want to get to some of

17:49.860 --> 17:53.300
the other video games y'all been playing this week and some of what's going on in the industry

17:53.300 --> 17:57.780
and we do talk a lot of big games this week, for example, you know, big AAA titles, we'll

17:57.780 --> 17:59.900
get into talk about the order a little later in the show.

17:59.900 --> 18:03.860
I'm sure people are dying to know what we thought about our, uh, you know, what's going

18:03.860 --> 18:06.520
on with all the hubble around that game right now.

18:06.520 --> 18:10.260
But here at OLR, you know, we like to support not just the big, big stuff everybody's heard

18:10.260 --> 18:14.060
about, but you know, we've been really big and it's kind of been a theme for us almost

18:14.060 --> 18:20.260
so far in 2015 about the fact that, you know, anybody can create things and you know, if

18:20.260 --> 18:23.500
you want to do a game, go out and make a game.

18:23.500 --> 18:26.340
You know, we were talking about that with the vog jam and when we had the cooking with

18:26.340 --> 18:28.700
unity guys on last month and so forth.

18:28.700 --> 18:33.820
And so, you know, now we have you here talking about this game that's on iTunes where you

18:33.820 --> 18:38.900
had an idea and you went forth and now you are a game maker.

18:38.900 --> 18:42.500
Tell us a little more about that process because I know you didn't do it alone.

18:42.500 --> 18:45.260
How did you collaborate with others?

18:45.260 --> 18:49.320
How did you come together for this common vision of flom?

18:49.320 --> 18:53.960
It was talking to a lot of people and I don't just see it as a game.

18:53.960 --> 19:00.500
Part of my philosophy is figure out what you want to do and find some way to make it happen.

19:00.500 --> 19:04.720
And I've been bringing up ideas of, because I've had people come back to me with this,

19:04.720 --> 19:09.080
is okay, you have a game and you have sort of a fake art movement going on here.

19:09.080 --> 19:10.620
Next thing would be shows.

19:10.620 --> 19:13.920
Next thing would be bringing other artists into the fold.

19:13.920 --> 19:17.040
And I've been talking to a bunch of people and trying to figure out what we could do

19:17.040 --> 19:19.280
because the things do cost money.

19:19.280 --> 19:21.580
But it's enjoy what you're doing.

19:21.580 --> 19:24.240
That's what it's really about.

19:24.240 --> 19:27.760
Now my background, which you started talking about, I've been a graphic designer for a

19:27.760 --> 19:28.960
long time.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.600
I've worked for corporations.

19:30.600 --> 19:35.560
I've worked for, you name it, accountants, lawyers.

19:35.560 --> 19:39.280
I've worked for everything you could possibly think of, bands.

19:39.280 --> 19:45.140
In fact, I started stocking a band and that's how I got my musician.

19:45.140 --> 19:49.820
I was listening to a lot of garbage and I got to know this wonderful band called The

19:49.820 --> 19:50.820
Start.

19:50.820 --> 19:55.420
They were playing nearby and I became friends with their drummer and she did the music for

19:55.420 --> 19:56.700
the game.

19:56.700 --> 19:59.700
And that was one of the plans even before I was doing a game that we should work on

19:59.700 --> 20:00.700
something together.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.700
Interesting.

20:01.700 --> 20:05.860
So it's kind of like you, over the years in the interactions you've had with people, you

20:05.860 --> 20:08.980
kind of, it sounds like you've kind of been keeping like a Rolodex a little bit in your

20:08.980 --> 20:09.980
mind.

20:09.980 --> 20:11.040
Like, I want to work with her on the music.

20:11.040 --> 20:14.020
I want to work with him on the programming.

20:14.020 --> 20:18.220
You've basically been assembling the Avengers for the past few years.

20:18.220 --> 20:19.220
That's what it is.

20:19.220 --> 20:20.220
You're Nick Fury.

20:20.220 --> 20:21.220
Gnome who finished the game.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.220
Nick Flommy.

20:22.220 --> 20:23.220
You're Nick Flommy.

20:23.220 --> 20:24.220
Yeah.

20:24.220 --> 20:28.300
I have both eyes though, for now.

20:28.300 --> 20:33.220
Gnome, who was the final programmer, is a superhero.

20:33.220 --> 20:35.860
He brought a smoothness to the animation.

20:35.860 --> 20:40.860
He brought some stuff in there that's so subtle that what's great was just telling him what

20:40.860 --> 20:42.860
my vision was for everything.

20:42.860 --> 20:47.160
And even when I say smoothness, the vision was to make it look like old animated stuff

20:47.160 --> 20:53.020
from the 20s without getting so hokey that you just have a lot of dust and dirt on everything.

20:53.020 --> 20:58.340
So those little details, he really understood and it did take us a while to get it together.

20:58.340 --> 20:59.340
Just pulling it together.

20:59.340 --> 21:01.500
But our projects will go on forever.

21:01.500 --> 21:02.500
We know that.

21:02.500 --> 21:08.100
YYR is in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com saying collaborations like that are so great.

21:08.100 --> 21:13.200
And I know YYR is very similar to what you did where he's kind of like a single person

21:13.200 --> 21:19.160
developing his own games, but I know he had a friend that did a lot of music that's helped

21:19.160 --> 21:23.780
him out with some of the music stuff in like Snake 360 and some of the games that he did.

21:23.780 --> 21:31.420
So that's great to hear just people that enjoy games who have all these different skills

21:31.420 --> 21:33.420
coming together to assemble their own Avengers teams.

21:33.420 --> 21:35.480
I think that's so neat.

21:35.480 --> 21:38.360
I do want to move forward with some of the other stuff we have on deck for tonight's

21:38.360 --> 21:39.360
show.

21:39.360 --> 21:45.840
But Steve, one kind of last chance to pitch to our listeners, why should they go check

21:45.840 --> 21:48.280
out Flom in the iTunes store right away?

21:48.280 --> 21:50.460
Well, it goes a little bit farther.

21:50.460 --> 21:55.340
It did grow out of education, which is, it's that little thing that no one wants to talk

21:55.340 --> 21:56.340
about.

21:56.340 --> 22:02.160
But one of my plans with the game was to bring an educational element to it.

22:02.160 --> 22:06.120
Another thing I remember as a kid was we'd watch TV shows and we'd learn something from

22:06.120 --> 22:08.800
them and they were a bit more heavy-handed about it.

22:08.800 --> 22:14.300
So my approach to the game was everything in there relates to something that has existed

22:14.300 --> 22:16.560
in art history.

22:16.560 --> 22:22.080
And it became actually part of, I didn't finish it, but I was getting a master's in education.

22:22.080 --> 22:26.000
And the game is based on using alter media to get people to learn stuff.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.300
So if you're playing the game and you don't know what's in the background and you go looking

22:29.300 --> 22:31.780
for it, chances are you're going to find something.

22:31.780 --> 22:38.780
So if you're a gamer and an art history nerd, there definitely is something here for you.

22:38.780 --> 22:41.580
This might help studying a lot better than just memorization.

22:41.580 --> 22:43.460
And you know what?

22:43.460 --> 22:45.720
Edutainment games are so important.

22:45.720 --> 22:47.540
And we were just talking about this last week.

22:47.540 --> 22:48.540
It had come up on the show.

22:48.540 --> 22:52.540
We were reminiscing down the line about games that were educational.

22:52.540 --> 22:55.640
And some of the games I remember in my youth, and I think a lot of people think about things

22:55.640 --> 23:00.820
like Carmen Sandiego, Number Munchers, there were a lot of big, big ones.

23:00.860 --> 23:01.860
Oregon Trail.

23:01.860 --> 23:03.620
Of course, that's the one I think everybody knows, that one, the Oregon Trail.

23:03.620 --> 23:05.020
I did some work for them too.

23:05.020 --> 23:08.020
I had Oregon Trail all over my computer at one point.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.880
That may have seeded this thinking.

23:09.880 --> 23:10.880
Get out.

23:10.880 --> 23:11.880
What did you do for Oregon Trail?

23:11.880 --> 23:14.740
I did a whole bunch of marketing sell sheets for them.

23:14.740 --> 23:20.120
And then I did like one of the, it was like a redrawing of a redrawing of Carmen Sandiego.

23:20.120 --> 23:22.180
So purple and red everywhere.

23:22.180 --> 23:27.140
You invited a guy that worked on Oregon Trail to this show and neglected to tell me?

23:27.140 --> 23:28.140
Oops.

23:28.460 --> 23:31.460
I worked on so many projects, I didn't even remember.

23:31.460 --> 23:32.460
Oops.

23:32.460 --> 23:33.460
Well.

23:33.460 --> 23:36.260
Like I was paying attention in class.

23:36.260 --> 23:37.260
I mean, oh, hi Steve.

23:37.260 --> 23:39.020
No, I never came up, did it?

23:39.020 --> 23:41.180
Now I'm in the presence of royalty.

23:41.180 --> 23:42.180
I mean, but think about it.

23:42.180 --> 23:43.180
Those games.

23:43.180 --> 23:44.180
I wasn't on the main team.

23:44.180 --> 23:46.780
This was more of a marketing side of things.

23:46.780 --> 23:48.820
It's like you talk to the guy that did it though.

23:48.820 --> 23:51.100
It's like the degrees are lessening, right?

23:51.100 --> 23:56.580
So they had another thing called Nelly Nut that never premiered in the US.

23:56.580 --> 23:59.620
And I don't know what happened to it, but I did all these materials for it.

23:59.620 --> 24:00.620
Interesting.

24:00.620 --> 24:01.620
Someone look it up.

24:01.620 --> 24:02.620
I think I might have looked it up.

24:02.620 --> 24:03.620
Something like that.

24:03.620 --> 24:04.620
Did you do anything with Odell Lake?

24:04.620 --> 24:06.620
Because a lot of the fans are there.

24:06.620 --> 24:07.620
No.

24:07.620 --> 24:11.780
I got sick of red and purple after a while.

24:11.780 --> 24:14.700
There's a Nelly Nut TV, that was a 2003 TV show.

24:14.700 --> 24:16.860
Yeah, well it was before that.

24:16.860 --> 24:18.260
So I don't know what happened with it.

24:18.260 --> 24:25.700
Well I did check out the game myself and you know, it's such a neat like style to it.

24:26.700 --> 24:33.020
I think it's different than if I were to tell you, go download this shooter game on iOS.

24:33.020 --> 24:35.420
You're going to have this perception in your mind of what that is.

24:35.420 --> 24:40.880
But like Flom is different and it really is kind of like shooter meets this other world

24:40.880 --> 24:41.880
over there.

24:41.880 --> 24:43.140
So it's definitely worth visiting.

24:43.140 --> 24:44.380
That was the hard part.

24:44.380 --> 24:49.180
The only other thing I can pitch really quick is I've been on social media for a while.

24:49.180 --> 24:50.180
Tumblr.

24:50.180 --> 24:52.020
There are two Tumblr pages.

24:52.020 --> 24:55.200
We have a music one now that's a spillover page.

24:55.200 --> 24:58.600
But it started with the concept of modern art is the avant-garde.

24:58.600 --> 25:01.140
And what does the avant-garde mean back then?

25:01.140 --> 25:03.900
What does it meant since and what does it mean today?

25:03.900 --> 25:08.240
So right now on just Flomis.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.240
Just look for Flomis.

25:09.240 --> 25:10.240
It comes up.

25:10.240 --> 25:15.180
Flomis on Tumblr and Flomishin, which we do playlists every week.

25:15.180 --> 25:18.420
Right now we're covering London Fashion Week because there's some really cool stuff coming

25:18.420 --> 25:21.620
out of Europe right now.

25:21.620 --> 25:26.400
It's about looking at design and art, not just the old stuff, but contemporary stuff.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.940
And I hope to just keep going with this and see where it ends up.

25:28.940 --> 25:29.940
All right.

25:29.940 --> 25:30.940
Well, best of luck to you.

25:30.940 --> 25:32.740
I did link them all in the chat room earlier.

25:32.740 --> 25:33.740
Awesome.

25:33.740 --> 25:37.020
But for the podcast listeners, since you don't have the links, we will link it in the show

25:37.020 --> 25:39.380
notes of course over at vognetwork.com.

25:39.380 --> 25:41.220
But again, the website's really easy to find.

25:41.220 --> 25:45.260
It's just Flom, F-L-O-M-M dot U-S.

25:45.260 --> 25:46.260
There you go.

25:46.260 --> 25:47.260
And best of luck to you.

25:47.260 --> 25:48.940
Steve, please feel free to stay throughout the show.

25:48.940 --> 25:51.820
I know you don't play a lot of the modern games that we'll probably get into talking

25:51.820 --> 25:53.940
about, but we love our retro stuff too.

25:53.940 --> 25:57.580
Feel free to jump in with anything that you have to add, but if you have to go, I understand

25:57.580 --> 25:58.580
that as well.

25:58.580 --> 26:02.220
I always wonder why they walk off talk shows after a while, because you just sit in the

26:02.220 --> 26:03.220
back room and stare at the wall.

26:03.220 --> 26:07.620
That's when you go in the green room and eat the free food and drink the wine.

26:07.620 --> 26:08.620
Sadly, this is a-

26:08.620 --> 26:10.940
You just stuffed a chimichanga down my throat.

26:10.940 --> 26:11.940
As I mentioned-

26:11.940 --> 26:13.940
And that means something in art.

26:13.940 --> 26:18.900
As I mentioned when you first got here off air, we're very much hobbyists here at OLR.

26:18.900 --> 26:21.380
And it's, I was like, welcome to my house.

26:21.380 --> 26:24.580
Here's the spare room that happens to be a studio.

26:24.580 --> 26:25.580
All right.

26:25.580 --> 26:26.580
Anyway.

26:26.580 --> 26:29.420
YYR asked real quick, if there's time, can we ask if there'll be a demo?

26:29.420 --> 26:35.540
YYR saying that a demo or a light version is usually very convincing on selling these.

26:35.540 --> 26:37.200
Has that something you guys have given any thought to?

26:37.200 --> 26:39.100
We're going to wait a little bit.

26:39.100 --> 26:43.300
We had a temporary demo, it was a little bit clunky about a year ago.

26:43.300 --> 26:45.900
And the fun thing, actually, I guess this was a good thing.

26:45.900 --> 26:48.940
People were getting addicted to it, but we looked and said, no one's going to buy it

26:48.940 --> 26:51.320
if they get so hooked on the demo.

26:51.320 --> 26:55.580
So I do have one idea I haven't told anyone about yet, which is if we do have a demo,

26:55.580 --> 26:57.460
it will be a pared down version of the game.

26:57.460 --> 26:59.860
You won't be able to beat anything.

26:59.860 --> 27:03.100
And the main boss will not show up for the game.

27:03.100 --> 27:07.340
You're going to have his stand in, which is just sort of the middle manager in the game.

27:07.340 --> 27:10.420
He just sort of shows up and he's not going to be much of a challenge and you get to blow

27:10.420 --> 27:11.420
him up really quick.

27:11.420 --> 27:12.420
Good.

27:12.420 --> 27:14.140
Then Bobby will be able to complete the demo and buy the game that way.

27:14.180 --> 27:15.180
There you go.

27:18.180 --> 27:20.740
So basically you're going to put out a Bobby Black Wolf mode.

27:20.740 --> 27:23.260
That's an inside joke here, I know you wouldn't understand, but you're going to put out a

27:23.260 --> 27:25.260
Bobby Black Wolf mode as the demo.

27:25.260 --> 27:29.620
Or to date myself, it's Johnny Carson when he had a guest host on Monday.

27:29.620 --> 27:31.860
Let's see if anyone gets that.

27:31.860 --> 27:32.860
I actually get it.

27:32.860 --> 27:33.860
I do.

27:33.860 --> 27:34.860
All right.

27:34.860 --> 27:35.860
That's amazing.

27:35.860 --> 27:40.620
That's actually kind of funny because Dan and I were just watching old Carson episodes

27:40.620 --> 27:43.580
like two days ago.

27:44.020 --> 27:47.820
YYR is suggesting have the main boss show up, fight for five seconds, and then it cuts

27:47.820 --> 27:48.820
you off.

27:48.820 --> 27:52.020
You guys, you guys may have to collaborate off of it in there and see, hold on.

27:52.020 --> 27:53.020
Oh yeah.

27:53.020 --> 27:54.020
There you go.

27:54.020 --> 27:57.820
That's the Kanye just jumps in and says, nah, I'm going to let you finish if you buy the

27:57.820 --> 27:58.820
game.

27:58.820 --> 28:01.420
Well, that's another career girl goal.

28:01.420 --> 28:02.420
I want to win.

28:02.420 --> 28:03.860
I want to win a Grammy.

28:03.860 --> 28:07.140
So when he comes up there, I'm going to start a fist fight.

28:07.140 --> 28:08.140
It's a noble goal.

28:08.140 --> 28:11.540
He's going to take me down, but I'm not going out with it.

28:11.540 --> 28:12.540
Getting a few punches.

28:12.580 --> 28:14.460
I have a feeling he won't be back.

28:14.460 --> 28:17.420
Just call it, call it, call it a hunch, but I have a feeling he won't be back.

28:17.420 --> 28:18.420
All right.

28:18.420 --> 28:22.260
Anyway, we got to get into some of the other games going on besides just the floms in the

28:22.260 --> 28:23.260
world.

28:23.260 --> 28:25.860
We want to talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been

28:25.860 --> 28:27.260
playing this week.

28:27.260 --> 28:29.380
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

28:29.380 --> 28:30.380
I played flom.

28:30.380 --> 28:32.460
Why haven't the rest of you?

28:32.460 --> 28:33.460
No.

28:33.460 --> 28:34.460
I did.

28:34.460 --> 28:38.900
I played actually a crap load of dragon age today because I'm about ready to wrap up my

28:38.900 --> 28:39.900
fanfic.

28:40.620 --> 28:45.620
Five chapters ahead again every time I, I've been double posting chapters every day this

28:45.620 --> 28:49.020
week because the story is burning its way out of my brain.

28:49.020 --> 28:50.960
Like it won't stop.

28:50.960 --> 28:55.660
And hopefully this is going to give me my inspiration to actually sit down and work

28:55.660 --> 29:01.860
on my book because I have another book idea that I've been wanting to do for a while too.

29:01.860 --> 29:09.620
I also got to play with somebody else's new 3DS and it's actually kind of comfortable

29:09.660 --> 29:11.180
and I like the red one.

29:11.180 --> 29:15.180
I understand why Shane imported a blue one because the blue one is very pretty and this

29:15.180 --> 29:17.900
is Shane and it's a shame.

29:17.900 --> 29:21.380
But I like the red one and I think I might want it.

29:21.380 --> 29:29.620
However I did also finally sit down and play the Oregon Trail.

29:29.620 --> 29:30.620
You know the Oregon Trail.

29:30.620 --> 29:33.340
Oh, not the Oregon Trail, but the Oregon Trail.

29:33.340 --> 29:34.340
Oh yes.

29:34.340 --> 29:35.660
That's the, that's like the zombie one.

29:35.660 --> 29:36.660
That's the riff on that.

29:36.660 --> 29:37.660
Right?

29:37.660 --> 29:38.660
Exactly.

29:38.700 --> 29:44.500
We drove our station wagon through the mountains, stopped at a few malls, killed some zombies

29:44.500 --> 29:50.420
and stole cans of food, and then everybody but me died.

29:50.420 --> 29:52.140
The end.

29:52.140 --> 29:54.780
Was this real life or was this a game?

29:54.780 --> 29:56.900
Dot, dot, dot.

29:56.900 --> 29:57.900
Dot, dot, dot.

29:57.900 --> 30:00.140
Loki, how was your gaming week?

30:00.140 --> 30:04.220
I played a little bit of Lego Marvel Super Heroes because my son wanted to play that

30:04.220 --> 30:06.980
and I usually just play for a second.

30:07.020 --> 30:10.540
I've been noticing, like I said, that game is glitchier and glitchier every time I play

30:10.540 --> 30:11.540
it.

30:11.540 --> 30:13.180
Mostly I worked on my game this week.

30:13.180 --> 30:17.820
So I was trying to make a second level for it, but instead I ended up going back and

30:17.820 --> 30:20.340
just kind of tweaking some of the gameplay stuff.

30:20.340 --> 30:25.380
Like one of the things I had before was that the scale of everything makes the curbs a

30:25.380 --> 30:27.500
little too high to actually just get over.

30:27.500 --> 30:31.740
You can't just drive over them so that's why I added the jump in there in the first place.

30:31.740 --> 30:35.260
So it's still a little bit difficult to get over them and my son is having trouble trying

30:35.260 --> 30:39.380
to play the game and so I'm going to make all these curb ramp things so that you just

30:39.380 --> 30:41.620
drive over them and it works just fine.

30:41.620 --> 30:43.260
You need robot goats.

30:43.260 --> 30:46.580
Hey, I can put it on the list.

30:46.580 --> 30:47.580
Seriously, any idea.

30:47.580 --> 30:49.300
I will draw you a robot goat.

30:49.300 --> 30:51.140
I don't need a robot goat drawn.

30:51.140 --> 30:52.220
I can do that.

30:52.220 --> 30:53.220
I'm just saying.

30:53.220 --> 30:54.220
I'm putting all-

30:54.220 --> 30:57.340
Maybe she wants to draw you one as a present.

30:57.340 --> 30:58.340
Fine.

30:58.340 --> 31:00.860
It's fine.

31:00.860 --> 31:02.500
But anyways, yeah.

31:02.500 --> 31:03.500
I added more detail to it.

31:03.500 --> 31:07.700
I was going to have a new video to upload but apparently my video was too epic for YouTube

31:07.700 --> 31:13.620
to encode and so it's like, sorry, I can't encode this two gigabyte file that you're

31:13.620 --> 31:14.620
trying.

31:14.620 --> 31:19.220
It was an uncompressed AVI file that had like 60 frames per second, 1080p.

31:19.220 --> 31:23.700
It's just like, you got to put some sort of compression on this thing because I can't

31:23.700 --> 31:24.860
deal with it.

31:24.860 --> 31:27.900
So yeah, unfortunately I couldn't upload that.

31:27.900 --> 31:28.900
Hopefully soon.

31:28.900 --> 31:30.780
But I got a lot of other stuff done.

31:30.780 --> 31:36.060
I got my script to handle falling off the map so now it respawns you and everything

31:36.060 --> 31:40.500
which is kind of cool and added more detail so it looks a little bit more polished.

31:40.500 --> 31:44.180
So I'm just adding polish right now because the problem is I don't want to go back and

31:44.180 --> 31:47.260
have to edit the map later on.

31:47.260 --> 31:52.180
I just want to have that map being able to persist between levels so that's why I'm making

31:52.180 --> 31:54.460
my fixes now and then I'll do the levels.

31:54.460 --> 31:57.140
That and I haven't decided what I'm doing for level two yet.

31:57.140 --> 32:02.100
Well, I got to have something easy to ease into everything so that people can kind of

32:02.100 --> 32:04.980
understand the gameplay part because the first level is not really much of anything other

32:04.980 --> 32:07.580
than falling through the map.

32:07.580 --> 32:10.820
And so the first level has got to be kind of like, hey, here's how to play it a little

32:10.820 --> 32:13.540
bit and then it's going to get fucking nuts.

32:13.540 --> 32:19.300
But I have to have one level in between falling through the map and fucking nuts.

32:19.300 --> 32:21.980
So you have to have your kind of super basic level.

32:21.980 --> 32:26.920
Yeah, so I haven't figured out what broken thing I want to add to that yet.

32:26.920 --> 32:27.920
So I haven't figured it.

32:27.920 --> 32:32.660
And once I figure it out, then it'll be easy because I have a list like it's growing every

32:32.660 --> 32:37.960
day and my son keeps bugging me about it because one of the ideas he wanted is like, you should

32:37.960 --> 32:43.360
have mops on your car and you clean up stuff on the road.

32:43.360 --> 32:46.320
I'm like, okay, so you just drive over it and it cleans up.

32:46.320 --> 32:49.760
No, you should shoot the mops out the front of your car and it cleans up stuff.

32:49.760 --> 32:53.280
I'm like, okay, I'm taking any idea you have and I'm putting it in the game.

32:53.280 --> 32:54.720
I don't care how stupid it is.

32:54.720 --> 32:55.720
It's going in there.

32:56.720 --> 32:57.720
Everything.

32:57.720 --> 33:03.520
And so it'll be fun, but I'm working on it.

33:03.520 --> 33:04.520
All right.

33:04.520 --> 33:05.520
Well, good luck.

33:05.520 --> 33:09.480
It's not as easy as it sounds to make a game, that's for sure.

33:09.480 --> 33:14.620
My gaming week, I played quite a few classics that I keep talking about here on the show

33:14.620 --> 33:17.480
every week, like Diablo three continuing on with seasons.

33:17.480 --> 33:21.080
I'm already paragon 50 for this season and climbing.

33:21.080 --> 33:23.760
I have to ask you, since you brought up Diablo, sure.

33:23.800 --> 33:37.520
Did you see that, nevermind, they did the Icewind Dale ultimate edition came out, re-released.

33:37.520 --> 33:38.520
I didn't know if you'd be interested in that.

33:38.520 --> 33:40.040
I was going to tell you about it, but I forgot.

33:40.040 --> 33:41.040
So I interrupted you to tell you.

33:41.040 --> 33:42.040
That's all right.

33:42.040 --> 33:43.040
I'll have to check that out.

33:43.040 --> 33:44.040
Okay.

33:44.040 --> 33:45.040
Bye.

33:45.040 --> 33:46.040
All right.

33:46.040 --> 33:47.040
Bye.

33:47.040 --> 33:48.040
You're leaving?

33:48.040 --> 33:49.040
All right.

33:49.040 --> 33:50.040
So still been playing Diablo three, working on seasons, logged into Final Fantasy 14 for

33:50.040 --> 33:53.320
the first time in like three weeks the other night and I kind of missed it and I hadn't

33:53.320 --> 33:54.600
really been doing the new content.

33:54.600 --> 33:58.360
So I finally was like, all right, time to suck it up and do this Ampedor keep hard mode.

33:58.360 --> 33:59.860
And it was actually a really fun dungeon.

33:59.860 --> 34:01.240
So I enjoyed that.

34:01.240 --> 34:04.280
I've been playing other standbys on consoles as well.

34:04.280 --> 34:07.920
Like I had a friend over earlier today and we were playing some stuff on the Wii U because

34:07.920 --> 34:13.360
we use a great living room console to play Mario Kart eight and super smash brothers,

34:13.360 --> 34:16.960
of course, which I feel like I'm getting a little better at smash brothers.

34:16.960 --> 34:17.960
Thank God.

34:17.960 --> 34:19.360
Because I was, I was really worried there for a minute.

34:19.360 --> 34:22.960
I love that video that you put out, the realistic clapping.

34:22.960 --> 34:23.960
The what?

34:23.960 --> 34:24.960
Have you ever seen that?

34:24.960 --> 34:26.600
The realistic clapping in Smash Brothers?

34:26.600 --> 34:28.880
Oh, I saw a link to it, but I didn't watch it.

34:28.880 --> 34:29.880
What is it?

34:29.880 --> 34:32.560
It's like, it's just basically someone adding fully sounds to the clapping.

34:32.560 --> 34:35.800
Cause a lot of it, you know, if you watch it, how they actually clap, it's really stupid.

34:35.800 --> 34:40.640
But like some of them are really funny, like Donkey Kong, because there's like, it's like,

34:40.640 --> 34:41.640
it's just really silly.

34:41.640 --> 34:42.640
Okay.

34:42.640 --> 34:43.640
Yeah.

34:43.640 --> 34:44.640
Like at the end of the match, some of the clapping is really silly.

34:44.640 --> 34:45.640
Okay.

34:45.640 --> 34:46.640
I gotcha.

34:46.640 --> 34:47.640
I gotcha.

34:47.640 --> 34:48.640
Um, let's see.

34:48.640 --> 34:52.360
So, uh, there was, um, that, and then we were speaking of living room games, we were playing

34:52.360 --> 34:55.200
Jackbox Party Pack, which is always a good time.

34:55.200 --> 35:00.080
And, uh, I, I literally cried from laughing so hard at one of Alan's drawings.

35:00.080 --> 35:01.080
I loved it so much.

35:01.080 --> 35:04.880
I put it on my Twitter over at twitter.com slash sky, S K I E.

35:04.880 --> 35:09.600
You have to see it and I've submitted it as evidence for why Alan is the best drawful

35:09.600 --> 35:10.600
player in the world.

35:10.600 --> 35:15.200
Uh, so hopefully you'll check that out at some point, um, new stuff though, I did actually

35:15.200 --> 35:16.200
play some new games.

35:16.200 --> 35:17.880
I'll talk about these very quickly.

35:17.880 --> 35:21.600
Um, I played Pokemon shuffle on the 3DS.

35:21.600 --> 35:25.920
I have a full review that's going to go up to vog network probably tomorrow, Monday,

35:25.920 --> 35:29.920
uh, which I wrote out just because I had a lot of very strong feelings about the game.

35:29.920 --> 35:32.560
So I just kind of wanted to get it all out, uh, and write it out.

35:32.560 --> 35:36.200
So I don't necessarily want to spoil all of it, but I will say this much.

35:36.200 --> 35:38.000
Um, it is a free game.

35:38.000 --> 35:44.600
And so when a game is free, you have to really kinda, you know, you have to go, okay, well

35:44.600 --> 35:46.200
at the end of the day, it's free.

35:46.200 --> 35:48.800
So even if it's a bad game, it's still free.

35:48.800 --> 35:49.800
Yars.

35:49.800 --> 35:50.800
Huh?

35:51.000 --> 35:52.000
That's true.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.200
I would say Pokemon shuffle is still better than Yaris.

35:54.200 --> 35:55.200
I'll give it that.

35:55.200 --> 35:59.440
But I would say being kicked in the crotch is better than Yaris.

35:59.440 --> 36:07.160
My biggest problem with Pokemon shuffle is that the game, the balance of the 99 cent

36:07.160 --> 36:11.400
jewels that you buy on the Nintendo network and what those jewels actually buy you in

36:11.400 --> 36:14.600
the game is a little bit off to me.

36:14.600 --> 36:20.200
And mostly, and most importantly at the end of the day, here's where I believe Nintendo's

36:20.200 --> 36:23.760
biggest problem is with this and, and some of the Nintendo fanboys are going to want

36:23.760 --> 36:27.700
to fight me on this, but really think this one out guys, because this is what really

36:27.700 --> 36:29.660
bothers me about Pokemon shuffle.

36:29.660 --> 36:35.460
So Pokemon shuffle is kind of trying to be like a Facebook or a mobile game type of experience.

36:35.460 --> 36:36.760
Like that's the free to play game, right?

36:36.760 --> 36:43.120
It's trying to be the Facebook or free mobile game game that's available on your 3DS instead,

36:43.120 --> 36:44.120
right?

36:44.120 --> 36:46.960
Because Nintendo doesn't really want to make stuff for mobile.

36:46.960 --> 36:50.800
So they're making, I guess, these more mobile and free experiences that are available on

36:50.800 --> 36:52.300
the 3DS.

36:52.300 --> 36:56.600
But the problem and what's missing is that on Facebook, like what's huge on Facebook

36:56.600 --> 36:58.740
and mobile right now, like trivia crack, right?

36:58.740 --> 36:59.740
Is like a big one.

36:59.740 --> 37:02.360
There's a lot of people playing that on Facebook and a lot of people playing that on mobile.

37:02.360 --> 37:03.940
Why do we play trivia crack?

37:03.940 --> 37:08.800
We are signing into trivia crack so we can play against our friends and compete with

37:08.800 --> 37:09.920
our friends.

37:09.920 --> 37:13.680
And when we beat our friends in a match, we go, ha ha, I beat you and oh, wasn't that

37:13.680 --> 37:16.920
question funny and you're trying to work your way up the leaderboards and all this

37:16.920 --> 37:17.920
stuff, right?

37:17.920 --> 37:24.480
Pokemon shuffle is a social media game with no social interaction.

37:24.480 --> 37:28.520
Now some, you know, people that maybe have gotten more enjoyment out of it than I did

37:28.520 --> 37:31.080
might say, but Rob, you're forgetting about street passes.

37:31.080 --> 37:35.940
You can street pass people and you'll get their little card and it tells you, you know,

37:35.940 --> 37:37.720
about themselves and so forth.

37:37.720 --> 37:41.980
Eh, I say it's a really weak implementation that's next to nothing.

37:41.980 --> 37:46.700
All it tells you is this is how many Pokemon they've collected, eh.

37:46.700 --> 37:51.660
And like when you play Pokemon X and Y or white and black, ruby, sapphire, whatever

37:51.660 --> 37:54.180
it is, you're collecting the Pokemon.

37:54.180 --> 37:56.380
You might give them your own names.

37:56.380 --> 37:58.980
You're going to customize their abilities.

37:58.980 --> 38:01.820
You start to, you start to breed the Pokemon at some point, right?

38:01.820 --> 38:05.260
So you start to feel a little more connection to this collection you're making.

38:05.260 --> 38:07.180
Pokemon shuffle, eh eh.

38:07.180 --> 38:12.220
You fight this particular Pokemon and there's a 40% chance you're going to catch it.

38:12.220 --> 38:18.620
Ubi, you can increase that to a 70% chance if you buy a great ball for 2,500 coins.

38:18.620 --> 38:20.740
Oh, you're out of coins?

38:20.740 --> 38:26.220
Why don't you spend a 99 cent jewel on more coins to up your chances of collecting this

38:26.220 --> 38:33.580
Pokemon that at the end of the day will increase the number on your street pass card by one?

38:33.580 --> 38:40.060
So my issue with Pokemon shuffle is that as fun as a puzzler as it is for the 15 minutes

38:40.060 --> 38:44.620
you play it before you run out of energy, there's no point to the game.

38:44.620 --> 38:47.540
There's no point to the game.

38:47.540 --> 38:52.040
So that was, that was where I got lost a little bit on Pokemon shuffle.

38:52.040 --> 38:55.400
But for the 15 minutes you play it, it's a fun little puzzler game.

38:55.400 --> 39:00.120
So I didn't give the game an F, but I didn't exactly give it an A either.

39:00.120 --> 39:03.420
So anyway, there's that, Pokemon shuffle.

39:03.420 --> 39:06.580
One other game I'm going to talk about, and I hate to be so negative, usually I'm so positive

39:06.580 --> 39:07.580
on games.

39:07.580 --> 39:10.500
There's so many great games out there, but what, let it go.

39:10.500 --> 39:16.180
I can't let this one go because this game that I played was bad and I was really disappointed

39:16.180 --> 39:18.080
because it was a game I was looking forward to.

39:18.080 --> 39:21.740
We talked about it a couple of weeks ago on the show and I was like, they're making this

39:21.740 --> 39:22.740
game.

39:22.740 --> 39:26.580
They're going to remake Qbert for the PlayStation four.

39:26.580 --> 39:30.540
It's not good.

39:30.540 --> 39:37.480
And I hate to say it because I'm a fan of Qbert, but I'm not a fan of Qbert Reloaded.

39:37.480 --> 39:40.980
When you play the game on PlayStation four, you can play classic Qbert.

39:40.980 --> 39:46.580
And actually, funny enough, where the game is best is when you're just doing the classic,

39:46.580 --> 39:49.840
you know, arcade board emulation, whatever.

39:49.840 --> 39:52.980
If that's all you want out of Qbert on PlayStation four, then cool.

39:52.980 --> 39:53.980
You're going to get it.

39:53.980 --> 39:56.220
But yes, then there's this new mode as well.

39:56.220 --> 40:00.700
It's the Qbert Reloaded where, yes, they've switched things to now it's a hexagonal board

40:00.700 --> 40:02.580
and I'm okay with that.

40:02.580 --> 40:09.740
I'm okay with the switch to a hexagonal board if it controlled well, but it doesn't.

40:09.740 --> 40:12.860
And the game really dies on its controls.

40:12.860 --> 40:20.060
I have never seen a game where the controls were like the reason why it sank.

40:20.060 --> 40:23.760
And I think for me, the controls in Qbert Reloaded, awful.

40:23.760 --> 40:28.520
And it's just, the old Qbert game from the 80s really snaps.

40:28.520 --> 40:30.120
You know, I think that was the thing about it.

40:30.120 --> 40:33.520
Yeah, it has the joystick that's in the four angular directions.

40:33.520 --> 40:37.520
It's you know, upright, up left, down left, you know, that whole thing.

40:37.520 --> 40:39.180
But it really snaps when you play it.

40:39.180 --> 40:41.800
And I noticed that when playing in the classic mode.

40:41.800 --> 40:46.240
But when you're playing in this hexagonal new Qbert mode, it's not just the fact that

40:46.240 --> 40:48.280
they made them six sided squares.

40:48.280 --> 40:49.580
That I can deal with.

40:49.580 --> 40:51.880
But the fact is that Qbert doesn't snap.

40:51.880 --> 40:56.400
He kind of slogs.

40:56.400 --> 40:59.440
You have to probably get your hands on it and play it yourself, which I'm actually not

40:59.440 --> 41:00.660
recommending you do.

41:00.660 --> 41:04.480
But if you really go look at a YouTube or something and look at how he moves.

41:04.480 --> 41:05.760
And it's just so different.

41:05.760 --> 41:08.960
And it just feels cheap.

41:08.960 --> 41:11.940
Especially for like a PlayStation 4 game, it feels cheap.

41:11.940 --> 41:14.820
And I'm okay with retro and classic things.

41:14.820 --> 41:19.920
But when I'm looking at this game going, didn't they have a Qbert on PlayStation 1 that was

41:19.920 --> 41:21.960
more fun than this?

41:21.960 --> 41:24.680
There was a Qbert on ColecoVision that was really fun.

41:24.680 --> 41:28.400
There was a Qbert on PlayStation 1 that was like a Qbert reimagined or whatever that was

41:28.400 --> 41:29.400
better than this.

41:29.400 --> 41:30.400
And I hate to say it.

41:30.400 --> 41:31.640
Yeah, I do remember that.

41:31.640 --> 41:33.880
I know that there's people that worked hard on this game.

41:33.880 --> 41:37.280
And I don't like giving games bad reviews for that.

41:37.280 --> 41:43.600
But I'm sorry, I have a responsibility to say that this game just it's not it wasn't

41:43.600 --> 41:46.300
it's only worth it to play the classic Qbert game.

41:46.300 --> 41:48.360
Just I wouldn't even really touch the new one.

41:48.360 --> 41:53.560
It's it's I can't I sat there the other night trying to move around the board.

41:53.560 --> 41:57.080
And I just fell off the board repeatedly fell off the board.

41:57.080 --> 42:01.400
It'd be nice if maybe I could re customize the controls or something maybe make the buttons

42:01.400 --> 42:02.400
hopper.

42:02.400 --> 42:04.220
I don't even know if that would fix it, though.

42:04.220 --> 42:08.400
And then you saw that video I uploaded right where the little springy guy was his name

42:08.400 --> 42:12.920
Clyde is name quietly, which was chasing you down the thing, right.

42:12.920 --> 42:17.020
So you the trick is you go to a flying disk to get away from quietly right.

42:17.020 --> 42:21.640
So here's the thing, quietly grabs me right as I'm about to get on the disk.

42:21.640 --> 42:23.120
So I die.

42:23.120 --> 42:25.580
But I die as I'm falling on the disk.

42:25.580 --> 42:29.540
And the disk takes my dead body to the top of the grid, and then drops me on the top

42:29.540 --> 42:30.540
of the grid.

42:30.540 --> 42:31.540
That's awesome.

42:31.540 --> 42:33.820
So now not only am I dead, but I burned the disk.

42:33.820 --> 42:35.100
That's still really funny.

42:35.100 --> 42:40.700
And I'm not sure if it's because it's a heart meter now instead of just I was like the hell

42:40.700 --> 42:41.700
just happened.

42:41.700 --> 42:43.080
I just I didn't like it.

42:43.080 --> 42:44.200
It's not funny when you're playing it.

42:44.200 --> 42:45.200
I know that.

42:45.200 --> 42:46.200
No.

42:46.380 --> 42:52.160
It's a part of Qbert's corpse lying, you know, desiccating on this disk as it's floating

42:52.160 --> 42:53.880
to heaven.

42:53.880 --> 42:55.320
Okay.

42:55.320 --> 42:56.320
That's really funny.

42:56.320 --> 43:02.200
I would commission art of that continues in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,

43:02.200 --> 43:05.400
why would anyone remake Qbert?

43:05.400 --> 43:07.960
It's hard to remake a classic game, right?

43:07.960 --> 43:10.160
Like, but some of them are done really well.

43:10.160 --> 43:16.160
And I would say Pac-Man, not only Pac-Man versus but Pac-Man.

43:17.120 --> 43:18.120
Why can't I?

43:18.120 --> 43:19.120
Pac-Man CE.

43:19.120 --> 43:20.120
Yeah.

43:20.120 --> 43:21.120
Yeah.

43:21.120 --> 43:22.120
Championship edition thing.

43:22.120 --> 43:23.120
Thank you.

43:23.120 --> 43:24.120
Why can't I?

43:24.120 --> 43:25.120
DX especially is so good.

43:25.120 --> 43:27.400
Like that's a great reboot of a classic game.

43:27.400 --> 43:33.080
And I would say, well, if you can reinvent a classic game like that, then that's a, that's

43:33.080 --> 43:35.840
a note of how you do it really.

43:35.840 --> 43:38.200
But this is not, you know, it's just not.

43:38.200 --> 43:43.280
And I think, I think Qbert is a classic game that a lot of people really forget about.

43:43.280 --> 43:45.160
I think it was a really cool game.

43:45.160 --> 43:48.840
There was actually a proper sequel to Qbert called Qbert's Cubes.

43:48.840 --> 43:53.880
But I bet nobody really knows the game unless maybe you found it randomly on a mayhem emulator

43:53.880 --> 43:54.880
somewhere.

43:54.880 --> 43:57.520
It wasn't a, it wasn't a very big, big deal.

43:57.520 --> 43:58.520
So anyway.

43:58.520 --> 44:01.120
It wasn't really that good of a game either.

44:01.120 --> 44:04.200
Tigerclaw in chat says, could be worse.

44:04.200 --> 44:06.440
What if they remake Dig Dug?

44:06.440 --> 44:07.440
They did.

44:07.440 --> 44:09.320
They did do a Dig Dug on Xbox 360, didn't they?

44:09.320 --> 44:11.240
Yeah, because they had all these different versions.

44:11.240 --> 44:17.240
They did Dig Dug and they also did Rally, whatever the other Rally game was.

44:17.240 --> 44:22.680
All they really did to Dig Dug, all they really did was it was the same game with high definition

44:22.680 --> 44:23.680
graphics.

44:23.680 --> 44:26.240
But like, it was like, you were still running like the same ROM.

44:26.240 --> 44:29.160
It was just like a prettier graphic overlay on top of it.

44:29.160 --> 44:32.840
So, and that was, that was okay because they only charged $5 for it too.

44:32.840 --> 44:34.040
And it was, it was fine.

44:34.040 --> 44:35.360
I, well, I played that one.

44:35.360 --> 44:38.480
It was part of one of those comp, the Namco compilations that they had.

44:38.480 --> 44:39.760
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:39.800 --> 44:42.800
There was one in the arcades in the nineties that was pretty good too, that I actually

44:42.800 --> 44:43.800
really liked.

44:43.800 --> 44:44.800
So.

44:44.800 --> 44:47.840
Oh, Act Deft naming another classic reinvention that was really good.

44:47.840 --> 44:50.560
Space Invaders Extreme was extremely fun.

44:50.560 --> 44:51.560
That's right.

44:51.560 --> 44:53.400
That was a frickin rad game.

44:53.400 --> 44:57.600
So yeah, classic game reinventions can be done right, but I can also understand the

44:57.600 --> 44:58.800
hesitation a lot.

44:58.800 --> 45:02.520
Qbert is not the first to be done poorly.

45:02.520 --> 45:03.800
So there you go.

45:03.800 --> 45:08.440
Anyway, all right, let's get on to, let's get on to some other news instead of just

45:08.440 --> 45:09.440
our gaming week.

45:09.440 --> 45:12.320
Let's get into what has been going on around the video game world this week.

45:12.320 --> 45:14.160
Quickly, some housekeeping.

45:14.160 --> 45:19.560
We will be here next week on March 1st, but we will not be here on March 8th.

45:19.560 --> 45:24.400
That is because I am going with Bobby Blackwolf and some of our listeners.

45:24.400 --> 45:26.640
PAX East is where I'm going to be.

45:26.640 --> 45:30.720
So I'm looking forward to seeing you guys all around the show.

45:30.720 --> 45:33.160
I imagine it's going to be a pretty crazy crowd.

45:33.160 --> 45:36.400
I'm going there as a fan just like anybody else.

45:36.400 --> 45:40.560
So I'll probably be trying to get some hands on with any classic games that they have there.

45:40.560 --> 45:44.600
If there's Qbert there, the classic version on the ColecoVision, I'll probably be there

45:44.600 --> 45:45.600
playing it.

45:45.600 --> 45:48.880
So I remember the first time I went to PAX East, they had a really great little classic

45:48.880 --> 45:49.880
game room.

45:49.880 --> 45:51.920
So I hope to check that out.

45:51.920 --> 45:56.120
Please, if I don't have the VOG shirt on, I'm sure Bobby will.

45:56.120 --> 45:59.880
So if you see one of us at the show, please, please pull us over and say hello.

45:59.880 --> 46:02.400
We'd love to say hi and meet you and talk to you.

46:02.400 --> 46:04.280
And yeah, don't be shy.

46:04.280 --> 46:05.560
We're gamers just like you.

46:05.560 --> 46:06.920
So we'll be around.

46:06.920 --> 46:08.320
And whatever else they show.

46:08.320 --> 46:10.280
Final Fantasy XIV is having a panel at PAX East.

46:10.280 --> 46:12.600
So I personally can't wait to go and check that out.

46:12.600 --> 46:14.560
So we will be there at PAX East.

46:14.560 --> 46:19.920
Speaking of Bobby, I mentioned earlier in the show that he had a pretty cool show tonight.

46:19.920 --> 46:24.320
And I promised I would give this a shout out here on OLR and I want to make good on that.

46:24.320 --> 46:28.360
Bobby had a Kickstarter campaign on his show tonight.

46:28.360 --> 46:35.240
And it's for a, it's not really a game, but it's a virtual reality rock opera.

46:35.240 --> 46:38.720
And they described it as Fantasia meets Tron.

46:38.720 --> 46:42.520
And I was kind of like, that is awesome meets awesomer.

46:42.520 --> 46:44.240
So I was a fan of this.

46:44.240 --> 46:47.520
This was Nurin, the New Renaissance is the name of the project.

46:47.520 --> 46:50.080
And you can find that over on Kickstarter.

46:50.080 --> 46:54.680
If you need the link, it'll be over on vognetwork.com and Bobby's latest show notes.

46:54.680 --> 47:00.480
But one of the guys behind this happens to be Vert, who's a pretty well-known composer

47:00.480 --> 47:01.480
these days.

47:01.480 --> 47:04.640
You know, did you happen to play the Ducktales remastered?

47:05.040 --> 47:06.840
Did you play that in the soundtrack to that game?

47:06.840 --> 47:08.040
Yeah, that was Vert.

47:08.040 --> 47:13.920
So Vert, along with Jesse Seeley, who are behind this game, the core team that make

47:13.920 --> 47:17.240
up this experience, they were both on Bobby's show tonight.

47:17.240 --> 47:19.280
And it was a great interview and a great listen.

47:19.280 --> 47:23.120
So I wanted to, I promise, because Vert actually came into the chat room and was chatting with

47:23.120 --> 47:24.680
folks during Bobby's show.

47:24.680 --> 47:27.000
So I promised Vert I would give it a shout out here on OLR.

47:27.000 --> 47:34.600
So shout out Nurin over on Kickstarter, N-U-R-E-N, $15 will back the experience.

47:34.600 --> 47:35.560
And the soundtrack.

47:35.560 --> 47:38.680
And I was like, you know what, if nothing else, that soundtrack is going to rule.

47:38.680 --> 47:42.640
They actually played a little bit of it on Bobby's show, and it was awesome.

47:42.640 --> 47:43.640
So there you go.

47:43.640 --> 47:44.640
All right.

47:44.640 --> 47:45.640
That's our housekeeping.

47:45.640 --> 47:47.600
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

47:47.600 --> 47:52.960
We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, and google.com slash

47:52.960 --> 47:56.440
plus orange lounge radio.

47:56.440 --> 47:58.320
Let's get into some news.

47:58.320 --> 48:01.080
There's a bit more going on this week than there was in previous weeks.

48:01.080 --> 48:03.480
Some big topics we got to get into tonight, right, Loki?

48:03.480 --> 48:09.360
Yeah, so everybody wants to know, why can't you just find amiibos out in the stores?

48:09.360 --> 48:15.640
Well, apparently, according to the president of Nintendo, they're blaming the labor strike

48:15.640 --> 48:18.640
that apparently is going on in the US.

48:18.640 --> 48:22.880
They're saying that for the last six months, labor negotiations on the west coast of the

48:22.880 --> 48:29.620
United States have made getting goods to shore slow, as the amount of berths open are lower

48:29.620 --> 48:32.560
than usual, and therefore harbors are congested.

48:32.560 --> 48:37.240
Many of the goods sent to the US have not arrived to their destination, however, this

48:37.240 --> 48:41.800
had little effect on amiibos and software sales, as they are light enough that we can

48:41.800 --> 48:45.340
even ship by air, if we have to.

48:45.340 --> 48:51.160
Even though the new Nintendo DS has had a handicap against its supply, the public has

48:51.160 --> 48:54.940
still shown huge interest in it, and its sales are phenomenal.

48:54.940 --> 49:02.660
So they're blaming that as the reason why you're not able to find them in the United

49:02.660 --> 49:03.660
States.

49:03.660 --> 49:05.180
No, there's that one guy buying them all.

49:05.180 --> 49:11.300
I just, I don't believe that that's all the case, and he even kind of goes back and saying,

49:11.300 --> 49:15.900
well, true, this is holding things up, however, they're actually light enough that we can

49:15.900 --> 49:21.220
ship them by air, so he kind of goes back on his excuse.

49:21.220 --> 49:23.180
This is an awfully convenient excuse kind of thing?

49:23.180 --> 49:24.180
Yeah.

49:24.420 --> 49:28.500
I'm willing to hear it out a little bit, like, okay, like, you know, the 3DS, especially

49:28.500 --> 49:32.860
in the case of the new 3DSs, I feel like the amiibo thing's been going on longer than the

49:32.860 --> 49:37.100
Port Strike, so I'm not, I don't know how much I buy it there.

49:37.100 --> 49:43.100
But with the new 3DSs, demand for that does seem to be a lot higher than, like, it's not

49:43.100 --> 49:47.980
even so much the Monster Hunter system and the Majora's Mask system, because those sold

49:47.980 --> 49:51.260
out within seconds, right, and that was way before, those were the preorders when there

49:51.260 --> 49:53.500
was no Port Strike or whatever thing going on.

49:53.540 --> 49:56.940
We're talking about, it's even hard right now to find just the plain red systems and

49:56.940 --> 50:00.820
the, what other color is there, red and black, something like that.

50:00.820 --> 50:04.260
They're just, I'm not really interested in buying one right now, so that's why I haven't

50:04.260 --> 50:05.260
tried to run out and find one.

50:05.260 --> 50:10.300
I don't know why they're so popular right now when there's nothing exclusive for them.

50:10.300 --> 50:14.980
I can't figure it out either, to be honest, and I have a lot of friends that are buying

50:14.980 --> 50:17.700
them, and I don't mean to, like, well, I do, I should do this.

50:17.700 --> 50:20.980
I understand that, like, you get them for the future and stuff, but.

50:20.980 --> 50:25.780
And I know a lot of people that are buying them because they haven't bought a DS since

50:25.780 --> 50:29.860
either the original 3DS or even further back than that.

50:29.860 --> 50:33.980
So that I get, I get, I totally get that, because, like, if you're new to the XL thing

50:33.980 --> 50:39.300
as well, then okay, yeah, there's a lot of new stuff, but I'm just like, otherwise, I

50:39.300 --> 50:40.940
don't know why.

50:40.940 --> 50:45.420
Maybe it's the Majora's Mask or the Monster Hunter thing, like, you know, to be fair,

50:45.420 --> 50:50.500
to be fair, I had a 3DS, and when they put out that Zelda one, the Triforce one, I had

50:50.500 --> 50:51.500
to have it.

50:51.500 --> 50:54.780
So I sold my old one and bought the 3DS with the Zelda sound.

50:54.780 --> 50:58.260
I don't know, if you want Majora's Mask on the outside, just buy a sticker or some shit

50:58.260 --> 50:59.260
for it.

50:59.260 --> 51:00.260
I don't understand why it's there.

51:00.260 --> 51:01.900
But it's not official that way!

51:01.900 --> 51:04.980
Who gives a fuck if it's official or not?

51:04.980 --> 51:06.940
I can't show off to all my gamer friends!

51:06.940 --> 51:10.660
Yeah, ooh, look at, I got this 3DS that everyone else has.

51:10.660 --> 51:14.000
Yeah, I just, I don't get it, but whatever.

51:14.000 --> 51:17.940
And then also, the other thing is, there, I think we talked about how there's gonna

51:17.940 --> 51:23.060
be some exclusive amiibos, you know, they're gonna be doing like a silver and gold Mario

51:23.060 --> 51:24.060
and stuff like that.

51:24.060 --> 51:30.740
Well, apparently the gold Mario is gonna be exclusive for Walmart, and it's gonna be offered

51:30.740 --> 51:37.940
around Easter time, which is also when Mario Party 10 apparently is coming out, but I just

51:37.940 --> 51:39.020
don't get it.

51:39.020 --> 51:43.960
If you paint it gold, then all of a sudden people are gonna go batshit crazy for it because

51:43.960 --> 51:46.180
it's slightly different than something else.

51:47.060 --> 51:53.260
Okay, cool, I guess, you know, that's important to you.

51:53.260 --> 51:57.660
It's just the little, and the other thing is that I think that, isn't it like for these

51:57.660 --> 51:59.620
supposedly limited edition things?

51:59.620 --> 52:05.020
Yeah, well, they've done that, they did like crystal figures and stuff like that in Disney

52:05.020 --> 52:09.660
Infinity, and I know they have variants in Skylanders as well.

52:09.660 --> 52:14.980
The only thing I have to ask is, are they gonna show up as gold and silver in the game,

52:14.980 --> 52:20.980
because that's how they are in, you know, Disney Infinity and Skylanders, is they actually

52:20.980 --> 52:25.580
show up in their variants in those games, so it kind of, you know, behooves you a little

52:25.580 --> 52:29.780
bit to buy these limited editions, because at least it shows up differently.

52:29.780 --> 52:34.740
If it's just seriously just a paint job, and it's just gonna show up as a regular Mario

52:34.740 --> 52:37.820
when you hook it up to the game, then it's kind of stupid.

52:37.820 --> 52:41.940
Well, see, that was what I was wondering about, is like, if there are like any legit perks

52:41.940 --> 52:46.020
to having them, other than them just being, ooh, sparkles.

52:46.020 --> 52:47.020
I don't know.

52:47.020 --> 52:50.260
I mean, cool, I guess.

52:50.260 --> 52:55.680
Mario Party 10 comes out on March 20th, apparently, on the Wii U, so I guess we'll find out when

52:55.680 --> 52:56.740
that comes out.

52:56.740 --> 52:59.060
But no word on the silver one yet, right?

52:59.060 --> 53:00.820
No word on the silver one yet.

53:00.820 --> 53:05.420
Yeah, Act After Chat is noting that there's also a silver Mario coming out, but we don't

53:05.420 --> 53:06.420
know.

53:06.420 --> 53:10.020
Yeah, it's probably, if I would guess, usually the big players and that kind of stuff, it's

53:10.020 --> 53:16.060
either gonna be Toys R Us or GameStop, probably.

53:16.060 --> 53:19.620
Some folks in chat talking about the 3DS, and kind of responding to what I was saying

53:19.620 --> 53:25.020
a little bit ago about the, you know, why did you get a new 3DS, continues in chat,

53:25.020 --> 53:27.940
says, Xenoblade Chronicle, more people will get to play it.

53:27.940 --> 53:31.620
True, but it isn't out yet, you know, and it will be out, but.

53:31.620 --> 53:35.700
And just think about it, too, you're like, oh, I bought a new 3DS for Xenoblade Chronicles,

53:35.700 --> 53:41.380
but what if they put out a special Xenoblade Chronicles new 3DS when that comes out?

53:41.380 --> 53:43.140
See, that's what I'm afraid of.

53:43.140 --> 53:48.060
And you know that there's still at least one or two more Nintendo Directs before that comes

53:48.060 --> 53:49.060
out, so.

53:49.060 --> 53:50.060
Good thinking, good thinking.

53:50.060 --> 53:53.100
I'm, you know, I wouldn't doubt that they're gonna do something like that.

53:53.100 --> 53:56.380
Let's see, Act F saying, a lot of people were worried that those gold and silver Mario were

53:56.380 --> 54:00.380
Club Nintendo Elite rewards, despite Nintendo stating that all Elite rewards were gonna

54:00.380 --> 54:03.740
be digital games, but, you know, people were still worried.

54:03.780 --> 54:08.220
AkumaJP saying, sorry to say, impulse buy, I got the Zelda new 3DS.

54:08.220 --> 54:10.020
Hey, you know what?

54:10.020 --> 54:12.340
I am not one to tell you how to spend your money.

54:12.340 --> 54:15.740
You earn your hard-earned money, you spend it on whatever the hell you want, but I can

54:15.740 --> 54:21.620
just sit here and say, for me, I don't really understand why, but at the same time, I have

54:21.620 --> 54:28.420
Mass Effect 3 on PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U.

54:28.420 --> 54:33.020
And people go, you are stupid, and I go, here's my middle finger.

54:33.020 --> 54:35.260
So, it's what I like.

54:35.260 --> 54:36.900
What's more surprising is that I don't have all this.

54:36.900 --> 54:39.900
And how often do you play Mass Effect 3 on-

54:39.900 --> 54:40.900
Yeah, Rob.

54:40.900 --> 54:45.060
Any more, it's very rare, but I still think the multiplayer is still really good, but

54:45.060 --> 54:47.300
to be fair, multiplayer is really PC, if anything.

54:47.300 --> 54:48.940
So, have you finished it on Wii U?

54:48.940 --> 54:51.900
I didn't play it start to finish on Wii U, but I had to see how the comic was.

54:51.900 --> 54:55.180
Remember, it was only like 18 bucks, and I bought it on Wii U.

54:55.180 --> 54:59.500
That was more of a collector's thing at that point, you know?

54:59.500 --> 55:03.540
Are you grilling everybody that's spending $12 on little amiibo figures?

55:03.540 --> 55:05.020
Do you give them the third degree, Loki?

55:05.020 --> 55:06.020
I would.

55:06.020 --> 55:07.020
I just silently judge them.

55:07.020 --> 55:08.180
Why are you buying that?

55:08.180 --> 55:09.540
I don't understand why you'd buy that.

55:09.540 --> 55:10.540
It does nothing.

55:10.540 --> 55:11.540
Because they're cute.

55:11.540 --> 55:12.540
They're cute.

55:12.540 --> 55:13.540
They're not cute.

55:13.540 --> 55:14.540
They're statues, and they don't even move.

55:14.540 --> 55:18.020
Let's see, the SEG in chat asks- Hi, SEG.

55:18.020 --> 55:19.020
Question.

55:19.020 --> 55:24.180
Is there any feature advantage to getting a Wii U when I have a 3DS XL, beyond using

55:24.180 --> 55:26.460
the 3DS as a controller in Smash Brothers?

55:26.460 --> 55:31.380
So, I'm assuming, is there any more, like, synergy things between the two systems?

55:31.380 --> 55:34.940
Because obviously, my obvious answer would be, well, you can't play Mario 8 on the new

55:34.940 --> 55:35.940
3DS.

55:35.940 --> 55:36.940
Amiibo support.

55:36.940 --> 55:37.940
Yeah, amiibo support.

55:37.940 --> 55:40.500
I would imagine that there's probably stuff that they haven't talked about yet that they're

55:40.500 --> 55:45.580
gonna do with it, unless they come out with yet another new, new 3DS.

55:45.580 --> 55:50.180
I would think that, remember, there was the rumor a couple months ago, that makes an awful

55:50.180 --> 55:55.580
lot of sense, that the streaming technology that's built into that new 3DS matches what's

55:55.580 --> 56:00.540
in the Wii U, so someday, they'll probably be able to be Wii U game pads, and I wouldn't

56:00.540 --> 56:01.980
doubt at all that that would end up being true.

56:01.980 --> 56:04.980
Yeah, the problem is, though, is that the Wii, I understand that they could be Wii U-

56:04.980 --> 56:05.980
But that's not announced yet.

56:05.980 --> 56:06.980
I understand.

56:06.980 --> 56:07.980
Just to be clear.

56:07.980 --> 56:12.620
They could be Wii U, you know, game pads, but the problem is that the Wii U can't, I

56:12.620 --> 56:16.900
don't think, can handle more than one stream, which is why you don't have games that support

56:16.900 --> 56:20.980
multiple game pads.

56:20.980 --> 56:22.540
But not yet, but maybe soon.

56:22.540 --> 56:23.540
Who knows?

56:23.540 --> 56:24.540
All right.

56:24.540 --> 56:28.180
5th Dream in chat says, hey, this isn't a Judge Rob podcast, okay?

56:28.180 --> 56:29.700
Thank you, 5th Dream.

56:29.700 --> 56:30.700
Thank you.

56:30.700 --> 56:31.700
Nice to know I have at least one supporter.

56:31.700 --> 56:32.700
What?

56:32.700 --> 56:33.700
What?

56:33.700 --> 56:34.700
I'm judging you.

56:34.700 --> 56:35.700
Yeah, yeah.

56:35.700 --> 56:38.260
For other reasons, other reasons, not your gaming choices.

56:38.260 --> 56:43.340
All right, speaking of gaming choices and Amiibo and so forth, Nintendo's Amiibo is

56:43.340 --> 56:47.760
said to soon be unlocking NES and SNES- Games?

56:47.760 --> 56:48.760
Game demos.

56:48.760 --> 56:49.760
Oh, demos.

56:49.760 --> 56:50.760
Just demos.

56:51.560 --> 56:55.560
The Wii U app that's apparently going to be available sometime in the first half of this

56:55.560 --> 56:59.560
year, which I imagine will be one of those surprise Nintendo Directs, will allow players

56:59.560 --> 57:04.920
to enjoy what they call highlighted scenes from certain games when you tap certain Amiibo

57:04.920 --> 57:06.920
to the game pad.

57:06.920 --> 57:10.880
These demo scenes will be constrained by a time limit, but other scenes will be available

57:10.880 --> 57:12.880
if you tap the Amiibo again.

57:12.880 --> 57:17.360
This was all in a presentation that Satoru Iwata gave in a presentation to Japanese investors,

57:17.360 --> 57:21.880
saying, quote, we hope that when you tap your Amiibo, the quickly changing game scenes will

57:21.880 --> 57:26.980
pleasantly surprise you and make you feel as though you have just changed a game cartridge.

57:26.980 --> 57:27.980
This sounds-

57:27.980 --> 57:28.980
Stupid.

57:28.980 --> 57:29.980
Yes.

57:29.980 --> 57:30.980
Incredibly.

57:30.980 --> 57:31.980
No.

57:31.980 --> 57:32.980
You're a hater.

57:32.980 --> 57:33.980
I'm not a hater.

57:33.980 --> 57:36.600
It sounds a little bit like the NES remix.

57:36.600 --> 57:37.600
A little bit.

57:37.600 --> 57:41.680
Like maybe an Amiibo would unlock a few stages in this NES remix style thing.

57:41.680 --> 57:42.680
I'm not a hater.

57:42.680 --> 57:43.680
That's what it sounds like.

57:43.680 --> 57:44.680
Here's my problem.

57:44.680 --> 57:45.680
Really?

57:45.680 --> 57:51.680
I sold goddamn Super Mario Brothers for the NES, okay, in digital form, and you're still

57:51.680 --> 57:55.040
fucking charging like $5 for that shit.

57:55.040 --> 57:56.040
Don't get me wrong.

57:56.040 --> 58:00.480
I think that game is deserving of $5, but you can't possibly, you know, give it away

58:00.480 --> 58:01.920
for free a little bit.

58:01.920 --> 58:08.680
I mean, you have all this digital stuff that is basically out there that they could be,

58:08.680 --> 58:10.440
you know, incentivizing people to buy.

58:10.440 --> 58:13.640
I guess they don't really need any incentive to buy Amiibos because people are just buying

58:13.640 --> 58:19.160
them for no apparent reason, but I just think unlocking demos is stupid.

58:19.160 --> 58:23.640
I mean, it's just, I don't know, it seems kind of pointless.

58:23.640 --> 58:26.720
It does seem a little cheap.

58:26.720 --> 58:31.400
Maybe if Animal Crossing never happened, and I didn't see that, oh, hey, cool, they had

58:31.400 --> 58:37.920
a game where I could, you know, unlock full NES games and play them, you know, if maybe

58:37.920 --> 58:41.920
if that didn't happen, it would feel so ripped off about it, but you know, the fact that

58:41.920 --> 58:46.200
they did that at one time kind of pisses me off that they're doing this now.

58:46.200 --> 58:50.200
Food for thought, Nintendo, if anybody happens to be out there listening and you're like,

58:50.200 --> 58:52.520
this guy, Loki, is a hater.

58:52.520 --> 58:53.520
Here's some food for thought.

58:53.520 --> 58:56.600
Honestly, what I think could maybe sway some people is that if you're going to do these

58:56.600 --> 59:00.520
demos or whatever, fine, but I cited NES Remix, right?

59:00.520 --> 59:06.020
And part of what made NES Remix really cool were those stages that brought something different

59:06.020 --> 59:07.720
to the classic games.

59:07.720 --> 59:13.640
For example, when you could play as Peach from Mario 2 in stages from Mario 3.

59:13.640 --> 59:19.760
If I could use my Peach amiibo to, like, unlock new experiences like that that are still classically

59:19.760 --> 59:22.140
inspired or whatever, that would be cool.

59:22.140 --> 59:25.680
Think like Sonic and Knuckles with NES games.

59:25.680 --> 59:26.960
Why not?

59:26.960 --> 59:29.000
Because I would take effort and they won't do it.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.860
And I tell you, that is exactly why.

59:30.860 --> 59:35.120
I hope you're wrong, sadly, I don't think you are.

59:35.120 --> 59:38.080
It's as minimal effort as possible.

59:38.080 --> 59:40.320
They're going to go to great lengths to build this app anyway.

59:40.320 --> 59:41.320
Why not?

59:41.320 --> 59:46.420
No, that's the thing, they're just doing that because I think it's to kind of combat the

59:46.420 --> 59:49.180
argument that these amiibos don't really do anything.

59:49.180 --> 59:50.180
And that's really what it is.

59:50.180 --> 59:56.880
It's like, well, see, now we can say that they unlock shit in Hyrule Warriors and it

59:56.880 --> 01:00:03.000
unlocks, you can play them in Mario Party 10 and you can use them in Smash and now they

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.840
unlock a demo instead of it just being for a handful of things.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:11.480
I think that's what it is because right now, things are really crazy with amiibos and people

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:13.440
are just wanting to snap them up.

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:16.480
But given a year, I think it's going to be less crazy.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:23.400
I think that if we see that they're not implementing the stuff in a reasonable way, like, and it's

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:26.440
like, okay, well, these are the only, there's only a handful of games that these are actually

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:31.040
going to work with, then I think people are going to stop, you know, snatch them up.

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:34.600
Granted, there are still going to be people that buy everything because there are people

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:37.440
like that in Skylanders and Disney Infinity, so I wouldn't doubt it.

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:41.040
Well, let me throw this out there too, because just a really quick follow up here, because

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:46.160
this is going to have an impact on this as well, and that is the fact that amiibo cards

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:47.880
are being talked about again.

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:52.080
And again, from this same, you know, financial briefing, Satoru Iwata was talking about how

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:56.640
well the amiibos are doing and so forth, or I'm sorry, the amiibo, I guess the plural

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.040
of amiibo is still amiibo.

01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:04.280
I keep wanting to say amiibai, but it's, the plural of amiibo is amiibo, but I have

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:06.480
to fight that urge to say amiibos.

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:12.040
But anyway, so Satoru Iwata says, in contrast to the current figure-shaped amiibo available,

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:18.120
we will make amiibo in the form of cards this year as one of our future plans, as Mr. Miyamoto

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:21.240
mentioned in the corporate management policy briefing in October.

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:24.640
So that is still something that's highly likely on the table as we get closer to the end of

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:25.640
the year.

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:29.880
And that probably answers how we're gonna be able to get Wii Fit Trainer now that all

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:31.760
those figures are long gone.

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:35.040
You know, we'll have the cards, you'll have a Wii Fit Trainer card.

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:39.920
I just, for me, again, it really depends on how those guys are priced.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:40.920
Exactly.

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:43.320
Oh hey, there's that card, it's $10.

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:46.560
I don't think, here's what I think will happen.

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:51.120
I don't think a singular card will be $10, but I think they're gonna sell them in packs

01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.120
of three.

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:53.120
Blind packs.

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:57.040
Oh, fuck you for saying that, blind packs.

01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.680
Oh, please no, no.

01:01:58.680 --> 01:01:59.680
Don't give them any ideas.

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:03.960
If Nintendo's listening, I want you to immediately delete the last 20 seconds of this show so

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.960
you never heard Loki say that.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:09.160
I wasn't thinking that, I was thinking like a pack of three.

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:15.520
Like here is series one amiibo cards, and you get three of them for $12, but it's what,

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:21.000
Wii Fit Trainer, who else was in that first series, Marth, and who else can't you get

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
anymore?

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.200
I know some amiibo fan in the chat is yelling it out, but whoever was in that series that's

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:28.480
really hard to get now, oh, Villager was in that series, right?

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:31.120
So those would be like the first set of cards.

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:33.400
I would think maybe it could be a thing.

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:39.440
So Black Wolf in chat says, edit it out, I just might, we'll just have the passphrase

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:40.440
there instead.

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.840
It'll be like, why did it jump from one thought to another?

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:48.200
It usually doesn't do that in the past, but no, I had to cut out what Loki said.

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:54.680
Of all the things I could have censored Loki on on this show over the past 13 years, it's

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:55.680
gonna be that.

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:56.680
It's gonna happen.

01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:57.680
It's gonna be that.

01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:58.680
And you know why it's gonna happen?

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:03.400
Because, you know, they've already done this kind of bullshit with the other type of, Disney

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:06.680
Infinity does this with their fucking power-ups, it's blind packs.

01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:10.120
So I wouldn't doubt, I wouldn't doubt that they would do that.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.020
How dare you?

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:14.640
Because they need to make money, and that's what it is.

01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:17.880
They're gonna make money because they're like, well, you could trade them with your friends!

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:18.880
It's social!

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:22.360
Trade them when they come over and play Mario Kart with you and sit on your couch!

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:25.480
Nobody interacts in person anymore.

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:33.520
But to be fair, Jamie, the Wii U is still the undisputed champion of living room play.

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:36.440
You know, like I had a friend over earlier today, we were having a great time playing

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:37.440
Mario Kart.

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:40.600
I didn't think of better stuff to do in the living room, no I'm kidding.

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:41.600
Anyway.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:42.600
Speaking of Jamie, let's-

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:46.140
It's never as much fun as watching you play ABBA.

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:47.140
Everything we'll ever talk-

01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:48.140
The ABBA game.

01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:49.140
You're watching ABBA You Can Dance.

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:50.140
Yeah, that was great.

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:51.140
Can I get an ABBA amiibo?

01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:55.060
Would it be, um, an ABBA meebo?

01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:56.060
ABBA meebo.

01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:57.060
ABBA meebo.

01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:58.060
A man can dream.

01:03:58.060 --> 01:03:59.740
I have a dream!

01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:13.260
This is the person that gave you Super

01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:17.300
It's like you put the card in another card, like in his sleeve, and I could have, like,

01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:19.300
my little ABBA meebo.

01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:21.240
ABBA meebo.

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.980
This is a thing now, the ABBA meebo.

01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:23.980
Okay.

01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:24.980
So-

01:04:24.980 --> 01:04:30.180
And then when I beat you in Smash Brothers, I can say, the winner takes it all!

01:04:30.180 --> 01:04:33.420
The loser's standing small.

01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:35.140
Loki looks like he's in pain over there.

01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:39.300
It's like, for some reason that singing gave me a headache, I still know.

01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:40.300
And now I have a migraine.

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:42.940
You know you have to get more frames now because you have two ABBA albums now.

01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:44.820
Maybe change the topic quick.

01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:45.820
Twitch!

01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:47.140
Wait, this is making me twitch.

01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:53.060
Yes, that song made me.

01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:56.540
So anyway, uh, Twitch has put out an announcement.

01:04:56.540 --> 01:04:57.820
They're gonna do TwitchCon.

01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:00.460
It's a fan festival type thing.

01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:06.280
Um, so yeah, Twitch is gonna be doing the first ever fan and content creator gathering

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:12.820
called TwitchCon, and, uh, the announcement came out on the 20th, but it's gonna be September

01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:18.580
25th through 26th in San Francisco at the place that I can never pronounce right, the

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:28.860
Moscone Center, um, where we, uh, it was right next door to where GamerX was last year.

01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:34.500
Um, so basically it's gonna be put together by Twitch and by, uh, ReadPop.

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:39.140
So it's gonna get basically broadcasters, fans together, you know, just have everyone

01:05:39.140 --> 01:05:42.100
come together and see what happens and play games.

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:44.140
Will the swap be attending as well?

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:45.260
What?

01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:50.420
I'm just wondering.

01:05:50.420 --> 01:05:56.360
So how do you feel about another convention?

01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:57.980
It's oddly quiet, isn't it?

01:05:57.980 --> 01:05:58.980
Tweet, tweet, tweet.

01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:01.820
Um, you know, it's a good idea.

01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:05.960
If it's probably gonna be, you know, prohibitive though with all the other shit I've got going

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:07.740
on this year.

01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:11.420
That's what a lot of people are saying is that it's like, oh yay, another convention

01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:15.500
on the calendar, you know, it's, it's like, we've got a lot of conventions throughout

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:16.500
the year.

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:19.060
It's also a little bit strange because, you know, I understand the, that YouTube does

01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:20.060
something similar.

01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:23.460
They have like kind of this, they have a ball pit, they don't have a ball pit, but they

01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:26.460
have like a kind of like a content creator gathering type thing.

01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:32.800
But Twitch to me doesn't seem like it's much of the same type of content you would see

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:38.260
on YouTube where it's more of like, you know, obviously it's live stuff and not so much

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:43.180
like, you know, shows or anything like, you're not going to have like, you know, TV show

01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:45.060
or, you know, web series or something like that.

01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:51.420
It's more of, you know, live playing or like let's plays or tournaments or something like

01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:52.420
that.

01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:56.700
So I don't know what they would be doing necessarily here, what you're going to go see there.

01:06:56.700 --> 01:07:01.140
Are you going to see tournaments, see people live streaming their games because that seems

01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:02.140
kind of boring.

01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:08.620
Well, I know one of Twitch's niches is the live, like sports style events like, you know,

01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:11.660
the League of Legends tournaments and the Starcraft tournaments and so forth.

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:15.980
I would think that they could probably get a lot of the big players and the E-leagues

01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:18.460
and so forth kind of together under one roof.

01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:22.020
I mean, it's not like there are already a lot of those events as well, but to have something

01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:25.900
that's kind of like sanctioned by Twitch that might, you know, be playing obviously and

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:29.060
highlighted on Twitch, I think could draw a lot of that content.

01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:33.180
And I kind of have a feeling that's what TwitchCon's big strength would be is that they'll probably

01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:36.380
get a lot of that, you know, major league gaming, esports.

01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:41.140
They're going to have a lot of that going on at the con, I would think.

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:47.100
Along with panels on, you know, how to be a better broadcaster and, you know, how to

01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:51.140
become a partner and how to make money, you know, all those other types of things.

01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:53.900
So, but again, there's just so many cons.

01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:58.140
You guys, like RuPaul just announced DragCon in May.

01:07:58.140 --> 01:07:59.820
How can I not want to go to that?

01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:01.820
Like I don't even dress up.

01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:03.820
I just, I just think they're bitchy fun.

01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:04.820
I love it.

01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:07.180
So I kind of want to go just to get sassed.

01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:08.180
But you know what?

01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:12.460
We kind of had that at GamerX anyway, especially since I just kept running into Queens at Sephora.

01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:17.580
Like the one I had to fight off for the, the green emerald Pantone eyelashes.

01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:22.340
Well, at least GX is a different time of year this year where there isn't a lot of cons.

01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:23.340
So I'm happy about that.

01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:24.340
It's like the first week of December, right?

01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:25.860
Yeah, it's right in December this time.

01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:26.860
Hallelujah.

01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:27.860
Yeah.

01:08:28.580 --> 01:08:29.580
Which is a true story.

01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:32.940
I did fight off a drag queen at a Sephora for Pantone emerald green eyelashes.

01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:38.700
YYR in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says if they host a whole bunch of tournaments,

01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:39.980
that could be a big draw.

01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:42.740
Admission will cost $80 and a pound of salt.

01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:45.660
Well, I could see them doing like, you know, that'd be kind of cool.

01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:50.740
Like more of like an X Games type thing, but you know, just like big old tournament thing.

01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:51.740
That'd be kind of cool.

01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:53.100
I can see that.

01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:55.500
At least it's just over the bridge in San Francisco.

01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.820
So I mean, it's kind of local for us.

01:08:57.820 --> 01:09:02.820
So Moscone Center is literally next door to where gamer X two was last year.

01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:07.900
And it's also across the street from the Metreon, which a lot of, you know, if you remember

01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:10.900
the PlayStation store in San Francisco, there's only sadness there now.

01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:11.900
Well, yeah.

01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:13.660
Now it's just a movie theater really and nothing else.

01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:14.660
Some eateries.

01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:19.700
But, uh, you know, back in the day that was like a big hub for Sony and DDR players definitely

01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:23.020
remember the arcade that used to be there, uh, was huge for some tournaments.

01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:26.780
So, you know, that little block right there in San Francisco is pretty awesome.

01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:29.500
Does it still have the walk of game down there?

01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:34.700
I think it does still exist, but like there's literally nothing else up there.

01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:39.700
So unless they, Oh, actually they might've turned that into the target now.

01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:40.700
That might be the target.

01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:42.020
It might be the walk of target.

01:09:42.020 --> 01:09:45.660
It might be like socks and underwear now.

01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:46.660
I don't know.

01:09:46.660 --> 01:09:47.660
That's disappointing.

01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:48.660
We'll see.

01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:56.540
To register participation for this week's episode of Warren Jones Radio at vognetwork.com,

01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:57.900
use the passphrase PINK.

01:09:57.900 --> 01:09:58.900
All right.

01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:01.180
Uh, moving on, uh, with some more news.

01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:02.180
Loki.

01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:03.180
All right.

01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:07.380
So don't call it a comeback, but, uh, there's going to be some more rock band DLC coming

01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:08.380
out.

01:10:08.380 --> 01:10:09.380
That's right.

01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:11.380
They're, they're coming back.

01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:16.660
They're saying on February, uh, well, on February 17th, they released, was it Back to the Shack

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:23.340
from Weezer, Rise of the Phoenix from Tenacious D. Um, each of those will be sold for $1.99.

01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:26.060
And apparently they're still working on some more stuff.

01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:31.940
Um, they're even saying that, um, you know, they may have some more stuff to reveal soon.

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:33.180
What does this all mean though?

01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:34.180
What does this all mean?

01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:38.540
Gee, what could those song titles, could those song titles be implying anything Rise of the

01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:46.620
Phoenix really like, can we please get Elton John's The Bitches Back in like a month?

01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:52.340
Basically, you know, according to an unnamed source, cause you know, that's always good,

01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:56.180
is that they're working on another rock band game that's going to be coming out for PlayStation

01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:59.020
4 and Xbox One.

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:03.860
Um, could this be announced at PAX East?

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:07.340
I'll feel a lot better about having to spend the money to go out there if that's the case.

01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:08.340
It's quite possible.

01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:10.940
I think one of the, the, where is, where is harmonics?

01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:11.940
Boston.

01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:17.180
Well, one of the, um, the hints also was they showed all the different pins that you can

01:11:17.180 --> 01:11:21.780
collect, but the harmonics one had a big question mark on it, cause they're not showing what

01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:22.780
it is yet.

01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:23.780
Oh, okay.

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:29.900
Uh, it would make sense that they would reveal that there, um, I think that's cool.

01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:34.900
I hope they put it out, but I also hope that my instruments work with it because I have

01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:36.540
them all on Xbox 360.

01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:38.560
A converter would be nice.

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:39.560
That would be nice.

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:45.280
I mean, I have got like, um, I've got my converter thing for my controllers to use Xbox 360 controllers

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:50.840
on it, but I've, yeah, I hope that there's some sort of way to use that cause I don't

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:51.840
want to have to buy.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:55.960
I'm, well, I, I'm telling you this much, I'm not going to buy new instruments for when

01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:56.960
it comes out.

01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:00.280
Can we get a new DJ Harrow please too?

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:01.280
That I would buy.

01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:02.280
Talk to the other company about that.

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:03.280
I know.

01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:04.280
I know.

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:08.640
I would pay money though for that and kind of have to make my own if I don't, you know,

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:09.640
get one soon.

01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:10.640
All right.

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:14.120
Uh, well I, I, I hope that, uh, it does happen.

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:16.840
I'd love to see it at PAX East except I know I'll never get to play it cause it's going

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:20.480
to be the world's worst line, uh, to get in and play that game.

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:22.000
But at least hopefully I'll get to see it.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Nothing else.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.840
I mean, Rock Band's got a formula, they don't really have to break it.

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:29.160
I'd be curious to see what they do with it.

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:33.100
What, what the new systems can bring to that.

01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:34.760
Excellent point from Black Wolf in the chat room.

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:35.760
So excellent.

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:37.880
I want stage kit compatibility.

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:39.120
Yes, please.

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:42.560
Hey, I, I wonder if you can still get those.

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:43.560
That'd be pretty awesome.

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:45.360
Maybe you can get them discount or something.

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:51.600
Um, knowing that there's a big social element in gaming now that wasn't there a few years

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:56.200
ago and I'm talking about Twitch basically and um, you know, the fact that people stream

01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:57.480
live and so forth.

01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:03.200
I wonder if there's going to be some type of connected living room experience through

01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:09.120
like streaming a video or something where you can now be in a band with somebody that

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:13.120
lives, you know, in another house basically.

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:17.920
Like I noticed that a grandpa from Hoard House just joined our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:23.680
So I could play keyboards in my house and grandpa could sing over in his house.

01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:27.960
You know, he could sing a, you know, a journey song, whatever, any way you want it.

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:29.480
That's the way you need it.

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:30.960
Like he, you know, right.

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:32.760
And then we could actually see each other while we're playing.

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:37.080
That would be kind of cool because I seem to recall in the three 61 you wouldn't get

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:41.000
to hear the other person because of the delay, which makes sense.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.660
And to be fair, that delay is still going to be there, but maybe they'll do something

01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:48.960
where like after you do the song, you can watch a performance that like puts all you

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:50.960
guys together or something like there's something they could do.

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:56.400
I'm sure it would be actually sort of interesting is if they had something that worked with

01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:02.200
like, you know, your cameras or whatever that you, uh, it compiles into like one of those

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:04.160
YouTube esque, you know, multi-panel videos.

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:05.160
Yeah.

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:06.160
Yeah.

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:07.160
That would be actually be kind of funny.

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:08.160
That would be kind of cool.

01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:09.160
I bet.

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:10.160
I wouldn't watch myself.

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:11.160
I bet.

01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:13.040
That's what maybe the ultimate thing would be is that you could create like a music video

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:16.560
from all four different places or something like it would film all people and like put

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.560
it all together.

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:18.560
That would be pretty cool.

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:19.560
That would be pretty cool.

01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:24.640
Not even necessarily for if you've got like a harmonizing with the two mics, which they

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:25.640
have like a Beatles rock band.

01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:29.440
I'm going to make it a point this week to play DJ hero.

01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:30.440
That's like, that's a good goal.

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:31.440
That's a good goal.

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:32.680
All right.

01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:38.480
Um, so, uh, earlier this week on, um, you know, we, we have an interesting relationship

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:41.880
with this particular site, but it's being reported around the internet and it's a story

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:47.320
that Kotaku ran, uh, where they interviewed the legend of Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma,

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:52.080
uh, who was talking a lot about, you know, the Zelda and what to expect in the new Zelda

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:53.360
and so forth.

01:14:53.360 --> 01:15:01.400
But, um, uh, he was also talking about Tingle and, uh, some of the, um, lore and things

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:04.040
behind Tingle, one of Loki's very favorite characters.

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:05.040
Oh yeah.

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:08.560
So what he said about Tingle, I guess the heart of the character, there's a little bit

01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:10.240
of a gag kind of feeling to it.

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:14.360
The way the design of the character started is that we needed to think about how the character

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:17.040
at the player would get access to maps in this game.

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:20.400
Of course you could go with a situation where as soon as he sees an area, you just open

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:23.480
up your map and it fills in for you, but we wanted to do something a little different.

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:25.260
So we thought, what if you had to buy maps?

01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:27.720
Then suddenly we needed a character that you would buy maps from.

01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:30.360
We ultimately ended up with a character here that had a little bit of humor to him that

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:34.320
came from thinking of what sort of person would sell a map and well, we decided it would

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:37.320
be the kind of person who makes the map.

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:40.360
And the way he makes the map is by floating through the air so that he can see the contours

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:41.500
of the land and draw them.

01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:44.520
But as soon as we get that far in the process, we realized anybody that would fly through

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:47.300
the air making a map, it's got to be a really weird person.

01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:52.340
So at that point we decided, okay, we'll go with this and make him a really weird guy.

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:55.300
So when we made this character, we had this notion that one of the ways he might be a

01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:58.900
little bit weird is that he had this notion that he never wanted to grow up.

01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:02.540
And so I think to that extent, the clothes do fit this image of him and the whole thing

01:16:02.540 --> 01:16:05.180
comes together as a very Peter Pan kind of visual.

01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:08.500
You know, if you think about it, it's this guy in his thirties in a green suit and is

01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:10.680
flying and never wants to grow up.

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:13.220
It all sort of comes together around that.

01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:19.840
And then the ever classy Kotaku asked, so is Tingle gay basically?

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:22.860
And Anuma replied to that and said, he's not gay.

01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:25.020
He's just an odd person.

01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:29.480
And I don't, I kind of feel like that question was unnecessary.

01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:31.280
It really was like, why, why does it matter?

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:34.000
But I also, that's kind of where I'm at.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Like who cares?

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000
It's a video game character.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.380
They don't think of, okay, what kind of sexuality is this video game character going to have?

01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:48.640
But I also understand that in some ways Tingle has become a bit of a gay icon and sometimes

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:49.640
that happens.

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:54.400
Like I seem to recall gaygamer.net did like a little feature that was bestowing some type

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:56.480
of like character of the year award.

01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:57.480
I don't know.

01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:00.180
I don't, I sorry, I don't remember the exact title they bestowed on him, but it was some

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:01.680
type of like honor.

01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:08.600
So I don't know, like, but so part of me says, okay, well I guess, I guess the fans have

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:14.160
kind of painted this image or whatever of, of Tingle and, and, you know, it held him

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:17.440
up in this regard or whatever, but I still kind of feel like, well then why do you want

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:22.780
to poke a hole in that question by saying, you know, so tell me yes or no, is he gay?

01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:27.300
And I kind of wish Enuma had just said, I don't really have an answer for that.

01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:33.000
Or just said, we haven't really explored that part of the character or it's a video game

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.620
and we don't plan on putting Tingle in a relationship anytime soon.

01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:38.660
So go with that what you will.

01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:40.980
How about what the fuck does it matter?

01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:42.040
Or something like that.

01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:43.860
So it really doesn't matter.

01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:48.780
But I'm not going to blame Enuma for that because I also realized the culture in Japan

01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:50.860
is very different from the culture here.

01:17:50.860 --> 01:17:53.780
And he probably didn't know what the fuck to say, honestly.

01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:54.780
Well that's a stupid question.

01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:55.780
I don't blame him.

01:17:55.780 --> 01:17:56.780
It's, it's.

01:17:56.780 --> 01:17:57.780
Yeah.

01:17:57.780 --> 01:17:58.780
It's dumb.

01:17:58.780 --> 01:17:59.780
It's just a video game.

01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:00.780
It was just.

01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:04.580
It's not a video game that requires him to have sexual relations with other characters.

01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:08.780
Why do people have to keep fucking stuff up with doing it?

01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:14.220
But I could see, I want to be fair and I can see the flip side to it of, again, he was

01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:16.380
a gay icon or whatever.

01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:22.460
But I kind of also look at that and go, well, ABBA was a gay icon in many ways because of,

01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:27.220
you know, they made these, these outfits out of nothing that were, you know, hilarious

01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:29.440
and their songs were fun and so forth.

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:35.620
But ABBA was, there's, there's like the actual term of homosexuality.

01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:37.940
There's nothing homosexual about ABBA.

01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:44.120
In fact, they were quite the incestuous little group where they were married in straight

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:45.160
relationships.

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:49.400
One guy was married to one girl and then they divorced and married the other girl.

01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:52.100
Each guy married, like, so ABBA was kind of crazy like that.

01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:57.680
But my point is, is that gay icons don't always necessarily mean gay people.

01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:00.560
Does that make sense?

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:03.760
Well, well, what was the deal with Donna Summer for the longest time?

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:06.040
She actually was relatively homophobic.

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:11.720
Yes, I think she did come around in the end, but it was a little bit of that whole mixed

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:16.280
message where, you know, the church was telling her one thing, you know, and that whole, that

01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:17.800
whole situation was going on.

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:20.840
So, uh, and Dungeon Buster in chat says, I agree with Sky.

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:23.440
I think Anuma was just caught completely off guard.

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:25.240
No one expects the Kotaku Inquisition.

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:31.000
I just, I just kind of like, why did that have to be a question?

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:35.520
It would make for a headline for them if they're like, confirm Tingle is gay.

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:36.520
You know what I mean?

01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:38.080
That's why they asked that stupid thing.

01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:39.080
Anyway.

01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:40.080
All right.

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:41.080
So there it is.

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:42.880
That's, uh, that's some news that's been going around this week.

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:43.880
Let's move on.

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:48.200
Um, uh, and so it looks like Steve has an early class tomorrow.

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.200
Oh, makes sense.

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:50.200
Yeah.

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:51.520
So one more plug for Flom.

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:52.520
Check out Flom.

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:53.520
Yes.

01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:54.520
Go please everybody.

01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:59.320
I will give two people $3 to go buy the game.

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:00.720
I will gift it to a couple of you.

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:03.240
How can they sign up for free money, DarkSakura?

01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:04.240
I will.

01:20:04.240 --> 01:20:06.880
How will you know that they bought the game and not a taco?

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:08.920
Send me your Apple ID and I will gift you the game.

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:09.920
Only two people though.

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:10.920
Only two people.

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:11.920
All right.

01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:14.080
Anyway, uh, let's move on.

01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:16.080
Uh, DarkSakura, you have a story for us.

01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:17.660
This game is pretty freaking cool.

01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:19.840
It's called Killer Queen.

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:24.560
It is the world's first 10 player arcade strategy game.

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:29.880
It wasn't released for iOS or Android or any home handheld thing.

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:30.880
It's not a computer game.

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:37.040
It is a full fledged fucking arcade game and it's 10 players and you can only find it in

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:39.880
five places in the country.

01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:43.200
So well, I guess technically that would be in the world as well.

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:52.720
Um, but it was put out by two people, Nikita Mikros and Joshua Debonis.

01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:55.080
And it's just really weird.

01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:58.180
You don't have to play it one different, one way.

01:20:58.180 --> 01:21:00.960
You can beat it several different ways.

01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:03.520
You have five players, so it's five against five.

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:08.400
You have to have, they say that you need to have at least, you know, four on a team to

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:12.680
make it really worthwhile or three on a team.

01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:14.800
But you can beat Killer Queen different ways.

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:17.580
You can collect berries and take them back to your base.

01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:20.280
You can ride a snail toward your goal.

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:21.280
Yuck.

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:22.280
Snails are disgusting.

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:31.880
Um, you basically, you just have to make, you just have to win by any means necessary.

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:35.120
You know, hopefully by confounding the other people.

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:41.480
But each team has four grunts and a queen and you can also win by the way, by killing

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:42.840
the queen three times.

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:46.660
The enemy's queen, but the queen has wings and she gets to sort of spout around like

01:21:46.660 --> 01:21:51.120
she's in joust and the grunts though have to run around on the ground until they level

01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:52.920
up and get more capabilities.

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:56.940
Um, so they have to keep bringing more berries to your team.

01:21:56.940 --> 01:22:04.520
So it's sort of like capture the flag, quit it, kill bees, the game.

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:06.440
And in our chat room, it's just so bizarre.

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:10.760
In our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, SSG100Matt says, played this at MagFest and

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:12.560
it's amazing.

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:20.560
See, I want, okay, I want more people to play this game and then like send us pictures of

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:21.560
them playing it.

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:22.760
So you have to find them.

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:31.440
If you find the killer queen and take a picture of it, I will buy you a copy of Flom.

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:32.440
That's only two people though.

01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:33.440
Only two people.

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:34.440
Max two people.

01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:35.440
Max two.

01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:36.440
All right.

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:41.240
So, uh, yeah, I, I'm excited to hear though that there's like an actual like arcade experience

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:42.240
going on with this.

01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:43.560
That's, uh, that's always nice to know.

01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:48.120
Well, the places that you can find it, um, there is one at Logan arcade in Chicago.

01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:54.120
Um, there's also one in Portland at, uh, ground control.

01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:55.680
Oh, that place.

01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:57.960
That's like the retro arcade, if I'm not mistaken.

01:22:57.960 --> 01:22:58.960
I went there once.

01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:04.920
There's a league night at that location, I believe that they say there's also in California

01:23:04.920 --> 01:23:05.920
anywhere.

01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:07.400
LA San Francisco.

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:11.920
I just saw the two in there, but you know, I'll go hunting around and see if there are

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:12.920
any other locations.

01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:13.920
All right.

01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:19.840
Um, yeah, they are just, it's really pretty too on top of that, just really kind of cute

01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:21.480
and pixely in an old school way.

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:22.480
All right.

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:25.720
We're going to travel around the world now and check out some release dates and see what

01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:28.120
games are coming to a store near you.

01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:32.080
Uh, you can find killer queen in an arcade, uh, or a few of them anyway, but you can find

01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:36.040
these games on shelves this week around the world, uh, starting in the U S Loki.

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:37.040
Yes.

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:41.720
So this week, uh, you can pick up dragon ball, Xenoverse, which is going to be coming out

01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:48.320
on PlayStation three, Xbox three 60, Xbox one and PlayStation four.

01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:58.600
Also under night in birth exe late, which is by axis for, um, the PlayStation three.

01:23:58.600 --> 01:23:59.600
And let's see what else?

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:00.600
Nice.

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:06.840
He wears eight empires on PlayStation four and Xbox one, uh, rugby 15 for PlayStation

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:14.160
three, PlayStation four and Xbox one, uh, hyper devotion, noir goddess, black heart

01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:16.680
for Vita.

01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:18.400
And let's see what else here.

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:21.920
Uh, that might actually be it.

01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:25.520
Uh, let's see here.

01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:26.520
Last call.

01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:28.520
Dragon balls.

01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:29.520
Xenoverse is also on PC.

01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:30.520
Apparently that's it.

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:31.520
Here it is.

01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:34.440
Uh, going over to Japan and checking out the releases there on the PlayStation four this

01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:35.440
week.

01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:42.220
Dragon quest heroes on route to, uh, Sakaiju no jewel comes out this week from Squeenix.

01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:44.720
It's a dragon quest heroes game on the PlayStation four.

01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:46.520
So I've had a lot of people looking forward to that.

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:48.760
Uh, I can't say I blame you for that one.

01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:55.240
Uh, on the Xbox one, um, really nothing in Japan this week, but, uh, I imagine the Xbox

01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:58.080
one, unfortunately for them, hasn't been gaining a lot of steam over there, so there's probably

01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:03.080
not a lot of games there, but dragon quest heroes is also on the PlayStation three this

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:04.080
week.

01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:05.080
So you can check that out.

01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:08.000
Uh, as I mentioned previously on the show, there's really nothing on the Wii U until

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.400
March over in Japan.

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:15.420
Uh, so checking out the PlayStation Vita PlayStation Vita has captain earth mind labyrinth this

01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:22.360
week, as well as Diabloic lovers, dark fate and Osmophia vivace comes out this week and

01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:26.560
the game called parfait comes out, uh, on the Vita as well.

01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:27.760
This is about butter.

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:29.400
Uh, what is parfait about?

01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:31.240
It's regular and limited edition.

01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:34.520
It's parfait you were thinking of.

01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:35.520
Is it about yogurt?

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:38.120
No, it's about girl, girls and maid outfits.

01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:44.600
Um, are they making, it might be, it might be a visual novel of a somewhat adult nature

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:50.880
because I'm noticing in this picture, she's not wearing pants, so she is, she's just putting

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:55.680
them on, caught her only in America.

01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:59.680
Do we refer to as trousers as pants in other countries?

01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:00.680
Pants are your underwear?

01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:01.680
And she was wearing them.

01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:02.680
Well, okay.

01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:05.360
But technically it was a skirt.

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:06.360
Wow.

01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:09.600
And this is just a straight up upskirt shot right here that we've got on this.

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:11.400
So, um, wow.

01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:15.840
I can't believe it's not butter.

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:20.640
I don't know what else to say about parfait, uh, but Hey, how about the Nintendo three

01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:25.160
DS because on the Nintendo three DS this week, there's Dora Moji and Nobita no Kanji

01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:31.600
Daisak Suen comes out this week and Kinero no Korda three full voice special comes out

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:35.520
in a regular edition and a treasure box edition.

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:41.960
And this looks like yet another visual novel on the three DS, but this one's like music

01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:47.200
and this guy's a doctor and he forgot his shirt in the shower in this picture.

01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:50.120
So you wear your shirt in the shower, Rob?

01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:55.040
I suppose not, but I do find this a bit of a gratuitous picture here.

01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:57.160
It's not so much the fact that he's in the shower.

01:26:57.160 --> 01:27:01.200
It's the look that's on his face of the, ah, well, you would look like that too.

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:02.960
We don't see what his other hand is doing.

01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:03.960
Yeah.

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:10.120
Maybe if my other hand wasn't visible.

01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:11.120
There you go.

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:12.120
Those are us.

01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:16.940
What you have to look forward to in Japan this week, um, sinning dark Sakura.

01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:18.680
How about the UK?

01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:20.800
In the UK we have some stuff.

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:27.200
On the 24th there is, there came an echo on PC and on the 25th a good snowman is hard

01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:36.160
to build for Mac PC homeworld remastered collection for PC odd world, new and tasty for Mac PC.

01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:40.480
And then on everything else, resident evil revelations too.

01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:43.320
And seriously, it is on just about everything else.

01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:51.000
On the 27th Dragon Ball Xenoverse, um, also Dying Light on a few things, Dynasty Warriors

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.280
Eight Empires, uh, Pneuma, Breath of Life, and Trains, a new era.

01:27:56.280 --> 01:28:01.640
As long as it's not the banned train, I'm happy and that's it.

01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:02.640
All right.

01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:06.080
Just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week.

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:07.080
Loki.

01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:10.560
So I think this was mentioned a while back and I want to, I can't remember if they said

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:15.720
this in actual, in their press conferences or whatever, but it was that originally the

01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:19.800
Xbox ones are going to become dev kits at some point.

01:28:19.800 --> 01:28:23.320
Like they're going to allow people to be able to develop games using that instead of an

01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:24.320
actual dev kit.

01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:27.360
That way it'll open the market up a little bit more to any developers.

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:34.220
Well, apparently the rumor is now that developers, um, will be able to use the Xbox ones as dev

01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:36.920
kits later this year in an update.

01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:40.360
They're saying that, you know, developers will also be able to use beta apps to test

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:45.080
them with community apps will finally be able to run in the background, allowing third party

01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:50.720
music apps to continue outputting music while a game is playing, um, stuff like that.

01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:52.840
So that's pretty cool.

01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:55.580
I hope that actually ends up being true.

01:28:55.580 --> 01:29:04.720
And apparently the announcement may, um, be made in April during their build conference.

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:05.720
I don't know.

01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:06.720
I'm looking forward to it.

01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:07.720
Thanks again.

01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:08.720
Xbox one, I guess.

01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:11.120
Couldn't that be an announcement for game developers conference, which is coming up

01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:12.120
as well.

01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:14.120
I mean, I know there's been a lot of talk about PAX East, but let's not forget game

01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:15.720
developers conference is happening.

01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:20.660
And although we don't usually get E3 style announcements at GDC, uh, we did get things

01:29:20.660 --> 01:29:23.440
like the PlayStation move was unveiled at GDC.

01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:27.600
So sometimes things that will impact, uh, gaming development, I would expect that we

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:31.320
might find a little more out about project Morpheus at GDC.

01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:34.360
Not necessarily like, you know, a day and date type of thing, but maybe like an update

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:39.280
on what development is available for something like that, since it seems like VR is a huge

01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:40.440
direction for the industry.

01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:41.440
Yeah.

01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:45.080
The theory is that they're going to be publishing like a software development kit preview, I

01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:50.140
guess in may, that's going to switch those dev to retails to, um, dev kits.

01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:54.120
So I will have to see, but I think the build conference that they're talking about is Microsoft

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:59.800
actually has one for developing on, you know, um, all their windows platforms.

01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:04.000
And a lot of these have to do with kind of universal apps that they're going to meld

01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:07.040
together with, you know, all their windows 10 platforms.

01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:11.320
Uh, now Bobby who follows a lot of the development community, Bobby Black Wolf says, actual developers

01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:13.680
are already using retail Xbox ones as dev kits.

01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:16.160
This is about extending that to the general public.

01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:20.200
So maybe that's why you're like, I thought this was familiar, uh, also Bobby saying and,

01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:23.160
and confirming in some ways what I was just saying, there was a four hour presentation

01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:25.320
about project Morpheus at GDC.

01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:26.680
Not surprised to hear that at all.

01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:31.240
And I didn't know that I didn't look, you know, I'm, I don't go to GDC, although funny

01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:35.920
enough, because of the way my flight to PAX East is, I'm probably going to San Francisco

01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:39.360
to see people that are going to GDC and like go to dinner one night.

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:42.600
And then I'm flying to PAX East the next day while GDC is still going on.

01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:46.400
So it's just the way things work out in this crazy world.

01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:49.960
So anyway, uh, let's move on.

01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:53.320
We're almost to the classic game of the week, but I want to talk about new games for a minute

01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:54.320
here.

01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:56.080
And this isn't so much as a story as it is.

01:30:56.080 --> 01:31:00.760
I just wanted to bring up this topic because it's been a lot of discussion this week, and

01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:07.080
that is the reception to a pretty high, excuse me, I'm so nervous, I'm burping.

01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:12.720
It's the release to a pretty high profile PlayStation four game that came out this week.

01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:14.920
And that is of course the order.

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:17.880
And you know, I don't know how much stock you guys put in Metacritic.

01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:23.600
I think a lot of big outlets are starting to really walk away from scoring and the way

01:31:23.600 --> 01:31:27.320
that their reviews kind of impact Metacritic, because I know Joystiq did that right before

01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:28.320
they closed.

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:33.240
I think I saw Eurogamer just recently had walked away from giving games a score now.

01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:37.500
So you know, I think some places are starting to reject this Metacritic thing a little bit,

01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:42.800
but any way you slice it, the order is sitting at a 65 right now on Metacritic.

01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:47.960
And a lot of people are saying it's kind of a, although it's a very pretty experience,

01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:49.760
it's a very pretty looking game.

01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:57.760
It's a bit of a hollow experience and a lot of attention being called to the play length

01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:03.420
of the game, which is depending on who you're asking, anywhere from five to eight hours

01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:07.080
about is how long it's going to take you to play the order from start to finish.

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:11.200
Now full disclaimer, I haven't played this game myself yet.

01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:17.240
I can really only state these opinions based off of what I've heard other people saying

01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:18.900
about the game.

01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:21.920
And I believe Loki and Dark Soccer are in the same boat where they haven't played this

01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:22.920
game themselves yet.

01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:23.920
I have no interest to play that game.

01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:24.920
I mean, it looks okay.

01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:27.000
It's just, it's not my...

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:31.480
I wasn't really looking forward to like a third person cover based shooter type game.

01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:32.960
I have other stuff I'm doing.

01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:33.960
Yeah.

01:32:33.960 --> 01:32:36.160
And that's kind of my thing too, is I was like, all right, even though the game looks

01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:40.800
very pretty, I wasn't really interested in the game to begin with as much as I am some

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:41.800
other titles.

01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:44.080
If I was going to spend $60 in games, there's a bunch of stuff on sale right now that I

01:32:44.080 --> 01:32:47.640
could be picking up, but I didn't want to buy any more games that I'm not going to play

01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:51.760
yet because I still haven't touched Watch Dogs or Destiny yet.

01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:54.000
Or Battlefield 4 because I picked that up as well.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.720
So I haven't picked it, played any of that.

01:32:55.720 --> 01:33:02.000
So let me ask this because a lot of people are saying that if you're going to pay $60

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.960
on a game, it ought to be more than five to eight hours in length.

01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:11.480
So and even there's some question out there and I saw some tweets going around and one

01:33:11.480 --> 01:33:14.120
tweet I remember seeing that came through on my feed and I don't remember who wrote

01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:18.780
it because it was somebody retweeted or something, but it said something about if you're factoring

01:33:18.780 --> 01:33:23.280
a game's length into the review, you're doing it wrong or something like that.

01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:25.360
And I was kind of like, well, wait a minute.

01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:27.480
I'm not so sure I agree with that.

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:35.360
I think the value is important, but at the same time, and I want to make this very clear,

01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:41.600
I don't think the order, you know, I think the order is just one particular game.

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:46.360
I don't think that means all games that are only five to eight hours in length that are

01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:49.440
$60 are bad just because of their length.

01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:53.080
I think it just really depends on the quality of what is filling that time.

01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:55.640
It's not necessarily the game's five hours.

01:33:55.640 --> 01:33:57.520
It's how much replayability is there?

01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:59.240
Because it could be five hours long.

01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:03.360
But if I can replay it multiple times and get enjoyment out of playing that over and over

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:05.000
again, then that sounds good.

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.840
But the problem is it sounds like it's a lot of cut scenes that are kind of, you know,

01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:12.200
extending the gameplay time a bit.

01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:15.720
So I don't really know how much enjoyment I would really get out of it unless it's a

01:34:15.720 --> 01:34:17.240
really, really good story.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:21.600
I just don't know if that's the case.

01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:26.560
I mean, it could be a pretty looking game, but once again, that doesn't necessarily, you

01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:28.680
know, there's a lot of games that look good.

01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:30.120
Grand Theft Auto five looks good.

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:32.360
There's hundreds of hours of gameplay there.

01:34:33.480 --> 01:34:34.800
Skyrim looks good.

01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:36.240
And that's a really long game.

01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:41.720
Or even if you want to talk short games, Journey looks nice.

01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:47.640
It's not necessarily, you know, really cinematic or not to like film quality cinematic, but

01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:52.480
it's still a fun game and it's short, but you get a lot of replayability out of it.

01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:55.960
I'm going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:34:55.960 --> 01:35:00.680
Alan Alchemy says, so Parasite Eve length, which is a fucking amazing game.

01:35:01.240 --> 01:35:02.040
Was it that short?

01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:02.920
I don't even remember.

01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:06.280
I mean, I played Parasite Eve all the way through, but I think Parasite Eve was a shorter

01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:06.600
game.

01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:11.360
So it wasn't like a lot of people because it came out in that same kind of era as Final Fantasy

01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:11.960
seven and eight.

01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:14.840
People think it was a lot longer because those games are longer, but I don't think I don't

01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:15.280
think it was.

01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:20.920
You know, the Resident Evil games weren't very long because I could sit and beat two.

01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:24.080
And we were paying forty, fifty dollars for those games and you didn't hear all this

01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:24.480
complaining.

01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:28.400
My complaint, you know, I was complaining, though, back when they put out, was it that

01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:30.360
Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes thing?

01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:34.880
And that was only like a few hours long and it was half the price and I was still seeing

01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:35.640
that was a rip off.

01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:38.560
So why would I change my mind on some?

01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:44.440
And you can't argue that, you know, Metal Gear Solid five, Ground Zeroes is a cinematic

01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:45.920
game, it is.

01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:49.840
And so I think there's more replayability on that, though, than there is on this, because

01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:52.960
this sounds very linear, whereas that's kind of more open world.

01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:57.840
Alan Alchemy further asks, should a game like Skyrim or Dragon Age Inquisition cost three

01:35:57.840 --> 01:35:59.040
hundred and fifty dollars then?

01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:01.200
No, I think what's happening is the other way around.

01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:06.000
I think because Skyrim and Dragon Age Inquisition are also sixty dollar games, people go, well,

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:07.600
those games are hundreds and hundreds of hours.

01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:09.880
But then, you know, the order is over in eight hours.

01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:11.600
The order should be twenty bucks.

01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:15.320
And that's that's even unrealistic as far as, you know, not all games are going to be

01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:17.160
hundred hour epic and they really shouldn't be.

01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:22.320
But I'm saying, though, let's let's take like, for example, Resistance, Fallen Man or

01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:24.440
something like that, a game that's kind of linear.

01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:26.120
It's got a single player campaign to it.

01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:29.560
And I enjoyed the campaign and I think it was worth sixty dollars.

01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:32.720
And there's a little bit of replayability there because you can play it again and get

01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:33.720
more weapons and something like that.

01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:34.920
And there's multiplayer.

01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:36.000
So there's that on top of it.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:40.200
So that overall makes it like kind of a well-rounded experience, whereas this is just

01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:43.480
like a really short, linear game with no multiplayer in it.

01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:48.320
Like, I can understand if it had like multiplayer aspect to it, it might be a little

01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:51.480
bit it might be worth a little bit more, but it doesn't even have it.

01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:56.360
It's like and just the excuses, like the whole development process, like their excuses

01:36:56.360 --> 01:37:01.160
were, well, we don't want to be 60 frames per second because it's not as cinematic as

01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:04.520
30 frames per second, which really was just because they wanted to push higher fidelity

01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:09.280
and they couldn't do that with, you know, a higher frame rate or oh, well, you know,

01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:12.840
it's short because it's this, you know, and they're making excuses.

01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:14.320
And it's just I don't like it.

01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:19.160
And especially, which I'm assuming this thing has a season pass because goddamn, all

01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:21.720
games nowadays seem to have season passes with DLC.

01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:26.320
I want to see what they put out for DLC, because, you know, if that's stuff that could

01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:30.720
have easily been, why don't you just how about just wait until the, you know, whatever

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:34.000
complete edition comes out or something like that, that might be a little bit more

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:38.200
worth it. And if it is terrible, I think some people are worried that the order may

01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:43.000
have DLC and that and I can actually I can kind of get where some of that might be a

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:46.360
little bit justified. Like if this DLC comes out and then they're asking even more

01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:49.800
money for it, where some people are going to get like really irritated with that.

01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:53.720
I mean, at least Parasite Eve never tried to sell DLC on top of it type of thing.

01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:56.760
Right. But anyway, there's a lot of great comments in our chat room here.

01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:00.520
I want to make sure I get through some of these over in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:05.560
The SAG is there saying for a buyer's review, cost versus gameplay length needs to be

01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:10.680
noted. Academic criticism not relevant, which isn't to say it's the factor, but just

01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:11.400
something to know.

01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:13.400
You know, I think I agree with that.

01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:19.840
You know, I remember it was an EGM or games, I think it was EGM that used to do that

01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:24.560
where they would have kind of a review in there, like a little chart almost showing

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:26.120
replayability over time.

01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:26.680
Yeah, yeah.

01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:28.080
And I love that.

01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:29.080
I think that's a great idea.

01:38:29.080 --> 01:38:30.720
And this kind of would fall into it.

01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:35.120
It's like if this game has a ton of replayability to it, then by all means, a five hour

01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:37.440
time frame on it doesn't mean really much of anything.

01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:41.480
It's just, you know, I mean, like a lot of arcade games were short.

01:38:41.560 --> 01:38:43.520
Right. Let me get through some more of these comments.

01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:44.280
There's so many good ones.

01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:48.960
acteft in live.vognetwork.com says portal one is an hour short and who doesn't love

01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:51.880
portal one? Well, maybe once you know how to do it, portal one's an hour.

01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:57.640
But still, I would say portal two was maybe a maybe a five hour game.

01:38:57.640 --> 01:39:00.480
Right. And it was full, it's been so long since I played it.

01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:04.200
Then again, it did have the multiplayer element to it, but it still was a shorter

01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:07.560
game. And I didn't see people complaining about, you know, the length of that.

01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:11.200
But then again, it's also something that now with, you know, the level letters and

01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:13.080
stuff, the replayability is huge.

01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:14.480
Let me get through some more comments.

01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:20.040
Let's see over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster is pointing out that the $40

01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:21.920
for the orange box went towards the entire package.

01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:22.920
Let's not forget portal one.

01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:25.160
They weren't selling for $60 by itself.

01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:28.560
The orange box is one of the greatest gaming values they've ever released.

01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:32.040
Kaijuto says you're paying for the experience, not the game time.

01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:35.520
That's like saying shorter movies should cost less than longer movies.

01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:39.720
Can we, hold on, if you want to pay less for a shorter game, just rent it like people

01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:41.040
have been doing for years.

01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:44.640
Can we get a remastered version of the orange box on these consoles?

01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:46.280
I buy that again.

01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:52.120
And you know, the movie is a good comparison because honestly, people will buy a Disney

01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:53.880
movie that's 90 minutes long.

01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:59.640
They'll buy a $29 Blu-ray of The Lion King and not even give it a second thought.

01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:00.960
And it's like a 90 minute movie.

01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:05.480
But a movie like that, you can watch over and over and over and over and over and over

01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:05.920
and over again.

01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:08.440
And probably, especially if you're a child and never get sick of it, right?

01:40:08.520 --> 01:40:10.560
Yeah, but then you're comparing like stories.

01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:16.040
I mean, like I said, if the story of The Order is really, really, really good, then

01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:17.280
there's no problem there.

01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:22.720
I just, I have a hard time believing that it's like, you know, if the story that would

01:40:22.720 --> 01:40:26.960
have to be that good would be like, for me, it would have to be along the lines of like

01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:29.480
Bioshock Infinite or something like that.

01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:32.880
You know, something really like, wow, you know, that's a really cool story.

01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:37.640
So, yeah, and I think the bottom line here and just kind of to try to wrap this subject

01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:44.000
up is that I think just because a game is six to eight hours and is $60 doesn't mean

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:49.480
that the game is instantly bad or a bad value and we shouldn't necessarily turn away

01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:53.360
and not even try a game because it's only six to eight hours and happens to be $60

01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:56.440
because there are a lot of good, compact experiences out there.

01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:00.600
It sounds to me like The Order is just not one of those experiences.

01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:05.480
For as hyped as this game was, you know, it might be very pretty and so forth, but the

01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:09.360
game, again, from what I'm hearing secondhand, maybe the game just wasn't

01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:10.200
particularly memorable.

01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:14.520
It sounds to me that they spent so much time on getting the visuals right on it, that

01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:17.600
they ran out of time to make the rest of the game and then they just had to put it up

01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:20.280
because it had already been delayed and delayed and delayed.

01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:24.640
And now it's just like, well, it's short, but we'll just make it up later in DLC that

01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:25.640
we can sell or something.

01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:26.240
Yeah.

01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:29.920
All right, anyhow, I'm sure there's plenty more to say on this topic, but maybe we'll

01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:33.480
take that to the forums for a little bit of a follow up next week.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.840
Anyhow, I do want to move on, though, because we're running a little long for this

01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:37.520
half of the show.

01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:42.920
But excuse me, we have to get to our classic game of the week.

01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:49.960
Every week, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game where she's

01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:57.720
like, hey, back in my day, you paid $60 to be a little square that would bounce a ball

01:41:58.280 --> 01:41:59.160
and you loved it.

01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:02.960
It's the classic game of the week.

01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:07.760
Dark Sakura, well, maybe this isn't really a square with a ball, but it is a classic

01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:07.800
game.

01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:09.640
It's at least 10 years old to qualify.

01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:10.680
It's older than some of you kids.

01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:11.240
That's right.

01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:13.120
Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?

01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:14.840
The classic game is Batagun.

01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:21.400
It is a vertical shoot-em-up game that was put up by a developer called Toaplan.

01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:26.480
The name translates to exceptional or extraordinary.

01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:33.800
It was an arcade game that came out in 1993, and there was a second version that was

01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:39.480
shown at the Arcade Operators Union in Japan that never came out because Toaplan went

01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:40.240
into bankruptcy.

01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:42.920
It was called a Batagun special version.

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:46.760
It appeared, though, on the second-hand market, by the way.

01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:56.520
There were two versions out on the Sega Saturn, one in 1996 that was recoded by an

01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:58.280
offshoot of Toaplan called Gazelle.

01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:05.280
This is the game that many people will say started the bullet hell genre or manic

01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:05.680
shooter.

01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:13.200
Basically, as the game was being developed, the employees would go up.

01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:15.320
Well, let me rephrase this.

01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:20.600
People who were involved in the development of the game went on to work at Cave and

01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:21.320
made this a thing.

01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:29.200
The main programmer of the game was Seneki Ikeda, who had a...

01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:36.160
I'd probably say this game, since it's pretty vicious with how hard it can get.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.200
I need to find this guy and go, why?

01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:47.720
Anyway, the special editions had a few different challenges and had a smaller

01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:54.200
hitbox, a shield, more powerful bombs, scoring items, and multiple game rounds or

01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:56.080
loops that got harder and harder.

01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:02.440
The Saturn versions were almost the same, but they had a few different things,

01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:07.200
including rearranged music and lack of slowdown in some cases.

01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:12.320
So it actually, you couldn't rely on the slowdown to give you more time to judge

01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:14.000
where your bullets were.

01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:17.440
So basically, it's the joystick two-button control.

01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:23.760
You have a fire, you have a bomb, and you gain experience points that are separate

01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:24.520
from the score.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:29.440
So every 288 points, your gun will level up and get stronger.

01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:34.520
So it's kind of like RPG elements in a shoot-em-up.

01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:38.320
The characters, though, were like super fucking generic-looking, as I'll get out.

01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:42.920
You had Geno, who actually looks kind of like Trunks from Dragon Ball Z.

01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:52.840
And then you have just the generic girl named, I'm going to mispronounce her name,

01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:53.800
Beltiana.

01:44:55.280 --> 01:45:01.560
And then you had the other guy who's like the pretty boy, bad boy guy named Iceman,

01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:07.720
who's like, I'm sure was a complete rip-off of Val Kilmer's character in Top Gun.

01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:13.840
So anyway, you also can get points by collecting these V-shaped medals.

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:17.840
And you get 3,000 points when the thing's finished for every one of those that you

01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:20.360
have, and 5,000 points for larger ones.

01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:23.760
And then if your ship is destroyed, you lose all your medals.

01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:26.120
You get an extra life at 1 million points.

01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:30.280
Now, the names of the ships just have the best names, the bad guys.

01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:39.480
You have Deep Purple, Madzilla, Deep Steel Darkness, Jupiter, and Ground of the

01:45:39.480 --> 01:45:40.120
Galaxy.

01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:45.240
It's with an R in it for how it was romanized, Galaxy, but I still think it's

01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:45.520
awesome.

01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:48.920
My favorite, though, is Mad Steel Darkness, because that's just a cool name, and I

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:49.880
would steal that for a band.

01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:50.920
So there you go.

01:45:51.560 --> 01:45:52.120
Botsugan.

01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:58.680
I have to admit, I have not really, I don't have a familiarity with this game until

01:45:58.680 --> 01:45:59.880
you are mentioning it here.

01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:04.840
I did not realize this was a game to thank for the bullet hell, but I can definitely

01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:05.640
see it in this.

01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:06.440
Yep.

01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:11.560
Did you see, like, just how, I mean, for as pretty as this game is, and the good

01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:15.920
music and really fun that it is, did you see just how absolutely generic the

01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:16.560
characters are?

01:46:16.600 --> 01:46:17.160
Yeah.

01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:19.480
Seriously, it's like, this guy looks like Trunks.

01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:22.600
This guy looks like, you know, generic anime guy number three.

01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:23.800
What year is this from?

01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:24.680
1993.

01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:30.440
So yeah, they all have that sort of mid to early 90s anime looking everybody.

01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:30.760
It's okay.

01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:32.920
I don't, I don't fault the game for that, really.

01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:37.800
This is actually a game I'm looking to get on Saturn, but I haven't, um, you

01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:40.520
know, when it's come across my path, I haven't had the money for it, so.

01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:41.640
All right.

01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:42.840
So there you go.

01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:44.040
There it is.

01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:46.280
Your classic game of the week.

01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:49.640
Batsu gun here on orange laundry.

01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:51.560
That's a good, I always say gun though.

01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:52.360
Cause it's a shooter.

01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:56.120
Surely you understand where I'm making my mistake.

01:46:57.160 --> 01:46:57.480
All right.

01:46:57.880 --> 01:47:02.680
Um, dark soccer, what, what, uh, bullet hell shooters do you think we would owe

01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:03.240
this game?

01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:04.040
Thanks.

01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:05.560
Espa galuda.

01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:07.000
Because I like saying espa galuda.

01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:12.280
I think for a while I was calling it escaped beluga.

01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:18.040
Uh, that is going to do it here on orange launch radio for the first half of our

01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:21.000
show, but don't go anywhere because there is plenty more show to come.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.720
When we come back, we're going to get into the Fugu question of the week, some

01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:28.120
rapid fire news, your emails, or maybe it's just email this week and your calls.

01:47:28.120 --> 01:47:30.200
We got more OLR, uh, to go.

01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:32.360
We got, and it's already 7 55.

01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:36.200
We got to get going here, uh, to try to get done here by nine o'clock or midnight

01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:36.760
on the East coast.

01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:38.600
Or I guess we just go along tonight.

01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:42.440
We'll find out when we come back with more of OLR right after this.

01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:55.320
Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live with our 588th episode on this

01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:59.000
February, the 22nd of 2015.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:00.040
And, uh, wow.

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:04.520
I can't believe we're 588 episodes in, which means 600, believe it or not, we're

01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:09.240
gonna, we're gonna more than likely get to 600 and 600 is looking on the horizon.

01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:12.680
Uh, and the date for that, just if you guys are planning, it looks like it's going to

01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:17.240
be May 24th would be the date that episode 600 is going to fall onto.

01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:21.960
Uh, that is assuming there is no more canceled shows after the PAX East week.

01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:23.960
Cause obviously if we cancel shows, it gets pushed back.

01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:24.920
Wouldn't that be funny though?

01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:29.400
Because if we ended up, if we canceled like four shows, not that I'm saying we

01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:33.000
should do that, but it would, uh, it would actually end up that our 600th episode

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.320
and our 13th anniversary would be on like the same day.

01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:36.600
So that would be kind of funny.

01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:40.200
Uh, but anyway, just for those of you guys, uh, playing along at home, uh, I

01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:42.120
don't know if we're going to do anything super big.

01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:46.280
We always talk about like, should we do something special for the 10 year, for

01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:49.400
the 500, for the 11 year, should we do something special that we never do?

01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:54.760
So 13 is kind of a weird, 13 is kind of a weird one, which, but it's 13.

01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:58.120
I mean, you know, that's kind of a lucky number for a lot of people.

01:48:58.120 --> 01:48:58.680
So I don't know.

01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:01.480
That would be a, uh, our bar.

01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:03.720
Don't we get a bar mitzvah when we turn 13?

01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:04.280
That's what we need.

01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:05.800
The orange lounge radio bar mitzvah.

01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:11.640
Jamie's giving me these looks of like, um, dot, dot, dot.

01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:14.280
Are you going to read from the Torah and Klingon?

01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:15.000
I guess I can.

01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:18.440
Maybe grandpa from Horthouse would be willing.

01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:19.480
He probably knows Klingon.

01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:20.040
He's a nerd.

01:49:20.920 --> 01:49:21.240
True.

01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:23.160
You knew where that came from, right?

01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:29.080
There was an episode of Frasier where he went to the, to the, uh, bar mitzvah and

01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:30.360
read the speech in Klingon.

01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:35.400
Uh, actually grandpa's in chat right now saying a Jerry Lewis telethon or Rob

01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:36.360
Roberts telethon.

01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:42.040
Actually, I'm all about the charity stuff and we have yet to really do a big, big

01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:42.920
charity push.

01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:45.960
So that's always a possibility, especially considering if I'm not

01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:50.680
mistaking, May 24th would be Memorial day weekend.

01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:51.240
Right.

01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:53.400
So, or is it the next week?

01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:53.800
I don't know.

01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:56.280
Maybe we'll actually kind of fall at a good time.

01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:56.680
We'll see.

01:49:58.120 --> 01:49:58.440
All right.

01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:02.120
Uh, anyway, for now let's get into, maybe that's something we can plan on our

01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:03.080
forums.

01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:05.320
Let's do a segment we like to call forum feedback.

01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:13.960
If you were not aware, Orange L'Antranio has a forum at the voice of geeks network

01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:18.840
vog network.com, uh, over at forums.vog network.com.

01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:20.360
That's VOG network.com.

01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:22.760
And I got to say props to you guys this week.

01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:27.320
Clap, clap, clap, clap, because now it's not just me making topics.

01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:29.000
The listeners are making topics.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:29.560
Thank you.

01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:31.560
And this is starting to take off a little bit.

01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:32.840
Who says forums are dead?

01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:34.600
You guys are, you guys are helping out in a big way.

01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:35.240
Thank you so much.

01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:38.200
I want to feature a couple of posts that were made on the forums this week.

01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:40.600
I'm actually going to focus.

01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:42.680
I can't read every post that's made.

01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:47.000
We make posts to have discussions, but I want to at least touch on a couple of the, uh,

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:47.800
listener made ones.

01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:53.080
YYR made a post on nostalgia, which had come up in our last episode.

01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:55.960
When does nostalgia come up on Orange L'Antranio?

01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:56.840
That never happens.

01:50:57.960 --> 01:51:03.720
Anyway, uh, but YYR started a topic on nostalgia, wanting to touch specifically on the discussion

01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:07.640
that happened late in the episode with this, with Sonic and nostalgia.

01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:11.160
I think somebody had made the comment about George RR Martin should kill off all Sonic's

01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:11.400
friends.

01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:12.280
Remember that?

01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:18.920
So the caller that suggested it was akin to chasing that first high may have been onto

01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:22.760
something for some people at least, but while the human body is constantly changing and

01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:27.080
no two drug samples are the same old video games are unique in the fact that they never

01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:28.280
change ever.

01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:32.520
Every old game is exactly the same as it was all those years ago.

01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:36.040
Now, I'm not sure if I'm just different or strange, but in recent times when I've gone

01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:40.520
back and played Mega Man 2, Super Mario World or other favorite games I played as a kid,

01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:42.760
I feel the same joy as I did back then.

01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:46.360
Everything is just as I remembered it, and I love revisiting these old classics again

01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:47.000
and again.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:50.360
This applies even to old Atari or Commodore games.

01:51:50.360 --> 01:51:53.400
I wonder if maybe this is because I've gone back to this stuff every few years.

01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:56.040
There hasn't been a huge gap of 15 or 20 years.

01:51:56.040 --> 01:51:58.360
How does everyone else feel when revisiting these old things?

01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:00.920
Rebel Romance replied to this and said,

01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:33.800
Me, when I play Super Mario Brothers 2, and it's a very specific moment in Mario Brothers

01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:39.240
2, when I play Super Mario Brothers 2, and I don't use those warp zones, I actually play

01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:44.600
the game straight through, and I get to World 1-3 where you fight the boss Mauser.

01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:45.080
Remember that?

01:52:45.080 --> 01:52:45.880
Remember the boss Mauser?

01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:48.520
Mario 2 had some really awesome characters.

01:52:48.520 --> 01:52:49.560
Never really came back.

01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:50.760
Like, there was what?

01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:51.880
Fry Guy and...

01:52:51.880 --> 01:52:53.720
Yeah, but those weren't technically...

01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:57.560
I know they were part of the whole the Japanese Doki Doki.

01:52:57.560 --> 01:53:02.840
But if they can repurpose the Shy Guys...

01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:06.360
Come on, Shy Guys came from that game, and they've been repurposed in all these other

01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:06.920
Mario games.

01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:09.160
If they can do that, they can bring back Wart or something.

01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:10.920
I'm waiting for a Mario game where we take him on again.

01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:12.200
But anyway, I digress.

01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:20.840
When I play Mauser, I remember that night, and it was New Year's Eve, probably when I

01:53:20.840 --> 01:53:21.960
was 10 years old.

01:53:21.960 --> 01:53:25.160
I might be fudging the year a little bit, but I think I was 10 years old on New Year's

01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:25.800
Eve.

01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:30.520
I stayed up all night because you could do that because it was New Year's Eve, so a 10

01:53:30.520 --> 01:53:31.560
year old could be up all night.

01:53:31.560 --> 01:53:34.680
That was the one day a year you got to be a total insomniac as a kid, right?

01:53:35.320 --> 01:53:38.040
I stayed up all night trying to beat him.

01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:40.360
And I finally did, but I remember it took several tries.

01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:41.160
And I just...

01:53:41.160 --> 01:53:46.040
I don't know, when I play Mauser in Super Mario Brothers 2, I'm taken back to, I'm staying

01:53:46.040 --> 01:53:46.840
up all night.

01:53:46.840 --> 01:53:47.720
I'm being bad.

01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:49.320
I'm staying up all night and playing video games.

01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:50.040
This is what I love.

01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:55.080
So I don't know if you guys have any specific moments you remember like that, but that's

01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:55.880
something for me.

01:53:55.880 --> 01:53:58.200
No, but I have a thought about Sonic, though.

01:53:58.200 --> 01:54:02.280
See, the thing is, I think the new series now, Sonic Boom, is they're trying to be very

01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:03.480
formulaic with it.

01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:08.360
Instead of just making a Sonic game and making a good Sonic game, like they did with the

01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:12.600
original Sonic games, now it's like, we got to turn it into a franchise.

01:54:12.600 --> 01:54:17.240
But not necessarily a franchise that is a video game franchise, but a franchise that

01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:20.360
we can put on lunch boxes and we can sell all this stuff.

01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:24.120
They want to turn it into like a Skylanders or even...

01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:25.560
See, Pac-Man did the same thing.

01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:29.080
They turned it into the Ghostly Adventures thing and they're trying to sell the TV show

01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:32.280
to get the kids hooked on it, but kids don't give a shit about it.

01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:33.720
And that's the problem is...

01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:37.480
It was kind of when Pac-Man went back to its roots with the Championship Edition and so

01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:40.200
forth, like the original designer had a hand in that, right?

01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:44.760
When you got Pac-Man Battle Royale, these are all like really strong offerings in the

01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:45.720
Pac-Man series, right?

01:54:45.720 --> 01:54:49.880
Even like the cartoon, like I've watched some of the cartoon with my son.

01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:52.040
The Ghostly Adventures isn't terrible.

01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:53.960
It's just, I don't know.

01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:56.680
I just think Sonic Boom is just kind of way off.

01:54:56.680 --> 01:54:59.640
It's not the same thing, I guess.

01:54:59.640 --> 01:55:03.000
It's kind of like how Skylanders isn't Spyro, maybe.

01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:06.600
Anyway, I love these type of stories.

01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:10.680
And YYR is actually in chat right now saying, that is so specific and it's interesting that

01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:14.360
you remember the positive aspect of that and not the, it took so many tries part.

01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:18.440
You know, also not to get like too deep or whatever, but like, I have serious memory

01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:18.920
problems.

01:55:18.920 --> 01:55:20.120
Just ask Alan about this.

01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:23.000
Like Alan has to remind me of shit all the time.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
I double book myself constantly.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:26.760
I forget things all the time.

01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:29.080
Heaven help you if I'm supposed to remember your birthday.

01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:31.160
If it weren't for Facebook, I'd probably forget them all.

01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:33.320
Like I just, I have a horrible memory.

01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:39.560
So when I do have like things like that, that I really cling to another, I'll tell you,

01:55:39.560 --> 01:55:42.760
I'll give you one more since you like that one YYR, I'll give you one more.

01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:45.080
And I remember a lot of you when you were younger remember this.

01:55:45.080 --> 01:55:49.640
I remember again, this was a stay up all night slumber party and my friend Devin growing

01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:52.920
up his house, we were playing star tropics for the first time.

01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:53.960
And he had just got it.

01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:57.000
And we were playing, I swear to God, we were playing that game all fucking night.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:00.360
And we got to the part where you had to have the letter.

01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:06.760
And I swear to God, I can't remember what I did last week, but I can remember the layout

01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:09.880
of Devin's kitchen going to get the jar.

01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:13.160
Cause it was like, it was like an old school, like Mason jar type of thing that we got.

01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:17.800
We filled with water and put that letter in there so that you could see that code that

01:56:17.800 --> 01:56:18.920
actually came up on there.

01:56:18.920 --> 01:56:23.240
So anyway, I do, I have these like really random ass memories in gaming.

01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:25.800
So when things like that come up, I cling to them.

01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:29.960
Or in case you don't have the mail cause you bought the game used and you have to call

01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:31.400
Nintendo hint line.

01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:35.880
They're like, well, I just put the letter in the, in, in, in the, uh, in water.

01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:37.320
I'm like, what letter?

01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:38.680
And their letter came with the manual.

01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:39.800
I don't have the manual.

01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:40.120
Okay.

01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:41.480
The code seven 67.

01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:43.880
Oh my gosh.

01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:45.320
Uh, why, why are I'm sorry?

01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:46.200
Seven 47.

01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:50.360
I have to write everything down or ask people to remind me, but I will always remember how

01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:52.680
to get through the beams of the quick man stage.

01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:53.000
Yes.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:54.920
I am high fiving you from California.

01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:55.240
Yes.

01:56:55.240 --> 01:56:56.520
I totally remember that.

01:56:56.520 --> 01:56:56.760
Okay.

01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:57.560
You want one more story?

01:56:57.560 --> 01:56:58.120
One more story.

01:56:58.120 --> 01:56:59.560
Rob was literally doing that by the way.

01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:02.040
I, I don't lie here on OLR.

01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:06.760
I also remember getting in a heap shit ton of trouble in the fifth grade.

01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:10.600
I got busted because the teacher was trying to teach.

01:57:11.160 --> 01:57:14.280
Which is ironic now that I'm also a teacher, but the teacher was trying to teach and I

01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:19.080
wasn't having it because I just got the latest episode of Nintendo power or at least episode

01:57:19.080 --> 01:57:23.080
latest issue of Nintendo power with Simon Belmont on the cover.

01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:26.440
It was that very controversial cover on, if you remember, I got that and I brought it

01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:30.280
to school and, um, I was showing one of my friends while she was trying to teach and

01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:31.160
she got so pissed.

01:57:31.160 --> 01:57:32.360
She took it away from me.

01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:36.840
But what's funny about that memory is that what was on the cover, which if I remember

01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:39.800
why it was kind of a graphic decapitation was on the cover.

01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:40.840
That wasn't an issue.

01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:43.720
I never got in trouble over that.

01:57:43.720 --> 01:57:46.520
I got in trouble for bringing literature to school.

01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:50.120
Nowadays, you'd be like supporting, you know, terrorism or something like that.

01:57:50.120 --> 01:57:52.440
And they arrest you.

01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:52.840
Anyway.

01:57:53.640 --> 01:57:55.720
YYR says, wasn't that the second issue ever?

01:57:55.720 --> 01:57:57.640
It was one of the first five for sure.

01:57:58.200 --> 01:57:59.240
It might've been the second one.

01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:01.000
It was, it was an early one for sure.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:01.640
For sure.

01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:05.080
Anyway, uh, moving on, uh, let's get to it now.

01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:08.120
You know what the payback I get for that is, by the way, when I'm trying to teach class

01:58:08.120 --> 01:58:12.280
and people are on the fucking internet while I'm trying to teach, teach a class anyway,

01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:18.040
uh, going to another topic from our forums one more tonight where a Flacco Jones has

01:58:18.040 --> 01:58:23.000
started a topic on video games, genre mashups, uh, because, uh, he was talking about that.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:26.840
We had the guys from Star Mazer on last week, which by the way, congrats.

01:58:26.840 --> 01:58:28.280
They made their Kickstarter goal.

01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:30.440
And I'd like to think we helped a little bit.

01:58:30.440 --> 01:58:33.560
Surely their own telethons and they did like a 24 hour thing on Friday.

01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:37.080
That was probably a big part of it, but they not only hit their goal, they did make it

01:58:37.080 --> 01:58:43.240
to 180,000, which was their first stretch goal for, um, bringing in more musical talent.

01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:46.280
So some of those great names that they were talking about are going to be on this soundtrack.

01:58:46.280 --> 01:58:48.440
So congrats to those guys from Star Mazer.

01:58:48.440 --> 01:58:52.440
But, uh, Flacco Jones had been listening to the interview and said, I was intrigued by

01:58:52.440 --> 01:58:54.920
the merging of point and click and shmup genres.

01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:58.520
And I wanted to know what other genre mashups the listeners could come up with.

01:58:58.520 --> 01:58:59.320
I'll start.

01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:03.080
When I interviewed with Konami to be a game tester years ago, one of the questions they

01:59:03.080 --> 01:59:05.240
asked me was, what is your favorite type of video game?

01:59:05.240 --> 01:59:09.080
And I answered, I like RPGs and sports games the most.

01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:11.880
The interview commented that he never heard that combination before.

01:59:11.880 --> 01:59:15.080
And that got me thinking about not the individual genres, but combining them.

01:59:15.080 --> 01:59:16.680
Well, I don't play them as much anymore.

01:59:16.680 --> 01:59:20.200
One of the things I liked most about playing sports games was career mode.

01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:24.200
If there even was one now take that concept and really expand it to incorporate elements

01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:28.280
of RPGs, where you upgrade your character skills, not just through combat or playing

01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:31.640
the games in this case, but through all sorts of other methods, such as interaction with

01:59:31.640 --> 01:59:33.960
other characters, side quests, and so on.

01:59:33.960 --> 01:59:38.440
If during your career mode, your athlete makes a blunder on social media, for example, they

01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:40.280
actually lose stats.

01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:44.200
There's a ton of possibilities beyond just playing a sporting event and getting better

01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:46.600
or worse throughout the season or career.

01:59:46.600 --> 01:59:51.080
Now, Bobby Black Wolf joined in and followed this up saying, you know, the NCAA football

01:59:51.080 --> 01:59:52.040
games did that for a while.

01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:55.400
You'd have to schedule your off time and that affected your stats the next game.

01:59:55.400 --> 01:59:57.640
Spend free time studying raises your awareness.

01:59:57.640 --> 01:59:59.800
Spend time into the gym raises your toughness.

01:59:59.800 --> 02:00:02.280
Spend time with your girlfriend distresses you.

02:00:02.280 --> 02:00:05.720
In your dorm room, you would even have a picture of your current girlfriend.

02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:08.440
And as you got better, you got hotter girlfriends.

02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:10.200
Well, that's interesting, but okay.

02:00:11.560 --> 02:00:15.160
You can then take that character and import them into Madden, which would take his stats.

02:00:15.160 --> 02:00:18.440
And then Madden also has stuff like press interviews and coach interactions.

02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:20.120
It's very basic, but the groundwork is there.

02:00:20.120 --> 02:00:25.240
They even simulate Twitter now where you can see ESPN pundits and fans tweeting about your

02:00:25.240 --> 02:00:26.440
action on the field.

02:00:28.680 --> 02:00:29.480
Oh my gosh.

02:00:30.120 --> 02:00:33.640
And then YYR said, has there been a combined fighting music game yet?

02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:36.360
Like if you hit enemies off beat, they barely flinch.

02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:39.880
But if you punch them perfectly on beat, they explode into bloody chunks.

02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:44.200
Not so much that, but Def Jam Icon was a fighting game set to music.

02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:48.440
See, and Bobby Black Wolf has suggested Kickbeat to that actually as well.

02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:53.640
And YYR said, Kickbeat's kind of a rhythm game at its core, but I meant something like

02:00:53.640 --> 02:00:57.000
you have free control over your character and their attacks, like final fight.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:58.840
But the timing of the attack matters.

02:00:58.840 --> 02:01:00.680
Also bloody explosions, very important.

02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:05.080
Def Jam Icon, but it wasn't bloody explosions, but it would like, if you hit stuff on the

02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:07.000
beat, then it would do more damage.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:07.800
In a way.

02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:14.840
I mean, I don't, this is kind of out there, but go back to the old school Kung Fu on the

02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:15.960
8-bit NES.

02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:17.400
Do you remember Kung Fu?

02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:20.760
Like it was like a side scroller and you were going up the different stories to, I don't

02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:23.320
know, rescue your girlfriend who was on the fifth floor or something like that.

02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:27.240
You know, there was a pattern to the way those enemies would show up.

02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:30.840
And for some people you would kind of get it to the music, right?

02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:36.600
So in a way, like a game like Kung Fu, you could probably memorize some of the patterns

02:01:36.600 --> 02:01:38.760
of the guys that come out to the music.

02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:43.320
I don't know, but I think I kind of just like maybe the concept is rooted in there somewhere,

02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:45.800
somewhere, but of course we need more bloody explosions.

02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:47.560
I completely understand that.

02:01:47.560 --> 02:01:52.680
Anyway, great suggestions, great suggestions on the forums.

02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:53.720
I love these posts.

02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:54.280
Post more.

02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:55.240
You guys are doing awesome.

02:01:55.240 --> 02:01:57.240
Forums.vognetwork.com.

02:01:57.240 --> 02:02:00.760
Don't be shy, but remember I can't read everything on air because I've already spent 15 minutes

02:02:00.760 --> 02:02:05.160
reading that and we got to get into some more segments like our rapid fire news.

02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:05.800
Loki.

02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:09.800
Yeah, it's funny that you mentioned Star Tropics because this story actually has to do with

02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:10.920
Star Tropics.

02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:18.200
Apparently this guy named Brad Smith was playing Star Tropics and noticed that there was something

02:02:18.200 --> 02:02:25.160
kind of funky about the sound in the game and actually went through and edited the ROM

02:02:25.160 --> 02:02:31.720
to fix the problem, to basically fix, there was like this little bit of, I don't know

02:02:31.720 --> 02:02:36.440
what you'd call it, like part of the melody or whatever that cuts out in the game that

02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:40.680
comes back later on in like the overworld and it just sounds weird.

02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:45.960
So he found out what it was and, you know, edited some code errors in there.

02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:51.560
Now it plays fine, but it's kind of cool that people go back and bug fix stuff, you

02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:53.640
know, from a long time ago.

02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:56.360
Kind of like how they remember the ET and made ET better.

02:02:56.360 --> 02:02:57.160
That was pretty cool.

02:02:59.240 --> 02:03:00.840
And then this is kind of funny.

02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:06.920
Did you know that there was a Carmen Sandiego game that took place entirely in North Dakota?

02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:12.040
Yes, there was a Where in North Dakota is Carmen Sandiego.

02:03:12.040 --> 02:03:15.160
I believe that I brought this up when I actually covered Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego.

02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:16.120
Did you really?

02:03:16.120 --> 02:03:17.400
I don't, I didn't remember it.

02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:18.200
I believe I did.

02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:18.680
Oh, maybe.

02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:23.800
It actually happened a few other places were able to license the character for doing a

02:03:23.800 --> 02:03:26.360
local edutainment games.

02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:28.760
Is this something making the blog rounds again this week or something?

02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:29.320
Yes.

02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:30.040
Okay, I got it.

02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:35.080
But they actually had like a review that was done of the game and kind of showing it and

02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:36.360
it looked like it was pretty decent.

02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:41.480
Yeah, originally there were supposed to be 20 different states kind of trying to license

02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:45.400
their own versions of the game, but it never ended up happening.

02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:51.320
So let me think if she's in North Dakota, she's probably in, I don't know, Bismarck

02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:53.080
because where else are you going to go in North Dakota?

02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:57.640
Well, there's lots of different cities there.

02:03:57.640 --> 02:03:58.840
So she's in a field.

02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:00.520
I'm kidding.

02:04:00.520 --> 02:04:01.000
I'm kidding.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:04.840
I don't want angry North Dakotans messaging me, but apparently, yeah, you can actually,

02:04:04.840 --> 02:04:05.880
I think, download the game.

02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:14.120
They were saying that it's on Asimov's Apple II FTP, which is ftp.apple.asimov.net.

02:04:15.640 --> 02:04:16.440
So that's kind of cool.

02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:22.840
And then this is where in North Dakota is Carmen Sandiego Bismarck.

02:04:23.480 --> 02:04:24.680
She's in Bismarck.

02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:29.640
Anyways, I'm singing way too much on tonight's show.

02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:30.680
I apologize.

02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:32.040
I apologize.

02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:32.760
It's very sweet.

02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:38.680
This is one of the old shareware games I used to love back in the 90s, Raptor Call of the

02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:39.320
Shadows.

02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:46.200
It was a shmup game that came out, and now they have a brand new kind of addition of

02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:55.160
it, the 2015 edition on Steam that you can get for $4.49, and it brings back, was it

02:04:55.160 --> 02:04:56.120
27 levels?

02:04:56.120 --> 02:05:02.520
And I want to say, was this Apogee or, I don't remember who made this, but it was

02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:03.720
awesome, so go check it out.

02:05:05.800 --> 02:05:09.960
And it had a mode, and they had like, I wonder if the Easter eggs are still in there, because

02:05:09.960 --> 02:05:13.800
they had a mode with like, if you played it on the developer's birthday or something,

02:05:13.800 --> 02:05:18.520
like the enemies became lizards and stuff, and it would have like funny music and, I

02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:18.840
don't know.

02:05:20.360 --> 02:05:26.920
All right, well, moving on to, this isn't so much a classic video game, but it's definitely

02:05:26.920 --> 02:05:31.640
a classic board game that does have a video game adaptation.

02:05:31.640 --> 02:05:33.080
A lot of people really love this game.

02:05:33.080 --> 02:05:35.000
It shows up in a lot of board game parties.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
It's Settlers of Catan.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:42.200
Settlers of Catan apparently has been optioned to be made into a movie or TV show.

02:05:42.200 --> 02:05:42.920
What?

02:05:42.920 --> 02:05:43.320
Right?

02:05:43.320 --> 02:05:45.160
This is gonna be weird.

02:05:45.160 --> 02:05:50.360
Producer Gail Katz, known for movies like Pawn Sacrifice, Air Force One, and The Perfect

02:05:50.360 --> 02:05:55.880
Storm, bought the film and television rights for Settlers of Catan, saying she's excited

02:05:55.880 --> 02:05:59.720
by vivid, visual, exciting, and timeless world of Catan.

02:06:00.680 --> 02:06:05.080
Now, the weird thing is, there's really no plot to Settlers of Catan, so...

02:06:06.040 --> 02:06:08.840
It's all about trading your sheep for wood or...

02:06:08.840 --> 02:06:11.880
But at the same time, that means there's a lot you can do with it.

02:06:11.880 --> 02:06:17.640
So, I don't know, Clue was a board game, is like one of the best movies ever.

02:06:18.360 --> 02:06:20.280
So, but then there's also Battleship.

02:06:20.280 --> 02:06:22.120
So, I'm hoping...

02:06:22.120 --> 02:06:26.680
But the problem is like, whenever I hear that they're licensing like some sort of fantasy

02:06:26.680 --> 02:06:33.720
or medieval like genre game, it's just like, hey, we want to try to be the next Game of

02:06:33.720 --> 02:06:35.720
Thrones, and that's what I always worry about.

02:06:35.720 --> 02:06:37.000
No, I hope not.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:40.760
It's just like, I don't know, there's not really a story to Settlers of Catan.

02:06:40.760 --> 02:06:44.920
Unless you do like something like ridiculous, like it's a bunch of people that play Settlers

02:06:44.920 --> 02:06:49.240
of Catan professionally or something like that, then maybe there'd be some silly movie

02:06:49.240 --> 02:06:51.160
out of that, but I don't see it.

02:06:51.880 --> 02:06:54.760
Anyhow, the Xbox One, the screenshots.

02:06:54.760 --> 02:06:58.920
We talked about this, I think, a couple weeks ago on the show because there was a tweet

02:06:58.920 --> 02:07:01.080
or something that had gone out from Phil Spencer.

02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:04.200
However, this week it's rolling out to beta testers.

02:07:04.200 --> 02:07:10.200
It's going to be part of the March system update, and this will allow you to say, Xbox,

02:07:10.200 --> 02:07:14.520
take a screenshot, you know, if you have that Kinect, or you can double tap the Xbox button

02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:17.480
on the controller and then press Y to take a picture.

02:07:17.480 --> 02:07:21.400
There's a little demo video that shows how it works, but it's just a screenshot, y'all.

02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:22.600
It's not that complicated.

02:07:22.600 --> 02:07:23.960
Glad to hear you're getting that feature.

02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:31.720
And lastly, a video game hall of fame being created at the National Museum of Play, another

02:07:31.720 --> 02:07:36.760
term, I guess another way to call the strong, which is the folks that are behind this,

02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:39.080
museumofplay.org.

02:07:39.080 --> 02:07:44.760
It's a New York-based outfit, and they are considering any game, basically, right now

02:07:44.760 --> 02:07:49.000
for its freshman class of World Video Game Hall of Fame honorees.

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:52.760
It could be arcade, console, computer, handheld, or mobile.

02:07:53.640 --> 02:07:57.800
Visit the Strong's website and make a case for why it is your choice.

02:07:58.600 --> 02:08:03.480
I guess the website for that is worldvideogamehalloffame.org

02:08:03.480 --> 02:08:06.440
slash nominate, so you can check that out.

02:08:06.440 --> 02:08:13.400
So, quickly, what video game are we going to ask the OL Army to go nominate?

02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:19.320
What video game do we believe they should be nominating into the Hall of Fame?

02:08:19.320 --> 02:08:21.160
I was going to say President Cat.

02:08:21.240 --> 02:08:21.740
No.

02:08:23.480 --> 02:08:24.760
Duh, The Guardian Legend.

02:08:25.960 --> 02:08:27.560
I could support The Guardian Legend.

02:08:28.280 --> 02:08:30.520
Very overlooked classic on the NES.

02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:31.880
Loki, you okay with that?

02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:32.520
I'm fine with that.

02:08:32.520 --> 02:08:33.480
Alright, The Guardian Legend.

02:08:33.480 --> 02:08:34.920
That or Miss World Nude Nights.

02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:42.040
Both are classics in their own right.

02:08:44.760 --> 02:08:48.520
Go ye fourth listeners, make it work, make it happen.

02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:52.840
Get either The Guardian Legend or Miss Nude World 96.

02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:55.160
Come on Dark Soccer, you have to admit that's a pretty good choice.

02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:55.660
No.

02:08:55.960 --> 02:08:57.640
Everybody, move your body.

02:08:57.640 --> 02:08:58.280
Guardian Legend.

02:08:59.080 --> 02:08:59.640
There is nothing else.

02:08:59.640 --> 02:09:01.080
It's a singing episode, it's a musical episode.

02:09:01.080 --> 02:09:01.960
There is nothing else.

02:09:03.160 --> 02:09:06.760
I don't know, I might go nominate Miss Nude World 96 now.

02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:07.260
Alright.

02:09:09.320 --> 02:09:12.200
Alright, Dark Soccer, if you want you can change the topic with some more news.

02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:13.340
Spawn.

02:09:13.340 --> 02:09:19.900
Uh, yes, there is a topic that was discussed with Todd McFarlane

02:09:20.540 --> 02:09:26.300
as if Spawn was going to be showing up in the new Mortal Kombat game.

02:09:27.660 --> 02:09:31.340
He said that they have access to use Spawn if they want to.

02:09:31.340 --> 02:09:32.300
It's up to them.

02:09:32.300 --> 02:09:36.060
He gave them a window of time, so if they want to, it could happen.

02:09:37.420 --> 02:09:38.140
So, we'll see.

02:09:38.140 --> 02:09:47.740
In other news, Nintendo has happy, happy fun stuff going on with the 25th anniversary of Fire Emblem.

02:09:47.740 --> 02:09:50.540
They're doing a symphony concert in Japan.

02:09:50.540 --> 02:09:57.340
This is going to be taking place, uh, looking at Tokyo Dome City Hall between July 24th and 25th.

02:09:58.140 --> 02:10:01.660
And, uh, someone give me a ticket so I can go.

02:10:03.340 --> 02:10:03.840
Please.

02:10:04.300 --> 02:10:05.420
I'm begging a little bit.

02:10:05.980 --> 02:10:09.820
And then, last but not least, houses for, uh, card games.

02:10:09.820 --> 02:10:10.940
Exploding Kittens!

02:10:11.660 --> 02:10:17.180
Exploding Kittens, put out by the oatmeal, has broken all Kickstarter records.

02:10:18.460 --> 02:10:27.180
They raised 8.78 million dollars with, uh, 219,382 backers.

02:10:28.540 --> 02:10:29.020
So...

02:10:29.020 --> 02:10:29.660
I'm one of them.

02:10:31.340 --> 02:10:34.140
You get to have Exploding Kittens as a card game.

02:10:34.220 --> 02:10:36.700
And the NSFW deck, which you know, like,

02:10:36.700 --> 02:10:41.740
I think, seriously, like, 90% of the people who backed it opted for the NSFW deck.

02:10:41.740 --> 02:10:43.020
Because we're all perverts.

02:10:43.660 --> 02:10:44.540
You know what?

02:10:44.540 --> 02:10:45.040
What?

02:10:45.500 --> 02:10:49.500
The oatmeal has been behind another Kickstarter that I think actually was a little bit more,

02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:53.820
I would say, important than Exploding Kittens.

02:10:55.100 --> 02:10:57.980
There was the funding out for a Nikola Tesla museum.

02:10:58.940 --> 02:10:59.580
Oh, I remember that.

02:10:59.580 --> 02:11:00.860
IndieGoGo, yeah, I remember that.

02:11:01.580 --> 02:11:05.580
Which actually, um, had a contribution by Elon Musk of Tesla Motors.

02:11:06.380 --> 02:11:07.340
So, same.

02:11:08.700 --> 02:11:10.940
But Exploding Kittens, Dark Soccer, it's...

02:11:10.940 --> 02:11:11.260
Rob!

02:11:12.780 --> 02:11:13.100
Fine!

02:11:13.100 --> 02:11:14.860
Then when I get my deck, you can't play.

02:11:16.140 --> 02:11:16.640
All right.

02:11:17.500 --> 02:11:20.220
We're gonna get to the Fugu question of the week, but I just wanted to, uh,

02:11:20.220 --> 02:11:24.300
I wanted to mention to Loki, you know, because we were joking about Miss Nude World 96.

02:11:24.300 --> 02:11:28.060
Do you know what I just realized as I was walking to the kitchen and getting some water?

02:11:28.060 --> 02:11:29.580
This is gonna be the 20th anniversary.

02:11:29.580 --> 02:11:32.780
The 20th anniversary is next year.

02:11:32.780 --> 02:11:34.460
I feel like we should celebrate.

02:11:35.900 --> 02:11:37.340
Well, you know what that means.

02:11:37.340 --> 02:11:39.420
Strippers in Miss New World 96.

02:11:39.420 --> 02:11:44.140
Rob, the moment you said that, the line popped into my head from Resident Evil.

02:11:44.140 --> 02:11:46.220
I feel like we're having a secret meeting.

02:11:48.380 --> 02:11:56.300
It's gonna be one weird, one weird cam show on, uh, on, was it that PlayStation thing?

02:11:56.300 --> 02:11:58.780
That's every week here at OLR is a secret meeting.

02:11:59.420 --> 02:12:02.460
All right, let's get to the Fugu question of the week.

02:12:10.460 --> 02:12:11.820
You guys know the drill by now.

02:12:11.820 --> 02:12:16.780
You take Facebook, you take Google Plus, you slam it together, and you get Fugu.

02:12:16.780 --> 02:12:21.340
And every week we ask a question of our, uh, Facebook and Google Plus communities,

02:12:21.340 --> 02:12:25.020
uh, that we will check out the responses here.

02:12:25.020 --> 02:12:28.620
Uh, I guess I could read them all tonight because, uh, very few of you responded over

02:12:28.620 --> 02:12:29.420
on Google Plus.

02:12:29.420 --> 02:12:31.260
Remember it was getting, it was like a tie last week.

02:12:31.260 --> 02:12:34.860
It was like three and three, but this week Facebook decided to be kind to us and showed

02:12:34.860 --> 02:12:35.740
the post to more people.

02:12:35.740 --> 02:12:40.220
So we only got one answer on Google Plus to this question and it's about Killer Queen.

02:12:40.780 --> 02:12:45.020
No, not the infamous Queen song, uh, although that is awesome too.

02:12:45.020 --> 02:12:47.660
And I would sing it for you, but I've hit my quotient for the night.

02:12:47.660 --> 02:12:51.100
However, it's the arcade game that Dark Soccer was talking about earlier.

02:12:51.100 --> 02:12:54.540
Now this had us thinking about multiplayer arcade experiences.

02:12:54.620 --> 02:12:56.780
This is a 10 player arcade game, right?

02:12:56.780 --> 02:12:59.660
So many of you grew up in or around arcades.

02:12:59.660 --> 02:13:04.300
What was an epic multiplayer experience that you remember from playing in the arcade?

02:13:04.300 --> 02:13:07.500
This can be recent or this can be a long time ago.

02:13:07.500 --> 02:13:11.500
You know, as an example, Dark Soccer, Loki and I, we all met playing DDR, which, you

02:13:11.500 --> 02:13:15.420
know, wasn't necessarily a multiplayer game, but that was absolutely an experience.

02:13:15.420 --> 02:13:16.940
But that usually led to other stuff.

02:13:16.940 --> 02:13:20.860
Like I remember Dark Soccer and I one night going to town on the grid, which was like

02:13:20.860 --> 02:13:22.700
around the corner from DDR.

02:13:23.660 --> 02:13:25.020
Yeah, it looked like a fun game.

02:13:25.020 --> 02:13:25.900
Yeah, we played that.

02:13:25.900 --> 02:13:29.500
Anyway, so I was wondering if you guys had some like multiplayer experiences as well.

02:13:29.500 --> 02:13:30.540
Sumo game.

02:13:30.540 --> 02:13:35.420
The, oh God, that wasn't really a multiplayer game, but yeah, it was definitely a, we all

02:13:35.420 --> 02:13:37.500
stood around it and went the fuck?

02:13:37.500 --> 02:13:40.060
Well, you know what we had when I worked in an arcade?

02:13:40.060 --> 02:13:41.020
Run and gun.

02:13:41.020 --> 02:13:42.060
Oh yeah.

02:13:42.060 --> 02:13:43.980
All right, let's get to some of the listener responses here.

02:13:44.700 --> 02:13:50.060
Act Deft is our lone Google Plus reply tonight saying, I remember the Suzuka eight hours

02:13:50.140 --> 02:13:53.740
machines with four bikes and a main screen in the middle so anyone could watch what every

02:13:53.740 --> 02:13:54.780
player was watching.

02:13:54.780 --> 02:13:57.900
I also remember the Super Street Fighter two tournament edition cabs.

02:13:57.900 --> 02:13:59.580
Those were really cool.

02:13:59.580 --> 02:14:04.300
Yeah, Street Fighter two in some ways really just like lit the multiplayer stuff, you know,

02:14:04.300 --> 02:14:05.580
on fire in the arcades.

02:14:05.580 --> 02:14:09.100
Like at least for my youth, that was such a huge part of it.

02:14:09.660 --> 02:14:13.900
I don't think you can even have a conversation about multiplayer arcade games without mentioning

02:14:13.900 --> 02:14:14.940
Street Fighter two.

02:14:15.900 --> 02:14:20.940
Ragenator replies over on Facebook saying, for me it was playing Samurai Shodown 4, Amakusa's

02:14:20.940 --> 02:14:26.060
Revenge on a four slot Neo Geo MVS at my former college's coffee house.

02:14:26.060 --> 02:14:29.660
We had the same regulars playing that game constantly against each other and it was a

02:14:29.660 --> 02:14:30.060
blast.

02:14:30.700 --> 02:14:35.420
Andy R says, I remember when Blaze Blue first came out and Sunnyvale Golf Land was pretty

02:14:35.420 --> 02:14:37.020
much the only place that had it.

02:14:37.020 --> 02:14:39.820
My friends and I journeyed up there from school to play it.

02:14:39.820 --> 02:14:43.260
It was about a three hour drive and after we had fun with the game, one of my friends

02:14:43.260 --> 02:14:46.140
was joking about buying the arcade board for the game.

02:14:46.140 --> 02:14:49.980
We would end up doing the trip again for DJ Max Technica, rest in peace.

02:14:49.980 --> 02:14:51.260
Hey Andy R, you know what?

02:14:51.260 --> 02:14:55.420
We hear you because we used to make that same trip to Sunnyvale Golf Land to play Beatmania

02:14:55.420 --> 02:14:56.300
2DX.

02:14:56.300 --> 02:15:00.300
So actually back in the day, we used to drive to Arcade Infinity.

02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:04.300
That's about a six hour drive from Sacramento to go to LA and play all the, we would go

02:15:04.300 --> 02:15:06.620
to Korea town to play the stuff there.

02:15:07.420 --> 02:15:09.260
Oh, good times, good times.

02:15:09.260 --> 02:15:12.460
This is like, I can't imagine road tripping for an arcade anymore these days.

02:15:13.580 --> 02:15:16.300
Red The Haze replies and says, mine would be virtual on.

02:15:17.020 --> 02:15:20.220
My friend and I tried it for the first time a few years ago and we got really hooked and

02:15:20.220 --> 02:15:24.220
dropped more than $10, which was a lot for us poor college students back then.

02:15:24.220 --> 02:15:27.740
Now I regret not picking up those twin sticks for the Dreamcast when I saw them at a local

02:15:27.740 --> 02:15:28.700
game store.

02:15:28.700 --> 02:15:32.700
Degenerate Johnny replies and says, back when I lived in Detroit as a kid, my friends and

02:15:32.700 --> 02:15:35.660
I treated our local arcade comic book store as a second home.

02:15:35.660 --> 02:15:40.140
We often finished multiplayer games in one sitting, X-Men, Simpsons, Ninja Turtles, so

02:15:40.140 --> 02:15:40.540
on.

02:15:40.540 --> 02:15:44.860
However, none stood out more than the summer day in 1994 when the arcade received its latest

02:15:44.860 --> 02:15:47.980
game, Aliens vs. Predator from Capcom.

02:15:47.980 --> 02:15:48.700
Hell yeah.

02:15:48.700 --> 02:15:52.700
Once the owner plugged in the game, my friends and I were on it like shit on Velcro.

02:15:53.260 --> 02:15:57.340
After hours of dumping quarters, we finally beat this intense four player beat-em-up.

02:15:57.340 --> 02:16:00.220
It was a truly epic moment in our early gaming lives.

02:16:00.220 --> 02:16:04.300
What made it more epic was that the game made us stay up till midnight, first time for me.

02:16:04.300 --> 02:16:08.540
Punishment from our parents followed, of course, for this 10 year old, but was worth it.

02:16:08.540 --> 02:16:15.340
Oh my God, you were 10 out in Detroit until midnight playing Aliens vs. Predator?

02:16:17.980 --> 02:16:19.980
That's, that's, oh my God.

02:16:21.660 --> 02:16:22.860
I would have spanked you.

02:16:24.620 --> 02:16:25.100
All right.

02:16:26.220 --> 02:16:27.580
And not in the sexy way.

02:16:28.140 --> 02:16:31.980
SSJ100 Matt replies and says, Killer Queen is an amazing game.

02:16:31.980 --> 02:16:35.340
It was at MAGFest this year and it was easily the most popular arcade game in the whole

02:16:35.340 --> 02:16:36.060
weekend.

02:16:36.060 --> 02:16:39.740
But anyway, I have a lot of memories as a kid playing Turtles in Time and the Simpsons

02:16:39.740 --> 02:16:41.180
arcade game with friends.

02:16:41.180 --> 02:16:45.420
Later on, I played a lot of the grid and gauntlet legends in my teenage years, especially with

02:16:45.420 --> 02:16:47.900
the help of the saved profile functions in the game.

02:16:48.460 --> 02:16:53.660
Our buddy Jonas, our explicit, replied and said, hmm, having a group of six people, myself

02:16:53.660 --> 02:16:58.300
included, play the six player X-Men arcade game without dying during my time in the Philippines

02:16:58.300 --> 02:16:59.260
as a kid.

02:16:59.260 --> 02:17:04.060
Playing an eight player Virtua Racing in the Luxor Casino Las Vegas when they had it before

02:17:04.060 --> 02:17:09.900
the release of Daytona Racing in 1994 and the Crazy Panic Park tournaments at California

02:17:09.900 --> 02:17:10.780
Extreme.

02:17:10.780 --> 02:17:11.420
Nuff said.

02:17:12.140 --> 02:17:13.660
Last but not least, Dark Tetsuya.

02:17:14.380 --> 02:17:19.740
I think the most epic multiplayer experience has got to be Namco's Galaxian 3.

02:17:19.740 --> 02:17:24.860
Imagine six cockpit seats with a Vector Star Wars style flight controller, two giant 50

02:17:24.860 --> 02:17:27.100
inch monitors and a giant booth to house it in.

02:17:27.100 --> 02:17:29.900
I played it in Santa Cruz at the boardwalk back in the late 90s.

02:17:29.900 --> 02:17:31.420
It was amazing.

02:17:31.980 --> 02:17:32.860
Great answers, you guys.

02:17:32.860 --> 02:17:36.460
Those answers took me back and reminded me of a lot of good stuff, too.

02:17:36.460 --> 02:17:39.900
Like, again, random ass memories from when I was a kid.

02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:43.420
I went to go play Mortal Kombat 2.

02:17:43.420 --> 02:17:48.140
It was a convenience store that had Mortal Kombat 2, like a 7-Eleven type of place, more

02:17:48.140 --> 02:17:49.500
like mom and pop owned.

02:17:49.500 --> 02:17:51.660
We would go to this convenience store to play Mortal Kombat 2.

02:17:51.660 --> 02:17:53.500
It was like the only place in town that had it.

02:17:53.500 --> 02:17:55.420
Like the big arcades didn't even have it.

02:17:55.420 --> 02:17:56.060
That was always fun.

02:17:56.060 --> 02:17:59.260
Like having like a bunch of different stores around towns that would have each would have

02:17:59.260 --> 02:18:00.220
like one arcade game.

02:18:00.620 --> 02:18:02.380
We got to go play Captain Commando.

02:18:02.380 --> 02:18:04.140
Let's go to this like cafe over here.

02:18:04.140 --> 02:18:04.380
Right.

02:18:04.380 --> 02:18:05.900
And that's just going to go play Street Fighter.

02:18:05.900 --> 02:18:11.900
It's at 7-Eleven or we'd have like the one bowling alley that had the Mortal Kombat 2.

02:18:11.900 --> 02:18:12.620
Yeah, it used to.

02:18:12.620 --> 02:18:14.780
It's like slot machines in Vegas, right?

02:18:14.780 --> 02:18:16.540
You would see you go to the grocery store.

02:18:16.540 --> 02:18:17.820
Oh, there's a slot machine over there.

02:18:17.820 --> 02:18:21.100
You know, wherever you go, there's going to be gas stations, slot machines, right?

02:18:21.660 --> 02:18:24.780
It used to be like that with arcade games for a period of time in the 90s.

02:18:24.780 --> 02:18:26.380
But now it's kind of like that, right?

02:18:26.380 --> 02:18:29.580
When I moved out here, you know, right at the end of the 90s, right at the end there.

02:18:29.580 --> 02:18:32.620
And Dan and I would just, we'd do what we called our arcade circuit.

02:18:32.620 --> 02:18:37.580
We would go to Crest View Lanes because they had Air Guys.

02:18:38.220 --> 02:18:40.780
They had Blazing Star.

02:18:40.780 --> 02:18:44.220
Rest in peace, that ghetto ass bowling alley is still standing.

02:18:44.220 --> 02:18:46.380
Even though it's been closed for like five years.

02:18:47.020 --> 02:18:47.900
It makes me so sad.

02:18:47.900 --> 02:18:49.500
I just want all those games to be mine.

02:18:49.500 --> 02:18:54.300
I'm just waiting for them to get that land and make it a strip mall.

02:18:54.300 --> 02:18:55.260
You know that's what's going to happen.

02:18:55.260 --> 02:18:57.340
At least I can play Blazing Star on my iPad.

02:18:57.340 --> 02:18:57.840
That's true.

02:18:59.740 --> 02:19:00.860
Great answers, you guys.

02:19:00.860 --> 02:19:01.420
Took me back.

02:19:01.420 --> 02:19:02.220
I love it.

02:19:02.220 --> 02:19:04.860
All right, let's go back to some long news.

02:19:04.860 --> 02:19:07.420
We're having a long show tonight, but this is some good stuff tonight, guys.

02:19:08.300 --> 02:19:10.540
But some more recent stuff that's going on in gaming.

02:19:10.540 --> 02:19:11.180
Loki.

02:19:11.180 --> 02:19:11.740
Yes.

02:19:11.740 --> 02:19:20.060
So there's been a class action lawsuit against Nvidia for their new GeForce GTX 970 graphics

02:19:20.060 --> 02:19:20.300
card.

02:19:20.300 --> 02:19:23.580
Apparently it's due to false advertising.

02:19:23.580 --> 02:19:29.420
And the reason being is that people have found that since it has four gigabytes of video

02:19:29.420 --> 02:19:34.620
RAM on there, apparently when games allocate more than three and a half gigabytes of RAM,

02:19:34.620 --> 02:19:35.900
it starts to slow down.

02:19:35.900 --> 02:19:42.060
Apparently, according to the lawsuit, the last half of a gigabyte runs 80% slower than

02:19:42.060 --> 02:19:43.100
it's supposed to.

02:19:43.100 --> 02:19:47.500
And this is causing stuttering on high resolution games and whatnot.

02:19:47.500 --> 02:19:50.220
So interesting.

02:19:50.940 --> 02:19:56.940
I've been hearing, you know, just I always look into like, you know, possibly upgrading

02:19:56.940 --> 02:20:01.100
my desktop computer at one time, which is in parts right now.

02:20:01.100 --> 02:20:10.140
But, you know, I had GeForce, well, GTS 880s at one time, or not 880s, 8800s.

02:20:10.140 --> 02:20:15.020
This is before they had just the three digit cards.

02:20:15.020 --> 02:20:23.420
Anyways, also saying, though, that apparently Nvidia has acknowledged that the GTX 970 uses

02:20:23.420 --> 02:20:30.380
a different memory subsystem designed than its higher end GTX 980, but said the difference

02:20:30.380 --> 02:20:31.580
is negligible.

02:20:31.580 --> 02:20:36.300
But apparently it was something that a lot of people felt otherwise.

02:20:36.300 --> 02:20:39.660
So be interesting to see how how this ends up.

02:20:41.180 --> 02:20:41.900
I don't know.

02:20:41.900 --> 02:20:46.380
I think it kind of sucks, though, especially if, you know, these cards seem to come out

02:20:46.380 --> 02:20:50.380
so often and they keep pushing near just how much they can do.

02:20:50.380 --> 02:20:54.300
And, you know, I guess it makes for healthy competition.

02:20:54.300 --> 02:20:58.140
I guess now ATA comes out with something that works a little better than people decide to

02:20:58.140 --> 02:20:59.980
go that camp and why not?

02:20:59.980 --> 02:21:00.380
I don't know.

02:21:01.420 --> 02:21:05.820
Akuma JP in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says I'm using a GTX 970.

02:21:05.820 --> 02:21:06.700
No problem here.

02:21:06.700 --> 02:21:07.740
All ultra settings.

02:21:08.380 --> 02:21:11.100
So maybe it just depends on what I mean.

02:21:11.100 --> 02:21:13.660
That's that's the thing about building your own computer.

02:21:13.660 --> 02:21:16.540
Your own computer is that everything has to get along in the box.

02:21:16.540 --> 02:21:17.580
So you might have a serious problem.

02:21:17.580 --> 02:21:21.420
Also, I'm wondering, too, because, like, I mean, I understand you're running all ultra

02:21:21.420 --> 02:21:25.820
settings, but are you I don't know how much of the four gigabytes of video RAM seems like

02:21:25.820 --> 02:21:26.700
an awful lot.

02:21:26.700 --> 02:21:32.140
And I don't know if we're talking like, you know, 4K displays and stuff like that.

02:21:32.140 --> 02:21:33.660
Is that what you're trying to output on this?

02:21:33.660 --> 02:21:39.260
Because it seems like that most games would not use four gigabytes of video RAM.

02:21:39.260 --> 02:21:42.780
I mean, at least I think that they wouldn't, but I don't know.

02:21:42.780 --> 02:21:43.500
Maybe they would.

02:21:44.140 --> 02:21:45.740
But I think the ultra ultra.

02:21:45.740 --> 02:21:50.860
I'm thinking like, you know, this sounds to me like if you're running like ultra settings

02:21:50.860 --> 02:21:55.020
on like multiple monitors or something like that, that it would run into the situation.

02:21:55.020 --> 02:21:56.380
But I don't know.

02:21:56.380 --> 02:21:59.900
Maybe it's in once again, you know, this is something that I guess will come out, you

02:21:59.900 --> 02:22:05.340
know, if this lawsuit goes forward, that maybe it was just a batch of cards that was defective

02:22:05.340 --> 02:22:07.980
or something like that and something that they fixed.

02:22:07.980 --> 02:22:08.380
I don't know.

02:22:08.380 --> 02:22:09.660
Hopefully they work it out.

02:22:09.660 --> 02:22:15.740
We'll see how we always talk about these lawsuits and things like that.

02:22:15.740 --> 02:22:16.380
It's crazy.

02:22:17.420 --> 02:22:20.860
Rama says, fanboys in their Nvidia, Team AMD for life.

02:22:21.580 --> 02:22:25.340
Bobby Blackwolf says, I'm going to be getting a GTX when the consumer rift comes out because

02:22:25.340 --> 02:22:28.060
Nvidia works better with the Oculus stuff for whatever reason.

02:22:28.060 --> 02:22:29.980
My current AMD has issues.

02:22:30.700 --> 02:22:31.020
All right.

02:22:31.020 --> 02:22:32.460
Anyhow, let's move on.

02:22:32.460 --> 02:22:34.140
I want to talk about Yokai Watch.

02:22:34.140 --> 02:22:36.380
You know, this series is huge in Japan, right?

02:22:36.380 --> 02:22:37.100
Huge.

02:22:37.100 --> 02:22:39.980
But it, for whatever reason, hasn't shown up in America.

02:22:39.980 --> 02:22:42.940
And I think a lot of people are wondering, especially those that are a little more tuned

02:22:42.940 --> 02:22:47.100
into what's going on in the Japanese culture and what's popular over there, wondering when

02:22:47.100 --> 02:22:49.660
is Level 5 going to bring this over to the States?

02:22:49.660 --> 02:22:50.780
Well, guess what?

02:22:50.780 --> 02:22:57.100
Yokai Watch developer Level 5 has confirmed a deal to bring these 3DS games to an English

02:22:57.100 --> 02:22:57.580
audience.

02:22:58.700 --> 02:23:04.220
It's, you know, this series is kind of like Pokemon, but there's more to it than that.

02:23:05.100 --> 02:23:10.700
Anyhow, merchandising and licensing and so forth, probably something that's going to

02:23:10.700 --> 02:23:11.340
follow with this.

02:23:12.140 --> 02:23:17.180
Hasbro actually has got that with Level 5, and they're going to launch these toys in

02:23:17.180 --> 02:23:18.300
2016.

02:23:19.340 --> 02:23:22.940
They're going full throttle here in the States.

02:23:22.940 --> 02:23:27.100
Anime, comics, books, music, Monopoly boards, the games themselves.

02:23:27.100 --> 02:23:28.940
It's all happening here in the States.

02:23:28.940 --> 02:23:32.060
The Yokai Watch franchise has been hugely successful, and we are ready to bring the

02:23:32.060 --> 02:23:38.220
brand to new markets across multiple platforms, said Akihiro Hino, who is the Level 5 president.

02:23:38.220 --> 02:23:39.740
So here it is.

02:23:40.460 --> 02:23:46.220
So not just the fact that it's coming Stateside, but it's coming Stateside with bells and whistles,

02:23:46.220 --> 02:23:50.140
which that's kind of good because that tells me it's not going to be like a fringe game

02:23:50.140 --> 02:23:53.900
because sometimes when Japanese games finally come out in the US, they're hard to find.

02:23:53.900 --> 02:23:54.620
They're fringe.

02:23:54.620 --> 02:23:57.100
It's like they have one run and then they're gone.

02:23:57.820 --> 02:23:58.780
You don't find them again.

02:23:58.780 --> 02:24:03.100
So they're putting all this licensing and freaking Hasbro is behind it too.

02:24:03.100 --> 02:24:05.020
This game is not going to be hard to find.

02:24:05.020 --> 02:24:07.740
They're expecting this to be a big, big thing.

02:24:07.740 --> 02:24:11.500
Like a Yu-Gi-Oh or Naruto or something like that.

02:24:11.500 --> 02:24:12.540
So that's good to know.

02:24:12.540 --> 02:24:13.740
So here we go.

02:24:13.740 --> 02:24:14.860
I already wanted it.

02:24:14.860 --> 02:24:20.780
I would imagine E3 is going to be very telling for this, especially if I'm Nintendo and I

02:24:20.780 --> 02:24:23.340
would get people really psyched about what's coming for the 3DS.

02:24:24.700 --> 02:24:28.700
I think you can fully expect to see some of that in their Nintendo Direct at E3.

02:24:29.180 --> 02:24:30.540
Anyway, Dark Sakura.

02:24:31.260 --> 02:24:33.180
Well, things are getting serious in Australia.

02:24:33.980 --> 02:24:37.340
What's going on right now is that there was a report out from Torrent Freak

02:24:37.980 --> 02:24:41.740
that Australia is considering a three strikes copyright enforcement system.

02:24:42.860 --> 02:24:49.340
Meaning that for anyone who participates in file sharing or infringing of copyright or

02:24:49.340 --> 02:24:54.300
illegal sharing of different movies and music and things like that,

02:24:54.300 --> 02:24:57.100
there is a three strikes copyright infringement rule.

02:24:58.780 --> 02:25:01.180
They give them the three strikes and then take action.

02:25:02.460 --> 02:25:08.860
So it's just a little blurb on here says this copyright notice scheme code is designed to

02:25:08.860 --> 02:25:14.940
facilitate a cooperative industry led copyright notice scheme throughout which internet service

02:25:14.940 --> 02:25:19.580
providers and the owners of copyright works will work to deter the practice of online

02:25:19.580 --> 02:25:21.260
copyright infringement, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:25:22.620 --> 02:25:24.940
Step one is an educational notice.

02:25:24.940 --> 02:25:26.940
Step two is a warning notice.

02:25:26.940 --> 02:25:28.540
Step three is a final notice.

02:25:29.340 --> 02:25:37.900
And then each notice can be appealed with a cost of $25 Australian dollars.

02:25:38.620 --> 02:25:44.860
And if the appeal is upheld, then the fee will be refunded, which I mean,

02:25:44.860 --> 02:25:49.820
it kind of sounds fair right now, but this doesn't say what the actual

02:25:51.820 --> 02:25:54.860
punishments that are going to be used against these people are.

02:25:54.860 --> 02:25:57.740
So there's a little bit more about it on Torrent Freak.

02:25:59.500 --> 02:26:03.740
The article is, let me see if I can get the link for folks.

02:26:04.300 --> 02:26:04.540
Yeah.

02:26:04.540 --> 02:26:09.340
It's just a big, long URL on Torrent Freak, but just look up Torrent Freak and Australian

02:26:10.540 --> 02:26:12.220
ISP three strikes rule.

02:26:14.220 --> 02:26:17.980
It's a very interesting bit of information.

02:26:19.820 --> 02:26:20.140
I don't know.

02:26:20.140 --> 02:26:23.340
Good luck enforcing it is kind of where my head's at.

02:26:23.340 --> 02:26:25.020
That's sort of what I'm thinking on that one.

02:26:25.020 --> 02:26:27.580
I'm not saying that stealing is okay.

02:26:28.220 --> 02:26:35.340
If you're going to pirate things, then you have to realize that there are consequences,

02:26:35.340 --> 02:26:38.300
be it these very tangible things that they're talking about here,

02:26:38.300 --> 02:26:42.220
or just moral consequences in some ways of doing something like that.

02:26:43.100 --> 02:26:46.780
We get into a lot of gray areas and so forth, but the fact of the matter is,

02:26:46.780 --> 02:26:49.420
if you download a CD, you are stealing it.

02:26:49.420 --> 02:26:50.460
Don't copy that floppy.

02:26:50.460 --> 02:26:50.960
Right.

02:26:51.500 --> 02:26:55.340
But it's going to be very interesting to see how something like this is universally

02:26:55.340 --> 02:27:00.780
enforced without spying on people or what that comes out.

02:27:00.780 --> 02:27:04.620
I mean, how are you going to enforce that uniformly?

02:27:04.620 --> 02:27:09.100
Because that's another big thing is that you can't make an example out of one person.

02:27:09.100 --> 02:27:14.700
And a lot of people who make laws probably also download CDs illegally,

02:27:14.700 --> 02:27:16.060
or at least have a one point in their life.

02:27:16.780 --> 02:27:22.140
I'm certain that there's very few people who are that morally upstanding that they haven't done it.

02:27:22.140 --> 02:27:22.540
Right.

02:27:22.540 --> 02:27:24.140
Well, also this is Australia.

02:27:24.140 --> 02:27:28.300
So I want to say that I know there's some games over there that either don't come out

02:27:28.300 --> 02:27:30.780
because of their stupid like R18 thing.

02:27:30.780 --> 02:27:33.740
I think they finally fixed the rating system, but it's still like,

02:27:33.740 --> 02:27:34.620
I just don't know.

02:27:34.620 --> 02:27:37.660
Things have been censored for really random things in Australia.

02:27:37.660 --> 02:27:40.540
You know, again, I don't live there.

02:27:40.540 --> 02:27:42.460
Maybe we have some Australian listeners who can email us

02:27:42.460 --> 02:27:46.060
and clue us in a little more as to what the situation is really like over there.

02:27:46.060 --> 02:27:50.380
But I do remember distinctly when the new Mortal Kombat came out,

02:27:50.620 --> 02:27:53.500
not Mortal Kombat X, obviously, but Mortal Kombat 9 or whatever.

02:27:53.500 --> 02:27:58.220
Like one of my friends from Australia on Facebook posted a picture of like the disc saying,

02:27:58.220 --> 02:28:02.220
thanks so and so for mailing me a copy of this because we can't get it here in Australia.

02:28:03.900 --> 02:28:05.820
So because it was banned or whatever.

02:28:05.820 --> 02:28:07.900
And I think we talked about it on the show years ago.

02:28:07.900 --> 02:28:11.980
So, but I thought they had fixed a lot of those issues where now there is a rating,

02:28:12.540 --> 02:28:15.340
but somehow stuff still gets kind of censored.

02:28:15.340 --> 02:28:15.840
I don't know.

02:28:16.540 --> 02:28:19.580
Anyway, we're about to the mailbag.

02:28:19.580 --> 02:28:20.460
But first, Loki.

02:28:21.020 --> 02:28:21.340
Yeah.

02:28:21.340 --> 02:28:25.900
So there's a rumor that apparently the Phantom Dust developer,

02:28:25.900 --> 02:28:28.140
Dark Side Games has shut down.

02:28:28.780 --> 02:28:31.180
And this would be kind of disappointing because they were supposed to be,

02:28:31.180 --> 02:28:32.860
you know, partnering with Microsoft for this.

02:28:32.860 --> 02:28:36.300
But apparently, you know, according to a rumor, they're saying, you know,

02:28:36.300 --> 02:28:41.900
that the development of Phantom Dust or that basically their relationship has now ended.

02:28:41.900 --> 02:28:45.340
And, you know, they had a great respect for the studio and their work in the industry.

02:28:45.340 --> 02:28:49.020
But while they do not have anything to share about Phantom Dust at this time,

02:28:49.020 --> 02:28:55.180
we can confirm development of the title continues just without Dark Side, I guess.

02:28:57.500 --> 02:29:02.060
So apparently they're saying that the 50 staff members have been

02:29:03.740 --> 02:29:06.460
forced to close since they lost the Phantom Dust contract.

02:29:08.220 --> 02:29:09.900
But the game is not done with.

02:29:09.900 --> 02:29:11.420
I've never seen that as more on Twitter.

02:29:11.420 --> 02:29:15.020
The game is still coming, but this doesn't bode well.

02:29:15.020 --> 02:29:18.220
Because that means if they got the contract pulled, somebody wasn't happy with it.

02:29:18.860 --> 02:29:23.660
Not necessarily they were right in that call, but it's strange.

02:29:24.620 --> 02:29:28.380
Well, you know, I hate reporting on these layoff type of stories because, you know,

02:29:29.260 --> 02:29:33.660
one guy in a boardroom somewhere, a girl or group of people made that decision.

02:29:34.220 --> 02:29:36.860
And I don't know, it's always tough to hear about.

02:29:37.420 --> 02:29:41.900
So hopefully those folks will be able to find positions elsewhere really soon.

02:29:43.580 --> 02:29:46.860
Meanwhile, speaking of legal crap going on,

02:29:46.860 --> 02:29:49.260
this is something that came out a little earlier in the week.

02:29:49.260 --> 02:29:55.820
Do you guys remember when Bethesda was going after that game Scrolls that Mojang put out because

02:29:55.820 --> 02:30:00.060
Bethesda had the name for like Elder Scrolls and so forth?

02:30:00.060 --> 02:30:04.300
Now they ended up reaching an agreement, but some lawyers made a bunch of money off of that.

02:30:04.300 --> 02:30:08.460
Well, get this, the developer behind the indie title Fortress

02:30:08.460 --> 02:30:14.380
Fallout says that Bethesda's parent company Zenimax Media forced him to abandon the

02:30:14.380 --> 02:30:19.260
trademark for the game because of infringement with, of course, the Fallout series, which

02:30:19.260 --> 02:30:23.420
hasn't had a new game in a while, but perhaps something is being announced real soon.

02:30:23.420 --> 02:30:24.140
I don't know.

02:30:24.140 --> 02:30:28.060
But anyway, Zenimax asked in a letter that the creator, Jordan Marin,

02:30:29.340 --> 02:30:32.140
who by the way goes by CaptainSparklez on YouTube,

02:30:33.260 --> 02:30:38.700
immediately expressly abandoned the application for Fortress Fallout and cease any and all current

02:30:38.700 --> 02:30:42.700
or proposed use of any mark incorporating the term Fallout.

02:30:43.580 --> 02:30:46.780
And because, you know, again, this is just one guy.

02:30:46.780 --> 02:30:50.380
He's just complying with it because of a lack of resources.

02:30:51.020 --> 02:30:56.300
Our lawyers say that Bethesda is notoriously litigious company.

02:30:56.300 --> 02:30:59.260
Obviously, they have lots of money and resources that they're disposable,

02:30:59.260 --> 02:31:01.500
which me and my partner don't really have at the moment.

02:31:01.500 --> 02:31:04.860
So essentially we are being strong armed and having to change our name,

02:31:04.860 --> 02:31:08.300
which is unfortunate because I personally don't feel there's any confusion

02:31:08.300 --> 02:31:11.500
between Fortress Fallout and the Fallout game franchise.

02:31:12.140 --> 02:31:14.540
And certainly looking at the screenshots,

02:31:14.540 --> 02:31:18.460
there's really nothing in common with this game and Fallout.

02:31:18.460 --> 02:31:21.500
There's no game is not about nuclear fallout or anything like that.

02:31:23.340 --> 02:31:24.780
So I don't know this kind of.

02:31:26.860 --> 02:31:27.980
I mean, it's one of them.

02:31:27.980 --> 02:31:31.820
I understand he would, if they had the money to fight it, he would probably win.

02:31:31.820 --> 02:31:35.740
But at the same time, he doesn't get settled out of court, just like the scrolls thing did.

02:31:35.740 --> 02:31:37.180
Yeah, that's probably what would happen.

02:31:37.180 --> 02:31:40.540
And it's easy to point a finger and go stop being an asshole.

02:31:41.500 --> 02:31:43.580
But also there's that whole element of,

02:31:43.580 --> 02:31:46.620
well, if you don't protect a trademark, then you're at risk for losing it.

02:31:46.620 --> 02:31:50.540
So on one hand, Bethesda has the responsibility to do something like this.

02:31:50.540 --> 02:31:51.980
But then you kind of look at it and go,

02:31:51.980 --> 02:31:53.420
who gave them a trademark on the name?

02:31:54.060 --> 02:32:00.380
Just just Fallout for everything like star Fallout star for all games to begin with.

02:32:00.380 --> 02:32:03.020
I mean, that's I don't know, especially, I think,

02:32:03.020 --> 02:32:05.900
I think when it comes down to that, like you shouldn't be able to have like,

02:32:06.700 --> 02:32:09.260
you know, I shouldn't be able to make a game called Fallout.

02:32:09.260 --> 02:32:13.020
It's like, maybe do you remember it was we just had this discussion like a year ago

02:32:13.020 --> 02:32:15.980
when it was Candy Crush Saga and the Banner Saga.

02:32:15.980 --> 02:32:17.340
Like it was that whole thing again.

02:32:17.340 --> 02:32:18.860
Everybody was looking at King going,

02:32:18.860 --> 02:32:22.780
who the fuck gave them the patent or trademark, excuse me, on Saga?

02:32:22.780 --> 02:32:23.900
Like, how did they?

02:32:23.900 --> 02:32:26.060
It just needs to be a lot of reform.

02:32:26.060 --> 02:32:27.980
Yeah, but it's not going to happen.

02:32:28.780 --> 02:32:32.620
Of course, there's no duking it out with, you know, Square for Saga Frontier.

02:32:32.620 --> 02:32:33.100
Right.

02:32:33.100 --> 02:32:35.900
Well, this this just goes to show, you know, and Bobby

02:32:35.980 --> 02:32:38.300
Black was in chat saying, well, the USPTO did.

02:32:39.260 --> 02:32:42.700
Well, yes, we know how that happens, but it's kind of one of those things where it's like,

02:32:42.700 --> 02:32:46.540
okay, maybe we really need to look at some of this trademark and intellectual property

02:32:46.540 --> 02:32:49.900
in the way we do, because, you know, we haven't really modernized that very

02:32:51.260 --> 02:32:52.380
for the Internet age.

02:32:52.380 --> 02:32:55.900
And I think we're starting to see that kind of bite us in the ass a little more.

02:32:55.900 --> 02:32:56.380
I don't know.

02:32:59.420 --> 02:33:04.620
And Bobby Black Wolf pointing out Vanguard V was originally Vanguard Valkyrie until CCP

02:33:04.620 --> 02:33:07.180
came along because of Eve Valkyrie.

02:33:07.180 --> 02:33:10.540
But both were VR games that included space combat.

02:33:10.540 --> 02:33:11.980
That's a little bit more similar.

02:33:11.980 --> 02:33:12.860
That's a little.

02:33:12.860 --> 02:33:16.300
At least you can kind of look at that and go, okay, kind of see that.

02:33:16.300 --> 02:33:20.860
But, you know, when these games really don't have anything in common, it's unfortunate.

02:33:20.860 --> 02:33:21.420
Unfortunate.

02:33:23.340 --> 02:33:25.420
Anyhow, let's get to the mailbag.

02:33:25.420 --> 02:33:26.860
You guys email us every week.

02:33:26.860 --> 02:33:29.420
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:33:29.980 --> 02:33:33.660
Dark Soccer is going to dive into the mailbag and find some emails she believes are worthy

02:33:33.660 --> 02:33:35.180
of reading on the program tonight.

02:33:35.180 --> 02:33:35.900
Dark Soccer.

02:33:36.860 --> 02:33:37.900
Who's emailed us?

02:33:37.900 --> 02:33:39.820
You were wrong, because we have three emails.

02:33:39.820 --> 02:33:40.540
Three emails?

02:33:40.540 --> 02:33:41.180
There's only one.

02:33:41.180 --> 02:33:41.740
Three mail.

02:33:41.740 --> 02:33:43.180
There was only one yesterday.

02:33:43.180 --> 02:33:44.140
Three mail.

02:33:44.140 --> 02:33:45.260
Three mails.

02:33:45.260 --> 02:33:45.900
Tree mail.

02:33:45.900 --> 02:33:46.620
It's like survivor.

02:33:47.500 --> 02:33:48.780
Um, okay.

02:33:49.580 --> 02:33:51.020
This comes from Robert M.

02:33:51.020 --> 02:33:51.820
News item.

02:33:51.820 --> 02:33:54.860
YouTube personality and Minecraft fan Jordan captains.

02:33:54.860 --> 02:33:55.660
Oh, this is.

02:33:55.660 --> 02:33:57.100
Oh, is this the story I just read?

02:33:57.100 --> 02:33:57.340
It is.

02:33:57.340 --> 02:33:57.820
Never mind.

02:33:57.820 --> 02:33:58.380
How funny.

02:33:59.580 --> 02:34:01.340
I will skip them past all of that.

02:34:01.340 --> 02:34:01.580
Okay.

02:34:02.300 --> 02:34:06.460
Regarding last week's FUGL topic, I'm surprised nobody mentioned Rocky's Boots.

02:34:06.460 --> 02:34:09.900
I used to play with that at Science Center Lab all the time.

02:34:09.900 --> 02:34:13.660
I also saw Cosmic Osmo there long before missed.

02:34:13.660 --> 02:34:14.540
Still busy at work.

02:34:14.540 --> 02:34:18.220
Should be able to take time to back up things on my PS3.

02:34:18.220 --> 02:34:21.020
Cloud save and put in a repair ticket soon.

02:34:21.020 --> 02:34:21.820
Trademark.

02:34:21.820 --> 02:34:22.460
Quote fingers.

02:34:23.020 --> 02:34:23.420
Period.

02:34:25.740 --> 02:34:26.860
I mentioned Rocky's Boots.

02:34:26.860 --> 02:34:27.580
I love that game.

02:34:28.300 --> 02:34:31.580
If I didn't mention on last week's show, I certainly mentioned it in the past month at

02:34:31.580 --> 02:34:31.900
some point.

02:34:31.900 --> 02:34:33.100
I remember talking about it on the show.

02:34:33.100 --> 02:34:33.980
I love that game.

02:34:33.980 --> 02:34:34.480
Love it.

02:34:35.820 --> 02:34:36.460
Next email.

02:34:36.460 --> 02:34:36.960
Yep.

02:34:37.580 --> 02:34:39.260
I was excited to hear.

02:34:40.540 --> 02:34:43.580
Here is H-E-A-R, not H-E-R-E.

02:34:43.580 --> 02:34:45.180
About last week's forum topic.

02:34:45.180 --> 02:34:47.340
Classic Edutational Games.

02:34:47.340 --> 02:34:50.300
Though I wish someone would have mentioned my favorite robot odyssey.

02:34:50.300 --> 02:34:54.700
It was from around the same time as Oregon Trail and it was like a super advanced Rocky's

02:34:54.700 --> 02:34:55.260
Boots.

02:34:55.260 --> 02:34:59.180
The protagonist falls into robotropolis and has to find his way out.

02:34:59.180 --> 02:35:01.900
You can go inside robots and inside computer chips.

02:35:02.860 --> 02:35:03.820
Sorry, my neck.

02:35:04.460 --> 02:35:06.140
Once any of these you...

02:35:07.100 --> 02:35:07.580
Okay.

02:35:07.580 --> 02:35:11.340
Once inside any of these, you design all the logic circuits that tell a robot how to move

02:35:11.340 --> 02:35:14.380
around, how to use its sensors and pick things up, et cetera.

02:35:15.660 --> 02:35:19.900
I was only about eight when I first tried to play it, but what I learned about logic

02:35:19.900 --> 02:35:22.460
gates, flip flops, et cetera, stuck with me.

02:35:22.460 --> 02:35:24.540
It's even available now via emulation.

02:35:24.620 --> 02:35:27.420
Thanks for reminding me about this great game and keep lounging.

02:35:27.420 --> 02:35:28.780
That's from Salmonax.

02:35:30.540 --> 02:35:32.780
I vaguely remember that game.

02:35:32.780 --> 02:35:37.980
I think that was another MECC game, I think, who made a lot of those.

02:35:37.980 --> 02:35:38.300
What was it?

02:35:38.300 --> 02:35:41.020
It was like Minnesota Entertainment.

02:35:41.020 --> 02:35:45.260
I don't remember what it stood for, but I know MECC made a lot of those classic games

02:35:45.260 --> 02:35:49.820
like Oregon Trail and Number Munchers and all those games and Rocky's Boots, I believe.

02:35:49.820 --> 02:35:51.500
So I wonder if that was another one of their titles.

02:35:52.940 --> 02:35:53.660
Sounds familiar.

02:35:53.660 --> 02:35:54.220
Last email.

02:35:54.220 --> 02:35:55.260
It's called Email Plus One.

02:35:56.540 --> 02:35:58.780
In case you don't have any emails tonight, here's one for you.

02:35:58.780 --> 02:35:59.180
Smile.

02:35:59.180 --> 02:35:59.500
Cheers.

02:35:59.500 --> 02:35:59.980
Andy R.

02:36:01.260 --> 02:36:02.140
That's it?

02:36:02.140 --> 02:36:02.940
That's it?

02:36:02.940 --> 02:36:03.340
Yeah.

02:36:03.340 --> 02:36:03.820
Cheers.

02:36:04.780 --> 02:36:05.260
Here you go.

02:36:05.260 --> 02:36:05.660
Well, thank you.

02:36:05.660 --> 02:36:06.300
Thank you.

02:36:06.300 --> 02:36:10.140
Thank you for just leaving a safety net in there just in case.

02:36:10.140 --> 02:36:13.820
Luckily, we had a couple other emails in there to fill out the sack, but...

02:36:13.820 --> 02:36:14.700
Very kind of you.

02:36:14.700 --> 02:36:15.260
Very kind.

02:36:15.260 --> 02:36:15.740
Yes.

02:36:15.740 --> 02:36:16.140
Cheers.

02:36:16.940 --> 02:36:17.580
You know what?

02:36:17.580 --> 02:36:18.220
I love that.

02:36:18.220 --> 02:36:19.340
Just getting an email.

02:36:19.340 --> 02:36:20.220
Just wanted to say hey.

02:36:21.500 --> 02:36:22.940
I just want to get an email that goes,

02:36:22.940 --> 02:36:23.740
sup bitches.

02:36:24.940 --> 02:36:25.820
And then I'll know you.

02:36:25.820 --> 02:36:29.260
You do know that grandpa stole that and he uses that on Hoard House every week now.

02:36:29.260 --> 02:36:29.660
Really?

02:36:29.660 --> 02:36:30.300
Yeah.

02:36:30.300 --> 02:36:31.580
He stole my sup bitches?

02:36:31.580 --> 02:36:32.940
You should charge him a quarter.

02:36:33.500 --> 02:36:34.700
You just have me on the show.

02:36:36.220 --> 02:36:36.620
We can.

02:36:36.620 --> 02:36:37.580
We should have you on the show.

02:36:37.580 --> 02:36:38.460
I mean, Becky.

02:36:38.460 --> 02:36:41.500
We just had a sill residency on Hoard House.

02:36:41.500 --> 02:36:42.380
She did two weeks.

02:36:42.380 --> 02:36:43.900
She did because she's been on vacation.

02:36:43.900 --> 02:36:47.180
So she did two weeks on Hoard House and she was fabulous.

02:36:47.180 --> 02:36:49.740
I mean, I mean, this, his Star Trek thing.

02:36:50.300 --> 02:36:51.740
Oh, you want to go on a Star Trek show?

02:36:51.740 --> 02:36:55.340
Because Becky and I have been like talking DS9 like over the past three weeks.

02:36:55.340 --> 02:36:58.620
Oh, well, grandpa make it so.

02:36:59.660 --> 02:37:00.220
Engage.

02:37:00.860 --> 02:37:01.820
I wonder if he's still listening.

02:37:01.820 --> 02:37:02.140
I don't know.

02:37:02.140 --> 02:37:05.500
It was in chat earlier, but, uh, he might've left to go poop or something.

02:37:05.500 --> 02:37:05.900
I don't know.

02:37:05.900 --> 02:37:06.540
That's what he does.

02:37:07.100 --> 02:37:07.500
All right.

02:37:07.500 --> 02:37:09.900
Actually, we have things we need to work on, Rob.

02:37:09.900 --> 02:37:10.380
Yeah.

02:37:10.380 --> 02:37:10.620
All right.

02:37:10.620 --> 02:37:12.140
We've sort of been throwing around.

02:37:13.100 --> 02:37:14.380
Like poop on a doorstep.

02:37:15.500 --> 02:37:16.780
That's it for the mailbag tonight, right?

02:37:17.340 --> 02:37:17.580
Yeah.

02:37:17.580 --> 02:37:18.060
Yeah.

02:37:18.060 --> 02:37:21.260
Participate at orange lounge radio.com.

02:37:21.340 --> 02:37:22.460
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:37:38.620 --> 02:37:47.020
Um, FU goes to my muse for being, uh, rabid and making me want to work on my story all

02:37:47.020 --> 02:37:47.500
the time.

02:37:48.300 --> 02:37:51.900
But at the same time, thank you to all of the people who have given me valuable feedback

02:37:51.900 --> 02:37:53.260
and make me feel like a rock star.

02:37:53.260 --> 02:37:54.060
So thanks.

02:37:56.300 --> 02:38:02.300
Uh, just FU, I guess, to lack of sleep I've been giving myself for the last two months.

02:38:03.180 --> 02:38:06.220
Hopefully I'll catch up on sleep or maybe not.

02:38:08.220 --> 02:38:11.900
Uh, my view of the week goes to my back cause it's been randomly hurting and you know what

02:38:11.900 --> 02:38:12.540
I blame?

02:38:12.540 --> 02:38:18.300
I think, I think I just need a new bed because I've had that bed since it's been a while.

02:38:18.300 --> 02:38:23.020
The bed I have, I've had probably since like seven or eight years.

02:38:23.020 --> 02:38:24.060
So I'm ready for a new bed.

02:38:24.620 --> 02:38:25.260
Talk to me.

02:38:25.260 --> 02:38:30.860
I have, um, Dan and I, when we bought ours, we did things a really smart way and I will

02:38:30.860 --> 02:38:31.420
share it with you.

02:38:31.420 --> 02:38:31.740
Okay.

02:38:31.740 --> 02:38:32.300
Sounds good.

02:38:32.940 --> 02:38:35.580
That's something we're in the market for soonish.

02:38:35.580 --> 02:38:38.060
I think we, Alan and I talked about it anyway.

02:38:38.060 --> 02:38:40.700
Cause uh, I will say a thank you.

02:38:40.700 --> 02:38:44.780
As of this month, that brand new washer and dryer that we have out there in the garage,

02:38:44.780 --> 02:38:46.860
those brand new front loaders paid off.

02:38:47.420 --> 02:38:48.060
I own them.

02:38:49.260 --> 02:38:49.980
Thumb.

02:38:49.980 --> 02:38:50.700
Exactly.

02:38:50.700 --> 02:38:52.140
Responsibility.

02:38:52.140 --> 02:38:53.020
Congratulations.

02:38:53.020 --> 02:38:53.820
You own a washer.

02:38:53.820 --> 02:38:54.460
You're an adult.

02:38:55.580 --> 02:38:56.460
I should get a star.

02:38:56.460 --> 02:38:59.980
And here's your dryer and your washer and here's a fridge.

02:39:00.620 --> 02:39:01.660
Happy adulthood.

02:39:01.660 --> 02:39:02.700
Oh man.

02:39:02.700 --> 02:39:04.540
Go on The Price is Right and win some new ones.

02:39:04.540 --> 02:39:05.260
All right.

02:39:05.260 --> 02:39:07.900
Uh, let's get to just a couple more stories for you guys.

02:39:07.900 --> 02:39:12.620
And then we're going to get to the Skype line at one eight seven seven game OLR or our username

02:39:12.620 --> 02:39:14.620
on Skype, orange lounge radio.

02:39:14.620 --> 02:39:18.460
That's all one word, orange lounge radio, but first Loki.

02:39:19.100 --> 02:39:21.500
So you may hear the words, I'm not dead yet.

02:39:22.140 --> 02:39:27.020
And in reference to, um, the last guardian, but a lot of people still don't believe that.

02:39:27.020 --> 02:39:33.900
But Sony is once again, confirm me that yes, even though we just failed to, we've abandoned

02:39:33.900 --> 02:39:35.580
the trademark for the last guardian.

02:39:35.580 --> 02:39:36.940
It's still in development.

02:39:36.940 --> 02:39:37.820
We promise.

02:39:37.820 --> 02:39:40.060
Swear it's still being made.

02:39:40.060 --> 02:39:44.620
It's just the makers of the guardian legend sued us for trademark infringement.

02:39:44.620 --> 02:39:46.620
So we had to abandon that trademark.

02:39:47.180 --> 02:39:49.580
What if the game were to come back with a new name?

02:39:49.580 --> 02:39:50.080
It might.

02:39:51.180 --> 02:39:56.300
I mean, that's like something that I don't think anybody asked, like why?

02:39:56.300 --> 02:39:58.460
Maybe somebody did, but I just didn't see it on Twitter or anything.

02:39:58.460 --> 02:40:03.580
Like what if it's as simple as the game just has a new name for whatever creative reason?

02:40:03.580 --> 02:40:05.100
Shadow of the Colossus 2.

02:40:05.100 --> 02:40:07.100
It's, it's been in development this long.

02:40:08.620 --> 02:40:12.060
Are you really going to care if they change the name into something else, you know, to

02:40:12.060 --> 02:40:12.540
match the vision?

02:40:12.540 --> 02:40:16.300
It would be pretty bad-ass if it was Shadow of the Colossus 2, where he rides around on

02:40:16.300 --> 02:40:21.180
that other, you know, giant, you know, dog, dragon, griffin, whatever the fuck that thing

02:40:21.180 --> 02:40:23.020
is, and like fights other.

02:40:23.020 --> 02:40:25.580
I just would like to know, like, what's the fucking status?

02:40:25.580 --> 02:40:26.300
That's all I wanted.

02:40:26.300 --> 02:40:27.340
What's the fucking status of that game?

02:40:27.340 --> 02:40:30.940
And if it's not Shadow of the Colossus 2, can I just get a Shadow of the Colossus 2?

02:40:30.940 --> 02:40:34.460
Because I would be down with that as well, because imagine how big the Colossus, you

02:40:34.460 --> 02:40:38.060
know, they could be so much bigger, and it'd be so much more epic.

02:40:38.060 --> 02:40:41.180
And imagine taking down, you know, them with a group of people.

02:40:41.180 --> 02:40:44.060
But then again, we're starting to get into Monster Hunter territory at that point.

02:40:45.340 --> 02:40:49.580
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, the Last Guardian broke your heart, just like I said it would,

02:40:49.580 --> 02:40:50.860
or just as I said it would.

02:40:50.860 --> 02:40:53.900
The Last Guardian is really Frog Fractions 2.

02:40:55.900 --> 02:40:56.860
I'm okay with that.

02:40:56.860 --> 02:40:58.380
I, I'm totally okay with that.

02:40:58.380 --> 02:40:59.820
I'm also, I see it also be okay.

02:40:59.820 --> 02:41:01.580
What fucking happened to Frog Fractions 2?

02:41:01.580 --> 02:41:02.140
Wasn't there like a giant Kickstarter?

02:41:02.140 --> 02:41:03.260
No one's found it yet.

02:41:04.620 --> 02:41:07.580
Doesn't, didn't he have to share it with Kickstarter backers or something?

02:41:07.580 --> 02:41:08.540
Wasn't that part of the thing?

02:41:08.540 --> 02:41:09.420
No, he hasn't.

02:41:09.420 --> 02:41:11.020
It's just that no one's found it yet.

02:41:11.820 --> 02:41:16.380
If you just say Frog Fractions on Twitter, the creator will like favorite your tweet.

02:41:16.380 --> 02:41:19.980
Like I found this out, like every time I've said something about Frog Fractions, like

02:41:19.980 --> 02:41:21.260
the creator favorites the tweet.

02:41:21.260 --> 02:41:24.940
Like, you know, he's running tweet deck and he has like a Frog Fractions column or something

02:41:24.940 --> 02:41:26.780
that every time somebody mentions that game.

02:41:27.340 --> 02:41:30.220
So I just, I would, I, I hope it shows up soon.

02:41:30.220 --> 02:41:32.060
I'll start mentioning it every day now.

02:41:32.060 --> 02:41:35.660
No, but, uh, I would like to know what happened to Frog Fractions 2.

02:41:35.660 --> 02:41:37.820
Maybe that could be the order 1886.

02:41:39.260 --> 02:41:43.100
All of a sudden, you know, like 30 days in, we're going to get some frogs appearing.

02:41:45.980 --> 02:41:47.980
It isn't just five hours long.

02:41:47.980 --> 02:41:49.100
It's Frog Fractions.

02:41:49.100 --> 02:41:54.860
Uh, Sega is clarifying in chat that no, only when the gig is up, apparently is, is the

02:41:54.860 --> 02:41:58.300
thing is where the, the Kickstarter backers get it on that.

02:41:58.300 --> 02:41:58.700
All right.

02:41:58.700 --> 02:42:03.020
Anyhow, last but not least tonight, one more story for you guys.

02:42:03.020 --> 02:42:08.460
And, um, I had to pick this one because what better note to end on tonight than something

02:42:08.460 --> 02:42:11.180
completely self-referential.

02:42:11.180 --> 02:42:14.460
After all, last week was President's Day.

02:42:14.460 --> 02:42:19.260
After all, President's Day was on a Monday and you got to love games journalism sites.

02:42:19.260 --> 02:42:20.140
God bless them.

02:42:20.140 --> 02:42:24.700
They'll find anything remotely related to a video game to run a story and get some clicks.

02:42:24.940 --> 02:42:29.420
But I am totally okay with this one because Destructoid ran an article on President's

02:42:29.420 --> 02:42:32.940
Day called We Salute You, President Cat.

02:42:32.940 --> 02:42:38.700
And it actually said, Sukiban Shacharina, also known as President Cat, was one of those games

02:42:38.700 --> 02:42:41.340
destined to never leave Japan despite our pleas.

02:42:41.340 --> 02:42:44.780
Back in 2009, Western fans petitioned for a localization.

02:42:45.420 --> 02:42:46.140
Who could that be?

02:42:47.260 --> 02:42:51.500
But this mini game collection about a CEO cat was perhaps ahead of its time.

02:42:51.500 --> 02:42:52.940
It sold miserably.

02:42:52.940 --> 02:42:55.740
No matter, our love for Rina is unwavering.

02:42:55.740 --> 02:42:56.620
Just look at that face.

02:42:56.620 --> 02:42:57.740
That was a whole article right there.

02:42:57.740 --> 02:42:58.540
Poor Rina.

02:42:58.540 --> 02:43:02.380
Sorry I just read the whole damn thing on air, but, you know, props to Destructoid.

02:43:02.380 --> 02:43:06.860
Go give him a click for running that article because that just made me giggle because I

02:43:06.860 --> 02:43:08.460
thought back to when we did that.

02:43:09.100 --> 02:43:14.380
President Cat is not the literal translation of that name, right?

02:43:14.380 --> 02:43:16.540
Sukiban is like a female delinquent.

02:43:17.340 --> 02:43:22.620
Shacho is like a corporate leader, if I remember correctly, like a president of a company or

02:43:22.620 --> 02:43:23.180
CEO.

02:43:23.180 --> 02:43:26.300
So you have basically delinquent bitch in charge.

02:43:27.260 --> 02:43:28.220
Rina.

02:43:28.220 --> 02:43:32.620
And I don't think HBIC cat has that same ring to it.

02:43:33.180 --> 02:43:34.940
The head bitch cat.

02:43:34.940 --> 02:43:37.260
Although, I kind of like that now.

02:43:38.460 --> 02:43:39.500
It's a different year.

02:43:39.500 --> 02:43:41.340
2015, the atmosphere is different.

02:43:41.340 --> 02:43:43.500
An unspayed female cat is called a queen.

02:43:45.100 --> 02:43:48.380
So anyway, the point is, I'm loving it.

02:43:48.940 --> 02:43:54.300
Essentially, Dark Soccer, you said, and you were the one who was like, so it's like President

02:43:54.300 --> 02:43:54.620
Cat.

02:43:54.620 --> 02:43:56.700
And then we all took the ball and ran with it.

02:43:56.700 --> 02:43:58.700
We're like, President Cat, yes.

02:43:58.700 --> 02:43:59.660
Vote President Cat.

02:43:59.660 --> 02:44:01.900
Who wouldn't fucking play a game called President Cat?

02:44:01.900 --> 02:44:07.980
And now, like, the accepted Western name of this game is President Cat.

02:44:07.980 --> 02:44:09.420
Everyone, you're welcome.

02:44:09.420 --> 02:44:13.660
I wonder if someone were to put out a game similar to that called President Cat if they

02:44:13.660 --> 02:44:15.340
could be sued by that company.

02:44:15.340 --> 02:44:16.700
Well, I think that company went under.

02:44:17.660 --> 02:44:27.420
You know what, President Cat Bankrupt Company, we need to talk to you and Bobby and a few

02:44:27.420 --> 02:44:27.980
people.

02:44:27.980 --> 02:44:29.100
And Steve, get Steve back.

02:44:29.100 --> 02:44:30.380
And we'll get Steve back.

02:44:30.380 --> 02:44:32.300
Well, I still need a CEO for my game.

02:44:32.300 --> 02:44:35.660
And it was going to be a dog CEO, but I can be swayed.

02:44:35.660 --> 02:44:38.380
Akuma JP in chat says, but the game was horrible.

02:44:38.380 --> 02:44:43.500
Now, wait a minute, because even if the game only sold 100 copies, which, by the way, I

02:44:43.500 --> 02:44:47.500
want to see the receipts, because that story was ran on some website.

02:44:47.500 --> 02:44:49.820
But where was the receipts to prove that?

02:44:49.820 --> 02:44:51.260
Because I have a copy.

02:44:51.260 --> 02:44:55.900
Considering we got people here in the States to import that game.

02:44:55.900 --> 02:44:57.580
Loki bought that game.

02:44:57.580 --> 02:45:03.420
Like, was OLR really responsible for, like, 10% of the sales of this game?

02:45:03.420 --> 02:45:05.260
Because I kind of don't think that's the case.

02:45:05.260 --> 02:45:10.220
Like, I'm not that stuck on myself with this program that I think we had that big of an

02:45:10.220 --> 02:45:10.700
impact.

02:45:11.420 --> 02:45:17.020
See, I think that we should do our own President Cat and have it just full of OLR in jokes

02:45:17.020 --> 02:45:18.300
and just crazy shit.

02:45:19.020 --> 02:45:27.180
But we would be remiss if we didn't have a nod to one of the greatest Sukeban characters

02:45:27.180 --> 02:45:30.940
ever who used to beat people up with yo-yos.

02:45:30.940 --> 02:45:35.260
But the point was, just to remind everybody, the game wasn't that bad.

02:45:35.900 --> 02:45:40.620
It was a little silly, but you played a cat in minigames.

02:45:40.620 --> 02:45:45.340
Like, the Incredible Crisis.

02:45:45.340 --> 02:45:47.500
It was like an Incredible Crisis, but with a cat.

02:45:47.500 --> 02:45:48.700
And it was funny.

02:45:48.700 --> 02:45:54.060
And we played it, because Loki imported it, and we had a region-free Wii, and we checked

02:45:54.060 --> 02:45:54.860
that out, and it was fun.

02:45:54.860 --> 02:45:57.180
I need to region mod my Wii so I can play that game.

02:45:57.180 --> 02:45:58.460
Yeah, it was a lot of fun.

02:45:59.340 --> 02:46:04.540
And remember, the whole point behind that was, they were putting shit out on shelves.

02:46:04.940 --> 02:46:11.580
You know, Barbie's jewel-collecting adventures, and shitty Flash game adapted for Wii Part

02:46:11.580 --> 02:46:12.940
2 types of things.

02:46:12.940 --> 02:46:17.500
There was so much shovelware on the Wii, I think the point behind that whole rant in

02:46:17.500 --> 02:46:23.660
the first place was, why can't we get an awesome concept like this, with all this poo-poo

02:46:23.660 --> 02:46:27.100
crap-crap that's out on the Wii, that in 2009, there was a lot of crap.

02:46:27.100 --> 02:46:30.700
You can't tell me if that game came over here, that people wouldn't eat that up.

02:46:31.660 --> 02:46:33.500
Because, people love cats.

02:46:33.500 --> 02:46:38.300
People love cats doing anything, especially if it came out around the time, was it, that

02:46:38.300 --> 02:46:40.460
was 2009, why couldn't, you know.

02:46:41.340 --> 02:46:45.660
At least Destructoid's on our side, because that's not the first time they ran a President

02:46:45.660 --> 02:46:46.380
Cat story.

02:46:46.380 --> 02:46:49.340
I think they ran a President Cat story when it first happened, and I want to say President

02:46:49.340 --> 02:46:53.580
Cat came up again on their site, when they were talking about, because like, remember

02:46:53.580 --> 02:46:53.740
how-

02:46:53.740 --> 02:46:56.220
It was Wii games that were kicked off, you know.

02:46:56.220 --> 02:47:00.300
It was Operation Rainfall, what should they focus on next, type of thing, because you

02:47:00.300 --> 02:47:03.100
know, everything that was on their wish list, they got, right?

02:47:03.100 --> 02:47:09.180
Was Xenoblade, and not Last Guardian, you didn't get that last story, and Pandora's

02:47:09.180 --> 02:47:12.700
Tower or whatever, so they got all those games, I think there was an article like, what should

02:47:12.700 --> 02:47:15.900
they do now, and President Cat was one of those games.

02:47:15.900 --> 02:47:16.700
So, anyway.

02:47:18.700 --> 02:47:19.740
Just wanted to throw that out there.

02:47:21.100 --> 02:47:21.660
Good times.

02:47:22.220 --> 02:47:23.740
Let's do it, let's open the Skype line.

02:47:23.740 --> 02:47:28.220
1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:47:28.220 --> 02:47:32.220
Don't be shy, if you want to get in, call now, because we're not going to have the opportunity

02:47:32.220 --> 02:47:36.220
open very long, since it's already midnight on the East Coast, 9 o'clock here on the West

02:47:36.220 --> 02:47:37.580
Coast, but we've had a good long show tonight.

02:47:38.220 --> 02:47:40.940
I will go around the room and check if there's any last minute stories while we wait to see

02:47:40.940 --> 02:47:42.460
if Skype lights up at all.

02:47:42.460 --> 02:47:42.860
Loki?

02:47:44.700 --> 02:47:45.020
Nope.

02:47:45.580 --> 02:47:46.700
No last minute stories?

02:47:46.700 --> 02:47:50.620
I don't have any unfortunately, and I was looking too, I was trying to find something.

02:47:50.620 --> 02:47:51.580
We're trying?

02:47:51.580 --> 02:47:56.060
Alright, that's okay, because we do have a call coming in, so let's get to our calls

02:47:56.060 --> 02:47:56.540
tonight.

02:47:56.620 --> 02:47:58.060
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:47:58.860 --> 02:47:59.900
Hey, this is Akdeft.

02:47:59.900 --> 02:48:01.340
Hey, Akdeft, what's on your mind, buddy?

02:48:02.460 --> 02:48:06.300
Well, I have a lot of stuff on my mind, like President Cat.

02:48:06.300 --> 02:48:08.460
Remember when Joystiq ran the article, too?

02:48:08.460 --> 02:48:09.180
I do.

02:48:09.180 --> 02:48:10.460
Wasn't that your fault?

02:48:10.460 --> 02:48:10.700
Yeah.

02:48:12.700 --> 02:48:15.100
Yeah, you emailed them the tip or something, right?

02:48:15.820 --> 02:48:21.340
Yeah, I think I emailed them an article you wrote on the old OLR page.

02:48:21.340 --> 02:48:23.500
Oh yeah, back when I actually had articles on that site.

02:48:23.500 --> 02:48:23.900
Yeah, yeah.

02:48:24.620 --> 02:48:30.380
Because I seem to recall our tweets, I mean, this is again, this is like six years ago

02:48:30.380 --> 02:48:35.820
at this point, believe it or not, our tweets to the company were getting read, and they

02:48:35.820 --> 02:48:40.940
started, they basically were doing the very Japanese humble equivalent of, what the fuck

02:48:40.940 --> 02:48:43.980
is happening right now, type of thing on their Twitter.

02:48:43.980 --> 02:48:47.900
And so I remember writing an article at Orange Lounge Radio about like, here's what's going

02:48:47.900 --> 02:48:49.900
on and why we're all trying to get President Cat.

02:48:49.900 --> 02:48:50.620
And they took our hashtag.

02:48:51.260 --> 02:48:52.540
Yeah, they took our hashtag.

02:48:53.100 --> 02:48:54.540
They called it President Cat.

02:48:55.340 --> 02:48:56.940
So that was, I loved it.

02:48:56.940 --> 02:48:57.500
I loved it.

02:48:57.500 --> 02:49:01.740
So yeah, and then you went to Joystiq with that, and then I'm sure a ton of other sites

02:49:01.740 --> 02:49:02.780
kind of copy paste from there.

02:49:03.740 --> 02:49:08.220
In the 13 year history of this show, that's like the one thing that went viral.

02:49:09.580 --> 02:49:10.220
Yeah.

02:49:10.220 --> 02:49:13.340
That and something that got us a cease and desist from Namco, but we won't go there.

02:49:15.420 --> 02:49:22.300
Oh, well, anyways, I wanted to talk about another thing coming up soon in a few weeks.

02:49:23.180 --> 02:49:31.500
That I'm going to Mexico City, to what it's called the Distrito Pedal here, to the Zelda

02:49:31.500 --> 02:49:33.740
Symphony of the Goddess concert.

02:49:33.740 --> 02:49:34.140
Nice.

02:49:34.700 --> 02:49:36.380
And I'm pretty excited about it.

02:49:37.580 --> 02:49:43.260
Last year, they, well, not last year, like two years ago, but it wasn't, I think December,

02:49:43.260 --> 02:49:44.940
so more or less.

02:49:45.900 --> 02:49:52.940
Friends from over there from Mexico City went and they talk really good stuff about it.

02:49:53.660 --> 02:49:59.420
And they pretty much told me, you have to come, you have to go and see the concert.

02:49:59.420 --> 02:50:04.220
You have to listen and you have to pretty much live the experience.

02:50:04.220 --> 02:50:12.380
So yeah, eventually I did promise them that if Zelda of the Goddess concert would return

02:50:12.380 --> 02:50:13.820
to Mexico, I would go.

02:50:14.540 --> 02:50:19.100
And yeah, the return, it's going to be in Monterrey also.

02:50:19.980 --> 02:50:23.580
And in Mexico City, I'm going to, again, the Mexico City concert.

02:50:23.580 --> 02:50:32.700
And yeah, again, I'm pretty excited to just go there and hear all the songs and pretty

02:50:32.700 --> 02:50:35.740
much live the, sorry, live the experience.

02:50:36.860 --> 02:50:38.540
I'm really excited for you.

02:50:38.540 --> 02:50:42.300
I wish I was able to go see, it's going to be in San Jose, or I think I might have just

02:50:42.300 --> 02:50:42.620
missed it.

02:50:42.620 --> 02:50:46.540
Like it was just here and I wanted to go see it, but just, you know, there's so much other

02:50:46.540 --> 02:50:47.180
stuff going on.

02:50:47.180 --> 02:50:48.460
I don't always get out to everything.

02:50:48.460 --> 02:50:55.340
So, but I'm excited to hear that you're going and to get a little wrap up here on the show

02:50:55.340 --> 02:50:55.820
afterwards.

02:50:56.700 --> 02:50:57.420
Yeah, definitely.

02:50:57.420 --> 02:51:05.100
When, well, when I go to the concert, I will eventually, well, talk to you guys and probably

02:51:05.100 --> 02:51:07.500
write an article for the Vlog Network.

02:51:07.500 --> 02:51:07.820
Yeah.

02:51:07.820 --> 02:51:08.540
It'd be awesome.

02:51:08.540 --> 02:51:11.500
The return to, I love that song, hopefully.

02:51:13.100 --> 02:51:13.660
Love it.

02:51:13.660 --> 02:51:18.780
Hey, I got to ask while you're on the line, the Wii U had kind of a big release this week.

02:51:18.780 --> 02:51:20.460
Surely you have something to say about it?

02:51:21.340 --> 02:51:22.380
More or less, yeah.

02:51:23.660 --> 02:51:29.660
Yeah, of course, if you know me and have listened to the show for many years, you know, I love

02:51:29.660 --> 02:51:33.420
Kirby and yeah, I did get Kirby and the Rainbow Course.

02:51:33.420 --> 02:51:34.140
And how is it?

02:51:34.780 --> 02:51:39.820
It's not, well, I don't know how I can put it.

02:51:39.820 --> 02:51:40.700
It's good.

02:51:40.700 --> 02:51:41.100
Definitely.

02:51:41.100 --> 02:51:41.740
It's good.

02:51:41.740 --> 02:51:43.260
If you like Kirby, you'll love this.

02:51:44.300 --> 02:51:47.660
If you like Canvas Course, you'll definitely love this also.

02:51:48.460 --> 02:51:55.180
But I don't know how to put it yet because I have only played the first world.

02:51:56.140 --> 02:51:58.860
Well, basically the first three levels and a boss.

02:51:59.820 --> 02:52:08.780
So the game, I don't know if I can compare it to Canvas Course, but it's definitely the

02:52:08.780 --> 02:52:09.500
same mechanic.

02:52:10.140 --> 02:52:12.460
But it feels completely different.

02:52:12.460 --> 02:52:13.980
Also, it's really weird.

02:52:14.860 --> 02:52:16.620
I'm definitely loving it.

02:52:17.500 --> 02:52:21.740
And I pretty much, yes, playing this on multiplayer.

02:52:21.740 --> 02:52:23.900
multiplayer makes the experience way better.

02:52:25.180 --> 02:52:29.740
Interesting that you hesitated there a little bit, though, because a lot of people on Twitter

02:52:29.740 --> 02:52:31.260
are really eating this game up.

02:52:31.260 --> 02:52:32.460
So I was really surprised.

02:52:32.460 --> 02:52:34.540
I would have thought you'd be falling right in line with that.

02:52:34.540 --> 02:52:36.940
But maybe you just have to give it a little more.

02:52:36.940 --> 02:52:38.300
And you said you only played the first world.

02:52:38.300 --> 02:52:42.220
So maybe it'll start to really hook you a little later on.

02:52:42.220 --> 02:52:46.220
Yeah, I've been busy with other stuff and work.

02:52:46.220 --> 02:52:49.340
And I haven't been able to play a lot of games.

02:52:49.340 --> 02:52:54.860
I have my Doris Mask still wrapped in Spox and Monster Hunter 2.

02:52:54.860 --> 02:52:55.820
I know how it goes.

02:52:55.820 --> 02:52:56.700
I know how it goes.

02:52:56.700 --> 02:52:59.580
So yeah, I barely made some time to play Kirby.

02:52:59.580 --> 02:53:01.660
But again, it's good.

02:53:03.020 --> 02:53:06.300
For the $40 you pay for the game, it's definitely great.

02:53:07.020 --> 02:53:10.460
It's definitely something anyone should check out, at least.

02:53:11.980 --> 02:53:17.180
But again, if you're looking for something like Canvas Course, it's kind of like that,

02:53:17.180 --> 02:53:19.260
but not exactly like that.

02:53:19.260 --> 02:53:21.100
So again, it's weird.

02:53:21.820 --> 02:53:22.300
But yeah.

02:53:22.860 --> 02:53:23.340
All right.

02:53:23.980 --> 02:53:26.380
Well, I'm gonna let you go so we can get some more calls.

02:53:26.380 --> 02:53:27.500
But thanks for the call.

02:53:27.500 --> 02:53:28.460
Hey, thanks for having me.

02:53:28.460 --> 02:53:30.300
And hope you have more time to play Kirby this week.

02:53:31.100 --> 02:53:31.740
I'll try.

02:53:31.740 --> 02:53:32.620
All right, take care, buddy.

02:53:33.420 --> 02:53:33.980
Thanks.

02:53:33.980 --> 02:53:37.500
All right, 1877 game OLR or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:53:37.500 --> 02:53:39.660
But the phone is lighting right back up.

02:53:39.660 --> 02:53:40.780
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:53:40.780 --> 02:53:41.180
Who's this?

02:53:41.740 --> 02:53:42.220
Hey, what's up?

02:53:42.220 --> 02:53:42.860
This is SkyJudo.

02:53:42.860 --> 02:53:43.500
Hey, SkyJudo.

02:53:43.500 --> 02:53:44.540
How you doing this week?

02:53:44.540 --> 02:53:45.180
I'm all right, man.

02:53:45.180 --> 02:53:45.420
How are you?

02:53:45.980 --> 02:53:46.460
Not too bad.

02:53:46.460 --> 02:53:47.100
What's on your mind?

02:53:47.660 --> 02:53:48.140
Not much.

02:53:48.140 --> 02:53:51.020
I just want to address what you were talking about earlier with the

02:53:51.020 --> 02:53:53.580
why did people buy the new 3DS.

02:53:53.580 --> 02:53:54.300
Sure.

02:53:54.300 --> 02:53:56.940
I'm one of those people that got 3DS day one.

02:53:57.500 --> 02:54:01.340
And the main reason why I got it is just for the simple fact of the upgrade.

02:54:01.340 --> 02:54:04.540
It's an improved version over the last 3DS.

02:54:05.420 --> 02:54:11.420
Me, I was one of the people that didn't really see much of a problem with the original 3DS.

02:54:11.420 --> 02:54:16.140
Like, I didn't experience the 3D issues or any other type of stuff.

02:54:17.900 --> 02:54:22.460
The only thing I noticed about the original 3DS was how slow some of the games started

02:54:22.460 --> 02:54:27.740
to become later on when I got into Mario Golf and the new Smash Brothers.

02:54:27.740 --> 02:54:30.700
I noticed those games took a really long time to load up.

02:54:30.700 --> 02:54:33.820
Does the new 3DS really speed that up?

02:54:35.820 --> 02:54:41.100
Yeah, well, some things that were laggy with the original are still laggy with the new

02:54:41.100 --> 02:54:42.220
one, like Pokemon.

02:54:42.860 --> 02:54:46.380
One of the issues that people have with Pokemon is when you did 3D battles, the game would

02:54:46.380 --> 02:54:48.540
lag, and that's still there.

02:54:48.540 --> 02:54:53.260
I don't know why that couldn't get cleaned up, but Smash Brothers loads pretty fast.

02:54:53.260 --> 02:54:55.260
Mario Golf is super fast now.

02:54:55.260 --> 02:54:59.900
You can get through tournaments and read your stats and all that stuff without waiting almost

02:54:59.900 --> 02:55:01.740
two minutes just to get through the damn game.

02:55:03.740 --> 02:55:04.060
I don't know.

02:55:04.060 --> 02:55:05.580
Those are probably the only games that I tried out.

02:55:06.060 --> 02:55:06.540
Interesting.

02:55:06.540 --> 02:55:09.900
I actually didn't realize that the new 3DS, I mean, I knew that the chipset and everything

02:55:09.900 --> 02:55:10.940
in there was more powerful.

02:55:10.940 --> 02:55:12.060
Like, I knew that.

02:55:12.060 --> 02:55:16.860
But my, I guess, assumption was that no game was really utilizing that yet.

02:55:16.860 --> 02:55:20.380
And that was part of my hesitation, Kajudo, is that I'm sitting here going, well, there's

02:55:20.380 --> 02:55:24.860
nothing out in America yet that you have to have the new chipset for.

02:55:24.860 --> 02:55:29.340
So, and like Loki said, by the time they release Xenoblade here, they'll probably have a Xenoblade

02:55:29.340 --> 02:55:31.740
3DS that'll sell out in five minutes, right?

02:55:31.740 --> 02:55:36.300
So I'll wait for something like that since I'm not, like, I already have a Zelda 3DS

02:55:36.300 --> 02:55:40.300
and me personally, I prefer that Triforce design way more to Majora's Mask.

02:55:40.300 --> 02:55:43.900
But that's also because I'm more of a classic Zelda fan than I ever was in Majora's Mask,

02:55:43.900 --> 02:55:45.340
although I want to give this new one a try.

02:55:46.140 --> 02:55:46.780
But I digress.

02:55:46.780 --> 02:55:51.820
I did not realize that it would have that big of an impact on the older games.

02:55:53.820 --> 02:55:58.220
I think also people coming at it, it's almost like if you're getting a new system with the,

02:55:58.220 --> 02:56:02.380
it's going to sound silly to say, but it's like you get a new system with the added buttons.

02:56:02.380 --> 02:56:06.700
You have the new, whatever the hell that is, RZ, LZ, whatever the hell they're going to do later.

02:56:06.700 --> 02:56:11.500
I mean, they have some functionality with the new, with the Smash Brothers game.

02:56:12.060 --> 02:56:16.060
It's not that big of a deal, but you can use that button with Smash Brothers.

02:56:16.060 --> 02:56:18.140
That's to set up your Amiibo.

02:56:18.140 --> 02:56:23.260
And don't forget about the little nipple rubbing button on the side.

02:56:23.260 --> 02:56:24.300
What do you think of that nipple?

02:56:25.980 --> 02:56:26.940
That thing's a nipple, man.

02:56:27.820 --> 02:56:29.180
It's a freaking nipple.

02:56:29.180 --> 02:56:31.100
What do you think of the nipple on the 3DS?

02:56:31.100 --> 02:56:36.300
It's so weird to make a YouTube video and hold my 3DS up to like my chest and just start rubbing.

02:56:38.860 --> 02:56:39.100
Yeah.

02:56:39.100 --> 02:56:39.820
Parvert.

02:56:39.820 --> 02:56:40.060
Yeah.

02:56:40.060 --> 02:56:40.540
Parvert.

02:56:41.180 --> 02:56:42.460
That's what it is though.

02:56:42.460 --> 02:56:43.980
Say how much I love my new 3DS.

02:56:43.980 --> 02:56:47.020
But yeah, that's all that is.

02:56:47.020 --> 02:56:48.220
But I mean, it works great.

02:56:48.220 --> 02:56:53.900
And I mean, I'm not, I don't know what other games use it other than Monster Hunter,

02:56:53.900 --> 02:56:55.340
but I play Monster Hunter.

02:56:55.660 --> 02:56:56.860
Final Fantasy.

02:56:56.860 --> 02:56:58.460
Final Fantasy Explorers use that.

02:56:58.460 --> 02:57:01.900
And I only know that because Shane let me play his Japanese one and he had that.

02:57:03.340 --> 02:57:05.740
But I'm assuming that game has to come out here.

02:57:05.740 --> 02:57:08.780
I mean, it's Final Fantasy and Manhunt is well enough here.

02:57:08.780 --> 02:57:11.820
So I just, I would assume that game has to come out here, but maybe it won't.

02:57:11.820 --> 02:57:12.140
I don't know.

02:57:12.140 --> 02:57:13.500
I'm waiting for E3.

02:57:13.500 --> 02:57:17.260
But I'm wondering if the, I know it didn't sell well, but I think the Resident Evil

02:57:17.260 --> 02:57:18.060
game uses it too.

02:57:18.060 --> 02:57:24.380
I know they had a few like shooter type games or something that will use that nipple control.

02:57:24.380 --> 02:57:28.300
But like I said, I played Monster Hunter, so that was another reason.

02:57:28.300 --> 02:57:31.260
I never wanted to invest in that, whatever that thing was.

02:57:31.260 --> 02:57:33.260
What was that stick thing they were talking about?

02:57:33.260 --> 02:57:34.620
No, it was like the little extra.

02:57:35.580 --> 02:57:37.020
Yeah, it took batteries, right?

02:57:37.020 --> 02:57:39.740
That was like the main reason why I didn't want it was because I was like, wait a minute,

02:57:39.740 --> 02:57:41.900
this thing takes AA batteries?

02:57:41.900 --> 02:57:43.500
You got to put AA batteries in this thing?

02:57:43.500 --> 02:57:43.900
Yeah, yeah.

02:57:43.900 --> 02:57:45.180
And that's why I never bothered with it.

02:57:45.180 --> 02:57:46.220
So yeah.

02:57:46.220 --> 02:57:50.220
But yeah, so I mean, it's like I said, it's a big upgrade.

02:57:50.220 --> 02:57:54.860
And plus, I think a lot of people were on the fence and buying the 3DS, you know, because

02:57:54.860 --> 02:57:57.660
they were hearing, you know, that the 3D is not really that great.

02:57:57.660 --> 02:58:00.700
And for some people, you know, they were saying it was like a disappointment.

02:58:00.700 --> 02:58:04.540
So I think some people were on the fence and after those people heard the improvements,

02:58:04.540 --> 02:58:06.060
they actually went out and bought it as well.

02:58:06.060 --> 02:58:07.500
Because I mean, it was selling out everywhere.

02:58:07.500 --> 02:58:09.100
I was surprised that I got one.

02:58:09.100 --> 02:58:14.060
Actually, I had to go to Best Buy and get it that way because GameStop was completely

02:58:14.060 --> 02:58:14.620
sold out.

02:58:14.620 --> 02:58:19.500
That 3D, that 3D enhancement with the head tracking really does work really well, though.

02:58:19.500 --> 02:58:21.580
I mean, that I mean, I'll give the system that.

02:58:21.580 --> 02:58:25.500
For me, though, I just was like, I'm not going to drop that kind of money just for that.

02:58:25.500 --> 02:58:27.020
That's what I saw as the biggest improvement.

02:58:27.020 --> 02:58:31.900
And I was like, I don't really use 3D enough or rely on it enough to really do that.

02:58:31.900 --> 02:58:35.100
But yeah, I mean, that gives me some things to think about.

02:58:35.100 --> 02:58:38.140
I think ultimately, though, I mean, and I've said this in the very beginning, I'm going

02:58:38.140 --> 02:58:42.700
to end up getting a new 3DS eventually, but I'm just waiting for that must have game that's

02:58:42.700 --> 02:58:44.620
probably being announced at E3 this year.

02:58:45.340 --> 02:58:49.180
Yeah, I'm just going to tell you before I hang up, one of the things that made me realize

02:58:49.180 --> 02:58:52.540
how good the 3D is, and the 3D is not the biggest draw of this thing.

02:58:52.540 --> 02:58:57.100
I don't want people thinking at all, if you're not in the 3D, then don't bother with the

02:58:57.100 --> 02:58:57.420
system.

02:58:57.420 --> 02:58:59.100
I mean, it goes beyond the 3D.

02:58:59.100 --> 02:59:02.940
The 3D is not the biggest deal, but I just wanted to mention the 3D because I was playing

02:59:02.940 --> 02:59:05.340
Smash Brothers, and I can't remember what the level was.

02:59:05.340 --> 02:59:11.580
I'm playing one of these cartoon looking levels, and I'm starting swatting in front of my face

02:59:11.580 --> 02:59:14.860
because I'm thinking there's flies flying in front of me like a little bug.

02:59:14.860 --> 02:59:18.060
And that's actually coming off of something moving around in the game in the 3D.

02:59:18.060 --> 02:59:19.180
That's how good the 3D was.

02:59:19.180 --> 02:59:20.940
And I'm just like, wait a minute, that's not a bug.

02:59:20.940 --> 02:59:21.980
That's actually in the game.

02:59:23.340 --> 02:59:25.740
I thought it was like a little gnat or something flying around my screen.

02:59:25.740 --> 02:59:26.460
I'm like, what the hell is that?

02:59:28.060 --> 02:59:29.580
I mean, it literally pops up at you.

02:59:29.580 --> 02:59:36.300
I think if you follow Adam Sessler a lot, when the 3DS first came out, they remember

02:59:36.300 --> 02:59:39.740
how everyone was like, oh, this thing must have been made with angel blood or something

02:59:39.740 --> 02:59:42.540
they were saying about it because it was so crisp and everything.

02:59:42.540 --> 02:59:43.980
Yeah, I remember seeing it.

02:59:43.980 --> 02:59:48.380
And then when it came out, Adam Sessler was saying, wait a minute, that's not the system

02:59:48.380 --> 02:59:51.180
that we saw, that they showed us in the demo.

02:59:51.180 --> 02:59:51.980
That's not the system.

02:59:51.980 --> 02:59:58.140
I wonder if he saw the new 3DS and if he would say that this is closer to what they originally

02:59:58.140 --> 03:00:01.740
saw because he went out and said, that's not the 3DS that we saw.

03:00:01.740 --> 03:00:04.380
The one that they're selling in retail is not the 3DS that we saw.

03:00:04.380 --> 03:00:09.100
I also remember that particular, I was there at E3 that year they first showed the 3DS.

03:00:09.100 --> 03:00:12.700
And I remember just kind of being in awe when they actually were showing it to us.

03:00:12.700 --> 03:00:14.860
And it was like, oh my God, it really does work.

03:00:14.860 --> 03:00:16.700
The 3D on this thing really works.

03:00:16.700 --> 03:00:19.180
Kind of seeing it for the first time was really kind of inspiring.

03:00:19.180 --> 03:00:21.100
But yeah, I don't know.

03:00:21.100 --> 03:00:23.020
Maybe they had a different tracking system there or whatever.

03:00:23.020 --> 03:00:27.180
But I don't remember being really disappointed by the first 3DS model or whatever.

03:00:27.180 --> 03:00:30.300
I was just more blown away by it's 3D without glasses.

03:00:30.300 --> 03:00:33.500
And it was the first time we were really seeing that in mass.

03:00:33.500 --> 03:00:35.980
Anyway, Kajuda, I got to let you go so we can try to squeeze in some more calls.

03:00:35.980 --> 03:00:37.740
But I will leave you with this comment.

03:00:37.740 --> 03:00:42.540
Bonds006 in our chat room over at live.vognore.com says they gave us a condom for the Wii and

03:00:42.540 --> 03:00:44.060
now a nipple for the new 3DS.

03:00:44.620 --> 03:00:45.100
There you go.

03:00:45.980 --> 03:00:46.540
All right.

03:00:46.540 --> 03:00:47.900
Have a good one, my friend.

03:00:47.900 --> 03:00:48.300
You too.

03:00:48.300 --> 03:00:48.540
All right.

03:00:48.540 --> 03:00:48.780
Bye.

03:00:49.500 --> 03:00:52.220
1877 game OLR username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

03:00:52.220 --> 03:00:55.180
I can probably squeeze in one more call here, although we are running a little late.

03:00:55.180 --> 03:00:58.460
And I know some of us have to work Monday morning as do some of you.

03:00:58.460 --> 03:01:00.620
So I can't let things go on too much longer.

03:01:01.180 --> 03:01:04.060
But I will try to squeeze in one more call if somebody wants to try and get in there.

03:01:05.260 --> 03:01:06.140
I know it was lighting up.

03:01:06.140 --> 03:01:07.020
We might have a few more.

03:01:07.020 --> 03:01:07.820
Oh, there we go.

03:01:07.820 --> 03:01:08.780
It's lighting up.

03:01:08.780 --> 03:01:10.220
You got to wait for that delay sometimes.

03:01:10.220 --> 03:01:11.420
Just a little bit of a delay.

03:01:11.420 --> 03:01:12.380
Hi, Orange Launch Radio.

03:01:12.380 --> 03:01:12.780
Who's this?

03:01:13.420 --> 03:01:13.660
Hey.

03:01:13.660 --> 03:01:14.700
Hey, it's Ronva.

03:01:14.700 --> 03:01:15.100
Hey, buddy.

03:01:15.100 --> 03:01:15.580
How you doing?

03:01:16.140 --> 03:01:16.620
Not much.

03:01:16.620 --> 03:01:17.740
Just chilling, relaxing.

03:01:17.740 --> 03:01:18.780
You know how I do.

03:01:18.780 --> 03:01:19.900
Yeah, that's good.

03:01:19.900 --> 03:01:22.380
You've been watching the Oscars on the other television or something?

03:01:23.260 --> 03:01:24.060
Actually, no.

03:01:25.020 --> 03:01:25.660
Come on.

03:01:25.660 --> 03:01:27.660
When OLR is on, my TV is off.

03:01:27.660 --> 03:01:29.100
I respect that.

03:01:29.100 --> 03:01:29.580
I do.

03:01:29.580 --> 03:01:31.180
I see, obviously, it's inevitable.

03:01:31.180 --> 03:01:35.500
Whenever we go up against something big, people are talking about it in chat and even on Twitter.

03:01:35.500 --> 03:01:37.980
I'm trying to look at Twitter like, oh, what's going on in gaming?

03:01:37.980 --> 03:01:39.340
But everybody's talking about the Oscars.

03:01:39.340 --> 03:01:43.420
Apparently, I'm hearing however you might feel about Lady Gaga.

03:01:43.420 --> 03:01:46.380
Apparently, she did some type of tribute to the Sound of Music on the Oscars, and they're

03:01:46.380 --> 03:01:48.060
saying she killed it.

03:01:49.100 --> 03:01:51.180
Some are saying they got goosebumps on how good it was.

03:01:52.220 --> 03:01:53.820
As somebody who actually...

03:01:53.820 --> 03:01:54.780
I don't mind her music at all.

03:01:54.780 --> 03:01:56.540
I think she's a great, great pop artist.

03:01:56.540 --> 03:01:58.140
The Sound of Music will be very strange.

03:01:58.140 --> 03:02:00.300
Well, I'm dying to hear it.

03:02:01.100 --> 03:02:06.220
Well, a friend of mine did take voice acting and singing lessons with her in a class years

03:02:06.220 --> 03:02:06.700
ago.

03:02:06.860 --> 03:02:11.900
Right now, on my Facebook, more people are talking more about how the Lego movie got

03:02:11.900 --> 03:02:16.860
snubbed and the live performance of Everything is Awesome was phenomenal.

03:02:16.860 --> 03:02:17.740
That's what I keep seeing.

03:02:17.740 --> 03:02:18.300
Oh, that's cool.

03:02:18.860 --> 03:02:20.460
We're taking Sarah actually there?

03:02:20.460 --> 03:02:22.380
Oprah got a Lego Oscar.

03:02:22.380 --> 03:02:23.580
I want one.

03:02:23.580 --> 03:02:24.140
How was...

03:02:24.140 --> 03:02:25.820
I want to know how new a Patrick Harris was.

03:02:25.820 --> 03:02:26.940
Like, I don't usually...

03:02:26.940 --> 03:02:30.460
You know, there's part of me that kind of doesn't really care about the Oscars, especially

03:02:30.460 --> 03:02:31.900
when I haven't seen a one.

03:02:31.900 --> 03:02:34.460
I don't think I've seen a single one of the nominated movies this year.

03:02:34.460 --> 03:02:36.060
Was Interstellar nominated?

03:02:36.060 --> 03:02:36.940
I have no idea.

03:02:36.940 --> 03:02:37.820
See, that's where I'm at.

03:02:37.820 --> 03:02:40.460
I'm like, if Interstellar was nominated, then I saw that one.

03:02:40.460 --> 03:02:42.700
And if it wasn't nominated, I'm kind of surprised that it wasn't.

03:02:42.700 --> 03:02:45.420
But anyway, I just think that's just how out of it I am these days.

03:02:46.380 --> 03:02:46.780
Anyway.

03:02:48.300 --> 03:02:51.980
So Rob, tell me, did you get The Cross of St. Olaf?

03:02:55.420 --> 03:02:58.620
I saved my three Hail Betty Whites for missing the Oscars tonight.

03:02:58.620 --> 03:03:00.300
Or I'm gonna lose my card.

03:03:01.500 --> 03:03:02.140
Something like that.

03:03:02.380 --> 03:03:06.300
Yeah, yes, I'm prepared.

03:03:06.300 --> 03:03:06.940
Hail Betty White.

03:03:06.940 --> 03:03:07.660
Hail Betty White.

03:03:08.620 --> 03:03:10.780
Okay, two more things I want to touch on.

03:03:10.780 --> 03:03:11.980
I'm gonna get the heck up on out of here.

03:03:11.980 --> 03:03:13.980
Now, you talked about President Cat.

03:03:13.980 --> 03:03:19.100
Now, I was one of those that shared this on social media back then.

03:03:19.100 --> 03:03:24.540
And one of my friends, he ran the game room for Zenkai Con.

03:03:24.540 --> 03:03:28.860
And he told me he got a copy of the game for the game room.

03:03:29.260 --> 03:03:32.460
And I went to check the game from time to time.

03:03:32.460 --> 03:03:35.500
Let's just say there were a lot of people waiting around to play this game.

03:03:35.500 --> 03:03:36.140
Thank you.

03:03:36.700 --> 03:03:37.420
Thank you.

03:03:37.420 --> 03:03:41.660
See, and again, there's another copy that essentially OLR sold.

03:03:41.660 --> 03:03:44.060
I mean, Rama sold it, but threw us, right?

03:03:44.060 --> 03:03:44.540
No, no, no.

03:03:44.540 --> 03:03:45.980
OLR sold it.

03:03:45.980 --> 03:03:47.260
I just endorsed it.

03:03:47.260 --> 03:03:49.580
So how did you tell me that that game only sold?

03:03:51.580 --> 03:03:55.500
Did it sell 100 copies in America because of OLR?

03:03:55.500 --> 03:03:57.340
I would maybe, although that's a lot.

03:03:57.340 --> 03:03:59.420
I don't think we have 100 people that listen to this show.

03:03:59.420 --> 03:04:03.260
But I would believe that maybe there's that.

03:04:03.260 --> 03:04:07.820
But only 100 copies in Japan when we know all these people that I know bought them.

03:04:08.860 --> 03:04:10.940
That's why I'm like, I want to see the receipts on this game.

03:04:16.940 --> 03:04:17.580
That's great.

03:04:17.580 --> 03:04:19.660
I'm so glad to hear that was a hit at anime cons.

03:04:19.660 --> 03:04:22.060
In fact, I wish somebody would take it to more anime cons.

03:04:22.380 --> 03:04:27.180
If there ever is, heaven forbid, a vogcon, like we need another fucking con.

03:04:27.180 --> 03:04:32.140
But if there ever is a vogcon or whatever, then we'll have to have President Kat in the

03:04:32.140 --> 03:04:32.940
game room.

03:04:32.940 --> 03:04:36.940
Although, since pretty much we tell people, just go to Dragon Con because we're the most

03:04:36.940 --> 03:04:40.300
vog host show up anyway, maybe we'll just have President Kat up in the hotel room.

03:04:40.300 --> 03:04:40.620
I don't know.

03:04:41.340 --> 03:04:41.900
Fair enough.

03:04:44.060 --> 03:04:49.020
And you were talking about the Fugu question week about multiplayer in the arcade.

03:04:49.020 --> 03:04:51.420
Now, it wasn't in the arcade.

03:04:51.500 --> 03:04:53.100
This was at home.

03:04:53.100 --> 03:04:58.140
Years ago, I lived with some friends and my friend's older brother used to work the night

03:04:58.140 --> 03:04:59.820
shift at this ice rink.

03:04:59.820 --> 03:05:04.380
So he started taking the N64 down because there's nothing else to do on night shift,

03:05:04.380 --> 03:05:04.700
you know?

03:05:04.700 --> 03:05:05.980
So everything's already locked down.

03:05:06.860 --> 03:05:11.900
So I got wind of them, they were playing Conqueror's Bash Fur Day.

03:05:11.900 --> 03:05:13.500
I'm like, what?

03:05:13.500 --> 03:05:14.940
Is everyone taking turns playing?

03:05:14.940 --> 03:05:15.580
I'm like, oh, wait.

03:05:17.100 --> 03:05:18.460
Multiplayer.

03:05:18.460 --> 03:05:25.180
So we had a tradition of going down to the ice rink two, three times a week.

03:05:25.740 --> 03:05:33.420
We would sit there around N64, 20 inch big screen at night, and just sit there and just

03:05:33.420 --> 03:05:36.220
multiplayer the hell out of each other on every level.

03:05:36.220 --> 03:05:39.500
Now, it would be me and my friend's oldest brother.

03:05:40.940 --> 03:05:43.740
We were pretentious assholes for sniping.

03:05:43.740 --> 03:05:47.900
So we would snipe everyone and then eventually, whatever levels it is where you could just

03:05:47.900 --> 03:05:52.300
snipe, we would just find a bunker and just sit there and just try to snipe each other

03:05:52.300 --> 03:05:57.180
from either side of the stage, not paying attention to his two other brothers trying

03:05:57.180 --> 03:05:58.620
to kill us and each other.

03:06:03.100 --> 03:06:07.660
We'd sit there talking like we're old buddies in Vietnam and stuff like that.

03:06:07.660 --> 03:06:10.940
It was just ridiculous, but it was just a fun and just amazing.

03:06:11.980 --> 03:06:13.180
You have the best stories.

03:06:13.180 --> 03:06:14.780
I always think I have good memories.

03:06:15.180 --> 03:06:17.340
Then it's some fricking con.

03:06:17.340 --> 03:06:18.860
You create more memories.

03:06:18.860 --> 03:06:19.740
I hope you keep a book.

03:06:20.460 --> 03:06:22.540
Look, Rob, let me tell you something.

03:06:22.540 --> 03:06:25.180
You mentioned earlier that your memory is bad.

03:06:25.180 --> 03:06:26.540
My memory is bad, too.

03:06:26.540 --> 03:06:29.420
At least you have somebody to remind you.

03:06:30.220 --> 03:06:35.820
I have someone who reminds me I have a bad memory and not telling me what I need to remember.

03:06:38.460 --> 03:06:39.420
I am lucky.

03:06:39.420 --> 03:06:42.300
Well, I do have Jamie for that, but I am lucky to have Alan.

03:06:42.300 --> 03:06:42.860
What can I say?

03:06:43.580 --> 03:06:43.980
All right.

03:06:43.980 --> 03:06:45.500
Oh, sappy, sappy, gross.

03:06:45.500 --> 03:06:45.820
All right.

03:06:46.700 --> 03:06:47.980
Anyway, I'm going to go ahead and let you go.

03:06:47.980 --> 03:06:48.700
OK, my friend?

03:06:49.260 --> 03:06:49.580
All right.

03:06:49.580 --> 03:06:50.300
Take care, bro.

03:06:50.300 --> 03:06:50.700
Take care.

03:06:50.700 --> 03:06:51.980
I'm going to miss you at PAX East.

03:06:53.020 --> 03:06:55.100
Well, we'll see.

03:06:55.100 --> 03:06:55.500
All right.

03:06:55.500 --> 03:06:56.220
Take care.

03:06:56.220 --> 03:06:56.540
All right.

03:06:56.540 --> 03:06:57.020
Bye.

03:06:57.020 --> 03:06:57.520
Bye.

03:06:58.140 --> 03:07:00.780
Ramo will find a way, even though all those tickets are long gone.

03:07:00.780 --> 03:07:01.580
He'll find a way.

03:07:01.580 --> 03:07:03.260
He'll be like, there's some forum.

03:07:03.260 --> 03:07:06.060
I knew a guy who knew a guy had PAX East tickets.

03:07:06.060 --> 03:07:06.860
All right.

03:07:06.860 --> 03:07:08.380
That is going to do it for Skype calls tonight.

03:07:08.380 --> 03:07:11.340
I'm so sorry, but just due to time, we are running really long this week.

03:07:12.300 --> 03:07:15.980
Having Steve here took up a little bit of a chunk of time in the beginning of the show,

03:07:15.980 --> 03:07:19.180
although we love talking to him and wish Flom the best of success.

03:07:19.900 --> 03:07:22.460
But that is it for the main part of the show tonight.

03:07:22.460 --> 03:07:23.580
It's time to wrap things up.

03:07:23.580 --> 03:07:27.500
I want to thank everybody for tuning in and listening to another episode of OLR.

03:07:27.500 --> 03:07:29.740
Your support means so much, you guys.

03:07:29.740 --> 03:07:34.380
The fact that many of you here live would choose to listen to us over the Oscars,

03:07:34.380 --> 03:07:36.060
that really does mean an awful lot.

03:07:36.060 --> 03:07:39.260
And even if you did end up watching the Oscars this week and you just happen to be listening

03:07:39.340 --> 03:07:43.180
to us on the podcast feed, hey, you made it through a nearly three and a half hour show

03:07:44.540 --> 03:07:47.100
while you were at work on your commute or what have you.

03:07:47.100 --> 03:07:51.180
And I thank you for spending time during your week with us.

03:07:51.740 --> 03:07:53.100
And we want to hear from more of you.

03:07:53.100 --> 03:07:54.780
So please tweet at us at OLR.

03:07:56.060 --> 03:07:59.900
Send us a Facebook message on Facebook or whatever people do.

03:08:00.700 --> 03:08:01.740
Send us a Snapchat.

03:08:02.620 --> 03:08:03.820
Just keep it clean.

03:08:03.820 --> 03:08:05.660
No, tweet at us.

03:08:05.740 --> 03:08:06.220
Email us.

03:08:06.220 --> 03:08:09.180
Participate at orangeontrady.com or post on our forums.

03:08:09.180 --> 03:08:10.460
Just let us know you're out there.

03:08:10.460 --> 03:08:13.820
Even if you're like the guy who emailed us tonight that was like, hey, I just want to say hey.

03:08:13.820 --> 03:08:15.100
What's up?

03:08:15.100 --> 03:08:15.600
What's up?

03:08:18.220 --> 03:08:21.020
And now my response will be not much ASL.

03:08:23.980 --> 03:08:27.500
All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight,

03:08:27.500 --> 03:08:30.300
because it is time to wrap up the show and get on out of here.

03:08:30.300 --> 03:08:34.140
If you did enjoy Orange on Trady though, please remember, tell a friend or five about the show.

03:08:34.140 --> 03:08:34.700
Spread the word.

03:08:34.700 --> 03:08:36.700
It is the show where every gamer has a voice,

03:08:36.700 --> 03:08:39.500
but we can't spread those voices if they're not out there to share them.

03:08:39.500 --> 03:08:45.180
So please bring more awesome people into this little family we have here at VOG Network and OLR.

03:08:46.220 --> 03:08:49.500
We will be back in seven days time Sunday to do all over again,

03:08:49.500 --> 03:08:53.260
but then that show's got to last for two weeks because we will be off for PAX East.

03:08:53.260 --> 03:08:56.860
But again, if you are going to be in Boston, A, protect me from the snow.

03:08:57.420 --> 03:09:00.140
B, please introduce yourself and come say hello.

03:09:00.140 --> 03:09:01.740
I can't wait to meet people over at PAX East.

03:09:02.300 --> 03:09:04.220
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

03:09:04.300 --> 03:09:05.580
Loki, you look ready to go.

03:09:05.580 --> 03:09:07.340
What's on your mind for your final thought tonight?

03:09:07.340 --> 03:09:08.380
I gotta work more on my game.

03:09:09.260 --> 03:09:10.220
I can't wait to play it.

03:09:10.220 --> 03:09:11.740
And apparently someone doesn't like my music.

03:09:12.300 --> 03:09:13.660
Don't read the comments.

03:09:13.660 --> 03:09:14.380
Don't read the comments.

03:09:15.420 --> 03:09:16.620
What'd you post to YouTube about it?

03:09:16.620 --> 03:09:23.100
Oh, I've posted several YouTubes about the game, but the music is trash.

03:09:23.100 --> 03:09:25.820
I'm like, it's kind of that way.

03:09:25.820 --> 03:09:26.540
Don't read comments.

03:09:26.540 --> 03:09:27.500
Well, no, no, no, no, no.

03:09:27.500 --> 03:09:29.660
The thing is, it's on purpose.

03:09:29.660 --> 03:09:30.300
It's on purpose.

03:09:30.300 --> 03:09:32.700
Like a lot of the whole point of that song is supposed to be kind of-

03:09:32.700 --> 03:09:33.820
The artist's vision.

03:09:33.900 --> 03:09:37.580
It's supposed to be kind of annoying because it's all the things that are wrong with games.

03:09:37.580 --> 03:09:39.500
But at the same time, I really do like that song.

03:09:40.620 --> 03:09:41.500
And it's free.

03:09:41.500 --> 03:09:45.020
That's really the main reason why it's in the game because it's free.

03:09:46.300 --> 03:09:49.900
My final thought tonight is I want to thank Steve for being here tonight.

03:09:49.900 --> 03:09:51.740
And even though he had to leave early, I understand.

03:09:52.380 --> 03:09:56.380
And I want to just thank all you guys again for listening and being a part of the show.

03:09:56.380 --> 03:09:57.500
You guys make my Sunday nights.

03:09:57.500 --> 03:10:02.780
And I was talking to somebody again over the weekend about giving up your Sunday nights

03:10:02.780 --> 03:10:03.900
every single week.

03:10:03.900 --> 03:10:07.100
And I don't know if I really see it as giving it up.

03:10:07.100 --> 03:10:10.380
It's just, this is how we all get to hang once a week.

03:10:12.380 --> 03:10:12.940
We get up.

03:10:14.140 --> 03:10:15.260
We get up to get down.

03:10:15.980 --> 03:10:16.780
That's my final thought.

03:10:16.780 --> 03:10:18.220
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight.

03:10:18.220 --> 03:10:20.140
I'm going to have pie and none of you can stop me.

03:10:20.780 --> 03:10:21.500
I want pie.

03:10:22.300 --> 03:10:23.260
No, you have to go get Alan.

03:10:23.260 --> 03:10:24.780
You do have to go get Alan.

03:10:24.780 --> 03:10:25.260
Maybe I can convince-

03:10:25.260 --> 03:10:26.780
So I said I brought you taquitos.

03:10:26.780 --> 03:10:27.820
You did bring me taquitos.

03:10:27.820 --> 03:10:29.500
Maybe I can convince Alan to go get pie.

03:10:30.140 --> 03:10:31.340
I offered lucky food.

03:10:31.660 --> 03:10:34.540
Well, I had just eaten like a bunch of pizzas.

03:10:35.740 --> 03:10:38.220
And then later I got hungry, so I had Chinese.

03:10:38.220 --> 03:10:39.900
Akuma JP wants to see your work, Loki.

03:10:39.900 --> 03:10:41.420
You got to put that in her chat room.

03:10:41.420 --> 03:10:45.420
Well, just if you go to YouTube, Loki OLR is my username on there.

03:10:45.420 --> 03:10:47.020
Or you just go look at my Twitter.

03:10:47.020 --> 03:10:47.900
I post videos on it.

03:10:47.900 --> 03:10:49.020
I don't have like a-

03:10:49.020 --> 03:10:49.820
I was gonna-

03:10:49.820 --> 03:10:56.460
I had a video that I was set to upload Saturday, but it just didn't happen because it's too

03:10:56.460 --> 03:10:58.300
high quality apparently for YouTube.

03:10:58.300 --> 03:10:59.500
It couldn't encode it.

03:10:59.500 --> 03:11:03.900
So I'm gonna record it this time as an MP4 instead of an uncompressed-

03:11:03.900 --> 03:11:09.020
This is me sitting here who's been owed those great, great creators their proper

03:11:09.020 --> 03:11:10.700
playthrough videos for like a month now.

03:11:10.700 --> 03:11:11.180
So I can't-

03:11:11.180 --> 03:11:16.220
And I even tried using the software to convert it to a format that YouTube could use, but

03:11:16.220 --> 03:11:18.380
the framerate just wasn't good enough for me.

03:11:18.380 --> 03:11:19.900
So I'm gonna do it again.

03:11:20.620 --> 03:11:23.260
It's fine because I gotta add some stuff to the game anyways.

03:11:23.260 --> 03:11:24.060
It continues.

03:11:24.060 --> 03:11:26.380
Anyway, we're out of here for the night.

03:11:26.380 --> 03:11:27.260
We got to get pie.

03:11:28.220 --> 03:11:29.580
Man, I want pie.

03:11:30.780 --> 03:11:32.460
That's the thought I'm leaving you with tonight.

03:11:32.460 --> 03:11:32.960
Pie.

03:11:33.580 --> 03:11:34.460
It's delicious.

03:11:34.460 --> 03:11:35.100
Good night everybody.

03:11:35.100 --> 03:11:36.380
We'll see you in seven days.

03:11:37.260 --> 03:11:39.980
