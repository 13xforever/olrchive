00:00.000 --> 00:17.520
This week, Nintendo rolled out an update adding more 8-player Smash compatible levels, and

00:17.520 --> 00:20.640
for those of you looking to monetize them, there are guidelines for that as well.

00:20.640 --> 00:23.880
We have so much more for you tonight, including a new segment along with your calls, comments,

00:23.880 --> 00:29.920
and emails, all happening right now on the show, where Evergamer has a voice.

00:29.920 --> 00:35.040
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.040 --> 00:36.680
where Everygamer has a voice.

00:36.680 --> 00:46.640
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this February 1st, 2015, with the 585th episode of our program.

00:46.640 --> 00:51.040
My name is Rob Roberts, here with you over the next three hours or so to talk about video

00:51.040 --> 00:54.180
games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts.

00:54.180 --> 00:56.480
Say hello over there to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

00:56.480 --> 00:57.480
Yo.

00:57.480 --> 00:58.480
Hey, how you doing?

00:58.480 --> 00:59.480
I'm okay.

01:00.040 --> 01:01.040
Better than I was.

01:01.040 --> 01:02.040
Yeah?

01:02.040 --> 01:03.040
I know.

01:03.040 --> 01:04.040
You and I were both talking before the show.

01:04.040 --> 01:05.040
We were both fighting off headaches.

01:05.040 --> 01:06.040
What's up with that?

01:06.040 --> 01:09.560
Yeah, we were punching them in the face, but they were being bitches, and we had to put

01:09.560 --> 01:10.560
some bitches down.

01:10.560 --> 01:13.160
I feel better now, thanks to Captain Ibuprofen.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.160
I feel a little better.

01:14.160 --> 01:15.960
I feel better thanks to coffee and meat.

01:15.960 --> 01:19.440
I feel better thanks to the power of positivity.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.440
The power of song!

01:20.440 --> 01:21.440
All right.

01:21.440 --> 01:22.440
No.

01:22.440 --> 01:25.320
Also, speaking of the power of song, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

01:25.320 --> 01:26.320
Hello.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.280
Hello, how you doing?

01:28.280 --> 01:29.880
I'm very full.

01:29.880 --> 01:30.880
Full, yeah?

01:30.880 --> 01:32.520
That sandwich was a maze.

01:32.520 --> 01:35.320
You got a new place that you've never brought to the show before?

01:35.320 --> 01:36.320
Yes.

01:36.320 --> 01:37.320
And what's that?

01:37.320 --> 01:39.480
Firehouse Subs, I guess, is what this is called.

01:39.480 --> 01:43.900
And I had no idea that that chain existed in California, because the first time I ever

01:43.900 --> 01:48.420
had that Firehouse Subs was at Dragon Con in Atlanta, and Travis Donovan, my pal from

01:48.420 --> 01:53.120
Understation Live, I'm sure you all know him here at VOG, was losing his mind with Jenna,

01:53.120 --> 01:56.560
because I guess they didn't have those where he was from, or I don't know, but he was just

01:56.560 --> 01:57.560
very excited about the Firehouse.

01:57.560 --> 01:59.040
He was like, you gotta try it, you gotta try it.

01:59.040 --> 02:00.040
So I had it.

02:00.040 --> 02:03.960
It was, and I shouldn't say this, because we're not paid to endorse this stuff, but

02:03.960 --> 02:07.640
whatever, it was pretty good, I gotta say.

02:07.640 --> 02:09.640
I still prefer Quiznos, rest in peace.

02:09.640 --> 02:10.880
That's my favorite sub sandwich.

02:10.880 --> 02:11.880
They're not gone.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.880
I've got one that's still right around the corner of my mouth.

02:13.880 --> 02:14.880
I know, you lucky punk.

02:14.880 --> 02:15.880
The only one in the area.

02:15.880 --> 02:16.880
That's the only one in all of Sacramento anymore.

02:16.880 --> 02:17.880
Pretty much, yeah.

02:17.880 --> 02:21.640
I'm like, I don't know how they, it's seriously the worst location for that, but somehow they've

02:21.640 --> 02:22.640
survived.

02:22.640 --> 02:23.640
I know, I know.

02:23.640 --> 02:26.040
All right, so you found some new food to bring to the show, so that's good.

02:26.520 --> 02:32.000
Yes, because I got the same sandwich yesterday, and it was the beef brisket, well, I had the

02:32.000 --> 02:36.040
intent because yesterday it was like, you know, damn, I don't know if I want the meatball

02:36.040 --> 02:40.460
sub or if I want the brisket sandwich, I'm like, I always get the meatball sub whenever

02:40.460 --> 02:42.440
I go someplace just to try it.

02:42.440 --> 02:47.100
I think everybody goes through that phase where you find that food you love so much,

02:47.100 --> 02:48.760
you're eating it for like a week.

02:48.760 --> 02:53.680
I can't eat that for a week, there's no way, it's like so much, like I got their large

02:53.680 --> 02:57.440
sandwiches like a foot long and it's just packed full of meat.

02:57.440 --> 02:59.600
It's just like so much meat on there.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.280
I just can't, I can't eat more.

03:01.280 --> 03:05.280
I want to eat more, but I, I literally will get sick if I eat more.

03:05.280 --> 03:08.400
Jamie, has there ever been a food that you discovered and then you had to eat it for

03:08.400 --> 03:09.880
like an entire week?

03:09.880 --> 03:10.880
Yes.

03:10.880 --> 03:12.920
What was that?

03:12.920 --> 03:14.440
My favorite sick food?

03:14.440 --> 03:15.440
Mm.

03:15.440 --> 03:16.440
Burritos.

03:16.440 --> 03:17.440
Burritos?

03:17.440 --> 03:18.440
Just no specific burritos?

03:18.440 --> 03:19.440
No, seriously.

03:19.440 --> 03:22.600
Well, it was, I used to be addicted to the California burritos that were basically the

03:22.600 --> 03:26.880
carne asada, but I wouldn't get like salsa or anything with it.

03:26.880 --> 03:33.160
It would be meat, potatoes, and cheese, and I ate it for almost a whole week in a row.

03:33.160 --> 03:34.160
Wow.

03:34.160 --> 03:39.000
Well, no, I mixed it up with breakfast burritos too, which was egg, potato, and cheese, but

03:39.000 --> 03:44.280
I had like this sick that would not go away and all I wanted to eat was burritos.

03:44.280 --> 03:46.600
So I ate burritos for a week.

03:46.600 --> 03:47.600
Awesome.

03:47.600 --> 03:48.600
Awesome.

03:48.600 --> 03:52.180
I would say for me it was vanilla Coke was the thing that I had to have like every single

03:52.180 --> 03:53.180
day.

03:53.180 --> 03:54.180
It's like, why am I gaining all this weight?

03:54.180 --> 03:55.180
They have that there.

03:55.180 --> 03:56.180
The Coke free summer shoes.

03:56.180 --> 03:57.180
Oh, I know.

03:57.180 --> 04:00.060
I'm talking about, remember when like it came out, it was probably like 2002, 2003.

04:00.060 --> 04:01.680
It was just kind of eh.

04:01.680 --> 04:03.100
Remember when I had pneumonia?

04:03.100 --> 04:04.180
I do.

04:04.180 --> 04:07.260
And all I ate for like a week and a half was French onion soup.

04:07.260 --> 04:08.260
Literally.

04:08.260 --> 04:10.580
That's all I had was French onion soup.

04:10.580 --> 04:13.420
Because I couldn't eat anything else, like solid food was like no.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.420
I would do that too.

04:14.420 --> 04:17.960
I'd go over to Panera and get French onion soup all the time.

04:17.960 --> 04:20.420
Remember Mimi's Cafe before they got crappy?

04:20.420 --> 04:21.420
I do.

04:21.620 --> 04:27.500
They had, they had the, uh, the five cheese grilled cheese with French onion soup.

04:27.500 --> 04:28.500
That was crack.

04:28.500 --> 04:29.500
All right.

04:29.500 --> 04:33.060
People are going to think we're a podcast about food and it is inevitable.

04:33.060 --> 04:34.060
We always get into food.

04:34.060 --> 04:35.060
We're talking about food the whole show.

04:35.060 --> 04:37.980
Is it called Orange Lounge Radio because you guys talk about oranges?

04:37.980 --> 04:38.980
Well, kind of.

04:38.980 --> 04:44.000
I mean, we never talk about anything that healthy, but yeah, we should do a spinoff

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
called the Soup Lounge.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.100
We just talk about food.

04:47.100 --> 04:50.880
But we do have you guys who join us live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine

04:50.880 --> 04:54.840
o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com and if you are listening live

04:54.840 --> 05:00.880
over at live.vognetwork.com, you can head into our chat room there and comment along

05:00.880 --> 05:01.880
with the show.

05:01.880 --> 05:05.320
And we oftentimes are looking at the chat room during the show and we pick some comments

05:05.320 --> 05:06.320
to read on there.

05:06.320 --> 05:08.840
We can't read every single line because then you guys would fill out the entire show with

05:08.840 --> 05:09.840
your conversation.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.680
But we do pick out some key comments.

05:11.680 --> 05:15.680
Right now, most folks in chat talking about sandwiches.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.920
I mean, I can't possibly imagine why.

05:17.920 --> 05:21.560
We have SSG100Matt who says Potbelly is the new Quiznos these days.

05:21.560 --> 05:24.280
It's actually pretty good.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.280
Let's see.

05:25.280 --> 05:27.920
Pow says, I felt that way when I discovered ramen for the first time.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.240
I still feel that way about ramen.

05:29.240 --> 05:31.480
I just haven't eaten it because it's so much sodium.

05:31.480 --> 05:32.480
Hold on.

05:32.480 --> 05:35.920
It was my first time living alone, so I obviously ran out of budget in 10 days.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.080
I got my first paycheck.

05:37.080 --> 05:40.080
So ramen the rest of the month, I got so sick of it.

05:40.080 --> 05:41.080
Yeah, I did.

05:41.080 --> 05:42.080
Get this.

05:42.080 --> 05:47.440
When I first moved to California, Dan's pantry was literally ramen and tomato soup.

05:47.960 --> 05:50.120
And I'm like, no.

05:50.120 --> 05:53.520
So okay, last food topic, I promise, and then we'll get into games.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.720
But the video game news is like super depressing this week, what we're going to start off with.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.680
So I'm putting it off intentionally.

05:58.680 --> 06:03.680
So here's my question about ramen, because I think this is super weird and this is something

06:03.680 --> 06:04.680
Alan does.

06:04.680 --> 06:06.320
He's going to kill me for saying it.

06:06.320 --> 06:11.440
But like, he likes to just eat the ramen, like without putting it in the water or anything

06:11.440 --> 06:12.440
like that.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.440
Yeah, what's your problem with that?

06:13.440 --> 06:14.440
Oh, no.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.440
They actually sell ramen snacks like that.

06:16.440 --> 06:20.080
You just season it up and you just kind of shake it a little bit and get it incorporated

06:20.080 --> 06:21.080
in there.

06:21.080 --> 06:24.000
And you have to break it apart first, because if you can't just eat the whole piece.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.320
Yeah, you just don't just put the whole brick in your mouth.

06:25.320 --> 06:30.240
See, I can't eat ramen like that anymore unless I make it myself, because I will actually

06:30.240 --> 06:35.980
break out my, I will do it donburi style.

06:35.980 --> 06:40.280
You're not supposed to eat ramen like it's shredded wheat in a cereal bowl.

06:40.280 --> 06:41.280
No, you don't.

06:41.280 --> 06:43.520
You take the packaging, you put it on the counter, you slam your fist down on it, but

06:43.520 --> 06:45.360
not too hard because you don't want it to explode.

06:45.360 --> 06:50.040
You just want it to like shatter and then you pour it into a bowl and put the seasoning

06:50.040 --> 06:52.080
over it and away you go.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.080
It's awesome.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.320
Especially if you don't want to wait for it to cook.

06:55.320 --> 06:56.320
If it's super salty.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.320
Oh my gosh.

06:57.320 --> 06:58.320
No, thank you.

06:58.320 --> 06:59.880
It's just like, that's too much sodium.

06:59.880 --> 07:00.880
It's like, I have a heart attack just thinking about it.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.600
Exactly why I don't eat ramen anymore.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.200
Guys, you know when chat says just eat a rice cake.

07:05.200 --> 07:10.320
My other favorite thing to do with ramen was when we used to just like make like kind of,

07:10.320 --> 07:12.720
I don't know, a melting pot of all different types of ramen.

07:12.720 --> 07:13.720
Just like, oh, hey, we got some beef.

07:13.720 --> 07:14.720
We got some chicken.

07:15.080 --> 07:16.080
We got some pork.

07:16.080 --> 07:17.080
We got some shrimp or whatever.

07:17.080 --> 07:18.080
Just pour it all together.

07:18.080 --> 07:19.080
Mix it together.

07:19.080 --> 07:20.080
Done.

07:20.080 --> 07:22.240
It's some flavor of ramen.

07:22.240 --> 07:24.440
See the way to do it, you get just the noodles.

07:24.440 --> 07:26.800
Actually, I prefer to do this with udon.

07:26.800 --> 07:30.920
You put a, you slice up a boiled egg, you put in like you actually make your dashi stock

07:30.920 --> 07:36.080
from scratch and it is the best thing on a cold day.

07:36.080 --> 07:39.240
And then lastly, Alan Alchemy since he was the inspiration for this and chat says you

07:39.240 --> 07:43.080
pound it with your fist or just pinch the shit out of it and make bite sized nuggets.

07:43.440 --> 07:45.400
I don't use the spice packet though.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.400
You know what?

07:46.400 --> 07:49.160
That was almost my food of choice while playing Final Fantasy XI.

07:49.160 --> 07:51.320
I'm surprised you don't remember that.

07:51.320 --> 07:52.320
I do.

07:52.320 --> 07:53.320
I actually do remember that.

07:53.320 --> 07:54.320
All right.

07:54.320 --> 07:55.320
Thank you for bringing up a video game.

07:55.320 --> 07:57.320
We should take the topic to video games.

07:57.320 --> 07:58.520
But I'm going to be honest, guys.

07:58.520 --> 08:01.040
This is, this has kind of been a shitty week in video games.

08:01.040 --> 08:06.160
There's been a lot of real bad news and we'll get to some of it as we go on throughout the

08:06.160 --> 08:07.800
show and bring up the different topics.

08:07.800 --> 08:13.040
But I think there's one y'all are thinking about, y'all have been talking about on Twitter

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
Let's talk about it now.

08:15.000 --> 08:17.200
Let's talk about it here for our kickoff topic here.

08:17.200 --> 08:20.720
Jamie, some big, some big news in the blogging world, right?

08:20.720 --> 08:22.400
Some crap is what it is.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.400
Yeah.

08:23.400 --> 08:26.840
So AOL is a bunch of shits.

08:26.840 --> 08:27.840
And that's the news.

08:27.840 --> 08:28.840
That's the news.

08:28.840 --> 08:29.840
Okay.

08:29.840 --> 08:30.840
Well, it's business.

08:30.840 --> 08:35.160
You know, I can't say that the whole company is a bunch of shits, but it's a shitty decision.

08:35.160 --> 08:44.400
So Joystiq has basically been dissolved by AOL along with Wow Insider and Massively.

08:44.400 --> 08:50.600
There are layoffs of their staff with Joystiq 13 staffers laid off.

08:50.600 --> 08:54.760
The Massively folks are going to be out of work by February 3rd.

08:54.760 --> 08:59.000
And Wow Insider has also lost their staff.

08:59.040 --> 09:05.800
So basically three whole sections of video game joy on the internet, some of the last

09:05.800 --> 09:10.200
bastions of decent news are gone.

09:10.200 --> 09:17.120
So as of February 3rd, which might as well be today.

09:17.120 --> 09:19.480
Which I would say this.

09:19.480 --> 09:23.520
If you want to petition about something, fucking petition about that.

09:24.520 --> 09:29.000
If you show them that they're going to be losing a potential source of a big source

09:29.000 --> 09:34.240
of revenue, this is...

09:34.240 --> 09:35.800
Here's my concern.

09:35.800 --> 09:40.760
And I absolutely say this with no disrespect to these companies or the people that work

09:40.760 --> 09:46.840
there because as much as I razz the big corporate blogs sometimes, and obviously AOL is going

09:46.840 --> 09:49.000
to be corporate when you're owned by AOL.

09:49.000 --> 09:53.400
I'm very much, and I've always been about support indie podcasting, support indie blogging

09:53.400 --> 09:56.760
and this stuff that's homegrown.

09:56.760 --> 10:02.720
I always, I did have a place for Joystiq and the AOL blogs in my heart.

10:02.720 --> 10:06.680
And part of that was because I felt like they were one of the rare blogs.

10:06.680 --> 10:10.080
And when I say they, I mean Joystiq, Wow Insider, Massively, all of them.

10:10.080 --> 10:14.440
They were one of the rare blogs that really kind of treated a lot of what they saw in

10:14.440 --> 10:15.880
the indie scene.

10:15.960 --> 10:19.920
Not just indie development games, but indie development publishing and podcasting and

10:19.920 --> 10:22.560
everything as something that's like, they're equal.

10:22.560 --> 10:27.920
I never felt like poo-pooed by anybody that had worked at Joystiq or any of these other

10:27.920 --> 10:28.920
organizations.

10:28.920 --> 10:35.560
I felt there was like, there's a common respect and a common decency and sense of, I guess,

10:35.560 --> 10:39.800
decency there that I'm going to be honest, keeping it real, I haven't felt from other

10:39.800 --> 10:40.800
places.

10:40.800 --> 10:41.800
I'm not going to name names.

10:41.800 --> 10:42.880
I'm not going to focus on negatives.

10:42.880 --> 10:47.080
But all that stuff aside, I just kind of feel like there was a lot of real decent stuff

10:47.080 --> 10:48.800
happening at Joystiq.

10:48.800 --> 10:51.080
And it kind of blows my mind.

10:51.080 --> 10:57.320
Obviously one of the big hot button issues in last year's was ethics and games journalism.

10:57.320 --> 11:01.360
I'm not going to go too far down that slippery slope.

11:01.360 --> 11:05.760
But what concerns me here is that I see people celebrating the loss of these blogs.

11:05.760 --> 11:09.940
And I don't think there's anything to celebrate when these were some of the most ethical people

11:09.940 --> 11:12.280
that were still around in what they were doing.

11:12.280 --> 11:16.680
They don't run headlines that were clickbait like we see a lot of other sites do.

11:16.680 --> 11:20.300
I mean, you guys know what game blogs out there do this consistently and you see it

11:20.300 --> 11:21.740
shared on Facebook.

11:21.740 --> 11:27.160
It's like, you know, check out these 12 hot cosplays from such and such that are very

11:27.160 --> 11:30.680
only like tangentially related to video games.

11:30.680 --> 11:33.320
I wish you guys could hear how hard I'm rolling my eyes.

11:33.320 --> 11:36.400
Whereas Joystiq wasn't really about that.

11:36.400 --> 11:39.760
And I always kind of, you know, I really, really respected them for that.

11:39.760 --> 11:43.720
So I feel the pain of their loss.

11:43.720 --> 11:48.020
Now to go to the part that I wanted to follow up to what Jamie was saying with, you know,

11:48.020 --> 11:50.500
a big source of revenue and so forth.

11:50.500 --> 11:54.680
Here's the hard question is, was it a big source of revenue?

11:54.680 --> 12:00.840
Because I'm not as much as I liked reading it and I like supporting them and so forth.

12:00.840 --> 12:04.840
Is there a lot of money to be made in that arena anymore?

12:04.840 --> 12:10.200
And I'm not so sure there is, especially when tons and tons of people are using ad block

12:10.200 --> 12:12.320
these days.

12:12.320 --> 12:16.040
Where was Joystiq making money?

12:16.040 --> 12:20.880
Or a lot of these corporate blogs, for crying out loud.

12:20.880 --> 12:28.080
And I think a lot of these things that tailor headlines that foster the Facebook shares

12:28.080 --> 12:32.620
and these clickbait articles and things like that, they get enough advertising revenue

12:32.620 --> 12:35.860
from the people maybe that don't use ad block or whatever.

12:35.860 --> 12:40.700
But unfortunately, these people who run their ships a little more ethically, like Joystiq

12:40.700 --> 12:47.180
did, unfortunately, I think probably did end up costing money to run.

12:47.180 --> 12:48.180
And it sucks.

12:48.180 --> 12:53.280
Like, I mean, it's not an easy thing to say, but I think that's just the reality, you guys.

12:53.280 --> 12:54.980
How was Joystiq making money?

12:54.980 --> 12:59.580
I'm not so sure that, you know, you weren't paying to access it.

12:59.580 --> 13:02.060
I bet a ton of you have ad blocker running.

13:02.060 --> 13:03.620
Did you whitelist Joystiq?

13:03.620 --> 13:04.620
Yeah.

13:04.620 --> 13:05.700
I did too.

13:05.700 --> 13:06.700
I did too.

13:06.700 --> 13:08.380
But I bet there's a lot of people out there that didn't.

13:08.380 --> 13:11.360
You know, and I'm not trying to make you feel bad, but I think that's also just the reality

13:11.360 --> 13:12.360
of where we are.

13:12.360 --> 13:16.020
And I think that's a lot, I mean, a lot of people just, you know, a lot of websites you

13:16.020 --> 13:21.180
may block ads on, but I say, yeah, maybe that's me, unfortunately, because they didn't go

13:21.180 --> 13:25.700
that route of trying to be clickbaity with your headlines that they didn't get a lot

13:25.700 --> 13:29.100
of those shares or something on social media.

13:29.100 --> 13:32.020
Maybe that was the case.

13:32.060 --> 13:34.460
Let's see, go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

13:34.460 --> 13:37.820
SHA100Matt says, yep, if people clicked on more ads, maybe they would have a case in

13:37.820 --> 13:41.460
terms of revenue, but Joystiq doesn't really sell anything.

13:41.460 --> 13:45.660
Let's see, RageNator says, the one big site that I really read was 1UP.com, but they bit

13:45.660 --> 13:47.160
the dust.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.980
Let's see, Dungeon Buster says, I drifted away from Joystiq years ago, but not because

13:49.980 --> 13:54.900
of any ethics or issue with their reportage, just so many other sites arrive later to satisfy

13:54.900 --> 13:55.900
my news needs.

13:55.900 --> 14:01.900
Well, you know, and to be fair, there's a lot of, and I'm not accusing Joystiq of this,

14:01.900 --> 14:05.960
I'm saying there is a lot of out there in the games journalism world, there's a lot

14:05.960 --> 14:10.420
of copy paste journalism that goes on out there, you know, and I think there are a lot

14:10.420 --> 14:14.900
of places for people to get news and thanks to things like Twitter and Facebook that keep

14:14.900 --> 14:20.460
us a little more tapped in, I think people get their news maybe a little more directly

14:20.460 --> 14:24.000
on social feeds where you don't necessarily even have to click over to a site like Joystiq

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
to see it.

14:25.000 --> 14:29.720
And I think all those little things kind of hurt them, you know, collectively.

14:29.720 --> 14:34.720
And again, I so apologize if any, I don't think any of those staffers happen to listen

14:34.720 --> 14:38.240
to this show, but if you do, trust me, my heart goes out to you guys and I'm so sorry

14:38.240 --> 14:39.880
if it sounds like I'm being a jerk right now.

14:39.880 --> 14:43.480
And on top of that, the fact that they had the, they ran a story about, you know, their

14:43.480 --> 14:46.760
site closing, they didn't even have an answer from, you know.

14:46.760 --> 14:47.760
Yeah.

14:47.760 --> 14:51.280
And there's that shady shit too, where it's like, you know, maybe they were making tons

14:51.280 --> 14:52.280
of money.

14:52.280 --> 14:55.080
Yeah, that's pretty nice to hear that your job's gone from somebody else other than,

14:55.080 --> 14:56.080
you know, your boss.

14:56.080 --> 14:57.680
That part's pretty shit.

14:57.680 --> 15:04.240
I mean, here's, okay, here's the silver lining at the end, and maybe there will be another

15:04.240 --> 15:09.620
website that will pick up a lot of these writers, but I just really hope there's no pressure

15:09.620 --> 15:13.200
to make these writers make more clickbaity headlines.

15:13.200 --> 15:17.440
I really hope that isn't what it turns into because that, I don't think that's what anybody

15:17.440 --> 15:22.480
wants to see happen here out of this is, you know, it's gotta be more TMZ style stuff in

15:22.480 --> 15:23.480
order to get clicks.

15:23.480 --> 15:26.760
I really hope that doesn't happen, but here's an interesting comment in our chat room again

15:26.760 --> 15:29.800
over at live.vognetwork.com.

15:29.800 --> 15:34.840
Apricot Sushi says, I think the fact we're seeing a lot of people turn to Patreon while

15:34.840 --> 15:38.200
big sites are getting cuts and going under says a lot.

15:38.200 --> 15:43.440
Well, I think it's inevitable, and I'm almost positive, and I could be end up proving wrong,

15:43.440 --> 15:48.040
being proved wrong, but I'm almost positive at least the WoW Insider branch, you're gonna

15:48.040 --> 15:53.320
see either a Patreon or a Kickstarter coming from those guys next week because in their

15:53.320 --> 15:59.680
goodbye note, they were like, you should follow us on Twitter, and on February 3rd,

15:59.680 --> 16:03.480
you never know what the future might hold, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, like just put it

16:03.480 --> 16:08.040
on a neon sign already, and believe me, I'm not blaming those guys for doing it.

16:08.040 --> 16:15.840
If you're gonna do this Patreon or a Kickstarter route, strike while the iron is hot, you know,

16:15.840 --> 16:20.480
people are gonna miss these sites when they're gone, and they're realizing that right now,

16:20.480 --> 16:23.360
so would people be willing to pay for these sites?

16:23.360 --> 16:25.400
I bet they would right now.

16:25.400 --> 16:29.800
The longer you go on, I think the harder it's gonna be to justify, but especially something

16:29.800 --> 16:36.000
like World of Warcraft that has a very tight-knit community, Blizzard has a lot of very rabid

16:36.000 --> 16:40.840
fans that will support games that when Blizzard makes it, they'll play it, but if another

16:40.840 --> 16:46.560
company makes it, they won't play it, consider what I'm talking about there with games like

16:46.560 --> 16:49.320
Heroes of the Storm and Overwatch, right?

16:49.320 --> 16:55.680
So there's a very loyal base there that I think will bolster up and support WoW Insider

16:55.680 --> 16:58.000
specifically, because that's kind of the one.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.320
Joystiq hasn't really hinted if they're planning anything like that massively, I have no idea

17:02.320 --> 17:06.340
what they're planning either, but it seems like especially with the WoW Insider branch,

17:06.340 --> 17:09.400
that's almost a given that that's what's gonna happen next week, is that there's gonna be

17:09.400 --> 17:14.720
a Patreon or a Kickstarter to keep them going, so hopefully they will get the money to keep

17:14.720 --> 17:17.880
their thing going, but how long?

17:17.880 --> 17:19.320
A year?

17:19.320 --> 17:20.320
Three years?

17:20.320 --> 17:21.320
Who knows?

17:21.320 --> 17:22.320
So.

17:22.320 --> 17:30.840
Anyway, I'm sad to hear about this loss again, you know, Joystiq was a blog that I would

17:30.840 --> 17:35.740
visit on a regular basis, I thought they were great, and you know, even some of the few

17:35.740 --> 17:40.080
things that we've done on this show that went viral, quote-unquote, like the whole, you

17:40.080 --> 17:43.480
know, you guys remember years and years ago, there was a whole president cat thing, and

17:43.480 --> 17:47.720
we had a good time here on OLR, we were joking around about a Japanese game, Sukiban, so

17:47.720 --> 17:52.480
I ran a Wii, that was about a cat that was all these little different mini games, and

17:52.480 --> 17:55.960
Jamie said, oh, I think it translates kind of loosely to President Cat, and I'm like,

17:55.960 --> 17:59.160
that's an awesome name for a game, let's have President Cat on the Wii, and why don't we

17:59.160 --> 18:03.400
get games like this out here, and we started tweeting them, and the company noticed, right?

18:03.400 --> 18:07.400
Well, Joystiq actually was like the first major blog to run a story on that, and I always

18:07.400 --> 18:10.800
thought that was like really cool, I was like, wow, they're like tapped into indie sources

18:10.800 --> 18:11.800
like that, you know?

18:11.800 --> 18:13.640
Or even before that Katamari.

18:13.640 --> 18:18.400
Yeah, and then, so it wasn't just the good news, but the not so good news, right?

18:18.400 --> 18:22.800
Like the time that we posted some information that Namco didn't like that we posted, and

18:22.800 --> 18:27.840
that went viral too, but again, I mean, despite the fact that that one was a little more painful

18:27.840 --> 18:33.160
for us, it was still that they were tuned into what was going on in the indie world

18:33.160 --> 18:39.360
as well as the PR, the things that they were getting handed from PR, which I wouldn't be

18:39.360 --> 18:42.560
surprised if some of the Joystiq people end up in those positions where they're, you know,

18:42.560 --> 18:49.000
doing PR and other types of, you know, on the other side of it for companies, big companies.

18:49.000 --> 18:56.720
So, let's see, going again for some more comments from our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

18:56.720 --> 19:02.800
Let's see, Dungeon Buster says, specialist sites have also added to the competition.

19:02.800 --> 19:08.040
If I want pure industry news, I can go to places like Develop or Game Biz.

19:08.040 --> 19:11.080
Tao says, I stopped going to any gaming site.

19:11.080 --> 19:13.400
I just can't take the comments.

19:13.400 --> 19:16.400
They make me lose faith on the human race.

19:16.400 --> 19:21.640
Well, unfortunately, we don't have a lot, a lot, a lot of articles at vognetwork.com.

19:21.640 --> 19:26.080
I mean, we just, we can't, right now, we're not at a stage where we can afford to pay

19:26.080 --> 19:30.780
people to do articles, but if people want practice or resume type stuff, we're always

19:30.780 --> 19:34.840
looking for people to write stuff, and so we do have some people that write some things

19:34.840 --> 19:35.840
very limited.

19:35.840 --> 19:40.540
If we do ever turn a profit, I'd be happy to pay writers.

19:40.540 --> 19:42.240
We get some of that coming on vognetwork.com.

19:42.240 --> 19:48.680
We moderate comments, all of them, so, you know, and obviously our site is family enough

19:48.680 --> 19:53.420
where that's not really a problem for us yet, but you never know what's going to go viral.

19:53.420 --> 19:57.080
You just never know what's going to go viral, and then once it goes viral, then everybody's

19:57.080 --> 19:59.920
got something to say, so.

19:59.920 --> 20:01.760
You know what the rule, the stem of the problem is?

20:01.760 --> 20:02.760
What's that?

20:02.920 --> 20:06.920
Too many of those free month subscriptions at AOL.

20:06.920 --> 20:09.840
It just hurt them so much that it just can't recover.

20:09.840 --> 20:14.040
Those fortresses built out of the free discs, the free sample discs.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.040
Just did them in.

20:15.040 --> 20:16.040
Oh boy, alright.

20:16.040 --> 20:22.920
Anyhow, so, having a drink, throwing one back for our friends over at AOL, Joystiq, WoW

20:22.920 --> 20:24.960
Insider, and Massively.

20:24.960 --> 20:30.360
May y'all, and I should say, because it's not picked up in any of the game blogs, but

20:30.360 --> 20:34.600
there's another AOL blog that I read quite frequently, the unofficial Apple web blog,

20:34.600 --> 20:38.360
TUAW, that was also impacted by this, and they're getting shuttered.

20:38.360 --> 20:44.440
So pouring out a 40 to all those fine blogs over at AOL, and may y'all land on your feet

20:44.440 --> 20:46.240
real soon.

20:46.240 --> 20:50.920
At least y'all have the respect of a lot of people in the industry, and so I think with

20:50.920 --> 20:54.880
that on your resume and considering the situations, I think y'all are going to bounce back real

20:54.880 --> 20:55.880
quick.

20:55.880 --> 20:56.880
I really hope so.

20:56.880 --> 20:57.880
I really hope so.

20:57.880 --> 20:59.480
And hey, you won't be working for AOL anymore.

20:59.480 --> 21:01.600
Thumbs up.

21:01.600 --> 21:03.160
Try to look for the silver lining.

21:03.160 --> 21:07.800
Alright, let's get into some of the regular segments we do here at Orange Launch Radio,

21:07.800 --> 21:12.040
and then we'll get into some other news going on this week, but yeah, not a lot of great

21:12.040 --> 21:13.040
news this week, guys.

21:13.040 --> 21:14.040
I don't know.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.040
I don't know.

21:15.040 --> 21:18.060
Anyway, let's try to cheer things up a little bit with the games themselves.

21:18.060 --> 21:21.160
You know, sometimes we play video games to put us in a better mood, and talk about the

21:21.160 --> 21:25.280
games that we've been playing this week with How Was Your Gaming Week?

21:25.280 --> 21:28.120
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

21:28.120 --> 21:29.520
I really didn't play too much.

21:29.520 --> 21:34.840
I did some Dragon Age, but other than that, no, I did play some Final Fantasy XIV for

21:34.840 --> 21:41.200
a little bit on Monday, but really, I haven't really done much else in terms of gaming just

21:41.200 --> 21:47.100
because it's been a really stupidly, stupidly busy week.

21:47.100 --> 21:55.360
That and I did buy somebody in this little group of ours a game that I am going to request

21:55.360 --> 22:01.560
that he play as soon as he gets a chance to.

22:01.560 --> 22:05.840
I will not say what it is until said person is ready to announce it.

22:05.840 --> 22:10.600
Well, doesn't he have to finish the previous one?

22:10.600 --> 22:11.940
No.

22:11.940 --> 22:17.480
He needs to go right into the second one, because, okay, I'll just fuckin' say it.

22:17.480 --> 22:20.960
I bought Rob Five Nights at Freddy's 2, and he's gotta play it.

22:20.960 --> 22:24.280
I don't care if he's finished the first one, he has to play it, because the third one's

22:24.280 --> 22:25.280
coming out.

22:25.280 --> 22:27.400
Yeah, I did see that in my Steam library.

22:27.400 --> 22:31.200
I have to do the VoG Jam stream first, which is still something, or the YouTubes.

22:31.200 --> 22:35.200
I'm not gonna end up doing a live stream anymore, because all the games run in different resolutions

22:35.200 --> 22:39.020
and things, so I'm gonna just make a variety of YouTubes, but until I finish that project,

22:39.020 --> 22:40.880
no live streams.

22:40.880 --> 22:42.600
But that will be on the list.

22:42.600 --> 22:46.700
Hopefully, I can get Shane to come over, or maybe you to come over, and you guys can taunt

22:46.700 --> 22:48.720
me a little bit while I play.

22:48.720 --> 22:51.700
I'm sure it'll be a hoot and a holler.

22:51.740 --> 22:55.660
Just in time for Five Nights at Freddy's 3, which I'm sure is coming out very soon.

22:55.660 --> 22:58.460
I really wish that would become a movie series.

22:58.460 --> 22:59.460
It might.

22:59.460 --> 23:00.460
I think it could.

23:00.460 --> 23:06.580
I think it probably should, honestly, because it's such a simple premise, and, you know,

23:06.580 --> 23:12.260
I mean, hell, they're remaking, like, really shitty movies now, so why not just do one

23:12.260 --> 23:13.260
of those?

23:13.260 --> 23:16.460
It's starting to become a Minecraft-level phenomenon.

23:16.460 --> 23:21.380
I mean, maybe not that big, because it's gonna be harder to market it towards kids.

23:21.380 --> 23:24.140
I think it's a...

23:24.140 --> 23:29.620
You can't just compare A to B, but it is definitely, like, a phenomenon in the style of Minecraft.

23:29.620 --> 23:33.700
I think there's so much, like, lore and all this other stuff that people are...

23:33.700 --> 23:34.700
That's the part I like about it.

23:34.700 --> 23:41.340
I can't play the games for shit, but I watch the videos and read the crap about it.

23:41.340 --> 23:45.240
And that, going back and reading, like, the actual case that they theorized it was based

23:45.240 --> 23:48.800
off of, it was...

23:48.800 --> 23:49.800
That creeped me out.

23:50.440 --> 23:53.760
The fact that the original thing happened, with that, what was it, a Chuck E. Cheese

23:53.760 --> 23:54.760
or something?

23:54.760 --> 23:55.760
Yeah.

23:55.760 --> 23:56.760
Yeah.

23:56.760 --> 23:57.760
A showbiz pizza, I think.

23:57.760 --> 23:58.760
Yeah, it was a showbiz.

23:58.760 --> 23:59.760
What it was back in the day.

23:59.760 --> 24:00.760
It's saying Pizza Time Theater.

24:00.760 --> 24:01.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:01.760 --> 24:03.400
All right, so, if that's it for your gaming week...

24:03.400 --> 24:04.400
Thank you, Nolan Bushnell.

24:04.400 --> 24:07.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

24:07.000 --> 24:08.280
I didn't play a whole ton.

24:08.280 --> 24:12.440
I was actually working on my game most of the week, and I've gotten...

24:12.440 --> 24:15.760
I'm trying to get to the point where I can just, like, play a level, and then once I

24:15.760 --> 24:20.640
get that, I can actually just start building levels for it.

24:20.640 --> 24:26.120
So I have the starting sequence part done for each level, and then I was just working

24:26.120 --> 24:28.640
on the finishing thing.

24:28.640 --> 24:36.240
The problem is my logo that I did in 3D for, like, the end part when you finish a race.

24:36.240 --> 24:38.120
It didn't look very good.

24:38.120 --> 24:42.660
Just shot straight on, because it's black and white, so it looked 2D almost.

24:42.660 --> 24:46.700
So I needed it kind of spinning towards the camera to make it look cooler.

24:46.700 --> 24:53.980
So I'm working on that, and then my cat decides to start programming last night, and so she

24:53.980 --> 25:00.540
sat down on my laptop and did a fighter plays on all of my scripts in my game, and so I

25:00.540 --> 25:01.540
had to fix that.

25:01.540 --> 25:05.940
Thankfully, that was pretty quick to fix, and, you know, she's so jealous.

25:05.940 --> 25:06.940
I swear to God.

25:06.940 --> 25:10.260
It's like, you're not paying attention to me all the time.

25:10.260 --> 25:12.260
What the hell?

25:12.260 --> 25:14.300
So I did that, and then actual game playing.

25:14.300 --> 25:17.700
I played more of LEGO Marvel Super Hero just because my son's playing it.

25:17.700 --> 25:21.920
I'm already finished with the game, so there's not really much more I need to do with it,

25:21.920 --> 25:26.460
other than I just messing around with some of the glitches in the game and stuff.

25:26.460 --> 25:28.020
So that was fun.

25:28.020 --> 25:29.220
And what else?

25:29.220 --> 25:31.380
Oh, watch some more awesome games done quick.

25:31.380 --> 25:40.020
Like I watched the run for I Wanna Be the Boshi and New Super Mario Bros. and, oh,

25:40.020 --> 25:42.540
New Super Mario Bros Wii.

25:42.540 --> 25:44.620
What else?

25:44.620 --> 25:49.500
Part of the Portal 2 run, but I fell asleep, so, oh well.

25:49.500 --> 25:51.500
But I'm really digging that stuff.

25:51.500 --> 25:56.660
I do want to play some more Gata the Hell, but I just haven't gotten around to it.

25:56.660 --> 26:01.140
And I don't know, I've been looking at my PlayStation Network library and I'm like,

26:01.140 --> 26:04.860
crap, man, I've got a lot of stuff that I haven't touched on there yet.

26:04.860 --> 26:08.060
Like I bought Battlefield 4 a while ago, I'm like, shit, I haven't even played that.

26:08.060 --> 26:12.420
And then my stack of games I bought when I got the system, I'm like, shit, I still haven't

26:12.420 --> 26:16.220
even played Watch Dogs or Destiny yet, and it's just sitting in the case, just collecting

26:16.220 --> 26:17.220
dust.

26:17.220 --> 26:19.580
So I've got a lot of stuff to play.

26:19.580 --> 26:20.580
After I finish my game.

26:20.580 --> 26:21.580
Alright.

26:21.580 --> 26:22.580
And then my other game.

26:22.580 --> 26:24.540
Good priorities, good priorities.

26:24.540 --> 26:25.540
My gaming week.

26:25.540 --> 26:30.340
Actually, I've had a pretty active gaming week, although not a lot of new stuff to note,

26:30.340 --> 26:34.180
since not a lot of new stuff has been coming out, but I was continuing to play Fantasy

26:34.180 --> 26:35.860
Life earlier this week.

26:35.860 --> 26:36.860
And I've been having fun with that.

26:36.860 --> 26:41.060
I started to get into some of the crafting a little bit since I was doing a wizard for

26:41.060 --> 26:42.060
my life in the beginning.

26:42.060 --> 26:46.220
I was like, oh, let me try going into, I think they call it tailor cloth crafting, whatever.

26:46.220 --> 26:49.700
I think it's a tailor to see if I can maybe make myself some armor.

26:49.700 --> 26:51.860
So you know, it's kind of playing a little bit of that story.

26:51.860 --> 26:55.980
And now I'm like, oh, maybe I should get into gathering and I can totally see where this

26:55.980 --> 27:00.300
is like a gamer add like me guys worst nightmare because it's like, oh, I want to play a little

27:00.300 --> 27:01.300
bit of this.

27:01.300 --> 27:03.540
Oh, but then I want to play a little bit of this because I always see these little mind

27:03.540 --> 27:04.540
things everywhere.

27:04.540 --> 27:05.540
I want to mind those.

27:05.540 --> 27:06.540
Oh, and I want to fish and I've got to do this.

27:06.540 --> 27:09.300
And I'm never going to get anywhere in that game because I'm going to keep getting distracted

27:09.300 --> 27:11.780
by all these different things there is to do.

27:11.780 --> 27:15.140
Dude, level five is really good at making grind fests.

27:15.140 --> 27:19.020
They are very, very good at making grind fests and, but Fantasy Life is good.

27:19.020 --> 27:21.660
I talked about that last week and I'm having fun with that game.

27:21.660 --> 27:23.020
Let's see.

27:23.020 --> 27:25.220
So was playing a little bit of that.

27:25.220 --> 27:30.460
A lot of Diablo three on PC with the season is ending on Tuesday.

27:30.460 --> 27:33.820
So Alan has actually been very helpful.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.500
He's been playing a lot more than me.

27:35.500 --> 27:40.420
He's going to hit Paragon 300 tonight on his seasonal character, 300 Paragon levels.

27:40.420 --> 27:42.520
He was at like two 96 or something before the show.

27:42.520 --> 27:43.980
So he'll definitely hit that tonight.

27:43.980 --> 27:47.100
I'm at maybe one 50.

27:47.100 --> 27:52.780
I mean, I've been playing a lot, but not like a lot, but I've been having fun and Alan helped

27:52.780 --> 27:53.780
me get some achievements.

27:53.780 --> 27:59.020
We finally, uh, we killed, uh, this guy on torment six, you have to get to get an achievement.

27:59.020 --> 28:02.480
It's like this complicated thing where you have to build all these keys, these, some

28:02.480 --> 28:03.480
of the boss.

28:03.480 --> 28:04.480
And we did that.

28:04.480 --> 28:08.260
We got to greater lift rift level 30, which I didn't think I'd be able to see on my wizard,

28:08.260 --> 28:11.220
but by golly, we did it and got a new place on the scoreboard.

28:11.220 --> 28:12.460
So that was all really exciting.

28:12.460 --> 28:14.360
So that was seasonal on a PC.

28:14.360 --> 28:17.900
I haven't been playing as much on PlayStation four, but a friend of mine picked it up on

28:17.900 --> 28:20.000
PS four and I know I have other friends that play on there.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.660
So probably what I'll do in the downtime between seasons on PC, I'm probably going

28:23.660 --> 28:27.900
to try to pick up PS four because it is still one of my goals this year to get my platinum

28:27.900 --> 28:29.180
trophy in Diablo.

28:29.180 --> 28:30.180
Dang it.

28:30.180 --> 28:32.340
So that's something I will certainly work on.

28:32.340 --> 28:34.780
So, uh, yeah, I played a little bit of that as well.

28:34.780 --> 28:38.100
Um, so yeah, kind of a, a lot of the same stuff.

28:38.100 --> 28:40.940
I'm like some final fantasy 14 here and there a little bit.

28:40.940 --> 28:46.460
I did some geometry wars three earlier today, um, but not a lot, a lot of new stuff to note.

28:46.460 --> 28:52.460
Um, one other thing I will mention, uh, princess Irene, who was on the show a few weeks ago,

28:52.900 --> 28:55.140
she does her other show, uh, the multi-tap podcast.

28:55.140 --> 28:56.940
She was here promoting that.

28:56.940 --> 29:01.320
Uh, she called me up the other day and was like, let's go play DDR.

29:01.320 --> 29:03.700
And I was like, Oh my gosh, it's been forever.

29:03.700 --> 29:04.700
Why not?

29:04.700 --> 29:06.260
Let's go play DDR like old school times.

29:06.260 --> 29:09.340
So we actually went out to Roseville golf land, which, which really is where this show

29:09.340 --> 29:10.740
was born.

29:10.740 --> 29:17.780
Despite the sad commentary, you mean spawned from the pits, uh, despite where, uh, you

29:17.780 --> 29:21.820
know, despite the state of arcades today and the fact that it's like, it's all like ticket

29:21.820 --> 29:25.520
grabbing machines now, I did see some pretty cool arcade cabinets.

29:25.520 --> 29:27.600
So they had a Mario Kart deluxe.

29:27.600 --> 29:31.180
I did not know there was now a Mario Kart deluxe cabinet and it looked fancy.

29:31.180 --> 29:35.340
I didn't get a chance to play it cause there was just kids nonstop going through that game,

29:35.340 --> 29:36.340
but it looked really fun.

29:36.340 --> 29:37.340
Uh, sad though.

29:37.340 --> 29:40.380
It was like the Mario Kart tracks on the arcade games are so like blah.

29:40.380 --> 29:43.980
It's just like, yeah, it's like, Ooh, well it's a loop.

29:43.980 --> 29:44.980
They were in the early games.

29:44.980 --> 29:45.980
I don't know about deluxe though.

29:45.980 --> 29:46.980
I haven't played deluxe yet.

29:46.980 --> 29:49.580
So at least for the first couple.

29:49.580 --> 29:53.460
Um, so, but I saw, I was like, wow, those are some fancy looking cabs.

29:53.460 --> 29:56.180
Uh, so we played a little bit of DDR, so that was fun.

29:56.180 --> 30:01.780
Uh, we were playing some max two for you, uh, old school DDR fans, but man, when you

30:01.780 --> 30:04.820
don't play DDR for a long time, you really lose stamina.

30:04.820 --> 30:05.820
Okay.

30:05.820 --> 30:09.740
So like Irene and I were like, all right, we'll do some, we'll do some standard and

30:09.740 --> 30:12.620
some basic songs, red foot and yellow foot songs.

30:12.620 --> 30:14.300
We were, we were doing okay on that.

30:14.300 --> 30:18.980
So then for the last song I was like, okay, we got to try and do something on maniac.

30:18.980 --> 30:20.420
Let's do something on maniac.

30:20.420 --> 30:22.660
So I put it on the hardest difficulty green feet.

30:22.660 --> 30:23.660
Right.

30:23.660 --> 30:25.460
And I was like, let's do blow my whistle, baby.

30:25.460 --> 30:26.460
Everybody.

30:26.460 --> 30:27.460
Everybody remembers that song, right?

30:27.460 --> 30:35.060
If you've ever walked by a DDR max two machine, you've heard that you've heard this song before,

30:35.060 --> 30:36.060
right?

30:36.060 --> 30:37.660
It's really annoying and awesome to play.

30:37.660 --> 30:41.540
Uh, but it's only like a seven foot song, so it won't be that hard, right?

30:41.540 --> 30:42.900
Oh my God.

30:42.900 --> 30:47.380
Because the seven footer is usually like nonstop running and jumping and all that stuff.

30:47.380 --> 30:55.240
Like at the end of it, I was, I was like having a full on as I, I, I, I remember even

30:55.240 --> 31:01.680
just trying like basic stuff in the last time I played, I need to get my stamina back out

31:01.680 --> 31:02.680
of shape.

31:02.680 --> 31:04.980
Oh, I need to get my stamina back.

31:04.980 --> 31:10.260
Uh, and uh, then for the very, very, very last song, you know, Irene and I said, okay,

31:10.260 --> 31:11.820
this is the last song we're going to do all day.

31:11.820 --> 31:12.820
This is fine.

31:12.820 --> 31:14.500
So I was like, all right, fuck it.

31:14.500 --> 31:16.960
Let's do, let's do another maniac song.

31:16.960 --> 31:27.960
She put it on a Ryan seven, eight, which is the, like, I'd cue up the MP3.

31:27.960 --> 31:31.880
I love it when you sing DDR songs, Loki, but that's honestly what it sounds like.

31:31.880 --> 31:33.840
But the, I will never, okay.

31:33.840 --> 31:38.880
So the, the, the pattern that you dance to in the song, do, do, do, do, do, do, do,

31:38.880 --> 31:41.320
do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.

31:41.320 --> 31:45.560
That's how fast your feet are moving and that do jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump,

31:45.560 --> 31:48.680
jump, jump, jump, jump, like that's how fast your feet are moving.

31:48.680 --> 31:49.680
Right?

31:49.680 --> 31:55.400
So I did that one on nine footer and I'm very proud because my 36 year old ass got a 300

31:55.400 --> 32:00.600
combo and I damn near full combo the whole song I fucked up in the last six measures

32:00.600 --> 32:01.600
though.

32:01.600 --> 32:05.080
Like there's just too much going on at the end, but I, I was so close to a full combo

32:05.080 --> 32:07.460
and I was like, this old guy still got it.

32:07.460 --> 32:10.060
So that felt pretty good to be able to do that.

32:10.060 --> 32:13.540
It has kind of motivated me a little bit to try and get my stamina back a little bit.

32:13.540 --> 32:17.020
So I need to like do one of those like couch to 5k type things or something.

32:17.020 --> 32:18.340
Just something to get me in the habit of moving.

32:18.340 --> 32:19.340
Couch to nine feet.

32:19.340 --> 32:20.500
What do they call that?

32:20.500 --> 32:21.500
It's a couch to 5k.

32:21.500 --> 32:22.500
Is that what?

32:22.500 --> 32:23.500
Okay.

32:23.500 --> 32:24.500
But it should be, um, we should do a...

32:24.500 --> 32:25.500
Oh, couch to nine footer.

32:25.500 --> 32:26.500
Couch to nine feet.

32:26.500 --> 32:27.500
I get it now.

32:27.500 --> 32:28.500
Yeah.

32:28.500 --> 32:29.580
Uh, I, I really do want to do something like that.

32:29.580 --> 32:33.420
I was never skinnier in my life than the years I played DDR.

32:33.420 --> 32:37.060
Of course it helped that I was dating a vegan who really loved to cook.

32:37.060 --> 32:39.700
And so like vegans don't eat.

32:39.700 --> 32:44.020
I don't even know, like, you know, the newer machines, like they don't even have the same

32:44.020 --> 32:45.020
foot levels anywhere.

32:45.020 --> 32:48.420
I'm like, I don't understand, you know, what these levels are anymore.

32:48.420 --> 32:49.420
Yeah, no, I know.

32:49.420 --> 32:50.940
Well, it was a max two machine.

32:50.940 --> 32:54.740
I can, I can speak max to max two, maybe extreme.

32:54.740 --> 32:56.340
That was back from my day stream.

32:56.340 --> 32:59.540
It's like kind of, eh, no.

32:59.540 --> 33:03.420
So anyway, and then, uh, Alan alchemy's in chat reminding me of something else we saw,

33:03.420 --> 33:07.380
uh, over at Roseau golf land, a fucking candy crush arcade game.

33:07.380 --> 33:10.500
They had a fucking flappy bird and a candy crush.

33:10.500 --> 33:14.860
Like all these fucking iPhone games are becoming arcade games that shoot out tickets.

33:14.860 --> 33:22.580
Why would you play a game that's free, but instead pay money because you get tickets

33:22.580 --> 33:25.220
and you can redeem those tickets for crap.

33:25.220 --> 33:30.100
I'm surprised the tickets don't get you codes to get something in the game on your iPhone.

33:30.100 --> 33:31.100
The camp flappy bird.

33:31.100 --> 33:33.300
Oh, just to get good, give it full circle.

33:33.300 --> 33:35.060
Why not gives you, what is it?

33:35.060 --> 33:38.740
Like little gum drop bombs or whatever the fuck they are in candy crush.

33:38.740 --> 33:43.660
You can trade in tickets and get a code for some of those on iTunes or Google play or

33:43.660 --> 33:44.660
whatever.

33:44.660 --> 33:45.660
Surprise.

33:45.660 --> 33:46.700
I wouldn't be surprised off.

33:46.700 --> 33:47.700
That was the thing.

33:47.700 --> 33:48.700
They bring it full circle.

33:48.700 --> 33:49.700
All right.

33:49.700 --> 33:50.700
Anyway, that was my gaming week.

33:50.700 --> 33:54.900
Very long winded, but, uh, you know, a little trip to the arcades and all that good stuff.

33:54.900 --> 34:00.300
Um, before we get into tonight's gaming news, some quick housekeeping, uh, we will be here

34:00.300 --> 34:01.740
throughout the coming weeks.

34:01.740 --> 34:04.660
No shows off planned yet, except maybe in early March.

34:04.660 --> 34:05.900
That's still developing.

34:05.900 --> 34:10.580
Uh, however, you can always friend us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

34:10.580 --> 34:16.100
You can also friend us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. And we are going to be debuting

34:16.100 --> 34:17.140
a new segment tonight.

34:17.140 --> 34:20.940
As Jason mentioned in the intro, I'll tell you more about that at the beginning of part

34:20.940 --> 34:23.740
B is where we're going to put it right before we get into rapid fire news.

34:23.740 --> 34:27.560
I'll talk to you more about that when we get there and try something new based on some

34:27.560 --> 34:31.380
things you guys said last week, believe it or not, this is, this is an interactive show.

34:31.380 --> 34:36.340
And just because we've been doing it for coming up on 13 years this June, doesn't mean

34:36.340 --> 34:40.700
we can't change things once in a while when the listeners, uh, give good ideas and suggestions

34:40.700 --> 34:41.700
and feedback.

34:41.700 --> 34:45.520
So we'll talk about that at the beginning of part B. Uh, meanwhile, let's get into some

34:45.520 --> 34:47.660
gaming news, lots of other stuff going on in the world.

34:47.660 --> 34:48.660
We're going to start off.

34:48.660 --> 34:50.900
I have a feeling we're going to get into it.

34:50.900 --> 34:51.900
Here we go.

34:51.900 --> 34:54.100
Loki started us off with some gaming news.

34:54.100 --> 35:03.440
So new to our, uh, Nintendo has graciously allowed people to use their content and collect

35:03.440 --> 35:05.940
ad revenue from it on YouTube.

35:05.940 --> 35:07.340
That's so awesome.

35:07.340 --> 35:14.260
So nice of them, except there's some little asterisks is that you need to be aware of.

35:14.260 --> 35:18.860
First off, uh, this would be through their brand new affiliate program, the Nintendo

35:18.860 --> 35:20.440
creators program.

35:20.440 --> 35:26.920
So when you sign up with them, um, you can basically register whole channels or certain

35:26.920 --> 35:27.920
videos.

35:27.920 --> 35:35.840
And basically if you do, um, just an individual video, you will be offered 60% of the ad revenue.

35:35.840 --> 35:42.880
Um, and if for a whole channel, 70% of the ad revenue and, um, they are basically paying

35:42.880 --> 35:44.440
you via PayPal.

35:44.440 --> 35:50.320
So they're collecting all the ad revenue and then paying you on the backend for that.

35:50.320 --> 35:55.680
And I guess, um, they'll allow you to use their videos and make money off them.

35:55.680 --> 35:58.000
I think it's crap.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
Why do you think it's the reason?

35:59.000 --> 36:02.080
I think it's crafts because she makes so little from ad revenues anyways.

36:02.080 --> 36:08.240
In fact, a good, good explanation for this was, um, total biscuit actually did a breakdown

36:08.240 --> 36:10.240
of this and why this was a bad thing.

36:10.240 --> 36:17.440
And basically breaking down that, say you make a hundred dollars on a video for ad revenue.

36:17.440 --> 36:23.800
And at the end, after you're done paying, you know, the fees for, um, YouTube, from

36:23.800 --> 36:28.920
PayPal, from, um, what Nintendo takes out for every hundred dollars that you're actually

36:28.920 --> 36:33.860
making in ad revenue, you're actually only collecting two or $22 of that.

36:33.860 --> 36:35.680
And so it's just, it's crap.

36:35.680 --> 36:39.520
Honestly, I think this type of thing is not a good thing considering that, you know, you

36:39.520 --> 36:43.760
had some companies like Microsoft that were kind of, you know what, we don't want you

36:43.760 --> 36:49.160
using our properties for, uh, making, you know, money off of them, basically use, make

36:49.160 --> 36:54.120
any sort of monetization, but then they went ahead and reversed their stance on that.

36:54.120 --> 36:57.920
And I think that that's kind of the way that the company should be, honestly, cool.

36:57.920 --> 37:00.760
If you want to participate in this, go right ahead.

37:00.760 --> 37:05.400
But like, if I had the time to make, you know, more videos and stuff that had to do with,

37:05.400 --> 37:08.880
you know, game play and stuff like that, I would not be choosing incentive products.

37:08.880 --> 37:14.640
There's plenty of, plenty, plenty of other games out there rather than Nintendo games

37:14.640 --> 37:15.720
that I could be playing.

37:15.720 --> 37:20.200
I've got a whole fucking Steam backlog that, you know, is a testament to that.

37:20.200 --> 37:28.020
I don't need to have the privilege of paying them money to show their game online.

37:28.020 --> 37:29.760
That's so fucking backwards.

37:29.760 --> 37:34.700
This is the kind of shit that gets you into the mess that you're in right now, where your

37:34.700 --> 37:37.280
first party games are the only thing supporting that damn system.

37:37.280 --> 37:41.120
So I don't know.

37:41.120 --> 37:44.280
I've had a lot of time to think about this topic and I'm about to say some things that

37:44.280 --> 37:49.820
might actually contradict things I've said 10, 15 episodes ago when, you know, this topic

37:49.820 --> 37:54.200
first came up and I, opinions sometimes change, they shift and so forth.

37:54.200 --> 37:57.160
But this is where my head is currently at with this stuff is that there are some things

37:57.160 --> 37:59.440
I agree with you on, Loki.

37:59.440 --> 38:02.960
Fundamentally though, I believe Nintendo deserves a cut.

38:02.960 --> 38:03.960
I do.

38:03.960 --> 38:07.560
I'm going to ask some people to hear that, but I fully believe that Nintendo deserves

38:07.560 --> 38:09.280
a cut of the money.

38:09.280 --> 38:12.800
And I think the best example I would have for this is something like Mystery Science

38:12.800 --> 38:19.160
Theater 3000, where if, you know, if they are going to be skewing a movie and interjecting

38:19.160 --> 38:23.980
their own dialogue and so forth, they still have to secure the rights for that movie and

38:23.980 --> 38:29.240
give a cut or pay a one time fee or something from the original movie maker, unless the

38:29.240 --> 38:33.440
movie's what, 75, 50 years old, and it's considered the public domain at that point, which I think

38:33.440 --> 38:35.620
has happened with some of the movies they've done in the past.

38:35.620 --> 38:36.800
But I digress.

38:36.800 --> 38:40.400
I know a lot of Let's Players say that, well, people don't watch it for the games, they

38:40.400 --> 38:43.280
watch it for the commentary or the opinions or things like that.

38:43.280 --> 38:48.240
Well, if that's the case, try putting your commentary or opinion out there without the

38:48.240 --> 38:49.980
game and see how well that does.

38:49.980 --> 38:54.360
I do think the games do play an integral part and these things would not exist without the

38:54.360 --> 38:55.360
game.

38:55.360 --> 39:00.720
That being said, I think the method this is all being done is a little screwy and I can

39:00.720 --> 39:01.720
agree with that.

39:01.720 --> 39:07.000
I totally get the concept where it's stupid that YouTube takes a cut and PayPal takes

39:07.000 --> 39:12.680
a cut and then, then, then, like that's all a little bit ridiculous and I get that.

39:12.680 --> 39:14.860
Everybody's taking a piece off the top.

39:14.860 --> 39:18.640
Here's where I think the problem ultimately lies and I think you've got the Let's Players

39:18.640 --> 39:23.000
pointing fingers at Nintendo, you've got Nintendo pointing fingers at the Let's Players.

39:23.000 --> 39:25.320
Do you know where the real fucking problem is?

39:25.320 --> 39:30.960
The problem is YouTube and I've been saying this forever.

39:30.960 --> 39:34.240
That's the one message that I think I have been consistent on from the very beginning.

39:34.240 --> 39:42.040
The problem is YouTube but they are such a behemoth that nobody is making them do anything

39:42.040 --> 39:44.280
about it and that's what blows my mind.

39:44.280 --> 39:49.760
In my opinion, YouTube should have an established standard for this shit and be done with it

39:49.760 --> 39:50.760
already.

39:50.760 --> 39:57.040
But YouTube also needs to have some type of appeal system for their users as well as the

39:57.040 --> 40:02.040
companies that want to contest things that are being used outside of copyright law that

40:02.040 --> 40:04.120
are on the service and so forth.

40:04.120 --> 40:07.200
YouTube is a giant fucking brainless robot.

40:07.200 --> 40:11.640
Not only that but they're going to continue content ID matching stuff and you basically

40:11.640 --> 40:17.040
have to get approval before you're able to make money off those videos.

40:17.040 --> 40:22.760
Say for example you do a review series and you're reviewing a Nintendo game or something

40:22.760 --> 40:27.440
like that then they could just say oh we're not going to approve your video.

40:27.440 --> 40:33.280
Say you're critical on a certain Nintendo game, theoretically they could just say no

40:33.280 --> 40:35.440
we're not going to approve your video.

40:35.440 --> 40:42.880
I understand that's a little extreme but as I'll talk about later on in the show, it may

40:42.880 --> 40:49.240
not be that out of the norm considering how people are manipulating the system to get

40:49.240 --> 40:51.140
what they want.

40:51.140 --> 40:55.620
There is a certain amount of fair use that needs to be allotted so that you can have

40:55.620 --> 40:58.700
these reviews and you can have these critical opinions and so forth.

40:58.700 --> 41:04.780
But when people have like 90 minute long let's plays where it's just we're making jokes along

41:04.780 --> 41:08.380
with this game that we're playing along in the background, I'm not so sure that meets

41:08.380 --> 41:10.420
the guidelines of fair use.

41:10.420 --> 41:16.740
But YouTube needs to come out and say it is X, the line is drawn here so that way at least

41:16.740 --> 41:17.900
everybody's playing by the same rules.

41:17.900 --> 41:21.580
I understand let's plays but let's say for example you're doing a news show or something

41:21.580 --> 41:27.420
like that on YouTube and you're talking about the news and a Nintendo story comes up like

41:27.420 --> 41:31.140
oh Nintendo announced that such and such games coming out and you're talking about that and

41:31.140 --> 41:37.860
you have part of the trailer playing in the background and they monetize that video.

41:37.860 --> 41:41.220
In my opinion that's a YouTube problem.

41:41.220 --> 41:45.380
That is fair use and YouTube should not be allowing that to be contested because a robot

41:45.380 --> 41:46.780
fucking match that.

41:46.780 --> 41:47.780
That's the problem.

41:47.780 --> 41:52.020
And I've told yeah that's fair use if you're doing a news thing and you show an incidental

41:52.020 --> 41:54.860
Nintendo thing absolutely that should be the news thing.

41:54.860 --> 41:59.380
But here's the other side of that is that I also think there should be and this this

41:59.380 --> 42:02.780
should be something that maybe Nintendo should kind of step up.

42:02.780 --> 42:08.740
There should be kind of like a certain threshold like if you're making less than a hundred

42:08.740 --> 42:14.180
dollars a year on YouTube videos which is where a lot of people are at a lot a lot of

42:14.180 --> 42:17.220
people are at that line if you're making like less than a hundred dollars a year on

42:17.220 --> 42:20.580
YouTube videos I kind of don't think this should apply to you.

42:20.580 --> 42:26.180
And I think I mean I'm you know I understand the need for consistency and so forth but

42:26.180 --> 42:30.100
if Nintendo wants to be good guy Nintendo then draw a line.

42:30.100 --> 42:34.900
But I'm sorry I do have a lot of problems feeling sympathy for these people that like

42:34.900 --> 42:37.140
you make millions of dollars.

42:37.140 --> 42:43.580
You know somebody like PewDiePie makes millions of dollars off these let's plays and so forth

42:43.580 --> 42:48.020
and you know they're complaining about oh we know we're going to get you know some of

42:48.020 --> 42:51.300
this money to and it's all this whole ass line system whatever Nintendo wants to cut

42:51.300 --> 42:55.760
the money but but but but I'm sorry I have a little problem feeling that much sympathy

42:55.760 --> 43:01.260
for you when then XYZ gaming company just had to lay off 200 people this week and we're

43:01.260 --> 43:04.300
going to hear an incident of that a little later on in the show.

43:04.300 --> 43:08.620
Here's the reason why they have that kind of attitude is because they're fucking having

43:08.620 --> 43:14.340
PewDiePie fucking quoted like a box quoted on a fucking advertisement in stores like

43:14.340 --> 43:18.060
they showed that for I don't remember what fucking game it was but they had a PewDiePie

43:18.060 --> 43:19.060
quote on it.

43:19.060 --> 43:21.420
I think it was for Dying Light.

43:21.420 --> 43:25.680
That's why that's why he's got a big head about this shit is because he's fucking getting

43:25.680 --> 43:30.400
quoted as part of marketing for these games.

43:30.400 --> 43:34.220
So yeah I mean he's a major channel and the fact that he's saying that I'm not going to

43:34.220 --> 43:39.380
cover Nintendo products you know unless I feel like playing one of their games then

43:39.380 --> 43:44.340
that's fine he has the right to do that but at the same time that's also kind of his thought

43:44.340 --> 43:48.940
is that and I don't want to defend him because honestly personally I don't like the guy but

43:48.940 --> 43:55.900
I find I find him I've seen 60 seconds of a video of his one time and that's it but

43:55.900 --> 44:01.300
I'm not naive enough not to think he's not no I understand it could be a personality

44:01.300 --> 44:05.860
plays on YouTube whatever I don't that's fine I just don't like his videos but I don't

44:05.860 --> 44:12.780
I'm not faulting him for it per se but I'm just saying that you know it's up to his thought

44:12.780 --> 44:19.660
is that he's helping market these games and that they should be thankful that he is you

44:19.660 --> 44:25.300
know playing their products because he's in the past driven like for example they you

44:25.300 --> 44:29.500
know in his Tumblr he cited you know like skate three he showed them playing skate three

44:29.500 --> 44:32.100
all of a sudden that game shot back up through the charts even though it had been out for

44:32.100 --> 44:37.980
a while that type of thing so he's got a sort of a point but at the same time I mean you

44:37.980 --> 44:41.440
shouldn't feel entitled by that but I just think they're going about it the wrong way

44:41.440 --> 44:48.300
I think you want people to be making like fan videos for it and so what if they're making

44:48.300 --> 44:52.920
some money off of ad revenue I mean are you really that hard up for money that you need

44:52.920 --> 44:58.340
to be making pennies off of these videos I mean it's not pennies though Loki I mean some

44:58.340 --> 45:03.220
people it's not pennies but it's ad revenue though it's not if they want to put out creative

45:03.220 --> 45:07.940
videos and charge ad revenue for it then by all means Nintendo you make some new original

45:07.940 --> 45:12.940
content out there like let's plays hell just hire some of your treehouse people or something

45:12.940 --> 45:16.420
to do some like interesting videos and start monetizing that shit if that's what you want

45:16.420 --> 45:21.620
to collect money on but I feel I would actually agree that Nintendo can make a lot of money

45:21.620 --> 45:27.620
doing in-house productions of this stuff I but but I also think you know it's not you

45:27.620 --> 45:31.660
know that's why I talk about the threshold when we are talking about pennies then maybe

45:31.660 --> 45:34.820
Nintendo should just write it off good guy Nintendo right but what we're talking about

45:34.820 --> 45:37.740
hundreds of thousands of dollars which is what we're talking about with people like

45:37.740 --> 45:42.460
PewDiePie I think it's totally okay that's that's ten people's jobs for the year out

45:42.460 --> 45:46.500
of their pockets it's making no money on their pockets it's just like oh we feel we should

45:46.500 --> 45:50.560
be getting paid some more money that's all it really is I think of anything you should

45:50.560 --> 45:56.780
be putting as as few barriers between you and the people that want to you know expose

45:56.780 --> 46:00.700
your game to others or like play up the game I mean if you're just putting that barrier

46:00.700 --> 46:04.420
out there and saying okay well you could do this but you're gonna have to jump through

46:04.420 --> 46:08.820
all these hoops in order to be getting paid you know for monetizing these videos fuck

46:08.820 --> 46:14.820
it just I wouldn't do it I would just play something else I understand the concept of

46:14.820 --> 46:18.520
it doesn't hurt them and so forth and the free advertising and so forth but you have

46:18.520 --> 46:23.140
to understand there's another layer this is something that somebody said to me this week

46:23.140 --> 46:27.160
about a particular game as I was telling this individual you should check out this

46:27.160 --> 46:31.260
game you know I know it gets a lot of mixed reviews and some people say good things about

46:31.260 --> 46:34.540
it some people say not so good things about it but I kind of think this game is up your

46:34.540 --> 46:38.380
alley you should check it out and the person said to me isn't that one of those games it's

46:38.380 --> 46:41.760
about three hours to beat and I said yeah it's only about three hours to beat and they

46:41.760 --> 46:45.460
said you know I'll just look up a let's play of it on YouTube and I'll just watch it on

46:45.460 --> 46:50.620
YouTube that way I don't have to spend the money and buy it that was something that was

46:50.620 --> 46:55.340
said to me I am not making it up that it I mean I might be summarizing some quotes

46:55.340 --> 46:58.660
and things but essentially that is the gist of the conversation then that's a problem

46:58.660 --> 47:03.300
that that happens that's a problem then with the game designer if that your game is basically

47:03.300 --> 47:07.580
good for one playthrough and that's it and there is no replayability to it then yes I

47:07.580 --> 47:11.980
don't think you should spend the money on that if for example a perfect example of that

47:11.980 --> 47:17.960
is that fucking Melger solid you know ground zeros bullshit that they put out they charge

47:17.960 --> 47:22.320
you know like 30 bucks for and it's like a four hour game there's not much replayability

47:22.320 --> 47:27.080
there so I'm not gonna spend my money on it so I see that exactly if like let's say for

47:27.080 --> 47:30.640
example Call of Duty campaign if you're looking at like the single-player version of Call

47:30.640 --> 47:35.040
Duty and you just want to know what the story is and say fuck it I wouldn't purchase the

47:35.040 --> 47:38.520
game if it you're only gonna get one playthrough out of it what if I told you this game it

47:38.520 --> 47:43.800
was a $10 indie game same problem though if it's three hours long and you're paying $10

47:43.800 --> 47:47.720
so it costs 15 to go see a movie can I take a three hour movie and just put it on YouTube

47:48.600 --> 47:54.080
no you cannot but there's some interactive problem there well then I'm sure that they're

47:54.080 --> 47:59.080
gonna they can just monetize or do a copyright claim on if that's the problem they have such

47:59.080 --> 48:03.200
a problem with people putting the if their three hour game on YouTube then do a copyright

48:03.200 --> 48:07.960
claim against it since they can do that for the movie that I mean I'm assuming if that's

48:07.960 --> 48:12.040
the problem they don't want the exposure of their short game on YouTube then they have

48:12.040 --> 48:16.040
the rights to make a claim against it all right let me read some comments from chat

48:16.040 --> 48:19.960
I don't mean to ignore folks in chat and Jamie I have no idea if you even have a thought

48:19.960 --> 48:25.120
on this or if you're just kind of like there's there's no answer to this problem I don't

48:25.120 --> 48:32.400
know Jamie I'm always like I like free money I like playing Nintendo I'm telling you personally

48:32.400 --> 48:37.800
if I have you know whenever I finish a game someday I don't fucking care there's more

48:37.800 --> 48:41.280
exposure it gets better for me you making money up if you're making hundreds of thousand

48:41.280 --> 48:46.320
dollars of it yeah I'm a little jealous but good for you I mean who cares I think that

48:46.320 --> 48:52.400
indie developers should have their own licensed let's play channels I I just I honestly think

48:52.400 --> 48:58.080
if like twitch I almost said Justin TV if twitch TV could come out and just be like

48:58.080 --> 49:03.940
we have signed agreements with Nintendo Sony and Microsoft on the rules for let's plays

49:03.940 --> 49:08.120
and we're gonna introduce twitch on demand and you can record these let's plays and we'll

49:08.120 --> 49:12.040
interject ads into it and you're gonna get 75% and they get 25% I don't know I'm making

49:12.040 --> 49:16.840
these numbers up if they were to roll that out like this week and we have signed agreements

49:16.840 --> 49:23.160
with these big three huge industry standard players and we have these signed agreements

49:23.160 --> 49:26.840
this is how it's gonna be that would stab YouTube in the fucking heart it would and

49:26.840 --> 49:33.000
now now it's game fucking on once again it's is the fewer barriers you have between your

49:33.000 --> 49:39.640
consumer and you know their money basically you know making money off these videos the better it

49:39.640 --> 49:43.640
will be if it's easier for me to make money off of twitch than it is YouTube then of course I'm

49:43.640 --> 49:47.560
gonna go to twitch all right I got to do some chat room comments because it is a show where every

49:47.560 --> 49:52.680
gamer has a voice sadly I can't read everything but let me get to some comments here um sg100

49:52.680 --> 49:57.400
matt saying it's not about the amount of money it's about drawing a line and people profiting

49:57.400 --> 50:01.640
off your products if they don't draw it now then there will be a point that someone will make

50:01.640 --> 50:07.640
millions and millions off their game and the creators not seeing any of that uh pow in our

50:07.640 --> 50:12.760
chat room at live.vog network.com says also it's a cultural thing I like this because it makes you

50:12.760 --> 50:18.600
consider something different it's a cultural thing Japanese corporations are fighting a lot to stop

50:18.600 --> 50:24.760
the quote let's watch the ending on YouTube thing uh now that pow says that it actually makes me

50:24.760 --> 50:30.760
think Sony does this too you just don't hear about it as much but uh developers can block sections of

50:30.760 --> 50:35.400
games from being recorded remember that uh when they they do the recording on ps4 sections of

50:35.400 --> 50:39.880
games can be blocked so that way the endings of games can't be posted as easily you just like

50:39.880 --> 50:43.640
telling me to a movie who gives a shit I'm sorry I don't buy that as an excuse

50:45.400 --> 50:51.720
uh I kind of agree to a point that you can't stop it but they can make it harder uh let's see

50:51.720 --> 50:57.240
dungeon buster says YouTube dug themselves into this hole in flying by the seat of their copyright

50:57.320 --> 51:03.800
pants for so long uh let's see Kaijuto in chat says I disagree video games are not movies it's

51:03.800 --> 51:09.960
different uh tiger claw says this is affecting giant bomb as well you'll have to watch videos

51:09.960 --> 51:14.360
of their Nintendo coverage on their site well what's interesting about that solution is it's

51:14.360 --> 51:20.440
removing YouTube which I have said is the problem it's removing YouTube from the equation which

51:20.440 --> 51:25.400
considering that most of the stuff I think giant bomb bomb does is and I don't visit that site

51:25.400 --> 51:29.160
every day so you'll have to correct me if I'm wrong most of the cases where they're using this

51:29.160 --> 51:33.640
are going to be the review and news type I don't they don't do a lot of extended let's plays right

51:34.360 --> 51:39.000
I don't think so they might but if they do and I'm just not aware of it keep in mind

51:39.000 --> 51:44.040
Nintendo would have every right to step in and say you need to remove it or we're not

51:44.040 --> 51:48.040
going to give you these games if you don't I mean they would have the right to play hardball

51:48.040 --> 51:53.240
I mean I realize that could have ramifications but that could be an alley we go down if that happens

51:53.880 --> 51:59.160
Marissa Congusto in chat at live.vognetware.com says still have to pay when you sample a song

51:59.160 --> 52:03.080
I don't think it should matter if the profit is negligible but after that I see the point

52:03.720 --> 52:10.280
so uh and powen chat says people go to jail in Japan for posting a single anime episode

52:10.280 --> 52:15.320
it's not different with games it is different because there's an interactive element to games

52:15.320 --> 52:21.080
where it's an anime episode there is not if you post a video of a game online it's not the same

52:21.080 --> 52:25.160
as playing a game whereas if you post a movie online it's the same as watching the movie because

52:25.160 --> 52:29.640
you're watching on the internet versus watching in a theater I'm with you to a point I mean

52:29.640 --> 52:35.160
obviously I don't think anybody should go to jail over a let's play but uh I I think the let's play

52:35.160 --> 52:39.480
simply would not exist without the game makers that's that they had a hand in creating the

52:39.480 --> 52:46.280
content too it's a shared thing and if somebody were to step in and say rob those let's plays

52:46.280 --> 52:50.680
that you've done of the classic games from 25 years ago comp the commodore company or whoever

52:50.680 --> 52:56.040
wants a cut I'd be like all right they're gonna get five cents I sure know Nintendo's in a good

52:56.040 --> 53:02.040
spot right now because their games are quality and they make some really awesome games but they're

53:02.040 --> 53:05.720
not the only ones that make really awesome games out there and I gotta be honest this whole indie

53:05.720 --> 53:10.840
resurgence thing there's a lot of great good indie games and you know what those indie guys don't

53:10.840 --> 53:15.880
give a fuck about you monetizing their videos and so what's gonna come down to eventually is that

53:16.440 --> 53:20.440
those people are just gonna be like oh hey you're gonna put barriers in front of me to play

53:20.440 --> 53:25.320
these games well I'm just gonna play these games right here instead is what's gonna come down to

53:26.200 --> 53:31.320
and they'll it'll be great for the indie guys to to be fair though just you know not all indie

53:31.320 --> 53:36.040
guys I seem to recall Phil Fish which I realize is a controversial figure but he's made his

53:36.040 --> 53:43.720
opinion very clear that he is in the minority thankfully and well he's got his own set of

53:43.720 --> 53:50.200
issues but that's neither here nor there so but for the majority I think that people are pretty

53:50.760 --> 53:56.040
open to the idea of you playing stuff and remember there's a whole you know let's play list of like

53:56.040 --> 54:00.520
all the publishers and stuff that are okay with you doing that so I think that's a I think I think

54:00.520 --> 54:05.560
it's a bummer there's not a standard I kind of I feel like there should just be a freaking standard

54:05.560 --> 54:10.200
already but I as somebody who has done let's plays and puts things on YouTube and decides am

54:10.200 --> 54:14.760
I going to monetize this or not I love that as a resource I do love that as a resource and when

54:14.760 --> 54:20.520
I do a Nintendo game I just don't monetize it but I'm also like I'm not in a position I have

54:20.520 --> 54:25.960
yet to see a check from YouTube and I've got a long way to go like I just don't have that type

54:25.960 --> 54:31.160
of volume so it's not really something I think about but I kind of I like to think that if I

54:31.160 --> 54:35.000
were in a position where I'm making a thousand dollars a month even off YouTube videos then I'd

54:35.000 --> 54:40.360
be like all right well if you know the companies want their 25 30 percent per video even 50 percent

54:40.360 --> 54:44.760
really per video then I guess they could be entitled to that but I don't think they should

54:44.760 --> 54:50.920
be entitled to a hundred percent because I do think the creator of the let's play does share

54:50.920 --> 54:56.680
in that with the people that made the game so the answer is somewhere in the 50 50 range somewhere

54:56.680 --> 55:01.880
in there anyway um that's our thoughts on this we could go on for three hours and fill on this topic

55:01.880 --> 55:06.520
alone I'm sure you guys have some strong opinions about this we welcome emails participate at orange

55:06.520 --> 55:10.600
law on trading.com is the place to send emails we'll probably be continuing the discussion on

55:10.600 --> 55:15.880
this on our forums a little bit this week as well which you can access at forums.vognetwork.com but

55:15.880 --> 55:19.640
for now lots of other stuff going on in the news so we're going to get to some other news which

55:19.640 --> 55:25.000
includes speaking of Nintendo there were some updates to Super Smash Brothers this week and

55:25.000 --> 55:29.960
this is pretty cool because this is a pretty big update for a company that hasn't done a lot of

55:29.960 --> 55:34.440
content patches for their games really we've they've been behind a little bit in that so this

55:34.440 --> 55:40.760
is really cool to hear that Super Smash Brothers got 15 new eight player stages in a free update

55:40.760 --> 55:46.440
so 15 modified eight player stages were added to Super Smash Brothers Wii U this week and you just

55:46.440 --> 55:51.320
get it in a patch that you download and you're going to get new stages like Pokemon Stadium 2,

55:52.040 --> 55:59.080
Wii Fit Studio, Luigi's Mansion, all these new levels for eight people to brawl in so that's

55:59.080 --> 56:03.720
pretty cool I guess eight player mode must be doing very well for them to add all these stages

56:03.720 --> 56:08.760
I bet it uh I bet this thing is a riot at conventions and anime conventions and gaming

56:08.760 --> 56:13.080
conventions or my house or your house see I haven't I haven't had enough people over here

56:13.080 --> 56:17.560
to play eight player Smash I mean we'll do computer characters but I bet if you actually have

56:17.560 --> 56:23.480
eight people there playing I bet it's a riot it's chaos is it really it's great oh man you have to

56:23.480 --> 56:26.840
have a huge tv to be able to see that though well this is in my living room yeah you guys have a

56:26.840 --> 56:31.160
pretty decent sized tv I think we have the one here is too small 50 something inch yeah see that

56:31.160 --> 56:35.960
that probably Dan wants us to get a 72 inch that would be perfect for Smash you need to be like

56:35.960 --> 56:41.000
those uh people I was seeing online that was projecting the the football thingamabob today

56:41.000 --> 56:46.200
on like a huge screen in their backyard that's what you need for Smash Brothers dear lord

56:49.080 --> 56:53.320
you know what the whole neighborhood to be able to see I want Meta Knight to be the size of my head

56:55.000 --> 56:59.400
all right well anyhow um some other interesting little kind of you know this could have been a

56:59.400 --> 57:05.080
thing in Super Smash Brothers uh I guess through some discovery I don't know what this was like

57:05.080 --> 57:09.480
if they had actually gone through files what was it disc files they were poking through files on

57:09.480 --> 57:13.960
the disc well apparently uh Rhythm Heaven was going to have a character in the game

57:13.960 --> 57:19.480
which actually makes a lot of sense now that we think about it uh also a stage based on Dr Mario

57:19.480 --> 57:25.720
was going to be included which again makes a lot of sense now I would think that DLC would be a

57:25.720 --> 57:30.200
great way to especially there's a new Rhythm Heaven game coming out for Wii U at some point

57:30.200 --> 57:36.040
wouldn't that be a great tie-in to then have the character in Smash Brothers as DLC of course you

57:36.040 --> 57:42.840
know I know Sakurai has said there's no plans for DLC but come on you want to talk about ways

57:42.840 --> 57:48.040
Nintendo can make more money here's one of them there's no plans for DLC well there I know he

57:48.040 --> 57:53.080
has said there's they already have a DLC character beyond Mewtwo beyond Mewtwo so that's like the one

57:53.080 --> 57:59.880
but I just I can't see how it could just be one I don't get it so anyhow it could have been it

57:59.880 --> 58:08.200
could have been a thing uh Darsaka well you know what's this the saying hackers gonna hack indeed

58:09.000 --> 58:15.560
well they have found an exploit in the new 3DS that lets you run Game Boy Color ROMs

58:16.600 --> 58:22.280
yep it was only a matter of time basically um it's something that you can do to side load Game Boy

58:22.280 --> 58:33.720
Color ROMs it's a trick put out by a YouTube user named Kazowar who basically used emulation

58:33.720 --> 58:41.160
meant for virtual console games to load the ROMs instead so his guide says that it relies on a

58:41.160 --> 58:47.480
buffer overflow error that's currently in the web browser so if you load it with specific timing

58:47.480 --> 58:54.840
you can get the uh you can replace a Game Boy Color game with a ROM on an SD card or something

58:54.840 --> 59:02.200
stored online so of course uh it's actually it works with the last release 9.4 but um we're

59:02.840 --> 59:07.640
probably gonna see it patched out before too long so yeah I'm sure Nintendo will be patching that

59:07.640 --> 59:13.240
right up but like laugh it up kids in the meantime uh Pokemon Yellow for all hooray

59:13.480 --> 59:20.680
hmm yeah or uh some of the classics yeah yeah well you know I think Pokemon's like the one game

59:20.680 --> 59:24.520
people really want to see on virtual console that just isn't coming to virtual console

59:24.520 --> 59:28.120
why put it on virtual console when you can remake it and I don't know I don't actually don't know

59:28.120 --> 59:32.040
why those games don't really show up on virtual console I think you just nailed it uh Pokemon

59:32.040 --> 59:36.760
Pinball did on Wii U because I picked that one up but uh yeah the Pokemon games themselves don't

59:36.760 --> 59:39.720
really end up on virtual console you need something that's gonna use what the little

59:39.720 --> 59:45.320
accelerometer thing in the yeah so uh well I think you know you said it hackers gonna hack

59:45.320 --> 59:50.440
and uh if there's a way for people to play free games you know on their device that's what they're

59:50.440 --> 59:55.400
gonna do you know just throwing it out there though not that I'm excusing it because you know

59:55.400 --> 01:00:01.720
the piracy you know that's not supposed to supposed to happen that's very bad but you know

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:07.320
Nintendo could combat that a little bit if virtual console were a little more lucrative than just

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:12.360
straight up emulation you know what I mean like being able to play it online with my friends

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:17.880
which granted could still be considered emulation but hear me out here if there was a little more

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:23.960
to to to enrich the pot of virtual console it would make those options look a lot more attractive

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:29.640
and piracy look like the gutter option yeah it would look like oh this is this is the low class

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:33.960
option whereas if I pay the premium I'm going to get all these other cool features like

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:41.080
maybe multiple save states or uh maybe high definition textures or you know remastered

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:46.920
sound or I don't know there's a lot of things that they could do 3D effects which very very few um

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:52.200
uh the 3DS virtual console things have and they're usually considered separate releases and not a part

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:56.440
of the virtual console family but I've been saying that forever that virtual console could really

01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:00.680
stand to sweeten the pot oh achievements would be another I know Nintendo doesn't have a centralized

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:06.520
achievement system but they could easily create one they could get on that I'm sure they will with

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:12.440
the next two or three consoles from now that they create just put it in the freaking Mario universe

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:19.080
call it coins you unlocked a coin and you know have the coins be have the coins be usable to like

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:24.280
buy backgrounds on the Wii U or 3DS or something even though I guess people are willing to pay real

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:30.120
money for the background so they don't need fake coins I just I don't know anyway there's an award

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:36.440
yeah award a certificate I don't know anything this is my just my silly thought how to make

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:41.320
virtual console a lot more lucrative and convince people to buy games all over again but maybe you're

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:45.480
right they're saving that for the Wii U 2 or whatever the next console is because that's how

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:51.160
they'll get you to pay five dollars for Super Mario Brothers again because this time it has

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:56.680
achievements or multiplayer or something or they just want anything they'll just put they'll still

01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:01.560
charge you five dollars for Super Mario see who buys it again yeah maybe or you know you just

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:08.600
buy an original Nintendo and 50 50 cent Mario Brothers dot-com cart you're right you could

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:12.920
you could except the old Nintendos are getting harder and harder to play on the newer TVs

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:17.000
because you don't really have the um okay or you can buy one of those retron systems then

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:22.040
okay there you go there you go all right anyhow moving on with more news Loki all right so if you

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:32.440
want to take part of the Sony online breach class action lawsuit rewards then now's your time

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:42.920
to go ahead and sign up for that so if you head on over to PSNSOESettlement.com you can actually

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:51.240
sign up and register to receive such rewards as three months free of PlayStation Plus or some

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:56.760
games that they already offered up to people that are affected by the breach the first time

01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:03.640
or some shitty dynamic themes for your PlayStation 3 which really why would you pick that that's

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:08.680
literally the worst option that you can pick on all of those to qualify you must have had a

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:14.520
PlayStation Network curiosity or Sony entered online entertainment account on or before May

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:23.320
14th 2011 and uh you can receive I guess one or two one or two games um the three months

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:28.920
or those stupid themes I don't know why you'd pick those things I'm not even considering that

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:34.440
an option but uh yeah I went ahead and did that even though I got my free games yeah I was to say

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:39.880
I guess I could do this because hey free game but I do kind of feel like well you know Sony

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:44.040
kind of already gave free games whatever they're offering up free PlayStation Plus so I'm gonna

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:49.480
take it yeah and you know have you never had PlayStation Plus ever let me tell my PlayStation

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:53.560
Plus now but it's gonna extend it three more months oh well shit and that's maybe what I'm

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:57.640
gonna grab out of that yeah exactly so I mean yeah I thought originally that was only supposed

01:03:57.640 --> 01:04:02.840
to be for people who never had PlayStation Plus before no get that oh it's for anybody but there's

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:06.440
a lot of people ask and you know getting that minute drops it down the one month but that's

01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:10.360
still an extra month that's still an extra month so you know I'll do that because all the games

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:16.360
that they were offering up or literally the same games that they had um before as part well no it

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:22.200
wasn't exactly the same they had like uh puppeteers on there now so they had some decent games but

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:28.600
it's just a lot of them already had um I just didn't want them so and the themes like I said

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:33.080
themes are not even really an option for me at all yeah why would I do that uh running a little

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:36.920
behind on our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com but I wanted to read a comment there's there's

01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:40.760
still a lot of people talking about the copyright dispute and I totally understand that but trying

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:45.080
to pick out some of the comments of the stories we just read uh Dartetsuya says to be fair I'm

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:49.400
sure they'll still offer a discount for owners of the previous versions of the ROM he's talking

01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:53.560
about the virtual console thing about how Wii U 2 or you know whatever it's gonna be obviously well

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:57.560
that's assuming that their their online services can talk to each other because they still haven't

01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:02.920
quite figured that out too well to be fair you can get if you bought it on the Wii and then you

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:06.920
have the Wii U you can get the game for like a dollar and it is it is a better experience on

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:11.640
Wii U than it was the Wii but you know it's it's worth about that dollar you know what I mean so

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:19.560
I hate to be fair that is stupid I'm sorry when and we're we're living in a day and age where

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:25.320
you know Call of Duty Advanced Warfare you can buy it on PlayStation 4 and get it on PlayStation

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:32.840
3 for you know 3 for free or vice versa but yet Nintendo can't fucking offer me a free copy of

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:41.000
goddamn ROM that they've made tons and tons of money off of already I mean that see this is

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.240
exactly the type of company that we're dealing with here that feels that they are owed money

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:49.240
for every fucking step of the way so you actually reminded me of a game I totally played for a

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:52.200
little bit this week that I forgot to talk about during my gaming week so I guess I'll bring it up

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:56.520
now because talking about ROMs and things I played Metroid Prime Trilogy because that came out on Wii

01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:00.600
U it was only 10 bucks right I played a little bit of it I mean I didn't play enough of it obviously

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:04.680
I didn't even think about it during my gaming week but I played a little bit of that and I gotta say

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:09.320
that was kind of nice to be able to buy that for ten dollars on Wii U because there was no fucking

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:13.720
way I was gonna pay like fifty dollars for it at GameStop or whatever it was or they were way

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:18.200
overcharging for it because there was a lot of copies of it that's awesome yeah that they're

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:22.360
you know that they charge the extra money for you wonder why they set that precedence because

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:26.360
Nintendo makes fucking exclusive deals with them all the goddamn time once again and you know I

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:30.680
don't like that and I don't like that so I was very happy when Nintendo was like we're gonna

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:34.840
offer it for ten dollars digitally I was like all right cool now I can finally pick this up because

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:40.120
I had Prime 3 and I think I had Prime 1 on the GameCube but I don't even really have a way to

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:46.040
play GameCube games anymore my Wii's not even hooked up so I never bought Prime 2 so I was like

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:49.720
all right I'll spend ten dollars on the collection the only thing that kind of bummed me out and I

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:57.000
forgot that they changed this in Prime trilogy is that you only have Wii motion controls in Prime 1

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.520
and 2 well Prime Metroid Prime was for the GameCube and used a GameCube controller so I

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:06.840
thought oh I'll be able to use my classic controller that nope I got to use the Wiimote

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:11.960
and the nunchuck that's not a problem with the Wii I mean that was the way they did it on trilogy

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:17.880
for the Wii I just forgot about that yeah oh but god damn we spend any ounce of effort to like I

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:23.560
don't know make it better you know fuck us you know for you know expecting them to do something

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:28.840
I would have appreciated the ability to use classic no no effort and all the fucking reward

01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:36.120
that is why they're fucking charging for fucking advertisement yeah all right anyhow moving on

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:44.920
you know who is paying who valve yes valve is paying valve has actually paid out a lot of money

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:52.360
they've paid over 57 million dollars out to content creators folks who have created items

01:07:52.360 --> 01:08:01.400
for team fortress 2 dota 2 counter strike global offense and this is also spread out amongst 75

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:07.240
different countries so basically all of these people who have been throwing stuff you know out

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:13.640
there for valves products have been reaping the benefit I mean they are clearly appreciative

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:21.400
in fact they've even uh you know said uh one of their developers uh uh Alden Kroll said uh today

01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:25.640
we're happy to announce that after a ton of work the first curated workshops for non-valve games

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:31.400
have opened so they've expanded it dungeon defenders eternity and chivalry medieval war

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:39.560
so there's more and more coming out so they're like hey thanks you're keeping our stuff alive

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:44.280
here's some money I wasn't even thinking of valve when we were talking about all these other

01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:49.720
stories you know um probably it has to do with consoles versus pc and for obvious reasons I

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:55.400
associate valve a little more with pc ends of things and mac computers in general right so

01:08:55.400 --> 01:09:00.040
I kind of associate valve with that but it is interesting that valve is not only a game maker

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:05.240
but they have this service and now they have this whole game streaming thing within it where you can

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:09.640
stream the games to your friends and so forth I mean they've essentially built that for their own

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:14.040
games now granted there's no revenue sharing in that there's none of that comes into play but just

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:18.680
kind of kind of interesting to see how things are are from that angle and then what you just

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:22.840
mentioned right there with all these community market things that are selling for uh quite a bit

01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:30.040
of money there and I bet valve gets quite a nice cut of that as well well uh speaking of steam now

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:34.520
you can't make any community market items for this game I don't think anyway yet I don't even know if

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:40.040
there's trading cards but you can get the definitive version of Quantic Dream's indigo

01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:48.280
prophecy it is now available on steam as well as ios pc mac linux all those different platforms

01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:55.400
it is available for nine dollars and 99 cents uh you can pick that up uh if you don't know uh

01:09:55.400 --> 01:10:01.160
the game indigo prophecy uh it is by the folks who made heavy rain if I'm not mistaken Quantic

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:07.800
Dream right so you can check out this early uh early game of theirs um this version now the

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:14.200
original game was capped at a resolution of 1024 by 768 but this new version will allow resolutions

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:22.680
up to 2880 by 1800 and they say they gave every game texture in the game a facelift so some have

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:28.680
four times the detail that they used to have but for ios there is a two gigabyte size limit

01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:32.760
so some of the textures are only double what they used to be so I mean but if you're going to be

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:37.160
playing the game on something a little more portable than something on your desktop I would

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:41.720
think that uh that would be a given there that it's not going to be quite quite the same so

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:48.760
uh that's pretty cool uh and in the faqs they say no cut or censored content in this version

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:54.920
so if you're worried if anything got cut along the way don't worry you don't have to do you ever

01:10:54.920 --> 01:11:00.920
play indigo prophecy you guys anybody in this room no it may be my steam library I honestly

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:04.520
don't know do you think you picked it up and you just haven't I may have picked it up at one time

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:12.680
I wouldn't know though all right so there you go uh awesome well let's travel around the world and

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:18.840
check out some release dates we're gonna go uh see what's coming out to a store near you yeah

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:24.440
that much this week is pretty actually oh it's pretty dead um we've got a couple games first one

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:33.720
being motorcycle club which is on playstation 3 and playstation 4 and then criminal girls invite

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:41.240

then spongebob hero pants on playstation vita xbox 360 and 3ds thank you activision um that's it

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:59.720
all right well I usually would do the japanese release dates right now but the website I use

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:04.120
for those is down so I'm going to try to find an alternate resource here real quick uh dark soccer

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:09.800
would you mind uh doing things out of order here live radio it's a blast there's only one it's on

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:16.440
the february 4th grow home will be out on pc which um I don't even know what that's about

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:24.040
I'm gonna look at it maybe you like have a one of those uh hydroponic gardens that uh

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:30.920
oh it's by ubisoft it's an experimental pc platformer called grow home with a little

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:42.200
robot and it looks like he's stuck hanging out in um nights into dreams yeah all right well uh

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:45.800
I guess I'm not gonna be able to do japanese releases this week so sorry japan nothing is

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:50.920
coming out in your region absolutely nothing I'm just kidding uh let's move on though uh we've

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:56.120
got a few more news stories for you guys than the classic game of the week first up loki all right

01:12:56.120 --> 01:13:02.440
so sony has pulled the support for a few of their non-game apps on the vita which is kind of sad

01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:10.600
um I remember also they've dropped was it um near but I guess the maps app and the youtube app will

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:17.800
be removed as well um I guess the maps app you know which I think used some of the features of

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:26.280
near um is not or it's expected to be removed as part of um I guess a march update and then the

01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:33.320
youtube app will be gone by april 20th so they're seeing though that you could still access youtube

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:39.640
through the web browser but it is kind of lame that they're removing that and honestly I don't

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:44.360
know why they would be doing that unless maybe they were doing an update to the whole I I'm some

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:49.400
part of me is like hoping that maybe they're doing just an update to the whole operating system on

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:55.000
the vita maybe that's going to be taking effect sometime soon and they're just removing this stuff

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.120
because it's going to be replaced by something better because I can't imagine that you know

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:06.680
having google maps on there is such a drain or of resources or something I don't really understand

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:14.920
why they would remove that but kind of disappointing um well the near I never understood

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:23.000
anyway so I I I haven't used that since the vita first came out near I think was more of like kind

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.960
of street passing but without going anywhere but it didn't make sense they never explained it very

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:33.400
well in the interface it was kind of silly um which I understand near isn't necessarily getting

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:38.200
shut down or whatever but without the maps functionality in the vita that may I think it's

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:42.840
probably a licensed thing wasn't uh wasn't vita licensing that from google wasn't sony licensing

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:47.640
the maps thing from google the license probably ran out and they decided so few people use it they

01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:52.760
didn't want to renew it that's my thought anyway oh it's probably what it is uh and then uh the

01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:57.480
youtube app probably because it works on the website and the vita you know level of people

01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:01.000
who use youtube on the vita is so small they probably just don't want to use the resources

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.320
updating the vita app anymore so they have no no more support for it because youtube does add new

01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:11.400
stuff like uh god what is it I saw now on the web is that it will auto play the next thing on the

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:16.040
playlist which I hate that shit when I go to youtube I want to watch one video if I want to

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:20.520
watch a playlist I'll let you know I'll make my own playlist but uh yeah I mean so the youtube

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:23.960
technologies are changing all the time so they probably just didn't want to build that into

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:30.280
uh the apps I'm actually glad they're going html5 oh did they yeah I thought they I thought they

01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:35.080
were already on that for a while well I mean one thing I don't know if you've noticed um flash has

01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:40.120
had like a bajillion updates lately it's so annoying and then now it's it freaking locks me

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:44.600
like it shuts flash down on every website unless I'm willing to update which is a real pain in the

01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:48.840
butt while I'm trying to do these shows no well the other thing too is that I think that that

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:53.960
might be part of the reason why they've gone to html5 yeah but that of course you know watching

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:59.960
youtube on ios devices without having uh their app would you know that would help right but I

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:05.000
mean the app's all right yeah but I just think it's needed the technology is finally you know

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:09.880
yeah make it becoming more accessible to other people I like to use the app to load something

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:13.240
up and then I push the button that plays it on my playstation 4 that's what I like just

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:16.360
just trying to find something with the controller is a pain in the ass we've got a chromecast for

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:22.680
that oh yeah I don't have a chromecast for that so 30 bucks all right I'm cheap I have a playstation

01:16:22.680 --> 01:16:29.000
4 that plays almost everything so I don't usually need one all right uh one more story for you guys

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:34.120
and this is about uh this is about a series that I love I love this and I'm not sure how I feel

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:40.360
about this news um one of my very very very favorite puzzle games ever is luminous and

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:45.720
luminous of course was a game that came out from q entertainment uh they also did another great

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:52.360
puzzle game very underrated game on the ds not the 3ds but the ds it was called medios and I love

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:56.760
this game and they did like a disney version of it that was eh and then they did a version on the

01:16:56.760 --> 01:17:01.720
xbox 360 that was really weird to control with a controller but it was it was adequate for what it

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:09.880
was but anyway luminous and medios are two big awesome puzzle games uh that are apparently now

01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:17.800
part of mobcast mobcast acquired luminous and medios from q entertainment so what are they

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:25.240
doing they're making a new luminous game for ios and android this will be a collaboration with

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:31.480
tetsuya mizuguchi so that's very interesting so that's where i feel mixed is because i love a lot

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:37.720
of q entertainment stuff but granted that's probably because of tetsuya mizuguchi so to hear

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:43.400
that he's still involved makes me a little more hopeful um i guess it's cool that it's coming to

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:51.400
cell phones uh i remember there was a luminous on ios and it was awful because the controls were

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:57.800
awful so if they're gonna fix that then i guess uh it'll be better i'm also very interested to

01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:02.920
see what this is going to mean for medios because now medios with touch controls i could kind of see

01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:09.400
that that actually might be really cool um so i'm curious to see how this all plays out so anyway

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:15.960
um mizuguchi is going to be working on luminous from his new studio enhance games but of course

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:22.760
mizuguchi left q entertainment uh after founding co-founding it in 2003 he left it in march so i

01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:27.000
mean you know again i think a big part of the reason why i like q entertainment so much is

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:33.080
because of him so if he was gone anyway then at least he's still involved with these these babies

01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:39.880
uh luminous and medios so um good luck mob cast and don't fuck it up because i really love these

01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:46.680
games and i really need them to be good on the uh mobile devices if that i mean i kind of wish

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:51.880
it was console but i understand the vita one may not have done as well as y'all wanted it to and

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:55.240
maybe that's why q entertainment was looking to get rid of it or maybe they realized there wasn't

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:59.640
much they could do with it without tetsuya mizuguchi so i don't know i'm trying to keep an

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:05.080
open mind please please please don't screw it up mob cast please all right well let's go back to

01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:10.520
let's go back to a more classic time in gaming's history because playing games on your portable

01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:15.960
phones what is that about that's not something we used to do back in the day snake no you didn't

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:20.920
even have snake there was no more your phones were still attached to the wall remember my

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:25.960
that's mario nokia phone yeah that was great you see that over there by the coffee machine

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:29.480
you see that on the wall that's a phone jack you ever seen one of those before

01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:37.320
yes and notice how it's rob i'm older than you i know you are that where i get my internet from

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:41.720
no no back in the day a little different all right yeah back in the day you'd have to call

01:19:41.720 --> 01:19:45.640
you have to call aol have a second one put in so people could use the phone instead of knocking

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:50.120
you offline that's why aol was made although i'm not really sure we should introduce our listeners

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:56.920
to what the modem really sounds like all right listen to dubstep you'll get an idea all right

01:19:56.920 --> 01:20:03.480
here it is your classic game of the week from way back when today's game is hino tori ho

01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:11.160
hen uh gaonoboken which translates to phoenix chronicles gal's adventure and it was uh the

01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:15.720
version in particular that we're covering today is the famicom version that was done by konami

01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:22.440
not the msx one it had a similarly named one on msx um but the games were based off the manga

01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:31.880
called a hino tori or phoenix uh done by um osamu teska who did uh tetsu on adam uh as in uh

01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:37.560
what did we call him over here again astro boy yeah i had to think about that for a moment

01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:43.320
because uh he also did um kimba the white lion and blackjack so those are a few others that

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:48.600
people over here might be more familiar with um so basically it's the story of a guy uh named

01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:55.720
gaol who as a kid lost an arm and an eye and he was teased poor guy and he grew up bitter

01:20:56.440 --> 01:21:05.160
very bitter and so uh as the story goes he's going um he uh basically got married had a you

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:13.400
know had a family and then went crazy and killed his wife so he's dark story yeah so basically he

01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:21.080
went to try to reform his wife he became a buddhist became a sculptor and now uh he

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:30.840
is on a uh quest to recover pieces of a phoenix statue that's uh basically he's trying to get

01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:35.800
eternal life by drinking the blood of the phoenix so basically it's a platform game

01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:41.400
um you have to take gaol through uh 16 different levels to get 16 sculpture fragments and put the

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:47.640
phoenix back together um you have boss enemies at the end of each stage um in some levels instead

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:54.040
of the boss enemy you actually have to avoid traps um or you know walls or different things to you

01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:59.720
know that try to impede your process it also has a life system so you have three lives and each have

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:04.040
a number of hit points so if you you know get hit by something you lose a hit point and when you get

01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:08.920
zero you lose one of the three lives you also uh can lose lives by falling into a pit or failing

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:15.560
to complete the level before the timer runs out um and then um you also have a little thing that

01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:20.200
you can do where if you are in a situation where you're trapped and can't progress you can press

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:25.880
the select button and he self-destructs you start the level over um and if he of course loses all

01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:30.760
three of his lives he uh you get game over and you get the chance to continue from the beginning

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:37.080
of the stage so it's really a simple game i mean it's super fun uh i have i've played this one

01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:43.400
before um i like the msx one because sort of like shock troopers except and well kind of like that

01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:48.520
actually it's like a shooter like a playing game except you're running on the ground um but i like

01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:53.640
the adventure games a little bit better especially since you know it's got such a compelling story

01:22:53.640 --> 01:23:00.200
and i don't know if anyone's ever read any of the uh phoenix manga but it's such a good story i mean

01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:05.880
it really is there's uh ferronome fans out there there's oavs i think the last one came out in 80

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:11.400
something i want to say but just gorgeous animation and it's nice you know that the

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:17.720
video games made it into parts of the story as well so um and it's so you're basically looking

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:26.600
at a little bit of uh one of the best known uh manga anime series that have been out but added

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:32.920
into the video game lore as well so there you go can you say the name of this game one more time

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:42.520
oh good lord in notary he notary hole and uh gal no bulking so um but now for anyone

01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:46.840
who is a fan of diverse systems okay look here you listen

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:59.320
no i am not listening okay um there was a cd done by uh tomoyan that was 8-bit versus diverse systems

01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:04.840
and one of the songs from the series made it in so uh if you listen to the end of the show you

01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:11.480
might get to hear it uh live live live not podcast if not then you have to go out and

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:19.960
purchase a legitimate copy of or just find it on youtube all right uh there it is uh your classic

01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:24.360
giveaway and i'm looking at chat there's a few people in chat talking about how um old anime

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:28.440
was dark i'm sorry i haven't watched i haven't watched a lot of the old ever watched dog of

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:34.920
flanders old prepare to cry old cartoons to me are like the muppet babies okay and the stuff

01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:39.880
i grew up on which you know the muppet babies wasn't really a dark show although it would have

01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:51.800
been funny if it was uh i just i was just thinking about i was reading the chat actually because pow

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:57.000
was like phoenix mongola was so good without being preachy yeah because i mean i've i've

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:03.880
always been a fan of um tesica his work has been just top notch and really uh approached topics

01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:11.800
that were not really i think touched it at the time that he did it so it's very very brilliant

01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:18.040
mind all right well there it is your classic game of the week pow dog of flanders where happiness

01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:24.040
goes to die all right well that was a good pick that was one i have to admit i didn't really know

01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:28.600
a lot about that game but knowing that it didn't i'm all about education that's good you got to

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:33.720
educate the masses heck yeah and i'm surprised you didn't you know most people you would expect

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:41.400
would have done something this week like techmo bowl or super high impact fuck the superb i was

01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:45.720
trying to think of games that had owls as the head character i'll see that would have been there but

01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:49.400
i would that would have just had me doing ocarina of time and how we wanted to shoot that owl in

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:56.520
his face i kept throwing so many deck uh games and star owls i keep thinking of harry potter

01:25:56.520 --> 01:26:01.480
i don't know why head fig games the star what if there had been a head big in the angry inch video

01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:10.200

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:42.680
with more of orange launch radio right after this we have uh rapid fire news frugal question

01:26:42.680 --> 01:26:47.640
of the week and that news segment coming up when we come back with more of orange launch radio right

01:26:47.640 --> 01:27:01.720
after this welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live on this sunday night february the 1st

01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:07.960
with the 585th episode of our show already in progress all right so i've been teasing

01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:11.800
out earlier in the show that we're going to try out a new segment in the show and we're

01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:16.600
going to put it right here and this is a response to you know last week you guys were talking about

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:22.200
or we all were really talking about the uh forums over at vog network.com and how um you know not a

01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:27.240
lot of people are really using the forums and some of you guys in chat were like well you know we

01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:31.080
we'd probably use the forums a little more if there were you know some discussions that you

01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:35.240
know were were motivating us to go over there and post so i thought you know what all right all

01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:39.720
right you know we get into a lot of debates here on the show we get into a lot of topics that we

01:27:39.720 --> 01:27:45.560
talk about that maybe we're not always necessarily done even though we have a generous three hours

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:50.440
which is longer than most podcasts go for uh sometimes even three hours isn't enough to talk

01:27:50.440 --> 01:27:54.600
about all the things that go on in gaming during the week so we might go over to the forums and

01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:59.320
continue a conversation so you'll probably see me posting on the forums a lot uh either on the

01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:04.760
orange lounge radio forum or in our general video gaming vog network forum you might see loki or

01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:09.800
dark sakura pop over there as well as they have some things to say and then you guys have some

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:16.920
things to say and we're gonna kind of wrap that all into a segment we call forum follow-up so

01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:20.840
let's get started with tonight's forum follow-up to some of the topics from last week's show

01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:28.680
all right so for tonight's forum i thought something a little funky for this segment

01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:31.960
would be a little bit a little bit different for you guys all right uh let's get to tonight's

01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:37.080
forum follow-up so there's uh two topics i want to follow up on tonight and one is last week we

01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:43.080
were talking about uh what makes a game worthy of your subscription fees and i made a post over

01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:47.880
on the forums kind of expanding on my thoughts a little more about uh elder scrolls online and the

01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:52.200
fact that elder scrolls online was going to be losing the subscription fee element of it and i

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:56.280
kind of asked the question like what why is it that some people will still pay for wow they'll

01:28:56.280 --> 01:29:01.480
pay for final fantasy 14 what makes the game more worthy of those subscription fees and you can read

01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:06.920
what i had to say on it over on the forums or you can listen to what flaco jones said in response

01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:13.480
and flaco jones on this topic said i hate sub fees hate hate hate but i re-subbed to wow because

01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:19.320
i love the game and i just had to see the new content i only pay 30 days at a time though never

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:24.280
recurring so i have the option to start and stop when i want it's worth it because i'm having a

01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:30.680
blast but i think a sub model is so outdated and a rip-off when 60 games like skyrim dragon age and

01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:35.480
diablo give you hundreds of hours of content let's not talk about how many hours i've sunk

01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:42.360
into diablo 3 okay you know it just popped it in my head huh i can quit any time yeah right yeah

01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:45.640
i'm sure that's what alan would say about diablo 3 right now because he's not playing right now or

01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:49.160
anything he's either playing that or dragon age inquisition it's got to be one of those he's

01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:53.080
playing laundry he's playing with sanrio to be fair he's playing i did go back and pet sanrio

01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:58.120
by the way good good uh continuing on with flaco jones's thought here uh hundreds of hours of

01:29:58.120 --> 01:30:04.120
content for one price and maybe add on some dlc to pay for later if wow just charge subs to do

01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:09.880
stupid endgame crap like rating or whatever i'd be the happiest gamer ever because i just like to

01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:16.280
level and question stuff and i think paying for the expansion should cover the cost at least um

01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:21.080
so that was on that topic and then another topic to follow up on was amiibos at the top of the show

01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:25.720
last week i was talking a little bit about amiibo and how i personally was feeling like i'm kind of

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:31.240
over it like i am over this amiibo fever i hate this artificial shortage that nintendo is creating

01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:36.440
they should just have an online store when this stuff is so popular like i i spelled out my

01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:43.880
thoughts on the forums a little more um verbosely and some of you guys responded to uh my thoughts

01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:49.560
and so i want to read some of those responses uh gamer fox replied and said the extremely limited

01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:55.240
availability of certain amiibo is a real turn off it's also frustrating to order the products online

01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:59.880
as orders have been canceled or postponed indefinitely but for me most of the hunt

01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:04.440
happens in person and i've been pretty lucky so far in scoring some from various retailers like

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:08.680
toys r us which is right by my house i'm not looking for a complete collection which sets

01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:13.160
me apart from others perhaps i'm okay with not getting all those really limited characters as

01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:18.440
long as they're not ones that i really want like uh like bowser or legend of zelda characters

01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:23.240
my latest pickup last night was literally a stroke of pure luck i can see how that kind of roll the

01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:28.920
dice can be frustrating for fans i entirely echo that sentiment i'm mostly collecting the amiibo

01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:32.920
because they're collectibles and i like the figures i'm also hoping for some increased

01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:39.800
functionality from nintendo down the line too and then uh pow also responded to this and said

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:44.440
i like the amiibo but the low availability changed my initial plan to get them all

01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:49.080
i'm not going to start a collection when even mr awata is telling me that having the whole

01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:53.000
collection is going to be hard i got the ones that i consider to be classics and now i'm

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:57.800
done with amiibo i wasn't surprised with the initial sold out panic moment but i am surprised

01:31:57.800 --> 01:32:02.440
with nintendo's lack of interest for restocking them i'm not buying the whole shelf space is a

01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:07.160
challenge story since i was born in europe and many of my european buddies don't have as many

01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:12.280
issues to find them than my american friends sorry but the idea that shelf space is an issue in the

01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:17.880
usa but not in japan sounds like a bad joke even if that excuse is true you have an online store

01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:24.040
nintendo use it oh pow really summarizes my feelings on the matter uh personally very well

01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:28.440
i think it makes a great point there is it's like okay so you somehow have the shelf space in japan

01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:32.280
but you don't have it here i mean i guess i understand the collectibles may be a little more

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:36.520
of a thing in japan but i just i have a hard time believing that shelf space is that big of a

01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:42.440
concern here especially with how crazy some of that stuff sells and um you know even today target

01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:48.840
released the rosalina figures and i know multiple people on twitter that were up at the crack of

01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:55.080
dawn to go line up a target and get their rosalina figures you know and like i'm not one to knock on

01:32:55.080 --> 01:33:00.440
other people's hobbies and what's fun for you and if you got a reward out of that i'm happy for you

01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:06.440
and so forth but it's kind of one of those like i am like over it like if why can't i just log on to

01:33:06.440 --> 01:33:12.520
amazon and buy it like a new pair of socks like or any other nintendo game or something like that

01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:19.080
like i don't understand why it's such a it's like it's february 1st it's not the holidays where

01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:23.880
we're all lining up for that stuff it's just it's so weird to me so weird uh looking in the chat room

01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:28.440
over at live.vog network.com fifth dream says ami bover it

01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:35.880
anyway uh i hate to i hate to leave that so negative on amiibo but that was uh that was

01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:39.400
some of the feedback but i have seen a lot of positive i think the people that feel real

01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:43.720
positive about amiibo are just too busy playing super smash brothers and leveling their amiibos

01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:48.760
to 50 uh to comment this week i guess i'm gonna assume that's the case so anyway there it is

01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:53.000
first edition of forum feedback we obviously we're never gonna be able to read every forum post

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:57.160
and they'll usually have to be edited for length but we do you know it is a show where every gamer

01:33:57.160 --> 01:34:01.560
has a voice and our forums is another place where you can share your voice over at vog network.com

01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:05.720
you click on forums or you can just go to forums.vognetwork.com

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:12.200
to register participation for this week's episode of orange on radio at vognetwork.com

01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:17.320
use the passphrase rice all right let's get into some rapid fire news tonight loki

01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:28.440
okay so i don't know you know basically dragon's dogma online sounds pretty awesome and it's this

01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:34.920
brand new free-to-play game that they're gonna be putting out on playstation 4 playstation 3 and pc

01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:40.360
now i never really got into the original dragon dogma game but this almost sounds like and

01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:45.880
i don't know if you've heard much about it rob it almost sounds like to me the co-op stuff that

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:52.200
they have for dragon age inquisition because it's basically going and be going off um with parties

01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:59.720
i guess they're saying um parties of eight are um you know i guess up to four players for certain

01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:05.320
parties and then they also have um you can spawn ai players as well so up to a party of eight four

01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:12.600
player real people and then um i guess that you just kind of go off on these like quests and stuff

01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:16.520
and do different missions or whatever but they're also going to have these hub worlds where there's

01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:21.800
a bunch of people they can interact with so maybe a little bit dragon age inquisition and maybe a

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:28.200
little bit like fancy star online i guess i don't know well those are some of my favorite games

01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:32.520
although i in all honesty i kind of find the dragon age inquisition multiplayer to be a little

01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:37.880
bit repetitive it's it's it feels way more grindy than mass effect did it doesn't it doesn't click

01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:41.800
the same for me but again i know other people are really enjoying it so i'm not to knock on

01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:45.800
other people's fun but this dragon's dogma sounds very interesting i don't know much about the online

01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:50.360
one but uh i'd check it out yeah they haven't really announced any sort of dates or anything

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:56.040
and right now it's just scheduled for japan this year so i guess we'll have to wait a little bit

01:35:56.040 --> 01:36:03.960
before we hear about it or hopefully it does come over here who knows um but yeah um sounds

01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:09.560
interesting uh they're saying though they also um there was a european trademark for the game as

01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:15.160
well so hopefully that means that there will be um an international release for it as well at least

01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:23.160
in the uk um and then to go along um with a game that i've been playing lately which is the lego

01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:32.280
marvel superheroes they have now um announced a few more lego titles for 2015 and with that

01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:41.800
includes um lego jurassic world and lego's marvel adventures or marvel's avengers yeah so um

01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:48.440
i guess i'll have to pick up the avengers game and they haven't really said yet when those are

01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:54.920
supposed to be coming out oh um also if you're not into the licensed lego like movie properties

01:36:54.920 --> 01:37:00.280
they also have the lego ninjago shadow of ronin that's supposed to be coming out later on i got

01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:08.360
made to watch some of that show the lego ninjago yes i'm trying to get my son to watch other lego

01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:15.560
stuff because uh you know they don't really have um it made more marvel games it made my soul hurt

01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:20.760
have they done lego jurassic park games before or is this the first lego jurassic park toys i think

01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:25.640
huh but not not the games not not games i think i mean i remember the jurassic park games back when

01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:30.120
like that first movie was out and like i the super nintendo one was scary as hell because that was

01:37:30.120 --> 01:37:33.960
right when first person and doom doom s type of games were really starting to take over so they

01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:39.400
kind of did that on super it was scary interesting see what they do um i don't know they had raptors

01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:44.040
in one of the levels in lego marvel superheroes the thing that doesn't click for me is that

01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:47.240
jurassic park and that whole thing it's not i i didn't think it was supposed to be something that

01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:53.880
was cute like it's kind of scary i guess it's you know it's pg-13 scary it's you know poltergeist

01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:58.200
scary but it's still scary yeah i don't know how they're gonna exactly do that could could they do

01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:05.400
lego poltergeist if they can do lego can we have a little lego gypsy lady and if you don't own

01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:09.640
consoles though but you have um an ios device they also announced that they're gonna be bringing the

01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:15.640
lego movie and lego batman 3 beyond gotham to those devices as well huh interesting so um i

01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:19.880
don't know i'm interested in checking out the lego marvel avengers i'm a little worried that they may

01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:27.240
i don't know it may not be as robust as like the first game honestly that's what kind of kept me

01:38:27.240 --> 01:38:33.240
away from lego batman 3 is that it wasn't open world like you know marvel superheroes was i'm

01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:38.280
more interested in lego batman 2 but i don't really want to pick that up for my playstation

01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:46.200
3 since i'm using a playstation 4 now um and then they have announced the titles for xbox's uh games

01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:54.600
of gold for february so in february you'll be able to get uh for xbox one idarb which is kind of a

01:38:54.600 --> 01:39:02.360
strange sports game that has a ton of integration with uh twitch and twitch chat you can basically

01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:08.760
troll the people playing the game with um chat comments and uh you'll actually get to play that

01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:16.840
uh free and i think earlier um it's supposed to be coming out in february i'm not sure when

01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:21.320
it's exactly launching let's see here now they haven't said when it's launching standalone

01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:26.360
outside i'm guessing outside of february but uh you'll be able to you know pick it up for free

01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:36.360
and then also on xbox 360 for the first half of the month they will be giving you um let's see

01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:41.480
well so i guess it's idarb for the first half of the month i thought that was only on xbox one

01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:46.520
though i know that the other two titles uh brothers a tale of two sons will be coming out as well and

01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:52.280
then the second half of the month they're gonna have sniper elite v2 so lots of 505 stuff for

01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:57.960
this month i guess um so yeah let's see your free titles so go pick them up even if you don't want

01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:03.880
them because you might someday and it's free uh the folks in chat over at live.vog network.com

01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:09.240
talking a lot about the lego stuff uh tiger claw says uh lego jurassic world willing uh which will

01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:13.720
include all four movies so i didn't know that is that going to incorporate the whole lore hopefully

01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:17.480
well i can't imagine that they'd be able to stretch out one movie's worth of stuff into

01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:22.600
that i don't know and then fifth dream says uh lego the rocky horror picture show and links me

01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:26.600
to a youtube i can't do youtubes or broadcasting live but i can only imagine what that must look

01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:33.000
like i somehow think that is not an official lego brand i don't think but if it was that's hilarious

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:37.560
oh my god i can see them doing remember they were trying to push for the lego uh back to the future

01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:41.400
or something like that i could see i'll be cool well tiger claw says uh the lego games i'd love

01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:45.800
to see happen one day they need to do lego teenage mutant ninja turtles exactly i was just about to

01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:49.960
say that because they have the toys for that so why not i would be fun totally be down for that

01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:55.640
i know my son be down for that too all right uh let's do some more quick news here uh starting

01:40:55.640 --> 01:41:03.480
off with this a wonder boy spiritual successor monster boy could happen for weu and this is going

01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:08.920
to be based off a kickstarter uh the kickstarter page for the game says that right now the game is

01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:14.520
only going to be coming to the playstation 4 and pc but there are some other formats and some folks

01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:21.720
hoping that weu xbox one would be some of those other formats so monster boy is an all-new adventure

01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:26.920
uh that is uh created with the creator of the original monster world uh it can be considered

01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:31.480
an official part of the series but since the trademark is owned by sega they had to change

01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:36.920
the name new hand-drawn graphics and an improved art style uh new transformations replacing the

01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:40.680
bear and the hamster uh the game will still have an open world but some of the environments have

01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:44.600
changed that fit a little more with the monster world universe so if you're curious in checking

01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:48.920
that out again and you know i i'm sure a lot of folks would love to see that come to weu

01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:52.200
but it's going to have to make a lot of money so i get over to that kickstarter you can come

01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:56.360
to at least playstation 4 uh that is on kickstarter if you want to check that out for

01:41:56.360 --> 01:42:03.800
monster boy i'm sure if you look that up you will find it quickly um cave story 2 it's probably a

01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:11.240
thing um especially if some of the things revealed on desktops at packs south are to be believed

01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:18.840
uh during pack south uh i guess uh a folder for cave story 2 was spotted on a laptop from the

01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:25.320
game publishers but you know i mean duh the cave story 2 is probably a thing this doesn't strike me

01:42:25.320 --> 01:42:29.880
as something that's particularly surprising but there you go it looks like something that is being

01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:34.360
worked on or i mean anything could be in that folder though it could just be concepts it could

01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:39.960
be things that were ultimately cancelled i kind of doubt it but it could be it could be it could

01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:45.720
be fanfic it could be fanfic it very well could be it could be uh could be things downloaded from

01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:52.280
deviantart who knows anyhow um speaking of deviantart and uh some of the art people are

01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:58.520
going to make with this world of warcraft in the latest patch 6.1 is going to be giving out a new

01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:06.680
item called the s e l f i e camera that's right it's a selfie camera and that's what it does it

01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:13.080
allows you to have your character take selfies did the gnomes make it um i'm assuming they had

01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:20.520
to have i don't know who made gnomes gave us disco balls i know it's a trinket that you actually

01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:27.160
equip on your character um and that's you know i don't see any of the lore behind this but i'm

01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:32.360
sure it's got to be a gnome thing sure it has to be anyway i'm glad that selfie cameras can

01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:37.000
be part of world warcraft lore yeah right well i imagine it's going to be the type of thing that

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:44.360
people uh do uh machinima use this in machinima it's like a new camera angle for some people

01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:47.960
but the other thing about the selfie camera is that not only do you take selfies of your

01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:52.920
character but this is actually kind of funny because you do a mission and you get an upgrade

01:43:52.920 --> 01:44:01.720
kit that gives you the selfie camera mk2 and now you get filters for your selfies instagram in wow

01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:08.440
yeah it worked out well for them in grand theft auto 5 so i can't i can't i can't complain filter

01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:16.200
yeah it's a little it's a it's a little stretching it you know trying to incorporate into lore but

01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:21.640
whatever i guess it should be noted now it should be noted that also coming in the 6-1 patch for

01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:26.280
world of warcraft is twitter integration and i think maybe facebook integration but i know

01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:30.840
just twitter integration where you can tweet you mean spam integration from you can tweet from

01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:36.760
within world of warcraft so gosh this makes an awful lot of sense because now not only can people

01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:42.600
post selfies of their real selves through instagram they can post selfies of their fake selves

01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:47.880
right there in world of war you realize we're a patch away from slash pizza

01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:55.080
i'm surprised it's not already a thing that's why i don't remember slash slash panda express

01:44:55.080 --> 01:45:02.920
i think was the thing yes so there it is uh the selfie camera coming to world of warcraft dark

01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:11.240
sakura well um moving into a different uh genre we'll go into some fighting games um

01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:18.200
mortal kombat x it is x not 10 right so anyway at least that's how they're going yeah yeah

01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:25.560
stupid anyway um ermak is the latest roster uh latest person showing up in the roster

01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:33.080
and um there are uh already videos of them up on the nether realm twitch stream um katana and

01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:38.280
reptile are also on the character select screen um they're going to be played on the next stream

01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:44.840
but right now ermak and uh it's going to be out on april 14th don't get it for me for my birthday

01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:49.800
that clueless gamer stream video was hilarious did you see that the clueless gamer that conan

01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:54.600
o'brien did with the two two football guys playing mortal kombat and i know football but it was

01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:59.400
really funny it was really really funny because surely actions surely you've heard of the guy

01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:04.840
from the seahawks that got up there and was like i'm only here so i won't get fined and he was

01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:08.120
answering all the questions of the president i'm only here so i won't get fined well he was in the

01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:12.680
conan o'brien video and he was much more animated like you know you actually got to see like a more

01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:16.440
personable side of him but what i thought was great is that they were sitting there playing

01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:21.080
mortal kombat and you know conan says something about like what type of games do you like guys

01:46:21.080 --> 01:46:27.880
like to play and that same guy who goes mario kart because toad and it's just but i mean and i

01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:31.160
actually i actually did write a tweet about this because i thought it was very interesting that

01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:39.880
this obvious mortal kombat x promo video kind of turned into uh mortal kart um mario kart nintendo

01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:44.360
discussion and just speaks to the power of those games that nintendo makes like the reaction to

01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:49.720
like some of the the fatalities well even oh my god even my reaction to the fatalities like okay

01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:54.120
look i love mortal kombat there's always been a place for mortal kombat it's very over the top

01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:57.720
but you guys know i don't like gore i don't like saw and all this which i know is weird like how

01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:02.120
do you like mortal kombat but you don't like gore it's really really fake because yeah in the

01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:07.640
original mortal kombat games it was over the top stupid fake like in mortal kombat 2 okay they

01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:13.400
slice off the person's head and just a big glob of blood goes you know it's really stupid and fake

01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:19.240
right but now as i'm watching more and more for this one i'm like okay it's still over the top but

01:47:19.240 --> 01:47:25.720
it's it's getting a little much like getting the skin cam or the the skeleton where they chop off

01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:30.360
the front half of the guy's face and the brain falls out and others i'm like this is this is

01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:35.480
getting to be a bit much i'm not sure about my feelings was it like he sucker punched her in

01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:40.520
the vagina or something like that that was hilarious you can't do that oh yeah their

01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:46.120
reaction to that was was it was it was cassie cage did that it was uh cassie cage did the split thing

01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:52.600
that her dad johnny cage used to do right and she punches that b girl in the she visited her place

01:47:53.160 --> 01:48:00.200
and it was uh it was like their reaction was like oh fisting in mortal kombat yes yes yes hilarious

01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:04.600
anyway well how about something a little bit less violent i mean it's still violent but less violent

01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:10.840
okay um udon um udon has done some fantabulous uh capcom artwork they've done some of the last

01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:18.200
few of the official uh art books and whatnot and uh some of the comics but they um have a

01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:25.240
project out right now that's called the uh capcom fighting tribute where they're basically taking

01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:31.080
fan submissions to go into the book um they've extended the uh deadline until february 9th so

01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:36.760
that you can go on to uh the udon blog and do your submission but some other people who um have uh

01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:43.240
contributed to the past ones i mean uh which were the uh street fighter tribute and dark stalkers

01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:49.560
tribute were like brian leo malley and scott campbell and wendy chew different people you know

01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:54.760
who tremendous artwork um were in some of the previous editions so if you make it in you would

01:48:54.760 --> 01:49:00.120
be in good company and you have to put olr somewhere in your artwork yes hide it somewhere

01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:08.120
in there please hide it make us make us a easter egg and then in more serious news the fcc has

01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:15.800
raised minimum broadband standards by a whole bunch minimum broadband is now 25 mbps instead

01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:23.240
of four um and the new minimum upload speed is three from one so that means that basically

01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:30.200
homes that don't have good broadband are now going to be federally granted better broadband

01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:36.680
which is funny because uh talking with some of my friends overseas like they're on average like six

01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:43.240
you know and that's good so we really are spoiled for broadband over here but if we've got the

01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:48.600
technology and the means to do it why not and it's also that they can't market something as

01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:53.480
broadband unless it reaches these certain levels right yeah exactly got it because i mean i think

01:49:53.480 --> 01:50:02.440
now you've got uh at least what 2k on uh certain dial-ups and yeah so uh this is you know it's

01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:09.160
good news it means that we're gonna have better you know faster internet for more people or playing

01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:16.920
a you know rock band online let's hope there's a new rock band to play online we'll see all right

01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:22.200
well let's get to the foogle question of the week uh you take facebook and google plus you slam it

01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:33.880
together you get foogle each week we like to ask a question of our facebook and google communities

01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:38.600
and we're going to read some of our favorite answers on the show right now uh we asked a

01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:44.280
pretty easy question this week because you know obviously you know we're not oblivious to what's

01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:48.360
going on in the real world there's probably a lot of people listening to the podcast this week and

01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:53.960
less live because of a particular phenomenon that seems to happen this time of year it's the

01:50:53.960 --> 01:50:58.920
commercial bowl right everybody's watching the commercials for the puppies right the puppies

01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:04.600
all playing against each other the katy perry concert all right well anyway look uh so we all

01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:09.400
know there's a big football game today uh and we're sure you all know about big sports games

01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:17.720
like madden and fifa but what's your favorite obscure sports game now a lot of things qualify

01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:22.120
as sports so i purposely let's left this vague because i want to see what people came up with

01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:28.040
so maybe it's something you see on espn 3 or the ocho or maybe it's a foot basket baseball game

01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:32.920
that not a lot of people have heard about so what's your favorite non-mainstream sports game

01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:39.480
so some of the comments in chat ander says i love magic the gathering that was on espn at one point

01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:45.640
so i guess that counts does magic the gathering count of sports i guess i guess i guess it does

01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:49.400
whatever you consider have you ever been to a tournament rob there are people who sweat there

01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:54.600
that's that's true that is true uh critical myth says i wish it'd been a better game

01:51:54.600 --> 01:51:59.640
but the quidditch ea game from the ps2 era was fun for a little while there you go some harry

01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:03.640
potter quidditch weren't some people trying to turn that into a real sport at some point like

01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:09.000
quote i mean like a sport in the real world rules already it's on a foot foot thing yeah where you

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:13.400
play it i would think you'd at least play it on roller skates so you can glide it's kind of like

01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:17.640
with a broom handle between your legs so it just looks like you go around whipping

01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:25.000
people with your giant broom handle okay maybe this is maybe i just need to keep some thoughts

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:32.920
to myself uh mike b replies on facebook saying i would like to see croquet and badminton i'm

01:52:32.920 --> 01:52:36.840
surprised there's never been a there's got to be a croquet or a badminton game out there somewhere

01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:43.000
especially badminton come on everybody loves a shuttlecock you know what that's what they're

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:47.720
called i want lawn darts the game who in lawn darts game where you you know if you hit somebody

01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:55.880

darts in there okay but i want lethal lawn darts all right lethal is that a dream game lethal

01:53:03.640 --> 01:53:11.080
then that would be i think there were lawn darts in zombies ate my neighbors i think maybe i don't

01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:15.080
remember you know why lawn darts were banned because of people you know getting poked with them

01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:23.400
impaled because those are huge francisco you replied and said uh does daytona usa on the

01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:41.480

01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:50.920
guys for participating with the frugal question of the week let's get back to some news loki

01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:58.760
all right yeah does unit racers count because that i mean i think you'd erasers ought to count

01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:08.040
that's a great race a great one unicycles anyways um sega sammy is cutting hundreds of jobs

01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:14.600
they're basically prioritizing on digital games because uh console market isn't working out for

01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:22.200
them too well but they're going to be cutting or i should say soliciting voluntary retirement

01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:29.960
for around 300 employees and they're saying um 120 are supposed to be approached by next month

01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:39.320
and most of the layoffs um include the in i guess uh include the uh san francisco

01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:41.960
offices in southern california offices

01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:49.560
this makes me sad first first it was the fact that the sega logo wasn't on that building anymore

01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:53.320
and it was a zinga logo that went up on that building and now now to hear that sega is no

01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:57.400
longer going to have a presence at all in san francisco is depressing to say the least

01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:07.640
i don't know i just think i think the uh sonic's just not working out for them i guess i don't

01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:12.600
well i don't you know i don't i don't know like there there seems to be some things that sega

01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:19.720
seems to do pretty well on that um that uh kart racing game the sega all-stars sonic racing that

01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:24.360
was pretty good it was a competent game i mean it wasn't quite at the level of mario kart but

01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:28.200
it was a good kind of bandage for that first year of the wii u when there wasn't a mario kart like

01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:31.880
it was they need to just go back to the day when they're making like dreamcast games because the

01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:39.320
dreamcast stuff was awesome also like fantasy star online 2 like fantasy star online had a

01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:43.400
birthday this week in the us anyway i know the japanese release was a little sooner but in the

01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:48.680
us fantasy star online had a birthday this week and and it made me think how long has fantasy

01:57:48.680 --> 01:57:53.800
star online 2 been out and then they even have nova on the vita and we just don't even don't

01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:57.880
even have a lick of a trace of it here in the us i guess they just don't think it's gonna do well

01:57:57.880 --> 01:58:02.040
and now that this closure is happening it just makes me go well shit if they're gonna focus

01:58:02.040 --> 01:58:07.720
only on mobile and stuff now we're hosed we're not gonna see it anymore it's very sad maybe

01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:12.680
they're the next company that's gonna go under uh i hate to think that but doesn't sega also

01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:18.360
have a big business i mean they're probably that but they have a huge business in um arcade games

01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:23.640
they run arcades in japan and here don't they yeah i wouldn't want to see them go under them

01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:28.600
they do the crane games a lot of it's possibly that we just won't see they'll go the way konami

01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:34.600
whereas yeah they're you know you're gonna see maybe a release or two a year and it's just all

01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:39.800
gonna be mobile tiles well but at least konami's got pt silent hills if nothing else that's true

01:58:39.800 --> 01:58:44.600
there's nothing else and he is all metal gear yeah your solid five t is all it will be a good

01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:52.360
year for them and winning 11 that still cares about that wrong country yes this country doesn't

01:58:52.360 --> 01:59:00.120
care about that other countries it's important in other countries so all right uh well i'm i

01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:06.600
don't know this this news makes me very sad and it was i mean for me this was the same day as all

01:59:06.600 --> 01:59:11.960
the nintendo stuff we were debating earlier so i mean where some of my thought comes from on why

01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:17.080
i do think game companies should get a cut because when i hear about stuff like this i'm like well

01:59:17.080 --> 01:59:22.520
maybe yeah i mean if if even if the sega that they got a cut from let's play videos only amounted to

01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:28.040
like a hundred thousand dollars that could still be like two people's jobs well in san francisco

01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:32.760
salaries maybe only one person's job but you know it could still help them in keeping some of these

01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:38.200
that's never how that money's that's never how it's been it's not about keeping someone's job

01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:44.520
it's you know that's a hundred thousand extra dollars that they could have you know in profit

01:59:44.520 --> 01:59:48.680
not like oh we're not gonna keep we're gonna keep another person here uh some comments in chat over

01:59:48.680 --> 01:59:53.800
at live.vog network.com s2100 matt says alien isolation sold like crazy for them recently

01:59:53.800 --> 01:59:59.080
but that isn't an originally licensed title dungeon buster says sonic boom tanked hard

01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:04.680
everyone hated it yeah sonic boom didn't look super appealing to me i must say shocking that

02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:09.880
they took no feedback from anybody and like said hey you know everyone's like you know what those

02:00:09.880 --> 02:00:16.120
were hog sections in the games before we fucking hated them just give us sonic and they're like

02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:22.600
hey we're gonna put more of that stuff in there we're gonna make him super tall for no fucking

02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:28.360
reason all right well uh thanks to some hackers because you know hackers gonna hack uh some

02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:33.720
hackers took a look at the uh new nintendo 3ds and the new nintendo 3ds xl which coming out here

02:00:33.720 --> 02:00:37.640
in the states in a couple weeks but uh the japanese ones are already out there right i was talking

02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:42.280
about my experience playing one on last week's show uh the hackers have found out by looking

02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:48.360
through these consoles that there is a video decoder that supports h264 why is this important

02:00:48.360 --> 02:00:55.000
because it's the same video format used to stream wii u content to the gamepad so of course folks

02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:02.280
are speculating could the new 3ds actually function as a wii u gamepad which is funny

02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:06.360
because i want to say when the wii u first came out i threw this suggestion out there about the

02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:11.400
current 3ds but some folks were saying it couldn't handle it the processing power wouldn't be enough

02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:16.440
well now here we are with the new 3ds that maybe does have the processing power to handle that

02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:26.840
is this nintendo's way around producing um new uh or or the standalone uh gamepads wii u gamepads

02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:31.800
so that you can have games that support more than one gamepad because right now games can't really

02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:37.880
support more than one gamepad but if they made it so that oh well you could use your new 3ds as a

02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:42.200
as a full functional wii u controller then that would open it up for all these new experiences

02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:47.560
assuming of course people have new 3ds is available but in a lot of nintendo households

02:01:47.560 --> 02:01:52.360
they probably do so it wouldn't surprise me to hear that this is the route they're going to go down

02:01:53.160 --> 02:01:59.880
i don't know why can't i use the gamepad as a 3ds that's a great question and i think that's

02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:03.960
something you'll probably i mean virtual console i i can't believe it hasn't already happened where

02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:09.720
ds games are coming out on virtual console at least ds games but i don't know maybe it's still

02:02:09.720 --> 02:02:16.840
a matter of time we'll see so we'll see what develops with that dark sakura well you know

02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:22.920
everyone is everyone familiar with the left behind series i roll insert here well um there

02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:29.720
is a Hawaiian court sided with the securities exchange commission sec against an executive from

02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:39.720
the publisher left behind games who was caught um doing uh using insider information um for stock

02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:49.320
trading so basically uh he uh got the got kicked pretty hard for it so basically um the founder

02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:55.960
this is the same court that also nailed the founder Troy Linden for uh found him liable

02:02:55.960 --> 02:03:02.440
for 3.6 million in disgorgement interest and penalties um after granting sec's motion for

02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:13.880
summary judgment so basically uh for being a you know quote christian organization they sure are

02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:25.400
some greedy bastards mailed that's it all right i'm starting to see if anybody is commenting that

02:03:25.400 --> 02:03:31.800
over at live.vognetwork.com in our chat room but uh most people still still stuck on the 3ds uh

02:03:31.800 --> 02:03:36.280
tiger coloss saying it'd be nice if the new 3ds had the ability to broadcast the games on twitch

02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:42.120
instead of having people send in their old 3ds to get it modded with a 3ds capture device but

02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:46.600
it sounds like Jamie what you're talking about is more where i say oh these companies should get

02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:51.000
that extra hundred thousand dollars they can help them save jobs that money would really be used for

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:56.280
things you're talking about right like insider stock trading and all that type of crap it just

02:03:56.280 --> 02:04:05.720
means i just i hate people who are more interested in their own personal greed than in the well-being

02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:12.360
of other people that's i'm gonna get political with it i'm gonna get political that's a problem

02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:19.800
with capitalism there has to be some kind of balance in the system that's going to make sure

02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:24.680
that other people are going to be well taken care of so but you know the thing is that as many

02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:30.120
people get nailed for this there's more of them getting you know pats on the back from their

02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:36.360
investors or from the people they've done favors for or you know their government buddies so it's

02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:41.560
just i'm i'm gonna stop before i go on a tangent it's fine it happened everybody has personal

02:04:41.560 --> 02:04:46.200
thoughts on things i'm served some may disagree but that's that's why we're the show where every

02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:50.840
gamer has a voice all right uh a few more stories for you guys before we get to the mailbag logie

02:04:51.560 --> 02:04:58.520
so he is getting some more seed money uh with the chinese e-commerce company alibaba apparently

02:04:58.520 --> 02:05:05.080
they've injected 10 million dollars into uh the console and the thought is that they're

02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:11.720
possibly going to be using the uia software and game library to um add it to their set top box

02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:17.720
and you may remember that they have that uia everywhere um initiative that they started off

02:05:17.720 --> 02:05:21.880
with the mad cats mojo console which actually i haven't really heard too much about that console

02:05:21.880 --> 02:05:27.640
since it's i'm pretty sure that's out already i wonder how that works with the mojo and if it

02:05:27.640 --> 02:05:35.800
works well it'd be interesting to see um julie erman didn't confirm that but apparently it's

02:05:35.800 --> 02:05:41.160
been reported by the wall street journal and uh basically you know they had all they've confirmed

02:05:41.160 --> 02:05:46.680
is that they've been working with other partners to bring their platform and games to devices um

02:05:46.680 --> 02:05:57.480
you know starting with the mad cats um device here in the u.s and um zao mi in china so i don't

02:05:57.960 --> 02:06:02.760
it's interesting i keep forgetting about the uya yeah i was like i was gonna ask like so what's the

02:06:02.760 --> 02:06:07.960
uya been up to for the past years because fuck if i know i mean it seems like there's still you know

02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:11.800
when i guess like stuff on there but yeah when i go to some of the trade shows like at e3 last

02:06:11.800 --> 02:06:17.160
year at the indie cave booth you know it definitely is there's a lot of indie support for uya but the

02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:23.480
thing is a lot of the stuff that's on uya i feel like is still available on steam so as somebody

02:06:23.480 --> 02:06:28.520
who already owns a pc and does a lot of gaming there i don't always see the need to get the uya

02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:33.240
separately but this is very interesting if uya is going to try and carve a niche for itself maybe in

02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:37.960
foreign markets where you know especially in a place like china a lot of these other consoles

02:06:37.960 --> 02:06:43.400
don't do business in china or i think wasn't the xbox one like supposed to like just come out in

02:06:43.400 --> 02:06:47.960
china but then it got pushed back and you know but like they're trying to kind of break through

02:06:47.960 --> 02:06:52.280
so it'd be very interesting if the uya can maybe carve a niche for that and being you know because

02:06:52.280 --> 02:06:57.160
china's a pretty big place if you weren't aware it would be interesting to see if maybe uya can

02:06:57.160 --> 02:07:02.920
make money in those markets that are tapped for some of the other big players it would be

02:07:02.920 --> 02:07:06.920
interesting to see i i'm kind of curious to do some more research on that mojo console just

02:07:06.920 --> 02:07:12.440
because i know that's out already and one of the cool things about it was you're able to map like

02:07:12.440 --> 02:07:18.200
controls using the controller for games that didn't necessarily support controllers if that

02:07:18.200 --> 02:07:22.920
makes sense yeah um so i'm kind of curious to see it looks like that they just basically run the

02:07:22.920 --> 02:07:29.000
uya games through an app on the actual device plus you know can do just android games as well so

02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:36.760
i'd be curious to see how that how that looks or and also to see if the games on that console play

02:07:36.760 --> 02:07:42.040
better than say on the uya itself because uya itself isn't that powerful so it'd be kind of

02:07:42.040 --> 02:07:48.120
interesting to see you know how that would differ and besides that looks like i like their controller

02:07:48.120 --> 02:07:56.040
a lot better all right well um moving on to a story about final fantasy 15. i know a lot of

02:07:56.040 --> 02:07:59.960
you guys are looking forward to final fantasy 15 of course we don't know the date for that yet but

02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:06.760
we do know a demo is coming out with final fantasy type 0 hd which is due on the playstation 4 but

02:08:06.760 --> 02:08:10.440
even though we're being promised that we're going to get this final fantasy 15 demo with

02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:16.760
final fantasy type 0 there is a possibility that the final fantasy 15 demo may not make it in time

02:08:16.760 --> 02:08:22.200
for final fantasy type 0 hd and where this is coming from is from an ask me anything that was

02:08:22.200 --> 02:08:27.160
done this week uh the director behind type 0 hajima tabata actually went on reddit to do one

02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:31.560
of these ask me anythings and one of the things he said about the final fantasy 15 demo he didn't

02:08:31.560 --> 02:08:36.920
want to share you know he wanted to focus on type 0 and getting people to pre-order it but uh as far

02:08:36.920 --> 02:08:41.800
as the final fantasy 15 demo went he said the team is doing its best but they're still optimizing the

02:08:41.800 --> 02:08:48.760
game it may not make type 0's hd launch a few details were given out though that you will be

02:08:48.760 --> 02:08:55.000
able to jump in the game and cindy's identity will be revealed in or is it cindy or sydney i

02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:00.920
thought it was sydney because it's a female cid now in 15 or i guess we're gonna get that answer

02:09:00.920 --> 02:09:07.800
if uh you know perhaps if uh cindy or sydney or whatever her name is is the actual incarnation

02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:12.040
of syd in the game or maybe it's like syd's daughter or something who knows there's a

02:09:12.040 --> 02:09:15.960
million things that could be going on uh we'll find that out in the final fantasy 15 demo

02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:21.000
apparently whenever that comes out it may not actually come out i would imagine what would

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:27.800
happen if it doesn't make type 0's release is that you'll get a code for the demo that will download

02:09:27.800 --> 02:09:33.880
whenever they do release it a couple weeks later but it may not be the same time now keep in mind

02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:38.360
this isn't the first game to ever have this happen for example a game like crackdown way

02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:43.240
back on the xbox 360 yes the original crackdown on 360 one of the big reasons why people bought

02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:48.440
that game was because of the halo 3 demo right but the halo 3 demo was not the exact same time

02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:53.480
as crackdown came out it was well after you know it was a couple months after so it's not like

02:09:53.480 --> 02:09:57.960
there isn't precedent for this ever happening before so i want to say that they said originally

02:09:57.960 --> 02:10:02.200
that it wasn't going to be at the same time maybe a later date but you just get access to it i think

02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:07.560
a lot of people might be assuming that i don't know i was going to pick up type 0 anyway the

02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:13.080
final fantasy 15 demo is just kind of icing on the cake in my opinion but we'll see we'll see if uh

02:10:13.080 --> 02:10:17.800
it impacts sales or what have you meanwhile we're going to go to the mailbag you guys send us emails

02:10:17.800 --> 02:10:22.200
every week at participate at orange lounge radio.com and dark soccer is going to dive into

02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:28.360
the mailbag head first and uh find some emails from y'all that are worth going but first this

02:10:28.360 --> 02:10:36.040
time but first cannonball cannonball yep so we actually have a bunch of emails from uh robert m

02:10:36.040 --> 02:10:39.560
all right i i hope they're all as short as the first one so i'll go look at them

02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:45.240
after hearing the raging spazzinators advice i plan to call sony support next week i'm writing

02:10:45.240 --> 02:10:50.120
this wednesday 1 28 instead of repairs or replacement work this week has been pretty

02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:54.600
busy and i haven't actually had any of the issues i described for a while but have no intention of

02:10:54.600 --> 02:10:59.320
taking it for granted is there any way to back up key save data onto physical media just to be

02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:05.480
on the safe side before we go further i'm going to see if he figured it out for himself but i

02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:10.760
just want to say for those that aren't aware if you didn't hear last week's show um in a nutshell

02:11:10.760 --> 02:11:16.120
i'm cutting corners but this guy was worried that his playstation was failing and he was wondering

02:11:16.120 --> 02:11:21.080
should he buy a new playstation 3 like what should we what should he do and a lot of us were saying

02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:28.040
just call sony and see you know weigh your options if nothing else indeed indeed so next email from

02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:36.040
robert m addenda since my last email i did contact sony via live chat today sunday about 1 30 to 1 45

02:11:36.040 --> 02:11:40.280
pm the text says impression was that the battery on the motherboard depleting and he gave me the

02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:45.000
information setting up a repair ticket i may call the number later tonight or during the next work

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:49.320
week i'll let you know if i try it before the show thanks again robert m he must have tried

02:11:49.320 --> 02:11:54.520
it before the show because we have another email i feel like i'm reading somebody's live journal

02:11:55.560 --> 02:12:01.880
whelp dear live journal whelp phone support is not available on sunday and now about 6 pm

02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:09.160
my console is giving a 807 10092 error when i try to go online oh i just synced my trophies a few

02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:13.480
hours ago and everything else is getting wi-fi i wrote down all my info we'll try to call tomorrow

02:12:14.120 --> 02:12:19.240
um as for backing up your stuff i have no idea because i've never actually tried to copy any

02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:25.960
of my stuff off my ps3 yeah you can you just have a usb drive that's formatted fat32 yep answered

02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:32.600
so now i'm going to read an email that is not from robert m but good luck robert i'm sure uh

02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:37.000
hopefully we'll probably have another email if it's just like a battery like a bios battery that's

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:43.320
on going dead on i mean that would be fucking cheap you just have to rip your system apart but

02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:49.000
that would be fucking cheap to replace yeah so ready they'll charge you 200 for it yep

02:12:50.040 --> 02:12:56.120
hello olr my name is brice aka physics major which thank you for telling me how to pronounce

02:12:56.120 --> 02:13:01.240

02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:43.240
thank you very much for writing that email seriously because um without going into this

02:13:43.240 --> 02:13:48.520
too much i was having a bit of a rough week earlier this week and i got some kind of bad news

02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:52.600
midweek and it's kind of one of those things where it's like eh we'll probably get around it we'll

02:13:52.600 --> 02:13:57.960
get over it but it's it's one of those things where it was a hump and not a good kind yeah it

02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:03.880
was it was the not good kind of hump and sometimes you know there's a lot of i don't know i don't

02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:09.640
know how to phrase it but sometimes i feel like this show has been around for so long and yet

02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:13.960
for some people it's just not good enough what we're doing what we're doing is just not

02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:19.640
legitimate enough and i'm not sure what legitimate even is but apparently oh and i know what you're

02:14:19.640 --> 02:14:23.960
talking about on certain days of the week we're not it you know type of thing and it's just it

02:14:23.960 --> 02:14:27.960
depends what you're trying to do as far as legitimacy god it's so frustrating sometimes

02:14:27.960 --> 02:14:33.880
it's like you know i'm just trying to create a good show here but whatever and honestly like

02:14:33.880 --> 02:14:39.240
not even an hour after i was just kind of dealing with all those frustrations i peek in the mailbag

02:14:39.240 --> 02:14:43.080
just to get an idea of what's going to be coming for the show a little early and i actually saw

02:14:43.080 --> 02:14:49.400
your email and it was a really great reminder of like you know what to hell with everybody else

um seriously though just all of the this is just really another thing to add to the layers

02:18:30.360 --> 02:18:37.560
of bullshit going on in the world i just want to say just people for the few people of you who

02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:43.720
restore my faith in humanity on a daily basis by doing nice things by adopting puppies and kittens

02:18:43.720 --> 02:18:52.680
and you know leaving you know paying somebody's playing you know paying somebody's tab at dinner

02:18:52.680 --> 02:18:57.800
for a complete stranger doing nice things we need more of you people in the world and fewer of the

02:18:57.800 --> 02:19:03.240
assholes that are only looking to line their own pockets or looking out for number one if if i i

02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:12.040
encourage people this if you vote if you act in you know the public interest anything that you do

02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:17.800
every so often just look beyond yourself and ask yourself if someone else is going to benefit from

02:19:17.800 --> 02:19:25.480
it too that's all i ask and then actually benefit other people all right now loki um i guess just

02:19:26.280 --> 02:19:30.040
fb my cat you're not a programmer cat you don't know what the fuck you're doing

02:19:30.040 --> 02:19:31.080
so i'm messing with my shit

02:19:33.720 --> 02:19:39.480
minda does that too um especially when she tries to program with her ass i mean come on

02:19:39.480 --> 02:19:45.080
that takes talent you can't do that minda's trying to guide dan by headbutting his mouse hand

02:19:48.120 --> 02:19:51.240
uh the cat should just get together and see if they take over the world

02:19:52.040 --> 02:19:55.800
i i don't really have a good fu of the week i do have a lot of things i want to say i

02:19:55.800 --> 02:20:02.440
just don't want to say them publicly so i'll just say an fu to um fuckery that's i'm gonna

02:20:02.440 --> 02:20:09.160
just give a general fu to fuck fucking fuckery that's that's my fu of the week very creative no

02:20:09.960 --> 02:20:13.800
all right uh just a couple more stories for you guys then we'll get to the skype line at

02:20:13.800 --> 02:20:19.640
1877 game olr or a username on skype orange lounge radio but not yet we have a few more stories first

02:20:19.640 --> 02:20:28.600
all right so um xbox they've done pretty well i guess for uh the fourth quarter so it's kind

02:20:28.600 --> 02:20:35.800
of confusing so quarter two of their 2015 financial year uh which i guess just recently

02:20:35.800 --> 02:20:44.600
ended on december 31st they've um sold 6.6 million consoles during that time probably because they

02:20:44.600 --> 02:20:49.560
did that nice no price break and threw games in there that's how you do it you know and they'll

02:20:50.360 --> 02:20:56.360
because people didn't care about connect unfortunately um basically you know their comment

02:20:56.360 --> 02:21:02.920
was our sales engagement worldwide continues to focus on helping uh customers and partners

02:21:02.920 --> 02:21:07.240
transition to the cloud navigable i'm sorry i'm already losing interest in what this guy's saying

02:21:07.240 --> 02:21:13.080
so i'm going to stop there um and then of course you know not to be outdone by that

02:21:13.960 --> 02:21:22.680
uh 1.84 million new 3ds units have shipped in 2014 i'm assuming this is just the japan since

02:21:23.320 --> 02:21:29.880
obviously the new 3ds isn't out here yet um and the wii u is up to 9.2 million units

02:21:30.520 --> 02:21:36.440
so probably think well the new 3ds is because people need their new shit and well the wii u

02:21:36.440 --> 02:21:41.080
just because it's some really good first party software for this year so hopefully

02:21:41.160 --> 02:21:49.560
keep that momentum going but yeah all right we'll see uh i'm very curious to see what nintendo's

02:21:49.560 --> 02:21:54.360
e3 looks like that's for sure all i need to see is a new excite truck a new excite truck

02:21:54.360 --> 02:22:01.160
fuck this might be waiting a while exactly exactly if you gotta if i want to excite you know truck

02:22:01.160 --> 02:22:06.120
sequel i gotta make it myself all right well uh getting into one more story here and i felt this

02:22:06.120 --> 02:22:12.680
was a very good note to end on tonight and speaking about like family and listeners and

02:22:12.680 --> 02:22:17.400
you guys that motivate us to do great things every week some of you guys are out there doing great

02:22:17.400 --> 02:22:22.040
things in the gaming community and um i think this is really cool because uh this guy i don't

02:22:22.040 --> 02:22:26.600
know if this guy still listens to the show but i know he has in the past and you guys may not have

02:22:26.600 --> 02:22:31.320
actually known this if you've heard about this guy in the media but um he was somebody he follows me

02:22:31.320 --> 02:22:36.360
on twitter okay so i know he listened to olr at one point and i know you send emails and stuff so

02:22:36.360 --> 02:22:41.160
i know i've heard this guy before i don't know if he still listens but if you are still listening

02:22:41.160 --> 02:22:48.920
to the show kevin ddr a big congrats to you because i don't know if you know kevin ddr but

02:22:48.920 --> 02:22:53.320
even though ddr is in his name which of course we all love ddr kevin ddr is very famous now for

02:22:53.320 --> 02:22:57.640
tetris he does he was in the awesome games done quick and he did the whole tetris thing that was

02:22:57.640 --> 02:23:03.080
really blowing a lot of people away right well he was streaming on twitch and he actually reached

02:23:03.080 --> 02:23:10.440
a very very difficult to achieve grandmaster ranking in arika's tetris the grandmaster three

02:23:10.440 --> 02:23:16.200
this makes him the first player in north america to actually achieve this rank and because it was

02:23:16.200 --> 02:23:21.480
streaming when it was happened you can actually see a little stream of it online uh so in order

02:23:21.480 --> 02:23:27.000
to get the grandmaster promotional exam which yes this is all built into a tetris game here's what

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:32.760
you have to do you have to get a gm rank during the majority of your last several master mode

02:23:32.760 --> 02:23:37.960
playthroughs this means you have to have the maximum drop speed level by clearing several

02:23:37.960 --> 02:23:43.240
dozen lines in under seven minutes and then you have to play a minute's worth of tetris on a

02:23:43.240 --> 02:23:49.960
credit scroll with pieces that turn invisible while they are dropping apparently there's five

02:23:49.960 --> 02:23:56.360
people hidden yeah it's crazy there's five players in japan that have achieved this rank and now kevin

02:23:56.360 --> 02:24:02.200
ddr has uh done this in the us so congrats if you are out there somewhere listening or what have you

02:24:02.200 --> 02:24:08.280
um big congrats to you on that feed that's amazing and what's also amazing about this i've got to say

02:24:08.920 --> 02:24:15.560
is that between kevin's efforts at awesome games done quick and what he did this week on twitch

02:24:15.560 --> 02:24:22.120
more people are talking about this tetris the grandmaster game than are talking about ubisoft's

02:24:22.120 --> 02:24:29.000
buggy tetris game that was just released on playstation 4 like three weeks ago it seems like

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:34.840
i don't want to say no one curr but doesn't it seem like we're getting the less exciting version

02:24:34.840 --> 02:24:41.000
of tetris here what is what is what is up with that where you know we've got this exciting

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:46.040
competition going on over here yet the one they release here in the states is kind of it's it's

02:24:46.040 --> 02:24:51.320
got some frame skip going on it's not it's not because it's casuals over here it's dirty filthy

02:24:51.320 --> 02:25:01.480
casuals marissa congusto in chat says this sounds like tetris snm i i guess i don't know

02:25:02.360 --> 02:25:05.560
kevin will have to let us know if he's out there listening somewhere although he's probably a

02:25:05.560 --> 02:25:09.640
little busy playing tetris although i i would think he deserves a break at this point i don't

02:25:09.640 --> 02:25:16.040
know so there you go uh a good note to end on there uh something that uh people i remember

02:25:16.040 --> 02:25:20.440
listening to the show from a long time ago are out there doing it's fantastic uh we are going

02:25:20.440 --> 02:25:25.480
to open up the skype line you guys uh i gotta get on the right account though so while i open

02:25:25.480 --> 02:25:31.800
up the skype line over at 1877 game olr or a username on skype orange lounge radio uh

02:25:31.800 --> 02:25:35.320
loki do you happen to have any last minute stories for us tonight yeah as i alluded to

02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:40.200
earlier in the show when we were talking about nintendo and stuff like that and how you know

02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:47.800
people can abuse copyright claims tech lands who just released dying light is doing such a thing

02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:56.760
they are filing dmca claims against videos they're showing mods for the game and not even

02:25:56.760 --> 02:26:05.880
necessarily like cheating mods but like there was a mod for example that um what was it they had

02:26:05.880 --> 02:26:12.840
there was one it was just like a like a small it was like a one text file mod that they had

02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:18.840
um but basically yeah they're slapping claims against anybody that's putting up mods in the

02:26:18.840 --> 02:26:24.680
game they're saying because um you know it affects single player as well as multiplayer

02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:30.440
i don't know i think it's kind of lame well if it affects single player i mean

02:26:31.320 --> 02:26:37.400
well who cares about single player um you know because whatever well is it oh is it just if it's

02:26:37.480 --> 02:26:41.320
your own single player then but does it affect other people's single players

02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:47.080
no it's just i think your own single player game they're talking about gotcha i was trying to

02:26:47.080 --> 02:26:57.240
remember what it was that was they were modding it was um what was it here oh it was a mod to

02:26:57.240 --> 02:27:04.760
remove film grain from the game a film grain like filter that's on the actual thing so there was a

02:27:04.760 --> 02:27:13.640
mod to remove that and they were dmca you know it's so stupid that they would do that it's like

02:27:13.640 --> 02:27:20.920
who gives a shit it's fucking film green oh my god that ruined the game all right uh let's get

02:27:20.920 --> 02:27:25.560
to the phones we got somebody calling in here uh again 1877 game olr or username on skype

02:27:25.560 --> 02:27:28.600
orange launch radio but we do have a call on the line hi you're on orange launch radio who's this

02:27:29.320 --> 02:27:34.760
hi this is regina here hey regina what's on your mind uh not no not a whole lot uh

02:27:35.640 --> 02:27:41.560
uh one question and the one comment uh it serves uh the question since it's the

02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:49.240
quickest part of the call um do you know if uh the three of you or maybe even bob you

02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:57.160
are planning on really doing anything with uh uh bob's uh you know sting group uh like in terms of

02:27:57.160 --> 02:28:04.360
like doing like events or organized uh play gates or wherever you want to call them uh i know it's

02:28:04.360 --> 02:28:11.240
been a while since we uh anything has really been done with the group yeah you know the

02:28:11.240 --> 02:28:16.680
participation for those events wasn't as good as we had hoped it was uh very small for some of the

02:28:16.680 --> 02:28:21.640
outings that we did um but i think if we can get people enthusiastic about a certain game or

02:28:21.640 --> 02:28:26.360
something i think we're more than open to that idea um excited even and maybe we just have to

02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:30.120
mix it up a little bit i mean now especially in the day and age where you can do streaming

02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:35.240
maybe bobby or myself or jamie or hell anybody on the network with this capability there's no reason

02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:39.000
they can't do it it could even be you know somebody like brad or john from critical myth one of our

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:44.040
other shows um electric sisterhood loved it love to see them get involved too could be uh like

02:28:44.040 --> 02:28:49.960
streaming a game and then other vog people can actually like join in on that same game or

02:28:49.960 --> 02:28:53.720
something and and like maybe like do like a group live streaming event or something i think it might

02:28:53.720 --> 02:28:59.560
just be about doing something a little more to kind of stir up the interest i don't know plus

02:28:59.560 --> 02:29:05.400
it's also hard finding the right game because you have to find games that people own unless you can

02:29:05.400 --> 02:29:09.800
find just the right free to play game but then you know is it something that's going to be a big

02:29:09.800 --> 02:29:14.760
download what is that going to entail you know sometimes it's about finding that right game that's

02:29:14.760 --> 02:29:19.320
why it's good to do games that a lot of people have like i don't know minecraft a lot of people

02:29:19.320 --> 02:29:25.480
have that game um mario kart 8 uh did a little tournament on there it had pretty good participation

02:29:25.480 --> 02:29:31.160
so i think a lot of times just about finding that right mix so yeah i can definitely see the point

02:29:31.160 --> 02:29:38.120
now my original line of thought was you know i could be way off the mark here but you know if

02:29:38.120 --> 02:29:45.400
uh you know the vog administrators you know a group of administrators you know really you know

02:29:45.480 --> 02:29:51.000
for lack of a better term pick things up with the steam group and start organizing stuff

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:59.800
now maybe they would possibly draw new members into the group and then hopefully in turn draw

02:29:59.800 --> 02:30:09.400
traffic to the vog sites and i'm i'm lying about that you and bobby and walking dark sakura who

02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:16.040
would love to see uh new listeners know new registered members to the site so and so forth

02:30:16.040 --> 02:30:21.400
i'm i'm all for bringing more cool minded people you know people that will respect the number one

02:30:21.400 --> 02:30:26.840
rule is uh don't be a dick when you game online i'm all for bringing more people in that that uh

02:30:26.840 --> 02:30:30.920
like-minded people to do that so whatever we have to do to get visibility i'm i'm willing to try

02:30:30.920 --> 02:30:34.760
ideas you know if you don't try it you'll never know if something will work or not so i'm willing

02:30:34.760 --> 02:30:38.520
to i'm willing to give the vog game night another go so we'll uh we'll have to talk about that

02:30:38.520 --> 02:30:47.080
offline and and uh figure out a good good plan all right now um in regards to robert m's email

02:30:47.080 --> 02:30:55.000
um i heard that he posted a question i didn't hear the full question uh he asked about backing up

02:30:55.000 --> 02:31:00.600
stuff right yeah he wanted to see if you could actually back things up from the ps3 uh like

02:31:00.600 --> 02:31:05.240
your i guess your save data and things like that which you should be able to do to a uh correctly

02:31:05.240 --> 02:31:09.000
formatted hard drive because i've actually done that myself with uh one of my portable drives

02:31:09.800 --> 02:31:18.920
yeah yeah um i the only thing i ever really backed up personally was uh game saves you know you can

02:31:18.920 --> 02:31:23.960
back those up to the cloud or if you have like a external hard drive the flashlight you can back

02:31:23.960 --> 02:31:29.080
up your you saves that way oh i totally forgot that's right if this guy's a playstation plus he

02:31:29.080 --> 02:31:34.760
can uh he can back up all his game saves into the cloud really easy yeah the only ones that

02:31:34.760 --> 02:31:41.240
you're more or less forced to back up to the cloud as opposed to um a local drive would be

02:31:41.240 --> 02:31:46.440
the ones that are copy protected those ones you have to do on the cloud uh but the rest of them

02:31:46.440 --> 02:31:52.200
if you might have like a local copy copy of those you can put those on flash drive or whatever

02:31:52.200 --> 02:31:58.440
like uh loki mentioned you know to use the local driver you have to be you know for me

02:31:58.440 --> 02:32:03.800
in fact 32 right that's right but there's um there's more instructions online on how to do

02:32:03.800 --> 02:32:08.360
that but um definitely if you if this uh guy doesn't have playstation plus uh he should go

02:32:08.360 --> 02:32:13.720
get his free one from the lawsuit and uh he can back up that data into the cloud that would be a

02:32:13.720 --> 02:32:21.800
good idea so yeah and um just so that i don't necessarily hog up a whole lot of time not like

02:32:21.800 --> 02:32:29.720
tonight but in the future answering questions or whatnot but if robert um has any questions that

02:32:29.960 --> 02:32:36.840
he thinks i may be able to help him with he can easily contact me personally through skype uh

02:32:37.560 --> 02:32:43.640
my guys you know skype gave on their spazzing in towards yeah spazzing in their period psp

02:32:44.360 --> 02:32:51.480
um you know uh as long as i'm online you know he's more than welcome to call me and you know i

02:32:51.480 --> 02:32:58.600
ask ask way so there you go our our own as kuba jp in chat says our sony tech support reggie

02:33:00.280 --> 02:33:03.960
i think it's ragey i don't know anyway all right well spaz nator i'm gonna let you go okay

02:33:04.600 --> 02:33:10.600
sure sounds good all right my friend all right uh one eight seven seven game olr and you know

02:33:10.600 --> 02:33:16.760
again rage nators point spaz nators point spaz a rage nators point is uh show our vog group on

02:33:16.760 --> 02:33:21.400
steam a little love and uh i know all three of us are on it right i'm on it you're on it yeah but

02:33:21.400 --> 02:33:29.080
i don't play my scene but you're there so uh you can check that i actually i am on uh steam and uh

02:33:29.160 --> 02:33:33.560
i broadcast all my gameplay now here's the thing if you watch a steam broadcast of mine

02:33:33.560 --> 02:33:38.040
i don't commentate or do anything over it i just you can watch me playing the game but i don't do

02:33:38.040 --> 02:33:41.960
any commentary but if i'm on twitch then i'm usually doing commentary webcam and all that

02:33:41.960 --> 02:33:47.160
stuff but i like being able to peek at games just to see like what the games look like in motion

02:33:47.160 --> 02:33:50.520
because you know trailers only show you so much screenshots only show you so much but actually

02:33:50.520 --> 02:33:57.080
watching somebody kind of playing the game goes a long way a long way in my opinion one eight seven

02:33:57.080 --> 02:34:01.720
seven game olr username on skype orange lounge radio we're going to uh try to keep it open a

02:34:01.720 --> 02:34:06.120
little bit here to try and get some more calls um meanwhile loki any other last minute stories that

02:34:06.120 --> 02:34:14.440
you have um no no yeah unfortunately i don't have any extra stories all right well let me see if i

02:34:14.440 --> 02:34:19.160
can go over to twitter real quick here and read some tweets that we have we do have a tweet here

02:34:19.160 --> 02:34:25.720
from ssj100 matt who says i posted my write-up of magfest at the vog forums oh yes i was looking

02:34:25.720 --> 02:34:30.680
at that during the break between parts a and b tonight i saw your post over there so uh yeah

02:34:30.680 --> 02:34:34.840
you can check that out along with the go pro videos from the show you can actually watch

02:34:34.840 --> 02:34:39.640
his youtubes where he's walked around the show and it's almost like you're there except you're

02:34:39.640 --> 02:34:46.520
not there matt's there but you're with him except you have a fish eye view yes so you can check that

02:34:46.520 --> 02:34:51.000
out um i can't obviously give the full link it's a little lengthy but check that out at forums.vog

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:55.720
network.com matt made a little post there with some of his youtubes there just be careful if

02:34:55.720 --> 02:35:02.040
you shot any nintendo games might be you might be owing some money over to nintendo i'm just giving

02:35:02.040 --> 02:35:07.720
you crap i'm just giving you crap um let's see uh i don't really see a lot of other tweets besides

02:35:07.720 --> 02:35:14.280
that at least that came in today sometimes we get tagged in in posts that are unrelated here

02:35:14.280 --> 02:35:19.080
i was getting a few tweets about rockage as kind of like a follow-up to last week's interview

02:35:19.080 --> 02:35:22.680
and some of the bands actually reached out to say hello which i thought was really cool

02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:26.440
and so some folks were asking like you know are you going to be at rockage did you figure that out

02:35:26.440 --> 02:35:30.760
so yes if you were listening to last week's show and you heard our interview all about rockage

02:35:30.760 --> 02:35:36.680
san jose i will be there for sure saturday for sure i can't be there sunday because i got to get

02:35:36.680 --> 02:35:42.440
back and do olr right guys so i'm going to be here back here on sunday i'm trying right now to see if

02:35:42.440 --> 02:35:46.920
i can find a place to stay in the bay area if i have a friend over there that might let me crash

02:35:46.920 --> 02:35:52.440
with them so i could stay friday night um so that way because i'm too cheap for a hotel and that way

02:35:52.440 --> 02:35:56.600
i can drive down and maybe get a little bit of the concert friday night after work uh we'll see what

02:35:56.600 --> 02:36:00.200
happens all right well we do have the phones lighting up with some more calls wow all of a

02:36:00.200 --> 02:36:03.400
sudden lit up with some more calls let's get to it hi you're on orange launch radio who's this

02:36:03.400 --> 02:36:08.280
it's shane hey shane i haven't heard from you in a while what's up well you guys sound bored so i

02:36:08.280 --> 02:36:14.600
thought i'd give you a call what are you bored too yes i'm super bored hey we're all bored why

02:36:14.600 --> 02:36:19.720
don't we talk about the weather it's dark out there's no weather that i can see but it might

02:36:19.720 --> 02:36:24.760
be foggy though so that's awesome it might be what do you think of the uh x right power ranger

02:36:25.560 --> 02:36:32.920
stabbing oh why you gotta why you gotta go to a downer um i don't have like a real opinion on it

02:36:32.920 --> 02:36:40.200
because it sounds like it may be self-defense and that's fine i'm more like kind of laughing about

02:36:40.200 --> 02:36:46.040
how all these outlets that i keep reading the story on make up the most random stories about

02:36:46.040 --> 02:36:51.640
him like apparently he was the red ranger in the animated samurai power rangers which

02:36:51.640 --> 02:36:59.000
there wasn't an animated samurai power ranger uh season and so that's funny and then one person

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:04.360
or not one person one site linked to him and showed him as the red samurai ranger and then

02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:09.080
put a clip of him up and it didn't even have him in it it had the red samurai ranger which he was

02:37:09.080 --> 02:37:17.240
not so i don't know i think he is innocent proven guilty so we'll see i am so lost right now and

02:37:17.240 --> 02:37:21.000
all this power ranger stuff you're talking about i wish we could just talk about the new american

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:26.280
one because it's so good i've watched it six times now since it debuted this yeah but this is you

02:37:26.280 --> 02:37:31.320
you have to send that my way because i won't so i'll know what you're talking about because i

02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:35.960
talk about it a lot all the time this is also you that we're talking about so you're biased

02:37:35.960 --> 02:37:40.200
inherently no they told me the story and it sounded like it's pretty cool because it had

02:37:40.200 --> 02:37:44.920
dinosaurs and shit all right well it is a video game show are there any video games you've been

02:37:44.920 --> 02:37:50.520
playing lately shane um i've been playing gravely default a lot lately um and i feel bad because

02:37:50.520 --> 02:37:55.800
it didn't make like my top three list or whatever um of last year and that game came out last year

02:37:55.800 --> 02:38:01.000
but i never beat it and now that i've picked it back up again um it's really really good i'm

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:07.640
loving it i'm sad that i somehow just kind of skipped over it and let it go to uh you know

02:38:08.680 --> 02:38:13.880
video game like i don't know what do you want to call like crematorium or something because

02:38:13.880 --> 02:38:18.680
it just sits over there waiting to die what burned what got you in the mood to play go

02:38:18.680 --> 02:38:27.240
back and visit bravely default um fancy explorers oh oh actually um since you brought that up uh

02:38:27.240 --> 02:38:30.920
you know last week i talked about my thoughts you know you were good enough to bring your new three

02:38:31.400 --> 02:38:36.760
that you bought you bought a japanese new 3ds and you brought it over so i could check it out

02:38:36.760 --> 02:38:40.920
so i talked about my own thoughts last week but we didn't really get your thoughts um first off

02:38:40.920 --> 02:38:50.040
why did you decide to import a japanese new 3ds so one reason let's go with the let's go with the uh

02:38:50.040 --> 02:38:56.600
doesn't make me sound incredibly crazy reason um they announced in the last nintendo direct

02:38:56.600 --> 02:39:04.280
a new rhythm heaven game for japan nothing for us and i've been wanting to play final fantasy

02:39:04.280 --> 02:39:10.600
explorers as well so i figured that was a good enough reason those two reasons together good

02:39:10.600 --> 02:39:16.360
enough and there's always like japanese games i want to play that i you know either don't get a

02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:20.760
chance to or by the time they come out here i already forgot about them so because i have like

02:39:20.760 --> 02:39:27.960
a really really short attention span um the bigger reason is probably because they did not bring out

02:39:27.960 --> 02:39:33.800
or they are not bringing out the system in blue so i was able to get it in blue i knew i knew when

02:39:33.800 --> 02:39:37.800
you said there was a crazy reason i was like it's because he got a blue one they don't have one yes

02:39:37.800 --> 02:39:42.600
it's a very pretty blue so i'm okay with it what's like the color of my car it's a very nice blue

02:39:42.600 --> 02:39:49.240
what if they announce at e3 that there will be a blue 3ds in the holidays oh well i already got

02:39:49.240 --> 02:39:53.800
one i don't need a different well unless it's a different shade so considering that most people

02:39:53.800 --> 02:39:57.640
haven't paid the premium to import a system from japan so most people haven't got their hands on it

02:39:57.640 --> 02:40:03.160
yet oh and it's not also i've had japanese systems before so this is like nothing incredibly new for

02:40:03.160 --> 02:40:08.200
me what are what should people know about the new 3ds is it worth it what are your thoughts on it

02:40:08.200 --> 02:40:14.280
i think it's worth it i think it feels sturdier i love the head tracking um the little nub of a

02:40:14.280 --> 02:40:19.720
c-stick is great i think it's really comfortable that i didn't like that at all yeah you're weird

02:40:19.720 --> 02:40:26.280
um the shoulder buttons having four there is kind of cool too i don't find it cumbersome to pick

02:40:26.280 --> 02:40:31.480
you know like put my fingers on there and find the right shoulder buttons um i think it's just

02:40:31.480 --> 02:40:39.160
a nicer system that is the system yeah and the japanese one i never realized how much we were

02:40:39.160 --> 02:40:45.960
missing out on like the e-shop until i got this system it's not even it's not even fair like it's

02:40:45.960 --> 02:40:50.840
night and day they have so many good things on their e-shop i'm i'm a little jealous in that

02:40:50.840 --> 02:40:55.800
regard but i still i don't know i kind of don't think the new 3ds is really worth it if you just

02:40:55.800 --> 02:41:00.680
bought a 3ds but maybe you know if you've been holding out or whatever and you're still rocking

02:41:00.680 --> 02:41:05.960
a regular ds or a dsi or something maybe now's the time to upgrade the new 3ds is definitely a

02:41:05.960 --> 02:41:11.640
good replacement for that but yeah if you got one like over the holidays um i wouldn't say probably

02:41:11.640 --> 02:41:16.840
you need to upgrade until a game comes out that says oh you can't use it on your 3ds you have to

02:41:16.840 --> 02:41:20.600
have the new 3ds just waiting for that real quick before i let you go what did you think i don't

02:41:20.600 --> 02:41:25.640
know if you heard the story earlier about the rumor that the video encryption technology in

02:41:25.640 --> 02:41:32.360
the new 3ds is the same as what the wii u uses to stream to the wii u gamepad so folks are speculating

02:41:32.360 --> 02:41:36.840
that the new 3ds will in fact be able to serve at some point as a wii u gamepad what do you

02:41:36.840 --> 02:41:45.000
think of that um that makes sense to me i mean it's got the nfc chip inside too which you know

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:52.840
for those stupid stupid amiibos um they do that on the wii u controller as well so it i thought

02:41:52.840 --> 02:41:58.040
it was going to happen earlier than this but yeah it's totally gonna work with the wii u i don't see

02:41:58.040 --> 02:42:03.560
it not working with the wii u not a fan of the amiibo huh no i want like four of them but they're

02:42:03.560 --> 02:42:09.560
all two of them wait one of them is out now another one comes out like in a few weeks the

02:42:09.560 --> 02:42:15.160
one that's out now is chic and i really would like that but i'm not waking up at four in the morning

02:42:15.160 --> 02:42:19.800
the morning of to wait for a store to open i'd rather do that for something i care about more

02:42:19.800 --> 02:42:24.600
yeah not some little dumb toy i'm not getting back into something like skylanders and that's

02:42:24.600 --> 02:42:30.040
all this is but somehow worse all right well shane i should let you go so we can try to take

02:42:30.040 --> 02:42:34.600
a few more calls but thanks for calling in no problem goodbye hope you're less bored now nope

02:43:24.440 --> 02:43:28.840
to go out for cheesecake they have low carb cheesecake oh my god it's amazing low carb beans

even get away with talking about the super bowl on the show and we wouldn't care gasp

02:44:07.480 --> 02:44:13.400
okay but i still say that one of these days we're gonna have to do a spin-off on the voice

02:44:13.400 --> 02:44:18.360
of games network to have robin morris's giggle time yes let's do it it's the voice it's the

02:44:18.360 --> 02:44:22.920
voice of geeks network but that's okay the voice of giggling i'm sorry i bring my damage i'm

02:44:22.920 --> 02:44:27.000
actually blonde don't tell anybody that's all right that's right well you know it was it

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:30.520
originally well i i don't know how far it was i think some people know this by now i think it's

02:44:30.520 --> 02:44:34.680
because originally it was going to be the voice of games network so you might have heard about it

02:44:34.680 --> 02:44:39.880
when we were first planning it but then we we thought that wasn't inclusive enough of

02:44:39.880 --> 02:44:44.840
all the shows we wanted to represent so we we expanded a little so there you go the definition

02:44:44.840 --> 02:44:48.280
of vog changed before it launched i didn't remember that conversation a long time ago

02:44:48.280 --> 02:44:55.400
but i'm also just blonde but thank you for trying to bail me out i really appreciate it i fucking

02:44:55.400 --> 02:45:04.360
tried marissa i did for you i'm only here so i won't get fined well uh i'm sorry about uh

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:09.400
you know a backstory i tried to get a guest on but they had a tragedy but if you're interested

02:45:09.400 --> 02:45:14.760
i know we've gone back and forth but i got my vo friends and i know they would love to call in

02:45:14.760 --> 02:45:18.760
if you're interested and i can uh i know we've talked back and forth about it casually but if

02:45:18.760 --> 02:45:22.760
you're interested i'd be happy to have a whole bunch of fun people call in i think the listeners

02:45:22.760 --> 02:45:27.000
would love to hear from some more people in the vo especially um you know some of the the favorite

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:31.640
voices from some of the video games they play or i find i here's the thing with voice actors that

02:45:31.640 --> 02:45:37.800
i think people like fucking love to find out is that you know obviously the voice actors that are

02:45:37.800 --> 02:45:44.040
out there take on a lot of different projects so to find out that like somebody who did this voice

02:45:44.040 --> 02:45:51.000
in this game is also this voice or this cartoon character from some beloved 80s or 90s cartoon

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:55.720
is like a total trip i think i think people love to like see those connections at least i

02:45:55.720 --> 02:46:02.280
do right maybe it is it is an amazingly um small world like um trying to give an example of one of

02:46:02.280 --> 02:46:07.160
my friends it's kind of obscure but in dishonored one of the uh you know the the background i forget

02:46:07.160 --> 02:46:13.000
the term for it um on the uh the propaganda that you hear that's guy named greg burger

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:17.080
he's also eeyore and orson on garfield and friends who you're talking about yeah the

02:46:17.080 --> 02:46:21.400
phone always surprises me is on the flip side like he was one of the raid ants you know right

02:46:21.400 --> 02:46:27.240
like you know or rob paulson everybody knows who he is you find out what they've done commercials

02:46:27.240 --> 02:46:32.520
he's your friendly hannah dealer you know so that's always it really surprises me because

02:46:32.520 --> 02:46:37.000
you can see people and then like you know like i have an ear for jim cummings chris was playing um

02:46:37.880 --> 02:46:41.720
at any any video game like i'll even like be listening to music and i go jim cummings

02:46:42.280 --> 02:46:48.760
but uh um but when you hear the like the the voices that ambient stuff you just hear every

02:46:48.760 --> 02:46:53.160
day too that can always be really shocking and they're all on screen all the time so they're

02:46:53.160 --> 02:47:00.120
always really happy to talk to people no my gosh i just well i mean hell we talk to gamers we talk

02:47:00.120 --> 02:47:05.640
i mean as long as people have some type of passion for video games whether it be the part of creating

02:47:05.640 --> 02:47:09.400
them or the part of playing them you know it's a show where every gamer has a voice so i think we

02:47:09.480 --> 02:47:13.560
want to i think we want to hear from lots of voice actors who help make those games um i know we're

02:47:13.560 --> 02:47:17.560
going to be probably getting some bands on thanks to some of the connections i'm hopefully making

02:47:17.560 --> 02:47:21.560
next week and you know some of the other stuff we've got brewing behind the scenes i i am all

02:47:21.560 --> 02:47:26.280
for more interviews and talking to more people i think you guys like hearing them yeah yeah i

02:47:26.280 --> 02:47:29.720
think you guys like hearing the interviews so i have a friend too that can also talk about he

02:47:29.720 --> 02:47:37.000
does a lot of mocap and so that means that you're no longer allowed to be ugly so i'm like oh i

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:41.960
don't have a figure of a supermodel now this mocap stuff shit well now a lot a lot of that

02:47:41.960 --> 02:47:47.400
mocap stuff is like you wear that skin tight suit that has all the balls on it and the the mocap

02:47:47.400 --> 02:47:53.960
stuff captures the balls but that's what it does yeah that's what he does yeah yeah i was having

02:47:53.960 --> 02:47:59.480
a friend tell me about uh some some people that he knew that were mocapped for a sports game

02:47:59.480 --> 02:48:03.400
uh for some of the not not one of the athletes but some of the background people and that was

02:48:03.480 --> 02:48:08.520
the whole process that went through kind of neat so yeah it is crazy to watch the behind the scenes

02:48:08.520 --> 02:48:13.960
of that all right well marissa um i look forward to trying to get some some peeps from your

02:48:13.960 --> 02:48:18.120

a voice we always appreciate that uh logie you have another thing to get out there before we

02:50:58.600 --> 02:51:02.680
sign off for the night i want to buy this what is it what are you looking at they don't sell this

02:51:02.680 --> 02:51:11.400
though it's the shield helicarrier in legos oh god but it's huge my son would love that thing

02:51:12.280 --> 02:51:17.400
he would eat that up i need to get more lego stuff i keep saying that i want to build like

02:51:17.400 --> 02:51:21.560
eight bit characters out of legos because it's not that hard we have an extra delorean i think

02:51:21.560 --> 02:51:26.360
do you really yeah dan would probably sell it to you for i'd recommend checking out there by my

02:51:26.360 --> 02:51:31.160
house there's a lego a store that sells lego stuff it's a lego shop and they sell bricks like an

02:51:31.160 --> 02:51:37.320
official one no oh it's like just some guy's shop that's pretty good the official one is is

02:51:37.320 --> 02:51:41.560
expensive so if i can get like secondhand legos that would be awesome i know you can like order

02:51:41.560 --> 02:51:46.760
the custom stuff online like you can build the lego and then have them ship you whatever legos

02:51:46.760 --> 02:51:51.240
it is to build your virtual creation that would be only super expensive yeah i know right ten

02:51:51.240 --> 02:51:56.600
gallons of legos at my house yeah all right uh anyway i guess it's gonna do it for another

02:51:56.600 --> 02:52:01.960
episode of orange lounge radio so uh before we wrap oh they are selling it's gonna be 350

02:52:01.960 --> 02:52:07.880
not buying it but holy crap does that look awesome i i think i might have to invest not

02:52:07.880 --> 02:52:13.800
really because we have we have an ecto one and we have the delorean and i think the next one's

02:52:13.800 --> 02:52:21.000
supposed to be like they're petitioning for it to be uh oh god oh the turtles van is what they

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:27.640
wanted to do right so i want them to do a tardis but we'll see all right well uh we are gonna wrap
