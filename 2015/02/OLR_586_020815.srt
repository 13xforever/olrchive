00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,240
This week, after AOL's closure of various blogs, some have turned to crowdfunding in

2
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,820
order to continue the coverage their readers enjoyed and found success in doing so.

3
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,680
The resurgence of fan favorites occurs big and small in this week's news, and we'll

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:30,680
tell you all about it right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,880
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:42,240
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this February 8, 2015

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,560
with the 586th episode of our show. Here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,360
the gamer lifestyle are myself, Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Skie on Twitter and

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,440
in the intro there, and joining me on this 3 hour tour are my lovely co-hosts, say hello

10
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:05,240
to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers. Hi. Hi, how are you, Ms. Jamie Summers? Meat. Meat. Are

11
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:10,760
you going to give me one word answers all night long? Maybe. What kind of meat are we

12
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,460
talking about? We're talking about like meat on a pizza, meat in a salad, meat... I had

13
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:22,720
chopped up hamburger, and then a bratwurst, half a bratwurst, all covered in cheese, and

14
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:28,400
it was gloriously greasy, and delicious. That sounds like an epic fart waiting to happen.

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:39,400
I'm a lady. I just belch. Also, yeah. Alright, also joining us, say yeah to Techmaster Loki.

16
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:45,280
Yeah. Yeah. How are you doing, Loki? I'm doing fine. Yeah, you seem very chipper. It's because

17
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,960
of that sandwich you ate. You went to your favorite sandwich shop again. Yes. You're

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,360
doing that thing I talked about last week where you find that new food you love. Really,

19
00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:00,400
I just wanted to try the meatball sub, and it was so worth it. But yes. Yes. But mainly,

20
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,880
I was just excited because, and I'll get into this later when I get into my game week, because

21
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:13,160
I have rank bacon. That's right, rank bacon. Oh, look at you. You've really got a... Wow,

22
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:19,960
your game is really coming along. Okay. Fuck stars, or whatever other trophies you want.

23
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,820
That's right. That's spinning bacon right there. Okay, so you have spinning bacon instead

24
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,840
of stars for your racing game on how you ranked in a particular level. Yes. Wow, your game

25
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:35,320
is looking pretty rad, I gotta say. Alright, look at you. Anyways. When are we gonna get

26
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,040
a demo? When do I get to play it? When do I get to play it? Soon. I'm just working on

27
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,600
finishing the finish sequencing where it shows, there's a whole, I gotta show you during break

28
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,320
and stuff, there's a whole explosion and stuff like that. And it actually does calculate

29
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,320
your time now and compares it to a record time and eventually a world record time, which

30
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,320
will be the online leaderboards. Online leader? What the hell? You're making like a full-fledged

31
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:08,320
PS4 game over here. This is crazy. Yes, but I have to think, was it one of, well the person

32
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,400
I'm using the assets from, you know, Raccoon Media, they're the ones that do all the low

33
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,360
poly track stuff that I've been using. I put it out on Twitter, I was like, I gotta find,

34
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:25,360
you know, bacon that's low poly that kind of looks like this guy's stuff. And then he's

35
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,600
like, you mean like this? And he whipped something together real quick. I'm like, that's so awesome.

36
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,400
So yeah. Wait, so these guys Raccoon Media, you said? Yeah, Raccoon. They make stuff and

37
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,760
you're allowed to just take it? They make all the art and you take it for your game?

38
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:45,120
No, they make art assets. He sells stuff on the asset store. And so he's got like a, you

39
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,440
know, one set of assets on the asset store. He also releases a lot of stuff for free.

40
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,360
He kind of started off of, there's this guy, Kenny, Assets Jesus, as you know, they like

41
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,600
to call him. He does a bunch of, you know, free assets that are out there for people

42
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:06,360
to use. And his is all CC zero. See, I forgot, I haven't used Unity enough still cause you

43
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,920
know, my game is never moving along here cause I get distracted with all this other stuff.

44
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,480
But I forgot that there's that asset store within Unity. So it's kind of like you have

45
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:19,000
like a, for lack of a better term, iTunes or Google play within Unity where you can

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,400
buy these things that you use in your game. Or even free stuff. There's free stuff out

47
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,520
there too. But like I went ahead, I support him because I purchased his set, but he also

48
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,560
has like a bunch of other ones, like five other ones that are free currently. And he

49
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,040
keeps releasing more stuff for him.

50
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,400
You basically got frequent customer bacon.

51
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,640
Exactly. It's awesome. But I was literally putting something, so I've made my own stuff

52
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,480
for my, I've made my own stuff for my game in the same style as his and it actually looks

53
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:52,920
pretty cool. But, um, you know, I was actually starting to make bacon. It just kind of, it

54
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,440
is similar, but his looks so much better than what I was putting together and it was just

55
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,840
awesome. So he just knows how to build a better bacon.

56
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,960
He just, he's just better at Blender. See, cause I, I tried to learn Blender. I watched

57
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,000
videos on how to learn Blender. I actually did 3D Studio Max for a while and went through

58
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,920
like a whole online course on that stuff. And I had it down a little bit, but then my

59
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,000
computer crashed and so I lost 3D Studio Max. But I tried going back in the Blender again

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,960
and I just, I get lost. I don't know. I just, it's one of those things right now. I'm, I'm

61
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,320
going the, I'm, I'm kind of going through the steps like I did before where I try to

62
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,360
find a way around what I want to do, but really I ended up having to go back and actually

63
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,800
learn how to do it the correct way. So now I'm still in that work around phase where

64
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,120
I'm doing everything in SketchUp, which is Google's free program. And, um, it works well

65
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,680
for me, especially for low poly stuff. Cause it's just, you know, I know how many inches

66
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:54,620
each one of those cubes are in their space and then I can make, um, stuff that's to scale

67
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,560
for that and it works out perfect. But, uh, yeah, it's so much easier when you have someone,

68
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,000
you know, designing something that looks pretty awesome. So, uh, but yeah, he should be, he's

69
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,240
supposed to be releasing, just told me, uh, over Twitter that he's releasing his car assets

70
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,280
pack and his city pack soon, which I've been looking forward to cause it's pretty awesome

71
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,360
looking. But yeah, so check it out. Glad to hear things are moving along with your game.

72
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,920
Uh, I want to introduce our chat room because we always have the live chatters here with

73
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,920
our program. Uh, we are the show where every gamer has a voice and you can lend your voice

74
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,160
alive at Sunday nights at the voice of geeks network of vog network.com because that is

75
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,440
where we tape the show at the voice geeks network every Sunday night at six o'clock

76
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,200
Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And if you are listening

77
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:40,320
live, we have a chat room at live dot vog network.com. Uh, and Bobby Black Wolf says,

78
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,960
I want to have the hashtag vog jam to start before Loki finishes his hashtag vog jam one

79
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,080
game. And then maybe I already started a new it's vog jam belated. So it makes a little

80
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,480
dig at me saying, when do you get to play any of the vog jam games? Yeah. See, here's

81
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,600
the thing I, and I, I'm still holding to it. I will not participate. I will not endorse,

82
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,480
participate, uh, rally up a second jam until I completely finished the first one. And yeah,

83
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,480
it may take a while, but, uh, I've got a lot, you know, some of you guys that know me outside

84
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,060
shows, I got a lot going on in my personal life right now, especially with my day job

85
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,520
and some things happening there. So it's just kind of push some things back. Sadly, I'm

86
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,600
not always, I know this is going to sound horrible, but I'm not always like in the mood

87
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,480
to do a peppy YouTube when I get home from work. I'm with, I'm with you there cause like

88
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,880
I was going to work on the game last night and instead I got distracted by, what was

89
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:34,240
it that, um, the what's wrong with blah, blah, blah movies or whatever. I watched like about,

90
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,080
I don't know, a dozen of those and they're about like 20 minutes long each. I was like,

91
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,240
Oh damn, it's like mid 1230 at night and I've done nothing. I'm so tired. And I want

92
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,000
to make sure your games get me in a good mood cause you guys' games deserve that. And I'm

93
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,280
in a good mood now. I had a great day yesterday and I'll talk about that a little while during

94
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,600
our gaming weeks and so on. But I want to get into tonight's show and some of the video

95
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,080
gaming news that's going on out there in the world. Um, let's start off with tonight's

96
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,840
kickoff topic and tonight's kickoff topic is something that really everybody's been

97
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:08,000
talking about out there on Twitter and Facebook and all the social media. This story is spread

98
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,120
like wildfire, which is interesting because the story is a big fat rumor. But when the

99
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,480
rumor is reported by the wall street journal, well, it's not like this is something coming

100
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:24,160
from a gaming blog we've never heard of or something trashy filthy like Perez Hilton

101
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,600
or TMZ or something, which are both Hollywood sites, but still, uh, this is still coming

102
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,600
from the wall street journal, which is something a little bit bigger. And they have a run a

103
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,760
report where the legend of Zelda, only one of the most popular video game series of all

104
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:45,080
time, uh, is in the works to become a television show at Netflix, which I I'm sure a lot of

105
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,960
you have had to process that information at some point this week. If you haven't until

106
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:54,440
now take a minute to kind of go, wow, I, um, I would have never guessed that that was going

107
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,440
to be a pairing that happened. Um, so the video streaming service right now, they are

108
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,280
in early stages, whatever that means. I don't know if that's, you know, they're putting

109
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,520
together a pilot, a pitch, who knows what that is, uh, of developing this live action

110
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:13,360
series that will be based on the legend of Zelda. Uh, they're describing it as a game

111
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:20,200
of Thrones for a family audience. So they're looking for writers right now to work on this

112
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:27,440
show, uh, which will be set in Hyrule as assumably. Um, I, the report says that Zelda's about

113
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,680
a boy named link who has to rescue press princess Zelda. I think that is actually a leap to

114
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,960
assume that the show would even necessarily have link and Zelda in it. Hear me out here

115
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:43,620
for a minute. Um, but anyhow, moving on with the story. Um, these, uh, Zelda games of course

116
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,640
have the sword and sorcery like something like game of Thrones, like Lord of the rings.

117
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,960
Uh, but this could be something that they could gear towards the whole family. Uh, Netflix

118
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,460
reportedly is working closely with Nintendo. Um, and of course, legend of Zelda originally

119
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:02,620
premiered in 1987, but we all know there was the animated Zelda that ran on Fridays

120
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:07,180
during the Super Mario Brothers Super Show. We all know about the 93 Nintendo Super Mario

121
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:12,200
Brothers movie, which has made Nintendo very wary to work with anybody else. Uh, so we

122
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,280
don't know what's going on with this because of course Netflix isn't confirming it and

123
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:21,900
Nintendo will not comment on rumors or speculation. So for all we know, this could be something

124
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:28,900
where Netflix wants to do this and is readying the pitch for Nintendo, but isn't even there

125
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:33,940
yet. I mean, we just don't know where this is at. So it is way too soon to talk about

126
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:38,340
who are they going to cast as link? Who are they going to cast as Zelda? Is Loki going

127
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:44,180
to be tingle? Like we keep, did you like that Twitter campaign I started by the way? Yeah,

128
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,420
if it pays, well fine, I'll do it. I like that. That's a change of heart. Hey, it's

129
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:57,300
money, whatever, money and whatever. I'm fine. So I'll don the spandex for that. Yeah,

130
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:02,840
I don't know what's going to happen with this if it's even really something real, but certainly

131
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,520
a lot of people are talking about it. And with the Wall Street Journal running it, I

132
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:11,840
think this at least confirms it sounds like their source is inside Netflix. So it sounds

133
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:17,100
like Netflix is definitely plotting something, but I mean that could even be something that's

134
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:22,520
inspired by Zelda, but isn't necessarily going to be using the Zelda IP. I mean, there's

135
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:29,500
just a lot of ideas on what this could really be. I just, I have a lot of questions about

136
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:35,300
this. Now, assuming that Nintendo and Netflix have reached an arrangement, that just starts

137
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:41,220
this whole other line of thought like, A, how on earth did Netflix convince Nintendo

138
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,400
to let them do this? I mean, this is so huge. And you know, Nintendo's been burned with

139
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,260
some of this stuff in the past. I mean, and we see Jason in the chat, VXX Jason XV over

140
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,840
at live.vognetwork.com says, was the Mario movie explicitly stated as a source of strife

141
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:01,520
like that? It has in the past, Jason, yes. And Jason says, and not the CDI Nintendo stuff.

142
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:07,000
That has two actually, but I think more people know the movie than know the CDI games. So

143
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,620
when the Wall Street Journal, which is more mainstream thing, runs it. That was just a,

144
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,120
there was a lot of bad movies in that time. And just because it happened to be a Mario

145
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,800
movie doesn't mean it was bad because it was, it was bad because it was in that time frame

146
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:26,400
where there's a lot of bad cheesy movies that came out. Sure. And I, I kind of go, it's

147
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:31,880
still interesting to me that Nintendo would be working with an American company like that,

148
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:37,240
Netflix, like what, what is this arrangement entail? And I'm going to get super tinfoil

149
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,360
hatty here, but this is what we do sometimes is we, you know, kind of make predictions

150
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,600
and try to figure out where things could be going. I mean, where Netflix does make a lot

151
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,880
of sense. Netflix is a power player in why people buy these gaming consoles in the first

152
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,600
place because gaming consoles are not necessarily gaming consoles anymore. They're living room

153
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:04,680
box entertainment devices. I mean, why is that? Because I think they should just be

154
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,440
gaming consoles, but shaking my fist to cloud. Oh, that's just, but that's, that's where

155
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,720
we're at now. I mean, more people watch Netflix on the, I have no problem with getting more

156
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:19,040
value out of my purchase. That's just me. I don't, I don't hate the fact that game consoles

157
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,200
want to be more and I get why they want to do it, but certainly I don't want them to

158
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,280
ever lose sight of the games. And I think maybe that would be the concern why you don't

159
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:33,360
want them to dip in all this other stuff. But anyway, I digress. Um, so it kind of makes

160
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,560
me wonder, could there be some really weird arrangement where Netflix is doing this for

161
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:45,560
Nintendo because Nintendo is going to get something out of Netflix that could possibly

162
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:55,080
make the Wii U, the 3DS or the Wii U's successor, the must have entertainment box the way the

163
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,160
Wii was. Now note, I don't think for a minute this means that Netflix would like disappear

164
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,280
from PlayStation or Xbox. That's not what I think at all. That would just be shooting

165
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:10,480
themselves in the foot. But could the next evolution of Netflix be something that's a

166
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,960
little more unique to the Wii U's successor? No. Could this be the beginning of a partnership?

167
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,640
I don't think so. You think I'm being too tinfoil hat? Why? Why? Cause I think they're

168
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,320
just licensing their property. They have it being made into a show. I think it's more

169
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,260
beneficial for Netflix to have something to compete with game of Thrones than it is for

170
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:35,020
Nintendo to have a show for Zelda. Netflix jumping on this, I'm not questioning at all.

171
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:40,400
They'd be stupid not to. Nintendo jumping in on this is where I have all the questions.

172
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,720
That's the part that doesn't make sense. What does Nintendo have to gain from this? They

173
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:52,380
make money in licensing. Because if it blows up like Game of Thrones did, they could make

174
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:58,740
a ton of money on that. I think that's what they want to do. They want to make as little

175
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:05,560
effort to make money as possible. Let's see. Bobby Blackwolf points out Sky. 3DS Netflix

176
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:14,540
gets 3D movies. I actually forgot about that. 3D, supposedly, is on its way out. I shouldn't

177
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:20,460
say that to the man who loves the Oculus Rift. It's not on its way out. It's just gonna be

178
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:26,860
dormant for a while until VR and that kind of stuff takes over. Basically, you're gonna

179
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:34,660
have that kind of content when that stuff is more popular and mainstream, I think. Asking

180
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:39,020
someone to buy a 3D TV is kind of ridiculous. Bobby was throwing that out there as a possibility.

181
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,460
Not something where they don't have 3D movies yet. Just that that's a possibility of something

182
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:46,860
that could happen. Saying, we'll get 3D movies on the 3DS client if we can get a TV show

183
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:56,540
from you. This is where my head was going. There's a really underutilized feature on

184
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,420
the Wii U that I bet half the owners out there don't even remember that this is a thing on

185
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:05,380
their Wii U. There's a feature called TV where that Wii U gamepad will function as a remote

186
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:12,540
control for your TV. Big deal, right? But then you can also, with big epic TV shows

187
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:19,180
and sports games, you can do a special Miiverse chatroom type thing that allows you to have

188
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:23,460
TV watching be a little bit more of a social experience. For whatever reason, Nintendo

189
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:29,180
doesn't really hype this up or promote it. But I was thinking, a lot of people were upset

190
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:34,380
when they removed the party feature from Netflix on the Xbox 360. I don't know if that was

191
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:39,780
a licensing thing or what this thing could be. But maybe, especially now that Netflix

192
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:44,500
is dabbling in all their own original series, especially one that could be based around

193
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:49,780
The Legend of Zelda, could there be a social watching experience? Could parties be coming

194
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,340
back to an Nintendo platform is what I'm saying.

195
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:56,140
I just don't see that as, I mean, it's cool. It's a neat feature and a plus, but it's not

196
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,820
a plus. It's like, oh my God, I have to buy that console. That's the thing is I just don't

197
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:07,300
see what they could possibly do that would make me have to buy this console because X

198
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:13,340
features on there from Netflix. It just doesn't make any sense to me. I think it's more making

199
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:20,300
money from licensing this property and having Netflix run with it and make it into something

200
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:25,340
that's really good. And it's a plus for Netflix because they have something that competes

201
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,340
with all the people that want to watch Game of Thrones and have HBO.

202
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,840
You might convince me of what you're saying. If it was Nintendo would rather do this than

203
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:39,320
make a mobile phone Mario. And that I would believe, um, don't count anything out yet. Maybe

204
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,680
investor pressure. I don't know. Uh, let's see, looking at other comments from chat, uh, that

205
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:48,600
retro code and chat says, would it be, would it have been better if Sony had done God of War with

206
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:54,680
Netflix? Well, see, here's the interesting thing though. See with Sony, Sony is such a big, Sony

207
00:17:54,680 --> 00:18:00,320
makes TVs for God's sake. Sony also has their own entertainment arm. So everything that they do is

208
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,520
in house and they have this whole powers thing that they're doing. That's going to be on the

209
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:10,160
PlayStation and they've done it all in house. Microsoft was taking a very similar approach.

210
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,440
They had founded their own entertainment studios that then they closed right soon after that

211
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,880
without producing a whole lot of stuff. I mean, there was that documentary, which is apparently

212
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,120
pretty good. I still need to watch it. Uh, there's, um, still that quantum break series.

213
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,080
Something's going to happen with that. So Microsoft for all practical purposes was kind of

214
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,680
trying to do their own thing, but maybe, maybe a partnership like, like this is in Microsoft's

215
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:38,520
future. Who knows? Maybe after Nintendo saw what happened to Microsoft, Nintendo was like, we

216
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,000
should partner up with somebody. Not that I think Nintendo would have ever produced something like

217
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,760
this themselves. I don't know. But then, but then I think about those Pikmin movies that Miyamoto

218
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,720
did for the film festivals. So couldn't it be, I don't know. It's so confusing. So confusing.

219
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:59,200
There's no easy answer. This could all just be a big pile of poo too. This could all just be the

220
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,120
biggest fucking rumor ever. And I mean, not to, you know, obviously if the wall street journal is

221
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,240
running it, I put a little bit of credit in that, but maybe people are just making a bigger deal

222
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,840
out of it. This could be a pitch pilot for Netflix and that's it.

223
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,880
Well, then I kind of go back to also, you know, Sony making stuff out of their properties. I

224
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:24,200
mean, you have the ratchet and clank movie coming out and you've also got, there was another one

225
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,000
too that they were doing. Um, God, I don't even remember what it was now. Maybe in chart, was it

226
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,080
uncharted? Were they doing the uncharted movie? I don't know.

227
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,320
Yeah, I think I heard them say they were there in the early stages of that. Cause wasn't, um, it

228
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,480
wasn't, what's his name? The, no, I'm thinking I'm mixing it up with Assassin's Creed.

229
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:46,120
Yeah. Assassin's Creed. There's a ton of video game movies coming out and eventually they'll get

230
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:51,320
better. I mean, they're not going to screw up. It's impossible for them to eventually, eventually

231
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,160
they've got to make a good video game possible for them. They screw up every single one.

232
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,800
Eventually they're going to have to accidentally do it right. So monkey at the typewriter will

233
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:07,840
write Shakespeare eventually. It's going to happen eventually. Uh, let's see a dark soccer before we

234
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,640
get into gaming weeks. What are your thoughts on a Zelda TV show? Is this of interest to you at all?

235
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:20,320
As long as it's not like Game of Thrones, because I really don't care much for medieval politics.

236
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,760
Yeah. I don't, I don't think that it would really get into, I mean, if it's supposed to be a family

237
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,280
friendly show, I think a lot of things they do on Game of Thrones, no sleeping with your sister.

238
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,680
You can't really do any of that, but I think it also opens the possibility that what if the show

239
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:41,640
is just Hyrule? What if these are all characters that exist? Real wives of Hyrule.

240
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,760
For all we, I mean, for all we know, who says Lincoln's Zelda have to be in it at all?

241
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,640
It's all about Impa.

242
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,880
Oh, I just, it could be something set in the Zelda universe. Then maybe that would be something where

243
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,960
Nintendo's a little more willing to let it go. It'll be like Gotham.

244
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,320
What?

245
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,320
That would be sad. But by the way, I do have something else to talk about.

246
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:06,800
What's that?

247
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,320
If you don't mind giving me half a moment.

248
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,200
Sure. But can I do some comments from chat real real quick over at live.vognetwork.com just the last

249
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,800
few comments on this. That retro code in chat says, if it is a rumor, it gained a lot of attention

250
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:24,520
than anything Sony and Microsoft have done with their shows. VXJ6V says it won't be like Game of

251
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:34,200
Thrones, less sex and nudity. William Murderface suggests Hyrule Shore, GTL, Jim Triforce Laundry.

252
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:40,120
I don't know. Um, let's see. Dungeon Buster says medieval politicking with the Lannisters does not

253
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:45,080
equal family friendly. You know, I just, I don't think, I think you guys might be taking the Game

254
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,840
of Thrones comparisons a little too literally. I think that's just, you know, they see that that,

255
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,480
that audience is out there for medieval fantasy, like Lord of the Rings.

256
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,280
We don't need Chair of Master Swords.

257
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,320
All right. Before we get into gaming weeks, you have some things you want to talk about too, Jamie.

258
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,240
Yes. Now there is a game out there that I have known about it being built for a few years now, and

259
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,840
now it is finally released. It's done by a good friend of mine who I worked as his intern for a

260
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,040
while and he's one of my teachers and a couple other friends of mine have contributed in design,

261
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:23,960
but, um, it's called FLOM. F L O M M. You can get it on the App Store now. It's for iOS, um, with

262
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:32,040
iPhone and iPad. And it's basically, it's based in art history, typography and the battle for

263
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:38,040
modern art. So. This is really funny to me because when we were pitching ideas for the VOGJAM a

264
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:43,000
couple months ago, I remember a buggy game one, you had suggested we should do a game that involves

265
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,560
like typography and art. So it sounds like you kind of got your game after all. It's just not

266
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,320
really a part of the VOGJAM. It was a tease. And it was one of your teachers that did it, but.

267
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:59,880
But, um, you, you just, just actually, if you go on Google and look for FLOM, F L O M M, you'll

268
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:06,120
find it right away. Check out the artwork in it. It's amazing. The music's cool. It's a, it's $2.99,

269
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,120
but honestly, for all the work that went into it and how awesome it is, it's totally worth it.

270
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:16,760
So everyone, you've got three bucks somewhere in your pocket. Go get FLOM. All right. And who

271
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:21,240
knows, maybe I can get Steve to come on the show. All right. If enough people download it and say,

272
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:27,560
come on the show, we'll make that happen. All right. Cool. Very cool. Well, let's talk about

273
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,720
our gaming weeks. Uh, I know you have not had enough time to play that all week cause that

274
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,160
just came out. So how was your gaming week? What types of video games have you been playing this

275
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:42,920
week? Otherwise, Jamie, dragon age, lots of drag, D A I I'm assuming die. Yeah. I've been playing

276
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:46,680
a lot of dragon age, but I've mostly been writing a lot of dragon age and you still haven't left

277
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:53,320
the hinterlands. Yes. Well, no, we keep going back to the hinterlands cause I've decided that

278
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,800
because I missed a solace on, um, the last time around, I'm actually going to get all

279
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,960
the stupid shards to finish that. And then I don't know. And I'm romancing Colin with my

280
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,080
human, with her weird face. I'll show everybody pictures of her weird face. When I find them

281
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,000
over in her chair, she's, it's not weird. She's just unique. She kind of looks like in bread

282
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,880
nobility. Only you would sit there and think about these types of things as you're making

283
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,680
the character. Like I have to make her authentic for my RP to work. I'm going to need her to be

284
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:32,360
slightly inbred. Well, hello. Aren't all nobles inbred inbred worse than, I don't know if I would

285
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:38,040
say all that's, that could be a very slanderous statement. Okay. They're just, history is

286
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:44,040
fascinating. Let's just leave it at that. History is fascinating. They're all a bit frumpy, aren't

287
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:52,360
they? Because it's a bad idea when cousins marry. All right. Uh, let's move on to a Loki. How was

288
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:59,720
your gaming week? Um, my game week was okay. I did play, uh, well, one thing I finished playing,

289
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:08,360
um, was it, uh, saints group got out of hell. I 100% in game. I haven't gotten all the trophies

290
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:14,440
yet, but I don't know if I'm going to just because it's, it's now it's doing all the tedious shit

291
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:19,720
that they want you to do in the game. Like drive for like 3000 miles or something like that. It's

292
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:26,200
like, why would you drive any car when you can fly through the entire game? It's like, I don't

293
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,840
understand that, but okay. That's one of the things I have to do or play co-op for three hours

294
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:36,680
in this game. I'm like, no, no, I'm not going to do that. So I pretty much, I am, I've done with

295
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:41,240
the game, so I don't know if I'm really going to play any further with that. I did download the

296
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,480
battlefield hard lane beta today, so I'm going to probably check that out because that looks

297
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:52,520
right at my alley. Um, what else did I play this week? I don't know. I thought about playing

298
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,520
Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto, but I just didn't get around to it. Just worked at my game

299
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:02,840
mostly. So, um, you know, hopefully we'll have that to something more playable because right now

300
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,240
I just have kind of the first level and it's more of an intro. It doesn't really have anything. It's

301
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,320
um, you know, but once I get the whole, once you get the engine built then yeah, once it,

302
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,680
I've got the front, then you get to do the stuff you've been wanting to do since the very beginning.

303
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:20,200
Oh, I got all sorts of crazy ideas. I know you do. That'll be fun. Um, so yeah, I'll do that.

304
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,400
And once again, as mentioned, you know, big thanks to, you know, Raccoon Media for

305
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:28,280
the art assets and stuff. Um, and I haven't creamed some of my stuff, but yeah, you can

306
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,880
check out their stuff. They've got, um, you know, a lot of free packs out there, especially if

307
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,200
you're like looking to make like mobile games or, you know, even just regular games. I was at Raccoon

308
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,880
media, raccoon-media.nl is their website. And they, I think they're on blend swap and the assets

309
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,000
soar and there's one other one, but I don't remember. I'm the only one without something

310
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,200
to pitch tonight. I'm sorry. He asked me, they asked me the pitches. These are all good reasons.

311
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:56,680
I had, you know, I feel indebted with the low poly bacon. He gave you free bacon. The man gave me

312
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:01,080
bacon over the internet. That's like, we're now living in the future. I understand. I understand.

313
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,840
You don't have to convince me. It's fine. But, uh, yeah, that's what I played. So hopefully,

314
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,080
um, I may play something else this week. I did install a few more games. I had in my steam

315
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:17,080
backlog and bought more. Why? I don't know. I bought the star Wars humble bundle. This

316
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:21,480
you're never going to play it. You're never going to play. I know I'm never going to have

317
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:27,320
the hours to play those games. You don't have them. I'm never, it's like, they do not exist.

318
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:32,280
I'm like a hoarder. Seriously. It's like hoarding, except it's all digital. So it

319
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:38,520
doesn't make any of the mess, but yes, it's, it's, it's seriously the problem right there.

320
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:43,320
It, how many, how many games in your collection have you still not played?

321
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:51,800
Most of them. I don't know. I have a lot. I haven't even installed the new ones. I just got

322
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:57,640
today. So, or added to, I haven't even added them into my library yet, but I've got 335 games. Sorry.

323
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:05,560
In my library. I don't know. Uh, non game plane related. I did see some leaked screenshots from

324
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:10,520
just cause three and I, I had, I totally have to buy that day one now because it looks amazing.

325
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,920
That's it. That's it. All right. Someday we're going to see you on one of those like TLC shows,

326
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:23,080
uh, about hoarding. Oh, someday I'm going to look like, look back and see how much I actually spent

327
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:28,600
on my steam library after a long time. Like, Oh my God, what was I doing? At least. Okay. At least

328
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:33,240
with humble bundle, at least you can donate it to charity. So it's like a little, I have to,

329
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,720
I have to be a lot less judgy with that. And the thing is like a lot of the games I'm getting,

330
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:43,560
you know, it's just like 10 games for 11 bucks. And so, I mean, it's hard to kind of just like,

331
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:50,520
I may play it someday, but it's a buck. Okay. But sometimes, sometimes that also,

332
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,400
I'm not saying this with a humble bundle and not saying this about star Wars games,

333
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,560
but I'm just saying sometimes you can also get like, you know, you remember like they

334
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:04,280
would have the NES cartridges. It's like 96 ROMs in one and like 54 of them are just

335
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:10,120
like pallet swaps on clue, clue land. Like not every game is something you have to,

336
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:18,600
you don't need it. You don't need it. But I do. And no, here's the worst part. Here's the

337
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,200
worst part. It's starting to get like down to PlayStation network too. And that, Oh my God.

338
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:26,760
Oh my God. I want to have a show. Okay. This is my pitch to TLC. Are you, there's somebody from

339
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,840
TLC listening to the show. This is my pitch. This is my pitch. Okay. It's just like they do. You've

340
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:35,800
seen Hoarders. Surely you've all seen that show, right? And they go and they, they, they, they

341
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:40,680
clean the person's house or whatever. And the person has to like one little pile at a time

342
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:47,880
decide, do I really need this? Or should I throw it away? And like, there's always some like

343
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,680
crumpled up piece of garbage that the person just loses their fucking mind over because they can't

344
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,760
throw it away. Right. This is just, and I shouldn't make light of an illness and I'm not like not,

345
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:04,440
but I mean, it's television and they are putting themselves on TV. So. But Loki, I feel like there

346
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,240
should be a show where you're forced to sit there with your Steam collection and like the host comes

347
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:16,440
in and says, okay, Loki, you have 750 games in your Steam collection. Today, we're going to cut

348
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:24,760
that down to 50 and I need you to pick which 710 games are we going to delete forever? What if

349
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:31,960
Loki's games are so wildly popular that he becomes the next Andy Warhol of video games.

350
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:39,080
You see what that man collected a warehouse full of multiples of plates and lunch boxes and trash

351
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:43,400
cans. And he would never let any of his staff throw anything away. They had to sneak out the

352
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:48,600
trash when he wasn't there. What if- I'm not that bad. We're talking digital games here to

353
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,360
take no space. If it's like physical games, then yeah, that might be a problem because I have to

354
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,960
move that stuff around. I don't know anything about that. It's in the cloud. I don't know

355
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:01,800
anything about physical games that we keep in storage at Dan's mom's house. Oh yeah. Oh man.

356
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,400
I mean, again, I said I shouldn't make light of this, but I kind of, I kind of grew up around

357
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:10,440
this because my dad kind of has these like hoarding tendencies and like our garage was

358
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,960
just full of like weird stuff. Like there would be pens that no longer work that would be in a jar.

359
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,720
Like these are just things that my dad just happens to collect. And I remember,

360
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:24,280
I will never forget this. Do you remember when the big flood happened in the nineties and Bill

361
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:27,560
Clinton came to visit? Well, you weren't here at the time. You probably heard about it in the news.

362
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,200
Bill Clinton, who was the president at the time came to visit and all this stuff. So it was a big

363
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:35,000
flood. Now our garage flooded during that whole thing. So my dad was devastated because a lot of

364
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,240
his stuff got damaged. Well, I remember one day we were out there cleaning and trying to sort,

365
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,200
like, you know, what do we have to put in the dumpster? Cause it's wet and gone forever.

366
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:47,800
And there was a big pile of dry stuff. And my mom looks at it and goes, Rob, Rob, Rob, I'm going to

367
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:53,400
send your father into the house. Rob, I want you to get the hose and I want you to spray this all

368
00:31:53,400 --> 00:32:03,560
down. I shouldn't tell that story on my radio show, but damn. I mean, these are just, these

369
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:07,800
are just the stories that shape the person that I am today. So, you know, there you go.

370
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:13,960
I will eventually play all these games once I have, you know, enough free time. So if someone

371
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,600
takes the kids for like maybe a few years, then we'll have enough time to play through all these

372
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:23,640
games. Once you're saving for retirement is what you're doing. Oh yeah, exactly.

373
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:30,280
All right. Anyhow, uh, before I tell more stories from my childhood, I should probably get into my

374
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,520
gaming week and the types of video games that I've been playing this week. Um, a lot of the

375
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:39,720
same old standard standby stuff. I played some, you know, Diablo three, been a lot of that,

376
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,920
especially with the season ending. There's been a lot of stuff going on with Diablo three. I'm

377
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,160
looking forward to the next season soon. I've been playing a bit on PlayStation four as well,

378
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,840
because like I said, at the beginning of the year, I want to go after my platinum trophy.

379
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:56,680
So I started a new character and things are going well there. Um, excuse me, I've also been playing

380
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,760
more fantasy life, uh, cause I got some more street passes over the weekend. That was pretty

381
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,480
cool to finally see like new people show up in my village. And that's kind of neat. I like what

382
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,840
they do with that in fantasy life, but besides the, uh, good old standards that I've been playing

383
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:16,520
from week to week on this show, I got to play a lot of good old games over the weekend because I

384
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:21,640
went to an event that we talked about a couple of weeks ago on the show. I went to the rockage event

385
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:27,400
in San Jose, uh, which some people were lovingly calling and I saw this as a street passes. I got

386
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:32,840
some people were lovingly calling it mag west because of course, as we talked about with Eric

387
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:36,760
on the show a couple of weeks ago, when he was here, uh, we talked about how mag fest is now

388
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:43,160
sponsoring this fourth, uh, year of the rockage event in San Jose. Um, so basically at the San

389
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,640
Jose student union, they had the whole second floor and I think they were running some tabletop

390
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,800
on the first floor as well, but they had the whole second floor of the student union kind of sealed

391
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:57,000
off where, you know, you, you, you get your admission wristband and you get in and you have

392
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,320
access to basically three main areas. You have kind of the, the LA the foyer area, and then you

393
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:08,680
have the, the lounge stage, and then you have the main stage. And in the main stage, they had some

394
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:13,720
bands playing on and off throughout the day. And they also had a collection of classic video games,

395
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,640
uh, that I believe a lot of that was borrowed from the California extreme event, uh, that they

396
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:22,440
do here over the summer. Uh, so they had some classic games from the eighties. I got to play

397
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:27,960
some tempest, wizard of war. They had a Tron arcade machines. That was awesome. If you follow

398
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:32,920
me on Twitter, you saw that I got the number one score on Qbert. And so I put in Vaugas the

399
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:39,000
initials there cause F yeah, Qbert. Uh, and, uh, there was a point blank too. That was awesome to

400
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,280
play too. So this is a lot of like really cool, uh, retro arcade games and pinball games. And I've

401
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,360
never, I did not realize this was a thing, dark soccer, but there was, and now that I think about

402
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:52,040
maybe you have mentioned this on the show before, but I just never seen it, but they had a medieval

403
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:58,200
madness table and they had a tales of Arabian nights table, uh, table, but the dot matrix

404
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:03,080
displays were in color. Like they were modded to be color displays. And I didn't know that was

405
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,480
the thing people did. Yeah. You can get color LEDs and whatnot. I never knew that was a thing. I'd

406
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,280
never seen ones. That was really cool. There's, there's lots of, um, uh, like mods people will

407
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,600
people actually will buy kits to do certain things like with the newer tables too. Like,

408
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:23,080
well, Dan has, um, uh, I think a small mod on our Twilight zone. And then, um, for newer ones,

409
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:28,600
I showed you, uh, the pictures I took of a modded Tron that has like the arcade cabinet on it and

410
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:34,600
the extra lights and whatnot. So yeah, people do it all the time. So, uh, yeah. So I just,

411
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,400
maybe it's because I haven't been to California extreme in a few years, but that was like,

412
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:42,440
I was like, Oh, neat. So they have that. And then they had classic consoles kind of around

413
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,240
the perimeter of the main stage room. And then they had a lounge room that was a smaller room

414
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,800
and they had, they tried to make it a little more well loungy and no, it wasn't an orange

415
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,480
lounge. I'm sorry to say, but maybe we need to talk about that for next year. But anyway,

416
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:00,120
uh, they also had some classic consoles in there. So I got to play, like I got my Mario Kart 64 on,

417
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:06,120
which man, going from playing Mario Kart eight all the way back to play Mario Kart 64. Like

418
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,360
I forget that not all the tricks work and you can't drift the same way, but anyway,

419
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:17,080
it was still fun to go back and revisit that. So, um, also this is neat out in the lobby area,

420
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:22,360
they actually had, and I had yet to see one of these. They had a beat mania 2DX, uh, pen jewel.

421
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:27,400
I think the name of the mix is number 22 in the series. I had not seen one that new. I've never

422
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:32,280
seen a screen that crisp. I think it's on one of the new HD monitors. So I was like, wow, that's

423
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:37,320
kind of neat. Cause that was on free play. And then they had a new DDR, like the reboot of dance

424
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,240
dance revolution. They had that sitting right next to it. Now I didn't embarrass myself by

425
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,960
playing that in public because, you know, I talked about playing DDR last week and how easy I broke

426
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,440
sweat, but I watched some other girls playing it and watching some other people kind of rotate

427
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,000
through throughout the day. And I was like, Oh, neat. You know, it's just, it has an interface

428
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,520
that kind of reminds me of the Xbox games a little more. Uh, it was just kind of neat to see that a

429
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:03,480
little different. And they had some vendor tables, a lot of people, uh, dealing in classic games.

430
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:08,040
And then they actually had a third area for people to do music too. That was kind of off in the

431
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:13,160
corner. Um, so you'd have a lot more of the smaller, uh, rigs that would go over there.

432
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:18,840
Um, so yeah, it was music and it was, it was kind of like a little piece of a lot of conventions

433
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:23,800
I've been to in the past year or so kind of all hodgepodge together into this one thing. And

434
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:29,000
that was, that was pretty cool. Uh, I had a good time. I, you know, it's a three day event and

435
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,920
sadly I was only able to spend half a day there cause I just, you know, I had, I'm trying to do

436
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,640
this. The event is still going as we speak and I wanted to be here at OLR for you all. And I had

437
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,320
to drive to San Jose to get to this thing and I had my job. So, you know, I could only get there

438
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,920
for a half day, but I had a good time for the time I was there. Uh, I wish I could have brought

439
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,880
somebody else. I should, next year I'm going to have to really berate Jamie into going with me

440
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:55,080
if she's not working because, uh, it would have been nice to be able to play games together with

441
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:59,560
somebody or something cause I would have liked to have gone rather than, you know, what I was doing.

442
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,960
Well, maybe next year we'll plan better. We didn't have a lot of notice this year,

443
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:09,480
but I would definitely attend again next year. I had a good time. So, uh, and I, I have a feeling

444
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:14,280
this event is going to just get bigger and bigger. I have a feeling they're going to already outgrow

445
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,440
this space and next year they're going to look at something bigger. It wasn't super crowded in

446
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:23,000
the morning when I was there Saturday. In fact, I was kind of thinking like, wow, it's, I'm

447
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,280
surprised there's not a lot of people here, but then I started to think I was like, you know,

448
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,920
people are probably still hungover from last night. So I waited a little while and sure

449
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:35,160
enough as the day went on, it started to get pretty, pretty full and, uh, you couldn't even

450
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:39,960
really get on one of the classic arcade games without a wait. So, uh, I think they did a good

451
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,880
job attendance wise. I hope it was good enough to get the venue paid for and all that good stuff

452
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,080
so they can get an even bigger spot next year. But yeah, I had a good time at the Rockage event.

453
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:52,680
So congrats to all those responsible for putting it on and, uh, very talented musicians. I wish I

454
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,600
could have seen more, uh, just unfortunately, you know, again, I can only be there for a half day

455
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:01,000
and I can't be at all three stages at once, but I really enjoyed some of the stuff I was watching.

456
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Dude, this one band, and I'm so sorry, I forgot the name of the band. I'm so sorry.

457
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:11,640
Uh, but they were rocking, they were playing, uh, songs using an accordion, a saxophone. They had

458
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:16,680
a fricking, I don't know if it was a, I think it was a marimba up on stage. Like they were just

459
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:23,000
doing all this like crazy. Was, was, was there a zither? I don't think so. But then, uh,

460
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,400
did you find a theremin? No, there was no there. Well, not that I saw that. I'm not saying there

461
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,560
wasn't one there, but there just wasn't the one there when I was looking. Did you find someone

462
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:35,640
playing a melodica? Uh, probably. Melodicas are awesome. So anyway, uh, I'm sure there'll be,

463
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,960
uh, I'm sure they're coming back next year. And I gotta say, you know, there's several listeners

464
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,880
out there that has said, Rob, you really need to come to MAGFest. You need to come to MAGFest.

465
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,000
When are you going to come to MAGFest? And I gotta be thinking, after going to Rockage,

466
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:55,480
I'm kind of thinking, yeah, I probably should go to MAGFest. So I'm not saying yes to next year

467
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:00,360
yet, but I'm saying I'm thinking about it more seriously than I ever have before. So there you

468
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:06,120
go. SSU 100 Matt in our chat says, Rockage was your taste of MAGFest. Now you have to come to

469
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:10,600
the real thing. It's just, it's just cost, flights, all that. That's the only thing stopping me. But,

470
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,240
we'll see. We'll see. I'm not saying no at this point. We'll see what happens.

471
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:22,520
So that was my gaming week and a weekend thereof. So, uh, quickly, some housekeeping. I don't have

472
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:27,160
a whole lot to report. I will just say, uh, twitter.com slash O-L-R is where you can follow

473
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:32,520
us on Twitter. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio is where you can follow us on Facebook.

474
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:38,520
I mentioned we may be missing a show in March. Uh, I'm not sure if that is sure yet. I will have

475
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:43,800
an update for you guys hopefully next week. Unfortunately, uh, I am having to play a little

476
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,960
bit of a waiting game, which is frustrating to say least, but we'll find out for you next week,

477
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,600
uh, or at least I'll make a decision by then. That's for sure. All right. Uh, so that's it

478
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:58,440
for housekeeping. Let's go into some gaming news for the night. Uh, kind of been an interesting

479
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,720
week in gaming news. There hasn't been a lot of it, but there's been some interesting things here

480
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:09,160
and there. Loki. Yeah. So apparently the, um, the release date for street fighter four on PC and

481
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:15,320
PlayStation four has been revealed, uh, supposed to be coming out. I don't have the exact date

482
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:22,840
here real quick. Um, March, 2016. So that's when it's kind of slated least right now,

483
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:27,640
at least they're thinking ahead. Um, so we'll have to see them. They're saying that the roster

484
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:34,040
of characters may be pretty small. Um, leaving room for DLC almost sounds like kind of a hybrid

485
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:39,400
version of how they did killer instinct where everything was almost a la carte, but I guess

486
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:45,960
we'll have to see, um, who actually ends up being in the launch roster. Uh, they're saying it's

487
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:53,640
going to be 16 characters and, um, I don't know. I'm just not that excited about street fighter

488
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:59,800
really anymore because I have to see what really the benefits are between street fighter four and

489
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:05,800
street fighter five. I don't know. For me, it's just characters actually. Yeah. The fact that

490
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:13,400
it's going back to a roster of 16 characters, it, it concerns me a little bit. Um, I, I, it does

491
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:18,520
feel like a step backwards when we're, and I, I realized some of the more people that are tuned

492
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:22,600
into the fighting game community and in series may argue with me a little bit on this because,

493
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:28,120
you know, if the, if the, um, technique and the game and all this is improving,

494
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:32,600
then they're not going to possibly be able to fit as many characters as street fighter Uber.

495
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:36,760
Here's the thing is all I'm thinking is what they do with Marvel versus Capcom three, where it's

496
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:41,080
like, yeah, I mean, they had a pretty decent roster with that, but then, Oh, Hey, you want

497
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:45,480
DLC characters. Those are gonna be five bucks each. You know, that's like, that's a legitimate

498
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:50,440
concern. I think in the year 2015, that's a very legitimate concern to have about the game. And I

499
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:55,320
hope to God, there isn't a bunch of them that are already on the disc. I would think if they're

500
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:00,200
going to release it on PC, they're not dumb enough to do that. Cause if the, if it's on the PC disc,

501
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,720
it'll be found like that. Right. So I'm thinking that won't happen, but I, I, I have that same

502
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:11,480
concern. And I think it's legitimate that you have 16 characters for now, but then it's going to be

503
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:16,680
16 more characters that slowly come out throughout the year that are $5 each. I would just, and maybe

504
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:22,280
that won't be the case, which is fine. I would just kind of like some clarity on that. I think

505
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:27,400
some DLC characters are inevitable. Yeah. I mean, that's just the age we live in, but,

506
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:32,200
and then I'm sure that we'll get a million and that's the other thing too. It's like,

507
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:36,600
why should I really buy the DLC characters? Why I'm, you know, super street fighter five

508
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:41,720
or arcade edition turbo, whatever the hell you want to, you know, re-release it as it's going

509
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,160
to come out with those characters in there and then the additional characters. And that's what

510
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:51,080
SSG100 Matt in our chat room says, so wait for ultra super street fighter five in holiday 2016.

511
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:57,320
So a lot of people are thinking if, if this game only releases with so many characters

512
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,840
and they do all these DLC characters, yeah, I'll just wait. I'll just wait for the year

513
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:06,520
end edition or what have you. Yeah. So I would like to hear more about the game mechanics and,

514
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:13,400
you know, why maybe the roster will be less. Um, I know in the case of like mortal combat X,

515
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,000
I think that game is supposed to have a smaller roster too. I think it's what it's 24. I think

516
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,000
immortal combat X I might be wrong. Uh, but, um, the thing with mortal combat X is that each

517
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,520
character is supposed to have like three different fighting styles, I think. Yeah. So even though you

518
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:31,560
have only 24 characters, you have all these fighting styles too. So like 72 characters,

519
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:36,600
right. But not, not to give one a pass where I'm not going to give the other a pass because I'm

520
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:40,520
sure, I'm sure it's inevitable that immortal combat actually have DLC characters. Why not?

521
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:44,760
They did it with last game. So it's just a question of, all right, how many, how many,

522
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:52,200
and should I just wait for the ultimate mortal combat X edition for that? Um, let's see that

523
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:57,320
retro code in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says I'm kind of over street fighter, even though

524
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:01,480
Sony got the exclusive on it. Um, I'm seeing certainly there's a lot of people that are very

525
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:05,000
excited about it. I mean, the fighting game community, of course, I'm kind of curious how

526
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,400
they're going to sell it to everybody else. Maybe people that aren't like super tuned into the

527
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,680
fighting game community and all those events and these, how are they going to sell it to the rest

528
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:17,400
of us? Cause yeah, I mean, there's going to be a lot of people, whether you want to agree with

529
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,320
me or not, I'm telling you, there's a lot of people that are going to look at it and go,

530
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,920
why would I buy this game that only has 16 people when I could buy this one that has

531
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:32,040
50 people in it? I mean, for some people, it's going to come down to that, whether you want to

532
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:36,760
admit it or not. I mean, obviously a fighting game, super fan will be able to rattle off a

533
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:41,080
list of reasons why that's wrong, but somebody who's just looking at the back of the box in a

534
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:45,480
GameStop that isn't as tuned in. I don't know. It's just like for me, like the difference between

535
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:51,080
like when they went and did, you know, street fighter four, which, you know, style-wise that

536
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:55,160
was, you know, completely different than what they had previously, you know, how it kind of went all

537
00:45:55,160 --> 00:46:01,960
3d and everything, but it's still 2d, but now five, you know, the evolution from four to five

538
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:07,160
doesn't seem as big. Now I understand there's probably going to be a lot of stuff gameplay-wise,

539
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:12,200
tweaks, and that kind of thing, but for me, a person that's not, you know, super into

540
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:19,080
fighting games, I don't notice that. I just notice what it looks like, the roster of characters,

541
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:25,800
and is there anybody in there that, you know, kind of hooks me into the game, you know, and I just,

542
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,240
I'm not really seeing that yet. I mean, there's some gameplay things that they're doing that are

543
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:33,000
kind of neat, but it's just, you know, more of like, oh, that's kind of cool, you know,

544
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,320
other than like, oh wow, I got to really play that. So I don't know. We'll see.

545
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:44,920
All right. Well, let's see, moving on, talking about something else that happened this week with

546
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:50,040
Nintendo over in their camp, you know, Club Nintendo is being phased out. We don't know what

547
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:55,560
the replacement program looks like yet, but seeing as Club Nintendo as it is, I believe is fading

548
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:01,480
out, what, in June? I think you have until June to cash out on this stuff. It would make sense

549
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:06,440
that the successor program will be unveiled during E3. Obviously we don't know that for a fact,

550
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:10,600
but it would make an awful lot of sense, wouldn't it? Well, anyway, Club Nintendo went through an

551
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:15,160
update, as I mentioned this week, where there's a lot of stuff available. It's kind of like a

552
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:19,560
Hail Mary for the program where, you know, if you've accumulated coins and you haven't spent

553
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:25,000
them, there is plenty of stuff to spend it on now. I'm calling it now, exclusive amiibos through

554
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,560
whatever the replacement service is. Perhaps, and there's something coming up in the show later

555
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:35,000
where that may actually exactly be the case, but who knows? But, I mean, there are just virtual

556
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,680
console games galore, as well as even some full game downloads that aren't like virtual console,

557
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:47,800
like Harmonite for 3DS I saw on there, Dr. Mario on Wii U, even some retail titles were available

558
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:53,160
on there. And of course, some of that sweet Nintendo physical gear that I know a lot of you

559
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:58,360
are wanting to get your hands on. For example, there's a Zelda Majora's Mask messenger bag,

560
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:04,520
also a Majora's Mask jigsaw puzzle, which will set you back 800 coins. There's a Retro Mario

561
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:11,880
t-shirt for 700 coins, a Legend of Zelda 3DS XL pouch, and Animal Crossing playing cards for 600

562
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:16,360
coins. So, I mean, that's kind of cool that they have, like, not just the vast amount of virtual

563
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:21,080
console games, but all these physical rewards. So, they want to make sure people are going to flush

564
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:26,840
out their coins and everything will be spent. Here's the only problem. This launched, what,

565
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:33,400
Monday, Tuesday is when this all went down. The website has been getting hammered consistently

566
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:39,480
ever since. Here I am days after the fact, I'm even trying to load the page right now in studio.

567
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:45,320
Just spinning wheel, trying to get it to come up, waiting. I got to come up earlier, but I couldn't

568
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:49,960
log in to my computer. Like, this is, like, several days after the fact and this is still

569
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:55,320
broken. And so, there's a part of me that's like, this is why everybody says Nintendo

570
00:48:55,320 --> 00:49:01,000
doesn't understand online. Because they demonstrate that they don't understand online.

571
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,840
Now, on one hand, Nintendo is really under no obligation to do Club Nintendo in the first place.

572
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:11,960
I mean, it is a nice thing that they do. They do get some things out of it for all those little

573
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:16,520
product surveys that you do and stuff. I mean, that is information that Nintendo may otherwise

574
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:20,600
have to pay some other type of outside firm to gather. So, it's not that Nintendo doesn't get

575
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,280
anything out of it. But for all practical purposes, they're under no obligation to do

576
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:29,560
anything like Club Nintendo in the first place. They're really not. So, I mean, even if Club

577
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:38,200
Nintendo didn't exist, you can't get that upset. However, it is still frustrating with as fanboy-y

578
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:43,800
as a lot of Nintendo people get, as we've seen through this whole amiibo fuckery. It is really

579
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:48,360
annoying when this stuff is being dangled in front of you and you know it's going to get

580
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:53,960
snapped up and disappear like that, but you're sitting there literally watching paint dry.

581
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:58,040
You're watching that spinning circle trying to connect to this website because Nintendo

582
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:02,600
doesn't have a queue system like Blizzard does when BlizzCon tickets go on sale or something

583
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:08,120
like that. Nintendo is not that progressed online in their website development where they have some

584
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:13,480
type of system to be able to handle the load that Nintendo ought to expect by now when they're going

585
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:20,920
to offer basically a free, essentially, Majora's Mask messenger bag. I mean, really? You didn't

586
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:25,400
think the site was going to get hammered right away? I don't know. So, here we are all these

587
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:30,920
days later. Oh, it finally loaded. Hey, maybe all that complaining worked. Finally loaded.

588
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:40,760
Now I just have to log in and maybe I can spend some coins. Maybe. Anyway, VX Jason in chat says,

589
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:45,480
they demonstrate they don't understand online. Really? Counterpoint. Every new MMO ever.

590
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:50,760
Blizzard doesn't know online? Really? MMO online connected game. I didn't say Blizzard doesn't know

591
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:56,200
online, but Blizzard isn't immune to some of these problems with their own games. However,

592
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:01,720
with things on the web like BlizzCon and so forth, they actually do. I mean, there have been years in

593
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:06,200
the past that haven't worked out so well, but for right now they have a system that's kind of

594
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:11,880
worked. I mean, they have the queuing system in UQ to buy everything in the store and it

595
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:17,320
works out for the BlizzCon stuff. So, I actually think in regards to selling things online,

596
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,640
Blizzard does have it worked out right now. I would just expect five days after the fact

597
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:27,880
Nintendo would have it a little more together. But again, technically they're not under any

598
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:31,560
obligation to even talk about it or to give this stuff away in the first place. Just like,

599
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:36,360
I want no obligation to buy their damn system. I guess that's true. I guess that's true.

600
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:43,800
All right. Vidpower in chat says, the servers for Mario Kart 8 and Smash 4 online play didn't die on

601
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:48,360
day one. How come their club Nintendo site is down for a week? And Rama follows that up with

602
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:51,640
different types of server. And yeah, that's probably the main point. They're probably

603
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:56,600
completely different server farms, wherever the game servers versus the web servers are. Still,

604
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:02,120
you know, whatever the technical reason for it, it ultimately doesn't matter. It's frustrating

605
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:06,680
for the consumer at the end of the day. The specific reason why doesn't really matter

606
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:09,880
in the grand scheme of things. Anyhow, moving on. Dark soccer.

607
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:19,240
Well, there's a game series that is well known for its interesting fashion choices on some of

608
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:27,000
the male characters and proportions for its female characters. And that's Dead or Alive.

609
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:34,040
Well, Dead or Alive 5 last round is going to be coming out on PC. And well, Yosuke Hayashi was

610
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:39,160
like, don't mod the game. Well, he's not saying don't mod the game, but he's afraid that modders

611
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:46,840
are going to be doing immoral things with the game. You don't say. Immorality in Dead or Alive.

612
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:50,360
Please, please. You've seen the Street Fighter mods already.

613
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:56,600
That's classic coming from, you know, the studio that develops Dead or Alive Extreme

614
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:02,760
Beach volleyball, which I'm sure is just a volleyball game and not some excuse to,

615
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:09,480
you know, have the characters romp around in almost nothing and dressing them up and stuff

616
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:14,200
like that. I'm sure that in no way do they mean to exploit any of the characters in the game.

617
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:18,280
So it's dress up dolls. You know, I'm sure that.

618
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:25,640
You know, I don't know, I'm sure that they haven't kind of provoked some sort of reaction

619
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:30,280
from their fans based on they know what the fans want. OK, and and they're giving it to them.

620
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:35,240
And unfortunately, there's nothing you can do. They will mod this so that they're nude.

621
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:39,000
The same thing happened when Street Fighter 4 came out in PC. They modded that. And yes,

622
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:43,560
there's new cammy mods and stuff like that. So it's just going to happen.

623
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:49,080
Well, to go back to what I was saying, he was pretty happy about it coming out on Steam,

624
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:56,600
but he did put out the warning to the PC modding community. And basically, I'm just going to read

625
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:02,520
the quote. We have to deal with mod issues from an IP holder perspective. We would ask we would

626
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:10,280
like to ask PC users to play our game in good moral and manner. Otherwise, we won't be able

627
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:15,960
to release a title for PC again. That hasn't stopped Capcom, first of all. Capcom is pumping

628
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:27,240
them out. And I do understand he is appealing to an entire group out there because you yeah,

629
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:35,640
you have this objectification or this extreme, I'm going to say extreme fashion taste in the game.

630
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:44,040
And it is, however, the way that they've branded it to be. It has their mark on it. It's what they

631
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:51,080
control. And putting it out on PC, they're relinquishing a degree of control over their

632
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:56,680
property. So I understand them wanting to put out a comment on that. At the same time,

633
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:01,800
it just makes me think that when they put out that comment, they're really just opening the door for

634
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:06,120
encouragement. Absolutely. That's exactly what I was going to say. It can't be hacked. Watch.

635
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:12,040
Is I mean, the unfortunate reality of internet toilet bowl culture of which we've seen a lot of

636
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:20,120
it in the past year. The reality of this is that by making these comments, now it's a race to who

637
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:25,400
can get the naked boobies first, who can get the booby mod done first. Now it's a race because

638
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:29,560
day one, it'll be there day one. If the, if the game comes out and has a woman in it,

639
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:36,040
or even a man, there's going to be a nude patch for it. I want, I want dong mode. I want dong

640
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:41,160
mode for the guys. It will, if you're going to not mod the women, mod the guys too. Whatever

641
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:46,360
your request, it will be there. But now it is a, it is a, uh, race to get it done first.

642
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:53,160
Well, at any rate, the game's going to be out on March 30th. So if you mod it though,

643
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:56,920
do it. We'll our mods too. Like we want our brand all over.

644
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:06,280
We want it to be on, um, Oh, on Zach's tentacle head piece thing.

645
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:13,160
Uh, Brad from pod culture with an interesting suggestion in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

646
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:18,280
Maybe this is all a ploy. Reverse psychology gets folks talking about the game.

647
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:24,040
Maybe they've already resigned themselves to the fact that, uh, this game's going to get modded,

648
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:29,080
but what an awfully nice reminder to all those PC users to a pre-order this game. So you can,

649
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:36,200
uh, get your boobies and your dongs day one. I wonder, this is just a thought.

650
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:40,040
And I'm trying to really think of how feasible it is because it would require the game to be

651
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:46,840
online all the time. If basically what you have in game are just blank models. And then when each

652
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:53,080
round starts, download texture, load it, you know, but then again, that would require everyone beyond

653
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:57,480
high speed. And I think that would really be the only way around it. And then all it would do is

654
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:01,960
just, you know, basically, uh, people would just change coding anyway. But, um, I, you know, try

655
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:08,040
to think of ways around that, you know, how to make everybody happy. Yeah. All right. Uh, let's

656
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:13,720
see. Go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Fifth dream in chat says dongs require

657
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:18,840
modeling. Nipples only require skins. Oh, now we're getting into the science of it.

658
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,760
Well, you should be able to do ass. You should be able to do ass at least, right? It's more

659
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:28,520
difficult to do. You know, they've already fly-cammed around dragon age to see if the men

660
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:34,200
have bits. They don't. They're all Barbie dolls and Ken dolls. But all the women have, you know,

661
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:44,680
fully complete boobs. So that's unfair. That's unfair. Some people need bulldog in their life.

662
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:50,360
That wouldn't be me by the way. Just say it. You just say it on behalf of those that need it.

663
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:57,960
All right. Moving on Loki. All right. So kind of a 180, you know, first, first they were striking

664
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:06,280
down videos that had, you know, modding stuff for them for Dying Light. Now Techland has said,

665
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:10,280
hey, you know what? We're going to be actually releasing official mod tools. And sorry,

666
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:19,640
you know, we didn't, we didn't mean to strike those down. So I don't know. It's just surprising.

667
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:27,560
Apparently they were intent to stop the be the zombie mode hacks or, or hacks in be the

668
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:32,200
zombie mode. And they accidentally, they said they accidentally blocked modders from being able to

669
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:39,400
tweak the game files. Okay. I'll take that. Whatever. That's fine. As long as they've,

670
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:44,040
you know, fixed the problem in the short amount of time. So good for them.

671
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:49,000
I haven't had a chance to check out this game yet. I've been hearing a lot of good things about it.

672
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:53,720
Yeah. I wasn't really on my radar, but. I've been hearing a lot of good things about it as well.

673
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:59,640
Just haven't, haven't really had a chance to pick it up. And I don't know if I will though,

674
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:07,720
cause I have still games I haven't played yet. So. All right. Well, moving on to some controversy

675
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:12,840
from earlier in the week, and this has to do with a league of legends tournament, a league of

676
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:17,320
legends tournament organizer in the Philippines. Cause remember legal legends is huge all over the

677
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:22,360
world. Uh, you know, being the free to play game, this game is huge, not just in the U S

678
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:26,040
but in a lot of Asian territories. So there's, there's tournaments all the time and all sorts

679
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:30,680
of places. So there was a league of legends tournament organizer in the Philippines. Uh,

680
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:36,440
and they were going to be doing an event call. It was an all feminine event called the iron

681
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:40,760
Solari, which, you know, you kind of look at that and you go, okay, you're trying to try to appeal

682
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:45,400
to get some more lady gamers out there. Try to divert diversify the league of legends

683
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:50,840
audience. This is a good thing, right? Well, if, uh, you go to the website for,

684
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:56,200
and I might be mispronouncing this Garina, uh, Philippines, and you look at the outlines there,

685
00:59:56,200 --> 01:00:04,600
uh, there was a very interesting, uh, quote about their views on, um, certain types of women that

686
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:11,560
they wanted to limit as participating. And the quote goes like this quote for any events we do,

687
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:16,280
we always want to make sure we are able to have an inclusive environment where no one feels left

688
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:21,960
out. And of course, for everybody to enjoy on this angle, we believe that allowing more to be

689
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:27,160
eligible to join us is obviously the answer. And as many of our female teams have expressed

690
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:31,880
on the other hand, for any competitions, we seriously look at ensuring there's a fair level

691
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:37,480
playing field for all participants. And there are arguments and concerns from other participants

692
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:44,280
who dispute that lesbian, gay, transgendered women members may probably have some unfair

693
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:50,920
advantage. So what was written in the rules that there would be a maximum of one gay or

694
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:57,640
transgendered woman to participate on a team for a single day. So you can't swap somebody out for

695
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:03,880
someone else or what have you. And as you can imagine, Tumblr didn't take to this very well

696
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:06,920
as they shouldn't. And a lot of Twitter and a lot of people were like, what?

697
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,480
Intelligent person shouldn't take to that very well.

698
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:15,400
They're basically, unfortunately, when you say a comment like this, you're essentially saying

699
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:22,520
gay women and transgendered women are not women. That's, that's, that's the problem with what they

700
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:26,360
said. That's essentially what they said. Uh, and they, they, you may not say, well, that's not what

701
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,640
they said. That's, that's the message they sent across when they, when they said something like

702
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:36,120
that. And that is, that is wrong. And I would also like to know, how are they going to fucking

703
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:41,560
know? Like, will there, will there be an examination? Will there, will there be a gayity

704
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:46,680
test? Will they be taking the teams to Home Depot and see who knows what to do? I'm kidding. I'm

705
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:52,600
kidding. Don't, don't write your hate emails. But in all seriousness, like how the fuck were they

706
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:56,200
supposed to enforce something like this in the first place? And where the hell does a rule like

707
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,960
this come from anyway? Like they, you know, they validate those hundred dollar bills. They just

708
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:04,520
swipe it across and it changes colors. You know, that's how they know. They use litmus paper.

709
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:12,920
Oh, you have a pH of minus five. You're gay. Is that why secret is pH balanced for a woman?

710
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:19,000
I always wanted to know. Anyway, look, look, look, I'm joking. I'm joking. We're having

711
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:25,160
fun with this. Don't, don't get, don't get real mad, but are you the gay? But our point is here,

712
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:31,080
here's my question is that my understanding is one of the top Starcraft 2 players out there

713
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:37,320
is a transgendered woman. Am I correct in that? I'm almost positive. Maybe the chat room knows this,

714
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:41,240
but I believe there's like a top ranked Starcraft 2 player out there that I know I've seen.

715
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:45,720
And in reality, there's probably more than one, but there's one that's coming to mind that happens

716
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:52,760
to be a transgender female. Is this rule because of jealousy of said individual? Is that what this

717
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:59,800
is? Cause that's kind of what my reaction is to all this is, is that it's like jealousy or

718
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:04,200
something. I don't know. I don't know what the fuck this is. There are people out there who

719
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:09,800
judge others based on what genitalia they have. End of story. Those people are called bigots.

720
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:18,280
End of story. Yeah. Could it be, I have to throw this out there because this is another country

721
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:26,920
we're talking about. Could it be these cultural things coming into play that we're a little more

722
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:31,400
progressed here in the States? I mean, we still have a long way to go, but we're more progressed

723
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,440
here in the States with our viewpoints on some of these topics than maybe they are in the

724
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:38,120
Philippines. Just throwing it out there. I mean, maybe that's something that coming into play with

725
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:45,800
this as well. So anyhow, as you can imagine, the internet got real mad about this as they should

726
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:51,960
and Riot Games ended up sending out a tweet pretty quick, same day. And Riot Games, who makes

727
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:57,320
League of Legends, if you weren't aware, tweeted, LGBT players are welcome at official League of

728
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:03,560
Legends tourneys. We're working with our partners to ensure consistency with our values across all

729
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:08,920
regions. And so Riot Games was pretty much came down and said, oh, hell no, they're not going to

730
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:14,360
use our name with that kind of rule in a tournament basically. And sure enough, this got switched

731
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:20,120
around pretty darn fast. There was an update that came out where the restrictions were removed.

732
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:25,480
And there was a more full response, but you can imagine it was a lot of apologizing.

733
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:32,120
So there it is. Akuma JP in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, he replied,

734
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:40,680
woof, he is gay. Alan Alchemy in chat says, the cultural difference argument is kind of derailing

735
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:45,400
though, because even if it's true, it doesn't make it any less offensive. No, you're right.

736
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:50,280
And I don't mean to make it sound like it's an acceptable excuse. I'm just trying to sit here

737
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:56,520
and go, how on earth does a reasonable person think publishing that on the, as a rule was a

738
01:04:56,520 --> 01:05:02,040
good idea? Like, how did they even think that this was something they could get away with? And you

739
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:09,320
know, I'm just like, is it a cultural thing? Well, and there's, there's a good, I hate to say it,

740
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:13,080
but there's a good example of what I mean when I say the cultural differences. You'd expect

741
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:18,840
something like this out of Russia, but FYI, it doesn't make it right there either. All right.

742
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:24,520
And Raginator says, I wouldn't say that we're more progressed. Westboro Baptist Church,

743
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:29,160
need I say more? What have they done lately? Well, I mean, have people just finally stopped

744
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:32,920
giving them attention? I think, I think, but here's the thing about the Westboro Baptist

745
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:38,120
Church is that for most people, again, though, the Westboro Baptist Church is the village idiot.

746
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:42,680
Like, we kind of look at them and we laugh at them and go, oh, those idiots. Look at,

747
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:48,440
they're so stupid. I mean, this is the price we pay for free speech is some people are going to

748
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:54,440
say some real stupid shit. Look at these guys. You know, I think it's to the point where nobody takes

749
01:05:54,440 --> 01:06:02,200
those people seriously. Anybody that does is in the vast minority, vast minority. And they have

750
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:06,760
a right to say their thing, but we have a right to call them idiots because of it, which the Westboro

751
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:11,800
Baptist Church are, in fact, idiots. And for the record, the rule of free speech only

752
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:19,720
relates to speaking out against the government in approved social forums. It doesn't mean

753
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:23,960
freedom of consequence. That's right. Someone can point their finger at you and point how big of an

754
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:30,440
idiot you are and put it out on public news and people can, you know, pull contracts away from

755
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:37,160
you. What's his fuck name from Duck Dynasty, whoever that dumb shithead is. You know, people

756
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:43,320
can hold you accountable for what you say and freedom of speech doesn't have jack shit to do

757
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:51,080
with it. Yeah. So anyway, at least it does make me happy. Like on a personal note, obviously I

758
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:55,800
make it no secret on this program here that I happen to be a gay man who's, you know,

759
01:06:56,360 --> 01:07:01,320
who loves video games just as much as you do and does the show and so forth. And I got to say,

760
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:07,880
though, like I can see the change from when I was in high school. Like high schoolers today,

761
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:12,280
it's so different than it was when I was in high school. Like not to be all like, get off my lawn

762
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:18,520
and all that. But I mean, this comes from a place of, I am happy to see that in society today,

763
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:24,920
Westboro Baptist Church are the idiots. They are mocked. They are the ones that any decent,

764
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:29,240
reasonable human being looks at that and goes, they're stupid. You know, where, you know,

765
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:33,960
20 years ago, it might not have been so much the majority. So I feel like as a society,

766
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:39,720
we have come a long way and I hope other parts of the world catch up real darn quick for the

767
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:47,480
sake of people like me in those other places. Anyhow. Ikuma JP says, OMG, Rob is gay? Get out.

768
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:54,520
No, it's my show. I'm staying right here. All right. Dark Soccer, what do you have for us on

769
01:07:55,320 --> 01:08:00,760
hopefully a just better front? Well, I do have something. Game Developers Conference

770
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:09,400
will have the Indie Mega Booth Showcase. Woo. And this actually conference is on March 2nd through

771
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:14,760
6th at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, which we walked by many, many, many, many, many times

772
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:23,480
at GamerX, did we not? So there's going to be over 150 different indie game studios there.

773
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:27,960
We'll be showing off a few different ones. There's going to be 15 demos as well, too.

774
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:32,360
So I will go ahead and list those off. There's That Dragon Cancer

775
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:40,520
by Ryan Green and Josh Larson. Gemini by Echo Stone Games. I guess it's Machineers by

776
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:49,640
Lojica Apps. Megaton Rainfall by Pentadimensional Games. Pillar by Michael Arts. Inside My Radio by

777
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:56,920
Steven Studios. No Pineapple Left Behind by Subaltern Games. Push Me, Pull You by House House.

778
01:08:56,920 --> 01:09:01,160
Okay, I just like a company called House House. House House. The Flock by-

779
01:09:02,440 --> 01:09:07,640
Jamie and the House House. The Flock by Vogelslap, which just makes me think we need now

780
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:16,200
a little in-house studio called Vogslap. Vogslap, baby Vogslap. Simpsons, anyone?

781
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:23,160
Yeah. Legends of Ice Involved by Adderducks Entertainment. Mushroom 11 by Untame. Fate

782
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:29,800
Tectonics by Golden Gear. That's a cool name. Tenertia by Condescent Games. Throw Trucks with

783
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:35,400
Your Mind by- Okay, I want that game right now. Latwire wins GDC. Throw Trucks with Your Mind.

784
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:40,840
And then Extreme Exorcism by Golden Ruby Games. I don't know, that one sounds kind of rad.

785
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:45,880
It's not just exorcism, it's extreme exorcism. What if they put those two games together?

786
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:53,240
And it was like psychic ghost truck throwing exorcism tergeist. Lowkey, get on it.

787
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:59,000
Do the thing! There literally are no ideas that are too crazy for my game.

788
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:05,560
Now you'll just have to figure out how to do that. That's it. I'm gonna combine all of these games.

789
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:13,000
Well, at least a few of them. So we have Throw Dragons with Your Mind

790
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:22,760
from pineapples that are possessed. There's my game. In a place called Ice Involved. The end.

791
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:26,920
Did you say you're gonna just combine a bunch of video games together?

792
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:28,200
You know what that makes me think of.

793
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:43,320
Rob, do you know how people like you sometimes? What?

794
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:47,160
Special snowflakes. I do want to have a level like that,

795
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,800
but I don't know. That's gonna be kind of difficult to do.

796
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:53,240
I'm at the point where I like legitimately miss Katamari Damacy.

797
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,440
I do. Me too.

798
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:58,280
I don't know, but then I need them to just go back to their roots.

799
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,400
I miss Noby Noby Boy.

800
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:04,360
Just think though what they could do with Katamari now that you can handle so many more

801
01:11:06,040 --> 01:11:10,920
particles and stuff on screen with the new consoles. They'd be awesome.

802
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:13,080
I just wondered, has Girl reached Earth yet?

803
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:17,960
Was I the only person constantly playing Noby Noby Boy on my phone?

804
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:19,560
Out of this crowd, yes.

805
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,480
I thought Girl was going away from...

806
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:23,880
No, Girl was supposed to be reaching Earth, I thought.

807
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:26,760
No, I thought she was going out further into the galaxy.

808
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,760
I don't know where Girl is. I'm gonna see where Girl is.

809
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:30,680
All right, you look her up. Let us know.

810
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,040
Girl, where are you?

811
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:33,080
Girl, where you at?

812
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:36,440
Did Loki really say that?

813
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,040
No use of it.

814
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:48,520
There actually is a thing called Noby Noby Stats, and Girl right now is at Uranus.

815
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:57,080
Good night, everybody. That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange

816
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:59,320
Lounge Radio. See you next week.

817
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,120
As of December.

818
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:02,760
All right, just kidding.

819
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:03,000
All right.

820
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,200
And there is your Noby Noby Boy update.

821
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:10,680
Thank you.

822
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:16,360
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and see what's coming to Uranus

823
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:17,000
real soon.

824
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:19,720
That's just wrong.

825
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:21,640
Loki, would you like to start?

826
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:25,000
Uh, I guess, if I must.

827
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,760
I honestly don't know what's coming out this week.

828
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,760
I don't think anything is, actually, now that I think of it.

829
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:31,800
Let's evolve around here or something.

830
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:32,680
I have no idea.

831
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:34,520
I'm gonna say nothing.

832
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:37,720
Nothing's coming out?

833
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:38,680
I'm just gonna say that.

834
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:42,520
Do you just make up the news now and just...

835
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,040
Uh, don't we all?

836
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,480
All right, well, let's travel.

837
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:51,480
Oh, you're right. Good point. Good point.

838
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,720
Let's travel over to Japan and check out-

839
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,400
I'll let you know later on if something's actually coming out.

840
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,800
Let's go to Japan and see how much longer girls are getting.

841
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:00,040
I said, um, I thought Evolved was coming out and Evolved-

842
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:01,960
I was gonna say, wasn't Evolved this week?

843
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:02,200
Okay.

844
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:08,120
Well, I mean, technically you buy the game,

845
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:13,160
but you're gonna be continually buying this game in DLC form over the next three months, right?

846
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:13,800
Pretty much.

847
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,440
So, I mean, yeah, that's kind of true.

848
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:18,280
No, actually, I did lie.

849
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:20,040
There are things coming out this week.

850
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:23,400
I should forget that Nintendo is releasing a new 3DS.

851
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:24,840
So, I mean, there's that, I guess.

852
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:30,440
But yes, the new 3DS will be coming out on Friday,

853
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:33,800
as well as some other games to go with that.

854
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:38,680
But Evolved, yeah, they have that coming out on PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.

855
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:43,240
What else we got here?

856
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:47,000
Majora's Mask on new 3DS?

857
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,320
Or, well, I guess that's actual just regular 3DS.

858
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,800
That's not a new 3DS-only game, is it?

859
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:53,320
No.

860
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:53,880
Can't be.

861
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:56,440
They don't have any new 3DS-only games right now,

862
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:59,000
which is another reason why would you buy a new 3DS.

863
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,600
Xenoblade in April, supposedly.

864
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:03,160
Supposedly?

865
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:05,240
Whatever.

866
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,280
Okay, I don't need that.

867
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:09,560
I think that's it.

868
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,960
It's just pretty much, um, oh, let's see here.

869
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:16,920
Yeah, that's, um, it's pretty much just Evolved in the new 3DS.

870
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:19,000
All right, much better when you don't make it up, Loogie.

871
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
All right, traveling to Japan and looking at what's coming out.

872
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,120
As far as you're aware.

873
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:30,280
In Japan this week, Sengoku Musou 4-2 in a regular and treasure box.

874
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:32,120
I don't know why it's 4-2.

875
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,360
I guess that's like Final Fantasy 13-2.

876
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,760
I hear you like sequels, so here's a sequel for your sequel.

877
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:40,760
I think that's got to be what this is, but Sengoku Musou is Dynasty Warriors, right?

878
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:44,680
So for whatever reason, number four is getting a sequel, so there it is.

879
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:47,960
That is coming out in Japan this week in regular and treasure box.

880
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:49,560
Maybe it's 42.

881
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:51,960
No, it's definitely 4-2.

882
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:56,760
Anyhow, Lords of the Fallen also coming out this week in Japan.

883
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:57,640
You can check that out.

884
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:05,320
Over on the Xbox One, nothing this week in Japan, which, you know, makes sense.

885
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:10,760
On the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan, that same Sengoku Musou 4-2 or whatever is out in Japan,

886
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:16,360
as well as a rewrite, and Dead or Alive 5 is right around the corner in Japan.

887
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,200
Not this week, but next week.

888
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:24,760
Looking at the Wii U, nothing in Japan for the Wii U until we get to Mario Party 10 in March.

889
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:28,600
So nothing this coming week, unless there's a digital release I'm not aware of yet.

890
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,680
But on the Vita, there's a lot more to look forward to.

891
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:33,320
You've got Sengoku Musou 4-2 is there as well.

892
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:36,680
Yukio no Uryoshi is there as well.

893
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:42,680
And Gaoken Heaven Boys Love Scramble is out as well on the PlayStation Vita.

894
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:46,520
Last but not least, on the Nintendo 3DS this week in Japan,

895
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:55,640
Nanatsu no Tazai Shinjutsu no Enzai comes out this week on the 3DS in Japan.

896
01:15:56,600 --> 01:16:00,040
There's also some new cover plates making their way to Japan this week.

897
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:05,480
And The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask 3D on Valentine's Day for your loved ones.

898
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:09,000
I was going to say Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate 3DS will be coming out in the US.

899
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,240
And of course, we're not going to expect any of those faceplates

900
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:12,520
since we don't get any faceplates.

901
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:15,400
I should actually play that demo since I've got it now.

902
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:21,800
I don't know. It seems like if you're not really into it, the Monster Hunter series,

903
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:22,840
this one isn't going to win you over.

904
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,760
Well, check it out then. You might like it.

905
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:30,040
Well, we do have a few things.

906
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:35,080
On the 11th is Unmechanical Extended on PS4 and PS3.

907
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:38,440
And on the 13th, we have Lucius II The Prophecy,

908
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:44,280
and Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate, and The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask 3D.

909
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:47,800
All right, just a few more stories for you guys.

910
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,960
And then the classic game of the week.

911
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:51,160
But first, Loki.

912
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:55,640
Yes, unfortunately, don't have a good story for you.

913
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:57,720
But this is kind of sad.

914
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:59,800
I was kind of shocked when I heard about this.

915
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:02,120
I was coming out of work, actually.

916
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:09,080
And so Monty Oom, a guy who I always will remember

917
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:15,320
as the guy that was behind some of the really awesome machinima videos that they had.

918
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:20,600
Dead Fantasy was a series I loved from him, as well as Haloroid.

919
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:24,760
He did a really awesome fight sequences.

920
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:32,040
Also, of course, RWBY, which is a new series.

921
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,040
Yeah, and that's actually on Netflix now.

922
01:17:36,040 --> 01:17:38,760
But unfortunately, Monty Oom passed away.

923
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:43,320
He passed away due to a severe allergic reaction

924
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:46,520
during a simple medical procedure that left him in a coma.

925
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:48,520
And unfortunately, he wasn't able to recover,

926
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:49,880
and he passed away in the hospital.

927
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:51,960
So it's unfortunate.

928
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,520
He also worked on Red vs. Blue.

929
01:17:56,280 --> 01:18:00,520
And I don't know, just did a lot of good stuff for Rooster Teeth.

930
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,000
So he was only 33 years old.

931
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,120
On top of that, though, even a little bit more hitting home,

932
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:11,480
is he was actually pretty good at freestyle in DDR and Pump It Up.

933
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:13,640
I was not aware of that.

934
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,960
So yeah, I actually have some videos out there for that.

935
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:18,600
Unfortunate.

936
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:21,640
It's funny, I had actually dreamed about working with this guy

937
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:25,960
for my pitch for the new DDR game I had a while back.

938
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:29,720
But unfortunately, that'll never happen.

939
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,480
So that's it.

940
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:36,440
And it's so hard to hear about this type of stuff.

941
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:37,480
Especially, I mean, there was...

942
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:38,520
He's only 33.

943
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:39,720
Well, and he's only 33.

944
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:40,520
That's younger than me.

945
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:44,280
That's so, like, just stunning to hear that.

946
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:46,680
And especially if something that was, like, really, I mean,

947
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:48,920
just sounds like it was complications from...

948
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:49,800
An allergic reaction.

949
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:51,960
I mean, that's just like, what can you do about that?

950
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:52,920
That's so scary.

951
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:58,120
And then, I mean, this right on the heels of the news about Andrew Yoon last week.

952
01:18:58,120 --> 01:18:59,400
So, I mean, this is just...

953
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,320
That's just tragedy left and right.

954
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:05,480
So, you know, our thoughts go out to the families

955
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:08,520
and those directly affected by the past things

956
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:10,120
that we've been feeling in the gaming industry

957
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:11,720
these past couple weeks.

958
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:14,440
But certainly, a lot of us are feeling a loss right now.

959
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:17,560
So our respects to these individuals.

960
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:21,960
Rama in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com points out

961
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,600
they're having a big RWBY, R-W-B-Y,

962
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:28,280
memorial photo shoot for Monty at Katsucon this weekend.

963
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:29,880
Well, that's kind of cool that they're going to have

964
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:33,320
these tributes showing up in these very appropriate places.

965
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:36,040
Well, here's the other thing that kind of, like, is pretty awesome.

966
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:40,200
As for honoring Monty, we do that in our own way.

967
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:43,880
In lieu of flowers or gifts, we ask that you simply do something creative.

968
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,960
Use your imagination to make the world a better place

969
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:49,560
in that way you can or in any way that you can.

970
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:51,480
So, pretty inspirational.

971
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:54,920
They have, like, a nice tribute video on roosterteeth.com.

972
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:57,960
And check it out, it's pretty awesome.

973
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:59,480
And that's just you and Hunter Matt pointing out

974
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:01,800
that I marathoned RWBY this week.

975
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:04,200
So a lot of people checking that out in tribute.

976
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,080
All right, well, the show must go on.

977
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,640
So I'm going to continue on to our next news story tonight.

978
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:11,720
So I'm going to go to a completely different direction here

979
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:13,640
and talk about something that's probably a follow-up

980
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,960
to something Loki had suggested earlier in the show

981
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:19,800
about gold and silver Mario amiibo.

982
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:24,680
And yep, gold and silver Mario amiibo look like this is a thing.

983
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:29,000
This is coming from a forum post

984
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,480
where these figures were dug up,

985
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:34,360
like the pictures were dug up on Nintendo's site.

986
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:37,320
All we know so far, though, is the box art.

987
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:41,080
Nintendo, of course, has not made any comment on these figures as of yet.

988
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:43,720
And of course, some people are wondering, are they a Photoshop?

989
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:45,960
I don't know. Maybe.

990
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:49,640
But I want to say somebody saw this on, like, an inventory sheet.

991
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:52,120
It's possible.

992
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:56,680
They do this type of thing with Disney infinity had crystal figures.

993
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:59,560
So they're like different versions.

994
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:03,800
They also have, you know, variants for Skylanders where they're more rare.

995
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:06,440
I would not doubt that they're doing this, of course.

996
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:09,000
Gives you an opportunity to sell Mario two or three more times.

997
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,520
Is this something now you suggested earlier in the show?

998
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:16,360
We were talking about Club Nintendo closing and what the successor could be.

999
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:18,360
You mentioned it'll involve amiibo.

1000
01:21:18,360 --> 01:21:19,160
Are we looking at it?

1001
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:20,920
Possibly.

1002
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:24,440
I don't know if this would be something that's exclusive to that, but maybe.

1003
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,240
I would think that we'd see something maybe like this.

1004
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:31,640
Variants or even exclusive characters through there.

1005
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:34,920
You know, maybe some, like, more niche characters.

1006
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:35,480
Oh, God.

1007
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:40,360
Like, you're gonna get extra things that unlock if you have a gold one or a silver one?

1008
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:41,000
Oh, God.

1009
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Or it'll just be a skin in the game.

1010
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,120
It'll be just like your gold Mario in Smash Brothers now instead.

1011
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,920
Does that mean I might get a pink gold peach amiibo?

1012
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:53,960
Because apparently that's a character Mario Kart eight.

1013
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:54,760
Maybe.

1014
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,120
I guess anything's possible.

1015
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:59,720
But there's a difference between silver Mario and metal Mario, right?

1016
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:00,840
Or I guess.

1017
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:01,480
I don't know.

1018
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:03,560
I mean, it doesn't look like right there.

1019
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:06,520
It just looks like they've pained one silver pain, one gold.

1020
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:07,020
Yeah.

1021
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:10,120
Kaijuto in chat over at live.vongnetwork.com says,

1022
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:13,400
I'm gonna wear gold Mario amiibo to show off my bling bling.

1023
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:17,400
Oh, is that I could wear it around my neck like an accessory.

1024
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,360
Is that something I could do?

1025
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:19,560
Okay.

1026
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:20,600
Flava Flav.

1027
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:23,240
Maybe that's a Dragon Con outfit in the making there.

1028
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:25,400
I'm gonna dress up as an amiibo.

1029
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:28,280
All right.

1030
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:29,000
Nobody will get it.

1031
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:29,400
That's fine.

1032
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:29,960
That's cool.

1033
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:30,360
I understand.

1034
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:32,120
You have to have a stand with you.

1035
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:34,360
A little black circle you can stand on.

1036
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:34,680
Yeah.

1037
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:35,000
Right.

1038
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:35,240
Yeah.

1039
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:35,960
A platform.

1040
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:36,920
All right.

1041
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:41,400
Anyhow, I'm sure plenty more to come as we get closer and closer to E3.

1042
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:45,080
A lot of this will be trickling out or maybe even the next Nintendo Direct,

1043
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:45,640
whatever that is.

1044
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:47,560
They tend to have them about once a month, so we'll see.

1045
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:50,840
Japan got a Nintendo Direct this week all about Xenoblade,

1046
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:52,360
but we didn't get it for whatever reason.

1047
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:55,080
Xenoblade's not coming out until April here.

1048
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:55,880
I guess that's true.

1049
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:56,760
I guess that's true.

1050
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:57,000
All right.

1051
01:22:57,000 --> 01:22:57,800
Well, let's move on.

1052
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:59,640
We're gonna go to a simpler time.

1053
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:03,320
There was no amiibo or near field communication.

1054
01:23:03,880 --> 01:23:08,200
You unlock things in the game by hitting like up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right,

1055
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:08,920
BA, start.

1056
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:09,480
That was that.

1057
01:23:09,480 --> 01:23:09,960
It was a very...

1058
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,640
You held buttons while you put in your quarters.

1059
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:12,520
That's exactly right.

1060
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:13,960
It was a more simpler time in gaming.

1061
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:16,840
We're gonna visit that in a segment we call the classic game of the week.

1062
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:22,760
Dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey,

1063
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:27,240
you should play this game because like it's a classic and stuff.

1064
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:28,680
It's a little sticky.

1065
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:32,200
And sometimes it ties into the news as this week's title does.

1066
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:32,760
Right, Dark soccer?

1067
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:33,160
Yes, it does.

1068
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:36,600
I was fully inspired by the news and I was also surprised I haven't done it before.

1069
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:38,040
So what is the classic game of the week?

1070
01:23:38,040 --> 01:23:39,240
The game is Dead or Alive.

1071
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:44,360
It came out in 1996 as a fighting game done by Tecmo.

1072
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:48,680
And the first entry in the series by Team Ninja.

1073
01:23:48,680 --> 01:23:55,000
And it came out for the Sega Saturn and Sony Playstation in 1998.

1074
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,760
The Saturn version was Japan only.

1075
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:04,440
Yes, this is the game that gave us the very, very, very bouncing boobies.

1076
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:08,760
That you could actually input like your age and everything and change it.

1077
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:14,120
So yeah, the Dead or Alive had different choices of gameplay as well.

1078
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:16,920
That really set it apart from the other 3D games at the time.

1079
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:22,840
It really focused on speed and simple commands and reaction time.

1080
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:29,720
So the countering system was very unique as well because it used different type of commands

1081
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:31,800
to go with the type of counter you were going to do.

1082
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,200
You also had different holds in there.

1083
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:38,760
You had offensive hold and defensive hold, which you would either hold back or forward

1084
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:40,840
depending on how you're going to do that.

1085
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:42,680
So you'd either force them away or counter damage.

1086
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:47,800
You also had these things called danger zones that were around the edges.

1087
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:56,680
So that, for example, you could send a character flying by slamming them onto the danger zone

1088
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,120
and they would bounce up.

1089
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:04,360
To avoid that you would have to do a defensive roll called ukemi.

1090
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,080
And the game also had this ongoing plot.

1091
01:25:09,080 --> 01:25:10,120
I mean, it's still going.

1092
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:15,480
I just sat out for 3 hours one night about a month and a half ago reading the plot of

1093
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:17,000
Dead or Alive, I swear.

1094
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:25,240
So basically, it's just that you have different main characters.

1095
01:25:25,240 --> 01:25:28,360
There's Kasumi, Ayane.

1096
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:37,240
You have the wrestler, Base Armstrong, Bayman, Genfuu, John Lee, Kasumi...

1097
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:38,280
I said Kasumi.

1098
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:40,920
Leifang Raidou, who is Ayane's dad.

1099
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,000
Ryu Hayabusa from...

1100
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:46,520
Ninja Gaiden.

1101
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:47,160
Yes, thank you.

1102
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:47,660
Brain.

1103
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:50,360
You have Tina, who's a wrestler as well.

1104
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:52,840
And Zack, who dresses up like a Teletubby in later games.

1105
01:25:55,240 --> 01:26:02,920
And basically Tomonobu Itagaki was saying that he just really did not like how fighting

1106
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:04,520
games were designed at the time.

1107
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:07,160
He missed the old arcade style play.

1108
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:10,040
He wanted to take fighting games a different direction.

1109
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:15,640
So since he had been there with Tecmo for a while, they're like, hey, go for it.

1110
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:17,800
So this was the result.

1111
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:24,200
The original game ran on Sega Model 2 arcade board, but the backgrounds were actually polygonal

1112
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:24,700
models.

1113
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:32,200
And the Saturn made use of bitmaps and parallax scrolling the same way that Retro Fighter

1114
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:32,700
2 did.

1115
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:43,020
So this was basically the first time Sega licensed their hardware to a third party company

1116
01:26:43,020 --> 01:26:44,220
for this arcade release.

1117
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:53,740
And then, of course, we had the PlayStation version, which was the one that Bass and Ayane

1118
01:26:53,740 --> 01:26:54,240
were in.

1119
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:56,940
And it had different music.

1120
01:26:56,940 --> 01:27:02,140
And this is the version that we got out in North America on March 31st, 1998.

1121
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:04,300
Europe got it in July 1998.

1122
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:06,620
I'm still giggling like a child over here.

1123
01:27:06,620 --> 01:27:09,180
I just haven't really watched this game be played in a long time.

1124
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:13,100
I haven't really played a Dead or Alive game since it was first out on Xbox 360.

1125
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:14,860
I never played the original.

1126
01:27:14,860 --> 01:27:18,940
It came out in a time, that kind of dark period where I wasn't really doing a lot of gaming.

1127
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:24,540
And I'm looking at this just watching, again, Kasumi and the way her boobs bounce in this

1128
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:25,900
little playthrough video we have here.

1129
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:29,980
And it's so stupid and over the top.

1130
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:32,700
Boobs don't move like that, but it's funny.

1131
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:36,620
Well, there actually is a whole Tumblr called Boobs Don't Work That Way.

1132
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:41,180
But usually it's more for just pointing out Rob Liefeld's bad art.

1133
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:47,580
Another thing, Tecmo also put out Dead or Alive Plus Plus for arcades that was based

1134
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:54,300
off the PlayStation version, had updated gameplay, and then it expanded a little bit more for

1135
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:55,260
Dead or Alive 2.

1136
01:27:55,500 --> 01:28:02,460
It was listed in 2011 by Complex as the seventh best fighting game of all time.

1137
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:08,780
And then it was remade as Dead or Alive Ultimate that revamped the Saturn version for Xbox,

1138
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:12,620
along with the updated Dead or Alive 2 in the same packaging.

1139
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:18,540
And so they just made the graphics smoother, changed the sound from stereo to surround,

1140
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:20,940
and let you play with Xbox Live Online gaming.

1141
01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:29,260
Um, and so this was actually this and Dead or Alive 2 became the second fighting game

1142
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:30,300
with online play.

1143
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:32,220
And that's it.

1144
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:34,700
All right.

1145
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:35,740
Dead or Alive.

1146
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:37,980
Don't have to be confused with that really gross horror movie.

1147
01:28:38,860 --> 01:28:40,700
Or, you know, You Spin Me Right Round.

1148
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,100
Although that is a great song.

1149
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:43,740
It is.

1150
01:28:43,740 --> 01:28:45,980
There's a really good mashup of that and Danny Minogue.

1151
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:47,980
I think I've heard that before.

1152
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:48,300
Yep.

1153
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:49,020
Come to think of it.

1154
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:49,260
All right.

1155
01:28:49,260 --> 01:28:49,660
There it is.

1156
01:28:49,660 --> 01:28:51,420
Your classic game of the week.

1157
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:58,300
Dead or Alive, a game that admittedly I did not play enough of, I think, when I was younger.

1158
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:02,060
So I'll have to go back and check that out on Jamie's request.

1159
01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:03,580
Do you have a system I can play it on, Jamie?

1160
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:06,140
Uh, I think.

1161
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:07,180
Yeah, somewhere.

1162
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:08,700
You want to know what, though?

1163
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:17,100
If any woman out there wants to imagine what it's like to be a character in Dead or Alive,

1164
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:18,540
take off your bra and go for a jog.

1165
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:20,780
Imagine that while you're just standing still.

1166
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:25,660
I wouldn't recommend it.

1167
01:29:27,980 --> 01:29:32,460
Thank you, Tecmo, for unrealistic expectations.

1168
01:29:33,340 --> 01:29:35,820
Please don't make our don't mod our women nude.

1169
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:39,180
Is this something you've tried at some point in your life, Dark Sakura?

1170
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:40,540
You know what?

1171
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:43,100
It's just you don't know.

1172
01:29:43,900 --> 01:29:46,780
I'm not even going to talk about it because you guys will never know

1173
01:29:47,740 --> 01:29:49,340
the pain that we go through.

1174
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:51,260
Guys are wimps compared to girls.

1175
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:54,460
Our insides attack us every month.

1176
01:29:56,460 --> 01:30:01,740
We have huge weights on the front of our upper bodies that make our backs hurt.

1177
01:30:02,620 --> 01:30:05,580
And on top of that, them bitches out there are making babies.

1178
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:06,300
Try that once.

1179
01:30:07,180 --> 01:30:07,740
Can't do it.

1180
01:30:08,540 --> 01:30:09,180
All right.

1181
01:30:09,180 --> 01:30:09,580
All right.

1182
01:30:10,220 --> 01:30:13,420
We are going to, uh, we're going to stop there and take a break.

1183
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:17,820
Uh, before we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio after a quick break.

1184
01:30:17,820 --> 01:30:21,500
And when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, uh, we will get into some rapid

1185
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:22,380
fire news.

1186
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:27,740
Uh, we'll get to the Fugu question of the week, uh, our emails, um, some news, uh, some

1187
01:30:27,740 --> 01:30:32,540
follow-up to some last week's news and, uh, somebody getting their just desserts.

1188
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:34,380
And I like hearing about this type of stuff.

1189
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:37,820
And maybe we'll get Dark Sakura to talk about boobies more.

1190
01:30:37,820 --> 01:30:38,300
We'll try.

1191
01:30:39,340 --> 01:30:39,820
I'm kidding.

1192
01:30:39,820 --> 01:30:40,300
I'm kidding.

1193
01:30:40,300 --> 01:30:40,540
All right.

1194
01:30:41,180 --> 01:30:41,420
What?

1195
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:43,260
You guys have boobs too.

1196
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:44,300
That is true.

1197
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:44,540
Okay.

1198
01:30:44,540 --> 01:30:45,900
I can talk about boobs if you want.

1199
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:47,740
All right.

1200
01:30:47,740 --> 01:30:51,900
We'll be back after a break with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

1201
01:30:58,460 --> 01:31:05,340
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live here at vognetwork.com for this number

1202
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:10,700
586 episode, February the 8th of 2015.

1203
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:15,820
And, uh, we're going to start off part B here with our newest segment here on the show.

1204
01:31:15,820 --> 01:31:18,300
We call it the forum follow-up.

1205
01:31:22,140 --> 01:31:29,340
Uh, every week we post some extended discussions from topics on our show over at forums.vognetwork.com

1206
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:33,500
and you can participate in these discussions and we follow up on some of the big discussions

1207
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:35,260
from last week right now.

1208
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:39,740
And, uh, I also kind of tried to guess what big things might come up this week.

1209
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:43,500
Cause after all over on the forums, you can post about whatever you want.

1210
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,500
You don't have to wait for me to post.

1211
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:49,100
You can post something and then maybe it will get picked up here on the show.

1212
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:50,540
So let's get to it.

1213
01:31:50,540 --> 01:31:55,900
A follow-up post on the Nintendo let's play revenue sharing, which for obvious reasons

1214
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:57,260
was a hot topic last week.

1215
01:31:57,260 --> 01:31:59,420
I think we have an email coming up on it tonight as well.

1216
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:03,660
There's obviously a lot of opinions on Nintendo's let's play and the revenue share program.

1217
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:08,220
A rebel romance over on our forum said, I don't see Nintendo as a bad guy here.

1218
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:09,340
Do they need the money?

1219
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:13,660
Probably not, but if someone is making a profit off of something that they created, then I

1220
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:15,340
feel royalty should be paid.

1221
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:19,260
I think the music example is an excellent one, not just for licensing, but also for

1222
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:21,100
BMI, ASCAP, et cetera.

1223
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:25,740
These performance associations distribute royalties fairly when someone's work is played

1224
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:27,740
or being played as it were.

1225
01:32:27,740 --> 01:32:29,900
Maybe gaming needs some neutral ground like that.

1226
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:31,900
So everyone is protected and profiting.

1227
01:32:31,900 --> 01:32:33,820
I don't think the YouTube qualifies though.

1228
01:32:34,460 --> 01:32:40,140
And Act Deft on the same topic said, if something, a lot of the companies are making, let me

1229
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:41,100
start over, sorry.

1230
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:44,620
If something, a lot of the companies making strikes and copyright claims to people on

1231
01:32:44,620 --> 01:32:50,380
YouTube should follow Nintendo's example, work with the people, not against them.

1232
01:32:50,380 --> 01:32:54,220
Although following up to this was just kind of my own thought real quick.

1233
01:32:54,940 --> 01:32:57,420
It doesn't seem like Nintendo's solution is really working.

1234
01:32:58,300 --> 01:33:00,940
You know, A, it's too convoluted.

1235
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:06,700
B, they're having these problems where it's taking people way too long to sign up for

1236
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:06,940
them.

1237
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:10,540
It's putting really crazy restrictions on people's channel.

1238
01:33:11,420 --> 01:33:12,940
Nintendo's solution doesn't work.

1239
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:17,980
I still believe what I said last week, you know, not to rehash the whole debate, but

1240
01:33:17,980 --> 01:33:20,540
last week I said I believe Nintendo is owed a cut.

1241
01:33:20,540 --> 01:33:26,940
And I still do believe that, but this solution, particular one, isn't working for anybody

1242
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:29,820
and should probably just be put out to pasture already.

1243
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:33,180
But apparently it's really popular because nobody else can seem to sign up for it.

1244
01:33:33,180 --> 01:33:38,300
Maybe people are just excited because either A, they're like, hey, I didn't think to try

1245
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:40,540
and get money before, so now I'm going to try and do it.

1246
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:44,940
Or B, they just, I guess, want to sign up for Nintendo.

1247
01:33:44,940 --> 01:33:49,340
Maybe Nintendo is going to expose some of their partners and they'll have that official

1248
01:33:49,340 --> 01:33:49,820
tie in.

1249
01:33:49,820 --> 01:33:50,220
I don't know.

1250
01:33:51,180 --> 01:33:56,140
Anyhow, I knew the Legend of Zelda TV series and the Netflix thing, we talked about the

1251
01:33:56,140 --> 01:33:56,620
part of the show.

1252
01:33:56,620 --> 01:33:57,820
I knew that was going to be a huge topic.

1253
01:33:57,820 --> 01:34:00,220
So we had a post over on that on the forums as well.

1254
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:04,460
We had some follow-ups from Tigerclaw who said, I'm curious on how are they going to

1255
01:34:04,460 --> 01:34:07,580
cast Link as a kid, a teen or adult?

1256
01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:12,060
I heard the TV show is being described as a family-friendly Game of Thrones.

1257
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:14,700
By family-friendly, I would guess nobody dies.

1258
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:22,860
Well, now Tigerclaw, Bambi's mother died, so they could still do something if they wanted

1259
01:34:22,860 --> 01:34:23,420
to.

1260
01:34:23,420 --> 01:34:29,100
Uh, but I, I, I just, you know, again, when they say it's going to be like Game of Thrones,

1261
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:32,460
I think they just mean it's going to be a medieval fantasy and that's it.

1262
01:34:32,460 --> 01:34:34,780
I don't think you're going to see any, a lot of the other stuff.

1263
01:34:34,780 --> 01:34:38,140
And again, as I said earlier in the show, I don't necessarily think Link and Zelda are

1264
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:38,780
even a given.

1265
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:40,780
Why do they have to even be in it?

1266
01:34:40,780 --> 01:34:44,220
I mean, maybe Zelda could be in it because she is princess after all.

1267
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:49,900
But I mean, I don't know, like I just, how would the series go on and on and on?

1268
01:34:49,900 --> 01:34:50,700
What would continue it?

1269
01:34:50,700 --> 01:34:51,100
I don't know.

1270
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:55,500
I think there's a lot of things they could do with it, but it's just way too early.

1271
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:59,180
We don't even know if Netflix really got cast green lit, who knows?

1272
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:03,500
Flacco Jones says on the Legend of Zelda TV series,

1273
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:09,340
while I don't for a second think this rumor is true, I'll answer for the sake of participating.

1274
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:11,420
Netflix is throwing money around like crazy.

1275
01:35:11,420 --> 01:35:13,580
Nintendo would very much like more money.

1276
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:17,820
So if it is happening, which it isn't by the way, it's because Nintendo is getting a lot

1277
01:35:17,820 --> 01:35:20,940
of money and likely has a lot of creative control as well.

1278
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:24,060
As far as the quote, will this be good question?

1279
01:35:24,060 --> 01:35:26,060
You never know until you see the finished product.

1280
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:30,540
I'm like halfway through there Flacco, because I get why you're totally saying this is full

1281
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:31,420
of crap.

1282
01:35:31,420 --> 01:35:35,580
And I think people are jumping to conclusions for sure.

1283
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:38,380
But I also think there's an element of where there's smoke, there's fire.

1284
01:35:38,380 --> 01:35:41,020
And there is the Wall Street Journal reporting on this.

1285
01:35:41,020 --> 01:35:45,420
I'm sure someone at Netflix has loose lips about, you know, what's happening so that

1286
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:48,220
people will, you know, will hopefully invest in Netflix and so forth.

1287
01:35:48,300 --> 01:35:54,380
But again, all they could be shooting is a concept pilot to get Nintendo to sign off

1288
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:54,860
on it.

1289
01:35:54,860 --> 01:35:58,220
I mean, we don't even know if that partnership's really been established yet.

1290
01:35:58,220 --> 01:36:03,340
So anything is possible or perhaps it's true.

1291
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:05,900
And they're already run into series with this.

1292
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:06,540
Who knows?

1293
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:07,340
Who knows?

1294
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:11,260
But I kind of doubt that I'm kind of with you Flacco that this is not as far along,

1295
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:13,660
at least as people seem to think it is.

1296
01:36:13,660 --> 01:36:17,500
Anyway, those are some of the comments from our forums in the forum follow up.

1297
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:21,420
Let's go around now with some rapid fire news and quickly talk about a few more topics

1298
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:21,900
from the week.

1299
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:22,780
Loki.

1300
01:36:22,780 --> 01:36:23,180
All right.

1301
01:36:23,740 --> 01:36:31,420
So anyways, this is kind of a relief in case you may be on the fence about buying Final

1302
01:36:31,420 --> 01:36:34,300
Fantasy Type-O Square Enix.

1303
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:37,580
Apparently, I want to say they're going back on what they said originally.

1304
01:36:37,580 --> 01:36:43,580
Apparently, they're going to be releasing a Final Fantasy 15 demo alongside Type-O HD.

1305
01:36:43,580 --> 01:36:48,140
So you won't necessarily have to buy the game, I'm guessing.

1306
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:49,580
I like that you call it Type-O.

1307
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:53,180
I thought it was Type-0, but I kind of like Type-O.

1308
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:55,500
It's Final Fantasy Type-O.

1309
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:57,180
It's Final Fannery Type-O.

1310
01:36:58,700 --> 01:37:00,140
Or Dragon Quest Type-O.

1311
01:37:00,140 --> 01:37:00,620
There you go.

1312
01:37:01,420 --> 01:37:02,380
Final Fanta.

1313
01:37:02,380 --> 01:37:03,020
Great flavor.

1314
01:37:03,580 --> 01:37:05,420
Dagon Quest Type-O.

1315
01:37:07,580 --> 01:37:12,540
But if you want to play the demo first, then you'd want to buy the game because it's going

1316
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:20,060
to be released with Type-0 first, but then it'll be coming out later on.

1317
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:22,140
I don't know.

1318
01:37:22,140 --> 01:37:22,780
It's kind of nice.

1319
01:37:23,980 --> 01:37:25,820
I'm not sure if I'd like Type-0.

1320
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:28,460
I'll buy it because it's Final Fantasy, though.

1321
01:37:28,460 --> 01:37:31,420
Yeah, I'm going to buy it just because it's Final Fantasy and I have a problem.

1322
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:35,820
And I'm really looking forward to that demo, that's for sure.

1323
01:37:35,820 --> 01:37:36,380
Yeah.

1324
01:37:36,380 --> 01:37:37,100
So this is pretty cool.

1325
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:43,980
There's a Kickstarter for a game called Drift Stage, which is this retro-styled drift racing

1326
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:52,780
game, and it looks all neon and kind of 80s-looking stuff, almost like an old early polygon arcade

1327
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:53,580
racing game.

1328
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:58,460
Well, they finally hit their stretch goal for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita versions

1329
01:37:58,460 --> 01:38:00,300
of the game, which is awesome.

1330
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:05,340
It's also going to come out on Windows, Mac, and Linux, but they're saying that...

1331
01:38:07,820 --> 01:38:09,340
That should be coming out next year.

1332
01:38:09,340 --> 01:38:10,460
So that's pretty awesome.

1333
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:11,900
And the game looks really sweet.

1334
01:38:11,900 --> 01:38:13,580
And I guess their Kickstarter just ended.

1335
01:38:13,580 --> 01:38:18,540
I think they had like $50,000 of their $30,000 goal, so that's pretty cool.

1336
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:19,040
Nice.

1337
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:28,060
And then they're going to have Boku special editions for Mortal Kombat X, and including...

1338
01:38:28,060 --> 01:38:31,740
They've got everything from...

1339
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:33,260
What's the most expensive one here?

1340
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:36,300
Up to $179.99.

1341
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:42,860
So for starting off with the cheapest one, $89.99, the Mortal Kombat X Premium Edition,

1342
01:38:42,860 --> 01:38:48,860
which will be available download only, includes the Kombat Pack and the game.

1343
01:38:49,580 --> 01:38:51,340
What the fuck is the Kombat Pack?

1344
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:53,500
I have no idea.

1345
01:38:53,500 --> 01:39:00,220
Oh, four additional add-on playable characters from classic combatants to icon guest characters.

1346
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:05,180
Are we going to see more like, you know, Jason Voorhees and stuff in this?

1347
01:39:05,180 --> 01:39:06,620
Because that was pretty awesome last time.

1348
01:39:06,620 --> 01:39:08,380
Those were some awesome crossovers.

1349
01:39:08,380 --> 01:39:09,580
Freddy Krueger.

1350
01:39:09,580 --> 01:39:10,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1351
01:39:10,460 --> 01:39:12,060
So yeah, I'd love to see Jason or...

1352
01:39:14,380 --> 01:39:17,020
I keep wanting to say Bruce Campbell, but that's not the character's name.

1353
01:39:17,020 --> 01:39:20,220
You know, it's Ash from Evil Dead.

1354
01:39:20,220 --> 01:39:21,580
Yeah, it'd be awesome.

1355
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:28,620
And then, of course, the next step up would be the Mortal Kombat X Limited Edition,

1356
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:35,180
which includes, you know, an exclusive Scorpion skin designed and inspired by the Cold War,

1357
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:41,340
I guess, and then the Kombat Pack, and that's coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

1358
01:39:41,340 --> 01:39:44,380
which will be $94.99 for that one.

1359
01:39:44,380 --> 01:39:47,420
Then if you want to spend even more money and need a statue,

1360
01:39:47,420 --> 01:39:50,860
they're going to have the Mortal Kombat X Collector's Edition with a K,

1361
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:56,060
because it's Mortal Kombat, and they've got an exclusive Scorpion figure,

1362
01:39:56,780 --> 01:40:04,460
and the skin, the Kombat Pack, and that'll be out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One for $149.99.

1363
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:09,180
Then there's even one further beyond that that'll be exclusive to Amazon,

1364
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:15,260
and I think for Europe, and that's also the Collector's Edition over there,

1365
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:19,660
and they have the statue, the Mortal Kombat X Blood Ties comic book volume one,

1366
01:40:20,380 --> 01:40:23,660
skin, the Kombat Pack, and all the other fun stuff for $179.99.

1367
01:40:23,660 --> 01:40:24,620
That's just way too much.

1368
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:30,140
Fifth Dream in chat talking about Mortal Kombat X over at live.vognetwork.com says,

1369
01:40:30,140 --> 01:40:33,340
Katniss Everdeen and Mortal Kombat X, you heard it here first.

1370
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:37,020
I don't know, I think I realize those movies are kind of violent,

1371
01:40:37,020 --> 01:40:39,260
but I think Mortal Kombat X might be too violent.

1372
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:42,140
They're still PG-13 films, are they not?

1373
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:44,300
So it might not work.

1374
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:47,260
What would be a good guest character for Mortal Kombat?

1375
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:51,420
I don't know.

1376
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:52,780
Mama from Mama's Family.

1377
01:40:56,060 --> 01:40:57,500
She just hit people with her purse.

1378
01:40:58,540 --> 01:40:59,040
Wow.

1379
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:01,820
Didn't we do a list list on this once a long time ago?

1380
01:41:01,820 --> 01:41:03,100
We had to have, I don't know.

1381
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:03,740
I know.

1382
01:41:03,740 --> 01:41:05,340
Flo from Mel's Diner.

1383
01:41:05,340 --> 01:41:05,740
All right.

1384
01:41:05,740 --> 01:41:07,340
She'd kiss them with her grits.

1385
01:41:07,340 --> 01:41:08,700
Anyway, let's move on.

1386
01:41:09,340 --> 01:41:12,060
Speaking of classic nostalgia, I think this is interesting.

1387
01:41:12,060 --> 01:41:15,820
Apparently a new Toejam and Earl game is actually in development.

1388
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:19,500
Now, I don't, I'm a little confused at this because I thought we just had

1389
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:21,820
really bad news about Sega last week.

1390
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:24,380
So how could there be a new Toejam and Earl game unless,

1391
01:41:24,380 --> 01:41:27,420
I guess the license has been, you know, maybe to try and get some money back.

1392
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:29,740
Maybe they let this license out to somebody else.

1393
01:41:29,740 --> 01:41:30,540
I don't know.

1394
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:35,660
But, uh, yeah, apparently, uh, there's been some, uh, uh, content released

1395
01:41:35,660 --> 01:41:39,420
from the developers, some concept art, uh, for what this Toejam and Earl

1396
01:41:39,420 --> 01:41:42,540
might look like, but, uh, God, it's been so long since the original.

1397
01:41:42,540 --> 01:41:43,040
I don't know.

1398
01:41:43,580 --> 01:41:44,380
Could, could be interesting.

1399
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:44,780
Could be interesting.

1400
01:41:44,780 --> 01:41:45,580
Would anyone care?

1401
01:41:46,940 --> 01:41:49,500
I think there'd be a lot of people checking it out for the curiosity factor.

1402
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:49,980
Yeah.

1403
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:50,780
Beyond that though.

1404
01:41:50,780 --> 01:41:53,260
I mean, I just, I don't know.

1405
01:41:53,260 --> 01:41:54,700
Well, if the, if the game is good.

1406
01:41:54,700 --> 01:41:56,860
Just don't fuck it up like you did Sonic.

1407
01:41:56,860 --> 01:41:57,260
Okay.

1408
01:41:57,260 --> 01:41:58,060
That's all I gotta say.

1409
01:41:58,060 --> 01:42:00,140
Just don't fuck it up like you did Sonic.

1410
01:42:00,140 --> 01:42:03,580
Uh, well, I don't, I don't think it's Sega doing it cause, uh, things are

1411
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:06,060
changing over at Sega as we talked about last week.

1412
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:06,380
All right.

1413
01:42:06,380 --> 01:42:09,100
And fifth dream in chat says the people who created it are still around.

1414
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:12,140
So maybe it went back to the original developers and just be published by

1415
01:42:12,140 --> 01:42:14,140
somebody else who knows anyhow.

1416
01:42:14,140 --> 01:42:19,340
Um, speaking of, uh, publishing something old, new again, this is very interesting.

1417
01:42:19,340 --> 01:42:24,380
Um, if you are a Blizzard fan, you probably have a copy of Starcraft two

1418
01:42:24,380 --> 01:42:27,900
because you know, Blizzard or you love your Starcraft, but you know, Starcraft

1419
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:31,020
kind of has its roots in the Warcraft universe.

1420
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:34,380
Warcraft is obviously something very different now with World of Warcraft.

1421
01:42:34,380 --> 01:42:38,140
Although I think there's a lot of people hoping someday for a Warcraft four.

1422
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:42,780
But what's very interesting is that now Warcraft three models are

1423
01:42:42,780 --> 01:42:44,860
available in Starcraft two.

1424
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:49,500
And if you didn't know, Starcraft two has this huge arcade area where

1425
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:50,940
people can make their own games.

1426
01:42:50,940 --> 01:42:53,820
And I know I've talked at length on the show before about some of the games I

1427
01:42:53,820 --> 01:42:55,100
enjoy in the Starcraft arcade.

1428
01:42:55,100 --> 01:42:57,260
Like star jeweled is my personal favorite.

1429
01:42:57,260 --> 01:42:58,700
It's bejeweled mix of Starcraft.

1430
01:42:58,700 --> 01:42:59,500
It's fun.

1431
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:04,700
Um, but now you'll be able to make a games with Warcraft three characters

1432
01:43:04,700 --> 01:43:06,140
in the Starcraft arcade.

1433
01:43:06,140 --> 01:43:12,060
So I would think you could essentially remake Warcraft three or even fricking

1434
01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:16,540
defense of the ancients, which is the mod that brought us legal legends,

1435
01:43:16,540 --> 01:43:18,460
dota two heroes of the storm.

1436
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:21,340
All of that is to thank from elite defense of the ancients.

1437
01:43:21,980 --> 01:43:24,380
You could see all that in Starcraft two's arcade now.

1438
01:43:24,380 --> 01:43:26,380
So that's a, it's going to be very interesting.

1439
01:43:27,020 --> 01:43:28,300
It's on the PTR now.

1440
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:29,420
So enjoy that.

1441
01:43:31,180 --> 01:43:33,020
One more piece of news here.

1442
01:43:33,020 --> 01:43:35,980
I know some people very excited about music games.

1443
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:38,620
Some people also very excited about persona.

1444
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:41,820
Well, there was some new information released on persona this week.

1445
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:44,380
There was a new trailer for persona five for one.

1446
01:43:44,380 --> 01:43:47,260
And I know that's got a lot of people excited, especially those that are super

1447
01:43:47,260 --> 01:43:52,380
into the persona games, uh, but also of particular interest, let's not forget

1448
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:55,180
about the persona for dancing all night.

1449
01:43:55,180 --> 01:43:55,820
Thank you very much.

1450
01:43:55,820 --> 01:43:58,140
That's the music game that's coming out as well.

1451
01:43:58,140 --> 01:44:01,580
And you know, there's a lot of songs that are in this, of course, you know,

1452
01:44:01,580 --> 01:44:02,140
persona.

1453
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:05,740
Remember if you played this game, even though it's like a JRPG, it has very

1454
01:44:05,740 --> 01:44:08,780
kind of like modern sounding music that makes up the soundtrack.

1455
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:12,140
So some of that is in the game, but there's a lot of remixes

1456
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:13,340
that are in the game.

1457
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:17,660
Of particular note, there's a song called time to make history, which

1458
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:22,540
will have the Akira Yamaoka remix in persona for dancing all night.

1459
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:26,780
Also a heartbreak heartbreak from Tawatay.

1460
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:27,900
You guys know him as Tawatay, right?

1461
01:44:27,900 --> 01:44:29,660
He was like a huge remixer years ago.

1462
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:30,540
Probably still does.

1463
01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:33,740
He was a part of, um, group is in the heart.

1464
01:44:33,740 --> 01:44:34,240
D-Light.

1465
01:44:34,860 --> 01:44:36,380
Remember that with Lady Miss Kira.

1466
01:44:37,420 --> 01:44:38,540
Tawatay was a part of that group.

1467
01:44:38,620 --> 01:44:41,180
So he also has a remix in the game there, but Akira Yamaoka.

1468
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:42,780
So there you go.

1469
01:44:43,340 --> 01:44:45,980
That means I have to have this game like forever, right?

1470
01:44:45,980 --> 01:44:47,900
It's like, if you weren't convinced now, now you are.

1471
01:44:48,540 --> 01:44:49,020
There it is.

1472
01:44:49,660 --> 01:44:50,300
Dark Sakura.

1473
01:44:50,300 --> 01:44:51,020
What do you have for us?

1474
01:44:51,900 --> 01:44:52,400
Stuff.

1475
01:44:53,260 --> 01:44:56,700
Well, uh, this is like, I guess the Kickstarter thing is just getting

1476
01:44:56,700 --> 01:44:59,020
bigger and bigger, but this one is really good.

1477
01:45:00,060 --> 01:45:06,620
There is a Kickstarter, uh, floating around to, uh, help, uh, basically get,

1478
01:45:06,620 --> 01:45:11,420
um, a new, uh, uh, DJ Max Technica out and about.

1479
01:45:12,140 --> 01:45:17,740
Um, they're wanting to put out, uh, something to the range of 30 to 40 units.

1480
01:45:17,740 --> 01:45:20,780
And so they are looking to the fan base.

1481
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:25,420
So you can actually find a trailer for this called, uh, Touching Sounds.

1482
01:45:25,420 --> 01:45:28,780
So keep your eyes open for that or hanging out on Kickstarter.

1483
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:34,700
And also, uh, something about, uh, Hironobu Sakaguchi who, you know,

1484
01:45:34,700 --> 01:45:40,380
created Final Fantasy, he's going to be getting a, uh, a lifetime, uh, sorry,

1485
01:45:40,380 --> 01:45:43,580
a game developer's choice award for lifetime achievement.

1486
01:45:43,580 --> 01:45:47,020
And I'd say very, very well deserved.

1487
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:53,100
And last but not least, yay, happy news.

1488
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:53,900
Yay.

1489
01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:55,180
Well, kind of yay.

1490
01:45:55,180 --> 01:45:58,700
Um, Leland, he can't, can't learn.

1491
01:45:58,700 --> 01:45:59,580
He really can't.

1492
01:46:01,740 --> 01:46:03,580
We all know all the shit he's done, right?

1493
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:07,580
Well, they, uh, uh, revised-

1494
01:46:07,580 --> 01:46:12,540
In case people forgot, there was the whole, uh, he was a huge voice behind

1495
01:46:12,540 --> 01:46:14,460
the whole video games are too violent.

1496
01:46:14,460 --> 01:46:19,660
He led that campaign to try and make, uh, retailers have to-

1497
01:46:19,660 --> 01:46:21,020
God, I don't even remember all the details.

1498
01:46:21,020 --> 01:46:22,060
It was so long ago.

1499
01:46:22,060 --> 01:46:28,460
It was about, uh, you could, you could only sell games that had certain content in it.

1500
01:46:28,460 --> 01:46:30,380
You had to like ID people basically.

1501
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:35,420
But the fact of what is adult content was so vague that there was a lot of problems

1502
01:46:35,420 --> 01:46:38,940
with it and it ended up going all the way to the Supreme court in California, spent

1503
01:46:38,940 --> 01:46:44,140
a lot of money, wasted it basically defending this law where, you know, parents need to

1504
01:46:44,140 --> 01:46:47,260
take the active role in what their kids are playing anyway.

1505
01:46:47,260 --> 01:46:49,020
So Leland, he was a huge part of this.

1506
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:51,020
And then behind the story, he was trafficking guns.

1507
01:46:51,660 --> 01:46:57,100
Well, apart from that, they've, uh, the big indictment on this is that he was

1508
01:46:57,100 --> 01:47:02,620
allegedly depositing checks from criminal enterprises for secretary of state campaign

1509
01:47:02,620 --> 01:47:05,820
fund, which even more.

1510
01:47:06,380 --> 01:47:10,540
So he's pleaded non guilty, first of all, not guilty.

1511
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:15,500
And, um, he is going to be going to federal trial on June 22nd.

1512
01:47:16,300 --> 01:47:18,540
Jury selection begins on June 1st.

1513
01:47:18,540 --> 01:47:24,860
A pretrial hearing is April 30th and, uh, he's being tried for 13 different counts.

1514
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:27,260
So you know what?

1515
01:47:28,060 --> 01:47:31,100
I want him nailed, nailed.

1516
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:36,540
He's going to be put away for a long, long time, I think.

1517
01:47:36,540 --> 01:47:38,940
Except he's going to buy his way out of jail and only serve a year.

1518
01:47:38,940 --> 01:47:44,780
Whereas there's rapists out there who, uh, you know, also only get a year, but you have

1519
01:47:44,780 --> 01:47:48,140
people who are smoking pot, who were in jail for 30 years, you know, just saying.

1520
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:50,140
All right.

1521
01:47:50,140 --> 01:47:51,100
Justice America.

1522
01:47:51,980 --> 01:47:55,500
Well, let's do some justice to our listener feedback in a segment.

1523
01:47:55,500 --> 01:47:57,340
We call you like that transition in the same way.

1524
01:47:57,340 --> 01:48:01,420
We call the frugal question of the week, where we take Facebook and Google plus and put it

1525
01:48:01,420 --> 01:48:02,780
together and you get frugal.

1526
01:48:10,300 --> 01:48:14,860
We're going to hand on over to our communities where we ask a question every week and read

1527
01:48:14,860 --> 01:48:17,020
some of our favorite answers here on the show.

1528
01:48:17,020 --> 01:48:19,580
And this week has to do with modding.

1529
01:48:19,580 --> 01:48:23,500
After all, Dark Soccer read us that story earlier about the Dead or Alive 5.

1530
01:48:23,500 --> 01:48:27,100
And please, please don't mod this game on PC.

1531
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:32,460
If you have bad moral choices, please, please don't do immoral things to our characters.

1532
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:33,660
Yeah, right.

1533
01:48:33,660 --> 01:48:37,900
So we want to ask our listeners, look, have you ever used a controversial mod?

1534
01:48:37,900 --> 01:48:42,380
I don't just mean nudity, but you know, nudity, super cheating, something that altered the

1535
01:48:42,380 --> 01:48:45,980
game in a way that the creators probably didn't want you to do.

1536
01:48:46,060 --> 01:48:47,900
What was the mod and why?

1537
01:48:48,700 --> 01:48:51,500
Loki's laughing over there every fucking day, right?

1538
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:55,260
Well, aren't you kidding?

1539
01:48:55,260 --> 01:48:57,820
Maybe, maybe the listeners know of some you haven't heard of yet.

1540
01:48:57,820 --> 01:48:59,900
So I bet you're excited to hear some of these answers, right?

1541
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:01,500
Of course.

1542
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:01,820
All right.

1543
01:49:01,820 --> 01:49:06,300
Let's start on Google plus tonight since I was horrible and neglected them a couple

1544
01:49:06,300 --> 01:49:06,700
of weeks ago.

1545
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:12,540
I'll start on Google plus tonight with Josh Y who replied, well, I didn't really use a

1546
01:49:12,540 --> 01:49:13,100
mod.

1547
01:49:13,100 --> 01:49:15,500
I had some fun with action replay.

1548
01:49:15,580 --> 01:49:17,820
It's the UK equivalent to a game shark.

1549
01:49:17,820 --> 01:49:19,900
It was super powerful on the Amiga.

1550
01:49:19,900 --> 01:49:22,300
It even had a D compiler.

1551
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:23,260
Oh yes.

1552
01:49:23,260 --> 01:49:26,300
Decompiling games is something I'm sure they don't want you to do.

1553
01:49:27,900 --> 01:49:28,940
I don't think they do.

1554
01:49:28,940 --> 01:49:33,580
I don't even mind the action replay did evolve and come out for other systems in the US.

1555
01:49:33,580 --> 01:49:37,580
Yeah, we did get it in the US, but it was how else did I play my Saturn games?

1556
01:49:37,580 --> 01:49:38,080
Yeah.

1557
01:49:38,620 --> 01:49:39,420
Uh, let's see.

1558
01:49:39,980 --> 01:49:45,420
Uh, I'm always afraid I'm saying this name wrong, but Martin D replied and said,

1559
01:49:45,980 --> 01:49:49,900
I tried the hot coffee mod for grand theft auto San Andreas, but it was just a silly

1560
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:50,620
mini game.

1561
01:49:50,620 --> 01:49:54,140
And I doubt the creators didn't intend for that content to be found because the code

1562
01:49:54,140 --> 01:49:56,300
was in there in the first place.

1563
01:49:56,300 --> 01:49:57,740
People can mod whatever they want.

1564
01:49:57,740 --> 01:49:58,700
It's just a video game.

1565
01:49:58,700 --> 01:50:00,300
People OMG boobs.

1566
01:50:01,100 --> 01:50:06,220
And I imagine Martin is probably, I think if I remember right, he's one of our listeners

1567
01:50:06,220 --> 01:50:07,420
over in Belgium.

1568
01:50:07,420 --> 01:50:10,860
And if I am correct, what?

1569
01:50:10,860 --> 01:50:12,460
I think it's just Martin.

1570
01:50:12,460 --> 01:50:13,580
Is it Martin?

1571
01:50:13,580 --> 01:50:14,300
Okay.

1572
01:50:14,300 --> 01:50:18,780
He's, uh, over the, the double a throws me and I'm thinking, but I'm probably overthinking

1573
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:19,100
it.

1574
01:50:19,100 --> 01:50:22,700
So anyway, uh, he's over in Belgium and my understanding is over there.

1575
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:26,620
Boobies ain't no big deal is no big deal.

1576
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:27,900
Is no big deal.

1577
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:28,540
Right.

1578
01:50:28,540 --> 01:50:28,860
All right.

1579
01:50:29,500 --> 01:50:34,940
Anyhow, uh, entertainment replied and said, I used action replay game, shark game, genies

1580
01:50:34,940 --> 01:50:39,260
and other devices like that until the console manufacturers found a way to disable such

1581
01:50:39,260 --> 01:50:40,140
devices.

1582
01:50:40,140 --> 01:50:44,220
I've also used game save manipulation programs to give me a fuck ton of experience in MLB

1583
01:50:44,780 --> 01:50:46,620
2k 11 and final fantasy 13.

1584
01:50:46,620 --> 01:50:51,820
I had limited results with fantasy 13, but I had fabulous results with MLB 2k 11.

1585
01:50:51,820 --> 01:50:55,260
I was like playing with a baseball player who took steroids.

1586
01:50:55,260 --> 01:50:57,180
Well, that's cheating entertainment.

1587
01:50:57,180 --> 01:50:57,500
All right.

1588
01:50:59,020 --> 01:51:01,980
Let's get some of our answers over on Facebook.

1589
01:51:01,980 --> 01:51:07,900
Andy R says for a while I had mods for league of legends that only changed character skins.

1590
01:51:07,900 --> 01:51:09,980
The skins were only client side.

1591
01:51:09,980 --> 01:51:12,060
For example, I was the only one that saw them.

1592
01:51:12,060 --> 01:51:17,580
But given that Riot sells skins for the game, they ended up killing those mods in later

1593
01:51:17,580 --> 01:51:18,060
patches.

1594
01:51:18,620 --> 01:51:21,900
Yeah, selling you skins is part of how they keep the game free to play.

1595
01:51:21,900 --> 01:51:25,180
It's they probably don't like, even if it's only you, they probably don't like that you

1596
01:51:25,180 --> 01:51:26,300
were able to change that.

1597
01:51:26,300 --> 01:51:27,580
And it's, uh, it's interesting.

1598
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:33,580
Uh, Alan Alchemy replied and said, I almost find this story beneath notice due to the

1599
01:51:33,580 --> 01:51:34,940
studio bringing it up.

1600
01:51:34,940 --> 01:51:39,660
Do they know what the stock swimsuits you can unlock in Dua volleyball party look like?

1601
01:51:39,660 --> 01:51:43,980
But anyway, yes, I've used nude and sex mods for both Dragon Age Origins and Skyrim, the

1602
01:51:43,980 --> 01:51:48,780
latter of which has mods for scalable dong size with real time flop physics for when

1603
01:51:48,780 --> 01:51:50,060
you run in the nude.

1604
01:51:50,060 --> 01:51:50,860
Wow.

1605
01:51:50,860 --> 01:51:54,140
Mostly I run these for the comedy factor and just to see how they look.

1606
01:51:54,140 --> 01:51:56,700
90% of them get uninstalled after messing with them.

1607
01:51:56,700 --> 01:52:01,420
The ones I keep are largely skimpy, sexed up, super impractical armors.

1608
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:05,900
You know, like what the Dua women wear in the retail release for the dudes.

1609
01:52:05,900 --> 01:52:10,220
Because as a gay man and a PC owner, I feel I should be able to tailor my fantasy setting

1610
01:52:10,220 --> 01:52:14,140
as I see fit and a little male exploitation to balance the scales a bit.

1611
01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:15,740
Can't be a bad thing, right?

1612
01:52:15,740 --> 01:52:17,740
Well, whatever helps me sleep at night, I guess.

1613
01:52:20,220 --> 01:52:23,020
Dark soccer does male exploitation help you sleep at night?

1614
01:52:23,020 --> 01:52:23,420
Oh yeah.

1615
01:52:24,460 --> 01:52:25,980
Gives me some really good dreams there.

1616
01:52:25,980 --> 01:52:28,380
Do you think, do you think about it before you go to bed every night?

1617
01:52:29,580 --> 01:52:34,140
For the record, I have done exactly some of those same mods because it's absolutely ridiculous

1618
01:52:34,140 --> 01:52:35,420
to watch the dong cup.

1619
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:37,980
Have you ever done a nude Garris?

1620
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:38,380
Admit it.

1621
01:52:38,380 --> 01:52:39,980
Have you ever actually haven't.

1622
01:52:39,980 --> 01:52:40,620
Okay.

1623
01:52:40,620 --> 01:52:48,940
But you know, Turian skin did exist as a model for when they were developing mass effect.

1624
01:52:48,940 --> 01:52:51,340
It's just, they never actually implemented in the game.

1625
01:52:51,340 --> 01:52:53,420
But when they first did the character designs, they had

1626
01:52:54,220 --> 01:52:57,580
naked Turians just saying, just saying.

1627
01:52:57,580 --> 01:52:58,220
All right.

1628
01:52:58,220 --> 01:53:01,900
Jason C replied and said, I definitely use character skin mods in Skyrim.

1629
01:53:01,900 --> 01:53:05,580
Bethesda makes some of the ugliest character models around and it was really distracting

1630
01:53:05,580 --> 01:53:07,740
and hard to enjoy a game that looks so awful.

1631
01:53:08,620 --> 01:53:12,460
A surfing Slurpee replied and said the DOA producer should be more concerned with mods

1632
01:53:12,460 --> 01:53:15,820
that give unfair advantage in multiplayer, not cosmetic ones.

1633
01:53:15,820 --> 01:53:18,300
Modding the game to see boobies or dongs isn't immoral.

1634
01:53:18,300 --> 01:53:20,380
It's just for fun, not titillation.

1635
01:53:20,380 --> 01:53:23,980
I've only used mods in wow to supplement poor UI design.

1636
01:53:23,980 --> 01:53:26,860
The thing though with wow is that they really encourage it in wow.

1637
01:53:26,860 --> 01:53:28,620
That's why I kind of didn't name them in the post.

1638
01:53:28,620 --> 01:53:32,060
But I mean, I've used, I've certainly used mods in wow too.

1639
01:53:32,060 --> 01:53:35,100
And there have been things in wow that they didn't like.

1640
01:53:35,900 --> 01:53:40,300
Like there was one where you could like draw on the ground and they shut that one down.

1641
01:53:40,300 --> 01:53:41,500
Blizzard didn't like that.

1642
01:53:41,500 --> 01:53:45,420
So I guess, I guess even though wow embraces mods, there have been some naughty ones.

1643
01:53:46,140 --> 01:53:50,220
On a side note, says surfing Slurpee, who cares about DOA?

1644
01:53:50,220 --> 01:53:53,660
I've only briefly played a DOA title on a PS2.

1645
01:53:53,660 --> 01:53:57,660
Seems to me that Tecmo is trying to stir up some publicity for a stale franchise.

1646
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:02,940
Save your money for Mortal Kombat X, uppercuts to the crotch for the win.

1647
01:54:04,300 --> 01:54:07,580
Ragenator says, I can't say that I've ever modded a game.

1648
01:54:07,580 --> 01:54:09,420
I have no real interest in doing so.

1649
01:54:10,220 --> 01:54:13,900
Ragenator, even after all the booby and dong talk tonight, no interest at all?

1650
01:54:13,900 --> 01:54:14,460
No, it's okay.

1651
01:54:14,460 --> 01:54:17,180
He wants the swollen balls mod.

1652
01:54:17,180 --> 01:54:17,900
You know what?

1653
01:54:17,900 --> 01:54:21,180
Outside of MMOs, I don't ever really do it either.

1654
01:54:21,180 --> 01:54:25,420
Like I'll look over, I'll look over my shoulder and I'll see Alan like with his dong mod in

1655
01:54:25,420 --> 01:54:27,180
Skyrim and I'll have a laugh and whatever.

1656
01:54:27,260 --> 01:54:29,180
But then I just go right back to whatever I was doing.

1657
01:54:29,180 --> 01:54:31,420
Like I don't, I don't really get too hardcore in that stuff.

1658
01:54:31,420 --> 01:54:33,500
You know, I modded the hell out of Mass Effect.

1659
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:34,700
Well, yeah.

1660
01:54:34,700 --> 01:54:37,740
And now that I think about it, he, but I made Alan do it for me.

1661
01:54:37,740 --> 01:54:41,500
So Alan potted it, but he showed me the HD textures.

1662
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:42,460
He showed me the HD textures.

1663
01:54:42,460 --> 01:54:43,660
And wasn't it worth it?

1664
01:54:43,660 --> 01:54:44,460
It was kind of worth it.

1665
01:54:44,460 --> 01:54:45,420
Have you ever fly cammed?

1666
01:54:46,060 --> 01:54:46,780
No, never done that.

1667
01:54:46,780 --> 01:54:49,100
Fly cam's pretty cool because you can find some interesting stuff.

1668
01:54:49,100 --> 01:54:49,600
I bet.

1669
01:54:50,540 --> 01:54:51,260
I bet.

1670
01:54:51,260 --> 01:54:55,340
Didn't you have some Tumblr posts of a fly cam thing that went like huge?

1671
01:54:55,980 --> 01:54:56,860
I did.

1672
01:54:56,860 --> 01:55:03,180
It was a picture on the refrigerator in the Normandy and Mass Effect 2 that has a picture

1673
01:55:03,180 --> 01:55:08,940
of, it has the, the circle with the slash on it on a Turian's head and guns.

1674
01:55:08,940 --> 01:55:12,700
So all I did was put a big catch on it that said no Turians, no guns.

1675
01:55:14,380 --> 01:55:15,260
900 posts.

1676
01:55:15,900 --> 01:55:17,420
Like the fuck Tumblr?

1677
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:18,220
Tumblr is weird.

1678
01:55:18,220 --> 01:55:19,020
All right.

1679
01:55:19,020 --> 01:55:23,340
Well that one, and I had the other one that was this one's intimate apparel.

1680
01:55:24,220 --> 01:55:26,220
That was a Hanar sex shop.

1681
01:55:26,220 --> 01:55:26,780
I remember that one.

1682
01:55:26,780 --> 01:55:28,220
Yeah, the Hanar sex shop.

1683
01:55:28,220 --> 01:55:29,660
Only see it if you fly cam.

1684
01:55:31,100 --> 01:55:33,100
It's probably, there's probably a reason for that.

1685
01:55:33,100 --> 01:55:36,860
Anyway, Fifth Dream in chat says, first thing I do when I play, I'm sorry, not chat, uh,

1686
01:55:36,860 --> 01:55:41,980
on Facebook says, first thing I do when I play a Sims game is remove the sensor mosaic.

1687
01:55:41,980 --> 01:55:43,340
It's just super distracting.

1688
01:55:43,340 --> 01:55:44,620
Oh my God, me too.

1689
01:55:44,620 --> 01:55:46,300
I don't care if they look like Barbie dolls.

1690
01:55:46,300 --> 01:55:47,180
It's just so much better.

1691
01:55:48,220 --> 01:55:50,300
I want to watch my Sims taking a piss.

1692
01:55:50,300 --> 01:55:50,940
Just saying.

1693
01:55:50,940 --> 01:55:53,180
Ew, what kind of weird?

1694
01:55:53,180 --> 01:55:53,660
What?

1695
01:55:53,660 --> 01:55:55,500
Did you just say that on the radio?

1696
01:55:56,860 --> 01:56:00,620
I was being facetious.

1697
01:56:00,620 --> 01:56:01,100
Oh my God.

1698
01:56:01,100 --> 01:56:03,180
Travis Donovan is cutting that clip right now.

1699
01:56:06,700 --> 01:56:07,340
Sarcasm.

1700
01:56:07,340 --> 01:56:07,820
Hello?

1701
01:56:07,820 --> 01:56:08,380
I know.

1702
01:56:08,380 --> 01:56:08,780
I know.

1703
01:56:08,780 --> 01:56:11,580
But I actually do get rid of that just because it actually is distracting.

1704
01:56:12,700 --> 01:56:14,860
From watching them take their piss.

1705
01:56:14,860 --> 01:56:18,060
No, from watching them bathe or having woohoo.

1706
01:56:20,940 --> 01:56:21,900
Oh boy.

1707
01:56:21,900 --> 01:56:25,100
The mod for Sims 3 that turns woohoo into fuck.

1708
01:56:27,100 --> 01:56:29,100
It's on the little suggestion bar.

1709
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:30,700
Let's just call it what it is.

1710
01:56:30,700 --> 01:56:31,500
All right.

1711
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:33,180
It is a night here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1712
01:56:33,180 --> 01:56:35,820
There's something, I don't know, something in the storms.

1713
01:56:36,380 --> 01:56:37,580
It's parasitic balls.

1714
01:56:37,580 --> 01:56:40,780
Bringing, bringing in the funny or the strange.

1715
01:56:40,780 --> 01:56:41,020
All right.

1716
01:56:41,020 --> 01:56:42,620
Anyway, that's the food question of the week.

1717
01:56:42,620 --> 01:56:48,460
Facebook.com slash orange lounge radio or google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.

1718
01:56:50,380 --> 01:56:54,540
To register participation for this week's episode of orange on radio at vog network.com.

1719
01:56:54,620 --> 01:56:56,220
Use the passphrase wash.

1720
01:56:57,180 --> 01:57:00,540
Let's get into some more news before we get to some phone calls later on in the show.

1721
01:57:01,100 --> 01:57:01,500
Loki.

1722
01:57:02,060 --> 01:57:06,700
So we hear all these stories about people getting swatted and how it's terrible and stuff.

1723
01:57:06,700 --> 01:57:09,660
Well it's about time that we finally heard news that one of those

1724
01:57:10,220 --> 01:57:17,340
swatting one of the people behind this swatting has gotten arrested and that's the case in

1725
01:57:17,740 --> 01:57:27,900
I guess a online gamer who's known by the name Fame God who had swatted some people

1726
01:57:27,900 --> 01:57:35,980
in the past by making up murder scenarios and having the police go out to their homes

1727
01:57:35,980 --> 01:57:39,020
and stuff and of course not finding anybody.

1728
01:57:39,740 --> 01:57:42,140
I guess they had tracked him down.

1729
01:57:42,540 --> 01:57:50,860
He had used a computer to contact Naperville's 911 center back in July of last year and basically

1730
01:57:50,860 --> 01:57:59,580
said that there is a murder happening at a home in the city and so they sent there the

1731
01:57:59,580 --> 01:58:04,780
police out there and of course there was no one there and so they eventually tracked him

1732
01:58:04,780 --> 01:58:14,140
down to Vegas and they arrested him and took his computers and all that fun stuff.

1733
01:58:15,820 --> 01:58:16,940
Thank you.

1734
01:58:16,940 --> 01:58:20,460
Sometimes the justice system works.

1735
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:21,420
Thank you.

1736
01:58:21,420 --> 01:58:23,580
Apparently I think they should spank him.

1737
01:58:23,580 --> 01:58:25,100
Make an example.

1738
01:58:25,100 --> 01:58:29,900
He's been charged two counts of computer tampering, one count of intimidation,

1739
01:58:29,980 --> 01:58:36,540
computer fraud, identity theft, disorderly conduct, and also was waiting extradition

1740
01:58:36,540 --> 01:58:39,740
to Illinois and faces up to five years in prison if convicted.

1741
01:58:41,740 --> 01:58:44,620
He's still probably going to get a longer sentence than rapist.

1742
01:58:45,580 --> 01:58:49,980
He's been a very, very naughty boy and he needs to go to the naughty step immediately.

1743
01:58:50,700 --> 01:58:51,420
Very naughty.

1744
01:58:53,020 --> 01:58:57,420
Your fascination with Supernanny is amazing.

1745
01:58:57,980 --> 01:59:01,260
Since I don't have kids, I just imagine it's like Supernanny.

1746
01:59:01,260 --> 01:59:02,220
Am I correct?

1747
01:59:02,220 --> 01:59:05,180
No, it's 100% more whiny.

1748
01:59:06,940 --> 01:59:09,100
Have you tried putting your children on the naughty step?

1749
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:10,060
Oh, he doesn't care.

1750
01:59:12,140 --> 01:59:13,180
Timeouts don't work.

1751
01:59:14,780 --> 01:59:19,980
All right, let's see, so I'm really glad to hear one of those little turds got caught

1752
01:59:19,980 --> 01:59:24,380
and you know, if you do that kind of crap, you kind of have it coming.

1753
01:59:24,380 --> 01:59:27,100
So it's hard for me to feel sympathy for that guy.

1754
01:59:27,820 --> 01:59:32,540
Anyway, shifting gears here a little bit, talking about Sony Online Entertainment,

1755
01:59:32,540 --> 01:59:36,220
which essentially is gone as of this week.

1756
01:59:36,220 --> 01:59:38,220
Now, hold on, they didn't like close or anything.

1757
01:59:38,220 --> 01:59:39,660
They just transitioned a little bit.

1758
01:59:39,660 --> 01:59:45,260
That's because Columbus Nova, an investment management firm, actually bought Sony Online

1759
01:59:45,260 --> 01:59:46,220
Entertainment this week.

1760
01:59:46,220 --> 01:59:49,740
It is now Daybreak Game Company.

1761
01:59:49,740 --> 01:59:53,660
So Sony Online Entertainment or SOE is now Daybreak Game Company.

1762
01:59:53,660 --> 02:00:01,020
So this would affect games like PlanetSide 2, EverQuest Next, and Landmark, DC Universe

1763
02:00:01,020 --> 02:00:01,580
Online.

1764
02:00:01,580 --> 02:00:04,460
I mean, this is a lot of games that are impacted by this.

1765
02:00:04,460 --> 02:00:10,780
And already within moments, I mean, I'm looking at a post on the official PlanetSide 2 forums

1766
02:00:10,780 --> 02:00:12,620
over at station.sony.com.

1767
02:00:12,620 --> 02:00:17,900
And they even say on here, this means PlayStation, Xbox, mobile, and more.

1768
02:00:17,900 --> 02:00:23,420
Like, they don't even try to pretend that they're free of the restriction of only making

1769
02:00:23,420 --> 02:00:25,900
things for Sony and, assumably, PC.

1770
02:00:25,900 --> 02:00:29,900
So certainly, you're going to see things happen on Xbox and mobile.

1771
02:00:29,900 --> 02:00:34,300
Now, does this mean they're going to go back and port EverQuest to Xbox One?

1772
02:00:35,420 --> 02:00:36,940
Nah, probably not.

1773
02:00:36,940 --> 02:00:40,700
But you'll probably see a little more parity with the things that come out in the future.

1774
02:00:40,700 --> 02:00:46,060
And especially like, you know, maybe like EverQuest Landmark or some of the newer things,

1775
02:00:46,060 --> 02:00:47,740
maybe even DC Universe.

1776
02:00:47,740 --> 02:00:52,700
I mean, if it's not too hard for them to port over the PlayStation 4 versions of the Xbox

1777
02:00:52,700 --> 02:00:53,980
One, maybe that would come over.

1778
02:00:54,700 --> 02:00:57,340
But then again, now here's the problem.

1779
02:00:57,340 --> 02:01:02,220
Microsoft has that restriction where the servers have to be Microsoft-centric.

1780
02:01:02,220 --> 02:01:06,700
So is that going to work for every Daybreak Game Company game?

1781
02:01:06,700 --> 02:01:07,180
I don't know.

1782
02:01:07,180 --> 02:01:09,100
So it'll be interesting to see what develops in the future.

1783
02:01:09,100 --> 02:01:12,700
But I think mobile is definitely going to be a thing that's happening as well.

1784
02:01:12,700 --> 02:01:14,780
So they are saying business as usual for now.

1785
02:01:14,780 --> 02:01:17,100
It doesn't sound like there are any layoffs or things like that.

1786
02:01:17,100 --> 02:01:21,580
We're all keeping our fingers and toes crossed that the talent over there can keep on doing

1787
02:01:21,580 --> 02:01:22,460
right what they're doing.

1788
02:01:23,500 --> 02:01:28,380
And hopefully this will mean now that they can go more multi-platform, there'll be even

1789
02:01:28,380 --> 02:01:30,060
more subscribers to consume their games.

1790
02:01:30,060 --> 02:01:30,780
We'll see what happens.

1791
02:01:31,580 --> 02:01:31,900
All right.

1792
02:01:32,940 --> 02:01:37,900
Moving on, DarkSakura, you have a follow-up story for us of sorts, speaking of MMOs.

1793
02:01:37,900 --> 02:01:38,540
I do.

1794
02:01:38,540 --> 02:01:43,820
Well, you know, we talked about a lot of websites that had been shut down among them.

1795
02:01:43,820 --> 02:01:46,300
Joystiq, Massively, WoW Insider.

1796
02:01:46,940 --> 02:01:52,460
Well, WoW Insider is actually going to get an extended life as Blizzard Watch.

1797
02:01:53,180 --> 02:01:58,460
Although, I don't know, someone should have kerned their logo better.

1798
02:01:59,580 --> 02:02:09,420
So basically they generated $13,172.50 per month from 2,549 people.

1799
02:02:10,300 --> 02:02:13,580
And so they're now being relaunched as Blizzard Watch.

1800
02:02:14,220 --> 02:02:17,420
By the way, they have stressed that that logo is super temporary.

1801
02:02:17,420 --> 02:02:17,660
Good.

1802
02:02:19,020 --> 02:02:22,300
I think they actually had a post the other day trying to hire a graphic designer.

1803
02:02:24,220 --> 02:02:25,020
I should do it.

1804
02:02:25,020 --> 02:02:26,060
I should just do it for free.

1805
02:02:27,100 --> 02:02:30,060
Anyway, you can go to BlizzardWatch.com to find out a little bit more.

1806
02:02:30,700 --> 02:02:33,180
And I don't have time to do it.

1807
02:02:33,180 --> 02:02:34,860
No reason why you can't throw your hat in the ring.

1808
02:02:34,860 --> 02:02:35,580
Yeah.

1809
02:02:35,580 --> 02:02:37,500
I can just point out the bad kerning on that.

1810
02:02:38,220 --> 02:02:44,380
Also, now this is really interesting too, because we just talked about Kickstarter before.

1811
02:02:44,380 --> 02:02:51,500
But Massively is turning toward crowdfunding via Kickstarter to try to raise $50,000

1812
02:02:52,380 --> 02:02:57,260
to launch a new website called Massively Overpowered.

1813
02:02:58,060 --> 02:03:02,940
And on their Kickstarter project page, they're basically saying,

1814
02:03:03,020 --> 02:03:07,980
we like to keep doing what we were doing only better, not just because we love MMO blogging,

1815
02:03:07,980 --> 02:03:12,700
but because we know that our community and the greater MMO fandom is unique and worth serving.

1816
02:03:13,260 --> 02:03:15,100
And by the way, they've made it.

1817
02:03:15,100 --> 02:03:16,220
They've achieved that.

1818
02:03:16,220 --> 02:03:18,140
It was hit either earlier today or last night.

1819
02:03:18,140 --> 02:03:20,700
So it's still going though, isn't it?

1820
02:03:20,700 --> 02:03:21,340
It's still going.

1821
02:03:21,340 --> 02:03:22,540
25 days to go.

1822
02:03:22,540 --> 02:03:26,060
And their goal was $50,000 and they've made $52,000.

1823
02:03:26,060 --> 02:03:28,780
But of course, as a lot of Kickstarters do, they have stretch goals.

1824
02:03:28,780 --> 02:03:34,220
I want to say there was something for $75,000 about convention coverage.

1825
02:03:35,420 --> 02:03:40,060
If they can get into those different conventions, then they'll be covering those.

1826
02:03:40,700 --> 02:03:43,580
Their new website is MassivelyOP.com.

1827
02:03:44,140 --> 02:03:45,020
Very cool.

1828
02:03:45,020 --> 02:03:45,980
Go check it out.

1829
02:03:45,980 --> 02:03:49,180
Well, it's kind of funny because last week's show, not to say I told you so,

1830
02:03:49,180 --> 02:03:53,900
but I seem to remember distinctly saying, I guarantee you at least Wowsider is launching

1831
02:03:53,900 --> 02:03:57,100
a Patreon or a Kickstarter the minute they close on AOL.

1832
02:03:57,100 --> 02:03:59,180
Well, Wowsider actually did do it through Patreon.

1833
02:03:59,180 --> 02:03:59,580
They did.

1834
02:03:59,580 --> 02:03:59,820
Yeah.

1835
02:03:59,820 --> 02:04:02,220
So one did it through Patreon and one did it through Kickstarter.

1836
02:04:02,220 --> 02:04:05,500
And I said, if they're going to do it, strike while the iron's hot while people are,

1837
02:04:05,500 --> 02:04:09,580
you know, eulogizing the loss of WOW Insider and what it meant to them and so forth.

1838
02:04:09,580 --> 02:04:10,700
Strike while the iron's hot.

1839
02:04:10,700 --> 02:04:15,500
Hey, for a dollar a month, you know, you can still have this in your life.

1840
02:04:15,500 --> 02:04:17,820
And they convinced all these people to do it.

1841
02:04:17,820 --> 02:04:18,300
Good for them.

1842
02:04:18,300 --> 02:04:18,700
Good for them.

1843
02:04:18,700 --> 02:04:20,220
I mean, it's a good site.

1844
02:04:20,860 --> 02:04:22,140
I can't knock them whatsoever.

1845
02:04:22,140 --> 02:04:24,620
They do a good service for that Warcraft community.

1846
02:04:24,620 --> 02:04:26,220
And Massively does great work as well.

1847
02:04:26,540 --> 02:04:30,940
I've read their stuff a lot in doing Horde House, where we try to tap into all sorts

1848
02:04:30,940 --> 02:04:31,900
of online games.

1849
02:04:31,900 --> 02:04:36,620
I use Massively to try to keep a pulse and other sites too, but Massively a lot to try

1850
02:04:36,620 --> 02:04:38,780
to keep a pulse on all these other sites.

1851
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:43,900
What's very interesting though, Jamie, I don't know if you noticed, but so you have

1852
02:04:43,900 --> 02:04:45,580
WOW Insider started their own thing.

1853
02:04:46,380 --> 02:04:47,980
Massively started their own thing.

1854
02:04:47,980 --> 02:04:51,340
I believe Unofficial Apple Web Blog also started their own thing.

1855
02:04:51,340 --> 02:04:54,220
I know that's kind of outside the scope of what we talk about here, but that was a blog

1856
02:04:54,220 --> 02:04:55,260
that was shut down too.

1857
02:04:56,220 --> 02:05:00,780
Joystiq, however, apparently is not going down this route, or at least we haven't seen

1858
02:05:00,780 --> 02:05:01,340
it yet.

1859
02:05:01,340 --> 02:05:04,220
But you have this odd thing going on and it's a little different.

1860
02:05:05,740 --> 02:05:10,300
Well, yeah, it looks like they retained maybe three people from Joystiq.

1861
02:05:10,300 --> 02:05:16,860
Some of the writers who now are writing pieces for Engadget, but it sounds from their little

1862
02:05:16,860 --> 02:05:19,180
initial, this is what it's all about.

1863
02:05:19,180 --> 02:05:24,380
They're kind of, I hate to be so crass, but it sounded a bit like a lowered expectations

1864
02:05:24,380 --> 02:05:28,620
post where they're saying, we're not going to cover all the press release news.

1865
02:05:28,620 --> 02:05:31,100
We're going to cover gamer lifestyle.

1866
02:05:31,100 --> 02:05:33,260
It makes sense because they can't with three people.

1867
02:05:33,260 --> 02:05:35,020
That's what I'm thinking it is.

1868
02:05:35,020 --> 02:05:40,780
I hate to be so crude for a site that I really have respected in the past, but it did sound

1869
02:05:40,780 --> 02:05:42,380
like it was a lowered expectations post.

1870
02:05:42,380 --> 02:05:45,260
Like you're just not going to get as much as you used to see.

1871
02:05:45,260 --> 02:05:49,500
And so we're going to cut out all the stuff that everybody copy paste on other websites

1872
02:05:49,500 --> 02:05:51,420
anyway, which I mean, makes sense.

1873
02:05:51,420 --> 02:05:54,140
I can't fault them for that idea at all.

1874
02:05:54,460 --> 02:05:58,380
But it should be noted that Joystiq Cross and Gadget is not Joystiq.

1875
02:05:59,180 --> 02:06:06,300
And also within hours, that Wow Insider Twitter was turned into this thing that said, Wow

1876
02:06:06,300 --> 02:06:09,420
Insider, now a part of Joystiq Cross and Gadget.

1877
02:06:09,420 --> 02:06:12,540
And there were a whole bunch of people that replied to them, basically giving them the

1878
02:06:12,540 --> 02:06:13,500
middle finger.

1879
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:17,500
Like you fired the whole staff, fuck you, you know, type of thing.

1880
02:06:18,460 --> 02:06:23,820
And I have yet to see a peep on this Joystiq Cross and Gadget on what's, what's Wow

1881
02:06:23,820 --> 02:06:25,820
Insider, what's massively now.

1882
02:06:25,820 --> 02:06:28,620
My thought is they're just going to let it go.

1883
02:06:30,220 --> 02:06:33,580
They kind of have to, I think the community kind of sees through it.

1884
02:06:33,580 --> 02:06:37,980
You know, there's, if they try to do Wow Insider, it's, it's none of the same people.

1885
02:06:37,980 --> 02:06:41,900
It's just, it's just not going to, they're not going to retain any of those people that

1886
02:06:41,900 --> 02:06:42,620
were on that site.

1887
02:06:43,340 --> 02:06:47,020
It's like taking five new girls and calling them the Spice Girls.

1888
02:06:47,020 --> 02:06:49,340
It's not going to be the Spice Girls.

1889
02:06:49,340 --> 02:06:51,900
It's the Spice Girls in name only.

1890
02:06:51,980 --> 02:06:52,780
Or how about this?

1891
02:06:52,780 --> 02:06:57,180
Since everybody's talking by Saved by the Bell this week, which by the way, side rant,

1892
02:06:57,180 --> 02:06:58,380
what the fuck was cool?

1893
02:06:58,380 --> 02:06:59,500
No, no, I loved it.

1894
02:06:59,500 --> 02:06:59,980
I loved it.

1895
02:06:59,980 --> 02:07:03,420
But what the fuck was up with all these gaming blogs that were like, did you see the Saved

1896
02:07:03,420 --> 02:07:04,460
by the Bell thing on Fallon?

1897
02:07:04,460 --> 02:07:05,660
Like I saw it on Twitter.

1898
02:07:05,660 --> 02:07:06,300
It was clickbait.

1899
02:07:06,300 --> 02:07:07,500
They were writing articles on it.

1900
02:07:07,500 --> 02:07:10,220
I'm like, there's never even been a Saved by the Bell game.

1901
02:07:10,780 --> 02:07:16,060
And I mean, I saw the people that like games like this, like Saved by the Bell.

1902
02:07:16,060 --> 02:07:18,220
So that's why I'm going to put an article about it.

1903
02:07:18,220 --> 02:07:24,140
I just like, here is another great example of what we should be complaining about in

1904
02:07:24,140 --> 02:07:25,180
game journalism.

1905
02:07:25,180 --> 02:07:28,940
But there's all this bullshit fuckery hoo-ha going on somewhere else.

1906
02:07:28,940 --> 02:07:29,900
I'm just like, hello?

1907
02:07:29,900 --> 02:07:30,220
Hello?

1908
02:07:30,220 --> 02:07:30,940
It's right here.

1909
02:07:30,940 --> 02:07:31,900
It's like this.

1910
02:07:31,900 --> 02:07:32,780
This is not gaming.

1911
02:07:32,780 --> 02:07:33,900
What is this thing?

1912
02:07:33,900 --> 02:07:34,460
Yeah, exactly.

1913
02:07:34,460 --> 02:07:36,380
It's not journalism.

1914
02:07:36,380 --> 02:07:38,940
That's something you mentioned on your Twitter feed saying, hey, you know what?

1915
02:07:38,940 --> 02:07:39,660
That's pretty cool.

1916
02:07:39,660 --> 02:07:40,780
Hey, did you guys see that?

1917
02:07:40,780 --> 02:07:41,260
What is it?

1918
02:07:41,260 --> 02:07:44,220
It's a link to an article on Twitter on their Twitters.

1919
02:07:44,220 --> 02:07:44,860
Anyway.

1920
02:07:44,860 --> 02:07:45,500
Anyway, sorry.

1921
02:07:45,500 --> 02:07:46,060
Side rant.

1922
02:07:46,060 --> 02:07:47,260
To content they didn't even make.

1923
02:07:48,220 --> 02:07:49,260
Yeah, right.

1924
02:07:49,260 --> 02:07:52,540
So anyway, so what was I going to say?

1925
02:07:52,540 --> 02:07:59,020
Oh, I was going with an analogy of the new Saved by the Bell did not touch the old, all

1926
02:07:59,020 --> 02:07:59,180
right.

1927
02:07:59,180 --> 02:08:00,140
The trains left the station.

1928
02:08:00,140 --> 02:08:00,620
Forget it.

1929
02:08:02,140 --> 02:08:02,940
Let's move on.

1930
02:08:02,940 --> 02:08:03,980
Toot, toot, Rob.

1931
02:08:03,980 --> 02:08:04,620
Toot, toot.

1932
02:08:05,580 --> 02:08:06,060
All right.

1933
02:08:06,940 --> 02:08:07,980
Let's move on, Loki.

1934
02:08:08,700 --> 02:08:09,260
All right.

1935
02:08:10,540 --> 02:08:18,140
So there's this new sort of technology called gaze tracking that allows

1936
02:08:18,140 --> 02:08:22,700
you to use, I guess, they're saying like an infinite screen.

1937
02:08:22,700 --> 02:08:29,260
Basically, it tracks your eye movement and based on that, I guess, it allows you to,

1938
02:08:29,260 --> 02:08:31,740
I don't know, have more of an immersive experience.

1939
02:08:31,740 --> 02:08:33,900
They're calling it like an infinite screen.

1940
02:08:33,900 --> 02:08:39,500
So when the player looks to the left of the screen, I can measure where you're looking

1941
02:08:39,500 --> 02:08:41,500
and kind of rotate the camera, that type of thing.

1942
02:08:42,300 --> 02:08:43,580
I just don't see that working.

1943
02:08:43,580 --> 02:08:44,300
I mean, I don't know.

1944
02:08:45,580 --> 02:08:46,380
Cool, I guess.

1945
02:08:46,380 --> 02:08:55,020
But this reminds me so much of what they did with how they use the Kinect with like

1946
02:08:55,020 --> 02:08:59,660
Forza, where you would kind of turn your head to look to the side.

1947
02:08:59,660 --> 02:09:03,580
But the problem is, is when you turn your head, the monitor doesn't turn with you.

1948
02:09:03,580 --> 02:09:05,900
So it doesn't really work that way.

1949
02:09:07,500 --> 02:09:11,660
But anyways, apparently, though, you can, if you're interested in this technology,

1950
02:09:11,660 --> 02:09:17,980
they do have hardware that you could buy, including they have like they're saying some

1951
02:09:17,980 --> 02:09:21,420
development kits and stuff, 100 that go for $139.

1952
02:09:22,140 --> 02:09:25,500
I honestly think this would be kind of cool if it was something that was incorporated

1953
02:09:25,500 --> 02:09:31,260
into, say, something else like the Oculus or something like that, where it's kind of

1954
02:09:31,260 --> 02:09:37,420
tracking where you're looking and maybe utilizing that for UI or something like that for like

1955
02:09:37,420 --> 02:09:41,180
selecting things that might be kind of cool.

1956
02:09:41,660 --> 02:09:43,900
I just I don't know.

1957
02:09:44,780 --> 02:09:49,180
It's a neat concept, but I just don't know if it's going to be practical in the long

1958
02:09:49,180 --> 02:09:49,420
run.

1959
02:09:50,220 --> 02:09:53,180
Yeah, again, this is like any piece of technology.

1960
02:09:53,180 --> 02:09:54,540
I have to see the game.

1961
02:09:54,540 --> 02:09:57,020
I have to see the software that necessitates it.

1962
02:09:57,020 --> 02:10:01,900
And honestly, the problem with me, if I use this, is it's just going to be, you know,

1963
02:10:03,100 --> 02:10:06,780
OK, I glance at the boobs all of a sudden now, like my character spin around.

1964
02:10:06,780 --> 02:10:08,300
It's like I just I can't.

1965
02:10:09,020 --> 02:10:13,340
Am I going to get penalized for looking at the boobs or looking at the package?

1966
02:10:13,340 --> 02:10:15,420
Whatever your taste is going to be, it's going to be tough.

1967
02:10:16,700 --> 02:10:19,020
Is my video game going to out me as gay?

1968
02:10:22,140 --> 02:10:25,260
No, I just I have to see like what context this is used in.

1969
02:10:25,260 --> 02:10:29,340
I mean, like, you know, like Kinect, we've seen a few good uses of it, like, you know,

1970
02:10:29,340 --> 02:10:34,140
Dan Harmonix clearly has that thing mastered, but, you know, not even Microsoft ever really,

1971
02:10:34,140 --> 02:10:36,220
you know, truly mastered the Kinect.

1972
02:10:36,220 --> 02:10:39,260
Oculus Rift and, you know, Project Morpheus.

1973
02:10:39,260 --> 02:10:42,060
I'm a little more sold on, too, because I've kind of seen how those work.

1974
02:10:42,060 --> 02:10:43,980
But it seems a good game.

1975
02:10:43,980 --> 02:10:47,420
And that's the other thing, too, is like they're saying, you know, even when they're talking

1976
02:10:47,420 --> 02:10:51,740
about it, they're like, well, you know, you could still use your mouse to look around

1977
02:10:51,740 --> 02:10:54,620
and stuff, but it's really the next evolution.

1978
02:10:54,620 --> 02:11:01,180
Well, it's not really a problem, I think, from, you know, don't try to solve a problem

1979
02:11:01,180 --> 02:11:02,140
that's not there yet.

1980
02:11:02,140 --> 02:11:02,860
You know what I mean?

1981
02:11:03,740 --> 02:11:09,180
If it's good enough the way it is now, why do I need to invest $200 into something for

1982
02:11:09,180 --> 02:11:13,100
just like mouse looking, but instead I'm going to be using my eyes?

1983
02:11:13,100 --> 02:11:18,620
And, you know, I would have to really see this working because in the past, similar

1984
02:11:18,620 --> 02:11:20,220
technologies have not worked.

1985
02:11:20,220 --> 02:11:23,980
And I just, I don't know, that's a lot of money to invest.

1986
02:11:25,100 --> 02:11:26,140
But we'll see.

1987
02:11:27,100 --> 02:11:27,420
All right.

1988
02:11:27,420 --> 02:11:33,420
Well, moving on to a game that if it did have gaze tracking in it, would probably be asking

1989
02:11:33,420 --> 02:11:35,100
a lot, why do you keep looking at that nose?

1990
02:11:35,660 --> 02:11:37,340
That's a classic game.

1991
02:11:37,340 --> 02:11:38,140
Qbert.

1992
02:11:38,140 --> 02:11:41,660
I just talked about this earlier in the show, funny enough, because over at Rockage, I played

1993
02:11:41,660 --> 02:11:42,860
an old school Qbert machine.

1994
02:11:43,740 --> 02:11:49,820
And Qbert is going to be relaunched on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and Vita.

1995
02:11:49,820 --> 02:11:50,460
That's right.

1996
02:11:50,460 --> 02:11:54,540
Qbert rebooted, essentially, is coming to these different consoles.

1997
02:11:54,540 --> 02:11:57,100
This was run on the Sony blog earlier this week.

1998
02:11:57,660 --> 02:12:01,500
The complete original version of Qbert, of course, is included.

1999
02:12:02,540 --> 02:12:07,500
But as part of Qbert rebooted, you get the classic and then you get the modernized.

2000
02:12:08,060 --> 02:12:10,700
Qbert rebooted uses hexagons.

2001
02:12:10,700 --> 02:12:13,980
Ooh, now instead of the cube pattern, they've got hexagons.

2002
02:12:13,980 --> 02:12:17,740
They went the Civ 5 route to mix up the game.

2003
02:12:17,740 --> 02:12:19,100
I wonder if that's where they got the idea.

2004
02:12:19,100 --> 02:12:20,300
Let's turn squares into hexagons.

2005
02:12:20,300 --> 02:12:25,820
Anyway, so you can really change up the level designs now that you're using hexagons.

2006
02:12:25,820 --> 02:12:30,940
There's also time and score challenges, new enemies with new behaviors, new playable characters,

2007
02:12:31,660 --> 02:12:32,540
and so on and so on.

2008
02:12:32,540 --> 02:12:34,380
So that's pretty cool.

2009
02:12:34,380 --> 02:12:37,820
I did not catch a time when this is coming out, but I think it's really soon.

2010
02:12:37,820 --> 02:12:38,780
I think it's later this month.

2011
02:12:38,780 --> 02:12:40,380
It might even be as soon as this coming week.

2012
02:12:40,380 --> 02:12:42,860
But I really enjoy the classic Qbert game.

2013
02:12:43,420 --> 02:12:44,140
It's a lot of fun.

2014
02:12:44,140 --> 02:12:46,620
So I will certainly be checking this out.

2015
02:12:46,620 --> 02:12:50,060
That will be available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and Vita.

2016
02:12:50,700 --> 02:12:53,100
To go back to what we were talking about just a second ago.

2017
02:12:54,060 --> 02:12:58,460
They brought a Dungeon Buster brought up in chat.

2018
02:12:58,460 --> 02:13:01,020
Would you like to see your Kinect eye tracking stats for the week?

2019
02:13:01,020 --> 02:13:06,060
That reminds me, like if this was something that was implemented full scale, then can

2020
02:13:06,060 --> 02:13:09,980
you imagine like, oh, hey, yeah, we could totally see what the ad impression is.

2021
02:13:09,980 --> 02:13:11,820
How long were they staring at the ad?

2022
02:13:11,820 --> 02:13:12,700
Oh, God.

2023
02:13:12,700 --> 02:13:15,420
How long were they staring at the product or whatever that's on the screen?

2024
02:13:15,420 --> 02:13:19,660
Imagine all that metadata that would be really helpful.

2025
02:13:19,660 --> 02:13:25,260
So I could see something like this integrated into some consumer products because that's

2026
02:13:25,260 --> 02:13:29,420
good information for advertisers that they can sell and make money off of.

2027
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:35,580
Raginator in chat pointing out that Qbert Reloaded is already on Steam.

2028
02:13:35,580 --> 02:13:36,540
I bought it a while back.

2029
02:13:36,540 --> 02:13:37,820
Well, shit, I was unaware.

2030
02:13:37,820 --> 02:13:38,860
I might have to check that out.

2031
02:13:38,860 --> 02:13:39,580
Although, I don't know.

2032
02:13:39,580 --> 02:13:41,900
I'll wait for it on PlayStation, maybe.

2033
02:13:41,900 --> 02:13:43,820
Fifth Dream says Qbert is out on the 10th.

2034
02:13:43,820 --> 02:13:44,860
So that would be this coming week.

2035
02:13:44,860 --> 02:13:45,580
Well, that's pretty cool.

2036
02:13:46,220 --> 02:13:47,020
So I will check that out.

2037
02:13:47,020 --> 02:13:51,260
Maybe I'll just wait a few more days then and buy that on the PlayStation.

2038
02:13:51,260 --> 02:13:54,060
It does seem like a game I want to play with the controller.

2039
02:13:54,060 --> 02:13:54,560
I don't know.

2040
02:13:55,100 --> 02:13:57,660
I guess I could always plug the controller into my PC, right?

2041
02:13:57,660 --> 02:13:58,140
But I don't know.

2042
02:13:58,140 --> 02:14:01,180
It's some games are couch games.

2043
02:14:01,180 --> 02:14:01,660
I could.

2044
02:14:01,660 --> 02:14:03,740
Yeah, there's probably a working Qbert on there in there.

2045
02:14:04,780 --> 02:14:08,380
But it probably doesn't make that same thud sound when Qbert hits the bottom.

2046
02:14:08,380 --> 02:14:08,880
Who knows?

2047
02:14:09,580 --> 02:14:09,980
All right.

2048
02:14:09,980 --> 02:14:11,820
Anyhow, let's go to the mailbag.

2049
02:14:11,820 --> 02:14:17,180
Every week, you guys send us emails over at participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2050
02:14:17,740 --> 02:14:23,740
And DarkSakura dives into the mailbag and finds a few emails worthy of reading for you here on the show.

2051
02:14:23,740 --> 02:14:26,460
So DarkSakura, what is awaiting us in the mailbag tonight?

2052
02:14:27,260 --> 02:14:27,820
Two letters.

2053
02:14:28,620 --> 02:14:29,580
Two letters?

2054
02:14:29,580 --> 02:14:31,020
I will go ahead and start with one.

2055
02:14:31,020 --> 02:14:31,520
Okay.

2056
02:14:32,620 --> 02:14:34,540
First one is HelloLR.

2057
02:14:35,580 --> 02:14:37,020
Caught up on podcast this week.

2058
02:14:37,020 --> 02:14:40,700
I apologize for the length of this email in advance, but trust me, it's all meat and no fat.

2059
02:14:40,700 --> 02:14:42,940
Well, we don't want that because fat makes it juicy.

2060
02:14:43,820 --> 02:14:44,320
No, I'm kidding.

2061
02:14:45,020 --> 02:14:49,980
When you were discussing Rock Edge, it occurred to me that I need to say something.

2062
02:14:49,980 --> 02:14:51,260
You all need to go to MAGFest.

2063
02:14:52,220 --> 02:14:55,100
Like, not you ought to go or you should think about it.

2064
02:14:55,100 --> 02:14:56,220
You really need to go.

2065
02:14:56,220 --> 02:14:59,660
To describe the feeling you'll get when you walk in there is impossible.

2066
02:14:59,660 --> 02:15:03,260
There are more video games in one room than you will ever see anywhere else in your lifetime,

2067
02:15:03,260 --> 02:15:05,180
except possibly at a future MAGFest.

2068
02:15:05,900 --> 02:15:08,780
Lots of consoles are there, including most you cannot think of.

2069
02:15:08,780 --> 02:15:10,460
Even obscure ones went like my house.

2070
02:15:11,500 --> 02:15:14,140
Plus over 200 arcade games on free play.

2071
02:15:14,140 --> 02:15:17,900
Plus all the stuff we grew up with to the latest bit money straight from Japan.

2072
02:15:17,900 --> 02:15:20,940
That actually sounds like California Extreme.

2073
02:15:22,380 --> 02:15:24,540
Plus pinball machines, California Extreme.

2074
02:15:24,540 --> 02:15:26,700
Plus board and card game, California Extreme.

2075
02:15:27,340 --> 02:15:30,460
Plus a dedicated area with dozens of indie developers.

2076
02:15:30,460 --> 02:15:35,260
Plus the infamous challenge booth where you attempt sick feats on classic emulated games.

2077
02:15:35,260 --> 02:15:36,060
Plus concerts.

2078
02:15:36,060 --> 02:15:37,900
Okay, so yeah, that's where they...

2079
02:15:37,900 --> 02:15:42,380
Yeah, the concerts is a really huge thing that distinguishes it from California Extreme.

2080
02:15:42,380 --> 02:15:43,420
Lots of concerts.

2081
02:15:43,420 --> 02:15:45,020
Based on what I saw at Rockage.

2082
02:15:45,020 --> 02:15:50,540
Hell, the last couple of years have even featured Nobuyomatsu and Yuzo Koshiro concerts.

2083
02:15:51,180 --> 02:15:54,060
This even sounds like slightly awesome...

2084
02:15:54,060 --> 02:15:55,740
No, if this even sounds slightly awesome to you,

2085
02:15:55,740 --> 02:15:57,500
you should try to make it there next January.

2086
02:15:57,500 --> 02:15:58,860
Please trust me on this.

2087
02:15:58,860 --> 02:15:59,580
I would like to.

2088
02:16:00,460 --> 02:16:00,960
It just...

2089
02:16:01,580 --> 02:16:02,080
Yeah.

2090
02:16:02,540 --> 02:16:03,740
Time, money, etc.

2091
02:16:05,180 --> 02:16:07,180
I am giving it way more serious thought now.

2092
02:16:07,180 --> 02:16:14,860
As I mentioned earlier in the show, thanks to Rockage and just kind of having some thinking

2093
02:16:14,860 --> 02:16:19,420
over the past few weeks about where should my priorities really lie and what conventions I go to.

2094
02:16:20,460 --> 02:16:24,220
I really think some of the conventions that I used to consider kind of a big deal,

2095
02:16:24,220 --> 02:16:26,540
I think are kind of losing their relevancy.

2096
02:16:27,260 --> 02:16:29,500
And maybe I'll get into this more on a future show,

2097
02:16:29,500 --> 02:16:33,900
but I kind of believe that E3 is becoming less and less relevant, as I think a lot of you are.

2098
02:16:33,900 --> 02:16:34,400
Yep.

2099
02:16:34,400 --> 02:16:37,760
Especially as companies like Nintendo take their case directly to consumers.

2100
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:46,080
So I think these other homegrown shows that really celebrate gaming and what it's all about,

2101
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:48,160
that haven't sold out like some other ones have,

2102
02:16:48,880 --> 02:16:53,120
I think these other homegrown things like Magfest, like Rockage, like GX,

2103
02:16:54,160 --> 02:16:57,040
there's tons of them everywhere every weekend.

2104
02:16:57,040 --> 02:16:59,760
I think this is really the types of stuff I want to be going to.

2105
02:16:59,760 --> 02:17:02,160
Things where we celebrate and love and appreciate gaming.

2106
02:17:02,160 --> 02:17:07,440
A follow up to my previous email regarding Nintendo's evil pay to play crane game,

2107
02:17:07,440 --> 02:17:10,640
where you can win badges and icons to customize your 3DS home menu,

2108
02:17:10,640 --> 02:17:13,040
it's a little bit less evil than originally reported.

2109
02:17:13,040 --> 02:17:15,600
If you buy five plays for 90 yen and don't win anything,

2110
02:17:15,600 --> 02:17:20,320
you'll receive a free badges consolation prize that might not be the one you were playing for.

2111
02:17:20,320 --> 02:17:24,720
Also, there is a special crane machine that you can get five plays on for free once a day.

2112
02:17:24,720 --> 02:17:28,080
This machine allows you to win fake badges, but don't do anything for you,

2113
02:17:28,080 --> 02:17:31,360
but the ones you win are flipped over.

2114
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:36,320
That if you find a red dot on the back, you win three free plays on the next real machine.

2115
02:17:36,880 --> 02:17:40,480
This has only happened once out of the 30 or so fake badges I've won,

2116
02:17:40,480 --> 02:17:44,080
but for every 10 you win, you get one free play on the real machine regardless.

2117
02:17:44,080 --> 02:17:48,320
So it is in theory possible to win a lot of the items without paying any money.

2118
02:17:48,320 --> 02:17:50,160
It just may take a very long time.

2119
02:17:50,160 --> 02:17:52,960
Lastly, if you pay 180 yen in one day for 10 players,

2120
02:17:52,960 --> 02:17:57,200
you will see at no extra charge an exclusive premium theme of your choice.

2121
02:17:57,200 --> 02:17:59,680
This is all about the price they sell the themes for anyway,

2122
02:17:59,680 --> 02:18:01,520
so it's arguably a good value.

2123
02:18:01,520 --> 02:18:05,440
All in all, it's still very evil, but perhaps only 66.6% evil.

2124
02:18:08,880 --> 02:18:12,080
Shane was telling me about that crane game because you know he imported that new 3DS.

2125
02:18:12,080 --> 02:18:14,640
So he was he was over here the other day and he was playing it.

2126
02:18:14,640 --> 02:18:15,520
I was like, what the hell are you playing?

2127
02:18:15,520 --> 02:18:16,320
He's like, oh, it's the crane.

2128
02:18:16,320 --> 02:18:19,040
And I was like, oh, I've heard about this on the alarm desk.

2129
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:20,160
This is cute.

2130
02:18:20,160 --> 02:18:21,440
Yeah, they get cute boxes.

2131
02:18:21,440 --> 02:18:21,920
Not fair.

2132
02:18:23,200 --> 02:18:25,520
When shocking moments were being discussed,

2133
02:18:25,520 --> 02:18:28,960
I'm a little surprised that nobody brought up the release announcement of Duke Nukem Forever.

2134
02:18:28,960 --> 02:18:31,040
When non-traditional sports games were mentioned,

2135
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:34,560
it's a little I'm a little surprised that nobody suggested Super Dodgeball.

2136
02:18:36,240 --> 02:18:37,360
Dan would have suggested that.

2137
02:18:38,080 --> 02:18:42,640
I think Twitch is the most likely candidate to offer an alternative to YouTube to host

2138
02:18:42,640 --> 02:18:43,760
Let's Play videos.

2139
02:18:43,760 --> 02:18:46,160
They also think they're sharply focused on what they do best

2140
02:18:46,160 --> 02:18:48,880
and will likely not expand into doing other things.

2141
02:18:49,760 --> 02:18:51,280
That said, I hope I'm wrong.

2142
02:18:51,280 --> 02:18:54,800
YouTube needs a good splits kick punch in the vajayjay.

2143
02:18:54,800 --> 02:18:58,880
The Sony class action settlement was mentioned.

2144
02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:02,640
If you are participating, read the instructions and fine print carefully.

2145
02:19:02,640 --> 02:19:06,560
You can only select to be the three or six months of PlayStation Plus benefit

2146
02:19:06,560 --> 02:19:08,320
if you are not a current subscriber.

2147
02:19:08,320 --> 02:19:09,520
That's what I thought.

2148
02:19:09,520 --> 02:19:14,080
If you select that option and you are a current subscriber, you will forfeit your benefit.

2149
02:19:14,080 --> 02:19:17,200
Oh, I already have all the other games on there anyway.

2150
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:22,400
A listener mentioned on a frugal question that they've never been to a convention,

2151
02:19:22,400 --> 02:19:27,040
but that they were looking forward to too many games in the Philadelphia area this year.

2152
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:30,400
Well, I've been there demoing my latest projects for the past four years

2153
02:19:30,400 --> 02:19:32,880
and I'll be there again this year, too, so I hope to see you there.

2154
02:19:32,880 --> 02:19:35,360
Mention OLR and you'll get free hugs at the very least.

2155
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:41,360
By the way, Philadelphia area, I think also is DerpyCon.

2156
02:19:42,400 --> 02:19:47,120
I think they're going to be doing a second one, but I did their flyer for them, their book.

2157
02:19:47,680 --> 02:19:54,400
So, lastly, I want to mention that Orange Lounge Radio is the most legitimate podcast

2158
02:19:54,400 --> 02:19:55,360
on the internet.

2159
02:19:55,360 --> 02:19:58,480
In fact, it is 120% legitimate on every day of the week.

2160
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:03,040
And if for any reasons one of my future game releases ever gets popular,

2161
02:20:03,040 --> 02:20:06,800
a large amount of people ever care about what I have to say,

2162
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:10,480
I will still make my project announcements on OLR before I make them anywhere else.

2163
02:20:10,480 --> 02:20:10,800
Why?

2164
02:20:10,800 --> 02:20:12,240
Because that's my FU of the week.

2165
02:20:12,240 --> 02:20:13,520
Every week, that's why.

2166
02:20:13,520 --> 02:20:15,200
Hugs and kisses, Erin Yyr.

2167
02:20:15,520 --> 02:20:17,440
That really means a lot.

2168
02:20:17,440 --> 02:20:18,160
Thank you.

2169
02:20:18,160 --> 02:20:18,640
Really true.

2170
02:20:18,640 --> 02:20:19,760
Like, this week especially.

2171
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:20,640
Hearts.

2172
02:20:20,640 --> 02:20:21,360
That means an awful lot.

2173
02:20:21,360 --> 02:20:23,600
Sorry for all the pictures of swollen balls in the chat room.

2174
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:26,640
I will explain that later.

2175
02:20:28,320 --> 02:20:31,760
Okay, I have to actually stop because I have to tell you what my obsession with the swollen balls

2176
02:20:31,760 --> 02:20:32,260
are now.

2177
02:20:32,960 --> 02:20:34,160
Do we really need to go there?

2178
02:20:34,160 --> 02:20:35,360
Because I'm not sure we need to go there.

2179
02:20:35,360 --> 02:20:36,400
Let's go there.

2180
02:20:36,400 --> 02:20:36,900
No!

2181
02:20:37,680 --> 02:20:40,480
It's actually giving a plug to one of my favorite YouTube channels.

2182
02:20:41,040 --> 02:20:42,640
So, it's Rachel and June.

2183
02:20:43,680 --> 02:20:51,360
A cute redhead girl that met her now Japanese husband while she was a student over there,

2184
02:20:51,360 --> 02:20:53,280
was separated from for a little while and then moved back.

2185
02:20:53,280 --> 02:20:58,880
So, she actually goes into depth about what it's like being a foreigner in Japan

2186
02:20:58,880 --> 02:21:01,120
and being married into a Japanese family and whatnot.

2187
02:21:01,120 --> 02:21:05,280
So, she did one about the Tokyo Parasite Museum.

2188
02:21:05,280 --> 02:21:06,400
Hence, swollen balls.

2189
02:21:07,920 --> 02:21:08,640
You nasty.

2190
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:10,400
So, it's interesting.

2191
02:21:10,400 --> 02:21:11,760
Is science Rob Science?

2192
02:21:12,560 --> 02:21:13,680
What were you gonna say?

2193
02:21:13,680 --> 02:21:14,180
Science.

2194
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:16,240
Thank you.

2195
02:21:16,240 --> 02:21:17,440
Fifth dream in chat.

2196
02:21:17,440 --> 02:21:18,320
Swollen balls.

2197
02:21:18,320 --> 02:21:19,680
Is this Hoard House?

2198
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:20,320
Thank you.

2199
02:21:20,320 --> 02:21:22,080
I already have to put up with this one night a week.

2200
02:21:22,080 --> 02:21:23,120
I don't need two.

2201
02:21:23,120 --> 02:21:24,880
I'm gonna have a talk with grandpa.

2202
02:21:24,880 --> 02:21:25,840
You and grandpa.

2203
02:21:26,400 --> 02:21:28,640
You and grandpa should do a dirty girls show.

2204
02:21:28,640 --> 02:21:29,520
That's what you should do.

2205
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:30,400
Just dirty girls.

2206
02:21:30,400 --> 02:21:32,240
That's what I get for living in his house.

2207
02:21:32,240 --> 02:21:32,960
Maybe, what?

2208
02:21:32,960 --> 02:21:34,640
Are you gonna get Patty involved in that too?

2209
02:21:34,640 --> 02:21:36,800
Yeah, me, Patty, and grandpa.

2210
02:21:36,800 --> 02:21:37,600
Oh, Jesus.

2211
02:21:38,640 --> 02:21:40,000
Vogue After Dark.

2212
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:40,480
That's it.

2213
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:41,360
That's what we're gonna call it.

2214
02:21:41,360 --> 02:21:42,240
Vogue After Dark.

2215
02:21:44,880 --> 02:21:45,920
Okay, last email.

2216
02:21:46,480 --> 02:21:47,360
Hey, OLR.

2217
02:21:47,360 --> 02:21:48,880
Great show this past episode.

2218
02:21:48,880 --> 02:21:51,680
I appreciate that you guys tackle some difficult topics

2219
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:52,960
and aren't afraid to dig in.

2220
02:21:53,600 --> 02:21:54,400
I'm not gonna say it.

2221
02:21:55,040 --> 02:21:58,240
Usually, I just enjoy as a passive listener,

2222
02:21:58,240 --> 02:22:00,080
but this time I felt a little heat rise

2223
02:22:00,080 --> 02:22:02,480
and wanted to let off a little steam of my own.

2224
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,560
Regarding the discussion on YouTube copyright violations

2225
02:22:06,640 --> 02:22:07,760
of games slash music,

2226
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:10,960
I can't comprehend anything but an unrestricted fair use system.

2227
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:13,280
Now, I say fair use,

2228
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:17,440
which exempts those who simply play artists songs or play movies.

2229
02:22:17,440 --> 02:22:19,280
It's clearly a different matter altogether,

2230
02:22:19,280 --> 02:22:21,920
but streaming a game play through with the song in the background,

2231
02:22:22,800 --> 02:22:24,240
background, sorry, that's fair use.

2232
02:22:24,880 --> 02:22:28,240
It's really a win-win for both consumers and content creators.

2233
02:22:28,240 --> 02:22:31,120
Playing the games and music are a great way to promote the content.

2234
02:22:31,120 --> 02:22:32,800
People watch and listen and then buy,

2235
02:22:32,800 --> 02:22:34,800
which I actually will say I've done.

2236
02:22:34,800 --> 02:22:38,240
I even got introduced to one of my favorite bands now Boy and Bear

2237
02:22:38,240 --> 02:22:41,520
when they were still really, really new in Australia

2238
02:22:41,520 --> 02:22:44,480
because one of their songs played in the background of a commercial.

2239
02:22:44,480 --> 02:22:48,080
I popped out my Shazam and I tagged the song because I wanted it

2240
02:22:48,720 --> 02:22:50,000
and now they're kind of big.

2241
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:51,120
I feel like such a hipster.

2242
02:22:54,640 --> 02:22:58,080
I can't imagine hearing a background song on someone's homemade video

2243
02:22:58,080 --> 02:23:00,800
or watching a game or play a game and then say to myself,

2244
02:23:00,800 --> 02:23:03,760
I'm good, I don't need to buy that game or that CD.

2245
02:23:03,760 --> 02:23:06,160
At worst, I decide it's a game I don't want to play

2246
02:23:06,160 --> 02:23:07,600
or a song I don't need to hear again.

2247
02:23:07,600 --> 02:23:10,080
At best, I go out and buy the game or the album.

2248
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:12,320
That's a win-win for me and for the creator.

2249
02:23:13,040 --> 02:23:15,840
Charging fees for streaming these things and most,

2250
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:19,600
no, charge fees for streaming these things and most YouTubers

2251
02:23:19,600 --> 02:23:23,440
won't or can't pay it, won't stream it, and we won't see and hear it.

2252
02:23:23,440 --> 02:23:28,000
No promotion, no awareness, no purchase, lose-lose for both customers and content creators.

2253
02:23:29,120 --> 02:23:31,360
I really can't believe it's even an issue.

2254
02:23:31,360 --> 02:23:37,520
Content creators would be crazy to do anything to disable promotional avenues.

2255
02:23:37,520 --> 02:23:39,120
Promotion is everything.

2256
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:42,800
Having people stream your gaming music for free, you can't do it better.

2257
02:23:42,800 --> 02:23:46,480
I must be near-sighted here because I can't even understand the other side of this argument.

2258
02:23:46,480 --> 02:23:47,680
Love the OLR, narc.

2259
02:23:48,320 --> 02:23:52,560
And I will say this, a lot of these decisions come from,

2260
02:23:54,320 --> 02:23:57,920
I'm going to say the upper level corporate side of things

2261
02:23:57,920 --> 02:24:01,600
where they're not actually as in touch with reality

2262
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:03,600
as the people who are on the ground level.

2263
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:04,720
And that's all I'm going to say on that.

2264
02:24:05,520 --> 02:24:09,680
Nintendo's system is flawed, you know, and anything I was talking about last week,

2265
02:24:09,680 --> 02:24:12,480
you know, I totally agree.

2266
02:24:12,480 --> 02:24:15,840
The system that Nintendo came up with only makes Nintendo the winner

2267
02:24:15,840 --> 02:24:17,520
as well as all these other people to get a cut.

2268
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:19,280
The system is flawed and needs to be fixed.

2269
02:24:19,280 --> 02:24:21,840
And I believe YouTube is the one that needs to fix it.

2270
02:24:21,840 --> 02:24:27,680
However, I respectfully disagree with you that, you know, you can't,

2271
02:24:28,640 --> 02:24:33,840
the Let's Play simply would not exist without the game, period.

2272
02:24:33,840 --> 02:24:38,800
You're saying in your email that you wouldn't come or you wouldn't see the game

2273
02:24:38,800 --> 02:24:40,720
if it wasn't for the Let's Player.

2274
02:24:40,720 --> 02:24:42,880
I'm saying the reverse is true too.

2275
02:24:42,880 --> 02:24:45,920
And I think that's where you do have the blinders there is that

2276
02:24:45,920 --> 02:24:48,480
how did you find the Let's Player in the first place?

2277
02:24:48,480 --> 02:24:49,920
By looking for the game.

2278
02:24:50,480 --> 02:24:53,040
The game creates that content.

2279
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:55,760
I mean, and this is, this happens in music.

2280
02:24:55,760 --> 02:24:58,080
This happens in movies.

2281
02:24:58,080 --> 02:24:59,120
But that can go either way.

2282
02:24:59,120 --> 02:25:01,920
Just like, for example, like I find out of a game sometimes,

2283
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:04,640
like I like watching Total Biscuits videos.

2284
02:25:04,640 --> 02:25:07,840
And I found out like about a game called Tower of Guns,

2285
02:25:07,840 --> 02:25:09,520
not by looking for Tower of Guns.

2286
02:25:09,520 --> 02:25:12,800
I watched his channel and I saw that game.

2287
02:25:12,800 --> 02:25:13,760
And so I was exposed to it.

2288
02:25:13,760 --> 02:25:14,880
So it goes both ways.

2289
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:17,520
And I actually agree with that.

2290
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:20,400
And that's why I don't think Nintendo deserves a hundred percent.

2291
02:25:20,400 --> 02:25:21,760
I don't think they do.

2292
02:25:21,760 --> 02:25:25,360
And I think if Nintendo wants to give away,

2293
02:25:25,360 --> 02:25:28,960
essentially say, we're going to give away our game for free

2294
02:25:28,960 --> 02:25:32,640
for you to stream, then go ahead and do so.

2295
02:25:33,440 --> 02:25:35,360
And that would encourage more people to do it.

2296
02:25:35,360 --> 02:25:36,800
If they wanted to do that, they could.

2297
02:25:36,800 --> 02:25:39,120
And it would, in fact, encourage more people to do it.

2298
02:25:39,120 --> 02:25:40,480
But they don't have to do it.

2299
02:25:40,480 --> 02:25:44,480
Just like there's people that put music out there in the public domain saying,

2300
02:25:44,480 --> 02:25:46,640
here, please use my music.

2301
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:48,080
Just give me a credit.

2302
02:25:48,080 --> 02:25:48,800
That's all I want.

2303
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:50,240
Please just help me get my music out there.

2304
02:25:50,960 --> 02:25:51,520
It's fine.

2305
02:25:52,320 --> 02:25:57,360
Um, I just, I don't think Nintendo is obligated to let you use it for free.

2306
02:25:57,360 --> 02:26:00,960
But I also understand that, well, it's not like people are going to sit here

2307
02:26:00,960 --> 02:26:03,360
and try to license something from Nintendo.

2308
02:26:03,920 --> 02:26:07,040
No, but YouTube is ultimately the one that's making the money off

2309
02:26:07,040 --> 02:26:08,800
both people in that situation.

2310
02:26:08,800 --> 02:26:14,160
I think it is up to YouTube to come up with the system that is fair for both parties.

2311
02:26:14,160 --> 02:26:17,440
And if a gaming company wants to give up their portion of it

2312
02:26:17,440 --> 02:26:20,720
to encourage more people to do the Let's Plays, then so be it.

2313
02:26:20,720 --> 02:26:22,400
And maybe a lot of game companies will do it,

2314
02:26:22,400 --> 02:26:24,320
because it would probably be the smart thing to do

2315
02:26:24,320 --> 02:26:26,160
for a lot of those reasons you just named.

2316
02:26:26,160 --> 02:26:28,320
But I don't think a gaming company has to do it.

2317
02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:33,520
So that's, again, I don't want to re-dredge up the whole debate,

2318
02:26:33,520 --> 02:26:37,360
but those are just my thought out responses to your email.

2319
02:26:37,360 --> 02:26:42,000
So just try really, really hard to look at it the other way around.

2320
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:45,120
I'm not saying you necessarily have to have the corporate mentality,

2321
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:49,440
but just, you know, consider that Nintendo did make the game

2322
02:26:49,440 --> 02:26:51,120
that this person is wanting to stream.

2323
02:26:51,120 --> 02:26:53,120
And without the game, there is nothing to stream.

2324
02:26:53,760 --> 02:26:55,120
Anyway, all right.

2325
02:26:56,800 --> 02:26:58,720
I'm sure there'll be more thoughts on this later.

2326
02:27:00,080 --> 02:27:02,720
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com

2327
02:27:02,720 --> 02:27:04,480
if you want to give more thoughts on this later.

2328
02:27:04,480 --> 02:27:08,000
Oh, no, I guess in chat while we were doing that email, that's a bummer.

2329
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:11,280
I guess the stream died right in the middle of that for our live listeners.

2330
02:27:11,280 --> 02:27:14,240
Unfortunately, guys, there was a big storm in California over the weekend,

2331
02:27:14,240 --> 02:27:17,360
so I wouldn't be surprised at all if the internet's a little shitty as a result.

2332
02:27:18,080 --> 02:27:19,040
So sorry about that.

2333
02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:23,520
I was worried this might happen tonight with all the storms.

2334
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:26,560
I'm just lucky the rain stopped right at six o'clock.

2335
02:27:26,560 --> 02:27:28,320
So I don't have to worry about power outages.

2336
02:27:28,320 --> 02:27:28,960
Knock on wood.

2337
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:30,180
Let's hope.

2338
02:27:31,120 --> 02:27:31,920
Knock on particle boards.

2339
02:27:31,920 --> 02:27:36,160
Because I never did buy that UPS or whatever I'm supposed to get.

2340
02:27:36,160 --> 02:27:36,960
UPS?

2341
02:27:36,960 --> 02:27:40,800
What the universal power source or whatever the thing's called?

2342
02:27:40,800 --> 02:27:42,240
Uninterrupted power supply.

2343
02:27:42,240 --> 02:27:42,740
That's it.

2344
02:27:43,600 --> 02:27:44,320
I was close.

2345
02:27:44,320 --> 02:27:44,820
Oh.

2346
02:27:45,760 --> 02:27:46,240
Do you remember?

2347
02:27:46,240 --> 02:27:48,080
Oh, you weren't here that week.

2348
02:27:48,080 --> 02:27:49,840
Because it was Flaco that was here that week.

2349
02:27:49,840 --> 02:27:51,040
He was like filling in for you.

2350
02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:54,480
The power went out completely and we lost the show.

2351
02:27:54,480 --> 02:27:55,760
Flaco was here and I missed it?

2352
02:27:55,760 --> 02:27:57,440
Yeah, well, he'll come back.

2353
02:27:57,440 --> 02:27:59,520
I'm sure if you ask him really nicely too, he'll come back.

2354
02:28:01,520 --> 02:28:02,640
This is a long time ago.

2355
02:28:02,640 --> 02:28:04,560
This was when we were doing the show at the apartment.

2356
02:28:04,560 --> 02:28:05,360
It was a while ago.

2357
02:28:07,200 --> 02:28:08,000
Stop whining.

2358
02:28:09,520 --> 02:28:10,020
No.

2359
02:28:10,640 --> 02:28:11,140
Whatever.

2360
02:28:11,920 --> 02:28:13,200
I see how it is, Flaco.

2361
02:28:13,840 --> 02:28:17,840
Well, then I guess clearly somebody is in the mood to get to the FUs of the week.

2362
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:19,360
Shall we get to the FUs of the week?

2363
02:28:20,640 --> 02:28:21,280
Whatevs.

2364
02:28:38,480 --> 02:28:41,440
FU to stuff I cannot discuss.

2365
02:28:42,960 --> 02:28:43,840
Reasons and things.

2366
02:28:44,800 --> 02:28:49,520
FU to my dear friend having crappy pneumonia like I did a few years ago.

2367
02:28:49,520 --> 02:28:50,080
You remember that?

2368
02:28:50,640 --> 02:28:52,880
I have a friend now going through almost exactly the same thing.

2369
02:28:52,880 --> 02:28:55,040
Yeah, I think that's why Flaco filled in for you that week.

2370
02:28:55,920 --> 02:28:57,040
That was years and years ago.

2371
02:28:57,040 --> 02:28:57,680
Oh, okay.

2372
02:28:57,680 --> 02:29:00,560
That was when I was still working at Hellhole.

2373
02:29:00,560 --> 02:29:01,060
Oh, dear.

2374
02:29:03,120 --> 02:29:05,120
Well, it didn't start off as Hellhole, but anyway.

2375
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:13,680
The other FU goes towards having this creative outlet that I love, love, love,

2376
02:29:13,680 --> 02:29:15,840
that I can't stop working on.

2377
02:29:16,800 --> 02:29:18,480
And now, well, it's not this show.

2378
02:29:19,600 --> 02:29:20,320
You know what?

2379
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:22,080
Love, you mean it.

2380
02:29:22,080 --> 02:29:22,400
I'm sorry.

2381
02:29:22,400 --> 02:29:22,880
I had to.

2382
02:29:22,880 --> 02:29:23,360
Come on.

2383
02:29:23,360 --> 02:29:24,640
You left yourself wide open for that.

2384
02:29:25,600 --> 02:29:28,000
I've got stuff in the works for the show.

2385
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:28,640
Okay.

2386
02:29:28,640 --> 02:29:30,800
I told you, keep doing things.

2387
02:29:31,360 --> 02:29:32,240
Stuff's happening.

2388
02:29:32,880 --> 02:29:35,760
I will move mountains for OLR if they're really tiny, tiny, tiny.

2389
02:29:35,760 --> 02:29:38,960
By mountains, she means giant swollen balls again.

2390
02:29:38,960 --> 02:29:40,240
Or psychically thrown trucks.

2391
02:29:40,240 --> 02:29:42,560
I will kick some giant swollen balls.

2392
02:29:42,640 --> 02:29:44,320
Psychically thrown testicles.

2393
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:46,080
There you go.

2394
02:29:46,800 --> 02:29:47,360
That's it.

2395
02:29:47,360 --> 02:29:48,240
We need a game.

2396
02:29:48,240 --> 02:29:48,480
Okay.

2397
02:29:48,480 --> 02:29:49,360
Do you remember?

2398
02:29:49,360 --> 02:29:50,400
Psycho testicles.

2399
02:29:50,400 --> 02:29:52,240
Pause, pause the music, pause the music, pause the music.

2400
02:29:52,240 --> 02:29:53,200
Yes, ma'am.

2401
02:29:53,200 --> 02:29:54,960
Do you remember the game, the game?

2402
02:29:54,960 --> 02:29:55,280
No.

2403
02:29:55,280 --> 02:29:58,720
When they had that like meeting going on and someone put in.

2404
02:29:58,720 --> 02:30:00,720
Like psycho knots and psycho nuts.

2405
02:30:00,720 --> 02:30:01,280
Let her finish.

2406
02:30:01,280 --> 02:30:02,080
Hold on.

2407
02:30:02,080 --> 02:30:05,840
And someone had like one of those little drone helicopter things, except it was a big

2408
02:30:06,560 --> 02:30:08,880
dick with balls floating around.

2409
02:30:09,600 --> 02:30:11,040
We need a helicopter game.

2410
02:30:11,440 --> 02:30:14,480
Called, um, what did you just call it?

2411
02:30:14,480 --> 02:30:20,720
Protector nuts, psycho, psycho nuts, psycho nuts, a shooter game called psycho nuts.

2412
02:30:20,720 --> 02:30:25,920
It's a little helicopter, Dick going around and shooting down all of our enemies.

2413
02:30:25,920 --> 02:30:28,480
It's like shoplifter, but cocklifter.

2414
02:30:29,280 --> 02:30:30,480
I like that even better.

2415
02:30:31,360 --> 02:30:34,800
I agree with dark Tetsuya in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

2416
02:30:34,800 --> 02:30:35,200
Wow.

2417
02:30:35,200 --> 02:30:36,000
Tonight's show.

2418
02:30:37,600 --> 02:30:39,120
We've earned our M rating.

2419
02:30:39,440 --> 02:30:42,720
Uh, we've, we've earned our, I am reading in the chair.

2420
02:30:43,680 --> 02:30:44,000
All right.

2421
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:45,920
Do we, do we have, can I bring the music back?

2422
02:30:45,920 --> 02:30:47,040
I guess.

2423
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:47,280
All right.

2424
02:30:47,280 --> 02:30:48,640
Loki, you're a fuse.

2425
02:30:48,640 --> 02:30:55,040
Uh, my after the week, I guess goes to just, I don't know, being distracted because

2426
02:30:55,840 --> 02:30:59,280
unfortunately I've been trying to work on my game and stuff, but when I get tired,

2427
02:30:59,280 --> 02:31:05,520
yeah, sometimes the internet distracts me and end up watching tons of YouTube videos

2428
02:31:05,520 --> 02:31:06,160
for no reason.

2429
02:31:09,440 --> 02:31:10,000
That's it.

2430
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:10,560
That's it.

2431
02:31:10,560 --> 02:31:10,960
All right.

2432
02:31:10,960 --> 02:31:12,960
Um, stop it.

2433
02:31:12,960 --> 02:31:17,600
Uh, I have a really big epic FU I want to give, but I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm

2434
02:31:17,600 --> 02:31:21,040
going to be the bigger person, just bite my fricking tongue at least for one more week.

2435
02:31:21,040 --> 02:31:26,960
Um, but I will say this, I will give a, a more lighthearted FU to the Carolina hurricanes,

2436
02:31:27,520 --> 02:31:33,520
uh, for beating the San Jose sharks last night at my first ever hockey game that I went to

2437
02:31:33,520 --> 02:31:34,560
since I was in San Jose.

2438
02:31:34,560 --> 02:31:37,920
Anyway, my friends were like, Hey, you want to go to the sharks game tonight?

2439
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:39,600
I was like, all right, sure.

2440
02:31:39,600 --> 02:31:40,720
I've never been to a hockey game.

2441
02:31:40,720 --> 02:31:41,280
What the hell?

2442
02:31:41,280 --> 02:31:43,840
So I went to my very first sharks game ever.

2443
02:31:43,840 --> 02:31:46,400
And, um, now you get your official bro license.

2444
02:31:46,400 --> 02:31:47,040
The team lost.

2445
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:47,280
Yes.

2446
02:31:47,280 --> 02:31:48,160
And now I'm a bro.

2447
02:31:51,680 --> 02:31:52,400
Pop that color.

2448
02:31:55,760 --> 02:31:58,320
Hey, Loki, you want to go bro out?

2449
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:07,520
No, I've only been in one hockey game too, but it was, it was one word for you.

2450
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:08,320
What?

2451
02:32:09,520 --> 02:32:10,640
Dodge nads.

2452
02:32:10,640 --> 02:32:12,480
I, I will say this though.

2453
02:32:12,480 --> 02:32:18,480
And I somewhere, somewhere SSG100 Matt is going to be beaming when I say this, but I

2454
02:32:18,480 --> 02:32:22,320
actually really, really enjoyed myself and I want to go again.

2455
02:32:24,160 --> 02:32:24,800
Go sharks.

2456
02:32:25,920 --> 02:32:26,560
All right.

2457
02:32:26,560 --> 02:32:30,560
I think my favorite thing in the world was when they put the guy in the penalty box,

2458
02:32:30,560 --> 02:32:32,000
they would put it up on the big screen.

2459
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:35,920
And when it was the opposing team, the dude would go in the penalty box and the big shark

2460
02:32:35,920 --> 02:32:38,160
teeth would come down and go chomp, chomp, chomp.

2461
02:32:39,120 --> 02:32:43,120
I don't know why, but that made me cackle like nothing else the entire night.

2462
02:32:43,120 --> 02:32:45,920
Cause the whole audience would do the chomp, chomp, chomp thing.

2463
02:32:46,560 --> 02:32:50,240
And I'm like, that guy has to sit in a box and think about what he did.

2464
02:32:52,400 --> 02:32:55,840
I'm like only in hockey where you get arrested for hooking.

2465
02:32:56,880 --> 02:32:57,920
That guy's a hooker.

2466
02:32:58,720 --> 02:32:59,120
All right.

2467
02:32:59,120 --> 02:33:01,520
Anyway, were there any fights that broke out?

2468
02:33:01,520 --> 02:33:03,920
Uh, no, but there was a dog pile, but no fights.

2469
02:33:03,920 --> 02:33:05,040
I want, Oh my God.

2470
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:07,200
I wanted to go down there and punch some guy in the face.

2471
02:33:07,200 --> 02:33:08,880
I was that little sneaky little.

2472
02:33:09,600 --> 02:33:11,760
You want to know two facts?

2473
02:33:11,760 --> 02:33:12,260
What?

2474
02:33:12,720 --> 02:33:16,160
There are two fluids that will bounce on ice, blood and vomit.

2475
02:33:17,760 --> 02:33:21,920
Well, I unfortunately saw neither at the, uh, haven't lived show.

2476
02:33:21,920 --> 02:33:22,480
I know.

2477
02:33:22,480 --> 02:33:22,980
I know.

2478
02:33:23,520 --> 02:33:24,480
So there you go.

2479
02:33:24,480 --> 02:33:27,520
Perhaps my son will when he goes to Disney on ice this weekend.

2480
02:33:31,120 --> 02:33:33,520
I don't think a fight is supposed to break out.

2481
02:33:34,480 --> 02:33:35,680
It'd be unexpected.

2482
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:36,720
I love that.

2483
02:33:36,720 --> 02:33:37,760
Unfortunately, I'm not going.

2484
02:33:37,760 --> 02:33:39,040
So, all right.

2485
02:33:39,040 --> 02:33:43,440
SSU and Hunter Madden chat says, Rob, going to an NHL game is the greatest crossover.

2486
02:33:44,080 --> 02:33:46,160
And as you went under, Matt says, Rob, I'll go with you.

2487
02:33:46,160 --> 02:33:46,480
Fine.

2488
02:33:46,480 --> 02:33:47,200
I'll come out.

2489
02:33:47,200 --> 02:33:47,760
What's your team?

2490
02:33:48,480 --> 02:33:49,920
It's gotta be New York.

2491
02:33:49,920 --> 02:33:52,080
So I'll, uh, I'll come to New York city.

2492
02:33:52,080 --> 02:33:53,200
We'll go to a game.

2493
02:33:53,200 --> 02:33:54,640
Do they ever get to play the sharks?

2494
02:33:54,640 --> 02:33:55,680
I'm still learning.

2495
02:33:55,680 --> 02:33:56,240
Bear with me here.

2496
02:33:56,240 --> 02:33:57,440
I don't know what teams are in what league.

2497
02:33:57,440 --> 02:33:57,940
You know what?

2498
02:33:59,120 --> 02:34:02,880
My, um, hometown, Mobile, Alabama has a hockey team.

2499
02:34:02,880 --> 02:34:07,440
It's not NHL, but they have a team called the mystics S S T I C K S.

2500
02:34:08,480 --> 02:34:09,200
Oh, I like that.

2501
02:34:09,200 --> 02:34:10,240
That's a clever name.

2502
02:34:10,240 --> 02:34:14,480
I did find it interesting though, that the Carolina hurricanes there, cause you know,

2503
02:34:14,480 --> 02:34:18,080
I'm just, as somebody who's kind of newer to this, I'm, I'm not going to be able to help,

2504
02:34:18,080 --> 02:34:22,880
but judge teams based on their colors, their mascots and their logos.

2505
02:34:22,880 --> 02:34:23,360
Right?

2506
02:34:23,360 --> 02:34:23,600
Yeah.

2507
02:34:23,600 --> 02:34:24,720
That's what it's important.

2508
02:34:24,720 --> 02:34:27,840
It's very important in choosing like what team you're going to root for.

2509
02:34:27,840 --> 02:34:31,680
And the sharks, you know, I got to say, not just the fact that they're a local team,

2510
02:34:31,680 --> 02:34:33,120
but teal's a rad color.

2511
02:34:33,920 --> 02:34:37,040
The fact that they can play in a shark tank is hilarious.

2512
02:34:37,040 --> 02:34:39,120
And shark is an amazing mascot.

2513
02:34:39,120 --> 02:34:41,120
It's a, it's, it's, it's a win-win all around.

2514
02:34:41,120 --> 02:34:46,240
Especially now that we have the super bowl shark, shark mascots are trending upwards.

2515
02:34:46,240 --> 02:34:46,960
That's right.

2516
02:34:46,960 --> 02:34:47,920
I know there was a mission.

2517
02:34:47,920 --> 02:34:51,280
I did an ingress where it was about the sharks, but I got left shark as my badge.

2518
02:34:51,280 --> 02:34:52,480
But anyway, I digress.

2519
02:34:53,200 --> 02:34:57,760
The Carolina hurricanes, their logo looks like a red butthole.

2520
02:34:57,760 --> 02:35:00,560
Like that's the logo for their team.

2521
02:35:00,560 --> 02:35:04,640
And I'm like, we're, we just lost to the red buttholes.

2522
02:35:06,720 --> 02:35:09,360
How did a shark lose to a butthole?

2523
02:35:10,640 --> 02:35:11,040
Anyway.

2524
02:35:11,760 --> 02:35:16,000
Well, it could have been a whale butthole in which case, you know, I could see that

2525
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:17,280
there wouldn't be competition there.

2526
02:35:18,640 --> 02:35:19,120
Anyway.

2527
02:35:19,120 --> 02:35:19,680
All right.

2528
02:35:19,680 --> 02:35:20,560
Put them together though.

2529
02:35:20,560 --> 02:35:22,560
You get sharknado because the sharks are hurricane.

2530
02:35:22,560 --> 02:35:22,800
All right.

2531
02:35:22,800 --> 02:35:24,960
Anyway, I'm moving on.

2532
02:35:26,800 --> 02:35:27,840
There's going to be a week.

2533
02:35:27,840 --> 02:35:30,000
I come on this show and you're going to be like, how was your gaming week?

2534
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:31,360
I'm going to be like, you know what?

2535
02:35:31,360 --> 02:35:34,800
I played NHL 15 played blades of steel.

2536
02:35:34,800 --> 02:35:37,680
He gave you like, which is also on the, who is Rob?

2537
02:35:37,680 --> 02:35:39,200
Where did you do with him?

2538
02:35:39,200 --> 02:35:39,520
All right.

2539
02:35:39,520 --> 02:35:41,760
Anyway, uh, just a couple more stories for you guys.

2540
02:35:41,760 --> 02:35:44,480
Then we're going to get to our Skype line at one eight seven seven game.

2541
02:35:44,480 --> 02:35:48,000
Olr or a username on Skype is orange lounge radio.

2542
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:48,400
Loki.

2543
02:35:48,400 --> 02:35:52,640
They may have been wondering, what does all that shark talk have to do with anything in

2544
02:35:52,640 --> 02:35:53,040
gaming?

2545
02:35:53,040 --> 02:35:57,440
Well, I'm about to tell you because they're going to make a Katy Perry game.

2546
02:35:57,920 --> 02:35:58,480
That's right.

2547
02:35:58,480 --> 02:36:02,880
Katy Perry as in, you know, the one dance with sharks during the super bowl half time.

2548
02:36:03,600 --> 02:36:08,160
And it's coming to you from glue mobile who was behind Kim Kardashian in Hollywood.

2549
02:36:08,160 --> 02:36:11,520
So you have to know that which has a great soundtrack.

2550
02:36:13,360 --> 02:36:18,480
You can hate on Kim Kardashian, Hollywood, all you want, but the soundtrack is awesome.

2551
02:36:18,480 --> 02:36:21,920
I'm telling you, this is one of those games that I'm thank God that you do not have eye

2552
02:36:21,920 --> 02:36:26,720
tracking software because it just wouldn't be for me.

2553
02:36:27,440 --> 02:36:28,880
Why do you keep looking at the shark?

2554
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:31,440
Because they're so awesome.

2555
02:36:32,240 --> 02:36:34,800
I seriously want one of those for like Halloween.

2556
02:36:35,520 --> 02:36:41,840
I have a feeling that's going to be a really overdone, like cosplay and Halloween costume

2557
02:36:41,840 --> 02:36:42,800
later this year.

2558
02:36:42,800 --> 02:36:46,480
But there's still a lot of time for a new meme to show up between now and Halloween.

2559
02:36:46,480 --> 02:36:48,080
So there's a lot of time.

2560
02:36:48,080 --> 02:36:48,800
We'll see.

2561
02:36:48,800 --> 02:36:49,680
There's a lot of time.

2562
02:36:51,200 --> 02:36:51,600
All right.

2563
02:36:51,600 --> 02:36:55,040
But, uh, yeah, um, I'm not sure when it's supposed to be coming out.

2564
02:36:55,040 --> 02:37:01,040
Apparently they're saying that, uh, Android or they have, uh, a five year deal with, uh,

2565
02:37:02,240 --> 02:37:06,640
Katy Perry that they're going to put out, you know, some games, um, apparently on Android

2566
02:37:06,640 --> 02:37:09,520
and iOS and I don't know.

2567
02:37:09,520 --> 02:37:12,080
So hopefully, well, maybe we'll see that soon.

2568
02:37:13,360 --> 02:37:17,760
William murder face with the lulls and chat saying it's a shame that the Katy Perry game

2569
02:37:17,760 --> 02:37:19,280
won't be made by dark horse.

2570
02:37:20,240 --> 02:37:20,560
Get it?

2571
02:37:20,560 --> 02:37:22,080
Cause she has a song called dark.

2572
02:37:23,760 --> 02:37:24,320
I understand.

2573
02:37:25,600 --> 02:37:31,120
Hey, from Katy Perry to doctor who, I don't know what those two things have in common

2574
02:37:31,120 --> 02:37:34,000
whatsoever, but, uh, work with me here on this transition.

2575
02:37:34,720 --> 02:37:38,960
Apparently there's a new doctor who game that will help kids learn to code.

2576
02:37:39,600 --> 02:37:45,760
It's a free doctor who game, uh, available from the BBC called the doctor and the Dalek.

2577
02:37:45,760 --> 02:37:49,280
It's available on Android, iOS, and Amazon app stores.

2578
02:37:49,280 --> 02:37:54,400
And it's a platforming adventure, but it includes logic based programming.

2579
02:37:54,400 --> 02:37:58,720
You know, if, then, or, and all those types of things you see in programming.

2580
02:37:58,720 --> 02:38:01,360
Peter Capaldi actually lends his voice to the game.

2581
02:38:01,360 --> 02:38:07,440
It was written by Phil Ford, one of the series writers, there's three worlds and 12 levels.

2582
02:38:07,440 --> 02:38:12,320
And you will go on the hunt for the orb of fates, an ancient device from the time war

2583
02:38:12,320 --> 02:38:16,160
that unlocks the star bane, a weapon that can wipe out whole solar systems.

2584
02:38:16,160 --> 02:38:18,720
And of course the Dalek and the cyber men are fighting over this.

2585
02:38:18,720 --> 02:38:20,800
So the doctor serves as a mentor.

2586
02:38:20,800 --> 02:38:22,560
He is not the main character.

2587
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:28,080
He's helping to control a reprogrammed Dalek in search of the artifact.

2588
02:38:28,800 --> 02:38:34,080
BBC learning commissioned this game and it ties into the IT curriculum that the

2589
02:38:34,080 --> 02:38:37,680
government has been focusing on over there with modern computer skills.

2590
02:38:37,680 --> 02:38:38,720
That sounds like fun.

2591
02:38:38,720 --> 02:38:41,360
It sounds like a modern version of something like Rocky's boots.

2592
02:38:42,080 --> 02:38:46,000
But now using characters, you know, from doctor who beloved series like that.

2593
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:47,680
Dark Sakura, would you check this out?

2594
02:38:47,680 --> 02:38:48,960
You want to learn some programming?

2595
02:38:49,760 --> 02:38:52,320
Although I'm sure the basics are things you probably already aware of,

2596
02:38:52,320 --> 02:38:55,040
but I'd suggest it to people.

2597
02:38:55,040 --> 02:38:55,600
Yeah.

2598
02:38:55,600 --> 02:38:56,640
That'd be fun to check out.

2599
02:38:56,640 --> 02:38:57,140
Yeah.

2600
02:38:57,600 --> 02:38:58,100
All right.

2601
02:38:58,640 --> 02:39:02,000
Loki, you want to play some doctor who learned a thing or two about programming?

2602
02:39:02,880 --> 02:39:05,040
Uh, kind of already doing that.

2603
02:39:05,040 --> 02:39:05,920
I think it's good.

2604
02:39:05,920 --> 02:39:08,880
I like that they have that type of stuff that makes it accessible.

2605
02:39:08,880 --> 02:39:11,120
Anything to get more people interested in that kind of stuff.

2606
02:39:11,120 --> 02:39:11,680
I do too.

2607
02:39:11,680 --> 02:39:14,320
This type of stuff I wish was around when I was a kid, to be honest.

2608
02:39:14,320 --> 02:39:15,360
I really wish so.

2609
02:39:16,320 --> 02:39:16,720
All right.

2610
02:39:16,720 --> 02:39:20,240
Well, uh, that does it for the news tonight that we had on deck.

2611
02:39:20,240 --> 02:39:21,760
So let's open up the Skype line.

2612
02:39:21,760 --> 02:39:26,240
It's open 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2613
02:39:26,240 --> 02:39:26,800
All one word.

2614
02:39:26,800 --> 02:39:30,000
If you want to give us a call, Skype line is open now.

2615
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:33,600
In the meantime, I'll turn to Loki and see real quick if he has any last minute stories.

2616
02:39:33,600 --> 02:39:34,480
I do not.

2617
02:39:34,480 --> 02:39:35,040
You do not.

2618
02:39:35,840 --> 02:39:37,040
It's a slow news week.

2619
02:39:37,920 --> 02:39:38,560
It has been.

2620
02:39:38,560 --> 02:39:41,440
There hasn't been as much going on this week as previous weeks.

2621
02:39:41,440 --> 02:39:45,840
Just, but there's been like, it's just a few big things, you know, like the Zelda

2622
02:39:45,840 --> 02:39:47,840
rumor, which isn't even really news.

2623
02:39:48,720 --> 02:39:51,360
I'm going to try to go to the Twitter here while we wait for some calls, but Oh,

2624
02:39:51,520 --> 02:39:52,640
Hey, the phones are lighting up.

2625
02:39:52,640 --> 02:39:52,960
Hooray.

2626
02:39:52,960 --> 02:39:53,520
Let's get to it.

2627
02:39:53,520 --> 02:39:56,400
We do have a call on the line, so let's get to it.

2628
02:39:56,400 --> 02:39:57,440
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2629
02:39:57,440 --> 02:39:58,240
Who's this?

2630
02:39:58,240 --> 02:39:59,520
Hey guys, it's Jason.

2631
02:39:59,520 --> 02:40:00,320
Hey, Jason.

2632
02:40:00,320 --> 02:40:01,200
Good to see you.

2633
02:40:01,200 --> 02:40:02,640
I see you on the webcams.

2634
02:40:02,640 --> 02:40:02,960
Yes.

2635
02:40:02,960 --> 02:40:06,000
With your epic new microphone, which I'm so jealous of.

2636
02:40:07,520 --> 02:40:07,840
Yeah.

2637
02:40:07,840 --> 02:40:11,600
If anybody, uh, if anybody hasn't really noticed, go listen to last week's episode

2638
02:40:11,600 --> 02:40:12,960
and then listen to this week's episode.

2639
02:40:12,960 --> 02:40:16,800
There's a tiny, tiny, a little bit of a difference.

2640
02:40:16,800 --> 02:40:17,360
Yeah.

2641
02:40:17,360 --> 02:40:20,400
If you, if you didn't notice, Jason has an epic new microphone.

2642
02:40:20,400 --> 02:40:21,120
It's great.

2643
02:40:21,360 --> 02:40:25,440
Well, they didn't, cause I haven't actually like posted anything about it publicly yet.

2644
02:40:25,440 --> 02:40:29,520
Just a bunch of, uh, a bunch of friends, a couple of coworkers, and then some people

2645
02:40:29,520 --> 02:40:33,520
that I do things with on a, on Twitch actually have seen it so far.

2646
02:40:33,520 --> 02:40:36,240
We're all waiting for you to start a new podcast at some point.

2647
02:40:36,240 --> 02:40:38,480
I'm sure, I'm sure that's going to be a thing someday.

2648
02:40:38,480 --> 02:40:42,320
There's, there's a lot of stuff going on right now.

2649
02:40:42,320 --> 02:40:45,600
And it's basically just seen, seen what can actually be committed to.

2650
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:46,240
I understand.

2651
02:40:46,240 --> 02:40:47,600
Well, anyway, enough about all that.

2652
02:40:47,600 --> 02:40:48,480
What's on your mind tonight?

2653
02:40:48,960 --> 02:40:52,720
So we were having this discussion right at the top of the show, um, the discussion of

2654
02:40:52,720 --> 02:40:55,600
Netflix and the 3DS and all that stuff, uh, kind of tangled in.

2655
02:40:55,600 --> 02:40:58,560
And I said something that I've never really thought about before.

2656
02:40:58,560 --> 02:41:06,000
Um, I said 3D is the sixties sci-fi expectation of immersion in the future.

2657
02:41:06,880 --> 02:41:12,240
And I think, uh, I said it, so I'm admittedly biased, but I think that was actually like

2658
02:41:12,240 --> 02:41:13,920
a shockingly accurate thing to say.

2659
02:41:13,920 --> 02:41:20,000
Like they, 3D, 3D is, is still a very interesting effect.

2660
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:23,440
You know, depth simulated depth is still a huge thing.

2661
02:41:23,440 --> 02:41:29,680
Um, but considering that it's just limited to watching and experience, we've already

2662
02:41:29,680 --> 02:41:30,800
surpassed that.

2663
02:41:31,520 --> 02:41:37,520
Um, the, the point that I made in the conversation in chat was that even if it's not 3D computers

2664
02:41:37,520 --> 02:41:43,840
and the internet have already completely usurped that because we can virtually be,

2665
02:41:44,160 --> 02:41:49,120
anywhere in the world around virtually be around whoever we want to be around and have

2666
02:41:49,120 --> 02:41:54,000
these, you know, previously impossible kind of connections with people and places and

2667
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:59,600
things, not physically, but that's not necessarily always a requirement.

2668
02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:04,000
I'm just, some day, Jason, as weird as it sounds, and I know people are going to take

2669
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,240
this to a dirty place, but hear me out here.

2670
02:42:06,240 --> 02:42:10,000
Some day, Jason, you're going to be able to feel them too, even though they might not

2671
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:11,120
necessarily be right there.

2672
02:42:11,120 --> 02:42:13,200
I mean, everything is one step closer to the holodeck.

2673
02:42:13,200 --> 02:42:15,920
That's some day, but science fiction, right?

2674
02:42:15,920 --> 02:42:21,520
You talk about the sixties 3D, I'm talking about star Trek, which to be fair is the sixties

2675
02:42:21,520 --> 02:42:24,640
originally, but I guess my mind, my mind is set on next generation.

2676
02:42:24,640 --> 02:42:25,360
Okay.

2677
02:42:25,360 --> 02:42:27,040
Star Trek is next generation to me.

2678
02:42:27,040 --> 02:42:31,440
So, uh, I just think about the holodeck and how a lot of gaming stuff gets one step closer

2679
02:42:31,440 --> 02:42:32,000
to it.

2680
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:32,320
Yeah.

2681
02:42:32,320 --> 02:42:33,440
And it's just interesting.

2682
02:42:33,440 --> 02:42:38,480
It's just funny that the way that we're getting there is also with no concept of touch, touch

2683
02:42:38,480 --> 02:42:40,800
reactive, but no concept of touch.

2684
02:42:41,600 --> 02:42:43,840
Akuma JP in chat with a good point though.

2685
02:42:43,840 --> 02:42:44,960
Well, we can print it.

2686
02:42:45,600 --> 02:42:48,800
So we are, I mean, we are getting closer to that touch.

2687
02:42:48,800 --> 02:42:55,520
I mean, you can, you can visualize it and you can make it granted, maybe not today.

2688
02:42:55,520 --> 02:43:00,160
Like there's a lot of limitations on what it is you can do, but when they're advertising

2689
02:43:00,160 --> 02:43:04,800
a fucking three dimensional pen in sky mall, rest in peace.

2690
02:43:05,520 --> 02:43:09,760
And now, you know, where I saw this last on a plane, I'm like, the future is here.

2691
02:43:11,040 --> 02:43:16,960
It's a, those, those, I don't even know what the proper, what the proper marketing name

2692
02:43:16,960 --> 02:43:17,440
for it is.

2693
02:43:17,440 --> 02:43:22,320
I want to call them like sky writing pins, uh, are definitely interesting.

2694
02:43:22,320 --> 02:43:27,280
I, I think I'm going to have a disconnect from it until I can actually get my hands

2695
02:43:27,280 --> 02:43:27,840
on it.

2696
02:43:27,840 --> 02:43:31,920
Not to mention, I'm not exactly the creative type in that way anyways.

2697
02:43:31,920 --> 02:43:34,640
So, but yeah, it's, it's absolutely interesting.

2698
02:43:34,640 --> 02:43:39,680
3d printing, uh, both at the personal scale as well as the professional scale.

2699
02:43:39,680 --> 02:43:42,560
Like that is, that is a huge step forward.

2700
02:43:42,560 --> 02:43:46,960
I think the problem is, is that printing has a lot of permanence to it.

2701
02:43:46,960 --> 02:43:53,280
Um, that it's still like worlds away from being holodeck, from being seen creation,

2702
02:43:53,280 --> 02:43:56,880
destruction and rebuilding and anything along those lines.

2703
02:43:56,880 --> 02:44:00,880
Like 3d printing is going to be better for, uh, architecture.

2704
02:44:00,880 --> 02:44:04,320
And there's been talk about like medical 3d printing and all that kind of stuff.

2705
02:44:04,320 --> 02:44:10,560
Like that's going to apply with permanence, with things that have to have a place in the

2706
02:44:10,560 --> 02:44:10,880
world.

2707
02:44:12,240 --> 02:44:15,200
So, uh, it's just, it's just crazy seeing how far we've come.

2708
02:44:15,200 --> 02:44:19,280
And if you think about it, all this 3d printing stuff, this technology is still really, really

2709
02:44:19,280 --> 02:44:20,080
new and emerging.

2710
02:44:20,080 --> 02:44:23,840
I mean, this is only really within the past two years, you know, that we're seeing this

2711
02:44:23,840 --> 02:44:27,680
really start to take off and it's, it's really weird to think like, where the hell are we

2712
02:44:27,680 --> 02:44:29,280
going to be in five more years?

2713
02:44:29,280 --> 02:44:33,760
Yeah, it's, it's the best time to be, it's the best time to be a geek.

2714
02:44:33,760 --> 02:44:36,400
What a time to be alive, even more the truth.

2715
02:44:36,400 --> 02:44:38,000
What a time to be alive, right?

2716
02:44:38,880 --> 02:44:44,720
I've talked about, uh, as, as like gaming has kind of come and gone, uh, as I have kind

2717
02:44:44,720 --> 02:44:46,960
of gotten into and out of gaming and that kind of stuff.

2718
02:44:46,960 --> 02:44:54,560
I've always talked about as a kid, I always identified as a gamer, but in my adulthood,

2719
02:44:54,560 --> 02:44:59,360
both professionally and personally, I've kind of noticed that it's just tech centric and

2720
02:44:59,360 --> 02:45:01,280
gaming was kind of the best expression of that.

2721
02:45:01,280 --> 02:45:02,960
I play games on a console.

2722
02:45:02,960 --> 02:45:04,240
I play games on a computer.

2723
02:45:04,240 --> 02:45:04,960
I'm a gamer.

2724
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:13,280
But I've kind of noticed that I'm more general tech and just very, very happily gaming is

2725
02:45:13,280 --> 02:45:17,680
one of, you know, the, the primary subdivisions categories, whatever you want to call it.

2726
02:45:17,680 --> 02:45:21,440
It's kind of funny you put it that way, because if you think about it, the evolution of this

2727
02:45:21,440 --> 02:45:24,640
show, this very show has gone down a very similar path, right?

2728
02:45:24,640 --> 02:45:28,720
We were about DDR and then it was, well, we've got to talk about some more music games cause

2729
02:45:28,720 --> 02:45:29,840
we're not making DDR.

2730
02:45:29,840 --> 02:45:33,760
And then it was, well, I guess really we just like video games and DDR is just the video

2731
02:45:33,760 --> 02:45:35,040
game we're all playing right now.

2732
02:45:35,040 --> 02:45:36,400
Let's talk about video games.

2733
02:45:36,400 --> 02:45:38,720
And now we're on the voice of geeks network.

2734
02:45:38,720 --> 02:45:41,920
It turns out video games is really just one of many geeky things I'm into, you know?

2735
02:45:41,920 --> 02:45:42,480
Absolutely.

2736
02:45:42,480 --> 02:45:47,520
I think there's a lot of crossover, although admittedly, because I focus so much time on

2737
02:45:47,520 --> 02:45:52,880
gaming, I don't get a chance to watch as much anime, but I appreciate that fandom.

2738
02:45:52,880 --> 02:45:53,760
It's there.

2739
02:45:53,760 --> 02:45:58,720
There's a lot of fun stuff that goes on over there, but we've got Rama and Patty and Ari

2740
02:45:58,720 --> 02:46:01,440
talking about all that over on the anime jam session and so forth.

2741
02:46:01,440 --> 02:46:04,240
That's why I love what we're doing here at VOG and so forth.

2742
02:46:04,240 --> 02:46:08,480
So absolutely leave it to the people that can speak definitively on that and be a very

2743
02:46:08,480 --> 02:46:11,200
happy enabler or just a fan.

2744
02:46:11,200 --> 02:46:12,240
Yeah, exactly.

2745
02:46:12,240 --> 02:46:12,960
Exactly.

2746
02:46:12,960 --> 02:46:13,520
Anyway, sorry.

2747
02:46:13,520 --> 02:46:17,280
Not to, not to turn your call into self-promotion, but you know, it's gonna happen.

2748
02:46:17,280 --> 02:46:18,480
Sometimes it's gonna happen.

2749
02:46:18,480 --> 02:46:21,600
I like, I like the, uh, the, the philosophic.

2750
02:46:22,240 --> 02:46:24,320
Is that even a proper conjunction?

2751
02:46:24,320 --> 02:46:25,360
I like philosophical.

2752
02:46:25,360 --> 02:46:25,760
Thank you.

2753
02:46:25,760 --> 02:46:27,520
I like philosophical topics.

2754
02:46:27,520 --> 02:46:29,200
Right word, wrong pronunciation.

2755
02:46:31,760 --> 02:46:32,240
Whatever.

2756
02:46:32,240 --> 02:46:33,360
That's all right.

2757
02:46:33,360 --> 02:46:34,080
English.

2758
02:46:34,080 --> 02:46:34,560
That's all right.

2759
02:46:34,560 --> 02:46:36,400
That's why you're the perfect voiceover guy.

2760
02:46:36,400 --> 02:46:36,720
All right.

2761
02:46:38,240 --> 02:46:40,320
Uh, if you, I'll take your word for that one.

2762
02:46:40,320 --> 02:46:41,040
All right.

2763
02:46:41,040 --> 02:46:43,200
All right, my friend, I'm gonna let you go so we can get some more calls.

2764
02:46:43,200 --> 02:46:44,000
Have a good night, everyone.

2765
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:45,360
Talk to you in the future.

2766
02:46:46,880 --> 02:46:47,120
All right.

2767
02:46:47,120 --> 02:46:47,680
Bye.

2768
02:46:47,680 --> 02:46:48,180
Bye.

2769
02:46:48,880 --> 02:46:53,440
1-877-GAMO-L-R or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2770
02:46:53,440 --> 02:46:56,880
I'm always happy when Jason calls in the show so I can check on his beard progress.

2771
02:46:58,160 --> 02:46:58,400
Man.

2772
02:46:58,400 --> 02:46:59,360
It's amazing.

2773
02:46:59,360 --> 02:47:03,040
You know, there's, there's going to come a day though when Jason's going to be like,

2774
02:47:03,040 --> 02:47:04,240
yeah, I just shaved it off.

2775
02:47:04,240 --> 02:47:06,720
You know, I just, I just felt like shaving it off.

2776
02:47:06,720 --> 02:47:13,280
I'm going to tell Jason what I told our friend, Will, that he needs to braid it like a dwarf.

2777
02:47:13,920 --> 02:47:17,520
No, he needs, no, Jason looks just dwarven braids.

2778
02:47:17,520 --> 02:47:20,560
But if he ever does come that day where he's just going to be like, you know what?

2779
02:47:20,560 --> 02:47:21,920
I'm just going to shave it off.

2780
02:47:21,920 --> 02:47:26,000
He needs to like donate the hair to one of those charities that makes wigs or something.

2781
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:29,200
I actually wonder what happens if you take a straightener to a beard.

2782
02:47:30,480 --> 02:47:30,880
I don't know.

2783
02:47:32,240 --> 02:47:35,680
I want someone to show me what it looks like when you use a hair straightener on a beard.

2784
02:47:38,560 --> 02:47:40,720
Isn't the answer on Reddit or Google somewhere?

2785
02:47:40,720 --> 02:47:41,680
I'm about to Google this shit.

2786
02:47:41,680 --> 02:47:42,960
Can you go to Ask Reddit?

2787
02:47:42,960 --> 02:47:43,600
Dear Reddit.

2788
02:47:45,200 --> 02:47:45,760
All right.

2789
02:47:45,760 --> 02:47:54,160
1-877-GAMO-L-R or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

2790
02:47:54,160 --> 02:47:57,280
And Jason is in chat saying, there's nothing wrong with braiding.

2791
02:47:57,280 --> 02:47:59,200
It's less permanent than shaving.

2792
02:47:59,200 --> 02:47:59,680
There you go.

2793
02:48:00,640 --> 02:48:03,840
I was trying to go to the Twitters to see if we had any tweets.

2794
02:48:03,840 --> 02:48:08,000
SSG100Matt did tweet us, you know, we're going up against the Grammys tonight.

2795
02:48:09,680 --> 02:48:14,160
My God, I really, really cannot stand the Grammys.

2796
02:48:14,160 --> 02:48:18,160
And it's not just the competitive thing about the fact that, oh, they're on the same time as our show.

2797
02:48:18,160 --> 02:48:20,800
I mean, talk about, talk about irrelevant.

2798
02:48:20,800 --> 02:48:21,760
Let's just leave it at that.

2799
02:48:21,760 --> 02:48:24,880
But I'm sure there were some fine performances in some great fashion.

2800
02:48:25,520 --> 02:48:30,640
But anyway, SSG100Matt did tweet us and say, no need to check up on the Grammy winners.

2801
02:48:30,640 --> 02:48:33,520
Betty White won song and album of the year.

2802
02:48:34,800 --> 02:48:36,800
Of course, she always would give her all the awards.

2803
02:48:36,800 --> 02:48:37,600
She wins everything.

2804
02:48:39,680 --> 02:48:44,720
You know, the thing about the Grammys is that I'm sure your favorite song didn't even get nominated.

2805
02:48:44,720 --> 02:48:48,240
I bet your favorite album of the year didn't even get nominated.

2806
02:48:48,320 --> 02:48:51,920
So, I don't know, what do the Grammys even mean?

2807
02:48:51,920 --> 02:48:56,160
I found a picture of a YouTube clip of someone using a straightener on his beard,

2808
02:48:56,160 --> 02:48:58,640
but it was a tiny beard and not a dwarf beard.

2809
02:48:58,640 --> 02:49:00,000
Like a beard like me, huh?

2810
02:49:01,120 --> 02:49:02,720
No, it was a little bit longer than yours.

2811
02:49:02,720 --> 02:49:09,120
It's kind of one of those scraggly, you know, face throws, but not like an epic beard like.

2812
02:49:09,120 --> 02:49:09,840
All right.

2813
02:49:09,840 --> 02:49:10,800
Oh, sorry.

2814
02:49:10,800 --> 02:49:16,960
I was just going to say, I'm going to just give a few more minutes here for there to be a call to come in here.

2815
02:49:18,400 --> 02:49:21,760
But last call, if you want to get in for the night, 1877 Game O-L-R,

2816
02:49:21,760 --> 02:49:24,480
or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2817
02:49:25,520 --> 02:49:29,600
People in chat is talking about Beck won album of the year.

2818
02:49:29,600 --> 02:49:30,160
For real?

2819
02:49:31,200 --> 02:49:33,600
That's actually my favorite.

2820
02:49:33,600 --> 02:49:35,600
They had an album out this year?

2821
02:49:35,600 --> 02:49:36,240
Well, Beck.

2822
02:49:36,240 --> 02:49:36,560
Oh, yeah.

2823
02:49:36,560 --> 02:49:38,320
Beck's still been making music.

2824
02:49:38,320 --> 02:49:39,440
Alan likes him a lot.

2825
02:49:39,440 --> 02:49:42,320
I bet he'll be tickled to hear about that.

2826
02:49:42,320 --> 02:49:44,080
That's kind of interesting to hear that.

2827
02:49:44,080 --> 02:49:48,880
But I thought they were going to give it to that British guy that stole the Tom Petty song.

2828
02:49:48,880 --> 02:49:50,480
I thought that's what they were all saying.

2829
02:49:50,480 --> 02:49:53,040
But anyway, as much as I appreciate Beck,

2830
02:49:53,040 --> 02:49:54,880
that wasn't my favorite of the album of the year last year.

2831
02:49:54,880 --> 02:49:56,080
I didn't even realize one was out.

2832
02:49:56,640 --> 02:50:00,160
Anyway, 13X forever or 13X forever.

2833
02:50:00,160 --> 02:50:02,240
I can never remember which way you prefer it to be pronounced.

2834
02:50:02,240 --> 02:50:03,440
I think it's 13X forever.

2835
02:50:05,360 --> 02:50:06,800
Sends us a tweet saying,

2836
02:50:06,800 --> 02:50:10,160
so I just finished Chrono Trigger for the first time.

2837
02:50:10,160 --> 02:50:11,600
Closing time, huh?

2838
02:50:11,680 --> 02:50:13,840
From now on, it will never be the same.

2839
02:50:13,840 --> 02:50:18,000
In reference to the song we depart you with every week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2840
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:22,160
Well, I'm glad you got to kind of hear that song in the game.

2841
02:50:22,160 --> 02:50:23,920
And maybe it was a little surprise for you.

2842
02:50:23,920 --> 02:50:25,920
The actual name of it is Too Far Away Times.

2843
02:50:26,640 --> 02:50:27,280
Oh, thank you.

2844
02:50:29,600 --> 02:50:32,320
Also, I wanted to just give a shout out because I saw a few tweets on this.

2845
02:50:32,320 --> 02:50:35,120
Thank you to those of you that nominated us in the podcast awards.

2846
02:50:35,680 --> 02:50:37,920
If you forgot to do that, it's too late, unfortunately.

2847
02:50:37,920 --> 02:50:39,760
They closed on February 6th.

2848
02:50:39,760 --> 02:50:42,240
And I'm somewhere on the fence with all that stuff.

2849
02:50:42,240 --> 02:50:44,880
Although certainly the promotion is really great.

2850
02:50:44,880 --> 02:50:49,520
And I'm always very thankful if we can get nominated to get that additional exposure.

2851
02:50:49,520 --> 02:50:56,400
Because as an indie podcast, it's very hard for us sometimes to get that exposure.

2852
02:50:56,400 --> 02:51:00,640
Especially if we focus everything we do on the podcast.

2853
02:51:00,640 --> 02:51:02,240
So we don't have a YouTube.

2854
02:51:02,240 --> 02:51:03,600
We don't have a Twitch.

2855
02:51:03,600 --> 02:51:04,720
We don't do...

2856
02:51:04,720 --> 02:51:05,600
I mean, we have those.

2857
02:51:05,600 --> 02:51:07,600
We don't really focus on them, you know what I mean?

2858
02:51:08,160 --> 02:51:10,400
We don't make things specific for YouTube.

2859
02:51:10,400 --> 02:51:11,680
Because Jason's probably sitting there going,

2860
02:51:11,680 --> 02:51:13,440
wait a minute, you do have a YouTube.

2861
02:51:13,440 --> 02:51:16,160
But the YouTube is for what we're doing now.

2862
02:51:16,160 --> 02:51:18,160
We don't do a lot of custom created things.

2863
02:51:18,160 --> 02:51:22,400
It's not our focus or what have you.

2864
02:51:22,400 --> 02:51:26,880
So anyway, getting that exposure is great.

2865
02:51:28,800 --> 02:51:30,880
I don't know if we'll get actually nominated or not.

2866
02:51:30,880 --> 02:51:32,560
But then there's that whole side of it where it's like,

2867
02:51:32,560 --> 02:51:34,880
well, it's also a giant popularity contest.

2868
02:51:34,880 --> 02:51:35,600
And I don't know.

2869
02:51:36,560 --> 02:51:40,400
I just hope we can keep it indie and get some additional exposure

2870
02:51:40,400 --> 02:51:42,000
for the hardworking indie people out there.

2871
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:42,400
And you know what?

2872
02:51:42,400 --> 02:51:44,000
I always say it at the end of every show.

2873
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,960
If you didn't like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio,

2874
02:51:46,960 --> 02:51:50,400
then at least tell a friend or two about the show and help us spread the word.

2875
02:51:50,400 --> 02:51:53,280
Because it is the show where every gamer has a voice.

2876
02:51:53,280 --> 02:51:57,120
But there's lots of voices out there that aren't participating with the program.

2877
02:51:58,160 --> 02:51:58,660
All right.

2878
02:51:59,520 --> 02:52:01,040
And good, Jason in chat saying,

2879
02:52:01,040 --> 02:52:04,000
the YouTube videos are not a unique product.

2880
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:05,520
It's another medium for the show.

2881
02:52:06,480 --> 02:52:09,600
It's another way to deliver the bread and butter of what it is that we do.

2882
02:52:10,800 --> 02:52:12,400
And he says, I know exactly what you meant.

2883
02:52:12,400 --> 02:52:12,900
Thank you.

2884
02:52:13,920 --> 02:52:14,420
All right.

2885
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:17,760
Anyhow, the phone's not ringing.

2886
02:52:17,760 --> 02:52:19,840
So I guess no more voices.

2887
02:52:19,840 --> 02:52:21,920
I want to continue tonight.

2888
02:52:21,920 --> 02:52:24,320
I guess everybody's too distracted with them silly Grammys.

2889
02:52:24,960 --> 02:52:28,240
But if you do have other thoughts after the show, you can always email us.

2890
02:52:28,240 --> 02:52:30,880
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

2891
02:52:30,880 --> 02:52:35,280
And you can also hit us up on social media and our forums over at vognetwork.com.

2892
02:52:35,280 --> 02:52:39,920
Where we will continue some of the discussions from tonight's show throughout the week.

2893
02:52:39,920 --> 02:52:42,720
And give you a preview of some stories to come next week.

2894
02:52:43,360 --> 02:52:46,400
Anyway, we have reached the end of another episode of the show.

2895
02:52:46,400 --> 02:52:49,600
Thank you guys very much for listening and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

2896
02:52:49,600 --> 02:52:51,120
Since I already gave you that whole spiel,

2897
02:52:51,120 --> 02:52:53,840
we'll go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

2898
02:52:53,840 --> 02:52:55,520
I will start with my final thought for the night.

2899
02:52:55,520 --> 02:52:57,440
My final thought for the night is,

2900
02:52:57,440 --> 02:53:00,160
I'm going to try and play at least one new game this week.

2901
02:53:00,160 --> 02:53:03,040
So I have something new to talk about during my gaming week next week.

2902
02:53:03,040 --> 02:53:08,320
As much as I love Diablo 3, and season 2 starts Friday, and I can't wait,

2903
02:53:08,320 --> 02:53:11,440
I'm going to really try to do something new for you guys.

2904
02:53:12,240 --> 02:53:13,680
Dark Sakura, your final thought tonight?

2905
02:53:14,400 --> 02:53:16,160
I like big butts and I cannot lie.

2906
02:53:17,280 --> 02:53:18,560
You other brothers can't deny?

2907
02:53:19,600 --> 02:53:21,200
They could deny it. They'd be wrong.

2908
02:53:22,560 --> 02:53:25,760
And last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight?

2909
02:53:26,400 --> 02:53:29,040
Um, I'm working on my game some more.

2910
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:31,760
Hopefully I will have something...

2911
02:53:31,760 --> 02:53:34,080
I want to get more than one level done for this week.

2912
02:53:34,720 --> 02:53:35,840
And I want to get...

2913
02:53:35,840 --> 02:53:37,840
I want to be rated five strips of bacon.

2914
02:53:38,880 --> 02:53:41,040
Sorry, it only goes up to three, possibly four.

2915
02:53:41,040 --> 02:53:41,280
What?

2916
02:53:42,960 --> 02:53:44,720
Are you sure it's not like a thing you unlock,

2917
02:53:44,720 --> 02:53:47,040
where like five is the super secret level?

2918
02:53:47,040 --> 02:53:49,520
Four would be super secret, actually, maybe.

2919
02:53:51,200 --> 02:53:53,440
Already blown away the secrets of your game and it's not even...

2920
02:53:53,440 --> 02:53:54,480
I haven't decided yet.

2921
02:53:54,480 --> 02:53:56,720
It's just a thought right now.

2922
02:53:56,720 --> 02:53:57,600
All right.

2923
02:53:57,600 --> 02:53:58,720
All right, that's going to do it.

2924
02:53:58,960 --> 02:53:59,840
Wait, wait, wait.

2925
02:53:59,840 --> 02:54:01,520
I did not make a reference to Anaconda.

2926
02:54:02,320 --> 02:54:04,400
I made a reference to Sir Mix-A-Lot.

2927
02:54:04,400 --> 02:54:04,880
Get it right.

2928
02:54:05,520 --> 02:54:06,560
All right, fair enough.

2929
02:54:08,160 --> 02:54:09,200
That's going to do it.

2930
02:54:09,200 --> 02:54:10,640
Thank you very much, everybody,

2931
02:54:10,640 --> 02:54:12,400
for listening to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

2932
02:54:12,400 --> 02:54:14,240
We will be back in seven days,

2933
02:54:14,240 --> 02:54:18,800
just after Valentine's Day to do it all over again.

2934
02:54:18,800 --> 02:54:22,240
And, you know, I know there's a lot of people that on Valentine's Day are like,

2935
02:54:22,240 --> 02:54:25,600
you know, well, I'm single and I hate Valentine's Day.

2936
02:54:25,600 --> 02:54:27,920
You know who needs love on Valentine's Day?

2937
02:54:27,920 --> 02:54:29,200
All the people who are massacred

2938
02:54:29,200 --> 02:54:31,280
in the name of getting married when the church banned it?

2939
02:54:31,280 --> 02:54:33,840
No. Kittens and puppies.

2940
02:54:34,480 --> 02:54:34,720
So...

2941
02:54:34,720 --> 02:54:37,040
Go adopt a kitten on Valentine's Day.

2942
02:54:37,040 --> 02:54:39,280
Yes, that would always be a great thought,

2943
02:54:39,280 --> 02:54:43,440
is if you are going to be alone on Valentine's Day,

2944
02:54:43,440 --> 02:54:46,160
I'm sure there's a kitten or a puppy that would really love.

2945
02:54:48,400 --> 02:54:51,120
I will be hugging Midna.

2946
02:54:52,320 --> 02:54:53,840
Have a great week, everybody.

2947
02:54:53,840 --> 02:54:55,120
On that note, we will leave it at that.

2948
02:54:55,120 --> 02:54:55,680
Have a great week.

2949
02:54:55,680 --> 02:54:57,360
We'll see you next time here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2950
02:54:58,880 --> 02:55:01,680
