0	17520	This week, Nintendo rolled out an update adding more 8-player Smash compatible levels, and
17520	20640	for those of you looking to monetize them, there are guidelines for that as well.
20640	23880	We have so much more for you tonight, including a new segment along with your calls, comments,
23880	29920	and emails, all happening right now on the show, where Evergamer has a voice.
29920	35040	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
35040	36680	where Everygamer has a voice.
36680	46640	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this February 1st, 2015, with the 585th episode of our program.
46640	51040	My name is Rob Roberts, here with you over the next three hours or so to talk about video
51040	54180	games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts.
54180	56480	Say hello over there to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
56480	57480	Yo.
57480	58480	Hey, how you doing?
58480	59480	I'm okay.
60040	61040	Better than I was.
61040	62040	Yeah?
62040	63040	I know.
63040	64040	You and I were both talking before the show.
64040	65040	We were both fighting off headaches.
65040	66040	What's up with that?
66040	69560	Yeah, we were punching them in the face, but they were being bitches, and we had to put
69560	70560	some bitches down.
70560	73160	I feel better now, thanks to Captain Ibuprofen.
73160	74160	I feel a little better.
74160	75960	I feel better thanks to coffee and meat.
75960	79440	I feel better thanks to the power of positivity.
79440	80440	The power of song!
80440	81440	All right.
81440	82440	No.
82440	85320	Also, speaking of the power of song, say hello to Tech Master Loki.
85320	86320	Hello.
86320	88280	Hello, how you doing?
88280	89880	I'm very full.
89880	90880	Full, yeah?
90880	92520	That sandwich was a maze.
92520	95320	You got a new place that you've never brought to the show before?
95320	96320	Yes.
96320	97320	And what's that?
97320	99480	Firehouse Subs, I guess, is what this is called.
99480	103900	And I had no idea that that chain existed in California, because the first time I ever
103900	108420	had that Firehouse Subs was at Dragon Con in Atlanta, and Travis Donovan, my pal from
108420	113120	Understation Live, I'm sure you all know him here at VOG, was losing his mind with Jenna,
113120	116560	because I guess they didn't have those where he was from, or I don't know, but he was just
116560	117560	very excited about the Firehouse.
117560	119040	He was like, you gotta try it, you gotta try it.
119040	120040	So I had it.
120040	123960	It was, and I shouldn't say this, because we're not paid to endorse this stuff, but
123960	127640	whatever, it was pretty good, I gotta say.
127640	129640	I still prefer Quiznos, rest in peace.
129640	130880	That's my favorite sub sandwich.
130880	131880	They're not gone.
131880	133880	I've got one that's still right around the corner of my mouth.
133880	134880	I know, you lucky punk.
134880	135880	The only one in the area.
135880	136880	That's the only one in all of Sacramento anymore.
136880	137880	Pretty much, yeah.
137880	141640	I'm like, I don't know how they, it's seriously the worst location for that, but somehow they've
141640	142640	survived.
142640	143640	I know, I know.
143640	146040	All right, so you found some new food to bring to the show, so that's good.
146520	152000	Yes, because I got the same sandwich yesterday, and it was the beef brisket, well, I had the
152000	156040	intent because yesterday it was like, you know, damn, I don't know if I want the meatball
156040	160460	sub or if I want the brisket sandwich, I'm like, I always get the meatball sub whenever
160460	162440	I go someplace just to try it.
162440	167100	I think everybody goes through that phase where you find that food you love so much,
167100	168760	you're eating it for like a week.
168760	173680	I can't eat that for a week, there's no way, it's like so much, like I got their large
173680	177440	sandwiches like a foot long and it's just packed full of meat.
177440	179600	It's just like so much meat on there.
179600	181280	I just can't, I can't eat more.
181280	185280	I want to eat more, but I, I literally will get sick if I eat more.
185280	188400	Jamie, has there ever been a food that you discovered and then you had to eat it for
188400	189880	like an entire week?
189880	190880	Yes.
190880	192920	What was that?
192920	194440	My favorite sick food?
194440	195440	Mm.
195440	196440	Burritos.
196440	197440	Burritos?
197440	198440	Just no specific burritos?
198440	199440	No, seriously.
199440	202600	Well, it was, I used to be addicted to the California burritos that were basically the
202600	206880	carne asada, but I wouldn't get like salsa or anything with it.
206880	213160	It would be meat, potatoes, and cheese, and I ate it for almost a whole week in a row.
213160	214160	Wow.
214160	219000	Well, no, I mixed it up with breakfast burritos too, which was egg, potato, and cheese, but
219000	224280	I had like this sick that would not go away and all I wanted to eat was burritos.
224280	226600	So I ate burritos for a week.
226600	227600	Awesome.
227600	228600	Awesome.
228600	232180	I would say for me it was vanilla Coke was the thing that I had to have like every single
232180	233180	day.
233180	234180	It's like, why am I gaining all this weight?
234180	235180	They have that there.
235180	236180	The Coke free summer shoes.
236180	237180	Oh, I know.
237180	240060	I'm talking about, remember when like it came out, it was probably like 2002, 2003.
240060	241680	It was just kind of eh.
241680	243100	Remember when I had pneumonia?
243100	244180	I do.
244180	247260	And all I ate for like a week and a half was French onion soup.
247260	248260	Literally.
248260	250580	That's all I had was French onion soup.
250580	253420	Because I couldn't eat anything else, like solid food was like no.
253420	254420	I would do that too.
254420	257960	I'd go over to Panera and get French onion soup all the time.
257960	260420	Remember Mimi's Cafe before they got crappy?
260420	261420	I do.
261620	267500	They had, they had the, uh, the five cheese grilled cheese with French onion soup.
267500	268500	That was crack.
268500	269500	All right.
269500	273060	People are going to think we're a podcast about food and it is inevitable.
273060	274060	We always get into food.
274060	275060	We're talking about food the whole show.
275060	277980	Is it called Orange Lounge Radio because you guys talk about oranges?
277980	278980	Well, kind of.
278980	284000	I mean, we never talk about anything that healthy, but yeah, we should do a spinoff
284000	285000	called the Soup Lounge.
285000	287100	We just talk about food.
287100	290880	But we do have you guys who join us live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine
290880	294840	o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com and if you are listening live
294840	300880	over at live.vognetwork.com, you can head into our chat room there and comment along
300880	301880	with the show.
301880	305320	And we oftentimes are looking at the chat room during the show and we pick some comments
305320	306320	to read on there.
306320	308840	We can't read every single line because then you guys would fill out the entire show with
308840	309840	your conversation.
309840	311680	But we do pick out some key comments.
311680	315680	Right now, most folks in chat talking about sandwiches.
315680	317920	I mean, I can't possibly imagine why.
317920	321560	We have SSG100Matt who says Potbelly is the new Quiznos these days.
321560	324280	It's actually pretty good.
324280	325280	Let's see.
325280	327920	Pow says, I felt that way when I discovered ramen for the first time.
327920	329240	I still feel that way about ramen.
329240	331480	I just haven't eaten it because it's so much sodium.
331480	332480	Hold on.
332480	335920	It was my first time living alone, so I obviously ran out of budget in 10 days.
335920	337080	I got my first paycheck.
337080	340080	So ramen the rest of the month, I got so sick of it.
340080	341080	Yeah, I did.
341080	342080	Get this.
342080	347440	When I first moved to California, Dan's pantry was literally ramen and tomato soup.
347960	350120	And I'm like, no.
350120	353520	So okay, last food topic, I promise, and then we'll get into games.
353520	356720	But the video game news is like super depressing this week, what we're going to start off with.
356720	358680	So I'm putting it off intentionally.
358680	363680	So here's my question about ramen, because I think this is super weird and this is something
363680	364680	Alan does.
364680	366320	He's going to kill me for saying it.
366320	371440	But like, he likes to just eat the ramen, like without putting it in the water or anything
371440	372440	like that.
372440	373440	Yeah, what's your problem with that?
373440	374440	Oh, no.
374440	376440	They actually sell ramen snacks like that.
376440	380080	You just season it up and you just kind of shake it a little bit and get it incorporated
380080	381080	in there.
381080	384000	And you have to break it apart first, because if you can't just eat the whole piece.
384000	385320	Yeah, you just don't just put the whole brick in your mouth.
385320	390240	See, I can't eat ramen like that anymore unless I make it myself, because I will actually
390240	395980	break out my, I will do it donburi style.
395980	400280	You're not supposed to eat ramen like it's shredded wheat in a cereal bowl.
400280	401280	No, you don't.
401280	403520	You take the packaging, you put it on the counter, you slam your fist down on it, but
403520	405360	not too hard because you don't want it to explode.
405360	410040	You just want it to like shatter and then you pour it into a bowl and put the seasoning
410040	412080	over it and away you go.
412080	413080	It's awesome.
413080	415320	Especially if you don't want to wait for it to cook.
415320	416320	If it's super salty.
416320	417320	Oh my gosh.
417320	418320	No, thank you.
418320	419880	It's just like, that's too much sodium.
419880	420880	It's like, I have a heart attack just thinking about it.
420880	422600	Exactly why I don't eat ramen anymore.
422600	425200	Guys, you know when chat says just eat a rice cake.
425200	430320	My other favorite thing to do with ramen was when we used to just like make like kind of,
430320	432720	I don't know, a melting pot of all different types of ramen.
432720	433720	Just like, oh, hey, we got some beef.
433720	434720	We got some chicken.
435080	436080	We got some pork.
436080	437080	We got some shrimp or whatever.
437080	438080	Just pour it all together.
438080	439080	Mix it together.
439080	440080	Done.
440080	442240	It's some flavor of ramen.
442240	444440	See the way to do it, you get just the noodles.
444440	446800	Actually, I prefer to do this with udon.
446800	450920	You put a, you slice up a boiled egg, you put in like you actually make your dashi stock
450920	456080	from scratch and it is the best thing on a cold day.
456080	459240	And then lastly, Alan Alchemy since he was the inspiration for this and chat says you
459240	463080	pound it with your fist or just pinch the shit out of it and make bite sized nuggets.
463440	465400	I don't use the spice packet though.
465400	466400	You know what?
466400	469160	That was almost my food of choice while playing Final Fantasy XI.
469160	471320	I'm surprised you don't remember that.
471320	472320	I do.
472320	473320	I actually do remember that.
473320	474320	All right.
474320	475320	Thank you for bringing up a video game.
475320	477320	We should take the topic to video games.
477320	478520	But I'm going to be honest, guys.
478520	481040	This is, this has kind of been a shitty week in video games.
481040	486160	There's been a lot of real bad news and we'll get to some of it as we go on throughout the
486160	487800	show and bring up the different topics.
487800	493040	But I think there's one y'all are thinking about, y'all have been talking about on Twitter
494000	495000	Let's talk about it now.
495000	497200	Let's talk about it here for our kickoff topic here.
497200	500720	Jamie, some big, some big news in the blogging world, right?
500720	502400	Some crap is what it is.
502400	503400	Yeah.
503400	506840	So AOL is a bunch of shits.
506840	507840	And that's the news.
507840	508840	That's the news.
508840	509840	Okay.
509840	510840	Well, it's business.
510840	515160	You know, I can't say that the whole company is a bunch of shits, but it's a shitty decision.
515160	524400	So Joystiq has basically been dissolved by AOL along with Wow Insider and Massively.
524400	530600	There are layoffs of their staff with Joystiq 13 staffers laid off.
530600	534760	The Massively folks are going to be out of work by February 3rd.
534760	539000	And Wow Insider has also lost their staff.
539040	545800	So basically three whole sections of video game joy on the internet, some of the last
545800	550200	bastions of decent news are gone.
550200	557120	So as of February 3rd, which might as well be today.
557120	559480	Which I would say this.
559480	563520	If you want to petition about something, fucking petition about that.
564520	569000	If you show them that they're going to be losing a potential source of a big source
569000	574240	of revenue, this is...
574240	575800	Here's my concern.
575800	580760	And I absolutely say this with no disrespect to these companies or the people that work
580760	586840	there because as much as I razz the big corporate blogs sometimes, and obviously AOL is going
586840	589000	to be corporate when you're owned by AOL.
589000	593400	I'm very much, and I've always been about support indie podcasting, support indie blogging
593400	596760	and this stuff that's homegrown.
596760	602720	I always, I did have a place for Joystiq and the AOL blogs in my heart.
602720	606680	And part of that was because I felt like they were one of the rare blogs.
606680	610080	And when I say they, I mean Joystiq, Wow Insider, Massively, all of them.
610080	614440	They were one of the rare blogs that really kind of treated a lot of what they saw in
614440	615880	the indie scene.
615960	619920	Not just indie development games, but indie development publishing and podcasting and
619920	622560	everything as something that's like, they're equal.
622560	627920	I never felt like poo-pooed by anybody that had worked at Joystiq or any of these other
627920	628920	organizations.
628920	635560	I felt there was like, there's a common respect and a common decency and sense of, I guess,
635560	639800	decency there that I'm going to be honest, keeping it real, I haven't felt from other
639800	640800	places.
640800	641800	I'm not going to name names.
641800	642880	I'm not going to focus on negatives.
642880	647080	But all that stuff aside, I just kind of feel like there was a lot of real decent stuff
647080	648800	happening at Joystiq.
648800	651080	And it kind of blows my mind.
651080	657320	Obviously one of the big hot button issues in last year's was ethics and games journalism.
657320	661360	I'm not going to go too far down that slippery slope.
661360	665760	But what concerns me here is that I see people celebrating the loss of these blogs.
665760	669940	And I don't think there's anything to celebrate when these were some of the most ethical people
669940	672280	that were still around in what they were doing.
672280	676680	They don't run headlines that were clickbait like we see a lot of other sites do.
676680	680300	I mean, you guys know what game blogs out there do this consistently and you see it
680300	681740	shared on Facebook.
681740	687160	It's like, you know, check out these 12 hot cosplays from such and such that are very
687160	690680	only like tangentially related to video games.
690680	693320	I wish you guys could hear how hard I'm rolling my eyes.
693320	696400	Whereas Joystiq wasn't really about that.
696400	699760	And I always kind of, you know, I really, really respected them for that.
699760	703720	So I feel the pain of their loss.
703720	708020	Now to go to the part that I wanted to follow up to what Jamie was saying with, you know,
708020	710500	a big source of revenue and so forth.
710500	714680	Here's the hard question is, was it a big source of revenue?
714680	720840	Because I'm not as much as I liked reading it and I like supporting them and so forth.
720840	724840	Is there a lot of money to be made in that arena anymore?
724840	730200	And I'm not so sure there is, especially when tons and tons of people are using ad block
730200	732320	these days.
732320	736040	Where was Joystiq making money?
736040	740880	Or a lot of these corporate blogs, for crying out loud.
740880	748080	And I think a lot of these things that tailor headlines that foster the Facebook shares
748080	752620	and these clickbait articles and things like that, they get enough advertising revenue
752620	755860	from the people maybe that don't use ad block or whatever.
755860	760700	But unfortunately, these people who run their ships a little more ethically, like Joystiq
760700	767180	did, unfortunately, I think probably did end up costing money to run.
767180	768180	And it sucks.
768180	773280	Like, I mean, it's not an easy thing to say, but I think that's just the reality, you guys.
773280	774980	How was Joystiq making money?
774980	779580	I'm not so sure that, you know, you weren't paying to access it.
779580	782060	I bet a ton of you have ad blocker running.
782060	783620	Did you whitelist Joystiq?
783620	784620	Yeah.
784620	785700	I did too.
785700	786700	I did too.
786700	788380	But I bet there's a lot of people out there that didn't.
788380	791360	You know, and I'm not trying to make you feel bad, but I think that's also just the reality
791360	792360	of where we are.
792360	796020	And I think that's a lot, I mean, a lot of people just, you know, a lot of websites you
796020	801180	may block ads on, but I say, yeah, maybe that's me, unfortunately, because they didn't go
801180	805700	that route of trying to be clickbaity with your headlines that they didn't get a lot
805700	809100	of those shares or something on social media.
809100	812020	Maybe that was the case.
812060	814460	Let's see, go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
814460	817820	SHA100Matt says, yep, if people clicked on more ads, maybe they would have a case in
817820	821460	terms of revenue, but Joystiq doesn't really sell anything.
821460	825660	Let's see, RageNator says, the one big site that I really read was 1UP.com, but they bit
825660	827160	the dust.
827160	829980	Let's see, Dungeon Buster says, I drifted away from Joystiq years ago, but not because
829980	834900	of any ethics or issue with their reportage, just so many other sites arrive later to satisfy
834900	835900	my news needs.
835900	841900	Well, you know, and to be fair, there's a lot of, and I'm not accusing Joystiq of this,
841900	845960	I'm saying there is a lot of out there in the games journalism world, there's a lot
845960	850420	of copy paste journalism that goes on out there, you know, and I think there are a lot
850420	854900	of places for people to get news and thanks to things like Twitter and Facebook that keep
854900	860460	us a little more tapped in, I think people get their news maybe a little more directly
860460	864000	on social feeds where you don't necessarily even have to click over to a site like Joystiq
864000	865000	to see it.
865000	869720	And I think all those little things kind of hurt them, you know, collectively.
869720	874720	And again, I so apologize if any, I don't think any of those staffers happen to listen
874720	878240	to this show, but if you do, trust me, my heart goes out to you guys and I'm so sorry
878240	879880	if it sounds like I'm being a jerk right now.
879880	883480	And on top of that, the fact that they had the, they ran a story about, you know, their
883480	886760	site closing, they didn't even have an answer from, you know.
886760	887760	Yeah.
887760	891280	And there's that shady shit too, where it's like, you know, maybe they were making tons
891280	892280	of money.
892280	895080	Yeah, that's pretty nice to hear that your job's gone from somebody else other than,
895080	896080	you know, your boss.
896080	897680	That part's pretty shit.
897680	904240	I mean, here's, okay, here's the silver lining at the end, and maybe there will be another
904240	909620	website that will pick up a lot of these writers, but I just really hope there's no pressure
909620	913200	to make these writers make more clickbaity headlines.
913200	917440	I really hope that isn't what it turns into because that, I don't think that's what anybody
917440	922480	wants to see happen here out of this is, you know, it's gotta be more TMZ style stuff in
922480	923480	order to get clicks.
923480	926760	I really hope that doesn't happen, but here's an interesting comment in our chat room again
926760	929800	over at live.vognetwork.com.
929800	934840	Apricot Sushi says, I think the fact we're seeing a lot of people turn to Patreon while
934840	938200	big sites are getting cuts and going under says a lot.
938200	943440	Well, I think it's inevitable, and I'm almost positive, and I could be end up proving wrong,
943440	948040	being proved wrong, but I'm almost positive at least the WoW Insider branch, you're gonna
948040	953320	see either a Patreon or a Kickstarter coming from those guys next week because in their
953320	959680	goodbye note, they were like, you should follow us on Twitter, and on February 3rd,
959680	963480	you never know what the future might hold, wink, wink, nudge, nudge, like just put it
963480	968040	on a neon sign already, and believe me, I'm not blaming those guys for doing it.
968040	975840	If you're gonna do this Patreon or a Kickstarter route, strike while the iron is hot, you know,
975840	980480	people are gonna miss these sites when they're gone, and they're realizing that right now,
980480	983360	so would people be willing to pay for these sites?
983360	985400	I bet they would right now.
985400	989800	The longer you go on, I think the harder it's gonna be to justify, but especially something
989800	996000	like World of Warcraft that has a very tight-knit community, Blizzard has a lot of very rabid
996000	1000840	fans that will support games that when Blizzard makes it, they'll play it, but if another
1000840	1006560	company makes it, they won't play it, consider what I'm talking about there with games like
1006560	1009320	Heroes of the Storm and Overwatch, right?
1009320	1015680	So there's a very loyal base there that I think will bolster up and support WoW Insider
1015680	1018000	specifically, because that's kind of the one.
1018000	1022320	Joystiq hasn't really hinted if they're planning anything like that massively, I have no idea
1022320	1026340	what they're planning either, but it seems like especially with the WoW Insider branch,
1026340	1029400	that's almost a given that that's what's gonna happen next week, is that there's gonna be
1029400	1034720	a Patreon or a Kickstarter to keep them going, so hopefully they will get the money to keep
1034720	1037880	their thing going, but how long?
1037880	1039320	A year?
1039320	1040320	Three years?
1040320	1041320	Who knows?
1041320	1042320	So.
1042320	1050840	Anyway, I'm sad to hear about this loss again, you know, Joystiq was a blog that I would
1050840	1055740	visit on a regular basis, I thought they were great, and you know, even some of the few
1055740	1060080	things that we've done on this show that went viral, quote-unquote, like the whole, you
1060080	1063480	know, you guys remember years and years ago, there was a whole president cat thing, and
1063480	1067720	we had a good time here on OLR, we were joking around about a Japanese game, Sukiban, so
1067720	1072480	I ran a Wii, that was about a cat that was all these little different mini games, and
1072480	1075960	Jamie said, oh, I think it translates kind of loosely to President Cat, and I'm like,
1075960	1079160	that's an awesome name for a game, let's have President Cat on the Wii, and why don't we
1079160	1083400	get games like this out here, and we started tweeting them, and the company noticed, right?
1083400	1087400	Well, Joystiq actually was like the first major blog to run a story on that, and I always
1087400	1090800	thought that was like really cool, I was like, wow, they're like tapped into indie sources
1090800	1091800	like that, you know?
1091800	1093640	Or even before that Katamari.
1093640	1098400	Yeah, and then, so it wasn't just the good news, but the not so good news, right?
1098400	1102800	Like the time that we posted some information that Namco didn't like that we posted, and
1102800	1107840	that went viral too, but again, I mean, despite the fact that that one was a little more painful
1107840	1113160	for us, it was still that they were tuned into what was going on in the indie world
1113160	1119360	as well as the PR, the things that they were getting handed from PR, which I wouldn't be
1119360	1122560	surprised if some of the Joystiq people end up in those positions where they're, you know,
1122560	1129000	doing PR and other types of, you know, on the other side of it for companies, big companies.
1129000	1136720	So, let's see, going again for some more comments from our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
1136720	1142800	Let's see, Dungeon Buster says, specialist sites have also added to the competition.
1142800	1148040	If I want pure industry news, I can go to places like Develop or Game Biz.
1148040	1151080	Tao says, I stopped going to any gaming site.
1151080	1153400	I just can't take the comments.
1153400	1156400	They make me lose faith on the human race.
1156400	1161640	Well, unfortunately, we don't have a lot, a lot, a lot of articles at vognetwork.com.
1161640	1166080	I mean, we just, we can't, right now, we're not at a stage where we can afford to pay
1166080	1170780	people to do articles, but if people want practice or resume type stuff, we're always
1170780	1174840	looking for people to write stuff, and so we do have some people that write some things
1174840	1175840	very limited.
1175840	1180540	If we do ever turn a profit, I'd be happy to pay writers.
1180540	1182240	We get some of that coming on vognetwork.com.
1182240	1188680	We moderate comments, all of them, so, you know, and obviously our site is family enough
1188680	1193420	where that's not really a problem for us yet, but you never know what's going to go viral.
1193420	1197080	You just never know what's going to go viral, and then once it goes viral, then everybody's
1197080	1199920	got something to say, so.
1199920	1201760	You know what the rule, the stem of the problem is?
1201760	1202760	What's that?
1202920	1206920	Too many of those free month subscriptions at AOL.
1206920	1209840	It just hurt them so much that it just can't recover.
1209840	1214040	Those fortresses built out of the free discs, the free sample discs.
1214040	1215040	Just did them in.
1215040	1216040	Oh boy, alright.
1216040	1222920	Anyhow, so, having a drink, throwing one back for our friends over at AOL, Joystiq, WoW
1222920	1224960	Insider, and Massively.
1224960	1230360	May y'all, and I should say, because it's not picked up in any of the game blogs, but
1230360	1234600	there's another AOL blog that I read quite frequently, the unofficial Apple web blog,
1234600	1238360	TUAW, that was also impacted by this, and they're getting shuttered.
1238360	1244440	So pouring out a 40 to all those fine blogs over at AOL, and may y'all land on your feet
1244440	1246240	real soon.
1246240	1250920	At least y'all have the respect of a lot of people in the industry, and so I think with
1250920	1254880	that on your resume and considering the situations, I think y'all are going to bounce back real
1254880	1255880	quick.
1255880	1256880	I really hope so.
1256880	1257880	I really hope so.
1257880	1259480	And hey, you won't be working for AOL anymore.
1259480	1261600	Thumbs up.
1261600	1263160	Try to look for the silver lining.
1263160	1267800	Alright, let's get into some of the regular segments we do here at Orange Launch Radio,
1267800	1272040	and then we'll get into some other news going on this week, but yeah, not a lot of great
1272040	1273040	news this week, guys.
1273040	1274040	I don't know.
1274040	1275040	I don't know.
1275040	1278060	Anyway, let's try to cheer things up a little bit with the games themselves.
1278060	1281160	You know, sometimes we play video games to put us in a better mood, and talk about the
1281160	1285280	games that we've been playing this week with How Was Your Gaming Week?
1285280	1288120	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1288120	1289520	I really didn't play too much.
1289520	1294840	I did some Dragon Age, but other than that, no, I did play some Final Fantasy XIV for
1294840	1301200	a little bit on Monday, but really, I haven't really done much else in terms of gaming just
1301200	1307100	because it's been a really stupidly, stupidly busy week.
1307100	1315360	That and I did buy somebody in this little group of ours a game that I am going to request
1315360	1321560	that he play as soon as he gets a chance to.
1321560	1325840	I will not say what it is until said person is ready to announce it.
1325840	1330600	Well, doesn't he have to finish the previous one?
1330600	1331940	No.
1331940	1337480	He needs to go right into the second one, because, okay, I'll just fuckin' say it.
1337480	1340960	I bought Rob Five Nights at Freddy's 2, and he's gotta play it.
1340960	1344280	I don't care if he's finished the first one, he has to play it, because the third one's
1344280	1345280	coming out.
1345280	1347400	Yeah, I did see that in my Steam library.
1347400	1351200	I have to do the VoG Jam stream first, which is still something, or the YouTubes.
1351200	1355200	I'm not gonna end up doing a live stream anymore, because all the games run in different resolutions
1355200	1359020	and things, so I'm gonna just make a variety of YouTubes, but until I finish that project,
1359020	1360880	no live streams.
1360880	1362600	But that will be on the list.
1362600	1366700	Hopefully, I can get Shane to come over, or maybe you to come over, and you guys can taunt
1366700	1368720	me a little bit while I play.
1368720	1371700	I'm sure it'll be a hoot and a holler.
1371740	1375660	Just in time for Five Nights at Freddy's 3, which I'm sure is coming out very soon.
1375660	1378460	I really wish that would become a movie series.
1378460	1379460	It might.
1379460	1380460	I think it could.
1380460	1386580	I think it probably should, honestly, because it's such a simple premise, and, you know,
1386580	1392260	I mean, hell, they're remaking, like, really shitty movies now, so why not just do one
1392260	1393260	of those?
1393260	1396460	It's starting to become a Minecraft-level phenomenon.
1396460	1401380	I mean, maybe not that big, because it's gonna be harder to market it towards kids.
1401380	1404140	I think it's a...
1404140	1409620	You can't just compare A to B, but it is definitely, like, a phenomenon in the style of Minecraft.
1409620	1413700	I think there's so much, like, lore and all this other stuff that people are...
1413700	1414700	That's the part I like about it.
1414700	1421340	I can't play the games for shit, but I watch the videos and read the crap about it.
1421340	1425240	And that, going back and reading, like, the actual case that they theorized it was based
1425240	1428800	off of, it was...
1428800	1429800	That creeped me out.
1430440	1433760	The fact that the original thing happened, with that, what was it, a Chuck E. Cheese
1433760	1434760	or something?
1434760	1435760	Yeah.
1435760	1436760	Yeah.
1436760	1437760	A showbiz pizza, I think.
1437760	1438760	Yeah, it was a showbiz.
1438760	1439760	What it was back in the day.
1439760	1440760	It's saying Pizza Time Theater.
1440760	1441760	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1441760	1443400	All right, so, if that's it for your gaming week...
1443400	1444400	Thank you, Nolan Bushnell.
1444400	1447000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1447000	1448280	I didn't play a whole ton.
1448280	1452440	I was actually working on my game most of the week, and I've gotten...
1452440	1455760	I'm trying to get to the point where I can just, like, play a level, and then once I
1455760	1460640	get that, I can actually just start building levels for it.
1460640	1466120	So I have the starting sequence part done for each level, and then I was just working
1466120	1468640	on the finishing thing.
1468640	1476240	The problem is my logo that I did in 3D for, like, the end part when you finish a race.
1476240	1478120	It didn't look very good.
1478120	1482660	Just shot straight on, because it's black and white, so it looked 2D almost.
1482660	1486700	So I needed it kind of spinning towards the camera to make it look cooler.
1486700	1493980	So I'm working on that, and then my cat decides to start programming last night, and so she
1493980	1500540	sat down on my laptop and did a fighter plays on all of my scripts in my game, and so I
1500540	1501540	had to fix that.
1501540	1505940	Thankfully, that was pretty quick to fix, and, you know, she's so jealous.
1505940	1506940	I swear to God.
1506940	1510260	It's like, you're not paying attention to me all the time.
1510260	1512260	What the hell?
1512260	1514300	So I did that, and then actual game playing.
1514300	1517700	I played more of LEGO Marvel Super Hero just because my son's playing it.
1517700	1521920	I'm already finished with the game, so there's not really much more I need to do with it,
1521920	1526460	other than I just messing around with some of the glitches in the game and stuff.
1526460	1528020	So that was fun.
1528020	1529220	And what else?
1529220	1531380	Oh, watch some more awesome games done quick.
1531380	1540020	Like I watched the run for I Wanna Be the Boshi and New Super Mario Bros. and, oh,
1540020	1542540	New Super Mario Bros Wii.
1542540	1544620	What else?
1544620	1549500	Part of the Portal 2 run, but I fell asleep, so, oh well.
1549500	1551500	But I'm really digging that stuff.
1551500	1556660	I do want to play some more Gata the Hell, but I just haven't gotten around to it.
1556660	1561140	And I don't know, I've been looking at my PlayStation Network library and I'm like,
1561140	1564860	crap, man, I've got a lot of stuff that I haven't touched on there yet.
1564860	1568060	Like I bought Battlefield 4 a while ago, I'm like, shit, I haven't even played that.
1568060	1572420	And then my stack of games I bought when I got the system, I'm like, shit, I still haven't
1572420	1576220	even played Watch Dogs or Destiny yet, and it's just sitting in the case, just collecting
1576220	1577220	dust.
1577220	1579580	So I've got a lot of stuff to play.
1579580	1580580	After I finish my game.
1580580	1581580	Alright.
1581580	1582580	And then my other game.
1582580	1584540	Good priorities, good priorities.
1584540	1585540	My gaming week.
1585540	1590340	Actually, I've had a pretty active gaming week, although not a lot of new stuff to note,
1590340	1594180	since not a lot of new stuff has been coming out, but I was continuing to play Fantasy
1594180	1595860	Life earlier this week.
1595860	1596860	And I've been having fun with that.
1596860	1601060	I started to get into some of the crafting a little bit since I was doing a wizard for
1601060	1602060	my life in the beginning.
1602060	1606220	I was like, oh, let me try going into, I think they call it tailor cloth crafting, whatever.
1606220	1609700	I think it's a tailor to see if I can maybe make myself some armor.
1609700	1611860	So you know, it's kind of playing a little bit of that story.
1611860	1615980	And now I'm like, oh, maybe I should get into gathering and I can totally see where this
1615980	1620300	is like a gamer add like me guys worst nightmare because it's like, oh, I want to play a little
1620300	1621300	bit of this.
1621300	1623540	Oh, but then I want to play a little bit of this because I always see these little mind
1623540	1624540	things everywhere.
1624540	1625540	I want to mind those.
1625540	1626540	Oh, and I want to fish and I've got to do this.
1626540	1629300	And I'm never going to get anywhere in that game because I'm going to keep getting distracted
1629300	1631780	by all these different things there is to do.
1631780	1635140	Dude, level five is really good at making grind fests.
1635140	1639020	They are very, very good at making grind fests and, but Fantasy Life is good.
1639020	1641660	I talked about that last week and I'm having fun with that game.
1641660	1643020	Let's see.
1643020	1645220	So was playing a little bit of that.
1645220	1650460	A lot of Diablo three on PC with the season is ending on Tuesday.
1650460	1653820	So Alan has actually been very helpful.
1653820	1655500	He's been playing a lot more than me.
1655500	1660420	He's going to hit Paragon 300 tonight on his seasonal character, 300 Paragon levels.
1660420	1662520	He was at like two 96 or something before the show.
1662520	1663980	So he'll definitely hit that tonight.
1663980	1667100	I'm at maybe one 50.
1667100	1672780	I mean, I've been playing a lot, but not like a lot, but I've been having fun and Alan helped
1672780	1673780	me get some achievements.
1673780	1679020	We finally, uh, we killed, uh, this guy on torment six, you have to get to get an achievement.
1679020	1682480	It's like this complicated thing where you have to build all these keys, these, some
1682480	1683480	of the boss.
1683480	1684480	And we did that.
1684480	1688260	We got to greater lift rift level 30, which I didn't think I'd be able to see on my wizard,
1688260	1691220	but by golly, we did it and got a new place on the scoreboard.
1691220	1692460	So that was all really exciting.
1692460	1694360	So that was seasonal on a PC.
1694360	1697900	I haven't been playing as much on PlayStation four, but a friend of mine picked it up on
1697900	1700000	PS four and I know I have other friends that play on there.
1700000	1703660	So probably what I'll do in the downtime between seasons on PC, I'm probably going
1703660	1707900	to try to pick up PS four because it is still one of my goals this year to get my platinum
1707900	1709180	trophy in Diablo.
1709180	1710180	Dang it.
1710180	1712340	So that's something I will certainly work on.
1712340	1714780	So, uh, yeah, I played a little bit of that as well.
1714780	1718100	Um, so yeah, kind of a, a lot of the same stuff.
1718100	1720940	I'm like some final fantasy 14 here and there a little bit.
1720940	1726460	I did some geometry wars three earlier today, um, but not a lot, a lot of new stuff to note.
1726460	1732460	Um, one other thing I will mention, uh, princess Irene, who was on the show a few weeks ago,
1732900	1735140	she does her other show, uh, the multi-tap podcast.
1735140	1736940	She was here promoting that.
1736940	1741320	Uh, she called me up the other day and was like, let's go play DDR.
1741320	1743700	And I was like, Oh my gosh, it's been forever.
1743700	1744700	Why not?
1744700	1746260	Let's go play DDR like old school times.
1746260	1749340	So we actually went out to Roseville golf land, which, which really is where this show
1749340	1750740	was born.
1750740	1757780	Despite the sad commentary, you mean spawned from the pits, uh, despite where, uh, you
1757780	1761820	know, despite the state of arcades today and the fact that it's like, it's all like ticket
1761820	1765520	grabbing machines now, I did see some pretty cool arcade cabinets.
1765520	1767600	So they had a Mario Kart deluxe.
1767600	1771180	I did not know there was now a Mario Kart deluxe cabinet and it looked fancy.
1771180	1775340	I didn't get a chance to play it cause there was just kids nonstop going through that game,
1775340	1776340	but it looked really fun.
1776340	1777340	Uh, sad though.
1777340	1780380	It was like the Mario Kart tracks on the arcade games are so like blah.
1780380	1783980	It's just like, yeah, it's like, Ooh, well it's a loop.
1783980	1784980	They were in the early games.
1784980	1785980	I don't know about deluxe though.
1785980	1786980	I haven't played deluxe yet.
1786980	1789580	So at least for the first couple.
1789580	1793460	Um, so, but I saw, I was like, wow, those are some fancy looking cabs.
1793460	1796180	Uh, so we played a little bit of DDR, so that was fun.
1796180	1801780	Uh, we were playing some max two for you, uh, old school DDR fans, but man, when you
1801780	1804820	don't play DDR for a long time, you really lose stamina.
1804820	1805820	Okay.
1805820	1809740	So like Irene and I were like, all right, we'll do some, we'll do some standard and
1809740	1812620	some basic songs, red foot and yellow foot songs.
1812620	1814300	We were, we were doing okay on that.
1814300	1818980	So then for the last song I was like, okay, we got to try and do something on maniac.
1818980	1820420	Let's do something on maniac.
1820420	1822660	So I put it on the hardest difficulty green feet.
1822660	1823660	Right.
1823660	1825460	And I was like, let's do blow my whistle, baby.
1825460	1826460	Everybody.
1826460	1827460	Everybody remembers that song, right?
1827460	1835060	If you've ever walked by a DDR max two machine, you've heard that you've heard this song before,
1835060	1836060	right?
1836060	1837660	It's really annoying and awesome to play.
1837660	1841540	Uh, but it's only like a seven foot song, so it won't be that hard, right?
1841540	1842900	Oh my God.
1842900	1847380	Because the seven footer is usually like nonstop running and jumping and all that stuff.
1847380	1855240	Like at the end of it, I was, I was like having a full on as I, I, I, I remember even
1855240	1861680	just trying like basic stuff in the last time I played, I need to get my stamina back out
1861680	1862680	of shape.
1862680	1864980	Oh, I need to get my stamina back.
1864980	1870260	Uh, and uh, then for the very, very, very last song, you know, Irene and I said, okay,
1870260	1871820	this is the last song we're going to do all day.
1871820	1872820	This is fine.
1872820	1874500	So I was like, all right, fuck it.
1874500	1876960	Let's do, let's do another maniac song.
1876960	1887960	She put it on a Ryan seven, eight, which is the, like, I'd cue up the MP3.
1887960	1891880	I love it when you sing DDR songs, Loki, but that's honestly what it sounds like.
1891880	1893840	But the, I will never, okay.
1893840	1898880	So the, the, the pattern that you dance to in the song, do, do, do, do, do, do, do,
1898880	1901320	do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
1901320	1905560	That's how fast your feet are moving and that do jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump,
1905560	1908680	jump, jump, jump, jump, like that's how fast your feet are moving.
1908680	1909680	Right?
1909680	1915400	So I did that one on nine footer and I'm very proud because my 36 year old ass got a 300
1915400	1920600	combo and I damn near full combo the whole song I fucked up in the last six measures
1920600	1921600	though.
1921600	1925080	Like there's just too much going on at the end, but I, I was so close to a full combo
1925080	1927460	and I was like, this old guy still got it.
1927460	1930060	So that felt pretty good to be able to do that.
1930060	1933540	It has kind of motivated me a little bit to try and get my stamina back a little bit.
1933540	1937020	So I need to like do one of those like couch to 5k type things or something.
1937020	1938340	Just something to get me in the habit of moving.
1938340	1939340	Couch to nine feet.
1939340	1940500	What do they call that?
1940500	1941500	It's a couch to 5k.
1941500	1942500	Is that what?
1942500	1943500	Okay.
1943500	1944500	But it should be, um, we should do a...
1944500	1945500	Oh, couch to nine footer.
1945500	1946500	Couch to nine feet.
1946500	1947500	I get it now.
1947500	1948500	Yeah.
1948500	1949580	Uh, I, I really do want to do something like that.
1949580	1953420	I was never skinnier in my life than the years I played DDR.
1953420	1957060	Of course it helped that I was dating a vegan who really loved to cook.
1957060	1959700	And so like vegans don't eat.
1959700	1964020	I don't even know, like, you know, the newer machines, like they don't even have the same
1964020	1965020	foot levels anywhere.
1965020	1968420	I'm like, I don't understand, you know, what these levels are anymore.
1968420	1969420	Yeah, no, I know.
1969420	1970940	Well, it was a max two machine.
1970940	1974740	I can, I can speak max to max two, maybe extreme.
1974740	1976340	That was back from my day stream.
1976340	1979540	It's like kind of, eh, no.
1979540	1983420	So anyway, and then, uh, Alan alchemy's in chat reminding me of something else we saw,
1983420	1987380	uh, over at Roseau golf land, a fucking candy crush arcade game.
1987380	1990500	They had a fucking flappy bird and a candy crush.
1990500	1994860	Like all these fucking iPhone games are becoming arcade games that shoot out tickets.
1994860	2002580	Why would you play a game that's free, but instead pay money because you get tickets
2002580	2005220	and you can redeem those tickets for crap.
2005220	2010100	I'm surprised the tickets don't get you codes to get something in the game on your iPhone.
2010100	2011100	The camp flappy bird.
2011100	2013300	Oh, just to get good, give it full circle.
2013300	2015060	Why not gives you, what is it?
2015060	2018740	Like little gum drop bombs or whatever the fuck they are in candy crush.
2018740	2023660	You can trade in tickets and get a code for some of those on iTunes or Google play or
2023660	2024660	whatever.
2024660	2025660	Surprise.
2025660	2026700	I wouldn't be surprised off.
2026700	2027700	That was the thing.
2027700	2028700	They bring it full circle.
2028700	2029700	All right.
2029700	2030700	Anyway, that was my gaming week.
2030700	2034900	Very long winded, but, uh, you know, a little trip to the arcades and all that good stuff.
2034900	2040300	Um, before we get into tonight's gaming news, some quick housekeeping, uh, we will be here
2040300	2041740	throughout the coming weeks.
2041740	2044660	No shows off planned yet, except maybe in early March.
2044660	2045900	That's still developing.
2045900	2050580	Uh, however, you can always friend us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
2050580	2056100	You can also friend us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R. And we are going to be debuting
2056100	2057140	a new segment tonight.
2057140	2060940	As Jason mentioned in the intro, I'll tell you more about that at the beginning of part
2060940	2063740	B is where we're going to put it right before we get into rapid fire news.
2063740	2067560	I'll talk to you more about that when we get there and try something new based on some
2067560	2071380	things you guys said last week, believe it or not, this is, this is an interactive show.
2071380	2076340	And just because we've been doing it for coming up on 13 years this June, doesn't mean
2076340	2080700	we can't change things once in a while when the listeners, uh, give good ideas and suggestions
2080700	2081700	and feedback.
2081700	2085520	So we'll talk about that at the beginning of part B. Uh, meanwhile, let's get into some
2085520	2087660	gaming news, lots of other stuff going on in the world.
2087660	2088660	We're going to start off.
2088660	2090900	I have a feeling we're going to get into it.
2090900	2091900	Here we go.
2091900	2094100	Loki started us off with some gaming news.
2094100	2103440	So new to our, uh, Nintendo has graciously allowed people to use their content and collect
2103440	2105940	ad revenue from it on YouTube.
2105940	2107340	That's so awesome.
2107340	2114260	So nice of them, except there's some little asterisks is that you need to be aware of.
2114260	2118860	First off, uh, this would be through their brand new affiliate program, the Nintendo
2118860	2120440	creators program.
2120440	2126920	So when you sign up with them, um, you can basically register whole channels or certain
2126920	2127920	videos.
2127920	2135840	And basically if you do, um, just an individual video, you will be offered 60% of the ad revenue.
2135840	2142880	Um, and if for a whole channel, 70% of the ad revenue and, um, they are basically paying
2142880	2144440	you via PayPal.
2144440	2150320	So they're collecting all the ad revenue and then paying you on the backend for that.
2150320	2155680	And I guess, um, they'll allow you to use their videos and make money off them.
2155680	2158000	I think it's crap.
2158000	2159000	Why do you think it's the reason?
2159000	2162080	I think it's crafts because she makes so little from ad revenues anyways.
2162080	2168240	In fact, a good, good explanation for this was, um, total biscuit actually did a breakdown
2168240	2170240	of this and why this was a bad thing.
2170240	2177440	And basically breaking down that, say you make a hundred dollars on a video for ad revenue.
2177440	2183800	And at the end, after you're done paying, you know, the fees for, um, YouTube, from
2183800	2188920	PayPal, from, um, what Nintendo takes out for every hundred dollars that you're actually
2188920	2193860	making in ad revenue, you're actually only collecting two or $22 of that.
2193860	2195680	And so it's just, it's crap.
2195680	2199520	Honestly, I think this type of thing is not a good thing considering that, you know, you
2199520	2203760	had some companies like Microsoft that were kind of, you know what, we don't want you
2203760	2209160	using our properties for, uh, making, you know, money off of them, basically use, make
2209160	2214120	any sort of monetization, but then they went ahead and reversed their stance on that.
2214120	2217920	And I think that that's kind of the way that the company should be, honestly, cool.
2217920	2220760	If you want to participate in this, go right ahead.
2220760	2225400	But like, if I had the time to make, you know, more videos and stuff that had to do with,
2225400	2228880	you know, game play and stuff like that, I would not be choosing incentive products.
2228880	2234640	There's plenty of, plenty, plenty of other games out there rather than Nintendo games
2234640	2235720	that I could be playing.
2235720	2240200	I've got a whole fucking Steam backlog that, you know, is a testament to that.
2240200	2248020	I don't need to have the privilege of paying them money to show their game online.
2248020	2249760	That's so fucking backwards.
2249760	2254700	This is the kind of shit that gets you into the mess that you're in right now, where your
2254700	2257280	first party games are the only thing supporting that damn system.
2257280	2261120	So I don't know.
2261120	2264280	I've had a lot of time to think about this topic and I'm about to say some things that
2264280	2269820	might actually contradict things I've said 10, 15 episodes ago when, you know, this topic
2269820	2274200	first came up and I, opinions sometimes change, they shift and so forth.
2274200	2277160	But this is where my head is currently at with this stuff is that there are some things
2277160	2279440	I agree with you on, Loki.
2279440	2282960	Fundamentally though, I believe Nintendo deserves a cut.
2282960	2283960	I do.
2283960	2287560	I'm going to ask some people to hear that, but I fully believe that Nintendo deserves
2287560	2289280	a cut of the money.
2289280	2292800	And I think the best example I would have for this is something like Mystery Science
2292800	2299160	Theater 3000, where if, you know, if they are going to be skewing a movie and interjecting
2299160	2303980	their own dialogue and so forth, they still have to secure the rights for that movie and
2303980	2309240	give a cut or pay a one time fee or something from the original movie maker, unless the
2309240	2313440	movie's what, 75, 50 years old, and it's considered the public domain at that point, which I think
2313440	2315620	has happened with some of the movies they've done in the past.
2315620	2316800	But I digress.
2316800	2320400	I know a lot of Let's Players say that, well, people don't watch it for the games, they
2320400	2323280	watch it for the commentary or the opinions or things like that.
2323280	2328240	Well, if that's the case, try putting your commentary or opinion out there without the
2328240	2329980	game and see how well that does.
2329980	2334360	I do think the games do play an integral part and these things would not exist without the
2334360	2335360	game.
2335360	2340720	That being said, I think the method this is all being done is a little screwy and I can
2340720	2341720	agree with that.
2341720	2347000	I totally get the concept where it's stupid that YouTube takes a cut and PayPal takes
2347000	2352680	a cut and then, then, then, like that's all a little bit ridiculous and I get that.
2352680	2354860	Everybody's taking a piece off the top.
2354860	2358640	Here's where I think the problem ultimately lies and I think you've got the Let's Players
2358640	2363000	pointing fingers at Nintendo, you've got Nintendo pointing fingers at the Let's Players.
2363000	2365320	Do you know where the real fucking problem is?
2365320	2370960	The problem is YouTube and I've been saying this forever.
2370960	2374240	That's the one message that I think I have been consistent on from the very beginning.
2374240	2382040	The problem is YouTube but they are such a behemoth that nobody is making them do anything
2382040	2384280	about it and that's what blows my mind.
2384280	2389760	In my opinion, YouTube should have an established standard for this shit and be done with it
2389760	2390760	already.
2390760	2397040	But YouTube also needs to have some type of appeal system for their users as well as the
2397040	2402040	companies that want to contest things that are being used outside of copyright law that
2402040	2404120	are on the service and so forth.
2404120	2407200	YouTube is a giant fucking brainless robot.
2407200	2411640	Not only that but they're going to continue content ID matching stuff and you basically
2411640	2417040	have to get approval before you're able to make money off those videos.
2417040	2422760	Say for example you do a review series and you're reviewing a Nintendo game or something
2422760	2427440	like that then they could just say oh we're not going to approve your video.
2427440	2433280	Say you're critical on a certain Nintendo game, theoretically they could just say no
2433280	2435440	we're not going to approve your video.
2435440	2442880	I understand that's a little extreme but as I'll talk about later on in the show, it may
2442880	2449240	not be that out of the norm considering how people are manipulating the system to get
2449240	2451140	what they want.
2451140	2455620	There is a certain amount of fair use that needs to be allotted so that you can have
2455620	2458700	these reviews and you can have these critical opinions and so forth.
2458700	2464780	But when people have like 90 minute long let's plays where it's just we're making jokes along
2464780	2468380	with this game that we're playing along in the background, I'm not so sure that meets
2468380	2470420	the guidelines of fair use.
2470420	2476740	But YouTube needs to come out and say it is X, the line is drawn here so that way at least
2476740	2477900	everybody's playing by the same rules.
2477900	2481580	I understand let's plays but let's say for example you're doing a news show or something
2481580	2487420	like that on YouTube and you're talking about the news and a Nintendo story comes up like
2487420	2491140	oh Nintendo announced that such and such games coming out and you're talking about that and
2491140	2497860	you have part of the trailer playing in the background and they monetize that video.
2497860	2501220	In my opinion that's a YouTube problem.
2501220	2505380	That is fair use and YouTube should not be allowing that to be contested because a robot
2505380	2506780	fucking match that.
2506780	2507780	That's the problem.
2507780	2512020	And I've told yeah that's fair use if you're doing a news thing and you show an incidental
2512020	2514860	Nintendo thing absolutely that should be the news thing.
2514860	2519380	But here's the other side of that is that I also think there should be and this this
2519380	2522780	should be something that maybe Nintendo should kind of step up.
2522780	2528740	There should be kind of like a certain threshold like if you're making less than a hundred
2528740	2534180	dollars a year on YouTube videos which is where a lot of people are at a lot a lot of
2534180	2537220	people are at that line if you're making like less than a hundred dollars a year on
2537220	2540580	YouTube videos I kind of don't think this should apply to you.
2540580	2546180	And I think I mean I'm you know I understand the need for consistency and so forth but
2546180	2550100	if Nintendo wants to be good guy Nintendo then draw a line.
2550100	2554900	But I'm sorry I do have a lot of problems feeling sympathy for these people that like
2554900	2557140	you make millions of dollars.
2557140	2563580	You know somebody like PewDiePie makes millions of dollars off these let's plays and so forth
2563580	2568020	and you know they're complaining about oh we know we're going to get you know some of
2568020	2571300	this money to and it's all this whole ass line system whatever Nintendo wants to cut
2571300	2575760	the money but but but but I'm sorry I have a little problem feeling that much sympathy
2575760	2581260	for you when then XYZ gaming company just had to lay off 200 people this week and we're
2581260	2584300	going to hear an incident of that a little later on in the show.
2584300	2588620	Here's the reason why they have that kind of attitude is because they're fucking having
2588620	2594340	PewDiePie fucking quoted like a box quoted on a fucking advertisement in stores like
2594340	2598060	they showed that for I don't remember what fucking game it was but they had a PewDiePie
2598060	2599060	quote on it.
2599060	2601420	I think it was for Dying Light.
2601420	2605680	That's why that's why he's got a big head about this shit is because he's fucking getting
2605680	2610400	quoted as part of marketing for these games.
2610400	2614220	So yeah I mean he's a major channel and the fact that he's saying that I'm not going to
2614220	2619380	cover Nintendo products you know unless I feel like playing one of their games then
2619380	2624340	that's fine he has the right to do that but at the same time that's also kind of his thought
2624340	2628940	is that and I don't want to defend him because honestly personally I don't like the guy but
2628940	2635900	I find I find him I've seen 60 seconds of a video of his one time and that's it but
2635900	2641300	I'm not naive enough not to think he's not no I understand it could be a personality
2641300	2645860	plays on YouTube whatever I don't that's fine I just don't like his videos but I don't
2645860	2652780	I'm not faulting him for it per se but I'm just saying that you know it's up to his thought
2652780	2659660	is that he's helping market these games and that they should be thankful that he is you
2659660	2665300	know playing their products because he's in the past driven like for example they you
2665300	2669500	know in his Tumblr he cited you know like skate three he showed them playing skate three
2669500	2672100	all of a sudden that game shot back up through the charts even though it had been out for
2672100	2677980	a while that type of thing so he's got a sort of a point but at the same time I mean you
2677980	2681440	shouldn't feel entitled by that but I just think they're going about it the wrong way
2681440	2688300	I think you want people to be making like fan videos for it and so what if they're making
2688300	2692920	some money off of ad revenue I mean are you really that hard up for money that you need
2692920	2698340	to be making pennies off of these videos I mean it's not pennies though Loki I mean some
2698340	2703220	people it's not pennies but it's ad revenue though it's not if they want to put out creative
2703220	2707940	videos and charge ad revenue for it then by all means Nintendo you make some new original
2707940	2712940	content out there like let's plays hell just hire some of your treehouse people or something
2712940	2716420	to do some like interesting videos and start monetizing that shit if that's what you want
2716420	2721620	to collect money on but I feel I would actually agree that Nintendo can make a lot of money
2721620	2727620	doing in-house productions of this stuff I but but I also think you know it's not you
2727620	2731660	know that's why I talk about the threshold when we are talking about pennies then maybe
2731660	2734820	Nintendo should just write it off good guy Nintendo right but what we're talking about
2734820	2737740	hundreds of thousands of dollars which is what we're talking about with people like
2737740	2742460	PewDiePie I think it's totally okay that's that's ten people's jobs for the year out
2742460	2746500	of their pockets it's making no money on their pockets it's just like oh we feel we should
2746500	2750560	be getting paid some more money that's all it really is I think of anything you should
2750560	2756780	be putting as as few barriers between you and the people that want to you know expose
2756780	2760700	your game to others or like play up the game I mean if you're just putting that barrier
2760700	2764420	out there and saying okay well you could do this but you're gonna have to jump through
2764420	2768820	all these hoops in order to be getting paid you know for monetizing these videos fuck
2768820	2774820	it just I wouldn't do it I would just play something else I understand the concept of
2774820	2778520	it doesn't hurt them and so forth and the free advertising and so forth but you have
2778520	2783140	to understand there's another layer this is something that somebody said to me this week
2783140	2787160	about a particular game as I was telling this individual you should check out this
2787160	2791260	game you know I know it gets a lot of mixed reviews and some people say good things about
2791260	2794540	it some people say not so good things about it but I kind of think this game is up your
2794540	2798380	alley you should check it out and the person said to me isn't that one of those games it's
2798380	2801760	about three hours to beat and I said yeah it's only about three hours to beat and they
2801760	2805460	said you know I'll just look up a let's play of it on YouTube and I'll just watch it on
2805460	2810620	YouTube that way I don't have to spend the money and buy it that was something that was
2810620	2815340	said to me I am not making it up that it I mean I might be summarizing some quotes
2815340	2818660	and things but essentially that is the gist of the conversation then that's a problem
2818660	2823300	that that happens that's a problem then with the game designer if that your game is basically
2823300	2827580	good for one playthrough and that's it and there is no replayability to it then yes I
2827580	2831980	don't think you should spend the money on that if for example a perfect example of that
2831980	2837960	is that fucking Melger solid you know ground zeros bullshit that they put out they charge
2837960	2842320	you know like 30 bucks for and it's like a four hour game there's not much replayability
2842320	2847080	there so I'm not gonna spend my money on it so I see that exactly if like let's say for
2847080	2850640	example Call of Duty campaign if you're looking at like the single-player version of Call
2850640	2855040	Duty and you just want to know what the story is and say fuck it I wouldn't purchase the
2855040	2858520	game if it you're only gonna get one playthrough out of it what if I told you this game it
2858520	2863800	was a $10 indie game same problem though if it's three hours long and you're paying $10
2863800	2867720	so it costs 15 to go see a movie can I take a three hour movie and just put it on YouTube
2868600	2874080	no you cannot but there's some interactive problem there well then I'm sure that they're
2874080	2879080	gonna they can just monetize or do a copyright claim on if that's the problem they have such
2879080	2883200	a problem with people putting the if their three hour game on YouTube then do a copyright
2883200	2887960	claim against it since they can do that for the movie that I mean I'm assuming if that's
2887960	2892040	the problem they don't want the exposure of their short game on YouTube then they have
2892040	2896040	the rights to make a claim against it all right let me read some comments from chat
2896040	2899960	I don't mean to ignore folks in chat and Jamie I have no idea if you even have a thought
2899960	2905120	on this or if you're just kind of like there's there's no answer to this problem I don't
2905120	2912400	know Jamie I'm always like I like free money I like playing Nintendo I'm telling you personally
2912400	2917800	if I have you know whenever I finish a game someday I don't fucking care there's more
2917800	2921280	exposure it gets better for me you making money up if you're making hundreds of thousand
2921280	2926320	dollars of it yeah I'm a little jealous but good for you I mean who cares I think that
2926320	2932400	indie developers should have their own licensed let's play channels I I just I honestly think
2932400	2938080	if like twitch I almost said Justin TV if twitch TV could come out and just be like
2938080	2943940	we have signed agreements with Nintendo Sony and Microsoft on the rules for let's plays
2943940	2948120	and we're gonna introduce twitch on demand and you can record these let's plays and we'll
2948120	2952040	interject ads into it and you're gonna get 75% and they get 25% I don't know I'm making
2952040	2956840	these numbers up if they were to roll that out like this week and we have signed agreements
2956840	2963160	with these big three huge industry standard players and we have these signed agreements
2963160	2966840	this is how it's gonna be that would stab YouTube in the fucking heart it would and
2966840	2973000	now now it's game fucking on once again it's is the fewer barriers you have between your
2973000	2979640	consumer and you know their money basically you know making money off these videos the better it
2979640	2983640	will be if it's easier for me to make money off of twitch than it is YouTube then of course I'm
2983640	2987560	gonna go to twitch all right I got to do some chat room comments because it is a show where every
2987560	2992680	gamer has a voice sadly I can't read everything but let me get to some comments here um sg100
2992680	2997400	matt saying it's not about the amount of money it's about drawing a line and people profiting
2997400	3001640	off your products if they don't draw it now then there will be a point that someone will make
3001640	3007640	millions and millions off their game and the creators not seeing any of that uh pow in our
3007640	3012760	chat room at live.vog network.com says also it's a cultural thing I like this because it makes you
3012760	3018600	consider something different it's a cultural thing Japanese corporations are fighting a lot to stop
3018600	3024760	the quote let's watch the ending on YouTube thing uh now that pow says that it actually makes me
3024760	3030760	think Sony does this too you just don't hear about it as much but uh developers can block sections of
3030760	3035400	games from being recorded remember that uh when they they do the recording on ps4 sections of
3035400	3039880	games can be blocked so that way the endings of games can't be posted as easily you just like
3039880	3043640	telling me to a movie who gives a shit I'm sorry I don't buy that as an excuse
3045400	3051720	uh I kind of agree to a point that you can't stop it but they can make it harder uh let's see
3051720	3057240	dungeon buster says YouTube dug themselves into this hole in flying by the seat of their copyright
3057320	3063800	pants for so long uh let's see Kaijuto in chat says I disagree video games are not movies it's
3063800	3069960	different uh tiger claw says this is affecting giant bomb as well you'll have to watch videos
3069960	3074360	of their Nintendo coverage on their site well what's interesting about that solution is it's
3074360	3080440	removing YouTube which I have said is the problem it's removing YouTube from the equation which
3080440	3085400	considering that most of the stuff I think giant bomb bomb does is and I don't visit that site
3085400	3089160	every day so you'll have to correct me if I'm wrong most of the cases where they're using this
3089160	3093640	are going to be the review and news type I don't they don't do a lot of extended let's plays right
3094360	3099000	I don't think so they might but if they do and I'm just not aware of it keep in mind
3099000	3104040	Nintendo would have every right to step in and say you need to remove it or we're not
3104040	3108040	going to give you these games if you don't I mean they would have the right to play hardball
3108040	3113240	I mean I realize that could have ramifications but that could be an alley we go down if that happens
3113880	3119160	Marissa Congusto in chat at live.vognetware.com says still have to pay when you sample a song
3119160	3123080	I don't think it should matter if the profit is negligible but after that I see the point
3123720	3130280	so uh and powen chat says people go to jail in Japan for posting a single anime episode
3130280	3135320	it's not different with games it is different because there's an interactive element to games
3135320	3141080	where it's an anime episode there is not if you post a video of a game online it's not the same
3141080	3145160	as playing a game whereas if you post a movie online it's the same as watching the movie because
3145160	3149640	you're watching on the internet versus watching in a theater I'm with you to a point I mean
3149640	3155160	obviously I don't think anybody should go to jail over a let's play but uh I I think the let's play
3155160	3159480	simply would not exist without the game makers that's that they had a hand in creating the
3159480	3166280	content too it's a shared thing and if somebody were to step in and say rob those let's plays
3166280	3170680	that you've done of the classic games from 25 years ago comp the commodore company or whoever
3170680	3176040	wants a cut I'd be like all right they're gonna get five cents I sure know Nintendo's in a good
3176040	3182040	spot right now because their games are quality and they make some really awesome games but they're
3182040	3185720	not the only ones that make really awesome games out there and I gotta be honest this whole indie
3185720	3190840	resurgence thing there's a lot of great good indie games and you know what those indie guys don't
3190840	3195880	give a fuck about you monetizing their videos and so what's gonna come down to eventually is that
3196440	3200440	those people are just gonna be like oh hey you're gonna put barriers in front of me to play
3200440	3205320	these games well I'm just gonna play these games right here instead is what's gonna come down to
3206200	3211320	and they'll it'll be great for the indie guys to to be fair though just you know not all indie
3211320	3216040	guys I seem to recall Phil Fish which I realize is a controversial figure but he's made his
3216040	3223720	opinion very clear that he is in the minority thankfully and well he's got his own set of
3223720	3230200	issues but that's neither here nor there so but for the majority I think that people are pretty
3230760	3236040	open to the idea of you playing stuff and remember there's a whole you know let's play list of like
3236040	3240520	all the publishers and stuff that are okay with you doing that so I think that's a I think I think
3240520	3245560	it's a bummer there's not a standard I kind of I feel like there should just be a freaking standard
3245560	3250200	already but I as somebody who has done let's plays and puts things on YouTube and decides am
3250200	3254760	I going to monetize this or not I love that as a resource I do love that as a resource and when
3254760	3260520	I do a Nintendo game I just don't monetize it but I'm also like I'm not in a position I have
3260520	3265960	yet to see a check from YouTube and I've got a long way to go like I just don't have that type
3265960	3271160	of volume so it's not really something I think about but I kind of I like to think that if I
3271160	3275000	were in a position where I'm making a thousand dollars a month even off YouTube videos then I'd
3275000	3280360	be like all right well if you know the companies want their 25 30 percent per video even 50 percent
3280360	3284760	really per video then I guess they could be entitled to that but I don't think they should
3284760	3290920	be entitled to a hundred percent because I do think the creator of the let's play does share
3290920	3296680	in that with the people that made the game so the answer is somewhere in the 50 50 range somewhere
3296680	3301880	in there anyway um that's our thoughts on this we could go on for three hours and fill on this topic
3301880	3306520	alone I'm sure you guys have some strong opinions about this we welcome emails participate at orange
3306520	3310600	law on trading.com is the place to send emails we'll probably be continuing the discussion on
3310600	3315880	this on our forums a little bit this week as well which you can access at forums.vognetwork.com but
3315880	3319640	for now lots of other stuff going on in the news so we're going to get to some other news which
3319640	3325000	includes speaking of Nintendo there were some updates to Super Smash Brothers this week and
3325000	3329960	this is pretty cool because this is a pretty big update for a company that hasn't done a lot of
3329960	3334440	content patches for their games really we've they've been behind a little bit in that so this
3334440	3340760	is really cool to hear that Super Smash Brothers got 15 new eight player stages in a free update
3340760	3346440	so 15 modified eight player stages were added to Super Smash Brothers Wii U this week and you just
3346440	3351320	get it in a patch that you download and you're going to get new stages like Pokemon Stadium 2,
3352040	3359080	Wii Fit Studio, Luigi's Mansion, all these new levels for eight people to brawl in so that's
3359080	3363720	pretty cool I guess eight player mode must be doing very well for them to add all these stages
3363720	3368760	I bet it uh I bet this thing is a riot at conventions and anime conventions and gaming
3368760	3373080	conventions or my house or your house see I haven't I haven't had enough people over here
3373080	3377560	to play eight player Smash I mean we'll do computer characters but I bet if you actually have
3377560	3383480	eight people there playing I bet it's a riot it's chaos is it really it's great oh man you have to
3383480	3386840	have a huge tv to be able to see that though well this is in my living room yeah you guys have a
3386840	3391160	pretty decent sized tv I think we have the one here is too small 50 something inch yeah see that
3391160	3395960	that probably Dan wants us to get a 72 inch that would be perfect for Smash you need to be like
3395960	3401000	those uh people I was seeing online that was projecting the the football thingamabob today
3401000	3406200	on like a huge screen in their backyard that's what you need for Smash Brothers dear lord
3409080	3413320	you know what the whole neighborhood to be able to see I want Meta Knight to be the size of my head
3415000	3419400	all right well anyhow um some other interesting little kind of you know this could have been a
3419400	3425080	thing in Super Smash Brothers uh I guess through some discovery I don't know what this was like
3425080	3429480	if they had actually gone through files what was it disc files they were poking through files on
3429480	3433960	the disc well apparently uh Rhythm Heaven was going to have a character in the game
3433960	3439480	which actually makes a lot of sense now that we think about it uh also a stage based on Dr Mario
3439480	3445720	was going to be included which again makes a lot of sense now I would think that DLC would be a
3445720	3450200	great way to especially there's a new Rhythm Heaven game coming out for Wii U at some point
3450200	3456040	wouldn't that be a great tie-in to then have the character in Smash Brothers as DLC of course you
3456040	3462840	know I know Sakurai has said there's no plans for DLC but come on you want to talk about ways
3462840	3468040	Nintendo can make more money here's one of them there's no plans for DLC well there I know he
3468040	3473080	has said there's they already have a DLC character beyond Mewtwo beyond Mewtwo so that's like the one
3473080	3479880	but I just I can't see how it could just be one I don't get it so anyhow it could have been it
3479880	3488200	could have been a thing uh Darsaka well you know what's this the saying hackers gonna hack indeed
3489000	3495560	well they have found an exploit in the new 3DS that lets you run Game Boy Color ROMs
3496600	3502280	yep it was only a matter of time basically um it's something that you can do to side load Game Boy
3502280	3513720	Color ROMs it's a trick put out by a YouTube user named Kazowar who basically used emulation
3513720	3521160	meant for virtual console games to load the ROMs instead so his guide says that it relies on a
3521160	3527480	buffer overflow error that's currently in the web browser so if you load it with specific timing
3527480	3534840	you can get the uh you can replace a Game Boy Color game with a ROM on an SD card or something
3534840	3542200	stored online so of course uh it's actually it works with the last release 9.4 but um we're
3542840	3547640	probably gonna see it patched out before too long so yeah I'm sure Nintendo will be patching that
3547640	3553240	right up but like laugh it up kids in the meantime uh Pokemon Yellow for all hooray
3553480	3560680	hmm yeah or uh some of the classics yeah yeah well you know I think Pokemon's like the one game
3560680	3564520	people really want to see on virtual console that just isn't coming to virtual console
3564520	3568120	why put it on virtual console when you can remake it and I don't know I don't actually don't know
3568120	3572040	why those games don't really show up on virtual console I think you just nailed it uh Pokemon
3572040	3576760	Pinball did on Wii U because I picked that one up but uh yeah the Pokemon games themselves don't
3576760	3579720	really end up on virtual console you need something that's gonna use what the little
3579720	3585320	accelerometer thing in the yeah so uh well I think you know you said it hackers gonna hack
3585320	3590440	and uh if there's a way for people to play free games you know on their device that's what they're
3590440	3595400	gonna do you know just throwing it out there though not that I'm excusing it because you know
3595400	3601720	the piracy you know that's not supposed to supposed to happen that's very bad but you know
3601720	3607320	Nintendo could combat that a little bit if virtual console were a little more lucrative than just
3607320	3612360	straight up emulation you know what I mean like being able to play it online with my friends
3612360	3617880	which granted could still be considered emulation but hear me out here if there was a little more
3617880	3623960	to to to enrich the pot of virtual console it would make those options look a lot more attractive
3623960	3629640	and piracy look like the gutter option yeah it would look like oh this is this is the low class
3629640	3633960	option whereas if I pay the premium I'm going to get all these other cool features like
3633960	3641080	maybe multiple save states or uh maybe high definition textures or you know remastered
3641080	3646920	sound or I don't know there's a lot of things that they could do 3D effects which very very few um
3647480	3652200	uh the 3DS virtual console things have and they're usually considered separate releases and not a part
3652200	3656440	of the virtual console family but I've been saying that forever that virtual console could really
3656440	3660680	stand to sweeten the pot oh achievements would be another I know Nintendo doesn't have a centralized
3660680	3666520	achievement system but they could easily create one they could get on that I'm sure they will with
3666520	3672440	the next two or three consoles from now that they create just put it in the freaking Mario universe
3672440	3679080	call it coins you unlocked a coin and you know have the coins be have the coins be usable to like
3679080	3684280	buy backgrounds on the Wii U or 3DS or something even though I guess people are willing to pay real
3684280	3690120	money for the background so they don't need fake coins I just I don't know anyway there's an award
3690680	3696440	yeah award a certificate I don't know anything this is my just my silly thought how to make
3696440	3701320	virtual console a lot more lucrative and convince people to buy games all over again but maybe you're
3701320	3705480	right they're saving that for the Wii U 2 or whatever the next console is because that's how
3705480	3711160	they'll get you to pay five dollars for Super Mario Brothers again because this time it has
3711160	3716680	achievements or multiplayer or something or they just want anything they'll just put they'll still
3716760	3721560	charge you five dollars for Super Mario see who buys it again yeah maybe or you know you just
3721560	3728600	buy an original Nintendo and 50 50 cent Mario Brothers dot-com cart you're right you could
3728600	3732920	you could except the old Nintendos are getting harder and harder to play on the newer TVs
3732920	3737000	because you don't really have the um okay or you can buy one of those retron systems then
3737000	3742040	okay there you go there you go all right anyhow moving on with more news Loki all right so if you
3742040	3752440	want to take part of the Sony online breach class action lawsuit rewards then now's your time
3753000	3762920	to go ahead and sign up for that so if you head on over to PSNSOESettlement.com you can actually
3762920	3771240	sign up and register to receive such rewards as three months free of PlayStation Plus or some
3771240	3776760	games that they already offered up to people that are affected by the breach the first time
3777480	3783640	or some shitty dynamic themes for your PlayStation 3 which really why would you pick that that's
3783640	3788680	literally the worst option that you can pick on all of those to qualify you must have had a
3788680	3794520	PlayStation Network curiosity or Sony entered online entertainment account on or before May
3794520	3803320	14th 2011 and uh you can receive I guess one or two one or two games um the three months
3803320	3808920	or those stupid themes I don't know why you'd pick those things I'm not even considering that
3808920	3814440	an option but uh yeah I went ahead and did that even though I got my free games yeah I was to say
3814440	3819880	I guess I could do this because hey free game but I do kind of feel like well you know Sony
3819880	3824040	kind of already gave free games whatever they're offering up free PlayStation Plus so I'm gonna
3824040	3829480	take it yeah and you know have you never had PlayStation Plus ever let me tell my PlayStation
3829480	3833560	Plus now but it's gonna extend it three more months oh well shit and that's maybe what I'm
3833560	3837640	gonna grab out of that yeah exactly so I mean yeah I thought originally that was only supposed
3837640	3842840	to be for people who never had PlayStation Plus before no get that oh it's for anybody but there's
3842840	3846440	a lot of people ask and you know getting that minute drops it down the one month but that's
3846440	3850360	still an extra month that's still an extra month so you know I'll do that because all the games
3850360	3856360	that they were offering up or literally the same games that they had um before as part well no it
3856360	3862200	wasn't exactly the same they had like uh puppeteers on there now so they had some decent games but
3862200	3868600	it's just a lot of them already had um I just didn't want them so and the themes like I said
3868600	3873080	themes are not even really an option for me at all yeah why would I do that uh running a little
3873080	3876920	behind on our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com but I wanted to read a comment there's there's
3876920	3880760	still a lot of people talking about the copyright dispute and I totally understand that but trying
3880760	3885080	to pick out some of the comments of the stories we just read uh Dartetsuya says to be fair I'm
3885080	3889400	sure they'll still offer a discount for owners of the previous versions of the ROM he's talking
3889400	3893560	about the virtual console thing about how Wii U 2 or you know whatever it's gonna be obviously well
3893560	3897560	that's assuming that their their online services can talk to each other because they still haven't
3897560	3902920	quite figured that out too well to be fair you can get if you bought it on the Wii and then you
3902920	3906920	have the Wii U you can get the game for like a dollar and it is it is a better experience on
3906920	3911640	Wii U than it was the Wii but you know it's it's worth about that dollar you know what I mean so
3912200	3919560	I hate to be fair that is stupid I'm sorry when and we're we're living in a day and age where
3920120	3925320	you know Call of Duty Advanced Warfare you can buy it on PlayStation 4 and get it on PlayStation
3925320	3932840	3 for you know 3 for free or vice versa but yet Nintendo can't fucking offer me a free copy of
3933320	3941000	goddamn ROM that they've made tons and tons of money off of already I mean that see this is
3941000	3945240	exactly the type of company that we're dealing with here that feels that they are owed money
3945240	3949240	for every fucking step of the way so you actually reminded me of a game I totally played for a
3949240	3952200	little bit this week that I forgot to talk about during my gaming week so I guess I'll bring it up
3952200	3956520	now because talking about ROMs and things I played Metroid Prime Trilogy because that came out on Wii
3956520	3960600	U it was only 10 bucks right I played a little bit of it I mean I didn't play enough of it obviously
3960600	3964680	I didn't even think about it during my gaming week but I played a little bit of that and I gotta say
3965240	3969320	that was kind of nice to be able to buy that for ten dollars on Wii U because there was no fucking
3969320	3973720	way I was gonna pay like fifty dollars for it at GameStop or whatever it was or they were way
3973720	3978200	overcharging for it because there was a lot of copies of it that's awesome yeah that they're
3978200	3982360	you know that they charge the extra money for you wonder why they set that precedence because
3982360	3986360	Nintendo makes fucking exclusive deals with them all the goddamn time once again and you know I
3986360	3990680	don't like that and I don't like that so I was very happy when Nintendo was like we're gonna
3990680	3994840	offer it for ten dollars digitally I was like all right cool now I can finally pick this up because
3994840	4000120	I had Prime 3 and I think I had Prime 1 on the GameCube but I don't even really have a way to
4000120	4006040	play GameCube games anymore my Wii's not even hooked up so I never bought Prime 2 so I was like
4006040	4009720	all right I'll spend ten dollars on the collection the only thing that kind of bummed me out and I
4009720	4017000	forgot that they changed this in Prime trilogy is that you only have Wii motion controls in Prime 1
4017000	4022520	and 2 well Prime Metroid Prime was for the GameCube and used a GameCube controller so I
4022520	4026840	thought oh I'll be able to use my classic controller that nope I got to use the Wiimote
4026840	4031960	and the nunchuck that's not a problem with the Wii I mean that was the way they did it on trilogy
4031960	4037880	for the Wii I just forgot about that yeah oh but god damn we spend any ounce of effort to like I
4037880	4043560	don't know make it better you know fuck us you know for you know expecting them to do something
4043560	4048840	I would have appreciated the ability to use classic no no effort and all the fucking reward
4048840	4056120	that is why they're fucking charging for fucking advertisement yeah all right anyhow moving on
4056120	4064920	you know who is paying who valve yes valve is paying valve has actually paid out a lot of money
4064920	4072360	they've paid over 57 million dollars out to content creators folks who have created items
4072360	4081400	for team fortress 2 dota 2 counter strike global offense and this is also spread out amongst 75
4081400	4087240	different countries so basically all of these people who have been throwing stuff you know out
4087240	4093640	there for valves products have been reaping the benefit I mean they are clearly appreciative
4093640	4101400	in fact they've even uh you know said uh one of their developers uh uh Alden Kroll said uh today
4101400	4105640	we're happy to announce that after a ton of work the first curated workshops for non-valve games
4105640	4111400	have opened so they've expanded it dungeon defenders eternity and chivalry medieval war
4112040	4119560	so there's more and more coming out so they're like hey thanks you're keeping our stuff alive
4120120	4124280	here's some money I wasn't even thinking of valve when we were talking about all these other
4124280	4129720	stories you know um probably it has to do with consoles versus pc and for obvious reasons I
4129720	4135400	associate valve a little more with pc ends of things and mac computers in general right so
4135400	4140040	I kind of associate valve with that but it is interesting that valve is not only a game maker
4140040	4145240	but they have this service and now they have this whole game streaming thing within it where you can
4145240	4149640	stream the games to your friends and so forth I mean they've essentially built that for their own
4149640	4154040	games now granted there's no revenue sharing in that there's none of that comes into play but just
4154040	4158680	kind of kind of interesting to see how things are are from that angle and then what you just
4158680	4162840	mentioned right there with all these community market things that are selling for uh quite a bit
4162840	4170040	of money there and I bet valve gets quite a nice cut of that as well well uh speaking of steam now
4170040	4174520	you can't make any community market items for this game I don't think anyway yet I don't even know if
4174520	4180040	there's trading cards but you can get the definitive version of Quantic Dream's indigo
4180040	4188280	prophecy it is now available on steam as well as ios pc mac linux all those different platforms
4188280	4195400	it is available for nine dollars and 99 cents uh you can pick that up uh if you don't know uh
4195400	4201160	the game indigo prophecy uh it is by the folks who made heavy rain if I'm not mistaken Quantic
4201160	4207800	Dream right so you can check out this early uh early game of theirs um this version now the
4207800	4214200	original game was capped at a resolution of 1024 by 768 but this new version will allow resolutions
4214200	4222680	up to 2880 by 1800 and they say they gave every game texture in the game a facelift so some have
4222680	4228680	four times the detail that they used to have but for ios there is a two gigabyte size limit
4228680	4232760	so some of the textures are only double what they used to be so I mean but if you're going to be
4232760	4237160	playing the game on something a little more portable than something on your desktop I would
4237160	4241720	think that uh that would be a given there that it's not going to be quite quite the same so
4241720	4248760	uh that's pretty cool uh and in the faqs they say no cut or censored content in this version
4248760	4254920	so if you're worried if anything got cut along the way don't worry you don't have to do you ever
4254920	4260920	play indigo prophecy you guys anybody in this room no it may be my steam library I honestly
4260920	4264520	don't know do you think you picked it up and you just haven't I may have picked it up at one time
4265320	4272680	I wouldn't know though all right so there you go uh awesome well let's travel around the world and
4272680	4278840	check out some release dates we're gonna go uh see what's coming out to a store near you yeah
4278840	4284440	that much this week is pretty actually oh it's pretty dead um we've got a couple games first one
4284520	4293720	being motorcycle club which is on playstation 3 and playstation 4 and then criminal girls invite
4293720	4301240	only on a playstation vita no it's not a porn game maybe it's a porn game I don't know um and
4301240	4312600	then spongebob hero pants on playstation vita xbox 360 and 3ds thank you activision um that's it
4312600	4319720	all right well I usually would do the japanese release dates right now but the website I use
4319720	4324120	for those is down so I'm going to try to find an alternate resource here real quick uh dark soccer
4324120	4329800	would you mind uh doing things out of order here live radio it's a blast there's only one it's on
4329800	4336440	the february 4th grow home will be out on pc which um I don't even know what that's about
4337240	4344040	I'm gonna look at it maybe you like have a one of those uh hydroponic gardens that uh
4344040	4350920	oh it's by ubisoft it's an experimental pc platformer called grow home with a little
4350920	4362200	robot and it looks like he's stuck hanging out in um nights into dreams yeah all right well uh
4362200	4365800	I guess I'm not gonna be able to do japanese releases this week so sorry japan nothing is
4365800	4370920	coming out in your region absolutely nothing I'm just kidding uh let's move on though uh we've
4370920	4376120	got a few more news stories for you guys than the classic game of the week first up loki all right
4376120	4382440	so sony has pulled the support for a few of their non-game apps on the vita which is kind of sad
4382440	4390600	um I remember also they've dropped was it um near but I guess the maps app and the youtube app will
4390600	4397800	be removed as well um I guess the maps app you know which I think used some of the features of
4397800	4406280	near um is not or it's expected to be removed as part of um I guess a march update and then the
4406280	4413320	youtube app will be gone by april 20th so they're seeing though that you could still access youtube
4413320	4419640	through the web browser but it is kind of lame that they're removing that and honestly I don't
4419640	4424360	know why they would be doing that unless maybe they were doing an update to the whole I I'm some
4424360	4429400	part of me is like hoping that maybe they're doing just an update to the whole operating system on
4429400	4435000	the vita maybe that's going to be taking effect sometime soon and they're just removing this stuff
4435000	4440120	because it's going to be replaced by something better because I can't imagine that you know
4440120	4446680	having google maps on there is such a drain or of resources or something I don't really understand
4446680	4454920	why they would remove that but kind of disappointing um well the near I never understood
4454920	4463000	anyway so I I I haven't used that since the vita first came out near I think was more of like kind
4463000	4467960	of street passing but without going anywhere but it didn't make sense they never explained it very
4467960	4473400	well in the interface it was kind of silly um which I understand near isn't necessarily getting
4473400	4478200	shut down or whatever but without the maps functionality in the vita that may I think it's
4478200	4482840	probably a licensed thing wasn't uh wasn't vita licensing that from google wasn't sony licensing
4482840	4487640	the maps thing from google the license probably ran out and they decided so few people use it they
4487640	4492760	didn't want to renew it that's my thought anyway oh it's probably what it is uh and then uh the
4492760	4497480	youtube app probably because it works on the website and the vita you know level of people
4497480	4501000	who use youtube on the vita is so small they probably just don't want to use the resources
4501000	4505320	updating the vita app anymore so they have no no more support for it because youtube does add new
4505320	4511400	stuff like uh god what is it I saw now on the web is that it will auto play the next thing on the
4511400	4516040	playlist which I hate that shit when I go to youtube I want to watch one video if I want to
4516040	4520520	watch a playlist I'll let you know I'll make my own playlist but uh yeah I mean so the youtube
4520520	4523960	technologies are changing all the time so they probably just didn't want to build that into
4524520	4530280	uh the apps I'm actually glad they're going html5 oh did they yeah I thought they I thought they
4530280	4535080	were already on that for a while well I mean one thing I don't know if you've noticed um flash has
4535080	4540120	had like a bajillion updates lately it's so annoying and then now it's it freaking locks me
4540120	4544600	like it shuts flash down on every website unless I'm willing to update which is a real pain in the
4544600	4548840	butt while I'm trying to do these shows no well the other thing too is that I think that that
4548840	4553960	might be part of the reason why they've gone to html5 yeah but that of course you know watching
4553960	4559960	youtube on ios devices without having uh their app would you know that would help right but I
4559960	4565000	mean the app's all right yeah but I just think it's needed the technology is finally you know
4565000	4569880	yeah make it becoming more accessible to other people I like to use the app to load something
4569880	4573240	up and then I push the button that plays it on my playstation 4 that's what I like just
4573240	4576360	just trying to find something with the controller is a pain in the ass we've got a chromecast for
4576360	4582680	that oh yeah I don't have a chromecast for that so 30 bucks all right I'm cheap I have a playstation
4582680	4589000	4 that plays almost everything so I don't usually need one all right uh one more story for you guys
4589000	4594120	and this is about uh this is about a series that I love I love this and I'm not sure how I feel
4594120	4600360	about this news um one of my very very very favorite puzzle games ever is luminous and
4600360	4605720	luminous of course was a game that came out from q entertainment uh they also did another great
4605720	4612360	puzzle game very underrated game on the ds not the 3ds but the ds it was called medios and I love
4612360	4616760	this game and they did like a disney version of it that was eh and then they did a version on the
4616760	4621720	xbox 360 that was really weird to control with a controller but it was it was adequate for what it
4621720	4629880	was but anyway luminous and medios are two big awesome puzzle games uh that are apparently now
4629880	4637800	part of mobcast mobcast acquired luminous and medios from q entertainment so what are they
4637800	4645240	doing they're making a new luminous game for ios and android this will be a collaboration with
4645240	4651480	tetsuya mizuguchi so that's very interesting so that's where i feel mixed is because i love a lot
4651480	4657720	of q entertainment stuff but granted that's probably because of tetsuya mizuguchi so to hear
4657720	4663400	that he's still involved makes me a little more hopeful um i guess it's cool that it's coming to
4663400	4671400	cell phones uh i remember there was a luminous on ios and it was awful because the controls were
4671400	4677800	awful so if they're gonna fix that then i guess uh it'll be better i'm also very interested to
4677800	4682920	see what this is going to mean for medios because now medios with touch controls i could kind of see
4682920	4689400	that that actually might be really cool um so i'm curious to see how this all plays out so anyway
4689400	4695960	um mizuguchi is going to be working on luminous from his new studio enhance games but of course
4695960	4702760	mizuguchi left q entertainment uh after founding co-founding it in 2003 he left it in march so i
4702760	4707000	mean you know again i think a big part of the reason why i like q entertainment so much is
4707000	4713080	because of him so if he was gone anyway then at least he's still involved with these these babies
4713080	4719880	uh luminous and medios so um good luck mob cast and don't fuck it up because i really love these
4719880	4726680	games and i really need them to be good on the uh mobile devices if that i mean i kind of wish
4726680	4731880	it was console but i understand the vita one may not have done as well as y'all wanted it to and
4731880	4735240	maybe that's why q entertainment was looking to get rid of it or maybe they realized there wasn't
4735240	4739640	much they could do with it without tetsuya mizuguchi so i don't know i'm trying to keep an
4739640	4745080	open mind please please please don't screw it up mob cast please all right well let's go back to
4745080	4750520	let's go back to a more classic time in gaming's history because playing games on your portable
4750520	4755960	phones what is that about that's not something we used to do back in the day snake no you didn't
4755960	4760920	even have snake there was no more your phones were still attached to the wall remember my
4760920	4765960	that's mario nokia phone yeah that was great you see that over there by the coffee machine
4765960	4769480	you see that on the wall that's a phone jack you ever seen one of those before
4769480	4777320	yes and notice how it's rob i'm older than you i know you are that where i get my internet from
4777320	4781720	no no back in the day a little different all right yeah back in the day you'd have to call
4781720	4785640	you have to call aol have a second one put in so people could use the phone instead of knocking
4785640	4790120	you offline that's why aol was made although i'm not really sure we should introduce our listeners
4790120	4796920	to what the modem really sounds like all right listen to dubstep you'll get an idea all right
4796920	4803480	here it is your classic game of the week from way back when today's game is hino tori ho
4803480	4811160	hen uh gaonoboken which translates to phoenix chronicles gal's adventure and it was uh the
4811160	4815720	version in particular that we're covering today is the famicom version that was done by konami
4815720	4822440	not the msx one it had a similarly named one on msx um but the games were based off the manga
4822440	4831880	called a hino tori or phoenix uh done by um osamu teska who did uh tetsu on adam uh as in uh
4832760	4837560	what did we call him over here again astro boy yeah i had to think about that for a moment
4837560	4843320	because uh he also did um kimba the white lion and blackjack so those are a few others that
4843320	4848600	people over here might be more familiar with um so basically it's the story of a guy uh named
4848600	4855720	gaol who as a kid lost an arm and an eye and he was teased poor guy and he grew up bitter
4856440	4865160	very bitter and so uh as the story goes he's going um he uh basically got married had a you
4865160	4873400	know had a family and then went crazy and killed his wife so he's dark story yeah so basically he
4874360	4881080	went to try to reform his wife he became a buddhist became a sculptor and now uh he
4881080	4890840	is on a uh quest to recover pieces of a phoenix statue that's uh basically he's trying to get
4890840	4895800	eternal life by drinking the blood of the phoenix so basically it's a platform game
4895800	4901400	um you have to take gaol through uh 16 different levels to get 16 sculpture fragments and put the
4901400	4907640	phoenix back together um you have boss enemies at the end of each stage um in some levels instead
4907640	4914040	of the boss enemy you actually have to avoid traps um or you know walls or different things to you
4914040	4919720	know that try to impede your process it also has a life system so you have three lives and each have
4919720	4924040	a number of hit points so if you you know get hit by something you lose a hit point and when you get
4924040	4928920	zero you lose one of the three lives you also uh can lose lives by falling into a pit or failing
4928920	4935560	to complete the level before the timer runs out um and then um you also have a little thing that
4935560	4940200	you can do where if you are in a situation where you're trapped and can't progress you can press
4940200	4945880	the select button and he self-destructs you start the level over um and if he of course loses all
4945880	4950760	three of his lives he uh you get game over and you get the chance to continue from the beginning
4950760	4957080	of the stage so it's really a simple game i mean it's super fun uh i have i've played this one
4957080	4963400	before um i like the msx one because sort of like shock troopers except and well kind of like that
4963400	4968520	actually it's like a shooter like a playing game except you're running on the ground um but i like
4968520	4973640	the adventure games a little bit better especially since you know it's got such a compelling story
4973640	4980200	and i don't know if anyone's ever read any of the uh phoenix manga but it's such a good story i mean
4980200	4985880	it really is there's uh ferronome fans out there there's oavs i think the last one came out in 80
4985880	4991400	something i want to say but just gorgeous animation and it's nice you know that the
4991400	4997720	video games made it into parts of the story as well so um and it's so you're basically looking
4997720	5006600	at a little bit of uh one of the best known uh manga anime series that have been out but added
5006600	5012920	into the video game lore as well so there you go can you say the name of this game one more time
5012920	5022520	oh good lord in notary he notary hole and uh gal no bulking so um but now for anyone
5022520	5026840	who is a fan of diverse systems okay look here you listen
5031320	5039320	no i am not listening okay um there was a cd done by uh tomoyan that was 8-bit versus diverse systems
5039960	5044840	and one of the songs from the series made it in so uh if you listen to the end of the show you
5044840	5051480	might get to hear it uh live live live not podcast if not then you have to go out and
5051480	5059960	purchase a legitimate copy of or just find it on youtube all right uh there it is uh your classic
5059960	5064360	giveaway and i'm looking at chat there's a few people in chat talking about how um old anime
5064360	5068440	was dark i'm sorry i haven't watched i haven't watched a lot of the old ever watched dog of
5068440	5074920	flanders old prepare to cry old cartoons to me are like the muppet babies okay and the stuff
5074920	5079880	i grew up on which you know the muppet babies wasn't really a dark show although it would have
5079880	5091800	been funny if it was uh i just i was just thinking about i was reading the chat actually because pow
5091800	5097000	was like phoenix mongola was so good without being preachy yeah because i mean i've i've
5097000	5103880	always been a fan of um tesica his work has been just top notch and really uh approached topics
5103880	5111800	that were not really i think touched it at the time that he did it so it's very very brilliant
5111800	5118040	mind all right well there it is your classic game of the week pow dog of flanders where happiness
5118040	5124040	goes to die all right well that was a good pick that was one i have to admit i didn't really know
5124040	5128600	a lot about that game but knowing that it didn't i'm all about education that's good you got to
5128600	5133720	educate the masses heck yeah and i'm surprised you didn't you know most people you would expect
5133720	5141400	would have done something this week like techmo bowl or super high impact fuck the superb i was
5141400	5145720	trying to think of games that had owls as the head character i'll see that would have been there but
5145720	5149400	i would that would have just had me doing ocarina of time and how we wanted to shoot that owl in
5149400	5156520	his face i kept throwing so many deck uh games and star owls i keep thinking of harry potter
5156520	5161480	i don't know why head fig games the star what if there had been a head big in the angry inch video
5161480	5170200	game where you play as head big as the head big rpg you have to go never mind i don't know you're
5170200	5175160	just you're working as a midnight check out girl new new dream game head big in the angry
5179160	5186520	go into rpg maker and make me a head big game that is your commandment do the thing and on
5186520	5193560	and on the fourth day dark sakura said let there be head big awesome and there was snipping all
5193560	5198680	right uh look we're gonna take a break guys we got plenty more show to come when we come back
5198680	5202680	with more of orange launch radio right after this we have uh rapid fire news frugal question
5202680	5207640	of the week and that news segment coming up when we come back with more of orange launch radio right
5207640	5221720	after this welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live on this sunday night february the 1st
5221720	5227960	with the 585th episode of our show already in progress all right so i've been teasing
5227960	5231800	out earlier in the show that we're going to try out a new segment in the show and we're
5231800	5236600	going to put it right here and this is a response to you know last week you guys were talking about
5236600	5242200	or we all were really talking about the uh forums over at vog network.com and how um you know not a
5242200	5247240	lot of people are really using the forums and some of you guys in chat were like well you know we
5247240	5251080	we'd probably use the forums a little more if there were you know some discussions that you
5251080	5255240	know were were motivating us to go over there and post so i thought you know what all right all
5255240	5259720	right you know we get into a lot of debates here on the show we get into a lot of topics that we
5259720	5265560	talk about that maybe we're not always necessarily done even though we have a generous three hours
5265560	5270440	which is longer than most podcasts go for uh sometimes even three hours isn't enough to talk
5270440	5274600	about all the things that go on in gaming during the week so we might go over to the forums and
5274600	5279320	continue a conversation so you'll probably see me posting on the forums a lot uh either on the
5279320	5284760	orange lounge radio forum or in our general video gaming vog network forum you might see loki or
5284760	5289800	dark sakura pop over there as well as they have some things to say and then you guys have some
5289800	5296920	things to say and we're gonna kind of wrap that all into a segment we call forum follow-up so
5296920	5300840	let's get started with tonight's forum follow-up to some of the topics from last week's show
5304840	5308680	all right so for tonight's forum i thought something a little funky for this segment
5308680	5311960	would be a little bit a little bit different for you guys all right uh let's get to tonight's
5311960	5317080	forum follow-up so there's uh two topics i want to follow up on tonight and one is last week we
5317080	5323080	were talking about uh what makes a game worthy of your subscription fees and i made a post over
5323080	5327880	on the forums kind of expanding on my thoughts a little more about uh elder scrolls online and the
5327880	5332200	fact that elder scrolls online was going to be losing the subscription fee element of it and i
5332200	5336280	kind of asked the question like what why is it that some people will still pay for wow they'll
5336280	5341480	pay for final fantasy 14 what makes the game more worthy of those subscription fees and you can read
5341560	5346920	what i had to say on it over on the forums or you can listen to what flaco jones said in response
5346920	5353480	and flaco jones on this topic said i hate sub fees hate hate hate but i re-subbed to wow because
5353480	5359320	i love the game and i just had to see the new content i only pay 30 days at a time though never
5359320	5364280	recurring so i have the option to start and stop when i want it's worth it because i'm having a
5364280	5370680	blast but i think a sub model is so outdated and a rip-off when 60 games like skyrim dragon age and
5370680	5375480	diablo give you hundreds of hours of content let's not talk about how many hours i've sunk
5375480	5382360	into diablo 3 okay you know it just popped it in my head huh i can quit any time yeah right yeah
5382360	5385640	i'm sure that's what alan would say about diablo 3 right now because he's not playing right now or
5385640	5389160	anything he's either playing that or dragon age inquisition it's got to be one of those he's
5389160	5393080	playing laundry he's playing with sanrio to be fair he's playing i did go back and pet sanrio
5393080	5398120	by the way good good uh continuing on with flaco jones's thought here uh hundreds of hours of
5398120	5404120	content for one price and maybe add on some dlc to pay for later if wow just charge subs to do
5404120	5409880	stupid endgame crap like rating or whatever i'd be the happiest gamer ever because i just like to
5409880	5416280	level and question stuff and i think paying for the expansion should cover the cost at least um
5416280	5421080	so that was on that topic and then another topic to follow up on was amiibos at the top of the show
5421080	5425720	last week i was talking a little bit about amiibo and how i personally was feeling like i'm kind of
5425720	5431240	over it like i am over this amiibo fever i hate this artificial shortage that nintendo is creating
5431240	5436440	they should just have an online store when this stuff is so popular like i i spelled out my
5436440	5443880	thoughts on the forums a little more um verbosely and some of you guys responded to uh my thoughts
5443880	5449560	and so i want to read some of those responses uh gamer fox replied and said the extremely limited
5449560	5455240	availability of certain amiibo is a real turn off it's also frustrating to order the products online
5455320	5459880	as orders have been canceled or postponed indefinitely but for me most of the hunt
5459880	5464440	happens in person and i've been pretty lucky so far in scoring some from various retailers like
5464440	5468680	toys r us which is right by my house i'm not looking for a complete collection which sets
5468680	5473160	me apart from others perhaps i'm okay with not getting all those really limited characters as
5473160	5478440	long as they're not ones that i really want like uh like bowser or legend of zelda characters
5478440	5483240	my latest pickup last night was literally a stroke of pure luck i can see how that kind of roll the
5483240	5488920	dice can be frustrating for fans i entirely echo that sentiment i'm mostly collecting the amiibo
5488920	5492920	because they're collectibles and i like the figures i'm also hoping for some increased
5492920	5499800	functionality from nintendo down the line too and then uh pow also responded to this and said
5499800	5504440	i like the amiibo but the low availability changed my initial plan to get them all
5504440	5509080	i'm not going to start a collection when even mr awata is telling me that having the whole
5509080	5513000	collection is going to be hard i got the ones that i consider to be classics and now i'm
5513000	5517800	done with amiibo i wasn't surprised with the initial sold out panic moment but i am surprised
5517800	5522440	with nintendo's lack of interest for restocking them i'm not buying the whole shelf space is a
5522440	5527160	challenge story since i was born in europe and many of my european buddies don't have as many
5527160	5532280	issues to find them than my american friends sorry but the idea that shelf space is an issue in the
5532280	5537880	usa but not in japan sounds like a bad joke even if that excuse is true you have an online store
5537880	5544040	nintendo use it oh pow really summarizes my feelings on the matter uh personally very well
5544040	5548440	i think it makes a great point there is it's like okay so you somehow have the shelf space in japan
5548440	5552280	but you don't have it here i mean i guess i understand the collectibles may be a little more
5553000	5556520	of a thing in japan but i just i have a hard time believing that shelf space is that big of a
5556520	5562440	concern here especially with how crazy some of that stuff sells and um you know even today target
5562440	5568840	released the rosalina figures and i know multiple people on twitter that were up at the crack of
5568840	5575080	dawn to go line up a target and get their rosalina figures you know and like i'm not one to knock on
5575080	5580440	other people's hobbies and what's fun for you and if you got a reward out of that i'm happy for you
5580440	5586440	and so forth but it's kind of one of those like i am like over it like if why can't i just log on to
5586440	5592520	amazon and buy it like a new pair of socks like or any other nintendo game or something like that
5592520	5599080	like i don't understand why it's such a it's like it's february 1st it's not the holidays where
5599080	5603880	we're all lining up for that stuff it's just it's so weird to me so weird uh looking in the chat room
5603880	5608440	over at live.vog network.com fifth dream says ami bover it
5611640	5615880	anyway uh i hate to i hate to leave that so negative on amiibo but that was uh that was
5615880	5619400	some of the feedback but i have seen a lot of positive i think the people that feel real
5619400	5623720	positive about amiibo are just too busy playing super smash brothers and leveling their amiibos
5623720	5628760	to 50 uh to comment this week i guess i'm gonna assume that's the case so anyway there it is
5628760	5633000	first edition of forum feedback we obviously we're never gonna be able to read every forum post
5633000	5637160	and they'll usually have to be edited for length but we do you know it is a show where every gamer
5637160	5641560	has a voice and our forums is another place where you can share your voice over at vog network.com
5641560	5645720	you click on forums or you can just go to forums.vognetwork.com
5648040	5652200	to register participation for this week's episode of orange on radio at vognetwork.com
5652200	5657320	use the passphrase rice all right let's get into some rapid fire news tonight loki
5657960	5668440	okay so i don't know you know basically dragon's dogma online sounds pretty awesome and it's this
5668520	5674920	brand new free-to-play game that they're gonna be putting out on playstation 4 playstation 3 and pc
5675560	5680360	now i never really got into the original dragon dogma game but this almost sounds like and
5680360	5685880	i don't know if you've heard much about it rob it almost sounds like to me the co-op stuff that
5685880	5692200	they have for dragon age inquisition because it's basically going and be going off um with parties
5692200	5699720	i guess they're saying um parties of eight are um you know i guess up to four players for certain
5699720	5705320	parties and then they also have um you can spawn ai players as well so up to a party of eight four
5705320	5712600	player real people and then um i guess that you just kind of go off on these like quests and stuff
5712600	5716520	and do different missions or whatever but they're also going to have these hub worlds where there's
5716520	5721800	a bunch of people they can interact with so maybe a little bit dragon age inquisition and maybe a
5721800	5728200	little bit like fancy star online i guess i don't know well those are some of my favorite games
5728200	5732520	although i in all honesty i kind of find the dragon age inquisition multiplayer to be a little
5732520	5737880	bit repetitive it's it's it feels way more grindy than mass effect did it doesn't it doesn't click
5737880	5741800	the same for me but again i know other people are really enjoying it so i'm not to knock on
5741800	5745800	other people's fun but this dragon's dogma sounds very interesting i don't know much about the online
5745800	5750360	one but uh i'd check it out yeah they haven't really announced any sort of dates or anything
5750440	5756040	and right now it's just scheduled for japan this year so i guess we'll have to wait a little bit
5756040	5763960	before we hear about it or hopefully it does come over here who knows um but yeah um sounds
5763960	5769560	interesting uh they're saying though they also um there was a european trademark for the game as
5769560	5775160	well so hopefully that means that there will be um an international release for it as well at least
5775160	5783160	in the uk um and then to go along um with a game that i've been playing lately which is the lego
5783160	5792280	marvel superheroes they have now um announced a few more lego titles for 2015 and with that
5792280	5801800	includes um lego jurassic world and lego's marvel adventures or marvel's avengers yeah so um
5802520	5808440	i guess i'll have to pick up the avengers game and they haven't really said yet when those are
5808440	5814920	supposed to be coming out oh um also if you're not into the licensed lego like movie properties
5814920	5820280	they also have the lego ninjago shadow of ronin that's supposed to be coming out later on i got
5820280	5828360	made to watch some of that show the lego ninjago yes i'm trying to get my son to watch other lego
5828360	5835560	stuff because uh you know they don't really have um it made more marvel games it made my soul hurt
5835560	5840760	have they done lego jurassic park games before or is this the first lego jurassic park toys i think
5840760	5845640	huh but not not the games not not games i think i mean i remember the jurassic park games back when
5845640	5850120	like that first movie was out and like i the super nintendo one was scary as hell because that was
5850120	5853960	right when first person and doom doom s type of games were really starting to take over so they
5853960	5859400	kind of did that on super it was scary interesting see what they do um i don't know they had raptors
5859400	5864040	in one of the levels in lego marvel superheroes the thing that doesn't click for me is that
5864040	5867240	jurassic park and that whole thing it's not i i didn't think it was supposed to be something that
5867240	5873880	was cute like it's kind of scary i guess it's you know it's pg-13 scary it's you know poltergeist
5873880	5878200	scary but it's still scary yeah i don't know how they're gonna exactly do that could could they do
5878200	5885400	lego poltergeist if they can do lego can we have a little lego gypsy lady and if you don't own
5885400	5889640	consoles though but you have um an ios device they also announced that they're gonna be bringing the
5889640	5895640	lego movie and lego batman 3 beyond gotham to those devices as well huh interesting so um i
5895640	5899880	don't know i'm interested in checking out the lego marvel avengers i'm a little worried that they may
5901720	5907240	i don't know it may not be as robust as like the first game honestly that's what kind of kept me
5907240	5913240	away from lego batman 3 is that it wasn't open world like you know marvel superheroes was i'm
5913800	5918280	more interested in lego batman 2 but i don't really want to pick that up for my playstation
5918280	5926200	3 since i'm using a playstation 4 now um and then they have announced the titles for xbox's uh games
5926200	5934600	of gold for february so in february you'll be able to get uh for xbox one idarb which is kind of a
5934600	5942360	strange sports game that has a ton of integration with uh twitch and twitch chat you can basically
5942360	5948760	troll the people playing the game with um chat comments and uh you'll actually get to play that
5948760	5956840	uh free and i think earlier um it's supposed to be coming out in february i'm not sure when
5956840	5961320	it's exactly launching let's see here now they haven't said when it's launching standalone
5961320	5966360	outside i'm guessing outside of february but uh you'll be able to you know pick it up for free
5967080	5976360	and then also on xbox 360 for the first half of the month they will be giving you um let's see
5977240	5981480	well so i guess it's idarb for the first half of the month i thought that was only on xbox one
5981480	5986520	though i know that the other two titles uh brothers a tale of two sons will be coming out as well and
5986520	5992280	then the second half of the month they're gonna have sniper elite v2 so lots of 505 stuff for
5992280	5997960	this month i guess um so yeah let's see your free titles so go pick them up even if you don't want
5997960	6003880	them because you might someday and it's free uh the folks in chat over at live.vog network.com
6003880	6009240	talking a lot about the lego stuff uh tiger claw says uh lego jurassic world willing uh which will
6009240	6013720	include all four movies so i didn't know that is that going to incorporate the whole lore hopefully
6013960	6017480	well i can't imagine that they'd be able to stretch out one movie's worth of stuff into
6018200	6022600	that i don't know and then fifth dream says uh lego the rocky horror picture show and links me
6022600	6026600	to a youtube i can't do youtubes or broadcasting live but i can only imagine what that must look
6026600	6033000	like i somehow think that is not an official lego brand i don't think but if it was that's hilarious
6033000	6037560	oh my god i can see them doing remember they were trying to push for the lego uh back to the future
6037560	6041400	or something like that i could see i'll be cool well tiger claw says uh the lego games i'd love
6041400	6045800	to see happen one day they need to do lego teenage mutant ninja turtles exactly i was just about to
6045800	6049960	say that because they have the toys for that so why not i would be fun totally be down for that
6050520	6055640	i know my son be down for that too all right uh let's do some more quick news here uh starting
6055640	6063480	off with this a wonder boy spiritual successor monster boy could happen for weu and this is going
6063480	6068920	to be based off a kickstarter uh the kickstarter page for the game says that right now the game is
6068920	6074520	only going to be coming to the playstation 4 and pc but there are some other formats and some folks
6074520	6081720	hoping that weu xbox one would be some of those other formats so monster boy is an all-new adventure
6081720	6086920	uh that is uh created with the creator of the original monster world uh it can be considered
6086920	6091480	an official part of the series but since the trademark is owned by sega they had to change
6091480	6096920	the name new hand-drawn graphics and an improved art style uh new transformations replacing the
6096920	6100680	bear and the hamster uh the game will still have an open world but some of the environments have
6100680	6104600	changed that fit a little more with the monster world universe so if you're curious in checking
6104600	6108920	that out again and you know i i'm sure a lot of folks would love to see that come to weu
6108920	6112200	but it's going to have to make a lot of money so i get over to that kickstarter you can come
6112200	6116360	to at least playstation 4 uh that is on kickstarter if you want to check that out for
6116360	6123800	monster boy i'm sure if you look that up you will find it quickly um cave story 2 it's probably a
6123800	6131240	thing um especially if some of the things revealed on desktops at packs south are to be believed
6131240	6138840	uh during pack south uh i guess uh a folder for cave story 2 was spotted on a laptop from the
6138840	6145320	game publishers but you know i mean duh the cave story 2 is probably a thing this doesn't strike me
6145320	6149880	as something that's particularly surprising but there you go it looks like something that is being
6149880	6154360	worked on or i mean anything could be in that folder though it could just be concepts it could
6154360	6159960	be things that were ultimately cancelled i kind of doubt it but it could be it could be it could
6159960	6165720	be fanfic it could be fanfic it very well could be it could be uh could be things downloaded from
6165720	6172280	deviantart who knows anyhow um speaking of deviantart and uh some of the art people are
6172280	6178520	going to make with this world of warcraft in the latest patch 6.1 is going to be giving out a new
6178600	6186680	item called the s e l f i e camera that's right it's a selfie camera and that's what it does it
6186680	6193080	allows you to have your character take selfies did the gnomes make it um i'm assuming they had
6193080	6200520	to have i don't know who made gnomes gave us disco balls i know it's a trinket that you actually
6200520	6207160	equip on your character um and that's you know i don't see any of the lore behind this but i'm
6207160	6212360	sure it's got to be a gnome thing sure it has to be anyway i'm glad that selfie cameras can
6212360	6217000	be part of world warcraft lore yeah right well i imagine it's going to be the type of thing that
6217000	6224360	people uh do uh machinima use this in machinima it's like a new camera angle for some people
6224360	6227960	but the other thing about the selfie camera is that not only do you take selfies of your
6227960	6232920	character but this is actually kind of funny because you do a mission and you get an upgrade
6232920	6241720	kit that gives you the selfie camera mk2 and now you get filters for your selfies instagram in wow
6241720	6248440	yeah it worked out well for them in grand theft auto 5 so i can't i can't i can't complain filter
6249560	6256200	yeah it's a little it's a it's a little stretching it you know trying to incorporate into lore but
6256200	6261640	whatever i guess it should be noted now it should be noted that also coming in the 6-1 patch for
6261640	6266280	world of warcraft is twitter integration and i think maybe facebook integration but i know
6266280	6270840	just twitter integration where you can tweet you mean spam integration from you can tweet from
6270840	6276760	within world of warcraft so gosh this makes an awful lot of sense because now not only can people
6276760	6282600	post selfies of their real selves through instagram they can post selfies of their fake selves
6283320	6287880	right there in world of war you realize we're a patch away from slash pizza
6287880	6295080	i'm surprised it's not already a thing that's why i don't remember slash slash panda express
6295080	6302920	i think was the thing yes so there it is uh the selfie camera coming to world of warcraft dark
6302920	6311240	sakura well um moving into a different uh genre we'll go into some fighting games um
6312040	6318200	mortal kombat x it is x not 10 right so anyway at least that's how they're going yeah yeah
6318200	6325560	stupid anyway um ermak is the latest roster uh latest person showing up in the roster
6326280	6333080	and um there are uh already videos of them up on the nether realm twitch stream um katana and
6333080	6338280	reptile are also on the character select screen um they're going to be played on the next stream
6338280	6344840	but right now ermak and uh it's going to be out on april 14th don't get it for me for my birthday
6344840	6349800	that clueless gamer stream video was hilarious did you see that the clueless gamer that conan
6349800	6354600	o'brien did with the two two football guys playing mortal kombat and i know football but it was
6354600	6359400	really funny it was really really funny because surely actions surely you've heard of the guy
6359400	6364840	from the seahawks that got up there and was like i'm only here so i won't get fined and he was
6364840	6368120	answering all the questions of the president i'm only here so i won't get fined well he was in the
6368120	6372680	conan o'brien video and he was much more animated like you know you actually got to see like a more
6372680	6376440	personable side of him but what i thought was great is that they were sitting there playing
6376440	6381080	mortal kombat and you know conan says something about like what type of games do you like guys
6381080	6387880	like to play and that same guy who goes mario kart because toad and it's just but i mean and i
6387880	6391160	actually i actually did write a tweet about this because i thought it was very interesting that
6391160	6399880	this obvious mortal kombat x promo video kind of turned into uh mortal kart um mario kart nintendo
6399880	6404360	discussion and just speaks to the power of those games that nintendo makes like the reaction to
6404360	6409720	like some of the the fatalities well even oh my god even my reaction to the fatalities like okay
6409720	6414120	look i love mortal kombat there's always been a place for mortal kombat it's very over the top
6414120	6417720	but you guys know i don't like gore i don't like saw and all this which i know is weird like how
6417720	6422120	do you like mortal kombat but you don't like gore it's really really fake because yeah in the
6422120	6427640	original mortal kombat games it was over the top stupid fake like in mortal kombat 2 okay they
6427640	6433400	slice off the person's head and just a big glob of blood goes you know it's really stupid and fake
6433400	6439240	right but now as i'm watching more and more for this one i'm like okay it's still over the top but
6439240	6445720	it's it's getting a little much like getting the skin cam or the the skeleton where they chop off
6445720	6450360	the front half of the guy's face and the brain falls out and others i'm like this is this is
6450360	6455480	getting to be a bit much i'm not sure about my feelings was it like he sucker punched her in
6455480	6460520	the vagina or something like that that was hilarious you can't do that oh yeah their
6460520	6466120	reaction to that was was it was it was cassie cage did that it was uh cassie cage did the split thing
6466120	6472600	that her dad johnny cage used to do right and she punches that b girl in the she visited her place
6473160	6480200	and it was uh it was like their reaction was like oh fisting in mortal kombat yes yes yes hilarious
6480200	6484600	anyway well how about something a little bit less violent i mean it's still violent but less violent
6484600	6490840	okay um udon um udon has done some fantabulous uh capcom artwork they've done some of the last
6490840	6498200	few of the official uh art books and whatnot and uh some of the comics but they um have a
6498200	6505240	project out right now that's called the uh capcom fighting tribute where they're basically taking
6505240	6511080	fan submissions to go into the book um they've extended the uh deadline until february 9th so
6511080	6516760	that you can go on to uh the udon blog and do your submission but some other people who um have uh
6517400	6523240	contributed to the past ones i mean uh which were the uh street fighter tribute and dark stalkers
6523240	6529560	tribute were like brian leo malley and scott campbell and wendy chew different people you know
6529560	6534760	who tremendous artwork um were in some of the previous editions so if you make it in you would
6534760	6540120	be in good company and you have to put olr somewhere in your artwork yes hide it somewhere
6540120	6548120	in there please hide it make us make us a easter egg and then in more serious news the fcc has
6548120	6555800	raised minimum broadband standards by a whole bunch minimum broadband is now 25 mbps instead
6555800	6563240	of four um and the new minimum upload speed is three from one so that means that basically
6563800	6570200	homes that don't have good broadband are now going to be federally granted better broadband
6570840	6576680	which is funny because uh talking with some of my friends overseas like they're on average like six
6577400	6583240	you know and that's good so we really are spoiled for broadband over here but if we've got the
6583240	6588600	technology and the means to do it why not and it's also that they can't market something as
6588600	6593480	broadband unless it reaches these certain levels right yeah exactly got it because i mean i think
6593480	6602440	now you've got uh at least what 2k on uh certain dial-ups and yeah so uh this is you know it's
6602440	6609160	good news it means that we're gonna have better you know faster internet for more people or playing
6609160	6616920	a you know rock band online let's hope there's a new rock band to play online we'll see all right
6616920	6622200	well let's get to the foogle question of the week uh you take facebook and google plus you slam it
6622200	6633880	together you get foogle each week we like to ask a question of our facebook and google communities
6633880	6638600	and we're going to read some of our favorite answers on the show right now uh we asked a
6638600	6644280	pretty easy question this week because you know obviously you know we're not oblivious to what's
6644280	6648360	going on in the real world there's probably a lot of people listening to the podcast this week and
6648360	6653960	less live because of a particular phenomenon that seems to happen this time of year it's the
6653960	6658920	commercial bowl right everybody's watching the commercials for the puppies right the puppies
6658920	6664600	all playing against each other the katy perry concert all right well anyway look uh so we all
6664600	6669400	know there's a big football game today uh and we're sure you all know about big sports games
6669400	6677720	like madden and fifa but what's your favorite obscure sports game now a lot of things qualify
6677720	6682120	as sports so i purposely let's left this vague because i want to see what people came up with
6682120	6688040	so maybe it's something you see on espn 3 or the ocho or maybe it's a foot basket baseball game
6688040	6692920	that not a lot of people have heard about so what's your favorite non-mainstream sports game
6693640	6699480	so some of the comments in chat ander says i love magic the gathering that was on espn at one point
6699480	6705640	so i guess that counts does magic the gathering count of sports i guess i guess i guess it does
6705640	6709400	whatever you consider have you ever been to a tournament rob there are people who sweat there
6709400	6714600	that's that's true that is true uh critical myth says i wish it'd been a better game
6714600	6719640	but the quidditch ea game from the ps2 era was fun for a little while there you go some harry
6719640	6723640	potter quidditch weren't some people trying to turn that into a real sport at some point like
6723640	6729000	quote i mean like a sport in the real world rules already it's on a foot foot thing yeah where you
6729000	6733400	play it i would think you'd at least play it on roller skates so you can glide it's kind of like
6733640	6737640	with a broom handle between your legs so it just looks like you go around whipping
6737640	6745000	people with your giant broom handle okay maybe this is maybe i just need to keep some thoughts
6745000	6752920	to myself uh mike b replies on facebook saying i would like to see croquet and badminton i'm
6752920	6756840	surprised there's never been a there's got to be a croquet or a badminton game out there somewhere
6756840	6763000	especially badminton come on everybody loves a shuttlecock you know what that's what they're
6763000	6767720	called i want lawn darts the game who in lawn darts game where you you know if you hit somebody
6767720	6771800	you win you uh win like 50 million points for they have a lawn darts game it was in one of
6771800	6775880	these stupid casual games for we were you know those multi-game casual games they have lawn
6775880	6782680	darts in there okay but i want lethal lawn darts all right lethal is that a dream game lethal
6783640	6791080	then that would be i think there were lawn darts in zombies ate my neighbors i think maybe i don't
6791080	6795080	remember you know why lawn darts were banned because of people you know getting poked with them
6796040	6803400	impaled because those are huge francisco you replied and said uh does daytona usa on the
6803400	6812040	sega saturn count do do do do do do do do do anyway uh hitstun says just win jammers count the flying
6812040	6817080	disc game isn't a real life sport but it should be it's great at fighting game events go for broke
6818040	6821480	all right those are some of the answers from facebook let's look at google plus though because

6946360	6950920	guys for participating with the frugal question of the week let's get back to some news loki
6951880	6958760	all right yeah does unit racers count because that i mean i think you'd erasers ought to count
6958760	6968040	that's a great race a great one unicycles anyways um sega sammy is cutting hundreds of jobs
6968600	6974600	they're basically prioritizing on digital games because uh console market isn't working out for
6974600	6982200	them too well but they're going to be cutting or i should say soliciting voluntary retirement
6982200	6989960	for around 300 employees and they're saying um 120 are supposed to be approached by next month
6991160	6999320	and most of the layoffs um include the in i guess uh include the uh san francisco
6999960	7001960	offices in southern california offices
7004680	7009560	this makes me sad first first it was the fact that the sega logo wasn't on that building anymore
7009560	7013320	and it was a zinga logo that went up on that building and now now to hear that sega is no
7013320	7017400	longer going to have a presence at all in san francisco is depressing to say the least
7020760	7027640	i don't know i just think i think the uh sonic's just not working out for them i guess i don't
7028280	7032600	well i don't you know i don't i don't know like there there seems to be some things that sega
7032600	7039720	seems to do pretty well on that um that uh kart racing game the sega all-stars sonic racing that
7039720	7044360	was pretty good it was a competent game i mean it wasn't quite at the level of mario kart but
7044360	7048200	it was a good kind of bandage for that first year of the wii u when there wasn't a mario kart like
7048200	7051880	it was they need to just go back to the day when they're making like dreamcast games because the
7051960	7059320	dreamcast stuff was awesome also like fantasy star online 2 like fantasy star online had a
7059320	7063400	birthday this week in the us anyway i know the japanese release was a little sooner but in the
7063400	7068680	us fantasy star online had a birthday this week and and it made me think how long has fantasy
7068680	7073800	star online 2 been out and then they even have nova on the vita and we just don't even don't
7073800	7077880	even have a lick of a trace of it here in the us i guess they just don't think it's gonna do well
7077880	7082040	and now that this closure is happening it just makes me go well shit if they're gonna focus
7082040	7087720	only on mobile and stuff now we're hosed we're not gonna see it anymore it's very sad maybe
7087720	7092680	they're the next company that's gonna go under uh i hate to think that but doesn't sega also
7092680	7098360	have a big business i mean they're probably that but they have a huge business in um arcade games
7098360	7103640	they run arcades in japan and here don't they yeah i wouldn't want to see them go under them
7103640	7108600	they do the crane games a lot of it's possibly that we just won't see they'll go the way konami
7108600	7114600	whereas yeah they're you know you're gonna see maybe a release or two a year and it's just all
7114600	7119800	gonna be mobile tiles well but at least konami's got pt silent hills if nothing else that's true
7119800	7124600	there's nothing else and he is all metal gear yeah your solid five t is all it will be a good
7124600	7132360	year for them and winning 11 that still cares about that wrong country yes this country doesn't
7132360	7140120	care about that other countries it's important in other countries so all right uh well i'm i
7140120	7146600	don't know this this news makes me very sad and it was i mean for me this was the same day as all
7146600	7151960	the nintendo stuff we were debating earlier so i mean where some of my thought comes from on why
7151960	7157080	i do think game companies should get a cut because when i hear about stuff like this i'm like well
7157080	7162520	maybe yeah i mean if if even if the sega that they got a cut from let's play videos only amounted to
7162520	7168040	like a hundred thousand dollars that could still be like two people's jobs well in san francisco
7168040	7172760	salaries maybe only one person's job but you know it could still help them in keeping some of these
7172760	7178200	that's never how that money's that's never how it's been it's not about keeping someone's job
7178200	7184520	it's you know that's a hundred thousand extra dollars that they could have you know in profit
7184520	7188680	not like oh we're not gonna keep we're gonna keep another person here uh some comments in chat over
7188680	7193800	at live.vog network.com s2100 matt says alien isolation sold like crazy for them recently
7193800	7199080	but that isn't an originally licensed title dungeon buster says sonic boom tanked hard
7199080	7204680	everyone hated it yeah sonic boom didn't look super appealing to me i must say shocking that
7204680	7209880	they took no feedback from anybody and like said hey you know everyone's like you know what those
7209880	7216120	were hog sections in the games before we fucking hated them just give us sonic and they're like
7216120	7222600	hey we're gonna put more of that stuff in there we're gonna make him super tall for no fucking
7222600	7228360	reason all right well uh thanks to some hackers because you know hackers gonna hack uh some
7228360	7233720	hackers took a look at the uh new nintendo 3ds and the new nintendo 3ds xl which coming out here
7233720	7237640	in the states in a couple weeks but uh the japanese ones are already out there right i was talking
7237640	7242280	about my experience playing one on last week's show uh the hackers have found out by looking
7242280	7248360	through these consoles that there is a video decoder that supports h264 why is this important
7248360	7255000	because it's the same video format used to stream wii u content to the gamepad so of course folks
7255000	7262280	are speculating could the new 3ds actually function as a wii u gamepad which is funny
7262280	7266360	because i want to say when the wii u first came out i threw this suggestion out there about the
7266360	7271400	current 3ds but some folks were saying it couldn't handle it the processing power wouldn't be enough
7271400	7276440	well now here we are with the new 3ds that maybe does have the processing power to handle that
7276440	7286840	is this nintendo's way around producing um new uh or or the standalone uh gamepads wii u gamepads
7286840	7291800	so that you can have games that support more than one gamepad because right now games can't really
7291800	7297880	support more than one gamepad but if they made it so that oh well you could use your new 3ds as a
7297880	7302200	as a full functional wii u controller then that would open it up for all these new experiences
7302200	7307560	assuming of course people have new 3ds is available but in a lot of nintendo households
7307560	7312360	they probably do so it wouldn't surprise me to hear that this is the route they're going to go down
7313160	7319880	i don't know why can't i use the gamepad as a 3ds that's a great question and i think that's
7319880	7323960	something you'll probably i mean virtual console i i can't believe it hasn't already happened where
7323960	7329720	ds games are coming out on virtual console at least ds games but i don't know maybe it's still
7329720	7336840	a matter of time we'll see so we'll see what develops with that dark sakura well you know
7336840	7342920	everyone is everyone familiar with the left behind series i roll insert here well um there
7342920	7349720	is a Hawaiian court sided with the securities exchange commission sec against an executive from
7349720	7359720	the publisher left behind games who was caught um doing uh using insider information um for stock
7359720	7369320	trading so basically uh he uh got the got kicked pretty hard for it so basically um the founder
7369720	7375960	this is the same court that also nailed the founder Troy Linden for uh found him liable
7375960	7382440	for 3.6 million in disgorgement interest and penalties um after granting sec's motion for
7382440	7393880	summary judgment so basically uh for being a you know quote christian organization they sure are
7393960	7405400	some greedy bastards mailed that's it all right i'm starting to see if anybody is commenting that
7405400	7411800	over at live.vognetwork.com in our chat room but uh most people still still stuck on the 3ds uh
7411800	7416280	tiger coloss saying it'd be nice if the new 3ds had the ability to broadcast the games on twitch
7416280	7422120	instead of having people send in their old 3ds to get it modded with a 3ds capture device but
7422120	7426600	it sounds like Jamie what you're talking about is more where i say oh these companies should get
7426600	7431000	that extra hundred thousand dollars they can help them save jobs that money would really be used for
7431000	7436280	things you're talking about right like insider stock trading and all that type of crap it just
7436280	7445720	means i just i hate people who are more interested in their own personal greed than in the well-being
7445720	7452360	of other people that's i'm gonna get political with it i'm gonna get political that's a problem
7452360	7459800	with capitalism there has to be some kind of balance in the system that's going to make sure
7459800	7464680	that other people are going to be well taken care of so but you know the thing is that as many
7464680	7470120	people get nailed for this there's more of them getting you know pats on the back from their
7470120	7476360	investors or from the people they've done favors for or you know their government buddies so it's
7476360	7481560	just i'm i'm gonna stop before i go on a tangent it's fine it happened everybody has personal
7481560	7486200	thoughts on things i'm served some may disagree but that's that's why we're the show where every
7486200	7490840	gamer has a voice all right uh a few more stories for you guys before we get to the mailbag logie
7491560	7498520	so he is getting some more seed money uh with the chinese e-commerce company alibaba apparently
7498520	7505080	they've injected 10 million dollars into uh the console and the thought is that they're
7505640	7511720	possibly going to be using the uia software and game library to um add it to their set top box
7512360	7517720	and you may remember that they have that uia everywhere um initiative that they started off
7517720	7521880	with the mad cats mojo console which actually i haven't really heard too much about that console
7521880	7527640	since it's i'm pretty sure that's out already i wonder how that works with the mojo and if it
7527640	7535800	works well it'd be interesting to see um julie erman didn't confirm that but apparently it's
7535800	7541160	been reported by the wall street journal and uh basically you know they had all they've confirmed
7541160	7546680	is that they've been working with other partners to bring their platform and games to devices um
7546680	7557480	you know starting with the mad cats um device here in the u.s and um zao mi in china so i don't
7557960	7562760	it's interesting i keep forgetting about the uya yeah i was like i was gonna ask like so what's the
7562760	7567960	uya been up to for the past years because fuck if i know i mean it seems like there's still you know
7567960	7571800	when i guess like stuff on there but yeah when i go to some of the trade shows like at e3 last
7571800	7577160	year at the indie cave booth you know it definitely is there's a lot of indie support for uya but the
7577160	7583480	thing is a lot of the stuff that's on uya i feel like is still available on steam so as somebody
7583480	7588520	who already owns a pc and does a lot of gaming there i don't always see the need to get the uya
7588520	7593240	separately but this is very interesting if uya is going to try and carve a niche for itself maybe in
7593240	7597960	foreign markets where you know especially in a place like china a lot of these other consoles
7597960	7603400	don't do business in china or i think wasn't the xbox one like supposed to like just come out in
7603400	7607960	china but then it got pushed back and you know but like they're trying to kind of break through
7607960	7612280	so it'd be very interesting if the uya can maybe carve a niche for that and being you know because
7612280	7617160	china's a pretty big place if you weren't aware it would be interesting to see if maybe uya can
7617160	7622920	make money in those markets that are tapped for some of the other big players it would be
7622920	7626920	interesting to see i i'm kind of curious to do some more research on that mojo console just
7626920	7632440	because i know that's out already and one of the cool things about it was you're able to map like
7632440	7638200	controls using the controller for games that didn't necessarily support controllers if that
7638200	7642920	makes sense yeah um so i'm kind of curious to see it looks like that they just basically run the
7642920	7649000	uya games through an app on the actual device plus you know can do just android games as well so
7650120	7656760	i'd be curious to see how that how that looks or and also to see if the games on that console play
7656760	7662040	better than say on the uya itself because uya itself isn't that powerful so it'd be kind of
7662040	7668120	interesting to see you know how that would differ and besides that looks like i like their controller
7668120	7676040	a lot better all right well um moving on to a story about final fantasy 15. i know a lot of
7676040	7679960	you guys are looking forward to final fantasy 15 of course we don't know the date for that yet but
7679960	7686760	we do know a demo is coming out with final fantasy type 0 hd which is due on the playstation 4 but
7686760	7690440	even though we're being promised that we're going to get this final fantasy 15 demo with
7690440	7696760	final fantasy type 0 there is a possibility that the final fantasy 15 demo may not make it in time
7696760	7702200	for final fantasy type 0 hd and where this is coming from is from an ask me anything that was
7702200	7707160	done this week uh the director behind type 0 hajima tabata actually went on reddit to do one
7707160	7711560	of these ask me anythings and one of the things he said about the final fantasy 15 demo he didn't
7711560	7716920	want to share you know he wanted to focus on type 0 and getting people to pre-order it but uh as far
7716920	7721800	as the final fantasy 15 demo went he said the team is doing its best but they're still optimizing the
7721800	7728760	game it may not make type 0's hd launch a few details were given out though that you will be
7728760	7735000	able to jump in the game and cindy's identity will be revealed in or is it cindy or sydney i
7735000	7740920	thought it was sydney because it's a female cid now in 15 or i guess we're gonna get that answer
7740920	7747800	if uh you know perhaps if uh cindy or sydney or whatever her name is is the actual incarnation
7747800	7752040	of syd in the game or maybe it's like syd's daughter or something who knows there's a
7752040	7755960	million things that could be going on uh we'll find that out in the final fantasy 15 demo
7755960	7761000	apparently whenever that comes out it may not actually come out i would imagine what would
7761000	7767800	happen if it doesn't make type 0's release is that you'll get a code for the demo that will download
7767800	7773880	whenever they do release it a couple weeks later but it may not be the same time now keep in mind
7773880	7778360	this isn't the first game to ever have this happen for example a game like crackdown way
7778360	7783240	back on the xbox 360 yes the original crackdown on 360 one of the big reasons why people bought
7783240	7788440	that game was because of the halo 3 demo right but the halo 3 demo was not the exact same time
7788440	7793480	as crackdown came out it was well after you know it was a couple months after so it's not like
7793480	7797960	there isn't precedent for this ever happening before so i want to say that they said originally
7797960	7802200	that it wasn't going to be at the same time maybe a later date but you just get access to it i think
7802200	7807560	a lot of people might be assuming that i don't know i was going to pick up type 0 anyway the
7807560	7813080	final fantasy 15 demo is just kind of icing on the cake in my opinion but we'll see we'll see if uh
7813080	7817800	it impacts sales or what have you meanwhile we're going to go to the mailbag you guys send us emails
7817800	7822200	every week at participate at orange lounge radio.com and dark soccer is going to dive into
7822200	7828360	the mailbag head first and uh find some emails from y'all that are worth going but first this
7828360	7836040	time but first cannonball cannonball yep so we actually have a bunch of emails from uh robert m
7836040	7839560	all right i i hope they're all as short as the first one so i'll go look at them
7840520	7845240	after hearing the raging spazzinators advice i plan to call sony support next week i'm writing
7845240	7850120	this wednesday 1 28 instead of repairs or replacement work this week has been pretty
7850120	7854600	busy and i haven't actually had any of the issues i described for a while but have no intention of
7854600	7859320	taking it for granted is there any way to back up key save data onto physical media just to be
7859320	7865480	on the safe side before we go further i'm going to see if he figured it out for himself but i
7865480	7870760	just want to say for those that aren't aware if you didn't hear last week's show um in a nutshell
7870760	7876120	i'm cutting corners but this guy was worried that his playstation was failing and he was wondering
7876120	7881080	should he buy a new playstation 3 like what should we what should he do and a lot of us were saying
7881080	7888040	just call sony and see you know weigh your options if nothing else indeed indeed so next email from
7888040	7896040	robert m addenda since my last email i did contact sony via live chat today sunday about 1 30 to 1 45
7896040	7900280	pm the text says impression was that the battery on the motherboard depleting and he gave me the
7900280	7905000	information setting up a repair ticket i may call the number later tonight or during the next work
7905000	7909320	week i'll let you know if i try it before the show thanks again robert m he must have tried
7909320	7914520	it before the show because we have another email i feel like i'm reading somebody's live journal
7915560	7921880	whelp dear live journal whelp phone support is not available on sunday and now about 6 pm
7921880	7929160	my console is giving a 807 10092 error when i try to go online oh i just synced my trophies a few
7929160	7933480	hours ago and everything else is getting wi-fi i wrote down all my info we'll try to call tomorrow
7934120	7939240	um as for backing up your stuff i have no idea because i've never actually tried to copy any
7939240	7945960	of my stuff off my ps3 yeah you can you just have a usb drive that's formatted fat32 yep answered
7946920	7952600	so now i'm going to read an email that is not from robert m but good luck robert i'm sure uh
7952600	7957000	hopefully we'll probably have another email if it's just like a battery like a bios battery that's
7957000	7963320	on going dead on i mean that would be fucking cheap you just have to rip your system apart but
7963320	7969000	that would be fucking cheap to replace yeah so ready they'll charge you 200 for it yep

8018680	8023240	thank you very much for writing that email seriously because um without going into this
8023240	8028520	too much i was having a bit of a rough week earlier this week and i got some kind of bad news
8028520	8032600	midweek and it's kind of one of those things where it's like eh we'll probably get around it we'll
8032600	8037960	get over it but it's it's one of those things where it was a hump and not a good kind yeah it
8037960	8043880	was it was the not good kind of hump and sometimes you know there's a lot of i don't know i don't
8043880	8049640	know how to phrase it but sometimes i feel like this show has been around for so long and yet
8049640	8053960	for some people it's just not good enough what we're doing what we're doing is just not
8053960	8059640	legitimate enough and i'm not sure what legitimate even is but apparently oh and i know what you're
8059640	8063960	talking about on certain days of the week we're not it you know type of thing and it's just it
8063960	8067960	depends what you're trying to do as far as legitimacy god it's so frustrating sometimes
8067960	8073880	it's like you know i'm just trying to create a good show here but whatever and honestly like
8073880	8079240	not even an hour after i was just kind of dealing with all those frustrations i peek in the mailbag
8079240	8083080	just to get an idea of what's going to be coming for the show a little early and i actually saw
8083080	8089400	your email and it was a really great reminder of like you know what to hell with everybody else

8310360	8317560	of bullshit going on in the world i just want to say just people for the few people of you who
8317560	8323720	restore my faith in humanity on a daily basis by doing nice things by adopting puppies and kittens
8323720	8332680	and you know leaving you know paying somebody's playing you know paying somebody's tab at dinner
8332680	8337800	for a complete stranger doing nice things we need more of you people in the world and fewer of the
8337800	8343240	assholes that are only looking to line their own pockets or looking out for number one if if i i
8343240	8352040	encourage people this if you vote if you act in you know the public interest anything that you do
8353480	8357800	every so often just look beyond yourself and ask yourself if someone else is going to benefit from
8357800	8365480	it too that's all i ask and then actually benefit other people all right now loki um i guess just
8366280	8370040	fb my cat you're not a programmer cat you don't know what the fuck you're doing
8370040	8371080	so i'm messing with my shit
8373720	8379480	minda does that too um especially when she tries to program with her ass i mean come on
8379480	8385080	that takes talent you can't do that minda's trying to guide dan by headbutting his mouse hand
8388120	8391240	uh the cat should just get together and see if they take over the world
8392040	8395800	i i don't really have a good fu of the week i do have a lot of things i want to say i
8395800	8402440	just don't want to say them publicly so i'll just say an fu to um fuckery that's i'm gonna
8402440	8409160	just give a general fu to fuck fucking fuckery that's that's my fu of the week very creative no
8409960	8413800	all right uh just a couple more stories for you guys then we'll get to the skype line at
8413800	8419640	1877 game olr or a username on skype orange lounge radio but not yet we have a few more stories first
8419640	8428600	all right so um xbox they've done pretty well i guess for uh the fourth quarter so it's kind
8428600	8435800	of confusing so quarter two of their 2015 financial year uh which i guess just recently
8435800	8444600	ended on december 31st they've um sold 6.6 million consoles during that time probably because they
8444600	8449560	did that nice no price break and threw games in there that's how you do it you know and they'll
8450360	8456360	because people didn't care about connect unfortunately um basically you know their comment
8456360	8462920	was our sales engagement worldwide continues to focus on helping uh customers and partners
8462920	8467240	transition to the cloud navigable i'm sorry i'm already losing interest in what this guy's saying
8467240	8473080	so i'm going to stop there um and then of course you know not to be outdone by that
8473960	8482680	uh 1.84 million new 3ds units have shipped in 2014 i'm assuming this is just the japan since
8483320	8489880	obviously the new 3ds isn't out here yet um and the wii u is up to 9.2 million units
8490520	8496440	so probably think well the new 3ds is because people need their new shit and well the wii u
8496440	8501080	just because it's some really good first party software for this year so hopefully
8501160	8509560	keep that momentum going but yeah all right we'll see uh i'm very curious to see what nintendo's
8509560	8514360	e3 looks like that's for sure all i need to see is a new excite truck a new excite truck
8514360	8521160	fuck this might be waiting a while exactly exactly if you gotta if i want to excite you know truck
8521160	8526120	sequel i gotta make it myself all right well uh getting into one more story here and i felt this
8526120	8532680	was a very good note to end on tonight and speaking about like family and listeners and
8532680	8537400	you guys that motivate us to do great things every week some of you guys are out there doing great
8537400	8542040	things in the gaming community and um i think this is really cool because uh this guy i don't
8542040	8546600	know if this guy still listens to the show but i know he has in the past and you guys may not have
8546600	8551320	actually known this if you've heard about this guy in the media but um he was somebody he follows me
8551320	8556360	on twitter okay so i know he listened to olr at one point and i know you send emails and stuff so
8556360	8561160	i know i've heard this guy before i don't know if he still listens but if you are still listening
8561160	8568920	to the show kevin ddr a big congrats to you because i don't know if you know kevin ddr but
8568920	8573320	even though ddr is in his name which of course we all love ddr kevin ddr is very famous now for
8573320	8577640	tetris he does he was in the awesome games done quick and he did the whole tetris thing that was
8577640	8583080	really blowing a lot of people away right well he was streaming on twitch and he actually reached
8583080	8590440	a very very difficult to achieve grandmaster ranking in arika's tetris the grandmaster three
8590440	8596200	this makes him the first player in north america to actually achieve this rank and because it was
8596200	8601480	streaming when it was happened you can actually see a little stream of it online uh so in order
8601480	8607000	to get the grandmaster promotional exam which yes this is all built into a tetris game here's what
8607000	8612760	you have to do you have to get a gm rank during the majority of your last several master mode
8612760	8617960	playthroughs this means you have to have the maximum drop speed level by clearing several
8617960	8623240	dozen lines in under seven minutes and then you have to play a minute's worth of tetris on a
8623240	8629960	credit scroll with pieces that turn invisible while they are dropping apparently there's five
8629960	8636360	people hidden yeah it's crazy there's five players in japan that have achieved this rank and now kevin
8636360	8642200	ddr has uh done this in the us so congrats if you are out there somewhere listening or what have you
8642200	8648280	um big congrats to you on that feed that's amazing and what's also amazing about this i've got to say
8648920	8655560	is that between kevin's efforts at awesome games done quick and what he did this week on twitch
8655560	8662120	more people are talking about this tetris the grandmaster game than are talking about ubisoft's
8662120	8669000	buggy tetris game that was just released on playstation 4 like three weeks ago it seems like
8669000	8674840	i don't want to say no one curr but doesn't it seem like we're getting the less exciting version
8674840	8681000	of tetris here what is what is what is up with that where you know we've got this exciting
8681000	8686040	competition going on over here yet the one they release here in the states is kind of it's it's
8686040	8691320	got some frame skip going on it's not it's not because it's casuals over here it's dirty filthy
8691320	8701480	casuals marissa congusto in chat says this sounds like tetris snm i i guess i don't know
8702360	8705560	kevin will have to let us know if he's out there listening somewhere although he's probably a
8705560	8709640	little busy playing tetris although i i would think he deserves a break at this point i don't
8709640	8716040	know so there you go uh a good note to end on there uh something that uh people i remember
8716040	8720440	listening to the show from a long time ago are out there doing it's fantastic uh we are going
8720440	8725480	to open up the skype line you guys uh i gotta get on the right account though so while i open
8725480	8731800	up the skype line over at 1877 game olr or a username on skype orange lounge radio uh
8731800	8735320	loki do you happen to have any last minute stories for us tonight yeah as i alluded to
8735320	8740200	earlier in the show when we were talking about nintendo and stuff like that and how you know
8740200	8747800	people can abuse copyright claims tech lands who just released dying light is doing such a thing
8748440	8756760	they are filing dmca claims against videos they're showing mods for the game and not even
8756760	8765880	necessarily like cheating mods but like there was a mod for example that um what was it they had
8765880	8772840	there was one it was just like a like a small it was like a one text file mod that they had
8773800	8778840	um but basically yeah they're slapping claims against anybody that's putting up mods in the
8778840	8784680	game they're saying because um you know it affects single player as well as multiplayer
8786200	8790440	i don't know i think it's kind of lame well if it affects single player i mean
8791320	8797400	well who cares about single player um you know because whatever well is it oh is it just if it's
8797480	8801320	your own single player then but does it affect other people's single players
8802440	8807080	no it's just i think your own single player game they're talking about gotcha i was trying to
8807080	8817240	remember what it was that was they were modding it was um what was it here oh it was a mod to
8817240	8824760	remove film grain from the game a film grain like filter that's on the actual thing so there was a
8824760	8833640	mod to remove that and they were dmca you know it's so stupid that they would do that it's like
8833640	8840920	who gives a shit it's fucking film green oh my god that ruined the game all right uh let's get
8840920	8845560	to the phones we got somebody calling in here uh again 1877 game olr or username on skype
8845560	8848600	orange launch radio but we do have a call on the line hi you're on orange launch radio who's this
8849320	8854760	hi this is regina here hey regina what's on your mind uh not no not a whole lot uh
8855640	8861560	uh one question and the one comment uh it serves uh the question since it's the
8862360	8869240	quickest part of the call um do you know if uh the three of you or maybe even bob you
8869240	8877160	are planning on really doing anything with uh uh bob's uh you know sting group uh like in terms of
8877160	8884360	like doing like events or organized uh play gates or wherever you want to call them uh i know it's
8884360	8891240	been a while since we uh anything has really been done with the group yeah you know the
8891240	8896680	participation for those events wasn't as good as we had hoped it was uh very small for some of the
8896680	8901640	outings that we did um but i think if we can get people enthusiastic about a certain game or
8901640	8906360	something i think we're more than open to that idea um excited even and maybe we just have to
8906360	8910120	mix it up a little bit i mean now especially in the day and age where you can do streaming
8910120	8915240	maybe bobby or myself or jamie or hell anybody on the network with this capability there's no reason
8915240	8919000	they can't do it it could even be you know somebody like brad or john from critical myth one of our
8919000	8924040	other shows um electric sisterhood loved it love to see them get involved too could be uh like
8924040	8929960	streaming a game and then other vog people can actually like join in on that same game or
8929960	8933720	something and and like maybe like do like a group live streaming event or something i think it might
8933720	8939560	just be about doing something a little more to kind of stir up the interest i don't know plus
8939560	8945400	it's also hard finding the right game because you have to find games that people own unless you can
8945400	8949800	find just the right free to play game but then you know is it something that's going to be a big
8949800	8954760	download what is that going to entail you know sometimes it's about finding that right game that's
8954760	8959320	why it's good to do games that a lot of people have like i don't know minecraft a lot of people
8959320	8965480	have that game um mario kart 8 uh did a little tournament on there it had pretty good participation
8965480	8971160	so i think a lot of times just about finding that right mix so yeah i can definitely see the point
8971160	8978120	now my original line of thought was you know i could be way off the mark here but you know if
8978120	8985400	uh you know the vog administrators you know a group of administrators you know really you know
8985480	8991000	for lack of a better term pick things up with the steam group and start organizing stuff
8991000	8999800	now maybe they would possibly draw new members into the group and then hopefully in turn draw
8999800	9009400	traffic to the vog sites and i'm i'm lying about that you and bobby and walking dark sakura who
9009400	9016040	would love to see uh new listeners know new registered members to the site so and so forth
9016040	9021400	i'm i'm all for bringing more cool minded people you know people that will respect the number one
9021400	9026840	rule is uh don't be a dick when you game online i'm all for bringing more people in that that uh
9026840	9030920	like-minded people to do that so whatever we have to do to get visibility i'm i'm willing to try
9030920	9034760	ideas you know if you don't try it you'll never know if something will work or not so i'm willing
9034760	9038520	to i'm willing to give the vog game night another go so we'll uh we'll have to talk about that
9038520	9047080	offline and and uh figure out a good good plan all right now um in regards to robert m's email
9047080	9055000	um i heard that he posted a question i didn't hear the full question uh he asked about backing up
9055000	9060600	stuff right yeah he wanted to see if you could actually back things up from the ps3 uh like
9060600	9065240	your i guess your save data and things like that which you should be able to do to a uh correctly
9065240	9069000	formatted hard drive because i've actually done that myself with uh one of my portable drives
9069800	9078920	yeah yeah um i the only thing i ever really backed up personally was uh game saves you know you can
9078920	9083960	back those up to the cloud or if you have like a external hard drive the flashlight you can back
9083960	9089080	up your you saves that way oh i totally forgot that's right if this guy's a playstation plus he
9089080	9094760	can uh he can back up all his game saves into the cloud really easy yeah the only ones that
9094760	9101240	you're more or less forced to back up to the cloud as opposed to um a local drive would be
9101240	9106440	the ones that are copy protected those ones you have to do on the cloud uh but the rest of them
9106440	9112200	if you might have like a local copy copy of those you can put those on flash drive or whatever
9112200	9118440	like uh loki mentioned you know to use the local driver you have to be you know for me
9118440	9123800	in fact 32 right that's right but there's um there's more instructions online on how to do
9123800	9128360	that but um definitely if you if this uh guy doesn't have playstation plus uh he should go
9128360	9133720	get his free one from the lawsuit and uh he can back up that data into the cloud that would be a
9133720	9141800	good idea so yeah and um just so that i don't necessarily hog up a whole lot of time not like
9141800	9149720	tonight but in the future answering questions or whatnot but if robert um has any questions that
9149960	9156840	he thinks i may be able to help him with he can easily contact me personally through skype uh
9157560	9163640	my guys you know skype gave on their spazzing in towards yeah spazzing in their period psp
9164360	9171480	um you know uh as long as i'm online you know he's more than welcome to call me and you know i
9171480	9178600	ask ask way so there you go our our own as kuba jp in chat says our sony tech support reggie

9213560	9218040	i don't commentate or do anything over it i just you can watch me playing the game but i don't do
9218040	9221960	any commentary but if i'm on twitch then i'm usually doing commentary webcam and all that
9221960	9227160	stuff but i like being able to peek at games just to see like what the games look like in motion
9227160	9230520	because you know trailers only show you so much screenshots only show you so much but actually
9230520	9237080	watching somebody kind of playing the game goes a long way a long way in my opinion one eight seven
9237080	9241720	seven game olr username on skype orange lounge radio we're going to uh try to keep it open a
9241720	9246120	little bit here to try and get some more calls um meanwhile loki any other last minute stories that

9307720	9314280	that at least that came in today sometimes we get tagged in in posts that are unrelated here
9314280	9319080	i was getting a few tweets about rockage as kind of like a follow-up to last week's interview
9319080	9322680	and some of the bands actually reached out to say hello which i thought was really cool
9322680	9326440	and so some folks were asking like you know are you going to be at rockage did you figure that out
9326440	9330760	so yes if you were listening to last week's show and you heard our interview all about rockage
9330760	9336680	san jose i will be there for sure saturday for sure i can't be there sunday because i got to get
9336680	9342440	back and do olr right guys so i'm going to be here back here on sunday i'm trying right now to see if
9342440	9346920	i can find a place to stay in the bay area if i have a friend over there that might let me crash
9346920	9352440	with them so i could stay friday night um so that way because i'm too cheap for a hotel and that way
9352440	9356600	i can drive down and maybe get a little bit of the concert friday night after work uh we'll see what
9356600	9360200	happens all right well we do have the phones lighting up with some more calls wow all of a
9360200	9363400	sudden lit up with some more calls let's get to it hi you're on orange launch radio who's this
9363400	9368280	it's shane hey shane i haven't heard from you in a while what's up well you guys sound bored so i
9368280	9374600	thought i'd give you a call what are you bored too yes i'm super bored hey we're all bored why
9374600	9379720	don't we talk about the weather it's dark out there's no weather that i can see but it might
9379720	9384760	be foggy though so that's awesome it might be what do you think of the uh x right power ranger
9385560	9392920	stabbing oh why you gotta why you gotta go to a downer um i don't have like a real opinion on it
9392920	9400200	because it sounds like it may be self-defense and that's fine i'm more like kind of laughing about
9400200	9406040	how all these outlets that i keep reading the story on make up the most random stories about
9406040	9411640	him like apparently he was the red ranger in the animated samurai power rangers which
9411640	9419000	there wasn't an animated samurai power ranger uh season and so that's funny and then one person
9419000	9424360	or not one person one site linked to him and showed him as the red samurai ranger and then
9424360	9429080	put a clip of him up and it didn't even have him in it it had the red samurai ranger which he was
9429080	9437240	not so i don't know i think he is innocent proven guilty so we'll see i am so lost right now and
9437240	9441000	all this power ranger stuff you're talking about i wish we could just talk about the new american
9441000	9446280	one because it's so good i've watched it six times now since it debuted this yeah but this is you
9446280	9451320	you have to send that my way because i won't so i'll know what you're talking about because i
9451320	9455960	talk about it a lot all the time this is also you that we're talking about so you're biased
9455960	9460200	inherently no they told me the story and it sounded like it's pretty cool because it had
9460200	9464920	dinosaurs and shit all right well it is a video game show are there any video games you've been
9464920	9470520	playing lately shane um i've been playing gravely default a lot lately um and i feel bad because
9470520	9475800	it didn't make like my top three list or whatever um of last year and that game came out last year
9475800	9481000	but i never beat it and now that i've picked it back up again um it's really really good i'm
9481000	9487640	loving it i'm sad that i somehow just kind of skipped over it and let it go to uh you know
9488680	9493880	video game like i don't know what do you want to call like crematorium or something because
9493880	9498680	it just sits over there waiting to die what burned what got you in the mood to play go
9498680	9507240	back and visit bravely default um fancy explorers oh oh actually um since you brought that up uh
9507240	9510920	you know last week i talked about my thoughts you know you were good enough to bring your new three
9511400	9516760	that you bought you bought a japanese new 3ds and you brought it over so i could check it out
9516760	9520920	so i talked about my own thoughts last week but we didn't really get your thoughts um first off
9520920	9530040	why did you decide to import a japanese new 3ds so one reason let's go with the let's go with the uh
9530040	9536600	doesn't make me sound incredibly crazy reason um they announced in the last nintendo direct
9536600	9544280	a new rhythm heaven game for japan nothing for us and i've been wanting to play final fantasy
9544280	9550600	explorers as well so i figured that was a good enough reason those two reasons together good
9550600	9556360	enough and there's always like japanese games i want to play that i you know either don't get a
9556360	9560760	chance to or by the time they come out here i already forgot about them so because i have like
9560760	9567960	a really really short attention span um the bigger reason is probably because they did not bring out
9567960	9573800	or they are not bringing out the system in blue so i was able to get it in blue i knew i knew when
9573800	9577800	you said there was a crazy reason i was like it's because he got a blue one they don't have one yes
9577800	9582600	it's a very pretty blue so i'm okay with it what's like the color of my car it's a very nice blue
9582600	9589240	what if they announce at e3 that there will be a blue 3ds in the holidays oh well i already got
9589240	9593800	one i don't need a different well unless it's a different shade so considering that most people
9593800	9597640	haven't paid the premium to import a system from japan so most people haven't got their hands on it
9597640	9603160	yet oh and it's not also i've had japanese systems before so this is like nothing incredibly new for
9603160	9608200	me what are what should people know about the new 3ds is it worth it what are your thoughts on it
9608200	9614280	i think it's worth it i think it feels sturdier i love the head tracking um the little nub of a
9614280	9619720	c-stick is great i think it's really comfortable that i didn't like that at all yeah you're weird
9619720	9626280	um the shoulder buttons having four there is kind of cool too i don't find it cumbersome to pick
9626280	9631480	you know like put my fingers on there and find the right shoulder buttons um i think it's just
9631480	9639160	a nicer system that is the system yeah and the japanese one i never realized how much we were
9639160	9645960	missing out on like the e-shop until i got this system it's not even it's not even fair like it's
9645960	9650840	night and day they have so many good things on their e-shop i'm i'm a little jealous in that
9650840	9655800	regard but i still i don't know i kind of don't think the new 3ds is really worth it if you just
9655800	9660680	bought a 3ds but maybe you know if you've been holding out or whatever and you're still rocking
9660680	9665960	a regular ds or a dsi or something maybe now's the time to upgrade the new 3ds is definitely a
9665960	9671640	good replacement for that but yeah if you got one like over the holidays um i wouldn't say probably
9671640	9676840	you need to upgrade until a game comes out that says oh you can't use it on your 3ds you have to
9676840	9680600	have the new 3ds just waiting for that real quick before i let you go what did you think i don't
9680600	9685640	know if you heard the story earlier about the rumor that the video encryption technology in
9685640	9692360	the new 3ds is the same as what the wii u uses to stream to the wii u gamepad so folks are speculating
9692360	9696840	that the new 3ds will in fact be able to serve at some point as a wii u gamepad what do you
9696840	9705000	think of that um that makes sense to me i mean it's got the nfc chip inside too which you know
9705000	9712840	for those stupid stupid amiibos um they do that on the wii u controller as well so it i thought
9712840	9718040	it was going to happen earlier than this but yeah it's totally gonna work with the wii u i don't see
9718040	9723560	it not working with the wii u not a fan of the amiibo huh no i want like four of them but they're
9723560	9729560	all two of them wait one of them is out now another one comes out like in a few weeks the
9729560	9735160	one that's out now is chic and i really would like that but i'm not waking up at four in the morning
9735160	9739800	the morning of to wait for a store to open i'd rather do that for something i care about more
9739800	9744600	yeah not some little dumb toy i'm not getting back into something like skylanders and that's
9744600	9750040	all this is but somehow worse all right well shane i should let you go so we can try to take
9750040	9754600	a few more calls but thanks for calling in no problem goodbye hope you're less bored now nope
9755400	9761640	bye what a jerk all right 1877 game olr our username on skype orange lounge radio i've just
9761640	9766920	had a good idea rob it's a better idea than pinkberry what cheesecake factory oh god i
9766920	9772040	wish you know how many calories are in a slice of cheesecake so we can split one i don't know i
9772040	9777880	don't know he's making dinner too i'd want to order food jamie's making all these post-show
9777880	9783400	plans you guys yeah i am she's ready to go no i'm not i'm writing fan fiction meanwhile shane i
9783400	9787720	wrote dragon age fan fiction the entire time you're on the phone just saying the phones are
9787720	9792680	open by the way 1877 game olr or a username on skype orange lounge radio and i should mention
9792680	9797880	alan is cooking right now and it smells great here i'm freaking hungry it does smell good you
9797880	9804440	can probably have a bite or two not if it's carby yeah it might be you you says the one who wants
9804440	9808840	to go out for cheesecake they have low carb cheesecake oh my god it's amazing low carb beans
9808840	9813240	still a lot of carb just not as much carb as the other one because if i go to i have to have that
9813240	9817400	red velvet then that's like the very the absolute worst thing you could possibly order on that whole
9817400	9821000	fucking menu i'll help you eat a bite of it yeah we'll see all right let's get to the phones hi
9821000	9825960	you're on orange launch radio who's this hello oh my god is that marissa yes
9828440	9831560	how you doing i have nothing for doctor to say i just wanted to say hi
9833240	9838920	oh that's okay for you for you i will stop writing my fanfic you can you you can call in
9838920	9843640	and talk about whatever the hell you want you want to talk about the weather you you could probably
9843640	9847480	even get away with talking about the super bowl on the show and we wouldn't care gasp
9847480	9853400	okay but i still say that one of these days we're gonna have to do a spin-off on the voice
9853400	9858360	of games network to have robin morris's giggle time yes let's do it it's the voice it's the
9858360	9862920	voice of geeks network but that's okay the voice of giggling i'm sorry i bring my damage i'm
9862920	9867000	actually blonde don't tell anybody that's all right that's right well you know it was it
9867000	9870520	originally well i i don't know how far it was i think some people know this by now i think it's
9870520	9874680	because originally it was going to be the voice of games network so you might have heard about it
9874680	9879880	when we were first planning it but then we we thought that wasn't inclusive enough of
9879880	9884840	all the shows we wanted to represent so we we expanded a little so there you go the definition
9884840	9888280	of vog changed before it launched i didn't remember that conversation a long time ago
9888280	9895400	but i'm also just blonde but thank you for trying to bail me out i really appreciate it i fucking
9895400	9904360	tried marissa i did for you i'm only here so i won't get fined well uh i'm sorry about uh
9905000	9909400	you know a backstory i tried to get a guest on but they had a tragedy but if you're interested
9909400	9914760	i know we've gone back and forth but i got my vo friends and i know they would love to call in
9914760	9918760	if you're interested and i can uh i know we've talked back and forth about it casually but if
9918760	9922760	you're interested i'd be happy to have a whole bunch of fun people call in i think the listeners
9922760	9927000	would love to hear from some more people in the vo especially um you know some of the the favorite
9927000	9931640	voices from some of the video games they play or i find i here's the thing with voice actors that
9931640	9937800	i think people like fucking love to find out is that you know obviously the voice actors that are
9937800	9944040	out there take on a lot of different projects so to find out that like somebody who did this voice
9944040	9951000	in this game is also this voice or this cartoon character from some beloved 80s or 90s cartoon
9951000	9955720	is like a total trip i think i think people love to like see those connections at least i
9955720	9962280	do right maybe it is it is an amazingly um small world like um trying to give an example of one of
9962280	9967160	my friends it's kind of obscure but in dishonored one of the uh you know the the background i forget
9967160	9973000	the term for it um on the uh the propaganda that you hear that's guy named greg burger
9973000	9977080	he's also eeyore and orson on garfield and friends who you're talking about yeah the
9977080	9981400	phone always surprises me is on the flip side like he was one of the raid ants you know right
9981400	9987240	like you know or rob paulson everybody knows who he is you find out what they've done commercials
9987240	9992520	he's your friendly hannah dealer you know so that's always it really surprises me because
9992520	9997000	you can see people and then like you know like i have an ear for jim cummings chris was playing um
9997880	10001720	at any any video game like i'll even like be listening to music and i go jim cummings
10002280	10008760	but uh um but when you hear the like the the voices that ambient stuff you just hear every
10008760	10013160	day too that can always be really shocking and they're all on screen all the time so they're
10013160	10020120	always really happy to talk to people no my gosh i just well i mean hell we talk to gamers we talk
10020120	10025640	i mean as long as people have some type of passion for video games whether it be the part of creating
10025640	10029400	them or the part of playing them you know it's a show where every gamer has a voice so i think we
10029480	10033560	want to i think we want to hear from lots of voice actors who help make those games um i know we're
10033560	10037560	going to be probably getting some bands on thanks to some of the connections i'm hopefully making
10037560	10041560	next week and you know some of the other stuff we've got brewing behind the scenes i i am all
10041560	10046280	for more interviews and talking to more people i think you guys like hearing them yeah yeah i
10046280	10049720	think you guys like hearing the interviews so i have a friend too that can also talk about he
10049720	10057000	does a lot of mocap and so that means that you're no longer allowed to be ugly so i'm like oh i
10057000	10061960	don't have a figure of a supermodel now this mocap stuff shit well now a lot a lot of that
10061960	10067400	mocap stuff is like you wear that skin tight suit that has all the balls on it and the the mocap
10067400	10073960	stuff captures the balls but that's what it does yeah that's what he does yeah yeah i was having
10073960	10079480	a friend tell me about uh some some people that he knew that were mocapped for a sports game
10079480	10083400	uh for some of the not not one of the athletes but some of the background people and that was
10083480	10088520	the whole process that went through kind of neat so yeah it is crazy to watch the behind the scenes
10088520	10093960	of that all right well marissa um i look forward to trying to get some some peeps from your
10093960	10098120	community on the show so we'll try to make that work in the coming weeks but uh for now i'm gonna

10262680	10271400	though it's the shield helicarrier in legos oh god but it's huge my son would love that thing
10272280	10277400	he would eat that up i need to get more lego stuff i keep saying that i want to build like
10277400	10281560	eight bit characters out of legos because it's not that hard we have an extra delorean i think
10281560	10286360	do you really yeah dan would probably sell it to you for i'd recommend checking out there by my
10286360	10291160	house there's a lego a store that sells lego stuff it's a lego shop and they sell bricks like an
10291160	10297320	official one no oh it's like just some guy's shop that's pretty good the official one is is
10297320	10301560	expensive so if i can get like secondhand legos that would be awesome i know you can like order
10301560	10306760	the custom stuff online like you can build the lego and then have them ship you whatever legos
10306760	10311240	it is to build your virtual creation that would be only super expensive yeah i know right ten
10311240	10316600	gallons of legos at my house yeah all right uh anyway i guess it's gonna do it for another
10316600	10321960	episode of orange lounge radio so uh before we wrap oh they are selling it's gonna be 350
10321960	10327880	not buying it but holy crap does that look awesome i i think i might have to invest not
10327880	10333800	really because we have we have an ecto one and we have the delorean and i think the next one's
10333800	10341000	supposed to be like they're petitioning for it to be uh oh god oh the turtles van is what they
10341000	10347640	wanted to do right so i want them to do a tardis but we'll see all right well uh we are gonna wrap
