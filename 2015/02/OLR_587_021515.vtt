00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
Tonight's show is brought to you by the letter M as we interview two of the creators of a multi-genre retro game named Starmazer.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
And you too can help see the tales of brick stone wood come to life.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
We'll take your questions in chat as well as your comments, feedback, and calls right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:44.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 587 for this February 15th, 2015.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
My name is Rob Roberts, also known online as Skie on Twitter and so forth.

00:49.000 --> 00:58.000
With you guys here live at the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts here in studio.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Yo.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
How you doing?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
I'm here.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
You're here.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
I'm full of egg custard.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Egg custard.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
And taro milk tea.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
We were talking about ice cream before the show which is always a great conversation to have I believe.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
Yes, except it's not all that great if you don't actually have the ice cream.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
That is true.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
So I might have to make a pit stop on the way home.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.000
You know it's no secret that DarkSakura and I are very fond of Pinkberry frozen yogurt.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
And they don't pay us to say that, we genuinely do like it.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
But if they wanted to pay us, we wouldn't say no.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
Or especially in free yogurt.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
But I was telling DarkSakura, we were talking about that a little bit, and she had brought up the egg custard and I said,

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
Did you know there's a creamery place right near her that uses like egg custard?

01:42.000 --> 01:46.000
And DarkSakura was like, really? With little stars in her eyes.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
There was a place though that my friend told me about that went out of business that was a frozen custard place.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Interesting.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
And I wish I, I've had stuff from there before, I don't remember the name of it.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
But frozen custard is actually very good.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
Yum yum, delicious.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Making me hungry for dessert.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
Also, definitely one of our food connoisseurs here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
If by food connoisseur you mean food carnivore, then yes.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
Getting, that's three weeks in a row from your new sandwich place.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
I'm probably not gonna get it next week.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
It just sounded good, I was really hungry.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Yeah.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Because I hadn't had lunch.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
It's all good.

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
So I got the meatball sub at this time, the large meatball sub instead of the small meatball sub.

02:27.000 --> 02:30.000
Food's important, it's a three hour show we do here.

02:30.000 --> 02:34.000
Live at the Voice of the Geeks Network every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
It was either that or I was going to get crazy bread from Little Caesars with a ludicrous amount of cheese on it.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
But I didn't, I didn't stop there.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
I may do that next week, but we'll see, I don't know.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Alright, that's fair, that works.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Alright, we are of course here live with you guys.

02:50.000 --> 02:57.000
And if you are listening live, you can participate with our show by heading over to the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com

02:57.000 --> 03:03.000
Some folks in chat, it looks like a lot of folks talking about the snow in Boston because at the end of Bobby's show,

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
because of course we are on live at VOG right after Bobby Black Wolf, he was talking about PAX East and Boston and all that.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
And some of us that are heading out to PAX East, which by the way, yes, I will be heading out to PAX East.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I'll talk more about that later.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
But if you're going to be at the show, I will be there.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Sadly, Loki and Dark Sakura will not be there, but I will.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
But now I have a legit concern.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.000
My California never sees snow, but is going to have to go to Boston.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.000
And I'm hoping this wintermageddon that's been going on out there, I'm really hoping it lets up in the next few weeks.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
Because I don't know, I don't know.

03:36.000 --> 03:40.000
I remember I went to the very first PAX East actually back in, what was it, 2010?

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
I think it was the very first PAX East.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
And it was snowing a little bit then.

03:44.000 --> 03:51.000
So it's not like, okay, I'm not going to die if it snows, but I just, please, I'd like my flight to get in and out on time.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Thank you. Be very nice. Appreciate it.

03:53.000 --> 03:59.000
Get in and out on time, but when it lands, it'll start doing, you know, fucking, you know, drift racing.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
Don't say that. Oh my god, don't say that. Alright.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
It's like Wangan Midnight once you hit that.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
Well, if they play Eurobeat, it might be okay.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
That's the only acceptable way.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
We're going to need to make a special landing.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
Hit it.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
Just JetBlue have like that on one of their satellite radio things, you know.

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
This is my heartbeat.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
That would be awesome. That should really be on all flights.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Take off the landings, you know.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
The music, they would go with that.

04:27.000 --> 04:31.000
HavicNights have an 8-hour chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
It says, prepare for that wind chill, Rob.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
I don't even know if I have a jacket sufficient enough.

04:36.000 --> 04:41.000
Keep in mind, I live in Sacramento, land of 110 degrees summer sometimes.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
It's 77 degrees today.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
It's like a May day today.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
I'm like, what's up with that?

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Not like an emergency, but an actual day in May.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Like, stop it, nature.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
And we need water. Bring the snow over here. We're in a super drought.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Well, we're not really in a super drought.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
We did have all that rain a few days ago.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
Yeah, but that barely put it down. That was like a notch in the bed.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
That's all it was.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
We just split the difference.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.000
Alright, anyway, we could talk about the weather and food for three hours,

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
but we want to talk about games.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
And we have an interview, actually, live on tonight's show.

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
I'm very excited to welcome two of the team members, Dawn and Austin, from StarMazer.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
We're going to be talking to them in about 15 minutes.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
But if you want to check out their game, they are on Kickstarter in the last few days,

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
trying to raise the funds to make this game happen.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
And I've got to say, it looks really cool.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
I wouldn't have invited them on the show if the game didn't kind of meet the standards we're looking at here.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
You can check this out online. It's StarMazer.com.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
That's S-T-A-R-R M-A-Z-E-R dot com.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000
And it's kind of like part point and click, part shoot-em-up.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
But it's not two games in one. It's like a blended experience.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
We're going to talk to Dawn.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
Like the Guardian Legend.

05:54.000 --> 05:59.000
Well, why do you think this might have tickled a soft spot for me?

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
But no, when you think point and click though, point and click more like a LucasArts type game.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Well, yeah, I understand that.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
So it's not quite the Guardian Legend.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
But definitely, definitely was hitting a soft spot there.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
But we'll talk to them about that.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
And you can ask them questions as well in our chat room in about 15 minutes.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
We'll get to that.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.000
But I want to get to our kickoff topic first and then see if we have enough time for our gaming weeks.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
Kickoff topic tonight.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
I don't know if you guys saw this going around the internet

06:22.000 --> 06:26.000
and you guys in chat that are participating live with the show.

06:26.000 --> 06:31.000
But there was a rumor over the weekend that started on 4chan of all places.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
You know, the minute you hear that something starts there,

06:34.000 --> 06:38.000
there's instantly like this big bag of salt just falls from the sky.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
And it's like, here, here's your big grain of salt, right?

06:41.000 --> 06:48.000
So the rumor was that Rayman is going to be a playable DLC character in Super Smash Brothers.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
Which is not something we haven't heard before.

06:51.000 --> 06:55.000
We've heard rumors that Ubisoft wanted Rayman in the game.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
There's a Rayman trophy.

06:57.000 --> 07:04.000
It wasn't like one of those characters were like, this is outside all, you know, plausibility what could possibly happen, right?

07:04.000 --> 07:11.000
So there's your giant salt that falls from the sky and it's like, alright, well, sure, sure, we've got some pictures,

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
but that shit can be photoshopped, whatever.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
Well then, a video comes out.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
And the video actually shows the character select screen.

07:19.000 --> 07:25.000
And, you know, moving through the different characters and landing on Rayman.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
So Rayman shows up and the whole thing like it's straight out of the game, right?

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
And so the video is pretty convincing.

07:31.000 --> 07:37.000
And I think I even said on Twitter, I said, alright, if this is fake, this is one of the best fakes that's ever been done.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
Well, guess what? Guess what, y'all? It was fake.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Of course it was fake.

07:42.000 --> 07:48.000
Because if it was real, they would show you going from the title screen to actually playing a match with Rayman

07:48.000 --> 07:53.000
and showing off all the cool stuff instead of like, see, here's an icon on the screen.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
See, here's me moving to the... No, it's always fake when it's that shit.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
It's never legit if it's, you know...

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
Did you watch the video of the guy who put it all together?

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Yeah, I watched it. It was cool.

08:04.000 --> 08:08.000
I mean, I have such mixed feelings about this and that's why I bring this to the table.

08:08.000 --> 08:12.000
Because certainly there's that element of, you little shit.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.000
Why did you start a fake rumor for the sake of starting a fake rumor?

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
It's fine. You know, I played a joke and it was over within like a day, so that's cool.

08:20.000 --> 08:27.000
Yeah, but at the same token, though, you're like, wow, he put a lot of work into this and it was really convincing.

08:27.000 --> 08:35.000
You've seen all the ones they've done for Five Nights at Freddy's and even back in the day on, you know, for EGM.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
You know, we had all the Street Fighter ones and it's nothing new.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Yeah. Oh, man. I remember we were younger.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.000
The jokes are fun.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
We were convinced that Ermac was legit and then...

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
And then Ermac was legit.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
Yeah, Ed Boon was like, let's make it legit.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Yeah, sure. Why not? So there it is.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
Looking in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, SSG100Matt says,

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
Rumor coming from 4chan. That should be the start and end to any rumor.

08:59.000 --> 09:04.000
Look, it's not that I disagree with you, but it's like the monkeys on the typewriter typing Shakespeare.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Yeah, let's put it this way.

09:05.000 --> 09:13.000
If there's ever going to be a rumor about leaked DLC or something like that, they will fucking show you the character, you know, being played in the game.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
They're not going to just show you the title screen because that's all they have.

09:16.000 --> 09:19.000
It's not like, well, that should be enough, you know.

09:19.000 --> 09:29.000
They will show you everything because it makes for a better story if you can see, like, here's the moves they have and here's, you know, the final smashes they have and that kind of stuff.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
So that's why, like, when I immediately saw something, I'm like, that's not real.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
It looks cool, but that's not real.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
Um, what do you... I mean, did you believe it at all? Be honest.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
No, I didn't.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
You didn't?

09:45.000 --> 09:52.000
Yeah, because I didn't know that it came from 4chan, but I saw it on NeoGaf and I was like, well, that's not real.

09:52.000 --> 10:00.000
Did any... Now, I didn't catch this because I only saw it on Twitter and places like that, but did any big websites actually pick it up and run with it?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
I think everybody ran it as, like, it's a rumor.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
Okay, so everybody ran it as a rumor because I thought maybe part of the whole experiment was...

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
And to be fair, I didn't watch the entire video.

10:08.000 --> 10:14.000
I wasn't going to spend 20 minutes looking at how this guy faked everybody out, but I kind of, like, I kind of skimmed through it a little bit.

10:14.000 --> 10:24.000
And I was like, maybe part of it is, because I've seen people do this before where they kind of want to test gaming media and see, like, how far will that copy-paste journalism go, you know, type of thing.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
And so I thought maybe that was part of it was...

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Just give them ideas for DLC, I mean...

10:30.000 --> 10:43.000
Well, I guess maybe that's one final question for me to ask on this whole thing is, do you think, in spite of all this stuff going on, do you think that Rayman could actually end up being DLC?

10:43.000 --> 10:55.000
I don't see why they couldn't. I mean, depends on what the relationship with Ubisoft is with Nintendo currently, because I know at one time, you know, that they're pretty buddy-buddy, especially with the launch of the Wii, or the Wii U.

10:55.000 --> 11:10.000
Well, I should just say even the Wii, because they're pretty supportive of the Wii as well, but, you know, Rayman was going to be, you know, a strong reason why you would need to buy that system, but I don't know, they've kind of backed away from that now, so I don't know.

11:10.000 --> 11:16.000
They could see them doing it, I guess, but I'm sure they've got plenty of ideas for DLC characters.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Yeah, true.

11:17.000 --> 11:23.000
And who knows how many DLC characters they're going to do, and if they're going to do any beyond Mewtwo, I guess.

11:23.000 --> 11:36.000
Alright, going to our chatroom again over at live.vognetwork.com, SSG100Matt says, knowing how the internet tends to overreact to stuff like this, I'm not shocked that this guy who made this isn't getting hacked and sent death threats.

11:36.000 --> 11:43.000
Because it's because it was Rayman, and not a lot of people give a shit about Rayman. If it was like Solid Snake or something like that, then maybe.

11:43.000 --> 11:53.000
I don't know, you don't know Extrafer over on, I mean, you do know Extrafer very well over on Hoard House, but I have to hear him talk about Rayman an awful lot. I think he was legit disappointed at the news.

11:54.000 --> 12:07.000
So we'll see. Anyhow, ADFSAD says 4chan is where the entire SSB Wii U roster originally leaked.

12:07.000 --> 12:21.000
So you know it is that whole thing where sometimes, I mean, I guess the, for lack of a better term, heightened anonymity of that forum does lend itself to being, you know, if you're going to go leak some information, that might be the place to do it.

12:21.000 --> 12:29.000
Not that I would ever endorse, but I'm just saying the heightened anonymity makes it probably alluring for people that want to go spill the beans on things, right?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
I guess.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Yeah, a little bit.

12:32.000 --> 12:41.000
So let's see, Tigerclaw in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says Rayman in Smash Brothers would make sense because he seems like the type of character that would fit in.

12:41.000 --> 12:54.000
Yeah, I mean, I do agree with that. He's like a platformer. He's kind of the mascot of another company, like you have Sonic for Sega, you have Mega Man, which maybe isn't the mascot for Capcom, but it's definitely one of their most well-known faces.

12:54.000 --> 13:09.000
Rayman would make a lot of sense in the game, except for that whole difficult relationship right now with Ubisoft and Nintendo, we're not really sure, you know, is there good feelings still there, or is there still a lot of, but we did get the trophy.

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
So, I mean, that shows that there's something going on there. So, anyhow.

13:15.000 --> 13:26.000
And lastly, SSG100Matt says, according to ScrewAttack, Ubisoft is going to make a statement on this hoax on Tuesday. Why would Ubisoft want to make a statement on the hoax?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
Because they own Rayman?

13:28.000 --> 13:40.000
I suppose, yeah, but I mean, why would they make an announcement of an announcement? That's weird to me. Why would they say, we're not going to say anything about it today, but we're going to say something about it Tuesday. Is that because the legal department has President's Day off? Is that...

13:40.000 --> 13:43.000
They may be, the whole company may have that day off or something.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Well, yeah, but I mean...

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
They're being French.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
They're being US, but...

13:46.000 --> 13:47.000
I guess.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.000
They're being French.

13:48.000 --> 13:57.000
Alright, I guess we'll chalk it up to that. Alright, we are going to have some of the guys from Star, Mazer, Austin, and Don here momentarily, but we have a few minutes.

13:57.000 --> 14:06.000
So, let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week. And before we get into games, I want to address this comment as well.

14:06.000 --> 14:13.000
Akuma JP in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, Rob sounds dry, like something's wrong with my voice tonight.

14:13.000 --> 14:27.000
Yeah, I am a little, my voice is a little bit hoarse tonight because even though I retire, and I've talked about this on the show before, I was hosting cult cinema for many, many years, doing, you know, hosting events and so forth.

14:27.000 --> 14:37.000
Even though I retired in October, I actually ended up hosting a show last night because my successor had a emergency type of scenario come up. I don't want to spill all her details, but she couldn't do it.

14:37.000 --> 14:46.000
So they asked me very nicely, could you please, please, please show up and do this? And I'm like, of course, of course. I'll, you know, if I just have to show up, do my thing and not performing or anything, I'll go.

14:46.000 --> 14:56.000
But since I was yelling, getting a crowd hyped, a crowd of 500 people, nonetheless, my voice is a little hoarse today because I really strained it last night, as I sometimes do at these events.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
Nay.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
Yeah.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Nay.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
There you go.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
You're hoarse.

15:01.000 --> 15:04.000
All right. From horses to gaming weeks, Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
Flom.

15:05.000 --> 15:11.000
Flom. Oh, this was the game you talked about last week that your teacher had released on iOS?

15:12.000 --> 15:29.000
Yes. It's a shooter. It can get kind of crazy if you, almost bullet hell moments in there, not like that bad, but really hard to dodge. It's got great music, great graphics in it, and a lot of work went into the game and it's super addicting.

15:29.000 --> 15:45.000
So if people have not gotten it yet, it's F-L-O-M-M. Flom. Go get it on iOS. It's out for iPad and iPhone. Do the thing. Get it because I said so. And I'm trying to get Steve to show up.

15:45.000 --> 15:56.000
Yeah. We are going to try to get him on the show in a future week, right? To give us all the pitch on the game and why we should check it out. The concept sounds really interesting. So I'm peaked. I will tell you that.

15:56.000 --> 16:17.000
It's kind of fun shooting number two pencils and junk mail. So on top of that, I've been playing some Dragon Age. I've been mostly writing Dragon Age because I'm actually five chapters ahead in my thick and people have really wanted to read it. So I'm actually going to be wrapping it up soon.

16:18.000 --> 16:26.000
And I guess I have to play Final Fantasy tonight so I can get hearts from my chicken. Chicken hearts! Yum!

16:26.000 --> 16:34.000
Today's the last day of the Valentine's Day event. Or Valentione or whatever they call it. They changed the name a little bit.

16:34.000 --> 16:39.000
The stuff in the thing that does stuff in things. So yeah.

16:39.000 --> 16:45.000
Cool. I'm going to break order here a little bit and I'm going to go next so I can set up some other things while Loki does his gaming week.

16:45.000 --> 16:52.000
But for my gaming week, I also touched Final Fantasy XIV today which is newsworthy because I actually haven't been playing a lot of it for about two weeks.

16:52.000 --> 17:01.000
But I did log in today to do just what Jamie was talking about there to get my Chocobo, the special little Valentine's barding that you can get for the Chocobo. I wanted to do that.

17:01.000 --> 17:09.000
I've been playing an awful lot of Diablo III. Season 2 started on Friday. Which if you don't know what the seasons are, it's only on the PC version.

17:09.000 --> 17:15.000
It's not on the console version because the console version isn't always online and it's already been hacked and item duped and all that.

17:15.000 --> 17:30.000
So in the PC version, which is always online, it allows them to do these more like leaderboard oriented events which the seasons are basically a way you can start a character that will, you know, everybody starts on this day and then the season runs for like three to four months.

17:30.000 --> 17:38.000
And you try to get, you know, you can get achievement points to run that. You can try to see what greater rift you can accomplish and what kind of time.

17:38.000 --> 17:47.000
There's different like conquests which are just basically like really high level. Think like gold and platinum trophy level achievements that you can achieve in the game.

17:47.000 --> 17:55.000
And they're all limited to seasons. And by participating, you get special cosmetic rewards that you only get if you play in that special period.

17:55.000 --> 18:01.000
And then the cool thing is any character you make during the season will roll into your general pool when it's over.

18:01.000 --> 18:11.000
And any experience that you get on your 70 characters, what they call the paragon experience, everything that's the end game experience, that will roll right into the paragon pool on your general characters.

18:11.000 --> 18:20.000
So it's like even though you're taking a side trip to go do this, you know, side character, your efforts will still be permanently felt in the game.

18:20.000 --> 18:26.000
And I think it's a really cool little feature on the PC version of the game and it's a real bummer the console people don't get to experience this.

18:26.000 --> 18:32.000
Although you do still get all the special loot. They work it into the consoles. It's just all in the general pool.

18:32.000 --> 18:41.000
I did promise a new game this week and I did actually ironically with all this discussion we've been having at the top of the show, I picked up a new to me game.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.000
This game's actually been out like for probably like a year and a half but I finally picked this up.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
It was about a year actually.

18:46.000 --> 18:51.000
It was about a year. Well it was only $10 on PlayStation thanks to the Flash sale.

18:51.000 --> 18:59.000
So I picked up Rayman Legends which I'd only really played the little Wii U experience that they had before so I hadn't really played the full game.

18:59.000 --> 19:09.000
So I've been playing a little bit of this and you know that Xtifer over on Hoard House, he loves this series and he's friendly, pressured me a lot to play this game on and off.

19:09.000 --> 19:16.000
So I finally got a chance to check it out and it's a pretty solid platformer that gives a lot to come back to.

19:16.000 --> 19:27.000
You know in the levels you're trying to collect these little critters. You want to collect as many like, they're not gold but they're looms I think they're called.

19:27.000 --> 19:35.000
Like lit up bugs or something. You're trying to collect as many of those as you can in a level and depending on how many you collect is what kind of trophy you'll get at the end of the level.

19:35.000 --> 19:44.000
And if you get a good enough trophy you get more unlocks. So it's like there's a lot of stuff that kind of like, a lot of little achievements to go for in the game that will unlock things.

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
And that's what people really like about platformers I think so that's kind of what gives Rayman a lot of legs.

19:49.000 --> 19:54.000
And the fact that you can go online and you have these daily and weekly challenges that are there as well.

19:54.000 --> 20:01.000
So there's a lot kind of to look for in the game. So I've been having fun just you know, I'm going to try to do what I can do on this level and this level.

20:01.000 --> 20:11.000
But the only problem is then I get a little bit of gaming OCD that takes over and it's like, oh my god I missed one bug in that level.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.000
I've got to go back and play the whole damn thing over again so I can get that one bug.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.000
And so that can cause my progress to be very very slow.

20:19.000 --> 20:26.000
But I've been having fun with the game. It is a lot of fun. It's a great platformer and I see why Extrovert is really into it.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
So I'll probably be playing more of that in the coming weeks.

20:30.000 --> 20:35.000
So that was pretty much it for my gaming week. Loki, last but not least, how about you?

20:35.000 --> 20:41.000
Well I played Besiege this week. I actually picked that up because I saw a trailer for it and it looked funny.

20:41.000 --> 20:52.000
It's, if you haven't heard of it, it's a game where you build machines out of parts and then you try to lay waste to medieval environments.

20:52.000 --> 21:07.000
So each level has a goal, like you can drive to this one spot and you get there without hidden mines or destroy this part of a castle or destroy an army or something like that.

21:07.000 --> 21:12.000
But you have to build these machines in order to do that and it's a lot harder than it sounds.

21:12.000 --> 21:15.000
But it's also a lot more hilarious as well.

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
So there's a ton of YouTube videos out there for it. It's going to be pretty popular.

21:19.000 --> 21:28.000
It's on Steam Early Access right now because, I don't know, there's just a lot of popularity with people making videos about machines and stuff that they've created and everything.

21:28.000 --> 21:33.000
So I played that. I played a little bit of LEGO Marvel Super Heroes because my son wanted to.

21:33.000 --> 21:39.000
And what else? I think it mostly just worked on my game.

21:39.000 --> 21:46.000
So now I have to the point now where I have the first level pretty much done and I'm ready to start more levels.

21:46.000 --> 21:53.000
I got all the framework stuff done. The only thing I'm really missing is a pause menu and some of the options screens and stuff like that.

21:53.000 --> 22:00.000
But for the most part the game is functional so I just have to make levels for it now, which is the best part.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
I can't wait to check out your game. I'm so excited.

22:03.000 --> 22:09.000
I'm glad this VoG Jam is still kind of keep on going here because I still have to get around to those videos.

22:09.000 --> 22:18.000
I have to add trees and stuff to the maps I have and that kind of thing. So just a lot of polish and level making.

22:18.000 --> 22:25.000
Alright. Well we are going to go here to our interview tonight. I'm very excited to welcome these guys on the show.

22:25.000 --> 22:31.000
We're going to be talking with Dawn who is the designer, writer, and director.

22:31.000 --> 22:36.000
And then we're also going to talk with Austin who is one of the game developers on this game, Star Maser.

22:36.000 --> 22:47.000
And Star Maser is on Kickstarter right now and it's a point and click adventure, part shoot-em-up, but it's not two games in one.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
It's a blend of these two game genres.

22:50.000 --> 22:57.000
So we're going to get these guys on the line because I can sit here and talk about it, but I think these guys will be able to talk to us much better about this game.

22:57.000 --> 23:03.000
So we're going to give them a call right now live here on the air here on Orange Lounge Radio.

23:03.000 --> 23:09.000
We are calling them up on Skype right now, Dawn and Austin with Star Maser.

23:09.000 --> 23:15.000
And I think we have somebody there. Is that Dawn? Oh, Dawn and Austin are both there in the same room. Hi guys.

23:15.000 --> 23:19.000
How's it going? Hello, can you hear me?

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
Standby.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
Hi guys, you're live on Orange Lounge Radio.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
What's up you guys? We've got technology from the future.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
There you are. Hi.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Hi, how's it going?

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
Great, you can hear us and see us.

23:32.000 --> 23:39.000
Yes, we can hear you and see you. I apologize we don't have video, but it's only a radio show over here at OLR, so we just have the audio.

23:39.000 --> 23:43.000
Great, that's alright. We did all this awesome setup. We look great right now, I have to tell you.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
I just want to use it at the end.

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
You guys look fantastic.

23:47.000 --> 23:53.000
Well, if you guys want, I'm sorry, one second, there's a bit of like, are we taping this? Is that a thing?

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
You want me to tape it?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
Yeah, go for it, and then it'll justify the video.

23:55.000 --> 23:59.000
Sorry guys, let's go ahead and get started. I apologize for the technical difficulty.

23:59.000 --> 24:05.000
That's okay, you guys are actually live on our show here at Orange Lounge Radio, broadcasting at vognetwork.com right now.

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
But let's talk a little bit about Star Mazer.

24:09.000 --> 24:14.000
So, I've been trying to explain to people what Star Mazer is all about, but you guys are really the minds behind the game.

24:14.000 --> 24:17.000
Tell us, what is Star Mazer?

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
Star Mazer is a retro, sexy, pointy, cooky, adventure, snuff game.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
That's the fastest way to say it, but what does that mean?

24:23.000 --> 24:27.000
Star Mazer is a storytelling game. It takes place in the far future.

24:27.000 --> 24:37.000
It is a unique blend of mechanics from two seemingly disparate game types into a new and unique genre.

24:37.000 --> 24:47.000
It is a game about replayability, a game about story discovery, and a game about flying cool ships through space.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.000
Why point and click and shoot them up?

24:51.000 --> 24:59.000
What was it about those two genres where you were like, yes, they need to get married and have this game?

24:59.000 --> 25:07.000
One of them is an amazing action mechanic that tends to crap the bed when it comes to story.

25:07.000 --> 25:13.000
Tell me the story of Ikaruga. It does not exist. Shoot the aliens.

25:13.000 --> 25:22.000
The other is a highly story-based game type which tends to ignore action and mechanical fun.

25:22.000 --> 25:28.000
When they do implement it, it tends to be kind of janky and weird and kind of tacked on when I was younger.

25:28.000 --> 25:33.000
I guess the shortest answer is because I played those games the most when I was a kid.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
When I thought about making games, those are the two game types I wanted to make.

25:37.000 --> 25:46.000
But instead of making two disparate games with missing parts, I would rather make one game that uses the best parts of other games to make a new game type.

25:46.000 --> 25:56.000
Awesome. If you guys want to ask questions of Don or Austin from Star Maser, you can join us in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

25:56.000 --> 26:01.000
Dungeon Buster is in our chat room and says, love the pixel art already, looks great.

26:01.000 --> 26:07.000
I got to say, this is one of the first things I noticed about the game. The pixel art is very detailed.

26:07.000 --> 26:12.000
There's a lot of love for it all over the Kickstarter page with all these little animated sprites and so forth.

26:12.000 --> 26:17.000
What is it about this pixel art style that is necessary for this game?

26:17.000 --> 26:24.000
I want to answer that question. This is Don, by the way. I'm sorry that I'm not letting you ask the talk. I'll let him talk in a moment.

26:25.000 --> 26:30.000
Right now he's still chained to the wall. Just kidding.

26:30.000 --> 26:38.000
There are two distinct reasons. The first is nostalgia. I'm making the game I wanted to make when I was nine.

26:38.000 --> 26:48.000
When I was nine, games looked a certain way and we wanted to extend or expand the idea of what games looked like back then as opposed to stay slavishly to them.

26:48.000 --> 26:54.000
We wanted to get past their limitations. We wanted to create a game that looks like what I thought games looked like.

26:54.000 --> 27:02.000
I recently started playing Four Star Mazer, in fact, one of my favorite games of all time, which is called Gate of Thunder for the Turbo Graphics CD system.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
It's a great game. It's one of the best shmups ever made.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
Dark Soccer here at OLR is a big fan of that.

27:08.000 --> 27:15.000
Awesome. Well, here's the trick. I remember it looking a lot better than it looked, and it looks incredible.

27:15.000 --> 27:26.000
But in my brain, my nine-year-old version of myself made the animated intro in the beginning with four frames of animation.

27:26.000 --> 27:31.000
I had a whole anime in my head when I remembered that game. I wanted to make that game.

27:31.000 --> 27:35.000
I wanted to make the game that I remember playing when I was much younger.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.000
So that's element number one, nostalgia.

27:38.000 --> 27:43.000
Amigo Softworks, my company, our tagline is nostalgia in HD.

27:43.000 --> 27:49.000
We want to bring to life the fantasies that you played when you were younger.

27:49.000 --> 27:54.000
Not repeat them, but make them feel like they felt when you were younger.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.000
So nostalgia is number one.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
Number two, though, is an exploration of art.

27:58.000 --> 28:02.000
So pixel art was an art form of necessity back in the day.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
Sprites had to be a certain way.

28:03.000 --> 28:13.000
In fact, the entire look of a whole new form of art was formed because some people had a 16x16 grid to create all kinds of expression with.

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
I find that fascinating. I like art by limitation.

28:17.000 --> 28:24.000
Our actual game frame is limited and requires all kinds of innovative sprite use.

28:24.000 --> 28:30.000
Some elements of our main character are one pixel wide if you take away the border.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
So that's on purpose.

28:33.000 --> 28:44.000
We want to express art that was born of limitation rather than just adhere to limitation.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
Mega Man, the blue bomber is blue because of a limitation of the NES.

28:48.000 --> 28:57.000
Inafune said a number of times that he wanted Mega Man to be red, but the NES could produce three shades of blue and only one shade of red.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
So red and orange.

28:58.000 --> 29:05.000
So the blue bomber, the famous, I'm looking right now, I have an entire wall with vinyl cutouts of Mega Man sprites.

29:06.000 --> 29:13.000
I know our listeners can't see you guys, but you have a pillow right behind you that looks like it has a giant Mega Man on it.

29:13.000 --> 29:18.000
I've got a Mega Man style Judge Dredd on a pillow.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
We're sitting on a quilt that's like a Mega Buster back there.

29:22.000 --> 29:23.000
I'm a giant Mega Man fan.

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
That's why we have Manami Matsumae as one of our composers for the game.

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
She's the original sound and composer for the original Mega Man.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.000
But what I'm saying is there were challenges and limitations.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
Chip tunes are really popular right now.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
That's ridiculous.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.000
It's only ridiculous if you take out the art though, right?

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Technically, that's dumb.

29:41.000 --> 29:46.000
That's like banging two pots and pans together is a new genre of music because that's all we have.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
But that's not really the truth.

29:48.000 --> 30:00.000
Chip tunes of today, chip artists of today are creating new and unique flavors of music that could not possibly exist without all of the groundwork laid by people who are making music with limitation.

30:00.000 --> 30:03.000
The people who made the original chip tunes weren't making chip tunes.

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
They were making orchestral pieces with massive limitations.

30:07.000 --> 30:13.000
Right now, chip tunes artists make chip tunes by exploring chip tunes as its own art form.

30:13.000 --> 30:18.000
We're exploring pixels in that same way with our art.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
I love chip tunes.

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
But banging pots and pans together, come on, it's not dubstep.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Come on.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
Let's be a little fair here.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.000
No, I'm kidding.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
I'm kidding.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
No, dubstep is a dial-up modem.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.000
That's true, that's true.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
Austin, you've been sitting there so patiently while we've been talking to Don.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.000
Austin, I got a question for you.

30:35.000 --> 30:48.000
So you are the game designer on this game and one thing that caught my eye as I was looking through the Kickstarter was you guys have a system called OMG or open middled gameplay.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
What is this OMG about?

30:50.000 --> 30:55.000
So the OMG system is the open middled gameplay of Star Mazer.

30:56.000 --> 31:04.000
The easiest way to explain this is it's like a season from your favorite TV show except in the game you can watch the episodes in a different order.

31:04.000 --> 31:11.000
And by doing that, it will change the outcome because there's this cascading effect of all the things that happened in the beginning throughout the story.

31:11.000 --> 31:17.000
So the way we're actually implementing that is that Star Mazer can start in one of a few possible scenarios.

31:17.000 --> 31:22.000
And it will have a few satisfying endings based off of the events that are taking place in the game.

31:22.000 --> 31:32.000
But as far as everything in the middle, we don't know exactly how that's going to go because we're designing the world and we're implementing the code of the game so that all the characters represent their worldview.

31:32.000 --> 31:43.000
It is very popular for games that have consequences and choice to have this world state where your actions are rated on a scale of good to bad or lawful to chaotic.

31:43.000 --> 31:52.000
And we really don't like that idea because it takes a very complex idea and breaks it down into a definable system.

31:52.000 --> 31:59.000
Games as a simulation do that, but we're making games in the year 2015, not in the year 1985.

31:59.000 --> 32:04.000
So we have a lot of power to be able to make very interesting simulations.

32:04.000 --> 32:08.000
So the way we're building characters is that they see the world from their own worldview.

32:08.000 --> 32:15.000
When you communicate with a character, all these other events could have gone on, but they only care about what they know, what they've seen, and what they've heard of your actions.

32:15.000 --> 32:24.000
So when you're interacting with characters, if you're an amazing pilot because you've been doing great as you fly your Star Wolf, then they're either going to give you respect because maybe they think pilots are cool.

32:24.000 --> 32:28.000
Maybe they'll be afraid or jealous of you because they're a fighter pilot themselves.

32:28.000 --> 32:33.000
Or maybe they don't give a damn how great you are flying because you need to pay them some money and you haven't paid them money.

32:34.000 --> 32:43.000
So what's interesting is that we're recording all these things, and those interactions between characters, we don't specify exactly how they're going to happen in the playthrough that you go into.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
That's a whole episode in a different order.

32:45.000 --> 32:52.000
You might encounter a great space pilot early on in the game, but in your next run-through it could happen at the end.

32:52.000 --> 32:59.000
The thing is, your interactions with that space pilot will then create more events that other characters in the world hear about that change how they interact with you.

32:59.000 --> 33:14.000
So the real innovation of Star Mesa, the thing that's going to set it beyond just being an interesting combination of mechanics, is the open middle gameplay where you can play through this game over and over again.

33:14.000 --> 33:21.000
It's always a new experience, and it's always a new way to play through and learn how to be a hero, which is the core message of Star Mesa.

33:22.000 --> 33:37.000
I think it's a really cool sounding idea. Obviously we have companies that make these very episodic games, they're very well known for it like Telltale, but it's like, what if you played a series like The Walking Dead but it was in a different order?

33:37.000 --> 33:48.000
That could change everything completely, so this sounds very ambitious, and I think it's a really cool little twist, especially for something that is kind of rooted in retro in a way. I think it's really cool.

33:48.000 --> 34:03.000
An important note though is that the game isn't released in episodes, the game is released in a season, so you get all the episodes and more episodes than you get in one playthrough all at the same time, whereas like a Telltale game, you get an episode at a time. That's kind of the thing.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.000
Good call out.

34:04.000 --> 34:12.000
Excellent. Well let's talk a little bit about Kickstarter, because you guys are in the last five days of your Kickstarter campaign.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Yes we are.

34:14.000 --> 34:31.000
Kickstarter URLs are very long, they're a little hard for me to give out here on the show, but if you head over to the website StarMaser.com, that's S-T-A-R-R-M-A-Z-E-R.com, there's a link right there to the Kickstarter if you want to check that out.

34:31.000 --> 34:46.000
It looks like you guys are definitely within striking distance of meeting that goal, and I really do hope you guys do meet that goal, but here's your chance with our listening audience and so forth. Why should we consider giving money to this project?

34:47.000 --> 34:55.000
So why don't you get all the highfalutin, high-minded art and theory versions, and I'll give the Selly version.

34:55.000 --> 35:02.000
So yeah, the real exciting thing behind StarMaser is that we have an opportunity, we've got a team that can build a game that...

35:02.000 --> 35:10.000
It's the game that you remember playing as a child, but it's actually that good right now.

35:10.000 --> 35:18.000
That whole aspect of that, like we remember how great those games were back then, you know, flying through the smoke sections, or interacting with those cool narratives.

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
But if you play those games back today, they're not that good.

35:22.000 --> 35:28.000
And the implementation of the OMG system is something that games have been trying to do for...

35:28.000 --> 35:37.000
In various degrees, games have been trying, or skirting with the idea, but have not fully achieved. The closest example is Shadow of Mordor, which did a great job at it.

35:37.000 --> 35:46.000
And we actually discussed our systems of how we're doing the OMG to the Shadow of Mordor team, and it's very similar to how we're doing things.

35:46.000 --> 35:51.000
But we have a different goal, we're giving a different experience, so we have the opportunity to actually build this system.

35:51.000 --> 36:02.000
And so if you want to see an advancement in game narrative to an actual interactive state, as opposed to going through a linear experience, which is great when you get a lot of games.

36:02.000 --> 36:10.000
That is the thing that we are really setting out to build. That is the new experience that if you fund this game, we will be providing.

36:10.000 --> 36:18.000
That's incredible. We're going to be on the cutting edge. You can be somebody who supported the weather change in video games forever.

36:18.000 --> 36:28.000
If you had the option to back The Walking Dead as a telltale game and then set the change for narrative games a few years ago, and you could be a part of that, that would be really awesome.

36:28.000 --> 36:36.000
Because then you would be part of the people that made telltale-like games, which is a genre now that other companies are doing.

36:36.000 --> 36:47.000
Star Mazer is the next logical evolution in that idea of gameplay. I am very familiar with The Walking Dead series, it's inspired me, I've been thinking about it a lot over the past few years.

36:47.000 --> 36:58.000
And Dawn's ideas that come from a different angle have really merged together to enable us to finally find the next step in that sort of line of engaging narrative games.

36:58.000 --> 37:07.000
That is awesome. I agree with that. Our game looks pretty. To get it on Kickstarter, you get it for five bucks off.

37:07.000 --> 37:16.000
Right? It's going to retail at least twenty bucks. Our lowest tier is fifteen bucks. That's five bucks off. That's twenty-five percent off. That's amazing.

37:16.000 --> 37:27.000
The soundtrack is incredible. I don't know if you've noticed, but not only do we have legendary chip music artist Alex Maurer as our lead composer and also one of the owners of Amigo Softworks, my company,

37:28.000 --> 37:39.000
he's also enlisted the help of over twenty-five other amazing musical artists. The Protomen are on board. Like I mentioned earlier, Manami Matsumae is on board.

37:42.000 --> 37:49.000
Vert. Vert from Shovel Knight. There are so many. Saber Bolt. Saber Bolt. Play of X. Fighting. A-Rival. A-Rival. Arcade Heart.

37:50.000 --> 38:00.000
It takes more than a page to scroll through it. It's incredible. The only way we'll get there is to break our first stretch goal, which is $180,000.

38:00.000 --> 38:08.000
So we need your help. We need your help to get there. That's super important. MegaRan is going to be in the game as an NPC who is going to be fully voiced by MegaRan himself.

38:08.000 --> 38:14.000
And who knows if he can spit some rhymes during the game. That'd be cool. It's incredible.

38:14.000 --> 38:20.000
Some people get a taste of the soundtrack here. We actually have a little clip that we grabbed from the Kickstarter page of what that sounds like.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.000
You can hear a little bit of this chiptune theme here.

38:27.000 --> 38:33.000
You definitely hear some of the retro goodness there in the Star Mazer theme. And if you want to hear more of that, it's over on the Kickstarter page.

38:33.000 --> 38:42.000
But I was actually going to ask. You're sitting there basically spouting off a lot of the artists that make up the playlist here at Vodka Network.

38:42.000 --> 38:47.000
I mean, we love a lot of these guys. How did you get them all together for this?

38:47.000 --> 38:52.000
I'm about to say the most arrogant thing I think I've ever said in my whole life.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
Please.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
I presented them Star Mazer.

38:57.000 --> 39:01.000
I did it. I did that thing. No, here's the trick. Here's the trick. Okay, so there's this thing.

39:01.000 --> 39:13.000
There's a filmmaker who said, how do you go from being a video store clerk to one of the most lauded filmmakers of all time?

39:13.000 --> 39:21.000
And the filmmaker looks directly at the interview and says, you make reservoir dogs. That was his answer.

39:21.000 --> 39:26.000
And that always sat really dark with me. Because there's probably a lot that went into making reservoir dogs.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
You don't just snap your fingers and reservoir dogs come out.

39:29.000 --> 39:37.000
But I've been asked the same question you just asked. I know so many times, and what I come to isn't, you be a badass and make Star Mazer.

39:37.000 --> 39:42.000
That's the funny, jokey answer. The truth is, you have nine people who work really hard on a thing.

39:42.000 --> 39:52.000
You have a provably committed team of artists working together to make a thing, spearheaded by Alex Maher, the music side at least.

39:52.000 --> 39:56.000
Spearheaded by Alex Maher, who is again legendary. People want to work with that guy.

39:56.000 --> 40:01.000
Show them the video, the count video that we put together. Show them the work that we've done so far.

40:01.000 --> 40:05.000
Show them the documents. Show them the character designs. Show them all this neat stuff.

40:05.000 --> 40:11.000
It becomes hard to resist if you've got the time and you've got the interest in this kind of thing.

40:11.000 --> 40:15.000
Something that a lot of people are committing themselves to very deeply and truly.

40:15.000 --> 40:20.000
So the short, jokey answer is, you make Star Mazer. That's how.

40:20.000 --> 40:25.000
But the actual reason is, you work really hard on something that a lot of people can get behind.

40:25.000 --> 40:31.000
If you look at all the others, not a single one of those artists is a random guy from the street or like John Williams.

40:31.000 --> 40:34.000
I don't know that John Williams would want to be part of Star Mazer.

40:34.000 --> 40:39.000
I know Manami Matsumae, who I would consider the John Williams of video games, is interested.

40:39.000 --> 40:45.000
Her first answer was, it looks a lot like UN Squadron. And she's really missed doing games like that.

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
So that's a really good answer, right?

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
That's awesome.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
We've got all kinds of different answers from all kinds of different folks.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.000
But all of them engaged with Star Mazer at the same level.

40:53.000 --> 40:59.000
We think that our backers, nearly 4,000 of them at this point, engage with the idea.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
We hope to spread that idea.

41:01.000 --> 41:06.000
Right now we're having a reach problem, not an engagement problem.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
Right now, we have conversions.

41:09.000 --> 41:16.000
Kickstarter gives you these weird stats that don't always hash out because their statistical analysis doesn't include, whatever, math.

41:16.000 --> 41:23.000
But what you come to is you realize that we are getting a conversion rate of around 40%, which is baffling.

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
10% is normally like pie in the sky high.

41:26.000 --> 41:33.000
So the fact that 40% of the people who see Star Mazer buy Star Mazer immediately are pledged to the system.

41:33.000 --> 41:40.000
And our average pledge is nearly twice as high as normal average pledges, I've found.

41:40.000 --> 41:46.000
Which is pretty great for people in our bracket who offer tiers lower than that.

41:46.000 --> 41:51.000
Our average bid is pretty high, which is pretty incredible.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
People love the game when they know about it.

41:53.000 --> 42:00.000
So something like being on your radio show or knowing people who can spread the word is super important for us.

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
So thank you very much.

42:02.000 --> 42:07.000
I would like to point out, all of those artists are being integrated in an individual way.

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
We're not just going to say, make a thing and do a thing.

42:09.000 --> 42:13.000
The proto-men have a totally different impact on the game than, say, Arcade High.

42:13.000 --> 42:17.000
Both of those have special things planned for each one of these artists.

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
So that probably helped getting them on board as well.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
Instead of just saying, hey brah, want to do a thing for game brah?

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
We came to them and said, listen, we have a really cool idea.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
The idea with Arcade High is incredible.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.000
The idea with MegaRan's character is incredible.

42:31.000 --> 42:37.000
So yeah, I think having a fully fleshed out idea that a lot of people are already behind because it has some form of merit,

42:37.000 --> 42:40.000
that's probably the easiest way to get them involved.

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
Well, we are happy to help out by helping to spread the word.

42:44.000 --> 42:47.000
And yeah, I was actually talking with our voiceover guy before the show.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
And he had checked out your campaign because he saw that you guys were coming on the show tonight.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.000
And he was like, that looks awesome. I just backed it.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
So there you go. We know we got at least one.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Nice. Thank you. Thank you very much.

42:57.000 --> 43:03.000
I want to at least, I don't want to keep you guys too long because I know you guys, of course, are busy trying to get the word out and so forth.

43:03.000 --> 43:07.000
I want to get to at least like one or two questions from our chatters over at live.vognetwork.com.

43:07.000 --> 43:14.000
Let me get a question here from Tigerclaw who asks, with a title like Starmazer, is a maze involved?

43:14.000 --> 43:18.000
Can you ask the question again? It got kind of garbled.

43:18.000 --> 43:24.000
Sure. No problem. Tigerclaw on our chat, I'm asking, with a title like Starmazer, is a maze involved in the game?

43:25.000 --> 43:32.000
No. A maser, so yeah, I can't say no. I'm sure there's going to be maze-like things at some point.

43:32.000 --> 43:36.000
There are navigation things that have to do with your ship and the flying sector.

43:36.000 --> 43:47.000
Navigation has to happen. But a maser, M-A-S-E-R, is any device that emits radioelectric or thermoelectric energy.

43:47.000 --> 43:53.000
So a great example of a maser is a laser. A laser is a subclass of maser.

43:53.000 --> 44:00.000
But when I came up with the story, I was nine, so Zs were way cooler than Ss.

44:00.000 --> 44:07.000
In our game, the Starmazer is this giant ultimate weapon that everybody, including Brick, is after.

44:07.000 --> 44:11.000
Brick is the main character of our story, by the way. Brick M. Stonewood. The M stands for metal.

44:12.000 --> 44:20.000
I would have thought that maybe the maze was part of that, maybe the storytelling a little bit, because it's never going to be the same.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
I thought maybe that was a way to look at it.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
Totally. Yeah, totally.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
I like your answer too.

44:26.000 --> 44:31.000
No, no, that's great. I think we're going to say that from now on. We will not distribute you. That's our idea.

44:31.000 --> 44:37.000
Actually, the open middle gameplay provides a labyrinthine storytelling device, a maze-like method.

44:37.000 --> 44:41.000
We're calling all of our little game units story mazes.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Story mazes?

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
That's very cool.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Do I get a credit for that?

44:47.000 --> 44:51.000
No, I'm going to call it Minotaur.

44:51.000 --> 44:55.000
One more question here from chat. Triptide asks,

44:55.000 --> 45:05.000
Is there a way to, as an already backer of the project, continue funding the game after the Kickstarter and still up our pledges for a limited period of time?

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
A lot of games try to do so.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
I think we're probably going to do add-ons.

45:10.000 --> 45:13.000
By the way, Triptide is somebody we know.

45:13.000 --> 45:26.000
Hi, Triptide. We don't know him personally, but we actually have, at starmazer.tv, we have a Twitch show every day during the campaign that culminates in a 24-hour Twitchstravaganza.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.000
We have a pizza party and live music and all this kind of stuff.

45:29.000 --> 45:35.000
That's at the last day of our campaign. This Friday through Saturday. Friday at 10 AM PST, all the way through Saturday at 10 AM PST.

45:35.000 --> 45:40.000
But anyway, Triptide has been on watching that show almost every day since we started it.

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
So he's kind of sneaking in an extra question.

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
Which is really great.

45:44.000 --> 45:48.000
Add-ons are a thing we're going to try to do. We're still working out the details for them though.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
That's one of the things people don't really talk about when they do their campaign.

45:51.000 --> 45:54.000
And I'm sure we're going to do a Kickstarter post-mortem or something.

45:54.000 --> 45:59.000
But there's a lot of information that's not available. Like, hey, how do you handle add-ons?

45:59.000 --> 46:03.000
We don't just click an add-on button. There's a whole big process that you have to go through.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.000
So we're working on it. We'll definitely announce something soon.

46:06.000 --> 46:15.000
Alright, awesome. Now I have one more question that may not be as serious, but it's one of those things that when you notice it, you have to ask.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
So this is a question for Austin.

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
I'm leaving my pants on. My pants are staying on.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.000
It's not that kind of show.

46:20.000 --> 46:29.000
Austin, this is a question for you. I couldn't help but notice, over at starmazer.com, on your profile, there's a little DDR arrow in the picture.

46:29.000 --> 46:36.000
And your Twitter name, 2DX. Do you have a Bamani history like this show does?

46:36.000 --> 46:40.000
Oh, that's easy! That's so good!

46:40.000 --> 46:48.000
I was thinking that Orange Lounge that you guys were referencing that musician, so I was really stoked about that.

46:48.000 --> 46:54.000
So yes, actually, I run a company, I'm co-founder of a company called 2DX.

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
But it's T-O-O-D-X, as in an excessive amount of deluxe.

46:58.000 --> 47:03.000
It is absolutely inspired by BeatMania 2DX, which is one of my favorite games of all time.

47:03.000 --> 47:07.000
I love the difficulty of it. I play one-handed. I just recently did two mods.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Whatever, I'm not very great at it, but it's because it's super hard.

47:09.000 --> 47:17.000
But yes, it is a triple entendre. I'll let you figure out the other ones, because some of them I don't want to say out on public radio.

47:17.000 --> 47:24.000
But yes, I grew up playing a lot of music games. BeatMania 2DX was the first Japanese game I imported.

47:24.000 --> 47:31.000
It's a huge aspect of mine, so I am so glad that you guys are representing that.

47:31.000 --> 47:34.000
Some of my favorite songs at BeatMania.

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
We all met playing Dance Dance Revolution at Roseville Golf Land.

47:37.000 --> 47:43.000
Dark Sakura used to be a mod on DDR Freak. This show's been going for 13 years, believe it or not.

47:44.000 --> 47:48.000
Longest running video game podcast. So there it is, born of the DDR community.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
That's so cool.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
RIP DDR Freak.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
What's that?

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
I've never legitimately played DDR.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
What?

47:56.000 --> 47:57.000
Gasp.

47:57.000 --> 48:01.000
Don't worry, I'm going to fix this. I just found this out. I will fix this as soon as possible.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Don't you have a new stretch goal?

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
You have a 24-hour stream coming up, right?

48:06.000 --> 48:12.000
If you have a 24-hour stream coming up, I think some DDR has to happen in that.

48:12.000 --> 48:13.000
I think that's got to be a thing that happens.

48:13.000 --> 48:14.000
24 hours of butterfly.

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
I am so down for the best fit on DDR.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
Alright, there it is.

48:18.000 --> 48:26.000
Now, if you weren't already considering this, StarMazer, now you know this is part of the Bamadi family here from many, many years ago. I love this.

48:26.000 --> 48:30.000
Anyhow, I want to thank you guys for being on the show this week.

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
One more quick question for you guys, because we always ask all our guests this.

48:33.000 --> 48:41.000
Besides StarMazer and other things that you are directly involved with, what type of video games are you playing right now?

48:41.000 --> 48:42.000
Don?

48:45.000 --> 48:50.000
Okay, so I'm working a lot, so I'm not able to play a bunch.

48:50.000 --> 48:58.000
For StarMazer specifically, and I'll get to your question directly, but for StarMazer specifically, I'm playing a lot of old-school swaps and adventure games.

48:58.000 --> 49:03.000
I just got Loom for my Turbo Duo, which I'm going to dig into pretty soon here, because I remember loving that game a lot.

49:03.000 --> 49:14.000
So I've been doing that a lot, but that said, I've been playing, I guess it's because it's portable, and if I have time then I can sit down.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.000
I normally am just doing work.

49:15.000 --> 49:23.000
I've been playing my Vita a lot, and I think most recently I just finished Hotline Miami, the original.

49:23.000 --> 49:33.000
I was able to play a little bit of Hotline Miami 2 behind closed doors recently, and I fell in love with it and got to playing Hotline Miami.

49:33.000 --> 49:42.000
So I'm playing that a lot. I'm in my third playthrough of SteamWorld Dig, and I don't know why.

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
There's something unbelievably addictive about that game. I really love it.

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
That is an addictive game. It's a lot of fun.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
It is a very addictive game.

49:49.000 --> 49:56.000
And then for consoles, I'm stuck in Alien Isolation. I want to spend time playing it at some point.

49:56.000 --> 50:06.000
And I got a buddy who plays Call of Duty, so I've been playing Call of Duty Advanced, whatever newest bro game, a lot too.

50:06.000 --> 50:11.000
But I don't know that I'm super into that outside of the experience of playing it with my friend.

50:11.000 --> 50:16.000
Which, by the way, is a good way to consider if you're not into Call of Duty, that's a great merit for Call of Duty.

50:16.000 --> 50:21.000
It's one of the few of those types of games you can actually split screen, so you can have couch co-op against. It's just pretty fun.

50:21.000 --> 50:25.000
So that's the truth of it. I wish I had a really cool answer, but I'm mostly working.

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
I understand. Austin, what about you?

50:28.000 --> 50:37.000
So the most recent game I dove into was the demo that was released for Read Only Memories, which is a point-and-click adventure inspired by Snatcher.

50:37.000 --> 50:41.000
So it's been an inspiration for me working on Star Mazer, but I just absolutely love it.

50:41.000 --> 50:48.000
It's a very engrossing storyline, the character's really great, the art is beautiful. So that was the most one I dove into.

50:48.000 --> 50:55.000
Recently I stole a few minutes away and played a game jam game called Apocalypse Gardening, which feels like it was made by Vlambeer.

50:55.000 --> 51:01.000
It's got this amazing balance of shooting and growing. You can find that on the internet somewhere, so I highly recommend that.

51:01.000 --> 51:08.000
And the game I am most excited to play as soon as we get funded, and I have a few minutes, is going to be Life is Strange.

51:08.000 --> 51:12.000
Because people have been talking about it a lot, it sounds a lot like a game I want to build.

51:12.000 --> 51:17.000
He's not lying, he actually made me download it. It's sitting on our Xbox right now.

51:17.000 --> 51:23.000
And then we worked and it got late and I fell asleep, so I'm excited to play that soon. That's my list.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
That's awesome.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Life is Strange is in my queue right now.

51:27.000 --> 51:34.000
We just had Matt Kahn on the show about four months ago talking about Read Only Memories when they were running the Kickstarter, so I think he'd appreciate the chat out there.

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
Oh cool, you know Matt? He's super nice.

51:36.000 --> 51:37.000
Yeah, it's awesome.

51:37.000 --> 51:44.000
And by the way, I will have you know the chatters right now. I know you can't see them in chat, but they are lighting up on this DDR thing.

51:44.000 --> 51:49.000
And Dartesuya did not expect the interview to go down this road.

51:49.000 --> 51:54.000
Jason's saying, I'm so glad Sky asked this question, I noticed the exact same thing.

51:54.000 --> 52:01.000
Fuzzy Ski saying, I will make Don play DDR while dressed as Zangief.

52:01.000 --> 52:04.000
Yeah, I'm going to have a Zangief thing going on.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
I can kind of see it.

52:05.000 --> 52:11.000
He could be here on Friday or one of the days during the 24 hour show, so he probably will course me.

52:11.000 --> 52:19.000
That's amazing. You guys have been a lot of fun to have on the show. I've kept you way over time, but thank you for spending time with us here tonight at Orange Lawn Radio.

52:19.000 --> 52:28.000
Again, the Kickstarter is in its last few days, so if you're hearing this show throughout the week or live tonight or via the podcast feed sometime this week,

52:28.000 --> 52:35.000
check it out over at StarMaser.com. That's S-T-A-R-R Maser, M-A-Z-E-R dot com.

52:35.000 --> 52:42.000
And pulling for you guys, really hope to see you guys make it. I would like to play this game myself, so rooting for you guys.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
Thank you so much.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
We would like to make it for you.

52:44.000 --> 52:48.000
Alright, here's hoping. Well, thank you guys for taking the time out and best of luck.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Thank you. Bye.

52:50.000 --> 52:54.000
Hope to follow up with you on release day. Alright, take care guys.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
Let's do it.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.000
Thanks.

52:56.000 --> 53:00.000
That again was Austin and Dawn from StarMaser.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.000
They're cool.

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
Yeah, they were fun. Isn't that funny? And they're talking in chat, like Jason says,

53:05.000 --> 53:12.000
DDR2DX, Bamani, read only memories. Austin has a lot of overlap with OLR's key tenants. Isn't that funny?

53:12.000 --> 53:15.000
The internet's a big place. The internet's a big place.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
And yet so small.

53:16.000 --> 53:21.000
I know, and yet so small. We're all gamers. Darn it. At the end of the day, alright.

53:21.000 --> 53:27.000
Anyhow, I'm very happy to talk to them, and I notice their game's a big deal.

53:27.000 --> 53:30.000
They brought a lot of people into our chat room tonight, so welcome.

53:30.000 --> 53:37.000
Welcome to Orange Lawn Radio. As I mentioned, we all met playing Dance Dance Revolution at an arcade 13 years ago.

53:37.000 --> 53:44.000
We started this show, and after we would play games at the arcade, we used to go to a little diner in the parking lot of Roseville Golf Land

53:44.000 --> 53:48.000
and talk shit about our favorite thing, video games. And here's what we're still doing.

53:48.000 --> 53:49.000
We need to do that again soon.

53:49.000 --> 53:50.000
We're still doing it.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
We have an OLR live from Brookfield.

53:52.000 --> 53:59.000
We're still doing it with all you guys here, 13 laters, but now our table is virtual, and all you guys get to come sit at the table,

53:59.000 --> 54:05.000
and we give everybody a voice through email, through our Skype line later in the show. We'll take some live calls.

54:05.000 --> 54:11.000
And you can be on the show just like Don and Austin were, Twitter, forums, everything.

54:11.000 --> 54:12.000
Oh my god, I just had a thought.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
What's that?

54:13.000 --> 54:20.000
What if actual OLRCon is just everyone going to Roseville Golf Land and then taking over Brookfield?

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
You know, you talk about this OLRCon.

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
How many in your party? 200.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
200. All right.

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
How many in your party? Everyone.

54:29.000 --> 54:34.000
All right, well, best of luck to those guys over at Star Maser, but we do still have plenty of show coming up for you guys.

54:34.000 --> 54:38.000
We want to get through what's going on in the weekend news. Some quick housekeeping for you guys.

54:38.000 --> 54:45.000
There will be no show while PAX East is going on, which is like March 7th. I don't remember the date off the top of my head.

54:45.000 --> 54:53.000
Maybe March 8th, but there will be no show that day. I will be out at PAX East in Boston, and I believe we're going to have a thread on the forums.

54:53.000 --> 54:58.000
I think Hit Stone was going to start something. If you are going to be at PAX East, please visit our forums.

54:58.000 --> 55:04.000
We're hoping to do like a VOG meetup at some point during the convention. We'd love to just meet up with some fans.

55:04.000 --> 55:09.000
I get in an unofficial capacity. I get to talk to you guys and talk some smack about games.

55:09.000 --> 55:15.000
Maybe play some 3DS or go visit the classic gaming display because it's one of my favorite things at PAX.

55:15.000 --> 55:21.000
Check that out. But sadly, because I will be there, there will be no OLR that weekend.

55:21.000 --> 55:26.000
There you go. Follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash OLR.

55:26.000 --> 55:30.000
We're also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio and on Google Plus.

55:30.000 --> 55:39.000
Google.com slash Plus OrangeLoungeRadio where we'll be asking the FUGL question of the week a little later on inspired by our interview tonight, StarMazer.

55:39.000 --> 55:44.000
Let's get into some news. Quite a bit of it this week. Let's get to it. Loki, starting us off tonight with the news.

55:44.000 --> 55:45.000
For a change.

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
Yeah, for a change.

55:46.000 --> 55:53.000
So a new challenger arises in Bethesda, actually doing a press conference at E3.

55:53.000 --> 56:03.000
And they put out a notice basically saying, hey, we're going to be here and it's going to be on the 14th it looks like.

56:03.000 --> 56:10.000
So what could they possibly be announcing or showing off? Obviously something really big.

56:10.000 --> 56:15.000
Fallout 4 maybe? Dishonored 2? Something we haven't heard about yet?

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
Yeah.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
Maybe another Star Trek game?

56:18.000 --> 56:25.000
Well, their little Team Fortress-esque game that they showed at last E3 I don't believe has come out.

56:25.000 --> 56:31.000
So there could be that going on too. I mean, that alone would not necessitate an entire press conference.

56:31.000 --> 56:37.000
But at the same time, and hear me out here, I don't think Fallout 4 necessitates its own press conference either.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.000
Yes it does.

56:38.000 --> 56:45.000
Well, I mean, I'm not trying to belittle that game. Obviously that game is a big deal. But one game is not an entire press conference. Does that make sense?

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
That's true, yeah. They must have a pretty decent lineup too.

56:47.000 --> 56:55.000
Exactly. So looking forward to what they might be bringing out there. The only bummer about that, it's on Sunday night.

56:55.000 --> 57:00.000
Which means that press conference is going to be going on while OLR is happening.

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
That's right, live news, woo!

57:02.000 --> 57:11.000
But it's making E3 week longer and longer because what E3 proper is what Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.

57:11.000 --> 57:19.000
The Microsoft and Sony conferences happen on Monday, as long with what? Is EA and Ubisoft also Monday? I think it is, right?

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
I don't remember these.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
No, EA and Ubisoft are the first day of the show, I think.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.000
Usually, yeah.

57:24.000 --> 57:30.000
But anyway, it's backing up all the way to Sunday now with the Bethesda thing, so E3 week's getting longer and longer.

57:30.000 --> 57:37.000
But hey, I know there's a lot of us out there, myself included, that's like, alright, new Fallout's all fine and good.

57:38.000 --> 57:43.000
Can we get like, just maybe like a frame, just a glimpse, just a peek at the future of Elder Scrolls?

57:43.000 --> 57:44.000
Yes.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.000
I don't mean Elder Scrolls Online.

57:45.000 --> 57:50.000
I'm fine with them even skipping Fallout 4 and doing yet another Elder Scrolls game. I'm totally cool with that.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Some people might disagree with you there.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
I don't care. I really don't care.

57:54.000 --> 58:01.000
BlackWolf in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, Elder Scrolls Online 2, Elder Harder.

58:02.000 --> 58:09.000
Well, I wouldn't be surprised, actually, with all the focus and attention that, hey, new press conference is going to generate.

58:09.000 --> 58:13.000
You know, because they'll be running it on Twitch, there's going to be a lot of eyes on this, I'm sure.

58:13.000 --> 58:16.000
I wouldn't be surprised at all if they try to pimp up.

58:16.000 --> 58:25.000
I wouldn't necessarily say expansion for Elder Scrolls Online, but this is the point where Elder Scrolls Online will have gone subscription-less.

58:25.000 --> 58:30.000
I don't want to say free to play because you still have to buy the game, but there's no subscription fee, which is a huge move for them, right?

58:30.000 --> 58:35.000
It will be on consoles by this point because it's going to be out in April on Xbox One.

58:35.000 --> 58:38.000
I think it was April.

58:38.000 --> 58:44.000
So come June would be a great time to announce what does the next phase of Elder Scrolls Online look like?

58:44.000 --> 58:50.000
Why, now that this game is out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, should I go run out and buy it today?

58:50.000 --> 58:57.000
So even though we sit here and joke about the future of Elder Scrolls, I wouldn't doubt it at all if they actually show,

58:57.000 --> 59:03.000
like, here's what Elder Scrolls Online is going to evolve into, leading to maybe the first expansion or something.

59:03.000 --> 59:08.000
God bless them for trying to make that game work. It got a lot of flak.

59:08.000 --> 59:17.000
I think it came out at a bad time. It launched in a very crowded market, and it's hard to justify a subscription-based game.

59:17.000 --> 59:20.000
Blizzard can kind of get away with it because they're Blizzard.

59:20.000 --> 59:24.000
Square Enix gets away with it because the Final Fantasy brand carries a lot of oomph.

59:24.000 --> 59:33.000
Well, and also the problem is that people are coming off of Elder Scrolls Skyrim, and that's a level of game that they're hoping to play with Elder Scrolls Online.

59:33.000 --> 59:37.000
It's like, oh, it's Skyrim, but it's multiplayer. That's kind of what people wanted.

59:37.000 --> 59:47.000
And then they played it, and they're like, well, it's not quite like that. It's more of just like a typical MMO being reskinned into Elder Scrolls.

59:47.000 --> 59:53.000
So, I don't know, I think there's a little bit of disappointment there. Plus, you know, buggy launches.

59:54.000 --> 59:57.000
Well, moving on to some other news from the week.

59:57.000 --> 01:00:04.000
I was also going to mention, they're not the only company that has booked a venue for E3.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Nintendo has also booked a huge theater for this year's E3 as well, and we'll have to see what plans they have for that as well.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Wait, a huge theater? I thought it was more like...

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Well, it's $2.99.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000
We did Rocky Horror in a 450c theater last night.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
It's a small theater for...

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.000
But, yeah, okay. Wow. That's a small theater.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Maybe, are they going to do nothing with the theater, but maybe have that dinner smash tournament? Because that'd be pretty cool.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Oh, that's a thought, that maybe they were going to run some type of tournament there.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Maybe, you know, a lot of people are thinking, like, is this a press event?

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Splatoon tournament?

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Is Nintendo coming back to do a press thing? But, tournament sounds like a really good idea.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Maybe, I don't know. You'd think they got to tap into that fan base, that rabid fan base that Nintendo has somehow.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:01:00.000
And if they could have, like, a public venue. But, man, only 299 seats, though. Everybody would be clamoring for that.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Yeah, I'm thinking...

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Here's another great example of Nintendo's supply not matching demand. Only 299 seats in this theater.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:11.000
What? That's like how many people are buying the console, right?

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
299 US seats.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:24.000
No, no. There's plenty more people lining up for those amiibo. There's probably 299 people in line, at Fry's, trying to get one of those Majora's Mask 3DS's. It's pretty crazy.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
So...

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Alright. Dark Tetsuya agrees with you in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, saying, I was just thinking, a Splatoon tournament, perhaps?

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
So, anyway...

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:42.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On's Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, GAS.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Let's talk about some news that kind of struck me by surprise. In Dark Soccer, I don't know if you were looking forward to this game. You're the resident BioWare fangirl.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:57.000
So, I don't know if you knew a lot about this game, but it was Shadow Realms, which was the four-on-one dungeon crawler that BioWare was working on.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:04.000
It was cancelled this past week, which kind of takes me by surprise. I don't know if that took you by surprise.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I have no idea what that game is.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:17.000
A lot of people were saying it was like Evolve, because it was a full four-on-one type of thing, but it's got the BioWare in it, so I would imagine it was more story-driven and a little more RPG-driven.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:23.000
What is one of the biggest complaints people have about Evolve? There's no single-player mode, right?

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:31.000
So, I would assume, and again, I'm making an assumption, but I would assume that Shadow Realms maybe was addressing some of that in the game that they were making.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:38.000
But we'll never know, because they made the decision this past week to not move forward on the development of Shadow Realms.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:46.000
I would like to see one of these four-on-one games be completely unfair. It's like the four people are Brave Warriors versus one baby.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Well, now, there have been no layoffs announced at BioWare Austin, which, fingers crossed, it'll stay that way.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:04.000
They have said that they are shifting resources over to continued enhancements to Star Wars The Old Republic, speaking of a crowded MMO space.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:15.000
You know, The Old Republic is free-to-play, and it's worth checking out if you're even remotely interested in Star Wars, but it sounds like some of these resources are going to make that game grow a little bit there.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:22.000
And more enhancements to Dragon Age Inquisition. I'm not sure what that means, because that's a game that's already launched. Is that more DLC, perhaps?

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Wolf Hunt, Wolf Hunt, Wolf Hunt, Wolf Hunt.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Dark Sakura has her wish list over there that she would like Austin to consider working on there.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Also, other Mass Effect, whatever the future is for Mass Effect, and, quote, other new IP. Wasn't there another science fiction game that BioWare-

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Negiturian's the game. No, I'm kidding.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Wasn't there another BioWare franchise, like a new IP, science fiction IP they're working on that is not Mass Effect?

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.000
I don't know.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
I don't think it was this, either.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000
I don't know.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Maybe a mystery IP.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Dragon Age in space!

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
That's Mass Effect, Loki. That's Mass Effect.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
No, it's not.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Mass Effect in medieval time.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000
No, they're not.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
That's Dragon Age.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
That's not.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Medieval Mass Effect in space.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:14.000
It isn't, because there is no planet on Mass Effect where you will fucking spend 40 hours running-

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
In the Hinterlands!

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000
If the Hinterlands were a planet.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Alright, anyway.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Hinterworlds.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Hinterworlds.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Alright, DarkStalker, what do you have for us in the news?

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I've got some stuff. Interesting stuff.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:36.000
In fact, so interesting that it was- I actually stopped and went, really?

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Apparently Square Enix Holdings have filed separate trademark applications for Squaresoft and Enix.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:53.000
This was posted by a Japanese trademark bot Twitter account.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:59.000
That basically anytime a trademark is filed, it pulls it from trade journals and makes it public.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:06.000
So this was posted on January 19th that Square Enix posted the two trademark applications.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Again, Squaresoft, which was the former Square brand, and then one for Enix.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:14.000
So take that for what you will.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:22.000
It could just be possible that they're trying to make sure that those names don't get taken up once any expiration has occurred.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
But, there you go.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
I'd say take that for what you will.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Which, I really don't know how to read into that.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Like, I think obviously we have to address the first conclusion some people might jump to is that Square Enix is gonna split?

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
No.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
No, that's not gonna happen.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Well, especially since we've got so many different merging IPs with them now.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Right, and don't forget, Eidos is a factor now too. I mean, if that were to happen, what would happen to Tomb Raider?

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Like, you know, that's not really a thing. I don't see that happening.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
All I care is that we get another bus to move.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Maybe, and you know what, if that's the whole reason for this to happen, then I am totally fine with it.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Goddammit, we're gonna make bus move, even if we have to leave.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000
And have it not be that dance summit. Even though dance summit was fun.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
It needs to be old school bus to move.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000
I would be happy.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
I would love that if that's the reason. Could it be maybe that, like,

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Can we end the game?

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Could there be, like, mobile phone development under one, but I don't, like, I think there already

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
I think it's more of a protection.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Ah.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:40.000
To keep other people, you know, because especially if you, you know, if you also notice this, the tweets also did have trademark category 16.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Which refers to printed materials, like video game manuals, magazines, strategy guides.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:54.000
So, I think it's more or less something just to protect past holdings.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
So, take that for what you will.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:04.000
That's a very good thought, and that's probably really all this is, is so that Loki can't go in there and say,

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Oh, I'm going to make bus to move part 3, and I'm going to make it under Enix because there's no longer a trademark for that.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:20.000
However, however, we should actually just, like, form a company for shits called Squeenix.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000
And we do nothing but sell squeaky hammers. Squeenix! Maybe.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Love it. Alright. Let's travel around the world and check out what game releases are coming out this week in game stores.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:38.000
If anything at all. I know it's a slower time of year, but we did have Evolve last week.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Uh, Loki, what's it look like in the US?

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000
I have fucking no idea.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Oh, and we had the new 3DS. Let me not leave that out.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Well, no.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
This weekend, those Friday, Nintendo's Friday thing always freaking kills me.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Oh, God. Yeah, you know, I don't know.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Nintendo's like on their own page as far as like when they're going to release stuff.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.000
And that was, it was funny enough, when I first started, you know, back when I was selling video games,

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
when I first started doing that, it was just like, oh, hey, you know what?

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Um, we're going to go ahead and just release shit whenever we want.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Then everybody kind of got on board with how the movie industry works and, oh, we're going to release shit now on Tuesdays.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
And everything was cool.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Except for fucking Nintendo, who decided, hey, we're going to release shit now on Fridays.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Or Sundays. Or God knows whenever it doesn't fucking matter because we're going to pick whenever we release shit.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
So that's, that's my story there.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Anyways, so I was going to mention, let's see here.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
God, I hate fucking website redesigns here.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.000
If someone wants to go ahead, I'm still waiting on this shit to load.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:51.000
No problem. I can go ahead and jump over to Japan and check out the Japanese releases of what's coming out in these next few days in Japan.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Dead or Alive 5, which I actually think is one of the releases here in the States this week, Logan.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Oh, that's right. Yeah, the re-release, yeah.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Dead or Alive 5 is making its way to Japan as well on the PlayStation 4.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Dead or Alive 5 last round in the collector's edition and what they called the Sakyuu package is making its way to Japan on the 19th.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
That is on the PlayStation 4.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Also, God Eater 2 Rage Burst is out in Japan this week on the PlayStation 4.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:23.000
And Terraria gets its Japanese retail release this week on the PlayStation 4 as well.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Over on the Xbox One, Dead or Alive 5 will make its way there for those of you, yea, few, but loyal who have the Xbox One over in Japan.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000
On the PlayStation 3, of course, Dead or Alive 5 on its way there as well.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:45.000
And it is worth noting that there, with the release of Dead or Alive 5, you also have all these new fighting sticks and joysticks and so forth to celebrate the release of that.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Nothing on the 360 in Japan this week, but looking at the Wii U, I don't believe has anything until March.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:58.000
No, I lied. No, I didn't lie because that date I'm looking at is for the US next week for Kirby.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Mario Party 10 is the next release in March on the Wii U.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:06.000
In Japan on the PlayStation Vita, God Eater 2 Rage Burst is on the Vita as well.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Fur Ayaki 3 comes out as well.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Otoko Yukaku comes out as well.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:23.000
And there's actually a new Vita pack, a debut pack Wi-Fi model in what they call blue black, red black, and there's a crystal black 3G Wi-Fi model.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.000
I didn't even know they were still putting those out, but those are all coming out in Japan this week, obviously.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Probably the Japanese culture lends itself a little differently to the 3G.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:35.000
That's it, nothing on the 3DS this week.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:41.000
I was going to mention, you pretty much hit it on the head, it's just Dead or Alive 5 last round for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000
And Kirby and the Rainbow Curse for the Wii U. That's literally it.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:52.000
This is honestly, I gotta say, just looking at what's come out this year so far, it's been the slowest year as far as releases.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Like, even in January, there's usually some stuff coming out, but it was, like, dead.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.000
And so far in February, it's been dead.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Do you think this means that we're going to have a really crowded holiday or summer period?

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:10.000
I don't know what it means. I think it's just kind of going on that trend where we're getting less of the fringe and more of, like,

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000
these big projects that they're working on instead of releasing.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:18.000
You know, big AAA titles instead of just releasing a bunch of titles, they're just releasing a few really good titles.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Well, to be fair, I mean, Evolve was a pretty big deal, and that just, I mean, maybe not for me personally,

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000
but I know a lot of people were really looking forward to that, and that was, you know, just this last week.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Yeah, I understand that, but, I mean, what else have we really had this year?

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.000
We had Saints Row, Gata out of Hell, Dying Light, and Evolve.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I mean, that's three games in the course of, you know, a month and a half.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Yeah, it has been a little slower. A month and a half.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Yeah.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Dark Sakura, how about the UK? Is it slow over there, too?

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Yeah, a little. We've got, on the 19th, the Order 1886 on PlayStation 4.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:57.000
And then on the 20th, there's Dead or Alive 5 last round on everything, pretty much.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000
That's it.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Alright.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Oh, and I'm sorry, there was a little bit of a bigger one that I completely missed.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Uh-oh.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
The Order 1886 is actually coming out.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Oh, is that this week?

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.000
That's on the 20th.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Oh, I thought that was next week.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I thought that game had been delayed, to be honest.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:21.000
You know what it is? I don't realize we're as late in February as we are.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Like, that is really throwing me for a loop.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Like, oh my god, the 20th is in this next week?

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
I just crazy care about the game.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:31.000
I don't know, but, yeah, so the Order 1886, that's coming out as well.

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Well, that is a pretty big deal, Loogie.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Alright.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
For some people, for some people.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
It's one that some PlayStation 4 owners have been waiting for.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week.

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Loogie, you got a pretty big one.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Alright, so, I, you know, I can't say that I'm surprised, because I'm not.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Because I've been seeing this since Fable 2, I guess.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Um, Peter Molyneux, backing, you know, he can't live up to his hype, I guess.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000
And so, for example, Goddess.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Um, there was the whole contest that was based around that stupid curiosity.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
What the fuck is in the cube?

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Let's waste your time clicking on the cube.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
You know, that bullshit.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:24.000
And, fucking, the winner of that was supposed to get, you know, basically be a god in the game.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:31.000
And they were gonna get, like, part of, you know, the proceeds, or part of the revenue from the game or something like that.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:40.000
And, two years after this contest has ended, still hasn't fulfilled his promise to the winner.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:44.000
And, that's just really stupid.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:53.000
And, on top of that, you know, Goddess, I think is, I still think it's very early in all the, like, features and stuff that they were talking about it.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:00.000
It's just not up to where it needs to be at this point, especially since the Kickstarter ended, what I think.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
It was a while ago.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
A while ago, yeah. So, they haven't fulfilled a lot of the rewards for the backers.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:12.000
They are, you know, cutting features that they were, you know, promising that they would be doing.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
It's just, it's a big old fucking mess.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:19.000
And, I want to say that it was, they had a Rock Paper Shotgun article or something that called them out on that kind of thing.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Which, I didn't even really read it because I just heard it was just, it's...

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:32.000
It was, it was hard to read because, I mean, I get that there are people out there that want to ask hard hitting questions.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:38.000
And, I think you can do that. But, I felt their approach was very tactless.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.000
I mean, the very first question in the interview is, are you a pathological liar?

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.000
And, what kind of tone does that set?

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000
I mean, I think that's just kind of fucking rude.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.000
I mean, I realize that this game is stumbling and so forth.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:57.000
But, you know, this guy is, whether you love him or hate him, he's worked very hard in the game industry.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:02.000
And, he's made some incredibly notable influential games.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Whether you like him or not, you know, I just feel like that kind of question...

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000
There's a way to ask that without kind of being a dick.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Like, instead of that, why not ask, you know, why notice in your Kickstarter campaign you said X, Y, and Z would happen.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Here we are 18 months later and X, Y, Z hasn't happened.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Can you explain why these situations seem to continue to happen out of your company?

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:33.000
I think there's a much better tactful way to ask a hard question than, are you a fucking liar?

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Which, you know, is basically what I read when I read a question like that about being a pathological liar.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.000
That was really rough, I think.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:52.000
And, I mean, I don't know. I've been saying that, you know, especially when they're talking about how important the dog would be in Fable 2 and shit.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:59.000
And it just wasn't that. Or like, you know, when they're talking up Fable 3 and when they're talking up just like...

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:03.000
I don't know, just pretty much anything I hear him hyping up.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
I can't get hyped up about it because I know it's full of shit.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Or, it's not full of shit, but it's like he's talking up stuff like it's evolutionary, like this is the first time ever that something's happened like this.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.000
And it's just not. It's just like a normal feature in a game.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Let me go to some comments from our chat room. Bobby Blackwolf, our pal here at VoG, giving us some insight in the chat over at live.vognetwork.com saying,

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:32.000
I've met Molyneux. Here's the thing. The problem with him is that he loves games too much and he loves talking about them.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:39.000
He loves talking about his ideas, but we all take his ideas as absolute final features in a finished product.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
He doesn't see them as that way, but that doesn't come across.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:47.000
His love of games is infectious even if you only sit and talk to him for two minutes.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Well, let me... I mean, when you... I get that. I totally get that.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:58.000
But now you have this Kickstarter thing, which maybe wasn't a factor before in Molyneux's career,

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:03.000
which was now, do you think, and I ask everybody, not just Bobby, like everybody I'm asking this question,

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:10.000
do you think that maybe with Molyneux kind of dreaming big, that led to saying things in the Kickstarter

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:14.000
that maybe they didn't really have the plan on how they were going to get there?

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Well, that's the problem though. But if you've been in game development that long,

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.000
then you should be able to know what you're capable of accomplishing.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:26.000
And I'm sorry, I don't buy that he's so passionate about games that he's fucking terrible

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.000
at figuring out what his company's able to do in a timely manner.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.000
I mean, that's the thing. He's been in the game industry for a while.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:40.000
He should know how to hit deadlines, know about how to make sure that the features

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
that he's promising are going to be in there.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.000
Because he's had the answer to people before about games.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.000
They didn't just say, yeah, Fable 2 is going to be this fucking amazing game

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:54.000
that's going to be super immersive and that's going to be online multiplayer, blah, blah, blah, or whatever.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:58.000
And then just totally back down on that. I mean, he's got to answer to somebody.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:04.000
He's not new to this, and I just don't buy that this late into the game

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
that he doesn't know what he's doing.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:12.000
But I just have to say on this whole thing, this just continues this really unfortunate trend

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:17.000
that has existed in gaming for a long time, has really come up to a head this past year

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:23.000
where there's just a real lack of respect in gaming, and it's really sad to see happen.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.000
There's always going to be differences of opinion, depending on how you believe

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:32.000
a game's journalism website should or should not be run, or how a game should or should not be made,

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000
and who should or should not have a say in the making of those games.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000
We're all going to have differing opinions on that. That's going to happen.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:42.000
But we need to show a little respect for those diversities of opinions.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.000
That is something that has been gravely lacking, and we've really seen this come to a head,

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000
especially in the past year, and it's sad.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Well, they're driving away people that, you know, like he mentioned, you know,

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:59.000
I'm not going to talk to press anymore, you know, and even like look at Notch, you know,

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
he kind of had the same thing where he's like, well, I'm not going to talk to you people anymore

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
because you're being fucking rude to these people.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:10.000
If gamers can't get over this respect, and I'm sorry, and I hate to call this out,

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:17.000
but it is what it is. That Rock Paper Shotgun interview is an example of what I believe to be a lack of respect.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000
Once again, though, just like even like, I hate to try to cross paths here,

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.000
but even like with like the whole gamer gate crap that's going on there,

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:30.000
you have to also remember one thing, that you can't judge one person by the whole industry

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:33.000
or whole group of people. Like, just because they were dicks in their article

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:38.000
doesn't mean that like every game outlet out there is going to be dicks to you.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.000
I mean, same with, you know, gamers. Just because one gamer is a fucking asshole

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.000
and is like being mean to people on the internet doesn't mean everybody does that.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000
You can't make these broad generalizations.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:57.000
However, and I will point out the hashtag not all men and yes all women,

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:04.000
just because it is a group of people that are behaving that way and not the entire thing,

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:08.000
you don't know if the people that you're talking to are among them.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:12.000
If you see it so public and it has happened so often,

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:18.000
you're going to have a fear of speaking to anybody associated with that group.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:21.000
You have to protect yourself if you can't deal with it.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Which is why I think we need to get away from groupthink in the first place.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Indeed, but that's how society is born.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.000
No matter what your angle is, you have to get away from groupthink.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.000
But that's how society is.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.000
I understand that, but society, there's many people everywhere.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000
You're going to just, might as well just close yourself in a closet and hide.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000
There's people like that.

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Well, I'm sorry, but I mean, you can't just, that has not an excuse that,

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
oh, there's a few people doing it, so now I have to assume everybody is.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:51.000
If you have had nothing but this negative experience, it's reinforced it every time it happens.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Then you need to get out in the world and have more experiences.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Hold on, hold on. I think, I think, and trying to move on and move the show forward,

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.000
I think also it's important for, you know, we're talking about two extremes here.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:05.000
And I think that's why it's important for the rest of us in the middle to say to the mean people,

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:11.000
hey, shut up, let this person have their say, and let's have a respectful dialogue.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:17.000
It's up to the rest of us to not, to basically credit those mean people, if that makes sense.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Well, the whole point is that in order to, in order to keep stuff like this from happening,

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.000
we have to have a method of policing our own pretty much.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.000
People have to be held accountable for the things that they say.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.000
And then, and then it's tough because free speech, you know.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.000
No, free speech has nothing to do with accountability.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.000
I know, I know.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Free speech only, the free speech argument in the Constitution only has to do with discussing the government in acceptable locations.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
It has nothing to do with freedom of consequence.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
But you know someone's thinking it.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:55.000
They're, they're, then they're an idiot and clearly haven't studied U.S. history.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.000
All right.

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Or government.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:03.000
I got to move on in the interest of time because we could probably spend three hours talking about all of the problems in gaming right now.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
But you know, I don't know.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:12.000
I want to see good things happen with the game and I want good things to happen to Peter Molyneux, who I think is a great mind.

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000
But it does sound like, you know, maybe he's bit off a little more and he can chew.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:21.000
Hopefully this whole reserving a little bit, maybe going back into the shell for a little bit,

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:28.000
maybe the good that can come of that is he can really focus on what's important right now and that is making Godus the great game it can be.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.000
And just think, if some more people are mean to other developers, they can make another Law and Order episode out of it.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Don't go there.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Let's go.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Let's go to some more news.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.000
We're going to talk about Banjo-Kazooie.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:45.000
There's a Banjo-Kazooie spiritual successor on its way from Rare Veterans.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Now, keep in mind that, you know, certain IPs are held by certain people.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:53.000
So this isn't, you know, like Banjo-Kazooie sequel.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:59.000
But there is a group of Rare employees who have a new indie team called Playtonic Games.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:09.000
And Playtonic has been publishing some little teasers there about what the spiritual successor to Banjo-Kazooie might look like.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Now, obviously, we don't know what platforms this is going to be on because this is still very early teases.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:21.000
And when I say spiritual successor, I mean like how Mighty No. 9 is a spiritual successor to Mega Man, right?

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Well, anyhow, there's more information that was published in Edge Magazine, which includes some pictures and so forth.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:32.000
That you can take a look at. This is all still very early on, of course.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:39.000
But it is nice to know that fans of Banjo-Kazooie at least have something to look forward to, even if not a direct sequel.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:42.000
I'm totally looking forward to Guitar Flutie.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.000
Let's hope. Let's hope. Guitar Flutie.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.000
One can only hope.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Alright, well let's travel back to a time. Let's go back to a simpler time in games.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
Maybe when Banjo-Kazooie was actually a thing.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000
Actually, you know what? Fuck that. Let's go even further back this week.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Because Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.000
Hey, you guys should be checking out this game this week.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000
It is a classic video game worthy of your attention.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
It's older than a lot of you.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000
This is a real old game this week.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000
It's creaky.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Alright, let's check it out. The classic game of the week.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.000
The classic game of the week is Munchkin.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:30.000
Munchkin was cartridge number 38 in the Magnavox Phillips line of games for the Phillips video pack.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:36.000
We got it on the Odyssey 2 in North America as a game called Casey Munchkin.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:43.000
Which was a reference to the president of the company at the time, Kenneth C. Mencken.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000
So this game was programmed by Ed Averitt.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:50.000
And it was based a lot off of Pac-Man.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
You don't say.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000
But not an exact clone.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Atari, however, got their panties in a bunch.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Because of how similar it was.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Atari had been licensed to produce the first version of Pac-Man at home.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.000
But Munchkin came out before Pac-Man.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Munchkin was out in 1981, a year before Pac-Man was ready for release.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.000
And it was probably better than Pac-Man.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
It's quite a bit better.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
On Atari, on Atari.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:30.000
So an Atari could not convince the court at all to stop the sale of Munchkin.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:31.000
But they did win in appeals.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:37.000
So in 1982, they basically said that Phillips copied Pac-Man.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:42.000
And made alterations only to emphasize the extent to which it deliberately copied.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:46.000
I just want to note, I did kill the sound on the video.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Because that noise does grate a little left.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.000
That is one place where Munchkin was a little weaker, I think.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
That noise does get a little grating.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.000
So I went ahead and killed that soundtrack.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000
Than the Atari version of Pac-Man.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.000
But anyway, the ruling was actually, this is really, really important.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:11.000
Because it was one of the first ones to establish how copyright law applied to computer software.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:19.000
So, that being said, the differences it has from Pac-Man is that there are 12 pills in the game called Munchies.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:20.000
In each maze.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
And they are in four groups of three.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:26.000
But they move through the maze independently and at different speeds.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Depending on how fast one is eaten.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:33.000
The final one moves at exactly the same speed as Munchkin and you have to intercept it.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.000
The super pills are called Blinking Munchies because they flash and change color.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Some of the mazes are invisible as soon as you start moving.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.000
It has a programmable mode where you can make your own mazes.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Because that was like the big thing about The Odyssey.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:55.000
Is that it was, you could include programmable elements into a lot of your games.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:59.000
And keep in mind, The Odyssey 2 was one of the first video game systems I ever played.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Well, it was one of the first, I think, that most people of a certain age ever played.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Because it was all that was there.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.000
Well, yeah.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
I mean, you had the fair trial channel left.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Anyway.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:14.000
So, the boxes where the ghosts regenerate actually rotate.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
So, the ghosts can exit from any side.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
It adds a lot more challenge to it.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
And you can actually enter the boss.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000
If you're powered up, you can actually eat the monsters while they regenerate.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000
It's kind of cool.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000
The monsters are called Munchers and you're called the Munchkin.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.000
You have three Munchers instead of the four ghosts.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:35.000
And Munchkin actually has fewer objects on the game board.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:39.000
But renders them with better color and animation.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000
So, overall, yes.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
Graphically, it's better.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:43.000
It plays better.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
It has a lot more elements to it.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.000
But, there we go.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.000
So, after Munchkin got pushed off.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:57.000
Phillips put out a sequel called Crazy Chase.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Or in the U.S. we got it as Casey's Crazy Chase.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:06.000
Which actually was more of a parody of that whole conflict.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:14.000
By pitting the Munchkin across an insect tree eating opponent called the Dratapillar.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.000
That looked like the centipede from Atari.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000
So, you basically power up and advance.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Not by eating the pills, but by eating the Dratapillar's body.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
And so, that's Crazy's Crazy Chase.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:40.000
And also, the Munchkin character was redesigned to roll through the mazes without a continuous chomping animation like Pac-Man did.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.000
And I actually have both of these games.

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:48.000
A lot of the copies of Casey Munchkin are gone.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.000
I mean, they were tried to round up, destroyed.

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:57.000
And I actually looked into my copy at a thrift store for 25 cents.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Wow.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.000
Yeah.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Along with a copy of Crazy Chase.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.000
So, I got them both.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Wow.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:09.000
Especially considering these games are kind of like, you know, now you see them on those, these games were banned type of specials.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
You know, even though that might be a, you know.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
I don't think it's that terribly hard to find it.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.000
But Casey Munchkin, Casey's Crazy Chase isn't that bad as far as finding a copy.

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:21.000
But Casey Munchkin, because of just the drama around it.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Right.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000
It's kind of a, if you find a copy, keep it.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.000
I don't even care if you have an Odyssey 2.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000
Just keep it.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000
Or is it Odyssey squared?

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000
It's a piece of gaming history one way or the other.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Yes, it is.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
And it's actually a really fun little game.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.000
So.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.000
But maybe on mute with your own soundtrack.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Go to OLR while you play.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
And play it on mute.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Although I will say of all the Pac-Man clones, nothing touches mousetrap.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:54.000
I want to see Casey Munchkin get the 3D, you know.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
I want to see that brought modern day.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
You want Munchkin in the Oculus Rift?

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.000
No, I want to see Munchkin as like a cartoon character.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Like we have a Pac-Man.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
I want to see it ripping off everything.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.000
Hey, if Casey Munchkin can get, you know, can be around.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Can we get Sanic?

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.000
Do you want to see if me, Sanic the Hedgehog.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Sanic the Hodgehog.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:16.000
So, okay.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
So Casey Munchkin checking eBay.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:25.000
It really doesn't, now if you have a complete copy of Casey Munchkin, 20 bucks.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:31.000
There is a, yeah there's a few on here, like there's posters and stuff.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.000
But yeah, you're not really going to pay that much for a copy of Casey Munchkin.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Except, you know, keep in mind, people are generally asking anywhere between 15 to 20 bucks start for it.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Right.

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Which for a Magnavox Odyssey 2 game, that is kind of crazy.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000
So.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:53.000
But these games are getting close to 35 years old, so if you can believe it.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Yeah, they're older than some of you.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
Many of you actually.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Yes.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
I think older than Loki, I think actually.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
Just by a few months.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:03.000
So.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
Are you really that young?

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
Yeah, Loki's what, 34?

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000
In a row?

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Oh wait, that's 37.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.000
There we go.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.000
That's Rob.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000
That's me.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:13.000
No, not till June.

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000
You know what?

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000
Don't age me.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000
Faster than I need to.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.000
You know what?

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.000
What?

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:19.000
I'm still older than you, so shut up.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000
I know, I know.

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.000
And I'm broken.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
I have to get a hip replacement, y'all.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Well it's okay, Dorian Gray over there, you know, Bobby Blackwolf, he's been what, you know, what age has he been for the last?

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.000
29.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.000
He's been 29.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
He's been 29 for like a long time, so.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
You just don't look at the painting, Bobby.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
That's all you have to do.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Alright, alright.

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
There it is.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Your classic game of the week.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Munchkin, or KC Munchkin as the case may be.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Yes.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000
For the Odyssey.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Alright.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Again, play on mute.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000
But you know what was the best?

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.000
What?

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Crypt equip.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Have you done that as a game of the week?

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000
I don't think you have.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000
I don't think I have.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000
You may have to bring that up.

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
Oh, cryptologic or whatever the fuck they called it.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Yeah.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Where you basically, it just, it's the word scramble is all it is.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000
That game was fun.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Hey, still, you know, it was probably one of the first on a television.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
I think I did Quest for the Rings before.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Yes, that one you did.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000
I remember that one.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000
I remember that one.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Anyway, we'll talk during the break about more classic games.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.000
I was in second grade.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
But we're gonna take a quick break, guys.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:23.000
When we come back, there's plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come, including the forum follow-up, the FUGL question of the week.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:34.000
We will get to your calls when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Live this evening on February the 15th of 2015 with episode number 587 of our program.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:55.000
Hope you guys all had a good Valentine's Day, however you chose to celebrate it.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:59.000
I'm sure there's some of you out there that say, well, it's Singles Awareness Day.

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Well, I hope you found a pet to love because, you know, we love our pets here at Orange Lounge Radio, our kitties and puppies.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:14.000
So, you know, this is always a good time to remind you guys to consider adopting a pet if you need someone to love on Valentine's Day.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:20.000
And even if you already have a human being, you know, couples could always use pets, right?

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.000
I think all of us here in the room have some pets. We do love pets.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Some of our significant others are pets.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
That's another way to look at it. Absolutely.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
I have two pets, Dan and the cat.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
There you go. There you go.

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.000
All right, let's get into tonight's forum follow-up.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:47.000
Over at the forums over at vognetwork.com, forums.vognetwork.com, every week I try to select a few posts,

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:54.000
talk about here on the show kind of following up what we talked about on last week's program.

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:59.000
And even though I had made a few posts this week, I didn't get a lot of feedback on them,

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:06.000
but there was this one, which did actually get quite a few responses, so I thought I'd bring this post up, and that was about educational games.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:11.000
And you might remember at the end of last week's show, Dark Soccer, I think, or maybe it was Loki,

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:16.000
was talking about a Doctor Who game that actually helps teach children to code.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.000
And it was kind of part of a broader BBC initiative.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.000
And it had me thinking about educational games.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.000
And I know we've had a FUGO question probably very similar to this in the past,

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:32.000
but usually when educational games comes up, the same games are always named, right?

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000
What do we think of right off the bat?

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.000
Carmen Sandiego, Number Munchers, and Oregon Trail, right?

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000
Those are like the big three. Turtle.

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Yeah, well, I mean, but then there's those that I think we're a little more attached to,

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:48.000
and I wanted to ask on the forums, what games really shaped you?

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:55.000
What do you remember playing, and what do you look back on and say, yes, that game actually had an impact on me?

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.000
Like, for example, one game that I remember, it was an educational game from my youth,

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:03.000
and one that I mentioned here was a game called Weather Tamers on the Commodore 64.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:08.000
And a lot of y'all probably never heard of this game, and it was, you know, it was a very kind of under-the-radar game.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:15.000
But in college, when I originally started college, believe it or not, I know some of you might find this hard to believe,

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:20.000
I wanted to be a weatherman at first, and that was something I was learning to do.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:26.000
And I would actually say that game had a little bit, not total influence on that, but had a little bit of influence on that.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.000
And that was a Commodore 64 game where you had, like, a giant map,

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:34.000
and you could move, like, high pressure and low pressure around to kind of, I don't want to say you played God,

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:41.000
but you definitely, like, could control the weather, and the goal was to make certain weather situations in towns.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:48.000
So it was kind of a way to learn geography as well as, you know, what makes rain, what makes snow, what makes tornadoes, and things like that.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:52.000
So that was a game that I remember, was Weather Tamers.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.000
So some of you guys in our forums responded to this as well.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Bobby Blackwell mentioned a game called Agent USA, and in this game you would learn cities and states,

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:06.000
and you had to type them in exactly. This also helped you learn about time zones.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.000
That would affect it when you would get somewhere, and you needed to know what cities were state capitals,

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:16.000
because that's where you got the better trains, and he goes on to say, I never beat it as a kid.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:21.000
SSG100Matt shared a game called Memory Manor, which was on the ColecoVision,

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:26.000
saying that I remember playing this game back in first grade on the Coleco Adam computer system.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:32.000
You play as a window washer with a helping helicopter trying to clean windows that have corresponding symbols on them.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:40.000
It forces you to memorize the windows and strategically place your washing fluid supply so you can clean windows efficiently.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:44.000
So it's kind of like a, you know, it's in the title there. It was Memory. It was a play on the game Memory.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:50.000
And Odell Lake was mentioned too, and I saw a lot of people on Twitter, because I talked about this post on Twitter,

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:55.000
and a lot of people were responding with Odell Lake, and SSG100Matt saying, I played this in grade school.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.000
This is a very popular game among the kids in my class along with Oregon Trail.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:04.000
This is a play for points kind of educational game, but I remember doing worksheets that were supplied by the game.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:13.000
The object was to play as a certain kind of fish and make decisions as to which fish or bacteria to eat, chase, ignore, or swim away in deep or shallow water.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:19.000
I remember that it was cool to be the rainbow trout so you could eat just about anything except the otter and osprey.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Flaco Jones shares that he also appreciated Odell Lake, but one thing I remember fondly about the Commodore 64 was the plastic piano overlay

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:38.000
that was only used for a few games including Commodore Music Maker, and I don't even remember this.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:43.000
I was a big Commodore 64 fan. I never saw that plastic overlay. That is awesome.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:47.000
There's a little YouTube here he linked in our forums saying, I didn't stick with it, but I wish I had,

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:54.000
because looking back it seems like an awesome way to teach music. I was too busy messing around with it. Awesome.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Loki, you responded too that you also loved Odell Lake.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Yeah, I completely forgot about it. It was a fun game to play, and I think I was also in the rainbow trout so you could eat everything.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:12.000
What was it about that game that you remember? See, somehow this one was not on my radar. I never really played this game growing up.

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:17.000
I mean, I kind of get why people like it now, but I missed out on it, unfortunately. It wasn't at my school, I guess.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:22.000
I don't remember, to be honest. Why I liked it, I think, is because I got to eat things. That's funny.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.000
You got to eat things.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:27.000
Same reason why you got to hunt and kill everything in the hunting parts in the Oregon Trail.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:33.000
And now look at it all these years later. What does he do? He comes on OLR and he likes to eat things. There it is.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:39.000
And I like to shoot things in video games. How we've changed.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Thank you guys for your responses. I'll be posting some follow-up topics throughout the week over at our forums at vognetwork.com.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Check it out and feel free to start your own topic. You don't have to wait for me to say something.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:52.000
What is it that they have in computer labs nowadays?

01:38:52.000 --> 01:39:02.000
That's a really good question. I don't know. You will be finding that out pretty soon, I imagine, when Josh gets ready to start grade school and so forth.

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.000
Yeah, but not for a couple of years.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:12.000
It's still a few years away. Maybe our chat room can help us out. Maybe those that have children in grade school, because I know some of our listeners have children.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:15.000
What do they look like nowadays? I'd be very curious as well.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:20.000
So I'm sure they're not playing the old ass copy of Floppy Dizzy. What the fuck is this?

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:26.000
No, but I imagine at a very young age they are probably teaching typing. You know, how to properly type.

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:30.000
And there's probably a lot of games that reinforce that because it's so important.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:42.000
I would hope at a younger age there are simulations and experiences that talk about privacy online and how to be careful what you write in an email and things like that.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:46.000
I hope they're kind of sharing those types of things as well.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:53.000
I'd be curious if our chatters know the answers to that question. What do computer labs look like nowadays? I want to know.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:59.000
Meanwhile, while we wait for some answers to that question, let's go through some rapid fire news tonight. Loki.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:07.000
Alright. Yeah, because honestly if they're not going to have, well I'm sure they have updated versions of The Oregon Trail.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:17.000
The Binding of Isaac Rebirth. It's going to be getting some DLC which they're titling after birth. That's awesome.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Oh lord.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:26.000
They said it should easily extend the gameplay time by another 100-200 hours. Which is just ridiculous.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Wow.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:34.000
Things that it will include. Over 100 new items in the game. A full new game mode that will totally change how you play.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:46.000
New challenges, new playable character, alternate final chapter, new alternate floors, new game ending, new bosses, new items, new co-op babies, new transformations.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Sounds like a whole new game. So that should be coming out later on this year. So I'll take a look at it.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:04.000
And then, this is kind of cool, new features coming out to the Xbox One. Even though it is something that we've been able to do on PC and other consoles.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:10.000
But now, the Xbox One is going to be able to take screenshots and you'll be able to share the screenshots.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:18.000
And how do we know this? Because Phil Spencer took a screenshot and shared said screenshot using the feature over Twitter.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:24.000
And so, that's pretty cool. You'll be able to do that as well as video and stuff.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:30.000
And then this is all sorts of exciting. This brings me back to like, Urguts.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:40.000
But they announced that Final Fantasy Disidea is going to be getting a brand new arcade game.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:46.000
And you know, basically a 3 on 3 battle game. And it looks awesome.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:50.000
And they're not necessarily going to be talking about details of the game on April 10th.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:57.000
So happy to hear that arcades are still getting games that are not just ticket spitters. Except Japan only, right?

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:04.000
I'm just saying though, hey, I'm all for the arcades getting this game. But can we get this game too? Because it looks awesome.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Only if it shoots out tickets. Is the only way you're going to see it over here, probably.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:19.000
Hey, Nintendo. There you go. Have it spit out tickets that you can go redeem at, well since they're embedded GameStop. Go redeem at GameStop.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Alright, well some news I have is PlayStation made some announcements about the PlayStation Network this week about converting what they call a sub account to a master account.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:37.000
Now a lot of our listeners might not be very familiar with this unless you, again, have children at home of a certain age.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Probably like a young teenager. You may have had that teenager have a sub account.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:52.000
And what this was is this was a way that somebody under the age of 18 could access PlayStation Network but parents or guardians would still manage the online experience.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:59.000
So you have these sub accounts. Well PlayStation announced this week you will now be able to upgrade those sub accounts to master accounts.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:06.000
I mean PlayStation Network's been really up and running full speed since PlayStation 3. I mean some could argue PlayStation 2.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:14.000
But it's really been full speed since PlayStation 3. PlayStation 3 launched almost 10 years ago now. It was 2006 when PS3 launched, right?

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:23.000
So next year will be the 10 year anniversary. So a lot of those 14 and 15 year olds that might have had some of these sub accounts are going to be 24 and 25.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:32.000
So then again, I don't know how long they've been offering sub accounts. But regardless, folks are getting older and they move on and might want to keep that old PlayStation account.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:38.000
So they can now migrate it from a sub account to a master account. More information available on the official PlayStation blog.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:42.000
We'll need a size zero Phillips screwdriver to do such training.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Stop. One of the producers over at Capcom, Ray Jimenez, would like to see a Bayonetta and Devil May Cry crossover.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:59.000
As I think a lot of us would like to see. So this quote, definitely raising some eyebrows this week.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Quote, as a developer and a gamer, I would love to do that and how that would happen. Well, let me just say to you, that would be the most insane Gonzo action game you would ever see with tag team back and forth switching and combos with stylish Dante or whoever coming in and doing stuff.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:18.000
It would actually be a dream come true. I'm sure with Capcom it's possible to do really cool things, but I don't know if this would ever happen.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:24.000
But I can't deny that the thought of it would be totally mind-blowing. I'm sure Platinum would be on board with doing something crazy.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Just like Tim Gunn says, make it work. Figure out the license. Make it work.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:43.000
Between the two companies, if I were to take a guess or stab at who would not be on board with it, I would say it's Capcom. If Capcom's on board with it, then there should be no fucking problem with it.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
They should be able to do it.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:59.000
Well, we'll see. We'll see. Also, one other story here. We mentioned earlier about Ubisoft and the Wii U, and we know that Ubisoft kind of pulled their support of the Wii U and ended up canceling a few titles in the process.

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:08.000
Well, some more information surfaced this week about what one of those Wii U titles was. It was actually a little bit of a party game. It was a game called Know Your Friends.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:23.000
This was dug up this week, and it was a quiz game that was developed by Ubisoft Paris, and it sounds like it was kind of a spiritual successor of sorts to We Dare, because some of the questions were flirtatious and maybe inappropriate.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:27.000
And by all means, I'm glad they cancelled it. It sounds fucking terrible.

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:36.000
Yeah, I think a lot of people were thinking like, oh man, Ubisoft cancelled Zombie U 2, they suck, but then you hear that they cancelled this, and you're like, oh, well maybe.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Assassin's Creed 4 on Wii U still?

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
I don't think it was, actually.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:52.000
So there you go. In fact, I'm pretty sure it wasn't, because I think that was a lot of the rabble rabble from fans behind that because of that.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:56.000
Anyhow, are we on 4 or 5? I don't even remember what the fucking Assassin's Creed were on that.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Wait, 4 is Black Flag. That was the last one, wasn't it?

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
I think Black Flag was that one.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Sorry, I can't keep track of them anymore.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
Alright, Dark Sakura.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Well, if you are a fan of Shingeki no Kyojin, which is also Attack on Titan, Capcom's making an arcade game.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:20.000
God, it's like arcade resurgence again.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:26.000
I know. You get to get eaten by huge giants and hide behind walls.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:32.000
Actually, the whole thing is I would love to see how they actually incorporate the 3D defense.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.000
Yes, you should be able to strap into some sort of rig that kind of...

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
Yeah, that would be fun.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:44.000
What if it was all that third, first person, or you had a motion control that showed up?

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:47.000
I can't imagine how awesome that game would be.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:56.000
At any rate, Atlas USA is rumored on doing a localization to Nintendo 3DS of a game based off of the anime.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
So, who knows?

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:01.000
I just wish we could get more anime because it was awesome.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:07.000
I think the last thing I watched were those first two seasons of Attack on Titan and then I watched Kill la Kill.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
Where is the second season?

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:14.000
Yeah, there were two seasons. Not localized.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
Damn it.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
I need the second season then.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:21.000
I can't speak Japanese, so you know.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
Sounds like Dark Soccer's offering to help you out over there.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:27.000
No, I'll just... fine. Internet. We'll do it.

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Internet!

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Insert eye roll here.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:35.000
It's okay. He won't stop and ask for directions either.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:39.000
So, you know what? This is the big bullshit.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:51.000
The whole transferring your old 3DS data to the new 3DS is really not so straightforward and people are complaining about it a lot.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:58.000
And Nintendo finally is just like, look, this is how you do it. Here's a video. Get over it.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:06.000
But it is worth noting that a lot of people are really fixated on the whole screwdriver, take the thing out and all this.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:12.000
And you can also transfer over Wi-Fi. It just takes a long time to do it that way.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Do it overnight.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Or do it while you're listening to OLR, right?

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:24.000
But also I think one thing to consider is that if you have a big card in your DS now, you're gonna have to get a big card in the new 3DS.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
And you're gonna have to buy a power supply.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Or you're gonna be doing the screwdriver trick.

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:42.000
So, it's a little... I mean, I think we live in a world where computers in the 1990s, I take a disk out of this computer and I put it in this computer and I can access everything on it.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:48.000
And it's like, I think the fact that it's not that easy with Nintendo is what's blowing people's minds.

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:55.000
I don't understand why you have the microSD card hidden behind a compartment that requires a screwdriver to open it up.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:03.000
As far as I'm aware, there are SD card slots that can do the microSD cards and...

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:08.000
The same reason there's no charger. Every nickel and dime.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Or it's still a proprietary charger instead of, I don't know, USB like every other fucking device on the planet.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:26.000
Anyway, Mortal Kombat X, I wanna say 10 but it's X, is going to try to have more realistic portrayals of women.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:30.000
While you're chopping body parts off and breaking faces and shit.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Unless, of course, those realistic portrayals of women include them being part B, in which case, yes, that is true.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:45.000
Basically, they said that we always wanted to be realistic, you know, like really realistic I guess.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:52.000
But they wanted to try to get proportions back to what would be on a normal athletic woman.

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:59.000
You know, not like overly too big boobs that would smack you in the face like dead or alive.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Cause I'm sorry, cause like, yes, the ginormous breasts are what they're gonna see in Mortal Kombat.

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:13.000
Not the, you know, doing an uppercut into someone's groin or perhaps, you know, breaking body parts in x-ray mode and stuff like that.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Or ripping someone in half. Yes, but it's the giant breasts that they'll notice.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:22.000
I was looking at one of the renders on here. It looks like it's the one of Kitana.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:26.000
And she does actually have like normal hips.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:37.000
A normal, I'd probably say not like, it's still like a supermodel type of level of hip to waist ratio.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:40.000
But it does look like an actual human being.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:46.000
And not like impossibly tiny with huge hips and boobs to infinity.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:51.000
Remember when they did have those proportions accurate because they were actual human beings?

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Right? Back when they were like scanned people.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:51:05.000
But you do have to see a little bit of irony in this game that's like we're not being overly sexual when it is the most over the top violent gore fest thing that's out there.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:10.000
You have to see a little bit of humor in that.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.000
It's the society we live in cause God forbid you show a little bit of nipple.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:20.000
But ripping someone in half and, you know, severing their body parts all over the place, that's okay.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:27.000
And the reason why I bring that up is that I do love the Mortal Kombat series and all its goofy, ridiculous, over the top violence fun.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:32.000
But I don't like movies like Saw and things like that. I've mentioned this before on the show.

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:39.000
But like with Mortal Kombat X there's a lot of where I'm looking at going like, okay, this is starting to look a little too real for me.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:44.000
And I don't know if I'm down with this anymore. I liked it when it was stupid, you know?

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:49.000
And I don't know. I have feelings, Darkstalker. I have a lot of feelings about Mortal Kombat X. Do you have feelings?

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:55.000
Feelings. Oh.

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
I'll take that as a no.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Alright, let's get to the FUGL question of the week.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities and you give us answers.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
It's my vehicle.

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:22.000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio is the place where you can hit us up on social media.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:29.000
And this week we asked a question of our communities inspired by our guests tonight as we usually try to do when we have guests on the show.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:37.000
We asked about with Star Mazer being this point and click and shoot them up gameplay that has really impressive pixel art in the game.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:43.000
We thought, you know, this has us thinking about gorgeous pixel art in some games made out of pixels.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:50.000
Maybe retro, maybe modern, you know, because a game like Star Mazer is modern but still has that retro pixel look.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:56.000
So what is some of your favorite pixel art from across the years and years of gaming?

01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Guillermo R starts us off tonight on Facebook saying the Neo Geo in general served tons of amazing pixel art.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:10.000
The Metal Slug series truly shines by pairing gorgeous, humorous sprites with fluid animation.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:14.000
The upcoming Hyper Light Drifter looks damn beautiful as well.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:18.000
I'm sure Dark Sakura would back that response up. I know she's a Neo Geo fan as well.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
I loves my Neo Geo.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Just play Samurai Showdown, that's all.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Rage Nator says I don't have a single favorite but four that are basically tied.

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:36.000
Metal Slug, Neo Geo, Samurai Showdown 4, Neo Geo, Super Castlevania 4, Super Nintendo, and Actraiser, Super Nintendo.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:41.000
All four are gorgeous, have great sound, and are a blast to play.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:48.000
Surping Slurpee responds and says Final Fantasy, both old school and new, never fails to impress.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:52.000
I have also found Sonic the Hedgehog games aesthetically pleasing.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:57.000
Our answer is over on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.

01:53:57.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Let's head on over to our Google Plus page and look at some of the answers there,

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:07.000
which I notice is getting closer and closer the number of responses we get on Google versus Facebook.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:10.000
We actually had the same number of comments on Google tonight we did on Facebook.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:15.000
I think that's because Facebook just basically doesn't show posts unless we pay to show them,

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:19.000
which don't get me started on that, but a little.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:25.000
So I do urge you, if you want to answer the question each week, make sure you visit our Facebook page directly,

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:31.000
because I can't really afford to throw $20 at Facebook to boost every post.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:34.000
I'd rather use that money somewhere else for the show.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:41.000
Weird that we have to pay them to have the posts that we put to our community shown.

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:42.000
I know, right?

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:45.000
Yet those ads that they want us to see, oh.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:48.000
Anyway, over on Google Plus, some of the answers over there.

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Ronnie B. saying, Minecraft.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Certainly a very contemporary choice that probably owes a lot of its success to its art style.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Reddertainment says, MissNudeWorld96.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Oh, you.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
And lastly, PrincePeachFuzz.

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:08.000
I do love that name.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:14.000
PrincePeachFuzz replies and says, two of my favorites would be KingOfFighters13 and Metalslug2.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:17.000
You know, I've got to say, for a frugal question of the week tonight,

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.000
I was not expecting, but I'm not surprised by, the amount of Neo Geo love there.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:26.000
I mean, like, literally half the answers all had some type of Neo Geo game mentioned in there, so.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Very cool.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Quickly around the room, any pixel art in games that you just, you really are fond of?

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Pixel art.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:36.000
More recently, To The Moon.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:40.000
That one's very, just, pretty overall.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Really harkens back to the look for Final Fantasy VI.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:49.000
And it's really just a great story in pixel form.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:54.000
I would actually throw out there, you know, some of my favorite was from the Super Nintendo era,

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:58.000
and I really loved, you know, again, maybe this is just my fan wank for this game,

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
but The Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:06.000
It was such a different aesthetic at the time than I think we were seeing in a lot of Super Nintendo games.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
So, I mean, the pixel art in that game is just amazing.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:11.000
And honestly, if you want to talk about a true Super Nintendo classic,

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:14.000
look at essentially the very first game they ever put out on it.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Super Mario World, I think, to this day, holds up as some of the pinnacle of pixel art that's out there today.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:22.000
Those are some of my choices.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Loki?

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:29.000
Well, I'm a huge fan of Paul Robinson, and so I have to go with Scott Pilgrim.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:30.000
Oh, okay.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:34.000
That was, it's just awesome.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:42.000
Along with that, it's not really pixel art, but, I don't know, Journey, that was pretty good.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
Yeah, it's not really pixel art.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:45.000
You're cheating.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Broforce, I like Broforce.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Astol.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:49.000
Oh.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:58.000
And actually the 3DO slash Saturn era of, I would say, of pixel games.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:01.000
I mean, look at Symphony of the Night.

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:02.000
Yeah, true.

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:07.000
All the character designs on that, and all of the 3D elements weren't so great on the Saturn,

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:14.000
but any of the pixel era games that were on Saturn were absolutely amazing,

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:18.000
because it was built to do 2D better than anything else at the time.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:19.000
True.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:24.000
Great answers from around the room and from around the internet over on Facebook and Google.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Let's get back into some news.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:26.000
Loki?

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
All right.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:36.000
So there was a little bit of funny business going on with Greenlight, and I guess I kind of understand why,

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:44.000
but they've basically, Valve has put a stop to people using incentives like giving out free keys

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:48.000
if you back them on Steam Greenlight to get their game pushed through.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:53.000
So a lot of the times it was, oh, hey, if you back our game and our game gets pushed through,

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
we'll go ahead and give you a free key for it.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Well, they didn't like that sort of manipulation, so they're going to be not allowing that anymore.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:10.000
Yeah, I don't even understand, like, where's the money to be made then if you keep giving away the game for free?

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Well, the money to be made is that you can't sell it on Steam until it passes Greenlight,

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:18.000
so if you get enough people to back you, then you're going to be able to do that.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
But then you gave it to all those people for free.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
It doesn't matter, though.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:25.000
So you gave it to a few people for free, gets the word out about your game.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Yeah, so it's the inertia.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Yeah, well, you can't sell it on Steam until you're on Steam.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:39.000
Basically, they were saying, when you gave away copies in exchange for votes, you put us in a really uncomfortable position.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:43.000
We do not think these votes accurately reflect the customer's interest,

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:48.000
and it makes our job harder in deciding which games customers would actually buy on Steam.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Additionally, when you give away copies of your games for votes, then every other developer on Greenlight thinks that's the thing they need to do to get noticed.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:59:00.000
And we don't think that is healthy for our system, really what the consumer wants.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:05.000
So, I'm glad that they addressed that.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:11.000
Yeah, it definitely sounds like something that needed to get shut down, so I was surprised it took this long to happen,

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:14.000
but I guess probably finally just won too many of these campaigns.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:21.000
Well, yeah, it sucks, because they already have a quality control issue, I think, with some of the games on Steam anyways,

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:28.000
and it wouldn't help that this is what you're going to have to do to get your game through. I don't know.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Alright, well, I like these stories where we hear some good news, some feel-good news coming out of the gaming industry,

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:40.000
and I think this is really cool. Sony is launching what's called PlayStation Heroes.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:47.000
It's a PlayStation 4 app that encourages you to make charitable contributions to charities like Make-A-Wish,

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:51.000
the V Foundation for Cancer Research, USO.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:57.000
What you do, you're going to pay between $1, $15, and you get a dynamic game theme.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:00.000
Or you can pay $20 and you get a 4-theme bundle.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:09.000
And this money will actually go to these causes, and you get an entry, essentially, into this contest to play games with a celebrity.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:14.000
So you could actually play Shaun White, the snowboarder in Destiny.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:20.000
You could, this would be awesome, you could play Snoop Dogg in a game.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:25.000
That would be, oh my god, how high would he be doing that? That would be so much fun.

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
And one of the Dodgers.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Can you play Ice-T in Call of Duty? Because that would be pretty awesome.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:38.000
So, yeah, the app is not going live until February 24th, but you can pre-order the app now if you want.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:47.000
That's a really clever idea. You know, it's a neat little spin on when Blizzard for World of Warcraft would sell the pet in-game,

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
where all the money would go to charity.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:52.000
And I think a lot of people really liked participating in that.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:55.000
They tend to do those about once a year.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:03.000
So I think this is a neat little spin on that, and certainly justifies the, you know, $4 for a theme or what have you,

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:06.000
if you know the money is going to a good cause. I think that's really cool.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
DarkSakura.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Well, you know, we like to sort of poke a little bit at Zynga, because honestly, they deserve it.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:31.000
There is an analyst out there who is calling for Don Mattrick to resign, because it was actually done by BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield,

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:41.000
said that it's a good idea for him to resign, because their earnings have just been absolutely dreadful.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:45.000
He says, your strategy appears to be all over the place.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:49.000
Your core franchises have and continue to generate meaningful earnings,

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:57.000
yet that is not completely offset by your attempts to find the next hit games in categories where Zynga has no underlying expertise.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:07.000
Yeah, they've basically lost $45 million last fourth quarter, bringing their total year losses to $226 million.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:12.000
Yet, Mattrick says it's a year of progress. What is your definition of progress?

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:18.000
I think it's one of those companies where it just, it was too much, too fast, you know,

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:25.000
with FarmVille being really the first breakaway, OMG crazy Facebook game.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:30.000
But I think we're kind of learning that, you know, any company can kind of get that success.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Now what is everybody playing on Facebook? It's that fucking trivia crack, and even I'm sucked into that.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:40.000
It's on Android and iOS as well, and it ties into Facebook. Trivia crack, have you guys played that?

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:43.000
That's kind of like the new big thing right now.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:49.000
No, but it's funny though, when I first heard you talking about it, I thought you were just referring to it as trivia crack.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:53.000
No, it is actually called trivia crack, is the name of the game, which is hilarious,

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:58.000
because it's really just a straight up trivia game, it doesn't even make like drug jokes or whatever,

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:02.000
but all the questions are crowdsourced, which is part of what makes it very interesting.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:07.000
But anyhow, all that talk aside, you know, Zynga hasn't really had that, you know,

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:11.000
they're not coming up with these games, other people are doing it,

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:15.000
and I think that's part of why they're probably hurting a little bit.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:20.000
I still don't understand why Don Mattrick would have left Microsoft to do that,

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:25.000
although maybe, you know, things at Microsoft have kind of, I hate to say it,

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:28.000
but things at Microsoft have been looking up since he left,

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:31.000
and they've got a different guy in charge now who's got a very different approach,

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:37.000
and a lot of people seem to like it, so yeah, I don't know, I don't know what to say about that, it's tricky.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:43.000
So, looking at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster says,

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:47.000
King actually had a good quarter. Yeah, interesting call,

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:53.000
King, of course, the makers of Candy Crush Saga, which, you know, I'm not really a fan,

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:58.000
but that's still going, you know, they had the sequel come out,

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:03.000
and I saw the arcade machine, and I think I saw my brain from rolling my eyes so hard,

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:12.000
but I get the feeling Candy Crush is really big with, like, kids and teens right now in that audience,

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:15.000
so, you know, that might be part of what's contributing to that.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:19.000
Dungeon Buster in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com with a comment on Zynga,

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:24.000
saying, right now Zynga looks like a rudderless ship, they were trying to get into online gambling,

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
but that hasn't panned out for them.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:31.000
Alright, well, we'll see if he can turn it around in the next year, but I don't know.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Maybe we'll have a merge, and we'll have King Nami.

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:40.000
Bite your tongue. Loki, quick, change the topic.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:45.000
Alright, fortunately I'm not going to change it to a good topic, because that would just not be me,

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:51.000
but EA, they've had a few layoffs over at EA Montreal,

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:57.000
and basically saying that a small number of people have been laid off due to some staffing changes,

02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:02.000
basically to line with their current development and service plans,

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:06.000
and a small number of employees were impacted, and they are working closely with each of them

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:09.000
to ensure the best transition possible.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:15.000
And so the teams at EA Montreal, including BioWare, are working on exciting new projects, blah, blah, blah.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:21.000
So, it's unfortunate, but at least it wasn't a ton of people, apparently.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
But they didn't mention numbers, so.

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:26.000
But that happens from time to time, I don't know.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:31.000
Yeah, still never fun to report on layoffs, but hopefully the gaming industry will rally around these guys,

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:34.000
you know, as we've had other layoffs stories happen.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:39.000
I don't remember if it was this week or last week, but it's worth mentioning that, you know,

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:44.000
I think it was last week when Sony Online Entertainment is no longer Sony, right?

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
And they're now the Daybreak.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:49.000
And they were like, oh, nothing's going to change, it's business as usual.

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:52.000
Well then, huge layoffs happened there.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:57.000
And like, one of the big mouthpieces behind EverQuest was one of the people laid off.

02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:01.000
And so it's, you know, always kind of sad to see.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:04.000
But when those layoffs happened at least, Twitter was really like, you know,

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:10.000
even Blizzard was out there going, hey, if you were impacted, check out Blizzard Careers and get in touch, you know.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:14.000
So, hopefully these folks are able to find placement somewhere else real quick,

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:17.000
because it's always a bummer to hear about this stuff.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
Alright, moving on.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:22.000
So, what's old is new again.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:23.000
This is really cool.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Castlevania, you know, you brought up Symphony of the Night earlier in the show,

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:33.000
but without the original OG Castlevania game, not quite going back as far as Vampire Hunter,

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:38.000
but pretty much Castlevania, going all the way back to what started it all.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:41.000
Castlevania has been ported to the Spectrum.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:47.000
That's right, the ZX Spectrum now has a Castlevania port.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
That is so awesome.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:54.000
They actually, this guy actually ported, it kind of looks really rough around the edges,

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
especially the Simon Belmont sprite.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:59.000
But, you know, the Spectrum could only handle so much, right?

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:08.000
No release date here as of yet, but it will have Castlevania style music, some improved detailed graphics.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
They didn't really have the Spectrum over here anyway.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:14.000
Exactly, well, yeah, but there's still a lot of love for it online, you know, people developing for it.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:20.000
And it's going to be fully English translated and so forth, so that's really cool.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
That's neat.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:26.000
So that's something that's going to be coming out on the internet, and you can check that out.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:30.000
More details at worldofspectrum.org.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
So, cool.

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:37.000
It sounds like they kind of have some different stuff than what you might remember from Castlevania on the NES.

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:41.000
Well, because it was Akuma Joel Dracula.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:42.000
Right.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:45.000
Alright, let's get into tonight's mailbag.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
Every week you guys send us emails.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:50.000
Participate at orangelaunchradio.com.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Or maybe you don't.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
Do we have any emails tonight at our soccer?

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Yeah, we do, because only one person emails us every week now.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
Only one person loves us?

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:58.000
There's only one.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
There can be only one, alright.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
Well, who is our biggest fan that sent us an email?

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:03.000
YYR.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
We love YYR, he's the best.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:06.000
Yes.

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:07.000
Hello, LR.

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:10.000
Was hoping to listen live tonight, but then stuff happened.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Well, fuck that stuff.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
What, the Saturday Night Live special?

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:15.000
Eh.

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
You know they're going to sell that on DVD and have it on Netflix.

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:18.000
Mmm.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
Judging all of you watching live.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
It's their 40th anniversary was tonight.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:23.000
But.

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:24.000
There is one thing though.

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
Do you think it's going to be funny again?

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:27.000
No, it'll be on Netflix.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
That I really wanted to know your collective thoughts on.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:34.000
Tonight I'm pretty sure you'll have covered Sega's recent financial woes and downsizing announcement.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
That is just sad to me.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:41.000
Having played the arcade exclusive Let's Go Island and the recent Project Diva titles,

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:44.000
I know that they're still capable of making fun games.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
Let's Go Island is actually really fun.

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:49.000
And I do just want to clarify, we did address this last week.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
It actually came up on last week's show, so.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:54.000
But obviously not everything they've released lately has been quality.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
Man, Let's Go Island though is super fun.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
It's a messed up game.

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
But then you have the new Sonic game which was.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:01.000
This week.

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:02.000
No.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:08.000
I came across an editorial on the internet this week, being redundant.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Sonic the Hedgehog needs to die.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:14.000
The piece argued that Sonic the Hedgehog isn't relevant anymore.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:17.000
That there haven't been any truly great Sonic games in many years.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:20.000
That Sega just plain lost their way with the series.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:24.000
And that it should either end here or go on extended hiatus.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:30.000
The writer notes of the fact that the new Mario games are still fun to play because Nintendo takes what works from previous games.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:34.000
And uses those elements again, rather than Sega reinventing the wheel each time.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:37.000
Ditching even the good things about previous games.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Hell, I never thought they would outsource their flagship character to an outside developer.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:45.000
This is a mess.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:50.000
As ridiculous as it sounds, I actually think there's some merit to this idea.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:54.000
The average gamer just doesn't seem to trust the brand to deliver a fun experience anymore.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:58.000
I recall the Sega of the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:02.000
The Sega that cranked out one fun game after another, both in arcades and at home.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:05.000
And wonder if we'll ever see anything like that ever again.

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:11.000
The closest thing I see to that now is the line of Sega 3D classics being released on 3DS.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:16.000
Fantasy Zone came out this week, and it is an absolutely great game. Of course it is because it's Fantasy Zone.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:17.000
I need to get that.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
It's a bit punishing at times.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:26.000
But I digress. What do you guys think of the idea of Sega putting their mascot in time out for a while, feeling a bit blue, Aaron Yyr?

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:30.000
I think that they, I don't know, they did the same thing with Tomb Raider.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:35.000
There was a lot of bad, well not bad, but not really good Tomb Raider games for a while.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:38.000
And they kept rebooting that series over and over and over again.

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:39.000
And finally they got it right.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:43.000
I just think the problem is they don't listen to their criticism.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:47.000
What they're trying to do is they're trying to make it accessible for a new audience.

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:52.000
That's why they're trying to do this beat-em-up type style gameplay.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:55.000
But no one fucking wants to play that.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:58.000
They want to play Sonic the Hedgehog because Sonic runs fast.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:03.000
They want to continue to play Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis basically.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:09.000
Even with Sonic Generations or whatever, I don't remember if that was the one with the stupid Werehog mode.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:12.000
But the 3D running scenes, good.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
The Werehog mode, crap.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
So what do they do for Sonic Boom?

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:19.000
Hey, let's bring back the Werehog mode because people fucking love that.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:23.000
And let's give Sonic some more friends and let's make him look all fucked up looking.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:27.000
It's like, who came up with these ideas? It's stupid.

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:31.000
And that's the problem, they don't understand why their game's failing.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
That's why your game's failing.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:36.000
You know how you're going to reach a new demographic?

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:40.000
It's by making the game good to where people are like, oh, you should totally play this.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
Kids are going to play a game if it's fun.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:45.000
They're not going to play a game because it's edgier.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:51.000
I don't know what you think makes a successful kids franchise. I don't know.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:56.000
Well, it's like if you take Sonic Generations when it came out, you know what the fun parts of that game were?

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
Playing old-school Sonic.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:01.000
The rest of it, you could give or take, it was more Sonic Colors.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:05.000
But now I'm worried that with these layoffs, what Sega is going to become,

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
and I think this is part of what we talked about last week,

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:12.000
is that it's just basically going to be old-school Genesis games on mobile phones.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
And like old-school, like, yay, people want to play.

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:17.000
But now it's all mobile and all this.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
It's okay, we don't need Sonic.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:23.000
Because there always is a chance to bring back Jazz the Jackrabbit.

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:27.000
We did have the toe-jamming Earl thing not that long ago. That's the thing.

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
You know what I think is honestly going to happen with YYR?

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:34.000
I think sometimes there's a phoenix that rises up from the ashes,

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
and we see this happen in gaming a lot,

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:39.000
and especially with the Kickstarter world that we live in now.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:43.000
And you've seen this happen with Mega Man, and now we're even seeing it.

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:46.000
Maybe this banjo-kazooie thing is going to go to Kickstarter. I don't know.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:55.000
But I would think that maybe some of these people with the layoffs might go forth and create something new.

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:58.000
You know, we were joking about Sanic the Hodgehog type of thing,

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:08.000
but I think there's going to be those developers that leave to make the game that they want to make.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
The Mighty No. 9 to the Mega Man.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Exactly. And I think that's what's ultimately probably going to happen in this.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Does Sega need to walk away from Sonic completely?

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Not necessarily. I think it's more they just need to...

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:23.000
How are they really using him is what it's about.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:28.000
Well, they're trying to spin off the brand into a TV show and stuff like that,

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
and maybe they'll get more people following it.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:31.000
Which is awful.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:36.000
But let's be honest, the quality of game that they're trying to tie in with these TV shows aren't exactly great.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:40.000
Skylanders is okay, I guess, but I don't see that as a...

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:43.000
I don't know. Personally, I don't see that as a big, strong brand.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:46.000
If it didn't have the collectible figure part of it...

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:47.000
Oh yeah, I was going to say.

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:51.000
No, if it didn't have the collectible figure part of it, I don't think anyone would give a shit about Skylanders.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Let's get to some comments from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Rama says, Sega is going to end up like Sunsoft, closing shop in the US and pushing out mobile titles.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:07.000
Tigerclaw says, I think the problem people have with Sonic is that they expect that sense of speed like in the original games.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:14.000
Sonic today is more platform-y, and they want the games to play like the originals.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Dungeonbuster points out, Sega's other devs are actually doing pretty good, though.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:23.000
Alien Isolation passed 1.7 million sold, if I recall correctly.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Seattle asks, what the fuck did they do to Knuckles?

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:35.000
S2 Hunter Matt says, I remember running out and getting Conker's bad fur day as a kid because it was edgy and raunchy.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:40.000
Ragenator says, for the record, I support Sega and have been buying their games.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Rama going on as a follow-up to Tigerclaw's comment saying,

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:49.000
The old schoolers need to understand that there is a change, and the old school gamers aren't the majority anymore.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:54.000
The games are going to get geared towards a newer, broader generation, even though it won't work all the time.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
Porque no los dos?

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:17.000
If that game was successful, and I just didn't like it, then that's fine.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Then everything has changed.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:23.000
There's a lot of successful games I don't like, a lot of sports games.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:27.000
If it was successful and I just didn't like it, then that's fine, then whatever.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:33.000
But it just didn't sell well either, so it's not that everything's changed,

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:38.000
it's just that they decided, I don't know, that they wanted to go this direction with it.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:42.000
It's just not working for them, and they've tried it several times and it just hasn't worked for them.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:47.000
So maybe you should go back and look at what made your game good in the first place, and stick there.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:52.000
And how about, here's my free advice to you, stop giving him more fucking friends!

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:55.000
Nobody likes Sonic's goddamn friends.

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:58.000
They came for Sonic the Hedgehog, not friends with Sonic the Hedgehog.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:01.000
No, no, no, they need to do the Amy Rose spin-off.

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:05.000
Amy goes around beating shit up with her hammer.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:10.000
If Amy is going to murder all the other Sonic friends, then I'm fine with that.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:15.000
We need to get fucking George R.R. Martin in on this shit to fucking get it.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:20.000
Just dial down to pure Sonic the Hedgehog, and I think we've got something there.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:23.000
You know what, I have to say, I love Knuckles.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:25.000
I love Knuckles.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Yeah, but not new Knuckles.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:31.000
Not that over-roided shit thing.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:35.000
Sorry, the George R.R. Martin comment has me just cracking the hell up, that's great.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Alright, so I guess that's the answer to Y.Y.R.'s question.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
We need George R.R. Martin to fix it.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:46.000
You know, in about 50 years, whenever he actually writes a book.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
Oh god, alright.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
There it is, that's our mailbag tonight.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:57.000
Every week we like to give our little rants on our show.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:00.000
Why? Because tradition.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:03.000
We get upset sometimes, and have to vent a few things.

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:09.000
Oh, this is bad.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
Here is justice.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
Here is punishment.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
Here.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:17.000
This is fucked up.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:26.000
Um, FU to the little bit of a headache I have right now, and FU to my hip.

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:29.000
Um, I'm too young for this shit.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:33.000
But if you get a cane, look on the bright side.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:36.000
Look on the bright side. We can go to Disneyland and cut all the lines.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:41.000
I'm gonna shake it at people, tell us because you get the fuck off my lawn, and yell at clouds.

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:46.000
Well, we're all hoping it's nothing too serious.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
That if you do have a cane, it's temporary.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Wouldn't it be awesome if I have to come in like in a half body cast or something?

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:54.000
No.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:59.000
If I have to have surgery, and then I can just say, I'll be sitting here with a tub of pinkberry, and my cane.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:00.000
No.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:06.000
Then you'll be the one Skyping into the show for six months like he had to do last year, so.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:12.000
To go ahead and let people know, I was in a car accident, two car accidents a few years ago.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:19.000
And screwed up my hip, and I just, I made the stupid mistake of not really getting it taken care of properly.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:24.000
And my doctors were just like, oh, it'll be fine. Do this physical therapy.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:30.000
So I do put part of the responsibility on them, although I should have been more proactive, I think.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:36.000
And I've been going to a chiropractor regularly, but my hip has actually been getting progressively worse.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:42.000
And now it's pretty much where it hurts all the time in a wealth of lengths, so, yeah.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:48.000
Well, we have a mutual friend who's also, you know, not an old man by any means, who had to have like a similar surgery.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:53.000
And he was out for a little while, but he's pretty much out and about now, like nothing else, so.

02:18:53.000 --> 02:19:00.000
So, um, they said low-end it could be bursitis, high-end it could be surgery, but whatever happens, I'll just deal with it.

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
Uh, Loki.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:05.000
I'm just gonna mention it, just because I'm disappointed.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:14.000
I was a pretty big fan of the show, and I just, I can't understand what it is with, you know, not even necessarily Law & Order,

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:17.000
because a lot of these cop drama shows just do it.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:23.000
And I'm not even talking necessarily about the gaming things, why is it that fucking TV shows can't do technology correctly?

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:28.000
And I understand that, yes, your audience might not be in tune with like lingo and stuff like that,

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:31.000
but it was so fucking retarded that it was insulting.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:34.000
Like, just to anybody that has any intellect at all.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:38.000
I just don't understand how this is a thing.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
So, that's it.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:45.000
And to end to this stupid cop that won't fucking go away, it's been like four weeks now, and I need this fucking cop to go away.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.000
It's like, annoying.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:50.000
Uh, my F.U. of the week goes to my voice.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:55.000
Even though I don't regret my short-lived retirement, and I'm sure I'm going to be the butt of the joke of all my friends,

02:19:55.000 --> 02:20:01.000
that I couldn't stop doing it, even though I retired, I don't regret that at all,

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:04.000
but I do regret maybe that I had to yell a little bit too much.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:12.000
And F.U. to the computer that plays the movie for freezing up, and it had to be rebooted, like as the movie was about to start,

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:15.000
so I had to go on stage and basically fill time for ten minutes.

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:21.000
So, I want to say thank you to these podcasts where I've been basically, with all due respect,

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:25.000
BSing for three hours a night here, and an hour on Hoard House, and whatever side projects I do.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:28.000
You know, that has given me the skill to improv a little bit,

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:34.000
because last night, I had to fill like ten, fifteen minutes of time in an audience of five hundred people.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:40.000
And here, I don't have to look at you, but there, they were looking right at me, and you got hecklers and everything,

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:46.000
but thank God for this podcast. So, F.U. to that computer for freezing up and putting me on the spot last night.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:51.000
But I had a lot of fun, and I wouldn't, I don't get to do that type of stuff enough.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:56.000
It's a real bummer, I like never get to do that stuff in the gaming world and so forth,

02:20:56.000 --> 02:21:00.000
but I really love doing it over in Colt Cinema, doing the hosting and all that stuff.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:07.000
So, yeah, but F.U. to my voice for maybe pushing it a little too much last night, having fun.

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then we're going to get to our phone calls.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:16.000
1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Loki.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:22.000
Yes, so, this is kind of cool. Even though you may not necessarily own a Vita or PlayStation TV,

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:31.000
or even certain types of Xperia mobile phones from Sony, you will still be able to do remote plays if you have an Android device.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:38.000
And this is because they have taken the Android app that runs on these Xperia phones

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:43.000
and have hacked it in a way to allow it to run on several Android devices.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:48.000
So now you can play PlayStation 4 games and remote play them on there.

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:51.000
You can actually sync it up with there.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:56.000
They also have, I guess, different ways you can do this.

02:21:56.000 --> 02:22:02.000
I guess you can connect a DualShock 3 or DualShock 4 to the phones as well, which you're going to need an app for that.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:06.000
And, of course, you're going to need to root your phone to allow that to work.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:10.000
But the thing that's pretty sweet that they're going to have you do that,

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:15.000
and that combined with just the stuff that they announced for Windows 10 and things,

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:19.000
I'm looking forward to be able to play more stuff remotely.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:24.000
Although, I don't think my phone's going to run this because my phone has enough trouble just loading a picture,

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:29.000
let alone running my PlayStation 4 streaming over Wi-Fi.

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:32.000
I just don't think that's going to be a thing.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:37.000
But hopefully, even though this is kind of a hack right now,

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:44.000
hopefully they do have some sort of wide support for it coming soon, maybe officially.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:48.000
Although, I guess they want to sell some Vita's.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:54.000
Yeah, if you take away one of the biggest reasons why people are buying Vita's, then, you know, for this remote play.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:58.000
I don't know. It's pretty cool, though. I'd be curious to see how well it works.

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
Yeah. Dark Soccer, you have something?

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:04.000
Well, yeah. This is actually a little something I might have mentioned earlier.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:08.000
But there is going to be a Final Fantasy VII symphony concert in Tokyo this summer.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:09.000
Oh, cool.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:14.000
It's going to be on June 21st. It will be the first of Game Symphony Japan concert series.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:20.000
And it will be the one to feature music by Uematsu.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:25.000
And it's going to be all Final Fantasy VII, including one winged angel.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:28.000
With a full choir and everything? I mean, that's the way to do it, right?

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:38.000
Yeah. And looking at where this is going to be held, it looks like it's going to be at the Suntory Hall in Akaska.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:43.000
So, go. I want people to be there and cover it for us.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:48.000
All right. Well, let's go to one more story tonight.

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:53.000
And this is about Nintendo and mobile phones. That's right.

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:56.000
That day might have finally come here.

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:59.000
Okay, no, no. We're not jumping to conclusions that big.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:02.000
But there is some very interesting movement happening here.

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:10.000
And that is some comments from Satoru Iwata this week talking about Miis on mobile devices.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:16.000
Quote, it would be fun for players to use their Mii characters as icons on social media.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:20.000
We are currently developing an application that will allow users to do that.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:34.000
So it sounds like, potentially, maybe Nintendo is working on something that would just allow you to import your Mii onto your mobile phone so you could save a picture and use it as your Facebook picture, your Twitter picture.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:41.000
Funny enough, I actually use mine on Twitch. If you go to my Twitch channel, and I swear this isn't just a cheap plug,

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:49.000
but if you go to my Twitch channel at twitch.tv slash robroberts, I actually use my Mii as my little profile picture because I thought, boom, it's appropriate.

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:56.000
How? No, it's not impossible. You don't need a mobile phone because Miiverse is on the internet.

02:24:56.000 --> 02:25:01.000
So I went to one of my Miiverse posts and what does it have? It has your little Mii face next to it.

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:05.000
So I basically jacked the picture from Miiverse and used that as my profile picture.

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:12.000
Did they ever release Miiverse as an app? I didn't think they did.

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:16.000
I know it's like a mobile-friendly website.

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:19.000
And they're making an app, so that's what the app will do.

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:22.000
The tech saying, go to Miiverse and download it.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:52.000
Loki, you might be having mic problems over there. I don't think they all heard the call.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
Sorry, the switch keeps sliding.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
Oh, is that mic breaking? Do we need to get you to do it?

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:57.000
No, it's fine.

02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.000
Alright. Stop fucking with it and it won't break.

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:00.000
Sorry, I...

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:01.000
I know habit.

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
I'd rather not cough into the mic.

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:04.000
Oh, fair enough.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:08.000
Alright. Live radio, guys. Sorry, we are...

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:13.000
And I don't always see the audio live because I'm always looking at chat or I'm looking at the story I'm trying to read,

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:16.000
so my eyes are not always on the audio, so sometimes I miss it.

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:21.000
Anyhow, that was it for Stories, though. That Mi Mobile app was the last thing I had.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:25.000
So we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line over at 1877-GAME-OLR.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:30.000
Our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio, if you want to give us a call.

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:35.000
I will mention this for Last Minute Stories tonight. Tigerclaw sent me this link here.

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:36.000
I do want to mention this.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:39.000
And this is something I remember reading about earlier in this week, too,

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:45.000
but that the TV service on the Wii U is going to be going away in Europe.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:48.000
TV is not going to be happening in Europe anymore.

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:51.000
It sounds like it was just too hard.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:58.000
It's a little more complicated in Europe when you have all these countries and programming schedules and so forth.

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:02.000
It just wasn't really worth it to try and put that all together.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:08.000
So TV in Europe going away, but probably hardly anyone was using it anyway. I don't know.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
But anyway, the phones are lighting up, so let's get to it.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:14.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:17.000
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio, and your mic might be muted. Who's this?

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
Yeah, my mic was muted. Hey, what's up? This guy's Judo.

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
It's like me. I'm calling in.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:24.000
See, it's not just you, Loki. All right. What's up, Kaijuto?

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:31.000
Not much. I wanted to address what you were talking about earlier with the people being into their retro games

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:34.000
and wanting to be retro and missing the old Sega.

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:39.000
I think I have an answer for that. I've actually been analyzing that and just trying to figure out,

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:42.000
what is it about people that love these retro games?

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:46.000
Because me, I'm more into innovation. I want the games to move forward.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:51.000
I like when they do new things, so I'm not really in that category, but I wonder about people that are.

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:58.000
I kind of compare it to, have you ever heard of people who say that they've gone through drug addiction?

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:05.000
The key thing that they say about drug addiction is that the reason why they continue to take drugs

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:11.000
is because they're chasing that first high. That first high that they got from that drug is what they've been after.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:15.000
Every other high that they got doesn't compare to that first one.

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:18.000
The whole entire life of their addiction, they're chasing that one high.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:22.000
I think that's what's going on with a lot of gamers who love retro stuff.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:26.000
They got such a kick out of that game when they were a kid, or whatever the experience was,

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:32.000
that they're just continuing to chase that same experience over and over again and not trying to find something new to experience.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:39.000
That is a very, with all due respect, a very strange comparison, but it kind of works.

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:45.000
I don't know how that makes me feel that your comparison kind of works.

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:48.000
Games are an addiction. I think some people do actually get addicted to games.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
Oh, I think a lot of people actually.

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:51.000
It can be considered a drug.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:56.000
I think a lot of people get addicted to games, especially in the MMO world where things are very social that we live in.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:57.000
But anyway, that's a little-

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
No, I don't even think, I wouldn't even go that far.

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
That's a little different than what you're talking about.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:06.000
I think the category that I'm talking about, those are the people that actually don't want to socialize in a game.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:13.000
They're the ones who want their single player, they want to watch Sonic run through a loop multiple times over and over again.

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:22.000
I don't see them as actually being social. I think the MMO crowd is a little different than your average single player gamer.

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:27.000
Obviously your comments are getting a lot of lively responses in chat.

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:34.000
Fifth Dream says, nah, I just have fun playing them. I'm not into trying to feel a thing.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:38.000
Dungeon Buster says, fun games are fun games regardless of their time frame.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:43.000
That might actually have been to another comment that they're talking about, some game playthroughs.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:49.000
But anyway, what I wanted to say with that is that we're not saying that if you enjoy retro video games you're a drug addict.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
That's not what Kaiju was trying to say.

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:58.000
But I definitely see that angle of, and you see this a lot.

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:05.000
Ever since emulators broke on the scene, this is a big thing, where you will download a ROM.

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:10.000
Remember, and the reason why I say it this way is because emulators were before Virtual Console.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:15.000
I realize some of you might be frowning. I'm talking about a very gray area of legal things.

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:18.000
But I just think this is something a lot of people have done.

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:24.000
Where you are downloading NES ROM to play on this NES emulator you get on your PC.

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:27.000
And you play it for literally 45 seconds.

02:30:27.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Where you're like, oh yeah, I remember this. Wow, it's not really what I remember.

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:40.000
Alright, next game. It's like how things in our memory are so much different than maybe what they are now.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:45.000
In our interview earlier tonight, I think Don made this point when he was talking about games that he was playing when he was 9.

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:48.000
And he wanted to make the game that he thought he was remembering.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Right, yeah. I remember going to Pirate Day and finding a whole bunch of, I think they had almost every Super Nintendo game ever made.

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:05.000
And I was like, alright, I gotta download this. I wanna be playing all these games. These are the games I always wanted as a kid.

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:10.000
I haven't even gotten through 10% of those games yet.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Just sit on my computer, you know. It's just that whole feeling that you get from me.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:20.000
I don't care who was it, Rageinator, who was it, Trip Dream, whoever.

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:25.000
It is a feeling. That feeling, that fun that you call it, that's a feeling.

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:28.000
You know, you're chasing that feeling. You want that feeling again.

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:37.000
SSJ100Matt puts this in a really good way as saying, I can see people chasing nostalgia to try to rekindle those early moments from their first time.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:38.000
Right.

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:44.000
I think that's a really good way of putting it. Like, remember, and I don't know how old you are, Kaijutor, or what your frame of reference would be.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:50.000
But I know for me, when I was like, I think I was 9 years old when Super Mario Bros. 3 first came out on the NES.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:59.000
And I remember that feeling the first time you go to World 4, specifically World 4. Anybody remember what World 4 in Super Mario Bros. 3 is?

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:00.000
I don't remember.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:01.000
It is?

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:02.000
Boot.

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:03.000
Nope. Close.

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:04.000
Giant.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:05.000
Giant. It's the giant level. It's the world of giants.

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:06.000
Oh, yeah, yeah. That was great.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:10.000
And it's like the first time you see the giant goobas, the giant turtle.

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:15.000
And I remember, like, 9 years old, like, oh my god.

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:16.000
Yeah, that was great.

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
This is so cool.

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:21.000
Except, like, their dead animation was still the regular size.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:30.000
You're right. But now you go, yeah, you go back and you look at it now and you're like, this was actually kind of, like, the way they did it, they really cut a lot of corners how they did this.

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:36.000
You know? But it's just funny, like, you know, what memory kind of does to things like that.

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:49.000
Yeah, I remember playing that game with my friend, Super Mario Bros. 3. And for, like, a good, I would say 20 minutes, I just kept making Mario run back and forth because I couldn't believe that you can run back to where you started.

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:57.000
Because, you know, remembering the other Mario games and just a bunch of platformers, it's like, once you move past that edge, you can never go back, you know?

02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:07.000
And that's one of the main reasons why I really got into sandbox games later on. Like, you know, 3D sandboxing was just for the simple fact that I can go wherever I want in a game.

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:13.000
Like, one of the things that always bugged me as a kid playing a lot of platformers and games like that was you couldn't go back.

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:24.000
You know, you couldn't explore that place over the mountain that you're running by. You know, like, that type of stuff is what led me to want to get more into innovative gaming and not so much being trapped in the whole retro thing.

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:27.000
You know, just, you know, being stuck in that one spot.

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:36.000
Sure, and that's a selling point for a lot of games now. Like, I remember when Oblivion, Elder Scrolls of Oblivion was first, they were talking about, you see that mountain in the distance, you can go climb it.

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:42.000
You know, that was a huge part of that game. Dungeonbuster in our chat, one more comment here and then I'll wrap up.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:48.000
Dungeonbuster saying, Space Invaders, Pac-Man, Super Pac-Man, still great regardless of having come out decades ago.

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:56.000
You can't really fault players for looking to games today, modern or retro, that try to capture the essence of being as fun in their own way.

02:33:56.000 --> 02:34:02.000
Well, I'm going to disagree with that. I'm just going to end out by just saying that same thing with developers.

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:11.000
Like, they're still chasing that retro format and because of that, they start to fail because obviously it's not going to be, you're not going to get that same feeling again.

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:19.000
You can't step in the water, the same water twice. So, it's like when they try to do, you know, HD remakes and, you know, we're going to add more friends with Sonic.

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:27.000
When they try to do that type of stuff, they're killing the nostalgia. So, they've already screwed themselves over. The only thing they can possibly do is make it new, make it fresh.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:36.000
And not so much, you know, try to recapture that because it's locked away in the old game, the way the old game worked. You know, bugs and everything.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:45.000
It's tricky. I kind of think sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Like, you know, the Sonic, the Hedgehog Part 4 or whatever, you know, I mean, that was a pretty retro inspired thing.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:50.000
But it wasn't, it wasn't really, it was just, it wasn't that great. Like, it was just kind of missing something.

02:34:50.000 --> 02:35:01.000
Missing the soul. That, you know, that feeling that you got when you were a kid or however you were when you first played it. Not even a kid. I mean, I'm pretty sure there could be a 60-year-old who's playing Mario right now for the first time and getting his kicks out of it.

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:06.000
So, but there's not so much an age thing. It's just that first initial experience that you had with the game.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:14.000
But then you look at something like, you look at something like New Super Mario Brothers on Wii U, and it's like, that's basically Mario Brothers 3 in today's.

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:26.000
I mean, it's basically what it is, but it's, and it's awesome. So, I think, you know, again, Nintendo has a very strange way of being able to succeed here where a lot of other companies don't succeed.

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:30.000
Anyway, Kaijuto, we could probably do a whole show on this. I appreciate your call. Good thinking.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:31.000
No problem. Have a good night.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Take care, buddy. Bye.

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:01.000
What's up?

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:40.000
Yeah, that was so many years ago. Oh my God. So anyway, but yeah, I had a good time there, but thank God it wasn't Snowmageddon the year I went, because I wouldn't know what the hell to do.

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:48.000
Listen, I'm just laughing at people who are trying to beat the snow, and I'm guilty of it doing it this year.

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:55.000
My thing is, yes, you could beat the snow getting down there, but what are you going to do when the snow traps you?

02:36:55.000 --> 02:37:02.000
Catsnokon9 at Catsnokon2003. A bunch of us were stuck in the hotel in Crystal City until Tuesday.

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:07.000
Big snow, big snow. What you gonna do? What you gonna do when it snows in you?

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:16.000
Anyway, I just hope that doesn't happen to me at PAX East. Alright, well, what's on your mind tonight? I don't know if you're calling to talk about the con or something else or what.

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:27.000
Oh, no, no, no, no. I'd go talk about the whole old-school retro thing, the whole issue with Sonic, and I see this in the gaming community, and I'm starting to see it in the anime community as well.

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:37.000
I mean, not even that, I'm just seeing it in various communities and genres. It's like, I love my old-school gaming, and I do. Don't get me wrong.

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:48.000
I don't mind playing an updated version or something new, and that always works out for me. I've fallen in the minority of people who hated Super Mario 64.

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:54.000
You mean to tell me I gotta go back to the level seven times to complete this? No, I'm not doing it anymore.

02:37:54.000 --> 02:38:02.000
Hate is a strong word, Rama, but I'm with you to a point. I kind of think we look back on that game way too fondly.

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:11.000
That's my personal opinion, though, and I think a lot of the 2D versus 3D mindset comes into play. I don't want to start a whole debate, but I don't think you're as alone as you think you are, Rama.

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:18.000
Yeah, but you know, with the other 3D games, like the Mario 3D games, I like those. Those were fun, because it kept going.

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:28.000
Now, I understand, you know, the whole thing with Sonic Boom, and I have a lot of friends in the Sonic community that were losing their shit over it because it was so different.

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:38.000
And all I said was, you do realize, us old school gamers now, we're the minority. They're not listening to us.

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:53.000
They're going to make the games, design it for the newer generation coming in. So, if we see Sonic Boom and we don't like it, maybe your nephew or niece is going to see it, is going to want it, and play it.

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:56.000
Granted, the sales of Sonic Boom wasn't as good.

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
Yeah, I was going to say that didn't happen, though.

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:10.000
True, but there are other, I would say, as you look at Nintendo, they did something different. The latest Mario games aren't really old school. They just spin on it, and it works.

02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:20.000
Pretty much whether it's a success or failure, these businesses are going to go after the newer generation because there's more of them than there is of us.

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:30.000
Well, like I said in response to that, though, earlier when it had come up in chat, I was kind of like, well, why can't we have both? Because I think there's still certainly a big gaming audience.

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:38.000
I mean, many, many years ago when gaming was first born, you probably didn't have a lot of 30 and 40-year-old gamers. You certainly had some.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:52.000
I mean, a lot of that age group was making the games at the time, but it wasn't as mainstream for that age group. But anybody our age, Ranma, anybody our age knows who Mario and Link and Sonic are.

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:58.000
Anybody our age, seriously, unless they're Amish or something, knows these characters. They're part of our culture now.

02:39:58.000 --> 02:40:08.000
I know, and that's why, you know, that's how I look at how Nintendo rehashes the old games, brings back an HD, and I know we're all like, Nintendo, stop with the HD remixes.

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:16.000
But meanwhile, they put them out, and they sell like candy, and it's gold, because some of these are great titles, and I understand that.

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:24.000
Okay, young'uns, come here, check out one of these classic games done up for your new console. Play it and enjoy it, you know?

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:36.000
And I get with that, which is why I would love to see, for the 3DS, maybe Sega redoing the Sonic titles with the 3D effects of the background. That would be fun.

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:44.000
Maybe Nintendo will get all the Mario titles together, 3D fire up the backgrounds and play it for fun. That would be cool. I would love that, but...

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:54.000
I want to say, and I could be wrong, but I feel like this is something that happened, and maybe Bobby or somebody that was at that same E3 would remember this.

02:40:54.000 --> 02:41:06.000
But I want to say, when they first showed the 3DS, you had to wait in that big line and go see the 3DS for the very first time, they were showing old school NES titles, redone in 3D.

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:18.000
And there were things like Xevious and some titles that never got that 3D treatment, just like we never did get the 3D movies. And I think Sonic was one of those games they showed.

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:28.000
Wait, I can tell you this now, because I went on to the Nintendo club rewards, they have Xevious and Twinbee, urban champion, they've 3D-fied those, and you can get them.

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:39.000
Alright, sorry, I named a game that they did do, but I know there were games we saw on the show floor, retro games with the 3D spin that they never put out for public consumption for whatever reason.

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:46.000
Maybe somebody at that E3 can remember, but I thought Sonic was one of them. I thought Sonic was one of them.

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:51.000
Probably, but that would be pretty cool.

02:41:52.000 --> 02:42:07.000
All it was really, I mean, it's not as fancy as you would think, all it was was that they could put one sprite layer on this 3D layer, and they could put another sprite layer on this 3D layer.

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:12.000
So it was kind of what you say, the background was in the background, the foreground was in the foreground, and that was the 3D.

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:19.000
Anyway, just throwing it out there, for whatever reason, I don't think it ever came out.

02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:31.000
Yeah, but neither did, we also got to see Tangled, like the trailer was playing on a 3DS, and we never, I mean, short of Dinosaur Office, we never saw 3D movies.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
So they never did the Sonic one?

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:34.000
I don't think so.

02:42:34.000 --> 02:42:36.000
Because I'm looking at a review for it.

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:39.000
Unless it's part of that Sega Classics thing.

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
It may have been the Sega Classics thing.

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
Aha! So maybe it does exist.

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:46.000
And I'm sure there's somebody who might have downloaded it.

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:52.000
Keep in mind, I don't have the entire contents of the 3DS store memorized in any game I buy, I pretty much buy all my own money.

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
Yeah, because I guess they said the M2 did that.

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
So okay, so maybe they do have one, there it is.

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:58.000
Well there you go!

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:02.000
Rama, you need to open up your 3DS and go on the shop, and so do I.

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:06.000
Yeah, some people in chat are saying, Orange Wright says 3D Sonic happened.

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:11.000
Alright, I'm gonna have to check it out, because if it's really 3D, I may just have to pick it up, because I think that would be pretty fun.

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:14.000
I think something like that would kind of bridge the gap between the old school and the new school.

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
It's just that twist that would work so well.

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:19.000
How hard would it be though for them to just configure the old games?

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:24.000
Like here's each sprite layer is on a different, you know, each layer of sprites is on a different level or something.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:31.000
And you may have to tweak that per game, but I wouldn't see it be that hard to port that stuff over if they have an emulator for that.

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:40.000
I don't know, because I don't program games, but I can't imagine it's insanely difficult, but maybe you run into other weird issues with the new display and things like that.

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
Maybe that's where things get tricky, I don't know.

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:43.000
I don't know.

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:47.000
Alright, anyway Rama, I'm gonna let you go to try to squeeze in one more call, but thanks so much.

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:48.000
Hope you had fun at the con.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:57.000
We will, and we'll be doing a full review with me, Ari, Mako-chan, and Ablon Cosplay, so get your booze ready, get the drinks ready, we're gonna do it up.

02:43:57.000 --> 02:44:01.000
Alright, it's going down Tuesday here live at VOG Network on Anime Jam Session.

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
And before I get it, here's my last thing.

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
Ookchan, I got something to show you, look at the webcam.

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:11.000
It's a copy of Rama on...

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:12.000
I have that game.

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
That looks like a Super Famicom cart, not a...

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:15.000
It is.

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:20.000
This one is Rama 1 half the first fighting game that came over as Street Combat.

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:25.000
I rented that game once, Rama, with the frickin' converter.

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:31.000
Yeah, and this is the third fighting game, which was, they called Super Battle.

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:37.000
It was supposed to come over as Rama 1 half 2, anything goes martial arts, but due to poor sales, it never happened.

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:38.000
That one's the fun one.

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:42.000
The second one was the one we actually got over here as Rama 1 half Hard Battle.

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:43.000
Yep.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:49.000
And that was the one that had, uh, the gambling king had, uh, pantyhose in it.

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:53.000
Yeah, and if you beat the game with pantyhose, the game would glitch.

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:54.000
Yep.

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:55.000
It would glitch.

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:56.000
Alright.

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:57.000
Well, Rama, thanks for the call.

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:58.000
No problem.

02:44:58.000 --> 02:44:59.000
Alright, take care, buddy.

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:00.000
You too.

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:01.000
Alright.

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:05.000
1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:08.000
Loki, that story you were gonna read that I cut you off on.

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:15.000
Sorry, I was gonna mention that apparently with a recent interview with, um, Giorgio, um, Mordor,

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:23.000
um, apparently he's working on a new video game soundtrack for a new Tron game, and he's also working with Skrillex on that.

02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:27.000
So there's a new Tron game in the works.

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:30.000
He says, uh, you know, according with, uh, Clashmusic.com,

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:32.000
I'm gonna meet with Skrillex next week.

02:45:32.000 --> 02:45:36.000
When I'm back, I'm doing music for a game for Disney's Tron.

02:45:36.000 --> 02:45:43.000
We have about five themes, electronic stuff, and let's see if he's interested in remixing or reworking one of the songs.

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:46.000
I have a lot of conflicting feels about this.

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
Um, on one hand, I'm like, yay, Tron.

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
On the other hand, hmm.

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:51.000
Alright, well, we'll see.

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:52.000
We'll see.

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:55.000
I'm just all about a new Tron game. Come on.

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:56.000
I guess. I guess.

02:45:56.000 --> 02:46:00.000
That's true, though. Tigerclaw and chat, Giorgio and Mordor is a legend.

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:01.000
That is, uh, is true.

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:05.000
So, we'll see. I gotta give it a shot, right? It's Tron.

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
Alright, let's see if we can get in one more call here.

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
Uh, hi, you're on Orange Land's Radio. Who's this?

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
Hi, yeah, this is Ragingator.

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:14.000
Hey, Ragingator. What's up, buddy?

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.000
Uh, not a whole lot.

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
Uh, just trying to stay warm.

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:19.000
Yeah, you look cold.

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
Hope everything's alright.

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:25.000
Oh, it's beyond cold. It has to warm up to be cold.

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:29.000
It's like, last time we talked, there was, like, negative something degrees Fahrenheit here.

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:30.000
Oh my god.

02:46:30.000 --> 02:46:34.000
It does not even take into consideration wind chill effects.

02:46:34.000 --> 02:46:38.000
You own Xbox 360s. If so, turn them on.

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:42.000
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:46:42.000 --> 02:47:00.000
Uh, well, since a lot of the talk on tonight's show has either been retro games and Sega and so on and so forth, I thought I'd carry on the trend and talk about Sega and their issues in the retro games.

02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:29.000
Uh, these, uh, I know I kind of touched on the subject, uh, a few times before on the show and maybe even Bobby, not Bobby's show, but, uh, so I know it's going to sound like a broken record, but do you think that, uh, you know, Sega could have their position, you know, their financial position if they re-release more of their retro games above and beyond what they already released?

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:51.000
I know that a few years ago they already re-released, uh, Sega, uh, Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection on 360, PS3, and then, of course, there's the stuff on, uh, on Steam, plus, uh, there's the Dreamcast Collection, and I think, you know, and plus, Res was re-released.

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:52.000
You know...

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:56.000
And then, I think, you know, Nicely Two Dreams was re-released.

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:57.000
That's a...

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:58.000
That's a good question.

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:24.000
Um, you know, a lot of, uh, these games kind of get re-released, and I remember that Sonic, uh, Ultimate Collection was a pretty damn good collection, and I think part of what makes these games worthy of your dollar is that, and this is, you know, if you think about it, I've been nagging on this with Virtual Console for a very long time, is that straight up ports of the game only go so far.

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:29.000
And I think, you know, that's cool if on the Wii you buy your straight up port of the game.

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:47.000
On the Wii U, asking you to do it again is, is, is a challenge, but, okay, it does look really good on the gamepad and so forth, and you do have the discount, so whatever, but, you know, my question is, when are things gonna really push forward, and when will we see, like, achievements, or some type of online component?

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:50.000
Or if you buy it on the Wii U, you have it on the 3DS, or something.

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
Yeah, or co-op, or something like that.

02:48:52.000 --> 02:49:02.000
And so I sort of say that's where game companies can kind of get away with putting out retro classics again is, what is that new thing?

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:11.000
How does this retro classic tie into the new thing in gaming right now, be it social integration, or, or whatever it is?

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:22.000
And I think if a game can do that, it tends to usually do a little better than, oh, here it is, just, just a straight up port of the game from a few years ago, again and again and again.

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:32.000
Especially when that goes over to mobile, it's like, because usually the controls don't translate as well, but that's, you know, again, a lot of that is opinion, but that's my opinion.

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:48.000
Yeah, one thing I was gonna mention is that there are certain games, like the ones I mentioned before, before you would buy, those have been released again and again and again, and that being said, people can easily get the hands on them, no problem.

02:49:48.000 --> 02:50:12.000
Whereas other games, you know, like the vast majority of the games for, let's say, Sega Saturn, be it, you know, Panzer Dragoon, or Mr. Bones, or any other game that you can possibly name, plus the vast majority of game cast games, you know, haven't been re-released, to the best of my knowledge.

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:29.000
And I'm one of the few people that really hasn't bought a whole lot of Sega systems, and in fact the only ones I ever bought were the Genesis, and I didn't even get that until 2002.

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:50.000
So, if I had the opportunity to buy, like, Panzer Dragoon, for example, you know, on Steam, if I had the opportunity right here, right now, I'd buy in a heartbeat. I can't speak for anyone else, you know, listening, or you guys, but...

02:50:50.000 --> 02:51:02.000
So, I think you're talking about why do these companies, like, kind of limit their offerings in a way. It's like, why not, if you, you know, get that one Genesis game emulated, get them all emulated, make some money.

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:17.000
I don't, you know, and again, because I don't program, and I don't budget or whatever, I just play, and have a big fat opinion, like a lot of us do, I don't know to what extent they have to go to to get a game emulated.

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:28.000
But maybe they have to say, like, are there a lot of people like Raginator out there that would buy Panzer Dragoon to make an emulation worth it, and sometimes they may think, you know what, the demand really isn't there.

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:45.000
But, that's where fans have to speak up, and your voices are heard on their forums, and, you know, professional emails to some of their channels and so forth, and Twitter and so forth, you can kind of be heard, and hopefully it doesn't fall on deaf ears.

02:51:45.000 --> 02:52:08.000
Yeah, one last note before I do let you go is, yes, I know, you know, there are, how should I say, less than legitimate ways of getting those games, and I know technically that's possible, but that is at best a gray area, and that's one route that I really don't want to go.

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:34.000
I would rather give, you know, Sega or Nintendo or whoever, you know, my money for a legitimate copy, that way I can support those companies, give them my funds, they would, you know, help out the next project, and there's no telling if the next project is going to be a good game or a bad game.

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:40.000
But, the point is, I want to support the developers and publishers.

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:50.000
And I think that's good, and I think that's what a lot of people need to remember, is that, you know, games aren't made for free, you wouldn't work for free, so, you know, why do we want our game devs to do that?

02:52:50.000 --> 02:53:00.000
So, you know, you have to think about that every time you might use shady methods to obtain a game. So, anyway, RageNator, appreciate the call, have a good one, stay warm.

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:02.000
I will do, take care.

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:14.000
Alright, buh-bye. Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight, I'm going to go ahead and close it up, because we're about to wrap up shop here at Studio OLR, but I do want to check in for any other last minute stories we might have.

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:19.000
I'm just a silly mob that they have for Doom, where you can do Instagram-style selfies.

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:22.000
Oh, lord. Selfies in Doom, though? Wait a minute.

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:23.000
Yeah, they have a selfie stick.

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:30.000
Oh my god. That is, that is actually the dumbest news I think I've ever heard on this show.

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:33.000
I don't think I can roll my eyes any harder without causing myself physical pain.

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:46.000
I did see this pretty cool Kickstarter that's also out there, if you look at it, it's called Strafe. It's a procedurally generated 1996-style FPS game that's extremely gory.

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:47.000
Oh, god.

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.000
Extremely gory as in, you know...

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:51.000
In 90s, like 96 pixel...

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:52.000
Pixel blood!

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:53.000
Pixel blood, yeah.

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:59.000
But it looks pretty funny, and the Kickstarter video that they have for it is just fucking hilarious.

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:00.000
Awesome.

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:06.000
And also extremely gory, but in like that kind of 90s-style commercial sense, but they take it way too far.

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:07.000
That's awesome.

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:08.000
Face melting.

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:10.000
That's awesome.

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:14.000
Alright, well that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:22.000
I'm about to go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night, but I do want to thank Don and Austin from the StarMazer team for joining us on the show tonight.

02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:27.000
Best of luck in that final push for those, excuse me, last few dollars you need to make the game happen.

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:28.000
Our fingers are crossed.

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:31.000
Hey, if nothing else, y'all, I want that soundtrack.

02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:37.000
I'm just saying, like, you know, I want that soundtrack, so let's cross our fingers and our toes for those guys.

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:38.000
I want to thank those guys for being on.

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:48.000
Thank you guys for being here and supporting Orange Lounge Radio, whether you were here live and chose to listen to us instead of the Saturday Night Live special, really appreciate that.

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:51.000
Hey, if you're listening on the podcast feed, we appreciate that too.

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000
Don't we have the Oscars we're going up against next week too?

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:58.000
Yeah, now the Oscars are next week. We lost our guests next week because of the Oscars. We're trying to reschedule them for a future date.

02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:01.000
Oh yeah, but we might have a replacement guest, which would be great, so that'd be great.

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:04.000
Well, I was totally disappointed that Neil Patrick Harris decided to bail on us.

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:15.000
So, I know Sunday night is when a lot of the big shit happens, so we really appreciate you guys that decide to be here live and participate with it.

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:20.000
We really, really appreciate you guys, but we also appreciate, we appreciate you podcast folks just as much.

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:22.000
Your support keeps this show going.

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:28.000
Just if you are listening, the live listeners, we see most of them in our chat room and we get to interact with them.

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:34.000
So, if you're listening on the podcast, please drop us a line, say hello, send an email, tweet at us, let us know you're out there.

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:36.000
We love hearing from people. Don't be shy.

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:41.000
We're really nice, unless you're mean to us, then we'll be mean, but we're really nice otherwise.

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:51.000
So, yeah, and we don't ask for your money or we don't have a big name website backing us up here at Orange Lawns Radio.

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:58.000
So, all we ask if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lawns Radio, please tell a friend or two or five about the show.

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:05.000
Help spread the word where every gamer has a voice because we don't know the voices are out there if we don't find them.

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:11.000
Like we had Austin tonight, big Bamani fan, didn't know he was out there until we finally got in touch.

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:18.000
So, now we know and hopefully there's plenty more people out there who just don't know of OLR yet who would fit in great here.

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:19.000
So, help us spread the word.

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:26.000
A nice five-star review on iTunes or Stitcher goes a long, long, long way and we appreciate those of you guys that take the time out to do things like that.

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:27.000
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:31.000
Alright, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought for the night so we can wrap it up here.

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:34.000
Dark Sakura, I see you packing a laptop away. We'll start with you.

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:37.000
I was in the middle of pulling my hair back so come to me later.

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:40.000
Alright, then Loki, what is your final thought for tonight?

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:43.000
I'm going to try to figure out what level two is going to be.

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:44.000
You can do it.

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:46.000
I have a ton of ideas. I have a list of ideas.

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:48.000
How many levels are you doing, out of curiosity?

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:49.000
69.

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:53.000
Here's the number of ideas I have right now is on one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:54.000
He's counting.

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:56.000
20. I have 20 so far.

02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:58.000
20 is a good number, maybe.

02:56:58.000 --> 02:56:59.000
So far.

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:03.000
Or maybe do like seven just to get your game out there and then...

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:11.000
I have to also look at and see which of these are actually doable because there's some ideas I'm like, well, I may not be able to do that, but we'll try.

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:20.000
Make it work. I really want to see the game, but of course I have to take my own advice because I want to get my vog jam done, belated as it is.

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:26.000
My final thought for the night is I would love to have my voice back tomorrow. That would be very lovely.

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:33.000
And, um, I just, I'm, I'm feeling very great and thankful for a lot of things.

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:40.000
Um, and thank you all who contribute to being here and supporting this show for contributing to my lovely mood this evening.

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:41.000
So, uh, I appreciate it.

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:45.000
Not every day is a lovely mood, but today I'm certainly feeling it. So thank you all.

02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:47.000
Uh, Darsakha, your final thought tonight?

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:51.000
Everyone pull out your iPhones right now and buy FLOM.

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:55.000
F L O M M. Do the thing. Do it for me.

02:57:55.000 --> 02:57:56.000
Do you get some FLON? Okay.

02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:59.000
FLON, I let it on. Do you get kickback?

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:05.000
No, I don't, but it's fun. And I honestly, we need to support more people.

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:09.000
This is, this would really mean a lot to me. It would mean a lot to Steve.

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:13.000
You've talked fondly of him for a while now, so I know you really want to see him succeed.

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:18.000
I do. So do it for me. It's, it's $3. I will lend you $3.

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:20.000
That's a lot of people to lend $3 to.

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:21.000
I was talking to you, Rob.

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:27.000
Oh, me? Okay. No, I actually, thankful, uh, some friends gave me an iTunes gift card for the holidays.

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:28.000
So I have, I have my radio.

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:29.000
Spend it on FLOM.

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:31.000
All right. Should I spend it on FLOM 10 times?

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:34.000
Well, you just do it once.

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:35.000
All right.

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:36.000
Cheese, Rob.

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:39.000
All right. That's going to do it, uh, here at Orange Lounge Radio for another week.

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000
We'll be back in seven days to do it all again.

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:44.000
Thanks so much for listening. Have a wonderful week, everybody. Good night.
