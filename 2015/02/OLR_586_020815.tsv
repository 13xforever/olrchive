0	17240	This week, after AOL's closure of various blogs, some have turned to crowdfunding in
17240	20820	order to continue the coverage their readers enjoyed and found success in doing so.
20820	23680	The resurgence of fan favorites occurs big and small in this week's news, and we'll
23680	30680	tell you all about it right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
30680	34880	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
34880	42240	where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this February 8, 2015
42240	48560	with the 586th episode of our show. Here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and
48560	53360	the gamer lifestyle are myself, Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Skie on Twitter and
53360	58440	in the intro there, and joining me on this 3 hour tour are my lovely co-hosts, say hello
58440	65240	to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers. Hi. Hi, how are you, Ms. Jamie Summers? Meat. Meat. Are
65240	70760	you going to give me one word answers all night long? Maybe. What kind of meat are we
70760	75460	talking about? We're talking about like meat on a pizza, meat in a salad, meat... I had
75460	82720	chopped up hamburger, and then a bratwurst, half a bratwurst, all covered in cheese, and
82760	88400	it was gloriously greasy, and delicious. That sounds like an epic fart waiting to happen.
88400	99400	I'm a lady. I just belch. Also, yeah. Alright, also joining us, say yeah to Techmaster Loki.
99400	105280	Yeah. Yeah. How are you doing, Loki? I'm doing fine. Yeah, you seem very chipper. It's because
105280	108960	of that sandwich you ate. You went to your favorite sandwich shop again. Yes. You're
109000	113360	doing that thing I talked about last week where you find that new food you love. Really,
113360	120400	I just wanted to try the meatball sub, and it was so worth it. But yes. Yes. But mainly,
120400	125880	I was just excited because, and I'll get into this later when I get into my game week, because
125880	133160	I have rank bacon. That's right, rank bacon. Oh, look at you. You've really got a... Wow,
133160	139960	your game is really coming along. Okay. Fuck stars, or whatever other trophies you want.
139960	143820	That's right. That's spinning bacon right there. Okay, so you have spinning bacon instead
143820	148840	of stars for your racing game on how you ranked in a particular level. Yes. Wow, your game
148840	155320	is looking pretty rad, I gotta say. Alright, look at you. Anyways. When are we gonna get
155320	160040	a demo? When do I get to play it? When do I get to play it? Soon. I'm just working on
160040	165600	finishing the finish sequencing where it shows, there's a whole, I gotta show you during break
165600	170320	and stuff, there's a whole explosion and stuff like that. And it actually does calculate
170320	174320	your time now and compares it to a record time and eventually a world record time, which
174320	179320	will be the online leaderboards. Online leader? What the hell? You're making like a full-fledged
179320	188320	PS4 game over here. This is crazy. Yes, but I have to think, was it one of, well the person
188320	193400	I'm using the assets from, you know, Raccoon Media, they're the ones that do all the low
193400	198360	poly track stuff that I've been using. I put it out on Twitter, I was like, I gotta find,
198360	205360	you know, bacon that's low poly that kind of looks like this guy's stuff. And then he's
205360	209600	like, you mean like this? And he whipped something together real quick. I'm like, that's so awesome.
209600	215400	So yeah. Wait, so these guys Raccoon Media, you said? Yeah, Raccoon. They make stuff and
215400	218760	you're allowed to just take it? They make all the art and you take it for your game?
218760	225120	No, they make art assets. He sells stuff on the asset store. And so he's got like a, you
225120	229440	know, one set of assets on the asset store. He also releases a lot of stuff for free.
229440	234360	He kind of started off of, there's this guy, Kenny, Assets Jesus, as you know, they like
234360	240600	to call him. He does a bunch of, you know, free assets that are out there for people
240600	246360	to use. And his is all CC zero. See, I forgot, I haven't used Unity enough still cause you
246360	250920	know, my game is never moving along here cause I get distracted with all this other stuff.
250920	255480	But I forgot that there's that asset store within Unity. So it's kind of like you have
255480	259000	like a, for lack of a better term, iTunes or Google play within Unity where you can
259000	262400	buy these things that you use in your game. Or even free stuff. There's free stuff out
262400	267520	there too. But like I went ahead, I support him because I purchased his set, but he also
267520	271560	has like a bunch of other ones, like five other ones that are free currently. And he
271560	273040	keeps releasing more stuff for him.
273040	275400	You basically got frequent customer bacon.
275400	281640	Exactly. It's awesome. But I was literally putting something, so I've made my own stuff
281640	286480	for my, I've made my own stuff for my game in the same style as his and it actually looks
286480	292920	pretty cool. But, um, you know, I was actually starting to make bacon. It just kind of, it
292920	297440	is similar, but his looks so much better than what I was putting together and it was just
297440	299840	awesome. So he just knows how to build a better bacon.
299840	304960	He just, he's just better at Blender. See, cause I, I tried to learn Blender. I watched
304960	309000	videos on how to learn Blender. I actually did 3D Studio Max for a while and went through
309000	313920	like a whole online course on that stuff. And I had it down a little bit, but then my
313920	318000	computer crashed and so I lost 3D Studio Max. But I tried going back in the Blender again
318000	323960	and I just, I get lost. I don't know. I just, it's one of those things right now. I'm, I'm
324000	329320	going the, I'm, I'm kind of going through the steps like I did before where I try to
329320	333360	find a way around what I want to do, but really I ended up having to go back and actually
333360	337800	learn how to do it the correct way. So now I'm still in that work around phase where
337800	344120	I'm doing everything in SketchUp, which is Google's free program. And, um, it works well
344120	348680	for me, especially for low poly stuff. Cause it's just, you know, I know how many inches
348680	354620	each one of those cubes are in their space and then I can make, um, stuff that's to scale
354620	359560	for that and it works out perfect. But, uh, yeah, it's so much easier when you have someone,
359560	364000	you know, designing something that looks pretty awesome. So, uh, but yeah, he should be, he's
364000	368240	supposed to be releasing, just told me, uh, over Twitter that he's releasing his car assets
368240	372280	pack and his city pack soon, which I've been looking forward to cause it's pretty awesome
372280	376360	looking. But yeah, so check it out. Glad to hear things are moving along with your game.
376360	379920	Uh, I want to introduce our chat room because we always have the live chatters here with
379920	383920	our program. Uh, we are the show where every gamer has a voice and you can lend your voice
383920	388160	alive at Sunday nights at the voice of geeks network of vog network.com because that is
388160	391440	where we tape the show at the voice geeks network every Sunday night at six o'clock
391440	395200	Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And if you are listening
395200	400320	live, we have a chat room at live dot vog network.com. Uh, and Bobby Black Wolf says,
400320	405960	I want to have the hashtag vog jam to start before Loki finishes his hashtag vog jam one
405960	411080	game. And then maybe I already started a new it's vog jam belated. So it makes a little
411080	415480	dig at me saying, when do you get to play any of the vog jam games? Yeah. See, here's
415480	419600	the thing I, and I, I'm still holding to it. I will not participate. I will not endorse,
419600	424480	participate, uh, rally up a second jam until I completely finished the first one. And yeah,
424480	428480	it may take a while, but, uh, I've got a lot, you know, some of you guys that know me outside
428480	431060	shows, I got a lot going on in my personal life right now, especially with my day job
431060	435520	and some things happening there. So it's just kind of push some things back. Sadly, I'm
435520	439600	not always, I know this is going to sound horrible, but I'm not always like in the mood
439600	443480	to do a peppy YouTube when I get home from work. I'm with, I'm with you there cause like
443480	447880	I was going to work on the game last night and instead I got distracted by, what was
447880	454240	it that, um, the what's wrong with blah, blah, blah movies or whatever. I watched like about,
454240	458080	I don't know, a dozen of those and they're about like 20 minutes long each. I was like,
458080	463240	Oh damn, it's like mid 1230 at night and I've done nothing. I'm so tired. And I want
463240	467000	to make sure your games get me in a good mood cause you guys' games deserve that. And I'm
467000	470280	in a good mood now. I had a great day yesterday and I'll talk about that a little while during
470280	474600	our gaming weeks and so on. But I want to get into tonight's show and some of the video
474600	478080	gaming news that's going on out there in the world. Um, let's start off with tonight's
478080	482840	kickoff topic and tonight's kickoff topic is something that really everybody's been
482840	488000	talking about out there on Twitter and Facebook and all the social media. This story is spread
488000	493120	like wildfire, which is interesting because the story is a big fat rumor. But when the
493120	498480	rumor is reported by the wall street journal, well, it's not like this is something coming
498480	504160	from a gaming blog we've never heard of or something trashy filthy like Perez Hilton
504160	508600	or TMZ or something, which are both Hollywood sites, but still, uh, this is still coming
508600	511600	from the wall street journal, which is something a little bit bigger. And they have a run a
511600	516760	report where the legend of Zelda, only one of the most popular video game series of all
516800	525080	time, uh, is in the works to become a television show at Netflix, which I I'm sure a lot of
525080	528960	you have had to process that information at some point this week. If you haven't until
528960	534440	now take a minute to kind of go, wow, I, um, I would have never guessed that that was going
534440	539440	to be a pairing that happened. Um, so the video streaming service right now, they are
539440	543280	in early stages, whatever that means. I don't know if that's, you know, they're putting
543280	547520	together a pilot, a pitch, who knows what that is, uh, of developing this live action
547520	553360	series that will be based on the legend of Zelda. Uh, they're describing it as a game
553360	560200	of Thrones for a family audience. So they're looking for writers right now to work on this
560200	567440	show, uh, which will be set in Hyrule as assumably. Um, I, the report says that Zelda's about
567440	572680	a boy named link who has to rescue press princess Zelda. I think that is actually a leap to
572680	576960	assume that the show would even necessarily have link and Zelda in it. Hear me out here
576960	583620	for a minute. Um, but anyhow, moving on with the story. Um, these, uh, Zelda games of course
583620	587640	have the sword and sorcery like something like game of Thrones, like Lord of the rings.
587640	591960	Uh, but this could be something that they could gear towards the whole family. Uh, Netflix
591960	597460	reportedly is working closely with Nintendo. Um, and of course, legend of Zelda originally
597460	602620	premiered in 1987, but we all know there was the animated Zelda that ran on Fridays
602620	607180	during the Super Mario Brothers Super Show. We all know about the 93 Nintendo Super Mario
607180	612200	Brothers movie, which has made Nintendo very wary to work with anybody else. Uh, so we
612200	615280	don't know what's going on with this because of course Netflix isn't confirming it and
615280	621900	Nintendo will not comment on rumors or speculation. So for all we know, this could be something
621900	628900	where Netflix wants to do this and is readying the pitch for Nintendo, but isn't even there
628900	633940	yet. I mean, we just don't know where this is at. So it is way too soon to talk about
633940	638340	who are they going to cast as link? Who are they going to cast as Zelda? Is Loki going
638340	644180	to be tingle? Like we keep, did you like that Twitter campaign I started by the way? Yeah,
644180	648420	if it pays, well fine, I'll do it. I like that. That's a change of heart. Hey, it's
648420	657300	money, whatever, money and whatever. I'm fine. So I'll don the spandex for that. Yeah,
657300	662840	I don't know what's going to happen with this if it's even really something real, but certainly
662840	666520	a lot of people are talking about it. And with the Wall Street Journal running it, I
666520	671840	think this at least confirms it sounds like their source is inside Netflix. So it sounds
671840	677100	like Netflix is definitely plotting something, but I mean that could even be something that's
677100	682520	inspired by Zelda, but isn't necessarily going to be using the Zelda IP. I mean, there's
682520	689500	just a lot of ideas on what this could really be. I just, I have a lot of questions about
689500	695300	this. Now, assuming that Nintendo and Netflix have reached an arrangement, that just starts
695300	701220	this whole other line of thought like, A, how on earth did Netflix convince Nintendo
701220	706400	to let them do this? I mean, this is so huge. And you know, Nintendo's been burned with
706400	711260	some of this stuff in the past. I mean, and we see Jason in the chat, VXX Jason XV over
711260	715840	at live.vognetwork.com says, was the Mario movie explicitly stated as a source of strife
715840	721520	like that? It has in the past, Jason, yes. And Jason says, and not the CDI Nintendo stuff.
721520	727000	That has two actually, but I think more people know the movie than know the CDI games. So
727000	731620	when the Wall Street Journal, which is more mainstream thing, runs it. That was just a,
731620	735120	there was a lot of bad movies in that time. And just because it happened to be a Mario
735160	739800	movie doesn't mean it was bad because it was, it was bad because it was in that time frame
739800	746400	where there's a lot of bad cheesy movies that came out. Sure. And I, I kind of go, it's
746400	751880	still interesting to me that Nintendo would be working with an American company like that,
751880	757240	Netflix, like what, what is this arrangement entail? And I'm going to get super tinfoil
757240	762360	hatty here, but this is what we do sometimes is we, you know, kind of make predictions
762440	767600	and try to figure out where things could be going. I mean, where Netflix does make a lot
767600	773880	of sense. Netflix is a power player in why people buy these gaming consoles in the first
773880	778600	place because gaming consoles are not necessarily gaming consoles anymore. They're living room
778600	784680	box entertainment devices. I mean, why is that? Because I think they should just be
784680	788440	gaming consoles, but shaking my fist to cloud. Oh, that's just, but that's, that's where
788440	792720	we're at now. I mean, more people watch Netflix on the, I have no problem with getting more
792720	799040	value out of my purchase. That's just me. I don't, I don't hate the fact that game consoles
799040	804200	want to be more and I get why they want to do it, but certainly I don't want them to
804200	808280	ever lose sight of the games. And I think maybe that would be the concern why you don't
808280	813360	want them to dip in all this other stuff. But anyway, I digress. Um, so it kind of makes
813360	819560	me wonder, could there be some really weird arrangement where Netflix is doing this for
819560	825560	Nintendo because Nintendo is going to get something out of Netflix that could possibly
825560	835080	make the Wii U, the 3DS or the Wii U's successor, the must have entertainment box the way the
835080	840160	Wii was. Now note, I don't think for a minute this means that Netflix would like disappear
840160	844280	from PlayStation or Xbox. That's not what I think at all. That would just be shooting
844280	850480	themselves in the foot. But could the next evolution of Netflix be something that's a
850480	855960	little more unique to the Wii U's successor? No. Could this be the beginning of a partnership?
855960	859640	I don't think so. You think I'm being too tinfoil hat? Why? Why? Cause I think they're
859640	863320	just licensing their property. They have it being made into a show. I think it's more
863320	867260	beneficial for Netflix to have something to compete with game of Thrones than it is for
867260	875020	Nintendo to have a show for Zelda. Netflix jumping on this, I'm not questioning at all.
875020	880400	They'd be stupid not to. Nintendo jumping in on this is where I have all the questions.
880400	884720	That's the part that doesn't make sense. What does Nintendo have to gain from this? They
884720	892380	make money in licensing. Because if it blows up like Game of Thrones did, they could make
892380	898740	a ton of money on that. I think that's what they want to do. They want to make as little
898740	905560	effort to make money as possible. Let's see. Bobby Blackwolf points out Sky. 3DS Netflix
905560	914540	gets 3D movies. I actually forgot about that. 3D, supposedly, is on its way out. I shouldn't
914540	920460	say that to the man who loves the Oculus Rift. It's not on its way out. It's just gonna be
920460	926860	dormant for a while until VR and that kind of stuff takes over. Basically, you're gonna
926860	934660	have that kind of content when that stuff is more popular and mainstream, I think. Asking
934660	939020	someone to buy a 3D TV is kind of ridiculous. Bobby was throwing that out there as a possibility.
939020	942460	Not something where they don't have 3D movies yet. Just that that's a possibility of something
942460	946860	that could happen. Saying, we'll get 3D movies on the 3DS client if we can get a TV show
946860	956540	from you. This is where my head was going. There's a really underutilized feature on
956540	960420	the Wii U that I bet half the owners out there don't even remember that this is a thing on
960420	965380	their Wii U. There's a feature called TV where that Wii U gamepad will function as a remote
965380	972540	control for your TV. Big deal, right? But then you can also, with big epic TV shows
972540	979180	and sports games, you can do a special Miiverse chatroom type thing that allows you to have
979180	983460	TV watching be a little bit more of a social experience. For whatever reason, Nintendo
983460	989180	doesn't really hype this up or promote it. But I was thinking, a lot of people were upset
989180	994380	when they removed the party feature from Netflix on the Xbox 360. I don't know if that was
994380	999780	a licensing thing or what this thing could be. But maybe, especially now that Netflix
999780	1004500	is dabbling in all their own original series, especially one that could be based around
1004500	1009780	The Legend of Zelda, could there be a social watching experience? Could parties be coming
1009780	1011340	back to an Nintendo platform is what I'm saying.
1011340	1016140	I just don't see that as, I mean, it's cool. It's a neat feature and a plus, but it's not
1016140	1020820	a plus. It's like, oh my God, I have to buy that console. That's the thing is I just don't
1020820	1027300	see what they could possibly do that would make me have to buy this console because X
1027300	1033340	features on there from Netflix. It just doesn't make any sense to me. I think it's more making
1033340	1040300	money from licensing this property and having Netflix run with it and make it into something
1040300	1045340	that's really good. And it's a plus for Netflix because they have something that competes
1045340	1048340	with all the people that want to watch Game of Thrones and have HBO.
1048340	1052840	You might convince me of what you're saying. If it was Nintendo would rather do this than
1052840	1059320	make a mobile phone Mario. And that I would believe, um, don't count anything out yet. Maybe
1059320	1063680	investor pressure. I don't know. Uh, let's see, looking at other comments from chat, uh, that
1063680	1068600	retro code and chat says, would it be, would it have been better if Sony had done God of War with
1068600	1074680	Netflix? Well, see, here's the interesting thing though. See with Sony, Sony is such a big, Sony
1074680	1080320	makes TVs for God's sake. Sony also has their own entertainment arm. So everything that they do is
1080320	1084520	in house and they have this whole powers thing that they're doing. That's going to be on the
1084520	1090160	PlayStation and they've done it all in house. Microsoft was taking a very similar approach.
1090320	1095440	They had founded their own entertainment studios that then they closed right soon after that
1095440	1098880	without producing a whole lot of stuff. I mean, there was that documentary, which is apparently
1098880	1104120	pretty good. I still need to watch it. Uh, there's, um, still that quantum break series.
1104120	1108080	Something's going to happen with that. So Microsoft for all practical purposes was kind of
1108120	1113680	trying to do their own thing, but maybe, maybe a partnership like, like this is in Microsoft's
1113680	1118520	future. Who knows? Maybe after Nintendo saw what happened to Microsoft, Nintendo was like, we
1118520	1122000	should partner up with somebody. Not that I think Nintendo would have ever produced something like
1122000	1127760	this themselves. I don't know. But then, but then I think about those Pikmin movies that Miyamoto
1127760	1132720	did for the film festivals. So couldn't it be, I don't know. It's so confusing. So confusing.
1133320	1139200	There's no easy answer. This could all just be a big pile of poo too. This could all just be the
1139200	1145120	biggest fucking rumor ever. And I mean, not to, you know, obviously if the wall street journal is
1145120	1149240	running it, I put a little bit of credit in that, but maybe people are just making a bigger deal
1149240	1153840	out of it. This could be a pitch pilot for Netflix and that's it.
1153880	1157880	Well, then I kind of go back to also, you know, Sony making stuff out of their properties. I
1157920	1164200	mean, you have the ratchet and clank movie coming out and you've also got, there was another one
1164200	1169000	too that they were doing. Um, God, I don't even remember what it was now. Maybe in chart, was it
1169000	1171080	uncharted? Were they doing the uncharted movie? I don't know.
1171120	1175320	Yeah, I think I heard them say they were there in the early stages of that. Cause wasn't, um, it
1175320	1179480	wasn't, what's his name? The, no, I'm thinking I'm mixing it up with Assassin's Creed.
1179640	1186120	Yeah. Assassin's Creed. There's a ton of video game movies coming out and eventually they'll get
1186120	1191320	better. I mean, they're not going to screw up. It's impossible for them to eventually, eventually
1191320	1195160	they've got to make a good video game possible for them. They screw up every single one.
1195160	1199800	Eventually they're going to have to accidentally do it right. So monkey at the typewriter will
1199800	1207840	write Shakespeare eventually. It's going to happen eventually. Uh, let's see a dark soccer before we
1207840	1212640	get into gaming weeks. What are your thoughts on a Zelda TV show? Is this of interest to you at all?
1213520	1220320	As long as it's not like Game of Thrones, because I really don't care much for medieval politics.
1221600	1225760	Yeah. I don't, I don't think that it would really get into, I mean, if it's supposed to be a family
1225760	1230280	friendly show, I think a lot of things they do on Game of Thrones, no sleeping with your sister.
1230480	1235680	You can't really do any of that, but I think it also opens the possibility that what if the show
1235680	1241640	is just Hyrule? What if these are all characters that exist? Real wives of Hyrule.
1242680	1246760	For all we, I mean, for all we know, who says Lincoln's Zelda have to be in it at all?
1247680	1248640	It's all about Impa.
1249440	1254880	Oh, I just, it could be something set in the Zelda universe. Then maybe that would be something where
1254880	1258960	Nintendo's a little more willing to let it go. It'll be like Gotham.
1260840	1261320	What?
1262120	1266320	That would be sad. But by the way, I do have something else to talk about.
1266360	1266800	What's that?
1266800	1268320	If you don't mind giving me half a moment.
1268720	1273200	Sure. But can I do some comments from chat real real quick over at live.vognetwork.com just the last
1273200	1278800	few comments on this. That retro code in chat says, if it is a rumor, it gained a lot of attention
1278800	1284520	than anything Sony and Microsoft have done with their shows. VXJ6V says it won't be like Game of
1284520	1294200	Thrones, less sex and nudity. William Murderface suggests Hyrule Shore, GTL, Jim Triforce Laundry.
1294200	1300120	I don't know. Um, let's see. Dungeon Buster says medieval politicking with the Lannisters does not
1300120	1305080	equal family friendly. You know, I just, I don't think, I think you guys might be taking the Game
1305080	1308840	of Thrones comparisons a little too literally. I think that's just, you know, they see that that,
1309000	1313480	that audience is out there for medieval fantasy, like Lord of the Rings.
1313480	1315280	We don't need Chair of Master Swords.
1316680	1320320	All right. Before we get into gaming weeks, you have some things you want to talk about too, Jamie.
1320320	1326240	Yes. Now there is a game out there that I have known about it being built for a few years now, and
1326240	1331840	now it is finally released. It's done by a good friend of mine who I worked as his intern for a
1331840	1336040	while and he's one of my teachers and a couple other friends of mine have contributed in design,
1336440	1343960	but, um, it's called FLOM. F L O M M. You can get it on the App Store now. It's for iOS, um, with
1344200	1352040	iPhone and iPad. And it's basically, it's based in art history, typography and the battle for
1352040	1358040	modern art. So. This is really funny to me because when we were pitching ideas for the VOGJAM a
1358040	1363000	couple months ago, I remember a buggy game one, you had suggested we should do a game that involves
1363000	1367560	like typography and art. So it sounds like you kind of got your game after all. It's just not
1367560	1371320	really a part of the VOGJAM. It was a tease. And it was one of your teachers that did it, but.
1371320	1379880	But, um, you, you just, just actually, if you go on Google and look for FLOM, F L O M M, you'll
1379880	1386120	find it right away. Check out the artwork in it. It's amazing. The music's cool. It's a, it's $2.99,
1386120	1390120	but honestly, for all the work that went into it and how awesome it is, it's totally worth it.
1390120	1396760	So everyone, you've got three bucks somewhere in your pocket. Go get FLOM. All right. And who
1396760	1401240	knows, maybe I can get Steve to come on the show. All right. If enough people download it and say,
1402200	1407560	come on the show, we'll make that happen. All right. Cool. Very cool. Well, let's talk about
1407560	1411720	our gaming weeks. Uh, I know you have not had enough time to play that all week cause that
1411720	1415160	just came out. So how was your gaming week? What types of video games have you been playing this
1415160	1422920	week? Otherwise, Jamie, dragon age, lots of drag, D A I I'm assuming die. Yeah. I've been playing
1422920	1426680	a lot of dragon age, but I've mostly been writing a lot of dragon age and you still haven't left
1426680	1433320	the hinterlands. Yes. Well, no, we keep going back to the hinterlands cause I've decided that
1433320	1437800	because I missed a solace on, um, the last time around, I'm actually going to get all
1437800	1441960	the stupid shards to finish that. And then I don't know. And I'm romancing Colin with my
1441960	1447080	human, with her weird face. I'll show everybody pictures of her weird face. When I find them
1447080	1451000	over in her chair, she's, it's not weird. She's just unique. She kind of looks like in bread
1451000	1457880	nobility. Only you would sit there and think about these types of things as you're making
1457880	1462680	the character. Like I have to make her authentic for my RP to work. I'm going to need her to be
1462680	1472360	slightly inbred. Well, hello. Aren't all nobles inbred inbred worse than, I don't know if I would
1472360	1478040	say all that's, that could be a very slanderous statement. Okay. They're just, history is
1478040	1484040	fascinating. Let's just leave it at that. History is fascinating. They're all a bit frumpy, aren't
1484040	1492360	they? Because it's a bad idea when cousins marry. All right. Uh, let's move on to a Loki. How was
1492360	1499720	your gaming week? Um, my game week was okay. I did play, uh, well, one thing I finished playing,
1499720	1508360	um, was it, uh, saints group got out of hell. I 100% in game. I haven't gotten all the trophies
1508360	1514440	yet, but I don't know if I'm going to just because it's, it's now it's doing all the tedious shit
1514440	1519720	that they want you to do in the game. Like drive for like 3000 miles or something like that. It's
1519720	1526200	like, why would you drive any car when you can fly through the entire game? It's like, I don't
1526200	1530840	understand that, but okay. That's one of the things I have to do or play co-op for three hours
1530840	1536680	in this game. I'm like, no, no, I'm not going to do that. So I pretty much, I am, I've done with
1536680	1541240	the game, so I don't know if I'm really going to play any further with that. I did download the
1541240	1545480	battlefield hard lane beta today, so I'm going to probably check that out because that looks
1545480	1552520	right at my alley. Um, what else did I play this week? I don't know. I thought about playing
1552520	1556520	Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto, but I just didn't get around to it. Just worked at my game
1556520	1562840	mostly. So, um, you know, hopefully we'll have that to something more playable because right now
1562840	1567240	I just have kind of the first level and it's more of an intro. It doesn't really have anything. It's
1567240	1571320	um, you know, but once I get the whole, once you get the engine built then yeah, once it,
1571320	1574680	I've got the front, then you get to do the stuff you've been wanting to do since the very beginning.
1574680	1580200	Oh, I got all sorts of crazy ideas. I know you do. That'll be fun. Um, so yeah, I'll do that.
1580200	1583400	And once again, as mentioned, you know, big thanks to, you know, Raccoon Media for
1584120	1588280	the art assets and stuff. Um, and I haven't creamed some of my stuff, but yeah, you can
1588280	1591880	check out their stuff. They've got, um, you know, a lot of free packs out there, especially if
1591880	1596200	you're like looking to make like mobile games or, you know, even just regular games. I was at Raccoon
1596200	1601880	media, raccoon-media.nl is their website. And they, I think they're on blend swap and the assets
1601880	1605000	soar and there's one other one, but I don't remember. I'm the only one without something
1605000	1610200	to pitch tonight. I'm sorry. He asked me, they asked me the pitches. These are all good reasons.
1611240	1616680	I had, you know, I feel indebted with the low poly bacon. He gave you free bacon. The man gave me
1616680	1621080	bacon over the internet. That's like, we're now living in the future. I understand. I understand.
1622680	1626840	You don't have to convince me. It's fine. But, uh, yeah, that's what I played. So hopefully,
1626840	1631080	um, I may play something else this week. I did install a few more games. I had in my steam
1631080	1637080	backlog and bought more. Why? I don't know. I bought the star Wars humble bundle. This
1637080	1641480	you're never going to play it. You're never going to play. I know I'm never going to have
1641480	1647320	the hours to play those games. You don't have them. I'm never, it's like, they do not exist.
1647320	1652280	I'm like a hoarder. Seriously. It's like hoarding, except it's all digital. So it
1652280	1658520	doesn't make any of the mess, but yes, it's, it's, it's seriously the problem right there.
1658520	1663320	It, how many, how many games in your collection have you still not played?
1664600	1671800	Most of them. I don't know. I have a lot. I haven't even installed the new ones. I just got
1671800	1677640	today. So, or added to, I haven't even added them into my library yet, but I've got 335 games. Sorry.
1677640	1685560	In my library. I don't know. Uh, non game plane related. I did see some leaked screenshots from
1685560	1690520	just cause three and I, I had, I totally have to buy that day one now because it looks amazing.
1693720	1698920	That's it. That's it. All right. Someday we're going to see you on one of those like TLC shows,
1698920	1703080	uh, about hoarding. Oh, someday I'm going to look like, look back and see how much I actually spent
1703080	1708600	on my steam library after a long time. Like, Oh my God, what was I doing? At least. Okay. At least
1708600	1713240	with humble bundle, at least you can donate it to charity. So it's like a little, I have to,
1713240	1717720	I have to be a lot less judgy with that. And the thing is like a lot of the games I'm getting,
1717720	1723560	you know, it's just like 10 games for 11 bucks. And so, I mean, it's hard to kind of just like,
1724760	1730520	I may play it someday, but it's a buck. Okay. But sometimes, sometimes that also,
1730520	1733400	I'm not saying this with a humble bundle and not saying this about star Wars games,
1733400	1737560	but I'm just saying sometimes you can also get like, you know, you remember like they
1737560	1744280	would have the NES cartridges. It's like 96 ROMs in one and like 54 of them are just
1744280	1750120	like pallet swaps on clue, clue land. Like not every game is something you have to,
1751240	1758600	you don't need it. You don't need it. But I do. And no, here's the worst part. Here's the
1758600	1762200	worst part. It's starting to get like down to PlayStation network too. And that, Oh my God.
1762200	1766760	Oh my God. I want to have a show. Okay. This is my pitch to TLC. Are you, there's somebody from
1766760	1770840	TLC listening to the show. This is my pitch. This is my pitch. Okay. It's just like they do. You've
1770840	1775800	seen Hoarders. Surely you've all seen that show, right? And they go and they, they, they, they
1775800	1780680	clean the person's house or whatever. And the person has to like one little pile at a time
1780680	1787880	decide, do I really need this? Or should I throw it away? And like, there's always some like
1787880	1792680	crumpled up piece of garbage that the person just loses their fucking mind over because they can't
1792680	1796760	throw it away. Right. This is just, and I shouldn't make light of an illness and I'm not like not,
1796760	1804440	but I mean, it's television and they are putting themselves on TV. So. But Loki, I feel like there
1804440	1809240	should be a show where you're forced to sit there with your Steam collection and like the host comes
1809240	1816440	in and says, okay, Loki, you have 750 games in your Steam collection. Today, we're going to cut
1816440	1824760	that down to 50 and I need you to pick which 710 games are we going to delete forever? What if
1826600	1831960	Loki's games are so wildly popular that he becomes the next Andy Warhol of video games.
1833320	1839080	You see what that man collected a warehouse full of multiples of plates and lunch boxes and trash
1839080	1843400	cans. And he would never let any of his staff throw anything away. They had to sneak out the
1843400	1848600	trash when he wasn't there. What if- I'm not that bad. We're talking digital games here to
1848600	1852360	take no space. If it's like physical games, then yeah, that might be a problem because I have to
1852360	1855960	move that stuff around. I don't know anything about that. It's in the cloud. I don't know
1855960	1861800	anything about physical games that we keep in storage at Dan's mom's house. Oh yeah. Oh man.
1861800	1865400	I mean, again, I said I shouldn't make light of this, but I kind of, I kind of grew up around
1865400	1870440	this because my dad kind of has these like hoarding tendencies and like our garage was
1870440	1875960	just full of like weird stuff. Like there would be pens that no longer work that would be in a jar.
1875960	1879720	Like these are just things that my dad just happens to collect. And I remember,
1879720	1884280	I will never forget this. Do you remember when the big flood happened in the nineties and Bill
1884280	1887560	Clinton came to visit? Well, you weren't here at the time. You probably heard about it in the news.
1887560	1890200	Bill Clinton, who was the president at the time came to visit and all this stuff. So it was a big
1890200	1895000	flood. Now our garage flooded during that whole thing. So my dad was devastated because a lot of
1895000	1899240	his stuff got damaged. Well, I remember one day we were out there cleaning and trying to sort,
1899240	1902200	like, you know, what do we have to put in the dumpster? Cause it's wet and gone forever.
1902200	1907800	And there was a big pile of dry stuff. And my mom looks at it and goes, Rob, Rob, Rob, I'm going to
1907800	1913400	send your father into the house. Rob, I want you to get the hose and I want you to spray this all
1913400	1923560	down. I shouldn't tell that story on my radio show, but damn. I mean, these are just, these
1923560	1927800	are just the stories that shape the person that I am today. So, you know, there you go.
1928360	1933960	I will eventually play all these games once I have, you know, enough free time. So if someone
1933960	1938600	takes the kids for like maybe a few years, then we'll have enough time to play through all these
1938600	1943640	games. Once you're saving for retirement is what you're doing. Oh yeah, exactly.
1945400	1950280	All right. Anyhow, uh, before I tell more stories from my childhood, I should probably get into my
1950280	1954520	gaming week and the types of video games that I've been playing this week. Um, a lot of the
1954520	1959720	same old standard standby stuff. I played some, you know, Diablo three, been a lot of that,
1959720	1962920	especially with the season ending. There's been a lot of stuff going on with Diablo three. I'm
1962920	1967160	looking forward to the next season soon. I've been playing a bit on PlayStation four as well,
1967160	1970840	because like I said, at the beginning of the year, I want to go after my platinum trophy.
1970840	1976680	So I started a new character and things are going well there. Um, excuse me, I've also been playing
1976680	1980760	more fantasy life, uh, cause I got some more street passes over the weekend. That was pretty
1980760	1985480	cool to finally see like new people show up in my village. And that's kind of neat. I like what
1985480	1990840	they do with that in fantasy life, but besides the, uh, good old standards that I've been playing
1990840	1996520	from week to week on this show, I got to play a lot of good old games over the weekend because I
1996520	2001640	went to an event that we talked about a couple of weeks ago on the show. I went to the rockage event
2001640	2007400	in San Jose, uh, which some people were lovingly calling and I saw this as a street passes. I got
2007400	2012840	some people were lovingly calling it mag west because of course, as we talked about with Eric
2012840	2016760	on the show a couple of weeks ago, when he was here, uh, we talked about how mag fest is now
2016760	2023160	sponsoring this fourth, uh, year of the rockage event in San Jose. Um, so basically at the San
2023160	2027640	Jose student union, they had the whole second floor and I think they were running some tabletop
2027640	2031800	on the first floor as well, but they had the whole second floor of the student union kind of sealed
2031800	2037000	off where, you know, you, you, you get your admission wristband and you get in and you have
2037000	2043320	access to basically three main areas. You have kind of the, the LA the foyer area, and then you
2043320	2048680	have the, the lounge stage, and then you have the main stage. And in the main stage, they had some
2048680	2053720	bands playing on and off throughout the day. And they also had a collection of classic video games,
2053720	2057640	uh, that I believe a lot of that was borrowed from the California extreme event, uh, that they
2057640	2062440	do here over the summer. Uh, so they had some classic games from the eighties. I got to play
2062440	2067960	some tempest, wizard of war. They had a Tron arcade machines. That was awesome. If you follow
2067960	2072920	me on Twitter, you saw that I got the number one score on Qbert. And so I put in Vaugas the
2072920	2079000	initials there cause F yeah, Qbert. Uh, and, uh, there was a point blank too. That was awesome to
2079000	2084280	play too. So this is a lot of like really cool, uh, retro arcade games and pinball games. And I've
2084280	2088360	never, I did not realize this was a thing, dark soccer, but there was, and now that I think about
2088360	2092040	maybe you have mentioned this on the show before, but I just never seen it, but they had a medieval
2092040	2098200	madness table and they had a tales of Arabian nights table, uh, table, but the dot matrix
2098200	2103080	displays were in color. Like they were modded to be color displays. And I didn't know that was
2103080	2107480	the thing people did. Yeah. You can get color LEDs and whatnot. I never knew that was a thing. I'd
2107480	2112280	never seen ones. That was really cool. There's, there's lots of, um, uh, like mods people will
2112280	2116600	people actually will buy kits to do certain things like with the newer tables too. Like,
2116600	2123080	well, Dan has, um, uh, I think a small mod on our Twilight zone. And then, um, for newer ones,
2123080	2128600	I showed you, uh, the pictures I took of a modded Tron that has like the arcade cabinet on it and
2128600	2134600	the extra lights and whatnot. So yeah, people do it all the time. So, uh, yeah. So I just,
2134600	2137400	maybe it's because I haven't been to California extreme in a few years, but that was like,
2137400	2142440	I was like, Oh, neat. So they have that. And then they had classic consoles kind of around
2142440	2147240	the perimeter of the main stage room. And then they had a lounge room that was a smaller room
2147240	2151800	and they had, they tried to make it a little more well loungy and no, it wasn't an orange
2151800	2155480	lounge. I'm sorry to say, but maybe we need to talk about that for next year. But anyway,
2155480	2160120	uh, they also had some classic consoles in there. So I got to play, like I got my Mario Kart 64 on,
2160120	2166120	which man, going from playing Mario Kart eight all the way back to play Mario Kart 64. Like
2166760	2170360	I forget that not all the tricks work and you can't drift the same way, but anyway,
2170360	2177080	it was still fun to go back and revisit that. So, um, also this is neat out in the lobby area,
2177080	2182360	they actually had, and I had yet to see one of these. They had a beat mania 2DX, uh, pen jewel.
2182360	2187400	I think the name of the mix is number 22 in the series. I had not seen one that new. I've never
2187400	2192280	seen a screen that crisp. I think it's on one of the new HD monitors. So I was like, wow, that's
2192360	2197320	kind of neat. Cause that was on free play. And then they had a new DDR, like the reboot of dance
2197320	2201240	dance revolution. They had that sitting right next to it. Now I didn't embarrass myself by
2201240	2205960	playing that in public because, you know, I talked about playing DDR last week and how easy I broke
2205960	2210440	sweat, but I watched some other girls playing it and watching some other people kind of rotate
2210440	2215000	through throughout the day. And I was like, Oh, neat. You know, it's just, it has an interface
2215000	2218520	that kind of reminds me of the Xbox games a little more. Uh, it was just kind of neat to see that a
2218520	2223480	little different. And they had some vendor tables, a lot of people, uh, dealing in classic games.
2223480	2228040	And then they actually had a third area for people to do music too. That was kind of off in the
2228040	2233160	corner. Um, so you'd have a lot more of the smaller, uh, rigs that would go over there.
2233160	2238840	Um, so yeah, it was music and it was, it was kind of like a little piece of a lot of conventions
2238840	2243800	I've been to in the past year or so kind of all hodgepodge together into this one thing. And
2243800	2249000	that was, that was pretty cool. Uh, I had a good time. I, you know, it's a three day event and
2249000	2252920	sadly I was only able to spend half a day there cause I just, you know, I had, I'm trying to do
2252920	2257640	this. The event is still going as we speak and I wanted to be here at OLR for you all. And I had
2257640	2261320	to drive to San Jose to get to this thing and I had my job. So, you know, I could only get there
2261320	2264920	for a half day, but I had a good time for the time I was there. Uh, I wish I could have brought
2264920	2269880	somebody else. I should, next year I'm going to have to really berate Jamie into going with me
2269880	2275080	if she's not working because, uh, it would have been nice to be able to play games together with
2275080	2279560	somebody or something cause I would have liked to have gone rather than, you know, what I was doing.
2281160	2283960	Well, maybe next year we'll plan better. We didn't have a lot of notice this year,
2283960	2289480	but I would definitely attend again next year. I had a good time. So, uh, and I, I have a feeling
2289480	2294280	this event is going to just get bigger and bigger. I have a feeling they're going to already outgrow
2294280	2298440	this space and next year they're going to look at something bigger. It wasn't super crowded in
2298440	2303000	the morning when I was there Saturday. In fact, I was kind of thinking like, wow, it's, I'm
2303000	2306280	surprised there's not a lot of people here, but then I started to think I was like, you know,
2306280	2310920	people are probably still hungover from last night. So I waited a little while and sure
2310920	2315160	enough as the day went on, it started to get pretty, pretty full and, uh, you couldn't even
2315160	2319960	really get on one of the classic arcade games without a wait. So, uh, I think they did a good
2319960	2323880	job attendance wise. I hope it was good enough to get the venue paid for and all that good stuff
2323880	2327080	so they can get an even bigger spot next year. But yeah, I had a good time at the Rockage event.
2327080	2332680	So congrats to all those responsible for putting it on and, uh, very talented musicians. I wish I
2332680	2336600	could have seen more, uh, just unfortunately, you know, again, I can only be there for a half day
2336600	2341000	and I can't be at all three stages at once, but I really enjoyed some of the stuff I was watching.
2341000	2345000	Dude, this one band, and I'm so sorry, I forgot the name of the band. I'm so sorry.
2345000	2351640	Uh, but they were rocking, they were playing, uh, songs using an accordion, a saxophone. They had
2351640	2356680	a fricking, I don't know if it was a, I think it was a marimba up on stage. Like they were just
2356680	2363000	doing all this like crazy. Was, was, was there a zither? I don't think so. But then, uh,
2363960	2367400	did you find a theremin? No, there was no there. Well, not that I saw that. I'm not saying there
2367400	2369560	wasn't one there, but there just wasn't the one there when I was looking. Did you find someone
2369560	2375640	playing a melodica? Uh, probably. Melodicas are awesome. So anyway, uh, I'm sure there'll be,
2375640	2379960	uh, I'm sure they're coming back next year. And I gotta say, you know, there's several listeners
2379960	2383880	out there that has said, Rob, you really need to come to MAGFest. You need to come to MAGFest.
2383880	2387000	When are you going to come to MAGFest? And I gotta be thinking, after going to Rockage,
2387000	2395480	I'm kind of thinking, yeah, I probably should go to MAGFest. So I'm not saying yes to next year
2395480	2400360	yet, but I'm saying I'm thinking about it more seriously than I ever have before. So there you
2400360	2406120	go. SSU 100 Matt in our chat says, Rockage was your taste of MAGFest. Now you have to come to
2406120	2410600	the real thing. It's just, it's just cost, flights, all that. That's the only thing stopping me. But,
2410920	2415240	we'll see. We'll see. I'm not saying no at this point. We'll see what happens.
2415880	2422520	So that was my gaming week and a weekend thereof. So, uh, quickly, some housekeeping. I don't have
2422520	2427160	a whole lot to report. I will just say, uh, twitter.com slash O-L-R is where you can follow
2427160	2432520	us on Twitter. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio is where you can follow us on Facebook.
2432520	2438520	I mentioned we may be missing a show in March. Uh, I'm not sure if that is sure yet. I will have
2438520	2443800	an update for you guys hopefully next week. Unfortunately, uh, I am having to play a little
2443800	2447960	bit of a waiting game, which is frustrating to say least, but we'll find out for you next week,
2447960	2452600	uh, or at least I'll make a decision by then. That's for sure. All right. Uh, so that's it
2452600	2458440	for housekeeping. Let's go into some gaming news for the night. Uh, kind of been an interesting
2458440	2461720	week in gaming news. There hasn't been a lot of it, but there's been some interesting things here
2461720	2469160	and there. Loki. Yeah. So apparently the, um, the release date for street fighter four on PC and
2469160	2475320	PlayStation four has been revealed, uh, supposed to be coming out. I don't have the exact date
2475320	2482840	here real quick. Um, March, 2016. So that's when it's kind of slated least right now,
2482840	2487640	at least they're thinking ahead. Um, so we'll have to see them. They're saying that the roster
2487640	2494040	of characters may be pretty small. Um, leaving room for DLC almost sounds like kind of a hybrid
2494040	2499400	version of how they did killer instinct where everything was almost a la carte, but I guess
2499400	2505960	we'll have to see, um, who actually ends up being in the launch roster. Uh, they're saying it's
2505960	2513640	going to be 16 characters and, um, I don't know. I'm just not that excited about street fighter
2513640	2519800	really anymore because I have to see what really the benefits are between street fighter four and
2519800	2525800	street fighter five. I don't know. For me, it's just characters actually. Yeah. The fact that
2525800	2533400	it's going back to a roster of 16 characters, it, it concerns me a little bit. Um, I, I, it does
2533400	2538520	feel like a step backwards when we're, and I, I realized some of the more people that are tuned
2538520	2542600	into the fighting game community and in series may argue with me a little bit on this because,
2542600	2548120	you know, if the, if the, um, technique and the game and all this is improving,
2548120	2552600	then they're not going to possibly be able to fit as many characters as street fighter Uber.
2552600	2556760	Here's the thing is all I'm thinking is what they do with Marvel versus Capcom three, where it's
2556760	2561080	like, yeah, I mean, they had a pretty decent roster with that, but then, Oh, Hey, you want
2561080	2565480	DLC characters. Those are gonna be five bucks each. You know, that's like, that's a legitimate
2565480	2570440	concern. I think in the year 2015, that's a very legitimate concern to have about the game. And I
2570440	2575320	hope to God, there isn't a bunch of them that are already on the disc. I would think if they're
2575320	2580200	going to release it on PC, they're not dumb enough to do that. Cause if the, if it's on the PC disc,
2580200	2585720	it'll be found like that. Right. So I'm thinking that won't happen, but I, I, I have that same
2585720	2591480	concern. And I think it's legitimate that you have 16 characters for now, but then it's going to be
2591480	2596680	16 more characters that slowly come out throughout the year that are $5 each. I would just, and maybe
2596680	2602280	that won't be the case, which is fine. I would just kind of like some clarity on that. I think
2602280	2607400	some DLC characters are inevitable. Yeah. I mean, that's just the age we live in, but,
2608680	2612200	and then I'm sure that we'll get a million and that's the other thing too. It's like,
2612200	2616600	why should I really buy the DLC characters? Why I'm, you know, super street fighter five
2616600	2621720	or arcade edition turbo, whatever the hell you want to, you know, re-release it as it's going
2621720	2625160	to come out with those characters in there and then the additional characters. And that's what
2625160	2631080	SSG100 Matt in our chat room says, so wait for ultra super street fighter five in holiday 2016.
2632680	2637320	So a lot of people are thinking if, if this game only releases with so many characters
2637320	2640840	and they do all these DLC characters, yeah, I'll just wait. I'll just wait for the year
2640840	2646520	end edition or what have you. Yeah. So I would like to hear more about the game mechanics and,
2646520	2653400	you know, why maybe the roster will be less. Um, I know in the case of like mortal combat X,
2653400	2657000	I think that game is supposed to have a smaller roster too. I think it's what it's 24. I think
2657000	2663000	immortal combat X I might be wrong. Uh, but, um, the thing with mortal combat X is that each
2663000	2666520	character is supposed to have like three different fighting styles, I think. Yeah. So even though you
2666520	2671560	have only 24 characters, you have all these fighting styles too. So like 72 characters,
2671560	2676600	right. But not, not to give one a pass where I'm not going to give the other a pass because I'm
2676600	2680520	sure, I'm sure it's inevitable that immortal combat actually have DLC characters. Why not?
2680520	2684760	They did it with last game. So it's just a question of, all right, how many, how many,
2684760	2692200	and should I just wait for the ultimate mortal combat X edition for that? Um, let's see that
2692200	2697320	retro code in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says I'm kind of over street fighter, even though
2697320	2701480	Sony got the exclusive on it. Um, I'm seeing certainly there's a lot of people that are very
2701480	2705000	excited about it. I mean, the fighting game community, of course, I'm kind of curious how
2705000	2709400	they're going to sell it to everybody else. Maybe people that aren't like super tuned into the
2709400	2712680	fighting game community and all those events and these, how are they going to sell it to the rest
2712680	2717400	of us? Cause yeah, I mean, there's going to be a lot of people, whether you want to agree with
2717400	2721320	me or not, I'm telling you, there's a lot of people that are going to look at it and go,
2721320	2724920	why would I buy this game that only has 16 people when I could buy this one that has
2725880	2732040	50 people in it? I mean, for some people, it's going to come down to that, whether you want to
2732040	2736760	admit it or not. I mean, obviously a fighting game, super fan will be able to rattle off a
2736760	2741080	list of reasons why that's wrong, but somebody who's just looking at the back of the box in a
2741080	2745480	GameStop that isn't as tuned in. I don't know. It's just like for me, like the difference between
2745480	2751080	like when they went and did, you know, street fighter four, which, you know, style-wise that
2751080	2755160	was, you know, completely different than what they had previously, you know, how it kind of went all
2755160	2761960	3d and everything, but it's still 2d, but now five, you know, the evolution from four to five
2761960	2767160	doesn't seem as big. Now I understand there's probably going to be a lot of stuff gameplay-wise,
2767160	2772200	tweaks, and that kind of thing, but for me, a person that's not, you know, super into
2773240	2779080	fighting games, I don't notice that. I just notice what it looks like, the roster of characters,
2779800	2785800	and is there anybody in there that, you know, kind of hooks me into the game, you know, and I just,
2785800	2789240	I'm not really seeing that yet. I mean, there's some gameplay things that they're doing that are
2789240	2793000	kind of neat, but it's just, you know, more of like, oh, that's kind of cool, you know,
2793000	2797320	other than like, oh wow, I got to really play that. So I don't know. We'll see.
2799000	2804920	All right. Well, let's see, moving on, talking about something else that happened this week with
2804920	2810040	Nintendo over in their camp, you know, Club Nintendo is being phased out. We don't know what
2810040	2815560	the replacement program looks like yet, but seeing as Club Nintendo as it is, I believe is fading
2815560	2821480	out, what, in June? I think you have until June to cash out on this stuff. It would make sense
2821480	2826440	that the successor program will be unveiled during E3. Obviously we don't know that for a fact,
2826440	2830600	but it would make an awful lot of sense, wouldn't it? Well, anyway, Club Nintendo went through an
2830600	2835160	update, as I mentioned this week, where there's a lot of stuff available. It's kind of like a
2835160	2839560	Hail Mary for the program where, you know, if you've accumulated coins and you haven't spent
2839560	2845000	them, there is plenty of stuff to spend it on now. I'm calling it now, exclusive amiibos through
2845000	2849560	whatever the replacement service is. Perhaps, and there's something coming up in the show later
2849560	2855000	where that may actually exactly be the case, but who knows? But, I mean, there are just virtual
2855000	2860680	console games galore, as well as even some full game downloads that aren't like virtual console,
2860680	2867800	like Harmonite for 3DS I saw on there, Dr. Mario on Wii U, even some retail titles were available
2867800	2873160	on there. And of course, some of that sweet Nintendo physical gear that I know a lot of you
2873160	2878360	are wanting to get your hands on. For example, there's a Zelda Majora's Mask messenger bag,
2878360	2884520	also a Majora's Mask jigsaw puzzle, which will set you back 800 coins. There's a Retro Mario
2884520	2891880	t-shirt for 700 coins, a Legend of Zelda 3DS XL pouch, and Animal Crossing playing cards for 600
2891880	2896360	coins. So, I mean, that's kind of cool that they have, like, not just the vast amount of virtual
2896360	2901080	console games, but all these physical rewards. So, they want to make sure people are going to flush
2901080	2906840	out their coins and everything will be spent. Here's the only problem. This launched, what,
2906840	2913400	Monday, Tuesday is when this all went down. The website has been getting hammered consistently
2913400	2919480	ever since. Here I am days after the fact, I'm even trying to load the page right now in studio.
2920520	2925320	Just spinning wheel, trying to get it to come up, waiting. I got to come up earlier, but I couldn't
2925320	2929960	log in to my computer. Like, this is, like, several days after the fact and this is still
2929960	2935320	broken. And so, there's a part of me that's like, this is why everybody says Nintendo
2935320	2941000	doesn't understand online. Because they demonstrate that they don't understand online.
2941000	2946840	Now, on one hand, Nintendo is really under no obligation to do Club Nintendo in the first place.
2946840	2951960	I mean, it is a nice thing that they do. They do get some things out of it for all those little
2951960	2956520	product surveys that you do and stuff. I mean, that is information that Nintendo may otherwise
2956520	2960600	have to pay some other type of outside firm to gather. So, it's not that Nintendo doesn't get
2960600	2964280	anything out of it. But for all practical purposes, they're under no obligation to do
2964280	2969560	anything like Club Nintendo in the first place. They're really not. So, I mean, even if Club
2969560	2978200	Nintendo didn't exist, you can't get that upset. However, it is still frustrating with as fanboy-y
2978200	2983800	as a lot of Nintendo people get, as we've seen through this whole amiibo fuckery. It is really
2983800	2988360	annoying when this stuff is being dangled in front of you and you know it's going to get
2988360	2993960	snapped up and disappear like that, but you're sitting there literally watching paint dry.
2993960	2998040	You're watching that spinning circle trying to connect to this website because Nintendo
2998680	3002600	doesn't have a queue system like Blizzard does when BlizzCon tickets go on sale or something
3002600	3008120	like that. Nintendo is not that progressed online in their website development where they have some
3008120	3013480	type of system to be able to handle the load that Nintendo ought to expect by now when they're going
3013480	3020920	to offer basically a free, essentially, Majora's Mask messenger bag. I mean, really? You didn't
3020920	3025400	think the site was going to get hammered right away? I don't know. So, here we are all these
3025400	3030920	days later. Oh, it finally loaded. Hey, maybe all that complaining worked. Finally loaded.
3030920	3040760	Now I just have to log in and maybe I can spend some coins. Maybe. Anyway, VX Jason in chat says,
3040760	3045480	they demonstrate they don't understand online. Really? Counterpoint. Every new MMO ever.
3045480	3050760	Blizzard doesn't know online? Really? MMO online connected game. I didn't say Blizzard doesn't know
3050760	3056200	online, but Blizzard isn't immune to some of these problems with their own games. However,
3056200	3061720	with things on the web like BlizzCon and so forth, they actually do. I mean, there have been years in
3061720	3066200	the past that haven't worked out so well, but for right now they have a system that's kind of
3066200	3071880	worked. I mean, they have the queuing system in UQ to buy everything in the store and it
3071880	3077320	works out for the BlizzCon stuff. So, I actually think in regards to selling things online,
3077320	3081640	Blizzard does have it worked out right now. I would just expect five days after the fact
3081640	3087880	Nintendo would have it a little more together. But again, technically they're not under any
3087880	3091560	obligation to even talk about it or to give this stuff away in the first place. Just like,
3091560	3096360	I want no obligation to buy their damn system. I guess that's true. I guess that's true.
3097080	3103800	All right. Vidpower in chat says, the servers for Mario Kart 8 and Smash 4 online play didn't die on
3103800	3108360	day one. How come their club Nintendo site is down for a week? And Rama follows that up with
3108360	3111640	different types of server. And yeah, that's probably the main point. They're probably
3111640	3116600	completely different server farms, wherever the game servers versus the web servers are. Still,
3117160	3122120	you know, whatever the technical reason for it, it ultimately doesn't matter. It's frustrating
3122120	3126680	for the consumer at the end of the day. The specific reason why doesn't really matter
3126680	3129880	in the grand scheme of things. Anyhow, moving on. Dark soccer.
3130520	3139240	Well, there's a game series that is well known for its interesting fashion choices on some of
3139320	3147000	the male characters and proportions for its female characters. And that's Dead or Alive.
3147000	3154040	Well, Dead or Alive 5 last round is going to be coming out on PC. And well, Yosuke Hayashi was
3154040	3159160	like, don't mod the game. Well, he's not saying don't mod the game, but he's afraid that modders
3159160	3166840	are going to be doing immoral things with the game. You don't say. Immorality in Dead or Alive.
3166840	3170360	Please, please. You've seen the Street Fighter mods already.
3171320	3176600	That's classic coming from, you know, the studio that develops Dead or Alive Extreme
3176600	3182760	Beach volleyball, which I'm sure is just a volleyball game and not some excuse to,
3183400	3189480	you know, have the characters romp around in almost nothing and dressing them up and stuff
3189480	3194200	like that. I'm sure that in no way do they mean to exploit any of the characters in the game.
3194760	3198280	So it's dress up dolls. You know, I'm sure that.
3200200	3205640	You know, I don't know, I'm sure that they haven't kind of provoked some sort of reaction
3205640	3210280	from their fans based on they know what the fans want. OK, and and they're giving it to them.
3210280	3215240	And unfortunately, there's nothing you can do. They will mod this so that they're nude.
3215240	3219000	The same thing happened when Street Fighter 4 came out in PC. They modded that. And yes,
3219080	3223560	there's new cammy mods and stuff like that. So it's just going to happen.
3224520	3229080	Well, to go back to what I was saying, he was pretty happy about it coming out on Steam,
3229800	3236600	but he did put out the warning to the PC modding community. And basically, I'm just going to read
3236600	3242520	the quote. We have to deal with mod issues from an IP holder perspective. We would ask we would
3242520	3250280	like to ask PC users to play our game in good moral and manner. Otherwise, we won't be able
3250280	3255960	to release a title for PC again. That hasn't stopped Capcom, first of all. Capcom is pumping
3255960	3267240	them out. And I do understand he is appealing to an entire group out there because you yeah,
3267240	3275640	you have this objectification or this extreme, I'm going to say extreme fashion taste in the game.
3276600	3284040	And it is, however, the way that they've branded it to be. It has their mark on it. It's what they
3284040	3291080	control. And putting it out on PC, they're relinquishing a degree of control over their
3291080	3296680	property. So I understand them wanting to put out a comment on that. At the same time,
3297640	3301800	it just makes me think that when they put out that comment, they're really just opening the door for
3301800	3306120	encouragement. Absolutely. That's exactly what I was going to say. It can't be hacked. Watch.
3306120	3312040	Is I mean, the unfortunate reality of internet toilet bowl culture of which we've seen a lot of
3312040	3320120	it in the past year. The reality of this is that by making these comments, now it's a race to who
3320120	3325400	can get the naked boobies first, who can get the booby mod done first. Now it's a race because
3325400	3329560	day one, it'll be there day one. If the, if the game comes out and has a woman in it,
3330600	3336040	or even a man, there's going to be a nude patch for it. I want, I want dong mode. I want dong
3336040	3341160	mode for the guys. It will, if you're going to not mod the women, mod the guys too. Whatever
3341160	3346360	your request, it will be there. But now it is a, it is a, uh, race to get it done first.
3346920	3353160	Well, at any rate, the game's going to be out on March 30th. So if you mod it though,
3353160	3356920	do it. We'll our mods too. Like we want our brand all over.
3360680	3366280	We want it to be on, um, Oh, on Zach's tentacle head piece thing.
3367800	3373160	Uh, Brad from pod culture with an interesting suggestion in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
3373160	3378280	Maybe this is all a ploy. Reverse psychology gets folks talking about the game.
3379560	3384040	Maybe they've already resigned themselves to the fact that, uh, this game's going to get modded,
3384040	3389080	but what an awfully nice reminder to all those PC users to a pre-order this game. So you can,
3389080	3396200	uh, get your boobies and your dongs day one. I wonder, this is just a thought.
3397000	3400040	And I'm trying to really think of how feasible it is because it would require the game to be
3400040	3406840	online all the time. If basically what you have in game are just blank models. And then when each
3406840	3413080	round starts, download texture, load it, you know, but then again, that would require everyone beyond
3413080	3417480	high speed. And I think that would really be the only way around it. And then all it would do is
3417480	3421960	just, you know, basically, uh, people would just change coding anyway. But, um, I, you know, try
3421960	3428040	to think of ways around that, you know, how to make everybody happy. Yeah. All right. Uh, let's
3428040	3433720	see. Go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Fifth dream in chat says dongs require
3433720	3438840	modeling. Nipples only require skins. Oh, now we're getting into the science of it.
3440760	3444760	Well, you should be able to do ass. You should be able to do ass at least, right? It's more
3444760	3448520	difficult to do. You know, they've already fly-cammed around dragon age to see if the men
3448520	3454200	have bits. They don't. They're all Barbie dolls and Ken dolls. But all the women have, you know,
3454200	3464680	fully complete boobs. So that's unfair. That's unfair. Some people need bulldog in their life.
3465800	3470360	That wouldn't be me by the way. Just say it. You just say it on behalf of those that need it.
3471080	3477960	All right. Moving on Loki. All right. So kind of a 180, you know, first, first they were striking
3477960	3486280	down videos that had, you know, modding stuff for them for Dying Light. Now Techland has said,
3486280	3490280	hey, you know what? We're going to be actually releasing official mod tools. And sorry,
3491080	3499640	you know, we didn't, we didn't mean to strike those down. So I don't know. It's just surprising.
3499640	3507560	Apparently they were intent to stop the be the zombie mode hacks or, or hacks in be the
3507560	3512200	zombie mode. And they accidentally, they said they accidentally blocked modders from being able to
3512200	3519400	tweak the game files. Okay. I'll take that. Whatever. That's fine. As long as they've,
3519400	3524040	you know, fixed the problem in the short amount of time. So good for them.
3524840	3529000	I haven't had a chance to check out this game yet. I've been hearing a lot of good things about it.
3529000	3533720	Yeah. I wasn't really on my radar, but. I've been hearing a lot of good things about it as well.
3534280	3539640	Just haven't, haven't really had a chance to pick it up. And I don't know if I will though,
3539640	3547720	cause I have still games I haven't played yet. So. All right. Well, moving on to some controversy
3547720	3552840	from earlier in the week, and this has to do with a league of legends tournament, a league of
3552840	3557320	legends tournament organizer in the Philippines. Cause remember legal legends is huge all over the
3557320	3562360	world. Uh, you know, being the free to play game, this game is huge, not just in the U S
3562360	3566040	but in a lot of Asian territories. So there's, there's tournaments all the time and all sorts
3566040	3570680	of places. So there was a league of legends tournament organizer in the Philippines. Uh,
3570680	3576440	and they were going to be doing an event call. It was an all feminine event called the iron
3576440	3580760	Solari, which, you know, you kind of look at that and you go, okay, you're trying to try to appeal
3580760	3585400	to get some more lady gamers out there. Try to divert diversify the league of legends
3585400	3590840	audience. This is a good thing, right? Well, if, uh, you go to the website for,
3590840	3596200	and I might be mispronouncing this Garina, uh, Philippines, and you look at the outlines there,
3596200	3604600	uh, there was a very interesting, uh, quote about their views on, um, certain types of women that
3604600	3611560	they wanted to limit as participating. And the quote goes like this quote for any events we do,
3611560	3616280	we always want to make sure we are able to have an inclusive environment where no one feels left
3616280	3621960	out. And of course, for everybody to enjoy on this angle, we believe that allowing more to be
3621960	3627160	eligible to join us is obviously the answer. And as many of our female teams have expressed
3627160	3631880	on the other hand, for any competitions, we seriously look at ensuring there's a fair level
3631880	3637480	playing field for all participants. And there are arguments and concerns from other participants
3637480	3644280	who dispute that lesbian, gay, transgendered women members may probably have some unfair
3644280	3650920	advantage. So what was written in the rules that there would be a maximum of one gay or
3650920	3657640	transgendered woman to participate on a team for a single day. So you can't swap somebody out for
3657640	3663880	someone else or what have you. And as you can imagine, Tumblr didn't take to this very well
3663880	3666920	as they shouldn't. And a lot of Twitter and a lot of people were like, what?
3666920	3669480	Intelligent person shouldn't take to that very well.
3669480	3675400	They're basically, unfortunately, when you say a comment like this, you're essentially saying
3676040	3682520	gay women and transgendered women are not women. That's, that's, that's the problem with what they
3682520	3686360	said. That's essentially what they said. Uh, and they, they, you may not say, well, that's not what
3686360	3689640	they said. That's, that's the message they sent across when they, when they said something like
3689640	3696120	that. And that is, that is wrong. And I would also like to know, how are they going to fucking
3696120	3701560	know? Like, will there, will there be an examination? Will there, will there be a gayity
3701560	3706680	test? Will they be taking the teams to Home Depot and see who knows what to do? I'm kidding. I'm
3706680	3712600	kidding. Don't, don't write your hate emails. But in all seriousness, like how the fuck were they
3712600	3716200	supposed to enforce something like this in the first place? And where the hell does a rule like
3716200	3719960	this come from anyway? Like they, you know, they validate those hundred dollar bills. They just
3719960	3724520	swipe it across and it changes colors. You know, that's how they know. They use litmus paper.
3726120	3732920	Oh, you have a pH of minus five. You're gay. Is that why secret is pH balanced for a woman?
3732920	3739000	I always wanted to know. Anyway, look, look, look, I'm joking. I'm joking. We're having
3739000	3745160	fun with this. Don't, don't get, don't get real mad, but are you the gay? But our point is here,
3745160	3751080	here's my question is that my understanding is one of the top Starcraft 2 players out there
3751720	3757320	is a transgendered woman. Am I correct in that? I'm almost positive. Maybe the chat room knows this,
3757320	3761240	but I believe there's like a top ranked Starcraft 2 player out there that I know I've seen.
3761240	3765720	And in reality, there's probably more than one, but there's one that's coming to mind that happens
3765720	3772760	to be a transgender female. Is this rule because of jealousy of said individual? Is that what this
3772760	3779800	is? Cause that's kind of what my reaction is to all this is, is that it's like jealousy or
3779800	3784200	something. I don't know. I don't know what the fuck this is. There are people out there who
3784200	3789800	judge others based on what genitalia they have. End of story. Those people are called bigots.
3790920	3798280	End of story. Yeah. Could it be, I have to throw this out there because this is another country
3798280	3806920	we're talking about. Could it be these cultural things coming into play that we're a little more
3806920	3811400	progressed here in the States? I mean, we still have a long way to go, but we're more progressed
3811400	3814440	here in the States with our viewpoints on some of these topics than maybe they are in the
3814440	3818120	Philippines. Just throwing it out there. I mean, maybe that's something that coming into play with
3818120	3825800	this as well. So anyhow, as you can imagine, the internet got real mad about this as they should
3825800	3831960	and Riot Games ended up sending out a tweet pretty quick, same day. And Riot Games, who makes
3831960	3837320	League of Legends, if you weren't aware, tweeted, LGBT players are welcome at official League of
3837320	3843560	Legends tourneys. We're working with our partners to ensure consistency with our values across all
3843560	3848920	regions. And so Riot Games was pretty much came down and said, oh, hell no, they're not going to
3848920	3854360	use our name with that kind of rule in a tournament basically. And sure enough, this got switched
3854360	3860120	around pretty darn fast. There was an update that came out where the restrictions were removed.
3860120	3865480	And there was a more full response, but you can imagine it was a lot of apologizing.
3865480	3872120	So there it is. Akuma JP in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, he replied,
3872120	3880680	woof, he is gay. Alan Alchemy in chat says, the cultural difference argument is kind of derailing
3880680	3885400	though, because even if it's true, it doesn't make it any less offensive. No, you're right.
3885400	3890280	And I don't mean to make it sound like it's an acceptable excuse. I'm just trying to sit here
3890280	3896520	and go, how on earth does a reasonable person think publishing that on the, as a rule was a
3896520	3902040	good idea? Like, how did they even think that this was something they could get away with? And you
3902040	3909320	know, I'm just like, is it a cultural thing? Well, and there's, there's a good, I hate to say it,
3909320	3913080	but there's a good example of what I mean when I say the cultural differences. You'd expect
3913080	3918840	something like this out of Russia, but FYI, it doesn't make it right there either. All right.
3920040	3924520	And Raginator says, I wouldn't say that we're more progressed. Westboro Baptist Church,
3924520	3929160	need I say more? What have they done lately? Well, I mean, have people just finally stopped
3929160	3932920	giving them attention? I think, I think, but here's the thing about the Westboro Baptist
3932920	3938120	Church is that for most people, again, though, the Westboro Baptist Church is the village idiot.
3938120	3942680	Like, we kind of look at them and we laugh at them and go, oh, those idiots. Look at,
3942680	3948440	they're so stupid. I mean, this is the price we pay for free speech is some people are going to
3948440	3954440	say some real stupid shit. Look at these guys. You know, I think it's to the point where nobody takes
3954440	3962200	those people seriously. Anybody that does is in the vast minority, vast minority. And they have
3962200	3966760	a right to say their thing, but we have a right to call them idiots because of it, which the Westboro
3966840	3971800	Baptist Church are, in fact, idiots. And for the record, the rule of free speech only
3972760	3979720	relates to speaking out against the government in approved social forums. It doesn't mean
3979720	3983960	freedom of consequence. That's right. Someone can point their finger at you and point how big of an
3983960	3990440	idiot you are and put it out on public news and people can, you know, pull contracts away from
3990440	3997160	you. What's his fuck name from Duck Dynasty, whoever that dumb shithead is. You know, people
3997160	4003320	can hold you accountable for what you say and freedom of speech doesn't have jack shit to do
4003320	4011080	with it. Yeah. So anyway, at least it does make me happy. Like on a personal note, obviously I
4011080	4015800	make it no secret on this program here that I happen to be a gay man who's, you know,
4016360	4021320	who loves video games just as much as you do and does the show and so forth. And I got to say,
4021320	4027880	though, like I can see the change from when I was in high school. Like high schoolers today,
4028440	4032280	it's so different than it was when I was in high school. Like not to be all like, get off my lawn
4032280	4038520	and all that. But I mean, this comes from a place of, I am happy to see that in society today,
4038520	4044920	Westboro Baptist Church are the idiots. They are mocked. They are the ones that any decent,
4044920	4049240	reasonable human being looks at that and goes, they're stupid. You know, where, you know,
4049240	4053960	20 years ago, it might not have been so much the majority. So I feel like as a society,
4053960	4059720	we have come a long way and I hope other parts of the world catch up real darn quick for the
4059720	4067480	sake of people like me in those other places. Anyhow. Ikuma JP says, OMG, Rob is gay? Get out.
4068840	4074520	No, it's my show. I'm staying right here. All right. Dark Soccer, what do you have for us on
4075320	4080760	hopefully a just better front? Well, I do have something. Game Developers Conference
4081480	4089400	will have the Indie Mega Booth Showcase. Woo. And this actually conference is on March 2nd through
4089400	4094760	6th at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, which we walked by many, many, many, many, many times
4094760	4103480	at GamerX, did we not? So there's going to be over 150 different indie game studios there.
4103480	4107960	We'll be showing off a few different ones. There's going to be 15 demos as well, too.
4109240	4112360	So I will go ahead and list those off. There's That Dragon Cancer
4114120	4120520	by Ryan Green and Josh Larson. Gemini by Echo Stone Games. I guess it's Machineers by
4121720	4129640	Lojica Apps. Megaton Rainfall by Pentadimensional Games. Pillar by Michael Arts. Inside My Radio by
4129640	4136920	Steven Studios. No Pineapple Left Behind by Subaltern Games. Push Me, Pull You by House House.
4136920	4141160	Okay, I just like a company called House House. House House. The Flock by-
4142440	4147640	Jamie and the House House. The Flock by Vogelslap, which just makes me think we need now
4147640	4156200	a little in-house studio called Vogslap. Vogslap, baby Vogslap. Simpsons, anyone?
4156600	4163160	Yeah. Legends of Ice Involved by Adderducks Entertainment. Mushroom 11 by Untame. Fate
4163160	4169800	Tectonics by Golden Gear. That's a cool name. Tenertia by Condescent Games. Throw Trucks with
4169800	4175400	Your Mind by- Okay, I want that game right now. Latwire wins GDC. Throw Trucks with Your Mind.
4176120	4180840	And then Extreme Exorcism by Golden Ruby Games. I don't know, that one sounds kind of rad.
4181400	4185880	It's not just exorcism, it's extreme exorcism. What if they put those two games together?
4186600	4193240	And it was like psychic ghost truck throwing exorcism tergeist. Lowkey, get on it.
4194280	4199000	Do the thing! There literally are no ideas that are too crazy for my game.
4200200	4205560	Now you'll just have to figure out how to do that. That's it. I'm gonna combine all of these games.
4206120	4213000	Well, at least a few of them. So we have Throw Dragons with Your Mind
4213000	4222760	from pineapples that are possessed. There's my game. In a place called Ice Involved. The end.
4223640	4226920	Did you say you're gonna just combine a bunch of video games together?
4226920	4228200	You know what that makes me think of.
4228200	4243320	Rob, do you know how people like you sometimes? What?
4243320	4247160	Special snowflakes. I do want to have a level like that,
4247160	4249800	but I don't know. That's gonna be kind of difficult to do.
4249800	4253240	I'm at the point where I like legitimately miss Katamari Damacy.
4253240	4254440	I do. Me too.
4254440	4258280	I don't know, but then I need them to just go back to their roots.
4258280	4259400	I miss Noby Noby Boy.
4259400	4264360	Just think though what they could do with Katamari now that you can handle so many more
4266040	4270920	particles and stuff on screen with the new consoles. They'd be awesome.
4270920	4273080	I just wondered, has Girl reached Earth yet?
4274760	4277960	Was I the only person constantly playing Noby Noby Boy on my phone?
4278760	4279560	Out of this crowd, yes.
4279560	4281480	I thought Girl was going away from...
4281480	4283880	No, Girl was supposed to be reaching Earth, I thought.
4283960	4286760	No, I thought she was going out further into the galaxy.
4286760	4288760	I don't know where Girl is. I'm gonna see where Girl is.
4288760	4290680	All right, you look her up. Let us know.
4290680	4292040	Girl, where are you?
4292040	4293080	Girl, where you at?
4294760	4296440	Did Loki really say that?
4297160	4298040	No use of it.
4300920	4308520	There actually is a thing called Noby Noby Stats, and Girl right now is at Uranus.
4314120	4317080	Good night, everybody. That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange
4317080	4319320	Lounge Radio. See you next week.
4319320	4320120	As of December.
4321560	4322760	All right, just kidding.
4322760	4323000	All right.
4327800	4330200	And there is your Noby Noby Boy update.
4330200	4330680	Thank you.
4332360	4336360	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and see what's coming to Uranus
4336360	4337000	real soon.
4338920	4339720	That's just wrong.
4340360	4341640	Loki, would you like to start?
4342520	4345000	Uh, I guess, if I must.
4345000	4346760	I honestly don't know what's coming out this week.
4346760	4348760	I don't think anything is, actually, now that I think of it.
4349800	4351800	Let's evolve around here or something.
4351800	4352680	I have no idea.
4353560	4354520	I'm gonna say nothing.
4356680	4357720	Nothing's coming out?
4357720	4358680	I'm just gonna say that.
4360200	4362520	Do you just make up the news now and just...
4363080	4364040	Uh, don't we all?
4366200	4367480	All right, well, let's travel.
4369640	4371480	Oh, you're right. Good point. Good point.
4371800	4373720	Let's travel over to Japan and check out-
4373720	4375400	I'll let you know later on if something's actually coming out.
4375400	4377800	Let's go to Japan and see how much longer girls are getting.
4377800	4380040	I said, um, I thought Evolved was coming out and Evolved-
4380040	4381960	I was gonna say, wasn't Evolved this week?
4381960	4382200	Okay.
4385640	4388120	Well, I mean, technically you buy the game,
4388120	4393160	but you're gonna be continually buying this game in DLC form over the next three months, right?
4393160	4393800	Pretty much.
4393800	4396440	So, I mean, yeah, that's kind of true.
4396440	4398280	No, actually, I did lie.
4398280	4400040	There are things coming out this week.
4400040	4403400	I should forget that Nintendo is releasing a new 3DS.
4403400	4404840	So, I mean, there's that, I guess.
4405720	4410440	But yes, the new 3DS will be coming out on Friday,
4410440	4413800	as well as some other games to go with that.
4413800	4418680	But Evolved, yeah, they have that coming out on PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.
4422360	4423240	What else we got here?
4423960	4427000	Majora's Mask on new 3DS?
4427000	4429320	Or, well, I guess that's actual just regular 3DS.
4430040	4431800	That's not a new 3DS-only game, is it?
4432760	4433320	No.
4433320	4433880	Can't be.
4433880	4436440	They don't have any new 3DS-only games right now,
4436440	4439000	which is another reason why would you buy a new 3DS.
4439000	4442600	Xenoblade in April, supposedly.
4442600	4443160	Supposedly?
4444680	4445240	Whatever.
4445240	4446280	Okay, I don't need that.
4448680	4449560	I think that's it.
4449560	4451960	It's just pretty much, um, oh, let's see here.
4452840	4456920	Yeah, that's, um, it's pretty much just Evolved in the new 3DS.
4456920	4459000	All right, much better when you don't make it up, Loogie.
4459000	4461000	All right, traveling to Japan and looking at what's coming out.
4461000	4462120	As far as you're aware.
4463800	4470280	In Japan this week, Sengoku Musou 4-2 in a regular and treasure box.
4470280	4472120	I don't know why it's 4-2.
4472120	4474360	I guess that's like Final Fantasy 13-2.
4474360	4476760	I hear you like sequels, so here's a sequel for your sequel.
4476760	4480760	I think that's got to be what this is, but Sengoku Musou is Dynasty Warriors, right?
4481560	4484680	So for whatever reason, number four is getting a sequel, so there it is.
4485320	4487960	That is coming out in Japan this week in regular and treasure box.
4487960	4489560	Maybe it's 42.
4489560	4491960	No, it's definitely 4-2.
4492840	4496760	Anyhow, Lords of the Fallen also coming out this week in Japan.
4496760	4497640	You can check that out.
4498360	4505320	Over on the Xbox One, nothing this week in Japan, which, you know, makes sense.
4505320	4510760	On the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan, that same Sengoku Musou 4-2 or whatever is out in Japan,
4510760	4516360	as well as a rewrite, and Dead or Alive 5 is right around the corner in Japan.
4516760	4518200	Not this week, but next week.
4519320	4524760	Looking at the Wii U, nothing in Japan for the Wii U until we get to Mario Party 10 in March.
4524760	4528600	So nothing this coming week, unless there's a digital release I'm not aware of yet.
4528600	4530680	But on the Vita, there's a lot more to look forward to.
4530680	4533320	You've got Sengoku Musou 4-2 is there as well.
4534120	4536680	Yukio no Uryoshi is there as well.
4536680	4542680	And Gaoken Heaven Boys Love Scramble is out as well on the PlayStation Vita.
4543400	4546520	Last but not least, on the Nintendo 3DS this week in Japan,
4548600	4555640	Nanatsu no Tazai Shinjutsu no Enzai comes out this week on the 3DS in Japan.
4556600	4560040	There's also some new cover plates making their way to Japan this week.
4560040	4565480	And The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask 3D on Valentine's Day for your loved ones.
4565480	4569000	I was going to say Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate 3DS will be coming out in the US.
4569000	4571240	And of course, we're not going to expect any of those faceplates
4571240	4572520	since we don't get any faceplates.
4572520	4575400	I should actually play that demo since I've got it now.
4576920	4581800	I don't know. It seems like if you're not really into it, the Monster Hunter series,
4581800	4582840	this one isn't going to win you over.
4582840	4584760	Well, check it out then. You might like it.
4586120	4590040	Well, we do have a few things.
4590040	4595080	On the 11th is Unmechanical Extended on PS4 and PS3.
4595080	4598440	And on the 13th, we have Lucius II The Prophecy,
4599240	4604280	and Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate, and The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask 3D.
4606040	4607800	All right, just a few more stories for you guys.
4607800	4609960	And then the classic game of the week.
4609960	4611160	But first, Loki.
4611160	4615640	Yes, unfortunately, don't have a good story for you.
4615640	4617720	But this is kind of sad.
4617720	4619800	I was kind of shocked when I heard about this.
4620360	4622120	I was coming out of work, actually.
4622120	4629080	And so Monty Oom, a guy who I always will remember
4629080	4635320	as the guy that was behind some of the really awesome machinima videos that they had.
4636280	4640600	Dead Fantasy was a series I loved from him, as well as Haloroid.
4641320	4644760	He did a really awesome fight sequences.
4646120	4652040	Also, of course, RWBY, which is a new series.
4653000	4656040	Yeah, and that's actually on Netflix now.
4656040	4658760	But unfortunately, Monty Oom passed away.
4660440	4663320	He passed away due to a severe allergic reaction
4663320	4666520	during a simple medical procedure that left him in a coma.
4666520	4668520	And unfortunately, he wasn't able to recover,
4668520	4669880	and he passed away in the hospital.
4670760	4671960	So it's unfortunate.
4671960	4674520	He also worked on Red vs. Blue.
4676280	4680520	And I don't know, just did a lot of good stuff for Rooster Teeth.
4680600	4683000	So he was only 33 years old.
4683000	4686120	On top of that, though, even a little bit more hitting home,
4686120	4691480	is he was actually pretty good at freestyle in DDR and Pump It Up.
4692520	4693640	I was not aware of that.
4693640	4695960	So yeah, I actually have some videos out there for that.
4697960	4698600	Unfortunate.
4698600	4701640	It's funny, I had actually dreamed about working with this guy
4701640	4705960	for my pitch for the new DDR game I had a while back.
4705960	4709720	But unfortunately, that'll never happen.
4709720	4711480	So that's it.
4713480	4716440	And it's so hard to hear about this type of stuff.
4716440	4717480	Especially, I mean, there was...
4717480	4718520	He's only 33.
4718520	4719720	Well, and he's only 33.
4719720	4720520	That's younger than me.
4721480	4724280	That's so, like, just stunning to hear that.
4724280	4726680	And especially if something that was, like, really, I mean,
4726680	4728920	just sounds like it was complications from...
4728920	4729800	An allergic reaction.
4729800	4731960	I mean, that's just like, what can you do about that?
4731960	4732920	That's so scary.
4733560	4738120	And then, I mean, this right on the heels of the news about Andrew Yoon last week.
4738120	4739400	So, I mean, this is just...
4739400	4741320	That's just tragedy left and right.
4741320	4745480	So, you know, our thoughts go out to the families
4745480	4748520	and those directly affected by the past things
4748520	4750120	that we've been feeling in the gaming industry
4750680	4751720	these past couple weeks.
4751720	4754440	But certainly, a lot of us are feeling a loss right now.
4754440	4757560	So our respects to these individuals.
4758840	4761960	Rama in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com points out
4761960	4764600	they're having a big RWBY, R-W-B-Y,
4764600	4768280	memorial photo shoot for Monty at Katsucon this weekend.
4768280	4769880	Well, that's kind of cool that they're going to have
4769880	4773320	these tributes showing up in these very appropriate places.
4773320	4776040	Well, here's the other thing that kind of, like, is pretty awesome.
4776040	4780200	As for honoring Monty, we do that in our own way.
4780200	4783880	In lieu of flowers or gifts, we ask that you simply do something creative.
4783880	4785960	Use your imagination to make the world a better place
4786600	4789560	in that way you can or in any way that you can.
4789560	4791480	So, pretty inspirational.
4791480	4794920	They have, like, a nice tribute video on roosterteeth.com.
4794920	4797960	And check it out, it's pretty awesome.
4797960	4799480	And that's just you and Hunter Matt pointing out
4799480	4801800	that I marathoned RWBY this week.
4801800	4804200	So a lot of people checking that out in tribute.
4805240	4807080	All right, well, the show must go on.
4807080	4809640	So I'm going to continue on to our next news story tonight.
4809640	4811720	So I'm going to go to a completely different direction here
4811720	4813640	and talk about something that's probably a follow-up
4813640	4815960	to something Loki had suggested earlier in the show
4816760	4819800	about gold and silver Mario amiibo.
4820360	4824680	And yep, gold and silver Mario amiibo look like this is a thing.
4825880	4829000	This is coming from a forum post
4829000	4831480	where these figures were dug up,
4831480	4834360	like the pictures were dug up on Nintendo's site.
4834360	4837320	All we know so far, though, is the box art.
4837320	4841080	Nintendo, of course, has not made any comment on these figures as of yet.
4841080	4843720	And of course, some people are wondering, are they a Photoshop?
4843720	4845960	I don't know. Maybe.
4845960	4849640	But I want to say somebody saw this on, like, an inventory sheet.
4850520	4852120	It's possible.
4852120	4856680	They do this type of thing with Disney infinity had crystal figures.
4857640	4859560	So they're like different versions.
4859560	4863800	They also have, you know, variants for Skylanders where they're more rare.
4864360	4866440	I would not doubt that they're doing this, of course.
4866440	4869000	Gives you an opportunity to sell Mario two or three more times.
4869960	4872520	Is this something now you suggested earlier in the show?
4872520	4876360	We were talking about Club Nintendo closing and what the successor could be.
4876360	4878360	You mentioned it'll involve amiibo.
4878360	4879160	Are we looking at it?
4880120	4880920	Possibly.
4880920	4884440	I don't know if this would be something that's exclusive to that, but maybe.
4885000	4887240	I would think that we'd see something maybe like this.
4887240	4891640	Variants or even exclusive characters through there.
4891640	4894920	You know, maybe some, like, more niche characters.
4894920	4895480	Oh, God.
4895480	4900360	Like, you're gonna get extra things that unlock if you have a gold one or a silver one?
4900360	4901000	Oh, God.
4901000	4903000	Or it'll just be a skin in the game.
4903000	4906120	It'll be just like your gold Mario in Smash Brothers now instead.
4906680	4908920	Does that mean I might get a pink gold peach amiibo?
4909160	4913960	Because apparently that's a character Mario Kart eight.
4913960	4914760	Maybe.
4914760	4916120	I guess anything's possible.
4916120	4919720	But there's a difference between silver Mario and metal Mario, right?
4919720	4920840	Or I guess.
4920840	4921480	I don't know.
4921480	4923560	I mean, it doesn't look like right there.
4923560	4926520	It just looks like they've pained one silver pain, one gold.
4926520	4927020	Yeah.
4927640	4930120	Kaijuto in chat over at live.vongnetwork.com says,
4930120	4933400	I'm gonna wear gold Mario amiibo to show off my bling bling.
4933400	4937400	Oh, is that I could wear it around my neck like an accessory.
4937400	4938360	Is that something I could do?
4939160	4939560	Okay.
4939560	4940600	Flava Flav.
4940600	4943240	Maybe that's a Dragon Con outfit in the making there.
4943240	4945400	I'm gonna dress up as an amiibo.
4947960	4948280	All right.
4948280	4949000	Nobody will get it.
4949000	4949400	That's fine.
4949400	4949960	That's cool.
4949960	4950360	I understand.
4950360	4952120	You have to have a stand with you.
4952760	4954360	A little black circle you can stand on.
4954360	4954680	Yeah.
4954680	4955000	Right.
4955000	4955240	Yeah.
4955240	4955960	A platform.
4956520	4956920	All right.
4956920	4961400	Anyhow, I'm sure plenty more to come as we get closer and closer to E3.
4961400	4965080	A lot of this will be trickling out or maybe even the next Nintendo Direct,
4965080	4965640	whatever that is.
4965640	4967560	They tend to have them about once a month, so we'll see.
4968120	4970840	Japan got a Nintendo Direct this week all about Xenoblade,
4970840	4972360	but we didn't get it for whatever reason.
4973320	4975080	Xenoblade's not coming out until April here.
4975080	4975880	I guess that's true.
4975880	4976760	I guess that's true.
4976760	4977000	All right.
4977000	4977800	Well, let's move on.
4977800	4979640	We're gonna go to a simpler time.
4979640	4983320	There was no amiibo or near field communication.
4983880	4988200	You unlock things in the game by hitting like up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right,
4988200	4988920	BA, start.
4988920	4989480	That was that.
4989480	4989960	It was a very...
4989960	4991640	You held buttons while you put in your quarters.
4991640	4992520	That's exactly right.
4992520	4993960	It was a more simpler time in gaming.
4993960	4996840	We're gonna visit that in a segment we call the classic game of the week.
4997560	5002760	Dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey,
5003480	5007240	you should play this game because like it's a classic and stuff.
5007240	5008680	It's a little sticky.
5008680	5012200	And sometimes it ties into the news as this week's title does.
5012200	5012760	Right, Dark soccer?
5012760	5013160	Yes, it does.
5013160	5016600	I was fully inspired by the news and I was also surprised I haven't done it before.
5016600	5018040	So what is the classic game of the week?
5018040	5019240	The game is Dead or Alive.
5020920	5024360	It came out in 1996 as a fighting game done by Tecmo.
5024360	5028680	And the first entry in the series by Team Ninja.
5028680	5035000	And it came out for the Sega Saturn and Sony Playstation in 1998.
5035000	5036760	The Saturn version was Japan only.
5038280	5044440	Yes, this is the game that gave us the very, very, very bouncing boobies.
5045400	5048760	That you could actually input like your age and everything and change it.
5049320	5054120	So yeah, the Dead or Alive had different choices of gameplay as well.
5054120	5056920	That really set it apart from the other 3D games at the time.
5057720	5062840	It really focused on speed and simple commands and reaction time.
5063400	5069720	So the countering system was very unique as well because it used different type of commands
5069720	5071800	to go with the type of counter you were going to do.
5072600	5074200	You also had different holds in there.
5074200	5078760	You had offensive hold and defensive hold, which you would either hold back or forward
5078760	5080840	depending on how you're going to do that.
5080840	5082680	So you'd either force them away or counter damage.
5083560	5087800	You also had these things called danger zones that were around the edges.
5089080	5096680	So that, for example, you could send a character flying by slamming them onto the danger zone
5096680	5098120	and they would bounce up.
5101400	5104360	To avoid that you would have to do a defensive roll called ukemi.
5106600	5109080	And the game also had this ongoing plot.
5109080	5110120	I mean, it's still going.
5110120	5115480	I just sat out for 3 hours one night about a month and a half ago reading the plot of
5115480	5117000	Dead or Alive, I swear.
5118200	5125240	So basically, it's just that you have different main characters.
5125240	5128360	There's Kasumi, Ayane.
5129560	5137240	You have the wrestler, Base Armstrong, Bayman, Genfuu, John Lee, Kasumi...
5137240	5138280	I said Kasumi.
5138280	5140920	Leifang Raidou, who is Ayane's dad.
5141800	5143000	Ryu Hayabusa from...
5145800	5146520	Ninja Gaiden.
5146520	5147160	Yes, thank you.
5147160	5147660	Brain.
5148520	5150360	You have Tina, who's a wrestler as well.
5150360	5152840	And Zack, who dresses up like a Teletubby in later games.
5155240	5162920	And basically Tomonobu Itagaki was saying that he just really did not like how fighting
5162920	5164520	games were designed at the time.
5164520	5167160	He missed the old arcade style play.
5167160	5170040	He wanted to take fighting games a different direction.
5170680	5175640	So since he had been there with Tecmo for a while, they're like, hey, go for it.
5176200	5177800	So this was the result.
5178680	5184200	The original game ran on Sega Model 2 arcade board, but the backgrounds were actually polygonal
5184200	5184700	models.
5185400	5192200	And the Saturn made use of bitmaps and parallax scrolling the same way that Retro Fighter
5192200	5192700	2 did.
5193500	5203020	So this was basically the first time Sega licensed their hardware to a third party company
5203020	5204220	for this arcade release.
5206380	5213740	And then, of course, we had the PlayStation version, which was the one that Bass and Ayane
5213740	5214240	were in.
5215260	5216940	And it had different music.
5216940	5222140	And this is the version that we got out in North America on March 31st, 1998.
5222140	5224300	Europe got it in July 1998.
5224300	5226620	I'm still giggling like a child over here.
5226620	5229180	I just haven't really watched this game be played in a long time.
5229180	5233100	I haven't really played a Dead or Alive game since it was first out on Xbox 360.
5233100	5234860	I never played the original.
5234860	5238940	It came out in a time, that kind of dark period where I wasn't really doing a lot of gaming.
5238940	5244540	And I'm looking at this just watching, again, Kasumi and the way her boobs bounce in this
5244540	5245900	little playthrough video we have here.
5245900	5249980	And it's so stupid and over the top.
5250060	5252700	Boobs don't move like that, but it's funny.
5252700	5256620	Well, there actually is a whole Tumblr called Boobs Don't Work That Way.
5257820	5261180	But usually it's more for just pointing out Rob Liefeld's bad art.
5262300	5267580	Another thing, Tecmo also put out Dead or Alive Plus Plus for arcades that was based
5267580	5274300	off the PlayStation version, had updated gameplay, and then it expanded a little bit more for
5274300	5275260	Dead or Alive 2.
5275500	5282460	It was listed in 2011 by Complex as the seventh best fighting game of all time.
5282460	5288780	And then it was remade as Dead or Alive Ultimate that revamped the Saturn version for Xbox,
5288780	5292620	along with the updated Dead or Alive 2 in the same packaging.
5292620	5298540	And so they just made the graphics smoother, changed the sound from stereo to surround,
5298540	5300940	and let you play with Xbox Live Online gaming.
5301820	5309260	Um, and so this was actually this and Dead or Alive 2 became the second fighting game
5309260	5310300	with online play.
5311580	5312220	And that's it.
5314140	5314700	All right.
5314700	5315740	Dead or Alive.
5315740	5317980	Don't have to be confused with that really gross horror movie.
5318860	5320700	Or, you know, You Spin Me Right Round.
5321900	5323100	Although that is a great song.
5323100	5323740	It is.
5323740	5325980	There's a really good mashup of that and Danny Minogue.
5326780	5327980	I think I've heard that before.
5327980	5328300	Yep.
5328300	5329020	Come to think of it.
5329020	5329260	All right.
5329260	5329660	There it is.
5329660	5331420	Your classic game of the week.
5331420	5338300	Dead or Alive, a game that admittedly I did not play enough of, I think, when I was younger.
5338300	5342060	So I'll have to go back and check that out on Jamie's request.
5342060	5343580	Do you have a system I can play it on, Jamie?
5344220	5346140	Uh, I think.
5346140	5347180	Yeah, somewhere.
5347740	5348700	You want to know what, though?
5350620	5357100	If any woman out there wants to imagine what it's like to be a character in Dead or Alive,
5357100	5358540	take off your bra and go for a jog.
5359100	5360780	Imagine that while you're just standing still.
5364780	5365660	I wouldn't recommend it.
5367980	5372460	Thank you, Tecmo, for unrealistic expectations.
5373340	5375820	Please don't make our don't mod our women nude.
5375820	5379180	Is this something you've tried at some point in your life, Dark Sakura?
5379980	5380540	You know what?
5380540	5383100	It's just you don't know.
5383900	5386780	I'm not even going to talk about it because you guys will never know
5387740	5389340	the pain that we go through.
5389340	5391260	Guys are wimps compared to girls.
5392620	5394460	Our insides attack us every month.
5396460	5401740	We have huge weights on the front of our upper bodies that make our backs hurt.
5402620	5405580	And on top of that, them bitches out there are making babies.
5405580	5406300	Try that once.
5407180	5407740	Can't do it.
5408540	5409180	All right.
5409180	5409580	All right.
5410220	5413420	We are going to, uh, we're going to stop there and take a break.
5413660	5417820	Uh, before we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio after a quick break.
5417820	5421500	And when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, uh, we will get into some rapid
5421500	5422380	fire news.
5422380	5427740	Uh, we'll get to the Fugu question of the week, uh, our emails, um, some news, uh, some
5427740	5432540	follow-up to some last week's news and, uh, somebody getting their just desserts.
5432540	5434380	And I like hearing about this type of stuff.
5434380	5437820	And maybe we'll get Dark Sakura to talk about boobies more.
5437820	5438300	We'll try.
5439340	5439820	I'm kidding.
5439820	5440300	I'm kidding.
5440300	5440540	All right.
5441180	5441420	What?
5441900	5443260	You guys have boobs too.
5443260	5444300	That is true.
5444300	5444540	Okay.
5444540	5445900	I can talk about boobs if you want.
5446940	5447740	All right.
5447740	5451900	We'll be back after a break with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5458460	5465340	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live here at vognetwork.com for this number
5465340	5470700	586 episode, February the 8th of 2015.
5471020	5475820	And, uh, we're going to start off part B here with our newest segment here on the show.
5475820	5478300	We call it the forum follow-up.
5482140	5489340	Uh, every week we post some extended discussions from topics on our show over at forums.vognetwork.com
5489340	5493500	and you can participate in these discussions and we follow up on some of the big discussions
5493500	5495260	from last week right now.
5495260	5499740	And, uh, I also kind of tried to guess what big things might come up this week.
5500380	5503500	Cause after all over on the forums, you can post about whatever you want.
5503500	5505500	You don't have to wait for me to post.
5505500	5509100	You can post something and then maybe it will get picked up here on the show.
5509660	5510540	So let's get to it.
5510540	5515900	A follow-up post on the Nintendo let's play revenue sharing, which for obvious reasons
5515900	5517260	was a hot topic last week.
5517260	5519420	I think we have an email coming up on it tonight as well.
5519980	5523660	There's obviously a lot of opinions on Nintendo's let's play and the revenue share program.
5523660	5528220	A rebel romance over on our forum said, I don't see Nintendo as a bad guy here.
5528220	5529340	Do they need the money?
5529420	5533660	Probably not, but if someone is making a profit off of something that they created, then I
5533660	5535340	feel royalty should be paid.
5535340	5539260	I think the music example is an excellent one, not just for licensing, but also for
5539260	5541100	BMI, ASCAP, et cetera.
5541100	5545740	These performance associations distribute royalties fairly when someone's work is played
5545740	5547740	or being played as it were.
5547740	5549900	Maybe gaming needs some neutral ground like that.
5549900	5551900	So everyone is protected and profiting.
5551900	5553820	I don't think the YouTube qualifies though.
5554460	5560140	And Act Deft on the same topic said, if something, a lot of the companies are making, let me
5560140	5561100	start over, sorry.
5561100	5564620	If something, a lot of the companies making strikes and copyright claims to people on
5564620	5570380	YouTube should follow Nintendo's example, work with the people, not against them.
5570380	5574220	Although following up to this was just kind of my own thought real quick.
5574940	5577420	It doesn't seem like Nintendo's solution is really working.
5578300	5580940	You know, A, it's too convoluted.
5580940	5586700	B, they're having these problems where it's taking people way too long to sign up for
5586700	5586940	them.
5587740	5590540	It's putting really crazy restrictions on people's channel.
5591420	5592940	Nintendo's solution doesn't work.
5593580	5597980	I still believe what I said last week, you know, not to rehash the whole debate, but
5597980	5600540	last week I said I believe Nintendo is owed a cut.
5600540	5606940	And I still do believe that, but this solution, particular one, isn't working for anybody
5606940	5609820	and should probably just be put out to pasture already.
5609820	5613180	But apparently it's really popular because nobody else can seem to sign up for it.
5613180	5618300	Maybe people are just excited because either A, they're like, hey, I didn't think to try
5618300	5620540	and get money before, so now I'm going to try and do it.
5620540	5624940	Or B, they just, I guess, want to sign up for Nintendo.
5624940	5629340	Maybe Nintendo is going to expose some of their partners and they'll have that official
5629340	5629820	tie in.
5629820	5630220	I don't know.
5631180	5636140	Anyhow, I knew the Legend of Zelda TV series and the Netflix thing, we talked about the
5636140	5636620	part of the show.
5636620	5637820	I knew that was going to be a huge topic.
5637820	5640220	So we had a post over on that on the forums as well.
5640220	5644460	We had some follow-ups from Tigerclaw who said, I'm curious on how are they going to
5644460	5647580	cast Link as a kid, a teen or adult?
5647580	5652060	I heard the TV show is being described as a family-friendly Game of Thrones.
5652060	5654700	By family-friendly, I would guess nobody dies.
5655500	5662860	Well, now Tigerclaw, Bambi's mother died, so they could still do something if they wanted
5662860	5663420	to.
5663420	5669100	Uh, but I, I, I just, you know, again, when they say it's going to be like Game of Thrones,
5669100	5672460	I think they just mean it's going to be a medieval fantasy and that's it.
5672460	5674780	I don't think you're going to see any, a lot of the other stuff.
5674780	5678140	And again, as I said earlier in the show, I don't necessarily think Link and Zelda are
5678140	5678780	even a given.
5679340	5680780	Why do they have to even be in it?
5680780	5684220	I mean, maybe Zelda could be in it because she is princess after all.
5684220	5689900	But I mean, I don't know, like I just, how would the series go on and on and on?
5689900	5690700	What would continue it?
5690700	5691100	I don't know.
5692060	5695500	I think there's a lot of things they could do with it, but it's just way too early.
5695500	5699180	We don't even know if Netflix really got cast green lit, who knows?
5700140	5703500	Flacco Jones says on the Legend of Zelda TV series,
5703500	5709340	while I don't for a second think this rumor is true, I'll answer for the sake of participating.
5709340	5711420	Netflix is throwing money around like crazy.
5711420	5713580	Nintendo would very much like more money.
5713580	5717820	So if it is happening, which it isn't by the way, it's because Nintendo is getting a lot
5717820	5720940	of money and likely has a lot of creative control as well.
5721020	5724060	As far as the quote, will this be good question?
5724060	5726060	You never know until you see the finished product.
5726620	5730540	I'm like halfway through there Flacco, because I get why you're totally saying this is full
5730540	5731420	of crap.
5731420	5735580	And I think people are jumping to conclusions for sure.
5735580	5738380	But I also think there's an element of where there's smoke, there's fire.
5738380	5741020	And there is the Wall Street Journal reporting on this.
5741020	5745420	I'm sure someone at Netflix has loose lips about, you know, what's happening so that
5745420	5748220	people will, you know, will hopefully invest in Netflix and so forth.
5748300	5754380	But again, all they could be shooting is a concept pilot to get Nintendo to sign off
5754380	5754860	on it.
5754860	5758220	I mean, we don't even know if that partnership's really been established yet.
5758220	5763340	So anything is possible or perhaps it's true.
5763340	5765900	And they're already run into series with this.
5765900	5766540	Who knows?
5766540	5767340	Who knows?
5767340	5771260	But I kind of doubt that I'm kind of with you Flacco that this is not as far along,
5771260	5773660	at least as people seem to think it is.
5773660	5777500	Anyway, those are some of the comments from our forums in the forum follow up.
5777500	5781420	Let's go around now with some rapid fire news and quickly talk about a few more topics
5781420	5781900	from the week.
5781900	5782780	Loki.
5782780	5783180	All right.
5783740	5791420	So anyways, this is kind of a relief in case you may be on the fence about buying Final
5791420	5794300	Fantasy Type-O Square Enix.
5794300	5797580	Apparently, I want to say they're going back on what they said originally.
5797580	5803580	Apparently, they're going to be releasing a Final Fantasy 15 demo alongside Type-O HD.
5803580	5808140	So you won't necessarily have to buy the game, I'm guessing.
5808140	5809580	I like that you call it Type-O.
5810220	5813180	I thought it was Type-0, but I kind of like Type-O.
5814060	5815500	It's Final Fantasy Type-O.
5815500	5817180	It's Final Fannery Type-O.
5818700	5820140	Or Dragon Quest Type-O.
5820140	5820620	There you go.
5821420	5822380	Final Fanta.
5822380	5823020	Great flavor.
5823580	5825420	Dagon Quest Type-O.
5827580	5832540	But if you want to play the demo first, then you'd want to buy the game because it's going
5832540	5840060	to be released with Type-0 first, but then it'll be coming out later on.
5841340	5842140	I don't know.
5842140	5842780	It's kind of nice.
5843980	5845820	I'm not sure if I'd like Type-0.
5846460	5848460	I'll buy it because it's Final Fantasy, though.
5848460	5851420	Yeah, I'm going to buy it just because it's Final Fantasy and I have a problem.
5853180	5855820	And I'm really looking forward to that demo, that's for sure.
5855820	5856380	Yeah.
5856380	5857100	So this is pretty cool.
5857100	5863980	There's a Kickstarter for a game called Drift Stage, which is this retro-styled drift racing
5863980	5872780	game, and it looks all neon and kind of 80s-looking stuff, almost like an old early polygon arcade
5872780	5873580	racing game.
5873580	5878460	Well, they finally hit their stretch goal for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita versions
5878460	5880300	of the game, which is awesome.
5880300	5885340	It's also going to come out on Windows, Mac, and Linux, but they're saying that...
5887820	5889340	That should be coming out next year.
5889340	5890460	So that's pretty awesome.
5890460	5891900	And the game looks really sweet.
5891900	5893580	And I guess their Kickstarter just ended.
5893580	5898540	I think they had like $50,000 of their $30,000 goal, so that's pretty cool.
5898540	5899040	Nice.
5900220	5908060	And then they're going to have Boku special editions for Mortal Kombat X, and including...
5908060	5911740	They've got everything from...
5911740	5913260	What's the most expensive one here?
5913260	5916300	Up to $179.99.
5916300	5922860	So for starting off with the cheapest one, $89.99, the Mortal Kombat X Premium Edition,
5922860	5928860	which will be available download only, includes the Kombat Pack and the game.
5929580	5931340	What the fuck is the Kombat Pack?
5932300	5933500	I have no idea.
5933500	5940220	Oh, four additional add-on playable characters from classic combatants to icon guest characters.
5941900	5945180	Are we going to see more like, you know, Jason Voorhees and stuff in this?
5945180	5946620	Because that was pretty awesome last time.
5946620	5948380	Those were some awesome crossovers.
5948380	5949580	Freddy Krueger.
5949580	5950460	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
5950460	5952060	So yeah, I'd love to see Jason or...
5954380	5957020	I keep wanting to say Bruce Campbell, but that's not the character's name.
5957020	5960220	You know, it's Ash from Evil Dead.
5960220	5961580	Yeah, it'd be awesome.
5962540	5968620	And then, of course, the next step up would be the Mortal Kombat X Limited Edition,
5968620	5975180	which includes, you know, an exclusive Scorpion skin designed and inspired by the Cold War,
5976060	5981340	I guess, and then the Kombat Pack, and that's coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,
5981340	5984380	which will be $94.99 for that one.
5984380	5987420	Then if you want to spend even more money and need a statue,
5987420	5990860	they're going to have the Mortal Kombat X Collector's Edition with a K,
5990860	5996060	because it's Mortal Kombat, and they've got an exclusive Scorpion figure,
5996780	6004460	and the skin, the Kombat Pack, and that'll be out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One for $149.99.
6004460	6009180	Then there's even one further beyond that that'll be exclusive to Amazon,
6009980	6015260	and I think for Europe, and that's also the Collector's Edition over there,
6015260	6019660	and they have the statue, the Mortal Kombat X Blood Ties comic book volume one,
6020380	6023660	skin, the Kombat Pack, and all the other fun stuff for $179.99.
6023660	6024620	That's just way too much.
6026300	6030140	Fifth Dream in chat talking about Mortal Kombat X over at live.vognetwork.com says,
6030140	6033340	Katniss Everdeen and Mortal Kombat X, you heard it here first.
6033340	6037020	I don't know, I think I realize those movies are kind of violent,
6037020	6039260	but I think Mortal Kombat X might be too violent.
6039980	6042140	They're still PG-13 films, are they not?
6042140	6044300	So it might not work.
6044300	6047260	What would be a good guest character for Mortal Kombat?
6050460	6051420	I don't know.
6051420	6052780	Mama from Mama's Family.
6056060	6057500	She just hit people with her purse.
6058540	6059040	Wow.
6059500	6061820	Didn't we do a list list on this once a long time ago?
6061820	6063100	We had to have, I don't know.
6063100	6063740	I know.
6063740	6065340	Flo from Mel's Diner.
6065340	6065740	All right.
6065740	6067340	She'd kiss them with her grits.
6067340	6068700	Anyway, let's move on.
6069340	6072060	Speaking of classic nostalgia, I think this is interesting.
6072060	6075820	Apparently a new Toejam and Earl game is actually in development.
6075820	6079500	Now, I don't, I'm a little confused at this because I thought we just had
6079500	6081820	really bad news about Sega last week.
6081820	6084380	So how could there be a new Toejam and Earl game unless,
6084380	6087420	I guess the license has been, you know, maybe to try and get some money back.
6087420	6089740	Maybe they let this license out to somebody else.
6089740	6090540	I don't know.
6090540	6095660	But, uh, yeah, apparently, uh, there's been some, uh, uh, content released
6095660	6099420	from the developers, some concept art, uh, for what this Toejam and Earl
6099420	6102540	might look like, but, uh, God, it's been so long since the original.
6102540	6103040	I don't know.
6103580	6104380	Could, could be interesting.
6104380	6104780	Could be interesting.
6104780	6105580	Would anyone care?
6106940	6109500	I think there'd be a lot of people checking it out for the curiosity factor.
6109500	6109980	Yeah.
6109980	6110780	Beyond that though.
6110780	6113260	I mean, I just, I don't know.
6113260	6114700	Well, if the, if the game is good.
6114700	6116860	Just don't fuck it up like you did Sonic.
6116860	6117260	Okay.
6117260	6118060	That's all I gotta say.
6118060	6120140	Just don't fuck it up like you did Sonic.
6120140	6123580	Uh, well, I don't, I don't think it's Sega doing it cause, uh, things are
6123580	6126060	changing over at Sega as we talked about last week.
6126060	6126380	All right.
6126380	6129100	And fifth dream in chat says the people who created it are still around.
6129100	6132140	So maybe it went back to the original developers and just be published by
6132140	6134140	somebody else who knows anyhow.
6134140	6139340	Um, speaking of, uh, publishing something old, new again, this is very interesting.
6139340	6144380	Um, if you are a Blizzard fan, you probably have a copy of Starcraft two
6144380	6147900	because you know, Blizzard or you love your Starcraft, but you know, Starcraft
6147900	6151020	kind of has its roots in the Warcraft universe.
6151020	6154380	Warcraft is obviously something very different now with World of Warcraft.
6154380	6158140	Although I think there's a lot of people hoping someday for a Warcraft four.
6158700	6162780	But what's very interesting is that now Warcraft three models are
6162780	6164860	available in Starcraft two.
6165500	6169500	And if you didn't know, Starcraft two has this huge arcade area where
6169500	6170940	people can make their own games.
6170940	6173820	And I know I've talked at length on the show before about some of the games I
6173820	6175100	enjoy in the Starcraft arcade.
6175100	6177260	Like star jeweled is my personal favorite.
6177260	6178700	It's bejeweled mix of Starcraft.
6178700	6179500	It's fun.
6179500	6184700	Um, but now you'll be able to make a games with Warcraft three characters
6184700	6186140	in the Starcraft arcade.
6186140	6192060	So I would think you could essentially remake Warcraft three or even fricking
6192060	6196540	defense of the ancients, which is the mod that brought us legal legends,
6196540	6198460	dota two heroes of the storm.
6198460	6201340	All of that is to thank from elite defense of the ancients.
6201980	6204380	You could see all that in Starcraft two's arcade now.
6204380	6206380	So that's a, it's going to be very interesting.
6207020	6208300	It's on the PTR now.
6208300	6209420	So enjoy that.
6211180	6213020	One more piece of news here.
6213020	6215980	I know some people very excited about music games.
6215980	6218620	Some people also very excited about persona.
6219180	6221820	Well, there was some new information released on persona this week.
6221820	6224380	There was a new trailer for persona five for one.
6224380	6227260	And I know that's got a lot of people excited, especially those that are super
6227260	6232380	into the persona games, uh, but also of particular interest, let's not forget
6232380	6235180	about the persona for dancing all night.
6235180	6235820	Thank you very much.
6235820	6238140	That's the music game that's coming out as well.
6238140	6241580	And you know, there's a lot of songs that are in this, of course, you know,
6241580	6242140	persona.
6242140	6245740	Remember if you played this game, even though it's like a JRPG, it has very
6245740	6248780	kind of like modern sounding music that makes up the soundtrack.
6248780	6252140	So some of that is in the game, but there's a lot of remixes
6252140	6253340	that are in the game.
6253340	6257660	Of particular note, there's a song called time to make history, which
6257660	6262540	will have the Akira Yamaoka remix in persona for dancing all night.
6263500	6266780	Also a heartbreak heartbreak from Tawatay.
6266780	6267900	You guys know him as Tawatay, right?
6267900	6269660	He was like a huge remixer years ago.
6269660	6270540	Probably still does.
6270540	6273740	He was a part of, um, group is in the heart.
6273740	6274240	D-Light.
6274860	6276380	Remember that with Lady Miss Kira.
6277420	6278540	Tawatay was a part of that group.
6278620	6281180	So he also has a remix in the game there, but Akira Yamaoka.
6282060	6282780	So there you go.
6283340	6285980	That means I have to have this game like forever, right?
6285980	6287900	It's like, if you weren't convinced now, now you are.
6288540	6289020	There it is.
6289660	6290300	Dark Sakura.
6290300	6291020	What do you have for us?
6291900	6292400	Stuff.
6293260	6296700	Well, uh, this is like, I guess the Kickstarter thing is just getting
6296700	6299020	bigger and bigger, but this one is really good.
6300060	6306620	There is a Kickstarter, uh, floating around to, uh, help, uh, basically get,
6306620	6311420	um, a new, uh, uh, DJ Max Technica out and about.
6312140	6317740	Um, they're wanting to put out, uh, something to the range of 30 to 40 units.
6317740	6320780	And so they are looking to the fan base.
6320780	6325420	So you can actually find a trailer for this called, uh, Touching Sounds.
6325420	6328780	So keep your eyes open for that or hanging out on Kickstarter.
6329740	6334700	And also, uh, something about, uh, Hironobu Sakaguchi who, you know,
6334700	6340380	created Final Fantasy, he's going to be getting a, uh, a lifetime, uh, sorry,
6340380	6343580	a game developer's choice award for lifetime achievement.
6343580	6347020	And I'd say very, very well deserved.
6348620	6353100	And last but not least, yay, happy news.
6353100	6353900	Yay.
6353900	6355180	Well, kind of yay.
6355180	6358700	Um, Leland, he can't, can't learn.
6358700	6359580	He really can't.
6361740	6363580	We all know all the shit he's done, right?
6364300	6367580	Well, they, uh, uh, revised-
6367580	6372540	In case people forgot, there was the whole, uh, he was a huge voice behind
6372540	6374460	the whole video games are too violent.
6374460	6379660	He led that campaign to try and make, uh, retailers have to-
6379660	6381020	God, I don't even remember all the details.
6381020	6382060	It was so long ago.
6382060	6388460	It was about, uh, you could, you could only sell games that had certain content in it.
6388460	6390380	You had to like ID people basically.
6390380	6395420	But the fact of what is adult content was so vague that there was a lot of problems
6395420	6398940	with it and it ended up going all the way to the Supreme court in California, spent
6398940	6404140	a lot of money, wasted it basically defending this law where, you know, parents need to
6404140	6407260	take the active role in what their kids are playing anyway.
6407260	6409020	So Leland, he was a huge part of this.
6409020	6411020	And then behind the story, he was trafficking guns.
6411660	6417100	Well, apart from that, they've, uh, the big indictment on this is that he was
6417100	6422620	allegedly depositing checks from criminal enterprises for secretary of state campaign
6422620	6425820	fund, which even more.
6426380	6430540	So he's pleaded non guilty, first of all, not guilty.
6431100	6435500	And, um, he is going to be going to federal trial on June 22nd.
6436300	6438540	Jury selection begins on June 1st.
6438540	6444860	A pretrial hearing is April 30th and, uh, he's being tried for 13 different counts.
6445500	6447260	So you know what?
6448060	6451100	I want him nailed, nailed.
6453100	6456540	He's going to be put away for a long, long time, I think.
6456540	6458940	Except he's going to buy his way out of jail and only serve a year.
6458940	6464780	Whereas there's rapists out there who, uh, you know, also only get a year, but you have
6464780	6468140	people who are smoking pot, who were in jail for 30 years, you know, just saying.
6469500	6470140	All right.
6470140	6471100	Justice America.
6471980	6475500	Well, let's do some justice to our listener feedback in a segment.
6475500	6477340	We call you like that transition in the same way.
6477340	6481420	We call the frugal question of the week, where we take Facebook and Google plus and put it
6481420	6482780	together and you get frugal.
6490300	6494860	We're going to hand on over to our communities where we ask a question every week and read
6494860	6497020	some of our favorite answers here on the show.
6497020	6499580	And this week has to do with modding.
6499580	6503500	After all, Dark Soccer read us that story earlier about the Dead or Alive 5.
6503500	6507100	And please, please don't mod this game on PC.
6507100	6512460	If you have bad moral choices, please, please don't do immoral things to our characters.
6512460	6513660	Yeah, right.
6513660	6517900	So we want to ask our listeners, look, have you ever used a controversial mod?
6517900	6522380	I don't just mean nudity, but you know, nudity, super cheating, something that altered the
6522380	6525980	game in a way that the creators probably didn't want you to do.
6526060	6527900	What was the mod and why?
6528700	6531500	Loki's laughing over there every fucking day, right?
6534300	6535260	Well, aren't you kidding?
6535260	6537820	Maybe, maybe the listeners know of some you haven't heard of yet.
6537820	6539900	So I bet you're excited to hear some of these answers, right?
6540780	6541500	Of course.
6541500	6541820	All right.
6541820	6546300	Let's start on Google plus tonight since I was horrible and neglected them a couple
6546300	6546700	of weeks ago.
6546700	6552540	I'll start on Google plus tonight with Josh Y who replied, well, I didn't really use a
6552540	6553100	mod.
6553100	6555500	I had some fun with action replay.
6555580	6557820	It's the UK equivalent to a game shark.
6557820	6559900	It was super powerful on the Amiga.
6559900	6562300	It even had a D compiler.
6562300	6563260	Oh yes.
6563260	6566300	Decompiling games is something I'm sure they don't want you to do.
6567900	6568940	I don't think they do.
6568940	6573580	I don't even mind the action replay did evolve and come out for other systems in the US.
6573580	6577580	Yeah, we did get it in the US, but it was how else did I play my Saturn games?
6577580	6578080	Yeah.
6578620	6579420	Uh, let's see.
6579980	6585420	Uh, I'm always afraid I'm saying this name wrong, but Martin D replied and said,
6585980	6589900	I tried the hot coffee mod for grand theft auto San Andreas, but it was just a silly
6589900	6590620	mini game.
6590620	6594140	And I doubt the creators didn't intend for that content to be found because the code
6594140	6596300	was in there in the first place.
6596300	6597740	People can mod whatever they want.
6597740	6598700	It's just a video game.
6598700	6600300	People OMG boobs.
6601100	6606220	And I imagine Martin is probably, I think if I remember right, he's one of our listeners
6606220	6607420	over in Belgium.
6607420	6610860	And if I am correct, what?
6610860	6612460	I think it's just Martin.
6612460	6613580	Is it Martin?
6613580	6614300	Okay.
6614300	6618780	He's, uh, over the, the double a throws me and I'm thinking, but I'm probably overthinking
6618780	6619100	it.
6619100	6622700	So anyway, uh, he's over in Belgium and my understanding is over there.
6623260	6626620	Boobies ain't no big deal is no big deal.
6626620	6627900	Is no big deal.
6627900	6628540	Right.
6628540	6628860	All right.
6629500	6634940	Anyhow, uh, entertainment replied and said, I used action replay game, shark game, genies
6634940	6639260	and other devices like that until the console manufacturers found a way to disable such
6639260	6640140	devices.
6640140	6644220	I've also used game save manipulation programs to give me a fuck ton of experience in MLB
6644780	6646620	2k 11 and final fantasy 13.
6646620	6651820	I had limited results with fantasy 13, but I had fabulous results with MLB 2k 11.
6651820	6655260	I was like playing with a baseball player who took steroids.
6655260	6657180	Well, that's cheating entertainment.
6657180	6657500	All right.
6659020	6661980	Let's get some of our answers over on Facebook.
6661980	6667900	Andy R says for a while I had mods for league of legends that only changed character skins.
6667900	6669980	The skins were only client side.
6669980	6672060	For example, I was the only one that saw them.
6672060	6677580	But given that Riot sells skins for the game, they ended up killing those mods in later
6677580	6678060	patches.
6678620	6681900	Yeah, selling you skins is part of how they keep the game free to play.
6681900	6685180	It's they probably don't like, even if it's only you, they probably don't like that you
6685180	6686300	were able to change that.
6686300	6687580	And it's, uh, it's interesting.
6688300	6693580	Uh, Alan Alchemy replied and said, I almost find this story beneath notice due to the
6693580	6694940	studio bringing it up.
6694940	6699660	Do they know what the stock swimsuits you can unlock in Dua volleyball party look like?
6699660	6703980	But anyway, yes, I've used nude and sex mods for both Dragon Age Origins and Skyrim, the
6703980	6708780	latter of which has mods for scalable dong size with real time flop physics for when
6708780	6710060	you run in the nude.
6710060	6710860	Wow.
6710860	6714140	Mostly I run these for the comedy factor and just to see how they look.
6714140	6716700	90% of them get uninstalled after messing with them.
6716700	6721420	The ones I keep are largely skimpy, sexed up, super impractical armors.
6721420	6725900	You know, like what the Dua women wear in the retail release for the dudes.
6725900	6730220	Because as a gay man and a PC owner, I feel I should be able to tailor my fantasy setting
6730220	6734140	as I see fit and a little male exploitation to balance the scales a bit.
6734140	6735740	Can't be a bad thing, right?
6735740	6737740	Well, whatever helps me sleep at night, I guess.
6740220	6743020	Dark soccer does male exploitation help you sleep at night?
6743020	6743420	Oh yeah.
6744460	6745980	Gives me some really good dreams there.
6745980	6748380	Do you think, do you think about it before you go to bed every night?
6749580	6754140	For the record, I have done exactly some of those same mods because it's absolutely ridiculous
6754140	6755420	to watch the dong cup.
6756140	6757980	Have you ever done a nude Garris?
6757980	6758380	Admit it.
6758380	6759980	Have you ever actually haven't.
6759980	6760620	Okay.
6760620	6768940	But you know, Turian skin did exist as a model for when they were developing mass effect.
6768940	6771340	It's just, they never actually implemented in the game.
6771340	6773420	But when they first did the character designs, they had
6774220	6777580	naked Turians just saying, just saying.
6777580	6778220	All right.
6778220	6781900	Jason C replied and said, I definitely use character skin mods in Skyrim.
6781900	6785580	Bethesda makes some of the ugliest character models around and it was really distracting
6785580	6787740	and hard to enjoy a game that looks so awful.
6788620	6792460	A surfing Slurpee replied and said the DOA producer should be more concerned with mods
6792460	6795820	that give unfair advantage in multiplayer, not cosmetic ones.
6795820	6798300	Modding the game to see boobies or dongs isn't immoral.
6798300	6800380	It's just for fun, not titillation.
6800380	6803980	I've only used mods in wow to supplement poor UI design.
6803980	6806860	The thing though with wow is that they really encourage it in wow.
6806860	6808620	That's why I kind of didn't name them in the post.
6808620	6812060	But I mean, I've used, I've certainly used mods in wow too.
6812060	6815100	And there have been things in wow that they didn't like.
6815900	6820300	Like there was one where you could like draw on the ground and they shut that one down.
6820300	6821500	Blizzard didn't like that.
6821500	6825420	So I guess, I guess even though wow embraces mods, there have been some naughty ones.
6826140	6830220	On a side note, says surfing Slurpee, who cares about DOA?
6830220	6833660	I've only briefly played a DOA title on a PS2.
6833660	6837660	Seems to me that Tecmo is trying to stir up some publicity for a stale franchise.
6838540	6842940	Save your money for Mortal Kombat X, uppercuts to the crotch for the win.
6844300	6847580	Ragenator says, I can't say that I've ever modded a game.
6847580	6849420	I have no real interest in doing so.
6850220	6853900	Ragenator, even after all the booby and dong talk tonight, no interest at all?
6853900	6854460	No, it's okay.
6854460	6857180	He wants the swollen balls mod.
6857180	6857900	You know what?
6857900	6861180	Outside of MMOs, I don't ever really do it either.
6861180	6865420	Like I'll look over, I'll look over my shoulder and I'll see Alan like with his dong mod in
6865420	6867180	Skyrim and I'll have a laugh and whatever.
6867260	6869180	But then I just go right back to whatever I was doing.
6869180	6871420	Like I don't, I don't really get too hardcore in that stuff.
6871420	6873500	You know, I modded the hell out of Mass Effect.
6873500	6874700	Well, yeah.
6874700	6877740	And now that I think about it, he, but I made Alan do it for me.
6877740	6881500	So Alan potted it, but he showed me the HD textures.
6881500	6882460	He showed me the HD textures.
6882460	6883660	And wasn't it worth it?
6883660	6884460	It was kind of worth it.
6884460	6885420	Have you ever fly cammed?
6886060	6886780	No, never done that.
6886780	6889100	Fly cam's pretty cool because you can find some interesting stuff.
6889100	6889600	I bet.
6890540	6891260	I bet.
6891260	6895340	Didn't you have some Tumblr posts of a fly cam thing that went like huge?
6895980	6896860	I did.
6896860	6903180	It was a picture on the refrigerator in the Normandy and Mass Effect 2 that has a picture
6903180	6908940	of, it has the, the circle with the slash on it on a Turian's head and guns.
6908940	6912700	So all I did was put a big catch on it that said no Turians, no guns.
6914380	6915260	900 posts.
6915900	6917420	Like the fuck Tumblr?
6917420	6918220	Tumblr is weird.
6918220	6919020	All right.
6919020	6923340	Well that one, and I had the other one that was this one's intimate apparel.
6924220	6926220	That was a Hanar sex shop.
6926220	6926780	I remember that one.
6926780	6928220	Yeah, the Hanar sex shop.
6928220	6929660	Only see it if you fly cam.
6931100	6933100	It's probably, there's probably a reason for that.
6933100	6936860	Anyway, Fifth Dream in chat says, first thing I do when I play, I'm sorry, not chat, uh,
6936860	6941980	on Facebook says, first thing I do when I play a Sims game is remove the sensor mosaic.
6941980	6943340	It's just super distracting.
6943340	6944620	Oh my God, me too.
6944620	6946300	I don't care if they look like Barbie dolls.
6946300	6947180	It's just so much better.
6948220	6950300	I want to watch my Sims taking a piss.
6950300	6950940	Just saying.
6950940	6953180	Ew, what kind of weird?
6953180	6953660	What?
6953660	6955500	Did you just say that on the radio?
6956860	6960620	I was being facetious.
6960620	6961100	Oh my God.
6961100	6963180	Travis Donovan is cutting that clip right now.
6966700	6967340	Sarcasm.
6967340	6967820	Hello?
6967820	6968380	I know.
6968380	6968780	I know.
6968780	6971580	But I actually do get rid of that just because it actually is distracting.
6972700	6974860	From watching them take their piss.
6974860	6978060	No, from watching them bathe or having woohoo.
6980940	6981900	Oh boy.
6981900	6985100	The mod for Sims 3 that turns woohoo into fuck.
6987100	6989100	It's on the little suggestion bar.
6989100	6990700	Let's just call it what it is.
6990700	6991500	All right.
6991500	6993180	It is a night here at Orange Lounge Radio.
6993180	6995820	There's something, I don't know, something in the storms.
6996380	6997580	It's parasitic balls.
6997580	7000780	Bringing, bringing in the funny or the strange.
7000780	7001020	All right.
7001020	7002620	Anyway, that's the food question of the week.
7002620	7008460	Facebook.com slash orange lounge radio or google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.
7010380	7014540	To register participation for this week's episode of orange on radio at vog network.com.
7014620	7016220	Use the passphrase wash.
7017180	7020540	Let's get into some more news before we get to some phone calls later on in the show.
7021100	7021500	Loki.
7022060	7026700	So we hear all these stories about people getting swatted and how it's terrible and stuff.
7026700	7029660	Well it's about time that we finally heard news that one of those
7030220	7037340	swatting one of the people behind this swatting has gotten arrested and that's the case in
7037740	7047900	I guess a online gamer who's known by the name Fame God who had swatted some people
7047900	7055980	in the past by making up murder scenarios and having the police go out to their homes
7055980	7059020	and stuff and of course not finding anybody.
7059740	7062140	I guess they had tracked him down.
7062540	7070860	He had used a computer to contact Naperville's 911 center back in July of last year and basically
7070860	7079580	said that there is a murder happening at a home in the city and so they sent there the
7079580	7084780	police out there and of course there was no one there and so they eventually tracked him
7084780	7094140	down to Vegas and they arrested him and took his computers and all that fun stuff.
7095820	7096940	Thank you.
7096940	7100460	Sometimes the justice system works.
7100460	7101420	Thank you.
7101420	7103580	Apparently I think they should spank him.
7103580	7105100	Make an example.
7105100	7109900	He's been charged two counts of computer tampering, one count of intimidation,
7109980	7116540	computer fraud, identity theft, disorderly conduct, and also was waiting extradition
7116540	7119740	to Illinois and faces up to five years in prison if convicted.
7121740	7124620	He's still probably going to get a longer sentence than rapist.
7125580	7129980	He's been a very, very naughty boy and he needs to go to the naughty step immediately.
7130700	7131420	Very naughty.
7133020	7137420	Your fascination with Supernanny is amazing.
7137980	7141260	Since I don't have kids, I just imagine it's like Supernanny.
7141260	7142220	Am I correct?
7142220	7145180	No, it's 100% more whiny.
7146940	7149100	Have you tried putting your children on the naughty step?
7149100	7150060	Oh, he doesn't care.
7152140	7153180	Timeouts don't work.
7154780	7159980	All right, let's see, so I'm really glad to hear one of those little turds got caught
7159980	7164380	and you know, if you do that kind of crap, you kind of have it coming.
7164380	7167100	So it's hard for me to feel sympathy for that guy.
7167820	7172540	Anyway, shifting gears here a little bit, talking about Sony Online Entertainment,
7172540	7176220	which essentially is gone as of this week.
7176220	7178220	Now, hold on, they didn't like close or anything.
7178220	7179660	They just transitioned a little bit.
7179660	7185260	That's because Columbus Nova, an investment management firm, actually bought Sony Online
7185260	7186220	Entertainment this week.
7186220	7189740	It is now Daybreak Game Company.
7189740	7193660	So Sony Online Entertainment or SOE is now Daybreak Game Company.
7193660	7201020	So this would affect games like PlanetSide 2, EverQuest Next, and Landmark, DC Universe
7201020	7201580	Online.
7201580	7204460	I mean, this is a lot of games that are impacted by this.
7204460	7210780	And already within moments, I mean, I'm looking at a post on the official PlanetSide 2 forums
7210780	7212620	over at station.sony.com.
7212620	7217900	And they even say on here, this means PlayStation, Xbox, mobile, and more.
7217900	7223420	Like, they don't even try to pretend that they're free of the restriction of only making
7223420	7225900	things for Sony and, assumably, PC.
7225900	7229900	So certainly, you're going to see things happen on Xbox and mobile.
7229900	7234300	Now, does this mean they're going to go back and port EverQuest to Xbox One?
7235420	7236940	Nah, probably not.
7236940	7240700	But you'll probably see a little more parity with the things that come out in the future.
7240700	7246060	And especially like, you know, maybe like EverQuest Landmark or some of the newer things,
7246060	7247740	maybe even DC Universe.
7247740	7252700	I mean, if it's not too hard for them to port over the PlayStation 4 versions of the Xbox
7252700	7253980	One, maybe that would come over.
7254700	7257340	But then again, now here's the problem.
7257340	7262220	Microsoft has that restriction where the servers have to be Microsoft-centric.
7262220	7266700	So is that going to work for every Daybreak Game Company game?
7266700	7267180	I don't know.
7267180	7269100	So it'll be interesting to see what develops in the future.
7269100	7272700	But I think mobile is definitely going to be a thing that's happening as well.
7272700	7274780	So they are saying business as usual for now.
7274780	7277100	It doesn't sound like there are any layoffs or things like that.
7277100	7281580	We're all keeping our fingers and toes crossed that the talent over there can keep on doing
7281580	7282460	right what they're doing.
7283500	7288380	And hopefully this will mean now that they can go more multi-platform, there'll be even
7288380	7290060	more subscribers to consume their games.
7290060	7290780	We'll see what happens.
7291580	7291900	All right.
7292940	7297900	Moving on, DarkSakura, you have a follow-up story for us of sorts, speaking of MMOs.
7297900	7298540	I do.
7298540	7303820	Well, you know, we talked about a lot of websites that had been shut down among them.
7303820	7306300	Joystiq, Massively, WoW Insider.
7306940	7312460	Well, WoW Insider is actually going to get an extended life as Blizzard Watch.
7313180	7318460	Although, I don't know, someone should have kerned their logo better.
7319580	7329420	So basically they generated $13,172.50 per month from 2,549 people.
7330300	7333580	And so they're now being relaunched as Blizzard Watch.
7334220	7337420	By the way, they have stressed that that logo is super temporary.
7337420	7337660	Good.
7339020	7342300	I think they actually had a post the other day trying to hire a graphic designer.
7344220	7345020	I should do it.
7345020	7346060	I should just do it for free.
7347100	7350060	Anyway, you can go to BlizzardWatch.com to find out a little bit more.
7350700	7353180	And I don't have time to do it.
7353180	7354860	No reason why you can't throw your hat in the ring.
7354860	7355580	Yeah.
7355580	7357500	I can just point out the bad kerning on that.
7358220	7364380	Also, now this is really interesting too, because we just talked about Kickstarter before.
7364380	7371500	But Massively is turning toward crowdfunding via Kickstarter to try to raise $50,000
7372380	7377260	to launch a new website called Massively Overpowered.
7378060	7382940	And on their Kickstarter project page, they're basically saying,
7383020	7387980	we like to keep doing what we were doing only better, not just because we love MMO blogging,
7387980	7392700	but because we know that our community and the greater MMO fandom is unique and worth serving.
7393260	7395100	And by the way, they've made it.
7395100	7396220	They've achieved that.
7396220	7398140	It was hit either earlier today or last night.
7398140	7400700	So it's still going though, isn't it?
7400700	7401340	It's still going.
7401340	7402540	25 days to go.
7402540	7406060	And their goal was $50,000 and they've made $52,000.
7406060	7408780	But of course, as a lot of Kickstarters do, they have stretch goals.
7408780	7414220	I want to say there was something for $75,000 about convention coverage.
7415420	7420060	If they can get into those different conventions, then they'll be covering those.
7420700	7423580	Their new website is MassivelyOP.com.
7424140	7425020	Very cool.
7425020	7425980	Go check it out.
7425980	7429180	Well, it's kind of funny because last week's show, not to say I told you so,
7429180	7433900	but I seem to remember distinctly saying, I guarantee you at least Wowsider is launching
7433900	7437100	a Patreon or a Kickstarter the minute they close on AOL.
7437100	7439180	Well, Wowsider actually did do it through Patreon.
7439180	7439580	They did.
7439580	7439820	Yeah.
7439820	7442220	So one did it through Patreon and one did it through Kickstarter.
7442220	7445500	And I said, if they're going to do it, strike while the iron's hot while people are,
7445500	7449580	you know, eulogizing the loss of WOW Insider and what it meant to them and so forth.
7449580	7450700	Strike while the iron's hot.
7450700	7455500	Hey, for a dollar a month, you know, you can still have this in your life.
7455500	7457820	And they convinced all these people to do it.
7457820	7458300	Good for them.
7458300	7458700	Good for them.
7458700	7460220	I mean, it's a good site.
7460860	7462140	I can't knock them whatsoever.
7462140	7464620	They do a good service for that Warcraft community.
7464620	7466220	And Massively does great work as well.
7466540	7470940	I've read their stuff a lot in doing Horde House, where we try to tap into all sorts
7470940	7471900	of online games.
7471900	7476620	I use Massively to try to keep a pulse and other sites too, but Massively a lot to try
7476620	7478780	to keep a pulse on all these other sites.
7479500	7483900	What's very interesting though, Jamie, I don't know if you noticed, but so you have
7483900	7485580	WOW Insider started their own thing.
7486380	7487980	Massively started their own thing.
7487980	7491340	I believe Unofficial Apple Web Blog also started their own thing.
7491340	7494220	I know that's kind of outside the scope of what we talk about here, but that was a blog
7494220	7495260	that was shut down too.
7496220	7500780	Joystiq, however, apparently is not going down this route, or at least we haven't seen
7500780	7501340	it yet.
7501340	7504220	But you have this odd thing going on and it's a little different.
7505740	7510300	Well, yeah, it looks like they retained maybe three people from Joystiq.
7510300	7516860	Some of the writers who now are writing pieces for Engadget, but it sounds from their little
7516860	7519180	initial, this is what it's all about.
7519180	7524380	They're kind of, I hate to be so crass, but it sounded a bit like a lowered expectations
7524380	7528620	post where they're saying, we're not going to cover all the press release news.
7528620	7531100	We're going to cover gamer lifestyle.
7531100	7533260	It makes sense because they can't with three people.
7533260	7535020	That's what I'm thinking it is.
7535020	7540780	I hate to be so crude for a site that I really have respected in the past, but it did sound
7540780	7542380	like it was a lowered expectations post.
7542380	7545260	Like you're just not going to get as much as you used to see.
7545260	7549500	And so we're going to cut out all the stuff that everybody copy paste on other websites
7549500	7551420	anyway, which I mean, makes sense.
7551420	7554140	I can't fault them for that idea at all.
7554460	7558380	But it should be noted that Joystiq Cross and Gadget is not Joystiq.
7559180	7566300	And also within hours, that Wow Insider Twitter was turned into this thing that said, Wow
7566300	7569420	Insider, now a part of Joystiq Cross and Gadget.
7569420	7572540	And there were a whole bunch of people that replied to them, basically giving them the
7572540	7573500	middle finger.
7573500	7577500	Like you fired the whole staff, fuck you, you know, type of thing.
7578460	7583820	And I have yet to see a peep on this Joystiq Cross and Gadget on what's, what's Wow
7583820	7585820	Insider, what's massively now.
7585820	7588620	My thought is they're just going to let it go.
7590220	7593580	They kind of have to, I think the community kind of sees through it.
7593580	7597980	You know, there's, if they try to do Wow Insider, it's, it's none of the same people.
7597980	7601900	It's just, it's just not going to, they're not going to retain any of those people that
7601900	7602620	were on that site.
7603340	7607020	It's like taking five new girls and calling them the Spice Girls.
7607020	7609340	It's not going to be the Spice Girls.
7609340	7611900	It's the Spice Girls in name only.
7611980	7612780	Or how about this?
7612780	7617180	Since everybody's talking by Saved by the Bell this week, which by the way, side rant,
7617180	7618380	what the fuck was cool?
7618380	7619500	No, no, I loved it.
7619500	7619980	I loved it.
7619980	7623420	But what the fuck was up with all these gaming blogs that were like, did you see the Saved
7623420	7624460	by the Bell thing on Fallon?
7624460	7625660	Like I saw it on Twitter.
7625660	7626300	It was clickbait.
7626300	7627500	They were writing articles on it.
7627500	7630220	I'm like, there's never even been a Saved by the Bell game.
7630780	7636060	And I mean, I saw the people that like games like this, like Saved by the Bell.
7636060	7638220	So that's why I'm going to put an article about it.
7638220	7644140	I just like, here is another great example of what we should be complaining about in
7644140	7645180	game journalism.
7645180	7648940	But there's all this bullshit fuckery hoo-ha going on somewhere else.
7648940	7649900	I'm just like, hello?
7649900	7650220	Hello?
7650220	7650940	It's right here.
7650940	7651900	It's like this.
7651900	7652780	This is not gaming.
7652780	7653900	What is this thing?
7653900	7654460	Yeah, exactly.
7654460	7656380	It's not journalism.
7656380	7658940	That's something you mentioned on your Twitter feed saying, hey, you know what?
7658940	7659660	That's pretty cool.
7659660	7660780	Hey, did you guys see that?
7660780	7661260	What is it?
7661260	7664220	It's a link to an article on Twitter on their Twitters.
7664220	7664860	Anyway.
7664860	7665500	Anyway, sorry.
7665500	7666060	Side rant.
7666060	7667260	To content they didn't even make.
7668220	7669260	Yeah, right.
7669260	7672540	So anyway, so what was I going to say?
7672540	7679020	Oh, I was going with an analogy of the new Saved by the Bell did not touch the old, all
7679020	7679180	right.
7679180	7680140	The trains left the station.
7680140	7680620	Forget it.
7682140	7682940	Let's move on.
7682940	7683980	Toot, toot, Rob.
7683980	7684620	Toot, toot.
7685580	7686060	All right.
7686940	7687980	Let's move on, Loki.
7688700	7689260	All right.
7690540	7698140	So there's this new sort of technology called gaze tracking that allows
7698140	7702700	you to use, I guess, they're saying like an infinite screen.
7702700	7709260	Basically, it tracks your eye movement and based on that, I guess, it allows you to,
7709260	7711740	I don't know, have more of an immersive experience.
7711740	7713900	They're calling it like an infinite screen.
7713900	7719500	So when the player looks to the left of the screen, I can measure where you're looking
7719500	7721500	and kind of rotate the camera, that type of thing.
7722300	7723580	I just don't see that working.
7723580	7724300	I mean, I don't know.
7725580	7726380	Cool, I guess.
7726380	7735020	But this reminds me so much of what they did with how they use the Kinect with like
7735020	7739660	Forza, where you would kind of turn your head to look to the side.
7739660	7743580	But the problem is, is when you turn your head, the monitor doesn't turn with you.
7743580	7745900	So it doesn't really work that way.
7747500	7751660	But anyways, apparently, though, you can, if you're interested in this technology,
7751660	7757980	they do have hardware that you could buy, including they have like they're saying some
7757980	7761420	development kits and stuff, 100 that go for $139.
7762140	7765500	I honestly think this would be kind of cool if it was something that was incorporated
7765500	7771260	into, say, something else like the Oculus or something like that, where it's kind of
7771260	7777420	tracking where you're looking and maybe utilizing that for UI or something like that for like
7777420	7781180	selecting things that might be kind of cool.
7781660	7783900	I just I don't know.
7784780	7789180	It's a neat concept, but I just don't know if it's going to be practical in the long
7789180	7789420	run.
7790220	7793180	Yeah, again, this is like any piece of technology.
7793180	7794540	I have to see the game.
7794540	7797020	I have to see the software that necessitates it.
7797020	7801900	And honestly, the problem with me, if I use this, is it's just going to be, you know,
7803100	7806780	OK, I glance at the boobs all of a sudden now, like my character spin around.
7806780	7808300	It's like I just I can't.
7809020	7813340	Am I going to get penalized for looking at the boobs or looking at the package?
7813340	7815420	Whatever your taste is going to be, it's going to be tough.
7816700	7819020	Is my video game going to out me as gay?
7822140	7825260	No, I just I have to see like what context this is used in.
7825260	7829340	I mean, like, you know, like Kinect, we've seen a few good uses of it, like, you know,
7829340	7834140	Dan Harmonix clearly has that thing mastered, but, you know, not even Microsoft ever really,
7834140	7836220	you know, truly mastered the Kinect.
7836220	7839260	Oculus Rift and, you know, Project Morpheus.
7839260	7842060	I'm a little more sold on, too, because I've kind of seen how those work.
7842060	7843980	But it seems a good game.
7843980	7847420	And that's the other thing, too, is like they're saying, you know, even when they're talking
7847420	7851740	about it, they're like, well, you know, you could still use your mouse to look around
7851740	7854620	and stuff, but it's really the next evolution.
7854620	7861180	Well, it's not really a problem, I think, from, you know, don't try to solve a problem
7861180	7862140	that's not there yet.
7862140	7862860	You know what I mean?
7863740	7869180	If it's good enough the way it is now, why do I need to invest $200 into something for
7869180	7873100	just like mouse looking, but instead I'm going to be using my eyes?
7873100	7878620	And, you know, I would have to really see this working because in the past, similar
7878620	7880220	technologies have not worked.
7880220	7883980	And I just, I don't know, that's a lot of money to invest.
7885100	7886140	But we'll see.
7887100	7887420	All right.
7887420	7893420	Well, moving on to a game that if it did have gaze tracking in it, would probably be asking
7893420	7895100	a lot, why do you keep looking at that nose?
7895660	7897340	That's a classic game.
7897340	7898140	Qbert.
7898140	7901660	I just talked about this earlier in the show, funny enough, because over at Rockage, I played
7901660	7902860	an old school Qbert machine.
7903740	7909820	And Qbert is going to be relaunched on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and Vita.
7909820	7910460	That's right.
7910460	7914540	Qbert rebooted, essentially, is coming to these different consoles.
7914540	7917100	This was run on the Sony blog earlier this week.
7917660	7921500	The complete original version of Qbert, of course, is included.
7922540	7927500	But as part of Qbert rebooted, you get the classic and then you get the modernized.
7928060	7930700	Qbert rebooted uses hexagons.
7930700	7933980	Ooh, now instead of the cube pattern, they've got hexagons.
7933980	7937740	They went the Civ 5 route to mix up the game.
7937740	7939100	I wonder if that's where they got the idea.
7939100	7940300	Let's turn squares into hexagons.
7940300	7945820	Anyway, so you can really change up the level designs now that you're using hexagons.
7945820	7950940	There's also time and score challenges, new enemies with new behaviors, new playable characters,
7951660	7952540	and so on and so on.
7952540	7954380	So that's pretty cool.
7954380	7957820	I did not catch a time when this is coming out, but I think it's really soon.
7957820	7958780	I think it's later this month.
7958780	7960380	It might even be as soon as this coming week.
7960380	7962860	But I really enjoy the classic Qbert game.
7963420	7964140	It's a lot of fun.
7964140	7966620	So I will certainly be checking this out.
7966620	7970060	That will be available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and Vita.
7970700	7973100	To go back to what we were talking about just a second ago.
7974060	7978460	They brought a Dungeon Buster brought up in chat.
7978460	7981020	Would you like to see your Kinect eye tracking stats for the week?
7981020	7986060	That reminds me, like if this was something that was implemented full scale, then can
7986060	7989980	you imagine like, oh, hey, yeah, we could totally see what the ad impression is.
7989980	7991820	How long were they staring at the ad?
7991820	7992700	Oh, God.
7992700	7995420	How long were they staring at the product or whatever that's on the screen?
7995420	7999660	Imagine all that metadata that would be really helpful.
7999660	8005260	So I could see something like this integrated into some consumer products because that's
8005260	8009420	good information for advertisers that they can sell and make money off of.
8011980	8015580	Raginator in chat pointing out that Qbert Reloaded is already on Steam.
8015580	8016540	I bought it a while back.
8016540	8017820	Well, shit, I was unaware.
8017820	8018860	I might have to check that out.
8018860	8019580	Although, I don't know.
8019580	8021900	I'll wait for it on PlayStation, maybe.
8021900	8023820	Fifth Dream says Qbert is out on the 10th.
8023820	8024860	So that would be this coming week.
8024860	8025580	Well, that's pretty cool.
8026220	8027020	So I will check that out.
8027020	8031260	Maybe I'll just wait a few more days then and buy that on the PlayStation.
8031260	8034060	It does seem like a game I want to play with the controller.
8034060	8034560	I don't know.
8035100	8037660	I guess I could always plug the controller into my PC, right?
8037660	8038140	But I don't know.
8038140	8041180	It's some games are couch games.
8041180	8041660	I could.
8041660	8043740	Yeah, there's probably a working Qbert on there in there.
8044780	8048380	But it probably doesn't make that same thud sound when Qbert hits the bottom.
8048380	8048880	Who knows?
8049580	8049980	All right.
8049980	8051820	Anyhow, let's go to the mailbag.
8051820	8057180	Every week, you guys send us emails over at participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8057740	8063740	And DarkSakura dives into the mailbag and finds a few emails worthy of reading for you here on the show.
8063740	8066460	So DarkSakura, what is awaiting us in the mailbag tonight?
8067260	8067820	Two letters.
8068620	8069580	Two letters?
8069580	8071020	I will go ahead and start with one.
8071020	8071520	Okay.
8072620	8074540	First one is HelloLR.
8075580	8077020	Caught up on podcast this week.
8077020	8080700	I apologize for the length of this email in advance, but trust me, it's all meat and no fat.
8080700	8082940	Well, we don't want that because fat makes it juicy.
8083820	8084320	No, I'm kidding.
8085020	8089980	When you were discussing Rock Edge, it occurred to me that I need to say something.
8089980	8091260	You all need to go to MAGFest.
8092220	8095100	Like, not you ought to go or you should think about it.
8095100	8096220	You really need to go.
8096220	8099660	To describe the feeling you'll get when you walk in there is impossible.
8099660	8103260	There are more video games in one room than you will ever see anywhere else in your lifetime,
8103260	8105180	except possibly at a future MAGFest.
8105900	8108780	Lots of consoles are there, including most you cannot think of.
8108780	8110460	Even obscure ones went like my house.
8111500	8114140	Plus over 200 arcade games on free play.
8114140	8117900	Plus all the stuff we grew up with to the latest bit money straight from Japan.
8117900	8120940	That actually sounds like California Extreme.
8122380	8124540	Plus pinball machines, California Extreme.
8124540	8126700	Plus board and card game, California Extreme.
8127340	8130460	Plus a dedicated area with dozens of indie developers.
8130460	8135260	Plus the infamous challenge booth where you attempt sick feats on classic emulated games.
8135260	8136060	Plus concerts.
8136060	8137900	Okay, so yeah, that's where they...
8137900	8142380	Yeah, the concerts is a really huge thing that distinguishes it from California Extreme.
8142380	8143420	Lots of concerts.
8143420	8145020	Based on what I saw at Rockage.
8145020	8150540	Hell, the last couple of years have even featured Nobuyomatsu and Yuzo Koshiro concerts.
8151180	8154060	This even sounds like slightly awesome...
8154060	8155740	No, if this even sounds slightly awesome to you,
8155740	8157500	you should try to make it there next January.
8157500	8158860	Please trust me on this.
8158860	8159580	I would like to.
8160460	8160960	It just...
8161580	8162080	Yeah.
8162540	8163740	Time, money, etc.
8165180	8167180	I am giving it way more serious thought now.
8167180	8174860	As I mentioned earlier in the show, thanks to Rockage and just kind of having some thinking
8174860	8179420	over the past few weeks about where should my priorities really lie and what conventions I go to.
8180460	8184220	I really think some of the conventions that I used to consider kind of a big deal,
8184220	8186540	I think are kind of losing their relevancy.
8187260	8189500	And maybe I'll get into this more on a future show,
8189500	8193900	but I kind of believe that E3 is becoming less and less relevant, as I think a lot of you are.
8193900	8194400	Yep.
8194400	8197760	Especially as companies like Nintendo take their case directly to consumers.
8199120	8206080	So I think these other homegrown shows that really celebrate gaming and what it's all about,
8206080	8208160	that haven't sold out like some other ones have,
8208880	8213120	I think these other homegrown things like Magfest, like Rockage, like GX,
8214160	8217040	there's tons of them everywhere every weekend.
8217040	8219760	I think this is really the types of stuff I want to be going to.
8219760	8222160	Things where we celebrate and love and appreciate gaming.
8222160	8227440	A follow up to my previous email regarding Nintendo's evil pay to play crane game,
8227440	8230640	where you can win badges and icons to customize your 3DS home menu,
8230640	8233040	it's a little bit less evil than originally reported.
8233040	8235600	If you buy five plays for 90 yen and don't win anything,
8235600	8240320	you'll receive a free badges consolation prize that might not be the one you were playing for.
8240320	8244720	Also, there is a special crane machine that you can get five plays on for free once a day.
8244720	8248080	This machine allows you to win fake badges, but don't do anything for you,
8248080	8251360	but the ones you win are flipped over.
8252000	8256320	That if you find a red dot on the back, you win three free plays on the next real machine.
8256880	8260480	This has only happened once out of the 30 or so fake badges I've won,
8260480	8264080	but for every 10 you win, you get one free play on the real machine regardless.
8264080	8268320	So it is in theory possible to win a lot of the items without paying any money.
8268320	8270160	It just may take a very long time.
8270160	8272960	Lastly, if you pay 180 yen in one day for 10 players,
8272960	8277200	you will see at no extra charge an exclusive premium theme of your choice.
8277200	8279680	This is all about the price they sell the themes for anyway,
8279680	8281520	so it's arguably a good value.
8281520	8285440	All in all, it's still very evil, but perhaps only 66.6% evil.
8288880	8292080	Shane was telling me about that crane game because you know he imported that new 3DS.
8292080	8294640	So he was he was over here the other day and he was playing it.
8294640	8295520	I was like, what the hell are you playing?
8295520	8296320	He's like, oh, it's the crane.
8296320	8299040	And I was like, oh, I've heard about this on the alarm desk.
8299040	8300160	This is cute.
8300160	8301440	Yeah, they get cute boxes.
8301440	8301920	Not fair.
8303200	8305520	When shocking moments were being discussed,
8305520	8308960	I'm a little surprised that nobody brought up the release announcement of Duke Nukem Forever.
8308960	8311040	When non-traditional sports games were mentioned,
8311040	8314560	it's a little I'm a little surprised that nobody suggested Super Dodgeball.
8316240	8317360	Dan would have suggested that.
8318080	8322640	I think Twitch is the most likely candidate to offer an alternative to YouTube to host
8322640	8323760	Let's Play videos.
8323760	8326160	They also think they're sharply focused on what they do best
8326160	8328880	and will likely not expand into doing other things.
8329760	8331280	That said, I hope I'm wrong.
8331280	8334800	YouTube needs a good splits kick punch in the vajayjay.
8334800	8338880	The Sony class action settlement was mentioned.
8338880	8342640	If you are participating, read the instructions and fine print carefully.
8342640	8346560	You can only select to be the three or six months of PlayStation Plus benefit
8346560	8348320	if you are not a current subscriber.
8348320	8349520	That's what I thought.
8349520	8354080	If you select that option and you are a current subscriber, you will forfeit your benefit.
8354080	8357200	Oh, I already have all the other games on there anyway.
8359200	8362400	A listener mentioned on a frugal question that they've never been to a convention,
8362400	8367040	but that they were looking forward to too many games in the Philadelphia area this year.
8367040	8370400	Well, I've been there demoing my latest projects for the past four years
8370400	8372880	and I'll be there again this year, too, so I hope to see you there.
8372880	8375360	Mention OLR and you'll get free hugs at the very least.
8377600	8381360	By the way, Philadelphia area, I think also is DerpyCon.
8382400	8387120	I think they're going to be doing a second one, but I did their flyer for them, their book.
8387680	8394400	So, lastly, I want to mention that Orange Lounge Radio is the most legitimate podcast
8394400	8395360	on the internet.
8395360	8398480	In fact, it is 120% legitimate on every day of the week.
8399120	8403040	And if for any reasons one of my future game releases ever gets popular,
8403040	8406800	a large amount of people ever care about what I have to say,
8406800	8410480	I will still make my project announcements on OLR before I make them anywhere else.
8410480	8410800	Why?
8410800	8412240	Because that's my FU of the week.
8412240	8413520	Every week, that's why.
8413520	8415200	Hugs and kisses, Erin Yyr.
8415520	8417440	That really means a lot.
8417440	8418160	Thank you.
8418160	8418640	Really true.
8418640	8419760	Like, this week especially.
8419760	8420640	Hearts.
8420640	8421360	That means an awful lot.
8421360	8423600	Sorry for all the pictures of swollen balls in the chat room.
8425600	8426640	I will explain that later.
8428320	8431760	Okay, I have to actually stop because I have to tell you what my obsession with the swollen balls
8431760	8432260	are now.
8432960	8434160	Do we really need to go there?
8434160	8435360	Because I'm not sure we need to go there.
8435360	8436400	Let's go there.
8436400	8436900	No!
8437680	8440480	It's actually giving a plug to one of my favorite YouTube channels.
8441040	8442640	So, it's Rachel and June.
8443680	8451360	A cute redhead girl that met her now Japanese husband while she was a student over there,
8451360	8453280	was separated from for a little while and then moved back.
8453280	8458880	So, she actually goes into depth about what it's like being a foreigner in Japan
8458880	8461120	and being married into a Japanese family and whatnot.
8461120	8465280	So, she did one about the Tokyo Parasite Museum.
8465280	8466400	Hence, swollen balls.
8467920	8468640	You nasty.
8469200	8470400	So, it's interesting.
8470400	8471760	Is science Rob Science?
8472560	8473680	What were you gonna say?
8473680	8474180	Science.
8475840	8476240	Thank you.
8476240	8477440	Fifth dream in chat.
8477440	8478320	Swollen balls.
8478320	8479680	Is this Hoard House?
8479680	8480320	Thank you.
8480320	8482080	I already have to put up with this one night a week.
8482080	8483120	I don't need two.
8483120	8484880	I'm gonna have a talk with grandpa.
8484880	8485840	You and grandpa.
8486400	8488640	You and grandpa should do a dirty girls show.
8488640	8489520	That's what you should do.
8489520	8490400	Just dirty girls.
8490400	8492240	That's what I get for living in his house.
8492240	8492960	Maybe, what?
8492960	8494640	Are you gonna get Patty involved in that too?
8494640	8496800	Yeah, me, Patty, and grandpa.
8496800	8497600	Oh, Jesus.
8498640	8500000	Vogue After Dark.
8500000	8500480	That's it.
8500480	8501360	That's what we're gonna call it.
8501360	8502240	Vogue After Dark.
8504880	8505920	Okay, last email.
8506480	8507360	Hey, OLR.
8507360	8508880	Great show this past episode.
8508880	8511680	I appreciate that you guys tackle some difficult topics
8511680	8512960	and aren't afraid to dig in.
8513600	8514400	I'm not gonna say it.
8515040	8518240	Usually, I just enjoy as a passive listener,
8518240	8520080	but this time I felt a little heat rise
8520080	8522480	and wanted to let off a little steam of my own.
8524000	8526560	Regarding the discussion on YouTube copyright violations
8526640	8527760	of games slash music,
8527760	8530960	I can't comprehend anything but an unrestricted fair use system.
8531520	8533280	Now, I say fair use,
8533280	8537440	which exempts those who simply play artists songs or play movies.
8537440	8539280	It's clearly a different matter altogether,
8539280	8541920	but streaming a game play through with the song in the background,
8542800	8544240	background, sorry, that's fair use.
8544880	8548240	It's really a win-win for both consumers and content creators.
8548240	8551120	Playing the games and music are a great way to promote the content.
8551120	8552800	People watch and listen and then buy,
8552800	8554800	which I actually will say I've done.
8554800	8558240	I even got introduced to one of my favorite bands now Boy and Bear
8558240	8561520	when they were still really, really new in Australia
8561520	8564480	because one of their songs played in the background of a commercial.
8564480	8568080	I popped out my Shazam and I tagged the song because I wanted it
8568720	8570000	and now they're kind of big.
8570000	8571120	I feel like such a hipster.
8574640	8578080	I can't imagine hearing a background song on someone's homemade video
8578080	8580800	or watching a game or play a game and then say to myself,
8580800	8583760	I'm good, I don't need to buy that game or that CD.
8583760	8586160	At worst, I decide it's a game I don't want to play
8586160	8587600	or a song I don't need to hear again.
8587600	8590080	At best, I go out and buy the game or the album.
8590080	8592320	That's a win-win for me and for the creator.
8593040	8595840	Charging fees for streaming these things and most,
8595840	8599600	no, charge fees for streaming these things and most YouTubers
8599600	8603440	won't or can't pay it, won't stream it, and we won't see and hear it.
8603440	8608000	No promotion, no awareness, no purchase, lose-lose for both customers and content creators.
8609120	8611360	I really can't believe it's even an issue.
8611360	8617520	Content creators would be crazy to do anything to disable promotional avenues.
8617520	8619120	Promotion is everything.
8619120	8622800	Having people stream your gaming music for free, you can't do it better.
8622800	8626480	I must be near-sighted here because I can't even understand the other side of this argument.
8626480	8627680	Love the OLR, narc.
8628320	8632560	And I will say this, a lot of these decisions come from,
8634320	8637920	I'm going to say the upper level corporate side of things
8637920	8641600	where they're not actually as in touch with reality
8641600	8643600	as the people who are on the ground level.
8643600	8644720	And that's all I'm going to say on that.
8645520	8649680	Nintendo's system is flawed, you know, and anything I was talking about last week,
8649680	8652480	you know, I totally agree.
8652480	8655840	The system that Nintendo came up with only makes Nintendo the winner
8655840	8657520	as well as all these other people to get a cut.
8657520	8659280	The system is flawed and needs to be fixed.
8659280	8661840	And I believe YouTube is the one that needs to fix it.
8661840	8667680	However, I respectfully disagree with you that, you know, you can't,
8668640	8673840	the Let's Play simply would not exist without the game, period.
8673840	8678800	You're saying in your email that you wouldn't come or you wouldn't see the game
8678800	8680720	if it wasn't for the Let's Player.
8680720	8682880	I'm saying the reverse is true too.
8682880	8685920	And I think that's where you do have the blinders there is that
8685920	8688480	how did you find the Let's Player in the first place?
8688480	8689920	By looking for the game.
8690480	8693040	The game creates that content.
8693040	8695760	I mean, and this is, this happens in music.
8695760	8698080	This happens in movies.
8698080	8699120	But that can go either way.
8699120	8701920	Just like, for example, like I find out of a game sometimes,
8701920	8704640	like I like watching Total Biscuits videos.
8704640	8707840	And I found out like about a game called Tower of Guns,
8707840	8709520	not by looking for Tower of Guns.
8709520	8712800	I watched his channel and I saw that game.
8712800	8713760	And so I was exposed to it.
8713760	8714880	So it goes both ways.
8715680	8717520	And I actually agree with that.
8717520	8720400	And that's why I don't think Nintendo deserves a hundred percent.
8720400	8721760	I don't think they do.
8721760	8725360	And I think if Nintendo wants to give away,
8725360	8728960	essentially say, we're going to give away our game for free
8728960	8732640	for you to stream, then go ahead and do so.
8733440	8735360	And that would encourage more people to do it.
8735360	8736800	If they wanted to do that, they could.
8736800	8739120	And it would, in fact, encourage more people to do it.
8739120	8740480	But they don't have to do it.
8740480	8744480	Just like there's people that put music out there in the public domain saying,
8744480	8746640	here, please use my music.
8747280	8748080	Just give me a credit.
8748080	8748800	That's all I want.
8748800	8750240	Please just help me get my music out there.
8750960	8751520	It's fine.
8752320	8757360	Um, I just, I don't think Nintendo is obligated to let you use it for free.
8757360	8760960	But I also understand that, well, it's not like people are going to sit here
8760960	8763360	and try to license something from Nintendo.
8763920	8767040	No, but YouTube is ultimately the one that's making the money off
8767040	8768800	both people in that situation.
8768800	8774160	I think it is up to YouTube to come up with the system that is fair for both parties.
8774160	8777440	And if a gaming company wants to give up their portion of it
8777440	8780720	to encourage more people to do the Let's Plays, then so be it.
8780720	8782400	And maybe a lot of game companies will do it,
8782400	8784320	because it would probably be the smart thing to do
8784320	8786160	for a lot of those reasons you just named.
8786160	8788320	But I don't think a gaming company has to do it.
8789280	8793520	So that's, again, I don't want to re-dredge up the whole debate,
8793520	8797360	but those are just my thought out responses to your email.
8797360	8802000	So just try really, really hard to look at it the other way around.
8802000	8805120	I'm not saying you necessarily have to have the corporate mentality,
8805120	8809440	but just, you know, consider that Nintendo did make the game
8809440	8811120	that this person is wanting to stream.
8811120	8813120	And without the game, there is nothing to stream.
8813760	8815120	Anyway, all right.
8816800	8818720	I'm sure there'll be more thoughts on this later.
8820080	8822720	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com
8822720	8824480	if you want to give more thoughts on this later.
8824480	8828000	Oh, no, I guess in chat while we were doing that email, that's a bummer.
8828000	8831280	I guess the stream died right in the middle of that for our live listeners.
8831280	8834240	Unfortunately, guys, there was a big storm in California over the weekend,
8834240	8837360	so I wouldn't be surprised at all if the internet's a little shitty as a result.
8838080	8839040	So sorry about that.
8839600	8843520	I was worried this might happen tonight with all the storms.
8843520	8846560	I'm just lucky the rain stopped right at six o'clock.
8846560	8848320	So I don't have to worry about power outages.
8848320	8848960	Knock on wood.
8849680	8850180	Let's hope.
8851120	8851920	Knock on particle boards.
8851920	8856160	Because I never did buy that UPS or whatever I'm supposed to get.
8856160	8856960	UPS?
8856960	8860800	What the universal power source or whatever the thing's called?
8860800	8862240	Uninterrupted power supply.
8862240	8862740	That's it.
8863600	8864320	I was close.
8864320	8864820	Oh.
8865760	8866240	Do you remember?
8866240	8868080	Oh, you weren't here that week.
8868080	8869840	Because it was Flaco that was here that week.
8869840	8871040	He was like filling in for you.
8871840	8874480	The power went out completely and we lost the show.
8874480	8875760	Flaco was here and I missed it?
8875760	8877440	Yeah, well, he'll come back.
8877440	8879520	I'm sure if you ask him really nicely too, he'll come back.
8881520	8882640	This is a long time ago.
8882640	8884560	This was when we were doing the show at the apartment.
8884560	8885360	It was a while ago.
8887200	8888000	Stop whining.
8889520	8890020	No.
8890640	8891140	Whatever.
8891920	8893200	I see how it is, Flaco.
8893840	8897840	Well, then I guess clearly somebody is in the mood to get to the FUs of the week.
8898000	8899360	Shall we get to the FUs of the week?
8900640	8901280	Whatevs.
8918480	8921440	FU to stuff I cannot discuss.
8922960	8923840	Reasons and things.
8924800	8929520	FU to my dear friend having crappy pneumonia like I did a few years ago.
8929520	8930080	You remember that?
8930640	8932880	I have a friend now going through almost exactly the same thing.
8932880	8935040	Yeah, I think that's why Flaco filled in for you that week.
8935920	8937040	That was years and years ago.
8937040	8937680	Oh, okay.
8937680	8940560	That was when I was still working at Hellhole.
8940560	8941060	Oh, dear.
8943120	8945120	Well, it didn't start off as Hellhole, but anyway.
8949200	8953680	The other FU goes towards having this creative outlet that I love, love, love,
8953680	8955840	that I can't stop working on.
8956800	8958480	And now, well, it's not this show.
8959600	8960320	You know what?
8961120	8962080	Love, you mean it.
8962080	8962400	I'm sorry.
8962400	8962880	I had to.
8962880	8963360	Come on.
8963360	8964640	You left yourself wide open for that.
8965600	8968000	I've got stuff in the works for the show.
8968000	8968640	Okay.
8968640	8970800	I told you, keep doing things.
8971360	8972240	Stuff's happening.
8972880	8975760	I will move mountains for OLR if they're really tiny, tiny, tiny.
8975760	8978960	By mountains, she means giant swollen balls again.
8978960	8980240	Or psychically thrown trucks.
8980240	8982560	I will kick some giant swollen balls.
8982640	8984320	Psychically thrown testicles.
8985600	8986080	There you go.
8986800	8987360	That's it.
8987360	8988240	We need a game.
8988240	8988480	Okay.
8988480	8989360	Do you remember?
8989360	8990400	Psycho testicles.
8990400	8992240	Pause, pause the music, pause the music, pause the music.
8992240	8993200	Yes, ma'am.
8993200	8994960	Do you remember the game, the game?
8994960	8995280	No.
8995280	8998720	When they had that like meeting going on and someone put in.
8998720	9000720	Like psycho knots and psycho nuts.
9000720	9001280	Let her finish.
9001280	9002080	Hold on.
9002080	9005840	And someone had like one of those little drone helicopter things, except it was a big
9006560	9008880	dick with balls floating around.
9009600	9011040	We need a helicopter game.
9011440	9014480	Called, um, what did you just call it?
9014480	9020720	Protector nuts, psycho, psycho nuts, psycho nuts, a shooter game called psycho nuts.
9020720	9025920	It's a little helicopter, Dick going around and shooting down all of our enemies.
9025920	9028480	It's like shoplifter, but cocklifter.
9029280	9030480	I like that even better.
9031360	9034800	I agree with dark Tetsuya in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
9034800	9035200	Wow.
9035200	9036000	Tonight's show.
9037600	9039120	We've earned our M rating.
9039440	9042720	Uh, we've, we've earned our, I am reading in the chair.
9043680	9044000	All right.
9044000	9045920	Do we, do we have, can I bring the music back?
9045920	9047040	I guess.
9047040	9047280	All right.
9047280	9048640	Loki, you're a fuse.
9048640	9055040	Uh, my after the week, I guess goes to just, I don't know, being distracted because
9055840	9059280	unfortunately I've been trying to work on my game and stuff, but when I get tired,
9059280	9065520	yeah, sometimes the internet distracts me and end up watching tons of YouTube videos
9065520	9066160	for no reason.
9069440	9070000	That's it.
9070000	9070560	That's it.
9070560	9070960	All right.
9070960	9072960	Um, stop it.
9072960	9077600	Uh, I have a really big epic FU I want to give, but I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm
9077600	9081040	going to be the bigger person, just bite my fricking tongue at least for one more week.
9081040	9086960	Um, but I will say this, I will give a, a more lighthearted FU to the Carolina hurricanes,
9087520	9093520	uh, for beating the San Jose sharks last night at my first ever hockey game that I went to
9093520	9094560	since I was in San Jose.
9094560	9097920	Anyway, my friends were like, Hey, you want to go to the sharks game tonight?
9098000	9099600	I was like, all right, sure.
9099600	9100720	I've never been to a hockey game.
9100720	9101280	What the hell?
9101280	9103840	So I went to my very first sharks game ever.
9103840	9106400	And, um, now you get your official bro license.
9106400	9107040	The team lost.
9107040	9107280	Yes.
9107280	9108160	And now I'm a bro.
9111680	9112400	Pop that color.
9115760	9118320	Hey, Loki, you want to go bro out?
9120000	9127520	No, I've only been in one hockey game too, but it was, it was one word for you.
9128000	9128320	What?
9129520	9130640	Dodge nads.
9130640	9132480	I, I will say this though.
9132480	9138480	And I somewhere, somewhere SSG100 Matt is going to be beaming when I say this, but I
9138480	9142320	actually really, really enjoyed myself and I want to go again.
9144160	9144800	Go sharks.
9145920	9146560	All right.
9146560	9150560	I think my favorite thing in the world was when they put the guy in the penalty box,
9150560	9152000	they would put it up on the big screen.
9152000	9155920	And when it was the opposing team, the dude would go in the penalty box and the big shark
9155920	9158160	teeth would come down and go chomp, chomp, chomp.
9159120	9163120	I don't know why, but that made me cackle like nothing else the entire night.
9163120	9165920	Cause the whole audience would do the chomp, chomp, chomp thing.
9166560	9170240	And I'm like, that guy has to sit in a box and think about what he did.
9172400	9175840	I'm like only in hockey where you get arrested for hooking.
9176880	9177920	That guy's a hooker.
9178720	9179120	All right.
9179120	9181520	Anyway, were there any fights that broke out?
9181520	9183920	Uh, no, but there was a dog pile, but no fights.
9183920	9185040	I want, Oh my God.
9185040	9187200	I wanted to go down there and punch some guy in the face.
9187200	9188880	I was that little sneaky little.
9189600	9191760	You want to know two facts?
9191760	9192260	What?
9192720	9196160	There are two fluids that will bounce on ice, blood and vomit.
9197760	9201920	Well, I unfortunately saw neither at the, uh, haven't lived show.
9201920	9202480	I know.
9202480	9202980	I know.
9203520	9204480	So there you go.
9204480	9207520	Perhaps my son will when he goes to Disney on ice this weekend.
9211120	9213520	I don't think a fight is supposed to break out.
9214480	9215680	It'd be unexpected.
9215680	9216720	I love that.
9216720	9217760	Unfortunately, I'm not going.
9217760	9219040	So, all right.
9219040	9223440	SSU and Hunter Madden chat says, Rob, going to an NHL game is the greatest crossover.
9224080	9226160	And as you went under, Matt says, Rob, I'll go with you.
9226160	9226480	Fine.
9226480	9227200	I'll come out.
9227200	9227760	What's your team?
9228480	9229920	It's gotta be New York.
9229920	9232080	So I'll, uh, I'll come to New York city.
9232080	9233200	We'll go to a game.
9233200	9234640	Do they ever get to play the sharks?
9234640	9235680	I'm still learning.
9235680	9236240	Bear with me here.
9236240	9237440	I don't know what teams are in what league.
9237440	9237940	You know what?
9239120	9242880	My, um, hometown, Mobile, Alabama has a hockey team.
9242880	9247440	It's not NHL, but they have a team called the mystics S S T I C K S.
9248480	9249200	Oh, I like that.
9249200	9250240	That's a clever name.
9250240	9254480	I did find it interesting though, that the Carolina hurricanes there, cause you know,
9254480	9258080	I'm just, as somebody who's kind of newer to this, I'm, I'm not going to be able to help,
9258080	9262880	but judge teams based on their colors, their mascots and their logos.
9262880	9263360	Right?
9263360	9263600	Yeah.
9263600	9264720	That's what it's important.
9264720	9267840	It's very important in choosing like what team you're going to root for.
9267840	9271680	And the sharks, you know, I got to say, not just the fact that they're a local team,
9271680	9273120	but teal's a rad color.
9273920	9277040	The fact that they can play in a shark tank is hilarious.
9277040	9279120	And shark is an amazing mascot.
9279120	9281120	It's a, it's, it's, it's a win-win all around.
9281120	9286240	Especially now that we have the super bowl shark, shark mascots are trending upwards.
9286240	9286960	That's right.
9286960	9287920	I know there was a mission.
9287920	9291280	I did an ingress where it was about the sharks, but I got left shark as my badge.
9291280	9292480	But anyway, I digress.
9293200	9297760	The Carolina hurricanes, their logo looks like a red butthole.
9297760	9300560	Like that's the logo for their team.
9300560	9304640	And I'm like, we're, we just lost to the red buttholes.
9306720	9309360	How did a shark lose to a butthole?
9310640	9311040	Anyway.
9311760	9316000	Well, it could have been a whale butthole in which case, you know, I could see that
9316000	9317280	there wouldn't be competition there.
9318640	9319120	Anyway.
9319120	9319680	All right.
9319680	9320560	Put them together though.
9320560	9322560	You get sharknado because the sharks are hurricane.
9322560	9322800	All right.
9322800	9324960	Anyway, I'm moving on.
9326800	9327840	There's going to be a week.
9327840	9330000	I come on this show and you're going to be like, how was your gaming week?
9330000	9331360	I'm going to be like, you know what?
9331360	9334800	I played NHL 15 played blades of steel.
9334800	9337680	He gave you like, which is also on the, who is Rob?
9337680	9339200	Where did you do with him?
9339200	9339520	All right.
9339520	9341760	Anyway, uh, just a couple more stories for you guys.
9341760	9344480	Then we're going to get to our Skype line at one eight seven seven game.
9344480	9348000	Olr or a username on Skype is orange lounge radio.
9348000	9348400	Loki.
9348400	9352640	They may have been wondering, what does all that shark talk have to do with anything in
9352640	9353040	gaming?
9353040	9357440	Well, I'm about to tell you because they're going to make a Katy Perry game.
9357920	9358480	That's right.
9358480	9362880	Katy Perry as in, you know, the one dance with sharks during the super bowl half time.
9363600	9368160	And it's coming to you from glue mobile who was behind Kim Kardashian in Hollywood.
9368160	9371520	So you have to know that which has a great soundtrack.
9373360	9378480	You can hate on Kim Kardashian, Hollywood, all you want, but the soundtrack is awesome.
9378480	9381920	I'm telling you, this is one of those games that I'm thank God that you do not have eye
9381920	9386720	tracking software because it just wouldn't be for me.
9387440	9388880	Why do you keep looking at the shark?
9390000	9391440	Because they're so awesome.
9392240	9394800	I seriously want one of those for like Halloween.
9395520	9401840	I have a feeling that's going to be a really overdone, like cosplay and Halloween costume
9401840	9402800	later this year.
9402800	9406480	But there's still a lot of time for a new meme to show up between now and Halloween.
9406480	9408080	So there's a lot of time.
9408080	9408800	We'll see.
9408800	9409680	There's a lot of time.
9411200	9411600	All right.
9411600	9415040	But, uh, yeah, um, I'm not sure when it's supposed to be coming out.
9415040	9421040	Apparently they're saying that, uh, Android or they have, uh, a five year deal with, uh,
9422240	9426640	Katy Perry that they're going to put out, you know, some games, um, apparently on Android
9426640	9429520	and iOS and I don't know.
9429520	9432080	So hopefully, well, maybe we'll see that soon.
9433360	9437760	William murder face with the lulls and chat saying it's a shame that the Katy Perry game
9437760	9439280	won't be made by dark horse.
9440240	9440560	Get it?
9440560	9442080	Cause she has a song called dark.
9443760	9444320	I understand.
9445600	9451120	Hey, from Katy Perry to doctor who, I don't know what those two things have in common
9451120	9454000	whatsoever, but, uh, work with me here on this transition.
9454720	9458960	Apparently there's a new doctor who game that will help kids learn to code.
9459600	9465760	It's a free doctor who game, uh, available from the BBC called the doctor and the Dalek.
9465760	9469280	It's available on Android, iOS, and Amazon app stores.
9469280	9474400	And it's a platforming adventure, but it includes logic based programming.
9474400	9478720	You know, if, then, or, and all those types of things you see in programming.
9478720	9481360	Peter Capaldi actually lends his voice to the game.
9481360	9487440	It was written by Phil Ford, one of the series writers, there's three worlds and 12 levels.
9487440	9492320	And you will go on the hunt for the orb of fates, an ancient device from the time war
9492320	9496160	that unlocks the star bane, a weapon that can wipe out whole solar systems.
9496160	9498720	And of course the Dalek and the cyber men are fighting over this.
9498720	9500800	So the doctor serves as a mentor.
9500800	9502560	He is not the main character.
9503200	9508080	He's helping to control a reprogrammed Dalek in search of the artifact.
9508800	9514080	BBC learning commissioned this game and it ties into the IT curriculum that the
9514080	9517680	government has been focusing on over there with modern computer skills.
9517680	9518720	That sounds like fun.
9518720	9521360	It sounds like a modern version of something like Rocky's boots.
9522080	9526000	But now using characters, you know, from doctor who beloved series like that.
9526000	9527680	Dark Sakura, would you check this out?
9527680	9528960	You want to learn some programming?
9529760	9532320	Although I'm sure the basics are things you probably already aware of,
9532320	9535040	but I'd suggest it to people.
9535040	9535600	Yeah.
9535600	9536640	That'd be fun to check out.
9536640	9537140	Yeah.
9537600	9538100	All right.
9538640	9542000	Loki, you want to play some doctor who learned a thing or two about programming?
9542880	9545040	Uh, kind of already doing that.
9545040	9545920	I think it's good.
9545920	9548880	I like that they have that type of stuff that makes it accessible.
9548880	9551120	Anything to get more people interested in that kind of stuff.
9551120	9551680	I do too.
9551680	9554320	This type of stuff I wish was around when I was a kid, to be honest.
9554320	9555360	I really wish so.
9556320	9556720	All right.
9556720	9560240	Well, uh, that does it for the news tonight that we had on deck.
9560240	9561760	So let's open up the Skype line.
9561760	9566240	It's open 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9566240	9566800	All one word.
9566800	9570000	If you want to give us a call, Skype line is open now.
9570000	9573600	In the meantime, I'll turn to Loki and see real quick if he has any last minute stories.
9573600	9574480	I do not.
9574480	9575040	You do not.
9575840	9577040	It's a slow news week.
9577920	9578560	It has been.
9578560	9581440	There hasn't been as much going on this week as previous weeks.
9581440	9585840	Just, but there's been like, it's just a few big things, you know, like the Zelda
9585840	9587840	rumor, which isn't even really news.
9588720	9591360	I'm going to try to go to the Twitter here while we wait for some calls, but Oh,
9591520	9592640	Hey, the phones are lighting up.
9592640	9592960	Hooray.
9592960	9593520	Let's get to it.
9593520	9596400	We do have a call on the line, so let's get to it.
9596400	9597440	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9597440	9598240	Who's this?
9598240	9599520	Hey guys, it's Jason.
9599520	9600320	Hey, Jason.
9600320	9601200	Good to see you.
9601200	9602640	I see you on the webcams.
9602640	9602960	Yes.
9602960	9606000	With your epic new microphone, which I'm so jealous of.
9607520	9607840	Yeah.
9607840	9611600	If anybody, uh, if anybody hasn't really noticed, go listen to last week's episode
9611600	9612960	and then listen to this week's episode.
9612960	9616800	There's a tiny, tiny, a little bit of a difference.
9616800	9617360	Yeah.
9617360	9620400	If you, if you didn't notice, Jason has an epic new microphone.
9620400	9621120	It's great.
9621360	9625440	Well, they didn't, cause I haven't actually like posted anything about it publicly yet.
9625440	9629520	Just a bunch of, uh, a bunch of friends, a couple of coworkers, and then some people
9629520	9633520	that I do things with on a, on Twitch actually have seen it so far.
9633520	9636240	We're all waiting for you to start a new podcast at some point.
9636240	9638480	I'm sure, I'm sure that's going to be a thing someday.
9638480	9642320	There's, there's a lot of stuff going on right now.
9642320	9645600	And it's basically just seen, seen what can actually be committed to.
9645600	9646240	I understand.
9646240	9647600	Well, anyway, enough about all that.
9647600	9648480	What's on your mind tonight?
9648960	9652720	So we were having this discussion right at the top of the show, um, the discussion of
9652720	9655600	Netflix and the 3DS and all that stuff, uh, kind of tangled in.
9655600	9658560	And I said something that I've never really thought about before.
9658560	9666000	Um, I said 3D is the sixties sci-fi expectation of immersion in the future.
9666880	9672240	And I think, uh, I said it, so I'm admittedly biased, but I think that was actually like
9672240	9673920	a shockingly accurate thing to say.
9673920	9680000	Like they, 3D, 3D is, is still a very interesting effect.
9680000	9683440	You know, depth simulated depth is still a huge thing.
9683440	9689680	Um, but considering that it's just limited to watching and experience, we've already
9689680	9690800	surpassed that.
9691520	9697520	Um, the, the point that I made in the conversation in chat was that even if it's not 3D computers
9697520	9703840	and the internet have already completely usurped that because we can virtually be,
9704160	9709120	anywhere in the world around virtually be around whoever we want to be around and have
9709120	9714000	these, you know, previously impossible kind of connections with people and places and
9714000	9719600	things, not physically, but that's not necessarily always a requirement.
9719600	9724000	I'm just, some day, Jason, as weird as it sounds, and I know people are going to take
9724000	9726240	this to a dirty place, but hear me out here.
9726240	9730000	Some day, Jason, you're going to be able to feel them too, even though they might not
9730000	9731120	necessarily be right there.
9731120	9733200	I mean, everything is one step closer to the holodeck.
9733200	9735920	That's some day, but science fiction, right?
9735920	9741520	You talk about the sixties 3D, I'm talking about star Trek, which to be fair is the sixties
9741520	9744640	originally, but I guess my mind, my mind is set on next generation.
9744640	9745360	Okay.
9745360	9747040	Star Trek is next generation to me.
9747040	9751440	So, uh, I just think about the holodeck and how a lot of gaming stuff gets one step closer
9751440	9752000	to it.
9752000	9752320	Yeah.
9752320	9753440	And it's just interesting.
9753440	9758480	It's just funny that the way that we're getting there is also with no concept of touch, touch
9758480	9760800	reactive, but no concept of touch.
9761600	9763840	Akuma JP in chat with a good point though.
9763840	9764960	Well, we can print it.
9765600	9768800	So we are, I mean, we are getting closer to that touch.
9768800	9775520	I mean, you can, you can visualize it and you can make it granted, maybe not today.
9775520	9780160	Like there's a lot of limitations on what it is you can do, but when they're advertising
9780160	9784800	a fucking three dimensional pen in sky mall, rest in peace.
9785520	9789760	And now, you know, where I saw this last on a plane, I'm like, the future is here.
9791040	9796960	It's a, those, those, I don't even know what the proper, what the proper marketing name
9796960	9797440	for it is.
9797440	9802320	I want to call them like sky writing pins, uh, are definitely interesting.
9802320	9807280	I, I think I'm going to have a disconnect from it until I can actually get my hands
9807280	9807840	on it.
9807840	9811920	Not to mention, I'm not exactly the creative type in that way anyways.
9811920	9814640	So, but yeah, it's, it's absolutely interesting.
9814640	9819680	3d printing, uh, both at the personal scale as well as the professional scale.
9819680	9822560	Like that is, that is a huge step forward.
9822560	9826960	I think the problem is, is that printing has a lot of permanence to it.
9826960	9833280	Um, that it's still like worlds away from being holodeck, from being seen creation,
9833280	9836880	destruction and rebuilding and anything along those lines.
9836880	9840880	Like 3d printing is going to be better for, uh, architecture.
9840880	9844320	And there's been talk about like medical 3d printing and all that kind of stuff.
9844320	9850560	Like that's going to apply with permanence, with things that have to have a place in the
9850560	9850880	world.
9852240	9855200	So, uh, it's just, it's just crazy seeing how far we've come.
9855200	9859280	And if you think about it, all this 3d printing stuff, this technology is still really, really
9859280	9860080	new and emerging.
9860080	9863840	I mean, this is only really within the past two years, you know, that we're seeing this
9863840	9867680	really start to take off and it's, it's really weird to think like, where the hell are we
9867680	9869280	going to be in five more years?
9869280	9873760	Yeah, it's, it's the best time to be, it's the best time to be a geek.
9873760	9876400	What a time to be alive, even more the truth.
9876400	9878000	What a time to be alive, right?
9878880	9884720	I've talked about, uh, as, as like gaming has kind of come and gone, uh, as I have kind
9884720	9886960	of gotten into and out of gaming and that kind of stuff.
9886960	9894560	I've always talked about as a kid, I always identified as a gamer, but in my adulthood,
9894560	9899360	both professionally and personally, I've kind of noticed that it's just tech centric and
9899360	9901280	gaming was kind of the best expression of that.
9901280	9902960	I play games on a console.
9902960	9904240	I play games on a computer.
9904240	9904960	I'm a gamer.
9906000	9913280	But I've kind of noticed that I'm more general tech and just very, very happily gaming is
9913280	9917680	one of, you know, the, the primary subdivisions categories, whatever you want to call it.
9917680	9921440	It's kind of funny you put it that way, because if you think about it, the evolution of this
9921440	9924640	show, this very show has gone down a very similar path, right?
9924640	9928720	We were about DDR and then it was, well, we've got to talk about some more music games cause
9928720	9929840	we're not making DDR.
9929840	9933760	And then it was, well, I guess really we just like video games and DDR is just the video
9933760	9935040	game we're all playing right now.
9935040	9936400	Let's talk about video games.
9936400	9938720	And now we're on the voice of geeks network.
9938720	9941920	It turns out video games is really just one of many geeky things I'm into, you know?
9941920	9942480	Absolutely.
9942480	9947520	I think there's a lot of crossover, although admittedly, because I focus so much time on
9947520	9952880	gaming, I don't get a chance to watch as much anime, but I appreciate that fandom.
9952880	9953760	It's there.
9953760	9958720	There's a lot of fun stuff that goes on over there, but we've got Rama and Patty and Ari
9958720	9961440	talking about all that over on the anime jam session and so forth.
9961440	9964240	That's why I love what we're doing here at VOG and so forth.
9964240	9968480	So absolutely leave it to the people that can speak definitively on that and be a very
9968480	9971200	happy enabler or just a fan.
9971200	9972240	Yeah, exactly.
9972240	9972960	Exactly.
9972960	9973520	Anyway, sorry.
9973520	9977280	Not to, not to turn your call into self-promotion, but you know, it's gonna happen.
9977280	9978480	Sometimes it's gonna happen.
9978480	9981600	I like, I like the, uh, the, the philosophic.
9982240	9984320	Is that even a proper conjunction?
9984320	9985360	I like philosophical.
9985360	9985760	Thank you.
9985760	9987520	I like philosophical topics.
9987520	9989200	Right word, wrong pronunciation.
9991760	9992240	Whatever.
9992240	9993360	That's all right.
9993360	9994080	English.
9994080	9994560	That's all right.
9994560	9996400	That's why you're the perfect voiceover guy.
9996400	9996720	All right.
9998240	10000320	Uh, if you, I'll take your word for that one.
10000320	10001040	All right.
10001040	10003200	All right, my friend, I'm gonna let you go so we can get some more calls.
10003200	10004000	Have a good night, everyone.
10004000	10005360	Talk to you in the future.
10006880	10007120	All right.
10007120	10007680	Bye.
10007680	10008180	Bye.
10008880	10013440	1-877-GAMO-L-R or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10013440	10016880	I'm always happy when Jason calls in the show so I can check on his beard progress.
10018160	10018400	Man.
10018400	10019360	It's amazing.
10019360	10023040	You know, there's, there's going to come a day though when Jason's going to be like,
10023040	10024240	yeah, I just shaved it off.
10024240	10026720	You know, I just, I just felt like shaving it off.
10026720	10033280	I'm going to tell Jason what I told our friend, Will, that he needs to braid it like a dwarf.
10033920	10037520	No, he needs, no, Jason looks just dwarven braids.
10037520	10040560	But if he ever does come that day where he's just going to be like, you know what?
10040560	10041920	I'm just going to shave it off.
10041920	10046000	He needs to like donate the hair to one of those charities that makes wigs or something.
10046000	10049200	I actually wonder what happens if you take a straightener to a beard.
10050480	10050880	I don't know.
10052240	10055680	I want someone to show me what it looks like when you use a hair straightener on a beard.
10058560	10060720	Isn't the answer on Reddit or Google somewhere?
10060720	10061680	I'm about to Google this shit.
10061680	10062960	Can you go to Ask Reddit?
10062960	10063600	Dear Reddit.
10065200	10065760	All right.
10065760	10074160	1-877-GAMO-L-R or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
10074160	10077280	And Jason is in chat saying, there's nothing wrong with braiding.
10077280	10079200	It's less permanent than shaving.
10079200	10079680	There you go.
10080640	10083840	I was trying to go to the Twitters to see if we had any tweets.
10083840	10088000	SSG100Matt did tweet us, you know, we're going up against the Grammys tonight.
10089680	10094160	My God, I really, really cannot stand the Grammys.
10094160	10098160	And it's not just the competitive thing about the fact that, oh, they're on the same time as our show.
10098160	10100800	I mean, talk about, talk about irrelevant.
10100800	10101760	Let's just leave it at that.
10101760	10104880	But I'm sure there were some fine performances in some great fashion.
10105520	10110640	But anyway, SSG100Matt did tweet us and say, no need to check up on the Grammy winners.
10110640	10113520	Betty White won song and album of the year.
10114800	10116800	Of course, she always would give her all the awards.
10116800	10117600	She wins everything.
10119680	10124720	You know, the thing about the Grammys is that I'm sure your favorite song didn't even get nominated.
10124720	10128240	I bet your favorite album of the year didn't even get nominated.
10128320	10131920	So, I don't know, what do the Grammys even mean?
10131920	10136160	I found a picture of a YouTube clip of someone using a straightener on his beard,
10136160	10138640	but it was a tiny beard and not a dwarf beard.
10138640	10140000	Like a beard like me, huh?
10141120	10142720	No, it was a little bit longer than yours.
10142720	10149120	It's kind of one of those scraggly, you know, face throws, but not like an epic beard like.
10149120	10149840	All right.
10149840	10150800	Oh, sorry.
10150800	10156960	I was just going to say, I'm going to just give a few more minutes here for there to be a call to come in here.
10158400	10161760	But last call, if you want to get in for the night, 1877 Game O-L-R,
10161760	10164480	or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10165520	10169600	People in chat is talking about Beck won album of the year.
10169600	10170160	For real?
10171200	10173600	That's actually my favorite.
10173600	10175600	They had an album out this year?
10175600	10176240	Well, Beck.
10176240	10176560	Oh, yeah.
10176560	10178320	Beck's still been making music.
10178320	10179440	Alan likes him a lot.
10179440	10182320	I bet he'll be tickled to hear about that.
10182320	10184080	That's kind of interesting to hear that.
10184080	10188880	But I thought they were going to give it to that British guy that stole the Tom Petty song.
10188880	10190480	I thought that's what they were all saying.
10190480	10193040	But anyway, as much as I appreciate Beck,
10193040	10194880	that wasn't my favorite of the album of the year last year.
10194880	10196080	I didn't even realize one was out.
10196640	10200160	Anyway, 13X forever or 13X forever.
10200160	10202240	I can never remember which way you prefer it to be pronounced.
10202240	10203440	I think it's 13X forever.
10205360	10206800	Sends us a tweet saying,
10206800	10210160	so I just finished Chrono Trigger for the first time.
10210160	10211600	Closing time, huh?
10211680	10213840	From now on, it will never be the same.
10213840	10218000	In reference to the song we depart you with every week here at Orange Lounge Radio.
10218000	10222160	Well, I'm glad you got to kind of hear that song in the game.
10222160	10223920	And maybe it was a little surprise for you.
10223920	10225920	The actual name of it is Too Far Away Times.
10226640	10227280	Oh, thank you.
10229600	10232320	Also, I wanted to just give a shout out because I saw a few tweets on this.
10232320	10235120	Thank you to those of you that nominated us in the podcast awards.
10235680	10237920	If you forgot to do that, it's too late, unfortunately.
10237920	10239760	They closed on February 6th.
10239760	10242240	And I'm somewhere on the fence with all that stuff.
10242240	10244880	Although certainly the promotion is really great.
10244880	10249520	And I'm always very thankful if we can get nominated to get that additional exposure.
10249520	10256400	Because as an indie podcast, it's very hard for us sometimes to get that exposure.
10256400	10260640	Especially if we focus everything we do on the podcast.
10260640	10262240	So we don't have a YouTube.
10262240	10263600	We don't have a Twitch.
10263600	10264720	We don't do...
10264720	10265600	I mean, we have those.
10265600	10267600	We don't really focus on them, you know what I mean?
10268160	10270400	We don't make things specific for YouTube.
10270400	10271680	Because Jason's probably sitting there going,
10271680	10273440	wait a minute, you do have a YouTube.
10273440	10276160	But the YouTube is for what we're doing now.
10276160	10278160	We don't do a lot of custom created things.
10278160	10282400	It's not our focus or what have you.
10282400	10286880	So anyway, getting that exposure is great.
10288800	10290880	I don't know if we'll get actually nominated or not.
10290880	10292560	But then there's that whole side of it where it's like,
10292560	10294880	well, it's also a giant popularity contest.
10294880	10295600	And I don't know.
10296560	10300400	I just hope we can keep it indie and get some additional exposure
10300400	10302000	for the hardworking indie people out there.
10302000	10302400	And you know what?
10302400	10304000	I always say it at the end of every show.
10304000	10306960	If you didn't like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio,
10306960	10310400	then at least tell a friend or two about the show and help us spread the word.
10310400	10313280	Because it is the show where every gamer has a voice.
10313280	10317120	But there's lots of voices out there that aren't participating with the program.
10318160	10318660	All right.
10319520	10321040	And good, Jason in chat saying,
10321040	10324000	the YouTube videos are not a unique product.
10324000	10325520	It's another medium for the show.
10326480	10329600	It's another way to deliver the bread and butter of what it is that we do.
10330800	10332400	And he says, I know exactly what you meant.
10332400	10332900	Thank you.
10333920	10334420	All right.
10336000	10337760	Anyhow, the phone's not ringing.
10337760	10339840	So I guess no more voices.
10339840	10341920	I want to continue tonight.
10341920	10344320	I guess everybody's too distracted with them silly Grammys.
10344960	10348240	But if you do have other thoughts after the show, you can always email us.
10348240	10350880	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
10350880	10355280	And you can also hit us up on social media and our forums over at vognetwork.com.
10355280	10359920	Where we will continue some of the discussions from tonight's show throughout the week.
10359920	10362720	And give you a preview of some stories to come next week.
10363360	10366400	Anyway, we have reached the end of another episode of the show.
10366400	10369600	Thank you guys very much for listening and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
10369600	10371120	Since I already gave you that whole spiel,
10371120	10373840	we'll go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.
10373840	10375520	I will start with my final thought for the night.
10375520	10377440	My final thought for the night is,
10377440	10380160	I'm going to try and play at least one new game this week.
10380160	10383040	So I have something new to talk about during my gaming week next week.
10383040	10388320	As much as I love Diablo 3, and season 2 starts Friday, and I can't wait,
10388320	10391440	I'm going to really try to do something new for you guys.
10392240	10393680	Dark Sakura, your final thought tonight?
10394400	10396160	I like big butts and I cannot lie.
10397280	10398560	You other brothers can't deny?
10399600	10401200	They could deny it. They'd be wrong.
10402560	10405760	And last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight?
10406400	10409040	Um, I'm working on my game some more.
10410000	10411760	Hopefully I will have something...
10411760	10414080	I want to get more than one level done for this week.
10414720	10415840	And I want to get...
10415840	10417840	I want to be rated five strips of bacon.
10418880	10421040	Sorry, it only goes up to three, possibly four.
10421040	10421280	What?
10422960	10424720	Are you sure it's not like a thing you unlock,
10424720	10427040	where like five is the super secret level?
10427040	10429520	Four would be super secret, actually, maybe.
10431200	10433440	Already blown away the secrets of your game and it's not even...
10433440	10434480	I haven't decided yet.
10434480	10436720	It's just a thought right now.
10436720	10437600	All right.
10437600	10438720	All right, that's going to do it.
10438960	10439840	Wait, wait, wait.
10439840	10441520	I did not make a reference to Anaconda.
10442320	10444400	I made a reference to Sir Mix-A-Lot.
10444400	10444880	Get it right.
10445520	10446560	All right, fair enough.
10448160	10449200	That's going to do it.
10449200	10450640	Thank you very much, everybody,
10450640	10452400	for listening to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.
10452400	10454240	We will be back in seven days,
10454240	10458800	just after Valentine's Day to do it all over again.
10458800	10462240	And, you know, I know there's a lot of people that on Valentine's Day are like,
10462240	10465600	you know, well, I'm single and I hate Valentine's Day.
10465600	10467920	You know who needs love on Valentine's Day?
10467920	10469200	All the people who are massacred
10469200	10471280	in the name of getting married when the church banned it?
10471280	10473840	No. Kittens and puppies.
10474480	10474720	So...
10474720	10477040	Go adopt a kitten on Valentine's Day.
10477040	10479280	Yes, that would always be a great thought,
10479280	10483440	is if you are going to be alone on Valentine's Day,
10483440	10486160	I'm sure there's a kitten or a puppy that would really love.
10488400	10491120	I will be hugging Midna.
10492320	10493840	Have a great week, everybody.
10493840	10495120	On that note, we will leave it at that.
10495120	10495680	Have a great week.
