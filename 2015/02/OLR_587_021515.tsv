14000	19000	Tonight's show is brought to you by the letter M as we interview two of the creators of a multi-genre retro game named Starmazer.
19000	22000	And you too can help see the tales of brick stone wood come to life.

27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	44000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 587 for this February 15th, 2015.
44000	48000	My name is Rob Roberts, also known online as Skie on Twitter and so forth.
49000	58000	With you guys here live at the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts here in studio.
58000	61000	Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
61000	62000	Yo.
62000	63000	How you doing?
63000	64000	I'm here.
64000	65000	You're here.
65000	67000	I'm full of egg custard.
67000	68000	Egg custard.
68000	71000	And taro milk tea.
71000	75000	We were talking about ice cream before the show which is always a great conversation to have I believe.
75000	80000	Yes, except it's not all that great if you don't actually have the ice cream.
80000	81000	That is true.
81000	84000	So I might have to make a pit stop on the way home.
84000	88000	You know it's no secret that DarkSakura and I are very fond of Pinkberry frozen yogurt.
88000	91000	And they don't pay us to say that, we genuinely do like it.
91000	93000	But if they wanted to pay us, we wouldn't say no.
93000	94000	Or especially in free yogurt.
94000	98000	But I was telling DarkSakura, we were talking about that a little bit, and she had brought up the egg custard and I said,
98000	102000	Did you know there's a creamery place right near her that uses like egg custard?
102000	106000	And DarkSakura was like, really? With little stars in her eyes.
106000	112000	There was a place though that my friend told me about that went out of business that was a frozen custard place.
112000	113000	Interesting.
113000	118000	And I wish I, I've had stuff from there before, I don't remember the name of it.
118000	120000	But frozen custard is actually very good.
120000	122000	Yum yum, delicious.
122000	124000	Making me hungry for dessert.
124000	128000	Also, definitely one of our food connoisseurs here on Orange Lounge Radio.
128000	130000	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
130000	133000	If by food connoisseur you mean food carnivore, then yes.
135000	138000	Getting, that's three weeks in a row from your new sandwich place.
138000	139000	I'm probably not gonna get it next week.
139000	141000	It just sounded good, I was really hungry.
141000	142000	Yeah.
142000	143000	Because I hadn't had lunch.
143000	144000	It's all good.
144000	147000	So I got the meatball sub at this time, the large meatball sub instead of the small meatball sub.
147000	150000	Food's important, it's a three hour show we do here.
150000	154000	Live at the Voice of the Geeks Network every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
154000	160000	It was either that or I was going to get crazy bread from Little Caesars with a ludicrous amount of cheese on it.
160000	163000	But I didn't, I didn't stop there.
163000	166000	I may do that next week, but we'll see, I don't know.
166000	168000	Alright, that's fair, that works.
168000	170000	Alright, we are of course here live with you guys.
170000	177000	And if you are listening live, you can participate with our show by heading over to the chat room over at live.vognetwork.com
177000	183000	Some folks in chat, it looks like a lot of folks talking about the snow in Boston because at the end of Bobby's show,
183000	189000	because of course we are on live at VOG right after Bobby Black Wolf, he was talking about PAX East and Boston and all that.
189000	193000	And some of us that are heading out to PAX East, which by the way, yes, I will be heading out to PAX East.
193000	195000	I'll talk more about that later.
195000	197000	But if you're going to be at the show, I will be there.
197000	199000	Sadly, Loki and Dark Sakura will not be there, but I will.
200000	202000	But now I have a legit concern.
202000	208000	My California never sees snow, but is going to have to go to Boston.
208000	214000	And I'm hoping this wintermageddon that's been going on out there, I'm really hoping it lets up in the next few weeks.
214000	216000	Because I don't know, I don't know.
216000	220000	I remember I went to the very first PAX East actually back in, what was it, 2010?
220000	222000	I think it was the very first PAX East.
222000	224000	And it was snowing a little bit then.
224000	231000	So it's not like, okay, I'm not going to die if it snows, but I just, please, I'd like my flight to get in and out on time.
231000	233000	Thank you. Be very nice. Appreciate it.
233000	239000	Get in and out on time, but when it lands, it'll start doing, you know, fucking, you know, drift racing.
239000	242000	Don't say that. Oh my god, don't say that. Alright.
242000	244000	It's like Wangan Midnight once you hit that.
244000	247000	Well, if they play Eurobeat, it might be okay.
247000	249000	That's the only acceptable way.
249000	251000	We're going to need to make a special landing.
251000	253000	Hit it.
253000	258000	Just JetBlue have like that on one of their satellite radio things, you know.
258000	261000	This is my heartbeat.
261000	263000	That would be awesome. That should really be on all flights.
263000	265000	Take off the landings, you know.
265000	267000	The music, they would go with that.
267000	271000	HavicNights have an 8-hour chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
271000	273000	It says, prepare for that wind chill, Rob.
273000	276000	I don't even know if I have a jacket sufficient enough.
276000	281000	Keep in mind, I live in Sacramento, land of 110 degrees summer sometimes.
281000	283000	It's 77 degrees today.
283000	285000	It's like a May day today.
285000	287000	I'm like, what's up with that?
287000	289000	Not like an emergency, but an actual day in May.
289000	291000	Like, stop it, nature.
291000	295000	And we need water. Bring the snow over here. We're in a super drought.
295000	297000	Well, we're not really in a super drought.
297000	300000	We did have all that rain a few days ago.
300000	303000	Yeah, but that barely put it down. That was like a notch in the bed.
303000	305000	That's all it was.
305000	307000	We just split the difference.
307000	311000	Alright, anyway, we could talk about the weather and food for three hours,
311000	313000	but we want to talk about games.
313000	315000	And we have an interview, actually, live on tonight's show.
315000	321000	I'm very excited to welcome two of the team members, Dawn and Austin, from StarMazer.
321000	323000	We're going to be talking to them in about 15 minutes.
323000	328000	But if you want to check out their game, they are on Kickstarter in the last few days,
328000	330000	trying to raise the funds to make this game happen.
330000	332000	And I've got to say, it looks really cool.
332000	336000	I wouldn't have invited them on the show if the game didn't kind of meet the standards we're looking at here.
336000	339000	You can check this out online. It's StarMazer.com.
339000	343000	That's S-T-A-R-R M-A-Z-E-R dot com.
343000	348000	And it's kind of like part point and click, part shoot-em-up.
348000	351000	But it's not two games in one. It's like a blended experience.
351000	352000	We're going to talk to Dawn.
352000	354000	Like the Guardian Legend.
354000	359000	Well, why do you think this might have tickled a soft spot for me?
359000	363000	But no, when you think point and click though, point and click more like a LucasArts type game.
363000	364000	Well, yeah, I understand that.
364000	366000	So it's not quite the Guardian Legend.
366000	368000	But definitely, definitely was hitting a soft spot there.
368000	370000	But we'll talk to them about that.
370000	373000	And you can ask them questions as well in our chat room in about 15 minutes.
373000	374000	We'll get to that.
374000	378000	But I want to get to our kickoff topic first and then see if we have enough time for our gaming weeks.
378000	380000	Kickoff topic tonight.
380000	382000	I don't know if you guys saw this going around the internet
382000	386000	and you guys in chat that are participating live with the show.
386000	391000	But there was a rumor over the weekend that started on 4chan of all places.
391000	394000	You know, the minute you hear that something starts there,
394000	398000	there's instantly like this big bag of salt just falls from the sky.
398000	401000	And it's like, here, here's your big grain of salt, right?
401000	408000	So the rumor was that Rayman is going to be a playable DLC character in Super Smash Brothers.
408000	411000	Which is not something we haven't heard before.
411000	415000	We've heard rumors that Ubisoft wanted Rayman in the game.
415000	417000	There's a Rayman trophy.
417000	424000	It wasn't like one of those characters were like, this is outside all, you know, plausibility what could possibly happen, right?
424000	431000	So there's your giant salt that falls from the sky and it's like, alright, well, sure, sure, we've got some pictures,
431000	433000	but that shit can be photoshopped, whatever.
433000	436000	Well then, a video comes out.
436000	439000	And the video actually shows the character select screen.
439000	445000	And, you know, moving through the different characters and landing on Rayman.
445000	449000	So Rayman shows up and the whole thing like it's straight out of the game, right?
449000	451000	And so the video is pretty convincing.
451000	457000	And I think I even said on Twitter, I said, alright, if this is fake, this is one of the best fakes that's ever been done.
457000	461000	Well, guess what? Guess what, y'all? It was fake.
461000	462000	Of course it was fake.
462000	468000	Because if it was real, they would show you going from the title screen to actually playing a match with Rayman
468000	473000	and showing off all the cool stuff instead of like, see, here's an icon on the screen.
473000	477000	See, here's me moving to the... No, it's always fake when it's that shit.
477000	479000	It's never legit if it's, you know...
479000	482000	Did you watch the video of the guy who put it all together?
482000	484000	Yeah, I watched it. It was cool.
484000	488000	I mean, I have such mixed feelings about this and that's why I bring this to the table.
488000	492000	Because certainly there's that element of, you little shit.
492000	496000	Why did you start a fake rumor for the sake of starting a fake rumor?
496000	500000	It's fine. You know, I played a joke and it was over within like a day, so that's cool.
500000	507000	Yeah, but at the same token, though, you're like, wow, he put a lot of work into this and it was really convincing.
507000	515000	You've seen all the ones they've done for Five Nights at Freddy's and even back in the day on, you know, for EGM.
515000	519000	You know, we had all the Street Fighter ones and it's nothing new.
519000	521000	Yeah. Oh, man. I remember we were younger.
521000	522000	The jokes are fun.
522000	525000	We were convinced that Ermac was legit and then...
525000	527000	And then Ermac was legit.
527000	529000	Yeah, Ed Boon was like, let's make it legit.
529000	531000	Yeah, sure. Why not? So there it is.
531000	535000	Looking in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, SSG100Matt says,
535000	539000	Rumor coming from 4chan. That should be the start and end to any rumor.
539000	544000	Look, it's not that I disagree with you, but it's like the monkeys on the typewriter typing Shakespeare.
544000	545000	Yeah, let's put it this way.
545000	553000	If there's ever going to be a rumor about leaked DLC or something like that, they will fucking show you the character, you know, being played in the game.
553000	556000	They're not going to just show you the title screen because that's all they have.
556000	559000	It's not like, well, that should be enough, you know.
559000	569000	They will show you everything because it makes for a better story if you can see, like, here's the moves they have and here's, you know, the final smashes they have and that kind of stuff.
569000	574000	So that's why, like, when I immediately saw something, I'm like, that's not real.
574000	577000	It looks cool, but that's not real.
579000	583000	Um, what do you... I mean, did you believe it at all? Be honest.
583000	584000	No, I didn't.
584000	585000	You didn't?
585000	592000	Yeah, because I didn't know that it came from 4chan, but I saw it on NeoGaf and I was like, well, that's not real.
592000	600000	Did any... Now, I didn't catch this because I only saw it on Twitter and places like that, but did any big websites actually pick it up and run with it?
600000	602000	I think everybody ran it as, like, it's a rumor.
602000	606000	Okay, so everybody ran it as a rumor because I thought maybe part of the whole experiment was...
606000	608000	And to be fair, I didn't watch the entire video.
608000	614000	I wasn't going to spend 20 minutes looking at how this guy faked everybody out, but I kind of, like, I kind of skimmed through it a little bit.
614000	624000	And I was like, maybe part of it is, because I've seen people do this before where they kind of want to test gaming media and see, like, how far will that copy-paste journalism go, you know, type of thing.
624000	626000	And so I thought maybe that was part of it was...
626000	628000	Just give them ideas for DLC, I mean...
630000	643000	Well, I guess maybe that's one final question for me to ask on this whole thing is, do you think, in spite of all this stuff going on, do you think that Rayman could actually end up being DLC?
643000	655000	I don't see why they couldn't. I mean, depends on what the relationship with Ubisoft is with Nintendo currently, because I know at one time, you know, that they're pretty buddy-buddy, especially with the launch of the Wii, or the Wii U.
655000	670000	Well, I should just say even the Wii, because they're pretty supportive of the Wii as well, but, you know, Rayman was going to be, you know, a strong reason why you would need to buy that system, but I don't know, they've kind of backed away from that now, so I don't know.
670000	676000	They could see them doing it, I guess, but I'm sure they've got plenty of ideas for DLC characters.
676000	677000	Yeah, true.
677000	683000	And who knows how many DLC characters they're going to do, and if they're going to do any beyond Mewtwo, I guess.
683000	696000	Alright, going to our chatroom again over at live.vognetwork.com, SSG100Matt says, knowing how the internet tends to overreact to stuff like this, I'm not shocked that this guy who made this isn't getting hacked and sent death threats.
696000	703000	Because it's because it was Rayman, and not a lot of people give a shit about Rayman. If it was like Solid Snake or something like that, then maybe.
703000	713000	I don't know, you don't know Extrafer over on, I mean, you do know Extrafer very well over on Hoard House, but I have to hear him talk about Rayman an awful lot. I think he was legit disappointed at the news.
714000	727000	So we'll see. Anyhow, ADFSAD says 4chan is where the entire SSB Wii U roster originally leaked.
727000	741000	So you know it is that whole thing where sometimes, I mean, I guess the, for lack of a better term, heightened anonymity of that forum does lend itself to being, you know, if you're going to go leak some information, that might be the place to do it.
741000	749000	Not that I would ever endorse, but I'm just saying the heightened anonymity makes it probably alluring for people that want to go spill the beans on things, right?
749000	750000	I guess.
750000	751000	Yeah, a little bit.
752000	761000	So let's see, Tigerclaw in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says Rayman in Smash Brothers would make sense because he seems like the type of character that would fit in.
761000	774000	Yeah, I mean, I do agree with that. He's like a platformer. He's kind of the mascot of another company, like you have Sonic for Sega, you have Mega Man, which maybe isn't the mascot for Capcom, but it's definitely one of their most well-known faces.
774000	789000	Rayman would make a lot of sense in the game, except for that whole difficult relationship right now with Ubisoft and Nintendo, we're not really sure, you know, is there good feelings still there, or is there still a lot of, but we did get the trophy.
789000	794000	So, I mean, that shows that there's something going on there. So, anyhow.
795000	806000	And lastly, SSG100Matt says, according to ScrewAttack, Ubisoft is going to make a statement on this hoax on Tuesday. Why would Ubisoft want to make a statement on the hoax?
806000	808000	Because they own Rayman?
808000	820000	I suppose, yeah, but I mean, why would they make an announcement of an announcement? That's weird to me. Why would they say, we're not going to say anything about it today, but we're going to say something about it Tuesday. Is that because the legal department has President's Day off? Is that...
820000	823000	They may be, the whole company may have that day off or something.
823000	824000	Well, yeah, but I mean...
824000	825000	They're being French.
825000	826000	They're being US, but...
826000	827000	I guess.
827000	828000	They're being French.
828000	837000	Alright, I guess we'll chalk it up to that. Alright, we are going to have some of the guys from Star, Mazer, Austin, and Don here momentarily, but we have a few minutes.
837000	846000	So, let's get into our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this week. And before we get into games, I want to address this comment as well.
846000	853000	Akuma JP in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, Rob sounds dry, like something's wrong with my voice tonight.
853000	867000	Yeah, I am a little, my voice is a little bit hoarse tonight because even though I retire, and I've talked about this on the show before, I was hosting cult cinema for many, many years, doing, you know, hosting events and so forth.
867000	877000	Even though I retired in October, I actually ended up hosting a show last night because my successor had a emergency type of scenario come up. I don't want to spill all her details, but she couldn't do it.
877000	886000	So they asked me very nicely, could you please, please, please show up and do this? And I'm like, of course, of course. I'll, you know, if I just have to show up, do my thing and not performing or anything, I'll go.
886000	896000	But since I was yelling, getting a crowd hyped, a crowd of 500 people, nonetheless, my voice is a little hoarse today because I really strained it last night, as I sometimes do at these events.
896000	897000	Nay.
897000	898000	Yeah.
898000	899000	Nay.
899000	900000	There you go.
900000	901000	You're hoarse.
901000	904000	All right. From horses to gaming weeks, Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
904000	905000	Flom.
905000	911000	Flom. Oh, this was the game you talked about last week that your teacher had released on iOS?
912000	929000	Yes. It's a shooter. It can get kind of crazy if you, almost bullet hell moments in there, not like that bad, but really hard to dodge. It's got great music, great graphics in it, and a lot of work went into the game and it's super addicting.
929000	945000	So if people have not gotten it yet, it's F-L-O-M-M. Flom. Go get it on iOS. It's out for iPad and iPhone. Do the thing. Get it because I said so. And I'm trying to get Steve to show up.
945000	956000	Yeah. We are going to try to get him on the show in a future week, right? To give us all the pitch on the game and why we should check it out. The concept sounds really interesting. So I'm peaked. I will tell you that.
956000	977000	It's kind of fun shooting number two pencils and junk mail. So on top of that, I've been playing some Dragon Age. I've been mostly writing Dragon Age because I'm actually five chapters ahead in my thick and people have really wanted to read it. So I'm actually going to be wrapping it up soon.
978000	986000	And I guess I have to play Final Fantasy tonight so I can get hearts from my chicken. Chicken hearts! Yum!
986000	994000	Today's the last day of the Valentine's Day event. Or Valentione or whatever they call it. They changed the name a little bit.
994000	999000	The stuff in the thing that does stuff in things. So yeah.
999000	1005000	Cool. I'm going to break order here a little bit and I'm going to go next so I can set up some other things while Loki does his gaming week.
1005000	1012000	But for my gaming week, I also touched Final Fantasy XIV today which is newsworthy because I actually haven't been playing a lot of it for about two weeks.
1012000	1021000	But I did log in today to do just what Jamie was talking about there to get my Chocobo, the special little Valentine's barding that you can get for the Chocobo. I wanted to do that.
1021000	1029000	I've been playing an awful lot of Diablo III. Season 2 started on Friday. Which if you don't know what the seasons are, it's only on the PC version.
1029000	1035000	It's not on the console version because the console version isn't always online and it's already been hacked and item duped and all that.
1035000	1050000	So in the PC version, which is always online, it allows them to do these more like leaderboard oriented events which the seasons are basically a way you can start a character that will, you know, everybody starts on this day and then the season runs for like three to four months.
1050000	1058000	And you try to get, you know, you can get achievement points to run that. You can try to see what greater rift you can accomplish and what kind of time.
1058000	1067000	There's different like conquests which are just basically like really high level. Think like gold and platinum trophy level achievements that you can achieve in the game.
1067000	1075000	And they're all limited to seasons. And by participating, you get special cosmetic rewards that you only get if you play in that special period.
1075000	1081000	And then the cool thing is any character you make during the season will roll into your general pool when it's over.
1081000	1091000	And any experience that you get on your 70 characters, what they call the paragon experience, everything that's the end game experience, that will roll right into the paragon pool on your general characters.
1091000	1100000	So it's like even though you're taking a side trip to go do this, you know, side character, your efforts will still be permanently felt in the game.
1100000	1106000	And I think it's a really cool little feature on the PC version of the game and it's a real bummer the console people don't get to experience this.
1106000	1112000	Although you do still get all the special loot. They work it into the consoles. It's just all in the general pool.
1112000	1121000	I did promise a new game this week and I did actually ironically with all this discussion we've been having at the top of the show, I picked up a new to me game.
1121000	1125000	This game's actually been out like for probably like a year and a half but I finally picked this up.
1125000	1126000	It was about a year actually.
1126000	1131000	It was about a year. Well it was only $10 on PlayStation thanks to the Flash sale.
1131000	1139000	So I picked up Rayman Legends which I'd only really played the little Wii U experience that they had before so I hadn't really played the full game.
1139000	1149000	So I've been playing a little bit of this and you know that Xtifer over on Hoard House, he loves this series and he's friendly, pressured me a lot to play this game on and off.
1149000	1156000	So I finally got a chance to check it out and it's a pretty solid platformer that gives a lot to come back to.
1156000	1167000	You know in the levels you're trying to collect these little critters. You want to collect as many like, they're not gold but they're looms I think they're called.
1167000	1175000	Like lit up bugs or something. You're trying to collect as many of those as you can in a level and depending on how many you collect is what kind of trophy you'll get at the end of the level.
1175000	1184000	And if you get a good enough trophy you get more unlocks. So it's like there's a lot of stuff that kind of like, a lot of little achievements to go for in the game that will unlock things.
1184000	1189000	And that's what people really like about platformers I think so that's kind of what gives Rayman a lot of legs.
1189000	1194000	And the fact that you can go online and you have these daily and weekly challenges that are there as well.
1194000	1201000	So there's a lot kind of to look for in the game. So I've been having fun just you know, I'm going to try to do what I can do on this level and this level.
1201000	1211000	But the only problem is then I get a little bit of gaming OCD that takes over and it's like, oh my god I missed one bug in that level.
1211000	1215000	I've got to go back and play the whole damn thing over again so I can get that one bug.
1215000	1219000	And so that can cause my progress to be very very slow.
1219000	1226000	But I've been having fun with the game. It is a lot of fun. It's a great platformer and I see why Extrovert is really into it.
1226000	1229000	So I'll probably be playing more of that in the coming weeks.
1230000	1235000	So that was pretty much it for my gaming week. Loki, last but not least, how about you?
1235000	1241000	Well I played Besiege this week. I actually picked that up because I saw a trailer for it and it looked funny.
1241000	1252000	It's, if you haven't heard of it, it's a game where you build machines out of parts and then you try to lay waste to medieval environments.
1252000	1267000	So each level has a goal, like you can drive to this one spot and you get there without hidden mines or destroy this part of a castle or destroy an army or something like that.
1267000	1272000	But you have to build these machines in order to do that and it's a lot harder than it sounds.
1272000	1275000	But it's also a lot more hilarious as well.
1275000	1279000	So there's a ton of YouTube videos out there for it. It's going to be pretty popular.
1279000	1288000	It's on Steam Early Access right now because, I don't know, there's just a lot of popularity with people making videos about machines and stuff that they've created and everything.
1288000	1293000	So I played that. I played a little bit of LEGO Marvel Super Heroes because my son wanted to.
1293000	1299000	And what else? I think it mostly just worked on my game.
1299000	1306000	So now I have to the point now where I have the first level pretty much done and I'm ready to start more levels.
1306000	1313000	I got all the framework stuff done. The only thing I'm really missing is a pause menu and some of the options screens and stuff like that.
1313000	1320000	But for the most part the game is functional so I just have to make levels for it now, which is the best part.
1320000	1323000	I can't wait to check out your game. I'm so excited.
1323000	1329000	I'm glad this VoG Jam is still kind of keep on going here because I still have to get around to those videos.
1329000	1338000	I have to add trees and stuff to the maps I have and that kind of thing. So just a lot of polish and level making.
1338000	1345000	Alright. Well we are going to go here to our interview tonight. I'm very excited to welcome these guys on the show.
1345000	1351000	We're going to be talking with Dawn who is the designer, writer, and director.
1351000	1356000	And then we're also going to talk with Austin who is one of the game developers on this game, Star Maser.
1356000	1367000	And Star Maser is on Kickstarter right now and it's a point and click adventure, part shoot-em-up, but it's not two games in one.
1367000	1370000	It's a blend of these two game genres.
1370000	1377000	So we're going to get these guys on the line because I can sit here and talk about it, but I think these guys will be able to talk to us much better about this game.
1377000	1383000	So we're going to give them a call right now live here on the air here on Orange Lounge Radio.
1383000	1389000	We are calling them up on Skype right now, Dawn and Austin with Star Maser.
1389000	1395000	And I think we have somebody there. Is that Dawn? Oh, Dawn and Austin are both there in the same room. Hi guys.
1395000	1399000	How's it going? Hello, can you hear me?
1399000	1402000	Standby.
1402000	1405000	Hi guys, you're live on Orange Lounge Radio.
1405000	1408000	What's up you guys? We've got technology from the future.
1408000	1410000	There you are. Hi.
1410000	1411000	Hi, how's it going?
1411000	1412000	Great, you can hear us and see us.
1412000	1419000	Yes, we can hear you and see you. I apologize we don't have video, but it's only a radio show over here at OLR, so we just have the audio.
1419000	1423000	Great, that's alright. We did all this awesome setup. We look great right now, I have to tell you.
1423000	1425000	I just want to use it at the end.
1425000	1427000	You guys look fantastic.
1427000	1433000	Well, if you guys want, I'm sorry, one second, there's a bit of like, are we taping this? Is that a thing?
1433000	1434000	You want me to tape it?
1434000	1435000	Yeah, go for it, and then it'll justify the video.
1435000	1439000	Sorry guys, let's go ahead and get started. I apologize for the technical difficulty.
1439000	1445000	That's okay, you guys are actually live on our show here at Orange Lounge Radio, broadcasting at vognetwork.com right now.
1445000	1449000	But let's talk a little bit about Star Mazer.
1449000	1454000	So, I've been trying to explain to people what Star Mazer is all about, but you guys are really the minds behind the game.
1454000	1457000	Tell us, what is Star Mazer?
1457000	1460000	Star Mazer is a retro, sexy, pointy, cooky, adventure, snuff game.
1460000	1463000	That's the fastest way to say it, but what does that mean?
1463000	1467000	Star Mazer is a storytelling game. It takes place in the far future.
1467000	1477000	It is a unique blend of mechanics from two seemingly disparate game types into a new and unique genre.
1477000	1487000	It is a game about replayability, a game about story discovery, and a game about flying cool ships through space.
1487000	1491000	Why point and click and shoot them up?
1491000	1499000	What was it about those two genres where you were like, yes, they need to get married and have this game?
1499000	1507000	One of them is an amazing action mechanic that tends to crap the bed when it comes to story.
1507000	1513000	Tell me the story of Ikaruga. It does not exist. Shoot the aliens.
1513000	1522000	The other is a highly story-based game type which tends to ignore action and mechanical fun.
1522000	1528000	When they do implement it, it tends to be kind of janky and weird and kind of tacked on when I was younger.
1528000	1533000	I guess the shortest answer is because I played those games the most when I was a kid.
1533000	1537000	When I thought about making games, those are the two game types I wanted to make.
1537000	1546000	But instead of making two disparate games with missing parts, I would rather make one game that uses the best parts of other games to make a new game type.
1546000	1556000	Awesome. If you guys want to ask questions of Don or Austin from Star Maser, you can join us in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
1556000	1561000	Dungeon Buster is in our chat room and says, love the pixel art already, looks great.
1561000	1567000	I got to say, this is one of the first things I noticed about the game. The pixel art is very detailed.
1567000	1572000	There's a lot of love for it all over the Kickstarter page with all these little animated sprites and so forth.
1572000	1577000	What is it about this pixel art style that is necessary for this game?
1577000	1584000	I want to answer that question. This is Don, by the way. I'm sorry that I'm not letting you ask the talk. I'll let him talk in a moment.
1585000	1590000	Right now he's still chained to the wall. Just kidding.
1590000	1598000	There are two distinct reasons. The first is nostalgia. I'm making the game I wanted to make when I was nine.
1598000	1608000	When I was nine, games looked a certain way and we wanted to extend or expand the idea of what games looked like back then as opposed to stay slavishly to them.
1608000	1614000	We wanted to get past their limitations. We wanted to create a game that looks like what I thought games looked like.
1614000	1622000	I recently started playing Four Star Mazer, in fact, one of my favorite games of all time, which is called Gate of Thunder for the Turbo Graphics CD system.
1622000	1625000	It's a great game. It's one of the best shmups ever made.
1625000	1628000	Dark Soccer here at OLR is a big fan of that.
1628000	1635000	Awesome. Well, here's the trick. I remember it looking a lot better than it looked, and it looks incredible.
1635000	1646000	But in my brain, my nine-year-old version of myself made the animated intro in the beginning with four frames of animation.
1646000	1651000	I had a whole anime in my head when I remembered that game. I wanted to make that game.
1651000	1655000	I wanted to make the game that I remember playing when I was much younger.
1655000	1658000	So that's element number one, nostalgia.
1658000	1663000	Amigo Softworks, my company, our tagline is nostalgia in HD.
1663000	1669000	We want to bring to life the fantasies that you played when you were younger.
1669000	1674000	Not repeat them, but make them feel like they felt when you were younger.
1674000	1675000	So nostalgia is number one.
1676000	1678000	Number two, though, is an exploration of art.
1678000	1682000	So pixel art was an art form of necessity back in the day.
1682000	1683000	Sprites had to be a certain way.
1683000	1693000	In fact, the entire look of a whole new form of art was formed because some people had a 16x16 grid to create all kinds of expression with.
1693000	1697000	I find that fascinating. I like art by limitation.
1697000	1704000	Our actual game frame is limited and requires all kinds of innovative sprite use.
1704000	1710000	Some elements of our main character are one pixel wide if you take away the border.
1710000	1713000	So that's on purpose.
1713000	1724000	We want to express art that was born of limitation rather than just adhere to limitation.
1725000	1728000	Mega Man, the blue bomber is blue because of a limitation of the NES.
1728000	1737000	Inafune said a number of times that he wanted Mega Man to be red, but the NES could produce three shades of blue and only one shade of red.
1737000	1738000	So red and orange.
1738000	1745000	So the blue bomber, the famous, I'm looking right now, I have an entire wall with vinyl cutouts of Mega Man sprites.
1746000	1753000	I know our listeners can't see you guys, but you have a pillow right behind you that looks like it has a giant Mega Man on it.
1753000	1758000	I've got a Mega Man style Judge Dredd on a pillow.
1758000	1762000	We're sitting on a quilt that's like a Mega Buster back there.
1762000	1763000	I'm a giant Mega Man fan.
1763000	1767000	That's why we have Manami Matsumae as one of our composers for the game.
1767000	1771000	She's the original sound and composer for the original Mega Man.
1771000	1773000	But what I'm saying is there were challenges and limitations.
1773000	1775000	Chip tunes are really popular right now.
1775000	1776000	That's ridiculous.
1776000	1779000	It's only ridiculous if you take out the art though, right?
1779000	1781000	Technically, that's dumb.
1781000	1786000	That's like banging two pots and pans together is a new genre of music because that's all we have.
1786000	1788000	But that's not really the truth.
1788000	1800000	Chip tunes of today, chip artists of today are creating new and unique flavors of music that could not possibly exist without all of the groundwork laid by people who are making music with limitation.
1800000	1803000	The people who made the original chip tunes weren't making chip tunes.
1803000	1807000	They were making orchestral pieces with massive limitations.
1807000	1813000	Right now, chip tunes artists make chip tunes by exploring chip tunes as its own art form.
1813000	1818000	We're exploring pixels in that same way with our art.
1818000	1819000	I love chip tunes.
1819000	1823000	But banging pots and pans together, come on, it's not dubstep.
1823000	1824000	Come on.
1824000	1825000	Let's be a little fair here.
1825000	1826000	No, I'm kidding.
1826000	1827000	I'm kidding.
1828000	1830000	No, dubstep is a dial-up modem.
1830000	1831000	That's true, that's true.
1831000	1834000	Austin, you've been sitting there so patiently while we've been talking to Don.
1834000	1835000	Austin, I got a question for you.
1835000	1848000	So you are the game designer on this game and one thing that caught my eye as I was looking through the Kickstarter was you guys have a system called OMG or open middled gameplay.
1848000	1850000	What is this OMG about?
1850000	1855000	So the OMG system is the open middled gameplay of Star Mazer.
1856000	1864000	The easiest way to explain this is it's like a season from your favorite TV show except in the game you can watch the episodes in a different order.
1864000	1871000	And by doing that, it will change the outcome because there's this cascading effect of all the things that happened in the beginning throughout the story.
1871000	1877000	So the way we're actually implementing that is that Star Mazer can start in one of a few possible scenarios.
1877000	1882000	And it will have a few satisfying endings based off of the events that are taking place in the game.
1882000	1892000	But as far as everything in the middle, we don't know exactly how that's going to go because we're designing the world and we're implementing the code of the game so that all the characters represent their worldview.
1892000	1903000	It is very popular for games that have consequences and choice to have this world state where your actions are rated on a scale of good to bad or lawful to chaotic.
1903000	1912000	And we really don't like that idea because it takes a very complex idea and breaks it down into a definable system.
1912000	1919000	Games as a simulation do that, but we're making games in the year 2015, not in the year 1985.
1919000	1924000	So we have a lot of power to be able to make very interesting simulations.
1924000	1928000	So the way we're building characters is that they see the world from their own worldview.
1928000	1935000	When you communicate with a character, all these other events could have gone on, but they only care about what they know, what they've seen, and what they've heard of your actions.
1935000	1944000	So when you're interacting with characters, if you're an amazing pilot because you've been doing great as you fly your Star Wolf, then they're either going to give you respect because maybe they think pilots are cool.
1944000	1948000	Maybe they'll be afraid or jealous of you because they're a fighter pilot themselves.
1948000	1953000	Or maybe they don't give a damn how great you are flying because you need to pay them some money and you haven't paid them money.
1954000	1963000	So what's interesting is that we're recording all these things, and those interactions between characters, we don't specify exactly how they're going to happen in the playthrough that you go into.
1963000	1965000	That's a whole episode in a different order.
1965000	1972000	You might encounter a great space pilot early on in the game, but in your next run-through it could happen at the end.
1972000	1979000	The thing is, your interactions with that space pilot will then create more events that other characters in the world hear about that change how they interact with you.
1979000	1994000	So the real innovation of Star Mesa, the thing that's going to set it beyond just being an interesting combination of mechanics, is the open middle gameplay where you can play through this game over and over again.
1994000	2001000	It's always a new experience, and it's always a new way to play through and learn how to be a hero, which is the core message of Star Mesa.
2002000	2017000	I think it's a really cool sounding idea. Obviously we have companies that make these very episodic games, they're very well known for it like Telltale, but it's like, what if you played a series like The Walking Dead but it was in a different order?
2017000	2028000	That could change everything completely, so this sounds very ambitious, and I think it's a really cool little twist, especially for something that is kind of rooted in retro in a way. I think it's really cool.
2028000	2043000	An important note though is that the game isn't released in episodes, the game is released in a season, so you get all the episodes and more episodes than you get in one playthrough all at the same time, whereas like a Telltale game, you get an episode at a time. That's kind of the thing.
2043000	2044000	Good call out.
2044000	2052000	Excellent. Well let's talk a little bit about Kickstarter, because you guys are in the last five days of your Kickstarter campaign.
2052000	2054000	Yes we are.
2054000	2071000	Kickstarter URLs are very long, they're a little hard for me to give out here on the show, but if you head over to the website StarMaser.com, that's S-T-A-R-R-M-A-Z-E-R.com, there's a link right there to the Kickstarter if you want to check that out.
2071000	2086000	It looks like you guys are definitely within striking distance of meeting that goal, and I really do hope you guys do meet that goal, but here's your chance with our listening audience and so forth. Why should we consider giving money to this project?
2087000	2095000	So why don't you get all the highfalutin, high-minded art and theory versions, and I'll give the Selly version.
2095000	2102000	So yeah, the real exciting thing behind StarMaser is that we have an opportunity, we've got a team that can build a game that...
2102000	2110000	It's the game that you remember playing as a child, but it's actually that good right now.
2110000	2118000	That whole aspect of that, like we remember how great those games were back then, you know, flying through the smoke sections, or interacting with those cool narratives.
2118000	2122000	But if you play those games back today, they're not that good.
2122000	2128000	And the implementation of the OMG system is something that games have been trying to do for...
2128000	2137000	In various degrees, games have been trying, or skirting with the idea, but have not fully achieved. The closest example is Shadow of Mordor, which did a great job at it.
2137000	2146000	And we actually discussed our systems of how we're doing the OMG to the Shadow of Mordor team, and it's very similar to how we're doing things.
2146000	2151000	But we have a different goal, we're giving a different experience, so we have the opportunity to actually build this system.
2151000	2162000	And so if you want to see an advancement in game narrative to an actual interactive state, as opposed to going through a linear experience, which is great when you get a lot of games.
2162000	2170000	That is the thing that we are really setting out to build. That is the new experience that if you fund this game, we will be providing.
2170000	2178000	That's incredible. We're going to be on the cutting edge. You can be somebody who supported the weather change in video games forever.
2178000	2188000	If you had the option to back The Walking Dead as a telltale game and then set the change for narrative games a few years ago, and you could be a part of that, that would be really awesome.
2188000	2196000	Because then you would be part of the people that made telltale-like games, which is a genre now that other companies are doing.
2196000	2207000	Star Mazer is the next logical evolution in that idea of gameplay. I am very familiar with The Walking Dead series, it's inspired me, I've been thinking about it a lot over the past few years.
2207000	2218000	And Dawn's ideas that come from a different angle have really merged together to enable us to finally find the next step in that sort of line of engaging narrative games.
2218000	2227000	That is awesome. I agree with that. Our game looks pretty. To get it on Kickstarter, you get it for five bucks off.
2227000	2236000	Right? It's going to retail at least twenty bucks. Our lowest tier is fifteen bucks. That's five bucks off. That's twenty-five percent off. That's amazing.
2236000	2247000	The soundtrack is incredible. I don't know if you've noticed, but not only do we have legendary chip music artist Alex Maurer as our lead composer and also one of the owners of Amigo Softworks, my company,
2248000	2259000	he's also enlisted the help of over twenty-five other amazing musical artists. The Protomen are on board. Like I mentioned earlier, Manami Matsumae is on board.
2262000	2269000	Vert. Vert from Shovel Knight. There are so many. Saber Bolt. Saber Bolt. Play of X. Fighting. A-Rival. A-Rival. Arcade Heart.
2270000	2280000	It takes more than a page to scroll through it. It's incredible. The only way we'll get there is to break our first stretch goal, which is $180,000.
2280000	2288000	So we need your help. We need your help to get there. That's super important. MegaRan is going to be in the game as an NPC who is going to be fully voiced by MegaRan himself.
2288000	2294000	And who knows if he can spit some rhymes during the game. That'd be cool. It's incredible.
2294000	2300000	Some people get a taste of the soundtrack here. We actually have a little clip that we grabbed from the Kickstarter page of what that sounds like.
2300000	2303000	You can hear a little bit of this chiptune theme here.
2307000	2313000	You definitely hear some of the retro goodness there in the Star Mazer theme. And if you want to hear more of that, it's over on the Kickstarter page.
2313000	2322000	But I was actually going to ask. You're sitting there basically spouting off a lot of the artists that make up the playlist here at Vodka Network.
2322000	2327000	I mean, we love a lot of these guys. How did you get them all together for this?
2327000	2332000	I'm about to say the most arrogant thing I think I've ever said in my whole life.
2332000	2333000	Please.
2333000	2335000	I presented them Star Mazer.
2337000	2341000	I did it. I did that thing. No, here's the trick. Here's the trick. Okay, so there's this thing.
2341000	2353000	There's a filmmaker who said, how do you go from being a video store clerk to one of the most lauded filmmakers of all time?
2353000	2361000	And the filmmaker looks directly at the interview and says, you make reservoir dogs. That was his answer.
2361000	2366000	And that always sat really dark with me. Because there's probably a lot that went into making reservoir dogs.
2366000	2369000	You don't just snap your fingers and reservoir dogs come out.
2369000	2377000	But I've been asked the same question you just asked. I know so many times, and what I come to isn't, you be a badass and make Star Mazer.
2377000	2382000	That's the funny, jokey answer. The truth is, you have nine people who work really hard on a thing.
2382000	2392000	You have a provably committed team of artists working together to make a thing, spearheaded by Alex Maher, the music side at least.
2392000	2396000	Spearheaded by Alex Maher, who is again legendary. People want to work with that guy.
2396000	2401000	Show them the video, the count video that we put together. Show them the work that we've done so far.
2401000	2405000	Show them the documents. Show them the character designs. Show them all this neat stuff.
2405000	2411000	It becomes hard to resist if you've got the time and you've got the interest in this kind of thing.
2411000	2415000	Something that a lot of people are committing themselves to very deeply and truly.
2415000	2420000	So the short, jokey answer is, you make Star Mazer. That's how.
2420000	2425000	But the actual reason is, you work really hard on something that a lot of people can get behind.
2425000	2431000	If you look at all the others, not a single one of those artists is a random guy from the street or like John Williams.
2431000	2434000	I don't know that John Williams would want to be part of Star Mazer.
2434000	2439000	I know Manami Matsumae, who I would consider the John Williams of video games, is interested.
2439000	2445000	Her first answer was, it looks a lot like UN Squadron. And she's really missed doing games like that.
2445000	2447000	So that's a really good answer, right?
2447000	2448000	That's awesome.
2448000	2450000	We've got all kinds of different answers from all kinds of different folks.
2450000	2453000	But all of them engaged with Star Mazer at the same level.
2453000	2459000	We think that our backers, nearly 4,000 of them at this point, engage with the idea.
2459000	2461000	We hope to spread that idea.
2461000	2466000	Right now we're having a reach problem, not an engagement problem.
2466000	2469000	Right now, we have conversions.
2469000	2476000	Kickstarter gives you these weird stats that don't always hash out because their statistical analysis doesn't include, whatever, math.
2476000	2483000	But what you come to is you realize that we are getting a conversion rate of around 40%, which is baffling.
2483000	2486000	10% is normally like pie in the sky high.
2486000	2493000	So the fact that 40% of the people who see Star Mazer buy Star Mazer immediately are pledged to the system.
2493000	2500000	And our average pledge is nearly twice as high as normal average pledges, I've found.
2500000	2506000	Which is pretty great for people in our bracket who offer tiers lower than that.
2506000	2511000	Our average bid is pretty high, which is pretty incredible.
2511000	2513000	People love the game when they know about it.
2513000	2520000	So something like being on your radio show or knowing people who can spread the word is super important for us.
2520000	2522000	So thank you very much.
2522000	2527000	I would like to point out, all of those artists are being integrated in an individual way.
2527000	2529000	We're not just going to say, make a thing and do a thing.
2529000	2533000	The proto-men have a totally different impact on the game than, say, Arcade High.
2533000	2537000	Both of those have special things planned for each one of these artists.
2537000	2540000	So that probably helped getting them on board as well.
2540000	2543000	Instead of just saying, hey brah, want to do a thing for game brah?
2543000	2546000	We came to them and said, listen, we have a really cool idea.
2546000	2548000	The idea with Arcade High is incredible.
2548000	2551000	The idea with MegaRan's character is incredible.
2551000	2557000	So yeah, I think having a fully fleshed out idea that a lot of people are already behind because it has some form of merit,
2557000	2560000	that's probably the easiest way to get them involved.
2560000	2564000	Well, we are happy to help out by helping to spread the word.
2564000	2567000	And yeah, I was actually talking with our voiceover guy before the show.
2567000	2570000	And he had checked out your campaign because he saw that you guys were coming on the show tonight.
2570000	2573000	And he was like, that looks awesome. I just backed it.
2573000	2575000	So there you go. We know we got at least one.
2575000	2577000	Nice. Thank you. Thank you very much.
2577000	2583000	I want to at least, I don't want to keep you guys too long because I know you guys, of course, are busy trying to get the word out and so forth.
2583000	2587000	I want to get to at least like one or two questions from our chatters over at live.vognetwork.com.
2587000	2594000	Let me get a question here from Tigerclaw who asks, with a title like Starmazer, is a maze involved?
2594000	2598000	Can you ask the question again? It got kind of garbled.
2598000	2604000	Sure. No problem. Tigerclaw on our chat, I'm asking, with a title like Starmazer, is a maze involved in the game?
2605000	2612000	No. A maser, so yeah, I can't say no. I'm sure there's going to be maze-like things at some point.
2612000	2616000	There are navigation things that have to do with your ship and the flying sector.
2616000	2627000	Navigation has to happen. But a maser, M-A-S-E-R, is any device that emits radioelectric or thermoelectric energy.
2627000	2633000	So a great example of a maser is a laser. A laser is a subclass of maser.
2633000	2640000	But when I came up with the story, I was nine, so Zs were way cooler than Ss.
2640000	2647000	In our game, the Starmazer is this giant ultimate weapon that everybody, including Brick, is after.
2647000	2651000	Brick is the main character of our story, by the way. Brick M. Stonewood. The M stands for metal.
2652000	2660000	I would have thought that maybe the maze was part of that, maybe the storytelling a little bit, because it's never going to be the same.
2660000	2662000	I thought maybe that was a way to look at it.
2662000	2664000	Totally. Yeah, totally.
2664000	2666000	I like your answer too.
2666000	2671000	No, no, that's great. I think we're going to say that from now on. We will not distribute you. That's our idea.
2671000	2677000	Actually, the open middle gameplay provides a labyrinthine storytelling device, a maze-like method.
2677000	2681000	We're calling all of our little game units story mazes.
2681000	2683000	Story mazes?
2683000	2685000	That's very cool.
2685000	2687000	Do I get a credit for that?
2687000	2691000	No, I'm going to call it Minotaur.
2691000	2695000	One more question here from chat. Triptide asks,
2695000	2705000	Is there a way to, as an already backer of the project, continue funding the game after the Kickstarter and still up our pledges for a limited period of time?
2706000	2708000	A lot of games try to do so.
2708000	2710000	I think we're probably going to do add-ons.
2710000	2713000	By the way, Triptide is somebody we know.
2713000	2726000	Hi, Triptide. We don't know him personally, but we actually have, at starmazer.tv, we have a Twitch show every day during the campaign that culminates in a 24-hour Twitchstravaganza.
2726000	2729000	We have a pizza party and live music and all this kind of stuff.
2729000	2735000	That's at the last day of our campaign. This Friday through Saturday. Friday at 10 AM PST, all the way through Saturday at 10 AM PST.
2735000	2740000	But anyway, Triptide has been on watching that show almost every day since we started it.
2740000	2742000	So he's kind of sneaking in an extra question.
2742000	2744000	Which is really great.
2744000	2748000	Add-ons are a thing we're going to try to do. We're still working out the details for them though.
2748000	2751000	That's one of the things people don't really talk about when they do their campaign.
2751000	2754000	And I'm sure we're going to do a Kickstarter post-mortem or something.
2754000	2759000	But there's a lot of information that's not available. Like, hey, how do you handle add-ons?
2759000	2763000	We don't just click an add-on button. There's a whole big process that you have to go through.
2763000	2766000	So we're working on it. We'll definitely announce something soon.
2766000	2775000	Alright, awesome. Now I have one more question that may not be as serious, but it's one of those things that when you notice it, you have to ask.
2775000	2776000	So this is a question for Austin.
2776000	2779000	I'm leaving my pants on. My pants are staying on.
2779000	2780000	It's not that kind of show.
2780000	2789000	Austin, this is a question for you. I couldn't help but notice, over at starmazer.com, on your profile, there's a little DDR arrow in the picture.
2789000	2796000	And your Twitter name, 2DX. Do you have a Bamani history like this show does?
2796000	2800000	Oh, that's easy! That's so good!
2800000	2808000	I was thinking that Orange Lounge that you guys were referencing that musician, so I was really stoked about that.
2808000	2814000	So yes, actually, I run a company, I'm co-founder of a company called 2DX.
2814000	2818000	But it's T-O-O-D-X, as in an excessive amount of deluxe.
2818000	2823000	It is absolutely inspired by BeatMania 2DX, which is one of my favorite games of all time.
2823000	2827000	I love the difficulty of it. I play one-handed. I just recently did two mods.
2827000	2829000	Whatever, I'm not very great at it, but it's because it's super hard.
2829000	2837000	But yes, it is a triple entendre. I'll let you figure out the other ones, because some of them I don't want to say out on public radio.
2837000	2844000	But yes, I grew up playing a lot of music games. BeatMania 2DX was the first Japanese game I imported.
2844000	2851000	It's a huge aspect of mine, so I am so glad that you guys are representing that.
2851000	2854000	Some of my favorite songs at BeatMania.
2854000	2857000	We all met playing Dance Dance Revolution at Roseville Golf Land.
2857000	2863000	Dark Sakura used to be a mod on DDR Freak. This show's been going for 13 years, believe it or not.
2864000	2868000	Longest running video game podcast. So there it is, born of the DDR community.
2868000	2869000	That's so cool.
2869000	2871000	RIP DDR Freak.
2871000	2872000	What's that?
2872000	2875000	I've never legitimately played DDR.
2875000	2876000	What?
2876000	2877000	Gasp.
2877000	2881000	Don't worry, I'm going to fix this. I just found this out. I will fix this as soon as possible.
2881000	2883000	Don't you have a new stretch goal?
2883000	2885000	You have a 24-hour stream coming up, right?
2886000	2892000	If you have a 24-hour stream coming up, I think some DDR has to happen in that.
2892000	2893000	I think that's got to be a thing that happens.
2893000	2894000	24 hours of butterfly.
2894000	2897000	I am so down for the best fit on DDR.
2897000	2898000	Alright, there it is.
2898000	2906000	Now, if you weren't already considering this, StarMazer, now you know this is part of the Bamadi family here from many, many years ago. I love this.
2906000	2910000	Anyhow, I want to thank you guys for being on the show this week.
2910000	2913000	One more quick question for you guys, because we always ask all our guests this.
2913000	2921000	Besides StarMazer and other things that you are directly involved with, what type of video games are you playing right now?
2921000	2922000	Don?
2925000	2930000	Okay, so I'm working a lot, so I'm not able to play a bunch.
2930000	2938000	For StarMazer specifically, and I'll get to your question directly, but for StarMazer specifically, I'm playing a lot of old-school swaps and adventure games.
2938000	2943000	I just got Loom for my Turbo Duo, which I'm going to dig into pretty soon here, because I remember loving that game a lot.
2943000	2954000	So I've been doing that a lot, but that said, I've been playing, I guess it's because it's portable, and if I have time then I can sit down.
2954000	2955000	I normally am just doing work.
2955000	2963000	I've been playing my Vita a lot, and I think most recently I just finished Hotline Miami, the original.
2963000	2973000	I was able to play a little bit of Hotline Miami 2 behind closed doors recently, and I fell in love with it and got to playing Hotline Miami.
2973000	2982000	So I'm playing that a lot. I'm in my third playthrough of SteamWorld Dig, and I don't know why.
2982000	2985000	There's something unbelievably addictive about that game. I really love it.
2985000	2987000	That is an addictive game. It's a lot of fun.
2987000	2989000	It is a very addictive game.
2989000	2996000	And then for consoles, I'm stuck in Alien Isolation. I want to spend time playing it at some point.
2996000	3006000	And I got a buddy who plays Call of Duty, so I've been playing Call of Duty Advanced, whatever newest bro game, a lot too.
3006000	3011000	But I don't know that I'm super into that outside of the experience of playing it with my friend.
3011000	3016000	Which, by the way, is a good way to consider if you're not into Call of Duty, that's a great merit for Call of Duty.
3016000	3021000	It's one of the few of those types of games you can actually split screen, so you can have couch co-op against. It's just pretty fun.
3021000	3025000	So that's the truth of it. I wish I had a really cool answer, but I'm mostly working.
3025000	3028000	I understand. Austin, what about you?
3028000	3037000	So the most recent game I dove into was the demo that was released for Read Only Memories, which is a point-and-click adventure inspired by Snatcher.
3037000	3041000	So it's been an inspiration for me working on Star Mazer, but I just absolutely love it.
3041000	3048000	It's a very engrossing storyline, the character's really great, the art is beautiful. So that was the most one I dove into.
3048000	3055000	Recently I stole a few minutes away and played a game jam game called Apocalypse Gardening, which feels like it was made by Vlambeer.
3055000	3061000	It's got this amazing balance of shooting and growing. You can find that on the internet somewhere, so I highly recommend that.
3061000	3068000	And the game I am most excited to play as soon as we get funded, and I have a few minutes, is going to be Life is Strange.
3068000	3072000	Because people have been talking about it a lot, it sounds a lot like a game I want to build.
3072000	3077000	He's not lying, he actually made me download it. It's sitting on our Xbox right now.
3077000	3083000	And then we worked and it got late and I fell asleep, so I'm excited to play that soon. That's my list.
3083000	3085000	That's awesome.
3085000	3087000	Life is Strange is in my queue right now.
3087000	3094000	We just had Matt Kahn on the show about four months ago talking about Read Only Memories when they were running the Kickstarter, so I think he'd appreciate the chat out there.
3094000	3096000	Oh cool, you know Matt? He's super nice.
3096000	3097000	Yeah, it's awesome.
3097000	3104000	And by the way, I will have you know the chatters right now. I know you can't see them in chat, but they are lighting up on this DDR thing.
3104000	3109000	And Dartesuya did not expect the interview to go down this road.
3109000	3114000	Jason's saying, I'm so glad Sky asked this question, I noticed the exact same thing.
3114000	3121000	Fuzzy Ski saying, I will make Don play DDR while dressed as Zangief.
3121000	3124000	Yeah, I'm going to have a Zangief thing going on.
3124000	3125000	I can kind of see it.
3125000	3131000	He could be here on Friday or one of the days during the 24 hour show, so he probably will course me.
3131000	3139000	That's amazing. You guys have been a lot of fun to have on the show. I've kept you way over time, but thank you for spending time with us here tonight at Orange Lawn Radio.
3139000	3148000	Again, the Kickstarter is in its last few days, so if you're hearing this show throughout the week or live tonight or via the podcast feed sometime this week,
3148000	3155000	check it out over at StarMaser.com. That's S-T-A-R-R Maser, M-A-Z-E-R dot com.
3155000	3162000	And pulling for you guys, really hope to see you guys make it. I would like to play this game myself, so rooting for you guys.
3162000	3163000	Thank you so much.
3163000	3164000	We would like to make it for you.
3164000	3168000	Alright, here's hoping. Well, thank you guys for taking the time out and best of luck.
3168000	3170000	Thank you. Bye.
3170000	3174000	Hope to follow up with you on release day. Alright, take care guys.
3174000	3175000	Let's do it.
3175000	3176000	Thanks.
3176000	3180000	That again was Austin and Dawn from StarMaser.
3180000	3181000	They're cool.
3181000	3185000	Yeah, they were fun. Isn't that funny? And they're talking in chat, like Jason says,
3185000	3192000	DDR2DX, Bamani, read only memories. Austin has a lot of overlap with OLR's key tenants. Isn't that funny?
3192000	3195000	The internet's a big place. The internet's a big place.
3195000	3196000	And yet so small.
3196000	3201000	I know, and yet so small. We're all gamers. Darn it. At the end of the day, alright.
3201000	3207000	Anyhow, I'm very happy to talk to them, and I notice their game's a big deal.
3207000	3210000	They brought a lot of people into our chat room tonight, so welcome.
3210000	3217000	Welcome to Orange Lawn Radio. As I mentioned, we all met playing Dance Dance Revolution at an arcade 13 years ago.
3217000	3224000	We started this show, and after we would play games at the arcade, we used to go to a little diner in the parking lot of Roseville Golf Land
3224000	3228000	and talk shit about our favorite thing, video games. And here's what we're still doing.
3228000	3229000	We need to do that again soon.
3229000	3230000	We're still doing it.
3230000	3232000	We have an OLR live from Brookfield.
3232000	3239000	We're still doing it with all you guys here, 13 laters, but now our table is virtual, and all you guys get to come sit at the table,
3239000	3245000	and we give everybody a voice through email, through our Skype line later in the show. We'll take some live calls.
3245000	3251000	And you can be on the show just like Don and Austin were, Twitter, forums, everything.
3251000	3252000	Oh my god, I just had a thought.
3252000	3253000	What's that?
3253000	3260000	What if actual OLRCon is just everyone going to Roseville Golf Land and then taking over Brookfield?
3260000	3262000	You know, you talk about this OLRCon.
3262000	3264000	How many in your party? 200.
3264000	3266000	200. All right.
3266000	3269000	How many in your party? Everyone.
3269000	3274000	All right, well, best of luck to those guys over at Star Maser, but we do still have plenty of show coming up for you guys.
3274000	3278000	We want to get through what's going on in the weekend news. Some quick housekeeping for you guys.
3278000	3285000	There will be no show while PAX East is going on, which is like March 7th. I don't remember the date off the top of my head.
3285000	3293000	Maybe March 8th, but there will be no show that day. I will be out at PAX East in Boston, and I believe we're going to have a thread on the forums.
3293000	3298000	I think Hit Stone was going to start something. If you are going to be at PAX East, please visit our forums.
3298000	3304000	We're hoping to do like a VOG meetup at some point during the convention. We'd love to just meet up with some fans.
3304000	3309000	I get in an unofficial capacity. I get to talk to you guys and talk some smack about games.
3309000	3315000	Maybe play some 3DS or go visit the classic gaming display because it's one of my favorite things at PAX.
3315000	3321000	Check that out. But sadly, because I will be there, there will be no OLR that weekend.
3321000	3326000	There you go. Follow us on Twitter. Twitter.com slash OLR.
3326000	3330000	We're also on Facebook. Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio and on Google Plus.
3330000	3339000	Google.com slash Plus OrangeLoungeRadio where we'll be asking the FUGL question of the week a little later on inspired by our interview tonight, StarMazer.
3339000	3344000	Let's get into some news. Quite a bit of it this week. Let's get to it. Loki, starting us off tonight with the news.
3344000	3345000	For a change.
3345000	3346000	Yeah, for a change.
3346000	3353000	So a new challenger arises in Bethesda, actually doing a press conference at E3.
3353000	3363000	And they put out a notice basically saying, hey, we're going to be here and it's going to be on the 14th it looks like.
3363000	3370000	So what could they possibly be announcing or showing off? Obviously something really big.
3370000	3375000	Fallout 4 maybe? Dishonored 2? Something we haven't heard about yet?
3375000	3376000	Yeah.
3376000	3378000	Maybe another Star Trek game?
3378000	3385000	Well, their little Team Fortress-esque game that they showed at last E3 I don't believe has come out.
3385000	3391000	So there could be that going on too. I mean, that alone would not necessitate an entire press conference.
3391000	3397000	But at the same time, and hear me out here, I don't think Fallout 4 necessitates its own press conference either.
3397000	3398000	Yes it does.
3398000	3405000	Well, I mean, I'm not trying to belittle that game. Obviously that game is a big deal. But one game is not an entire press conference. Does that make sense?
3405000	3407000	That's true, yeah. They must have a pretty decent lineup too.
3407000	3415000	Exactly. So looking forward to what they might be bringing out there. The only bummer about that, it's on Sunday night.
3415000	3420000	Which means that press conference is going to be going on while OLR is happening.
3420000	3422000	That's right, live news, woo!
3422000	3431000	But it's making E3 week longer and longer because what E3 proper is what Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
3431000	3439000	The Microsoft and Sony conferences happen on Monday, as long with what? Is EA and Ubisoft also Monday? I think it is, right?
3439000	3441000	I don't remember these.
3441000	3443000	No, EA and Ubisoft are the first day of the show, I think.
3443000	3444000	Usually, yeah.
3444000	3450000	But anyway, it's backing up all the way to Sunday now with the Bethesda thing, so E3 week's getting longer and longer.
3450000	3457000	But hey, I know there's a lot of us out there, myself included, that's like, alright, new Fallout's all fine and good.
3458000	3463000	Can we get like, just maybe like a frame, just a glimpse, just a peek at the future of Elder Scrolls?
3463000	3464000	Yes.
3464000	3465000	I don't mean Elder Scrolls Online.
3465000	3470000	I'm fine with them even skipping Fallout 4 and doing yet another Elder Scrolls game. I'm totally cool with that.
3470000	3472000	Some people might disagree with you there.
3472000	3474000	I don't care. I really don't care.
3474000	3481000	BlackWolf in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, Elder Scrolls Online 2, Elder Harder.
3482000	3489000	Well, I wouldn't be surprised, actually, with all the focus and attention that, hey, new press conference is going to generate.
3489000	3493000	You know, because they'll be running it on Twitch, there's going to be a lot of eyes on this, I'm sure.
3493000	3496000	I wouldn't be surprised at all if they try to pimp up.
3496000	3505000	I wouldn't necessarily say expansion for Elder Scrolls Online, but this is the point where Elder Scrolls Online will have gone subscription-less.
3505000	3510000	I don't want to say free to play because you still have to buy the game, but there's no subscription fee, which is a huge move for them, right?
3510000	3515000	It will be on consoles by this point because it's going to be out in April on Xbox One.
3515000	3518000	I think it was April.
3518000	3524000	So come June would be a great time to announce what does the next phase of Elder Scrolls Online look like?
3524000	3530000	Why, now that this game is out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, should I go run out and buy it today?
3530000	3537000	So even though we sit here and joke about the future of Elder Scrolls, I wouldn't doubt it at all if they actually show,
3537000	3543000	like, here's what Elder Scrolls Online is going to evolve into, leading to maybe the first expansion or something.
3543000	3548000	God bless them for trying to make that game work. It got a lot of flak.
3548000	3557000	I think it came out at a bad time. It launched in a very crowded market, and it's hard to justify a subscription-based game.
3557000	3560000	Blizzard can kind of get away with it because they're Blizzard.
3560000	3564000	Square Enix gets away with it because the Final Fantasy brand carries a lot of oomph.
3564000	3573000	Well, and also the problem is that people are coming off of Elder Scrolls Skyrim, and that's a level of game that they're hoping to play with Elder Scrolls Online.
3573000	3577000	It's like, oh, it's Skyrim, but it's multiplayer. That's kind of what people wanted.
3577000	3587000	And then they played it, and they're like, well, it's not quite like that. It's more of just like a typical MMO being reskinned into Elder Scrolls.
3587000	3593000	So, I don't know, I think there's a little bit of disappointment there. Plus, you know, buggy launches.
3594000	3597000	Well, moving on to some other news from the week.
3597000	3604000	I was also going to mention, they're not the only company that has booked a venue for E3.
3604000	3613000	Nintendo has also booked a huge theater for this year's E3 as well, and we'll have to see what plans they have for that as well.
3613000	3615000	Wait, a huge theater? I thought it was more like...
3615000	3617000	Well, it's $2.99.
3617000	3620000	We did Rocky Horror in a 450c theater last night.
3620000	3622000	It's a small theater for...
3624000	3628000	But, yeah, okay. Wow. That's a small theater.
3628000	3634000	Maybe, are they going to do nothing with the theater, but maybe have that dinner smash tournament? Because that'd be pretty cool.
3634000	3638000	Oh, that's a thought, that maybe they were going to run some type of tournament there.
3638000	3642000	Maybe, you know, a lot of people are thinking, like, is this a press event?
3642000	3643000	Splatoon tournament?
3643000	3647000	Is Nintendo coming back to do a press thing? But, tournament sounds like a really good idea.
3647000	3654000	Maybe, I don't know. You'd think they got to tap into that fan base, that rabid fan base that Nintendo has somehow.
3654000	3660000	And if they could have, like, a public venue. But, man, only 299 seats, though. Everybody would be clamoring for that.
3660000	3661000	Yeah, I'm thinking...
3661000	3667000	Here's another great example of Nintendo's supply not matching demand. Only 299 seats in this theater.
3667000	3671000	What? That's like how many people are buying the console, right?
3671000	3673000	299 US seats.
3673000	3684000	No, no. There's plenty more people lining up for those amiibo. There's probably 299 people in line, at Fry's, trying to get one of those Majora's Mask 3DS's. It's pretty crazy.
3684000	3685000	So...
3685000	3692000	Alright. Dark Tetsuya agrees with you in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, saying, I was just thinking, a Splatoon tournament, perhaps?
3692000	3694000	So, anyway...
3694000	3702000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On's Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, GAS.
3702000	3710000	Let's talk about some news that kind of struck me by surprise. In Dark Soccer, I don't know if you were looking forward to this game. You're the resident BioWare fangirl.
3710000	3717000	So, I don't know if you knew a lot about this game, but it was Shadow Realms, which was the four-on-one dungeon crawler that BioWare was working on.
3717000	3724000	It was cancelled this past week, which kind of takes me by surprise. I don't know if that took you by surprise.
3724000	3726000	I have no idea what that game is.
3726000	3737000	A lot of people were saying it was like Evolve, because it was a full four-on-one type of thing, but it's got the BioWare in it, so I would imagine it was more story-driven and a little more RPG-driven.
3737000	3743000	What is one of the biggest complaints people have about Evolve? There's no single-player mode, right?
3743000	3751000	So, I would assume, and again, I'm making an assumption, but I would assume that Shadow Realms maybe was addressing some of that in the game that they were making.
3751000	3758000	But we'll never know, because they made the decision this past week to not move forward on the development of Shadow Realms.
3758000	3766000	I would like to see one of these four-on-one games be completely unfair. It's like the four people are Brave Warriors versus one baby.
3770000	3776000	Well, now, there have been no layoffs announced at BioWare Austin, which, fingers crossed, it'll stay that way.
3776000	3784000	They have said that they are shifting resources over to continued enhancements to Star Wars The Old Republic, speaking of a crowded MMO space.
3784000	3795000	You know, The Old Republic is free-to-play, and it's worth checking out if you're even remotely interested in Star Wars, but it sounds like some of these resources are going to make that game grow a little bit there.
3795000	3802000	And more enhancements to Dragon Age Inquisition. I'm not sure what that means, because that's a game that's already launched. Is that more DLC, perhaps?
3802000	3804000	Wolf Hunt, Wolf Hunt, Wolf Hunt, Wolf Hunt.
3806000	3811000	Dark Sakura has her wish list over there that she would like Austin to consider working on there.
3811000	3820000	Also, other Mass Effect, whatever the future is for Mass Effect, and, quote, other new IP. Wasn't there another science fiction game that BioWare-
3820000	3822000	Negiturian's the game. No, I'm kidding.
3822000	3827000	Wasn't there another BioWare franchise, like a new IP, science fiction IP they're working on that is not Mass Effect?
3827000	3828000	I don't know.
3828000	3829000	I don't think it was this, either.
3829000	3830000	I don't know.
3830000	3832000	Maybe a mystery IP.
3832000	3835000	Dragon Age in space!
3835000	3837000	That's Mass Effect, Loki. That's Mass Effect.
3837000	3838000	No, it's not.
3838000	3840000	Mass Effect in medieval time.
3840000	3841000	No, they're not.
3841000	3842000	That's Dragon Age.
3842000	3844000	That's not.
3844000	3846000	Medieval Mass Effect in space.
3846000	3854000	It isn't, because there is no planet on Mass Effect where you will fucking spend 40 hours running-
3854000	3856000	In the Hinterlands!
3856000	3859000	If the Hinterlands were a planet.
3859000	3860000	Alright, anyway.
3860000	3861000	Hinterworlds.
3861000	3862000	Hinterworlds.
3863000	3866000	Alright, DarkStalker, what do you have for us in the news?
3866000	3869000	I've got some stuff. Interesting stuff.
3869000	3876000	In fact, so interesting that it was- I actually stopped and went, really?
3876000	3886000	Apparently Square Enix Holdings have filed separate trademark applications for Squaresoft and Enix.
3887000	3893000	This was posted by a Japanese trademark bot Twitter account.
3893000	3899000	That basically anytime a trademark is filed, it pulls it from trade journals and makes it public.
3899000	3906000	So this was posted on January 19th that Square Enix posted the two trademark applications.
3906000	3911000	Again, Squaresoft, which was the former Square brand, and then one for Enix.
3911000	3914000	So take that for what you will.
3914000	3922000	It could just be possible that they're trying to make sure that those names don't get taken up once any expiration has occurred.
3922000	3925000	But, there you go.
3927000	3929000	I'd say take that for what you will.
3929000	3933000	Which, I really don't know how to read into that.
3933000	3941000	Like, I think obviously we have to address the first conclusion some people might jump to is that Square Enix is gonna split?
3941000	3942000	No.
3942000	3943000	No, that's not gonna happen.
3943000	3947000	Well, especially since we've got so many different merging IPs with them now.
3947000	3951000	Right, and don't forget, Eidos is a factor now too. I mean, if that were to happen, what would happen to Tomb Raider?
3951000	3955000	Like, you know, that's not really a thing. I don't see that happening.
3955000	3957000	All I care is that we get another bus to move.
3957000	3963000	Maybe, and you know what, if that's the whole reason for this to happen, then I am totally fine with it.
3963000	3966000	Goddammit, we're gonna make bus move, even if we have to leave.
3968000	3972000	And have it not be that dance summit. Even though dance summit was fun.
3972000	3974000	It needs to be old school bus to move.
3976000	3977000	I would be happy.
3977000	3980000	I would love that if that's the reason. Could it be maybe that, like,
3980000	3981000	Can we end the game?
3981000	3987000	Could there be, like, mobile phone development under one, but I don't, like, I think there already
3987000	3989000	I think it's more of a protection.
3989000	3990000	Ah.
3990000	4000000	To keep other people, you know, because especially if you, you know, if you also notice this, the tweets also did have trademark category 16.
4000000	4007000	Which refers to printed materials, like video game manuals, magazines, strategy guides.
4007000	4014000	So, I think it's more or less something just to protect past holdings.
4016000	4018000	So, take that for what you will.
4018000	4024000	That's a very good thought, and that's probably really all this is, is so that Loki can't go in there and say,
4025000	4033000	Oh, I'm going to make bus to move part 3, and I'm going to make it under Enix because there's no longer a trademark for that.
4033000	4040000	However, however, we should actually just, like, form a company for shits called Squeenix.
4041000	4046000	And we do nothing but sell squeaky hammers. Squeenix! Maybe.
4046000	4053000	Love it. Alright. Let's travel around the world and check out what game releases are coming out this week in game stores.
4053000	4058000	If anything at all. I know it's a slower time of year, but we did have Evolve last week.
4058000	4060000	Uh, Loki, what's it look like in the US?
4060000	4061000	I have fucking no idea.
4061000	4065000	Oh, and we had the new 3DS. Let me not leave that out.
4065000	4066000	Well, no.
4066000	4069000	This weekend, those Friday, Nintendo's Friday thing always freaking kills me.
4069000	4074000	Oh, God. Yeah, you know, I don't know.
4074000	4078000	Nintendo's like on their own page as far as like when they're going to release stuff.
4078000	4082000	And that was, it was funny enough, when I first started, you know, back when I was selling video games,
4082000	4086000	when I first started doing that, it was just like, oh, hey, you know what?
4086000	4091000	Um, we're going to go ahead and just release shit whenever we want.
4091000	4096000	Then everybody kind of got on board with how the movie industry works and, oh, we're going to release shit now on Tuesdays.
4096000	4098000	And everything was cool.
4098000	4104000	Except for fucking Nintendo, who decided, hey, we're going to release shit now on Fridays.
4104000	4110000	Or Sundays. Or God knows whenever it doesn't fucking matter because we're going to pick whenever we release shit.
4110000	4112000	So that's, that's my story there.
4112000	4117000	Anyways, so I was going to mention, let's see here.
4117000	4120000	God, I hate fucking website redesigns here.
4120000	4124000	If someone wants to go ahead, I'm still waiting on this shit to load.
4124000	4131000	No problem. I can go ahead and jump over to Japan and check out the Japanese releases of what's coming out in these next few days in Japan.
4131000	4136000	Dead or Alive 5, which I actually think is one of the releases here in the States this week, Logan.
4136000	4138000	Oh, that's right. Yeah, the re-release, yeah.
4139000	4143000	Dead or Alive 5 is making its way to Japan as well on the PlayStation 4.
4143000	4150000	Dead or Alive 5 last round in the collector's edition and what they called the Sakyuu package is making its way to Japan on the 19th.
4150000	4152000	That is on the PlayStation 4.
4152000	4157000	Also, God Eater 2 Rage Burst is out in Japan this week on the PlayStation 4.
4157000	4163000	And Terraria gets its Japanese retail release this week on the PlayStation 4 as well.
4164000	4172000	Over on the Xbox One, Dead or Alive 5 will make its way there for those of you, yea, few, but loyal who have the Xbox One over in Japan.
4172000	4176000	On the PlayStation 3, of course, Dead or Alive 5 on its way there as well.
4176000	4185000	And it is worth noting that there, with the release of Dead or Alive 5, you also have all these new fighting sticks and joysticks and so forth to celebrate the release of that.
4185000	4192000	Nothing on the 360 in Japan this week, but looking at the Wii U, I don't believe has anything until March.
4192000	4198000	No, I lied. No, I didn't lie because that date I'm looking at is for the US next week for Kirby.
4198000	4201000	Mario Party 10 is the next release in March on the Wii U.
4201000	4206000	In Japan on the PlayStation Vita, God Eater 2 Rage Burst is on the Vita as well.
4206000	4209000	Fur Ayaki 3 comes out as well.
4209000	4212000	Otoko Yukaku comes out as well.
4213000	4223000	And there's actually a new Vita pack, a debut pack Wi-Fi model in what they call blue black, red black, and there's a crystal black 3G Wi-Fi model.
4223000	4227000	I didn't even know they were still putting those out, but those are all coming out in Japan this week, obviously.
4227000	4232000	Probably the Japanese culture lends itself a little differently to the 3G.
4232000	4235000	That's it, nothing on the 3DS this week.
4235000	4241000	I was going to mention, you pretty much hit it on the head, it's just Dead or Alive 5 last round for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4241000	4245000	And Kirby and the Rainbow Curse for the Wii U. That's literally it.
4245000	4252000	This is honestly, I gotta say, just looking at what's come out this year so far, it's been the slowest year as far as releases.
4252000	4256000	Like, even in January, there's usually some stuff coming out, but it was, like, dead.
4256000	4259000	And so far in February, it's been dead.
4259000	4264000	Do you think this means that we're going to have a really crowded holiday or summer period?
4264000	4270000	I don't know what it means. I think it's just kind of going on that trend where we're getting less of the fringe and more of, like,
4270000	4273000	these big projects that they're working on instead of releasing.
4273000	4278000	You know, big AAA titles instead of just releasing a bunch of titles, they're just releasing a few really good titles.
4278000	4282000	Well, to be fair, I mean, Evolve was a pretty big deal, and that just, I mean, maybe not for me personally,
4282000	4286000	but I know a lot of people were really looking forward to that, and that was, you know, just this last week.
4286000	4290000	Yeah, I understand that, but, I mean, what else have we really had this year?
4290000	4294000	We had Saints Row, Gata out of Hell, Dying Light, and Evolve.
4294000	4298000	I mean, that's three games in the course of, you know, a month and a half.
4298000	4300000	Yeah, it has been a little slower. A month and a half.
4300000	4301000	Yeah.
4302000	4304000	Dark Sakura, how about the UK? Is it slow over there, too?
4304000	4311000	Yeah, a little. We've got, on the 19th, the Order 1886 on PlayStation 4.
4311000	4317000	And then on the 20th, there's Dead or Alive 5 last round on everything, pretty much.
4318000	4319000	That's it.
4320000	4321000	Alright.
4321000	4326000	Oh, and I'm sorry, there was a little bit of a bigger one that I completely missed.
4326000	4327000	Uh-oh.
4327000	4329000	The Order 1886 is actually coming out.
4329000	4330000	Oh, is that this week?
4330000	4331000	That's on the 20th.
4331000	4332000	Oh, I thought that was next week.
4332000	4335000	I thought that game had been delayed, to be honest.
4335000	4341000	You know what it is? I don't realize we're as late in February as we are.
4341000	4343000	Like, that is really throwing me for a loop.
4343000	4346000	Like, oh my god, the 20th is in this next week?
4346000	4348000	I just crazy care about the game.
4348000	4351000	I don't know, but, yeah, so the Order 1886, that's coming out as well.
4351000	4353000	Well, that is a pretty big deal, Loogie.
4353000	4354000	Alright.
4354000	4356000	For some people, for some people.
4356000	4358000	It's one that some PlayStation 4 owners have been waiting for.
4358000	4362000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week.
4362000	4364000	Loogie, you got a pretty big one.
4364000	4371000	Alright, so, I, you know, I can't say that I'm surprised, because I'm not.
4371000	4376000	Because I've been seeing this since Fable 2, I guess.
4376000	4383000	Um, Peter Molyneux, backing, you know, he can't live up to his hype, I guess.
4383000	4386000	And so, for example, Goddess.
4386000	4390000	Um, there was the whole contest that was based around that stupid curiosity.
4390000	4392000	What the fuck is in the cube?
4392000	4394000	Let's waste your time clicking on the cube.
4394000	4396000	You know, that bullshit.
4396000	4404000	And, fucking, the winner of that was supposed to get, you know, basically be a god in the game.
4404000	4411000	And they were gonna get, like, part of, you know, the proceeds, or part of the revenue from the game or something like that.
4411000	4420000	And, two years after this contest has ended, still hasn't fulfilled his promise to the winner.
4420000	4424000	And, that's just really stupid.
4424000	4433000	And, on top of that, you know, Goddess, I think is, I still think it's very early in all the, like, features and stuff that they were talking about it.
4433000	4440000	It's just not up to where it needs to be at this point, especially since the Kickstarter ended, what I think.
4440000	4442000	It was a while ago.
4442000	4446000	A while ago, yeah. So, they haven't fulfilled a lot of the rewards for the backers.
4446000	4452000	They are, you know, cutting features that they were, you know, promising that they would be doing.
4452000	4454000	It's just, it's a big old fucking mess.
4454000	4459000	And, I want to say that it was, they had a Rock Paper Shotgun article or something that called them out on that kind of thing.
4459000	4463000	Which, I didn't even really read it because I just heard it was just, it's...
4463000	4472000	It was, it was hard to read because, I mean, I get that there are people out there that want to ask hard hitting questions.
4472000	4478000	And, I think you can do that. But, I felt their approach was very tactless.
4478000	4482000	I mean, the very first question in the interview is, are you a pathological liar?
4482000	4485000	And, what kind of tone does that set?
4485000	4488000	I mean, I think that's just kind of fucking rude.
4488000	4491000	I mean, I realize that this game is stumbling and so forth.
4491000	4497000	But, you know, this guy is, whether you love him or hate him, he's worked very hard in the game industry.
4497000	4502000	And, he's made some incredibly notable influential games.
4502000	4506000	Whether you like him or not, you know, I just feel like that kind of question...
4506000	4510000	There's a way to ask that without kind of being a dick.
4510000	4518000	Like, instead of that, why not ask, you know, why notice in your Kickstarter campaign you said X, Y, and Z would happen.
4518000	4521000	Here we are 18 months later and X, Y, Z hasn't happened.
4521000	4525000	Can you explain why these situations seem to continue to happen out of your company?
4525000	4533000	I think there's a much better tactful way to ask a hard question than, are you a fucking liar?
4533000	4539000	Which, you know, is basically what I read when I read a question like that about being a pathological liar.
4539000	4543000	That was really rough, I think.
4543000	4552000	And, I mean, I don't know. I've been saying that, you know, especially when they're talking about how important the dog would be in Fable 2 and shit.
4552000	4559000	And it just wasn't that. Or like, you know, when they're talking up Fable 3 and when they're talking up just like...
4559000	4563000	I don't know, just pretty much anything I hear him hyping up.
4563000	4566000	I can't get hyped up about it because I know it's full of shit.
4566000	4574000	Or, it's not full of shit, but it's like he's talking up stuff like it's evolutionary, like this is the first time ever that something's happened like this.
4574000	4578000	And it's just not. It's just like a normal feature in a game.
4578000	4586000	Let me go to some comments from our chat room. Bobby Blackwolf, our pal here at VoG, giving us some insight in the chat over at live.vognetwork.com saying,
4586000	4592000	I've met Molyneux. Here's the thing. The problem with him is that he loves games too much and he loves talking about them.
4593000	4599000	He loves talking about his ideas, but we all take his ideas as absolute final features in a finished product.
4599000	4602000	He doesn't see them as that way, but that doesn't come across.
4602000	4607000	His love of games is infectious even if you only sit and talk to him for two minutes.
4607000	4612000	Well, let me... I mean, when you... I get that. I totally get that.
4612000	4618000	But now you have this Kickstarter thing, which maybe wasn't a factor before in Molyneux's career,
4618000	4623000	which was now, do you think, and I ask everybody, not just Bobby, like everybody I'm asking this question,
4623000	4630000	do you think that maybe with Molyneux kind of dreaming big, that led to saying things in the Kickstarter
4630000	4634000	that maybe they didn't really have the plan on how they were going to get there?
4634000	4637000	Well, that's the problem though. But if you've been in game development that long,
4637000	4641000	then you should be able to know what you're capable of accomplishing.
4641000	4646000	And I'm sorry, I don't buy that he's so passionate about games that he's fucking terrible
4646000	4650000	at figuring out what his company's able to do in a timely manner.
4650000	4654000	I mean, that's the thing. He's been in the game industry for a while.
4654000	4660000	He should know how to hit deadlines, know about how to make sure that the features
4660000	4662000	that he's promising are going to be in there.
4662000	4665000	Because he's had the answer to people before about games.
4665000	4669000	They didn't just say, yeah, Fable 2 is going to be this fucking amazing game
4669000	4674000	that's going to be super immersive and that's going to be online multiplayer, blah, blah, blah, or whatever.
4674000	4678000	And then just totally back down on that. I mean, he's got to answer to somebody.
4678000	4684000	He's not new to this, and I just don't buy that this late into the game
4684000	4686000	that he doesn't know what he's doing.
4686000	4692000	But I just have to say on this whole thing, this just continues this really unfortunate trend
4692000	4697000	that has existed in gaming for a long time, has really come up to a head this past year
4697000	4703000	where there's just a real lack of respect in gaming, and it's really sad to see happen.
4703000	4707000	There's always going to be differences of opinion, depending on how you believe
4707000	4712000	a game's journalism website should or should not be run, or how a game should or should not be made,
4712000	4715000	and who should or should not have a say in the making of those games.
4715000	4718000	We're all going to have differing opinions on that. That's going to happen.
4718000	4722000	But we need to show a little respect for those diversities of opinions.
4722000	4727000	That is something that has been gravely lacking, and we've really seen this come to a head,
4727000	4730000	especially in the past year, and it's sad.
4730000	4734000	Well, they're driving away people that, you know, like he mentioned, you know,
4734000	4739000	I'm not going to talk to press anymore, you know, and even like look at Notch, you know,
4739000	4742000	he kind of had the same thing where he's like, well, I'm not going to talk to you people anymore
4742000	4744000	because you're being fucking rude to these people.
4744000	4750000	If gamers can't get over this respect, and I'm sorry, and I hate to call this out,
4750000	4757000	but it is what it is. That Rock Paper Shotgun interview is an example of what I believe to be a lack of respect.
4757000	4761000	Once again, though, just like even like, I hate to try to cross paths here,
4761000	4765000	but even like with like the whole gamer gate crap that's going on there,
4765000	4770000	you have to also remember one thing, that you can't judge one person by the whole industry
4770000	4773000	or whole group of people. Like, just because they were dicks in their article
4773000	4778000	doesn't mean that like every game outlet out there is going to be dicks to you.
4778000	4781000	I mean, same with, you know, gamers. Just because one gamer is a fucking asshole
4781000	4785000	and is like being mean to people on the internet doesn't mean everybody does that.
4785000	4788000	You can't make these broad generalizations.
4789000	4797000	However, and I will point out the hashtag not all men and yes all women,
4797000	4804000	just because it is a group of people that are behaving that way and not the entire thing,
4804000	4808000	you don't know if the people that you're talking to are among them.
4808000	4812000	If you see it so public and it has happened so often,
4812000	4818000	you're going to have a fear of speaking to anybody associated with that group.
4818000	4821000	You have to protect yourself if you can't deal with it.
4821000	4824000	Which is why I think we need to get away from groupthink in the first place.
4824000	4826000	Indeed, but that's how society is born.
4826000	4829000	No matter what your angle is, you have to get away from groupthink.
4829000	4830000	But that's how society is.
4830000	4833000	I understand that, but society, there's many people everywhere.
4833000	4836000	You're going to just, might as well just close yourself in a closet and hide.
4836000	4837000	There's people like that.
4837000	4841000	Well, I'm sorry, but I mean, you can't just, that has not an excuse that,
4841000	4844000	oh, there's a few people doing it, so now I have to assume everybody is.
4845000	4851000	If you have had nothing but this negative experience, it's reinforced it every time it happens.
4851000	4853000	Then you need to get out in the world and have more experiences.
4853000	4856000	Hold on, hold on. I think, I think, and trying to move on and move the show forward,
4856000	4860000	I think also it's important for, you know, we're talking about two extremes here.
4860000	4865000	And I think that's why it's important for the rest of us in the middle to say to the mean people,
4865000	4871000	hey, shut up, let this person have their say, and let's have a respectful dialogue.
4871000	4877000	It's up to the rest of us to not, to basically credit those mean people, if that makes sense.
4877000	4884000	Well, the whole point is that in order to, in order to keep stuff like this from happening,
4884000	4887000	we have to have a method of policing our own pretty much.
4887000	4890000	People have to be held accountable for the things that they say.
4890000	4894000	And then, and then it's tough because free speech, you know.
4894000	4897000	No, free speech has nothing to do with accountability.
4897000	4898000	I know, I know.
4898000	4907000	Free speech only, the free speech argument in the Constitution only has to do with discussing the government in acceptable locations.
4907000	4909000	It has nothing to do with freedom of consequence.
4909000	4911000	But you know someone's thinking it.
4911000	4915000	They're, they're, then they're an idiot and clearly haven't studied U.S. history.
4915000	4916000	All right.
4916000	4917000	Or government.
4917000	4923000	I got to move on in the interest of time because we could probably spend three hours talking about all of the problems in gaming right now.
4923000	4925000	But you know, I don't know.
4925000	4932000	I want to see good things happen with the game and I want good things to happen to Peter Molyneux, who I think is a great mind.
4932000	4936000	But it does sound like, you know, maybe he's bit off a little more and he can chew.
4936000	4941000	Hopefully this whole reserving a little bit, maybe going back into the shell for a little bit,
4941000	4948000	maybe the good that can come of that is he can really focus on what's important right now and that is making Godus the great game it can be.
4948000	4952000	And just think, if some more people are mean to other developers, they can make another Law and Order episode out of it.
4952000	4953000	Don't go there.
4953000	4954000	Let's go.
4954000	4956000	Let's go to some more news.
4956000	4959000	We're going to talk about Banjo-Kazooie.
4959000	4965000	There's a Banjo-Kazooie spiritual successor on its way from Rare Veterans.
4965000	4970000	Now, keep in mind that, you know, certain IPs are held by certain people.
4970000	4973000	So this isn't, you know, like Banjo-Kazooie sequel.
4973000	4979000	But there is a group of Rare employees who have a new indie team called Playtonic Games.
4979000	4989000	And Playtonic has been publishing some little teasers there about what the spiritual successor to Banjo-Kazooie might look like.
4989000	4994000	Now, obviously, we don't know what platforms this is going to be on because this is still very early teases.
4994000	5001000	And when I say spiritual successor, I mean like how Mighty No. 9 is a spiritual successor to Mega Man, right?
5001000	5003000	Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
5003000	5008000	Well, anyhow, there's more information that was published in Edge Magazine, which includes some pictures and so forth.
5008000	5012000	That you can take a look at. This is all still very early on, of course.
5012000	5019000	But it is nice to know that fans of Banjo-Kazooie at least have something to look forward to, even if not a direct sequel.
5019000	5022000	I'm totally looking forward to Guitar Flutie.
5022000	5025000	Let's hope. Let's hope. Guitar Flutie.
5027000	5028000	One can only hope.
5028000	5032000	Alright, well let's travel back to a time. Let's go back to a simpler time in games.
5032000	5035000	Maybe when Banjo-Kazooie was actually a thing.
5036000	5039000	Actually, you know what? Fuck that. Let's go even further back this week.
5039000	5043000	Because Dark Soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks,
5043000	5046000	Hey, you guys should be checking out this game this week.
5046000	5049000	It is a classic video game worthy of your attention.
5049000	5050000	It's older than a lot of you.
5050000	5053000	This is a real old game this week.
5053000	5054000	It's creaky.
5054000	5058000	Alright, let's check it out. The classic game of the week.
5058000	5061000	The classic game of the week is Munchkin.
5061000	5070000	Munchkin was cartridge number 38 in the Magnavox Phillips line of games for the Phillips video pack.
5070000	5076000	We got it on the Odyssey 2 in North America as a game called Casey Munchkin.
5076000	5083000	Which was a reference to the president of the company at the time, Kenneth C. Mencken.
5084000	5087000	So this game was programmed by Ed Averitt.
5087000	5090000	And it was based a lot off of Pac-Man.
5090000	5092000	You don't say.
5092000	5095000	But not an exact clone.
5095000	5100000	Atari, however, got their panties in a bunch.
5100000	5103000	Because of how similar it was.
5103000	5108000	Atari had been licensed to produce the first version of Pac-Man at home.
5108000	5111000	But Munchkin came out before Pac-Man.
5112000	5117000	Munchkin was out in 1981, a year before Pac-Man was ready for release.
5117000	5120000	And it was probably better than Pac-Man.
5120000	5122000	It's quite a bit better.
5122000	5124000	On Atari, on Atari.
5124000	5130000	So an Atari could not convince the court at all to stop the sale of Munchkin.
5130000	5131000	But they did win in appeals.
5131000	5137000	So in 1982, they basically said that Phillips copied Pac-Man.
5137000	5142000	And made alterations only to emphasize the extent to which it deliberately copied.
5142000	5146000	I just want to note, I did kill the sound on the video.
5146000	5150000	Because that noise does grate a little left.
5150000	5153000	That is one place where Munchkin was a little weaker, I think.
5153000	5155000	That noise does get a little grating.
5155000	5158000	So I went ahead and killed that soundtrack.
5159000	5161000	Than the Atari version of Pac-Man.
5161000	5165000	But anyway, the ruling was actually, this is really, really important.
5165000	5171000	Because it was one of the first ones to establish how copyright law applied to computer software.
5171000	5179000	So, that being said, the differences it has from Pac-Man is that there are 12 pills in the game called Munchies.
5179000	5180000	In each maze.
5180000	5182000	And they are in four groups of three.
5182000	5186000	But they move through the maze independently and at different speeds.
5186000	5188000	Depending on how fast one is eaten.
5188000	5193000	The final one moves at exactly the same speed as Munchkin and you have to intercept it.
5195000	5199000	The super pills are called Blinking Munchies because they flash and change color.
5200000	5203000	Some of the mazes are invisible as soon as you start moving.
5203000	5206000	It has a programmable mode where you can make your own mazes.
5206000	5210000	Because that was like the big thing about The Odyssey.
5210000	5215000	Is that it was, you could include programmable elements into a lot of your games.
5215000	5219000	And keep in mind, The Odyssey 2 was one of the first video game systems I ever played.
5220000	5224000	Well, it was one of the first, I think, that most people of a certain age ever played.
5224000	5225000	Because it was all that was there.
5225000	5226000	Well, yeah.
5226000	5228000	I mean, you had the fair trial channel left.
5228000	5229000	Anyway.
5229000	5234000	So, the boxes where the ghosts regenerate actually rotate.
5234000	5236000	So, the ghosts can exit from any side.
5236000	5238000	It adds a lot more challenge to it.
5238000	5240000	And you can actually enter the boss.
5240000	5243000	If you're powered up, you can actually eat the monsters while they regenerate.
5243000	5244000	It's kind of cool.
5244000	5247000	The monsters are called Munchers and you're called the Munchkin.
5247000	5251000	You have three Munchers instead of the four ghosts.
5251000	5255000	And Munchkin actually has fewer objects on the game board.
5255000	5259000	But renders them with better color and animation.
5259000	5260000	So, overall, yes.
5260000	5262000	Graphically, it's better.
5262000	5263000	It plays better.
5263000	5265000	It has a lot more elements to it.
5265000	5268000	But, there we go.
5268000	5272000	So, after Munchkin got pushed off.
5272000	5277000	Phillips put out a sequel called Crazy Chase.
5277000	5280000	Or in the U.S. we got it as Casey's Crazy Chase.
5280000	5286000	Which actually was more of a parody of that whole conflict.
5286000	5294000	By pitting the Munchkin across an insect tree eating opponent called the Dratapillar.
5294000	5298000	That looked like the centipede from Atari.
5298000	5301000	So, you basically power up and advance.
5301000	5306000	Not by eating the pills, but by eating the Dratapillar's body.
5306000	5308000	And so, that's Crazy's Crazy Chase.
5308000	5320000	And also, the Munchkin character was redesigned to roll through the mazes without a continuous chomping animation like Pac-Man did.
5320000	5323000	And I actually have both of these games.
5323000	5328000	A lot of the copies of Casey Munchkin are gone.
5328000	5331000	I mean, they were tried to round up, destroyed.
5331000	5337000	And I actually looked into my copy at a thrift store for 25 cents.
5337000	5338000	Wow.
5338000	5339000	Yeah.
5339000	5341000	Along with a copy of Crazy Chase.
5341000	5342000	So, I got them both.
5342000	5343000	Wow.
5343000	5349000	Especially considering these games are kind of like, you know, now you see them on those, these games were banned type of specials.
5349000	5351000	You know, even though that might be a, you know.
5351000	5353000	I don't think it's that terribly hard to find it.
5353000	5357000	But Casey Munchkin, Casey's Crazy Chase isn't that bad as far as finding a copy.
5357000	5361000	But Casey Munchkin, because of just the drama around it.
5361000	5362000	Right.
5362000	5365000	It's kind of a, if you find a copy, keep it.
5365000	5368000	I don't even care if you have an Odyssey 2.
5368000	5369000	Just keep it.
5369000	5371000	Or is it Odyssey squared?
5371000	5373000	It's a piece of gaming history one way or the other.
5373000	5374000	Yes, it is.
5374000	5376000	And it's actually a really fun little game.
5376000	5377000	So.
5377000	5380000	But maybe on mute with your own soundtrack.
5380000	5382000	Go to OLR while you play.
5382000	5384000	And play it on mute.
5384000	5388000	Although I will say of all the Pac-Man clones, nothing touches mousetrap.
5388000	5394000	I want to see Casey Munchkin get the 3D, you know.
5394000	5396000	I want to see that brought modern day.
5396000	5398000	You want Munchkin in the Oculus Rift?
5398000	5401000	No, I want to see Munchkin as like a cartoon character.
5401000	5402000	Like we have a Pac-Man.
5402000	5404000	I want to see it ripping off everything.
5405000	5409000	Hey, if Casey Munchkin can get, you know, can be around.
5409000	5410000	Can we get Sanic?
5410000	5414000	Do you want to see if me, Sanic the Hedgehog.
5414000	5415000	Sanic the Hodgehog.
5415000	5416000	So, okay.
5416000	5418000	So Casey Munchkin checking eBay.
5418000	5425000	It really doesn't, now if you have a complete copy of Casey Munchkin, 20 bucks.
5425000	5431000	There is a, yeah there's a few on here, like there's posters and stuff.
5431000	5435000	But yeah, you're not really going to pay that much for a copy of Casey Munchkin.
5435000	5442000	Except, you know, keep in mind, people are generally asking anywhere between 15 to 20 bucks start for it.
5442000	5443000	Right.
5443000	5447000	Which for a Magnavox Odyssey 2 game, that is kind of crazy.
5447000	5448000	So.
5448000	5453000	But these games are getting close to 35 years old, so if you can believe it.
5453000	5455000	Yeah, they're older than some of you.
5455000	5457000	Many of you actually.
5457000	5458000	Yes.
5458000	5460000	I think older than Loki, I think actually.
5460000	5462000	Just by a few months.
5462000	5463000	So.
5463000	5465000	Are you really that young?
5465000	5467000	Yeah, Loki's what, 34?
5467000	5468000	In a row?
5468000	5469000	Oh wait, that's 37.
5469000	5470000	There we go.
5470000	5471000	That's Rob.
5471000	5472000	That's me.
5472000	5473000	No, not till June.
5473000	5474000	You know what?
5474000	5475000	Don't age me.
5475000	5476000	Faster than I need to.
5476000	5477000	You know what?
5477000	5478000	What?
5478000	5479000	I'm still older than you, so shut up.
5479000	5480000	I know, I know.
5480000	5481000	And I'm broken.
5481000	5483000	I have to get a hip replacement, y'all.
5483000	5489000	Well it's okay, Dorian Gray over there, you know, Bobby Blackwolf, he's been what, you know, what age has he been for the last?
5489000	5490000	29.
5490000	5491000	He's been 29.
5491000	5493000	He's been 29 for like a long time, so.
5493000	5495000	You just don't look at the painting, Bobby.
5495000	5497000	That's all you have to do.
5497000	5499000	Alright, alright.
5499000	5501000	There it is.
5501000	5503000	Your classic game of the week.
5503000	5505000	Munchkin, or KC Munchkin as the case may be.
5505000	5506000	Yes.
5506000	5507000	For the Odyssey.
5507000	5508000	Alright.
5508000	5509000	Again, play on mute.
5509000	5510000	But you know what was the best?
5510000	5511000	What?
5511000	5512000	Crypt equip.
5512000	5513000	Have you done that as a game of the week?
5513000	5514000	I don't think you have.
5514000	5515000	I don't think I have.
5515000	5516000	You may have to bring that up.
5516000	5518000	Oh, cryptologic or whatever the fuck they called it.
5518000	5519000	Yeah.
5519000	5522000	Where you basically, it just, it's the word scramble is all it is.
5522000	5523000	That game was fun.
5523000	5526000	Hey, still, you know, it was probably one of the first on a television.
5526000	5528000	I think I did Quest for the Rings before.
5528000	5529000	Yes, that one you did.
5529000	5530000	I remember that one.
5530000	5531000	I remember that one.
5531000	5535000	Anyway, we'll talk during the break about more classic games.
5535000	5536000	I was in second grade.
5536000	5538000	But we're gonna take a quick break, guys.
5538000	5543000	When we come back, there's plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come, including the forum follow-up, the FUGL question of the week.
5543000	5548000	Your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
5548000	5554000	We will get to your calls when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5560000	5563000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
5563000	5571000	Live this evening on February the 15th of 2015 with episode number 587 of our program.
5571000	5575000	Hope you guys all had a good Valentine's Day, however you chose to celebrate it.
5575000	5579000	I'm sure there's some of you out there that say, well, it's Singles Awareness Day.
5579000	5585000	Well, I hope you found a pet to love because, you know, we love our pets here at Orange Lounge Radio, our kitties and puppies.
5585000	5594000	So, you know, this is always a good time to remind you guys to consider adopting a pet if you need someone to love on Valentine's Day.
5594000	5600000	And even if you already have a human being, you know, couples could always use pets, right?
5600000	5603000	I think all of us here in the room have some pets. We do love pets.
5603000	5606000	Some of our significant others are pets.
5606000	5608000	That's another way to look at it. Absolutely.
5608000	5610000	I have two pets, Dan and the cat.
5610000	5612000	There you go. There you go.
5612000	5616000	All right, let's get into tonight's forum follow-up.
5620000	5627000	Over at the forums over at vognetwork.com, forums.vognetwork.com, every week I try to select a few posts,
5627000	5634000	talk about here on the show kind of following up what we talked about on last week's program.
5634000	5639000	And even though I had made a few posts this week, I didn't get a lot of feedback on them,
5639000	5646000	but there was this one, which did actually get quite a few responses, so I thought I'd bring this post up, and that was about educational games.
5646000	5651000	And you might remember at the end of last week's show, Dark Soccer, I think, or maybe it was Loki,
5651000	5656000	was talking about a Doctor Who game that actually helps teach children to code.
5656000	5659000	And it was kind of part of a broader BBC initiative.
5659000	5663000	And it had me thinking about educational games.
5663000	5667000	And I know we've had a FUGO question probably very similar to this in the past,
5667000	5672000	but usually when educational games comes up, the same games are always named, right?
5672000	5673000	What do we think of right off the bat?
5673000	5677000	Carmen Sandiego, Number Munchers, and Oregon Trail, right?
5677000	5679000	Those are like the big three. Turtle.
5679000	5683000	Yeah, well, I mean, but then there's those that I think we're a little more attached to,
5683000	5688000	and I wanted to ask on the forums, what games really shaped you?
5688000	5695000	What do you remember playing, and what do you look back on and say, yes, that game actually had an impact on me?
5695000	5699000	Like, for example, one game that I remember, it was an educational game from my youth,
5699000	5703000	and one that I mentioned here was a game called Weather Tamers on the Commodore 64.
5703000	5708000	And a lot of y'all probably never heard of this game, and it was, you know, it was a very kind of under-the-radar game.
5709000	5715000	But in college, when I originally started college, believe it or not, I know some of you might find this hard to believe,
5715000	5720000	I wanted to be a weatherman at first, and that was something I was learning to do.
5720000	5726000	And I would actually say that game had a little bit, not total influence on that, but had a little bit of influence on that.
5726000	5729000	And that was a Commodore 64 game where you had, like, a giant map,
5729000	5734000	and you could move, like, high pressure and low pressure around to kind of, I don't want to say you played God,
5734000	5741000	but you definitely, like, could control the weather, and the goal was to make certain weather situations in towns.
5741000	5748000	So it was kind of a way to learn geography as well as, you know, what makes rain, what makes snow, what makes tornadoes, and things like that.
5748000	5752000	So that was a game that I remember, was Weather Tamers.
5752000	5756000	So some of you guys in our forums responded to this as well.
5756000	5762000	Bobby Blackwell mentioned a game called Agent USA, and in this game you would learn cities and states,
5762000	5766000	and you had to type them in exactly. This also helped you learn about time zones.
5766000	5771000	That would affect it when you would get somewhere, and you needed to know what cities were state capitals,
5771000	5776000	because that's where you got the better trains, and he goes on to say, I never beat it as a kid.
5776000	5781000	SSG100Matt shared a game called Memory Manor, which was on the ColecoVision,
5781000	5786000	saying that I remember playing this game back in first grade on the Coleco Adam computer system.
5786000	5792000	You play as a window washer with a helping helicopter trying to clean windows that have corresponding symbols on them.
5792000	5800000	It forces you to memorize the windows and strategically place your washing fluid supply so you can clean windows efficiently.
5800000	5804000	So it's kind of like a, you know, it's in the title there. It was Memory. It was a play on the game Memory.
5804000	5810000	And Odell Lake was mentioned too, and I saw a lot of people on Twitter, because I talked about this post on Twitter,
5810000	5815000	and a lot of people were responding with Odell Lake, and SSG100Matt saying, I played this in grade school.
5815000	5819000	This is a very popular game among the kids in my class along with Oregon Trail.
5819000	5824000	This is a play for points kind of educational game, but I remember doing worksheets that were supplied by the game.
5824000	5833000	The object was to play as a certain kind of fish and make decisions as to which fish or bacteria to eat, chase, ignore, or swim away in deep or shallow water.
5833000	5839000	I remember that it was cool to be the rainbow trout so you could eat just about anything except the otter and osprey.
5840000	5851000	Flaco Jones shares that he also appreciated Odell Lake, but one thing I remember fondly about the Commodore 64 was the plastic piano overlay
5851000	5858000	that was only used for a few games including Commodore Music Maker, and I don't even remember this.
5858000	5863000	I was a big Commodore 64 fan. I never saw that plastic overlay. That is awesome.
5863000	5867000	There's a little YouTube here he linked in our forums saying, I didn't stick with it, but I wish I had,
5867000	5874000	because looking back it seems like an awesome way to teach music. I was too busy messing around with it. Awesome.
5874000	5878000	Loki, you responded too that you also loved Odell Lake.
5878000	5884000	Yeah, I completely forgot about it. It was a fun game to play, and I think I was also in the rainbow trout so you could eat everything.
5884000	5892000	What was it about that game that you remember? See, somehow this one was not on my radar. I never really played this game growing up.
5892000	5897000	I mean, I kind of get why people like it now, but I missed out on it, unfortunately. It wasn't at my school, I guess.
5897000	5902000	I don't remember, to be honest. Why I liked it, I think, is because I got to eat things. That's funny.
5902000	5903000	You got to eat things.
5903000	5907000	Same reason why you got to hunt and kill everything in the hunting parts in the Oregon Trail.
5907000	5913000	And now look at it all these years later. What does he do? He comes on OLR and he likes to eat things. There it is.
5913000	5919000	And I like to shoot things in video games. How we've changed.
5919000	5926000	Thank you guys for your responses. I'll be posting some follow-up topics throughout the week over at our forums at vognetwork.com.
5926000	5929000	Check it out and feel free to start your own topic. You don't have to wait for me to say something.
5929000	5932000	What is it that they have in computer labs nowadays?
5932000	5942000	That's a really good question. I don't know. You will be finding that out pretty soon, I imagine, when Josh gets ready to start grade school and so forth.
5942000	5943000	Yeah, but not for a couple of years.
5943000	5952000	It's still a few years away. Maybe our chat room can help us out. Maybe those that have children in grade school, because I know some of our listeners have children.
5952000	5955000	What do they look like nowadays? I'd be very curious as well.
5955000	5960000	So I'm sure they're not playing the old ass copy of Floppy Dizzy. What the fuck is this?
5960000	5966000	No, but I imagine at a very young age they are probably teaching typing. You know, how to properly type.
5966000	5970000	And there's probably a lot of games that reinforce that because it's so important.
5970000	5982000	I would hope at a younger age there are simulations and experiences that talk about privacy online and how to be careful what you write in an email and things like that.
5982000	5986000	I hope they're kind of sharing those types of things as well.
5986000	5993000	I'd be curious if our chatters know the answers to that question. What do computer labs look like nowadays? I want to know.
5993000	5999000	Meanwhile, while we wait for some answers to that question, let's go through some rapid fire news tonight. Loki.
5999000	6007000	Alright. Yeah, because honestly if they're not going to have, well I'm sure they have updated versions of The Oregon Trail.
6007000	6017000	The Binding of Isaac Rebirth. It's going to be getting some DLC which they're titling after birth. That's awesome.
6017000	6018000	Oh lord.
6018000	6026000	They said it should easily extend the gameplay time by another 100-200 hours. Which is just ridiculous.
6026000	6027000	Wow.
6027000	6034000	Things that it will include. Over 100 new items in the game. A full new game mode that will totally change how you play.
6034000	6046000	New challenges, new playable character, alternate final chapter, new alternate floors, new game ending, new bosses, new items, new co-op babies, new transformations.
6046000	6054000	Sounds like a whole new game. So that should be coming out later on this year. So I'll take a look at it.
6055000	6064000	And then, this is kind of cool, new features coming out to the Xbox One. Even though it is something that we've been able to do on PC and other consoles.
6064000	6070000	But now, the Xbox One is going to be able to take screenshots and you'll be able to share the screenshots.
6070000	6078000	And how do we know this? Because Phil Spencer took a screenshot and shared said screenshot using the feature over Twitter.
6078000	6084000	And so, that's pretty cool. You'll be able to do that as well as video and stuff.
6084000	6090000	And then this is all sorts of exciting. This brings me back to like, Urguts.
6090000	6100000	But they announced that Final Fantasy Disidea is going to be getting a brand new arcade game.
6100000	6106000	And you know, basically a 3 on 3 battle game. And it looks awesome.
6106000	6110000	And they're not necessarily going to be talking about details of the game on April 10th.
6110000	6117000	So happy to hear that arcades are still getting games that are not just ticket spitters. Except Japan only, right?
6117000	6124000	I'm just saying though, hey, I'm all for the arcades getting this game. But can we get this game too? Because it looks awesome.
6124000	6129000	Only if it shoots out tickets. Is the only way you're going to see it over here, probably.
6129000	6139000	Hey, Nintendo. There you go. Have it spit out tickets that you can go redeem at, well since they're embedded GameStop. Go redeem at GameStop.
6139000	6151000	Alright, well some news I have is PlayStation made some announcements about the PlayStation Network this week about converting what they call a sub account to a master account.
6151000	6157000	Now a lot of our listeners might not be very familiar with this unless you, again, have children at home of a certain age.
6157000	6162000	Probably like a young teenager. You may have had that teenager have a sub account.
6162000	6172000	And what this was is this was a way that somebody under the age of 18 could access PlayStation Network but parents or guardians would still manage the online experience.
6172000	6179000	So you have these sub accounts. Well PlayStation announced this week you will now be able to upgrade those sub accounts to master accounts.
6180000	6186000	I mean PlayStation Network's been really up and running full speed since PlayStation 3. I mean some could argue PlayStation 2.
6186000	6194000	But it's really been full speed since PlayStation 3. PlayStation 3 launched almost 10 years ago now. It was 2006 when PS3 launched, right?
6194000	6203000	So next year will be the 10 year anniversary. So a lot of those 14 and 15 year olds that might have had some of these sub accounts are going to be 24 and 25.
6203000	6212000	So then again, I don't know how long they've been offering sub accounts. But regardless, folks are getting older and they move on and might want to keep that old PlayStation account.
6212000	6218000	So they can now migrate it from a sub account to a master account. More information available on the official PlayStation blog.
6218000	6222000	We'll need a size zero Phillips screwdriver to do such training.
6222000	6232000	Stop. One of the producers over at Capcom, Ray Jimenez, would like to see a Bayonetta and Devil May Cry crossover.
6232000	6239000	As I think a lot of us would like to see. So this quote, definitely raising some eyebrows this week.
6239000	6252000	Quote, as a developer and a gamer, I would love to do that and how that would happen. Well, let me just say to you, that would be the most insane Gonzo action game you would ever see with tag team back and forth switching and combos with stylish Dante or whoever coming in and doing stuff.
6252000	6258000	It would actually be a dream come true. I'm sure with Capcom it's possible to do really cool things, but I don't know if this would ever happen.
6258000	6264000	But I can't deny that the thought of it would be totally mind-blowing. I'm sure Platinum would be on board with doing something crazy.
6264000	6272000	Just like Tim Gunn says, make it work. Figure out the license. Make it work.
6272000	6283000	Between the two companies, if I were to take a guess or stab at who would not be on board with it, I would say it's Capcom. If Capcom's on board with it, then there should be no fucking problem with it.
6284000	6286000	They should be able to do it.
6286000	6299000	Well, we'll see. We'll see. Also, one other story here. We mentioned earlier about Ubisoft and the Wii U, and we know that Ubisoft kind of pulled their support of the Wii U and ended up canceling a few titles in the process.
6299000	6308000	Well, some more information surfaced this week about what one of those Wii U titles was. It was actually a little bit of a party game. It was a game called Know Your Friends.
6308000	6323000	This was dug up this week, and it was a quiz game that was developed by Ubisoft Paris, and it sounds like it was kind of a spiritual successor of sorts to We Dare, because some of the questions were flirtatious and maybe inappropriate.
6323000	6327000	And by all means, I'm glad they cancelled it. It sounds fucking terrible.
6327000	6336000	Yeah, I think a lot of people were thinking like, oh man, Ubisoft cancelled Zombie U 2, they suck, but then you hear that they cancelled this, and you're like, oh, well maybe.
6336000	6338000	Assassin's Creed 4 on Wii U still?
6338000	6340000	I don't think it was, actually.
6343000	6352000	So there you go. In fact, I'm pretty sure it wasn't, because I think that was a lot of the rabble rabble from fans behind that because of that.
6352000	6356000	Anyhow, are we on 4 or 5? I don't even remember what the fucking Assassin's Creed were on that.
6356000	6360000	Wait, 4 is Black Flag. That was the last one, wasn't it?
6360000	6362000	I think Black Flag was that one.
6363000	6366000	Sorry, I can't keep track of them anymore.
6367000	6369000	Alright, Dark Sakura.
6369000	6377000	Well, if you are a fan of Shingeki no Kyojin, which is also Attack on Titan, Capcom's making an arcade game.
6377000	6380000	God, it's like arcade resurgence again.
6380000	6386000	I know. You get to get eaten by huge giants and hide behind walls.
6387000	6392000	Actually, the whole thing is I would love to see how they actually incorporate the 3D defense.
6392000	6396000	Yes, you should be able to strap into some sort of rig that kind of...
6396000	6398000	Yeah, that would be fun.
6398000	6404000	What if it was all that third, first person, or you had a motion control that showed up?
6404000	6407000	I can't imagine how awesome that game would be.
6407000	6416000	At any rate, Atlas USA is rumored on doing a localization to Nintendo 3DS of a game based off of the anime.
6416000	6418000	So, who knows?
6418000	6421000	I just wish we could get more anime because it was awesome.
6421000	6427000	I think the last thing I watched were those first two seasons of Attack on Titan and then I watched Kill la Kill.
6427000	6429000	Where is the second season?
6429000	6434000	Yeah, there were two seasons. Not localized.
6434000	6436000	Damn it.
6436000	6438000	I need the second season then.
6438000	6441000	I can't speak Japanese, so you know.
6441000	6443000	Sounds like Dark Soccer's offering to help you out over there.
6443000	6447000	No, I'll just... fine. Internet. We'll do it.
6447000	6449000	Internet!
6450000	6452000	Insert eye roll here.
6452000	6455000	It's okay. He won't stop and ask for directions either.
6455000	6459000	So, you know what? This is the big bullshit.
6459000	6471000	The whole transferring your old 3DS data to the new 3DS is really not so straightforward and people are complaining about it a lot.
6471000	6478000	And Nintendo finally is just like, look, this is how you do it. Here's a video. Get over it.
6478000	6486000	But it is worth noting that a lot of people are really fixated on the whole screwdriver, take the thing out and all this.
6486000	6492000	And you can also transfer over Wi-Fi. It just takes a long time to do it that way.
6492000	6494000	Do it overnight.
6494000	6496000	Or do it while you're listening to OLR, right?
6496000	6504000	But also I think one thing to consider is that if you have a big card in your DS now, you're gonna have to get a big card in the new 3DS.
6504000	6506000	And you're gonna have to buy a power supply.
6506000	6508000	Or you're gonna be doing the screwdriver trick.
6508000	6522000	So, it's a little... I mean, I think we live in a world where computers in the 1990s, I take a disk out of this computer and I put it in this computer and I can access everything on it.
6522000	6528000	And it's like, I think the fact that it's not that easy with Nintendo is what's blowing people's minds.
6528000	6535000	I don't understand why you have the microSD card hidden behind a compartment that requires a screwdriver to open it up.
6536000	6543000	As far as I'm aware, there are SD card slots that can do the microSD cards and...
6543000	6548000	The same reason there's no charger. Every nickel and dime.
6548000	6555000	Or it's still a proprietary charger instead of, I don't know, USB like every other fucking device on the planet.
6556000	6566000	Anyway, Mortal Kombat X, I wanna say 10 but it's X, is going to try to have more realistic portrayals of women.
6566000	6570000	While you're chopping body parts off and breaking faces and shit.
6570000	6578000	Unless, of course, those realistic portrayals of women include them being part B, in which case, yes, that is true.
6578000	6585000	Basically, they said that we always wanted to be realistic, you know, like really realistic I guess.
6585000	6592000	But they wanted to try to get proportions back to what would be on a normal athletic woman.
6592000	6599000	You know, not like overly too big boobs that would smack you in the face like dead or alive.
6599000	6606000	Cause I'm sorry, cause like, yes, the ginormous breasts are what they're gonna see in Mortal Kombat.
6606000	6613000	Not the, you know, doing an uppercut into someone's groin or perhaps, you know, breaking body parts in x-ray mode and stuff like that.
6613000	6617000	Or ripping someone in half. Yes, but it's the giant breasts that they'll notice.
6617000	6622000	I was looking at one of the renders on here. It looks like it's the one of Kitana.
6622000	6626000	And she does actually have like normal hips.
6626000	6637000	A normal, I'd probably say not like, it's still like a supermodel type of level of hip to waist ratio.
6637000	6640000	But it does look like an actual human being.
6640000	6646000	And not like impossibly tiny with huge hips and boobs to infinity.
6646000	6651000	Remember when they did have those proportions accurate because they were actual human beings?
6651000	6654000	Right? Back when they were like scanned people.
6654000	6665000	But you do have to see a little bit of irony in this game that's like we're not being overly sexual when it is the most over the top violent gore fest thing that's out there.
6665000	6670000	You have to see a little bit of humor in that.
6670000	6673000	It's the society we live in cause God forbid you show a little bit of nipple.
6673000	6680000	But ripping someone in half and, you know, severing their body parts all over the place, that's okay.
6680000	6687000	And the reason why I bring that up is that I do love the Mortal Kombat series and all its goofy, ridiculous, over the top violence fun.
6687000	6692000	But I don't like movies like Saw and things like that. I've mentioned this before on the show.
6692000	6699000	But like with Mortal Kombat X there's a lot of where I'm looking at going like, okay, this is starting to look a little too real for me.
6699000	6704000	And I don't know if I'm down with this anymore. I liked it when it was stupid, you know?
6704000	6709000	And I don't know. I have feelings, Darkstalker. I have a lot of feelings about Mortal Kombat X. Do you have feelings?
6709000	6715000	Feelings. Oh.
6715000	6717000	I'll take that as a no.
6717000	6721000	Alright, let's get to the FUGL question of the week.
6721000	6726000	Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities and you give us answers.
6726000	6728000	It's my vehicle.
6729000	6742000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio or Google.com slash Plus Orange Lounge Radio is the place where you can hit us up on social media.
6742000	6749000	And this week we asked a question of our communities inspired by our guests tonight as we usually try to do when we have guests on the show.
6749000	6757000	We asked about with Star Mazer being this point and click and shoot them up gameplay that has really impressive pixel art in the game.
6757000	6763000	We thought, you know, this has us thinking about gorgeous pixel art in some games made out of pixels.
6763000	6770000	Maybe retro, maybe modern, you know, because a game like Star Mazer is modern but still has that retro pixel look.
6770000	6776000	So what is some of your favorite pixel art from across the years and years of gaming?
6776000	6784000	Guillermo R starts us off tonight on Facebook saying the Neo Geo in general served tons of amazing pixel art.
6784000	6790000	The Metal Slug series truly shines by pairing gorgeous, humorous sprites with fluid animation.
6790000	6794000	The upcoming Hyper Light Drifter looks damn beautiful as well.
6794000	6798000	I'm sure Dark Sakura would back that response up. I know she's a Neo Geo fan as well.
6798000	6800000	I loves my Neo Geo.
6800000	6803000	Just play Samurai Showdown, that's all.
6803000	6807000	Rage Nator says I don't have a single favorite but four that are basically tied.
6807000	6816000	Metal Slug, Neo Geo, Samurai Showdown 4, Neo Geo, Super Castlevania 4, Super Nintendo, and Actraiser, Super Nintendo.
6816000	6821000	All four are gorgeous, have great sound, and are a blast to play.
6821000	6828000	Surping Slurpee responds and says Final Fantasy, both old school and new, never fails to impress.
6828000	6832000	I have also found Sonic the Hedgehog games aesthetically pleasing.
6832000	6837000	Our answer is over on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio.
6837000	6841000	Let's head on over to our Google Plus page and look at some of the answers there,
6841000	6847000	which I notice is getting closer and closer the number of responses we get on Google versus Facebook.
6847000	6850000	We actually had the same number of comments on Google tonight we did on Facebook.
6850000	6855000	I think that's because Facebook just basically doesn't show posts unless we pay to show them,
6855000	6859000	which don't get me started on that, but a little.
6859000	6865000	So I do urge you, if you want to answer the question each week, make sure you visit our Facebook page directly,
6865000	6871000	because I can't really afford to throw $20 at Facebook to boost every post.
6871000	6874000	I'd rather use that money somewhere else for the show.
6874000	6881000	Weird that we have to pay them to have the posts that we put to our community shown.
6881000	6882000	I know, right?
6882000	6885000	Yet those ads that they want us to see, oh.
6885000	6888000	Anyway, over on Google Plus, some of the answers over there.
6888000	6891000	Ronnie B. saying, Minecraft.
6891000	6897000	Certainly a very contemporary choice that probably owes a lot of its success to its art style.
6897000	6903000	Reddertainment says, MissNudeWorld96.
6903000	6905000	Oh, you.
6905000	6907000	And lastly, PrincePeachFuzz.
6907000	6908000	I do love that name.
6908000	6914000	PrincePeachFuzz replies and says, two of my favorites would be KingOfFighters13 and Metalslug2.
6914000	6917000	You know, I've got to say, for a frugal question of the week tonight,
6917000	6921000	I was not expecting, but I'm not surprised by, the amount of Neo Geo love there.
6921000	6926000	I mean, like, literally half the answers all had some type of Neo Geo game mentioned in there, so.
6926000	6927000	Very cool.
6927000	6932000	Quickly around the room, any pixel art in games that you just, you really are fond of?
6932000	6933000	Pixel art.
6933000	6936000	More recently, To The Moon.
6936000	6940000	That one's very, just, pretty overall.
6940000	6944000	Really harkens back to the look for Final Fantasy VI.
6944000	6949000	And it's really just a great story in pixel form.
6949000	6954000	I would actually throw out there, you know, some of my favorite was from the Super Nintendo era,
6954000	6958000	and I really loved, you know, again, maybe this is just my fan wank for this game,
6958000	6960000	but The Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past.
6960000	6966000	It was such a different aesthetic at the time than I think we were seeing in a lot of Super Nintendo games.
6966000	6968000	So, I mean, the pixel art in that game is just amazing.
6968000	6971000	And honestly, if you want to talk about a true Super Nintendo classic,
6971000	6974000	look at essentially the very first game they ever put out on it.
6974000	6981000	Super Mario World, I think, to this day, holds up as some of the pinnacle of pixel art that's out there today.
6981000	6982000	Those are some of my choices.
6982000	6983000	Loki?
6983000	6989000	Well, I'm a huge fan of Paul Robinson, and so I have to go with Scott Pilgrim.
6989000	6990000	Oh, okay.
6990000	6994000	That was, it's just awesome.
6995000	7002000	Along with that, it's not really pixel art, but, I don't know, Journey, that was pretty good.
7002000	7004000	Yeah, it's not really pixel art.
7004000	7005000	You're cheating.
7005000	7007000	Broforce, I like Broforce.
7007000	7008000	Astol.
7008000	7009000	Oh.
7009000	7018000	And actually the 3DO slash Saturn era of, I would say, of pixel games.
7018000	7021000	I mean, look at Symphony of the Night.
7021000	7022000	Yeah, true.
7022000	7027000	All the character designs on that, and all of the 3D elements weren't so great on the Saturn,
7027000	7034000	but any of the pixel era games that were on Saturn were absolutely amazing,
7034000	7038000	because it was built to do 2D better than anything else at the time.
7038000	7039000	True.
7039000	7044000	Great answers from around the room and from around the internet over on Facebook and Google.
7044000	7045000	Let's get back into some news.
7045000	7046000	Loki?
7046000	7048000	All right.
7048000	7056000	So there was a little bit of funny business going on with Greenlight, and I guess I kind of understand why,
7056000	7064000	but they've basically, Valve has put a stop to people using incentives like giving out free keys
7064000	7068000	if you back them on Steam Greenlight to get their game pushed through.
7068000	7073000	So a lot of the times it was, oh, hey, if you back our game and our game gets pushed through,
7073000	7075000	we'll go ahead and give you a free key for it.
7075000	7084000	Well, they didn't like that sort of manipulation, so they're going to be not allowing that anymore.
7084000	7090000	Yeah, I don't even understand, like, where's the money to be made then if you keep giving away the game for free?
7090000	7094000	Well, the money to be made is that you can't sell it on Steam until it passes Greenlight,
7094000	7098000	so if you get enough people to back you, then you're going to be able to do that.
7098000	7100000	But then you gave it to all those people for free.
7100000	7102000	It doesn't matter, though.
7102000	7105000	So you gave it to a few people for free, gets the word out about your game.
7105000	7107000	Yeah, so it's the inertia.
7107000	7112000	Yeah, well, you can't sell it on Steam until you're on Steam.
7112000	7119000	Basically, they were saying, when you gave away copies in exchange for votes, you put us in a really uncomfortable position.
7119000	7123000	We do not think these votes accurately reflect the customer's interest,
7123000	7128000	and it makes our job harder in deciding which games customers would actually buy on Steam.
7128000	7135000	Additionally, when you give away copies of your games for votes, then every other developer on Greenlight thinks that's the thing they need to do to get noticed.
7135000	7140000	And we don't think that is healthy for our system, really what the consumer wants.
7140000	7145000	So, I'm glad that they addressed that.
7145000	7151000	Yeah, it definitely sounds like something that needed to get shut down, so I was surprised it took this long to happen,
7151000	7154000	but I guess probably finally just won too many of these campaigns.
7154000	7161000	Well, yeah, it sucks, because they already have a quality control issue, I think, with some of the games on Steam anyways,
7161000	7168000	and it wouldn't help that this is what you're going to have to do to get your game through. I don't know.
7168000	7174000	Alright, well, I like these stories where we hear some good news, some feel-good news coming out of the gaming industry,
7174000	7180000	and I think this is really cool. Sony is launching what's called PlayStation Heroes.
7180000	7187000	It's a PlayStation 4 app that encourages you to make charitable contributions to charities like Make-A-Wish,
7187000	7191000	the V Foundation for Cancer Research, USO.
7191000	7197000	What you do, you're going to pay between $1, $15, and you get a dynamic game theme.
7197000	7200000	Or you can pay $20 and you get a 4-theme bundle.
7200000	7209000	And this money will actually go to these causes, and you get an entry, essentially, into this contest to play games with a celebrity.
7209000	7214000	So you could actually play Shaun White, the snowboarder in Destiny.
7214000	7220000	You could, this would be awesome, you could play Snoop Dogg in a game.
7220000	7225000	That would be, oh my god, how high would he be doing that? That would be so much fun.
7225000	7227000	And one of the Dodgers.
7227000	7231000	Can you play Ice-T in Call of Duty? Because that would be pretty awesome.
7231000	7238000	So, yeah, the app is not going live until February 24th, but you can pre-order the app now if you want.
7238000	7247000	That's a really clever idea. You know, it's a neat little spin on when Blizzard for World of Warcraft would sell the pet in-game,
7247000	7249000	where all the money would go to charity.
7249000	7252000	And I think a lot of people really liked participating in that.
7252000	7255000	They tend to do those about once a year.
7255000	7263000	So I think this is a neat little spin on that, and certainly justifies the, you know, $4 for a theme or what have you,
7263000	7266000	if you know the money is going to a good cause. I think that's really cool.
7266000	7268000	DarkSakura.
7268000	7275000	Well, you know, we like to sort of poke a little bit at Zynga, because honestly, they deserve it.
7275000	7291000	There is an analyst out there who is calling for Don Mattrick to resign, because it was actually done by BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield,
7292000	7301000	said that it's a good idea for him to resign, because their earnings have just been absolutely dreadful.
7301000	7305000	He says, your strategy appears to be all over the place.
7305000	7309000	Your core franchises have and continue to generate meaningful earnings,
7309000	7317000	yet that is not completely offset by your attempts to find the next hit games in categories where Zynga has no underlying expertise.
7317000	7327000	Yeah, they've basically lost $45 million last fourth quarter, bringing their total year losses to $226 million.
7327000	7332000	Yet, Mattrick says it's a year of progress. What is your definition of progress?
7332000	7338000	I think it's one of those companies where it just, it was too much, too fast, you know,
7338000	7345000	with FarmVille being really the first breakaway, OMG crazy Facebook game.
7345000	7350000	But I think we're kind of learning that, you know, any company can kind of get that success.
7350000	7355000	Now what is everybody playing on Facebook? It's that fucking trivia crack, and even I'm sucked into that.
7355000	7360000	It's on Android and iOS as well, and it ties into Facebook. Trivia crack, have you guys played that?
7360000	7363000	That's kind of like the new big thing right now.
7363000	7369000	No, but it's funny though, when I first heard you talking about it, I thought you were just referring to it as trivia crack.
7369000	7373000	No, it is actually called trivia crack, is the name of the game, which is hilarious,
7373000	7378000	because it's really just a straight up trivia game, it doesn't even make like drug jokes or whatever,
7378000	7382000	but all the questions are crowdsourced, which is part of what makes it very interesting.
7382000	7387000	But anyhow, all that talk aside, you know, Zynga hasn't really had that, you know,
7387000	7391000	they're not coming up with these games, other people are doing it,
7391000	7395000	and I think that's part of why they're probably hurting a little bit.
7395000	7400000	I still don't understand why Don Mattrick would have left Microsoft to do that,
7400000	7405000	although maybe, you know, things at Microsoft have kind of, I hate to say it,
7405000	7408000	but things at Microsoft have been looking up since he left,
7408000	7411000	and they've got a different guy in charge now who's got a very different approach,
7411000	7417000	and a lot of people seem to like it, so yeah, I don't know, I don't know what to say about that, it's tricky.
7417000	7423000	So, looking at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster says,
7423000	7427000	King actually had a good quarter. Yeah, interesting call,
7427000	7433000	King, of course, the makers of Candy Crush Saga, which, you know, I'm not really a fan,
7433000	7438000	but that's still going, you know, they had the sequel come out,
7438000	7443000	and I saw the arcade machine, and I think I saw my brain from rolling my eyes so hard,
7443000	7452000	but I get the feeling Candy Crush is really big with, like, kids and teens right now in that audience,
7452000	7455000	so, you know, that might be part of what's contributing to that.
7455000	7459000	Dungeon Buster in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com with a comment on Zynga,
7459000	7464000	saying, right now Zynga looks like a rudderless ship, they were trying to get into online gambling,
7464000	7466000	but that hasn't panned out for them.
7466000	7471000	Alright, well, we'll see if he can turn it around in the next year, but I don't know.
7471000	7474000	Maybe we'll have a merge, and we'll have King Nami.
7475000	7480000	Bite your tongue. Loki, quick, change the topic.
7480000	7485000	Alright, fortunately I'm not going to change it to a good topic, because that would just not be me,
7485000	7491000	but EA, they've had a few layoffs over at EA Montreal,
7491000	7497000	and basically saying that a small number of people have been laid off due to some staffing changes,
7497000	7502000	basically to line with their current development and service plans,
7502000	7506000	and a small number of employees were impacted, and they are working closely with each of them
7506000	7509000	to ensure the best transition possible.
7509000	7515000	And so the teams at EA Montreal, including BioWare, are working on exciting new projects, blah, blah, blah.
7515000	7521000	So, it's unfortunate, but at least it wasn't a ton of people, apparently.
7521000	7523000	But they didn't mention numbers, so.
7523000	7526000	But that happens from time to time, I don't know.
7526000	7531000	Yeah, still never fun to report on layoffs, but hopefully the gaming industry will rally around these guys,
7531000	7534000	you know, as we've had other layoffs stories happen.
7534000	7539000	I don't remember if it was this week or last week, but it's worth mentioning that, you know,
7539000	7544000	I think it was last week when Sony Online Entertainment is no longer Sony, right?
7544000	7546000	And they're now the Daybreak.
7546000	7549000	And they were like, oh, nothing's going to change, it's business as usual.
7549000	7552000	Well then, huge layoffs happened there.
7552000	7557000	And like, one of the big mouthpieces behind EverQuest was one of the people laid off.
7557000	7561000	And so it's, you know, always kind of sad to see.
7561000	7564000	But when those layoffs happened at least, Twitter was really like, you know,
7564000	7570000	even Blizzard was out there going, hey, if you were impacted, check out Blizzard Careers and get in touch, you know.
7570000	7574000	So, hopefully these folks are able to find placement somewhere else real quick,
7574000	7577000	because it's always a bummer to hear about this stuff.
7577000	7579000	Alright, moving on.
7579000	7582000	So, what's old is new again.
7582000	7583000	This is really cool.
7583000	7587000	Castlevania, you know, you brought up Symphony of the Night earlier in the show,
7587000	7593000	but without the original OG Castlevania game, not quite going back as far as Vampire Hunter,
7593000	7598000	but pretty much Castlevania, going all the way back to what started it all.
7598000	7601000	Castlevania has been ported to the Spectrum.
7601000	7607000	That's right, the ZX Spectrum now has a Castlevania port.
7607000	7609000	That is so awesome.
7609000	7614000	They actually, this guy actually ported, it kind of looks really rough around the edges,
7614000	7616000	especially the Simon Belmont sprite.
7616000	7619000	But, you know, the Spectrum could only handle so much, right?
7619000	7628000	No release date here as of yet, but it will have Castlevania style music, some improved detailed graphics.
7628000	7630000	They didn't really have the Spectrum over here anyway.
7630000	7634000	Exactly, well, yeah, but there's still a lot of love for it online, you know, people developing for it.
7634000	7640000	And it's going to be fully English translated and so forth, so that's really cool.
7640000	7642000	That's neat.
7642000	7646000	So that's something that's going to be coming out on the internet, and you can check that out.
7646000	7650000	More details at worldofspectrum.org.
7650000	7652000	So, cool.
7652000	7657000	It sounds like they kind of have some different stuff than what you might remember from Castlevania on the NES.
7657000	7661000	Well, because it was Akuma Joel Dracula.
7661000	7662000	Right.
7662000	7665000	Alright, let's get into tonight's mailbag.
7665000	7667000	Every week you guys send us emails.
7667000	7670000	Participate at orangelaunchradio.com.
7670000	7671000	Or maybe you don't.
7671000	7673000	Do we have any emails tonight at our soccer?
7673000	7675000	Yeah, we do, because only one person emails us every week now.
7675000	7677000	Only one person loves us?
7677000	7678000	There's only one.
7678000	7680000	There can be only one, alright.
7680000	7682000	Well, who is our biggest fan that sent us an email?
7682000	7683000	YYR.
7683000	7685000	We love YYR, he's the best.
7685000	7686000	Yes.
7686000	7687000	Hello, LR.
7687000	7690000	Was hoping to listen live tonight, but then stuff happened.
7690000	7692000	Well, fuck that stuff.
7692000	7694000	What, the Saturday Night Live special?
7694000	7695000	Eh.
7695000	7697000	You know they're going to sell that on DVD and have it on Netflix.
7697000	7698000	Mmm.
7698000	7700000	Judging all of you watching live.
7700000	7702000	It's their 40th anniversary was tonight.
7702000	7703000	But.
7703000	7704000	There is one thing though.
7704000	7706000	Do you think it's going to be funny again?
7706000	7707000	No, it'll be on Netflix.
7707000	7709000	That I really wanted to know your collective thoughts on.
7709000	7714000	Tonight I'm pretty sure you'll have covered Sega's recent financial woes and downsizing announcement.
7714000	7716000	That is just sad to me.
7716000	7721000	Having played the arcade exclusive Let's Go Island and the recent Project Diva titles,
7721000	7724000	I know that they're still capable of making fun games.
7724000	7726000	Let's Go Island is actually really fun.
7726000	7729000	And I do just want to clarify, we did address this last week.
7729000	7731000	It actually came up on last week's show, so.
7731000	7734000	But obviously not everything they've released lately has been quality.
7734000	7736000	Man, Let's Go Island though is super fun.
7736000	7738000	It's a messed up game.
7738000	7740000	But then you have the new Sonic game which was.
7740000	7741000	This week.
7741000	7742000	No.
7742000	7748000	I came across an editorial on the internet this week, being redundant.
7748000	7750000	Sonic the Hedgehog needs to die.
7750000	7754000	The piece argued that Sonic the Hedgehog isn't relevant anymore.
7754000	7757000	That there haven't been any truly great Sonic games in many years.
7757000	7760000	That Sega just plain lost their way with the series.
7760000	7764000	And that it should either end here or go on extended hiatus.
7764000	7770000	The writer notes of the fact that the new Mario games are still fun to play because Nintendo takes what works from previous games.
7770000	7774000	And uses those elements again, rather than Sega reinventing the wheel each time.
7774000	7777000	Ditching even the good things about previous games.
7777000	7784000	Hell, I never thought they would outsource their flagship character to an outside developer.
7784000	7785000	This is a mess.
7785000	7790000	As ridiculous as it sounds, I actually think there's some merit to this idea.
7790000	7794000	The average gamer just doesn't seem to trust the brand to deliver a fun experience anymore.
7794000	7798000	I recall the Sega of the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s.
7798000	7802000	The Sega that cranked out one fun game after another, both in arcades and at home.
7802000	7805000	And wonder if we'll ever see anything like that ever again.
7805000	7811000	The closest thing I see to that now is the line of Sega 3D classics being released on 3DS.
7811000	7816000	Fantasy Zone came out this week, and it is an absolutely great game. Of course it is because it's Fantasy Zone.
7816000	7817000	I need to get that.
7817000	7819000	It's a bit punishing at times.
7819000	7826000	But I digress. What do you guys think of the idea of Sega putting their mascot in time out for a while, feeling a bit blue, Aaron Yyr?
7826000	7830000	I think that they, I don't know, they did the same thing with Tomb Raider.
7830000	7835000	There was a lot of bad, well not bad, but not really good Tomb Raider games for a while.
7835000	7838000	And they kept rebooting that series over and over and over again.
7838000	7839000	And finally they got it right.
7839000	7843000	I just think the problem is they don't listen to their criticism.
7843000	7847000	What they're trying to do is they're trying to make it accessible for a new audience.
7847000	7852000	That's why they're trying to do this beat-em-up type style gameplay.
7852000	7855000	But no one fucking wants to play that.
7855000	7858000	They want to play Sonic the Hedgehog because Sonic runs fast.
7858000	7863000	They want to continue to play Sonic the Hedgehog on the Sega Genesis basically.
7864000	7869000	Even with Sonic Generations or whatever, I don't remember if that was the one with the stupid Werehog mode.
7869000	7872000	But the 3D running scenes, good.
7872000	7874000	The Werehog mode, crap.
7874000	7876000	So what do they do for Sonic Boom?
7876000	7879000	Hey, let's bring back the Werehog mode because people fucking love that.
7879000	7883000	And let's give Sonic some more friends and let's make him look all fucked up looking.
7883000	7887000	It's like, who came up with these ideas? It's stupid.
7887000	7891000	And that's the problem, they don't understand why their game's failing.
7891000	7893000	That's why your game's failing.
7893000	7896000	You know how you're going to reach a new demographic?
7896000	7900000	It's by making the game good to where people are like, oh, you should totally play this.
7900000	7902000	Kids are going to play a game if it's fun.
7902000	7905000	They're not going to play a game because it's edgier.
7905000	7911000	I don't know what you think makes a successful kids franchise. I don't know.
7911000	7916000	Well, it's like if you take Sonic Generations when it came out, you know what the fun parts of that game were?
7916000	7918000	Playing old-school Sonic.
7918000	7921000	The rest of it, you could give or take, it was more Sonic Colors.
7921000	7925000	But now I'm worried that with these layoffs, what Sega is going to become,
7925000	7927000	and I think this is part of what we talked about last week,
7927000	7932000	is that it's just basically going to be old-school Genesis games on mobile phones.
7932000	7934000	And like old-school, like, yay, people want to play.
7934000	7937000	But now it's all mobile and all this.
7937000	7939000	It's okay, we don't need Sonic.
7939000	7943000	Because there always is a chance to bring back Jazz the Jackrabbit.
7943000	7947000	We did have the toe-jamming Earl thing not that long ago. That's the thing.
7947000	7949000	You know what I think is honestly going to happen with YYR?
7949000	7954000	I think sometimes there's a phoenix that rises up from the ashes,
7954000	7956000	and we see this happen in gaming a lot,
7956000	7959000	and especially with the Kickstarter world that we live in now.
7959000	7963000	And you've seen this happen with Mega Man, and now we're even seeing it.
7963000	7966000	Maybe this banjo-kazooie thing is going to go to Kickstarter. I don't know.
7966000	7975000	But I would think that maybe some of these people with the layoffs might go forth and create something new.
7975000	7978000	You know, we were joking about Sanic the Hodgehog type of thing,
7978000	7988000	but I think there's going to be those developers that leave to make the game that they want to make.
7988000	7990000	The Mighty No. 9 to the Mega Man.
7990000	7994000	Exactly. And I think that's what's ultimately probably going to happen in this.
7994000	7997000	Does Sega need to walk away from Sonic completely?
7997000	8000000	Not necessarily. I think it's more they just need to...
8000000	8003000	How are they really using him is what it's about.
8003000	8008000	Well, they're trying to spin off the brand into a TV show and stuff like that,
8008000	8010000	and maybe they'll get more people following it.
8010000	8011000	Which is awful.
8011000	8016000	But let's be honest, the quality of game that they're trying to tie in with these TV shows aren't exactly great.
8016000	8020000	Skylanders is okay, I guess, but I don't see that as a...
8020000	8023000	I don't know. Personally, I don't see that as a big, strong brand.
8023000	8026000	If it didn't have the collectible figure part of it...
8026000	8027000	Oh yeah, I was going to say.
8027000	8031000	No, if it didn't have the collectible figure part of it, I don't think anyone would give a shit about Skylanders.
8031000	8035000	Let's get to some comments from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
8035000	8040000	Rama says, Sega is going to end up like Sunsoft, closing shop in the US and pushing out mobile titles.
8040000	8047000	Tigerclaw says, I think the problem people have with Sonic is that they expect that sense of speed like in the original games.
8047000	8054000	Sonic today is more platform-y, and they want the games to play like the originals.
8054000	8058000	Dungeonbuster points out, Sega's other devs are actually doing pretty good, though.
8058000	8063000	Alien Isolation passed 1.7 million sold, if I recall correctly.
8063000	8068000	Seattle asks, what the fuck did they do to Knuckles?
8068000	8075000	S2 Hunter Matt says, I remember running out and getting Conker's bad fur day as a kid because it was edgy and raunchy.
8075000	8080000	Ragenator says, for the record, I support Sega and have been buying their games.
8080000	8083000	Rama going on as a follow-up to Tigerclaw's comment saying,
8084000	8089000	The old schoolers need to understand that there is a change, and the old school gamers aren't the majority anymore.
8089000	8094000	The games are going to get geared towards a newer, broader generation, even though it won't work all the time.
8107000	8109000	Porque no los dos?
8114000	8117000	If that game was successful, and I just didn't like it, then that's fine.
8117000	8120000	Then everything has changed.
8120000	8123000	There's a lot of successful games I don't like, a lot of sports games.
8123000	8127000	If it was successful and I just didn't like it, then that's fine, then whatever.
8127000	8133000	But it just didn't sell well either, so it's not that everything's changed,
8133000	8138000	it's just that they decided, I don't know, that they wanted to go this direction with it.
8138000	8142000	It's just not working for them, and they've tried it several times and it just hasn't worked for them.
8142000	8147000	So maybe you should go back and look at what made your game good in the first place, and stick there.
8147000	8152000	And how about, here's my free advice to you, stop giving him more fucking friends!
8152000	8155000	Nobody likes Sonic's goddamn friends.
8155000	8158000	They came for Sonic the Hedgehog, not friends with Sonic the Hedgehog.
8158000	8161000	No, no, no, they need to do the Amy Rose spin-off.
8162000	8165000	Amy goes around beating shit up with her hammer.
8165000	8170000	If Amy is going to murder all the other Sonic friends, then I'm fine with that.
8170000	8175000	We need to get fucking George R.R. Martin in on this shit to fucking get it.
8175000	8180000	Just dial down to pure Sonic the Hedgehog, and I think we've got something there.
8180000	8183000	You know what, I have to say, I love Knuckles.
8183000	8185000	I love Knuckles.
8185000	8187000	Yeah, but not new Knuckles.
8187000	8191000	Not that over-roided shit thing.
8191000	8195000	Sorry, the George R.R. Martin comment has me just cracking the hell up, that's great.
8195000	8200000	Alright, so I guess that's the answer to Y.Y.R.'s question.
8200000	8202000	We need George R.R. Martin to fix it.
8202000	8206000	You know, in about 50 years, whenever he actually writes a book.
8206000	8208000	Oh god, alright.
8210000	8212000	There it is, that's our mailbag tonight.
8212000	8214000	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
8214000	8217000	Every week we like to give our little rants on our show.
8217000	8220000	Why? Because tradition.
8220000	8223000	We get upset sometimes, and have to vent a few things.
8226000	8229000	Oh, this is bad.
8229000	8231000	Here is justice.
8231000	8233000	Here is punishment.
8233000	8235000	Here.
8235000	8237000	This is fucked up.
8239000	8246000	Um, FU to the little bit of a headache I have right now, and FU to my hip.
8246000	8249000	Um, I'm too young for this shit.
8250000	8253000	But if you get a cane, look on the bright side.
8253000	8256000	Look on the bright side. We can go to Disneyland and cut all the lines.
8256000	8261000	I'm gonna shake it at people, tell us because you get the fuck off my lawn, and yell at clouds.
8263000	8266000	Well, we're all hoping it's nothing too serious.
8266000	8268000	That if you do have a cane, it's temporary.
8268000	8273000	Wouldn't it be awesome if I have to come in like in a half body cast or something?
8273000	8274000	No.
8274000	8279000	If I have to have surgery, and then I can just say, I'll be sitting here with a tub of pinkberry, and my cane.
8279000	8280000	No.
8280000	8286000	Then you'll be the one Skyping into the show for six months like he had to do last year, so.
8286000	8292000	To go ahead and let people know, I was in a car accident, two car accidents a few years ago.
8292000	8299000	And screwed up my hip, and I just, I made the stupid mistake of not really getting it taken care of properly.
8299000	8304000	And my doctors were just like, oh, it'll be fine. Do this physical therapy.
8304000	8310000	So I do put part of the responsibility on them, although I should have been more proactive, I think.
8310000	8316000	And I've been going to a chiropractor regularly, but my hip has actually been getting progressively worse.
8316000	8322000	And now it's pretty much where it hurts all the time in a wealth of lengths, so, yeah.
8322000	8328000	Well, we have a mutual friend who's also, you know, not an old man by any means, who had to have like a similar surgery.
8328000	8333000	And he was out for a little while, but he's pretty much out and about now, like nothing else, so.
8333000	8340000	So, um, they said low-end it could be bursitis, high-end it could be surgery, but whatever happens, I'll just deal with it.
8340000	8342000	Uh, Loki.
8342000	8345000	I'm just gonna mention it, just because I'm disappointed.
8345000	8354000	I was a pretty big fan of the show, and I just, I can't understand what it is with, you know, not even necessarily Law & Order,
8354000	8357000	because a lot of these cop drama shows just do it.
8357000	8363000	And I'm not even talking necessarily about the gaming things, why is it that fucking TV shows can't do technology correctly?
8363000	8368000	And I understand that, yes, your audience might not be in tune with like lingo and stuff like that,
8368000	8371000	but it was so fucking retarded that it was insulting.
8371000	8374000	Like, just to anybody that has any intellect at all.
8374000	8378000	I just don't understand how this is a thing.
8378000	8380000	So, that's it.
8380000	8385000	And to end to this stupid cop that won't fucking go away, it's been like four weeks now, and I need this fucking cop to go away.
8385000	8387000	It's like, annoying.
8387000	8390000	Uh, my F.U. of the week goes to my voice.
8390000	8395000	Even though I don't regret my short-lived retirement, and I'm sure I'm going to be the butt of the joke of all my friends,
8395000	8401000	that I couldn't stop doing it, even though I retired, I don't regret that at all,
8401000	8404000	but I do regret maybe that I had to yell a little bit too much.
8404000	8412000	And F.U. to the computer that plays the movie for freezing up, and it had to be rebooted, like as the movie was about to start,
8412000	8415000	so I had to go on stage and basically fill time for ten minutes.
8415000	8421000	So, I want to say thank you to these podcasts where I've been basically, with all due respect,
8421000	8425000	BSing for three hours a night here, and an hour on Hoard House, and whatever side projects I do.
8425000	8428000	You know, that has given me the skill to improv a little bit,
8428000	8434000	because last night, I had to fill like ten, fifteen minutes of time in an audience of five hundred people.
8434000	8440000	And here, I don't have to look at you, but there, they were looking right at me, and you got hecklers and everything,
8440000	8446000	but thank God for this podcast. So, F.U. to that computer for freezing up and putting me on the spot last night.
8446000	8451000	But I had a lot of fun, and I wouldn't, I don't get to do that type of stuff enough.
8451000	8456000	It's a real bummer, I like never get to do that stuff in the gaming world and so forth,
8456000	8460000	but I really love doing it over in Colt Cinema, doing the hosting and all that stuff.
8460000	8467000	So, yeah, but F.U. to my voice for maybe pushing it a little too much last night, having fun.
8467000	8470000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then we're going to get to our phone calls.
8470000	8476000	1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. Loki.
8476000	8482000	Yes, so, this is kind of cool. Even though you may not necessarily own a Vita or PlayStation TV,
8482000	8491000	or even certain types of Xperia mobile phones from Sony, you will still be able to do remote plays if you have an Android device.
8492000	8498000	And this is because they have taken the Android app that runs on these Xperia phones
8498000	8503000	and have hacked it in a way to allow it to run on several Android devices.
8503000	8508000	So now you can play PlayStation 4 games and remote play them on there.
8508000	8511000	You can actually sync it up with there.
8511000	8516000	They also have, I guess, different ways you can do this.
8516000	8522000	I guess you can connect a DualShock 3 or DualShock 4 to the phones as well, which you're going to need an app for that.
8522000	8526000	And, of course, you're going to need to root your phone to allow that to work.
8526000	8530000	But the thing that's pretty sweet that they're going to have you do that,
8530000	8535000	and that combined with just the stuff that they announced for Windows 10 and things,
8535000	8539000	I'm looking forward to be able to play more stuff remotely.
8539000	8544000	Although, I don't think my phone's going to run this because my phone has enough trouble just loading a picture,
8544000	8549000	let alone running my PlayStation 4 streaming over Wi-Fi.
8549000	8552000	I just don't think that's going to be a thing.
8552000	8557000	But hopefully, even though this is kind of a hack right now,
8557000	8564000	hopefully they do have some sort of wide support for it coming soon, maybe officially.
8564000	8568000	Although, I guess they want to sell some Vita's.
8568000	8574000	Yeah, if you take away one of the biggest reasons why people are buying Vita's, then, you know, for this remote play.
8574000	8578000	I don't know. It's pretty cool, though. I'd be curious to see how well it works.
8578000	8580000	Yeah. Dark Soccer, you have something?
8580000	8584000	Well, yeah. This is actually a little something I might have mentioned earlier.
8584000	8588000	But there is going to be a Final Fantasy VII symphony concert in Tokyo this summer.
8588000	8589000	Oh, cool.
8589000	8594000	It's going to be on June 21st. It will be the first of Game Symphony Japan concert series.
8594000	8600000	And it will be the one to feature music by Uematsu.
8600000	8605000	And it's going to be all Final Fantasy VII, including one winged angel.
8605000	8608000	With a full choir and everything? I mean, that's the way to do it, right?
8608000	8618000	Yeah. And looking at where this is going to be held, it looks like it's going to be at the Suntory Hall in Akaska.
8618000	8623000	So, go. I want people to be there and cover it for us.
8624000	8628000	All right. Well, let's go to one more story tonight.
8628000	8633000	And this is about Nintendo and mobile phones. That's right.
8633000	8636000	That day might have finally come here.
8636000	8639000	Okay, no, no. We're not jumping to conclusions that big.
8639000	8642000	But there is some very interesting movement happening here.
8642000	8650000	And that is some comments from Satoru Iwata this week talking about Miis on mobile devices.
8650000	8656000	Quote, it would be fun for players to use their Mii characters as icons on social media.
8656000	8660000	We are currently developing an application that will allow users to do that.
8660000	8674000	So it sounds like, potentially, maybe Nintendo is working on something that would just allow you to import your Mii onto your mobile phone so you could save a picture and use it as your Facebook picture, your Twitter picture.
8674000	8681000	Funny enough, I actually use mine on Twitch. If you go to my Twitch channel, and I swear this isn't just a cheap plug,
8681000	8689000	but if you go to my Twitch channel at twitch.tv slash robroberts, I actually use my Mii as my little profile picture because I thought, boom, it's appropriate.
8689000	8696000	How? No, it's not impossible. You don't need a mobile phone because Miiverse is on the internet.
8696000	8701000	So I went to one of my Miiverse posts and what does it have? It has your little Mii face next to it.
8701000	8705000	So I basically jacked the picture from Miiverse and used that as my profile picture.
8705000	8712000	Did they ever release Miiverse as an app? I didn't think they did.
8712000	8716000	I know it's like a mobile-friendly website.
8716000	8719000	And they're making an app, so that's what the app will do.
8719000	8722000	The tech saying, go to Miiverse and download it.
8747000	8752000	Loki, you might be having mic problems over there. I don't think they all heard the call.
8752000	8754000	Sorry, the switch keeps sliding.
8754000	8756000	Oh, is that mic breaking? Do we need to get you to do it?
8756000	8757000	No, it's fine.
8757000	8759000	Alright. Stop fucking with it and it won't break.
8759000	8760000	Sorry, I...
8760000	8761000	I know habit.
8761000	8763000	I'd rather not cough into the mic.
8763000	8764000	Oh, fair enough.
8764000	8768000	Alright. Live radio, guys. Sorry, we are...
8768000	8773000	And I don't always see the audio live because I'm always looking at chat or I'm looking at the story I'm trying to read,
8773000	8776000	so my eyes are not always on the audio, so sometimes I miss it.
8776000	8781000	Anyhow, that was it for Stories, though. That Mi Mobile app was the last thing I had.
8781000	8785000	So we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line over at 1877-GAME-OLR.
8785000	8790000	Our username on Skype is orangeloungeradio, if you want to give us a call.
8790000	8795000	I will mention this for Last Minute Stories tonight. Tigerclaw sent me this link here.
8795000	8796000	I do want to mention this.
8796000	8799000	And this is something I remember reading about earlier in this week, too,
8799000	8805000	but that the TV service on the Wii U is going to be going away in Europe.
8805000	8808000	TV is not going to be happening in Europe anymore.
8808000	8811000	It sounds like it was just too hard.
8811000	8818000	It's a little more complicated in Europe when you have all these countries and programming schedules and so forth.
8818000	8822000	It just wasn't really worth it to try and put that all together.
8822000	8828000	So TV in Europe going away, but probably hardly anyone was using it anyway. I don't know.
8828000	8830000	But anyway, the phones are lighting up, so let's get to it.
8830000	8834000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
8834000	8837000	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio, and your mic might be muted. Who's this?
8837000	8839000	Yeah, my mic was muted. Hey, what's up? This guy's Judo.
8839000	8841000	It's like me. I'm calling in.
8841000	8844000	See, it's not just you, Loki. All right. What's up, Kaijuto?
8844000	8851000	Not much. I wanted to address what you were talking about earlier with the people being into their retro games
8851000	8854000	and wanting to be retro and missing the old Sega.
8854000	8859000	I think I have an answer for that. I've actually been analyzing that and just trying to figure out,
8859000	8862000	what is it about people that love these retro games?
8862000	8866000	Because me, I'm more into innovation. I want the games to move forward.
8866000	8871000	I like when they do new things, so I'm not really in that category, but I wonder about people that are.
8871000	8878000	I kind of compare it to, have you ever heard of people who say that they've gone through drug addiction?
8878000	8885000	The key thing that they say about drug addiction is that the reason why they continue to take drugs
8885000	8891000	is because they're chasing that first high. That first high that they got from that drug is what they've been after.
8891000	8895000	Every other high that they got doesn't compare to that first one.
8895000	8898000	The whole entire life of their addiction, they're chasing that one high.
8898000	8902000	I think that's what's going on with a lot of gamers who love retro stuff.
8902000	8906000	They got such a kick out of that game when they were a kid, or whatever the experience was,
8906000	8912000	that they're just continuing to chase that same experience over and over again and not trying to find something new to experience.
8912000	8919000	That is a very, with all due respect, a very strange comparison, but it kind of works.
8919000	8925000	I don't know how that makes me feel that your comparison kind of works.
8925000	8928000	Games are an addiction. I think some people do actually get addicted to games.
8928000	8930000	Oh, I think a lot of people actually.
8930000	8931000	It can be considered a drug.
8931000	8936000	I think a lot of people get addicted to games, especially in the MMO world where things are very social that we live in.
8936000	8937000	But anyway, that's a little-
8937000	8939000	No, I don't even think, I wouldn't even go that far.
8939000	8941000	That's a little different than what you're talking about.
8941000	8946000	I think the category that I'm talking about, those are the people that actually don't want to socialize in a game.
8946000	8953000	They're the ones who want their single player, they want to watch Sonic run through a loop multiple times over and over again.
8953000	8962000	I don't see them as actually being social. I think the MMO crowd is a little different than your average single player gamer.
8962000	8967000	Obviously your comments are getting a lot of lively responses in chat.
8967000	8974000	Fifth Dream says, nah, I just have fun playing them. I'm not into trying to feel a thing.
8974000	8978000	Dungeon Buster says, fun games are fun games regardless of their time frame.
8979000	8983000	That might actually have been to another comment that they're talking about, some game playthroughs.
8983000	8989000	But anyway, what I wanted to say with that is that we're not saying that if you enjoy retro video games you're a drug addict.
8989000	8991000	That's not what Kaiju was trying to say.
8991000	8998000	But I definitely see that angle of, and you see this a lot.
8998000	9005000	Ever since emulators broke on the scene, this is a big thing, where you will download a ROM.
9005000	9010000	Remember, and the reason why I say it this way is because emulators were before Virtual Console.
9010000	9015000	I realize some of you might be frowning. I'm talking about a very gray area of legal things.
9015000	9018000	But I just think this is something a lot of people have done.
9018000	9024000	Where you are downloading NES ROM to play on this NES emulator you get on your PC.
9024000	9027000	And you play it for literally 45 seconds.
9027000	9032000	Where you're like, oh yeah, I remember this. Wow, it's not really what I remember.
9032000	9040000	Alright, next game. It's like how things in our memory are so much different than maybe what they are now.
9040000	9045000	In our interview earlier tonight, I think Don made this point when he was talking about games that he was playing when he was 9.
9045000	9048000	And he wanted to make the game that he thought he was remembering.
9048000	9060000	Right, yeah. I remember going to Pirate Day and finding a whole bunch of, I think they had almost every Super Nintendo game ever made.
9060000	9065000	And I was like, alright, I gotta download this. I wanna be playing all these games. These are the games I always wanted as a kid.
9065000	9070000	I haven't even gotten through 10% of those games yet.
9070000	9076000	Just sit on my computer, you know. It's just that whole feeling that you get from me.
9076000	9080000	I don't care who was it, Rageinator, who was it, Trip Dream, whoever.
9080000	9085000	It is a feeling. That feeling, that fun that you call it, that's a feeling.
9085000	9088000	You know, you're chasing that feeling. You want that feeling again.
9088000	9097000	SSJ100Matt puts this in a really good way as saying, I can see people chasing nostalgia to try to rekindle those early moments from their first time.
9097000	9098000	Right.
9098000	9104000	I think that's a really good way of putting it. Like, remember, and I don't know how old you are, Kaijutor, or what your frame of reference would be.
9104000	9110000	But I know for me, when I was like, I think I was 9 years old when Super Mario Bros. 3 first came out on the NES.
9110000	9119000	And I remember that feeling the first time you go to World 4, specifically World 4. Anybody remember what World 4 in Super Mario Bros. 3 is?
9119000	9120000	I don't remember.
9120000	9121000	It is?
9121000	9122000	Boot.
9122000	9123000	Nope. Close.
9123000	9124000	Giant.
9124000	9125000	Giant. It's the giant level. It's the world of giants.
9125000	9126000	Oh, yeah, yeah. That was great.
9126000	9130000	And it's like the first time you see the giant goobas, the giant turtle.
9130000	9135000	And I remember, like, 9 years old, like, oh my god.
9135000	9136000	Yeah, that was great.
9136000	9138000	This is so cool.
9138000	9141000	Except, like, their dead animation was still the regular size.
9141000	9150000	You're right. But now you go, yeah, you go back and you look at it now and you're like, this was actually kind of, like, the way they did it, they really cut a lot of corners how they did this.
9150000	9156000	You know? But it's just funny, like, you know, what memory kind of does to things like that.
9156000	9169000	Yeah, I remember playing that game with my friend, Super Mario Bros. 3. And for, like, a good, I would say 20 minutes, I just kept making Mario run back and forth because I couldn't believe that you can run back to where you started.
9169000	9177000	Because, you know, remembering the other Mario games and just a bunch of platformers, it's like, once you move past that edge, you can never go back, you know?
9177000	9187000	And that's one of the main reasons why I really got into sandbox games later on. Like, you know, 3D sandboxing was just for the simple fact that I can go wherever I want in a game.
9187000	9193000	Like, one of the things that always bugged me as a kid playing a lot of platformers and games like that was you couldn't go back.
9193000	9204000	You know, you couldn't explore that place over the mountain that you're running by. You know, like, that type of stuff is what led me to want to get more into innovative gaming and not so much being trapped in the whole retro thing.
9204000	9207000	You know, just, you know, being stuck in that one spot.
9207000	9216000	Sure, and that's a selling point for a lot of games now. Like, I remember when Oblivion, Elder Scrolls of Oblivion was first, they were talking about, you see that mountain in the distance, you can go climb it.
9216000	9222000	You know, that was a huge part of that game. Dungeonbuster in our chat, one more comment here and then I'll wrap up.
9222000	9228000	Dungeonbuster saying, Space Invaders, Pac-Man, Super Pac-Man, still great regardless of having come out decades ago.
9228000	9236000	You can't really fault players for looking to games today, modern or retro, that try to capture the essence of being as fun in their own way.
9236000	9242000	Well, I'm going to disagree with that. I'm just going to end out by just saying that same thing with developers.
9242000	9251000	Like, they're still chasing that retro format and because of that, they start to fail because obviously it's not going to be, you're not going to get that same feeling again.
9252000	9259000	You can't step in the water, the same water twice. So, it's like when they try to do, you know, HD remakes and, you know, we're going to add more friends with Sonic.
9259000	9267000	When they try to do that type of stuff, they're killing the nostalgia. So, they've already screwed themselves over. The only thing they can possibly do is make it new, make it fresh.
9267000	9276000	And not so much, you know, try to recapture that because it's locked away in the old game, the way the old game worked. You know, bugs and everything.
9276000	9285000	It's tricky. I kind of think sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Like, you know, the Sonic, the Hedgehog Part 4 or whatever, you know, I mean, that was a pretty retro inspired thing.
9285000	9290000	But it wasn't, it wasn't really, it was just, it wasn't that great. Like, it was just kind of missing something.
9290000	9301000	Missing the soul. That, you know, that feeling that you got when you were a kid or however you were when you first played it. Not even a kid. I mean, I'm pretty sure there could be a 60-year-old who's playing Mario right now for the first time and getting his kicks out of it.
9301000	9306000	So, but there's not so much an age thing. It's just that first initial experience that you had with the game.
9306000	9314000	But then you look at something like, you look at something like New Super Mario Brothers on Wii U, and it's like, that's basically Mario Brothers 3 in today's.
9314000	9326000	I mean, it's basically what it is, but it's, and it's awesome. So, I think, you know, again, Nintendo has a very strange way of being able to succeed here where a lot of other companies don't succeed.
9326000	9330000	Anyway, Kaijuto, we could probably do a whole show on this. I appreciate your call. Good thinking.
9330000	9331000	No problem. Have a good night.
9331000	9332000	Take care, buddy. Bye.
9360000	9361000	What's up?
9390000	9400000	Yeah, that was so many years ago. Oh my God. So anyway, but yeah, I had a good time there, but thank God it wasn't Snowmageddon the year I went, because I wouldn't know what the hell to do.
9400000	9408000	Listen, I'm just laughing at people who are trying to beat the snow, and I'm guilty of it doing it this year.
9408000	9415000	My thing is, yes, you could beat the snow getting down there, but what are you going to do when the snow traps you?
9415000	9422000	Catsnokon9 at Catsnokon2003. A bunch of us were stuck in the hotel in Crystal City until Tuesday.
9422000	9427000	Big snow, big snow. What you gonna do? What you gonna do when it snows in you?
9430000	9436000	Anyway, I just hope that doesn't happen to me at PAX East. Alright, well, what's on your mind tonight? I don't know if you're calling to talk about the con or something else or what.
9436000	9447000	Oh, no, no, no, no. I'd go talk about the whole old-school retro thing, the whole issue with Sonic, and I see this in the gaming community, and I'm starting to see it in the anime community as well.
9447000	9457000	I mean, not even that, I'm just seeing it in various communities and genres. It's like, I love my old-school gaming, and I do. Don't get me wrong.
9457000	9468000	I don't mind playing an updated version or something new, and that always works out for me. I've fallen in the minority of people who hated Super Mario 64.
9468000	9474000	You mean to tell me I gotta go back to the level seven times to complete this? No, I'm not doing it anymore.
9474000	9482000	Hate is a strong word, Rama, but I'm with you to a point. I kind of think we look back on that game way too fondly.
9482000	9491000	That's my personal opinion, though, and I think a lot of the 2D versus 3D mindset comes into play. I don't want to start a whole debate, but I don't think you're as alone as you think you are, Rama.
9491000	9498000	Yeah, but you know, with the other 3D games, like the Mario 3D games, I like those. Those were fun, because it kept going.
9498000	9508000	Now, I understand, you know, the whole thing with Sonic Boom, and I have a lot of friends in the Sonic community that were losing their shit over it because it was so different.
9508000	9518000	And all I said was, you do realize, us old school gamers now, we're the minority. They're not listening to us.
9518000	9533000	They're going to make the games, design it for the newer generation coming in. So, if we see Sonic Boom and we don't like it, maybe your nephew or niece is going to see it, is going to want it, and play it.
9533000	9536000	Granted, the sales of Sonic Boom wasn't as good.
9536000	9538000	Yeah, I was going to say that didn't happen, though.
9538000	9550000	True, but there are other, I would say, as you look at Nintendo, they did something different. The latest Mario games aren't really old school. They just spin on it, and it works.
9550000	9560000	Pretty much whether it's a success or failure, these businesses are going to go after the newer generation because there's more of them than there is of us.
9560000	9570000	Well, like I said in response to that, though, earlier when it had come up in chat, I was kind of like, well, why can't we have both? Because I think there's still certainly a big gaming audience.
9570000	9578000	I mean, many, many years ago when gaming was first born, you probably didn't have a lot of 30 and 40-year-old gamers. You certainly had some.
9578000	9592000	I mean, a lot of that age group was making the games at the time, but it wasn't as mainstream for that age group. But anybody our age, Ranma, anybody our age knows who Mario and Link and Sonic are.
9592000	9598000	Anybody our age, seriously, unless they're Amish or something, knows these characters. They're part of our culture now.
9598000	9608000	I know, and that's why, you know, that's how I look at how Nintendo rehashes the old games, brings back an HD, and I know we're all like, Nintendo, stop with the HD remixes.
9608000	9616000	But meanwhile, they put them out, and they sell like candy, and it's gold, because some of these are great titles, and I understand that.
9616000	9624000	Okay, young'uns, come here, check out one of these classic games done up for your new console. Play it and enjoy it, you know?
9624000	9636000	And I get with that, which is why I would love to see, for the 3DS, maybe Sega redoing the Sonic titles with the 3D effects of the background. That would be fun.
9636000	9644000	Maybe Nintendo will get all the Mario titles together, 3D fire up the backgrounds and play it for fun. That would be cool. I would love that, but...
9644000	9654000	I want to say, and I could be wrong, but I feel like this is something that happened, and maybe Bobby or somebody that was at that same E3 would remember this.
9654000	9666000	But I want to say, when they first showed the 3DS, you had to wait in that big line and go see the 3DS for the very first time, they were showing old school NES titles, redone in 3D.
9666000	9678000	And there were things like Xevious and some titles that never got that 3D treatment, just like we never did get the 3D movies. And I think Sonic was one of those games they showed.
9678000	9688000	Wait, I can tell you this now, because I went on to the Nintendo club rewards, they have Xevious and Twinbee, urban champion, they've 3D-fied those, and you can get them.
9688000	9699000	Alright, sorry, I named a game that they did do, but I know there were games we saw on the show floor, retro games with the 3D spin that they never put out for public consumption for whatever reason.
9699000	9706000	Maybe somebody at that E3 can remember, but I thought Sonic was one of them. I thought Sonic was one of them.
9706000	9711000	Probably, but that would be pretty cool.
9712000	9727000	All it was really, I mean, it's not as fancy as you would think, all it was was that they could put one sprite layer on this 3D layer, and they could put another sprite layer on this 3D layer.
9727000	9732000	So it was kind of what you say, the background was in the background, the foreground was in the foreground, and that was the 3D.
9734000	9739000	Anyway, just throwing it out there, for whatever reason, I don't think it ever came out.
9740000	9751000	Yeah, but neither did, we also got to see Tangled, like the trailer was playing on a 3DS, and we never, I mean, short of Dinosaur Office, we never saw 3D movies.
9751000	9753000	So they never did the Sonic one?
9753000	9754000	I don't think so.
9754000	9756000	Because I'm looking at a review for it.
9756000	9759000	Unless it's part of that Sega Classics thing.
9759000	9761000	It may have been the Sega Classics thing.
9761000	9763000	Aha! So maybe it does exist.
9763000	9766000	And I'm sure there's somebody who might have downloaded it.
9766000	9772000	Keep in mind, I don't have the entire contents of the 3DS store memorized in any game I buy, I pretty much buy all my own money.
9772000	9774000	Yeah, because I guess they said the M2 did that.
9774000	9776000	So okay, so maybe they do have one, there it is.
9777000	9778000	Well there you go!
9778000	9782000	Rama, you need to open up your 3DS and go on the shop, and so do I.
9782000	9786000	Yeah, some people in chat are saying, Orange Wright says 3D Sonic happened.
9786000	9791000	Alright, I'm gonna have to check it out, because if it's really 3D, I may just have to pick it up, because I think that would be pretty fun.
9791000	9794000	I think something like that would kind of bridge the gap between the old school and the new school.
9794000	9796000	It's just that twist that would work so well.
9796000	9799000	How hard would it be though for them to just configure the old games?
9799000	9804000	Like here's each sprite layer is on a different, you know, each layer of sprites is on a different level or something.
9804000	9811000	And you may have to tweak that per game, but I wouldn't see it be that hard to port that stuff over if they have an emulator for that.
9811000	9820000	I don't know, because I don't program games, but I can't imagine it's insanely difficult, but maybe you run into other weird issues with the new display and things like that.
9820000	9822000	Maybe that's where things get tricky, I don't know.
9822000	9823000	I don't know.
9823000	9827000	Alright, anyway Rama, I'm gonna let you go to try to squeeze in one more call, but thanks so much.
9827000	9828000	Hope you had fun at the con.
9828000	9837000	We will, and we'll be doing a full review with me, Ari, Mako-chan, and Ablon Cosplay, so get your booze ready, get the drinks ready, we're gonna do it up.
9837000	9841000	Alright, it's going down Tuesday here live at VOG Network on Anime Jam Session.
9841000	9843000	And before I get it, here's my last thing.
9843000	9845000	Ookchan, I got something to show you, look at the webcam.
9848000	9851000	It's a copy of Rama on...
9851000	9852000	I have that game.
9852000	9854000	That looks like a Super Famicom cart, not a...
9854000	9855000	It is.
9855000	9860000	This one is Rama 1 half the first fighting game that came over as Street Combat.
9860000	9865000	I rented that game once, Rama, with the frickin' converter.
9865000	9871000	Yeah, and this is the third fighting game, which was, they called Super Battle.
9871000	9877000	It was supposed to come over as Rama 1 half 2, anything goes martial arts, but due to poor sales, it never happened.
9877000	9878000	That one's the fun one.
9878000	9882000	The second one was the one we actually got over here as Rama 1 half Hard Battle.
9882000	9883000	Yep.
9883000	9889000	And that was the one that had, uh, the gambling king had, uh, pantyhose in it.
9889000	9893000	Yeah, and if you beat the game with pantyhose, the game would glitch.
9893000	9894000	Yep.
9894000	9895000	It would glitch.
9895000	9896000	Alright.
9896000	9897000	Well, Rama, thanks for the call.
9897000	9898000	No problem.
9898000	9899000	Alright, take care, buddy.
9899000	9900000	You too.
9900000	9901000	Alright.
9901000	9905000	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio if you want to give us a call.
9905000	9908000	Loki, that story you were gonna read that I cut you off on.
9908000	9915000	Sorry, I was gonna mention that apparently with a recent interview with, um, Giorgio, um, Mordor,
9915000	9923000	um, apparently he's working on a new video game soundtrack for a new Tron game, and he's also working with Skrillex on that.
9924000	9927000	So there's a new Tron game in the works.
9927000	9930000	He says, uh, you know, according with, uh, Clashmusic.com,
9930000	9932000	I'm gonna meet with Skrillex next week.
9932000	9936000	When I'm back, I'm doing music for a game for Disney's Tron.
9936000	9943000	We have about five themes, electronic stuff, and let's see if he's interested in remixing or reworking one of the songs.
9943000	9946000	I have a lot of conflicting feels about this.
9946000	9948000	Um, on one hand, I'm like, yay, Tron.
9948000	9950000	On the other hand, hmm.
9950000	9951000	Alright, well, we'll see.
9951000	9952000	We'll see.
9952000	9955000	I'm just all about a new Tron game. Come on.
9955000	9956000	I guess. I guess.
9956000	9960000	That's true, though. Tigerclaw and chat, Giorgio and Mordor is a legend.
9960000	9961000	That is, uh, is true.
9961000	9965000	So, we'll see. I gotta give it a shot, right? It's Tron.
9965000	9967000	Alright, let's see if we can get in one more call here.
9967000	9969000	Uh, hi, you're on Orange Land's Radio. Who's this?
9971000	9973000	Hi, yeah, this is Ragingator.
9973000	9974000	Hey, Ragingator. What's up, buddy?
9974000	9976000	Uh, not a whole lot.
9976000	9978000	Uh, just trying to stay warm.
9978000	9979000	Yeah, you look cold.
9979000	9981000	Hope everything's alright.
9981000	9985000	Oh, it's beyond cold. It has to warm up to be cold.
9985000	9989000	It's like, last time we talked, there was, like, negative something degrees Fahrenheit here.
9989000	9990000	Oh my god.
9990000	9994000	It does not even take into consideration wind chill effects.
9994000	9998000	You own Xbox 360s. If so, turn them on.
10000000	10002000	What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
10002000	10020000	Uh, well, since a lot of the talk on tonight's show has either been retro games and Sega and so on and so forth, I thought I'd carry on the trend and talk about Sega and their issues in the retro games.
10020000	10049000	Uh, these, uh, I know I kind of touched on the subject, uh, a few times before on the show and maybe even Bobby, not Bobby's show, but, uh, so I know it's going to sound like a broken record, but do you think that, uh, you know, Sega could have their position, you know, their financial position if they re-release more of their retro games above and beyond what they already released?
10049000	10071000	I know that a few years ago they already re-released, uh, Sega, uh, Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection on 360, PS3, and then, of course, there's the stuff on, uh, on Steam, plus, uh, there's the Dreamcast Collection, and I think, you know, and plus, Res was re-released.
10071000	10072000	You know...
10072000	10076000	And then, I think, you know, Nicely Two Dreams was re-released.
10076000	10077000	That's a...
10077000	10078000	That's a good question.
10078000	10104000	Um, you know, a lot of, uh, these games kind of get re-released, and I remember that Sonic, uh, Ultimate Collection was a pretty damn good collection, and I think part of what makes these games worthy of your dollar is that, and this is, you know, if you think about it, I've been nagging on this with Virtual Console for a very long time, is that straight up ports of the game only go so far.
10104000	10109000	And I think, you know, that's cool if on the Wii you buy your straight up port of the game.
10109000	10127000	On the Wii U, asking you to do it again is, is, is a challenge, but, okay, it does look really good on the gamepad and so forth, and you do have the discount, so whatever, but, you know, my question is, when are things gonna really push forward, and when will we see, like, achievements, or some type of online component?
10127000	10130000	Or if you buy it on the Wii U, you have it on the 3DS, or something.
10130000	10132000	Yeah, or co-op, or something like that.
10132000	10142000	And so I sort of say that's where game companies can kind of get away with putting out retro classics again is, what is that new thing?
10142000	10151000	How does this retro classic tie into the new thing in gaming right now, be it social integration, or, or whatever it is?
10151000	10162000	And I think if a game can do that, it tends to usually do a little better than, oh, here it is, just, just a straight up port of the game from a few years ago, again and again and again.
10162000	10172000	Especially when that goes over to mobile, it's like, because usually the controls don't translate as well, but that's, you know, again, a lot of that is opinion, but that's my opinion.
10172000	10188000	Yeah, one thing I was gonna mention is that there are certain games, like the ones I mentioned before, before you would buy, those have been released again and again and again, and that being said, people can easily get the hands on them, no problem.
10188000	10212000	Whereas other games, you know, like the vast majority of the games for, let's say, Sega Saturn, be it, you know, Panzer Dragoon, or Mr. Bones, or any other game that you can possibly name, plus the vast majority of game cast games, you know, haven't been re-released, to the best of my knowledge.
10212000	10229000	And I'm one of the few people that really hasn't bought a whole lot of Sega systems, and in fact the only ones I ever bought were the Genesis, and I didn't even get that until 2002.
10229000	10250000	So, if I had the opportunity to buy, like, Panzer Dragoon, for example, you know, on Steam, if I had the opportunity right here, right now, I'd buy in a heartbeat. I can't speak for anyone else, you know, listening, or you guys, but...
10250000	10262000	So, I think you're talking about why do these companies, like, kind of limit their offerings in a way. It's like, why not, if you, you know, get that one Genesis game emulated, get them all emulated, make some money.
10262000	10277000	I don't, you know, and again, because I don't program, and I don't budget or whatever, I just play, and have a big fat opinion, like a lot of us do, I don't know to what extent they have to go to to get a game emulated.
10277000	10288000	But maybe they have to say, like, are there a lot of people like Raginator out there that would buy Panzer Dragoon to make an emulation worth it, and sometimes they may think, you know what, the demand really isn't there.
10288000	10305000	But, that's where fans have to speak up, and your voices are heard on their forums, and, you know, professional emails to some of their channels and so forth, and Twitter and so forth, you can kind of be heard, and hopefully it doesn't fall on deaf ears.
10305000	10328000	Yeah, one last note before I do let you go is, yes, I know, you know, there are, how should I say, less than legitimate ways of getting those games, and I know technically that's possible, but that is at best a gray area, and that's one route that I really don't want to go.
10328000	10354000	I would rather give, you know, Sega or Nintendo or whoever, you know, my money for a legitimate copy, that way I can support those companies, give them my funds, they would, you know, help out the next project, and there's no telling if the next project is going to be a good game or a bad game.
10354000	10360000	But, the point is, I want to support the developers and publishers.
10360000	10370000	And I think that's good, and I think that's what a lot of people need to remember, is that, you know, games aren't made for free, you wouldn't work for free, so, you know, why do we want our game devs to do that?
10370000	10380000	So, you know, you have to think about that every time you might use shady methods to obtain a game. So, anyway, RageNator, appreciate the call, have a good one, stay warm.
10380000	10382000	I will do, take care.
10382000	10394000	Alright, buh-bye. Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight, I'm going to go ahead and close it up, because we're about to wrap up shop here at Studio OLR, but I do want to check in for any other last minute stories we might have.
10394000	10399000	I'm just a silly mob that they have for Doom, where you can do Instagram-style selfies.
10399000	10402000	Oh, lord. Selfies in Doom, though? Wait a minute.
10402000	10403000	Yeah, they have a selfie stick.
10403000	10410000	Oh my god. That is, that is actually the dumbest news I think I've ever heard on this show.
10410000	10413000	I don't think I can roll my eyes any harder without causing myself physical pain.
10413000	10426000	I did see this pretty cool Kickstarter that's also out there, if you look at it, it's called Strafe. It's a procedurally generated 1996-style FPS game that's extremely gory.
10426000	10427000	Oh, god.
10427000	10429000	Extremely gory as in, you know...
10429000	10431000	In 90s, like 96 pixel...
10431000	10432000	Pixel blood!
10432000	10433000	Pixel blood, yeah.
10434000	10439000	But it looks pretty funny, and the Kickstarter video that they have for it is just fucking hilarious.
10439000	10440000	Awesome.
10440000	10446000	And also extremely gory, but in like that kind of 90s-style commercial sense, but they take it way too far.
10446000	10447000	That's awesome.
10447000	10448000	Face melting.
10449000	10450000	That's awesome.
10450000	10454000	Alright, well that is going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10454000	10462000	I'm about to go around and get everybody's final thoughts for the night, but I do want to thank Don and Austin from the StarMazer team for joining us on the show tonight.
10462000	10467000	Best of luck in that final push for those, excuse me, last few dollars you need to make the game happen.
10467000	10468000	Our fingers are crossed.
10468000	10471000	Hey, if nothing else, y'all, I want that soundtrack.
10471000	10477000	I'm just saying, like, you know, I want that soundtrack, so let's cross our fingers and our toes for those guys.
10477000	10478000	I want to thank those guys for being on.
10479000	10488000	Thank you guys for being here and supporting Orange Lounge Radio, whether you were here live and chose to listen to us instead of the Saturday Night Live special, really appreciate that.
10488000	10491000	Hey, if you're listening on the podcast feed, we appreciate that too.
10491000	10493000	Don't we have the Oscars we're going up against next week too?
10493000	10498000	Yeah, now the Oscars are next week. We lost our guests next week because of the Oscars. We're trying to reschedule them for a future date.
10498000	10501000	Oh yeah, but we might have a replacement guest, which would be great, so that'd be great.
10501000	10504000	Well, I was totally disappointed that Neil Patrick Harris decided to bail on us.
10507000	10515000	So, I know Sunday night is when a lot of the big shit happens, so we really appreciate you guys that decide to be here live and participate with it.
10515000	10520000	We really, really appreciate you guys, but we also appreciate, we appreciate you podcast folks just as much.
10520000	10522000	Your support keeps this show going.
10522000	10528000	Just if you are listening, the live listeners, we see most of them in our chat room and we get to interact with them.
10528000	10534000	So, if you're listening on the podcast, please drop us a line, say hello, send an email, tweet at us, let us know you're out there.
10534000	10536000	We love hearing from people. Don't be shy.
10536000	10541000	We're really nice, unless you're mean to us, then we'll be mean, but we're really nice otherwise.
10542000	10551000	So, yeah, and we don't ask for your money or we don't have a big name website backing us up here at Orange Lawns Radio.
10551000	10558000	So, all we ask if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lawns Radio, please tell a friend or two or five about the show.
10558000	10565000	Help spread the word where every gamer has a voice because we don't know the voices are out there if we don't find them.
10566000	10571000	Like we had Austin tonight, big Bamani fan, didn't know he was out there until we finally got in touch.
10571000	10578000	So, now we know and hopefully there's plenty more people out there who just don't know of OLR yet who would fit in great here.
10578000	10579000	So, help us spread the word.
10579000	10586000	A nice five-star review on iTunes or Stitcher goes a long, long, long way and we appreciate those of you guys that take the time out to do things like that.
10586000	10587000	Thank you, thank you, thank you.
10587000	10591000	Alright, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought for the night so we can wrap it up here.
10591000	10594000	Dark Sakura, I see you packing a laptop away. We'll start with you.
10594000	10597000	I was in the middle of pulling my hair back so come to me later.
10597000	10600000	Alright, then Loki, what is your final thought for tonight?
10600000	10603000	I'm going to try to figure out what level two is going to be.
10603000	10604000	You can do it.
10604000	10606000	I have a ton of ideas. I have a list of ideas.
10606000	10608000	How many levels are you doing, out of curiosity?
10608000	10609000	69.
10609000	10613000	Here's the number of ideas I have right now is on one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
10613000	10614000	He's counting.
10614000	10616000	20. I have 20 so far.
10616000	10618000	20 is a good number, maybe.
10618000	10619000	So far.
10619000	10623000	Or maybe do like seven just to get your game out there and then...
10623000	10631000	I have to also look at and see which of these are actually doable because there's some ideas I'm like, well, I may not be able to do that, but we'll try.
10631000	10640000	Make it work. I really want to see the game, but of course I have to take my own advice because I want to get my vog jam done, belated as it is.
10640000	10646000	My final thought for the night is I would love to have my voice back tomorrow. That would be very lovely.
10646000	10653000	And, um, I just, I'm, I'm feeling very great and thankful for a lot of things.
10653000	10660000	Um, and thank you all who contribute to being here and supporting this show for contributing to my lovely mood this evening.
10660000	10661000	So, uh, I appreciate it.
10661000	10665000	Not every day is a lovely mood, but today I'm certainly feeling it. So thank you all.
10665000	10667000	Uh, Darsakha, your final thought tonight?
10667000	10671000	Everyone pull out your iPhones right now and buy FLOM.
10671000	10675000	F L O M M. Do the thing. Do it for me.
10675000	10676000	Do you get some FLON? Okay.
10676000	10679000	FLON, I let it on. Do you get kickback?
10679000	10685000	No, I don't, but it's fun. And I honestly, we need to support more people.
10685000	10689000	This is, this would really mean a lot to me. It would mean a lot to Steve.
10689000	10693000	You've talked fondly of him for a while now, so I know you really want to see him succeed.
10693000	10698000	I do. So do it for me. It's, it's $3. I will lend you $3.
10698000	10700000	That's a lot of people to lend $3 to.
10700000	10701000	I was talking to you, Rob.
10701000	10707000	Oh, me? Okay. No, I actually, thankful, uh, some friends gave me an iTunes gift card for the holidays.
10707000	10708000	So I have, I have my radio.
10708000	10709000	Spend it on FLOM.
10709000	10711000	All right. Should I spend it on FLOM 10 times?
10711000	10714000	Well, you just do it once.
10714000	10715000	All right.
10715000	10716000	Cheese, Rob.
10716000	10719000	All right. That's going to do it, uh, here at Orange Lounge Radio for another week.
10719000	10721000	We'll be back in seven days to do it all again.
10721000	10724000	Thanks so much for listening. Have a wonderful week, everybody. Good night.
