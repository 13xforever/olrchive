7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	19000	Tonight, we interview the developer of Flom, an art game that pits old against new, modern against tradition, and an adventure through art history.
19000	27000	Join us for the exploration as well as the headlines from This Week in Gaming, along with your questions, comments, feedback, and more, right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	47000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this February the 22nd, 2015, the 588th episode of our show.
47000	58000	My name is Rob Roberts, but you can find me on Twitter at Skie, here with you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with my co-host.
58000	62000	Say hello first off to the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
62000	64000	I actually looked at my Twitter once.
64000	65000	Did you?
65000	66000	Once.
66000	68000	Yeah, you ended up floating more over to Tumblr than Twitter.
68000	70000	There's a lot of social media out there. There's a lot.
70000	72000	The Tumblars are great.
72000	81000	Alan finally had to sit down and teach me how to use Snapchat, because I did not understand the interface at all, and I still think the interface is really terrible.
81000	82000	Isn't that the thing to swap-
82000	84000	Oh, hi, TechMasterLoki, how are you?
84000	87000	Sorry, isn't that the thing to swap nudes or something back and forth? Is that what that-
87000	89000	I think they- well, here's the thing-
89000	92000	No, that's where people send you dick pictures, and then you get to comment on them.
92000	97000	Here's the thing about Snapchat is I kind of think that's the CD underbelly, you know, the internet is for porn type of thing.
97000	100000	I mean, you can use email to send those types of pictures if you want, right?
100000	103000	Yeah, if you were in like 1996 or something like that.
103000	105000	But I think that might have been how their business started.
105000	110000	Hey, back in the day it used to be really expensive to send pictures of your junk out to people.
110000	117000	But I think a lot of younger people use Snapchat. Not for that reason, because I'll be very, very, very wrong, although sadly there probably are a few.
117000	118000	They should be ashamed.
118000	120000	Children don't do anything wrong.
120000	129000	I know, but here's the thing. I think a lot of like, especially at college and so forth, use it as like a blogging thing, because now they built this whole- I didn't even realize this existed until Alan explained it to me.
129000	138000	There's a whole like, you can build a story. And so the snap videos that you take over a 24 hour period or whatever can all go into like a story.
138000	143000	Is that where you put like googly eyes on the penises and then like make little caption bubbles and stuff like that?
143000	148000	I did see the thing going around on Tumblr where someone snapchatted like different people and then they started drawing over them.
148000	150000	Yeah, that you can do that too.
150000	153000	That might be a reason to get that, but no.
154000	162000	It is very silly, but I only bring that up because that's huge. Apparently that is huge. That app is worth millions and millions of dollars.
162000	169000	And I didn't understand it until a couple days ago, even though I tried to download it because some friends of mine were like, look me up on Snapchat.
169000	177000	And I couldn't figure it out until Alan was like, okay, you're going to tap this button and it's going to do that.
177000	179000	And then you're going to swipe right and it's going to do that.
179000	181000	You know your old win.
183000	185000	When you have to have someone to show you how to use an app.
185000	194000	Right? It threw me back to the days when I used to have to like explain to my dad how to call the BBS's that I was calling to download porn.
194000	198000	I mean, play door games. Play door games. Very important.
198000	204000	All right. Anyhow, we're here with you guys every Sunday night live at the Voice of Geeks Network.
205000	210000	Which tapes Sunday nights at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
210000	215000	Which I'll tell you a little more about his show a little later in the show because he had a really neat interview tonight.
215000	216000	I'll tell you more about that later.
216000	223000	But yeah, you can tune in live. And if you are live, you should join our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
223000	225000	And we do read comments from chat throughout the show.
225000	233000	And you can participate in the program, ask questions, have comments out there that we can throw out there on the discussions we're having.
233000	236000	On a lot of various game topics.
236000	242000	Tonight though, we're going to welcome to the show a friend of Dark Sakura's.
242000	248000	Dark Sakura, perhaps you should do this introduction because you've been hyping this game on the show for the past few weeks.
248000	252000	And I always do this. So Dark Sakura, why don't you introduce our guest tonight?
252000	256000	Hi. Okay. My voice just decided to fart on me.
257000	264000	I would like to introduce a very, very cool guy who was first met as my teacher. I did some intern work.
264000	266000	I like how you're pointing to me on the radio.
266000	267000	Because.
267000	268000	Because you're here live in the studio.
268000	269000	No one can see that.
269000	270000	This is Steve.
270000	271000	I'm going to take a picture of your hand.
271000	272000	Just say hi.
273000	274000	Hello.
274000	275000	Hello.
275000	277000	Wait, are you taking pictures over there?
277000	278000	I'm taking pictures of her hand.
278000	279000	Is that in Snapchat?
279000	281000	Yeah, it's going to go on Instagram.
281000	282000	On Instagram?
282000	284000	On Instagram, yeah. We're a little bit old.
284000	289000	No, there's nothing. Wait, Instagram is old? I think I missed that memo.
289000	291000	Little old. Next big thing coming up next.
291000	294000	All right. Well, welcome to Orange Lawn Tradios, Steve.
294000	296000	Oh, that came out like shit.
299000	304000	Didn't he ask you, Dark Sakura, what should I expect on Orange Lawn Tradios? You say, well, we like to swear a lot.
304000	305000	We say fuck a lot.
305000	306000	Okay.
306000	307000	That was, I think, what I said.
307000	308000	All right.
308000	310000	Well, saying and doing. Go ahead.
310000	316000	Speaking of apps, I want to give you ample opportunity to talk about why you're here and what this might have to do with gaming and so forth.
316000	318000	And he's here because I lured him with food.
318000	319000	Well, there's that.
319000	320000	You lured me with food?
320000	321000	Just get down here.
321000	325000	But we want to talk about the app that Steve has had a huge...
325000	326000	Oh, I'm sick of talking about the app.
326000	328000	Oh, wait. I'm just talking about it now.
328000	329000	It's been a while.
329000	330000	Well, we don't have to talk about it.
330000	331000	It's been a while.
331000	332000	But then nobody knows about it.
332000	334000	Oh, that's the hard part.
334000	341000	Steve, you're the creator of a game that's available on iTunes and it's for the iPad and iPhone.
341000	343000	Not Android yet, right?
343000	344000	This is not available on Android yet?
344000	345000	Not on Android.
345000	347000	That's what I hear the most.
347000	348000	Yeah.
348000	351000	And it's from our point of view, although everyone's argued with me about it.
351000	352000	Oh, that's a good filter.
352000	353000	That is a really good filter.
353000	354000	Okay.
354000	356000	We're putting that on Instagram.
356000	358000	It still looks bad.
358000	361000	But the game is called Flom.
361000	362000	It's called Flom.
362000	363000	Which is...
363000	368000	That's an interesting name because when first, I think Dark Sakura and one of her, I'm going
368000	371000	to say a random tangent moments at like the beginning of the show.
371000	372000	I was like, what's up, Dark Sakura?
372000	373000	And she goes, Flom!
373000	375000	And I'm like, you made me flan?
375000	376000	What?
376000	377000	This is a great name.
377000	378000	What?
378000	379000	That's a funny word.
379000	380000	Flom.
380000	381000	What is that?
381000	382000	What does that title mean?
382000	383000	Nothing.
383000	385000	I love it.
385000	386000	Yes.
386000	388000	You're an honest man, Steve.
388000	389000	I love it.
389000	391000	It was a nonsense word.
391000	394000	I kept putting on Twitter because I wasn't sure what to do with Twitter when it first
394000	396000	came out.
396000	403000	And I had a friend that I drove crazy by just typing the word flam every few days.
403000	406000	Didn't it end up in one of your syllabuses once?
406000	407000	I threw it in there too.
407000	408000	Yeah.
408000	411000	Because I was teaching and that's a playground.
411000	413000	Really.
413000	415000	So I just kept driving a friend crazy.
415000	419000	The whole concept for this game started and then eventually I didn't know what to name
419000	420000	it.
420000	421000	And I was like, what the hell?
421000	427000	And since it is based on modern art, Dadaism, supposedly the legend was they just sort of
427000	429000	picked it at random from a dictionary.
429000	430000	So, what the hell?
430000	431000	Here's this word.
431000	433000	You can name it anything you wanted.
433000	438000	Tell us a little bit about your background because Dark Sakura met you when you were
438000	441000	an instructor in one of her design classes, right?
441000	445000	So your background isn't necessarily, you know, we talked to a lot of game designers
445000	451200	in game development, but we also really support here at OLR people like you and me and Loki
451200	454000	and Dark Sakura that want to create their own games, right?
454000	455000	Yeah.
455000	456000	So tell us a little bit about your background.
456000	462000	Not necessarily as a game designer, but your background is in book design and print design,
462000	463000	right?
463000	464000	It's everything else.
464000	468400	Well, my background in game design was I played them when I was a kid.
468400	474320	And I didn't realize what a different world it was until I watched Tron again, the original
474320	477020	one, and saw the arcade.
477020	478860	And I remember the arcades were so crowded.
478860	485200	We used to try to somehow get to the San Francisco airport in order to play the video games there
485200	486800	because there was no one playing them.
486800	490320	And you didn't have to have a ticket to get past screening back in the day.
490320	491320	No, you didn't.
491320	494840	You could just go hang out and watch the planes and they'd eventually throw you out because
494840	497200	you were a kid.
497200	503760	But you could actually, eventually when we got cars in high school, we'd drive out there
503760	506920	and basically pay for our parking by returning old baggage carts.
506920	507920	Oh, that's amazing.
507920	509880	It was a quarter each one.
509880	511960	What kind of games in the 80s do you remember?
511960	512960	What kind of games do you remember playing?
512960	514480	I remember blowing up shit.
514480	518920	And that's what I, you know, I grew up in the 70s.
518920	521560	We had car chases.
521560	522840	Bullet is one of my favorite films.
522840	524560	I used to watch it with my dad.
524560	525840	He's San Francisco mainstay.
525840	526840	Yeah.
526840	530400	You want to see San Francisco before the traffic, go watch Bullet.
530400	537440	And there was, what was it, The Driver, which was, someone look up the film, The Driver.
537440	540720	It's a great little film that no one knows about.
540720	544160	So I was fascinated with car chases, watching things blow up.
544160	548280	Eventually we had Knight Rider, we had Dukes of Hazzard.
548280	551000	And in the video games, you start seeing these metaphors.
551000	557600	I mean, Pong was originally tennis and then it started becoming alien invaders, space
557600	558760	battles and stuff.
558760	560520	And I was fascinated with the early stuff.
560520	561520	Pole position for racer.
561520	563480	I remember that was like an early, early racing.
563480	564480	It was pole position.
564480	568420	And then I don't know if you were still checking out arcades, maybe when things shifted a little
568420	572080	bit to like roadblasters, I remember was our early favorite.
572080	573680	They were closing eventually.
573680	574680	Yeah.
574680	577400	I remember they were in the malls and then things started closing.
577400	583060	I remember there was a jump to 50 cents a game and you would have to stand in line to
583060	584160	play each game.
584160	588420	You'd have to stack up quarters just to take over a game from someone.
588420	591300	So how did this all come together?
591300	595620	Because you mentioned that you've been wanting to do this game Flom for, I was reading in
595620	599460	some of the press and the website and so forth, that you've been wanting to put this game
599460	600900	together basically for five years.
600900	601900	It's been a process.
601900	602900	It's been a while.
602900	604920	High school plus one, if you think about it.
604920	610100	How did that come together where you say, okay, I remember these arcades and these games
610100	613820	I used to play because I love to blow shit up and we'd sneak into the airport where we're
613820	616400	not supposed to be there to play these old games.
616400	619060	And I have my love of design.
619060	622620	How did those two worlds collide, the design world and the game world?
622620	624740	Always looking for different things.
624740	631600	And I know the great John Kureka over at Rocketeer Games and he just sort of threw a little idea
631600	636600	at me regarding a game that he had sitting there that he wasn't doing much with.
636600	639240	And I just sort of went out and started designing stuff.
639240	643240	And I remember I even came up to him after six months and said, here's some of my ideas.
643240	644640	And he's like, what are you doing?
644880	651840	I had no idea that I was actually playing with something, but I wanted to do a little
651840	653800	shooter just like the ones I remember.
653800	656920	And I remember them being a lot different than what I see out there.
656920	659800	I've tried playing a new version of Asteroids.
659800	665640	It's just not the same without the black and white screen and the glowing stuff.
665640	672840	So that's interesting you bring that up because I noticed that the graphics in Flom kind of
672840	677040	take a, I don't want to say a simplistic approach because we're not talking about black
677040	681640	and white, but we're definitely talking about like, really, I mean, I'm just struck by like,
681640	685380	it's like moving art pieces kind of all coming together.
685380	687220	Where did that come from, the idea to do that?
687220	688220	It was a play.
688220	694320	One of the things I noticed, and this is where I first met Dark Sakura, I'm still working
694320	695320	on that because I know you as Jamie.
695320	696320	You can just call me Jamie.
696320	697320	Yeah.
697320	702040	And she was taking my history class, which is an hour and 20 minutes of stand up twice
702040	703760	a week.
703760	709700	And I was noticing as I got into the modern art movements, which I really enjoyed, that
709700	712440	there was some stuff going on in there that is tappable.
712440	717640	And one of the big connections was the De Stijl movement out of Holland, which most
717640	718640	people don't know about.
718640	721320	I even polled students to this day, what do you know about Holland?
721320	725960	And pretty much all they know today is wooden shoes, windmills, and Dutch Bros coffee.
725960	726960	And weed is legal.
726960	727960	Yes.
727960	728960	Weed is legal.
728960	730560	I know nobody wants to say that out loud.
730560	731560	Hookers and pot.
731560	732560	Hookers and pot.
732560	733560	Really?
733560	734560	Let's...
734560	735560	And now Colorado is our Holland.
735560	736560	Oh, that's right.
736560	737560	They don't have to go to Holland anymore.
737560	738560	Yeah.
738560	739560	Can you get hookers in Colorado?
739560	740560	Maybe.
740560	741560	Maybe in 2016.
741560	742560	Rob, you can get hookers anywhere.
742560	743560	Yeah.
743560	744560	Anyway.
744560	745800	I could go walk down the street and get a hooker.
745800	746800	Hold on.
746800	748320	We're trying to talk about a classy game here.
748320	750080	Don't be mucking it up with hookers and pot.
750080	751080	All right.
751080	755080	Wait, what neighborhood is this?
755080	759880	So I saw the connections, which they were doing things with lines, orthogonals, a lot
759880	761920	of things that looked like pixel art.
761920	764520	It reminded me a lot of Pong.
764520	766880	And it reminded me of how the early games were all low resolution.
766880	769160	There were all these 8-bit things.
769160	773000	And they were doing it with drafting paper and other tools.
773000	774680	So I started researching.
774680	779440	There was a movement tied to it, and that's what gave me the idea for a flom movement,
779440	783220	which is more Spinal Tap than anything else, which is I've created a fake art movement.
783220	784220	We have a manifesto.
784220	786000	We have all the stuff at the website.
786000	788980	And we'll see who bites onto that.
788980	795060	And then I started talking to other people about it and getting them interested in it.
795060	799900	And as I move forward, there's a big problem with Holland in that they're not big into
799900	801060	blowing things up.
801060	803760	You have to kind of go into other art movements.
803760	806780	And I made my way to Italy, which was the Futurists.
806780	810740	And the Futurists were all about violence and blowing things up.
810740	816700	So much, their best artists were lost in World War I.
816700	818440	Interesting.
818440	820400	So yeah.
820400	823080	And then it was research, research, research.
823080	824260	After that, lots of reading.
824260	826120	We have a bibliography at the website.
826120	829280	Oh, and where is the website for people who want to check it out?
829280	830280	It's flom.us.
830280	831280	F-L-O-M-M.us.
831280	832280	Flom.us.
832280	836600	And you can see much more about the game.
836600	840320	The game is available for $2.99 on iTunes.
840320	842040	Low price, just so you can play with it.
842040	843040	There it is.
843040	845660	And hopefully you sell enough of it so you can get the Android fans a piece of that too
845660	846660	at some point.
846660	847660	That would be next.
847700	848700	And other stuff.
848700	853700	And even at this point, it's been in development so long, I have ideas for other versions.
853700	854700	Flom 2.
854700	857700	Yeah, we don't have a lot of unlocking stuff in there.
857700	862060	But the idea was we just build it in a way that we could build alternate versions of
862060	863260	it with different looks.
863260	868780	Well, I noticed though, that there was still like some like you had different like vehicles,
868780	872820	like essentially, like, you know, if you're going to say straight up shooter, basically,
872820	875820	there's many different types of spaceships, but I feel weird calling it that because it's
875820	877900	not really what it what it is.
877900	881940	You have all these different types of like, modern art pieces that you can control in
881940	884940	the game, but some of them unlock right in the game.
884940	887140	It's that was just to keep you going.
887140	889020	And you can beat the game.
889020	893260	You just have you have to transform the villain into something modern.
893260	896780	And you do that by collecting power ups and just shooting him.
896780	900780	One of the concepts with just the overall look is what would it be like flying through
900780	903940	a Hannah Hawk collage?
903940	907380	And H O C H is the spelling of you want to look up her work.
907380	908380	And I do it with students.
908380	910020	She's one of my heroes too.
910020	911020	Yeah.
911020	912860	You look at that stuff and go, what if this stuff animated?
912860	915020	What if you were flying through stuff like this?
915020	918260	And then I started going farther and going, what if you're flying through a Kandinsky
918260	919260	painting?
919260	922740	What if you're flying through Cubism?
922740	926660	And it just, it became just a series of backgrounds.
926660	932780	I spent probably the first two years just making backgrounds and doing sketches.
932780	936020	And yeah, I noticed there's a lot of like little details in some of the art that's in
936020	937020	the game.
937020	938020	Like I, this instantly caught my eye.
938020	942220	I said the little bullets that my car, I think I picked a car to control the little bullets
942220	944940	that my car was shooting would say tat, tat, tat, tat, tat.
944940	947060	Like it, like it wasn't like I was throwing bullets.
947060	948060	I was throwing words.
948060	950180	I thought that was kind of neat.
950180	956820	Strangely enough, that happened later on because, because we took our time with this.
956820	960220	I was just sitting there one day and I was showing this to another graphic designer and
960220	965800	the bullets were more like a painting, little paints, paint blurs and stuff.
965800	971200	And I realized one of the big things on the list was Marinetti sound poetry.
971200	977380	Go back, look 1914, 1916, he was taking words and liberating them.
977380	982640	The Italian thing would be parole in liberta, liberated type.
982640	986460	And so this is actually a manifestation of what was sound poetry.
986460	989100	He was doing poetry based on noises.
989100	991060	And I was like, why not put the type in there?
991060	994860	And the, the font I had to use, I had to redraw it so you could actually read it while you're
994860	995860	playing the game.
995860	996860	That's awesome.
996860	1001460	Um, I want to, uh, check in with our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com and if any
1001460	1004340	of you happen to have questions for Steve, uh, you can go ahead and put that out in the
1004340	1005340	chat room.
1005340	1008480	Although I think we all realize you guys may not have all tried the game yet because many
1008480	1012580	of you are probably just now really getting to hear what it's all about besides dark soccer.
1012580	1013580	Just saying, play it!
1013580	1017260	Uh, here on the show, uh, isn't my word not good enough?
1017780	1019420	Hey guys, you're hearing a little more about it.
1019420	1022060	We gotta do something else cause when you tell people to play things, they don't want
1022060	1023060	to play them.
1023060	1025260	So avoid it like the plague.
1025260	1026260	It will make you sick.
1026260	1029820	And I would love to show a video or something, but unfortunately it is Orange Lounge Radio
1029820	1031060	so I can't really show.
1031060	1034320	So I just have to urge people to go check out the website when they can, uh, to see
1034320	1035320	a little more about it.
1035320	1038260	I have put a few photos up though on my Facebook page.
1038260	1039260	There you go.
1039260	1040260	For screen captures.
1040260	1042420	So everybody friend Jamie on Facebook immediately.
1042420	1043420	Do it now.
1043580	1049900	Well, my, my fan page, but I also put a few up on, um, my Steam profile because I've uploaded
1049900	1050900	screenshots.
1050900	1051900	Nice.
1051900	1054620	We tried to do a trailer that actually looked like the game.
1054620	1056420	I thought we came close.
1056420	1057420	Okay.
1057420	1059060	I kept, I kept seeing trailers that didn't work.
1059060	1063780	In fact, uh, as, as we were building the trailer, the game was looking better than the trailer.
1063780	1066220	So, uh, we kept rethinking everything.
1066220	1069860	Well, let me ask this real quick and I don't, I don't wanna, I do want to get to some of
1069860	1073300	the other video games y'all been playing this week and some of what's going on in the industry
1073300	1077780	and we do talk a lot of big games this week, for example, you know, big AAA titles, we'll
1077780	1079900	get into talk about the order a little later in the show.
1079900	1083860	I'm sure people are dying to know what we thought about our, uh, you know, what's going
1083860	1086520	on with all the hubble around that game right now.
1086520	1090260	But here at OLR, you know, we like to support not just the big, big stuff everybody's heard
1090260	1094060	about, but you know, we've been really big and it's kind of been a theme for us almost
1094060	1100260	so far in 2015 about the fact that, you know, anybody can create things and you know, if
1100260	1103500	you want to do a game, go out and make a game.
1103500	1106340	You know, we were talking about that with the vog jam and when we had the cooking with
1106340	1108700	unity guys on last month and so forth.
1108700	1113820	And so, you know, now we have you here talking about this game that's on iTunes where you
1113820	1118900	had an idea and you went forth and now you are a game maker.
1118900	1122500	Tell us a little more about that process because I know you didn't do it alone.
1122500	1125260	How did you collaborate with others?
1125260	1129320	How did you come together for this common vision of flom?
1129320	1133960	It was talking to a lot of people and I don't just see it as a game.
1133960	1140500	Part of my philosophy is figure out what you want to do and find some way to make it happen.
1140500	1144720	And I've been bringing up ideas of, because I've had people come back to me with this,
1144720	1149080	is okay, you have a game and you have sort of a fake art movement going on here.
1149080	1150620	Next thing would be shows.
1150620	1153920	Next thing would be bringing other artists into the fold.
1153920	1157040	And I've been talking to a bunch of people and trying to figure out what we could do
1157040	1159280	because the things do cost money.
1159280	1161580	But it's enjoy what you're doing.
1161580	1164240	That's what it's really about.
1164240	1167760	Now my background, which you started talking about, I've been a graphic designer for a
1167760	1168960	long time.
1168960	1170600	I've worked for corporations.
1170600	1175560	I've worked for, you name it, accountants, lawyers.
1175560	1179280	I've worked for everything you could possibly think of, bands.
1179280	1185140	In fact, I started stocking a band and that's how I got my musician.
1185140	1189820	I was listening to a lot of garbage and I got to know this wonderful band called The
1189820	1190820	Start.
1190820	1195420	They were playing nearby and I became friends with their drummer and she did the music for
1195420	1196700	the game.
1196700	1199700	And that was one of the plans even before I was doing a game that we should work on
1199700	1200700	something together.
1200700	1201700	Interesting.
1201700	1205860	So it's kind of like you, over the years in the interactions you've had with people, you
1205860	1208980	kind of, it sounds like you've kind of been keeping like a Rolodex a little bit in your
1208980	1209980	mind.
1209980	1211040	Like, I want to work with her on the music.
1211040	1214020	I want to work with him on the programming.
1214020	1218220	You've basically been assembling the Avengers for the past few years.
1218220	1219220	That's what it is.
1219220	1220220	You're Nick Fury.
1220220	1221220	Gnome who finished the game.
1221220	1222220	Nick Flommy.
1222220	1223220	You're Nick Flommy.
1223220	1224220	Yeah.
1224220	1228300	I have both eyes though, for now.
1228300	1233220	Gnome, who was the final programmer, is a superhero.
1233220	1235860	He brought a smoothness to the animation.
1235860	1240860	He brought some stuff in there that's so subtle that what's great was just telling him what
1240860	1242860	my vision was for everything.
1242860	1247160	And even when I say smoothness, the vision was to make it look like old animated stuff
1247160	1253020	from the 20s without getting so hokey that you just have a lot of dust and dirt on everything.
1253020	1258340	So those little details, he really understood and it did take us a while to get it together.
1258340	1259340	Just pulling it together.
1259340	1261500	But our projects will go on forever.
1261500	1262500	We know that.
1262500	1268100	YYR is in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com saying collaborations like that are so great.
1268100	1273200	And I know YYR is very similar to what you did where he's kind of like a single person
1273200	1279160	developing his own games, but I know he had a friend that did a lot of music that's helped
1279160	1283780	him out with some of the music stuff in like Snake 360 and some of the games that he did.
1283780	1291420	So that's great to hear just people that enjoy games who have all these different skills
1291420	1293420	coming together to assemble their own Avengers teams.
1293420	1295480	I think that's so neat.
1295480	1298360	I do want to move forward with some of the other stuff we have on deck for tonight's
1298360	1299360	show.
1299360	1305840	But Steve, one kind of last chance to pitch to our listeners, why should they go check
1305840	1308280	out Flom in the iTunes store right away?
1308280	1310460	Well, it goes a little bit farther.
1310460	1315340	It did grow out of education, which is, it's that little thing that no one wants to talk
1315340	1316340	about.
1316340	1322160	But one of my plans with the game was to bring an educational element to it.
1322160	1326120	Another thing I remember as a kid was we'd watch TV shows and we'd learn something from
1326120	1328800	them and they were a bit more heavy-handed about it.
1328800	1334300	So my approach to the game was everything in there relates to something that has existed
1334300	1336560	in art history.
1336560	1342080	And it became actually part of, I didn't finish it, but I was getting a master's in education.
1342080	1346000	And the game is based on using alter media to get people to learn stuff.
1346000	1349300	So if you're playing the game and you don't know what's in the background and you go looking
1349300	1351780	for it, chances are you're going to find something.
1351780	1358780	So if you're a gamer and an art history nerd, there definitely is something here for you.
1358780	1361580	This might help studying a lot better than just memorization.
1361580	1363460	And you know what?
1363460	1365720	Edutainment games are so important.
1365720	1367540	And we were just talking about this last week.
1367540	1368540	It had come up on the show.
1368540	1372540	We were reminiscing down the line about games that were educational.
1372540	1375640	And some of the games I remember in my youth, and I think a lot of people think about things
1375640	1380820	like Carmen Sandiego, Number Munchers, there were a lot of big, big ones.
1380860	1381860	Oregon Trail.
1381860	1383620	Of course, that's the one I think everybody knows, that one, the Oregon Trail.
1383620	1385020	I did some work for them too.
1385020	1388020	I had Oregon Trail all over my computer at one point.
1388020	1389880	That may have seeded this thinking.
1389880	1390880	Get out.
1390880	1391880	What did you do for Oregon Trail?
1391880	1394740	I did a whole bunch of marketing sell sheets for them.
1394740	1400120	And then I did like one of the, it was like a redrawing of a redrawing of Carmen Sandiego.
1400120	1402180	So purple and red everywhere.
1402180	1407140	You invited a guy that worked on Oregon Trail to this show and neglected to tell me?
1407140	1408140	Oops.
1408460	1411460	I worked on so many projects, I didn't even remember.
1411460	1412460	Oops.
1412460	1413460	Well.
1413460	1416260	Like I was paying attention in class.
1416260	1417260	I mean, oh, hi Steve.
1417260	1419020	No, I never came up, did it?
1419020	1421180	Now I'm in the presence of royalty.
1421180	1422180	I mean, but think about it.
1422180	1423180	Those games.
1423180	1424180	I wasn't on the main team.
1424180	1426780	This was more of a marketing side of things.
1426780	1428820	It's like you talk to the guy that did it though.
1428820	1431100	It's like the degrees are lessening, right?
1431100	1436580	So they had another thing called Nelly Nut that never premiered in the US.
1436580	1439620	And I don't know what happened to it, but I did all these materials for it.
1439620	1440620	Interesting.
1440620	1441620	Someone look it up.
1441620	1442620	I think I might have looked it up.
1442620	1443620	Something like that.
1443620	1444620	Did you do anything with Odell Lake?
1444620	1446620	Because a lot of the fans are there.
1446620	1447620	No.
1447620	1451780	I got sick of red and purple after a while.
1451780	1454700	There's a Nelly Nut TV, that was a 2003 TV show.
1454700	1456860	Yeah, well it was before that.
1456860	1458260	So I don't know what happened with it.
1458260	1465700	Well I did check out the game myself and you know, it's such a neat like style to it.
1466700	1473020	I think it's different than if I were to tell you, go download this shooter game on iOS.
1473020	1475420	You're going to have this perception in your mind of what that is.
1475420	1480880	But like Flom is different and it really is kind of like shooter meets this other world
1480880	1481880	over there.
1481880	1483140	So it's definitely worth visiting.
1483140	1484380	That was the hard part.
1484380	1489180	The only other thing I can pitch really quick is I've been on social media for a while.
1489180	1490180	Tumblr.
1490180	1492020	There are two Tumblr pages.
1492020	1495200	We have a music one now that's a spillover page.
1495200	1498600	But it started with the concept of modern art is the avant-garde.
1498600	1501140	And what does the avant-garde mean back then?
1501140	1503900	What does it meant since and what does it mean today?
1503900	1508240	So right now on just Flomis.
1508240	1509240	Just look for Flomis.
1509240	1510240	It comes up.
1510240	1515180	Flomis on Tumblr and Flomishin, which we do playlists every week.
1515180	1518420	Right now we're covering London Fashion Week because there's some really cool stuff coming
1518420	1521620	out of Europe right now.
1521620	1526400	It's about looking at design and art, not just the old stuff, but contemporary stuff.
1526400	1528940	And I hope to just keep going with this and see where it ends up.
1528940	1529940	All right.
1529940	1530940	Well, best of luck to you.
1530940	1532740	I did link them all in the chat room earlier.
1532740	1533740	Awesome.
1533740	1537020	But for the podcast listeners, since you don't have the links, we will link it in the show
1537020	1539380	notes of course over at vognetwork.com.
1539380	1541220	But again, the website's really easy to find.
1541220	1545260	It's just Flom, F-L-O-M-M dot U-S.
1545260	1546260	There you go.
1546260	1547260	And best of luck to you.
1547260	1548940	Steve, please feel free to stay throughout the show.
1548940	1551820	I know you don't play a lot of the modern games that we'll probably get into talking
1551820	1553940	about, but we love our retro stuff too.
1553940	1557580	Feel free to jump in with anything that you have to add, but if you have to go, I understand
1557580	1558580	that as well.
1558580	1562220	I always wonder why they walk off talk shows after a while, because you just sit in the
1562220	1563220	back room and stare at the wall.
1563220	1567620	That's when you go in the green room and eat the free food and drink the wine.
1567620	1568620	Sadly, this is a-
1568620	1570940	You just stuffed a chimichanga down my throat.
1570940	1571940	As I mentioned-
1571940	1573940	And that means something in art.
1573940	1578900	As I mentioned when you first got here off air, we're very much hobbyists here at OLR.
1578900	1581380	And it's, I was like, welcome to my house.
1581380	1584580	Here's the spare room that happens to be a studio.
1584580	1585580	All right.
1585580	1586580	Anyway.
1586580	1589420	YYR asked real quick, if there's time, can we ask if there'll be a demo?
1589420	1595540	YYR saying that a demo or a light version is usually very convincing on selling these.
1595540	1597200	Has that something you guys have given any thought to?
1597200	1599100	We're going to wait a little bit.
1599100	1603300	We had a temporary demo, it was a little bit clunky about a year ago.
1603300	1605900	And the fun thing, actually, I guess this was a good thing.
1605900	1608940	People were getting addicted to it, but we looked and said, no one's going to buy it
1608940	1611320	if they get so hooked on the demo.
1611320	1615580	So I do have one idea I haven't told anyone about yet, which is if we do have a demo,
1615580	1617460	it will be a pared down version of the game.
1617460	1619860	You won't be able to beat anything.
1619860	1623100	And the main boss will not show up for the game.
1623100	1627340	You're going to have his stand in, which is just sort of the middle manager in the game.
1627340	1630420	He just sort of shows up and he's not going to be much of a challenge and you get to blow
1630420	1631420	him up really quick.
1631420	1632420	Good.
1632420	1634140	Then Bobby will be able to complete the demo and buy the game that way.
1634180	1635180	There you go.
1638180	1640740	So basically you're going to put out a Bobby Black Wolf mode.
1640740	1643260	That's an inside joke here, I know you wouldn't understand, but you're going to put out a
1643260	1645260	Bobby Black Wolf mode as the demo.
1645260	1649620	Or to date myself, it's Johnny Carson when he had a guest host on Monday.
1649620	1651860	Let's see if anyone gets that.
1651860	1652860	I actually get it.
1652860	1653860	I do.
1653860	1654860	All right.
1654860	1655860	That's amazing.
1655860	1660620	That's actually kind of funny because Dan and I were just watching old Carson episodes
1660620	1663580	like two days ago.
1664020	1667820	YYR is suggesting have the main boss show up, fight for five seconds, and then it cuts
1667820	1668820	you off.
1668820	1672020	You guys, you guys may have to collaborate off of it in there and see, hold on.
1672020	1673020	Oh yeah.
1673020	1674020	There you go.
1674020	1677820	That's the Kanye just jumps in and says, nah, I'm going to let you finish if you buy the
1677820	1678820	game.
1678820	1681420	Well, that's another career girl goal.
1681420	1682420	I want to win.
1682420	1683860	I want to win a Grammy.
1683860	1687140	So when he comes up there, I'm going to start a fist fight.
1687140	1688140	It's a noble goal.
1688140	1691540	He's going to take me down, but I'm not going out with it.
1691540	1692540	Getting a few punches.
1692580	1694460	I have a feeling he won't be back.
1694460	1697420	Just call it, call it, call it a hunch, but I have a feeling he won't be back.
1697420	1698420	All right.
1698420	1702260	Anyway, we got to get into some of the other games going on besides just the floms in the
1702260	1703260	world.
1703260	1705860	We want to talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been
1705860	1707260	playing this week.
1707260	1709380	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1709380	1710380	I played flom.
1710380	1712460	Why haven't the rest of you?
1712460	1713460	No.
1713460	1714460	I did.
1714460	1718900	I played actually a crap load of dragon age today because I'm about ready to wrap up my
1718900	1719900	fanfic.
1720620	1725620	Five chapters ahead again every time I, I've been double posting chapters every day this
1725620	1729020	week because the story is burning its way out of my brain.
1729020	1730960	Like it won't stop.
1730960	1735660	And hopefully this is going to give me my inspiration to actually sit down and work
1735660	1741860	on my book because I have another book idea that I've been wanting to do for a while too.
1741860	1749620	I also got to play with somebody else's new 3DS and it's actually kind of comfortable
1749660	1751180	and I like the red one.
1751180	1755180	I understand why Shane imported a blue one because the blue one is very pretty and this
1755180	1757900	is Shane and it's a shame.
1757900	1761380	But I like the red one and I think I might want it.
1761380	1769620	However I did also finally sit down and play the Oregon Trail.
1769620	1770620	You know the Oregon Trail.
1770620	1773340	Oh, not the Oregon Trail, but the Oregon Trail.
1773340	1774340	Oh yes.
1774340	1775660	That's the, that's like the zombie one.
1775660	1776660	That's the riff on that.
1776660	1777660	Right?
1777660	1778660	Exactly.
1778700	1784500	We drove our station wagon through the mountains, stopped at a few malls, killed some zombies
1784500	1790420	and stole cans of food, and then everybody but me died.
1790420	1792140	The end.
1792140	1794780	Was this real life or was this a game?
1794780	1796900	Dot, dot, dot.
1796900	1797900	Dot, dot, dot.
1797900	1800140	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1800140	1804220	I played a little bit of Lego Marvel Super Heroes because my son wanted to play that
1804220	1806980	and I usually just play for a second.
1807020	1810540	I've been noticing, like I said, that game is glitchier and glitchier every time I play
1810540	1811540	it.
1811540	1813180	Mostly I worked on my game this week.
1813180	1817820	So I was trying to make a second level for it, but instead I ended up going back and
1817820	1820340	just kind of tweaking some of the gameplay stuff.
1820340	1825380	Like one of the things I had before was that the scale of everything makes the curbs a
1825380	1827500	little too high to actually just get over.
1827500	1831740	You can't just drive over them so that's why I added the jump in there in the first place.
1831740	1835260	So it's still a little bit difficult to get over them and my son is having trouble trying
1835260	1839380	to play the game and so I'm going to make all these curb ramp things so that you just
1839380	1841620	drive over them and it works just fine.
1841620	1843260	You need robot goats.
1843260	1846580	Hey, I can put it on the list.
1846580	1847580	Seriously, any idea.
1847580	1849300	I will draw you a robot goat.
1849300	1851140	I don't need a robot goat drawn.
1851140	1852220	I can do that.
1852220	1853220	I'm just saying.
1853220	1854220	I'm putting all-
1854220	1857340	Maybe she wants to draw you one as a present.
1857340	1858340	Fine.
1858340	1860860	It's fine.
1860860	1862500	But anyways, yeah.
1862500	1863500	I added more detail to it.
1863500	1867700	I was going to have a new video to upload but apparently my video was too epic for YouTube
1867700	1873620	to encode and so it's like, sorry, I can't encode this two gigabyte file that you're
1873620	1874620	trying.
1874620	1879220	It was an uncompressed AVI file that had like 60 frames per second, 1080p.
1879220	1883700	It's just like, you got to put some sort of compression on this thing because I can't
1883700	1884860	deal with it.
1884860	1887900	So yeah, unfortunately I couldn't upload that.
1887900	1888900	Hopefully soon.
1888900	1890780	But I got a lot of other stuff done.
1890780	1896060	I got my script to handle falling off the map so now it respawns you and everything
1896060	1900500	which is kind of cool and added more detail so it looks a little bit more polished.
1900500	1904180	So I'm just adding polish right now because the problem is I don't want to go back and
1904180	1907260	have to edit the map later on.
1907260	1912180	I just want to have that map being able to persist between levels so that's why I'm making
1912180	1914460	my fixes now and then I'll do the levels.
1914460	1917140	That and I haven't decided what I'm doing for level two yet.
1917140	1922100	Well, I got to have something easy to ease into everything so that people can kind of
1922100	1924980	understand the gameplay part because the first level is not really much of anything other
1924980	1927580	than falling through the map.
1927580	1930820	And so the first level has got to be kind of like, hey, here's how to play it a little
1930820	1933540	bit and then it's going to get fucking nuts.
1933540	1939300	But I have to have one level in between falling through the map and fucking nuts.
1939300	1941980	So you have to have your kind of super basic level.
1941980	1946920	Yeah, so I haven't figured out what broken thing I want to add to that yet.
1946920	1947920	So I haven't figured it.
1947920	1952660	And once I figure it out, then it'll be easy because I have a list like it's growing every
1952660	1957960	day and my son keeps bugging me about it because one of the ideas he wanted is like, you should
1957960	1963360	have mops on your car and you clean up stuff on the road.
1963360	1966320	I'm like, okay, so you just drive over it and it cleans up.
1966320	1969760	No, you should shoot the mops out the front of your car and it cleans up stuff.
1969760	1973280	I'm like, okay, I'm taking any idea you have and I'm putting it in the game.
1973280	1974720	I don't care how stupid it is.
1974720	1975720	It's going in there.
1976720	1977720	Everything.
1977720	1983520	And so it'll be fun, but I'm working on it.
1983520	1984520	All right.
1984520	1985520	Well, good luck.
1985520	1989480	It's not as easy as it sounds to make a game, that's for sure.
1989480	1994620	My gaming week, I played quite a few classics that I keep talking about here on the show
1994620	1997480	every week, like Diablo three continuing on with seasons.
1997480	2001080	I'm already paragon 50 for this season and climbing.
2001080	2003760	I have to ask you, since you brought up Diablo, sure.
2003800	2017520	Did you see that, nevermind, they did the Icewind Dale ultimate edition came out, re-released.
2017520	2018520	I didn't know if you'd be interested in that.
2018520	2020040	I was going to tell you about it, but I forgot.
2020040	2021040	So I interrupted you to tell you.
2021040	2022040	That's all right.
2022040	2023040	I'll have to check that out.
2023040	2024040	Okay.
2024040	2025040	Bye.
2025040	2026040	All right.
2026040	2027040	Bye.
2027040	2028040	You're leaving?
2028040	2029040	All right.
2029040	2030040	So still been playing Diablo three, working on seasons, logged into Final Fantasy 14 for
2030040	2033320	the first time in like three weeks the other night and I kind of missed it and I hadn't
2033320	2034600	really been doing the new content.
2034600	2038360	So I finally was like, all right, time to suck it up and do this Ampedor keep hard mode.
2038360	2039860	And it was actually a really fun dungeon.
2039860	2041240	So I enjoyed that.
2041240	2044280	I've been playing other standbys on consoles as well.
2044280	2047920	Like I had a friend over earlier today and we were playing some stuff on the Wii U because
2047920	2053360	we use a great living room console to play Mario Kart eight and super smash brothers,
2053360	2056960	of course, which I feel like I'm getting a little better at smash brothers.
2056960	2057960	Thank God.
2057960	2059360	Because I was, I was really worried there for a minute.
2059360	2062960	I love that video that you put out, the realistic clapping.
2062960	2063960	The what?
2063960	2064960	Have you ever seen that?
2064960	2066600	The realistic clapping in Smash Brothers?
2066600	2068880	Oh, I saw a link to it, but I didn't watch it.
2068880	2069880	What is it?
2069880	2072560	It's like, it's just basically someone adding fully sounds to the clapping.
2072560	2075800	Cause a lot of it, you know, if you watch it, how they actually clap, it's really stupid.
2075800	2080640	But like some of them are really funny, like Donkey Kong, because there's like, it's like,
2080640	2081640	it's just really silly.
2081640	2082640	Okay.
2082640	2083640	Yeah.
2083640	2084640	Like at the end of the match, some of the clapping is really silly.
2084640	2085640	Okay.
2085640	2086640	I gotcha.
2086640	2087640	I gotcha.
2087640	2088640	Um, let's see.
2088640	2092360	So, uh, there was, um, that, and then we were speaking of living room games, we were playing
2092360	2095200	Jackbox Party Pack, which is always a good time.
2095200	2100080	And, uh, I, I literally cried from laughing so hard at one of Alan's drawings.
2100080	2101080	I loved it so much.
2101080	2104880	I put it on my Twitter over at twitter.com slash sky, S K I E.
2104880	2109600	You have to see it and I've submitted it as evidence for why Alan is the best drawful
2109600	2110600	player in the world.
2110600	2115200	Uh, so hopefully you'll check that out at some point, um, new stuff though, I did actually
2115200	2116200	play some new games.
2116200	2117880	I'll talk about these very quickly.
2117880	2121600	Um, I played Pokemon shuffle on the 3DS.
2121600	2125920	I have a full review that's going to go up to vog network probably tomorrow, Monday,
2125920	2129920	uh, which I wrote out just because I had a lot of very strong feelings about the game.
2129920	2132560	So I just kind of wanted to get it all out, uh, and write it out.
2132560	2136200	So I don't necessarily want to spoil all of it, but I will say this much.
2136200	2138000	Um, it is a free game.
2138000	2144600	And so when a game is free, you have to really kinda, you know, you have to go, okay, well
2144600	2146200	at the end of the day, it's free.
2146200	2148800	So even if it's a bad game, it's still free.
2148800	2149800	Yars.
2149800	2150800	Huh?
2151000	2152000	That's true.
2152000	2154200	I would say Pokemon shuffle is still better than Yaris.
2154200	2155200	I'll give it that.
2155200	2159440	But I would say being kicked in the crotch is better than Yaris.
2159440	2167160	My biggest problem with Pokemon shuffle is that the game, the balance of the 99 cent
2167160	2171400	jewels that you buy on the Nintendo network and what those jewels actually buy you in
2171400	2174600	the game is a little bit off to me.
2174600	2180200	And mostly, and most importantly at the end of the day, here's where I believe Nintendo's
2180200	2183760	biggest problem is with this and, and some of the Nintendo fanboys are going to want
2183760	2187700	to fight me on this, but really think this one out guys, because this is what really
2187700	2189660	bothers me about Pokemon shuffle.
2189660	2195460	So Pokemon shuffle is kind of trying to be like a Facebook or a mobile game type of experience.
2195460	2196760	Like that's the free to play game, right?
2196760	2203120	It's trying to be the Facebook or free mobile game game that's available on your 3DS instead,
2203120	2204120	right?
2204120	2206960	Because Nintendo doesn't really want to make stuff for mobile.
2206960	2210800	So they're making, I guess, these more mobile and free experiences that are available on
2210800	2212300	the 3DS.
2212300	2216600	But the problem and what's missing is that on Facebook, like what's huge on Facebook
2216600	2218740	and mobile right now, like trivia crack, right?
2218740	2219740	Is like a big one.
2219740	2222360	There's a lot of people playing that on Facebook and a lot of people playing that on mobile.
2222360	2223940	Why do we play trivia crack?
2223940	2228800	We are signing into trivia crack so we can play against our friends and compete with
2228800	2229920	our friends.
2229920	2233680	And when we beat our friends in a match, we go, ha ha, I beat you and oh, wasn't that
2233680	2236920	question funny and you're trying to work your way up the leaderboards and all this
2236920	2237920	stuff, right?
2237920	2244480	Pokemon shuffle is a social media game with no social interaction.
2244480	2248520	Now some, you know, people that maybe have gotten more enjoyment out of it than I did
2248520	2251080	might say, but Rob, you're forgetting about street passes.
2251080	2255940	You can street pass people and you'll get their little card and it tells you, you know,
2255940	2257720	about themselves and so forth.
2257720	2261980	Eh, I say it's a really weak implementation that's next to nothing.
2261980	2266700	All it tells you is this is how many Pokemon they've collected, eh.
2266700	2271660	And like when you play Pokemon X and Y or white and black, ruby, sapphire, whatever
2271660	2274180	it is, you're collecting the Pokemon.
2274180	2276380	You might give them your own names.
2276380	2278980	You're going to customize their abilities.
2278980	2281820	You start to, you start to breed the Pokemon at some point, right?
2281820	2285260	So you start to feel a little more connection to this collection you're making.
2285260	2287180	Pokemon shuffle, eh eh.
2287180	2292220	You fight this particular Pokemon and there's a 40% chance you're going to catch it.
2292220	2298620	Ubi, you can increase that to a 70% chance if you buy a great ball for 2,500 coins.
2298620	2300740	Oh, you're out of coins?
2300740	2306220	Why don't you spend a 99 cent jewel on more coins to up your chances of collecting this
2306220	2313580	Pokemon that at the end of the day will increase the number on your street pass card by one?
2313580	2320060	So my issue with Pokemon shuffle is that as fun as a puzzler as it is for the 15 minutes
2320060	2324620	you play it before you run out of energy, there's no point to the game.
2324620	2327540	There's no point to the game.
2327540	2332040	So that was, that was where I got lost a little bit on Pokemon shuffle.
2332040	2335400	But for the 15 minutes you play it, it's a fun little puzzler game.
2335400	2340120	So I didn't give the game an F, but I didn't exactly give it an A either.
2340120	2343420	So anyway, there's that, Pokemon shuffle.
2343420	2346580	One other game I'm going to talk about, and I hate to be so negative, usually I'm so positive
2346580	2347580	on games.
2347580	2350500	There's so many great games out there, but what, let it go.
2350500	2356180	I can't let this one go because this game that I played was bad and I was really disappointed
2356180	2358080	because it was a game I was looking forward to.
2358080	2361740	We talked about it a couple of weeks ago on the show and I was like, they're making this
2361740	2362740	game.
2362740	2366580	They're going to remake Qbert for the PlayStation four.
2366580	2370540	It's not good.
2370540	2377480	And I hate to say it because I'm a fan of Qbert, but I'm not a fan of Qbert Reloaded.
2377480	2380980	When you play the game on PlayStation four, you can play classic Qbert.
2380980	2386580	And actually, funny enough, where the game is best is when you're just doing the classic,
2386580	2389840	you know, arcade board emulation, whatever.
2389840	2392980	If that's all you want out of Qbert on PlayStation four, then cool.
2392980	2393980	You're going to get it.
2393980	2396220	But yes, then there's this new mode as well.
2396220	2400700	It's the Qbert Reloaded where, yes, they've switched things to now it's a hexagonal board
2400700	2402580	and I'm okay with that.
2402580	2409740	I'm okay with the switch to a hexagonal board if it controlled well, but it doesn't.
2409740	2412860	And the game really dies on its controls.
2412860	2420060	I have never seen a game where the controls were like the reason why it sank.
2420060	2423760	And I think for me, the controls in Qbert Reloaded, awful.
2423760	2428520	And it's just, the old Qbert game from the 80s really snaps.
2428520	2430120	You know, I think that was the thing about it.
2430120	2433520	Yeah, it has the joystick that's in the four angular directions.
2433520	2437520	It's you know, upright, up left, down left, you know, that whole thing.
2437520	2439180	But it really snaps when you play it.
2439180	2441800	And I noticed that when playing in the classic mode.
2441800	2446240	But when you're playing in this hexagonal new Qbert mode, it's not just the fact that
2446240	2448280	they made them six sided squares.
2448280	2449580	That I can deal with.
2449580	2451880	But the fact is that Qbert doesn't snap.
2451880	2456400	He kind of slogs.
2456400	2459440	You have to probably get your hands on it and play it yourself, which I'm actually not
2459440	2460660	recommending you do.
2460660	2464480	But if you really go look at a YouTube or something and look at how he moves.
2464480	2465760	And it's just so different.
2465760	2468960	And it just feels cheap.
2468960	2471940	Especially for like a PlayStation 4 game, it feels cheap.
2471940	2474820	And I'm okay with retro and classic things.
2474820	2479920	But when I'm looking at this game going, didn't they have a Qbert on PlayStation 1 that was
2479920	2481960	more fun than this?
2481960	2484680	There was a Qbert on ColecoVision that was really fun.
2484680	2488400	There was a Qbert on PlayStation 1 that was like a Qbert reimagined or whatever that was
2488400	2489400	better than this.
2489400	2490400	And I hate to say it.
2490400	2491640	Yeah, I do remember that.
2491640	2493880	I know that there's people that worked hard on this game.
2493880	2497280	And I don't like giving games bad reviews for that.
2497280	2503600	But I'm sorry, I have a responsibility to say that this game just it's not it wasn't
2503600	2506300	it's only worth it to play the classic Qbert game.
2506300	2508360	Just I wouldn't even really touch the new one.
2508360	2513560	It's it's I can't I sat there the other night trying to move around the board.
2513560	2517080	And I just fell off the board repeatedly fell off the board.
2517080	2521400	It'd be nice if maybe I could re customize the controls or something maybe make the buttons
2521400	2522400	hopper.
2522400	2524220	I don't even know if that would fix it, though.
2524220	2528400	And then you saw that video I uploaded right where the little springy guy was his name
2528400	2532920	Clyde is name quietly, which was chasing you down the thing, right.
2532920	2537020	So you the trick is you go to a flying disk to get away from quietly right.
2537020	2541640	So here's the thing, quietly grabs me right as I'm about to get on the disk.
2541640	2543120	So I die.
2543120	2545580	But I die as I'm falling on the disk.
2545580	2549540	And the disk takes my dead body to the top of the grid, and then drops me on the top
2549540	2550540	of the grid.
2550540	2551540	That's awesome.
2551540	2553820	So now not only am I dead, but I burned the disk.
2553820	2555100	That's still really funny.
2555100	2560700	And I'm not sure if it's because it's a heart meter now instead of just I was like the hell
2560700	2561700	just happened.
2561700	2563080	I just I didn't like it.
2563080	2564200	It's not funny when you're playing it.
2564200	2565200	I know that.
2565200	2566200	No.
2566380	2572160	It's a part of Qbert's corpse lying, you know, desiccating on this disk as it's floating
2572160	2573880	to heaven.
2573880	2575320	Okay.
2575320	2576320	That's really funny.
2576320	2582200	I would commission art of that continues in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says,
2582200	2585400	why would anyone remake Qbert?
2585400	2587960	It's hard to remake a classic game, right?
2587960	2590160	Like, but some of them are done really well.
2590160	2596160	And I would say Pac-Man, not only Pac-Man versus but Pac-Man.
2597120	2598120	Why can't I?
2598120	2599120	Pac-Man CE.
2599120	2600120	Yeah.
2600120	2601120	Yeah.
2601120	2602120	Championship edition thing.
2602120	2603120	Thank you.
2603120	2604120	Why can't I?
2604120	2605120	DX especially is so good.
2605120	2607400	Like that's a great reboot of a classic game.
2607400	2613080	And I would say, well, if you can reinvent a classic game like that, then that's a, that's
2613080	2615840	a note of how you do it really.
2615840	2618200	But this is not, you know, it's just not.
2618200	2623280	And I think, I think Qbert is a classic game that a lot of people really forget about.
2623280	2625160	I think it was a really cool game.
2625160	2628840	There was actually a proper sequel to Qbert called Qbert's Cubes.
2628840	2633880	But I bet nobody really knows the game unless maybe you found it randomly on a mayhem emulator
2633880	2634880	somewhere.
2634880	2637520	It wasn't a, it wasn't a very big, big deal.
2637520	2638520	So anyway.
2638520	2641120	It wasn't really that good of a game either.
2641120	2644200	Tigerclaw in chat says, could be worse.
2644200	2646440	What if they remake Dig Dug?
2646440	2647440	They did.
2647440	2649320	They did do a Dig Dug on Xbox 360, didn't they?
2649320	2651240	Yeah, because they had all these different versions.
2651240	2657240	They did Dig Dug and they also did Rally, whatever the other Rally game was.
2657240	2662680	All they really did to Dig Dug, all they really did was it was the same game with high definition
2662680	2663680	graphics.
2663680	2666240	But like, it was like, you were still running like the same ROM.
2666240	2669160	It was just like a prettier graphic overlay on top of it.
2669160	2672840	So, and that was, that was okay because they only charged $5 for it too.
2672840	2674040	And it was, it was fine.
2674040	2675360	I, well, I played that one.
2675360	2678480	It was part of one of those comp, the Namco compilations that they had.
2678480	2679760	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
2679800	2682800	There was one in the arcades in the nineties that was pretty good too, that I actually
2682800	2683800	really liked.
2683800	2684800	So.
2684800	2687840	Oh, Act Deft naming another classic reinvention that was really good.
2687840	2690560	Space Invaders Extreme was extremely fun.
2690560	2691560	That's right.
2691560	2693400	That was a frickin rad game.
2693400	2697600	So yeah, classic game reinventions can be done right, but I can also understand the
2697600	2698800	hesitation a lot.
2698800	2702520	Qbert is not the first to be done poorly.
2702520	2703800	So there you go.
2703800	2708440	Anyway, all right, let's get on to, let's get on to some other news instead of just
2708440	2709440	our gaming week.
2709440	2712320	Let's get into what has been going on around the video game world this week.
2712320	2714160	Quickly, some housekeeping.
2714160	2719560	We will be here next week on March 1st, but we will not be here on March 8th.
2719560	2724400	That is because I am going with Bobby Blackwolf and some of our listeners.
2724400	2726640	PAX East is where I'm going to be.
2726640	2730720	So I'm looking forward to seeing you guys all around the show.
2730720	2733160	I imagine it's going to be a pretty crazy crowd.
2733160	2736400	I'm going there as a fan just like anybody else.
2736400	2740560	So I'll probably be trying to get some hands on with any classic games that they have there.
2740560	2744600	If there's Qbert there, the classic version on the ColecoVision, I'll probably be there
2744600	2745600	playing it.
2745600	2748880	So I remember the first time I went to PAX East, they had a really great little classic
2748880	2749880	game room.
2749880	2751920	So I hope to check that out.
2751920	2756120	Please, if I don't have the VOG shirt on, I'm sure Bobby will.
2756120	2759880	So if you see one of us at the show, please, please pull us over and say hello.
2759880	2762400	We'd love to say hi and meet you and talk to you.
2762400	2764280	And yeah, don't be shy.
2764280	2765560	We're gamers just like you.
2765560	2766920	So we'll be around.
2766920	2768320	And whatever else they show.
2768320	2770280	Final Fantasy XIV is having a panel at PAX East.
2770280	2772600	So I personally can't wait to go and check that out.
2772600	2774560	So we will be there at PAX East.
2774560	2779920	Speaking of Bobby, I mentioned earlier in the show that he had a pretty cool show tonight.
2779920	2784320	And I promised I would give this a shout out here on OLR and I want to make good on that.
2784320	2788360	Bobby had a Kickstarter campaign on his show tonight.
2788360	2795240	And it's for a, it's not really a game, but it's a virtual reality rock opera.
2795240	2798720	And they described it as Fantasia meets Tron.
2798720	2802520	And I was kind of like, that is awesome meets awesomer.
2802520	2804240	So I was a fan of this.
2804240	2807520	This was Nurin, the New Renaissance is the name of the project.
2807520	2810080	And you can find that over on Kickstarter.
2810080	2814680	If you need the link, it'll be over on vognetwork.com and Bobby's latest show notes.
2814680	2820480	But one of the guys behind this happens to be Vert, who's a pretty well-known composer
2820480	2821480	these days.
2821480	2824640	You know, did you happen to play the Ducktales remastered?
2825040	2826840	Did you play that in the soundtrack to that game?
2826840	2828040	Yeah, that was Vert.
2828040	2833920	So Vert, along with Jesse Seeley, who are behind this game, the core team that make
2833920	2837240	up this experience, they were both on Bobby's show tonight.
2837240	2839280	And it was a great interview and a great listen.
2839280	2843120	So I wanted to, I promise, because Vert actually came into the chat room and was chatting with
2843120	2844680	folks during Bobby's show.
2844680	2847000	So I promised Vert I would give it a shout out here on OLR.
2847000	2854600	So shout out Nurin over on Kickstarter, N-U-R-E-N, $15 will back the experience.
2854600	2855560	And the soundtrack.
2855560	2858680	And I was like, you know what, if nothing else, that soundtrack is going to rule.
2858680	2862640	They actually played a little bit of it on Bobby's show, and it was awesome.
2862640	2863640	So there you go.
2863640	2864640	All right.
2864640	2865640	That's our housekeeping.
2865640	2867600	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
2867600	2872960	We're also on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, and google.com slash
2872960	2876440	plus orange lounge radio.
2876440	2878320	Let's get into some news.
2878320	2881080	There's a bit more going on this week than there was in previous weeks.
2881080	2883480	Some big topics we got to get into tonight, right, Loki?
2883480	2889360	Yeah, so everybody wants to know, why can't you just find amiibos out in the stores?
2889360	2895640	Well, apparently, according to the president of Nintendo, they're blaming the labor strike
2895640	2898640	that apparently is going on in the US.
2898640	2902880	They're saying that for the last six months, labor negotiations on the west coast of the
2902880	2909620	United States have made getting goods to shore slow, as the amount of berths open are lower
2909620	2912560	than usual, and therefore harbors are congested.
2912560	2917240	Many of the goods sent to the US have not arrived to their destination, however, this
2917240	2921800	had little effect on amiibos and software sales, as they are light enough that we can
2921800	2925340	even ship by air, if we have to.
2925340	2931160	Even though the new Nintendo DS has had a handicap against its supply, the public has
2931160	2934940	still shown huge interest in it, and its sales are phenomenal.
2934940	2942660	So they're blaming that as the reason why you're not able to find them in the United
2942660	2943660	States.
2943660	2945180	No, there's that one guy buying them all.
2945180	2951300	I just, I don't believe that that's all the case, and he even kind of goes back and saying,
2951300	2955900	well, true, this is holding things up, however, they're actually light enough that we can
2955900	2961220	ship them by air, so he kind of goes back on his excuse.
2961220	2963180	This is an awfully convenient excuse kind of thing?
2963180	2964180	Yeah.
2964420	2968500	I'm willing to hear it out a little bit, like, okay, like, you know, the 3DS, especially
2968500	2972860	in the case of the new 3DSs, I feel like the amiibo thing's been going on longer than the
2972860	2977100	Port Strike, so I'm not, I don't know how much I buy it there.
2977100	2983100	But with the new 3DSs, demand for that does seem to be a lot higher than, like, it's not
2983100	2987980	even so much the Monster Hunter system and the Majora's Mask system, because those sold
2987980	2991260	out within seconds, right, and that was way before, those were the preorders when there
2991260	2993500	was no Port Strike or whatever thing going on.
2993540	2996940	We're talking about, it's even hard right now to find just the plain red systems and
2996940	3000820	the, what other color is there, red and black, something like that.
3000820	3004260	They're just, I'm not really interested in buying one right now, so that's why I haven't
3004260	3005260	tried to run out and find one.
3005260	3010300	I don't know why they're so popular right now when there's nothing exclusive for them.
3010300	3014980	I can't figure it out either, to be honest, and I have a lot of friends that are buying
3014980	3017700	them, and I don't mean to, like, well, I do, I should do this.
3017700	3020980	I understand that, like, you get them for the future and stuff, but.
3020980	3025780	And I know a lot of people that are buying them because they haven't bought a DS since
3025780	3029860	either the original 3DS or even further back than that.
3029860	3033980	So that I get, I get, I totally get that, because, like, if you're new to the XL thing
3033980	3039300	as well, then okay, yeah, there's a lot of new stuff, but I'm just like, otherwise, I
3039300	3040940	don't know why.
3040940	3045420	Maybe it's the Majora's Mask or the Monster Hunter thing, like, you know, to be fair,
3045420	3050500	to be fair, I had a 3DS, and when they put out that Zelda one, the Triforce one, I had
3050500	3051500	to have it.
3051500	3054780	So I sold my old one and bought the 3DS with the Zelda sound.
3054780	3058260	I don't know, if you want Majora's Mask on the outside, just buy a sticker or some shit
3058260	3059260	for it.
3059260	3060260	I don't understand why it's there.
3060260	3061900	But it's not official that way!
3061900	3064980	Who gives a fuck if it's official or not?
3064980	3066940	I can't show off to all my gamer friends!
3066940	3070660	Yeah, ooh, look at, I got this 3DS that everyone else has.
3070660	3074000	Yeah, I just, I don't get it, but whatever.
3074000	3077940	And then also, the other thing is, there, I think we talked about how there's gonna
3077940	3083060	be some exclusive amiibos, you know, they're gonna be doing like a silver and gold Mario
3083060	3084060	and stuff like that.
3084060	3090740	Well, apparently the gold Mario is gonna be exclusive for Walmart, and it's gonna be offered
3090740	3097940	around Easter time, which is also when Mario Party 10 apparently is coming out, but I just
3097940	3099020	don't get it.
3099020	3103960	If you paint it gold, then all of a sudden people are gonna go batshit crazy for it because
3103960	3106180	it's slightly different than something else.
3107060	3113260	Okay, cool, I guess, you know, that's important to you.
3113260	3117660	It's just the little, and the other thing is that I think that, isn't it like for these
3117660	3119620	supposedly limited edition things?
3119620	3125020	Yeah, well, they've done that, they did like crystal figures and stuff like that in Disney
3125020	3129660	Infinity, and I know they have variants in Skylanders as well.
3129660	3134980	The only thing I have to ask is, are they gonna show up as gold and silver in the game,
3134980	3140980	because that's how they are in, you know, Disney Infinity and Skylanders, is they actually
3140980	3145580	show up in their variants in those games, so it kind of, you know, behooves you a little
3145580	3149780	bit to buy these limited editions, because at least it shows up differently.
3149780	3154740	If it's just seriously just a paint job, and it's just gonna show up as a regular Mario
3154740	3157820	when you hook it up to the game, then it's kind of stupid.
3157820	3161940	Well, see, that was what I was wondering about, is like, if there are like any legit perks
3161940	3166020	to having them, other than them just being, ooh, sparkles.
3166020	3167020	I don't know.
3167020	3170260	I mean, cool, I guess.
3170260	3175680	Mario Party 10 comes out on March 20th, apparently, on the Wii U, so I guess we'll find out when
3175680	3176740	that comes out.
3176740	3179060	But no word on the silver one yet, right?
3179060	3180820	No word on the silver one yet.
3180820	3185420	Yeah, Act After Chat is noting that there's also a silver Mario coming out, but we don't
3185420	3186420	know.
3186420	3190020	Yeah, it's probably, if I would guess, usually the big players and that kind of stuff, it's
3190020	3196060	either gonna be Toys R Us or GameStop, probably.
3196060	3199620	Some folks in chat talking about the 3DS, and kind of responding to what I was saying
3199620	3205020	a little bit ago about the, you know, why did you get a new 3DS, continues in chat,
3205020	3207940	says, Xenoblade Chronicle, more people will get to play it.
3207940	3211620	True, but it isn't out yet, you know, and it will be out, but.
3211620	3215700	And just think about it, too, you're like, oh, I bought a new 3DS for Xenoblade Chronicles,
3215700	3221380	but what if they put out a special Xenoblade Chronicles new 3DS when that comes out?
3221380	3223140	See, that's what I'm afraid of.
3223140	3228060	And you know that there's still at least one or two more Nintendo Directs before that comes
3228060	3229060	out, so.
3229060	3230060	Good thinking, good thinking.
3230060	3233100	I'm, you know, I wouldn't doubt that they're gonna do something like that.
3233100	3236380	Let's see, Act F saying, a lot of people were worried that those gold and silver Mario were
3236380	3240380	Club Nintendo Elite rewards, despite Nintendo stating that all Elite rewards were gonna
3240380	3243740	be digital games, but, you know, people were still worried.
3243780	3248220	AkumaJP saying, sorry to say, impulse buy, I got the Zelda new 3DS.
3248220	3250020	Hey, you know what?
3250020	3252340	I am not one to tell you how to spend your money.
3252340	3255740	You earn your hard-earned money, you spend it on whatever the hell you want, but I can
3255740	3261620	just sit here and say, for me, I don't really understand why, but at the same time, I have
3261620	3268420	Mass Effect 3 on PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U.
3268420	3273020	And people go, you are stupid, and I go, here's my middle finger.
3273020	3275260	So, it's what I like.
3275260	3276900	What's more surprising is that I don't have all this.
3276900	3279900	And how often do you play Mass Effect 3 on-
3279900	3280900	Yeah, Rob.
3280900	3285060	Any more, it's very rare, but I still think the multiplayer is still really good, but
3285060	3287300	to be fair, multiplayer is really PC, if anything.
3287300	3288940	So, have you finished it on Wii U?
3288940	3291900	I didn't play it start to finish on Wii U, but I had to see how the comic was.
3291900	3295180	Remember, it was only like 18 bucks, and I bought it on Wii U.
3295180	3299500	That was more of a collector's thing at that point, you know?
3299500	3303540	Are you grilling everybody that's spending $12 on little amiibo figures?
3303540	3305020	Do you give them the third degree, Loki?
3305020	3306020	I would.
3306020	3307020	I just silently judge them.
3307020	3308180	Why are you buying that?
3308180	3309540	I don't understand why you'd buy that.
3309540	3310540	It does nothing.
3310540	3311540	Because they're cute.
3311540	3312540	They're cute.
3312540	3313540	They're not cute.
3313540	3314540	They're statues, and they don't even move.
3314540	3318020	Let's see, the SEG in chat asks- Hi, SEG.
3318020	3319020	Question.
3319020	3324180	Is there any feature advantage to getting a Wii U when I have a 3DS XL, beyond using
3324180	3326460	the 3DS as a controller in Smash Brothers?
3326460	3331380	So, I'm assuming, is there any more, like, synergy things between the two systems?
3331380	3334940	Because obviously, my obvious answer would be, well, you can't play Mario 8 on the new
3334940	3335940	3DS.
3335940	3336940	Amiibo support.
3336940	3337940	Yeah, amiibo support.
3337940	3340500	I would imagine that there's probably stuff that they haven't talked about yet that they're
3340500	3345580	gonna do with it, unless they come out with yet another new, new 3DS.
3345580	3350180	I would think that, remember, there was the rumor a couple months ago, that makes an awful
3350180	3355580	lot of sense, that the streaming technology that's built into that new 3DS matches what's
3355580	3360540	in the Wii U, so someday, they'll probably be able to be Wii U game pads, and I wouldn't
3360540	3361980	doubt at all that that would end up being true.
3361980	3364980	Yeah, the problem is, though, is that the Wii, I understand that they could be Wii U-
3364980	3365980	But that's not announced yet.
3365980	3366980	I understand.
3366980	3367980	Just to be clear.
3367980	3372620	They could be Wii U, you know, game pads, but the problem is that the Wii U can't, I
3372620	3376900	don't think, can handle more than one stream, which is why you don't have games that support
3376900	3380980	multiple game pads.
3380980	3382540	But not yet, but maybe soon.
3382540	3383540	Who knows?
3383540	3384540	All right.
3384540	3388180	5th Dream in chat says, hey, this isn't a Judge Rob podcast, okay?
3388180	3389700	Thank you, 5th Dream.
3389700	3390700	Thank you.
3390700	3391700	Nice to know I have at least one supporter.
3391700	3392700	What?
3392700	3393700	What?
3393700	3394700	I'm judging you.
3394700	3395700	Yeah, yeah.
3395700	3398260	For other reasons, other reasons, not your gaming choices.
3398260	3403340	All right, speaking of gaming choices and Amiibo and so forth, Nintendo's Amiibo is
3403340	3407760	said to soon be unlocking NES and SNES- Games?
3407760	3408760	Game demos.
3408760	3409760	Oh, demos.
3409760	3410760	Just demos.
3411560	3415560	The Wii U app that's apparently going to be available sometime in the first half of this
3415560	3419560	year, which I imagine will be one of those surprise Nintendo Directs, will allow players
3419560	3424920	to enjoy what they call highlighted scenes from certain games when you tap certain Amiibo
3424920	3426920	to the game pad.
3426920	3430880	These demo scenes will be constrained by a time limit, but other scenes will be available
3430880	3432880	if you tap the Amiibo again.
3432880	3437360	This was all in a presentation that Satoru Iwata gave in a presentation to Japanese investors,
3437360	3441880	saying, quote, we hope that when you tap your Amiibo, the quickly changing game scenes will
3441880	3446980	pleasantly surprise you and make you feel as though you have just changed a game cartridge.
3446980	3447980	This sounds-
3447980	3448980	Stupid.
3448980	3449980	Yes.
3449980	3450980	Incredibly.
3450980	3451980	No.
3451980	3452980	You're a hater.
3452980	3453980	I'm not a hater.
3453980	3456600	It sounds a little bit like the NES remix.
3456600	3457600	A little bit.
3457600	3461680	Like maybe an Amiibo would unlock a few stages in this NES remix style thing.
3461680	3462680	I'm not a hater.
3462680	3463680	That's what it sounds like.
3463680	3464680	Here's my problem.
3464680	3465680	Really?
3465680	3471680	I sold goddamn Super Mario Brothers for the NES, okay, in digital form, and you're still
3471680	3475040	fucking charging like $5 for that shit.
3475040	3476040	Don't get me wrong.
3476040	3480480	I think that game is deserving of $5, but you can't possibly, you know, give it away
3480480	3481920	for free a little bit.
3481920	3488680	I mean, you have all this digital stuff that is basically out there that they could be,
3488680	3490440	you know, incentivizing people to buy.
3490440	3493640	I guess they don't really need any incentive to buy Amiibos because people are just buying
3493640	3499160	them for no apparent reason, but I just think unlocking demos is stupid.
3499160	3503640	I mean, it's just, I don't know, it seems kind of pointless.
3503640	3506720	It does seem a little cheap.
3506720	3511400	Maybe if Animal Crossing never happened, and I didn't see that, oh, hey, cool, they had
3511400	3517920	a game where I could, you know, unlock full NES games and play them, you know, if maybe
3517920	3521920	if that didn't happen, it would feel so ripped off about it, but you know, the fact that
3521920	3526200	they did that at one time kind of pisses me off that they're doing this now.
3526200	3530200	Food for thought, Nintendo, if anybody happens to be out there listening and you're like,
3530200	3532520	this guy, Loki, is a hater.
3532520	3533520	Here's some food for thought.
3533520	3536600	Honestly, what I think could maybe sway some people is that if you're going to do these
3536600	3540520	demos or whatever, fine, but I cited NES Remix, right?
3540520	3546020	And part of what made NES Remix really cool were those stages that brought something different
3546020	3547720	to the classic games.
3547720	3553640	For example, when you could play as Peach from Mario 2 in stages from Mario 3.
3553640	3559760	If I could use my Peach amiibo to, like, unlock new experiences like that that are still classically
3559760	3562140	inspired or whatever, that would be cool.
3562140	3565680	Think like Sonic and Knuckles with NES games.
3565680	3566960	Why not?
3566960	3569000	Because I would take effort and they won't do it.
3569000	3570860	And I tell you, that is exactly why.
3570860	3575120	I hope you're wrong, sadly, I don't think you are.
3575120	3578080	It's as minimal effort as possible.
3578080	3580320	They're going to go to great lengths to build this app anyway.
3580320	3581320	Why not?
3581320	3586420	No, that's the thing, they're just doing that because I think it's to kind of combat the
3586420	3589180	argument that these amiibos don't really do anything.
3589180	3590180	And that's really what it is.
3590180	3596880	It's like, well, see, now we can say that they unlock shit in Hyrule Warriors and it
3596880	3603000	unlocks, you can play them in Mario Party 10 and you can use them in Smash and now they
3603000	3607840	unlock a demo instead of it just being for a handful of things.
3607840	3611480	I think that's what it is because right now, things are really crazy with amiibos and people
3611480	3613440	are just wanting to snap them up.
3613440	3616480	But given a year, I think it's going to be less crazy.
3616480	3623400	I think that if we see that they're not implementing the stuff in a reasonable way, like, and it's
3623400	3626440	like, okay, well, these are the only, there's only a handful of games that these are actually
3626440	3631040	going to work with, then I think people are going to stop, you know, snatch them up.
3631080	3634600	Granted, there are still going to be people that buy everything because there are people
3634600	3637440	like that in Skylanders and Disney Infinity, so I wouldn't doubt it.
3637440	3641040	Well, let me throw this out there too, because just a really quick follow up here, because
3641040	3646160	this is going to have an impact on this as well, and that is the fact that amiibo cards
3646160	3647880	are being talked about again.
3647880	3652080	And again, from this same, you know, financial briefing, Satoru Iwata was talking about how
3652080	3656640	well the amiibos are doing and so forth, or I'm sorry, the amiibo, I guess the plural
3656640	3658040	of amiibo is still amiibo.
3658040	3664280	I keep wanting to say amiibai, but it's, the plural of amiibo is amiibo, but I have
3664280	3666480	to fight that urge to say amiibos.
3666480	3672040	But anyway, so Satoru Iwata says, in contrast to the current figure-shaped amiibo available,
3672040	3678120	we will make amiibo in the form of cards this year as one of our future plans, as Mr. Miyamoto
3678120	3681240	mentioned in the corporate management policy briefing in October.
3681240	3684640	So that is still something that's highly likely on the table as we get closer to the end of
3684640	3685640	the year.
3685640	3689880	And that probably answers how we're gonna be able to get Wii Fit Trainer now that all
3689880	3691760	those figures are long gone.
3691760	3695040	You know, we'll have the cards, you'll have a Wii Fit Trainer card.
3695040	3699920	I just, for me, again, it really depends on how those guys are priced.
3699920	3700920	Exactly.
3700920	3703320	Oh hey, there's that card, it's $10.
3703320	3706560	I don't think, here's what I think will happen.
3706560	3711120	I don't think a singular card will be $10, but I think they're gonna sell them in packs
3711120	3712120	of three.
3712120	3713120	Blind packs.
3713640	3717040	Oh, fuck you for saying that, blind packs.
3717040	3718680	Oh, please no, no.
3718680	3719680	Don't give them any ideas.
3719680	3723960	If Nintendo's listening, I want you to immediately delete the last 20 seconds of this show so
3723960	3725960	you never heard Loki say that.
3725960	3729160	I wasn't thinking that, I was thinking like a pack of three.
3729160	3735520	Like here is series one amiibo cards, and you get three of them for $12, but it's what,
3735520	3741000	Wii Fit Trainer, who else was in that first series, Marth, and who else can't you get
3741000	3742000	anymore?
3742000	3745200	I know some amiibo fan in the chat is yelling it out, but whoever was in that series that's
3745200	3748480	really hard to get now, oh, Villager was in that series, right?
3748480	3751120	So those would be like the first set of cards.
3751120	3753400	I would think maybe it could be a thing.
3753400	3759440	So Black Wolf in chat says, edit it out, I just might, we'll just have the passphrase
3759440	3760440	there instead.
3760440	3762840	It'll be like, why did it jump from one thought to another?
3762840	3768200	It usually doesn't do that in the past, but no, I had to cut out what Loki said.
3768240	3774680	Of all the things I could have censored Loki on on this show over the past 13 years, it's
3774680	3775680	gonna be that.
3775680	3776680	It's gonna happen.
3776680	3777680	It's gonna be that.
3777680	3778680	And you know why it's gonna happen?
3778680	3783400	Because, you know, they've already done this kind of bullshit with the other type of, Disney
3783400	3786680	Infinity does this with their fucking power-ups, it's blind packs.
3786680	3790120	So I wouldn't doubt, I wouldn't doubt that they would do that.
3790120	3792020	How dare you?
3792020	3794640	Because they need to make money, and that's what it is.
3794640	3797880	They're gonna make money because they're like, well, you could trade them with your friends!
3797880	3798880	It's social!
3798880	3802360	Trade them when they come over and play Mario Kart with you and sit on your couch!
3802360	3805480	Nobody interacts in person anymore.
3805480	3813520	But to be fair, Jamie, the Wii U is still the undisputed champion of living room play.
3813520	3816440	You know, like I had a friend over earlier today, we were having a great time playing
3816440	3817440	Mario Kart.
3817440	3820600	I didn't think of better stuff to do in the living room, no I'm kidding.
3820600	3821600	Anyway.
3821600	3822600	Speaking of Jamie, let's-
3822600	3826140	It's never as much fun as watching you play ABBA.
3826140	3827140	Everything we'll ever talk-
3827140	3828140	The ABBA game.
3828140	3829140	You're watching ABBA You Can Dance.
3829140	3830140	Yeah, that was great.
3830140	3831140	Can I get an ABBA amiibo?
3831140	3835060	Would it be, um, an ABBA meebo?
3835060	3836060	ABBA meebo.
3836060	3837060	ABBA meebo.
3837060	3838060	A man can dream.
3838060	3839740	I have a dream!
3839740	3853260	This is the person that gave you Super
3853260	3857300	It's like you put the card in another card, like in his sleeve, and I could have, like,
3857300	3859300	my little ABBA meebo.
3859300	3861240	ABBA meebo.
3861240	3862980	This is a thing now, the ABBA meebo.
3862980	3863980	Okay.
3863980	3864980	So-
3864980	3870180	And then when I beat you in Smash Brothers, I can say, the winner takes it all!
3870180	3873420	The loser's standing small.
3873420	3875140	Loki looks like he's in pain over there.
3875140	3879300	It's like, for some reason that singing gave me a headache, I still know.
3879300	3880300	And now I have a migraine.
3880300	3882940	You know you have to get more frames now because you have two ABBA albums now.
3882940	3884820	Maybe change the topic quick.
3884820	3885820	Twitch!
3885820	3887140	Wait, this is making me twitch.
3887140	3893060	Yes, that song made me.
3893060	3896540	So anyway, uh, Twitch has put out an announcement.
3896540	3897820	They're gonna do TwitchCon.
3897820	3900460	It's a fan festival type thing.
3900460	3906280	Um, so yeah, Twitch is gonna be doing the first ever fan and content creator gathering
3906280	3912820	called TwitchCon, and, uh, the announcement came out on the 20th, but it's gonna be September
3912820	3918580	25th through 26th in San Francisco at the place that I can never pronounce right, the
3918580	3928860	Moscone Center, um, where we, uh, it was right next door to where GamerX was last year.
3928860	3934500	Um, so basically it's gonna be put together by Twitch and by, uh, ReadPop.
3934500	3939140	So it's gonna get basically broadcasters, fans together, you know, just have everyone
3939140	3942100	come together and see what happens and play games.
3942100	3944140	Will the swap be attending as well?
3944140	3945260	What?
3945260	3950420	I'm just wondering.
3950420	3956360	So how do you feel about another convention?
3956360	3957980	It's oddly quiet, isn't it?
3957980	3958980	Tweet, tweet, tweet.
3958980	3961820	Um, you know, it's a good idea.
3961820	3965960	If it's probably gonna be, you know, prohibitive though with all the other shit I've got going
3965960	3967740	on this year.
3967740	3971420	That's what a lot of people are saying is that it's like, oh yay, another convention
3971420	3975500	on the calendar, you know, it's, it's like, we've got a lot of conventions throughout
3975500	3976500	the year.
3976500	3979060	It's also a little bit strange because, you know, I understand the, that YouTube does
3979060	3980060	something similar.
3980060	3983460	They have like kind of this, they have a ball pit, they don't have a ball pit, but they
3983460	3986460	have like a kind of like a content creator gathering type thing.
3986460	3992800	But Twitch to me doesn't seem like it's much of the same type of content you would see
3992800	3998260	on YouTube where it's more of like, you know, obviously it's live stuff and not so much
3998260	4003180	like, you know, shows or anything like, you're not going to have like, you know, TV show
4003180	4005060	or, you know, web series or something like that.
4005060	4011420	It's more of, you know, live playing or like let's plays or tournaments or something like
4011420	4012420	that.
4012420	4016700	So I don't know what they would be doing necessarily here, what you're going to go see there.
4016700	4021140	Are you going to see tournaments, see people live streaming their games because that seems
4021140	4022140	kind of boring.
4022140	4028620	Well, I know one of Twitch's niches is the live, like sports style events like, you know,
4028620	4031660	the League of Legends tournaments and the Starcraft tournaments and so forth.
4031660	4035980	I would think that they could probably get a lot of the big players and the E-leagues
4035980	4038460	and so forth kind of together under one roof.
4038460	4042020	I mean, it's not like there are already a lot of those events as well, but to have something
4042020	4045900	that's kind of like sanctioned by Twitch that might, you know, be playing obviously and
4045900	4049060	highlighted on Twitch, I think could draw a lot of that content.
4049060	4053180	And I kind of have a feeling that's what TwitchCon's big strength would be is that they'll probably
4053180	4056380	get a lot of that, you know, major league gaming, esports.
4056380	4061140	They're going to have a lot of that going on at the con, I would think.
4061140	4067100	Along with panels on, you know, how to be a better broadcaster and, you know, how to
4067100	4071140	become a partner and how to make money, you know, all those other types of things.
4071140	4073900	So, but again, there's just so many cons.
4073900	4078140	You guys, like RuPaul just announced DragCon in May.
4078140	4079820	How can I not want to go to that?
4079820	4081820	Like I don't even dress up.
4081820	4083820	I just, I just think they're bitchy fun.
4083820	4084820	I love it.
4084820	4087180	So I kind of want to go just to get sassed.
4087180	4088180	But you know what?
4088180	4092460	We kind of had that at GamerX anyway, especially since I just kept running into Queens at Sephora.
4092460	4097580	Like the one I had to fight off for the, the green emerald Pantone eyelashes.
4097580	4102340	Well, at least GX is a different time of year this year where there isn't a lot of cons.
4102340	4103340	So I'm happy about that.
4103340	4104340	It's like the first week of December, right?
4104340	4105860	Yeah, it's right in December this time.
4105860	4106860	Hallelujah.
4106860	4107860	Yeah.
4108580	4109580	Which is a true story.
4109580	4112940	I did fight off a drag queen at a Sephora for Pantone emerald green eyelashes.
4112940	4118700	YYR in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says if they host a whole bunch of tournaments,
4118700	4119980	that could be a big draw.
4119980	4122740	Admission will cost $80 and a pound of salt.
4122740	4125660	Well, I could see them doing like, you know, that'd be kind of cool.
4125660	4130740	Like more of like an X Games type thing, but you know, just like big old tournament thing.
4130740	4131740	That'd be kind of cool.
4131740	4133100	I can see that.
4133100	4135500	At least it's just over the bridge in San Francisco.
4135500	4137820	So I mean, it's kind of local for us.
4137820	4142820	So Moscone Center is literally next door to where gamer X two was last year.
4142820	4147900	And it's also across the street from the Metreon, which a lot of, you know, if you remember
4147900	4150900	the PlayStation store in San Francisco, there's only sadness there now.
4150900	4151900	Well, yeah.
4151900	4153660	Now it's just a movie theater really and nothing else.
4153660	4154660	Some eateries.
4154660	4159700	But, uh, you know, back in the day that was like a big hub for Sony and DDR players definitely
4159700	4163020	remember the arcade that used to be there, uh, was huge for some tournaments.
4163020	4166780	So, you know, that little block right there in San Francisco is pretty awesome.
4166780	4169500	Does it still have the walk of game down there?
4169500	4174700	I think it does still exist, but like there's literally nothing else up there.
4174700	4179700	So unless they, Oh, actually they might've turned that into the target now.
4179700	4180700	That might be the target.
4180700	4182020	It might be the walk of target.
4182020	4185660	It might be like socks and underwear now.
4185660	4186660	I don't know.
4186660	4187660	That's disappointing.
4187660	4188660	We'll see.
4188660	4196540	To register participation for this week's episode of Warren Jones Radio at vognetwork.com,
4196540	4197900	use the passphrase PINK.
4197900	4198900	All right.
4198900	4201180	Uh, moving on, uh, with some more news.
4201180	4202180	Loki.
4202180	4203180	All right.
4203180	4207380	So don't call it a comeback, but, uh, there's going to be some more rock band DLC coming
4207380	4208380	out.
4208380	4209380	That's right.
4209380	4211380	They're, they're coming back.
4211380	4216660	They're saying on February, uh, well, on February 17th, they released, was it Back to the Shack
4216660	4223340	from Weezer, Rise of the Phoenix from Tenacious D. Um, each of those will be sold for $1.99.
4223340	4226060	And apparently they're still working on some more stuff.
4226060	4231940	Um, they're even saying that, um, you know, they may have some more stuff to reveal soon.
4231940	4233180	What does this all mean though?
4233180	4234180	What does this all mean?
4234180	4238540	Gee, what could those song titles, could those song titles be implying anything Rise of the
4238540	4246620	Phoenix really like, can we please get Elton John's The Bitches Back in like a month?
4246620	4252340	Basically, you know, according to an unnamed source, cause you know, that's always good,
4252340	4256180	is that they're working on another rock band game that's going to be coming out for PlayStation
4256180	4259020	4 and Xbox One.
4259020	4263860	Um, could this be announced at PAX East?
4263860	4267340	I'll feel a lot better about having to spend the money to go out there if that's the case.
4267340	4268340	It's quite possible.
4268340	4270940	I think one of the, the, where is, where is harmonics?
4270940	4271940	Boston.
4271940	4277180	Well, one of the, um, the hints also was they showed all the different pins that you can
4277180	4281780	collect, but the harmonics one had a big question mark on it, cause they're not showing what
4281780	4282780	it is yet.
4282780	4283780	Oh, okay.
4283780	4289900	Uh, it would make sense that they would reveal that there, um, I think that's cool.
4289900	4294900	I hope they put it out, but I also hope that my instruments work with it because I have
4294900	4296540	them all on Xbox 360.
4296540	4298560	A converter would be nice.
4298560	4299560	That would be nice.
4299600	4305280	I mean, I have got like, um, I've got my converter thing for my controllers to use Xbox 360 controllers
4305280	4310840	on it, but I've, yeah, I hope that there's some sort of way to use that cause I don't
4310840	4311840	want to have to buy.
4311840	4315960	I'm, well, I, I'm telling you this much, I'm not going to buy new instruments for when
4315960	4316960	it comes out.
4316960	4320280	Can we get a new DJ Harrow please too?
4320280	4321280	That I would buy.
4321280	4322280	Talk to the other company about that.
4322280	4323280	I know.
4323280	4324280	I know.
4324280	4328640	I would pay money though for that and kind of have to make my own if I don't, you know,
4328640	4329640	get one soon.
4329640	4330640	All right.
4330640	4334120	Uh, well I, I, I hope that, uh, it does happen.
4334120	4336840	I'd love to see it at PAX East except I know I'll never get to play it cause it's going
4336840	4340480	to be the world's worst line, uh, to get in and play that game.
4340480	4342000	But at least hopefully I'll get to see it.
4342000	4343000	Nothing else.
4343000	4346840	I mean, Rock Band's got a formula, they don't really have to break it.
4346840	4349160	I'd be curious to see what they do with it.
4349160	4353100	What, what the new systems can bring to that.
4353100	4354760	Excellent point from Black Wolf in the chat room.
4354760	4355760	So excellent.
4355760	4357880	I want stage kit compatibility.
4358120	4359120	Yes, please.
4359120	4362560	Hey, I, I wonder if you can still get those.
4362560	4363560	That'd be pretty awesome.
4363560	4365360	Maybe you can get them discount or something.
4365360	4371600	Um, knowing that there's a big social element in gaming now that wasn't there a few years
4371600	4376200	ago and I'm talking about Twitch basically and um, you know, the fact that people stream
4376200	4377480	live and so forth.
4377480	4383200	I wonder if there's going to be some type of connected living room experience through
4383480	4389120	like streaming a video or something where you can now be in a band with somebody that
4389120	4393120	lives, you know, in another house basically.
4393120	4397920	Like I noticed that a grandpa from Hoard House just joined our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
4397920	4403680	So I could play keyboards in my house and grandpa could sing over in his house.
4403680	4407960	You know, he could sing a, you know, a journey song, whatever, any way you want it.
4407960	4409480	That's the way you need it.
4409480	4410960	Like he, you know, right.
4410960	4412760	And then we could actually see each other while we're playing.
4412840	4417080	That would be kind of cool because I seem to recall in the three 61 you wouldn't get
4417080	4421000	to hear the other person because of the delay, which makes sense.
4421000	4424660	And to be fair, that delay is still going to be there, but maybe they'll do something
4424660	4428960	where like after you do the song, you can watch a performance that like puts all you
4428960	4430960	guys together or something like there's something they could do.
4430960	4436400	I'm sure it would be actually sort of interesting is if they had something that worked with
4436400	4442200	like, you know, your cameras or whatever that you, uh, it compiles into like one of those
4442200	4444160	YouTube esque, you know, multi-panel videos.
4444160	4445160	Yeah.
4445160	4446160	Yeah.
4446160	4447160	That would be actually be kind of funny.
4447160	4448160	That would be kind of cool.
4448160	4449160	I bet.
4449160	4450160	I wouldn't watch myself.
4450160	4451160	I bet.
4451160	4453040	That's what maybe the ultimate thing would be is that you could create like a music video
4453040	4456560	from all four different places or something like it would film all people and like put
4456560	4457560	it all together.
4457560	4458560	That would be pretty cool.
4458560	4459560	That would be pretty cool.
4459560	4464640	Not even necessarily for if you've got like a harmonizing with the two mics, which they
4464640	4465640	have like a Beatles rock band.
4465640	4469440	I'm going to make it a point this week to play DJ hero.
4469440	4470440	That's like, that's a good goal.
4470440	4471440	That's a good goal.
4471680	4472680	All right.
4472680	4478480	Um, so, uh, earlier this week on, um, you know, we, we have an interesting relationship
4478480	4481880	with this particular site, but it's being reported around the internet and it's a story
4481880	4487320	that Kotaku ran, uh, where they interviewed the legend of Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma,
4487320	4492080	uh, who was talking a lot about, you know, the Zelda and what to expect in the new Zelda
4492080	4493360	and so forth.
4493360	4501400	But, um, uh, he was also talking about Tingle and, uh, some of the, um, lore and things
4501400	4504040	behind Tingle, one of Loki's very favorite characters.
4504040	4505040	Oh yeah.
4505040	4508560	So what he said about Tingle, I guess the heart of the character, there's a little bit
4508560	4510240	of a gag kind of feeling to it.
4510240	4514360	The way the design of the character started is that we needed to think about how the character
4514360	4517040	at the player would get access to maps in this game.
4517040	4520400	Of course you could go with a situation where as soon as he sees an area, you just open
4520400	4523480	up your map and it fills in for you, but we wanted to do something a little different.
4523480	4525260	So we thought, what if you had to buy maps?
4525260	4527720	Then suddenly we needed a character that you would buy maps from.
4527720	4530360	We ultimately ended up with a character here that had a little bit of humor to him that
4530360	4534320	came from thinking of what sort of person would sell a map and well, we decided it would
4534320	4537320	be the kind of person who makes the map.
4537320	4540360	And the way he makes the map is by floating through the air so that he can see the contours
4540360	4541500	of the land and draw them.
4541500	4544520	But as soon as we get that far in the process, we realized anybody that would fly through
4544520	4547300	the air making a map, it's got to be a really weird person.
4547300	4552340	So at that point we decided, okay, we'll go with this and make him a really weird guy.
4552340	4555300	So when we made this character, we had this notion that one of the ways he might be a
4555300	4558900	little bit weird is that he had this notion that he never wanted to grow up.
4558900	4562540	And so I think to that extent, the clothes do fit this image of him and the whole thing
4562540	4565180	comes together as a very Peter Pan kind of visual.
4565180	4568500	You know, if you think about it, it's this guy in his thirties in a green suit and is
4568500	4570680	flying and never wants to grow up.
4570680	4573220	It all sort of comes together around that.
4573220	4579840	And then the ever classy Kotaku asked, so is Tingle gay basically?
4579840	4582860	And Anuma replied to that and said, he's not gay.
4582860	4585020	He's just an odd person.
4585020	4589480	And I don't, I kind of feel like that question was unnecessary.
4589480	4591280	It really was like, why, why does it matter?
4591280	4594000	But I also, that's kind of where I'm at.
4594000	4595000	Like who cares?
4595000	4596000	It's a video game character.
4596000	4601380	They don't think of, okay, what kind of sexuality is this video game character going to have?
4601380	4608640	But I also understand that in some ways Tingle has become a bit of a gay icon and sometimes
4608640	4609640	that happens.
4609640	4614400	Like I seem to recall gaygamer.net did like a little feature that was bestowing some type
4614400	4616480	of like character of the year award.
4616480	4617480	I don't know.
4617480	4620180	I don't, I sorry, I don't remember the exact title they bestowed on him, but it was some
4620180	4621680	type of like honor.
4621680	4628600	So I don't know, like, but so part of me says, okay, well I guess, I guess the fans have
4628600	4634160	kind of painted this image or whatever of, of Tingle and, and, you know, it held him
4634160	4637440	up in this regard or whatever, but I still kind of feel like, well then why do you want
4637440	4642780	to poke a hole in that question by saying, you know, so tell me yes or no, is he gay?
4642780	4647300	And I kind of wish Enuma had just said, I don't really have an answer for that.
4647300	4653000	Or just said, we haven't really explored that part of the character or it's a video game
4653000	4656620	and we don't plan on putting Tingle in a relationship anytime soon.
4656660	4658660	So go with that what you will.
4658660	4660980	How about what the fuck does it matter?
4660980	4662040	Or something like that.
4662040	4663860	So it really doesn't matter.
4663860	4668780	But I'm not going to blame Enuma for that because I also realized the culture in Japan
4668780	4670860	is very different from the culture here.
4670860	4673780	And he probably didn't know what the fuck to say, honestly.
4673780	4674780	Well that's a stupid question.
4674780	4675780	I don't blame him.
4675780	4676780	It's, it's.
4676780	4677780	Yeah.
4677780	4678780	It's dumb.
4678780	4679780	It's just a video game.
4679780	4680780	It was just.
4680780	4684580	It's not a video game that requires him to have sexual relations with other characters.
4684580	4688780	Why do people have to keep fucking stuff up with doing it?
4688780	4694220	But I could see, I want to be fair and I can see the flip side to it of, again, he was
4694220	4696380	a gay icon or whatever.
4696380	4702460	But I kind of also look at that and go, well, ABBA was a gay icon in many ways because of,
4702460	4707220	you know, they made these, these outfits out of nothing that were, you know, hilarious
4707220	4709440	and their songs were fun and so forth.
4709440	4715620	But ABBA was, there's, there's like the actual term of homosexuality.
4715620	4717940	There's nothing homosexual about ABBA.
4717940	4724120	In fact, they were quite the incestuous little group where they were married in straight
4724120	4725160	relationships.
4725160	4729400	One guy was married to one girl and then they divorced and married the other girl.
4729400	4732100	Each guy married, like, so ABBA was kind of crazy like that.
4732100	4737680	But my point is, is that gay icons don't always necessarily mean gay people.
4738560	4740560	Does that make sense?
4740560	4743760	Well, well, what was the deal with Donna Summer for the longest time?
4743760	4746040	She actually was relatively homophobic.
4746040	4751720	Yes, I think she did come around in the end, but it was a little bit of that whole mixed
4751720	4756280	message where, you know, the church was telling her one thing, you know, and that whole, that
4756280	4757800	whole situation was going on.
4757800	4760840	So, uh, and Dungeon Buster in chat says, I agree with Sky.
4760840	4763440	I think Anuma was just caught completely off guard.
4763440	4765240	No one expects the Kotaku Inquisition.
4765240	4771000	I just, I just kind of like, why did that have to be a question?
4771000	4775520	It would make for a headline for them if they're like, confirm Tingle is gay.
4775520	4776520	You know what I mean?
4776520	4778080	That's why they asked that stupid thing.
4778080	4779080	Anyway.
4779080	4780080	All right.
4780080	4781080	So there it is.
4781080	4782880	That's, uh, that's some news that's been going around this week.
4782880	4783880	Let's move on.
4783880	4788200	Um, uh, and so it looks like Steve has an early class tomorrow.
4788200	4789200	Oh, makes sense.
4789200	4790200	Yeah.
4790200	4791520	So one more plug for Flom.
4791520	4792520	Check out Flom.
4792520	4793520	Yes.
4793520	4794520	Go please everybody.
4794520	4799320	I will give two people $3 to go buy the game.
4799320	4800720	I will gift it to a couple of you.
4800720	4803240	How can they sign up for free money, DarkSakura?
4803240	4804240	I will.
4804240	4806880	How will you know that they bought the game and not a taco?
4806880	4808920	Send me your Apple ID and I will gift you the game.
4808920	4809920	Only two people though.
4809920	4810920	Only two people.
4810920	4811920	All right.
4811920	4814080	Anyway, uh, let's move on.
4814080	4816080	Uh, DarkSakura, you have a story for us.
4816080	4817660	This game is pretty freaking cool.
4817660	4819840	It's called Killer Queen.
4819840	4824560	It is the world's first 10 player arcade strategy game.
4824560	4829880	It wasn't released for iOS or Android or any home handheld thing.
4829880	4830880	It's not a computer game.
4830880	4837040	It is a full fledged fucking arcade game and it's 10 players and you can only find it in
4837040	4839880	five places in the country.
4839880	4843200	So well, I guess technically that would be in the world as well.
4843200	4852720	Um, but it was put out by two people, Nikita Mikros and Joshua Debonis.
4852720	4855080	And it's just really weird.
4855080	4858180	You don't have to play it one different, one way.
4858180	4860960	You can beat it several different ways.
4860960	4863520	You have five players, so it's five against five.
4863520	4868400	You have to have, they say that you need to have at least, you know, four on a team to
4868400	4872680	make it really worthwhile or three on a team.
4872680	4874800	But you can beat Killer Queen different ways.
4874800	4877580	You can collect berries and take them back to your base.
4877580	4880280	You can ride a snail toward your goal.
4880280	4881280	Yuck.
4881280	4882280	Snails are disgusting.
4882280	4891880	Um, you basically, you just have to make, you just have to win by any means necessary.
4891880	4895120	You know, hopefully by confounding the other people.
4895120	4901480	But each team has four grunts and a queen and you can also win by the way, by killing
4901480	4902840	the queen three times.
4902840	4906660	The enemy's queen, but the queen has wings and she gets to sort of spout around like
4906660	4911120	she's in joust and the grunts though have to run around on the ground until they level
4911120	4912920	up and get more capabilities.
4912920	4916940	Um, so they have to keep bringing more berries to your team.
4916940	4924520	So it's sort of like capture the flag, quit it, kill bees, the game.
4924520	4926440	And in our chat room, it's just so bizarre.
4926440	4930760	In our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, SSG100Matt says, played this at MagFest and
4930760	4932560	it's amazing.
4932560	4940560	See, I want, okay, I want more people to play this game and then like send us pictures of
4940560	4941560	them playing it.
4941560	4942760	So you have to find them.
4942760	4951440	If you find the killer queen and take a picture of it, I will buy you a copy of Flom.
4951440	4952440	That's only two people though.
4952440	4953440	Only two people.
4953440	4954440	Max two people.
4954440	4955440	Max two.
4955440	4956440	All right.
4957120	4961240	So, uh, yeah, I, I'm excited to hear though that there's like an actual like arcade experience
4961240	4962240	going on with this.
4962240	4963560	That's, uh, that's always nice to know.
4963560	4968120	Well, the places that you can find it, um, there is one at Logan arcade in Chicago.
4968120	4974120	Um, there's also one in Portland at, uh, ground control.
4974120	4975680	Oh, that place.
4975680	4977960	That's like the retro arcade, if I'm not mistaken.
4977960	4978960	I went there once.
4978960	4984920	There's a league night at that location, I believe that they say there's also in California
4984920	4985920	anywhere.
4986400	4987400	LA San Francisco.
4987400	4991920	I just saw the two in there, but you know, I'll go hunting around and see if there are
4991920	4992920	any other locations.
4992920	4993920	All right.
4993920	4999840	Um, yeah, they are just, it's really pretty too on top of that, just really kind of cute
4999840	5001480	and pixely in an old school way.
5001480	5002480	All right.
5002480	5005720	We're going to travel around the world now and check out some release dates and see what
5005720	5008120	games are coming to a store near you.
5008120	5012080	Uh, you can find killer queen in an arcade, uh, or a few of them anyway, but you can find
5012080	5016040	these games on shelves this week around the world, uh, starting in the U S Loki.
5016040	5017040	Yes.
5017040	5021720	So this week, uh, you can pick up dragon ball, Xenoverse, which is going to be coming out
5021720	5028320	on PlayStation three, Xbox three 60, Xbox one and PlayStation four.
5028320	5038600	Also under night in birth exe late, which is by axis for, um, the PlayStation three.
5038600	5039600	And let's see what else?
5039600	5040600	Nice.
5040600	5046840	He wears eight empires on PlayStation four and Xbox one, uh, rugby 15 for PlayStation
5046840	5054160	three, PlayStation four and Xbox one, uh, hyper devotion, noir goddess, black heart
5054160	5056680	for Vita.
5056680	5058400	And let's see what else here.
5058400	5061920	Uh, that might actually be it.
5061920	5065520	Uh, let's see here.
5065520	5066520	Last call.
5067520	5068520	Dragon balls.
5068520	5069520	Xenoverse is also on PC.
5069520	5070520	Apparently that's it.
5070520	5071520	Here it is.
5071520	5074440	Uh, going over to Japan and checking out the releases there on the PlayStation four this
5074440	5075440	week.
5075440	5082220	Dragon quest heroes on route to, uh, Sakaiju no jewel comes out this week from Squeenix.
5082220	5084720	It's a dragon quest heroes game on the PlayStation four.
5084720	5086520	So I've had a lot of people looking forward to that.
5086520	5088760	Uh, I can't say I blame you for that one.
5088760	5095240	Uh, on the Xbox one, um, really nothing in Japan this week, but, uh, I imagine the Xbox
5095280	5098080	one, unfortunately for them, hasn't been gaining a lot of steam over there, so there's probably
5098080	5103080	not a lot of games there, but dragon quest heroes is also on the PlayStation three this
5103080	5104080	week.
5104080	5105080	So you can check that out.
5105080	5108000	Uh, as I mentioned previously on the show, there's really nothing on the Wii U until
5108000	5109400	March over in Japan.
5109400	5115420	Uh, so checking out the PlayStation Vita PlayStation Vita has captain earth mind labyrinth this
5115420	5122360	week, as well as Diabloic lovers, dark fate and Osmophia vivace comes out this week and
5122360	5126560	the game called parfait comes out, uh, on the Vita as well.
5126560	5127760	This is about butter.
5127760	5129400	Uh, what is parfait about?
5129400	5131240	It's regular and limited edition.
5131240	5134520	It's parfait you were thinking of.
5134520	5135520	Is it about yogurt?
5135520	5138120	No, it's about girl, girls and maid outfits.
5138120	5144600	Um, are they making, it might be, it might be a visual novel of a somewhat adult nature
5144600	5150880	because I'm noticing in this picture, she's not wearing pants, so she is, she's just putting
5150880	5155680	them on, caught her only in America.
5155680	5159680	Do we refer to as trousers as pants in other countries?
5159680	5160680	Pants are your underwear?
5160680	5161680	And she was wearing them.
5161680	5162680	Well, okay.
5162680	5165360	But technically it was a skirt.
5165360	5166360	Wow.
5166360	5169600	And this is just a straight up upskirt shot right here that we've got on this.
5169600	5171400	So, um, wow.
5171400	5175840	I can't believe it's not butter.
5175840	5180640	I don't know what else to say about parfait, uh, but Hey, how about the Nintendo three
5180640	5185160	DS because on the Nintendo three DS this week, there's Dora Moji and Nobita no Kanji
5185160	5191600	Daisak Suen comes out this week and Kinero no Korda three full voice special comes out
5191600	5195520	in a regular edition and a treasure box edition.
5195520	5201960	And this looks like yet another visual novel on the three DS, but this one's like music
5201960	5207200	and this guy's a doctor and he forgot his shirt in the shower in this picture.
5207200	5210120	So you wear your shirt in the shower, Rob?
5210120	5215040	I suppose not, but I do find this a bit of a gratuitous picture here.
5215040	5217160	It's not so much the fact that he's in the shower.
5217160	5221200	It's the look that's on his face of the, ah, well, you would look like that too.
5221200	5222960	We don't see what his other hand is doing.
5222960	5223960	Yeah.
5223960	5230120	Maybe if my other hand wasn't visible.
5230120	5231120	There you go.
5231120	5232120	Those are us.
5232120	5236940	What you have to look forward to in Japan this week, um, sinning dark Sakura.
5236940	5238680	How about the UK?
5238680	5240800	In the UK we have some stuff.
5240800	5247200	On the 24th there is, there came an echo on PC and on the 25th a good snowman is hard
5247200	5256160	to build for Mac PC homeworld remastered collection for PC odd world, new and tasty for Mac PC.
5256160	5260480	And then on everything else, resident evil revelations too.
5260480	5263320	And seriously, it is on just about everything else.
5263320	5271000	On the 27th Dragon Ball Xenoverse, um, also Dying Light on a few things, Dynasty Warriors
5271000	5276280	Eight Empires, uh, Pneuma, Breath of Life, and Trains, a new era.
5276280	5281640	As long as it's not the banned train, I'm happy and that's it.
5281640	5282640	All right.
5282640	5286080	Just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week.
5286080	5287080	Loki.
5287080	5290560	So I think this was mentioned a while back and I want to, I can't remember if they said
5290560	5295720	this in actual, in their press conferences or whatever, but it was that originally the
5295720	5299800	Xbox ones are going to become dev kits at some point.
5299800	5303320	Like they're going to allow people to be able to develop games using that instead of an
5303320	5304320	actual dev kit.
5304320	5307360	That way it'll open the market up a little bit more to any developers.
5307360	5314220	Well, apparently the rumor is now that developers, um, will be able to use the Xbox ones as dev
5314220	5316920	kits later this year in an update.
5316920	5320360	They're saying that, you know, developers will also be able to use beta apps to test
5320360	5325080	them with community apps will finally be able to run in the background, allowing third party
5325080	5330720	music apps to continue outputting music while a game is playing, um, stuff like that.
5330720	5332840	So that's pretty cool.
5332840	5335580	I hope that actually ends up being true.
5335580	5344720	And apparently the announcement may, um, be made in April during their build conference.
5344720	5345720	I don't know.
5345720	5346720	I'm looking forward to it.
5346720	5347720	Thanks again.
5347720	5348720	Xbox one, I guess.
5348720	5351120	Couldn't that be an announcement for game developers conference, which is coming up
5351120	5352120	as well.
5352120	5354120	I mean, I know there's been a lot of talk about PAX East, but let's not forget game
5354120	5355720	developers conference is happening.
5355720	5360660	And although we don't usually get E3 style announcements at GDC, uh, we did get things
5360660	5363440	like the PlayStation move was unveiled at GDC.
5363440	5367600	So sometimes things that will impact, uh, gaming development, I would expect that we
5367600	5371320	might find a little more out about project Morpheus at GDC.
5371320	5374360	Not necessarily like, you know, a day and date type of thing, but maybe like an update
5374360	5379280	on what development is available for something like that, since it seems like VR is a huge
5379280	5380440	direction for the industry.
5380440	5381440	Yeah.
5381440	5385080	The theory is that they're going to be publishing like a software development kit preview, I
5385080	5390140	guess in may, that's going to switch those dev to retails to, um, dev kits.
5390140	5394120	So I will have to see, but I think the build conference that they're talking about is Microsoft
5394120	5399800	actually has one for developing on, you know, um, all their windows platforms.
5399800	5404000	And a lot of these have to do with kind of universal apps that they're going to meld
5404040	5407040	together with, you know, all their windows 10 platforms.
5407040	5411320	Uh, now Bobby who follows a lot of the development community, Bobby Black Wolf says, actual developers
5411320	5413680	are already using retail Xbox ones as dev kits.
5413680	5416160	This is about extending that to the general public.
5416160	5420200	So maybe that's why you're like, I thought this was familiar, uh, also Bobby saying and,
5420200	5423160	and confirming in some ways what I was just saying, there was a four hour presentation
5423160	5425320	about project Morpheus at GDC.
5425320	5426680	Not surprised to hear that at all.
5426680	5431240	And I didn't know that I didn't look, you know, I'm, I don't go to GDC, although funny
5431280	5435920	enough, because of the way my flight to PAX East is, I'm probably going to San Francisco
5435920	5439360	to see people that are going to GDC and like go to dinner one night.
5439360	5442600	And then I'm flying to PAX East the next day while GDC is still going on.
5442600	5446400	So it's just the way things work out in this crazy world.
5446400	5449960	So anyway, uh, let's move on.
5449960	5453320	We're almost to the classic game of the week, but I want to talk about new games for a minute
5453320	5454320	here.
5454320	5456080	And this isn't so much as a story as it is.
5456080	5460760	I just wanted to bring up this topic because it's been a lot of discussion this week, and
5461280	5467080	that is the reception to a pretty high, excuse me, I'm so nervous, I'm burping.
5467080	5472720	It's the release to a pretty high profile PlayStation four game that came out this week.
5472720	5474920	And that is of course the order.
5474920	5477880	And you know, I don't know how much stock you guys put in Metacritic.
5477880	5483600	I think a lot of big outlets are starting to really walk away from scoring and the way
5483600	5487320	that their reviews kind of impact Metacritic, because I know Joystiq did that right before
5487320	5488320	they closed.
5488320	5493240	I think I saw Eurogamer just recently had walked away from giving games a score now.
5493240	5497500	So you know, I think some places are starting to reject this Metacritic thing a little bit,
5497500	5502800	but any way you slice it, the order is sitting at a 65 right now on Metacritic.
5502800	5507960	And a lot of people are saying it's kind of a, although it's a very pretty experience,
5507960	5509760	it's a very pretty looking game.
5509760	5517760	It's a bit of a hollow experience and a lot of attention being called to the play length
5517760	5523420	of the game, which is depending on who you're asking, anywhere from five to eight hours
5523420	5527080	about is how long it's going to take you to play the order from start to finish.
5527080	5531200	Now full disclaimer, I haven't played this game myself yet.
5531200	5537240	I can really only state these opinions based off of what I've heard other people saying
5537240	5538900	about the game.
5538900	5541920	And I believe Loki and Dark Soccer are in the same boat where they haven't played this
5541920	5542920	game themselves yet.
5542920	5543920	I have no interest to play that game.
5543920	5544920	I mean, it looks okay.
5544920	5547000	It's just, it's not my...
5547000	5551480	I wasn't really looking forward to like a third person cover based shooter type game.
5551480	5552960	I have other stuff I'm doing.
5552960	5553960	Yeah.
5553960	5556160	And that's kind of my thing too, is I was like, all right, even though the game looks
5556160	5560800	very pretty, I wasn't really interested in the game to begin with as much as I am some
5560800	5561800	other titles.
5561800	5564080	If I was going to spend $60 in games, there's a bunch of stuff on sale right now that I
5564080	5567640	could be picking up, but I didn't want to buy any more games that I'm not going to play
5567640	5571760	yet because I still haven't touched Watch Dogs or Destiny yet.
5571760	5574000	Or Battlefield 4 because I picked that up as well.
5574000	5575720	So I haven't picked it, played any of that.
5575720	5582000	So let me ask this because a lot of people are saying that if you're going to pay $60
5582000	5585960	on a game, it ought to be more than five to eight hours in length.
5585960	5591480	So and even there's some question out there and I saw some tweets going around and one
5591480	5594120	tweet I remember seeing that came through on my feed and I don't remember who wrote
5594120	5598780	it because it was somebody retweeted or something, but it said something about if you're factoring
5598780	5603280	a game's length into the review, you're doing it wrong or something like that.
5603280	5605360	And I was kind of like, well, wait a minute.
5605840	5607480	I'm not so sure I agree with that.
5608800	5615360	I think the value is important, but at the same time, and I want to make this very clear,
5615840	5621600	I don't think the order, you know, I think the order is just one particular game.
5621600	5626360	I don't think that means all games that are only five to eight hours in length that are
5626360	5629440	$60 are bad just because of their length.
5629640	5633080	I think it just really depends on the quality of what is filling that time.
5633480	5635640	It's not necessarily the game's five hours.
5635640	5637520	It's how much replayability is there?
5637520	5639240	Because it could be five hours long.
5639720	5643360	But if I can replay it multiple times and get enjoyment out of playing that over and over
5643360	5645000	again, then that sounds good.
5645000	5649840	But the problem is it sounds like it's a lot of cut scenes that are kind of, you know,
5649840	5652200	extending the gameplay time a bit.
5652200	5655720	So I don't really know how much enjoyment I would really get out of it unless it's a
5655720	5657240	really, really good story.
5658000	5661600	I just don't know if that's the case.
5661600	5666560	I mean, it could be a pretty looking game, but once again, that doesn't necessarily, you
5666560	5668680	know, there's a lot of games that look good.
5668680	5670120	Grand Theft Auto five looks good.
5670120	5672360	There's hundreds of hours of gameplay there.
5673480	5674800	Skyrim looks good.
5674800	5676240	And that's a really long game.
5677320	5681720	Or even if you want to talk short games, Journey looks nice.
5681720	5687640	It's not necessarily, you know, really cinematic or not to like film quality cinematic, but
5687640	5692480	it's still a fun game and it's short, but you get a lot of replayability out of it.
5693040	5695960	I'm going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
5695960	5700680	Alan Alchemy says, so Parasite Eve length, which is a fucking amazing game.
5701240	5702040	Was it that short?
5702040	5702920	I don't even remember.
5702920	5706280	I mean, I played Parasite Eve all the way through, but I think Parasite Eve was a shorter
5706280	5706600	game.
5706680	5711360	So it wasn't like a lot of people because it came out in that same kind of era as Final Fantasy
5711360	5711960	seven and eight.
5711960	5714840	People think it was a lot longer because those games are longer, but I don't think I don't
5714840	5715280	think it was.
5715280	5720920	You know, the Resident Evil games weren't very long because I could sit and beat two.
5721240	5724080	And we were paying forty, fifty dollars for those games and you didn't hear all this
5724080	5724480	complaining.
5724480	5728400	My complaint, you know, I was complaining, though, back when they put out, was it that
5728400	5730360	Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes thing?
5730640	5734880	And that was only like a few hours long and it was half the price and I was still seeing
5734880	5735640	that was a rip off.
5735960	5738560	So why would I change my mind on some?
5738640	5744440	And you can't argue that, you know, Metal Gear Solid five, Ground Zeroes is a cinematic
5744480	5745920	game, it is.
5745920	5749840	And so I think there's more replayability on that, though, than there is on this, because
5749840	5752960	this sounds very linear, whereas that's kind of more open world.
5753520	5757840	Alan Alchemy further asks, should a game like Skyrim or Dragon Age Inquisition cost three
5757840	5759040	hundred and fifty dollars then?
5759280	5761200	No, I think what's happening is the other way around.
5761200	5766000	I think because Skyrim and Dragon Age Inquisition are also sixty dollar games, people go, well,
5766000	5767600	those games are hundreds and hundreds of hours.
5767600	5769880	But then, you know, the order is over in eight hours.
5770520	5771600	The order should be twenty bucks.
5771600	5775320	And that's that's even unrealistic as far as, you know, not all games are going to be
5775320	5777160	hundred hour epic and they really shouldn't be.
5777160	5782320	But I'm saying, though, let's let's take like, for example, Resistance, Fallen Man or
5782320	5784440	something like that, a game that's kind of linear.
5784440	5786120	It's got a single player campaign to it.
5786120	5789560	And I enjoyed the campaign and I think it was worth sixty dollars.
5789560	5792720	And there's a little bit of replayability there because you can play it again and get
5792720	5793720	more weapons and something like that.
5793840	5794920	And there's multiplayer.
5794920	5796000	So there's that on top of it.
5796000	5800200	So that overall makes it like kind of a well-rounded experience, whereas this is just
5800200	5803480	like a really short, linear game with no multiplayer in it.
5803480	5808320	Like, I can understand if it had like multiplayer aspect to it, it might be a little
5808320	5811480	bit it might be worth a little bit more, but it doesn't even have it.
5811480	5816360	It's like and just the excuses, like the whole development process, like their excuses
5816360	5821160	were, well, we don't want to be 60 frames per second because it's not as cinematic as
5821160	5824520	30 frames per second, which really was just because they wanted to push higher fidelity
5824520	5829280	and they couldn't do that with, you know, a higher frame rate or oh, well, you know,
5829280	5832840	it's short because it's this, you know, and they're making excuses.
5832840	5834320	And it's just I don't like it.
5834320	5839160	And especially, which I'm assuming this thing has a season pass because goddamn, all
5839160	5841720	games nowadays seem to have season passes with DLC.
5842040	5846320	I want to see what they put out for DLC, because, you know, if that's stuff that could
5846320	5850720	have easily been, why don't you just how about just wait until the, you know, whatever
5850720	5854000	complete edition comes out or something like that, that might be a little bit more
5854000	5858200	worth it. And if it is terrible, I think some people are worried that the order may
5858200	5863000	have DLC and that and I can actually I can kind of get where some of that might be a
5863000	5866360	little bit justified. Like if this DLC comes out and then they're asking even more
5866360	5869800	money for it, where some people are going to get like really irritated with that.
5869800	5873720	I mean, at least Parasite Eve never tried to sell DLC on top of it type of thing.
5873720	5876760	Right. But anyway, there's a lot of great comments in our chat room here.
5876760	5880520	I want to make sure I get through some of these over in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
5880800	5885560	The SAG is there saying for a buyer's review, cost versus gameplay length needs to be
5885560	5890680	noted. Academic criticism not relevant, which isn't to say it's the factor, but just
5890680	5891400	something to know.
5891400	5893400	You know, I think I agree with that.
5893400	5899840	You know, I remember it was an EGM or games, I think it was EGM that used to do that
5899840	5904560	where they would have kind of a review in there, like a little chart almost showing
5904560	5906120	replayability over time.
5906120	5906680	Yeah, yeah.
5906680	5908080	And I love that.
5908080	5909080	I think that's a great idea.
5909080	5910720	And this kind of would fall into it.
5910720	5915120	It's like if this game has a ton of replayability to it, then by all means, a five hour
5915120	5917440	time frame on it doesn't mean really much of anything.
5917760	5921480	It's just, you know, I mean, like a lot of arcade games were short.
5921560	5923520	Right. Let me get through some more of these comments.
5923520	5924280	There's so many good ones.
5924280	5928960	acteft in live.vognetwork.com says portal one is an hour short and who doesn't love
5928960	5931880	portal one? Well, maybe once you know how to do it, portal one's an hour.
5931880	5937640	But still, I would say portal two was maybe a maybe a five hour game.
5937640	5940480	Right. And it was full, it's been so long since I played it.
5940680	5944200	Then again, it did have the multiplayer element to it, but it still was a shorter
5944200	5947560	game. And I didn't see people complaining about, you know, the length of that.
5947560	5951200	But then again, it's also something that now with, you know, the level letters and
5951200	5953080	stuff, the replayability is huge.
5953400	5954480	Let me get through some more comments.
5954840	5960040	Let's see over at live.vognetwork.com, Dungeon Buster is pointing out that the $40
5960040	5961920	for the orange box went towards the entire package.
5961920	5962920	Let's not forget portal one.
5963120	5965160	They weren't selling for $60 by itself.
5965160	5968560	The orange box is one of the greatest gaming values they've ever released.
5968960	5972040	Kaijuto says you're paying for the experience, not the game time.
5972200	5975520	That's like saying shorter movies should cost less than longer movies.
5975640	5979720	Can we, hold on, if you want to pay less for a shorter game, just rent it like people
5979720	5981040	have been doing for years.
5981200	5984640	Can we get a remastered version of the orange box on these consoles?
5985280	5986280	I buy that again.
5987520	5992120	And you know, the movie is a good comparison because honestly, people will buy a Disney
5992120	5993880	movie that's 90 minutes long.
5993920	5999640	They'll buy a $29 Blu-ray of The Lion King and not even give it a second thought.
5999640	6000960	And it's like a 90 minute movie.
6001640	6005480	But a movie like that, you can watch over and over and over and over and over and over
6005480	6005920	and over again.
6005920	6008440	And probably, especially if you're a child and never get sick of it, right?
6008520	6010560	Yeah, but then you're comparing like stories.
6010720	6016040	I mean, like I said, if the story of The Order is really, really, really good, then
6016040	6017280	there's no problem there.
6017440	6022720	I just, I have a hard time believing that it's like, you know, if the story that would
6022720	6026960	have to be that good would be like, for me, it would have to be along the lines of like
6027440	6029480	Bioshock Infinite or something like that.
6029480	6032880	You know, something really like, wow, you know, that's a really cool story.
6033320	6037640	So, yeah, and I think the bottom line here and just kind of to try to wrap this subject
6037640	6044000	up is that I think just because a game is six to eight hours and is $60 doesn't mean
6044000	6049480	that the game is instantly bad or a bad value and we shouldn't necessarily turn away
6049480	6053360	and not even try a game because it's only six to eight hours and happens to be $60
6053560	6056440	because there are a lot of good, compact experiences out there.
6056640	6060600	It sounds to me like The Order is just not one of those experiences.
6060600	6065480	For as hyped as this game was, you know, it might be very pretty and so forth, but the
6065480	6069360	game, again, from what I'm hearing secondhand, maybe the game just wasn't
6069360	6070200	particularly memorable.
6070200	6074520	It sounds to me that they spent so much time on getting the visuals right on it, that
6074520	6077600	they ran out of time to make the rest of the game and then they just had to put it up
6077600	6080280	because it had already been delayed and delayed and delayed.
6080440	6084640	And now it's just like, well, it's short, but we'll just make it up later in DLC that
6084640	6085640	we can sell or something.
6085760	6086240	Yeah.
6086880	6089920	All right, anyhow, I'm sure there's plenty more to say on this topic, but maybe we'll
6089920	6093480	take that to the forums for a little bit of a follow up next week.
6094000	6096840	Anyhow, I do want to move on, though, because we're running a little long for this
6096840	6097520	half of the show.
6098240	6102920	But excuse me, we have to get to our classic game of the week.
6106680	6109960	Every week, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game where she's
6109960	6117720	like, hey, back in my day, you paid $60 to be a little square that would bounce a ball
6118280	6119160	and you loved it.
6120800	6122960	It's the classic game of the week.
6123280	6127760	Dark Sakura, well, maybe this isn't really a square with a ball, but it is a classic
6127760	6127800	game.
6127800	6129640	It's at least 10 years old to qualify.
6129640	6130680	It's older than some of you kids.
6130760	6131240	That's right.
6131240	6133120	Dark Sakura, what is the classic game of the week this week?
6133280	6134840	The classic game is Batagun.
6135440	6141400	It is a vertical shoot-em-up game that was put up by a developer called Toaplan.
6142400	6146480	The name translates to exceptional or extraordinary.
6147640	6153800	It was an arcade game that came out in 1993, and there was a second version that was
6153800	6159480	shown at the Arcade Operators Union in Japan that never came out because Toaplan went
6159480	6160240	into bankruptcy.
6160680	6162920	It was called a Batagun special version.
6162920	6166760	It appeared, though, on the second-hand market, by the way.
6167640	6176520	There were two versions out on the Sega Saturn, one in 1996 that was recoded by an
6176520	6178280	offshoot of Toaplan called Gazelle.
6179080	6185280	This is the game that many people will say started the bullet hell genre or manic
6185280	6185680	shooter.
6186520	6193200	Basically, as the game was being developed, the employees would go up.
6193200	6195320	Well, let me rephrase this.
6195920	6200600	People who were involved in the development of the game went on to work at Cave and
6200600	6201320	made this a thing.
6202720	6209200	The main programmer of the game was Seneki Ikeda, who had a...
6210200	6216160	I'd probably say this game, since it's pretty vicious with how hard it can get.
6217000	6219200	I need to find this guy and go, why?
6220200	6227720	Anyway, the special editions had a few different challenges and had a smaller
6227720	6234200	hitbox, a shield, more powerful bombs, scoring items, and multiple game rounds or
6234200	6236080	loops that got harder and harder.
6236480	6242440	The Saturn versions were almost the same, but they had a few different things,
6242440	6247200	including rearranged music and lack of slowdown in some cases.
6247200	6252320	So it actually, you couldn't rely on the slowdown to give you more time to judge
6252320	6254000	where your bullets were.
6254960	6257440	So basically, it's the joystick two-button control.
6257560	6263760	You have a fire, you have a bomb, and you gain experience points that are separate
6263760	6264520	from the score.
6265000	6269440	So every 288 points, your gun will level up and get stronger.
6269920	6274520	So it's kind of like RPG elements in a shoot-em-up.
6275280	6278320	The characters, though, were like super fucking generic-looking, as I'll get out.
6279320	6282920	You had Geno, who actually looks kind of like Trunks from Dragon Ball Z.
6283760	6292840	And then you have just the generic girl named, I'm going to mispronounce her name,
6292920	6293800	Beltiana.
6295280	6301560	And then you had the other guy who's like the pretty boy, bad boy guy named Iceman,
6302280	6307720	who's like, I'm sure was a complete rip-off of Val Kilmer's character in Top Gun.
6308360	6313840	So anyway, you also can get points by collecting these V-shaped medals.
6313840	6317840	And you get 3,000 points when the thing's finished for every one of those that you
6317840	6320360	have, and 5,000 points for larger ones.
6320400	6323760	And then if your ship is destroyed, you lose all your medals.
6323760	6326120	You get an extra life at 1 million points.
6326600	6330280	Now, the names of the ships just have the best names, the bad guys.
6332360	6339480	You have Deep Purple, Madzilla, Deep Steel Darkness, Jupiter, and Ground of the
6339480	6340120	Galaxy.
6340440	6345240	It's with an R in it for how it was romanized, Galaxy, but I still think it's
6345240	6345520	awesome.
6345760	6348920	My favorite, though, is Mad Steel Darkness, because that's just a cool name, and I
6348920	6349880	would steal that for a band.
6350280	6350920	So there you go.
6351560	6352120	Botsugan.
6354160	6358680	I have to admit, I have not really, I don't have a familiarity with this game until
6358680	6359880	you are mentioning it here.
6360680	6364840	I did not realize this was a game to thank for the bullet hell, but I can definitely
6364840	6365640	see it in this.
6366120	6366440	Yep.
6367240	6371560	Did you see, like, just how, I mean, for as pretty as this game is, and the good
6371560	6375920	music and really fun that it is, did you see just how absolutely generic the
6375920	6376560	characters are?
6376600	6377160	Yeah.
6377320	6379480	Seriously, it's like, this guy looks like Trunks.
6379800	6382600	This guy looks like, you know, generic anime guy number three.
6382680	6383800	What year is this from?
6383800	6384680	1993.
6384760	6390440	So yeah, they all have that sort of mid to early 90s anime looking everybody.
6390440	6390760	It's okay.
6390760	6392920	I don't, I don't fault the game for that, really.
6393080	6397800	This is actually a game I'm looking to get on Saturn, but I haven't, um, you
6397800	6400520	know, when it's come across my path, I haven't had the money for it, so.
6401240	6401640	All right.
6402200	6402840	So there you go.
6403480	6404040	There it is.
6404040	6406280	Your classic game of the week.
6406280	6409640	Batsu gun here on orange laundry.
6409640	6411560	That's a good, I always say gun though.
6411560	6412360	Cause it's a shooter.
6414200	6416120	Surely you understand where I'm making my mistake.
6417160	6417480	All right.
6417880	6422680	Um, dark soccer, what, what, uh, bullet hell shooters do you think we would owe
6422680	6423240	this game?
6423240	6424040	Thanks.
6424040	6425560	Espa galuda.
6425560	6427000	Because I like saying espa galuda.
6429480	6432280	I think for a while I was calling it escaped beluga.
6432840	6438040	Uh, that is going to do it here on orange launch radio for the first half of our
6438040	6441000	show, but don't go anywhere because there is plenty more show to come.
6441000	6443720	When we come back, we're going to get into the Fugu question of the week, some
6443720	6448120	rapid fire news, your emails, or maybe it's just email this week and your calls.
6448120	6450200	We got more OLR, uh, to go.
6450200	6452360	We got, and it's already 7 55.
6452360	6456200	We got to get going here, uh, to try to get done here by nine o'clock or midnight
6456200	6456760	on the East coast.
6456760	6458600	Or I guess we just go along tonight.
6458600	6462440	We'll find out when we come back with more of OLR right after this.
6463480	6475320	Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live with our 588th episode on this
6475320	6479000	February, the 22nd of 2015.
6479000	6480040	And, uh, wow.
6480040	6484520	I can't believe we're 588 episodes in, which means 600, believe it or not, we're
6484520	6489240	gonna, we're gonna more than likely get to 600 and 600 is looking on the horizon.
6489240	6492680	Uh, and the date for that, just if you guys are planning, it looks like it's going to
6492680	6497240	be May 24th would be the date that episode 600 is going to fall onto.
6497240	6501960	Uh, that is assuming there is no more canceled shows after the PAX East week.
6501960	6503960	Cause obviously if we cancel shows, it gets pushed back.
6503960	6504920	Wouldn't that be funny though?
6504920	6509400	Because if we ended up, if we canceled like four shows, not that I'm saying we
6509400	6513000	should do that, but it would, uh, it would actually end up that our 600th episode
6513000	6515320	and our 13th anniversary would be on like the same day.
6515320	6516600	So that would be kind of funny.
6516600	6520200	Uh, but anyway, just for those of you guys, uh, playing along at home, uh, I
6520200	6522120	don't know if we're going to do anything super big.
6522120	6526280	We always talk about like, should we do something special for the 10 year, for
6526280	6529400	the 500, for the 11 year, should we do something special that we never do?
6529960	6534760	So 13 is kind of a weird, 13 is kind of a weird one, which, but it's 13.
6534760	6538120	I mean, you know, that's kind of a lucky number for a lot of people.
6538120	6538680	So I don't know.
6539960	6541480	That would be a, uh, our bar.
6541480	6543720	Don't we get a bar mitzvah when we turn 13?
6543720	6544280	That's what we need.
6544280	6545800	The orange lounge radio bar mitzvah.
6548760	6551640	Jamie's giving me these looks of like, um, dot, dot, dot.
6552280	6554280	Are you going to read from the Torah and Klingon?
6554280	6555000	I guess I can.
6556760	6558440	Maybe grandpa from Horthouse would be willing.
6558440	6559480	He probably knows Klingon.
6559480	6560040	He's a nerd.
6560920	6561240	True.
6562040	6563160	You knew where that came from, right?
6563880	6569080	There was an episode of Frasier where he went to the, to the, uh, bar mitzvah and
6569080	6570360	read the speech in Klingon.
6572200	6575400	Uh, actually grandpa's in chat right now saying a Jerry Lewis telethon or Rob
6575400	6576360	Roberts telethon.
6576360	6582040	Actually, I'm all about the charity stuff and we have yet to really do a big, big
6582040	6582920	charity push.
6582920	6585960	So that's always a possibility, especially considering if I'm not
6585960	6590680	mistaking, May 24th would be Memorial day weekend.
6590680	6591240	Right.
6591240	6593400	So, or is it the next week?
6593400	6593800	I don't know.
6594440	6596280	Maybe we'll actually kind of fall at a good time.
6596280	6596680	We'll see.
6598120	6598440	All right.
6598440	6602120	Uh, anyway, for now let's get into, maybe that's something we can plan on our
6602120	6603080	forums.
6603080	6605320	Let's do a segment we like to call forum feedback.
6605320	6613960	If you were not aware, Orange L'Antranio has a forum at the voice of geeks network
6613960	6618840	vog network.com, uh, over at forums.vog network.com.
6618840	6620360	That's VOG network.com.
6620360	6622760	And I got to say props to you guys this week.
6622760	6627320	Clap, clap, clap, clap, because now it's not just me making topics.
6627320	6629000	The listeners are making topics.
6629000	6629560	Thank you.
6629560	6631560	And this is starting to take off a little bit.
6631560	6632840	Who says forums are dead?
6632840	6634600	You guys are, you guys are helping out in a big way.
6634600	6635240	Thank you so much.
6635720	6638200	I want to feature a couple of posts that were made on the forums this week.
6638200	6640600	I'm actually going to focus.
6640600	6642680	I can't read every post that's made.
6642680	6647000	We make posts to have discussions, but I want to at least touch on a couple of the, uh,
6647000	6647800	listener made ones.
6648360	6653080	YYR made a post on nostalgia, which had come up in our last episode.
6653080	6655960	When does nostalgia come up on Orange L'Antranio?
6655960	6656840	That never happens.
6657960	6663720	Anyway, uh, but YYR started a topic on nostalgia, wanting to touch specifically on the discussion
6663720	6667640	that happened late in the episode with this, with Sonic and nostalgia.
6667640	6671160	I think somebody had made the comment about George RR Martin should kill off all Sonic's
6671160	6671400	friends.
6671400	6672280	Remember that?
6672280	6678920	So the caller that suggested it was akin to chasing that first high may have been onto
6678920	6682760	something for some people at least, but while the human body is constantly changing and
6682760	6687080	no two drug samples are the same old video games are unique in the fact that they never
6687080	6688280	change ever.
6688280	6692520	Every old game is exactly the same as it was all those years ago.
6692520	6696040	Now, I'm not sure if I'm just different or strange, but in recent times when I've gone
6696040	6700520	back and played Mega Man 2, Super Mario World or other favorite games I played as a kid,
6700520	6702760	I feel the same joy as I did back then.
6702760	6706360	Everything is just as I remembered it, and I love revisiting these old classics again
6706360	6707000	and again.
6707000	6710360	This applies even to old Atari or Commodore games.
6710360	6713400	I wonder if maybe this is because I've gone back to this stuff every few years.
6713400	6716040	There hasn't been a huge gap of 15 or 20 years.
6716040	6718360	How does everyone else feel when revisiting these old things?
6718360	6720920	Rebel Romance replied to this and said,
6748360	6753800	Me, when I play Super Mario Brothers 2, and it's a very specific moment in Mario Brothers
6753800	6759240	2, when I play Super Mario Brothers 2, and I don't use those warp zones, I actually play
6759240	6764600	the game straight through, and I get to World 1-3 where you fight the boss Mauser.
6764600	6765080	Remember that?
6765080	6765880	Remember the boss Mauser?
6766680	6768520	Mario 2 had some really awesome characters.
6768520	6769560	Never really came back.
6769560	6770760	Like, there was what?
6770760	6771880	Fry Guy and...
6771880	6773720	Yeah, but those weren't technically...
6773720	6777560	I know they were part of the whole the Japanese Doki Doki.
6777560	6782840	But if they can repurpose the Shy Guys...
6782840	6786360	Come on, Shy Guys came from that game, and they've been repurposed in all these other
6786360	6786920	Mario games.
6786920	6789160	If they can do that, they can bring back Wart or something.
6789160	6790920	I'm waiting for a Mario game where we take him on again.
6790920	6792200	But anyway, I digress.
6792760	6800840	When I play Mauser, I remember that night, and it was New Year's Eve, probably when I
6800840	6801960	was 10 years old.
6801960	6805160	I might be fudging the year a little bit, but I think I was 10 years old on New Year's
6805160	6805800	Eve.
6805800	6810520	I stayed up all night because you could do that because it was New Year's Eve, so a 10
6810520	6811560	year old could be up all night.
6811560	6814680	That was the one day a year you got to be a total insomniac as a kid, right?
6815320	6818040	I stayed up all night trying to beat him.
6818040	6820360	And I finally did, but I remember it took several tries.
6820360	6821160	And I just...
6821160	6826040	I don't know, when I play Mauser in Super Mario Brothers 2, I'm taken back to, I'm staying
6826040	6826840	up all night.
6826840	6827720	I'm being bad.
6827720	6829320	I'm staying up all night and playing video games.
6829320	6830040	This is what I love.
6830760	6835080	So I don't know if you guys have any specific moments you remember like that, but that's
6835400	6835880	something for me.
6835880	6838200	No, but I have a thought about Sonic, though.
6838200	6842280	See, the thing is, I think the new series now, Sonic Boom, is they're trying to be very
6842280	6843480	formulaic with it.
6843480	6848360	Instead of just making a Sonic game and making a good Sonic game, like they did with the
6848360	6852600	original Sonic games, now it's like, we got to turn it into a franchise.
6852600	6857240	But not necessarily a franchise that is a video game franchise, but a franchise that
6857240	6860360	we can put on lunch boxes and we can sell all this stuff.
6860360	6864120	They want to turn it into like a Skylanders or even...
6864120	6865560	See, Pac-Man did the same thing.
6865560	6869080	They turned it into the Ghostly Adventures thing and they're trying to sell the TV show
6869080	6872280	to get the kids hooked on it, but kids don't give a shit about it.
6872280	6873720	And that's the problem is...
6873720	6877480	It was kind of when Pac-Man went back to its roots with the Championship Edition and so
6877480	6880200	forth, like the original designer had a hand in that, right?
6880200	6884760	When you got Pac-Man Battle Royale, these are all like really strong offerings in the
6884760	6885720	Pac-Man series, right?
6885720	6889880	Even like the cartoon, like I've watched some of the cartoon with my son.
6889880	6892040	The Ghostly Adventures isn't terrible.
6892040	6893960	It's just, I don't know.
6893960	6896680	I just think Sonic Boom is just kind of way off.
6896680	6899640	It's not the same thing, I guess.
6899640	6903000	It's kind of like how Skylanders isn't Spyro, maybe.
6904840	6906600	Anyway, I love these type of stories.
6906600	6910680	And YYR is actually in chat right now saying, that is so specific and it's interesting that
6910680	6914360	you remember the positive aspect of that and not the, it took so many tries part.
6914360	6918440	You know, also not to get like too deep or whatever, but like, I have serious memory
6918440	6918920	problems.
6918920	6920120	Just ask Alan about this.
6920120	6923000	Like Alan has to remind me of shit all the time.
6923000	6925000	I double book myself constantly.
6925000	6926760	I forget things all the time.
6926760	6929080	Heaven help you if I'm supposed to remember your birthday.
6929080	6931160	If it weren't for Facebook, I'd probably forget them all.
6931160	6933320	Like I just, I have a horrible memory.
6933320	6939560	So when I do have like things like that, that I really cling to another, I'll tell you,
6939560	6942760	I'll give you one more since you like that one YYR, I'll give you one more.
6942760	6945080	And I remember a lot of you when you were younger remember this.
6945080	6949640	I remember again, this was a stay up all night slumber party and my friend Devin growing
6949640	6952920	up his house, we were playing star tropics for the first time.
6952920	6953960	And he had just got it.
6953960	6957000	And we were playing, I swear to God, we were playing that game all fucking night.
6957000	6960360	And we got to the part where you had to have the letter.
6961080	6966760	And I swear to God, I can't remember what I did last week, but I can remember the layout
6966760	6969880	of Devin's kitchen going to get the jar.
6969880	6973160	Cause it was like, it was like an old school, like Mason jar type of thing that we got.
6973160	6977800	We filled with water and put that letter in there so that you could see that code that
6977800	6978920	actually came up on there.
6978920	6983240	So anyway, I do, I have these like really random ass memories in gaming.
6983240	6985800	So when things like that come up, I cling to them.
6985800	6989960	Or in case you don't have the mail cause you bought the game used and you have to call
6989960	6991400	Nintendo hint line.
6991400	6995880	They're like, well, I just put the letter in the, in, in, in the, uh, in water.
6995880	6997320	I'm like, what letter?
6997320	6998680	And their letter came with the manual.
6998680	6999800	I don't have the manual.
6999800	7000120	Okay.
7000120	7001480	The code seven 67.
7001480	7003880	Oh my gosh.
7003880	7005320	Uh, why, why are I'm sorry?
7005320	7006200	Seven 47.
7006200	7010360	I have to write everything down or ask people to remind me, but I will always remember how
7010360	7012680	to get through the beams of the quick man stage.
7012680	7013000	Yes.
7013000	7014920	I am high fiving you from California.
7014920	7015240	Yes.
7015240	7016520	I totally remember that.
7016520	7016760	Okay.
7016760	7017560	You want one more story?
7017560	7018120	One more story.
7018120	7019560	Rob was literally doing that by the way.
7019560	7022040	I, I don't lie here on OLR.
7022040	7026760	I also remember getting in a heap shit ton of trouble in the fifth grade.
7026760	7030600	I got busted because the teacher was trying to teach.
7031160	7034280	Which is ironic now that I'm also a teacher, but the teacher was trying to teach and I
7034280	7039080	wasn't having it because I just got the latest episode of Nintendo power or at least episode
7039080	7043080	latest issue of Nintendo power with Simon Belmont on the cover.
7043080	7046440	It was that very controversial cover on, if you remember, I got that and I brought it
7046440	7050280	to school and, um, I was showing one of my friends while she was trying to teach and
7050280	7051160	she got so pissed.
7051160	7052360	She took it away from me.
7052360	7056840	But what's funny about that memory is that what was on the cover, which if I remember
7056840	7059800	why it was kind of a graphic decapitation was on the cover.
7059800	7060840	That wasn't an issue.
7061800	7063720	I never got in trouble over that.
7063720	7066520	I got in trouble for bringing literature to school.
7066520	7070120	Nowadays, you'd be like supporting, you know, terrorism or something like that.
7070120	7072440	And they arrest you.
7072440	7072840	Anyway.
7073640	7075720	YYR says, wasn't that the second issue ever?
7075720	7077640	It was one of the first five for sure.
7078200	7079240	It might've been the second one.
7079240	7081000	It was, it was an early one for sure.
7081000	7081640	For sure.
7081640	7085080	Anyway, uh, moving on, uh, let's get to it now.
7085080	7088120	You know what the payback I get for that is, by the way, when I'm trying to teach class
7088120	7092280	and people are on the fucking internet while I'm trying to teach, teach a class anyway,
7093720	7098040	uh, going to another topic from our forums one more tonight where a Flacco Jones has
7098040	7103000	started a topic on video games, genre mashups, uh, because, uh, he was talking about that.
7103000	7106840	We had the guys from Star Mazer on last week, which by the way, congrats.
7106840	7108280	They made their Kickstarter goal.
7108280	7110440	And I'd like to think we helped a little bit.
7110440	7113560	Surely their own telethons and they did like a 24 hour thing on Friday.
7113560	7117080	That was probably a big part of it, but they not only hit their goal, they did make it
7117080	7123240	to 180,000, which was their first stretch goal for, um, bringing in more musical talent.
7123240	7126280	So some of those great names that they were talking about are going to be on this soundtrack.
7126280	7128440	So congrats to those guys from Star Mazer.
7128440	7132440	But, uh, Flacco Jones had been listening to the interview and said, I was intrigued by
7132440	7134920	the merging of point and click and shmup genres.
7134920	7138520	And I wanted to know what other genre mashups the listeners could come up with.
7138520	7139320	I'll start.
7139320	7143080	When I interviewed with Konami to be a game tester years ago, one of the questions they
7143080	7145240	asked me was, what is your favorite type of video game?
7145240	7149080	And I answered, I like RPGs and sports games the most.
7149080	7151880	The interview commented that he never heard that combination before.
7151880	7155080	And that got me thinking about not the individual genres, but combining them.
7155080	7156680	Well, I don't play them as much anymore.
7156680	7160200	One of the things I liked most about playing sports games was career mode.
7160200	7164200	If there even was one now take that concept and really expand it to incorporate elements
7164200	7168280	of RPGs, where you upgrade your character skills, not just through combat or playing
7168280	7171640	the games in this case, but through all sorts of other methods, such as interaction with
7171640	7173960	other characters, side quests, and so on.
7173960	7178440	If during your career mode, your athlete makes a blunder on social media, for example, they
7178440	7180280	actually lose stats.
7180280	7184200	There's a ton of possibilities beyond just playing a sporting event and getting better
7184200	7186600	or worse throughout the season or career.
7186600	7191080	Now, Bobby Black Wolf joined in and followed this up saying, you know, the NCAA football
7191080	7192040	games did that for a while.
7192040	7195400	You'd have to schedule your off time and that affected your stats the next game.
7195400	7197640	Spend free time studying raises your awareness.
7197640	7199800	Spend time into the gym raises your toughness.
7199800	7202280	Spend time with your girlfriend distresses you.
7202280	7205720	In your dorm room, you would even have a picture of your current girlfriend.
7205720	7208440	And as you got better, you got hotter girlfriends.
7208440	7210200	Well, that's interesting, but okay.
7211560	7215160	You can then take that character and import them into Madden, which would take his stats.
7215160	7218440	And then Madden also has stuff like press interviews and coach interactions.
7218440	7220120	It's very basic, but the groundwork is there.
7220120	7225240	They even simulate Twitter now where you can see ESPN pundits and fans tweeting about your
7225240	7226440	action on the field.
7228680	7229480	Oh my gosh.
7230120	7233640	And then YYR said, has there been a combined fighting music game yet?
7233640	7236360	Like if you hit enemies off beat, they barely flinch.
7236360	7239880	But if you punch them perfectly on beat, they explode into bloody chunks.
7239880	7244200	Not so much that, but Def Jam Icon was a fighting game set to music.
7244200	7248440	See, and Bobby Black Wolf has suggested Kickbeat to that actually as well.
7249160	7253640	And YYR said, Kickbeat's kind of a rhythm game at its core, but I meant something like
7253640	7257000	you have free control over your character and their attacks, like final fight.
7257000	7258840	But the timing of the attack matters.
7258840	7260680	Also bloody explosions, very important.
7260680	7265080	Def Jam Icon, but it wasn't bloody explosions, but it would like, if you hit stuff on the
7265080	7267000	beat, then it would do more damage.
7267000	7267800	In a way.
7267800	7274840	I mean, I don't, this is kind of out there, but go back to the old school Kung Fu on the
7274840	7275960	8-bit NES.
7275960	7277400	Do you remember Kung Fu?
7277400	7280760	Like it was like a side scroller and you were going up the different stories to, I don't
7280760	7283320	know, rescue your girlfriend who was on the fifth floor or something like that.
7283400	7287240	You know, there was a pattern to the way those enemies would show up.
7287240	7290840	And for some people you would kind of get it to the music, right?
7290840	7296600	So in a way, like a game like Kung Fu, you could probably memorize some of the patterns
7296600	7298760	of the guys that come out to the music.
7298760	7303320	I don't know, but I think I kind of just like maybe the concept is rooted in there somewhere,
7303320	7305800	somewhere, but of course we need more bloody explosions.
7305800	7307560	I completely understand that.
7307560	7312680	Anyway, great suggestions, great suggestions on the forums.
7312680	7313720	I love these posts.
7313720	7314280	Post more.
7314280	7315240	You guys are doing awesome.
7315240	7317240	Forums.vognetwork.com.
7317240	7320760	Don't be shy, but remember I can't read everything on air because I've already spent 15 minutes
7320760	7325160	reading that and we got to get into some more segments like our rapid fire news.
7325160	7325800	Loki.
7325800	7329800	Yeah, it's funny that you mentioned Star Tropics because this story actually has to do with
7329800	7330920	Star Tropics.
7330920	7338200	Apparently this guy named Brad Smith was playing Star Tropics and noticed that there was something
7338200	7345160	kind of funky about the sound in the game and actually went through and edited the ROM
7345160	7351720	to fix the problem, to basically fix, there was like this little bit of, I don't know
7351720	7356440	what you'd call it, like part of the melody or whatever that cuts out in the game that
7356440	7360680	comes back later on in like the overworld and it just sounds weird.
7360680	7365960	So he found out what it was and, you know, edited some code errors in there.
7365960	7371560	Now it plays fine, but it's kind of cool that people go back and bug fix stuff, you
7371560	7373640	know, from a long time ago.
7373640	7376360	Kind of like how they remember the ET and made ET better.
7376360	7377160	That was pretty cool.
7379240	7380840	And then this is kind of funny.
7382200	7386920	Did you know that there was a Carmen Sandiego game that took place entirely in North Dakota?
7387960	7392040	Yes, there was a Where in North Dakota is Carmen Sandiego.
7392040	7395160	I believe that I brought this up when I actually covered Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego.
7395160	7396120	Did you really?
7396120	7397400	I don't, I didn't remember it.
7397400	7398200	I believe I did.
7398200	7398680	Oh, maybe.
7399400	7403800	It actually happened a few other places were able to license the character for doing a
7403800	7406360	local edutainment games.
7406360	7408760	Is this something making the blog rounds again this week or something?
7408760	7409320	Yes.
7409320	7410040	Okay, I got it.
7410680	7415080	But they actually had like a review that was done of the game and kind of showing it and
7415080	7416360	it looked like it was pretty decent.
7418040	7421480	Yeah, originally there were supposed to be 20 different states kind of trying to license
7421480	7425400	their own versions of the game, but it never ended up happening.
7425400	7431320	So let me think if she's in North Dakota, she's probably in, I don't know, Bismarck
7431320	7433080	because where else are you going to go in North Dakota?
7434440	7437640	Well, there's lots of different cities there.
7437640	7438840	So she's in a field.
7439960	7440520	I'm kidding.
7440520	7441000	I'm kidding.
7441000	7444840	I don't want angry North Dakotans messaging me, but apparently, yeah, you can actually,
7444840	7445880	I think, download the game.
7445880	7454120	They were saying that it's on Asimov's Apple II FTP, which is ftp.apple.asimov.net.
7455640	7456440	So that's kind of cool.
7457640	7462840	And then this is where in North Dakota is Carmen Sandiego Bismarck.
7463480	7464680	She's in Bismarck.
7467240	7469640	Anyways, I'm singing way too much on tonight's show.
7469640	7470680	I apologize.
7470680	7472040	I apologize.
7472040	7472760	It's very sweet.
7472760	7478680	This is one of the old shareware games I used to love back in the 90s, Raptor Call of the
7478680	7479320	Shadows.
7479320	7486200	It was a shmup game that came out, and now they have a brand new kind of addition of
7486200	7495160	it, the 2015 edition on Steam that you can get for $4.49, and it brings back, was it
7495160	7496120	27 levels?
7496120	7502520	And I want to say, was this Apogee or, I don't remember who made this, but it was
7502520	7503720	awesome, so go check it out.
7505800	7509960	And it had a mode, and they had like, I wonder if the Easter eggs are still in there, because
7509960	7513800	they had a mode with like, if you played it on the developer's birthday or something,
7513800	7518520	like the enemies became lizards and stuff, and it would have like funny music and, I
7518520	7518840	don't know.
7520360	7526920	All right, well, moving on to, this isn't so much a classic video game, but it's definitely
7526920	7531640	a classic board game that does have a video game adaptation.
7531640	7533080	A lot of people really love this game.
7533080	7535000	It shows up in a lot of board game parties.
7535000	7537000	It's Settlers of Catan.
7537000	7542200	Settlers of Catan apparently has been optioned to be made into a movie or TV show.
7542200	7542920	What?
7542920	7543320	Right?
7543320	7545160	This is gonna be weird.
7545160	7550360	Producer Gail Katz, known for movies like Pawn Sacrifice, Air Force One, and The Perfect
7550360	7555880	Storm, bought the film and television rights for Settlers of Catan, saying she's excited
7555880	7559720	by vivid, visual, exciting, and timeless world of Catan.
7560680	7565080	Now, the weird thing is, there's really no plot to Settlers of Catan, so...
7566040	7568840	It's all about trading your sheep for wood or...
7568840	7571880	But at the same time, that means there's a lot you can do with it.
7571880	7577640	So, I don't know, Clue was a board game, is like one of the best movies ever.
7578360	7580280	So, but then there's also Battleship.
7580280	7582120	So, I'm hoping...
7582120	7586680	But the problem is like, whenever I hear that they're licensing like some sort of fantasy
7586680	7593720	or medieval like genre game, it's just like, hey, we want to try to be the next Game of
7593720	7595720	Thrones, and that's what I always worry about.
7595720	7597000	No, I hope not.
7597000	7600760	It's just like, I don't know, there's not really a story to Settlers of Catan.
7600760	7604920	Unless you do like something like ridiculous, like it's a bunch of people that play Settlers
7604920	7609240	of Catan professionally or something like that, then maybe there'd be some silly movie
7609240	7611160	out of that, but I don't see it.
7611880	7614760	Anyhow, the Xbox One, the screenshots.
7614760	7618920	We talked about this, I think, a couple weeks ago on the show because there was a tweet
7618920	7621080	or something that had gone out from Phil Spencer.
7621080	7624200	However, this week it's rolling out to beta testers.
7624200	7630200	It's going to be part of the March system update, and this will allow you to say, Xbox,
7630200	7634520	take a screenshot, you know, if you have that Kinect, or you can double tap the Xbox button
7634520	7637480	on the controller and then press Y to take a picture.
7637480	7641400	There's a little demo video that shows how it works, but it's just a screenshot, y'all.
7641400	7642600	It's not that complicated.
7642600	7643960	Glad to hear you're getting that feature.
7644840	7651720	And lastly, a video game hall of fame being created at the National Museum of Play, another
7651720	7656760	term, I guess another way to call the strong, which is the folks that are behind this,
7656760	7659080	museumofplay.org.
7659080	7664760	It's a New York-based outfit, and they are considering any game, basically, right now
7664760	7669000	for its freshman class of World Video Game Hall of Fame honorees.
7669000	7672760	It could be arcade, console, computer, handheld, or mobile.
7673640	7677800	Visit the Strong's website and make a case for why it is your choice.
7678600	7683480	I guess the website for that is worldvideogamehalloffame.org
7683480	7686440	slash nominate, so you can check that out.
7686440	7693400	So, quickly, what video game are we going to ask the OL Army to go nominate?
7694520	7699320	What video game do we believe they should be nominating into the Hall of Fame?
7699320	7701160	I was going to say President Cat.
7701240	7701740	No.
7703480	7704760	Duh, The Guardian Legend.
7705960	7707560	I could support The Guardian Legend.
7708280	7710520	Very overlooked classic on the NES.
7710520	7711880	Loki, you okay with that?
7711880	7712520	I'm fine with that.
7712520	7713480	Alright, The Guardian Legend.
7713480	7714920	That or Miss World Nude Nights.
7720600	7722040	Both are classics in their own right.
7724760	7728520	Go ye fourth listeners, make it work, make it happen.
7728520	7732840	Get either The Guardian Legend or Miss Nude World 96.
7732840	7735160	Come on Dark Soccer, you have to admit that's a pretty good choice.
7735160	7735660	No.
7735960	7737640	Everybody, move your body.
7737640	7738280	Guardian Legend.
7739080	7739640	There is nothing else.
7739640	7741080	It's a singing episode, it's a musical episode.
7741080	7741960	There is nothing else.
7743160	7746760	I don't know, I might go nominate Miss Nude World 96 now.
7746760	7747260	Alright.
7749320	7752200	Alright, Dark Soccer, if you want you can change the topic with some more news.
7752840	7753340	Spawn.
7753340	7759900	Uh, yes, there is a topic that was discussed with Todd McFarlane
7760540	7766300	as if Spawn was going to be showing up in the new Mortal Kombat game.
7767660	7771340	He said that they have access to use Spawn if they want to.
7771340	7772300	It's up to them.
7772300	7776060	He gave them a window of time, so if they want to, it could happen.
7777420	7778140	So, we'll see.
7778140	7787740	In other news, Nintendo has happy, happy fun stuff going on with the 25th anniversary of Fire Emblem.
7787740	7790540	They're doing a symphony concert in Japan.
7790540	7797340	This is going to be taking place, uh, looking at Tokyo Dome City Hall between July 24th and 25th.
7798140	7801660	And, uh, someone give me a ticket so I can go.
7803340	7803840	Please.
7804300	7805420	I'm begging a little bit.
7805980	7809820	And then, last but not least, houses for, uh, card games.
7809820	7810940	Exploding Kittens!
7811660	7817180	Exploding Kittens, put out by the oatmeal, has broken all Kickstarter records.
7818460	7827180	They raised 8.78 million dollars with, uh, 219,382 backers.
7828540	7829020	So...
7829020	7829660	I'm one of them.
7831340	7834140	You get to have Exploding Kittens as a card game.
7834220	7836700	And the NSFW deck, which you know, like,
7836700	7841740	I think, seriously, like, 90% of the people who backed it opted for the NSFW deck.
7841740	7843020	Because we're all perverts.
7843660	7844540	You know what?
7844540	7845040	What?
7845500	7849500	The oatmeal has been behind another Kickstarter that I think actually was a little bit more,
7850780	7853820	I would say, important than Exploding Kittens.
7855100	7857980	There was the funding out for a Nikola Tesla museum.
7858940	7859580	Oh, I remember that.
7859580	7860860	IndieGoGo, yeah, I remember that.
7861580	7865580	Which actually, um, had a contribution by Elon Musk of Tesla Motors.
7866380	7867340	So, same.
7868700	7870940	But Exploding Kittens, Dark Soccer, it's...
7870940	7871260	Rob!
7872780	7873100	Fine!
7873100	7874860	Then when I get my deck, you can't play.
7876140	7876640	All right.
7877500	7880220	We're gonna get to the Fugu question of the week, but I just wanted to, uh,
7880220	7884300	I wanted to mention to Loki, you know, because we were joking about Miss Nude World 96.
7884300	7888060	Do you know what I just realized as I was walking to the kitchen and getting some water?
7888060	7889580	This is gonna be the 20th anniversary.
7889580	7892780	The 20th anniversary is next year.
7892780	7894460	I feel like we should celebrate.
7895900	7897340	Well, you know what that means.
7897340	7899420	Strippers in Miss New World 96.
7899420	7904140	Rob, the moment you said that, the line popped into my head from Resident Evil.
7904140	7906220	I feel like we're having a secret meeting.
7908380	7916300	It's gonna be one weird, one weird cam show on, uh, on, was it that PlayStation thing?
7916300	7918780	That's every week here at OLR is a secret meeting.
7919420	7922460	All right, let's get to the Fugu question of the week.
7930460	7931820	You guys know the drill by now.
7931820	7936780	You take Facebook, you take Google Plus, you slam it together, and you get Fugu.
7936780	7941340	And every week we ask a question of our, uh, Facebook and Google Plus communities,
7941340	7945020	uh, that we will check out the responses here.
7945020	7948620	Uh, I guess I could read them all tonight because, uh, very few of you responded over
7948620	7949420	on Google Plus.
7949420	7951260	Remember it was getting, it was like a tie last week.
7951260	7954860	It was like three and three, but this week Facebook decided to be kind to us and showed
7954860	7955740	the post to more people.
7955740	7960220	So we only got one answer on Google Plus to this question and it's about Killer Queen.
7960780	7965020	No, not the infamous Queen song, uh, although that is awesome too.
7965020	7967660	And I would sing it for you, but I've hit my quotient for the night.
7967660	7971100	However, it's the arcade game that Dark Soccer was talking about earlier.
7971100	7974540	Now this had us thinking about multiplayer arcade experiences.
7974620	7976780	This is a 10 player arcade game, right?
7976780	7979660	So many of you grew up in or around arcades.
7979660	7984300	What was an epic multiplayer experience that you remember from playing in the arcade?
7984300	7987500	This can be recent or this can be a long time ago.
7987500	7991500	You know, as an example, Dark Soccer, Loki and I, we all met playing DDR, which, you
7991500	7995420	know, wasn't necessarily a multiplayer game, but that was absolutely an experience.
7995420	7996940	But that usually led to other stuff.
7996940	8000860	Like I remember Dark Soccer and I one night going to town on the grid, which was like
8000860	8002700	around the corner from DDR.
8003660	8005020	Yeah, it looked like a fun game.
8005020	8005900	Yeah, we played that.
8005900	8009500	Anyway, so I was wondering if you guys had some like multiplayer experiences as well.
8009500	8010540	Sumo game.
8010540	8015420	The, oh God, that wasn't really a multiplayer game, but yeah, it was definitely a, we all
8015420	8017500	stood around it and went the fuck?
8017500	8020060	Well, you know what we had when I worked in an arcade?
8020060	8021020	Run and gun.
8021020	8022060	Oh yeah.
8022060	8023980	All right, let's get to some of the listener responses here.
8024700	8030060	Act Deft is our lone Google Plus reply tonight saying, I remember the Suzuka eight hours
8030140	8033740	machines with four bikes and a main screen in the middle so anyone could watch what every
8033740	8034780	player was watching.
8034780	8037900	I also remember the Super Street Fighter two tournament edition cabs.
8037900	8039580	Those were really cool.
8039580	8044300	Yeah, Street Fighter two in some ways really just like lit the multiplayer stuff, you know,
8044300	8045580	on fire in the arcades.
8045580	8049100	Like at least for my youth, that was such a huge part of it.
8049660	8053900	I don't think you can even have a conversation about multiplayer arcade games without mentioning
8053900	8054940	Street Fighter two.
8055900	8060940	Ragenator replies over on Facebook saying, for me it was playing Samurai Shodown 4, Amakusa's
8060940	8066060	Revenge on a four slot Neo Geo MVS at my former college's coffee house.
8066060	8069660	We had the same regulars playing that game constantly against each other and it was a
8069660	8070060	blast.
8070700	8075420	Andy R says, I remember when Blaze Blue first came out and Sunnyvale Golf Land was pretty
8075420	8077020	much the only place that had it.
8077020	8079820	My friends and I journeyed up there from school to play it.
8079820	8083260	It was about a three hour drive and after we had fun with the game, one of my friends
8083260	8086140	was joking about buying the arcade board for the game.
8086140	8089980	We would end up doing the trip again for DJ Max Technica, rest in peace.
8089980	8091260	Hey Andy R, you know what?
8091260	8095420	We hear you because we used to make that same trip to Sunnyvale Golf Land to play Beatmania
8095420	8096300	2DX.
8096300	8100300	So actually back in the day, we used to drive to Arcade Infinity.
8100300	8104300	That's about a six hour drive from Sacramento to go to LA and play all the, we would go
8104300	8106620	to Korea town to play the stuff there.
8107420	8109260	Oh, good times, good times.
8109260	8112460	This is like, I can't imagine road tripping for an arcade anymore these days.
8113580	8116300	Red The Haze replies and says, mine would be virtual on.
8117020	8120220	My friend and I tried it for the first time a few years ago and we got really hooked and
8120220	8124220	dropped more than $10, which was a lot for us poor college students back then.
8124220	8127740	Now I regret not picking up those twin sticks for the Dreamcast when I saw them at a local
8127740	8128700	game store.
8128700	8132700	Degenerate Johnny replies and says, back when I lived in Detroit as a kid, my friends and
8132700	8135660	I treated our local arcade comic book store as a second home.
8135660	8140140	We often finished multiplayer games in one sitting, X-Men, Simpsons, Ninja Turtles, so
8140140	8140540	on.
8140540	8144860	However, none stood out more than the summer day in 1994 when the arcade received its latest
8144860	8147980	game, Aliens vs. Predator from Capcom.
8147980	8148700	Hell yeah.
8148700	8152700	Once the owner plugged in the game, my friends and I were on it like shit on Velcro.
8153260	8157340	After hours of dumping quarters, we finally beat this intense four player beat-em-up.
8157340	8160220	It was a truly epic moment in our early gaming lives.
8160220	8164300	What made it more epic was that the game made us stay up till midnight, first time for me.
8164300	8168540	Punishment from our parents followed, of course, for this 10 year old, but was worth it.
8168540	8175340	Oh my God, you were 10 out in Detroit until midnight playing Aliens vs. Predator?
8177980	8179980	That's, that's, oh my God.
8181660	8182860	I would have spanked you.
8184620	8185100	All right.
8186220	8187580	And not in the sexy way.
8188140	8191980	SSJ100 Matt replies and says, Killer Queen is an amazing game.
8191980	8195340	It was at MAGFest this year and it was easily the most popular arcade game in the whole
8195340	8196060	weekend.
8196060	8199740	But anyway, I have a lot of memories as a kid playing Turtles in Time and the Simpsons
8199740	8201180	arcade game with friends.
8201180	8205420	Later on, I played a lot of the grid and gauntlet legends in my teenage years, especially with
8205420	8207900	the help of the saved profile functions in the game.
8208460	8213660	Our buddy Jonas, our explicit, replied and said, hmm, having a group of six people, myself
8213660	8218300	included, play the six player X-Men arcade game without dying during my time in the Philippines
8218300	8219260	as a kid.
8219260	8224060	Playing an eight player Virtua Racing in the Luxor Casino Las Vegas when they had it before
8224060	8229900	the release of Daytona Racing in 1994 and the Crazy Panic Park tournaments at California
8229900	8230780	Extreme.
8230780	8231420	Nuff said.
8232140	8233660	Last but not least, Dark Tetsuya.
8234380	8239740	I think the most epic multiplayer experience has got to be Namco's Galaxian 3.
8239740	8244860	Imagine six cockpit seats with a Vector Star Wars style flight controller, two giant 50
8244860	8247100	inch monitors and a giant booth to house it in.
8247100	8249900	I played it in Santa Cruz at the boardwalk back in the late 90s.
8249900	8251420	It was amazing.
8251980	8252860	Great answers, you guys.
8252860	8256460	Those answers took me back and reminded me of a lot of good stuff, too.
8256460	8259900	Like, again, random ass memories from when I was a kid.
8260620	8263420	I went to go play Mortal Kombat 2.
8263420	8268140	It was a convenience store that had Mortal Kombat 2, like a 7-Eleven type of place, more
8268140	8269500	like mom and pop owned.
8269500	8271660	We would go to this convenience store to play Mortal Kombat 2.
8271660	8273500	It was like the only place in town that had it.
8273500	8275420	Like the big arcades didn't even have it.
8275420	8276060	That was always fun.
8276060	8279260	Like having like a bunch of different stores around towns that would have each would have
8279260	8280220	like one arcade game.
8280620	8282380	We got to go play Captain Commando.
8282380	8284140	Let's go to this like cafe over here.
8284140	8284380	Right.
8284380	8285900	And that's just going to go play Street Fighter.
8285900	8291900	It's at 7-Eleven or we'd have like the one bowling alley that had the Mortal Kombat 2.
8291900	8292620	Yeah, it used to.
8292620	8294780	It's like slot machines in Vegas, right?
8294780	8296540	You would see you go to the grocery store.
8296540	8297820	Oh, there's a slot machine over there.
8297820	8301100	You know, wherever you go, there's going to be gas stations, slot machines, right?
8301660	8304780	It used to be like that with arcade games for a period of time in the 90s.
8304780	8306380	But now it's kind of like that, right?
8306380	8309580	When I moved out here, you know, right at the end of the 90s, right at the end there.
8309580	8312620	And Dan and I would just, we'd do what we called our arcade circuit.
8312620	8317580	We would go to Crest View Lanes because they had Air Guys.
8318220	8320780	They had Blazing Star.
8320780	8324220	Rest in peace, that ghetto ass bowling alley is still standing.
8324220	8326380	Even though it's been closed for like five years.
8327020	8327900	It makes me so sad.
8327900	8329500	I just want all those games to be mine.
8329500	8334300	I'm just waiting for them to get that land and make it a strip mall.
8334300	8335260	You know that's what's going to happen.
8335260	8337340	At least I can play Blazing Star on my iPad.
8337340	8337840	That's true.
8339740	8340860	Great answers, you guys.
8340860	8341420	Took me back.
8341420	8342220	I love it.
8342220	8344860	All right, let's go back to some long news.
8344860	8347420	We're having a long show tonight, but this is some good stuff tonight, guys.
8348300	8350540	But some more recent stuff that's going on in gaming.
8350540	8351180	Loki.
8351180	8351740	Yes.
8351740	8360060	So there's been a class action lawsuit against Nvidia for their new GeForce GTX 970 graphics
8360060	8360300	card.
8360300	8363580	Apparently it's due to false advertising.
8363580	8369420	And the reason being is that people have found that since it has four gigabytes of video
8369420	8374620	RAM on there, apparently when games allocate more than three and a half gigabytes of RAM,
8374620	8375900	it starts to slow down.
8375900	8382060	Apparently, according to the lawsuit, the last half of a gigabyte runs 80% slower than
8382060	8383100	it's supposed to.
8383100	8387500	And this is causing stuttering on high resolution games and whatnot.
8387500	8390220	So interesting.
8390940	8396940	I've been hearing, you know, just I always look into like, you know, possibly upgrading
8396940	8401100	my desktop computer at one time, which is in parts right now.
8401100	8410140	But, you know, I had GeForce, well, GTS 880s at one time, or not 880s, 8800s.
8410140	8415020	This is before they had just the three digit cards.
8415020	8423420	Anyways, also saying, though, that apparently Nvidia has acknowledged that the GTX 970 uses
8423420	8430380	a different memory subsystem designed than its higher end GTX 980, but said the difference
8430380	8431580	is negligible.
8431580	8436300	But apparently it was something that a lot of people felt otherwise.
8436300	8439660	So be interesting to see how how this ends up.
8441180	8441900	I don't know.
8441900	8446380	I think it kind of sucks, though, especially if, you know, these cards seem to come out
8446380	8450380	so often and they keep pushing near just how much they can do.
8450380	8454300	And, you know, I guess it makes for healthy competition.
8454300	8458140	I guess now ATA comes out with something that works a little better than people decide to
8458140	8459980	go that camp and why not?
8459980	8460380	I don't know.
8461420	8465820	Akuma JP in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says I'm using a GTX 970.
8465820	8466700	No problem here.
8466700	8467740	All ultra settings.
8468380	8471100	So maybe it just depends on what I mean.
8471100	8473660	That's that's the thing about building your own computer.
8473660	8476540	Your own computer is that everything has to get along in the box.
8476540	8477580	So you might have a serious problem.
8477580	8481420	Also, I'm wondering, too, because, like, I mean, I understand you're running all ultra
8481420	8485820	settings, but are you I don't know how much of the four gigabytes of video RAM seems like
8485820	8486700	an awful lot.
8486700	8492140	And I don't know if we're talking like, you know, 4K displays and stuff like that.
8492140	8493660	Is that what you're trying to output on this?
8493660	8499260	Because it seems like that most games would not use four gigabytes of video RAM.
8499260	8502780	I mean, at least I think that they wouldn't, but I don't know.
8502780	8503500	Maybe they would.
8504140	8505740	But I think the ultra ultra.
8505740	8510860	I'm thinking like, you know, this sounds to me like if you're running like ultra settings
8510860	8515020	on like multiple monitors or something like that, that it would run into the situation.
8515020	8516380	But I don't know.
8516380	8519900	Maybe it's in once again, you know, this is something that I guess will come out, you
8519900	8525340	know, if this lawsuit goes forward, that maybe it was just a batch of cards that was defective
8525340	8527980	or something like that and something that they fixed.
8527980	8528380	I don't know.
8528380	8529660	Hopefully they work it out.
8529660	8535740	We'll see how we always talk about these lawsuits and things like that.
8535740	8536380	It's crazy.
8537420	8540860	Rama says, fanboys in their Nvidia, Team AMD for life.
8541580	8545340	Bobby Blackwolf says, I'm going to be getting a GTX when the consumer rift comes out because
8545340	8548060	Nvidia works better with the Oculus stuff for whatever reason.
8548060	8549980	My current AMD has issues.
8550700	8551020	All right.
8551020	8552460	Anyhow, let's move on.
8552460	8554140	I want to talk about Yokai Watch.
8554140	8556380	You know, this series is huge in Japan, right?
8556380	8557100	Huge.
8557100	8559980	But it, for whatever reason, hasn't shown up in America.
8559980	8562940	And I think a lot of people are wondering, especially those that are a little more tuned
8562940	8567100	into what's going on in the Japanese culture and what's popular over there, wondering when
8567100	8569660	is Level 5 going to bring this over to the States?
8569660	8570780	Well, guess what?
8570780	8577100	Yokai Watch developer Level 5 has confirmed a deal to bring these 3DS games to an English
8577100	8577580	audience.
8578700	8584220	It's, you know, this series is kind of like Pokemon, but there's more to it than that.
8585100	8590700	Anyhow, merchandising and licensing and so forth, probably something that's going to
8590700	8591340	follow with this.
8592140	8597180	Hasbro actually has got that with Level 5, and they're going to launch these toys in
8597180	8598300	2016.
8599340	8602940	They're going full throttle here in the States.
8602940	8607100	Anime, comics, books, music, Monopoly boards, the games themselves.
8607100	8608940	It's all happening here in the States.
8608940	8612060	The Yokai Watch franchise has been hugely successful, and we are ready to bring the
8612060	8618220	brand to new markets across multiple platforms, said Akihiro Hino, who is the Level 5 president.
8618220	8619740	So here it is.
8620460	8626220	So not just the fact that it's coming Stateside, but it's coming Stateside with bells and whistles,
8626220	8630140	which that's kind of good because that tells me it's not going to be like a fringe game
8630140	8633900	because sometimes when Japanese games finally come out in the US, they're hard to find.
8633900	8634620	They're fringe.
8634620	8637100	It's like they have one run and then they're gone.
8637820	8638780	You don't find them again.
8638780	8643100	So they're putting all this licensing and freaking Hasbro is behind it too.
8643100	8645020	This game is not going to be hard to find.
8645020	8647740	They're expecting this to be a big, big thing.
8647740	8651500	Like a Yu-Gi-Oh or Naruto or something like that.
8651500	8652540	So that's good to know.
8652540	8653740	So here we go.
8653740	8654860	I already wanted it.
8654860	8660780	I would imagine E3 is going to be very telling for this, especially if I'm Nintendo and I
8660780	8663340	would get people really psyched about what's coming for the 3DS.
8664700	8668700	I think you can fully expect to see some of that in their Nintendo Direct at E3.
8669180	8670540	Anyway, Dark Sakura.
8671260	8673180	Well, things are getting serious in Australia.
8673980	8677340	What's going on right now is that there was a report out from Torrent Freak
8677980	8681740	that Australia is considering a three strikes copyright enforcement system.
8682860	8689340	Meaning that for anyone who participates in file sharing or infringing of copyright or
8689340	8694300	illegal sharing of different movies and music and things like that,
8694300	8697100	there is a three strikes copyright infringement rule.
8698780	8701180	They give them the three strikes and then take action.
8702460	8708860	So it's just a little blurb on here says this copyright notice scheme code is designed to
8708860	8714940	facilitate a cooperative industry led copyright notice scheme throughout which internet service
8714940	8719580	providers and the owners of copyright works will work to deter the practice of online
8719580	8721260	copyright infringement, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
8722620	8724940	Step one is an educational notice.
8724940	8726940	Step two is a warning notice.
8726940	8728540	Step three is a final notice.
8729340	8737900	And then each notice can be appealed with a cost of $25 Australian dollars.
8738620	8744860	And if the appeal is upheld, then the fee will be refunded, which I mean,
8744860	8749820	it kind of sounds fair right now, but this doesn't say what the actual
8751820	8754860	punishments that are going to be used against these people are.
8754860	8757740	So there's a little bit more about it on Torrent Freak.
8759500	8763740	The article is, let me see if I can get the link for folks.
8764300	8764540	Yeah.
8764540	8769340	It's just a big, long URL on Torrent Freak, but just look up Torrent Freak and Australian
8770540	8772220	ISP three strikes rule.
8774220	8777980	It's a very interesting bit of information.
8779820	8780140	I don't know.
8780140	8783340	Good luck enforcing it is kind of where my head's at.
8783340	8785020	That's sort of what I'm thinking on that one.
8785020	8787580	I'm not saying that stealing is okay.
8788220	8795340	If you're going to pirate things, then you have to realize that there are consequences,
8795340	8798300	be it these very tangible things that they're talking about here,
8798300	8802220	or just moral consequences in some ways of doing something like that.
8803100	8806780	We get into a lot of gray areas and so forth, but the fact of the matter is,
8806780	8809420	if you download a CD, you are stealing it.
8809420	8810460	Don't copy that floppy.
8810460	8810960	Right.
8811500	8815340	But it's going to be very interesting to see how something like this is universally
8815340	8820780	enforced without spying on people or what that comes out.
8820780	8824620	I mean, how are you going to enforce that uniformly?
8824620	8829100	Because that's another big thing is that you can't make an example out of one person.
8829100	8834700	And a lot of people who make laws probably also download CDs illegally,
8834700	8836060	or at least have a one point in their life.
8836780	8842140	I'm certain that there's very few people who are that morally upstanding that they haven't done it.
8842140	8842540	Right.
8842540	8844140	Well, also this is Australia.
8844140	8848300	So I want to say that I know there's some games over there that either don't come out
8848300	8850780	because of their stupid like R18 thing.
8850780	8853740	I think they finally fixed the rating system, but it's still like,
8853740	8854620	I just don't know.
8854620	8857660	Things have been censored for really random things in Australia.
8857660	8860540	You know, again, I don't live there.
8860540	8862460	Maybe we have some Australian listeners who can email us
8862460	8866060	and clue us in a little more as to what the situation is really like over there.
8866060	8870380	But I do remember distinctly when the new Mortal Kombat came out,
8870620	8873500	not Mortal Kombat X, obviously, but Mortal Kombat 9 or whatever.
8873500	8878220	Like one of my friends from Australia on Facebook posted a picture of like the disc saying,
8878220	8882220	thanks so and so for mailing me a copy of this because we can't get it here in Australia.
8883900	8885820	So because it was banned or whatever.
8885820	8887900	And I think we talked about it on the show years ago.
8887900	8891980	So, but I thought they had fixed a lot of those issues where now there is a rating,
8892540	8895340	but somehow stuff still gets kind of censored.
8895340	8895840	I don't know.
8896540	8899580	Anyway, we're about to the mailbag.
8899580	8900460	But first, Loki.
8901020	8901340	Yeah.
8901340	8905900	So there's a rumor that apparently the Phantom Dust developer,
8905900	8908140	Dark Side Games has shut down.
8908780	8911180	And this would be kind of disappointing because they were supposed to be,
8911180	8912860	you know, partnering with Microsoft for this.
8912860	8916300	But apparently, you know, according to a rumor, they're saying, you know,
8916300	8921900	that the development of Phantom Dust or that basically their relationship has now ended.
8921900	8925340	And, you know, they had a great respect for the studio and their work in the industry.
8925340	8929020	But while they do not have anything to share about Phantom Dust at this time,
8929020	8935180	we can confirm development of the title continues just without Dark Side, I guess.
8937500	8942060	So apparently they're saying that the 50 staff members have been
8943740	8946460	forced to close since they lost the Phantom Dust contract.
8948220	8949900	But the game is not done with.
8949900	8951420	I've never seen that as more on Twitter.
8951420	8955020	The game is still coming, but this doesn't bode well.
8955020	8958220	Because that means if they got the contract pulled, somebody wasn't happy with it.
8958860	8963660	Not necessarily they were right in that call, but it's strange.
8964620	8968380	Well, you know, I hate reporting on these layoff type of stories because, you know,
8969260	8973660	one guy in a boardroom somewhere, a girl or group of people made that decision.
8974220	8976860	And I don't know, it's always tough to hear about.
8977420	8981900	So hopefully those folks will be able to find positions elsewhere really soon.
8983580	8986860	Meanwhile, speaking of legal crap going on,
8986860	8989260	this is something that came out a little earlier in the week.
8989260	8995820	Do you guys remember when Bethesda was going after that game Scrolls that Mojang put out because
8995820	9000060	Bethesda had the name for like Elder Scrolls and so forth?
9000060	9004300	Now they ended up reaching an agreement, but some lawyers made a bunch of money off of that.
9004300	9008460	Well, get this, the developer behind the indie title Fortress
9008460	9014380	Fallout says that Bethesda's parent company Zenimax Media forced him to abandon the
9014380	9019260	trademark for the game because of infringement with, of course, the Fallout series, which
9019260	9023420	hasn't had a new game in a while, but perhaps something is being announced real soon.
9023420	9024140	I don't know.
9024140	9028060	But anyway, Zenimax asked in a letter that the creator, Jordan Marin,
9029340	9032140	who by the way goes by CaptainSparklez on YouTube,
9033260	9038700	immediately expressly abandoned the application for Fortress Fallout and cease any and all current
9038700	9042700	or proposed use of any mark incorporating the term Fallout.
9043580	9046780	And because, you know, again, this is just one guy.
9046780	9050380	He's just complying with it because of a lack of resources.
9051020	9056300	Our lawyers say that Bethesda is notoriously litigious company.
9056300	9059260	Obviously, they have lots of money and resources that they're disposable,
9059260	9061500	which me and my partner don't really have at the moment.
9061500	9064860	So essentially we are being strong armed and having to change our name,
9064860	9068300	which is unfortunate because I personally don't feel there's any confusion
9068300	9071500	between Fortress Fallout and the Fallout game franchise.
9072140	9074540	And certainly looking at the screenshots,
9074540	9078460	there's really nothing in common with this game and Fallout.
9078460	9081500	There's no game is not about nuclear fallout or anything like that.
9083340	9084780	So I don't know this kind of.
9086860	9087980	I mean, it's one of them.
9087980	9091820	I understand he would, if they had the money to fight it, he would probably win.
9091820	9095740	But at the same time, he doesn't get settled out of court, just like the scrolls thing did.
9095740	9097180	Yeah, that's probably what would happen.
9097180	9100540	And it's easy to point a finger and go stop being an asshole.
9101500	9103580	But also there's that whole element of,
9103580	9106620	well, if you don't protect a trademark, then you're at risk for losing it.
9106620	9110540	So on one hand, Bethesda has the responsibility to do something like this.
9110540	9111980	But then you kind of look at it and go,
9111980	9113420	who gave them a trademark on the name?
9114060	9120380	Just just Fallout for everything like star Fallout star for all games to begin with.
9120380	9123020	I mean, that's I don't know, especially, I think,
9123020	9125900	I think when it comes down to that, like you shouldn't be able to have like,
9126700	9129260	you know, I shouldn't be able to make a game called Fallout.
9129260	9133020	It's like, maybe do you remember it was we just had this discussion like a year ago
9133020	9135980	when it was Candy Crush Saga and the Banner Saga.
9135980	9137340	Like it was that whole thing again.
9137340	9138860	Everybody was looking at King going,
9138860	9142780	who the fuck gave them the patent or trademark, excuse me, on Saga?
9142780	9143900	Like, how did they?
9143900	9146060	It just needs to be a lot of reform.
9146060	9147980	Yeah, but it's not going to happen.
9148780	9152620	Of course, there's no duking it out with, you know, Square for Saga Frontier.
9152620	9153100	Right.
9153100	9155900	Well, this this just goes to show, you know, and Bobby
9155980	9158300	Black was in chat saying, well, the USPTO did.
9159260	9162700	Well, yes, we know how that happens, but it's kind of one of those things where it's like,
9162700	9166540	okay, maybe we really need to look at some of this trademark and intellectual property
9166540	9169900	in the way we do, because, you know, we haven't really modernized that very
9171260	9172380	for the Internet age.
9172380	9175900	And I think we're starting to see that kind of bite us in the ass a little more.
9175900	9176380	I don't know.
9179420	9184620	And Bobby Black Wolf pointing out Vanguard V was originally Vanguard Valkyrie until CCP
9184620	9187180	came along because of Eve Valkyrie.
9187180	9190540	But both were VR games that included space combat.
9190540	9191980	That's a little bit more similar.
9191980	9192860	That's a little.
9192860	9196300	At least you can kind of look at that and go, okay, kind of see that.
9196300	9200860	But, you know, when these games really don't have anything in common, it's unfortunate.
9200860	9201420	Unfortunate.
9203340	9205420	Anyhow, let's get to the mailbag.
9205420	9206860	You guys email us every week.
9206860	9209420	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
9209980	9213660	Dark Soccer is going to dive into the mailbag and find some emails she believes are worthy
9213660	9215180	of reading on the program tonight.
9215180	9215900	Dark Soccer.
9216860	9217900	Who's emailed us?
9217900	9219820	You were wrong, because we have three emails.
9219820	9220540	Three emails?
9220540	9221180	There's only one.
9221180	9221740	Three mail.
9221740	9223180	There was only one yesterday.
9223180	9224140	Three mail.
9224140	9225260	Three mails.
9225260	9225900	Tree mail.
9225900	9226620	It's like survivor.
9227500	9228780	Um, okay.
9229580	9231020	This comes from Robert M.
9231020	9231820	News item.
9231820	9234860	YouTube personality and Minecraft fan Jordan captains.
9234860	9235660	Oh, this is.
9235660	9237100	Oh, is this the story I just read?
9237100	9237340	It is.
9237340	9237820	Never mind.
9237820	9238380	How funny.
9239580	9241340	I will skip them past all of that.
9241340	9241580	Okay.
9242300	9246460	Regarding last week's FUGL topic, I'm surprised nobody mentioned Rocky's Boots.
9246460	9249900	I used to play with that at Science Center Lab all the time.
9249900	9253660	I also saw Cosmic Osmo there long before missed.
9253660	9254540	Still busy at work.
9254540	9258220	Should be able to take time to back up things on my PS3.
9258220	9261020	Cloud save and put in a repair ticket soon.
9261020	9261820	Trademark.
9261820	9262460	Quote fingers.
9263020	9263420	Period.
9265740	9266860	I mentioned Rocky's Boots.
9266860	9267580	I love that game.
9268300	9271580	If I didn't mention on last week's show, I certainly mentioned it in the past month at
9271580	9271900	some point.
9271900	9273100	I remember talking about it on the show.
9273100	9273980	I love that game.
9273980	9274480	Love it.
9275820	9276460	Next email.
9276460	9276960	Yep.
9277580	9279260	I was excited to hear.
9280540	9283580	Here is H-E-A-R, not H-E-R-E.
9283580	9285180	About last week's forum topic.
9285180	9287340	Classic Edutational Games.
9287340	9290300	Though I wish someone would have mentioned my favorite robot odyssey.
9290300	9294700	It was from around the same time as Oregon Trail and it was like a super advanced Rocky's
9294700	9295260	Boots.
9295260	9299180	The protagonist falls into robotropolis and has to find his way out.
9299180	9301900	You can go inside robots and inside computer chips.
9302860	9303820	Sorry, my neck.
9304460	9306140	Once any of these you...
9307100	9307580	Okay.
9307580	9311340	Once inside any of these, you design all the logic circuits that tell a robot how to move
9311340	9314380	around, how to use its sensors and pick things up, et cetera.
9315660	9319900	I was only about eight when I first tried to play it, but what I learned about logic
9319900	9322460	gates, flip flops, et cetera, stuck with me.
9322460	9324540	It's even available now via emulation.
9324620	9327420	Thanks for reminding me about this great game and keep lounging.
9327420	9328780	That's from Salmonax.
9330540	9332780	I vaguely remember that game.
9332780	9337980	I think that was another MECC game, I think, who made a lot of those.
9337980	9338300	What was it?
9338300	9341020	It was like Minnesota Entertainment.
9341020	9345260	I don't remember what it stood for, but I know MECC made a lot of those classic games
9345260	9349820	like Oregon Trail and Number Munchers and all those games and Rocky's Boots, I believe.
9349820	9351500	So I wonder if that was another one of their titles.
9352940	9353660	Sounds familiar.
9353660	9354220	Last email.
9354220	9355260	It's called Email Plus One.
9356540	9358780	In case you don't have any emails tonight, here's one for you.
9358780	9359180	Smile.
9359180	9359500	Cheers.
9359500	9359980	Andy R.
9361260	9362140	That's it?
9362140	9362940	That's it?
9362940	9363340	Yeah.
9363340	9363820	Cheers.
9364780	9365260	Here you go.
9365260	9365660	Well, thank you.
9365660	9366300	Thank you.
9366300	9370140	Thank you for just leaving a safety net in there just in case.
9370140	9373820	Luckily, we had a couple other emails in there to fill out the sack, but...
9373820	9374700	Very kind of you.
9374700	9375260	Very kind.
9375260	9375740	Yes.
9375740	9376140	Cheers.
9376940	9377580	You know what?
9377580	9378220	I love that.
9378220	9379340	Just getting an email.
9379340	9380220	Just wanted to say hey.
9381500	9382940	I just want to get an email that goes,
9382940	9383740	sup bitches.
9384940	9385820	And then I'll know you.
9385820	9389260	You do know that grandpa stole that and he uses that on Hoard House every week now.
9389260	9389660	Really?
9389660	9390300	Yeah.
9390300	9391580	He stole my sup bitches?
9391580	9392940	You should charge him a quarter.
9393500	9394700	You just have me on the show.
9396220	9396620	We can.
9396620	9397580	We should have you on the show.
9397580	9398460	I mean, Becky.
9398460	9401500	We just had a sill residency on Hoard House.
9401500	9402380	She did two weeks.
9402380	9403900	She did because she's been on vacation.
9403900	9407180	So she did two weeks on Hoard House and she was fabulous.
9407180	9409740	I mean, I mean, this, his Star Trek thing.
9410300	9411740	Oh, you want to go on a Star Trek show?
9411740	9415340	Because Becky and I have been like talking DS9 like over the past three weeks.
9415340	9418620	Oh, well, grandpa make it so.
9419660	9420220	Engage.
9420860	9421820	I wonder if he's still listening.
9421820	9422140	I don't know.
9422140	9425500	It was in chat earlier, but, uh, he might've left to go poop or something.
9425500	9425900	I don't know.
9425900	9426540	That's what he does.
9427100	9427500	All right.
9427500	9429900	Actually, we have things we need to work on, Rob.
9429900	9430380	Yeah.
9430380	9430620	All right.
9430620	9432140	We've sort of been throwing around.
9433100	9434380	Like poop on a doorstep.
9435500	9436780	That's it for the mailbag tonight, right?
9437340	9437580	Yeah.
9437580	9438060	Yeah.
9438060	9441260	Participate at orange lounge radio.com.
9441340	9442460	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
9458620	9467020	Um, FU goes to my muse for being, uh, rabid and making me want to work on my story all
9467020	9467500	the time.
9468300	9471900	But at the same time, thank you to all of the people who have given me valuable feedback
9471900	9473260	and make me feel like a rock star.
9473260	9474060	So thanks.
9476300	9482300	Uh, just FU, I guess, to lack of sleep I've been giving myself for the last two months.
9483180	9486220	Hopefully I'll catch up on sleep or maybe not.
9488220	9491900	Uh, my view of the week goes to my back cause it's been randomly hurting and you know what
9491900	9492540	I blame?
9492540	9498300	I think, I think I just need a new bed because I've had that bed since it's been a while.
9498300	9503020	The bed I have, I've had probably since like seven or eight years.
9503020	9504060	So I'm ready for a new bed.
9504620	9505260	Talk to me.
9505260	9510860	I have, um, Dan and I, when we bought ours, we did things a really smart way and I will
9510860	9511420	share it with you.
9511420	9511740	Okay.
9511740	9512300	Sounds good.
9512940	9515580	That's something we're in the market for soonish.
9515580	9518060	I think we, Alan and I talked about it anyway.
9518060	9520700	Cause uh, I will say a thank you.
9520700	9524780	As of this month, that brand new washer and dryer that we have out there in the garage,
9524780	9526860	those brand new front loaders paid off.
9527420	9528060	I own them.
9529260	9529980	Thumb.
9529980	9530700	Exactly.
9530700	9532140	Responsibility.
9532140	9533020	Congratulations.
9533020	9533820	You own a washer.
9533820	9534460	You're an adult.
9535580	9536460	I should get a star.
9536460	9539980	And here's your dryer and your washer and here's a fridge.
9540620	9541660	Happy adulthood.
9541660	9542700	Oh man.
9542700	9544540	Go on The Price is Right and win some new ones.
9544540	9545260	All right.
9545260	9547900	Uh, let's get to just a couple more stories for you guys.
9547900	9552620	And then we're going to get to the Skype line at one eight seven seven game OLR or our username
9552620	9554620	on Skype, orange lounge radio.
9554620	9558460	That's all one word, orange lounge radio, but first Loki.
9559100	9561500	So you may hear the words, I'm not dead yet.
9562140	9567020	And in reference to, um, the last guardian, but a lot of people still don't believe that.
9567020	9573900	But Sony is once again, confirm me that yes, even though we just failed to, we've abandoned
9573900	9575580	the trademark for the last guardian.
9575580	9576940	It's still in development.
9576940	9577820	We promise.
9577820	9580060	Swear it's still being made.
9580060	9584620	It's just the makers of the guardian legend sued us for trademark infringement.
9584620	9586620	So we had to abandon that trademark.
9587180	9589580	What if the game were to come back with a new name?
9589580	9590080	It might.
9591180	9596300	I mean, that's like something that I don't think anybody asked, like why?
9596300	9598460	Maybe somebody did, but I just didn't see it on Twitter or anything.
9598460	9603580	Like what if it's as simple as the game just has a new name for whatever creative reason?
9603580	9605100	Shadow of the Colossus 2.
9605100	9607100	It's, it's been in development this long.
9608620	9612060	Are you really going to care if they change the name into something else, you know, to
9612060	9612540	match the vision?
9612540	9616300	It would be pretty bad-ass if it was Shadow of the Colossus 2, where he rides around on
9616300	9621180	that other, you know, giant, you know, dog, dragon, griffin, whatever the fuck that thing
9621180	9623020	is, and like fights other.
9623020	9625580	I just would like to know, like, what's the fucking status?
9625580	9626300	That's all I wanted.
9626300	9627340	What's the fucking status of that game?
9627340	9630940	And if it's not Shadow of the Colossus 2, can I just get a Shadow of the Colossus 2?
9630940	9634460	Because I would be down with that as well, because imagine how big the Colossus, you
9634460	9638060	know, they could be so much bigger, and it'd be so much more epic.
9638060	9641180	And imagine taking down, you know, them with a group of people.
9641180	9644060	But then again, we're starting to get into Monster Hunter territory at that point.
9645340	9649580	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, the Last Guardian broke your heart, just like I said it would,
9649580	9650860	or just as I said it would.
9650860	9653900	The Last Guardian is really Frog Fractions 2.
9655900	9656860	I'm okay with that.
9656860	9658380	I, I'm totally okay with that.
9658380	9659820	I'm also, I see it also be okay.
9659820	9661580	What fucking happened to Frog Fractions 2?
9661580	9662140	Wasn't there like a giant Kickstarter?
9662140	9663260	No one's found it yet.
9664620	9667580	Doesn't, didn't he have to share it with Kickstarter backers or something?
9667580	9668540	Wasn't that part of the thing?
9668540	9669420	No, he hasn't.
9669420	9671020	It's just that no one's found it yet.
9671820	9676380	If you just say Frog Fractions on Twitter, the creator will like favorite your tweet.
9676380	9679980	Like I found this out, like every time I've said something about Frog Fractions, like
9679980	9681260	the creator favorites the tweet.
9681260	9684940	Like, you know, he's running tweet deck and he has like a Frog Fractions column or something
9684940	9686780	that every time somebody mentions that game.
9687340	9690220	So I just, I would, I, I hope it shows up soon.
9690220	9692060	I'll start mentioning it every day now.
9692060	9695660	No, but, uh, I would like to know what happened to Frog Fractions 2.
9695660	9697820	Maybe that could be the order 1886.
9699260	9703100	All of a sudden, you know, like 30 days in, we're going to get some frogs appearing.
9705980	9707980	It isn't just five hours long.
9707980	9709100	It's Frog Fractions.
9709100	9714860	Uh, Sega is clarifying in chat that no, only when the gig is up, apparently is, is the
9714860	9718300	thing is where the, the Kickstarter backers get it on that.
9718300	9718700	All right.
9718700	9723020	Anyhow, last but not least tonight, one more story for you guys.
9723020	9728460	And, um, I had to pick this one because what better note to end on tonight than something
9728460	9731180	completely self-referential.
9731180	9734460	After all, last week was President's Day.
9734460	9739260	After all, President's Day was on a Monday and you got to love games journalism sites.
9739260	9740140	God bless them.
9740140	9744700	They'll find anything remotely related to a video game to run a story and get some clicks.
9744940	9749420	But I am totally okay with this one because Destructoid ran an article on President's
9749420	9752940	Day called We Salute You, President Cat.
9752940	9758700	And it actually said, Sukiban Shacharina, also known as President Cat, was one of those games
9758700	9761340	destined to never leave Japan despite our pleas.
9761340	9764780	Back in 2009, Western fans petitioned for a localization.
9765420	9766140	Who could that be?
9767260	9771500	But this mini game collection about a CEO cat was perhaps ahead of its time.
9771500	9772940	It sold miserably.
9772940	9775740	No matter, our love for Rina is unwavering.
9775740	9776620	Just look at that face.
9776620	9777740	That was a whole article right there.
9777740	9778540	Poor Rina.
9778540	9782380	Sorry I just read the whole damn thing on air, but, you know, props to Destructoid.
9782380	9786860	Go give him a click for running that article because that just made me giggle because I
9786860	9788460	thought back to when we did that.
9789100	9794380	President Cat is not the literal translation of that name, right?
9794380	9796540	Sukiban is like a female delinquent.
9797340	9802620	Shacho is like a corporate leader, if I remember correctly, like a president of a company or
9802620	9803180	CEO.
9803180	9806300	So you have basically delinquent bitch in charge.
9807260	9808220	Rina.
9808220	9812620	And I don't think HBIC cat has that same ring to it.
9813180	9814940	The head bitch cat.
9814940	9817260	Although, I kind of like that now.
9818460	9819500	It's a different year.
9819500	9821340	2015, the atmosphere is different.
9821340	9823500	An unspayed female cat is called a queen.
9825100	9828380	So anyway, the point is, I'm loving it.
9828940	9834300	Essentially, Dark Soccer, you said, and you were the one who was like, so it's like President
9834300	9834620	Cat.
9834620	9836700	And then we all took the ball and ran with it.
9836700	9838700	We're like, President Cat, yes.
9838700	9839660	Vote President Cat.
9839660	9841900	Who wouldn't fucking play a game called President Cat?
9841900	9847980	And now, like, the accepted Western name of this game is President Cat.
9847980	9849420	Everyone, you're welcome.
9849420	9853660	I wonder if someone were to put out a game similar to that called President Cat if they
9853660	9855340	could be sued by that company.
9855340	9856700	Well, I think that company went under.
9857660	9867420	You know what, President Cat Bankrupt Company, we need to talk to you and Bobby and a few
9867420	9867980	people.
9867980	9869100	And Steve, get Steve back.
9869100	9870380	And we'll get Steve back.
9870380	9872300	Well, I still need a CEO for my game.
9872300	9875660	And it was going to be a dog CEO, but I can be swayed.
9875660	9878380	Akuma JP in chat says, but the game was horrible.
9878380	9883500	Now, wait a minute, because even if the game only sold 100 copies, which, by the way, I
9883500	9887500	want to see the receipts, because that story was ran on some website.
9887500	9889820	But where was the receipts to prove that?
9889820	9891260	Because I have a copy.
9891260	9895900	Considering we got people here in the States to import that game.
9895900	9897580	Loki bought that game.
9897580	9903420	Like, was OLR really responsible for, like, 10% of the sales of this game?
9903420	9905260	Because I kind of don't think that's the case.
9905260	9910220	Like, I'm not that stuck on myself with this program that I think we had that big of an
9910220	9910700	impact.
9911420	9917020	See, I think that we should do our own President Cat and have it just full of OLR in jokes
9917020	9918300	and just crazy shit.
9919020	9927180	But we would be remiss if we didn't have a nod to one of the greatest Sukeban characters
9927180	9930940	ever who used to beat people up with yo-yos.
9930940	9935260	But the point was, just to remind everybody, the game wasn't that bad.
9935900	9940620	It was a little silly, but you played a cat in minigames.
9940620	9945340	Like, the Incredible Crisis.
9945340	9947500	It was like an Incredible Crisis, but with a cat.
9947500	9948700	And it was funny.
9948700	9954060	And we played it, because Loki imported it, and we had a region-free Wii, and we checked
9954060	9954860	that out, and it was fun.
9954860	9957180	I need to region mod my Wii so I can play that game.
9957180	9958460	Yeah, it was a lot of fun.
9959340	9964540	And remember, the whole point behind that was, they were putting shit out on shelves.
9964940	9971580	You know, Barbie's jewel-collecting adventures, and shitty Flash game adapted for Wii Part
9971580	9972940	2 types of things.
9972940	9977500	There was so much shovelware on the Wii, I think the point behind that whole rant in
9977500	9983660	the first place was, why can't we get an awesome concept like this, with all this poo-poo
9983660	9987100	crap-crap that's out on the Wii, that in 2009, there was a lot of crap.
9987100	9990700	You can't tell me if that game came over here, that people wouldn't eat that up.
9991660	9993500	Because, people love cats.
9993500	9998300	People love cats doing anything, especially if it came out around the time, was it, that
9998300	10000460	was 2009, why couldn't, you know.
10001340	10005660	At least Destructoid's on our side, because that's not the first time they ran a President
10005660	10006380	Cat story.
10006380	10009340	I think they ran a President Cat story when it first happened, and I want to say President
10009340	10013580	Cat came up again on their site, when they were talking about, because like, remember
10013580	10013740	how-
10013740	10016220	It was Wii games that were kicked off, you know.
10016220	10020300	It was Operation Rainfall, what should they focus on next, type of thing, because you
10020300	10023100	know, everything that was on their wish list, they got, right?
10023100	10029180	Was Xenoblade, and not Last Guardian, you didn't get that last story, and Pandora's
10029180	10032700	Tower or whatever, so they got all those games, I think there was an article like, what should
10032700	10035900	they do now, and President Cat was one of those games.
10035900	10036700	So, anyway.
10038700	10039740	Just wanted to throw that out there.
10041100	10041660	Good times.
10042220	10043740	Let's do it, let's open the Skype line.
10043740	10048220	1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10048220	10052220	Don't be shy, if you want to get in, call now, because we're not going to have the opportunity
10052220	10056220	open very long, since it's already midnight on the East Coast, 9 o'clock here on the West
10056220	10057580	Coast, but we've had a good long show tonight.
10058220	10060940	I will go around the room and check if there's any last minute stories while we wait to see
10060940	10062460	if Skype lights up at all.
10062460	10062860	Loki?
10064700	10065020	Nope.
10065580	10066700	No last minute stories?
10066700	10070620	I don't have any unfortunately, and I was looking too, I was trying to find something.
10070620	10071580	We're trying?
10071580	10076060	Alright, that's okay, because we do have a call coming in, so let's get to our calls
10076060	10076540	tonight.
10076620	10078060	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
10078860	10079900	Hey, this is Akdeft.
10079900	10081340	Hey, Akdeft, what's on your mind, buddy?
10082460	10086300	Well, I have a lot of stuff on my mind, like President Cat.
10086300	10088460	Remember when Joystiq ran the article, too?
10088460	10089180	I do.
10089180	10090460	Wasn't that your fault?
10090460	10090700	Yeah.
10092700	10095100	Yeah, you emailed them the tip or something, right?
10095820	10101340	Yeah, I think I emailed them an article you wrote on the old OLR page.
10101340	10103500	Oh yeah, back when I actually had articles on that site.
10103500	10103900	Yeah, yeah.
10104620	10110380	Because I seem to recall our tweets, I mean, this is again, this is like six years ago
10110380	10115820	at this point, believe it or not, our tweets to the company were getting read, and they
10115820	10120940	started, they basically were doing the very Japanese humble equivalent of, what the fuck
10120940	10123980	is happening right now, type of thing on their Twitter.
10123980	10127900	And so I remember writing an article at Orange Lounge Radio about like, here's what's going
10127900	10129900	on and why we're all trying to get President Cat.
10129900	10130620	And they took our hashtag.
10131260	10132540	Yeah, they took our hashtag.
10133100	10134540	They called it President Cat.
10135340	10136940	So that was, I loved it.
10136940	10137500	I loved it.
10137500	10141740	So yeah, and then you went to Joystiq with that, and then I'm sure a ton of other sites
10141740	10142780	kind of copy paste from there.
10143740	10148220	In the 13 year history of this show, that's like the one thing that went viral.
10149580	10150220	Yeah.
10150220	10153340	That and something that got us a cease and desist from Namco, but we won't go there.
10155420	10162300	Oh, well, anyways, I wanted to talk about another thing coming up soon in a few weeks.
10163180	10171500	That I'm going to Mexico City, to what it's called the Distrito Pedal here, to the Zelda
10171500	10173740	Symphony of the Goddess concert.
10173740	10174140	Nice.
10174700	10176380	And I'm pretty excited about it.
10177580	10183260	Last year, they, well, not last year, like two years ago, but it wasn't, I think December,
10183260	10184940	so more or less.
10185900	10192940	Friends from over there from Mexico City went and they talk really good stuff about it.
10193660	10199420	And they pretty much told me, you have to come, you have to go and see the concert.
10199420	10204220	You have to listen and you have to pretty much live the experience.
10204220	10212380	So yeah, eventually I did promise them that if Zelda of the Goddess concert would return
10212380	10213820	to Mexico, I would go.
10214540	10219100	And yeah, the return, it's going to be in Monterrey also.
10219980	10223580	And in Mexico City, I'm going to, again, the Mexico City concert.
10223580	10232700	And yeah, again, I'm pretty excited to just go there and hear all the songs and pretty
10232700	10235740	much live the, sorry, live the experience.
10236860	10238540	I'm really excited for you.
10238540	10242300	I wish I was able to go see, it's going to be in San Jose, or I think I might have just
10242300	10242620	missed it.
10242620	10246540	Like it was just here and I wanted to go see it, but just, you know, there's so much other
10246540	10247180	stuff going on.
10247180	10248460	I don't always get out to everything.
10248460	10255340	So, but I'm excited to hear that you're going and to get a little wrap up here on the show
10255340	10255820	afterwards.
10256700	10257420	Yeah, definitely.
10257420	10265100	When, well, when I go to the concert, I will eventually, well, talk to you guys and probably
10265100	10267500	write an article for the Vlog Network.
10267500	10267820	Yeah.
10267820	10268540	It'd be awesome.
10268540	10271500	The return to, I love that song, hopefully.
10273100	10273660	Love it.
10273660	10278780	Hey, I got to ask while you're on the line, the Wii U had kind of a big release this week.
10278780	10280460	Surely you have something to say about it?
10281340	10282380	More or less, yeah.
10283660	10289660	Yeah, of course, if you know me and have listened to the show for many years, you know, I love
10289660	10293420	Kirby and yeah, I did get Kirby and the Rainbow Course.
10293420	10294140	And how is it?
10294780	10299820	It's not, well, I don't know how I can put it.
10299820	10300700	It's good.
10300700	10301100	Definitely.
10301100	10301740	It's good.
10301740	10303260	If you like Kirby, you'll love this.
10304300	10307660	If you like Canvas Course, you'll definitely love this also.
10308460	10315180	But I don't know how to put it yet because I have only played the first world.
10316140	10318860	Well, basically the first three levels and a boss.
10319820	10328780	So the game, I don't know if I can compare it to Canvas Course, but it's definitely the
10328780	10329500	same mechanic.
10330140	10332460	But it feels completely different.
10332460	10333980	Also, it's really weird.
10334860	10336620	I'm definitely loving it.
10337500	10341740	And I pretty much, yes, playing this on multiplayer.
10341740	10343900	multiplayer makes the experience way better.
10345180	10349740	Interesting that you hesitated there a little bit, though, because a lot of people on Twitter
10349740	10351260	are really eating this game up.
10351260	10352460	So I was really surprised.
10352460	10354540	I would have thought you'd be falling right in line with that.
10354540	10356940	But maybe you just have to give it a little more.
10356940	10358300	And you said you only played the first world.
10358300	10362220	So maybe it'll start to really hook you a little later on.
10362220	10366220	Yeah, I've been busy with other stuff and work.
10366220	10369340	And I haven't been able to play a lot of games.
10369340	10374860	I have my Doris Mask still wrapped in Spox and Monster Hunter 2.
10374860	10375820	I know how it goes.
10375820	10376700	I know how it goes.
10376700	10379580	So yeah, I barely made some time to play Kirby.
10379580	10381660	But again, it's good.
10383020	10386300	For the $40 you pay for the game, it's definitely great.
10387020	10390460	It's definitely something anyone should check out, at least.
10391980	10397180	But again, if you're looking for something like Canvas Course, it's kind of like that,
10397180	10399260	but not exactly like that.
10399260	10401100	So again, it's weird.
10401820	10402300	But yeah.
10402860	10403340	All right.
10403980	10406380	Well, I'm gonna let you go so we can get some more calls.
10406380	10407500	But thanks for the call.
10407500	10408460	Hey, thanks for having me.
10408460	10410300	And hope you have more time to play Kirby this week.
10411100	10411740	I'll try.
10411740	10412620	All right, take care, buddy.
10413420	10413980	Thanks.
10413980	10417500	All right, 1877 game OLR or username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
10417500	10419660	But the phone is lighting right back up.
10419660	10420780	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
10420780	10421180	Who's this?
10421740	10422220	Hey, what's up?
10422220	10422860	This is SkyJudo.
10422860	10423500	Hey, SkyJudo.
10423500	10424540	How you doing this week?
10424540	10425180	I'm all right, man.
10425180	10425420	How are you?
10425980	10426460	Not too bad.
10426460	10427100	What's on your mind?
10427660	10428140	Not much.
10428140	10431020	I just want to address what you were talking about earlier with the
10431020	10433580	why did people buy the new 3DS.
10433580	10434300	Sure.
10434300	10436940	I'm one of those people that got 3DS day one.
10437500	10441340	And the main reason why I got it is just for the simple fact of the upgrade.
10441340	10444540	It's an improved version over the last 3DS.
10445420	10451420	Me, I was one of the people that didn't really see much of a problem with the original 3DS.
10451420	10456140	Like, I didn't experience the 3D issues or any other type of stuff.
10457900	10462460	The only thing I noticed about the original 3DS was how slow some of the games started
10462460	10467740	to become later on when I got into Mario Golf and the new Smash Brothers.
10467740	10470700	I noticed those games took a really long time to load up.
10470700	10473820	Does the new 3DS really speed that up?
10475820	10481100	Yeah, well, some things that were laggy with the original are still laggy with the new
10481100	10482220	one, like Pokemon.
10482860	10486380	One of the issues that people have with Pokemon is when you did 3D battles, the game would
10486380	10488540	lag, and that's still there.
10488540	10493260	I don't know why that couldn't get cleaned up, but Smash Brothers loads pretty fast.
10493260	10495260	Mario Golf is super fast now.
10495260	10499900	You can get through tournaments and read your stats and all that stuff without waiting almost
10499900	10501740	two minutes just to get through the damn game.
10503740	10504060	I don't know.
10504060	10505580	Those are probably the only games that I tried out.
10506060	10506540	Interesting.
10506540	10509900	I actually didn't realize that the new 3DS, I mean, I knew that the chipset and everything
10509900	10510940	in there was more powerful.
10510940	10512060	Like, I knew that.
10512060	10516860	But my, I guess, assumption was that no game was really utilizing that yet.
10516860	10520380	And that was part of my hesitation, Kajudo, is that I'm sitting here going, well, there's
10520380	10524860	nothing out in America yet that you have to have the new chipset for.
10524860	10529340	So, and like Loki said, by the time they release Xenoblade here, they'll probably have a Xenoblade
10529340	10531740	3DS that'll sell out in five minutes, right?
10531740	10536300	So I'll wait for something like that since I'm not, like, I already have a Zelda 3DS
10536300	10540300	and me personally, I prefer that Triforce design way more to Majora's Mask.
10540300	10543900	But that's also because I'm more of a classic Zelda fan than I ever was in Majora's Mask,
10543900	10545340	although I want to give this new one a try.
10546140	10546780	But I digress.
10546780	10551820	I did not realize that it would have that big of an impact on the older games.
10553820	10558220	I think also people coming at it, it's almost like if you're getting a new system with the,
10558220	10562380	it's going to sound silly to say, but it's like you get a new system with the added buttons.
10562380	10566700	You have the new, whatever the hell that is, RZ, LZ, whatever the hell they're going to do later.
10566700	10571500	I mean, they have some functionality with the new, with the Smash Brothers game.
10572060	10576060	It's not that big of a deal, but you can use that button with Smash Brothers.
10576060	10578140	That's to set up your Amiibo.
10578140	10583260	And don't forget about the little nipple rubbing button on the side.
10583260	10584300	What do you think of that nipple?
10585980	10586940	That thing's a nipple, man.
10587820	10589180	It's a freaking nipple.
10589180	10591100	What do you think of the nipple on the 3DS?
10591100	10596300	It's so weird to make a YouTube video and hold my 3DS up to like my chest and just start rubbing.
10598860	10599100	Yeah.
10599100	10599820	Parvert.
10599820	10600060	Yeah.
10600060	10600540	Parvert.
10601180	10602460	That's what it is though.
10602460	10603980	Say how much I love my new 3DS.
10603980	10607020	But yeah, that's all that is.
10607020	10608220	But I mean, it works great.
10608220	10613900	And I mean, I'm not, I don't know what other games use it other than Monster Hunter,
10613900	10615340	but I play Monster Hunter.
10615660	10616860	Final Fantasy.
10616860	10618460	Final Fantasy Explorers use that.
10618460	10621900	And I only know that because Shane let me play his Japanese one and he had that.
10623340	10625740	But I'm assuming that game has to come out here.
10625740	10628780	I mean, it's Final Fantasy and Manhunt is well enough here.
10628780	10631820	So I just, I would assume that game has to come out here, but maybe it won't.
10631820	10632140	I don't know.
10632140	10633500	I'm waiting for E3.
10633500	10637260	But I'm wondering if the, I know it didn't sell well, but I think the Resident Evil
10637260	10638060	game uses it too.
10638060	10644380	I know they had a few like shooter type games or something that will use that nipple control.
10644380	10648300	But like I said, I played Monster Hunter, so that was another reason.
10648300	10651260	I never wanted to invest in that, whatever that thing was.
10651260	10653260	What was that stick thing they were talking about?
10653260	10654620	No, it was like the little extra.
10655580	10657020	Yeah, it took batteries, right?
10657020	10659740	That was like the main reason why I didn't want it was because I was like, wait a minute,
10659740	10661900	this thing takes AA batteries?
10661900	10663500	You got to put AA batteries in this thing?
10663500	10663900	Yeah, yeah.
10663900	10665180	And that's why I never bothered with it.
10665180	10666220	So yeah.
10666220	10670220	But yeah, so I mean, it's like I said, it's a big upgrade.
10670220	10674860	And plus, I think a lot of people were on the fence and buying the 3DS, you know, because
10674860	10677660	they were hearing, you know, that the 3D is not really that great.
10677660	10680700	And for some people, you know, they were saying it was like a disappointment.
10680700	10684540	So I think some people were on the fence and after those people heard the improvements,
10684540	10686060	they actually went out and bought it as well.
10686060	10687500	Because I mean, it was selling out everywhere.
10687500	10689100	I was surprised that I got one.
10689100	10694060	Actually, I had to go to Best Buy and get it that way because GameStop was completely
10694060	10694620	sold out.
10694620	10699500	That 3D, that 3D enhancement with the head tracking really does work really well, though.
10699500	10701580	I mean, that I mean, I'll give the system that.
10701580	10705500	For me, though, I just was like, I'm not going to drop that kind of money just for that.
10705500	10707020	That's what I saw as the biggest improvement.
10707020	10711900	And I was like, I don't really use 3D enough or rely on it enough to really do that.
10711900	10715100	But yeah, I mean, that gives me some things to think about.
10715100	10718140	I think ultimately, though, I mean, and I've said this in the very beginning, I'm going
10718140	10722700	to end up getting a new 3DS eventually, but I'm just waiting for that must have game that's
10722700	10724620	probably being announced at E3 this year.
10725340	10729180	Yeah, I'm just going to tell you before I hang up, one of the things that made me realize
10729180	10732540	how good the 3D is, and the 3D is not the biggest draw of this thing.
10732540	10737100	I don't want people thinking at all, if you're not in the 3D, then don't bother with the
10737100	10737420	system.
10737420	10739100	I mean, it goes beyond the 3D.
10739100	10742940	The 3D is not the biggest deal, but I just wanted to mention the 3D because I was playing
10742940	10745340	Smash Brothers, and I can't remember what the level was.
10745340	10751580	I'm playing one of these cartoon looking levels, and I'm starting swatting in front of my face
10751580	10754860	because I'm thinking there's flies flying in front of me like a little bug.
10754860	10758060	And that's actually coming off of something moving around in the game in the 3D.
10758060	10759180	That's how good the 3D was.
10759180	10760940	And I'm just like, wait a minute, that's not a bug.
10760940	10761980	That's actually in the game.
10763340	10765740	I thought it was like a little gnat or something flying around my screen.
10765740	10766460	I'm like, what the hell is that?
10768060	10769580	I mean, it literally pops up at you.
10769580	10776300	I think if you follow Adam Sessler a lot, when the 3DS first came out, they remember
10776300	10779740	how everyone was like, oh, this thing must have been made with angel blood or something
10779740	10782540	they were saying about it because it was so crisp and everything.
10782540	10783980	Yeah, I remember seeing it.
10783980	10788380	And then when it came out, Adam Sessler was saying, wait a minute, that's not the system
10788380	10791180	that we saw, that they showed us in the demo.
10791180	10791980	That's not the system.
10791980	10798140	I wonder if he saw the new 3DS and if he would say that this is closer to what they originally
10798140	10801740	saw because he went out and said, that's not the 3DS that we saw.
10801740	10804380	The one that they're selling in retail is not the 3DS that we saw.
10804380	10809100	I also remember that particular, I was there at E3 that year they first showed the 3DS.
10809100	10812700	And I remember just kind of being in awe when they actually were showing it to us.
10812700	10814860	And it was like, oh my God, it really does work.
10814860	10816700	The 3D on this thing really works.
10816700	10819180	Kind of seeing it for the first time was really kind of inspiring.
10819180	10821100	But yeah, I don't know.
10821100	10823020	Maybe they had a different tracking system there or whatever.
10823020	10827180	But I don't remember being really disappointed by the first 3DS model or whatever.
10827180	10830300	I was just more blown away by it's 3D without glasses.
10830300	10833500	And it was the first time we were really seeing that in mass.
10833500	10835980	Anyway, Kajuda, I got to let you go so we can try to squeeze in some more calls.
10835980	10837740	But I will leave you with this comment.
10837740	10842540	Bonds006 in our chat room over at live.vognore.com says they gave us a condom for the Wii and
10842540	10844060	now a nipple for the new 3DS.
10844620	10845100	There you go.
10845980	10846540	All right.
10846540	10847900	Have a good one, my friend.
10847900	10848300	You too.
10848300	10848540	All right.
10848540	10848780	Bye.
10849500	10852220	1877 game OLR username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
10852220	10855180	I can probably squeeze in one more call here, although we are running a little late.
10855180	10858460	And I know some of us have to work Monday morning as do some of you.
10858460	10860620	So I can't let things go on too much longer.
10861180	10864060	But I will try to squeeze in one more call if somebody wants to try and get in there.
10865260	10866140	I know it was lighting up.
10866140	10867020	We might have a few more.
10867020	10867820	Oh, there we go.
10867820	10868780	It's lighting up.
10868780	10870220	You got to wait for that delay sometimes.
10870220	10871420	Just a little bit of a delay.
10871420	10872380	Hi, Orange Launch Radio.
10872380	10872780	Who's this?
10873420	10873660	Hey.
10873660	10874700	Hey, it's Ronva.
10874700	10875100	Hey, buddy.
10875100	10875580	How you doing?
10876140	10876620	Not much.
10876620	10877740	Just chilling, relaxing.
10877740	10878780	You know how I do.
10878780	10879900	Yeah, that's good.
10879900	10882380	You've been watching the Oscars on the other television or something?
10883260	10884060	Actually, no.
10885020	10885660	Come on.
10885660	10887660	When OLR is on, my TV is off.
10887660	10889100	I respect that.
10889100	10889580	I do.
10889580	10891180	I see, obviously, it's inevitable.
10891180	10895500	Whenever we go up against something big, people are talking about it in chat and even on Twitter.
10895500	10897980	I'm trying to look at Twitter like, oh, what's going on in gaming?
10897980	10899340	But everybody's talking about the Oscars.
10899340	10903420	Apparently, I'm hearing however you might feel about Lady Gaga.
10903420	10906380	Apparently, she did some type of tribute to the Sound of Music on the Oscars, and they're
10906380	10908060	saying she killed it.
10909100	10911180	Some are saying they got goosebumps on how good it was.
10912220	10913820	As somebody who actually...
10913820	10914780	I don't mind her music at all.
10914780	10916540	I think she's a great, great pop artist.
10916540	10918140	The Sound of Music will be very strange.
10918140	10920300	Well, I'm dying to hear it.
10921100	10926220	Well, a friend of mine did take voice acting and singing lessons with her in a class years
10926220	10926700	ago.
10926860	10931900	Right now, on my Facebook, more people are talking more about how the Lego movie got
10931900	10936860	snubbed and the live performance of Everything is Awesome was phenomenal.
10936860	10937740	That's what I keep seeing.
10937740	10938300	Oh, that's cool.
10938860	10940460	We're taking Sarah actually there?
10940460	10942380	Oprah got a Lego Oscar.
10942380	10943580	I want one.
10943580	10944140	How was...
10944140	10945820	I want to know how new a Patrick Harris was.
10945820	10946940	Like, I don't usually...
10946940	10950460	You know, there's part of me that kind of doesn't really care about the Oscars, especially
10950460	10951900	when I haven't seen a one.
10951900	10954460	I don't think I've seen a single one of the nominated movies this year.
10954460	10956060	Was Interstellar nominated?
10956060	10956940	I have no idea.
10956940	10957820	See, that's where I'm at.
10957820	10960460	I'm like, if Interstellar was nominated, then I saw that one.
10960460	10962700	And if it wasn't nominated, I'm kind of surprised that it wasn't.
10962700	10965420	But anyway, I just think that's just how out of it I am these days.
10966380	10966780	Anyway.
10968300	10971980	So Rob, tell me, did you get The Cross of St. Olaf?
10975420	10978620	I saved my three Hail Betty Whites for missing the Oscars tonight.
10978620	10980300	Or I'm gonna lose my card.
10981500	10982140	Something like that.
10982380	10986300	Yeah, yes, I'm prepared.
10986300	10986940	Hail Betty White.
10986940	10987660	Hail Betty White.
10988620	10990780	Okay, two more things I want to touch on.
10990780	10991980	I'm gonna get the heck up on out of here.
10991980	10993980	Now, you talked about President Cat.
10993980	10999100	Now, I was one of those that shared this on social media back then.
10999100	11004540	And one of my friends, he ran the game room for Zenkai Con.
11004540	11008860	And he told me he got a copy of the game for the game room.
11009260	11012460	And I went to check the game from time to time.
11012460	11015500	Let's just say there were a lot of people waiting around to play this game.
11015500	11016140	Thank you.
11016700	11017420	Thank you.
11017420	11021660	See, and again, there's another copy that essentially OLR sold.
11021660	11024060	I mean, Rama sold it, but threw us, right?
11024060	11024540	No, no, no.
11024540	11025980	OLR sold it.
11025980	11027260	I just endorsed it.
11027260	11029580	So how did you tell me that that game only sold?
11031580	11035500	Did it sell 100 copies in America because of OLR?
11035500	11037340	I would maybe, although that's a lot.
11037340	11039420	I don't think we have 100 people that listen to this show.
11039420	11043260	But I would believe that maybe there's that.
11043260	11047820	But only 100 copies in Japan when we know all these people that I know bought them.
11048860	11050940	That's why I'm like, I want to see the receipts on this game.
11056940	11057580	That's great.
11057580	11059660	I'm so glad to hear that was a hit at anime cons.
11059660	11062060	In fact, I wish somebody would take it to more anime cons.
11062380	11067180	If there ever is, heaven forbid, a vogcon, like we need another fucking con.
11067180	11072140	But if there ever is a vogcon or whatever, then we'll have to have President Kat in the
11072140	11072940	game room.
11072940	11076940	Although, since pretty much we tell people, just go to Dragon Con because we're the most
11076940	11080300	vog host show up anyway, maybe we'll just have President Kat up in the hotel room.
11080300	11080620	I don't know.
11081340	11081900	Fair enough.
11084060	11089020	And you were talking about the Fugu question week about multiplayer in the arcade.
11089020	11091420	Now, it wasn't in the arcade.
11091500	11093100	This was at home.
11093100	11098140	Years ago, I lived with some friends and my friend's older brother used to work the night
11098140	11099820	shift at this ice rink.
11099820	11104380	So he started taking the N64 down because there's nothing else to do on night shift,
11104380	11104700	you know?
11104700	11105980	So everything's already locked down.
11106860	11111900	So I got wind of them, they were playing Conqueror's Bash Fur Day.
11111900	11113500	I'm like, what?
11113500	11114940	Is everyone taking turns playing?
11114940	11115580	I'm like, oh, wait.
11117100	11118460	Multiplayer.
11118460	11125180	So we had a tradition of going down to the ice rink two, three times a week.
11125740	11133420	We would sit there around N64, 20 inch big screen at night, and just sit there and just
11133420	11136220	multiplayer the hell out of each other on every level.
11136220	11139500	Now, it would be me and my friend's oldest brother.
11140940	11143740	We were pretentious assholes for sniping.
11143740	11147900	So we would snipe everyone and then eventually, whatever levels it is where you could just
11147900	11152300	snipe, we would just find a bunker and just sit there and just try to snipe each other
11152300	11157180	from either side of the stage, not paying attention to his two other brothers trying
11157180	11158620	to kill us and each other.
11163100	11167660	We'd sit there talking like we're old buddies in Vietnam and stuff like that.
11167660	11170940	It was just ridiculous, but it was just a fun and just amazing.
11171980	11173180	You have the best stories.
11173180	11174780	I always think I have good memories.
11175180	11177340	Then it's some fricking con.
11177340	11178860	You create more memories.
11178860	11179740	I hope you keep a book.
11180460	11182540	Look, Rob, let me tell you something.
11182540	11185180	You mentioned earlier that your memory is bad.
11185180	11186540	My memory is bad, too.
11186540	11189420	At least you have somebody to remind you.
11190220	11195820	I have someone who reminds me I have a bad memory and not telling me what I need to remember.
11198460	11199420	I am lucky.
11199420	11202300	Well, I do have Jamie for that, but I am lucky to have Alan.
11202300	11202860	What can I say?
11203580	11203980	All right.
11203980	11205500	Oh, sappy, sappy, gross.
11205500	11205820	All right.
11206700	11207980	Anyway, I'm going to go ahead and let you go.
11207980	11208700	OK, my friend?
11209260	11209580	All right.
11209580	11210300	Take care, bro.
11210300	11210700	Take care.
11210700	11211980	I'm going to miss you at PAX East.
11213020	11215100	Well, we'll see.
11215100	11215500	All right.
11215500	11216220	Take care.
11216220	11216540	All right.
11216540	11217020	Bye.
11217020	11217520	Bye.
11218140	11220780	Ramo will find a way, even though all those tickets are long gone.
11220780	11221580	He'll find a way.
11221580	11223260	He'll be like, there's some forum.
11223260	11226060	I knew a guy who knew a guy had PAX East tickets.
11226060	11226860	All right.
11226860	11228380	That is going to do it for Skype calls tonight.
11228380	11231340	I'm so sorry, but just due to time, we are running really long this week.
11232300	11235980	Having Steve here took up a little bit of a chunk of time in the beginning of the show,
11235980	11239180	although we love talking to him and wish Flom the best of success.
11239900	11242460	But that is it for the main part of the show tonight.
11242460	11243580	It's time to wrap things up.
11243580	11247500	I want to thank everybody for tuning in and listening to another episode of OLR.
11247500	11249740	Your support means so much, you guys.
11249740	11254380	The fact that many of you here live would choose to listen to us over the Oscars,
11254380	11256060	that really does mean an awful lot.
11256060	11259260	And even if you did end up watching the Oscars this week and you just happen to be listening
11259340	11263180	to us on the podcast feed, hey, you made it through a nearly three and a half hour show
11264540	11267100	while you were at work on your commute or what have you.
11267100	11271180	And I thank you for spending time during your week with us.
11271740	11273100	And we want to hear from more of you.
11273100	11274780	So please tweet at us at OLR.
11276060	11279900	Send us a Facebook message on Facebook or whatever people do.
11280700	11281740	Send us a Snapchat.
11282620	11283820	Just keep it clean.
11283820	11285660	No, tweet at us.
11285740	11286220	Email us.
11286220	11289180	Participate at orangeontrady.com or post on our forums.
11289180	11290460	Just let us know you're out there.
11290460	11293820	Even if you're like the guy who emailed us tonight that was like, hey, I just want to say hey.
11293820	11295100	What's up?
11295100	11295600	What's up?
11298220	11301020	And now my response will be not much ASL.
11303980	11307500	All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight,
11307500	11310300	because it is time to wrap up the show and get on out of here.
11310300	11314140	If you did enjoy Orange on Trady though, please remember, tell a friend or five about the show.
11314140	11314700	Spread the word.
11314700	11316700	It is the show where every gamer has a voice,
11316700	11319500	but we can't spread those voices if they're not out there to share them.
11319500	11325180	So please bring more awesome people into this little family we have here at VOG Network and OLR.
11326220	11329500	We will be back in seven days time Sunday to do all over again,
11329500	11333260	but then that show's got to last for two weeks because we will be off for PAX East.
11333260	11336860	But again, if you are going to be in Boston, A, protect me from the snow.
11337420	11340140	B, please introduce yourself and come say hello.
11340140	11341740	I can't wait to meet people over at PAX East.
11342300	11344220	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.
11344300	11345580	Loki, you look ready to go.
11345580	11347340	What's on your mind for your final thought tonight?
11347340	11348380	I gotta work more on my game.
11349260	11350220	I can't wait to play it.
11350220	11351740	And apparently someone doesn't like my music.
11352300	11353660	Don't read the comments.
11353660	11354380	Don't read the comments.
11355420	11356620	What'd you post to YouTube about it?
11356620	11363100	Oh, I've posted several YouTubes about the game, but the music is trash.
11363100	11365820	I'm like, it's kind of that way.
11365820	11366540	Don't read comments.
11366540	11367500	Well, no, no, no, no, no.
11367500	11369660	The thing is, it's on purpose.
11369660	11370300	It's on purpose.
11370300	11372700	Like a lot of the whole point of that song is supposed to be kind of-
11372700	11373820	The artist's vision.
11373900	11377580	It's supposed to be kind of annoying because it's all the things that are wrong with games.
11377580	11379500	But at the same time, I really do like that song.
11380620	11381500	And it's free.
11381500	11385020	That's really the main reason why it's in the game because it's free.
11386300	11389900	My final thought tonight is I want to thank Steve for being here tonight.
11389900	11391740	And even though he had to leave early, I understand.
11392380	11396380	And I want to just thank all you guys again for listening and being a part of the show.
11396380	11397500	You guys make my Sunday nights.
11397500	11402780	And I was talking to somebody again over the weekend about giving up your Sunday nights
11402780	11403900	every single week.
11403900	11407100	And I don't know if I really see it as giving it up.
11407100	11410380	It's just, this is how we all get to hang once a week.
11412380	11412940	We get up.
11414140	11415260	We get up to get down.
11415980	11416780	That's my final thought.
11416780	11418220	Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight.
11418220	11420140	I'm going to have pie and none of you can stop me.
11420780	11421500	I want pie.
11422300	11423260	No, you have to go get Alan.
11423260	11424780	You do have to go get Alan.
11424780	11425260	Maybe I can convince-
11425260	11426780	So I said I brought you taquitos.
11426780	11427820	You did bring me taquitos.
11427820	11429500	Maybe I can convince Alan to go get pie.
11430140	11431340	I offered lucky food.
11431660	11434540	Well, I had just eaten like a bunch of pizzas.
11435740	11438220	And then later I got hungry, so I had Chinese.
11438220	11439900	Akuma JP wants to see your work, Loki.
11439900	11441420	You got to put that in her chat room.
11441420	11445420	Well, just if you go to YouTube, Loki OLR is my username on there.
11445420	11447020	Or you just go look at my Twitter.
11447020	11447900	I post videos on it.
11447900	11449020	I don't have like a-
11449020	11449820	I was gonna-
11449820	11456460	I had a video that I was set to upload Saturday, but it just didn't happen because it's too
11456460	11458300	high quality apparently for YouTube.
11458300	11459500	It couldn't encode it.
11459500	11463900	So I'm gonna record it this time as an MP4 instead of an uncompressed-
11463900	11469020	This is me sitting here who's been owed those great, great creators their proper
11469020	11470700	playthrough videos for like a month now.
11470700	11471180	So I can't-
11471180	11476220	And I even tried using the software to convert it to a format that YouTube could use, but
11476220	11478380	the framerate just wasn't good enough for me.
11478380	11479900	So I'm gonna do it again.
11480620	11483260	It's fine because I gotta add some stuff to the game anyways.
11483260	11484060	It continues.
11484060	11486380	Anyway, we're out of here for the night.
11486380	11487260	We got to get pie.
11488220	11489580	Man, I want pie.
11490780	11492460	That's the thought I'm leaving you with tonight.
11492460	11492960	Pie.
11493580	11494460	It's delicious.
11494460	11495100	Good night everybody.
