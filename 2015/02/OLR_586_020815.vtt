This week, after AOL's closure of various blogs, some have turned to crowdfunding in

00:17.240 --> 00:20.820
order to continue the coverage their readers enjoyed and found success in doing so.

00:20.820 --> 00:23.680
The resurgence of fan favorites occurs big and small in this week's news, and we'll

00:23.680 --> 00:30.680
tell you all about it right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:30.680 --> 00:34.880
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.880 --> 00:42.240
where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this February 8, 2015

00:42.240 --> 00:48.560
with the 586th episode of our show. Here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and

00:48.560 --> 00:53.360
the gamer lifestyle are myself, Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Skie on Twitter and

00:53.360 --> 00:58.440
in the intro there, and joining me on this 3 hour tour are my lovely co-hosts, say hello

00:58.440 --> 01:05.240
to DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers. Hi. Hi, how are you, Ms. Jamie Summers? Meat. Meat. Are

01:05.240 --> 01:10.760
you going to give me one word answers all night long? Maybe. What kind of meat are we

01:10.760 --> 01:15.460
talking about? We're talking about like meat on a pizza, meat in a salad, meat... I had

01:15.460 --> 01:22.720
chopped up hamburger, and then a bratwurst, half a bratwurst, all covered in cheese, and

01:22.760 --> 01:28.400
it was gloriously greasy, and delicious. That sounds like an epic fart waiting to happen.

01:28.400 --> 01:39.400
I'm a lady. I just belch. Also, yeah. Alright, also joining us, say yeah to Techmaster Loki.

01:39.400 --> 01:45.280
Yeah. Yeah. How are you doing, Loki? I'm doing fine. Yeah, you seem very chipper. It's because

01:45.280 --> 01:48.960
of that sandwich you ate. You went to your favorite sandwich shop again. Yes. You're

01:49.000 --> 01:53.360
doing that thing I talked about last week where you find that new food you love. Really,

01:53.360 --> 02:00.400
I just wanted to try the meatball sub, and it was so worth it. But yes. Yes. But mainly,

02:00.400 --> 02:05.880
I was just excited because, and I'll get into this later when I get into my game week, because

02:05.880 --> 02:13.160
I have rank bacon. That's right, rank bacon. Oh, look at you. You've really got a... Wow,

02:13.160 --> 02:19.960
your game is really coming along. Okay. Fuck stars, or whatever other trophies you want.

02:19.960 --> 02:23.820
That's right. That's spinning bacon right there. Okay, so you have spinning bacon instead

02:23.820 --> 02:28.840
of stars for your racing game on how you ranked in a particular level. Yes. Wow, your game

02:28.840 --> 02:35.320
is looking pretty rad, I gotta say. Alright, look at you. Anyways. When are we gonna get

02:35.320 --> 02:40.040
a demo? When do I get to play it? When do I get to play it? Soon. I'm just working on

02:40.040 --> 02:45.600
finishing the finish sequencing where it shows, there's a whole, I gotta show you during break

02:45.600 --> 02:50.320
and stuff, there's a whole explosion and stuff like that. And it actually does calculate

02:50.320 --> 02:54.320
your time now and compares it to a record time and eventually a world record time, which

02:54.320 --> 02:59.320
will be the online leaderboards. Online leader? What the hell? You're making like a full-fledged

02:59.320 --> 03:08.320
PS4 game over here. This is crazy. Yes, but I have to think, was it one of, well the person

03:08.320 --> 03:13.400
I'm using the assets from, you know, Raccoon Media, they're the ones that do all the low

03:13.400 --> 03:18.360
poly track stuff that I've been using. I put it out on Twitter, I was like, I gotta find,

03:18.360 --> 03:25.360
you know, bacon that's low poly that kind of looks like this guy's stuff. And then he's

03:25.360 --> 03:29.600
like, you mean like this? And he whipped something together real quick. I'm like, that's so awesome.

03:29.600 --> 03:35.400
So yeah. Wait, so these guys Raccoon Media, you said? Yeah, Raccoon. They make stuff and

03:35.400 --> 03:38.760
you're allowed to just take it? They make all the art and you take it for your game?

03:38.760 --> 03:45.120
No, they make art assets. He sells stuff on the asset store. And so he's got like a, you

03:45.120 --> 03:49.440
know, one set of assets on the asset store. He also releases a lot of stuff for free.

03:49.440 --> 03:54.360
He kind of started off of, there's this guy, Kenny, Assets Jesus, as you know, they like

03:54.360 --> 04:00.600
to call him. He does a bunch of, you know, free assets that are out there for people

04:00.600 --> 04:06.360
to use. And his is all CC zero. See, I forgot, I haven't used Unity enough still cause you

04:06.360 --> 04:10.920
know, my game is never moving along here cause I get distracted with all this other stuff.

04:10.920 --> 04:15.480
But I forgot that there's that asset store within Unity. So it's kind of like you have

04:15.480 --> 04:19.000
like a, for lack of a better term, iTunes or Google play within Unity where you can

04:19.000 --> 04:22.400
buy these things that you use in your game. Or even free stuff. There's free stuff out

04:22.400 --> 04:27.520
there too. But like I went ahead, I support him because I purchased his set, but he also

04:27.520 --> 04:31.560
has like a bunch of other ones, like five other ones that are free currently. And he

04:31.560 --> 04:33.040
keeps releasing more stuff for him.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.400
You basically got frequent customer bacon.

04:35.400 --> 04:41.640
Exactly. It's awesome. But I was literally putting something, so I've made my own stuff

04:41.640 --> 04:46.480
for my, I've made my own stuff for my game in the same style as his and it actually looks

04:46.480 --> 04:52.920
pretty cool. But, um, you know, I was actually starting to make bacon. It just kind of, it

04:52.920 --> 04:57.440
is similar, but his looks so much better than what I was putting together and it was just

04:57.440 --> 04:59.840
awesome. So he just knows how to build a better bacon.

04:59.840 --> 05:04.960
He just, he's just better at Blender. See, cause I, I tried to learn Blender. I watched

05:04.960 --> 05:09.000
videos on how to learn Blender. I actually did 3D Studio Max for a while and went through

05:09.000 --> 05:13.920
like a whole online course on that stuff. And I had it down a little bit, but then my

05:13.920 --> 05:18.000
computer crashed and so I lost 3D Studio Max. But I tried going back in the Blender again

05:18.000 --> 05:23.960
and I just, I get lost. I don't know. I just, it's one of those things right now. I'm, I'm

05:24.000 --> 05:29.320
going the, I'm, I'm kind of going through the steps like I did before where I try to

05:29.320 --> 05:33.360
find a way around what I want to do, but really I ended up having to go back and actually

05:33.360 --> 05:37.800
learn how to do it the correct way. So now I'm still in that work around phase where

05:37.800 --> 05:44.120
I'm doing everything in SketchUp, which is Google's free program. And, um, it works well

05:44.120 --> 05:48.680
for me, especially for low poly stuff. Cause it's just, you know, I know how many inches

05:48.680 --> 05:54.620
each one of those cubes are in their space and then I can make, um, stuff that's to scale

05:54.620 --> 05:59.560
for that and it works out perfect. But, uh, yeah, it's so much easier when you have someone,

05:59.560 --> 06:04.000
you know, designing something that looks pretty awesome. So, uh, but yeah, he should be, he's

06:04.000 --> 06:08.240
supposed to be releasing, just told me, uh, over Twitter that he's releasing his car assets

06:08.240 --> 06:12.280
pack and his city pack soon, which I've been looking forward to cause it's pretty awesome

06:12.280 --> 06:16.360
looking. But yeah, so check it out. Glad to hear things are moving along with your game.

06:16.360 --> 06:19.920
Uh, I want to introduce our chat room because we always have the live chatters here with

06:19.920 --> 06:23.920
our program. Uh, we are the show where every gamer has a voice and you can lend your voice

06:23.920 --> 06:28.160
alive at Sunday nights at the voice of geeks network of vog network.com because that is

06:28.160 --> 06:31.440
where we tape the show at the voice geeks network every Sunday night at six o'clock

06:31.440 --> 06:35.200
Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. And if you are listening

06:35.200 --> 06:40.320
live, we have a chat room at live dot vog network.com. Uh, and Bobby Black Wolf says,

06:40.320 --> 06:45.960
I want to have the hashtag vog jam to start before Loki finishes his hashtag vog jam one

06:45.960 --> 06:51.080
game. And then maybe I already started a new it's vog jam belated. So it makes a little

06:51.080 --> 06:55.480
dig at me saying, when do you get to play any of the vog jam games? Yeah. See, here's

06:55.480 --> 06:59.600
the thing I, and I, I'm still holding to it. I will not participate. I will not endorse,

06:59.600 --> 07:04.480
participate, uh, rally up a second jam until I completely finished the first one. And yeah,

07:04.480 --> 07:08.480
it may take a while, but, uh, I've got a lot, you know, some of you guys that know me outside

07:08.480 --> 07:11.060
shows, I got a lot going on in my personal life right now, especially with my day job

07:11.060 --> 07:15.520
and some things happening there. So it's just kind of push some things back. Sadly, I'm

07:15.520 --> 07:19.600
not always, I know this is going to sound horrible, but I'm not always like in the mood

07:19.600 --> 07:23.480
to do a peppy YouTube when I get home from work. I'm with, I'm with you there cause like

07:23.480 --> 07:27.880
I was going to work on the game last night and instead I got distracted by, what was

07:27.880 --> 07:34.240
it that, um, the what's wrong with blah, blah, blah movies or whatever. I watched like about,

07:34.240 --> 07:38.080
I don't know, a dozen of those and they're about like 20 minutes long each. I was like,

07:38.080 --> 07:43.240
Oh damn, it's like mid 1230 at night and I've done nothing. I'm so tired. And I want

07:43.240 --> 07:47.000
to make sure your games get me in a good mood cause you guys' games deserve that. And I'm

07:47.000 --> 07:50.280
in a good mood now. I had a great day yesterday and I'll talk about that a little while during

07:50.280 --> 07:54.600
our gaming weeks and so on. But I want to get into tonight's show and some of the video

07:54.600 --> 07:58.080
gaming news that's going on out there in the world. Um, let's start off with tonight's

07:58.080 --> 08:02.840
kickoff topic and tonight's kickoff topic is something that really everybody's been

08:02.840 --> 08:08.000
talking about out there on Twitter and Facebook and all the social media. This story is spread

08:08.000 --> 08:13.120
like wildfire, which is interesting because the story is a big fat rumor. But when the

08:13.120 --> 08:18.480
rumor is reported by the wall street journal, well, it's not like this is something coming

08:18.480 --> 08:24.160
from a gaming blog we've never heard of or something trashy filthy like Perez Hilton

08:24.160 --> 08:28.600
or TMZ or something, which are both Hollywood sites, but still, uh, this is still coming

08:28.600 --> 08:31.600
from the wall street journal, which is something a little bit bigger. And they have a run a

08:31.600 --> 08:36.760
report where the legend of Zelda, only one of the most popular video game series of all

08:36.800 --> 08:45.080
time, uh, is in the works to become a television show at Netflix, which I I'm sure a lot of

08:45.080 --> 08:48.960
you have had to process that information at some point this week. If you haven't until

08:48.960 --> 08:54.440
now take a minute to kind of go, wow, I, um, I would have never guessed that that was going

08:54.440 --> 08:59.440
to be a pairing that happened. Um, so the video streaming service right now, they are

08:59.440 --> 09:03.280
in early stages, whatever that means. I don't know if that's, you know, they're putting

09:03.280 --> 09:07.520
together a pilot, a pitch, who knows what that is, uh, of developing this live action

09:07.520 --> 09:13.360
series that will be based on the legend of Zelda. Uh, they're describing it as a game

09:13.360 --> 09:20.200
of Thrones for a family audience. So they're looking for writers right now to work on this

09:20.200 --> 09:27.440
show, uh, which will be set in Hyrule as assumably. Um, I, the report says that Zelda's about

09:27.440 --> 09:32.680
a boy named link who has to rescue press princess Zelda. I think that is actually a leap to

09:32.680 --> 09:36.960
assume that the show would even necessarily have link and Zelda in it. Hear me out here

09:36.960 --> 09:43.620
for a minute. Um, but anyhow, moving on with the story. Um, these, uh, Zelda games of course

09:43.620 --> 09:47.640
have the sword and sorcery like something like game of Thrones, like Lord of the rings.

09:47.640 --> 09:51.960
Uh, but this could be something that they could gear towards the whole family. Uh, Netflix

09:51.960 --> 09:57.460
reportedly is working closely with Nintendo. Um, and of course, legend of Zelda originally

09:57.460 --> 10:02.620
premiered in 1987, but we all know there was the animated Zelda that ran on Fridays

10:02.620 --> 10:07.180
during the Super Mario Brothers Super Show. We all know about the 93 Nintendo Super Mario

10:07.180 --> 10:12.200
Brothers movie, which has made Nintendo very wary to work with anybody else. Uh, so we

10:12.200 --> 10:15.280
don't know what's going on with this because of course Netflix isn't confirming it and

10:15.280 --> 10:21.900
Nintendo will not comment on rumors or speculation. So for all we know, this could be something

10:21.900 --> 10:28.900
where Netflix wants to do this and is readying the pitch for Nintendo, but isn't even there

10:28.900 --> 10:33.940
yet. I mean, we just don't know where this is at. So it is way too soon to talk about

10:33.940 --> 10:38.340
who are they going to cast as link? Who are they going to cast as Zelda? Is Loki going

10:38.340 --> 10:44.180
to be tingle? Like we keep, did you like that Twitter campaign I started by the way? Yeah,

10:44.180 --> 10:48.420
if it pays, well fine, I'll do it. I like that. That's a change of heart. Hey, it's

10:48.420 --> 10:57.300
money, whatever, money and whatever. I'm fine. So I'll don the spandex for that. Yeah,

10:57.300 --> 11:02.840
I don't know what's going to happen with this if it's even really something real, but certainly

11:02.840 --> 11:06.520
a lot of people are talking about it. And with the Wall Street Journal running it, I

11:06.520 --> 11:11.840
think this at least confirms it sounds like their source is inside Netflix. So it sounds

11:11.840 --> 11:17.100
like Netflix is definitely plotting something, but I mean that could even be something that's

11:17.100 --> 11:22.520
inspired by Zelda, but isn't necessarily going to be using the Zelda IP. I mean, there's

11:22.520 --> 11:29.500
just a lot of ideas on what this could really be. I just, I have a lot of questions about

11:29.500 --> 11:35.300
this. Now, assuming that Nintendo and Netflix have reached an arrangement, that just starts

11:35.300 --> 11:41.220
this whole other line of thought like, A, how on earth did Netflix convince Nintendo

11:41.220 --> 11:46.400
to let them do this? I mean, this is so huge. And you know, Nintendo's been burned with

11:46.400 --> 11:51.260
some of this stuff in the past. I mean, and we see Jason in the chat, VXX Jason XV over

11:51.260 --> 11:55.840
at live.vognetwork.com says, was the Mario movie explicitly stated as a source of strife

11:55.840 --> 12:01.520
like that? It has in the past, Jason, yes. And Jason says, and not the CDI Nintendo stuff.

12:01.520 --> 12:07.000
That has two actually, but I think more people know the movie than know the CDI games. So

12:07.000 --> 12:11.620
when the Wall Street Journal, which is more mainstream thing, runs it. That was just a,

12:11.620 --> 12:15.120
there was a lot of bad movies in that time. And just because it happened to be a Mario

12:15.160 --> 12:19.800
movie doesn't mean it was bad because it was, it was bad because it was in that time frame

12:19.800 --> 12:26.400
where there's a lot of bad cheesy movies that came out. Sure. And I, I kind of go, it's

12:26.400 --> 12:31.880
still interesting to me that Nintendo would be working with an American company like that,

12:31.880 --> 12:37.240
Netflix, like what, what is this arrangement entail? And I'm going to get super tinfoil

12:37.240 --> 12:42.360
hatty here, but this is what we do sometimes is we, you know, kind of make predictions

12:42.440 --> 12:47.600
and try to figure out where things could be going. I mean, where Netflix does make a lot

12:47.600 --> 12:53.880
of sense. Netflix is a power player in why people buy these gaming consoles in the first

12:53.880 --> 12:58.600
place because gaming consoles are not necessarily gaming consoles anymore. They're living room

12:58.600 --> 13:04.680
box entertainment devices. I mean, why is that? Because I think they should just be

13:04.680 --> 13:08.440
gaming consoles, but shaking my fist to cloud. Oh, that's just, but that's, that's where

13:08.440 --> 13:12.720
we're at now. I mean, more people watch Netflix on the, I have no problem with getting more

13:12.720 --> 13:19.040
value out of my purchase. That's just me. I don't, I don't hate the fact that game consoles

13:19.040 --> 13:24.200
want to be more and I get why they want to do it, but certainly I don't want them to

13:24.200 --> 13:28.280
ever lose sight of the games. And I think maybe that would be the concern why you don't

13:28.280 --> 13:33.360
want them to dip in all this other stuff. But anyway, I digress. Um, so it kind of makes

13:33.360 --> 13:39.560
me wonder, could there be some really weird arrangement where Netflix is doing this for

13:39.560 --> 13:45.560
Nintendo because Nintendo is going to get something out of Netflix that could possibly

13:45.560 --> 13:55.080
make the Wii U, the 3DS or the Wii U's successor, the must have entertainment box the way the

13:55.080 --> 14:00.160
Wii was. Now note, I don't think for a minute this means that Netflix would like disappear

14:00.160 --> 14:04.280
from PlayStation or Xbox. That's not what I think at all. That would just be shooting

14:04.280 --> 14:10.480
themselves in the foot. But could the next evolution of Netflix be something that's a

14:10.480 --> 14:15.960
little more unique to the Wii U's successor? No. Could this be the beginning of a partnership?

14:15.960 --> 14:19.640
I don't think so. You think I'm being too tinfoil hat? Why? Why? Cause I think they're

14:19.640 --> 14:23.320
just licensing their property. They have it being made into a show. I think it's more

14:23.320 --> 14:27.260
beneficial for Netflix to have something to compete with game of Thrones than it is for

14:27.260 --> 14:35.020
Nintendo to have a show for Zelda. Netflix jumping on this, I'm not questioning at all.

14:35.020 --> 14:40.400
They'd be stupid not to. Nintendo jumping in on this is where I have all the questions.

14:40.400 --> 14:44.720
That's the part that doesn't make sense. What does Nintendo have to gain from this? They

14:44.720 --> 14:52.380
make money in licensing. Because if it blows up like Game of Thrones did, they could make

14:52.380 --> 14:58.740
a ton of money on that. I think that's what they want to do. They want to make as little

14:58.740 --> 15:05.560
effort to make money as possible. Let's see. Bobby Blackwolf points out Sky. 3DS Netflix

15:05.560 --> 15:14.540
gets 3D movies. I actually forgot about that. 3D, supposedly, is on its way out. I shouldn't

15:14.540 --> 15:20.460
say that to the man who loves the Oculus Rift. It's not on its way out. It's just gonna be

15:20.460 --> 15:26.860
dormant for a while until VR and that kind of stuff takes over. Basically, you're gonna

15:26.860 --> 15:34.660
have that kind of content when that stuff is more popular and mainstream, I think. Asking

15:34.660 --> 15:39.020
someone to buy a 3D TV is kind of ridiculous. Bobby was throwing that out there as a possibility.

15:39.020 --> 15:42.460
Not something where they don't have 3D movies yet. Just that that's a possibility of something

15:42.460 --> 15:46.860
that could happen. Saying, we'll get 3D movies on the 3DS client if we can get a TV show

15:46.860 --> 15:56.540
from you. This is where my head was going. There's a really underutilized feature on

15:56.540 --> 16:00.420
the Wii U that I bet half the owners out there don't even remember that this is a thing on

16:00.420 --> 16:05.380
their Wii U. There's a feature called TV where that Wii U gamepad will function as a remote

16:05.380 --> 16:12.540
control for your TV. Big deal, right? But then you can also, with big epic TV shows

16:12.540 --> 16:19.180
and sports games, you can do a special Miiverse chatroom type thing that allows you to have

16:19.180 --> 16:23.460
TV watching be a little bit more of a social experience. For whatever reason, Nintendo

16:23.460 --> 16:29.180
doesn't really hype this up or promote it. But I was thinking, a lot of people were upset

16:29.180 --> 16:34.380
when they removed the party feature from Netflix on the Xbox 360. I don't know if that was

16:34.380 --> 16:39.780
a licensing thing or what this thing could be. But maybe, especially now that Netflix

16:39.780 --> 16:44.500
is dabbling in all their own original series, especially one that could be based around

16:44.500 --> 16:49.780
The Legend of Zelda, could there be a social watching experience? Could parties be coming

16:49.780 --> 16:51.340
back to an Nintendo platform is what I'm saying.

16:51.340 --> 16:56.140
I just don't see that as, I mean, it's cool. It's a neat feature and a plus, but it's not

16:56.140 --> 17:00.820
a plus. It's like, oh my God, I have to buy that console. That's the thing is I just don't

17:00.820 --> 17:07.300
see what they could possibly do that would make me have to buy this console because X

17:07.300 --> 17:13.340
features on there from Netflix. It just doesn't make any sense to me. I think it's more making

17:13.340 --> 17:20.300
money from licensing this property and having Netflix run with it and make it into something

17:20.300 --> 17:25.340
that's really good. And it's a plus for Netflix because they have something that competes

17:25.340 --> 17:28.340
with all the people that want to watch Game of Thrones and have HBO.

17:28.340 --> 17:32.840
You might convince me of what you're saying. If it was Nintendo would rather do this than

17:32.840 --> 17:39.320
make a mobile phone Mario. And that I would believe, um, don't count anything out yet. Maybe

17:39.320 --> 17:43.680
investor pressure. I don't know. Uh, let's see, looking at other comments from chat, uh, that

17:43.680 --> 17:48.600
retro code and chat says, would it be, would it have been better if Sony had done God of War with

17:48.600 --> 17:54.680
Netflix? Well, see, here's the interesting thing though. See with Sony, Sony is such a big, Sony

17:54.680 --> 18:00.320
makes TVs for God's sake. Sony also has their own entertainment arm. So everything that they do is

18:00.320 --> 18:04.520
in house and they have this whole powers thing that they're doing. That's going to be on the

18:04.520 --> 18:10.160
PlayStation and they've done it all in house. Microsoft was taking a very similar approach.

18:10.320 --> 18:15.440
They had founded their own entertainment studios that then they closed right soon after that

18:15.440 --> 18:18.880
without producing a whole lot of stuff. I mean, there was that documentary, which is apparently

18:18.880 --> 18:24.120
pretty good. I still need to watch it. Uh, there's, um, still that quantum break series.

18:24.120 --> 18:28.080
Something's going to happen with that. So Microsoft for all practical purposes was kind of

18:28.120 --> 18:33.680
trying to do their own thing, but maybe, maybe a partnership like, like this is in Microsoft's

18:33.680 --> 18:38.520
future. Who knows? Maybe after Nintendo saw what happened to Microsoft, Nintendo was like, we

18:38.520 --> 18:42.000
should partner up with somebody. Not that I think Nintendo would have ever produced something like

18:42.000 --> 18:47.760
this themselves. I don't know. But then, but then I think about those Pikmin movies that Miyamoto

18:47.760 --> 18:52.720
did for the film festivals. So couldn't it be, I don't know. It's so confusing. So confusing.

18:53.320 --> 18:59.200
There's no easy answer. This could all just be a big pile of poo too. This could all just be the

18:59.200 --> 19:05.120
biggest fucking rumor ever. And I mean, not to, you know, obviously if the wall street journal is

19:05.120 --> 19:09.240
running it, I put a little bit of credit in that, but maybe people are just making a bigger deal

19:09.240 --> 19:13.840
out of it. This could be a pitch pilot for Netflix and that's it.

19:13.880 --> 19:17.880
Well, then I kind of go back to also, you know, Sony making stuff out of their properties. I

19:17.920 --> 19:24.200
mean, you have the ratchet and clank movie coming out and you've also got, there was another one

19:24.200 --> 19:29.000
too that they were doing. Um, God, I don't even remember what it was now. Maybe in chart, was it

19:29.000 --> 19:31.080
uncharted? Were they doing the uncharted movie? I don't know.

19:31.120 --> 19:35.320
Yeah, I think I heard them say they were there in the early stages of that. Cause wasn't, um, it

19:35.320 --> 19:39.480
wasn't, what's his name? The, no, I'm thinking I'm mixing it up with Assassin's Creed.

19:39.640 --> 19:46.120
Yeah. Assassin's Creed. There's a ton of video game movies coming out and eventually they'll get

19:46.120 --> 19:51.320
better. I mean, they're not going to screw up. It's impossible for them to eventually, eventually

19:51.320 --> 19:55.160
they've got to make a good video game possible for them. They screw up every single one.

19:55.160 --> 19:59.800
Eventually they're going to have to accidentally do it right. So monkey at the typewriter will

19:59.800 --> 20:07.840
write Shakespeare eventually. It's going to happen eventually. Uh, let's see a dark soccer before we

20:07.840 --> 20:12.640
get into gaming weeks. What are your thoughts on a Zelda TV show? Is this of interest to you at all?

20:13.520 --> 20:20.320
As long as it's not like Game of Thrones, because I really don't care much for medieval politics.

20:21.600 --> 20:25.760
Yeah. I don't, I don't think that it would really get into, I mean, if it's supposed to be a family

20:25.760 --> 20:30.280
friendly show, I think a lot of things they do on Game of Thrones, no sleeping with your sister.

20:30.480 --> 20:35.680
You can't really do any of that, but I think it also opens the possibility that what if the show

20:35.680 --> 20:41.640
is just Hyrule? What if these are all characters that exist? Real wives of Hyrule.

20:42.680 --> 20:46.760
For all we, I mean, for all we know, who says Lincoln's Zelda have to be in it at all?

20:47.680 --> 20:48.640
It's all about Impa.

20:49.440 --> 20:54.880
Oh, I just, it could be something set in the Zelda universe. Then maybe that would be something where

20:54.880 --> 20:58.960
Nintendo's a little more willing to let it go. It'll be like Gotham.

21:00.840 --> 21:01.320
What?

21:02.120 --> 21:06.320
That would be sad. But by the way, I do have something else to talk about.

21:06.360 --> 21:06.800
What's that?

21:06.800 --> 21:08.320
If you don't mind giving me half a moment.

21:08.720 --> 21:13.200
Sure. But can I do some comments from chat real real quick over at live.vognetwork.com just the last

21:13.200 --> 21:18.800
few comments on this. That retro code in chat says, if it is a rumor, it gained a lot of attention

21:18.800 --> 21:24.520
than anything Sony and Microsoft have done with their shows. VXJ6V says it won't be like Game of

21:24.520 --> 21:34.200
Thrones, less sex and nudity. William Murderface suggests Hyrule Shore, GTL, Jim Triforce Laundry.

21:34.200 --> 21:40.120
I don't know. Um, let's see. Dungeon Buster says medieval politicking with the Lannisters does not

21:40.120 --> 21:45.080
equal family friendly. You know, I just, I don't think, I think you guys might be taking the Game

21:45.080 --> 21:48.840
of Thrones comparisons a little too literally. I think that's just, you know, they see that that,

21:49.000 --> 21:53.480
that audience is out there for medieval fantasy, like Lord of the Rings.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.280
We don't need Chair of Master Swords.

21:56.680 --> 22:00.320
All right. Before we get into gaming weeks, you have some things you want to talk about too, Jamie.

22:00.320 --> 22:06.240
Yes. Now there is a game out there that I have known about it being built for a few years now, and

22:06.240 --> 22:11.840
now it is finally released. It's done by a good friend of mine who I worked as his intern for a

22:11.840 --> 22:16.040
while and he's one of my teachers and a couple other friends of mine have contributed in design,

22:16.440 --> 22:23.960
but, um, it's called FLOM. F L O M M. You can get it on the App Store now. It's for iOS, um, with

22:24.200 --> 22:32.040
iPhone and iPad. And it's basically, it's based in art history, typography and the battle for

22:32.040 --> 22:38.040
modern art. So. This is really funny to me because when we were pitching ideas for the VOGJAM a

22:38.040 --> 22:43.000
couple months ago, I remember a buggy game one, you had suggested we should do a game that involves

22:43.000 --> 22:47.560
like typography and art. So it sounds like you kind of got your game after all. It's just not

22:47.560 --> 22:51.320
really a part of the VOGJAM. It was a tease. And it was one of your teachers that did it, but.

22:51.320 --> 22:59.880
But, um, you, you just, just actually, if you go on Google and look for FLOM, F L O M M, you'll

22:59.880 --> 23:06.120
find it right away. Check out the artwork in it. It's amazing. The music's cool. It's a, it's $2.99,

23:06.120 --> 23:10.120
but honestly, for all the work that went into it and how awesome it is, it's totally worth it.

23:10.120 --> 23:16.760
So everyone, you've got three bucks somewhere in your pocket. Go get FLOM. All right. And who

23:16.760 --> 23:21.240
knows, maybe I can get Steve to come on the show. All right. If enough people download it and say,

23:22.200 --> 23:27.560
come on the show, we'll make that happen. All right. Cool. Very cool. Well, let's talk about

23:27.560 --> 23:31.720
our gaming weeks. Uh, I know you have not had enough time to play that all week cause that

23:31.720 --> 23:35.160
just came out. So how was your gaming week? What types of video games have you been playing this

23:35.160 --> 23:42.920
week? Otherwise, Jamie, dragon age, lots of drag, D A I I'm assuming die. Yeah. I've been playing

23:42.920 --> 23:46.680
a lot of dragon age, but I've mostly been writing a lot of dragon age and you still haven't left

23:46.680 --> 23:53.320
the hinterlands. Yes. Well, no, we keep going back to the hinterlands cause I've decided that

23:53.320 --> 23:57.800
because I missed a solace on, um, the last time around, I'm actually going to get all

23:57.800 --> 24:01.960
the stupid shards to finish that. And then I don't know. And I'm romancing Colin with my

24:01.960 --> 24:07.080
human, with her weird face. I'll show everybody pictures of her weird face. When I find them

24:07.080 --> 24:11.000
over in her chair, she's, it's not weird. She's just unique. She kind of looks like in bread

24:11.000 --> 24:17.880
nobility. Only you would sit there and think about these types of things as you're making

24:17.880 --> 24:22.680
the character. Like I have to make her authentic for my RP to work. I'm going to need her to be

24:22.680 --> 24:32.360
slightly inbred. Well, hello. Aren't all nobles inbred inbred worse than, I don't know if I would

24:32.360 --> 24:38.040
say all that's, that could be a very slanderous statement. Okay. They're just, history is

24:38.040 --> 24:44.040
fascinating. Let's just leave it at that. History is fascinating. They're all a bit frumpy, aren't

24:44.040 --> 24:52.360
they? Because it's a bad idea when cousins marry. All right. Uh, let's move on to a Loki. How was

24:52.360 --> 24:59.720
your gaming week? Um, my game week was okay. I did play, uh, well, one thing I finished playing,

24:59.720 --> 25:08.360
um, was it, uh, saints group got out of hell. I 100% in game. I haven't gotten all the trophies

25:08.360 --> 25:14.440
yet, but I don't know if I'm going to just because it's, it's now it's doing all the tedious shit

25:14.440 --> 25:19.720
that they want you to do in the game. Like drive for like 3000 miles or something like that. It's

25:19.720 --> 25:26.200
like, why would you drive any car when you can fly through the entire game? It's like, I don't

25:26.200 --> 25:30.840
understand that, but okay. That's one of the things I have to do or play co-op for three hours

25:30.840 --> 25:36.680
in this game. I'm like, no, no, I'm not going to do that. So I pretty much, I am, I've done with

25:36.680 --> 25:41.240
the game, so I don't know if I'm really going to play any further with that. I did download the

25:41.240 --> 25:45.480
battlefield hard lane beta today, so I'm going to probably check that out because that looks

25:45.480 --> 25:52.520
right at my alley. Um, what else did I play this week? I don't know. I thought about playing

25:52.520 --> 25:56.520
Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto, but I just didn't get around to it. Just worked at my game

25:56.520 --> 26:02.840
mostly. So, um, you know, hopefully we'll have that to something more playable because right now

26:02.840 --> 26:07.240
I just have kind of the first level and it's more of an intro. It doesn't really have anything. It's

26:07.240 --> 26:11.320
um, you know, but once I get the whole, once you get the engine built then yeah, once it,

26:11.320 --> 26:14.680
I've got the front, then you get to do the stuff you've been wanting to do since the very beginning.

26:14.680 --> 26:20.200
Oh, I got all sorts of crazy ideas. I know you do. That'll be fun. Um, so yeah, I'll do that.

26:20.200 --> 26:23.400
And once again, as mentioned, you know, big thanks to, you know, Raccoon Media for

26:24.120 --> 26:28.280
the art assets and stuff. Um, and I haven't creamed some of my stuff, but yeah, you can

26:28.280 --> 26:31.880
check out their stuff. They've got, um, you know, a lot of free packs out there, especially if

26:31.880 --> 26:36.200
you're like looking to make like mobile games or, you know, even just regular games. I was at Raccoon

26:36.200 --> 26:41.880
media, raccoon-media.nl is their website. And they, I think they're on blend swap and the assets

26:41.880 --> 26:45.000
soar and there's one other one, but I don't remember. I'm the only one without something

26:45.000 --> 26:50.200
to pitch tonight. I'm sorry. He asked me, they asked me the pitches. These are all good reasons.

26:51.240 --> 26:56.680
I had, you know, I feel indebted with the low poly bacon. He gave you free bacon. The man gave me

26:56.680 --> 27:01.080
bacon over the internet. That's like, we're now living in the future. I understand. I understand.

27:02.680 --> 27:06.840
You don't have to convince me. It's fine. But, uh, yeah, that's what I played. So hopefully,

27:06.840 --> 27:11.080
um, I may play something else this week. I did install a few more games. I had in my steam

27:11.080 --> 27:17.080
backlog and bought more. Why? I don't know. I bought the star Wars humble bundle. This

27:17.080 --> 27:21.480
you're never going to play it. You're never going to play. I know I'm never going to have

27:21.480 --> 27:27.320
the hours to play those games. You don't have them. I'm never, it's like, they do not exist.

27:27.320 --> 27:32.280
I'm like a hoarder. Seriously. It's like hoarding, except it's all digital. So it

27:32.280 --> 27:38.520
doesn't make any of the mess, but yes, it's, it's, it's seriously the problem right there.

27:38.520 --> 27:43.320
It, how many, how many games in your collection have you still not played?

27:44.600 --> 27:51.800
Most of them. I don't know. I have a lot. I haven't even installed the new ones. I just got

27:51.800 --> 27:57.640
today. So, or added to, I haven't even added them into my library yet, but I've got 335 games. Sorry.

27:57.640 --> 28:05.560
In my library. I don't know. Uh, non game plane related. I did see some leaked screenshots from

28:05.560 --> 28:10.520
just cause three and I, I had, I totally have to buy that day one now because it looks amazing.

28:13.720 --> 28:18.920
That's it. That's it. All right. Someday we're going to see you on one of those like TLC shows,

28:18.920 --> 28:23.080
uh, about hoarding. Oh, someday I'm going to look like, look back and see how much I actually spent

28:23.080 --> 28:28.600
on my steam library after a long time. Like, Oh my God, what was I doing? At least. Okay. At least

28:28.600 --> 28:33.240
with humble bundle, at least you can donate it to charity. So it's like a little, I have to,

28:33.240 --> 28:37.720
I have to be a lot less judgy with that. And the thing is like a lot of the games I'm getting,

28:37.720 --> 28:43.560
you know, it's just like 10 games for 11 bucks. And so, I mean, it's hard to kind of just like,

28:44.760 --> 28:50.520
I may play it someday, but it's a buck. Okay. But sometimes, sometimes that also,

28:50.520 --> 28:53.400
I'm not saying this with a humble bundle and not saying this about star Wars games,

28:53.400 --> 28:57.560
but I'm just saying sometimes you can also get like, you know, you remember like they

28:57.560 --> 29:04.280
would have the NES cartridges. It's like 96 ROMs in one and like 54 of them are just

29:04.280 --> 29:10.120
like pallet swaps on clue, clue land. Like not every game is something you have to,

29:11.240 --> 29:18.600
you don't need it. You don't need it. But I do. And no, here's the worst part. Here's the

29:18.600 --> 29:22.200
worst part. It's starting to get like down to PlayStation network too. And that, Oh my God.

29:22.200 --> 29:26.760
Oh my God. I want to have a show. Okay. This is my pitch to TLC. Are you, there's somebody from

29:26.760 --> 29:30.840
TLC listening to the show. This is my pitch. This is my pitch. Okay. It's just like they do. You've

29:30.840 --> 29:35.800
seen Hoarders. Surely you've all seen that show, right? And they go and they, they, they, they

29:35.800 --> 29:40.680
clean the person's house or whatever. And the person has to like one little pile at a time

29:40.680 --> 29:47.880
decide, do I really need this? Or should I throw it away? And like, there's always some like

29:47.880 --> 29:52.680
crumpled up piece of garbage that the person just loses their fucking mind over because they can't

29:52.680 --> 29:56.760
throw it away. Right. This is just, and I shouldn't make light of an illness and I'm not like not,

29:56.760 --> 30:04.440
but I mean, it's television and they are putting themselves on TV. So. But Loki, I feel like there

30:04.440 --> 30:09.240
should be a show where you're forced to sit there with your Steam collection and like the host comes

30:09.240 --> 30:16.440
in and says, okay, Loki, you have 750 games in your Steam collection. Today, we're going to cut

30:16.440 --> 30:24.760
that down to 50 and I need you to pick which 710 games are we going to delete forever? What if

30:26.600 --> 30:31.960
Loki's games are so wildly popular that he becomes the next Andy Warhol of video games.

30:33.320 --> 30:39.080
You see what that man collected a warehouse full of multiples of plates and lunch boxes and trash

30:39.080 --> 30:43.400
cans. And he would never let any of his staff throw anything away. They had to sneak out the

30:43.400 --> 30:48.600
trash when he wasn't there. What if- I'm not that bad. We're talking digital games here to

30:48.600 --> 30:52.360
take no space. If it's like physical games, then yeah, that might be a problem because I have to

30:52.360 --> 30:55.960
move that stuff around. I don't know anything about that. It's in the cloud. I don't know

30:55.960 --> 31:01.800
anything about physical games that we keep in storage at Dan's mom's house. Oh yeah. Oh man.

31:01.800 --> 31:05.400
I mean, again, I said I shouldn't make light of this, but I kind of, I kind of grew up around

31:05.400 --> 31:10.440
this because my dad kind of has these like hoarding tendencies and like our garage was

31:10.440 --> 31:15.960
just full of like weird stuff. Like there would be pens that no longer work that would be in a jar.

31:15.960 --> 31:19.720
Like these are just things that my dad just happens to collect. And I remember,

31:19.720 --> 31:24.280
I will never forget this. Do you remember when the big flood happened in the nineties and Bill

31:24.280 --> 31:27.560
Clinton came to visit? Well, you weren't here at the time. You probably heard about it in the news.

31:27.560 --> 31:30.200
Bill Clinton, who was the president at the time came to visit and all this stuff. So it was a big

31:30.200 --> 31:35.000
flood. Now our garage flooded during that whole thing. So my dad was devastated because a lot of

31:35.000 --> 31:39.240
his stuff got damaged. Well, I remember one day we were out there cleaning and trying to sort,

31:39.240 --> 31:42.200
like, you know, what do we have to put in the dumpster? Cause it's wet and gone forever.

31:42.200 --> 31:47.800
And there was a big pile of dry stuff. And my mom looks at it and goes, Rob, Rob, Rob, I'm going to

31:47.800 --> 31:53.400
send your father into the house. Rob, I want you to get the hose and I want you to spray this all

31:53.400 --> 32:03.560
down. I shouldn't tell that story on my radio show, but damn. I mean, these are just, these

32:03.560 --> 32:07.800
are just the stories that shape the person that I am today. So, you know, there you go.

32:08.360 --> 32:13.960
I will eventually play all these games once I have, you know, enough free time. So if someone

32:13.960 --> 32:18.600
takes the kids for like maybe a few years, then we'll have enough time to play through all these

32:18.600 --> 32:23.640
games. Once you're saving for retirement is what you're doing. Oh yeah, exactly.

32:25.400 --> 32:30.280
All right. Anyhow, uh, before I tell more stories from my childhood, I should probably get into my

32:30.280 --> 32:34.520
gaming week and the types of video games that I've been playing this week. Um, a lot of the

32:34.520 --> 32:39.720
same old standard standby stuff. I played some, you know, Diablo three, been a lot of that,

32:39.720 --> 32:42.920
especially with the season ending. There's been a lot of stuff going on with Diablo three. I'm

32:42.920 --> 32:47.160
looking forward to the next season soon. I've been playing a bit on PlayStation four as well,

32:47.160 --> 32:50.840
because like I said, at the beginning of the year, I want to go after my platinum trophy.

32:50.840 --> 32:56.680
So I started a new character and things are going well there. Um, excuse me, I've also been playing

32:56.680 --> 33:00.760
more fantasy life, uh, cause I got some more street passes over the weekend. That was pretty

33:00.760 --> 33:05.480
cool to finally see like new people show up in my village. And that's kind of neat. I like what

33:05.480 --> 33:10.840
they do with that in fantasy life, but besides the, uh, good old standards that I've been playing

33:10.840 --> 33:16.520
from week to week on this show, I got to play a lot of good old games over the weekend because I

33:16.520 --> 33:21.640
went to an event that we talked about a couple of weeks ago on the show. I went to the rockage event

33:21.640 --> 33:27.400
in San Jose, uh, which some people were lovingly calling and I saw this as a street passes. I got

33:27.400 --> 33:32.840
some people were lovingly calling it mag west because of course, as we talked about with Eric

33:32.840 --> 33:36.760
on the show a couple of weeks ago, when he was here, uh, we talked about how mag fest is now

33:36.760 --> 33:43.160
sponsoring this fourth, uh, year of the rockage event in San Jose. Um, so basically at the San

33:43.160 --> 33:47.640
Jose student union, they had the whole second floor and I think they were running some tabletop

33:47.640 --> 33:51.800
on the first floor as well, but they had the whole second floor of the student union kind of sealed

33:51.800 --> 33:57.000
off where, you know, you, you, you get your admission wristband and you get in and you have

33:57.000 --> 34:03.320
access to basically three main areas. You have kind of the, the LA the foyer area, and then you

34:03.320 --> 34:08.680
have the, the lounge stage, and then you have the main stage. And in the main stage, they had some

34:08.680 --> 34:13.720
bands playing on and off throughout the day. And they also had a collection of classic video games,

34:13.720 --> 34:17.640
uh, that I believe a lot of that was borrowed from the California extreme event, uh, that they

34:17.640 --> 34:22.440
do here over the summer. Uh, so they had some classic games from the eighties. I got to play

34:22.440 --> 34:27.960
some tempest, wizard of war. They had a Tron arcade machines. That was awesome. If you follow

34:27.960 --> 34:32.920
me on Twitter, you saw that I got the number one score on Qbert. And so I put in Vaugas the

34:32.920 --> 34:39.000
initials there cause F yeah, Qbert. Uh, and, uh, there was a point blank too. That was awesome to

34:39.000 --> 34:44.280
play too. So this is a lot of like really cool, uh, retro arcade games and pinball games. And I've

34:44.280 --> 34:48.360
never, I did not realize this was a thing, dark soccer, but there was, and now that I think about

34:48.360 --> 34:52.040
maybe you have mentioned this on the show before, but I just never seen it, but they had a medieval

34:52.040 --> 34:58.200
madness table and they had a tales of Arabian nights table, uh, table, but the dot matrix

34:58.200 --> 35:03.080
displays were in color. Like they were modded to be color displays. And I didn't know that was

35:03.080 --> 35:07.480
the thing people did. Yeah. You can get color LEDs and whatnot. I never knew that was a thing. I'd

35:07.480 --> 35:12.280
never seen ones. That was really cool. There's, there's lots of, um, uh, like mods people will

35:12.280 --> 35:16.600
people actually will buy kits to do certain things like with the newer tables too. Like,

35:16.600 --> 35:23.080
well, Dan has, um, uh, I think a small mod on our Twilight zone. And then, um, for newer ones,

35:23.080 --> 35:28.600
I showed you, uh, the pictures I took of a modded Tron that has like the arcade cabinet on it and

35:28.600 --> 35:34.600
the extra lights and whatnot. So yeah, people do it all the time. So, uh, yeah. So I just,

35:34.600 --> 35:37.400
maybe it's because I haven't been to California extreme in a few years, but that was like,

35:37.400 --> 35:42.440
I was like, Oh, neat. So they have that. And then they had classic consoles kind of around

35:42.440 --> 35:47.240
the perimeter of the main stage room. And then they had a lounge room that was a smaller room

35:47.240 --> 35:51.800
and they had, they tried to make it a little more well loungy and no, it wasn't an orange

35:51.800 --> 35:55.480
lounge. I'm sorry to say, but maybe we need to talk about that for next year. But anyway,

35:55.480 --> 36:00.120
uh, they also had some classic consoles in there. So I got to play, like I got my Mario Kart 64 on,

36:00.120 --> 36:06.120
which man, going from playing Mario Kart eight all the way back to play Mario Kart 64. Like

36:06.760 --> 36:10.360
I forget that not all the tricks work and you can't drift the same way, but anyway,

36:10.360 --> 36:17.080
it was still fun to go back and revisit that. So, um, also this is neat out in the lobby area,

36:17.080 --> 36:22.360
they actually had, and I had yet to see one of these. They had a beat mania 2DX, uh, pen jewel.

36:22.360 --> 36:27.400
I think the name of the mix is number 22 in the series. I had not seen one that new. I've never

36:27.400 --> 36:32.280
seen a screen that crisp. I think it's on one of the new HD monitors. So I was like, wow, that's

36:32.360 --> 36:37.320
kind of neat. Cause that was on free play. And then they had a new DDR, like the reboot of dance

36:37.320 --> 36:41.240
dance revolution. They had that sitting right next to it. Now I didn't embarrass myself by

36:41.240 --> 36:45.960
playing that in public because, you know, I talked about playing DDR last week and how easy I broke

36:45.960 --> 36:50.440
sweat, but I watched some other girls playing it and watching some other people kind of rotate

36:50.440 --> 36:55.000
through throughout the day. And I was like, Oh, neat. You know, it's just, it has an interface

36:55.000 --> 36:58.520
that kind of reminds me of the Xbox games a little more. Uh, it was just kind of neat to see that a

36:58.520 --> 37:03.480
little different. And they had some vendor tables, a lot of people, uh, dealing in classic games.

37:03.480 --> 37:08.040
And then they actually had a third area for people to do music too. That was kind of off in the

37:08.040 --> 37:13.160
corner. Um, so you'd have a lot more of the smaller, uh, rigs that would go over there.

37:13.160 --> 37:18.840
Um, so yeah, it was music and it was, it was kind of like a little piece of a lot of conventions

37:18.840 --> 37:23.800
I've been to in the past year or so kind of all hodgepodge together into this one thing. And

37:23.800 --> 37:29.000
that was, that was pretty cool. Uh, I had a good time. I, you know, it's a three day event and

37:29.000 --> 37:32.920
sadly I was only able to spend half a day there cause I just, you know, I had, I'm trying to do

37:32.920 --> 37:37.640
this. The event is still going as we speak and I wanted to be here at OLR for you all. And I had

37:37.640 --> 37:41.320
to drive to San Jose to get to this thing and I had my job. So, you know, I could only get there

37:41.320 --> 37:44.920
for a half day, but I had a good time for the time I was there. Uh, I wish I could have brought

37:44.920 --> 37:49.880
somebody else. I should, next year I'm going to have to really berate Jamie into going with me

37:49.880 --> 37:55.080
if she's not working because, uh, it would have been nice to be able to play games together with

37:55.080 --> 37:59.560
somebody or something cause I would have liked to have gone rather than, you know, what I was doing.

38:01.160 --> 38:03.960
Well, maybe next year we'll plan better. We didn't have a lot of notice this year,

38:03.960 --> 38:09.480
but I would definitely attend again next year. I had a good time. So, uh, and I, I have a feeling

38:09.480 --> 38:14.280
this event is going to just get bigger and bigger. I have a feeling they're going to already outgrow

38:14.280 --> 38:18.440
this space and next year they're going to look at something bigger. It wasn't super crowded in

38:18.440 --> 38:23.000
the morning when I was there Saturday. In fact, I was kind of thinking like, wow, it's, I'm

38:23.000 --> 38:26.280
surprised there's not a lot of people here, but then I started to think I was like, you know,

38:26.280 --> 38:30.920
people are probably still hungover from last night. So I waited a little while and sure

38:30.920 --> 38:35.160
enough as the day went on, it started to get pretty, pretty full and, uh, you couldn't even

38:35.160 --> 38:39.960
really get on one of the classic arcade games without a wait. So, uh, I think they did a good

38:39.960 --> 38:43.880
job attendance wise. I hope it was good enough to get the venue paid for and all that good stuff

38:43.880 --> 38:47.080
so they can get an even bigger spot next year. But yeah, I had a good time at the Rockage event.

38:47.080 --> 38:52.680
So congrats to all those responsible for putting it on and, uh, very talented musicians. I wish I

38:52.680 --> 38:56.600
could have seen more, uh, just unfortunately, you know, again, I can only be there for a half day

38:56.600 --> 39:01.000
and I can't be at all three stages at once, but I really enjoyed some of the stuff I was watching.

39:01.000 --> 39:05.000
Dude, this one band, and I'm so sorry, I forgot the name of the band. I'm so sorry.

39:05.000 --> 39:11.640
Uh, but they were rocking, they were playing, uh, songs using an accordion, a saxophone. They had

39:11.640 --> 39:16.680
a fricking, I don't know if it was a, I think it was a marimba up on stage. Like they were just

39:16.680 --> 39:23.000
doing all this like crazy. Was, was, was there a zither? I don't think so. But then, uh,

39:23.960 --> 39:27.400
did you find a theremin? No, there was no there. Well, not that I saw that. I'm not saying there

39:27.400 --> 39:29.560
wasn't one there, but there just wasn't the one there when I was looking. Did you find someone

39:29.560 --> 39:35.640
playing a melodica? Uh, probably. Melodicas are awesome. So anyway, uh, I'm sure there'll be,

39:35.640 --> 39:39.960
uh, I'm sure they're coming back next year. And I gotta say, you know, there's several listeners

39:39.960 --> 39:43.880
out there that has said, Rob, you really need to come to MAGFest. You need to come to MAGFest.

39:43.880 --> 39:47.000
When are you going to come to MAGFest? And I gotta be thinking, after going to Rockage,

39:47.000 --> 39:55.480
I'm kind of thinking, yeah, I probably should go to MAGFest. So I'm not saying yes to next year

39:55.480 --> 40:00.360
yet, but I'm saying I'm thinking about it more seriously than I ever have before. So there you

40:00.360 --> 40:06.120
go. SSU 100 Matt in our chat says, Rockage was your taste of MAGFest. Now you have to come to

40:06.120 --> 40:10.600
the real thing. It's just, it's just cost, flights, all that. That's the only thing stopping me. But,

40:10.920 --> 40:15.240
we'll see. We'll see. I'm not saying no at this point. We'll see what happens.

40:15.880 --> 40:22.520
So that was my gaming week and a weekend thereof. So, uh, quickly, some housekeeping. I don't have

40:22.520 --> 40:27.160
a whole lot to report. I will just say, uh, twitter.com slash O-L-R is where you can follow

40:27.160 --> 40:32.520
us on Twitter. Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio is where you can follow us on Facebook.

40:32.520 --> 40:38.520
I mentioned we may be missing a show in March. Uh, I'm not sure if that is sure yet. I will have

40:38.520 --> 40:43.800
an update for you guys hopefully next week. Unfortunately, uh, I am having to play a little

40:43.800 --> 40:47.960
bit of a waiting game, which is frustrating to say least, but we'll find out for you next week,

40:47.960 --> 40:52.600
uh, or at least I'll make a decision by then. That's for sure. All right. Uh, so that's it

40:52.600 --> 40:58.440
for housekeeping. Let's go into some gaming news for the night. Uh, kind of been an interesting

40:58.440 --> 41:01.720
week in gaming news. There hasn't been a lot of it, but there's been some interesting things here

41:01.720 --> 41:09.160
and there. Loki. Yeah. So apparently the, um, the release date for street fighter four on PC and

41:09.160 --> 41:15.320
PlayStation four has been revealed, uh, supposed to be coming out. I don't have the exact date

41:15.320 --> 41:22.840
here real quick. Um, March, 2016. So that's when it's kind of slated least right now,

41:22.840 --> 41:27.640
at least they're thinking ahead. Um, so we'll have to see them. They're saying that the roster

41:27.640 --> 41:34.040
of characters may be pretty small. Um, leaving room for DLC almost sounds like kind of a hybrid

41:34.040 --> 41:39.400
version of how they did killer instinct where everything was almost a la carte, but I guess

41:39.400 --> 41:45.960
we'll have to see, um, who actually ends up being in the launch roster. Uh, they're saying it's

41:45.960 --> 41:53.640
going to be 16 characters and, um, I don't know. I'm just not that excited about street fighter

41:53.640 --> 41:59.800
really anymore because I have to see what really the benefits are between street fighter four and

41:59.800 --> 42:05.800
street fighter five. I don't know. For me, it's just characters actually. Yeah. The fact that

42:05.800 --> 42:13.400
it's going back to a roster of 16 characters, it, it concerns me a little bit. Um, I, I, it does

42:13.400 --> 42:18.520
feel like a step backwards when we're, and I, I realized some of the more people that are tuned

42:18.520 --> 42:22.600
into the fighting game community and in series may argue with me a little bit on this because,

42:22.600 --> 42:28.120
you know, if the, if the, um, technique and the game and all this is improving,

42:28.120 --> 42:32.600
then they're not going to possibly be able to fit as many characters as street fighter Uber.

42:32.600 --> 42:36.760
Here's the thing is all I'm thinking is what they do with Marvel versus Capcom three, where it's

42:36.760 --> 42:41.080
like, yeah, I mean, they had a pretty decent roster with that, but then, Oh, Hey, you want

42:41.080 --> 42:45.480
DLC characters. Those are gonna be five bucks each. You know, that's like, that's a legitimate

42:45.480 --> 42:50.440
concern. I think in the year 2015, that's a very legitimate concern to have about the game. And I

42:50.440 --> 42:55.320
hope to God, there isn't a bunch of them that are already on the disc. I would think if they're

42:55.320 --> 43:00.200
going to release it on PC, they're not dumb enough to do that. Cause if the, if it's on the PC disc,

43:00.200 --> 43:05.720
it'll be found like that. Right. So I'm thinking that won't happen, but I, I, I have that same

43:05.720 --> 43:11.480
concern. And I think it's legitimate that you have 16 characters for now, but then it's going to be

43:11.480 --> 43:16.680
16 more characters that slowly come out throughout the year that are $5 each. I would just, and maybe

43:16.680 --> 43:22.280
that won't be the case, which is fine. I would just kind of like some clarity on that. I think

43:22.280 --> 43:27.400
some DLC characters are inevitable. Yeah. I mean, that's just the age we live in, but,

43:28.680 --> 43:32.200
and then I'm sure that we'll get a million and that's the other thing too. It's like,

43:32.200 --> 43:36.600
why should I really buy the DLC characters? Why I'm, you know, super street fighter five

43:36.600 --> 43:41.720
or arcade edition turbo, whatever the hell you want to, you know, re-release it as it's going

43:41.720 --> 43:45.160
to come out with those characters in there and then the additional characters. And that's what

43:45.160 --> 43:51.080
SSG100 Matt in our chat room says, so wait for ultra super street fighter five in holiday 2016.

43:52.680 --> 43:57.320
So a lot of people are thinking if, if this game only releases with so many characters

43:57.320 --> 44:00.840
and they do all these DLC characters, yeah, I'll just wait. I'll just wait for the year

44:00.840 --> 44:06.520
end edition or what have you. Yeah. So I would like to hear more about the game mechanics and,

44:06.520 --> 44:13.400
you know, why maybe the roster will be less. Um, I know in the case of like mortal combat X,

44:13.400 --> 44:17.000
I think that game is supposed to have a smaller roster too. I think it's what it's 24. I think

44:17.000 --> 44:23.000
immortal combat X I might be wrong. Uh, but, um, the thing with mortal combat X is that each

44:23.000 --> 44:26.520
character is supposed to have like three different fighting styles, I think. Yeah. So even though you

44:26.520 --> 44:31.560
have only 24 characters, you have all these fighting styles too. So like 72 characters,

44:31.560 --> 44:36.600
right. But not, not to give one a pass where I'm not going to give the other a pass because I'm

44:36.600 --> 44:40.520
sure, I'm sure it's inevitable that immortal combat actually have DLC characters. Why not?

44:40.520 --> 44:44.760
They did it with last game. So it's just a question of, all right, how many, how many,

44:44.760 --> 44:52.200
and should I just wait for the ultimate mortal combat X edition for that? Um, let's see that

44:52.200 --> 44:57.320
retro code in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says I'm kind of over street fighter, even though

44:57.320 --> 45:01.480
Sony got the exclusive on it. Um, I'm seeing certainly there's a lot of people that are very

45:01.480 --> 45:05.000
excited about it. I mean, the fighting game community, of course, I'm kind of curious how

45:05.000 --> 45:09.400
they're going to sell it to everybody else. Maybe people that aren't like super tuned into the

45:09.400 --> 45:12.680
fighting game community and all those events and these, how are they going to sell it to the rest

45:12.680 --> 45:17.400
of us? Cause yeah, I mean, there's going to be a lot of people, whether you want to agree with

45:17.400 --> 45:21.320
me or not, I'm telling you, there's a lot of people that are going to look at it and go,

45:21.320 --> 45:24.920
why would I buy this game that only has 16 people when I could buy this one that has

45:25.880 --> 45:32.040
50 people in it? I mean, for some people, it's going to come down to that, whether you want to

45:32.040 --> 45:36.760
admit it or not. I mean, obviously a fighting game, super fan will be able to rattle off a

45:36.760 --> 45:41.080
list of reasons why that's wrong, but somebody who's just looking at the back of the box in a

45:41.080 --> 45:45.480
GameStop that isn't as tuned in. I don't know. It's just like for me, like the difference between

45:45.480 --> 45:51.080
like when they went and did, you know, street fighter four, which, you know, style-wise that

45:51.080 --> 45:55.160
was, you know, completely different than what they had previously, you know, how it kind of went all

45:55.160 --> 46:01.960
3d and everything, but it's still 2d, but now five, you know, the evolution from four to five

46:01.960 --> 46:07.160
doesn't seem as big. Now I understand there's probably going to be a lot of stuff gameplay-wise,

46:07.160 --> 46:12.200
tweaks, and that kind of thing, but for me, a person that's not, you know, super into

46:13.240 --> 46:19.080
fighting games, I don't notice that. I just notice what it looks like, the roster of characters,

46:19.800 --> 46:25.800
and is there anybody in there that, you know, kind of hooks me into the game, you know, and I just,

46:25.800 --> 46:29.240
I'm not really seeing that yet. I mean, there's some gameplay things that they're doing that are

46:29.240 --> 46:33.000
kind of neat, but it's just, you know, more of like, oh, that's kind of cool, you know,

46:33.000 --> 46:37.320
other than like, oh wow, I got to really play that. So I don't know. We'll see.

46:39.000 --> 46:44.920
All right. Well, let's see, moving on, talking about something else that happened this week with

46:44.920 --> 46:50.040
Nintendo over in their camp, you know, Club Nintendo is being phased out. We don't know what

46:50.040 --> 46:55.560
the replacement program looks like yet, but seeing as Club Nintendo as it is, I believe is fading

46:55.560 --> 47:01.480
out, what, in June? I think you have until June to cash out on this stuff. It would make sense

47:01.480 --> 47:06.440
that the successor program will be unveiled during E3. Obviously we don't know that for a fact,

47:06.440 --> 47:10.600
but it would make an awful lot of sense, wouldn't it? Well, anyway, Club Nintendo went through an

47:10.600 --> 47:15.160
update, as I mentioned this week, where there's a lot of stuff available. It's kind of like a

47:15.160 --> 47:19.560
Hail Mary for the program where, you know, if you've accumulated coins and you haven't spent

47:19.560 --> 47:25.000
them, there is plenty of stuff to spend it on now. I'm calling it now, exclusive amiibos through

47:25.000 --> 47:29.560
whatever the replacement service is. Perhaps, and there's something coming up in the show later

47:29.560 --> 47:35.000
where that may actually exactly be the case, but who knows? But, I mean, there are just virtual

47:35.000 --> 47:40.680
console games galore, as well as even some full game downloads that aren't like virtual console,

47:40.680 --> 47:47.800
like Harmonite for 3DS I saw on there, Dr. Mario on Wii U, even some retail titles were available

47:47.800 --> 47:53.160
on there. And of course, some of that sweet Nintendo physical gear that I know a lot of you

47:53.160 --> 47:58.360
are wanting to get your hands on. For example, there's a Zelda Majora's Mask messenger bag,

47:58.360 --> 48:04.520
also a Majora's Mask jigsaw puzzle, which will set you back 800 coins. There's a Retro Mario

48:04.520 --> 48:11.880
t-shirt for 700 coins, a Legend of Zelda 3DS XL pouch, and Animal Crossing playing cards for 600

48:11.880 --> 48:16.360
coins. So, I mean, that's kind of cool that they have, like, not just the vast amount of virtual

48:16.360 --> 48:21.080
console games, but all these physical rewards. So, they want to make sure people are going to flush

48:21.080 --> 48:26.840
out their coins and everything will be spent. Here's the only problem. This launched, what,

48:26.840 --> 48:33.400
Monday, Tuesday is when this all went down. The website has been getting hammered consistently

48:33.400 --> 48:39.480
ever since. Here I am days after the fact, I'm even trying to load the page right now in studio.

48:40.520 --> 48:45.320
Just spinning wheel, trying to get it to come up, waiting. I got to come up earlier, but I couldn't

48:45.320 --> 48:49.960
log in to my computer. Like, this is, like, several days after the fact and this is still

48:49.960 --> 48:55.320
broken. And so, there's a part of me that's like, this is why everybody says Nintendo

48:55.320 --> 49:01.000
doesn't understand online. Because they demonstrate that they don't understand online.

49:01.000 --> 49:06.840
Now, on one hand, Nintendo is really under no obligation to do Club Nintendo in the first place.

49:06.840 --> 49:11.960
I mean, it is a nice thing that they do. They do get some things out of it for all those little

49:11.960 --> 49:16.520
product surveys that you do and stuff. I mean, that is information that Nintendo may otherwise

49:16.520 --> 49:20.600
have to pay some other type of outside firm to gather. So, it's not that Nintendo doesn't get

49:20.600 --> 49:24.280
anything out of it. But for all practical purposes, they're under no obligation to do

49:24.280 --> 49:29.560
anything like Club Nintendo in the first place. They're really not. So, I mean, even if Club

49:29.560 --> 49:38.200
Nintendo didn't exist, you can't get that upset. However, it is still frustrating with as fanboy-y

49:38.200 --> 49:43.800
as a lot of Nintendo people get, as we've seen through this whole amiibo fuckery. It is really

49:43.800 --> 49:48.360
annoying when this stuff is being dangled in front of you and you know it's going to get

49:48.360 --> 49:53.960
snapped up and disappear like that, but you're sitting there literally watching paint dry.

49:53.960 --> 49:58.040
You're watching that spinning circle trying to connect to this website because Nintendo

49:58.680 --> 50:02.600
doesn't have a queue system like Blizzard does when BlizzCon tickets go on sale or something

50:02.600 --> 50:08.120
like that. Nintendo is not that progressed online in their website development where they have some

50:08.120 --> 50:13.480
type of system to be able to handle the load that Nintendo ought to expect by now when they're going

50:13.480 --> 50:20.920
to offer basically a free, essentially, Majora's Mask messenger bag. I mean, really? You didn't

50:20.920 --> 50:25.400
think the site was going to get hammered right away? I don't know. So, here we are all these

50:25.400 --> 50:30.920
days later. Oh, it finally loaded. Hey, maybe all that complaining worked. Finally loaded.

50:30.920 --> 50:40.760
Now I just have to log in and maybe I can spend some coins. Maybe. Anyway, VX Jason in chat says,

50:40.760 --> 50:45.480
they demonstrate they don't understand online. Really? Counterpoint. Every new MMO ever.

50:45.480 --> 50:50.760
Blizzard doesn't know online? Really? MMO online connected game. I didn't say Blizzard doesn't know

50:50.760 --> 50:56.200
online, but Blizzard isn't immune to some of these problems with their own games. However,

50:56.200 --> 51:01.720
with things on the web like BlizzCon and so forth, they actually do. I mean, there have been years in

51:01.720 --> 51:06.200
the past that haven't worked out so well, but for right now they have a system that's kind of

51:06.200 --> 51:11.880
worked. I mean, they have the queuing system in UQ to buy everything in the store and it

51:11.880 --> 51:17.320
works out for the BlizzCon stuff. So, I actually think in regards to selling things online,

51:17.320 --> 51:21.640
Blizzard does have it worked out right now. I would just expect five days after the fact

51:21.640 --> 51:27.880
Nintendo would have it a little more together. But again, technically they're not under any

51:27.880 --> 51:31.560
obligation to even talk about it or to give this stuff away in the first place. Just like,

51:31.560 --> 51:36.360
I want no obligation to buy their damn system. I guess that's true. I guess that's true.

51:37.080 --> 51:43.800
All right. Vidpower in chat says, the servers for Mario Kart 8 and Smash 4 online play didn't die on

51:43.800 --> 51:48.360
day one. How come their club Nintendo site is down for a week? And Rama follows that up with

51:48.360 --> 51:51.640
different types of server. And yeah, that's probably the main point. They're probably

51:51.640 --> 51:56.600
completely different server farms, wherever the game servers versus the web servers are. Still,

51:57.160 --> 52:02.120
you know, whatever the technical reason for it, it ultimately doesn't matter. It's frustrating

52:02.120 --> 52:06.680
for the consumer at the end of the day. The specific reason why doesn't really matter

52:06.680 --> 52:09.880
in the grand scheme of things. Anyhow, moving on. Dark soccer.

52:10.520 --> 52:19.240
Well, there's a game series that is well known for its interesting fashion choices on some of

52:19.320 --> 52:27.000
the male characters and proportions for its female characters. And that's Dead or Alive.

52:27.000 --> 52:34.040
Well, Dead or Alive 5 last round is going to be coming out on PC. And well, Yosuke Hayashi was

52:34.040 --> 52:39.160
like, don't mod the game. Well, he's not saying don't mod the game, but he's afraid that modders

52:39.160 --> 52:46.840
are going to be doing immoral things with the game. You don't say. Immorality in Dead or Alive.

52:46.840 --> 52:50.360
Please, please. You've seen the Street Fighter mods already.

52:51.320 --> 52:56.600
That's classic coming from, you know, the studio that develops Dead or Alive Extreme

52:56.600 --> 53:02.760
Beach volleyball, which I'm sure is just a volleyball game and not some excuse to,

53:03.400 --> 53:09.480
you know, have the characters romp around in almost nothing and dressing them up and stuff

53:09.480 --> 53:14.200
like that. I'm sure that in no way do they mean to exploit any of the characters in the game.

53:14.760 --> 53:18.280
So it's dress up dolls. You know, I'm sure that.

53:20.200 --> 53:25.640
You know, I don't know, I'm sure that they haven't kind of provoked some sort of reaction

53:25.640 --> 53:30.280
from their fans based on they know what the fans want. OK, and and they're giving it to them.

53:30.280 --> 53:35.240
And unfortunately, there's nothing you can do. They will mod this so that they're nude.

53:35.240 --> 53:39.000
The same thing happened when Street Fighter 4 came out in PC. They modded that. And yes,

53:39.080 --> 53:43.560
there's new cammy mods and stuff like that. So it's just going to happen.

53:44.520 --> 53:49.080
Well, to go back to what I was saying, he was pretty happy about it coming out on Steam,

53:49.800 --> 53:56.600
but he did put out the warning to the PC modding community. And basically, I'm just going to read

53:56.600 --> 54:02.520
the quote. We have to deal with mod issues from an IP holder perspective. We would ask we would

54:02.520 --> 54:10.280
like to ask PC users to play our game in good moral and manner. Otherwise, we won't be able

54:10.280 --> 54:15.960
to release a title for PC again. That hasn't stopped Capcom, first of all. Capcom is pumping

54:15.960 --> 54:27.240
them out. And I do understand he is appealing to an entire group out there because you yeah,

54:27.240 --> 54:35.640
you have this objectification or this extreme, I'm going to say extreme fashion taste in the game.

54:36.600 --> 54:44.040
And it is, however, the way that they've branded it to be. It has their mark on it. It's what they

54:44.040 --> 54:51.080
control. And putting it out on PC, they're relinquishing a degree of control over their

54:51.080 --> 54:56.680
property. So I understand them wanting to put out a comment on that. At the same time,

54:57.640 --> 55:01.800
it just makes me think that when they put out that comment, they're really just opening the door for

55:01.800 --> 55:06.120
encouragement. Absolutely. That's exactly what I was going to say. It can't be hacked. Watch.

55:06.120 --> 55:12.040
Is I mean, the unfortunate reality of internet toilet bowl culture of which we've seen a lot of

55:12.040 --> 55:20.120
it in the past year. The reality of this is that by making these comments, now it's a race to who

55:20.120 --> 55:25.400
can get the naked boobies first, who can get the booby mod done first. Now it's a race because

55:25.400 --> 55:29.560
day one, it'll be there day one. If the, if the game comes out and has a woman in it,

55:30.600 --> 55:36.040
or even a man, there's going to be a nude patch for it. I want, I want dong mode. I want dong

55:36.040 --> 55:41.160
mode for the guys. It will, if you're going to not mod the women, mod the guys too. Whatever

55:41.160 --> 55:46.360
your request, it will be there. But now it is a, it is a, uh, race to get it done first.

55:46.920 --> 55:53.160
Well, at any rate, the game's going to be out on March 30th. So if you mod it though,

55:53.160 --> 55:56.920
do it. We'll our mods too. Like we want our brand all over.

56:00.680 --> 56:06.280
We want it to be on, um, Oh, on Zach's tentacle head piece thing.

56:07.800 --> 56:13.160
Uh, Brad from pod culture with an interesting suggestion in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

56:13.160 --> 56:18.280
Maybe this is all a ploy. Reverse psychology gets folks talking about the game.

56:19.560 --> 56:24.040
Maybe they've already resigned themselves to the fact that, uh, this game's going to get modded,

56:24.040 --> 56:29.080
but what an awfully nice reminder to all those PC users to a pre-order this game. So you can,

56:29.080 --> 56:36.200
uh, get your boobies and your dongs day one. I wonder, this is just a thought.

56:37.000 --> 56:40.040
And I'm trying to really think of how feasible it is because it would require the game to be

56:40.040 --> 56:46.840
online all the time. If basically what you have in game are just blank models. And then when each

56:46.840 --> 56:53.080
round starts, download texture, load it, you know, but then again, that would require everyone beyond

56:53.080 --> 56:57.480
high speed. And I think that would really be the only way around it. And then all it would do is

56:57.480 --> 57:01.960
just, you know, basically, uh, people would just change coding anyway. But, um, I, you know, try

57:01.960 --> 57:08.040
to think of ways around that, you know, how to make everybody happy. Yeah. All right. Uh, let's

57:08.040 --> 57:13.720
see. Go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. Fifth dream in chat says dongs require

57:13.720 --> 57:18.840
modeling. Nipples only require skins. Oh, now we're getting into the science of it.

57:20.760 --> 57:24.760
Well, you should be able to do ass. You should be able to do ass at least, right? It's more

57:24.760 --> 57:28.520
difficult to do. You know, they've already fly-cammed around dragon age to see if the men

57:28.520 --> 57:34.200
have bits. They don't. They're all Barbie dolls and Ken dolls. But all the women have, you know,

57:34.200 --> 57:44.680
fully complete boobs. So that's unfair. That's unfair. Some people need bulldog in their life.

57:45.800 --> 57:50.360
That wouldn't be me by the way. Just say it. You just say it on behalf of those that need it.

57:51.080 --> 57:57.960
All right. Moving on Loki. All right. So kind of a 180, you know, first, first they were striking

57:57.960 --> 58:06.280
down videos that had, you know, modding stuff for them for Dying Light. Now Techland has said,

58:06.280 --> 58:10.280
hey, you know what? We're going to be actually releasing official mod tools. And sorry,

58:11.080 --> 58:19.640
you know, we didn't, we didn't mean to strike those down. So I don't know. It's just surprising.

58:19.640 --> 58:27.560
Apparently they were intent to stop the be the zombie mode hacks or, or hacks in be the

58:27.560 --> 58:32.200
zombie mode. And they accidentally, they said they accidentally blocked modders from being able to

58:32.200 --> 58:39.400
tweak the game files. Okay. I'll take that. Whatever. That's fine. As long as they've,

58:39.400 --> 58:44.040
you know, fixed the problem in the short amount of time. So good for them.

58:44.840 --> 58:49.000
I haven't had a chance to check out this game yet. I've been hearing a lot of good things about it.

58:49.000 --> 58:53.720
Yeah. I wasn't really on my radar, but. I've been hearing a lot of good things about it as well.

58:54.280 --> 58:59.640
Just haven't, haven't really had a chance to pick it up. And I don't know if I will though,

58:59.640 --> 59:07.720
cause I have still games I haven't played yet. So. All right. Well, moving on to some controversy

59:07.720 --> 59:12.840
from earlier in the week, and this has to do with a league of legends tournament, a league of

59:12.840 --> 59:17.320
legends tournament organizer in the Philippines. Cause remember legal legends is huge all over the

59:17.320 --> 59:22.360
world. Uh, you know, being the free to play game, this game is huge, not just in the U S

59:22.360 --> 59:26.040
but in a lot of Asian territories. So there's, there's tournaments all the time and all sorts

59:26.040 --> 59:30.680
of places. So there was a league of legends tournament organizer in the Philippines. Uh,

59:30.680 --> 59:36.440
and they were going to be doing an event call. It was an all feminine event called the iron

59:36.440 --> 59:40.760
Solari, which, you know, you kind of look at that and you go, okay, you're trying to try to appeal

59:40.760 --> 59:45.400
to get some more lady gamers out there. Try to divert diversify the league of legends

59:45.400 --> 59:50.840
audience. This is a good thing, right? Well, if, uh, you go to the website for,

59:50.840 --> 59:56.200
and I might be mispronouncing this Garina, uh, Philippines, and you look at the outlines there,

59:56.200 --> 01:00:04.600
uh, there was a very interesting, uh, quote about their views on, um, certain types of women that

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:11.560
they wanted to limit as participating. And the quote goes like this quote for any events we do,

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:16.280
we always want to make sure we are able to have an inclusive environment where no one feels left

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:21.960
out. And of course, for everybody to enjoy on this angle, we believe that allowing more to be

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:27.160
eligible to join us is obviously the answer. And as many of our female teams have expressed

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:31.880
on the other hand, for any competitions, we seriously look at ensuring there's a fair level

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:37.480
playing field for all participants. And there are arguments and concerns from other participants

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:44.280
who dispute that lesbian, gay, transgendered women members may probably have some unfair

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:50.920
advantage. So what was written in the rules that there would be a maximum of one gay or

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:57.640
transgendered woman to participate on a team for a single day. So you can't swap somebody out for

01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:03.880
someone else or what have you. And as you can imagine, Tumblr didn't take to this very well

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:06.920
as they shouldn't. And a lot of Twitter and a lot of people were like, what?

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.480
Intelligent person shouldn't take to that very well.

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:15.400
They're basically, unfortunately, when you say a comment like this, you're essentially saying

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:22.520
gay women and transgendered women are not women. That's, that's, that's the problem with what they

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:26.360
said. That's essentially what they said. Uh, and they, they, you may not say, well, that's not what

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:29.640
they said. That's, that's the message they sent across when they, when they said something like

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:36.120
that. And that is, that is wrong. And I would also like to know, how are they going to fucking

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:41.560
know? Like, will there, will there be an examination? Will there, will there be a gayity

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:46.680
test? Will they be taking the teams to Home Depot and see who knows what to do? I'm kidding. I'm

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:52.600
kidding. Don't, don't write your hate emails. But in all seriousness, like how the fuck were they

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:56.200
supposed to enforce something like this in the first place? And where the hell does a rule like

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:59.960
this come from anyway? Like they, you know, they validate those hundred dollar bills. They just

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:04.520
swipe it across and it changes colors. You know, that's how they know. They use litmus paper.

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:12.920
Oh, you have a pH of minus five. You're gay. Is that why secret is pH balanced for a woman?

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:19.000
I always wanted to know. Anyway, look, look, look, I'm joking. I'm joking. We're having

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:25.160
fun with this. Don't, don't get, don't get real mad, but are you the gay? But our point is here,

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:31.080
here's my question is that my understanding is one of the top Starcraft 2 players out there

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:37.320
is a transgendered woman. Am I correct in that? I'm almost positive. Maybe the chat room knows this,

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:41.240
but I believe there's like a top ranked Starcraft 2 player out there that I know I've seen.

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:45.720
And in reality, there's probably more than one, but there's one that's coming to mind that happens

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:52.760
to be a transgender female. Is this rule because of jealousy of said individual? Is that what this

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:59.800
is? Cause that's kind of what my reaction is to all this is, is that it's like jealousy or

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:04.200
something. I don't know. I don't know what the fuck this is. There are people out there who

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:09.800
judge others based on what genitalia they have. End of story. Those people are called bigots.

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:18.280
End of story. Yeah. Could it be, I have to throw this out there because this is another country

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:26.920
we're talking about. Could it be these cultural things coming into play that we're a little more

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:31.400
progressed here in the States? I mean, we still have a long way to go, but we're more progressed

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:34.440
here in the States with our viewpoints on some of these topics than maybe they are in the

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:38.120
Philippines. Just throwing it out there. I mean, maybe that's something that coming into play with

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:45.800
this as well. So anyhow, as you can imagine, the internet got real mad about this as they should

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:51.960
and Riot Games ended up sending out a tweet pretty quick, same day. And Riot Games, who makes

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:57.320
League of Legends, if you weren't aware, tweeted, LGBT players are welcome at official League of

01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:03.560
Legends tourneys. We're working with our partners to ensure consistency with our values across all

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:08.920
regions. And so Riot Games was pretty much came down and said, oh, hell no, they're not going to

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:14.360
use our name with that kind of rule in a tournament basically. And sure enough, this got switched

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:20.120
around pretty darn fast. There was an update that came out where the restrictions were removed.

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:25.480
And there was a more full response, but you can imagine it was a lot of apologizing.

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:32.120
So there it is. Akuma JP in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, he replied,

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:40.680
woof, he is gay. Alan Alchemy in chat says, the cultural difference argument is kind of derailing

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:45.400
though, because even if it's true, it doesn't make it any less offensive. No, you're right.

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:50.280
And I don't mean to make it sound like it's an acceptable excuse. I'm just trying to sit here

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:56.520
and go, how on earth does a reasonable person think publishing that on the, as a rule was a

01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:02.040
good idea? Like, how did they even think that this was something they could get away with? And you

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:09.320
know, I'm just like, is it a cultural thing? Well, and there's, there's a good, I hate to say it,

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:13.080
but there's a good example of what I mean when I say the cultural differences. You'd expect

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:18.840
something like this out of Russia, but FYI, it doesn't make it right there either. All right.

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:24.520
And Raginator says, I wouldn't say that we're more progressed. Westboro Baptist Church,

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:29.160
need I say more? What have they done lately? Well, I mean, have people just finally stopped

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:32.920
giving them attention? I think, I think, but here's the thing about the Westboro Baptist

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:38.120
Church is that for most people, again, though, the Westboro Baptist Church is the village idiot.

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:42.680
Like, we kind of look at them and we laugh at them and go, oh, those idiots. Look at,

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:48.440
they're so stupid. I mean, this is the price we pay for free speech is some people are going to

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:54.440
say some real stupid shit. Look at these guys. You know, I think it's to the point where nobody takes

01:05:54.440 --> 01:06:02.200
those people seriously. Anybody that does is in the vast minority, vast minority. And they have

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:06.760
a right to say their thing, but we have a right to call them idiots because of it, which the Westboro

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:11.800
Baptist Church are, in fact, idiots. And for the record, the rule of free speech only

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:19.720
relates to speaking out against the government in approved social forums. It doesn't mean

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:23.960
freedom of consequence. That's right. Someone can point their finger at you and point how big of an

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:30.440
idiot you are and put it out on public news and people can, you know, pull contracts away from

01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:37.160
you. What's his fuck name from Duck Dynasty, whoever that dumb shithead is. You know, people

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:43.320
can hold you accountable for what you say and freedom of speech doesn't have jack shit to do

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:51.080
with it. Yeah. So anyway, at least it does make me happy. Like on a personal note, obviously I

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:55.800
make it no secret on this program here that I happen to be a gay man who's, you know,

01:06:56.360 --> 01:07:01.320
who loves video games just as much as you do and does the show and so forth. And I got to say,

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:07.880
though, like I can see the change from when I was in high school. Like high schoolers today,

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:12.280
it's so different than it was when I was in high school. Like not to be all like, get off my lawn

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:18.520
and all that. But I mean, this comes from a place of, I am happy to see that in society today,

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:24.920
Westboro Baptist Church are the idiots. They are mocked. They are the ones that any decent,

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:29.240
reasonable human being looks at that and goes, they're stupid. You know, where, you know,

01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:33.960
20 years ago, it might not have been so much the majority. So I feel like as a society,

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:39.720
we have come a long way and I hope other parts of the world catch up real darn quick for the

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:47.480
sake of people like me in those other places. Anyhow. Ikuma JP says, OMG, Rob is gay? Get out.

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:54.520
No, it's my show. I'm staying right here. All right. Dark Soccer, what do you have for us on

01:07:55.320 --> 01:08:00.760
hopefully a just better front? Well, I do have something. Game Developers Conference

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:09.400
will have the Indie Mega Booth Showcase. Woo. And this actually conference is on March 2nd through

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:14.760
6th at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, which we walked by many, many, many, many, many times

01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:23.480
at GamerX, did we not? So there's going to be over 150 different indie game studios there.

01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:27.960
We'll be showing off a few different ones. There's going to be 15 demos as well, too.

01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:32.360
So I will go ahead and list those off. There's That Dragon Cancer

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:40.520
by Ryan Green and Josh Larson. Gemini by Echo Stone Games. I guess it's Machineers by

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:49.640
Lojica Apps. Megaton Rainfall by Pentadimensional Games. Pillar by Michael Arts. Inside My Radio by

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:56.920
Steven Studios. No Pineapple Left Behind by Subaltern Games. Push Me, Pull You by House House.

01:08:56.920 --> 01:09:01.160
Okay, I just like a company called House House. House House. The Flock by-

01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:07.640
Jamie and the House House. The Flock by Vogelslap, which just makes me think we need now

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:16.200
a little in-house studio called Vogslap. Vogslap, baby Vogslap. Simpsons, anyone?

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:23.160
Yeah. Legends of Ice Involved by Adderducks Entertainment. Mushroom 11 by Untame. Fate

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:29.800
Tectonics by Golden Gear. That's a cool name. Tenertia by Condescent Games. Throw Trucks with

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:35.400
Your Mind by- Okay, I want that game right now. Latwire wins GDC. Throw Trucks with Your Mind.

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:40.840
And then Extreme Exorcism by Golden Ruby Games. I don't know, that one sounds kind of rad.

01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:45.880
It's not just exorcism, it's extreme exorcism. What if they put those two games together?

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:53.240
And it was like psychic ghost truck throwing exorcism tergeist. Lowkey, get on it.

01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:59.000
Do the thing! There literally are no ideas that are too crazy for my game.

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:05.560
Now you'll just have to figure out how to do that. That's it. I'm gonna combine all of these games.

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:13.000
Well, at least a few of them. So we have Throw Dragons with Your Mind

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:22.760
from pineapples that are possessed. There's my game. In a place called Ice Involved. The end.

01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:26.920
Did you say you're gonna just combine a bunch of video games together?

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:28.200
You know what that makes me think of.

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:43.320
Rob, do you know how people like you sometimes? What?

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:47.160
Special snowflakes. I do want to have a level like that,

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:49.800
but I don't know. That's gonna be kind of difficult to do.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:53.240
I'm at the point where I like legitimately miss Katamari Damacy.

01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:54.440
I do. Me too.

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:58.280
I don't know, but then I need them to just go back to their roots.

01:10:58.280 --> 01:10:59.400
I miss Noby Noby Boy.

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:04.360
Just think though what they could do with Katamari now that you can handle so many more

01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:10.920
particles and stuff on screen with the new consoles. They'd be awesome.

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:13.080
I just wondered, has Girl reached Earth yet?

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:17.960
Was I the only person constantly playing Noby Noby Boy on my phone?

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:19.560
Out of this crowd, yes.

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:21.480
I thought Girl was going away from...

01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:23.880
No, Girl was supposed to be reaching Earth, I thought.

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:26.760
No, I thought she was going out further into the galaxy.

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:28.760
I don't know where Girl is. I'm gonna see where Girl is.

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:30.680
All right, you look her up. Let us know.

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.040
Girl, where are you?

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.080
Girl, where you at?

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:36.440
Did Loki really say that?

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:38.040
No use of it.

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:48.520
There actually is a thing called Noby Noby Stats, and Girl right now is at Uranus.

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:57.080
Good night, everybody. That's gonna do it for another episode of Orange

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:59.320
Lounge Radio. See you next week.

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:00.120
As of December.

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:02.760
All right, just kidding.

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:03.000
All right.

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:10.200
And there is your Noby Noby Boy update.

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:10.680
Thank you.

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:16.360
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and see what's coming to Uranus

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:17.000
real soon.

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:19.720
That's just wrong.

01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:21.640
Loki, would you like to start?

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:25.000
Uh, I guess, if I must.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.760
I honestly don't know what's coming out this week.

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.760
I don't think anything is, actually, now that I think of it.

01:12:29.800 --> 01:12:31.800
Let's evolve around here or something.

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:32.680
I have no idea.

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:34.520
I'm gonna say nothing.

01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:37.720
Nothing's coming out?

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:38.680
I'm just gonna say that.

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:42.520
Do you just make up the news now and just...

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:44.040
Uh, don't we all?

01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:47.480
All right, well, let's travel.

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:51.480
Oh, you're right. Good point. Good point.

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.720
Let's travel over to Japan and check out-

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:55.400
I'll let you know later on if something's actually coming out.

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.800
Let's go to Japan and see how much longer girls are getting.

01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:00.040
I said, um, I thought Evolved was coming out and Evolved-

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:01.960
I was gonna say, wasn't Evolved this week?

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:02.200
Okay.

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:08.120
Well, I mean, technically you buy the game,

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:13.160
but you're gonna be continually buying this game in DLC form over the next three months, right?

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:13.800
Pretty much.

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:16.440
So, I mean, yeah, that's kind of true.

01:13:16.440 --> 01:13:18.280
No, actually, I did lie.

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:20.040
There are things coming out this week.

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:23.400
I should forget that Nintendo is releasing a new 3DS.

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:24.840
So, I mean, there's that, I guess.

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:30.440
But yes, the new 3DS will be coming out on Friday,

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:33.800
as well as some other games to go with that.

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:38.680
But Evolved, yeah, they have that coming out on PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.

01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:43.240
What else we got here?

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:47.000
Majora's Mask on new 3DS?

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.320
Or, well, I guess that's actual just regular 3DS.

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.800
That's not a new 3DS-only game, is it?

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:53.320
No.

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:53.880
Can't be.

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:56.440
They don't have any new 3DS-only games right now,

01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:59.000
which is another reason why would you buy a new 3DS.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.600
Xenoblade in April, supposedly.

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:03.160
Supposedly?

01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:05.240
Whatever.

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.280
Okay, I don't need that.

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:09.560
I think that's it.

01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:11.960
It's just pretty much, um, oh, let's see here.

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:16.920
Yeah, that's, um, it's pretty much just Evolved in the new 3DS.

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:19.000
All right, much better when you don't make it up, Loogie.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
All right, traveling to Japan and looking at what's coming out.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.120
As far as you're aware.

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:30.280
In Japan this week, Sengoku Musou 4-2 in a regular and treasure box.

01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.120
I don't know why it's 4-2.

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:34.360
I guess that's like Final Fantasy 13-2.

01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:36.760
I hear you like sequels, so here's a sequel for your sequel.

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:40.760
I think that's got to be what this is, but Sengoku Musou is Dynasty Warriors, right?

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:44.680
So for whatever reason, number four is getting a sequel, so there it is.

01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:47.960
That is coming out in Japan this week in regular and treasure box.

01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:49.560
Maybe it's 42.

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:51.960
No, it's definitely 4-2.

01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:56.760
Anyhow, Lords of the Fallen also coming out this week in Japan.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:57.640
You can check that out.

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:05.320
Over on the Xbox One, nothing this week in Japan, which, you know, makes sense.

01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:10.760
On the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan, that same Sengoku Musou 4-2 or whatever is out in Japan,

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:16.360
as well as a rewrite, and Dead or Alive 5 is right around the corner in Japan.

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:18.200
Not this week, but next week.

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:24.760
Looking at the Wii U, nothing in Japan for the Wii U until we get to Mario Party 10 in March.

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:28.600
So nothing this coming week, unless there's a digital release I'm not aware of yet.

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:30.680
But on the Vita, there's a lot more to look forward to.

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:33.320
You've got Sengoku Musou 4-2 is there as well.

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:36.680
Yukio no Uryoshi is there as well.

01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:42.680
And Gaoken Heaven Boys Love Scramble is out as well on the PlayStation Vita.

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:46.520
Last but not least, on the Nintendo 3DS this week in Japan,

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:55.640
Nanatsu no Tazai Shinjutsu no Enzai comes out this week on the 3DS in Japan.

01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:00.040
There's also some new cover plates making their way to Japan this week.

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:05.480
And The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask 3D on Valentine's Day for your loved ones.

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:09.000
I was going to say Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate 3DS will be coming out in the US.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.240
And of course, we're not going to expect any of those faceplates

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:12.520
since we don't get any faceplates.

01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:15.400
I should actually play that demo since I've got it now.

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:21.800
I don't know. It seems like if you're not really into it, the Monster Hunter series,

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:22.840
this one isn't going to win you over.

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.760
Well, check it out then. You might like it.

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:30.040
Well, we do have a few things.

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:35.080
On the 11th is Unmechanical Extended on PS4 and PS3.

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:38.440
And on the 13th, we have Lucius II The Prophecy,

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:44.280
and Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate, and The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask 3D.

01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:47.800
All right, just a few more stories for you guys.

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:49.960
And then the classic game of the week.

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:51.160
But first, Loki.

01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:55.640
Yes, unfortunately, don't have a good story for you.

01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:57.720
But this is kind of sad.

01:16:57.720 --> 01:16:59.800
I was kind of shocked when I heard about this.

01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:02.120
I was coming out of work, actually.

01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:09.080
And so Monty Oom, a guy who I always will remember

01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:15.320
as the guy that was behind some of the really awesome machinima videos that they had.

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:20.600
Dead Fantasy was a series I loved from him, as well as Haloroid.

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:24.760
He did a really awesome fight sequences.

01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:32.040
Also, of course, RWBY, which is a new series.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.040
Yeah, and that's actually on Netflix now.

01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:38.760
But unfortunately, Monty Oom passed away.

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:43.320
He passed away due to a severe allergic reaction

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:46.520
during a simple medical procedure that left him in a coma.

01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:48.520
And unfortunately, he wasn't able to recover,

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:49.880
and he passed away in the hospital.

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:51.960
So it's unfortunate.

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:54.520
He also worked on Red vs. Blue.

01:17:56.280 --> 01:18:00.520
And I don't know, just did a lot of good stuff for Rooster Teeth.

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:03.000
So he was only 33 years old.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.120
On top of that, though, even a little bit more hitting home,

01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:11.480
is he was actually pretty good at freestyle in DDR and Pump It Up.

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:13.640
I was not aware of that.

01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:15.960
So yeah, I actually have some videos out there for that.

01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:18.600
Unfortunate.

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:21.640
It's funny, I had actually dreamed about working with this guy

01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:25.960
for my pitch for the new DDR game I had a while back.

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:29.720
But unfortunately, that'll never happen.

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:31.480
So that's it.

01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:36.440
And it's so hard to hear about this type of stuff.

01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:37.480
Especially, I mean, there was...

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:38.520
He's only 33.

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:39.720
Well, and he's only 33.

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:40.520
That's younger than me.

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:44.280
That's so, like, just stunning to hear that.

01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:46.680
And especially if something that was, like, really, I mean,

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:48.920
just sounds like it was complications from...

01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:49.800
An allergic reaction.

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:51.960
I mean, that's just like, what can you do about that?

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:52.920
That's so scary.

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:58.120
And then, I mean, this right on the heels of the news about Andrew Yoon last week.

01:18:58.120 --> 01:18:59.400
So, I mean, this is just...

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:01.320
That's just tragedy left and right.

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:05.480
So, you know, our thoughts go out to the families

01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:08.520
and those directly affected by the past things

01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:10.120
that we've been feeling in the gaming industry

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:11.720
these past couple weeks.

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:14.440
But certainly, a lot of us are feeling a loss right now.

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:17.560
So our respects to these individuals.

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:21.960
Rama in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com points out

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:24.600
they're having a big RWBY, R-W-B-Y,

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:28.280
memorial photo shoot for Monty at Katsucon this weekend.

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:29.880
Well, that's kind of cool that they're going to have

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:33.320
these tributes showing up in these very appropriate places.

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:36.040
Well, here's the other thing that kind of, like, is pretty awesome.

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:40.200
As for honoring Monty, we do that in our own way.

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:43.880
In lieu of flowers or gifts, we ask that you simply do something creative.

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:45.960
Use your imagination to make the world a better place

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:49.560
in that way you can or in any way that you can.

01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:51.480
So, pretty inspirational.

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:54.920
They have, like, a nice tribute video on roosterteeth.com.

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:57.960
And check it out, it's pretty awesome.

01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.480
And that's just you and Hunter Matt pointing out

01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:01.800
that I marathoned RWBY this week.

01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:04.200
So a lot of people checking that out in tribute.

01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:07.080
All right, well, the show must go on.

01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:09.640
So I'm going to continue on to our next news story tonight.

01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:11.720
So I'm going to go to a completely different direction here

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:13.640
and talk about something that's probably a follow-up

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:15.960
to something Loki had suggested earlier in the show

01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:19.800
about gold and silver Mario amiibo.

01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:24.680
And yep, gold and silver Mario amiibo look like this is a thing.

01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:29.000
This is coming from a forum post

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.480
where these figures were dug up,

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:34.360
like the pictures were dug up on Nintendo's site.

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:37.320
All we know so far, though, is the box art.

01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:41.080
Nintendo, of course, has not made any comment on these figures as of yet.

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:43.720
And of course, some people are wondering, are they a Photoshop?

01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:45.960
I don't know. Maybe.

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:49.640
But I want to say somebody saw this on, like, an inventory sheet.

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:52.120
It's possible.

01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:56.680
They do this type of thing with Disney infinity had crystal figures.

01:20:57.640 --> 01:20:59.560
So they're like different versions.

01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:03.800
They also have, you know, variants for Skylanders where they're more rare.

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.440
I would not doubt that they're doing this, of course.

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:09.000
Gives you an opportunity to sell Mario two or three more times.

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:12.520
Is this something now you suggested earlier in the show?

01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:16.360
We were talking about Club Nintendo closing and what the successor could be.

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:18.360
You mentioned it'll involve amiibo.

01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:19.160
Are we looking at it?

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:20.920
Possibly.

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:24.440
I don't know if this would be something that's exclusive to that, but maybe.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.240
I would think that we'd see something maybe like this.

01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:31.640
Variants or even exclusive characters through there.

01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:34.920
You know, maybe some, like, more niche characters.

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:35.480
Oh, God.

01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:40.360
Like, you're gonna get extra things that unlock if you have a gold one or a silver one?

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:41.000
Oh, God.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Or it'll just be a skin in the game.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:46.120
It'll be just like your gold Mario in Smash Brothers now instead.

01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:48.920
Does that mean I might get a pink gold peach amiibo?

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:53.960
Because apparently that's a character Mario Kart eight.

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:54.760
Maybe.

01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:56.120
I guess anything's possible.

01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:59.720
But there's a difference between silver Mario and metal Mario, right?

01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:00.840
Or I guess.

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:01.480
I don't know.

01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:03.560
I mean, it doesn't look like right there.

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:06.520
It just looks like they've pained one silver pain, one gold.

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:07.020
Yeah.

01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:10.120
Kaijuto in chat over at live.vongnetwork.com says,

01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:13.400
I'm gonna wear gold Mario amiibo to show off my bling bling.

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:17.400
Oh, is that I could wear it around my neck like an accessory.

01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:18.360
Is that something I could do?

01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:19.560
Okay.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:20.600
Flava Flav.

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:23.240
Maybe that's a Dragon Con outfit in the making there.

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:25.400
I'm gonna dress up as an amiibo.

01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:28.280
All right.

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:29.000
Nobody will get it.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:29.400
That's fine.

01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:29.960
That's cool.

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:30.360
I understand.

01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:32.120
You have to have a stand with you.

01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:34.360
A little black circle you can stand on.

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:34.680
Yeah.

01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:35.000
Right.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:35.240
Yeah.

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:35.960
A platform.

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:36.920
All right.

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:41.400
Anyhow, I'm sure plenty more to come as we get closer and closer to E3.

01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:45.080
A lot of this will be trickling out or maybe even the next Nintendo Direct,

01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:45.640
whatever that is.

01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:47.560
They tend to have them about once a month, so we'll see.

01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:50.840
Japan got a Nintendo Direct this week all about Xenoblade,

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:52.360
but we didn't get it for whatever reason.

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.080
Xenoblade's not coming out until April here.

01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:55.880
I guess that's true.

01:22:55.880 --> 01:22:56.760
I guess that's true.

01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:57.000
All right.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:57.800
Well, let's move on.

01:22:57.800 --> 01:22:59.640
We're gonna go to a simpler time.

01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:03.320
There was no amiibo or near field communication.

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:08.200
You unlock things in the game by hitting like up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right,

01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:08.920
BA, start.

01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:09.480
That was that.

01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:09.960
It was a very...

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:11.640
You held buttons while you put in your quarters.

01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:12.520
That's exactly right.

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:13.960
It was a more simpler time in gaming.

01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:16.840
We're gonna visit that in a segment we call the classic game of the week.

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:22.760
Dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey,

01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:27.240
you should play this game because like it's a classic and stuff.

01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:28.680
It's a little sticky.

01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:32.200
And sometimes it ties into the news as this week's title does.

01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:32.760
Right, Dark soccer?

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:33.160
Yes, it does.

01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:36.600
I was fully inspired by the news and I was also surprised I haven't done it before.

01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:38.040
So what is the classic game of the week?

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:39.240
The game is Dead or Alive.

01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:44.360
It came out in 1996 as a fighting game done by Tecmo.

01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:48.680
And the first entry in the series by Team Ninja.

01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:55.000
And it came out for the Sega Saturn and Sony Playstation in 1998.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.760
The Saturn version was Japan only.

01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:04.440
Yes, this is the game that gave us the very, very, very bouncing boobies.

01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:08.760
That you could actually input like your age and everything and change it.

01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:14.120
So yeah, the Dead or Alive had different choices of gameplay as well.

01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:16.920
That really set it apart from the other 3D games at the time.

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:22.840
It really focused on speed and simple commands and reaction time.

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:29.720
So the countering system was very unique as well because it used different type of commands

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:31.800
to go with the type of counter you were going to do.

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.200
You also had different holds in there.

01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:38.760
You had offensive hold and defensive hold, which you would either hold back or forward

01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:40.840
depending on how you're going to do that.

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:42.680
So you'd either force them away or counter damage.

01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:47.800
You also had these things called danger zones that were around the edges.

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:56.680
So that, for example, you could send a character flying by slamming them onto the danger zone

01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:58.120
and they would bounce up.

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:04.360
To avoid that you would have to do a defensive roll called ukemi.

01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:09.080
And the game also had this ongoing plot.

01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:10.120
I mean, it's still going.

01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:15.480
I just sat out for 3 hours one night about a month and a half ago reading the plot of

01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:17.000
Dead or Alive, I swear.

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:25.240
So basically, it's just that you have different main characters.

01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:28.360
There's Kasumi, Ayane.

01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:37.240
You have the wrestler, Base Armstrong, Bayman, Genfuu, John Lee, Kasumi...

01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:38.280
I said Kasumi.

01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:40.920
Leifang Raidou, who is Ayane's dad.

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:43.000
Ryu Hayabusa from...

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:46.520
Ninja Gaiden.

01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:47.160
Yes, thank you.

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:47.660
Brain.

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:50.360
You have Tina, who's a wrestler as well.

01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:52.840
And Zack, who dresses up like a Teletubby in later games.

01:25:55.240 --> 01:26:02.920
And basically Tomonobu Itagaki was saying that he just really did not like how fighting

01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:04.520
games were designed at the time.

01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:07.160
He missed the old arcade style play.

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:10.040
He wanted to take fighting games a different direction.

01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:15.640
So since he had been there with Tecmo for a while, they're like, hey, go for it.

01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:17.800
So this was the result.

01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:24.200
The original game ran on Sega Model 2 arcade board, but the backgrounds were actually polygonal

01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:24.700
models.

01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:32.200
And the Saturn made use of bitmaps and parallax scrolling the same way that Retro Fighter

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:32.700
2 did.

01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:43.020
So this was basically the first time Sega licensed their hardware to a third party company

01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:44.220
for this arcade release.

01:26:46.380 --> 01:26:53.740
And then, of course, we had the PlayStation version, which was the one that Bass and Ayane

01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:54.240
were in.

01:26:55.260 --> 01:26:56.940
And it had different music.

01:26:56.940 --> 01:27:02.140
And this is the version that we got out in North America on March 31st, 1998.

01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:04.300
Europe got it in July 1998.

01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:06.620
I'm still giggling like a child over here.

01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:09.180
I just haven't really watched this game be played in a long time.

01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:13.100
I haven't really played a Dead or Alive game since it was first out on Xbox 360.

01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:14.860
I never played the original.

01:27:14.860 --> 01:27:18.940
It came out in a time, that kind of dark period where I wasn't really doing a lot of gaming.

01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:24.540
And I'm looking at this just watching, again, Kasumi and the way her boobs bounce in this

01:27:24.540 --> 01:27:25.900
little playthrough video we have here.

01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:29.980
And it's so stupid and over the top.

01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:32.700
Boobs don't move like that, but it's funny.

01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:36.620
Well, there actually is a whole Tumblr called Boobs Don't Work That Way.

01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:41.180
But usually it's more for just pointing out Rob Liefeld's bad art.

01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:47.580
Another thing, Tecmo also put out Dead or Alive Plus Plus for arcades that was based

01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:54.300
off the PlayStation version, had updated gameplay, and then it expanded a little bit more for

01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:55.260
Dead or Alive 2.

01:27:55.500 --> 01:28:02.460
It was listed in 2011 by Complex as the seventh best fighting game of all time.

01:28:02.460 --> 01:28:08.780
And then it was remade as Dead or Alive Ultimate that revamped the Saturn version for Xbox,

01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:12.620
along with the updated Dead or Alive 2 in the same packaging.

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:18.540
And so they just made the graphics smoother, changed the sound from stereo to surround,

01:28:18.540 --> 01:28:20.940
and let you play with Xbox Live Online gaming.

01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:29.260
Um, and so this was actually this and Dead or Alive 2 became the second fighting game

01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:30.300
with online play.

01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:32.220
And that's it.

01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:34.700
All right.

01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:35.740
Dead or Alive.

01:28:35.740 --> 01:28:37.980
Don't have to be confused with that really gross horror movie.

01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:40.700
Or, you know, You Spin Me Right Round.

01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:43.100
Although that is a great song.

01:28:43.100 --> 01:28:43.740
It is.

01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:45.980
There's a really good mashup of that and Danny Minogue.

01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:47.980
I think I've heard that before.

01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:48.300
Yep.

01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:49.020
Come to think of it.

01:28:49.020 --> 01:28:49.260
All right.

01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:49.660
There it is.

01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:51.420
Your classic game of the week.

01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:58.300
Dead or Alive, a game that admittedly I did not play enough of, I think, when I was younger.

01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:02.060
So I'll have to go back and check that out on Jamie's request.

01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:03.580
Do you have a system I can play it on, Jamie?

01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:06.140
Uh, I think.

01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:07.180
Yeah, somewhere.

01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:08.700
You want to know what, though?

01:29:10.620 --> 01:29:17.100
If any woman out there wants to imagine what it's like to be a character in Dead or Alive,

01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:18.540
take off your bra and go for a jog.

01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:20.780
Imagine that while you're just standing still.

01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:25.660
I wouldn't recommend it.

01:29:27.980 --> 01:29:32.460
Thank you, Tecmo, for unrealistic expectations.

01:29:33.340 --> 01:29:35.820
Please don't make our don't mod our women nude.

01:29:35.820 --> 01:29:39.180
Is this something you've tried at some point in your life, Dark Sakura?

01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:40.540
You know what?

01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:43.100
It's just you don't know.

01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:46.780
I'm not even going to talk about it because you guys will never know

01:29:47.740 --> 01:29:49.340
the pain that we go through.

01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:51.260
Guys are wimps compared to girls.

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:54.460
Our insides attack us every month.

01:29:56.460 --> 01:30:01.740
We have huge weights on the front of our upper bodies that make our backs hurt.

01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:05.580
And on top of that, them bitches out there are making babies.

01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:06.300
Try that once.

01:30:07.180 --> 01:30:07.740
Can't do it.

01:30:08.540 --> 01:30:09.180
All right.

01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:09.580
All right.

01:30:10.220 --> 01:30:13.420
We are going to, uh, we're going to stop there and take a break.

01:30:13.660 --> 01:30:17.820
Uh, before we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio after a quick break.

01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:21.500
And when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, uh, we will get into some rapid

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:22.380
fire news.

01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:27.740
Uh, we'll get to the Fugu question of the week, uh, our emails, um, some news, uh, some

01:30:27.740 --> 01:30:32.540
follow-up to some last week's news and, uh, somebody getting their just desserts.

01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:34.380
And I like hearing about this type of stuff.

01:30:34.380 --> 01:30:37.820
And maybe we'll get Dark Sakura to talk about boobies more.

01:30:37.820 --> 01:30:38.300
We'll try.

01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:39.820
I'm kidding.

01:30:39.820 --> 01:30:40.300
I'm kidding.

01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:40.540
All right.

01:30:41.180 --> 01:30:41.420
What?

01:30:41.900 --> 01:30:43.260
You guys have boobs too.

01:30:43.260 --> 01:30:44.300
That is true.

01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:44.540
Okay.

01:30:44.540 --> 01:30:45.900
I can talk about boobs if you want.

01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:47.740
All right.

01:30:47.740 --> 01:30:51.900
We'll be back after a break with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:30:58.460 --> 01:31:05.340
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live here at vognetwork.com for this number

01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:10.700
586 episode, February the 8th of 2015.

01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:15.820
And, uh, we're going to start off part B here with our newest segment here on the show.

01:31:15.820 --> 01:31:18.300
We call it the forum follow-up.

01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:29.340
Uh, every week we post some extended discussions from topics on our show over at forums.vognetwork.com

01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:33.500
and you can participate in these discussions and we follow up on some of the big discussions

01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:35.260
from last week right now.

01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:39.740
And, uh, I also kind of tried to guess what big things might come up this week.

01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:43.500
Cause after all over on the forums, you can post about whatever you want.

01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:45.500
You don't have to wait for me to post.

01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:49.100
You can post something and then maybe it will get picked up here on the show.

01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:50.540
So let's get to it.

01:31:50.540 --> 01:31:55.900
A follow-up post on the Nintendo let's play revenue sharing, which for obvious reasons

01:31:55.900 --> 01:31:57.260
was a hot topic last week.

01:31:57.260 --> 01:31:59.420
I think we have an email coming up on it tonight as well.

01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:03.660
There's obviously a lot of opinions on Nintendo's let's play and the revenue share program.

01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:08.220
A rebel romance over on our forum said, I don't see Nintendo as a bad guy here.

01:32:08.220 --> 01:32:09.340
Do they need the money?

01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:13.660
Probably not, but if someone is making a profit off of something that they created, then I

01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:15.340
feel royalty should be paid.

01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:19.260
I think the music example is an excellent one, not just for licensing, but also for

01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:21.100
BMI, ASCAP, et cetera.

01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:25.740
These performance associations distribute royalties fairly when someone's work is played

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:27.740
or being played as it were.

01:32:27.740 --> 01:32:29.900
Maybe gaming needs some neutral ground like that.

01:32:29.900 --> 01:32:31.900
So everyone is protected and profiting.

01:32:31.900 --> 01:32:33.820
I don't think the YouTube qualifies though.

01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:40.140
And Act Deft on the same topic said, if something, a lot of the companies are making, let me

01:32:40.140 --> 01:32:41.100
start over, sorry.

01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:44.620
If something, a lot of the companies making strikes and copyright claims to people on

01:32:44.620 --> 01:32:50.380
YouTube should follow Nintendo's example, work with the people, not against them.

01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:54.220
Although following up to this was just kind of my own thought real quick.

01:32:54.940 --> 01:32:57.420
It doesn't seem like Nintendo's solution is really working.

01:32:58.300 --> 01:33:00.940
You know, A, it's too convoluted.

01:33:00.940 --> 01:33:06.700
B, they're having these problems where it's taking people way too long to sign up for

01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:06.940
them.

01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:10.540
It's putting really crazy restrictions on people's channel.

01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:12.940
Nintendo's solution doesn't work.

01:33:13.580 --> 01:33:17.980
I still believe what I said last week, you know, not to rehash the whole debate, but

01:33:17.980 --> 01:33:20.540
last week I said I believe Nintendo is owed a cut.

01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:26.940
And I still do believe that, but this solution, particular one, isn't working for anybody

01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:29.820
and should probably just be put out to pasture already.

01:33:29.820 --> 01:33:33.180
But apparently it's really popular because nobody else can seem to sign up for it.

01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:38.300
Maybe people are just excited because either A, they're like, hey, I didn't think to try

01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:40.540
and get money before, so now I'm going to try and do it.

01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:44.940
Or B, they just, I guess, want to sign up for Nintendo.

01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:49.340
Maybe Nintendo is going to expose some of their partners and they'll have that official

01:33:49.340 --> 01:33:49.820
tie in.

01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:50.220
I don't know.

01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:56.140
Anyhow, I knew the Legend of Zelda TV series and the Netflix thing, we talked about the

01:33:56.140 --> 01:33:56.620
part of the show.

01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:57.820
I knew that was going to be a huge topic.

01:33:57.820 --> 01:34:00.220
So we had a post over on that on the forums as well.

01:34:00.220 --> 01:34:04.460
We had some follow-ups from Tigerclaw who said, I'm curious on how are they going to

01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:07.580
cast Link as a kid, a teen or adult?

01:34:07.580 --> 01:34:12.060
I heard the TV show is being described as a family-friendly Game of Thrones.

01:34:12.060 --> 01:34:14.700
By family-friendly, I would guess nobody dies.

01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:22.860
Well, now Tigerclaw, Bambi's mother died, so they could still do something if they wanted

01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:23.420
to.

01:34:23.420 --> 01:34:29.100
Uh, but I, I, I just, you know, again, when they say it's going to be like Game of Thrones,

01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:32.460
I think they just mean it's going to be a medieval fantasy and that's it.

01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:34.780
I don't think you're going to see any, a lot of the other stuff.

01:34:34.780 --> 01:34:38.140
And again, as I said earlier in the show, I don't necessarily think Link and Zelda are

01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:38.780
even a given.

01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:40.780
Why do they have to even be in it?

01:34:40.780 --> 01:34:44.220
I mean, maybe Zelda could be in it because she is princess after all.

01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:49.900
But I mean, I don't know, like I just, how would the series go on and on and on?

01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:50.700
What would continue it?

01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:51.100
I don't know.

01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:55.500
I think there's a lot of things they could do with it, but it's just way too early.

01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:59.180
We don't even know if Netflix really got cast green lit, who knows?

01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:03.500
Flacco Jones says on the Legend of Zelda TV series,

01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:09.340
while I don't for a second think this rumor is true, I'll answer for the sake of participating.

01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:11.420
Netflix is throwing money around like crazy.

01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:13.580
Nintendo would very much like more money.

01:35:13.580 --> 01:35:17.820
So if it is happening, which it isn't by the way, it's because Nintendo is getting a lot

01:35:17.820 --> 01:35:20.940
of money and likely has a lot of creative control as well.

01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:24.060
As far as the quote, will this be good question?

01:35:24.060 --> 01:35:26.060
You never know until you see the finished product.

01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:30.540
I'm like halfway through there Flacco, because I get why you're totally saying this is full

01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:31.420
of crap.

01:35:31.420 --> 01:35:35.580
And I think people are jumping to conclusions for sure.

01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:38.380
But I also think there's an element of where there's smoke, there's fire.

01:35:38.380 --> 01:35:41.020
And there is the Wall Street Journal reporting on this.

01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:45.420
I'm sure someone at Netflix has loose lips about, you know, what's happening so that

01:35:45.420 --> 01:35:48.220
people will, you know, will hopefully invest in Netflix and so forth.

01:35:48.300 --> 01:35:54.380
But again, all they could be shooting is a concept pilot to get Nintendo to sign off

01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:54.860
on it.

01:35:54.860 --> 01:35:58.220
I mean, we don't even know if that partnership's really been established yet.

01:35:58.220 --> 01:36:03.340
So anything is possible or perhaps it's true.

01:36:03.340 --> 01:36:05.900
And they're already run into series with this.

01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:06.540
Who knows?

01:36:06.540 --> 01:36:07.340
Who knows?

01:36:07.340 --> 01:36:11.260
But I kind of doubt that I'm kind of with you Flacco that this is not as far along,

01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:13.660
at least as people seem to think it is.

01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:17.500
Anyway, those are some of the comments from our forums in the forum follow up.

01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:21.420
Let's go around now with some rapid fire news and quickly talk about a few more topics

01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:21.900
from the week.

01:36:21.900 --> 01:36:22.780
Loki.

01:36:22.780 --> 01:36:23.180
All right.

01:36:23.740 --> 01:36:31.420
So anyways, this is kind of a relief in case you may be on the fence about buying Final

01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:34.300
Fantasy Type-O Square Enix.

01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:37.580
Apparently, I want to say they're going back on what they said originally.

01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:43.580
Apparently, they're going to be releasing a Final Fantasy 15 demo alongside Type-O HD.

01:36:43.580 --> 01:36:48.140
So you won't necessarily have to buy the game, I'm guessing.

01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:49.580
I like that you call it Type-O.

01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:53.180
I thought it was Type-0, but I kind of like Type-O.

01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:55.500
It's Final Fantasy Type-O.

01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:57.180
It's Final Fannery Type-O.

01:36:58.700 --> 01:37:00.140
Or Dragon Quest Type-O.

01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:00.620
There you go.

01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:02.380
Final Fanta.

01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:03.020
Great flavor.

01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:05.420
Dagon Quest Type-O.

01:37:07.580 --> 01:37:12.540
But if you want to play the demo first, then you'd want to buy the game because it's going

01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:20.060
to be released with Type-0 first, but then it'll be coming out later on.

01:37:21.340 --> 01:37:22.140
I don't know.

01:37:22.140 --> 01:37:22.780
It's kind of nice.

01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:25.820
I'm not sure if I'd like Type-0.

01:37:26.460 --> 01:37:28.460
I'll buy it because it's Final Fantasy, though.

01:37:28.460 --> 01:37:31.420
Yeah, I'm going to buy it just because it's Final Fantasy and I have a problem.

01:37:33.180 --> 01:37:35.820
And I'm really looking forward to that demo, that's for sure.

01:37:35.820 --> 01:37:36.380
Yeah.

01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:37.100
So this is pretty cool.

01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:43.980
There's a Kickstarter for a game called Drift Stage, which is this retro-styled drift racing

01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:52.780
game, and it looks all neon and kind of 80s-looking stuff, almost like an old early polygon arcade

01:37:52.780 --> 01:37:53.580
racing game.

01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:58.460
Well, they finally hit their stretch goal for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita versions

01:37:58.460 --> 01:38:00.300
of the game, which is awesome.

01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:05.340
It's also going to come out on Windows, Mac, and Linux, but they're saying that...

01:38:07.820 --> 01:38:09.340
That should be coming out next year.

01:38:09.340 --> 01:38:10.460
So that's pretty awesome.

01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:11.900
And the game looks really sweet.

01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:13.580
And I guess their Kickstarter just ended.

01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:18.540
I think they had like $50,000 of their $30,000 goal, so that's pretty cool.

01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:19.040
Nice.

01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:28.060
And then they're going to have Boku special editions for Mortal Kombat X, and including...

01:38:28.060 --> 01:38:31.740
They've got everything from...

01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:33.260
What's the most expensive one here?

01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:36.300
Up to $179.99.

01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:42.860
So for starting off with the cheapest one, $89.99, the Mortal Kombat X Premium Edition,

01:38:42.860 --> 01:38:48.860
which will be available download only, includes the Kombat Pack and the game.

01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:51.340
What the fuck is the Kombat Pack?

01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:53.500
I have no idea.

01:38:53.500 --> 01:39:00.220
Oh, four additional add-on playable characters from classic combatants to icon guest characters.

01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:05.180
Are we going to see more like, you know, Jason Voorhees and stuff in this?

01:39:05.180 --> 01:39:06.620
Because that was pretty awesome last time.

01:39:06.620 --> 01:39:08.380
Those were some awesome crossovers.

01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:09.580
Freddy Krueger.

01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:10.460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:39:10.460 --> 01:39:12.060
So yeah, I'd love to see Jason or...

01:39:14.380 --> 01:39:17.020
I keep wanting to say Bruce Campbell, but that's not the character's name.

01:39:17.020 --> 01:39:20.220
You know, it's Ash from Evil Dead.

01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:21.580
Yeah, it'd be awesome.

01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:28.620
And then, of course, the next step up would be the Mortal Kombat X Limited Edition,

01:39:28.620 --> 01:39:35.180
which includes, you know, an exclusive Scorpion skin designed and inspired by the Cold War,

01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:41.340
I guess, and then the Kombat Pack, and that's coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,

01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:44.380
which will be $94.99 for that one.

01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:47.420
Then if you want to spend even more money and need a statue,

01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:50.860
they're going to have the Mortal Kombat X Collector's Edition with a K,

01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:56.060
because it's Mortal Kombat, and they've got an exclusive Scorpion figure,

01:39:56.780 --> 01:40:04.460
and the skin, the Kombat Pack, and that'll be out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One for $149.99.

01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:09.180
Then there's even one further beyond that that'll be exclusive to Amazon,

01:40:09.980 --> 01:40:15.260
and I think for Europe, and that's also the Collector's Edition over there,

01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:19.660
and they have the statue, the Mortal Kombat X Blood Ties comic book volume one,

01:40:20.380 --> 01:40:23.660
skin, the Kombat Pack, and all the other fun stuff for $179.99.

01:40:23.660 --> 01:40:24.620
That's just way too much.

01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:30.140
Fifth Dream in chat talking about Mortal Kombat X over at live.vognetwork.com says,

01:40:30.140 --> 01:40:33.340
Katniss Everdeen and Mortal Kombat X, you heard it here first.

01:40:33.340 --> 01:40:37.020
I don't know, I think I realize those movies are kind of violent,

01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:39.260
but I think Mortal Kombat X might be too violent.

01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:42.140
They're still PG-13 films, are they not?

01:40:42.140 --> 01:40:44.300
So it might not work.

01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:47.260
What would be a good guest character for Mortal Kombat?

01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:51.420
I don't know.

01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:52.780
Mama from Mama's Family.

01:40:56.060 --> 01:40:57.500
She just hit people with her purse.

01:40:58.540 --> 01:40:59.040
Wow.

01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:01.820
Didn't we do a list list on this once a long time ago?

01:41:01.820 --> 01:41:03.100
We had to have, I don't know.

01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:03.740
I know.

01:41:03.740 --> 01:41:05.340
Flo from Mel's Diner.

01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:05.740
All right.

01:41:05.740 --> 01:41:07.340
She'd kiss them with her grits.

01:41:07.340 --> 01:41:08.700
Anyway, let's move on.

01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:12.060
Speaking of classic nostalgia, I think this is interesting.

01:41:12.060 --> 01:41:15.820
Apparently a new Toejam and Earl game is actually in development.

01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:19.500
Now, I don't, I'm a little confused at this because I thought we just had

01:41:19.500 --> 01:41:21.820
really bad news about Sega last week.

01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:24.380
So how could there be a new Toejam and Earl game unless,

01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:27.420
I guess the license has been, you know, maybe to try and get some money back.

01:41:27.420 --> 01:41:29.740
Maybe they let this license out to somebody else.

01:41:29.740 --> 01:41:30.540
I don't know.

01:41:30.540 --> 01:41:35.660
But, uh, yeah, apparently, uh, there's been some, uh, uh, content released

01:41:35.660 --> 01:41:39.420
from the developers, some concept art, uh, for what this Toejam and Earl

01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:42.540
might look like, but, uh, God, it's been so long since the original.

01:41:42.540 --> 01:41:43.040
I don't know.

01:41:43.580 --> 01:41:44.380
Could, could be interesting.

01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:44.780
Could be interesting.

01:41:44.780 --> 01:41:45.580
Would anyone care?

01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:49.500
I think there'd be a lot of people checking it out for the curiosity factor.

01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:49.980
Yeah.

01:41:49.980 --> 01:41:50.780
Beyond that though.

01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:53.260
I mean, I just, I don't know.

01:41:53.260 --> 01:41:54.700
Well, if the, if the game is good.

01:41:54.700 --> 01:41:56.860
Just don't fuck it up like you did Sonic.

01:41:56.860 --> 01:41:57.260
Okay.

01:41:57.260 --> 01:41:58.060
That's all I gotta say.

01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:00.140
Just don't fuck it up like you did Sonic.

01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:03.580
Uh, well, I don't, I don't think it's Sega doing it cause, uh, things are

01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:06.060
changing over at Sega as we talked about last week.

01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:06.380
All right.

01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:09.100
And fifth dream in chat says the people who created it are still around.

01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:12.140
So maybe it went back to the original developers and just be published by

01:42:12.140 --> 01:42:14.140
somebody else who knows anyhow.

01:42:14.140 --> 01:42:19.340
Um, speaking of, uh, publishing something old, new again, this is very interesting.

01:42:19.340 --> 01:42:24.380
Um, if you are a Blizzard fan, you probably have a copy of Starcraft two

01:42:24.380 --> 01:42:27.900
because you know, Blizzard or you love your Starcraft, but you know, Starcraft

01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:31.020
kind of has its roots in the Warcraft universe.

01:42:31.020 --> 01:42:34.380
Warcraft is obviously something very different now with World of Warcraft.

01:42:34.380 --> 01:42:38.140
Although I think there's a lot of people hoping someday for a Warcraft four.

01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:42.780
But what's very interesting is that now Warcraft three models are

01:42:42.780 --> 01:42:44.860
available in Starcraft two.

01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:49.500
And if you didn't know, Starcraft two has this huge arcade area where

01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:50.940
people can make their own games.

01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:53.820
And I know I've talked at length on the show before about some of the games I

01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:55.100
enjoy in the Starcraft arcade.

01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:57.260
Like star jeweled is my personal favorite.

01:42:57.260 --> 01:42:58.700
It's bejeweled mix of Starcraft.

01:42:58.700 --> 01:42:59.500
It's fun.

01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:04.700
Um, but now you'll be able to make a games with Warcraft three characters

01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:06.140
in the Starcraft arcade.

01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:12.060
So I would think you could essentially remake Warcraft three or even fricking

01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:16.540
defense of the ancients, which is the mod that brought us legal legends,

01:43:16.540 --> 01:43:18.460
dota two heroes of the storm.

01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:21.340
All of that is to thank from elite defense of the ancients.

01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:24.380
You could see all that in Starcraft two's arcade now.

01:43:24.380 --> 01:43:26.380
So that's a, it's going to be very interesting.

01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:28.300
It's on the PTR now.

01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:29.420
So enjoy that.

01:43:31.180 --> 01:43:33.020
One more piece of news here.

01:43:33.020 --> 01:43:35.980
I know some people very excited about music games.

01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:38.620
Some people also very excited about persona.

01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:41.820
Well, there was some new information released on persona this week.

01:43:41.820 --> 01:43:44.380
There was a new trailer for persona five for one.

01:43:44.380 --> 01:43:47.260
And I know that's got a lot of people excited, especially those that are super

01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:52.380
into the persona games, uh, but also of particular interest, let's not forget

01:43:52.380 --> 01:43:55.180
about the persona for dancing all night.

01:43:55.180 --> 01:43:55.820
Thank you very much.

01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:58.140
That's the music game that's coming out as well.

01:43:58.140 --> 01:44:01.580
And you know, there's a lot of songs that are in this, of course, you know,

01:44:01.580 --> 01:44:02.140
persona.

01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:05.740
Remember if you played this game, even though it's like a JRPG, it has very

01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:08.780
kind of like modern sounding music that makes up the soundtrack.

01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:12.140
So some of that is in the game, but there's a lot of remixes

01:44:12.140 --> 01:44:13.340
that are in the game.

01:44:13.340 --> 01:44:17.660
Of particular note, there's a song called time to make history, which

01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:22.540
will have the Akira Yamaoka remix in persona for dancing all night.

01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:26.780
Also a heartbreak heartbreak from Tawatay.

01:44:26.780 --> 01:44:27.900
You guys know him as Tawatay, right?

01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:29.660
He was like a huge remixer years ago.

01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:30.540
Probably still does.

01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:33.740
He was a part of, um, group is in the heart.

01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:34.240
D-Light.

01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:36.380
Remember that with Lady Miss Kira.

01:44:37.420 --> 01:44:38.540
Tawatay was a part of that group.

01:44:38.620 --> 01:44:41.180
So he also has a remix in the game there, but Akira Yamaoka.

01:44:42.060 --> 01:44:42.780
So there you go.

01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:45.980
That means I have to have this game like forever, right?

01:44:45.980 --> 01:44:47.900
It's like, if you weren't convinced now, now you are.

01:44:48.540 --> 01:44:49.020
There it is.

01:44:49.660 --> 01:44:50.300
Dark Sakura.

01:44:50.300 --> 01:44:51.020
What do you have for us?

01:44:51.900 --> 01:44:52.400
Stuff.

01:44:53.260 --> 01:44:56.700
Well, uh, this is like, I guess the Kickstarter thing is just getting

01:44:56.700 --> 01:44:59.020
bigger and bigger, but this one is really good.

01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:06.620
There is a Kickstarter, uh, floating around to, uh, help, uh, basically get,

01:45:06.620 --> 01:45:11.420
um, a new, uh, uh, DJ Max Technica out and about.

01:45:12.140 --> 01:45:17.740
Um, they're wanting to put out, uh, something to the range of 30 to 40 units.

01:45:17.740 --> 01:45:20.780
And so they are looking to the fan base.

01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:25.420
So you can actually find a trailer for this called, uh, Touching Sounds.

01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:28.780
So keep your eyes open for that or hanging out on Kickstarter.

01:45:29.740 --> 01:45:34.700
And also, uh, something about, uh, Hironobu Sakaguchi who, you know,

01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:40.380
created Final Fantasy, he's going to be getting a, uh, a lifetime, uh, sorry,

01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:43.580
a game developer's choice award for lifetime achievement.

01:45:43.580 --> 01:45:47.020
And I'd say very, very well deserved.

01:45:48.620 --> 01:45:53.100
And last but not least, yay, happy news.

01:45:53.100 --> 01:45:53.900
Yay.

01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:55.180
Well, kind of yay.

01:45:55.180 --> 01:45:58.700
Um, Leland, he can't, can't learn.

01:45:58.700 --> 01:45:59.580
He really can't.

01:46:01.740 --> 01:46:03.580
We all know all the shit he's done, right?

01:46:04.300 --> 01:46:07.580
Well, they, uh, uh, revised-

01:46:07.580 --> 01:46:12.540
In case people forgot, there was the whole, uh, he was a huge voice behind

01:46:12.540 --> 01:46:14.460
the whole video games are too violent.

01:46:14.460 --> 01:46:19.660
He led that campaign to try and make, uh, retailers have to-

01:46:19.660 --> 01:46:21.020
God, I don't even remember all the details.

01:46:21.020 --> 01:46:22.060
It was so long ago.

01:46:22.060 --> 01:46:28.460
It was about, uh, you could, you could only sell games that had certain content in it.

01:46:28.460 --> 01:46:30.380
You had to like ID people basically.

01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:35.420
But the fact of what is adult content was so vague that there was a lot of problems

01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:38.940
with it and it ended up going all the way to the Supreme court in California, spent

01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:44.140
a lot of money, wasted it basically defending this law where, you know, parents need to

01:46:44.140 --> 01:46:47.260
take the active role in what their kids are playing anyway.

01:46:47.260 --> 01:46:49.020
So Leland, he was a huge part of this.

01:46:49.020 --> 01:46:51.020
And then behind the story, he was trafficking guns.

01:46:51.660 --> 01:46:57.100
Well, apart from that, they've, uh, the big indictment on this is that he was

01:46:57.100 --> 01:47:02.620
allegedly depositing checks from criminal enterprises for secretary of state campaign

01:47:02.620 --> 01:47:05.820
fund, which even more.

01:47:06.380 --> 01:47:10.540
So he's pleaded non guilty, first of all, not guilty.

01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:15.500
And, um, he is going to be going to federal trial on June 22nd.

01:47:16.300 --> 01:47:18.540
Jury selection begins on June 1st.

01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:24.860
A pretrial hearing is April 30th and, uh, he's being tried for 13 different counts.

01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:27.260
So you know what?

01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:31.100
I want him nailed, nailed.

01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:36.540
He's going to be put away for a long, long time, I think.

01:47:36.540 --> 01:47:38.940
Except he's going to buy his way out of jail and only serve a year.

01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:44.780
Whereas there's rapists out there who, uh, you know, also only get a year, but you have

01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:48.140
people who are smoking pot, who were in jail for 30 years, you know, just saying.

01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:50.140
All right.

01:47:50.140 --> 01:47:51.100
Justice America.

01:47:51.980 --> 01:47:55.500
Well, let's do some justice to our listener feedback in a segment.

01:47:55.500 --> 01:47:57.340
We call you like that transition in the same way.

01:47:57.340 --> 01:48:01.420
We call the frugal question of the week, where we take Facebook and Google plus and put it

01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:02.780
together and you get frugal.

01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:14.860
We're going to hand on over to our communities where we ask a question every week and read

01:48:14.860 --> 01:48:17.020
some of our favorite answers here on the show.

01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:19.580
And this week has to do with modding.

01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:23.500
After all, Dark Soccer read us that story earlier about the Dead or Alive 5.

01:48:23.500 --> 01:48:27.100
And please, please don't mod this game on PC.

01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:32.460
If you have bad moral choices, please, please don't do immoral things to our characters.

01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:33.660
Yeah, right.

01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:37.900
So we want to ask our listeners, look, have you ever used a controversial mod?

01:48:37.900 --> 01:48:42.380
I don't just mean nudity, but you know, nudity, super cheating, something that altered the

01:48:42.380 --> 01:48:45.980
game in a way that the creators probably didn't want you to do.

01:48:46.060 --> 01:48:47.900
What was the mod and why?

01:48:48.700 --> 01:48:51.500
Loki's laughing over there every fucking day, right?

01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:55.260
Well, aren't you kidding?

01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:57.820
Maybe, maybe the listeners know of some you haven't heard of yet.

01:48:57.820 --> 01:48:59.900
So I bet you're excited to hear some of these answers, right?

01:49:00.780 --> 01:49:01.500
Of course.

01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:01.820
All right.

01:49:01.820 --> 01:49:06.300
Let's start on Google plus tonight since I was horrible and neglected them a couple

01:49:06.300 --> 01:49:06.700
of weeks ago.

01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:12.540
I'll start on Google plus tonight with Josh Y who replied, well, I didn't really use a

01:49:12.540 --> 01:49:13.100
mod.

01:49:13.100 --> 01:49:15.500
I had some fun with action replay.

01:49:15.580 --> 01:49:17.820
It's the UK equivalent to a game shark.

01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:19.900
It was super powerful on the Amiga.

01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:22.300
It even had a D compiler.

01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:23.260
Oh yes.

01:49:23.260 --> 01:49:26.300
Decompiling games is something I'm sure they don't want you to do.

01:49:27.900 --> 01:49:28.940
I don't think they do.

01:49:28.940 --> 01:49:33.580
I don't even mind the action replay did evolve and come out for other systems in the US.

01:49:33.580 --> 01:49:37.580
Yeah, we did get it in the US, but it was how else did I play my Saturn games?

01:49:37.580 --> 01:49:38.080
Yeah.

01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:39.420
Uh, let's see.

01:49:39.980 --> 01:49:45.420
Uh, I'm always afraid I'm saying this name wrong, but Martin D replied and said,

01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:49.900
I tried the hot coffee mod for grand theft auto San Andreas, but it was just a silly

01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:50.620
mini game.

01:49:50.620 --> 01:49:54.140
And I doubt the creators didn't intend for that content to be found because the code

01:49:54.140 --> 01:49:56.300
was in there in the first place.

01:49:56.300 --> 01:49:57.740
People can mod whatever they want.

01:49:57.740 --> 01:49:58.700
It's just a video game.

01:49:58.700 --> 01:50:00.300
People OMG boobs.

01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:06.220
And I imagine Martin is probably, I think if I remember right, he's one of our listeners

01:50:06.220 --> 01:50:07.420
over in Belgium.

01:50:07.420 --> 01:50:10.860
And if I am correct, what?

01:50:10.860 --> 01:50:12.460
I think it's just Martin.

01:50:12.460 --> 01:50:13.580
Is it Martin?

01:50:13.580 --> 01:50:14.300
Okay.

01:50:14.300 --> 01:50:18.780
He's, uh, over the, the double a throws me and I'm thinking, but I'm probably overthinking

01:50:18.780 --> 01:50:19.100
it.

01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:22.700
So anyway, uh, he's over in Belgium and my understanding is over there.

01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:26.620
Boobies ain't no big deal is no big deal.

01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:27.900
Is no big deal.

01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:28.540
Right.

01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:28.860
All right.

01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:34.940
Anyhow, uh, entertainment replied and said, I used action replay game, shark game, genies

01:50:34.940 --> 01:50:39.260
and other devices like that until the console manufacturers found a way to disable such

01:50:39.260 --> 01:50:40.140
devices.

01:50:40.140 --> 01:50:44.220
I've also used game save manipulation programs to give me a fuck ton of experience in MLB

01:50:44.780 --> 01:50:46.620
2k 11 and final fantasy 13.

01:50:46.620 --> 01:50:51.820
I had limited results with fantasy 13, but I had fabulous results with MLB 2k 11.

01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:55.260
I was like playing with a baseball player who took steroids.

01:50:55.260 --> 01:50:57.180
Well, that's cheating entertainment.

01:50:57.180 --> 01:50:57.500
All right.

01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:01.980
Let's get some of our answers over on Facebook.

01:51:01.980 --> 01:51:07.900
Andy R says for a while I had mods for league of legends that only changed character skins.

01:51:07.900 --> 01:51:09.980
The skins were only client side.

01:51:09.980 --> 01:51:12.060
For example, I was the only one that saw them.

01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:17.580
But given that Riot sells skins for the game, they ended up killing those mods in later

01:51:17.580 --> 01:51:18.060
patches.

01:51:18.620 --> 01:51:21.900
Yeah, selling you skins is part of how they keep the game free to play.

01:51:21.900 --> 01:51:25.180
It's they probably don't like, even if it's only you, they probably don't like that you

01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:26.300
were able to change that.

01:51:26.300 --> 01:51:27.580
And it's, uh, it's interesting.

01:51:28.300 --> 01:51:33.580
Uh, Alan Alchemy replied and said, I almost find this story beneath notice due to the

01:51:33.580 --> 01:51:34.940
studio bringing it up.

01:51:34.940 --> 01:51:39.660
Do they know what the stock swimsuits you can unlock in Dua volleyball party look like?

01:51:39.660 --> 01:51:43.980
But anyway, yes, I've used nude and sex mods for both Dragon Age Origins and Skyrim, the

01:51:43.980 --> 01:51:48.780
latter of which has mods for scalable dong size with real time flop physics for when

01:51:48.780 --> 01:51:50.060
you run in the nude.

01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:50.860
Wow.

01:51:50.860 --> 01:51:54.140
Mostly I run these for the comedy factor and just to see how they look.

01:51:54.140 --> 01:51:56.700
90% of them get uninstalled after messing with them.

01:51:56.700 --> 01:52:01.420
The ones I keep are largely skimpy, sexed up, super impractical armors.

01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:05.900
You know, like what the Dua women wear in the retail release for the dudes.

01:52:05.900 --> 01:52:10.220
Because as a gay man and a PC owner, I feel I should be able to tailor my fantasy setting

01:52:10.220 --> 01:52:14.140
as I see fit and a little male exploitation to balance the scales a bit.

01:52:14.140 --> 01:52:15.740
Can't be a bad thing, right?

01:52:15.740 --> 01:52:17.740
Well, whatever helps me sleep at night, I guess.

01:52:20.220 --> 01:52:23.020
Dark soccer does male exploitation help you sleep at night?

01:52:23.020 --> 01:52:23.420
Oh yeah.

01:52:24.460 --> 01:52:25.980
Gives me some really good dreams there.

01:52:25.980 --> 01:52:28.380
Do you think, do you think about it before you go to bed every night?

01:52:29.580 --> 01:52:34.140
For the record, I have done exactly some of those same mods because it's absolutely ridiculous

01:52:34.140 --> 01:52:35.420
to watch the dong cup.

01:52:36.140 --> 01:52:37.980
Have you ever done a nude Garris?

01:52:37.980 --> 01:52:38.380
Admit it.

01:52:38.380 --> 01:52:39.980
Have you ever actually haven't.

01:52:39.980 --> 01:52:40.620
Okay.

01:52:40.620 --> 01:52:48.940
But you know, Turian skin did exist as a model for when they were developing mass effect.

01:52:48.940 --> 01:52:51.340
It's just, they never actually implemented in the game.

01:52:51.340 --> 01:52:53.420
But when they first did the character designs, they had

01:52:54.220 --> 01:52:57.580
naked Turians just saying, just saying.

01:52:57.580 --> 01:52:58.220
All right.

01:52:58.220 --> 01:53:01.900
Jason C replied and said, I definitely use character skin mods in Skyrim.

01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:05.580
Bethesda makes some of the ugliest character models around and it was really distracting

01:53:05.580 --> 01:53:07.740
and hard to enjoy a game that looks so awful.

01:53:08.620 --> 01:53:12.460
A surfing Slurpee replied and said the DOA producer should be more concerned with mods

01:53:12.460 --> 01:53:15.820
that give unfair advantage in multiplayer, not cosmetic ones.

01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:18.300
Modding the game to see boobies or dongs isn't immoral.

01:53:18.300 --> 01:53:20.380
It's just for fun, not titillation.

01:53:20.380 --> 01:53:23.980
I've only used mods in wow to supplement poor UI design.

01:53:23.980 --> 01:53:26.860
The thing though with wow is that they really encourage it in wow.

01:53:26.860 --> 01:53:28.620
That's why I kind of didn't name them in the post.

01:53:28.620 --> 01:53:32.060
But I mean, I've used, I've certainly used mods in wow too.

01:53:32.060 --> 01:53:35.100
And there have been things in wow that they didn't like.

01:53:35.900 --> 01:53:40.300
Like there was one where you could like draw on the ground and they shut that one down.

01:53:40.300 --> 01:53:41.500
Blizzard didn't like that.

01:53:41.500 --> 01:53:45.420
So I guess, I guess even though wow embraces mods, there have been some naughty ones.

01:53:46.140 --> 01:53:50.220
On a side note, says surfing Slurpee, who cares about DOA?

01:53:50.220 --> 01:53:53.660
I've only briefly played a DOA title on a PS2.

01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:57.660
Seems to me that Tecmo is trying to stir up some publicity for a stale franchise.

01:53:58.540 --> 01:54:02.940
Save your money for Mortal Kombat X, uppercuts to the crotch for the win.

01:54:04.300 --> 01:54:07.580
Ragenator says, I can't say that I've ever modded a game.

01:54:07.580 --> 01:54:09.420
I have no real interest in doing so.

01:54:10.220 --> 01:54:13.900
Ragenator, even after all the booby and dong talk tonight, no interest at all?

01:54:13.900 --> 01:54:14.460
No, it's okay.

01:54:14.460 --> 01:54:17.180
He wants the swollen balls mod.

01:54:17.180 --> 01:54:17.900
You know what?

01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:21.180
Outside of MMOs, I don't ever really do it either.

01:54:21.180 --> 01:54:25.420
Like I'll look over, I'll look over my shoulder and I'll see Alan like with his dong mod in

01:54:25.420 --> 01:54:27.180
Skyrim and I'll have a laugh and whatever.

01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:29.180
But then I just go right back to whatever I was doing.

01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:31.420
Like I don't, I don't really get too hardcore in that stuff.

01:54:31.420 --> 01:54:33.500
You know, I modded the hell out of Mass Effect.

01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:34.700
Well, yeah.

01:54:34.700 --> 01:54:37.740
And now that I think about it, he, but I made Alan do it for me.

01:54:37.740 --> 01:54:41.500
So Alan potted it, but he showed me the HD textures.

01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:42.460
He showed me the HD textures.

01:54:42.460 --> 01:54:43.660
And wasn't it worth it?

01:54:43.660 --> 01:54:44.460
It was kind of worth it.

01:54:44.460 --> 01:54:45.420
Have you ever fly cammed?

01:54:46.060 --> 01:54:46.780
No, never done that.

01:54:46.780 --> 01:54:49.100
Fly cam's pretty cool because you can find some interesting stuff.

01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:49.600
I bet.

01:54:50.540 --> 01:54:51.260
I bet.

01:54:51.260 --> 01:54:55.340
Didn't you have some Tumblr posts of a fly cam thing that went like huge?

01:54:55.980 --> 01:54:56.860
I did.

01:54:56.860 --> 01:55:03.180
It was a picture on the refrigerator in the Normandy and Mass Effect 2 that has a picture

01:55:03.180 --> 01:55:08.940
of, it has the, the circle with the slash on it on a Turian's head and guns.

01:55:08.940 --> 01:55:12.700
So all I did was put a big catch on it that said no Turians, no guns.

01:55:14.380 --> 01:55:15.260
900 posts.

01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:17.420
Like the fuck Tumblr?

01:55:17.420 --> 01:55:18.220
Tumblr is weird.

01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:19.020
All right.

01:55:19.020 --> 01:55:23.340
Well that one, and I had the other one that was this one's intimate apparel.

01:55:24.220 --> 01:55:26.220
That was a Hanar sex shop.

01:55:26.220 --> 01:55:26.780
I remember that one.

01:55:26.780 --> 01:55:28.220
Yeah, the Hanar sex shop.

01:55:28.220 --> 01:55:29.660
Only see it if you fly cam.

01:55:31.100 --> 01:55:33.100
It's probably, there's probably a reason for that.

01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:36.860
Anyway, Fifth Dream in chat says, first thing I do when I play, I'm sorry, not chat, uh,

01:55:36.860 --> 01:55:41.980
on Facebook says, first thing I do when I play a Sims game is remove the sensor mosaic.

01:55:41.980 --> 01:55:43.340
It's just super distracting.

01:55:43.340 --> 01:55:44.620
Oh my God, me too.

01:55:44.620 --> 01:55:46.300
I don't care if they look like Barbie dolls.

01:55:46.300 --> 01:55:47.180
It's just so much better.

01:55:48.220 --> 01:55:50.300
I want to watch my Sims taking a piss.

01:55:50.300 --> 01:55:50.940
Just saying.

01:55:50.940 --> 01:55:53.180
Ew, what kind of weird?

01:55:53.180 --> 01:55:53.660
What?

01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:55.500
Did you just say that on the radio?

01:55:56.860 --> 01:56:00.620
I was being facetious.

01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:01.100
Oh my God.

01:56:01.100 --> 01:56:03.180
Travis Donovan is cutting that clip right now.

01:56:06.700 --> 01:56:07.340
Sarcasm.

01:56:07.340 --> 01:56:07.820
Hello?

01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:08.380
I know.

01:56:08.380 --> 01:56:08.780
I know.

01:56:08.780 --> 01:56:11.580
But I actually do get rid of that just because it actually is distracting.

01:56:12.700 --> 01:56:14.860
From watching them take their piss.

01:56:14.860 --> 01:56:18.060
No, from watching them bathe or having woohoo.

01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:21.900
Oh boy.

01:56:21.900 --> 01:56:25.100
The mod for Sims 3 that turns woohoo into fuck.

01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:29.100
It's on the little suggestion bar.

01:56:29.100 --> 01:56:30.700
Let's just call it what it is.

01:56:30.700 --> 01:56:31.500
All right.

01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:33.180
It is a night here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:56:33.180 --> 01:56:35.820
There's something, I don't know, something in the storms.

01:56:36.380 --> 01:56:37.580
It's parasitic balls.

01:56:37.580 --> 01:56:40.780
Bringing, bringing in the funny or the strange.

01:56:40.780 --> 01:56:41.020
All right.

01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:42.620
Anyway, that's the food question of the week.

01:56:42.620 --> 01:56:48.460
Facebook.com slash orange lounge radio or google.com slash plus orange lounge radio.

01:56:50.380 --> 01:56:54.540
To register participation for this week's episode of orange on radio at vog network.com.

01:56:54.620 --> 01:56:56.220
Use the passphrase wash.

01:56:57.180 --> 01:57:00.540
Let's get into some more news before we get to some phone calls later on in the show.

01:57:01.100 --> 01:57:01.500
Loki.

01:57:02.060 --> 01:57:06.700
So we hear all these stories about people getting swatted and how it's terrible and stuff.

01:57:06.700 --> 01:57:09.660
Well it's about time that we finally heard news that one of those

01:57:10.220 --> 01:57:17.340
swatting one of the people behind this swatting has gotten arrested and that's the case in

01:57:17.740 --> 01:57:27.900
I guess a online gamer who's known by the name Fame God who had swatted some people

01:57:27.900 --> 01:57:35.980
in the past by making up murder scenarios and having the police go out to their homes

01:57:35.980 --> 01:57:39.020
and stuff and of course not finding anybody.

01:57:39.740 --> 01:57:42.140
I guess they had tracked him down.

01:57:42.540 --> 01:57:50.860
He had used a computer to contact Naperville's 911 center back in July of last year and basically

01:57:50.860 --> 01:57:59.580
said that there is a murder happening at a home in the city and so they sent there the

01:57:59.580 --> 01:58:04.780
police out there and of course there was no one there and so they eventually tracked him

01:58:04.780 --> 01:58:14.140
down to Vegas and they arrested him and took his computers and all that fun stuff.

01:58:15.820 --> 01:58:16.940
Thank you.

01:58:16.940 --> 01:58:20.460
Sometimes the justice system works.

01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:21.420
Thank you.

01:58:21.420 --> 01:58:23.580
Apparently I think they should spank him.

01:58:23.580 --> 01:58:25.100
Make an example.

01:58:25.100 --> 01:58:29.900
He's been charged two counts of computer tampering, one count of intimidation,

01:58:29.980 --> 01:58:36.540
computer fraud, identity theft, disorderly conduct, and also was waiting extradition

01:58:36.540 --> 01:58:39.740
to Illinois and faces up to five years in prison if convicted.

01:58:41.740 --> 01:58:44.620
He's still probably going to get a longer sentence than rapist.

01:58:45.580 --> 01:58:49.980
He's been a very, very naughty boy and he needs to go to the naughty step immediately.

01:58:50.700 --> 01:58:51.420
Very naughty.

01:58:53.020 --> 01:58:57.420
Your fascination with Supernanny is amazing.

01:58:57.980 --> 01:59:01.260
Since I don't have kids, I just imagine it's like Supernanny.

01:59:01.260 --> 01:59:02.220
Am I correct?

01:59:02.220 --> 01:59:05.180
No, it's 100% more whiny.

01:59:06.940 --> 01:59:09.100
Have you tried putting your children on the naughty step?

01:59:09.100 --> 01:59:10.060
Oh, he doesn't care.

01:59:12.140 --> 01:59:13.180
Timeouts don't work.

01:59:14.780 --> 01:59:19.980
All right, let's see, so I'm really glad to hear one of those little turds got caught

01:59:19.980 --> 01:59:24.380
and you know, if you do that kind of crap, you kind of have it coming.

01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:27.100
So it's hard for me to feel sympathy for that guy.

01:59:27.820 --> 01:59:32.540
Anyway, shifting gears here a little bit, talking about Sony Online Entertainment,

01:59:32.540 --> 01:59:36.220
which essentially is gone as of this week.

01:59:36.220 --> 01:59:38.220
Now, hold on, they didn't like close or anything.

01:59:38.220 --> 01:59:39.660
They just transitioned a little bit.

01:59:39.660 --> 01:59:45.260
That's because Columbus Nova, an investment management firm, actually bought Sony Online

01:59:45.260 --> 01:59:46.220
Entertainment this week.

01:59:46.220 --> 01:59:49.740
It is now Daybreak Game Company.

01:59:49.740 --> 01:59:53.660
So Sony Online Entertainment or SOE is now Daybreak Game Company.

01:59:53.660 --> 02:00:01.020
So this would affect games like PlanetSide 2, EverQuest Next, and Landmark, DC Universe

02:00:01.020 --> 02:00:01.580
Online.

02:00:01.580 --> 02:00:04.460
I mean, this is a lot of games that are impacted by this.

02:00:04.460 --> 02:00:10.780
And already within moments, I mean, I'm looking at a post on the official PlanetSide 2 forums

02:00:10.780 --> 02:00:12.620
over at station.sony.com.

02:00:12.620 --> 02:00:17.900
And they even say on here, this means PlayStation, Xbox, mobile, and more.

02:00:17.900 --> 02:00:23.420
Like, they don't even try to pretend that they're free of the restriction of only making

02:00:23.420 --> 02:00:25.900
things for Sony and, assumably, PC.

02:00:25.900 --> 02:00:29.900
So certainly, you're going to see things happen on Xbox and mobile.

02:00:29.900 --> 02:00:34.300
Now, does this mean they're going to go back and port EverQuest to Xbox One?

02:00:35.420 --> 02:00:36.940
Nah, probably not.

02:00:36.940 --> 02:00:40.700
But you'll probably see a little more parity with the things that come out in the future.

02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:46.060
And especially like, you know, maybe like EverQuest Landmark or some of the newer things,

02:00:46.060 --> 02:00:47.740
maybe even DC Universe.

02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:52.700
I mean, if it's not too hard for them to port over the PlayStation 4 versions of the Xbox

02:00:52.700 --> 02:00:53.980
One, maybe that would come over.

02:00:54.700 --> 02:00:57.340
But then again, now here's the problem.

02:00:57.340 --> 02:01:02.220
Microsoft has that restriction where the servers have to be Microsoft-centric.

02:01:02.220 --> 02:01:06.700
So is that going to work for every Daybreak Game Company game?

02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:07.180
I don't know.

02:01:07.180 --> 02:01:09.100
So it'll be interesting to see what develops in the future.

02:01:09.100 --> 02:01:12.700
But I think mobile is definitely going to be a thing that's happening as well.

02:01:12.700 --> 02:01:14.780
So they are saying business as usual for now.

02:01:14.780 --> 02:01:17.100
It doesn't sound like there are any layoffs or things like that.

02:01:17.100 --> 02:01:21.580
We're all keeping our fingers and toes crossed that the talent over there can keep on doing

02:01:21.580 --> 02:01:22.460
right what they're doing.

02:01:23.500 --> 02:01:28.380
And hopefully this will mean now that they can go more multi-platform, there'll be even

02:01:28.380 --> 02:01:30.060
more subscribers to consume their games.

02:01:30.060 --> 02:01:30.780
We'll see what happens.

02:01:31.580 --> 02:01:31.900
All right.

02:01:32.940 --> 02:01:37.900
Moving on, DarkSakura, you have a follow-up story for us of sorts, speaking of MMOs.

02:01:37.900 --> 02:01:38.540
I do.

02:01:38.540 --> 02:01:43.820
Well, you know, we talked about a lot of websites that had been shut down among them.

02:01:43.820 --> 02:01:46.300
Joystiq, Massively, WoW Insider.

02:01:46.940 --> 02:01:52.460
Well, WoW Insider is actually going to get an extended life as Blizzard Watch.

02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:58.460
Although, I don't know, someone should have kerned their logo better.

02:01:59.580 --> 02:02:09.420
So basically they generated $13,172.50 per month from 2,549 people.

02:02:10.300 --> 02:02:13.580
And so they're now being relaunched as Blizzard Watch.

02:02:14.220 --> 02:02:17.420
By the way, they have stressed that that logo is super temporary.

02:02:17.420 --> 02:02:17.660
Good.

02:02:19.020 --> 02:02:22.300
I think they actually had a post the other day trying to hire a graphic designer.

02:02:24.220 --> 02:02:25.020
I should do it.

02:02:25.020 --> 02:02:26.060
I should just do it for free.

02:02:27.100 --> 02:02:30.060
Anyway, you can go to BlizzardWatch.com to find out a little bit more.

02:02:30.700 --> 02:02:33.180
And I don't have time to do it.

02:02:33.180 --> 02:02:34.860
No reason why you can't throw your hat in the ring.

02:02:34.860 --> 02:02:35.580
Yeah.

02:02:35.580 --> 02:02:37.500
I can just point out the bad kerning on that.

02:02:38.220 --> 02:02:44.380
Also, now this is really interesting too, because we just talked about Kickstarter before.

02:02:44.380 --> 02:02:51.500
But Massively is turning toward crowdfunding via Kickstarter to try to raise $50,000

02:02:52.380 --> 02:02:57.260
to launch a new website called Massively Overpowered.

02:02:58.060 --> 02:03:02.940
And on their Kickstarter project page, they're basically saying,

02:03:03.020 --> 02:03:07.980
we like to keep doing what we were doing only better, not just because we love MMO blogging,

02:03:07.980 --> 02:03:12.700
but because we know that our community and the greater MMO fandom is unique and worth serving.

02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:15.100
And by the way, they've made it.

02:03:15.100 --> 02:03:16.220
They've achieved that.

02:03:16.220 --> 02:03:18.140
It was hit either earlier today or last night.

02:03:18.140 --> 02:03:20.700
So it's still going though, isn't it?

02:03:20.700 --> 02:03:21.340
It's still going.

02:03:21.340 --> 02:03:22.540
25 days to go.

02:03:22.540 --> 02:03:26.060
And their goal was $50,000 and they've made $52,000.

02:03:26.060 --> 02:03:28.780
But of course, as a lot of Kickstarters do, they have stretch goals.

02:03:28.780 --> 02:03:34.220
I want to say there was something for $75,000 about convention coverage.

02:03:35.420 --> 02:03:40.060
If they can get into those different conventions, then they'll be covering those.

02:03:40.700 --> 02:03:43.580
Their new website is MassivelyOP.com.

02:03:44.140 --> 02:03:45.020
Very cool.

02:03:45.020 --> 02:03:45.980
Go check it out.

02:03:45.980 --> 02:03:49.180
Well, it's kind of funny because last week's show, not to say I told you so,

02:03:49.180 --> 02:03:53.900
but I seem to remember distinctly saying, I guarantee you at least Wowsider is launching

02:03:53.900 --> 02:03:57.100
a Patreon or a Kickstarter the minute they close on AOL.

02:03:57.100 --> 02:03:59.180
Well, Wowsider actually did do it through Patreon.

02:03:59.180 --> 02:03:59.580
They did.

02:03:59.580 --> 02:03:59.820
Yeah.

02:03:59.820 --> 02:04:02.220
So one did it through Patreon and one did it through Kickstarter.

02:04:02.220 --> 02:04:05.500
And I said, if they're going to do it, strike while the iron's hot while people are,

02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:09.580
you know, eulogizing the loss of WOW Insider and what it meant to them and so forth.

02:04:09.580 --> 02:04:10.700
Strike while the iron's hot.

02:04:10.700 --> 02:04:15.500
Hey, for a dollar a month, you know, you can still have this in your life.

02:04:15.500 --> 02:04:17.820
And they convinced all these people to do it.

02:04:17.820 --> 02:04:18.300
Good for them.

02:04:18.300 --> 02:04:18.700
Good for them.

02:04:18.700 --> 02:04:20.220
I mean, it's a good site.

02:04:20.860 --> 02:04:22.140
I can't knock them whatsoever.

02:04:22.140 --> 02:04:24.620
They do a good service for that Warcraft community.

02:04:24.620 --> 02:04:26.220
And Massively does great work as well.

02:04:26.540 --> 02:04:30.940
I've read their stuff a lot in doing Horde House, where we try to tap into all sorts

02:04:30.940 --> 02:04:31.900
of online games.

02:04:31.900 --> 02:04:36.620
I use Massively to try to keep a pulse and other sites too, but Massively a lot to try

02:04:36.620 --> 02:04:38.780
to keep a pulse on all these other sites.

02:04:39.500 --> 02:04:43.900
What's very interesting though, Jamie, I don't know if you noticed, but so you have

02:04:43.900 --> 02:04:45.580
WOW Insider started their own thing.

02:04:46.380 --> 02:04:47.980
Massively started their own thing.

02:04:47.980 --> 02:04:51.340
I believe Unofficial Apple Web Blog also started their own thing.

02:04:51.340 --> 02:04:54.220
I know that's kind of outside the scope of what we talk about here, but that was a blog

02:04:54.220 --> 02:04:55.260
that was shut down too.

02:04:56.220 --> 02:05:00.780
Joystiq, however, apparently is not going down this route, or at least we haven't seen

02:05:00.780 --> 02:05:01.340
it yet.

02:05:01.340 --> 02:05:04.220
But you have this odd thing going on and it's a little different.

02:05:05.740 --> 02:05:10.300
Well, yeah, it looks like they retained maybe three people from Joystiq.

02:05:10.300 --> 02:05:16.860
Some of the writers who now are writing pieces for Engadget, but it sounds from their little

02:05:16.860 --> 02:05:19.180
initial, this is what it's all about.

02:05:19.180 --> 02:05:24.380
They're kind of, I hate to be so crass, but it sounded a bit like a lowered expectations

02:05:24.380 --> 02:05:28.620
post where they're saying, we're not going to cover all the press release news.

02:05:28.620 --> 02:05:31.100
We're going to cover gamer lifestyle.

02:05:31.100 --> 02:05:33.260
It makes sense because they can't with three people.

02:05:33.260 --> 02:05:35.020
That's what I'm thinking it is.

02:05:35.020 --> 02:05:40.780
I hate to be so crude for a site that I really have respected in the past, but it did sound

02:05:40.780 --> 02:05:42.380
like it was a lowered expectations post.

02:05:42.380 --> 02:05:45.260
Like you're just not going to get as much as you used to see.

02:05:45.260 --> 02:05:49.500
And so we're going to cut out all the stuff that everybody copy paste on other websites

02:05:49.500 --> 02:05:51.420
anyway, which I mean, makes sense.

02:05:51.420 --> 02:05:54.140
I can't fault them for that idea at all.

02:05:54.460 --> 02:05:58.380
But it should be noted that Joystiq Cross and Gadget is not Joystiq.

02:05:59.180 --> 02:06:06.300
And also within hours, that Wow Insider Twitter was turned into this thing that said, Wow

02:06:06.300 --> 02:06:09.420
Insider, now a part of Joystiq Cross and Gadget.

02:06:09.420 --> 02:06:12.540
And there were a whole bunch of people that replied to them, basically giving them the

02:06:12.540 --> 02:06:13.500
middle finger.

02:06:13.500 --> 02:06:17.500
Like you fired the whole staff, fuck you, you know, type of thing.

02:06:18.460 --> 02:06:23.820
And I have yet to see a peep on this Joystiq Cross and Gadget on what's, what's Wow

02:06:23.820 --> 02:06:25.820
Insider, what's massively now.

02:06:25.820 --> 02:06:28.620
My thought is they're just going to let it go.

02:06:30.220 --> 02:06:33.580
They kind of have to, I think the community kind of sees through it.

02:06:33.580 --> 02:06:37.980
You know, there's, if they try to do Wow Insider, it's, it's none of the same people.

02:06:37.980 --> 02:06:41.900
It's just, it's just not going to, they're not going to retain any of those people that

02:06:41.900 --> 02:06:42.620
were on that site.

02:06:43.340 --> 02:06:47.020
It's like taking five new girls and calling them the Spice Girls.

02:06:47.020 --> 02:06:49.340
It's not going to be the Spice Girls.

02:06:49.340 --> 02:06:51.900
It's the Spice Girls in name only.

02:06:51.980 --> 02:06:52.780
Or how about this?

02:06:52.780 --> 02:06:57.180
Since everybody's talking by Saved by the Bell this week, which by the way, side rant,

02:06:57.180 --> 02:06:58.380
what the fuck was cool?

02:06:58.380 --> 02:06:59.500
No, no, I loved it.

02:06:59.500 --> 02:06:59.980
I loved it.

02:06:59.980 --> 02:07:03.420
But what the fuck was up with all these gaming blogs that were like, did you see the Saved

02:07:03.420 --> 02:07:04.460
by the Bell thing on Fallon?

02:07:04.460 --> 02:07:05.660
Like I saw it on Twitter.

02:07:05.660 --> 02:07:06.300
It was clickbait.

02:07:06.300 --> 02:07:07.500
They were writing articles on it.

02:07:07.500 --> 02:07:10.220
I'm like, there's never even been a Saved by the Bell game.

02:07:10.780 --> 02:07:16.060
And I mean, I saw the people that like games like this, like Saved by the Bell.

02:07:16.060 --> 02:07:18.220
So that's why I'm going to put an article about it.

02:07:18.220 --> 02:07:24.140
I just like, here is another great example of what we should be complaining about in

02:07:24.140 --> 02:07:25.180
game journalism.

02:07:25.180 --> 02:07:28.940
But there's all this bullshit fuckery hoo-ha going on somewhere else.

02:07:28.940 --> 02:07:29.900
I'm just like, hello?

02:07:29.900 --> 02:07:30.220
Hello?

02:07:30.220 --> 02:07:30.940
It's right here.

02:07:30.940 --> 02:07:31.900
It's like this.

02:07:31.900 --> 02:07:32.780
This is not gaming.

02:07:32.780 --> 02:07:33.900
What is this thing?

02:07:33.900 --> 02:07:34.460
Yeah, exactly.

02:07:34.460 --> 02:07:36.380
It's not journalism.

02:07:36.380 --> 02:07:38.940
That's something you mentioned on your Twitter feed saying, hey, you know what?

02:07:38.940 --> 02:07:39.660
That's pretty cool.

02:07:39.660 --> 02:07:40.780
Hey, did you guys see that?

02:07:40.780 --> 02:07:41.260
What is it?

02:07:41.260 --> 02:07:44.220
It's a link to an article on Twitter on their Twitters.

02:07:44.220 --> 02:07:44.860
Anyway.

02:07:44.860 --> 02:07:45.500
Anyway, sorry.

02:07:45.500 --> 02:07:46.060
Side rant.

02:07:46.060 --> 02:07:47.260
To content they didn't even make.

02:07:48.220 --> 02:07:49.260
Yeah, right.

02:07:49.260 --> 02:07:52.540
So anyway, so what was I going to say?

02:07:52.540 --> 02:07:59.020
Oh, I was going with an analogy of the new Saved by the Bell did not touch the old, all

02:07:59.020 --> 02:07:59.180
right.

02:07:59.180 --> 02:08:00.140
The trains left the station.

02:08:00.140 --> 02:08:00.620
Forget it.

02:08:02.140 --> 02:08:02.940
Let's move on.

02:08:02.940 --> 02:08:03.980
Toot, toot, Rob.

02:08:03.980 --> 02:08:04.620
Toot, toot.

02:08:05.580 --> 02:08:06.060
All right.

02:08:06.940 --> 02:08:07.980
Let's move on, Loki.

02:08:08.700 --> 02:08:09.260
All right.

02:08:10.540 --> 02:08:18.140
So there's this new sort of technology called gaze tracking that allows

02:08:18.140 --> 02:08:22.700
you to use, I guess, they're saying like an infinite screen.

02:08:22.700 --> 02:08:29.260
Basically, it tracks your eye movement and based on that, I guess, it allows you to,

02:08:29.260 --> 02:08:31.740
I don't know, have more of an immersive experience.

02:08:31.740 --> 02:08:33.900
They're calling it like an infinite screen.

02:08:33.900 --> 02:08:39.500
So when the player looks to the left of the screen, I can measure where you're looking

02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:41.500
and kind of rotate the camera, that type of thing.

02:08:42.300 --> 02:08:43.580
I just don't see that working.

02:08:43.580 --> 02:08:44.300
I mean, I don't know.

02:08:45.580 --> 02:08:46.380
Cool, I guess.

02:08:46.380 --> 02:08:55.020
But this reminds me so much of what they did with how they use the Kinect with like

02:08:55.020 --> 02:08:59.660
Forza, where you would kind of turn your head to look to the side.

02:08:59.660 --> 02:09:03.580
But the problem is, is when you turn your head, the monitor doesn't turn with you.

02:09:03.580 --> 02:09:05.900
So it doesn't really work that way.

02:09:07.500 --> 02:09:11.660
But anyways, apparently, though, you can, if you're interested in this technology,

02:09:11.660 --> 02:09:17.980
they do have hardware that you could buy, including they have like they're saying some

02:09:17.980 --> 02:09:21.420
development kits and stuff, 100 that go for $139.

02:09:22.140 --> 02:09:25.500
I honestly think this would be kind of cool if it was something that was incorporated

02:09:25.500 --> 02:09:31.260
into, say, something else like the Oculus or something like that, where it's kind of

02:09:31.260 --> 02:09:37.420
tracking where you're looking and maybe utilizing that for UI or something like that for like

02:09:37.420 --> 02:09:41.180
selecting things that might be kind of cool.

02:09:41.660 --> 02:09:43.900
I just I don't know.

02:09:44.780 --> 02:09:49.180
It's a neat concept, but I just don't know if it's going to be practical in the long

02:09:49.180 --> 02:09:49.420
run.

02:09:50.220 --> 02:09:53.180
Yeah, again, this is like any piece of technology.

02:09:53.180 --> 02:09:54.540
I have to see the game.

02:09:54.540 --> 02:09:57.020
I have to see the software that necessitates it.

02:09:57.020 --> 02:10:01.900
And honestly, the problem with me, if I use this, is it's just going to be, you know,

02:10:03.100 --> 02:10:06.780
OK, I glance at the boobs all of a sudden now, like my character spin around.

02:10:06.780 --> 02:10:08.300
It's like I just I can't.

02:10:09.020 --> 02:10:13.340
Am I going to get penalized for looking at the boobs or looking at the package?

02:10:13.340 --> 02:10:15.420
Whatever your taste is going to be, it's going to be tough.

02:10:16.700 --> 02:10:19.020
Is my video game going to out me as gay?

02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:25.260
No, I just I have to see like what context this is used in.

02:10:25.260 --> 02:10:29.340
I mean, like, you know, like Kinect, we've seen a few good uses of it, like, you know,

02:10:29.340 --> 02:10:34.140
Dan Harmonix clearly has that thing mastered, but, you know, not even Microsoft ever really,

02:10:34.140 --> 02:10:36.220
you know, truly mastered the Kinect.

02:10:36.220 --> 02:10:39.260
Oculus Rift and, you know, Project Morpheus.

02:10:39.260 --> 02:10:42.060
I'm a little more sold on, too, because I've kind of seen how those work.

02:10:42.060 --> 02:10:43.980
But it seems a good game.

02:10:43.980 --> 02:10:47.420
And that's the other thing, too, is like they're saying, you know, even when they're talking

02:10:47.420 --> 02:10:51.740
about it, they're like, well, you know, you could still use your mouse to look around

02:10:51.740 --> 02:10:54.620
and stuff, but it's really the next evolution.

02:10:54.620 --> 02:11:01.180
Well, it's not really a problem, I think, from, you know, don't try to solve a problem

02:11:01.180 --> 02:11:02.140
that's not there yet.

02:11:02.140 --> 02:11:02.860
You know what I mean?

02:11:03.740 --> 02:11:09.180
If it's good enough the way it is now, why do I need to invest $200 into something for

02:11:09.180 --> 02:11:13.100
just like mouse looking, but instead I'm going to be using my eyes?

02:11:13.100 --> 02:11:18.620
And, you know, I would have to really see this working because in the past, similar

02:11:18.620 --> 02:11:20.220
technologies have not worked.

02:11:20.220 --> 02:11:23.980
And I just, I don't know, that's a lot of money to invest.

02:11:25.100 --> 02:11:26.140
But we'll see.

02:11:27.100 --> 02:11:27.420
All right.

02:11:27.420 --> 02:11:33.420
Well, moving on to a game that if it did have gaze tracking in it, would probably be asking

02:11:33.420 --> 02:11:35.100
a lot, why do you keep looking at that nose?

02:11:35.660 --> 02:11:37.340
That's a classic game.

02:11:37.340 --> 02:11:38.140
Qbert.

02:11:38.140 --> 02:11:41.660
I just talked about this earlier in the show, funny enough, because over at Rockage, I played

02:11:41.660 --> 02:11:42.860
an old school Qbert machine.

02:11:43.740 --> 02:11:49.820
And Qbert is going to be relaunched on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and Vita.

02:11:49.820 --> 02:11:50.460
That's right.

02:11:50.460 --> 02:11:54.540
Qbert rebooted, essentially, is coming to these different consoles.

02:11:54.540 --> 02:11:57.100
This was run on the Sony blog earlier this week.

02:11:57.660 --> 02:12:01.500
The complete original version of Qbert, of course, is included.

02:12:02.540 --> 02:12:07.500
But as part of Qbert rebooted, you get the classic and then you get the modernized.

02:12:08.060 --> 02:12:10.700
Qbert rebooted uses hexagons.

02:12:10.700 --> 02:12:13.980
Ooh, now instead of the cube pattern, they've got hexagons.

02:12:13.980 --> 02:12:17.740
They went the Civ 5 route to mix up the game.

02:12:17.740 --> 02:12:19.100
I wonder if that's where they got the idea.

02:12:19.100 --> 02:12:20.300
Let's turn squares into hexagons.

02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:25.820
Anyway, so you can really change up the level designs now that you're using hexagons.

02:12:25.820 --> 02:12:30.940
There's also time and score challenges, new enemies with new behaviors, new playable characters,

02:12:31.660 --> 02:12:32.540
and so on and so on.

02:12:32.540 --> 02:12:34.380
So that's pretty cool.

02:12:34.380 --> 02:12:37.820
I did not catch a time when this is coming out, but I think it's really soon.

02:12:37.820 --> 02:12:38.780
I think it's later this month.

02:12:38.780 --> 02:12:40.380
It might even be as soon as this coming week.

02:12:40.380 --> 02:12:42.860
But I really enjoy the classic Qbert game.

02:12:43.420 --> 02:12:44.140
It's a lot of fun.

02:12:44.140 --> 02:12:46.620
So I will certainly be checking this out.

02:12:46.620 --> 02:12:50.060
That will be available on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and Vita.

02:12:50.700 --> 02:12:53.100
To go back to what we were talking about just a second ago.

02:12:54.060 --> 02:12:58.460
They brought a Dungeon Buster brought up in chat.

02:12:58.460 --> 02:13:01.020
Would you like to see your Kinect eye tracking stats for the week?

02:13:01.020 --> 02:13:06.060
That reminds me, like if this was something that was implemented full scale, then can

02:13:06.060 --> 02:13:09.980
you imagine like, oh, hey, yeah, we could totally see what the ad impression is.

02:13:09.980 --> 02:13:11.820
How long were they staring at the ad?

02:13:11.820 --> 02:13:12.700
Oh, God.

02:13:12.700 --> 02:13:15.420
How long were they staring at the product or whatever that's on the screen?

02:13:15.420 --> 02:13:19.660
Imagine all that metadata that would be really helpful.

02:13:19.660 --> 02:13:25.260
So I could see something like this integrated into some consumer products because that's

02:13:25.260 --> 02:13:29.420
good information for advertisers that they can sell and make money off of.

02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:35.580
Raginator in chat pointing out that Qbert Reloaded is already on Steam.

02:13:35.580 --> 02:13:36.540
I bought it a while back.

02:13:36.540 --> 02:13:37.820
Well, shit, I was unaware.

02:13:37.820 --> 02:13:38.860
I might have to check that out.

02:13:38.860 --> 02:13:39.580
Although, I don't know.

02:13:39.580 --> 02:13:41.900
I'll wait for it on PlayStation, maybe.

02:13:41.900 --> 02:13:43.820
Fifth Dream says Qbert is out on the 10th.

02:13:43.820 --> 02:13:44.860
So that would be this coming week.

02:13:44.860 --> 02:13:45.580
Well, that's pretty cool.

02:13:46.220 --> 02:13:47.020
So I will check that out.

02:13:47.020 --> 02:13:51.260
Maybe I'll just wait a few more days then and buy that on the PlayStation.

02:13:51.260 --> 02:13:54.060
It does seem like a game I want to play with the controller.

02:13:54.060 --> 02:13:54.560
I don't know.

02:13:55.100 --> 02:13:57.660
I guess I could always plug the controller into my PC, right?

02:13:57.660 --> 02:13:58.140
But I don't know.

02:13:58.140 --> 02:14:01.180
It's some games are couch games.

02:14:01.180 --> 02:14:01.660
I could.

02:14:01.660 --> 02:14:03.740
Yeah, there's probably a working Qbert on there in there.

02:14:04.780 --> 02:14:08.380
But it probably doesn't make that same thud sound when Qbert hits the bottom.

02:14:08.380 --> 02:14:08.880
Who knows?

02:14:09.580 --> 02:14:09.980
All right.

02:14:09.980 --> 02:14:11.820
Anyhow, let's go to the mailbag.

02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:17.180
Every week, you guys send us emails over at participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:14:17.740 --> 02:14:23.740
And DarkSakura dives into the mailbag and finds a few emails worthy of reading for you here on the show.

02:14:23.740 --> 02:14:26.460
So DarkSakura, what is awaiting us in the mailbag tonight?

02:14:27.260 --> 02:14:27.820
Two letters.

02:14:28.620 --> 02:14:29.580
Two letters?

02:14:29.580 --> 02:14:31.020
I will go ahead and start with one.

02:14:31.020 --> 02:14:31.520
Okay.

02:14:32.620 --> 02:14:34.540
First one is HelloLR.

02:14:35.580 --> 02:14:37.020
Caught up on podcast this week.

02:14:37.020 --> 02:14:40.700
I apologize for the length of this email in advance, but trust me, it's all meat and no fat.

02:14:40.700 --> 02:14:42.940
Well, we don't want that because fat makes it juicy.

02:14:43.820 --> 02:14:44.320
No, I'm kidding.

02:14:45.020 --> 02:14:49.980
When you were discussing Rock Edge, it occurred to me that I need to say something.

02:14:49.980 --> 02:14:51.260
You all need to go to MAGFest.

02:14:52.220 --> 02:14:55.100
Like, not you ought to go or you should think about it.

02:14:55.100 --> 02:14:56.220
You really need to go.

02:14:56.220 --> 02:14:59.660
To describe the feeling you'll get when you walk in there is impossible.

02:14:59.660 --> 02:15:03.260
There are more video games in one room than you will ever see anywhere else in your lifetime,

02:15:03.260 --> 02:15:05.180
except possibly at a future MAGFest.

02:15:05.900 --> 02:15:08.780
Lots of consoles are there, including most you cannot think of.

02:15:08.780 --> 02:15:10.460
Even obscure ones went like my house.

02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:14.140
Plus over 200 arcade games on free play.

02:15:14.140 --> 02:15:17.900
Plus all the stuff we grew up with to the latest bit money straight from Japan.

02:15:17.900 --> 02:15:20.940
That actually sounds like California Extreme.

02:15:22.380 --> 02:15:24.540
Plus pinball machines, California Extreme.

02:15:24.540 --> 02:15:26.700
Plus board and card game, California Extreme.

02:15:27.340 --> 02:15:30.460
Plus a dedicated area with dozens of indie developers.

02:15:30.460 --> 02:15:35.260
Plus the infamous challenge booth where you attempt sick feats on classic emulated games.

02:15:35.260 --> 02:15:36.060
Plus concerts.

02:15:36.060 --> 02:15:37.900
Okay, so yeah, that's where they...

02:15:37.900 --> 02:15:42.380
Yeah, the concerts is a really huge thing that distinguishes it from California Extreme.

02:15:42.380 --> 02:15:43.420
Lots of concerts.

02:15:43.420 --> 02:15:45.020
Based on what I saw at Rockage.

02:15:45.020 --> 02:15:50.540
Hell, the last couple of years have even featured Nobuyomatsu and Yuzo Koshiro concerts.

02:15:51.180 --> 02:15:54.060
This even sounds like slightly awesome...

02:15:54.060 --> 02:15:55.740
No, if this even sounds slightly awesome to you,

02:15:55.740 --> 02:15:57.500
you should try to make it there next January.

02:15:57.500 --> 02:15:58.860
Please trust me on this.

02:15:58.860 --> 02:15:59.580
I would like to.

02:16:00.460 --> 02:16:00.960
It just...

02:16:01.580 --> 02:16:02.080
Yeah.

02:16:02.540 --> 02:16:03.740
Time, money, etc.

02:16:05.180 --> 02:16:07.180
I am giving it way more serious thought now.

02:16:07.180 --> 02:16:14.860
As I mentioned earlier in the show, thanks to Rockage and just kind of having some thinking

02:16:14.860 --> 02:16:19.420
over the past few weeks about where should my priorities really lie and what conventions I go to.

02:16:20.460 --> 02:16:24.220
I really think some of the conventions that I used to consider kind of a big deal,

02:16:24.220 --> 02:16:26.540
I think are kind of losing their relevancy.

02:16:27.260 --> 02:16:29.500
And maybe I'll get into this more on a future show,

02:16:29.500 --> 02:16:33.900
but I kind of believe that E3 is becoming less and less relevant, as I think a lot of you are.

02:16:33.900 --> 02:16:34.400
Yep.

02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:37.760
Especially as companies like Nintendo take their case directly to consumers.

02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:46.080
So I think these other homegrown shows that really celebrate gaming and what it's all about,

02:16:46.080 --> 02:16:48.160
that haven't sold out like some other ones have,

02:16:48.880 --> 02:16:53.120
I think these other homegrown things like Magfest, like Rockage, like GX,

02:16:54.160 --> 02:16:57.040
there's tons of them everywhere every weekend.

02:16:57.040 --> 02:16:59.760
I think this is really the types of stuff I want to be going to.

02:16:59.760 --> 02:17:02.160
Things where we celebrate and love and appreciate gaming.

02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:07.440
A follow up to my previous email regarding Nintendo's evil pay to play crane game,

02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:10.640
where you can win badges and icons to customize your 3DS home menu,

02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:13.040
it's a little bit less evil than originally reported.

02:17:13.040 --> 02:17:15.600
If you buy five plays for 90 yen and don't win anything,

02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:20.320
you'll receive a free badges consolation prize that might not be the one you were playing for.

02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:24.720
Also, there is a special crane machine that you can get five plays on for free once a day.

02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:28.080
This machine allows you to win fake badges, but don't do anything for you,

02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:31.360
but the ones you win are flipped over.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:36.320
That if you find a red dot on the back, you win three free plays on the next real machine.

02:17:36.880 --> 02:17:40.480
This has only happened once out of the 30 or so fake badges I've won,

02:17:40.480 --> 02:17:44.080
but for every 10 you win, you get one free play on the real machine regardless.

02:17:44.080 --> 02:17:48.320
So it is in theory possible to win a lot of the items without paying any money.

02:17:48.320 --> 02:17:50.160
It just may take a very long time.

02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:52.960
Lastly, if you pay 180 yen in one day for 10 players,

02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:57.200
you will see at no extra charge an exclusive premium theme of your choice.

02:17:57.200 --> 02:17:59.680
This is all about the price they sell the themes for anyway,

02:17:59.680 --> 02:18:01.520
so it's arguably a good value.

02:18:01.520 --> 02:18:05.440
All in all, it's still very evil, but perhaps only 66.6% evil.

02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:12.080
Shane was telling me about that crane game because you know he imported that new 3DS.

02:18:12.080 --> 02:18:14.640
So he was he was over here the other day and he was playing it.

02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:15.520
I was like, what the hell are you playing?

02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:16.320
He's like, oh, it's the crane.

02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:19.040
And I was like, oh, I've heard about this on the alarm desk.

02:18:19.040 --> 02:18:20.160
This is cute.

02:18:20.160 --> 02:18:21.440
Yeah, they get cute boxes.

02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:21.920
Not fair.

02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:25.520
When shocking moments were being discussed,

02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:28.960
I'm a little surprised that nobody brought up the release announcement of Duke Nukem Forever.

02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:31.040
When non-traditional sports games were mentioned,

02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:34.560
it's a little I'm a little surprised that nobody suggested Super Dodgeball.

02:18:36.240 --> 02:18:37.360
Dan would have suggested that.

02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:42.640
I think Twitch is the most likely candidate to offer an alternative to YouTube to host

02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:43.760
Let's Play videos.

02:18:43.760 --> 02:18:46.160
They also think they're sharply focused on what they do best

02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:48.880
and will likely not expand into doing other things.

02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:51.280
That said, I hope I'm wrong.

02:18:51.280 --> 02:18:54.800
YouTube needs a good splits kick punch in the vajayjay.

02:18:54.800 --> 02:18:58.880
The Sony class action settlement was mentioned.

02:18:58.880 --> 02:19:02.640
If you are participating, read the instructions and fine print carefully.

02:19:02.640 --> 02:19:06.560
You can only select to be the three or six months of PlayStation Plus benefit

02:19:06.560 --> 02:19:08.320
if you are not a current subscriber.

02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:09.520
That's what I thought.

02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:14.080
If you select that option and you are a current subscriber, you will forfeit your benefit.

02:19:14.080 --> 02:19:17.200
Oh, I already have all the other games on there anyway.

02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:22.400
A listener mentioned on a frugal question that they've never been to a convention,

02:19:22.400 --> 02:19:27.040
but that they were looking forward to too many games in the Philadelphia area this year.

02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:30.400
Well, I've been there demoing my latest projects for the past four years

02:19:30.400 --> 02:19:32.880
and I'll be there again this year, too, so I hope to see you there.

02:19:32.880 --> 02:19:35.360
Mention OLR and you'll get free hugs at the very least.

02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:41.360
By the way, Philadelphia area, I think also is DerpyCon.

02:19:42.400 --> 02:19:47.120
I think they're going to be doing a second one, but I did their flyer for them, their book.

02:19:47.680 --> 02:19:54.400
So, lastly, I want to mention that Orange Lounge Radio is the most legitimate podcast

02:19:54.400 --> 02:19:55.360
on the internet.

02:19:55.360 --> 02:19:58.480
In fact, it is 120% legitimate on every day of the week.

02:19:59.120 --> 02:20:03.040
And if for any reasons one of my future game releases ever gets popular,

02:20:03.040 --> 02:20:06.800
a large amount of people ever care about what I have to say,

02:20:06.800 --> 02:20:10.480
I will still make my project announcements on OLR before I make them anywhere else.

02:20:10.480 --> 02:20:10.800
Why?

02:20:10.800 --> 02:20:12.240
Because that's my FU of the week.

02:20:12.240 --> 02:20:13.520
Every week, that's why.

02:20:13.520 --> 02:20:15.200
Hugs and kisses, Erin Yyr.

02:20:15.520 --> 02:20:17.440
That really means a lot.

02:20:17.440 --> 02:20:18.160
Thank you.

02:20:18.160 --> 02:20:18.640
Really true.

02:20:18.640 --> 02:20:19.760
Like, this week especially.

02:20:19.760 --> 02:20:20.640
Hearts.

02:20:20.640 --> 02:20:21.360
That means an awful lot.

02:20:21.360 --> 02:20:23.600
Sorry for all the pictures of swollen balls in the chat room.

02:20:25.600 --> 02:20:26.640
I will explain that later.

02:20:28.320 --> 02:20:31.760
Okay, I have to actually stop because I have to tell you what my obsession with the swollen balls

02:20:31.760 --> 02:20:32.260
are now.

02:20:32.960 --> 02:20:34.160
Do we really need to go there?

02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:35.360
Because I'm not sure we need to go there.

02:20:35.360 --> 02:20:36.400
Let's go there.

02:20:36.400 --> 02:20:36.900
No!

02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:40.480
It's actually giving a plug to one of my favorite YouTube channels.

02:20:41.040 --> 02:20:42.640
So, it's Rachel and June.

02:20:43.680 --> 02:20:51.360
A cute redhead girl that met her now Japanese husband while she was a student over there,

02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:53.280
was separated from for a little while and then moved back.

02:20:53.280 --> 02:20:58.880
So, she actually goes into depth about what it's like being a foreigner in Japan

02:20:58.880 --> 02:21:01.120
and being married into a Japanese family and whatnot.

02:21:01.120 --> 02:21:05.280
So, she did one about the Tokyo Parasite Museum.

02:21:05.280 --> 02:21:06.400
Hence, swollen balls.

02:21:07.920 --> 02:21:08.640
You nasty.

02:21:09.200 --> 02:21:10.400
So, it's interesting.

02:21:10.400 --> 02:21:11.760
Is science Rob Science?

02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:13.680
What were you gonna say?

02:21:13.680 --> 02:21:14.180
Science.

02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:16.240
Thank you.

02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:17.440
Fifth dream in chat.

02:21:17.440 --> 02:21:18.320
Swollen balls.

02:21:18.320 --> 02:21:19.680
Is this Hoard House?

02:21:19.680 --> 02:21:20.320
Thank you.

02:21:20.320 --> 02:21:22.080
I already have to put up with this one night a week.

02:21:22.080 --> 02:21:23.120
I don't need two.

02:21:23.120 --> 02:21:24.880
I'm gonna have a talk with grandpa.

02:21:24.880 --> 02:21:25.840
You and grandpa.

02:21:26.400 --> 02:21:28.640
You and grandpa should do a dirty girls show.

02:21:28.640 --> 02:21:29.520
That's what you should do.

02:21:29.520 --> 02:21:30.400
Just dirty girls.

02:21:30.400 --> 02:21:32.240
That's what I get for living in his house.

02:21:32.240 --> 02:21:32.960
Maybe, what?

02:21:32.960 --> 02:21:34.640
Are you gonna get Patty involved in that too?

02:21:34.640 --> 02:21:36.800
Yeah, me, Patty, and grandpa.

02:21:36.800 --> 02:21:37.600
Oh, Jesus.

02:21:38.640 --> 02:21:40.000
Vogue After Dark.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:40.480
That's it.

02:21:40.480 --> 02:21:41.360
That's what we're gonna call it.

02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:42.240
Vogue After Dark.

02:21:44.880 --> 02:21:45.920
Okay, last email.

02:21:46.480 --> 02:21:47.360
Hey, OLR.

02:21:47.360 --> 02:21:48.880
Great show this past episode.

02:21:48.880 --> 02:21:51.680
I appreciate that you guys tackle some difficult topics

02:21:51.680 --> 02:21:52.960
and aren't afraid to dig in.

02:21:53.600 --> 02:21:54.400
I'm not gonna say it.

02:21:55.040 --> 02:21:58.240
Usually, I just enjoy as a passive listener,

02:21:58.240 --> 02:22:00.080
but this time I felt a little heat rise

02:22:00.080 --> 02:22:02.480
and wanted to let off a little steam of my own.

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.560
Regarding the discussion on YouTube copyright violations

02:22:06.640 --> 02:22:07.760
of games slash music,

02:22:07.760 --> 02:22:10.960
I can't comprehend anything but an unrestricted fair use system.

02:22:11.520 --> 02:22:13.280
Now, I say fair use,

02:22:13.280 --> 02:22:17.440
which exempts those who simply play artists songs or play movies.

02:22:17.440 --> 02:22:19.280
It's clearly a different matter altogether,

02:22:19.280 --> 02:22:21.920
but streaming a game play through with the song in the background,

02:22:22.800 --> 02:22:24.240
background, sorry, that's fair use.

02:22:24.880 --> 02:22:28.240
It's really a win-win for both consumers and content creators.

02:22:28.240 --> 02:22:31.120
Playing the games and music are a great way to promote the content.

02:22:31.120 --> 02:22:32.800
People watch and listen and then buy,

02:22:32.800 --> 02:22:34.800
which I actually will say I've done.

02:22:34.800 --> 02:22:38.240
I even got introduced to one of my favorite bands now Boy and Bear

02:22:38.240 --> 02:22:41.520
when they were still really, really new in Australia

02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:44.480
because one of their songs played in the background of a commercial.

02:22:44.480 --> 02:22:48.080
I popped out my Shazam and I tagged the song because I wanted it

02:22:48.720 --> 02:22:50.000
and now they're kind of big.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:51.120
I feel like such a hipster.

02:22:54.640 --> 02:22:58.080
I can't imagine hearing a background song on someone's homemade video

02:22:58.080 --> 02:23:00.800
or watching a game or play a game and then say to myself,

02:23:00.800 --> 02:23:03.760
I'm good, I don't need to buy that game or that CD.

02:23:03.760 --> 02:23:06.160
At worst, I decide it's a game I don't want to play

02:23:06.160 --> 02:23:07.600
or a song I don't need to hear again.

02:23:07.600 --> 02:23:10.080
At best, I go out and buy the game or the album.

02:23:10.080 --> 02:23:12.320
That's a win-win for me and for the creator.

02:23:13.040 --> 02:23:15.840
Charging fees for streaming these things and most,

02:23:15.840 --> 02:23:19.600
no, charge fees for streaming these things and most YouTubers

02:23:19.600 --> 02:23:23.440
won't or can't pay it, won't stream it, and we won't see and hear it.

02:23:23.440 --> 02:23:28.000
No promotion, no awareness, no purchase, lose-lose for both customers and content creators.

02:23:29.120 --> 02:23:31.360
I really can't believe it's even an issue.

02:23:31.360 --> 02:23:37.520
Content creators would be crazy to do anything to disable promotional avenues.

02:23:37.520 --> 02:23:39.120
Promotion is everything.

02:23:39.120 --> 02:23:42.800
Having people stream your gaming music for free, you can't do it better.

02:23:42.800 --> 02:23:46.480
I must be near-sighted here because I can't even understand the other side of this argument.

02:23:46.480 --> 02:23:47.680
Love the OLR, narc.

02:23:48.320 --> 02:23:52.560
And I will say this, a lot of these decisions come from,

02:23:54.320 --> 02:23:57.920
I'm going to say the upper level corporate side of things

02:23:57.920 --> 02:24:01.600
where they're not actually as in touch with reality

02:24:01.600 --> 02:24:03.600
as the people who are on the ground level.

02:24:03.600 --> 02:24:04.720
And that's all I'm going to say on that.

02:24:05.520 --> 02:24:09.680
Nintendo's system is flawed, you know, and anything I was talking about last week,

02:24:09.680 --> 02:24:12.480
you know, I totally agree.

02:24:12.480 --> 02:24:15.840
The system that Nintendo came up with only makes Nintendo the winner

02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:17.520
as well as all these other people to get a cut.

02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:19.280
The system is flawed and needs to be fixed.

02:24:19.280 --> 02:24:21.840
And I believe YouTube is the one that needs to fix it.

02:24:21.840 --> 02:24:27.680
However, I respectfully disagree with you that, you know, you can't,

02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:33.840
the Let's Play simply would not exist without the game, period.

02:24:33.840 --> 02:24:38.800
You're saying in your email that you wouldn't come or you wouldn't see the game

02:24:38.800 --> 02:24:40.720
if it wasn't for the Let's Player.

02:24:40.720 --> 02:24:42.880
I'm saying the reverse is true too.

02:24:42.880 --> 02:24:45.920
And I think that's where you do have the blinders there is that

02:24:45.920 --> 02:24:48.480
how did you find the Let's Player in the first place?

02:24:48.480 --> 02:24:49.920
By looking for the game.

02:24:50.480 --> 02:24:53.040
The game creates that content.

02:24:53.040 --> 02:24:55.760
I mean, and this is, this happens in music.

02:24:55.760 --> 02:24:58.080
This happens in movies.

02:24:58.080 --> 02:24:59.120
But that can go either way.

02:24:59.120 --> 02:25:01.920
Just like, for example, like I find out of a game sometimes,

02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:04.640
like I like watching Total Biscuits videos.

02:25:04.640 --> 02:25:07.840
And I found out like about a game called Tower of Guns,

02:25:07.840 --> 02:25:09.520
not by looking for Tower of Guns.

02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:12.800
I watched his channel and I saw that game.

02:25:12.800 --> 02:25:13.760
And so I was exposed to it.

02:25:13.760 --> 02:25:14.880
So it goes both ways.

02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:17.520
And I actually agree with that.

02:25:17.520 --> 02:25:20.400
And that's why I don't think Nintendo deserves a hundred percent.

02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:21.760
I don't think they do.

02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:25.360
And I think if Nintendo wants to give away,

02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:28.960
essentially say, we're going to give away our game for free

02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:32.640
for you to stream, then go ahead and do so.

02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:35.360
And that would encourage more people to do it.

02:25:35.360 --> 02:25:36.800
If they wanted to do that, they could.

02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:39.120
And it would, in fact, encourage more people to do it.

02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:40.480
But they don't have to do it.

02:25:40.480 --> 02:25:44.480
Just like there's people that put music out there in the public domain saying,

02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:46.640
here, please use my music.

02:25:47.280 --> 02:25:48.080
Just give me a credit.

02:25:48.080 --> 02:25:48.800
That's all I want.

02:25:48.800 --> 02:25:50.240
Please just help me get my music out there.

02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:51.520
It's fine.

02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:57.360
Um, I just, I don't think Nintendo is obligated to let you use it for free.

02:25:57.360 --> 02:26:00.960
But I also understand that, well, it's not like people are going to sit here

02:26:00.960 --> 02:26:03.360
and try to license something from Nintendo.

02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:07.040
No, but YouTube is ultimately the one that's making the money off

02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:08.800
both people in that situation.

02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:14.160
I think it is up to YouTube to come up with the system that is fair for both parties.

02:26:14.160 --> 02:26:17.440
And if a gaming company wants to give up their portion of it

02:26:17.440 --> 02:26:20.720
to encourage more people to do the Let's Plays, then so be it.

02:26:20.720 --> 02:26:22.400
And maybe a lot of game companies will do it,

02:26:22.400 --> 02:26:24.320
because it would probably be the smart thing to do

02:26:24.320 --> 02:26:26.160
for a lot of those reasons you just named.

02:26:26.160 --> 02:26:28.320
But I don't think a gaming company has to do it.

02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:33.520
So that's, again, I don't want to re-dredge up the whole debate,

02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:37.360
but those are just my thought out responses to your email.

02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:42.000
So just try really, really hard to look at it the other way around.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:45.120
I'm not saying you necessarily have to have the corporate mentality,

02:26:45.120 --> 02:26:49.440
but just, you know, consider that Nintendo did make the game

02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:51.120
that this person is wanting to stream.

02:26:51.120 --> 02:26:53.120
And without the game, there is nothing to stream.

02:26:53.760 --> 02:26:55.120
Anyway, all right.

02:26:56.800 --> 02:26:58.720
I'm sure there'll be more thoughts on this later.

02:27:00.080 --> 02:27:02.720
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com

02:27:02.720 --> 02:27:04.480
if you want to give more thoughts on this later.

02:27:04.480 --> 02:27:08.000
Oh, no, I guess in chat while we were doing that email, that's a bummer.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:11.280
I guess the stream died right in the middle of that for our live listeners.

02:27:11.280 --> 02:27:14.240
Unfortunately, guys, there was a big storm in California over the weekend,

02:27:14.240 --> 02:27:17.360
so I wouldn't be surprised at all if the internet's a little shitty as a result.

02:27:18.080 --> 02:27:19.040
So sorry about that.

02:27:19.600 --> 02:27:23.520
I was worried this might happen tonight with all the storms.

02:27:23.520 --> 02:27:26.560
I'm just lucky the rain stopped right at six o'clock.

02:27:26.560 --> 02:27:28.320
So I don't have to worry about power outages.

02:27:28.320 --> 02:27:28.960
Knock on wood.

02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:30.180
Let's hope.

02:27:31.120 --> 02:27:31.920
Knock on particle boards.

02:27:31.920 --> 02:27:36.160
Because I never did buy that UPS or whatever I'm supposed to get.

02:27:36.160 --> 02:27:36.960
UPS?

02:27:36.960 --> 02:27:40.800
What the universal power source or whatever the thing's called?

02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:42.240
Uninterrupted power supply.

02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:42.740
That's it.

02:27:43.600 --> 02:27:44.320
I was close.

02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:44.820
Oh.

02:27:45.760 --> 02:27:46.240
Do you remember?

02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:48.080
Oh, you weren't here that week.

02:27:48.080 --> 02:27:49.840
Because it was Flaco that was here that week.

02:27:49.840 --> 02:27:51.040
He was like filling in for you.

02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:54.480
The power went out completely and we lost the show.

02:27:54.480 --> 02:27:55.760
Flaco was here and I missed it?

02:27:55.760 --> 02:27:57.440
Yeah, well, he'll come back.

02:27:57.440 --> 02:27:59.520
I'm sure if you ask him really nicely too, he'll come back.

02:28:01.520 --> 02:28:02.640
This is a long time ago.

02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:04.560
This was when we were doing the show at the apartment.

02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:05.360
It was a while ago.

02:28:07.200 --> 02:28:08.000
Stop whining.

02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:10.020
No.

02:28:10.640 --> 02:28:11.140
Whatever.

02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:13.200
I see how it is, Flaco.

02:28:13.840 --> 02:28:17.840
Well, then I guess clearly somebody is in the mood to get to the FUs of the week.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:19.360
Shall we get to the FUs of the week?

02:28:20.640 --> 02:28:21.280
Whatevs.

02:28:38.480 --> 02:28:41.440
FU to stuff I cannot discuss.

02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:43.840
Reasons and things.

02:28:44.800 --> 02:28:49.520
FU to my dear friend having crappy pneumonia like I did a few years ago.

02:28:49.520 --> 02:28:50.080
You remember that?

02:28:50.640 --> 02:28:52.880
I have a friend now going through almost exactly the same thing.

02:28:52.880 --> 02:28:55.040
Yeah, I think that's why Flaco filled in for you that week.

02:28:55.920 --> 02:28:57.040
That was years and years ago.

02:28:57.040 --> 02:28:57.680
Oh, okay.

02:28:57.680 --> 02:29:00.560
That was when I was still working at Hellhole.

02:29:00.560 --> 02:29:01.060
Oh, dear.

02:29:03.120 --> 02:29:05.120
Well, it didn't start off as Hellhole, but anyway.

02:29:09.200 --> 02:29:13.680
The other FU goes towards having this creative outlet that I love, love, love,

02:29:13.680 --> 02:29:15.840
that I can't stop working on.

02:29:16.800 --> 02:29:18.480
And now, well, it's not this show.

02:29:19.600 --> 02:29:20.320
You know what?

02:29:21.120 --> 02:29:22.080
Love, you mean it.

02:29:22.080 --> 02:29:22.400
I'm sorry.

02:29:22.400 --> 02:29:22.880
I had to.

02:29:22.880 --> 02:29:23.360
Come on.

02:29:23.360 --> 02:29:24.640
You left yourself wide open for that.

02:29:25.600 --> 02:29:28.000
I've got stuff in the works for the show.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:28.640
Okay.

02:29:28.640 --> 02:29:30.800
I told you, keep doing things.

02:29:31.360 --> 02:29:32.240
Stuff's happening.

02:29:32.880 --> 02:29:35.760
I will move mountains for OLR if they're really tiny, tiny, tiny.

02:29:35.760 --> 02:29:38.960
By mountains, she means giant swollen balls again.

02:29:38.960 --> 02:29:40.240
Or psychically thrown trucks.

02:29:40.240 --> 02:29:42.560
I will kick some giant swollen balls.

02:29:42.640 --> 02:29:44.320
Psychically thrown testicles.

02:29:45.600 --> 02:29:46.080
There you go.

02:29:46.800 --> 02:29:47.360
That's it.

02:29:47.360 --> 02:29:48.240
We need a game.

02:29:48.240 --> 02:29:48.480
Okay.

02:29:48.480 --> 02:29:49.360
Do you remember?

02:29:49.360 --> 02:29:50.400
Psycho testicles.

02:29:50.400 --> 02:29:52.240
Pause, pause the music, pause the music, pause the music.

02:29:52.240 --> 02:29:53.200
Yes, ma'am.

02:29:53.200 --> 02:29:54.960
Do you remember the game, the game?

02:29:54.960 --> 02:29:55.280
No.

02:29:55.280 --> 02:29:58.720
When they had that like meeting going on and someone put in.

02:29:58.720 --> 02:30:00.720
Like psycho knots and psycho nuts.

02:30:00.720 --> 02:30:01.280
Let her finish.

02:30:01.280 --> 02:30:02.080
Hold on.

02:30:02.080 --> 02:30:05.840
And someone had like one of those little drone helicopter things, except it was a big

02:30:06.560 --> 02:30:08.880
dick with balls floating around.

02:30:09.600 --> 02:30:11.040
We need a helicopter game.

02:30:11.440 --> 02:30:14.480
Called, um, what did you just call it?

02:30:14.480 --> 02:30:20.720
Protector nuts, psycho, psycho nuts, psycho nuts, a shooter game called psycho nuts.

02:30:20.720 --> 02:30:25.920
It's a little helicopter, Dick going around and shooting down all of our enemies.

02:30:25.920 --> 02:30:28.480
It's like shoplifter, but cocklifter.

02:30:29.280 --> 02:30:30.480
I like that even better.

02:30:31.360 --> 02:30:34.800
I agree with dark Tetsuya in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:30:34.800 --> 02:30:35.200
Wow.

02:30:35.200 --> 02:30:36.000
Tonight's show.

02:30:37.600 --> 02:30:39.120
We've earned our M rating.

02:30:39.440 --> 02:30:42.720
Uh, we've, we've earned our, I am reading in the chair.

02:30:43.680 --> 02:30:44.000
All right.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:45.920
Do we, do we have, can I bring the music back?

02:30:45.920 --> 02:30:47.040
I guess.

02:30:47.040 --> 02:30:47.280
All right.

02:30:47.280 --> 02:30:48.640
Loki, you're a fuse.

02:30:48.640 --> 02:30:55.040
Uh, my after the week, I guess goes to just, I don't know, being distracted because

02:30:55.840 --> 02:30:59.280
unfortunately I've been trying to work on my game and stuff, but when I get tired,

02:30:59.280 --> 02:31:05.520
yeah, sometimes the internet distracts me and end up watching tons of YouTube videos

02:31:05.520 --> 02:31:06.160
for no reason.

02:31:09.440 --> 02:31:10.000
That's it.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:10.560
That's it.

02:31:10.560 --> 02:31:10.960
All right.

02:31:10.960 --> 02:31:12.960
Um, stop it.

02:31:12.960 --> 02:31:17.600
Uh, I have a really big epic FU I want to give, but I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm

02:31:17.600 --> 02:31:21.040
going to be the bigger person, just bite my fricking tongue at least for one more week.

02:31:21.040 --> 02:31:26.960
Um, but I will say this, I will give a, a more lighthearted FU to the Carolina hurricanes,

02:31:27.520 --> 02:31:33.520
uh, for beating the San Jose sharks last night at my first ever hockey game that I went to

02:31:33.520 --> 02:31:34.560
since I was in San Jose.

02:31:34.560 --> 02:31:37.920
Anyway, my friends were like, Hey, you want to go to the sharks game tonight?

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:39.600
I was like, all right, sure.

02:31:39.600 --> 02:31:40.720
I've never been to a hockey game.

02:31:40.720 --> 02:31:41.280
What the hell?

02:31:41.280 --> 02:31:43.840
So I went to my very first sharks game ever.

02:31:43.840 --> 02:31:46.400
And, um, now you get your official bro license.

02:31:46.400 --> 02:31:47.040
The team lost.

02:31:47.040 --> 02:31:47.280
Yes.

02:31:47.280 --> 02:31:48.160
And now I'm a bro.

02:31:51.680 --> 02:31:52.400
Pop that color.

02:31:55.760 --> 02:31:58.320
Hey, Loki, you want to go bro out?

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:07.520
No, I've only been in one hockey game too, but it was, it was one word for you.

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:08.320
What?

02:32:09.520 --> 02:32:10.640
Dodge nads.

02:32:10.640 --> 02:32:12.480
I, I will say this though.

02:32:12.480 --> 02:32:18.480
And I somewhere, somewhere SSG100 Matt is going to be beaming when I say this, but I

02:32:18.480 --> 02:32:22.320
actually really, really enjoyed myself and I want to go again.

02:32:24.160 --> 02:32:24.800
Go sharks.

02:32:25.920 --> 02:32:26.560
All right.

02:32:26.560 --> 02:32:30.560
I think my favorite thing in the world was when they put the guy in the penalty box,

02:32:30.560 --> 02:32:32.000
they would put it up on the big screen.

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:35.920
And when it was the opposing team, the dude would go in the penalty box and the big shark

02:32:35.920 --> 02:32:38.160
teeth would come down and go chomp, chomp, chomp.

02:32:39.120 --> 02:32:43.120
I don't know why, but that made me cackle like nothing else the entire night.

02:32:43.120 --> 02:32:45.920
Cause the whole audience would do the chomp, chomp, chomp thing.

02:32:46.560 --> 02:32:50.240
And I'm like, that guy has to sit in a box and think about what he did.

02:32:52.400 --> 02:32:55.840
I'm like only in hockey where you get arrested for hooking.

02:32:56.880 --> 02:32:57.920
That guy's a hooker.

02:32:58.720 --> 02:32:59.120
All right.

02:32:59.120 --> 02:33:01.520
Anyway, were there any fights that broke out?

02:33:01.520 --> 02:33:03.920
Uh, no, but there was a dog pile, but no fights.

02:33:03.920 --> 02:33:05.040
I want, Oh my God.

02:33:05.040 --> 02:33:07.200
I wanted to go down there and punch some guy in the face.

02:33:07.200 --> 02:33:08.880
I was that little sneaky little.

02:33:09.600 --> 02:33:11.760
You want to know two facts?

02:33:11.760 --> 02:33:12.260
What?

02:33:12.720 --> 02:33:16.160
There are two fluids that will bounce on ice, blood and vomit.

02:33:17.760 --> 02:33:21.920
Well, I unfortunately saw neither at the, uh, haven't lived show.

02:33:21.920 --> 02:33:22.480
I know.

02:33:22.480 --> 02:33:22.980
I know.

02:33:23.520 --> 02:33:24.480
So there you go.

02:33:24.480 --> 02:33:27.520
Perhaps my son will when he goes to Disney on ice this weekend.

02:33:31.120 --> 02:33:33.520
I don't think a fight is supposed to break out.

02:33:34.480 --> 02:33:35.680
It'd be unexpected.

02:33:35.680 --> 02:33:36.720
I love that.

02:33:36.720 --> 02:33:37.760
Unfortunately, I'm not going.

02:33:37.760 --> 02:33:39.040
So, all right.

02:33:39.040 --> 02:33:43.440
SSU and Hunter Madden chat says, Rob, going to an NHL game is the greatest crossover.

02:33:44.080 --> 02:33:46.160
And as you went under, Matt says, Rob, I'll go with you.

02:33:46.160 --> 02:33:46.480
Fine.

02:33:46.480 --> 02:33:47.200
I'll come out.

02:33:47.200 --> 02:33:47.760
What's your team?

02:33:48.480 --> 02:33:49.920
It's gotta be New York.

02:33:49.920 --> 02:33:52.080
So I'll, uh, I'll come to New York city.

02:33:52.080 --> 02:33:53.200
We'll go to a game.

02:33:53.200 --> 02:33:54.640
Do they ever get to play the sharks?

02:33:54.640 --> 02:33:55.680
I'm still learning.

02:33:55.680 --> 02:33:56.240
Bear with me here.

02:33:56.240 --> 02:33:57.440
I don't know what teams are in what league.

02:33:57.440 --> 02:33:57.940
You know what?

02:33:59.120 --> 02:34:02.880
My, um, hometown, Mobile, Alabama has a hockey team.

02:34:02.880 --> 02:34:07.440
It's not NHL, but they have a team called the mystics S S T I C K S.

02:34:08.480 --> 02:34:09.200
Oh, I like that.

02:34:09.200 --> 02:34:10.240
That's a clever name.

02:34:10.240 --> 02:34:14.480
I did find it interesting though, that the Carolina hurricanes there, cause you know,

02:34:14.480 --> 02:34:18.080
I'm just, as somebody who's kind of newer to this, I'm, I'm not going to be able to help,

02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:22.880
but judge teams based on their colors, their mascots and their logos.

02:34:22.880 --> 02:34:23.360
Right?

02:34:23.360 --> 02:34:23.600
Yeah.

02:34:23.600 --> 02:34:24.720
That's what it's important.

02:34:24.720 --> 02:34:27.840
It's very important in choosing like what team you're going to root for.

02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:31.680
And the sharks, you know, I got to say, not just the fact that they're a local team,

02:34:31.680 --> 02:34:33.120
but teal's a rad color.

02:34:33.920 --> 02:34:37.040
The fact that they can play in a shark tank is hilarious.

02:34:37.040 --> 02:34:39.120
And shark is an amazing mascot.

02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:41.120
It's a, it's, it's, it's a win-win all around.

02:34:41.120 --> 02:34:46.240
Especially now that we have the super bowl shark, shark mascots are trending upwards.

02:34:46.240 --> 02:34:46.960
That's right.

02:34:46.960 --> 02:34:47.920
I know there was a mission.

02:34:47.920 --> 02:34:51.280
I did an ingress where it was about the sharks, but I got left shark as my badge.

02:34:51.280 --> 02:34:52.480
But anyway, I digress.

02:34:53.200 --> 02:34:57.760
The Carolina hurricanes, their logo looks like a red butthole.

02:34:57.760 --> 02:35:00.560
Like that's the logo for their team.

02:35:00.560 --> 02:35:04.640
And I'm like, we're, we just lost to the red buttholes.

02:35:06.720 --> 02:35:09.360
How did a shark lose to a butthole?

02:35:10.640 --> 02:35:11.040
Anyway.

02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:16.000
Well, it could have been a whale butthole in which case, you know, I could see that

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:17.280
there wouldn't be competition there.

02:35:18.640 --> 02:35:19.120
Anyway.

02:35:19.120 --> 02:35:19.680
All right.

02:35:19.680 --> 02:35:20.560
Put them together though.

02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:22.560
You get sharknado because the sharks are hurricane.

02:35:22.560 --> 02:35:22.800
All right.

02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:24.960
Anyway, I'm moving on.

02:35:26.800 --> 02:35:27.840
There's going to be a week.

02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:30.000
I come on this show and you're going to be like, how was your gaming week?

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:31.360
I'm going to be like, you know what?

02:35:31.360 --> 02:35:34.800
I played NHL 15 played blades of steel.

02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:37.680
He gave you like, which is also on the, who is Rob?

02:35:37.680 --> 02:35:39.200
Where did you do with him?

02:35:39.200 --> 02:35:39.520
All right.

02:35:39.520 --> 02:35:41.760
Anyway, uh, just a couple more stories for you guys.

02:35:41.760 --> 02:35:44.480
Then we're going to get to our Skype line at one eight seven seven game.

02:35:44.480 --> 02:35:48.000
Olr or a username on Skype is orange lounge radio.

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:48.400
Loki.

02:35:48.400 --> 02:35:52.640
They may have been wondering, what does all that shark talk have to do with anything in

02:35:52.640 --> 02:35:53.040
gaming?

02:35:53.040 --> 02:35:57.440
Well, I'm about to tell you because they're going to make a Katy Perry game.

02:35:57.920 --> 02:35:58.480
That's right.

02:35:58.480 --> 02:36:02.880
Katy Perry as in, you know, the one dance with sharks during the super bowl half time.

02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:08.160
And it's coming to you from glue mobile who was behind Kim Kardashian in Hollywood.

02:36:08.160 --> 02:36:11.520
So you have to know that which has a great soundtrack.

02:36:13.360 --> 02:36:18.480
You can hate on Kim Kardashian, Hollywood, all you want, but the soundtrack is awesome.

02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:21.920
I'm telling you, this is one of those games that I'm thank God that you do not have eye

02:36:21.920 --> 02:36:26.720
tracking software because it just wouldn't be for me.

02:36:27.440 --> 02:36:28.880
Why do you keep looking at the shark?

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:31.440
Because they're so awesome.

02:36:32.240 --> 02:36:34.800
I seriously want one of those for like Halloween.

02:36:35.520 --> 02:36:41.840
I have a feeling that's going to be a really overdone, like cosplay and Halloween costume

02:36:41.840 --> 02:36:42.800
later this year.

02:36:42.800 --> 02:36:46.480
But there's still a lot of time for a new meme to show up between now and Halloween.

02:36:46.480 --> 02:36:48.080
So there's a lot of time.

02:36:48.080 --> 02:36:48.800
We'll see.

02:36:48.800 --> 02:36:49.680
There's a lot of time.

02:36:51.200 --> 02:36:51.600
All right.

02:36:51.600 --> 02:36:55.040
But, uh, yeah, um, I'm not sure when it's supposed to be coming out.

02:36:55.040 --> 02:37:01.040
Apparently they're saying that, uh, Android or they have, uh, a five year deal with, uh,

02:37:02.240 --> 02:37:06.640
Katy Perry that they're going to put out, you know, some games, um, apparently on Android

02:37:06.640 --> 02:37:09.520
and iOS and I don't know.

02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:12.080
So hopefully, well, maybe we'll see that soon.

02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:17.760
William murder face with the lulls and chat saying it's a shame that the Katy Perry game

02:37:17.760 --> 02:37:19.280
won't be made by dark horse.

02:37:20.240 --> 02:37:20.560
Get it?

02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:22.080
Cause she has a song called dark.

02:37:23.760 --> 02:37:24.320
I understand.

02:37:25.600 --> 02:37:31.120
Hey, from Katy Perry to doctor who, I don't know what those two things have in common

02:37:31.120 --> 02:37:34.000
whatsoever, but, uh, work with me here on this transition.

02:37:34.720 --> 02:37:38.960
Apparently there's a new doctor who game that will help kids learn to code.

02:37:39.600 --> 02:37:45.760
It's a free doctor who game, uh, available from the BBC called the doctor and the Dalek.

02:37:45.760 --> 02:37:49.280
It's available on Android, iOS, and Amazon app stores.

02:37:49.280 --> 02:37:54.400
And it's a platforming adventure, but it includes logic based programming.

02:37:54.400 --> 02:37:58.720
You know, if, then, or, and all those types of things you see in programming.

02:37:58.720 --> 02:38:01.360
Peter Capaldi actually lends his voice to the game.

02:38:01.360 --> 02:38:07.440
It was written by Phil Ford, one of the series writers, there's three worlds and 12 levels.

02:38:07.440 --> 02:38:12.320
And you will go on the hunt for the orb of fates, an ancient device from the time war

02:38:12.320 --> 02:38:16.160
that unlocks the star bane, a weapon that can wipe out whole solar systems.

02:38:16.160 --> 02:38:18.720
And of course the Dalek and the cyber men are fighting over this.

02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:20.800
So the doctor serves as a mentor.

02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:22.560
He is not the main character.

02:38:23.200 --> 02:38:28.080
He's helping to control a reprogrammed Dalek in search of the artifact.

02:38:28.800 --> 02:38:34.080
BBC learning commissioned this game and it ties into the IT curriculum that the

02:38:34.080 --> 02:38:37.680
government has been focusing on over there with modern computer skills.

02:38:37.680 --> 02:38:38.720
That sounds like fun.

02:38:38.720 --> 02:38:41.360
It sounds like a modern version of something like Rocky's boots.

02:38:42.080 --> 02:38:46.000
But now using characters, you know, from doctor who beloved series like that.

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:47.680
Dark Sakura, would you check this out?

02:38:47.680 --> 02:38:48.960
You want to learn some programming?

02:38:49.760 --> 02:38:52.320
Although I'm sure the basics are things you probably already aware of,

02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:55.040
but I'd suggest it to people.

02:38:55.040 --> 02:38:55.600
Yeah.

02:38:55.600 --> 02:38:56.640
That'd be fun to check out.

02:38:56.640 --> 02:38:57.140
Yeah.

02:38:57.600 --> 02:38:58.100
All right.

02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:02.000
Loki, you want to play some doctor who learned a thing or two about programming?

02:39:02.880 --> 02:39:05.040
Uh, kind of already doing that.

02:39:05.040 --> 02:39:05.920
I think it's good.

02:39:05.920 --> 02:39:08.880
I like that they have that type of stuff that makes it accessible.

02:39:08.880 --> 02:39:11.120
Anything to get more people interested in that kind of stuff.

02:39:11.120 --> 02:39:11.680
I do too.

02:39:11.680 --> 02:39:14.320
This type of stuff I wish was around when I was a kid, to be honest.

02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:15.360
I really wish so.

02:39:16.320 --> 02:39:16.720
All right.

02:39:16.720 --> 02:39:20.240
Well, uh, that does it for the news tonight that we had on deck.

02:39:20.240 --> 02:39:21.760
So let's open up the Skype line.

02:39:21.760 --> 02:39:26.240
It's open 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:26.800
All one word.

02:39:26.800 --> 02:39:30.000
If you want to give us a call, Skype line is open now.

02:39:30.000 --> 02:39:33.600
In the meantime, I'll turn to Loki and see real quick if he has any last minute stories.

02:39:33.600 --> 02:39:34.480
I do not.

02:39:34.480 --> 02:39:35.040
You do not.

02:39:35.840 --> 02:39:37.040
It's a slow news week.

02:39:37.920 --> 02:39:38.560
It has been.

02:39:38.560 --> 02:39:41.440
There hasn't been as much going on this week as previous weeks.

02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:45.840
Just, but there's been like, it's just a few big things, you know, like the Zelda

02:39:45.840 --> 02:39:47.840
rumor, which isn't even really news.

02:39:48.720 --> 02:39:51.360
I'm going to try to go to the Twitter here while we wait for some calls, but Oh,

02:39:51.520 --> 02:39:52.640
Hey, the phones are lighting up.

02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:52.960
Hooray.

02:39:52.960 --> 02:39:53.520
Let's get to it.

02:39:53.520 --> 02:39:56.400
We do have a call on the line, so let's get to it.

02:39:56.400 --> 02:39:57.440
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:39:57.440 --> 02:39:58.240
Who's this?

02:39:58.240 --> 02:39:59.520
Hey guys, it's Jason.

02:39:59.520 --> 02:40:00.320
Hey, Jason.

02:40:00.320 --> 02:40:01.200
Good to see you.

02:40:01.200 --> 02:40:02.640
I see you on the webcams.

02:40:02.640 --> 02:40:02.960
Yes.

02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:06.000
With your epic new microphone, which I'm so jealous of.

02:40:07.520 --> 02:40:07.840
Yeah.

02:40:07.840 --> 02:40:11.600
If anybody, uh, if anybody hasn't really noticed, go listen to last week's episode

02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:12.960
and then listen to this week's episode.

02:40:12.960 --> 02:40:16.800
There's a tiny, tiny, a little bit of a difference.

02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:17.360
Yeah.

02:40:17.360 --> 02:40:20.400
If you, if you didn't notice, Jason has an epic new microphone.

02:40:20.400 --> 02:40:21.120
It's great.

02:40:21.360 --> 02:40:25.440
Well, they didn't, cause I haven't actually like posted anything about it publicly yet.

02:40:25.440 --> 02:40:29.520
Just a bunch of, uh, a bunch of friends, a couple of coworkers, and then some people

02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:33.520
that I do things with on a, on Twitch actually have seen it so far.

02:40:33.520 --> 02:40:36.240
We're all waiting for you to start a new podcast at some point.

02:40:36.240 --> 02:40:38.480
I'm sure, I'm sure that's going to be a thing someday.

02:40:38.480 --> 02:40:42.320
There's, there's a lot of stuff going on right now.

02:40:42.320 --> 02:40:45.600
And it's basically just seen, seen what can actually be committed to.

02:40:45.600 --> 02:40:46.240
I understand.

02:40:46.240 --> 02:40:47.600
Well, anyway, enough about all that.

02:40:47.600 --> 02:40:48.480
What's on your mind tonight?

02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:52.720
So we were having this discussion right at the top of the show, um, the discussion of

02:40:52.720 --> 02:40:55.600
Netflix and the 3DS and all that stuff, uh, kind of tangled in.

02:40:55.600 --> 02:40:58.560
And I said something that I've never really thought about before.

02:40:58.560 --> 02:41:06.000
Um, I said 3D is the sixties sci-fi expectation of immersion in the future.

02:41:06.880 --> 02:41:12.240
And I think, uh, I said it, so I'm admittedly biased, but I think that was actually like

02:41:12.240 --> 02:41:13.920
a shockingly accurate thing to say.

02:41:13.920 --> 02:41:20.000
Like they, 3D, 3D is, is still a very interesting effect.

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:23.440
You know, depth simulated depth is still a huge thing.

02:41:23.440 --> 02:41:29.680
Um, but considering that it's just limited to watching and experience, we've already

02:41:29.680 --> 02:41:30.800
surpassed that.

02:41:31.520 --> 02:41:37.520
Um, the, the point that I made in the conversation in chat was that even if it's not 3D computers

02:41:37.520 --> 02:41:43.840
and the internet have already completely usurped that because we can virtually be,

02:41:44.160 --> 02:41:49.120
anywhere in the world around virtually be around whoever we want to be around and have

02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:54.000
these, you know, previously impossible kind of connections with people and places and

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:59.600
things, not physically, but that's not necessarily always a requirement.

02:41:59.600 --> 02:42:04.000
I'm just, some day, Jason, as weird as it sounds, and I know people are going to take

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.240
this to a dirty place, but hear me out here.

02:42:06.240 --> 02:42:10.000
Some day, Jason, you're going to be able to feel them too, even though they might not

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:11.120
necessarily be right there.

02:42:11.120 --> 02:42:13.200
I mean, everything is one step closer to the holodeck.

02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:15.920
That's some day, but science fiction, right?

02:42:15.920 --> 02:42:21.520
You talk about the sixties 3D, I'm talking about star Trek, which to be fair is the sixties

02:42:21.520 --> 02:42:24.640
originally, but I guess my mind, my mind is set on next generation.

02:42:24.640 --> 02:42:25.360
Okay.

02:42:25.360 --> 02:42:27.040
Star Trek is next generation to me.

02:42:27.040 --> 02:42:31.440
So, uh, I just think about the holodeck and how a lot of gaming stuff gets one step closer

02:42:31.440 --> 02:42:32.000
to it.

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:32.320
Yeah.

02:42:32.320 --> 02:42:33.440
And it's just interesting.

02:42:33.440 --> 02:42:38.480
It's just funny that the way that we're getting there is also with no concept of touch, touch

02:42:38.480 --> 02:42:40.800
reactive, but no concept of touch.

02:42:41.600 --> 02:42:43.840
Akuma JP in chat with a good point though.

02:42:43.840 --> 02:42:44.960
Well, we can print it.

02:42:45.600 --> 02:42:48.800
So we are, I mean, we are getting closer to that touch.

02:42:48.800 --> 02:42:55.520
I mean, you can, you can visualize it and you can make it granted, maybe not today.

02:42:55.520 --> 02:43:00.160
Like there's a lot of limitations on what it is you can do, but when they're advertising

02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:04.800
a fucking three dimensional pen in sky mall, rest in peace.

02:43:05.520 --> 02:43:09.760
And now, you know, where I saw this last on a plane, I'm like, the future is here.

02:43:11.040 --> 02:43:16.960
It's a, those, those, I don't even know what the proper, what the proper marketing name

02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:17.440
for it is.

02:43:17.440 --> 02:43:22.320
I want to call them like sky writing pins, uh, are definitely interesting.

02:43:22.320 --> 02:43:27.280
I, I think I'm going to have a disconnect from it until I can actually get my hands

02:43:27.280 --> 02:43:27.840
on it.

02:43:27.840 --> 02:43:31.920
Not to mention, I'm not exactly the creative type in that way anyways.

02:43:31.920 --> 02:43:34.640
So, but yeah, it's, it's absolutely interesting.

02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:39.680
3d printing, uh, both at the personal scale as well as the professional scale.

02:43:39.680 --> 02:43:42.560
Like that is, that is a huge step forward.

02:43:42.560 --> 02:43:46.960
I think the problem is, is that printing has a lot of permanence to it.

02:43:46.960 --> 02:43:53.280
Um, that it's still like worlds away from being holodeck, from being seen creation,

02:43:53.280 --> 02:43:56.880
destruction and rebuilding and anything along those lines.

02:43:56.880 --> 02:44:00.880
Like 3d printing is going to be better for, uh, architecture.

02:44:00.880 --> 02:44:04.320
And there's been talk about like medical 3d printing and all that kind of stuff.

02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:10.560
Like that's going to apply with permanence, with things that have to have a place in the

02:44:10.560 --> 02:44:10.880
world.

02:44:12.240 --> 02:44:15.200
So, uh, it's just, it's just crazy seeing how far we've come.

02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:19.280
And if you think about it, all this 3d printing stuff, this technology is still really, really

02:44:19.280 --> 02:44:20.080
new and emerging.

02:44:20.080 --> 02:44:23.840
I mean, this is only really within the past two years, you know, that we're seeing this

02:44:23.840 --> 02:44:27.680
really start to take off and it's, it's really weird to think like, where the hell are we

02:44:27.680 --> 02:44:29.280
going to be in five more years?

02:44:29.280 --> 02:44:33.760
Yeah, it's, it's the best time to be, it's the best time to be a geek.

02:44:33.760 --> 02:44:36.400
What a time to be alive, even more the truth.

02:44:36.400 --> 02:44:38.000
What a time to be alive, right?

02:44:38.880 --> 02:44:44.720
I've talked about, uh, as, as like gaming has kind of come and gone, uh, as I have kind

02:44:44.720 --> 02:44:46.960
of gotten into and out of gaming and that kind of stuff.

02:44:46.960 --> 02:44:54.560
I've always talked about as a kid, I always identified as a gamer, but in my adulthood,

02:44:54.560 --> 02:44:59.360
both professionally and personally, I've kind of noticed that it's just tech centric and

02:44:59.360 --> 02:45:01.280
gaming was kind of the best expression of that.

02:45:01.280 --> 02:45:02.960
I play games on a console.

02:45:02.960 --> 02:45:04.240
I play games on a computer.

02:45:04.240 --> 02:45:04.960
I'm a gamer.

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:13.280
But I've kind of noticed that I'm more general tech and just very, very happily gaming is

02:45:13.280 --> 02:45:17.680
one of, you know, the, the primary subdivisions categories, whatever you want to call it.

02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:21.440
It's kind of funny you put it that way, because if you think about it, the evolution of this

02:45:21.440 --> 02:45:24.640
show, this very show has gone down a very similar path, right?

02:45:24.640 --> 02:45:28.720
We were about DDR and then it was, well, we've got to talk about some more music games cause

02:45:28.720 --> 02:45:29.840
we're not making DDR.

02:45:29.840 --> 02:45:33.760
And then it was, well, I guess really we just like video games and DDR is just the video

02:45:33.760 --> 02:45:35.040
game we're all playing right now.

02:45:35.040 --> 02:45:36.400
Let's talk about video games.

02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:38.720
And now we're on the voice of geeks network.

02:45:38.720 --> 02:45:41.920
It turns out video games is really just one of many geeky things I'm into, you know?

02:45:41.920 --> 02:45:42.480
Absolutely.

02:45:42.480 --> 02:45:47.520
I think there's a lot of crossover, although admittedly, because I focus so much time on

02:45:47.520 --> 02:45:52.880
gaming, I don't get a chance to watch as much anime, but I appreciate that fandom.

02:45:52.880 --> 02:45:53.760
It's there.

02:45:53.760 --> 02:45:58.720
There's a lot of fun stuff that goes on over there, but we've got Rama and Patty and Ari

02:45:58.720 --> 02:46:01.440
talking about all that over on the anime jam session and so forth.

02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:04.240
That's why I love what we're doing here at VOG and so forth.

02:46:04.240 --> 02:46:08.480
So absolutely leave it to the people that can speak definitively on that and be a very

02:46:08.480 --> 02:46:11.200
happy enabler or just a fan.

02:46:11.200 --> 02:46:12.240
Yeah, exactly.

02:46:12.240 --> 02:46:12.960
Exactly.

02:46:12.960 --> 02:46:13.520
Anyway, sorry.

02:46:13.520 --> 02:46:17.280
Not to, not to turn your call into self-promotion, but you know, it's gonna happen.

02:46:17.280 --> 02:46:18.480
Sometimes it's gonna happen.

02:46:18.480 --> 02:46:21.600
I like, I like the, uh, the, the philosophic.

02:46:22.240 --> 02:46:24.320
Is that even a proper conjunction?

02:46:24.320 --> 02:46:25.360
I like philosophical.

02:46:25.360 --> 02:46:25.760
Thank you.

02:46:25.760 --> 02:46:27.520
I like philosophical topics.

02:46:27.520 --> 02:46:29.200
Right word, wrong pronunciation.

02:46:31.760 --> 02:46:32.240
Whatever.

02:46:32.240 --> 02:46:33.360
That's all right.

02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:34.080
English.

02:46:34.080 --> 02:46:34.560
That's all right.

02:46:34.560 --> 02:46:36.400
That's why you're the perfect voiceover guy.

02:46:36.400 --> 02:46:36.720
All right.

02:46:38.240 --> 02:46:40.320
Uh, if you, I'll take your word for that one.

02:46:40.320 --> 02:46:41.040
All right.

02:46:41.040 --> 02:46:43.200
All right, my friend, I'm gonna let you go so we can get some more calls.

02:46:43.200 --> 02:46:44.000
Have a good night, everyone.

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:45.360
Talk to you in the future.

02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:47.120
All right.

02:46:47.120 --> 02:46:47.680
Bye.

02:46:47.680 --> 02:46:48.180
Bye.

02:46:48.880 --> 02:46:53.440
1-877-GAMO-L-R or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:46:53.440 --> 02:46:56.880
I'm always happy when Jason calls in the show so I can check on his beard progress.

02:46:58.160 --> 02:46:58.400
Man.

02:46:58.400 --> 02:46:59.360
It's amazing.

02:46:59.360 --> 02:47:03.040
You know, there's, there's going to come a day though when Jason's going to be like,

02:47:03.040 --> 02:47:04.240
yeah, I just shaved it off.

02:47:04.240 --> 02:47:06.720
You know, I just, I just felt like shaving it off.

02:47:06.720 --> 02:47:13.280
I'm going to tell Jason what I told our friend, Will, that he needs to braid it like a dwarf.

02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:17.520
No, he needs, no, Jason looks just dwarven braids.

02:47:17.520 --> 02:47:20.560
But if he ever does come that day where he's just going to be like, you know what?

02:47:20.560 --> 02:47:21.920
I'm just going to shave it off.

02:47:21.920 --> 02:47:26.000
He needs to like donate the hair to one of those charities that makes wigs or something.

02:47:26.000 --> 02:47:29.200
I actually wonder what happens if you take a straightener to a beard.

02:47:30.480 --> 02:47:30.880
I don't know.

02:47:32.240 --> 02:47:35.680
I want someone to show me what it looks like when you use a hair straightener on a beard.

02:47:38.560 --> 02:47:40.720
Isn't the answer on Reddit or Google somewhere?

02:47:40.720 --> 02:47:41.680
I'm about to Google this shit.

02:47:41.680 --> 02:47:42.960
Can you go to Ask Reddit?

02:47:42.960 --> 02:47:43.600
Dear Reddit.

02:47:45.200 --> 02:47:45.760
All right.

02:47:45.760 --> 02:47:54.160
1-877-GAMO-L-R or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

02:47:54.160 --> 02:47:57.280
And Jason is in chat saying, there's nothing wrong with braiding.

02:47:57.280 --> 02:47:59.200
It's less permanent than shaving.

02:47:59.200 --> 02:47:59.680
There you go.

02:48:00.640 --> 02:48:03.840
I was trying to go to the Twitters to see if we had any tweets.

02:48:03.840 --> 02:48:08.000
SSG100Matt did tweet us, you know, we're going up against the Grammys tonight.

02:48:09.680 --> 02:48:14.160
My God, I really, really cannot stand the Grammys.

02:48:14.160 --> 02:48:18.160
And it's not just the competitive thing about the fact that, oh, they're on the same time as our show.

02:48:18.160 --> 02:48:20.800
I mean, talk about, talk about irrelevant.

02:48:20.800 --> 02:48:21.760
Let's just leave it at that.

02:48:21.760 --> 02:48:24.880
But I'm sure there were some fine performances in some great fashion.

02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:30.640
But anyway, SSG100Matt did tweet us and say, no need to check up on the Grammy winners.

02:48:30.640 --> 02:48:33.520
Betty White won song and album of the year.

02:48:34.800 --> 02:48:36.800
Of course, she always would give her all the awards.

02:48:36.800 --> 02:48:37.600
She wins everything.

02:48:39.680 --> 02:48:44.720
You know, the thing about the Grammys is that I'm sure your favorite song didn't even get nominated.

02:48:44.720 --> 02:48:48.240
I bet your favorite album of the year didn't even get nominated.

02:48:48.320 --> 02:48:51.920
So, I don't know, what do the Grammys even mean?

02:48:51.920 --> 02:48:56.160
I found a picture of a YouTube clip of someone using a straightener on his beard,

02:48:56.160 --> 02:48:58.640
but it was a tiny beard and not a dwarf beard.

02:48:58.640 --> 02:49:00.000
Like a beard like me, huh?

02:49:01.120 --> 02:49:02.720
No, it was a little bit longer than yours.

02:49:02.720 --> 02:49:09.120
It's kind of one of those scraggly, you know, face throws, but not like an epic beard like.

02:49:09.120 --> 02:49:09.840
All right.

02:49:09.840 --> 02:49:10.800
Oh, sorry.

02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:16.960
I was just going to say, I'm going to just give a few more minutes here for there to be a call to come in here.

02:49:18.400 --> 02:49:21.760
But last call, if you want to get in for the night, 1877 Game O-L-R,

02:49:21.760 --> 02:49:24.480
or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:49:25.520 --> 02:49:29.600
People in chat is talking about Beck won album of the year.

02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:30.160
For real?

02:49:31.200 --> 02:49:33.600
That's actually my favorite.

02:49:33.600 --> 02:49:35.600
They had an album out this year?

02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:36.240
Well, Beck.

02:49:36.240 --> 02:49:36.560
Oh, yeah.

02:49:36.560 --> 02:49:38.320
Beck's still been making music.

02:49:38.320 --> 02:49:39.440
Alan likes him a lot.

02:49:39.440 --> 02:49:42.320
I bet he'll be tickled to hear about that.

02:49:42.320 --> 02:49:44.080
That's kind of interesting to hear that.

02:49:44.080 --> 02:49:48.880
But I thought they were going to give it to that British guy that stole the Tom Petty song.

02:49:48.880 --> 02:49:50.480
I thought that's what they were all saying.

02:49:50.480 --> 02:49:53.040
But anyway, as much as I appreciate Beck,

02:49:53.040 --> 02:49:54.880
that wasn't my favorite of the album of the year last year.

02:49:54.880 --> 02:49:56.080
I didn't even realize one was out.

02:49:56.640 --> 02:50:00.160
Anyway, 13X forever or 13X forever.

02:50:00.160 --> 02:50:02.240
I can never remember which way you prefer it to be pronounced.

02:50:02.240 --> 02:50:03.440
I think it's 13X forever.

02:50:05.360 --> 02:50:06.800
Sends us a tweet saying,

02:50:06.800 --> 02:50:10.160
so I just finished Chrono Trigger for the first time.

02:50:10.160 --> 02:50:11.600
Closing time, huh?

02:50:11.680 --> 02:50:13.840
From now on, it will never be the same.

02:50:13.840 --> 02:50:18.000
In reference to the song we depart you with every week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:22.160
Well, I'm glad you got to kind of hear that song in the game.

02:50:22.160 --> 02:50:23.920
And maybe it was a little surprise for you.

02:50:23.920 --> 02:50:25.920
The actual name of it is Too Far Away Times.

02:50:26.640 --> 02:50:27.280
Oh, thank you.

02:50:29.600 --> 02:50:32.320
Also, I wanted to just give a shout out because I saw a few tweets on this.

02:50:32.320 --> 02:50:35.120
Thank you to those of you that nominated us in the podcast awards.

02:50:35.680 --> 02:50:37.920
If you forgot to do that, it's too late, unfortunately.

02:50:37.920 --> 02:50:39.760
They closed on February 6th.

02:50:39.760 --> 02:50:42.240
And I'm somewhere on the fence with all that stuff.

02:50:42.240 --> 02:50:44.880
Although certainly the promotion is really great.

02:50:44.880 --> 02:50:49.520
And I'm always very thankful if we can get nominated to get that additional exposure.

02:50:49.520 --> 02:50:56.400
Because as an indie podcast, it's very hard for us sometimes to get that exposure.

02:50:56.400 --> 02:51:00.640
Especially if we focus everything we do on the podcast.

02:51:00.640 --> 02:51:02.240
So we don't have a YouTube.

02:51:02.240 --> 02:51:03.600
We don't have a Twitch.

02:51:03.600 --> 02:51:04.720
We don't do...

02:51:04.720 --> 02:51:05.600
I mean, we have those.

02:51:05.600 --> 02:51:07.600
We don't really focus on them, you know what I mean?

02:51:08.160 --> 02:51:10.400
We don't make things specific for YouTube.

02:51:10.400 --> 02:51:11.680
Because Jason's probably sitting there going,

02:51:11.680 --> 02:51:13.440
wait a minute, you do have a YouTube.

02:51:13.440 --> 02:51:16.160
But the YouTube is for what we're doing now.

02:51:16.160 --> 02:51:18.160
We don't do a lot of custom created things.

02:51:18.160 --> 02:51:22.400
It's not our focus or what have you.

02:51:22.400 --> 02:51:26.880
So anyway, getting that exposure is great.

02:51:28.800 --> 02:51:30.880
I don't know if we'll get actually nominated or not.

02:51:30.880 --> 02:51:32.560
But then there's that whole side of it where it's like,

02:51:32.560 --> 02:51:34.880
well, it's also a giant popularity contest.

02:51:34.880 --> 02:51:35.600
And I don't know.

02:51:36.560 --> 02:51:40.400
I just hope we can keep it indie and get some additional exposure

02:51:40.400 --> 02:51:42.000
for the hardworking indie people out there.

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:42.400
And you know what?

02:51:42.400 --> 02:51:44.000
I always say it at the end of every show.

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.960
If you didn't like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio,

02:51:46.960 --> 02:51:50.400
then at least tell a friend or two about the show and help us spread the word.

02:51:50.400 --> 02:51:53.280
Because it is the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:51:53.280 --> 02:51:57.120
But there's lots of voices out there that aren't participating with the program.

02:51:58.160 --> 02:51:58.660
All right.

02:51:59.520 --> 02:52:01.040
And good, Jason in chat saying,

02:52:01.040 --> 02:52:04.000
the YouTube videos are not a unique product.

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:05.520
It's another medium for the show.

02:52:06.480 --> 02:52:09.600
It's another way to deliver the bread and butter of what it is that we do.

02:52:10.800 --> 02:52:12.400
And he says, I know exactly what you meant.

02:52:12.400 --> 02:52:12.900
Thank you.

02:52:13.920 --> 02:52:14.420
All right.

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:17.760
Anyhow, the phone's not ringing.

02:52:17.760 --> 02:52:19.840
So I guess no more voices.

02:52:19.840 --> 02:52:21.920
I want to continue tonight.

02:52:21.920 --> 02:52:24.320
I guess everybody's too distracted with them silly Grammys.

02:52:24.960 --> 02:52:28.240
But if you do have other thoughts after the show, you can always email us.

02:52:28.240 --> 02:52:30.880
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:52:30.880 --> 02:52:35.280
And you can also hit us up on social media and our forums over at vognetwork.com.

02:52:35.280 --> 02:52:39.920
Where we will continue some of the discussions from tonight's show throughout the week.

02:52:39.920 --> 02:52:42.720
And give you a preview of some stories to come next week.

02:52:43.360 --> 02:52:46.400
Anyway, we have reached the end of another episode of the show.

02:52:46.400 --> 02:52:49.600
Thank you guys very much for listening and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

02:52:49.600 --> 02:52:51.120
Since I already gave you that whole spiel,

02:52:51.120 --> 02:52:53.840
we'll go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

02:52:53.840 --> 02:52:55.520
I will start with my final thought for the night.

02:52:55.520 --> 02:52:57.440
My final thought for the night is,

02:52:57.440 --> 02:53:00.160
I'm going to try and play at least one new game this week.

02:53:00.160 --> 02:53:03.040
So I have something new to talk about during my gaming week next week.

02:53:03.040 --> 02:53:08.320
As much as I love Diablo 3, and season 2 starts Friday, and I can't wait,

02:53:08.320 --> 02:53:11.440
I'm going to really try to do something new for you guys.

02:53:12.240 --> 02:53:13.680
Dark Sakura, your final thought tonight?

02:53:14.400 --> 02:53:16.160
I like big butts and I cannot lie.

02:53:17.280 --> 02:53:18.560
You other brothers can't deny?

02:53:19.600 --> 02:53:21.200
They could deny it. They'd be wrong.

02:53:22.560 --> 02:53:25.760
And last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:53:26.400 --> 02:53:29.040
Um, I'm working on my game some more.

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:31.760
Hopefully I will have something...

02:53:31.760 --> 02:53:34.080
I want to get more than one level done for this week.

02:53:34.720 --> 02:53:35.840
And I want to get...

02:53:35.840 --> 02:53:37.840
I want to be rated five strips of bacon.

02:53:38.880 --> 02:53:41.040
Sorry, it only goes up to three, possibly four.

02:53:41.040 --> 02:53:41.280
What?

02:53:42.960 --> 02:53:44.720
Are you sure it's not like a thing you unlock,

02:53:44.720 --> 02:53:47.040
where like five is the super secret level?

02:53:47.040 --> 02:53:49.520
Four would be super secret, actually, maybe.

02:53:51.200 --> 02:53:53.440
Already blown away the secrets of your game and it's not even...

02:53:53.440 --> 02:53:54.480
I haven't decided yet.

02:53:54.480 --> 02:53:56.720
It's just a thought right now.

02:53:56.720 --> 02:53:57.600
All right.

02:53:57.600 --> 02:53:58.720
All right, that's going to do it.

02:53:58.960 --> 02:53:59.840
Wait, wait, wait.

02:53:59.840 --> 02:54:01.520
I did not make a reference to Anaconda.

02:54:02.320 --> 02:54:04.400
I made a reference to Sir Mix-A-Lot.

02:54:04.400 --> 02:54:04.880
Get it right.

02:54:05.520 --> 02:54:06.560
All right, fair enough.

02:54:08.160 --> 02:54:09.200
That's going to do it.

02:54:09.200 --> 02:54:10.640
Thank you very much, everybody,

02:54:10.640 --> 02:54:12.400
for listening to another week of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:54:12.400 --> 02:54:14.240
We will be back in seven days,

02:54:14.240 --> 02:54:18.800
just after Valentine's Day to do it all over again.

02:54:18.800 --> 02:54:22.240
And, you know, I know there's a lot of people that on Valentine's Day are like,

02:54:22.240 --> 02:54:25.600
you know, well, I'm single and I hate Valentine's Day.

02:54:25.600 --> 02:54:27.920
You know who needs love on Valentine's Day?

02:54:27.920 --> 02:54:29.200
All the people who are massacred

02:54:29.200 --> 02:54:31.280
in the name of getting married when the church banned it?

02:54:31.280 --> 02:54:33.840
No. Kittens and puppies.

02:54:34.480 --> 02:54:34.720
So...

02:54:34.720 --> 02:54:37.040
Go adopt a kitten on Valentine's Day.

02:54:37.040 --> 02:54:39.280
Yes, that would always be a great thought,

02:54:39.280 --> 02:54:43.440
is if you are going to be alone on Valentine's Day,

02:54:43.440 --> 02:54:46.160
I'm sure there's a kitten or a puppy that would really love.

02:54:48.400 --> 02:54:51.120
I will be hugging Midna.

02:54:52.320 --> 02:54:53.840
Have a great week, everybody.

02:54:53.840 --> 02:54:55.120
On that note, we will leave it at that.

02:54:55.120 --> 02:54:55.680
Have a great week.

02:54:55.680 --> 02:54:57.360
