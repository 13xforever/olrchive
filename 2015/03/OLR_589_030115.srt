Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Tonight on the eve of GDC, Valve announces that they too are joining the VR scene with HTC by revealing the Vive headset for release later this year.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We'll tell you more about the week in gaming news along with your comments, feedback, and calls right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live with our 589th episode for this March the 1st of 2015.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My name is Rob Roberts or Skie on Twitter, S-K-I-E, joining me as always my co-hosts DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And Tech Master Loki is here as well.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I want to start tonight and kind of address something that I think is on a lot of people's minds this week.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Let's go to a clip. I don't usually do this but I want to play a clip here at the top of the show.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But darkness did cover the world once, in legend.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We know so little about the Keyblade War, only that it was just the beginning.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Amidst that crisis a precious light was found.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It is a curious tale and one worth exploring.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000
They say ruin brings about creation, so what then would another Keyblade War bring?

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
When the darkness falls will we be found worthy of the precious light the legend speaks of?

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I must have these answers.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The Keyblade needs to be forged and with it the door to the Keyblade War unlocked.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So obviously there that is the great Leonard Nimoy, who as I'm sure all of you know by now passed away on Friday at the age of 83.

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You know, obviously Leonard Nimoy didn't contribute as much to video gaming probably as he did in the worlds of movies and the worlds of literature and some other places.

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But he definitely had a presence in video gaming.

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Not only of course with his role that he had there in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, Kingdom Hearts 3D Dream Drop Distance.

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Assumably Kingdom Hearts 3, if those parts have already been recorded or not we don't know.

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But also Civilization 4, you might not have known this but he was the narrator in Civilization 4.

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He also is a big voice in Star Trek Online.

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh absolutely.

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
His is the first you hear in the game.

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Absolutely. In fact you have some information on some things going on in Star Trek Online about Mr. Nimoy right?

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Later on.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And isn't he like, what's that? Wasn't he part of C-Man?

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Of course, how could we forget? Of course he is. He is the narrator in C-Man.

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That was actually the first game that he was a part of was C-Man. Doing the narrator and all of that.

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So some of those great clips we've played on the show previously.

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Well in Star Trek Online they're actually going to be putting a big monument to him in the game.

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But lately everyone's been converging at Vulcan to pay their respects.

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Since Star Trek Online is basically the old school Star Trek universe without the divergence of the movie.

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So it's what continued happening after the movie version split off.

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
So Vulcan still exists.

40
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So yeah, big thing there. I actually re-upped my account over there.

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Oh cool.

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But I didn't get a chance to log in because the servers were so crazy busy.

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So I actually couldn't get into the game.

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It seems like a lot of people maybe want to revisit Star Trek Online because of this news.

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And you know I know sometimes it's kind of weird to like really mourn these celebrities who pass away.

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Because you know it's not like you knew them in real life.

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But I kind of think with Leonard Nimoy, I think to anybody who considers themselves a geek.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Leonard Nimoy probably in some part played a part in that.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Because he had his hands in so much of geek culture.

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And he embraced that geek culture despite what everybody said about his first bibliography.

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The I am not Spock which was all a misunderstanding anyway.

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He didn't you know ever really reject that.

53
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You know just obviously through Star Trek which so so many geeks grew up with in one way or another.

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But as well as video games and some of these other awesome things he did.

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Dark Soccer you were saying that when you think of Leonard Nimoy you think of something completely different right?

56
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Well I mean I always think of Star Trek but he was Galvatron in the Transformers movie that came out in 80 something 86.

57
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So that was a big thing. I mean that movie also had Orson Welles in it.

58
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So you've got and Robert Stack isn't he dead too?

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I think so. I think he did better.

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
At least three of the actors in that movie.

61
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Oh Robert Stack is awesome.

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yeah yeah.

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So he was Ultra Magnus and Orson Welles was in there.

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So I mean and I talked a little bit about this on Hoard House this week but I because we had the news that you know he was ill.

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And I remember him a lot from these I feel like a lot of my love of space is thanks in part to Leonard Nimoy.

66
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Because I remember I had these videos growing up when I was a kid and they were like some they were like educational short films.

67
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But they were just you know they're really cool and would explain things about the planets and you know what we knew out there in the solar system at the time in the 80s when Pluto was still a planet y'all.

68
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's a planet again.

69
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Is it a planet again?

70
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I think they're working on it.

71
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It will always be a planet in my heart to be honest.

72
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But you know Leonard Nimoy narrated those videos and I think he was really big on education and that as well.

73
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You saw him in a lot of educational initiatives as well.

74
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Again a way that he played into our childhood.

75
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Well another thing for me too is that he was actually I guess not necessarily a big pivotal reason why I converted to Judaism.

76
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But learning about his Jewish roots definitely inspired me especially learning that the live long and prosper thing that I can only do with one hand is actually from the priestly benediction in an Orthodox temple.

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Right.

78
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
And he did Yiddish theater.

79
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
He was fluent in Yiddish.

80
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I grew up speaking it.

81
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:03,000
He was in productions of Fiddler on the Roof and it was his Star Trek fame even when he went back to doing theater after.

82
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yeah.

83
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That actually really pushed the genre of Yiddish theater back into the four.

84
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm going to really hope that none of my coworkers are listening because I'm about to out my boss as a closet Trekkie.

85
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Although that's something you should never be ashamed of in my opinion.

86
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But when I got the news that Leonard Nimoy passed away I went to talk to my boss about it because I knew she was big on Star Trek like she used to do a lot of the you know super nerd stuff that I'm doing now.

87
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And she was sharing stories about meeting Leonard Nimoy years ago and seeing him in theater where a particular play where he was playing Van Gogh's brother.

88
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So you know he he was much more versatile than just Spock.

89
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Van Gogh's brother is the only person who bought any of his work.

90
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeah.

91
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
But not just the fact that he in and of himself had a big love of fantasy.

92
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I mean we're not going to talk about the song of Bilbo Baggins but you know.

93
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But I mean on top of that there you know he contributed so deeply to the arts.

94
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:16,000
He actually was a big continuous contributor to various artistic foundries as well as to an ongoing Yiddish theater.

95
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
A few Yiddish theater societies.

96
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So he's done a lot more for the public arts than people might think.

97
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm going to our chat room. Of course we do tape live. I haven't said it yet but we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.

98
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
voggenetwork.com. 6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwell show.

99
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And if you are listening live you can of course head over to our chat room.

100
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Live.voggenetwork.com.

101
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And obviously many many people taking a moment to remember some parts of Leonard Nimoy's career and the effect that it had on them.

102
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
SSJ100Matt saying saddest part of my week. Fifth Dream I posted some stuff of him as Galvatron the other day.

103
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And the intro to C-Man. Of course a few people in there.

104
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
ragenator remembering the whole I'll friend your butt joke which you know might seem tasteless at a time like this.

105
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
However I think humor is a great way many of us cope with a lot of different tragedies.

106
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Brad from Pod Culture letting us know Star Trek Online has got one hell of a graphics upgrade since the last time I logged in.

107
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:27,000
ActDef saying Leonard Nimoy is a legend. Tigerclaw Leonard Nimoy was the voice of Sentinel Prime in Transformers Dark of the Moon.

108
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Oh and Michael Bay was related to him.

109
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
SSJ100Matt saying Nimoy was such a monumental figure in the geek nerddom.

110
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
He was never a vain or jerk celeb and was cool to the fans. He was a classy guy on and off the screen.

111
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Absolutely. I mean all those things I think contribute to him. I think too because so many celebrities we see out there.

112
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You see the whole like oh they had to go to rehab or they're on their seventh marriage.

113
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Or you know they got caught at some party doing something nasty.

114
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You know like Leonard Nimoy never got really caught up in any of that.

115
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
He got caught at that party watching Star Wars.

116
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,000
What's going to happen next? They're going to let the same guy direct Star Trek and Star Wars? What's up with that?

117
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So anyhow I just I want to take a moment here to just acknowledge as I'm sure many of you are thinking of Leonard Nimoy this weekend and maybe the impact he had on your life.

118
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And not only his contributions to movies and television and literature but just you know reminding y'all he did work with games too.

119
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
He was a huge part of video games. I consider Civilization 4 to be one of the greatest games in the last decade.

120
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So and he's a big part of that and of course Star Trek Online a hugely popular MMO.

121
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And of course I know many many many of y'all like Kingdom Hearts. You may not have played the games that are not one or two but I mean these side games.

122
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I honestly never knew he was in Kingdom Hearts.

123
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yeah I think a lot of people did.

124
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I stopped midway through the first one so.

125
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yeah of course so. But you have memories of Leonard Nimoy too I'm sure somewhere right?

126
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yeah I watched Star Trek.

127
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Of course. So anyhow.

128
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So we have to change the fortune cookie because Brad asks us to.

129
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
We'll get to that at the end of the show.

130
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I will just mention real quick too I think this is an important note. Leonard Nimoy passed away because of complications related to smoking.

131
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
He didn't smoke at the end of his life. In fact he'd quit for many many years.

132
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
But some of the damage that he'd done over the years kind of came back to get him.

133
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So you know if you are a fan of Leonard Nimoy and you're somebody out there who happens to be a smoker.

134
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm somebody who used to smoke. I smoked in the past so I don't want to like talk down to anybody.

135
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Certainly not what I want to do and I kind of understand some of the struggles and I understand you know the stress relief that comes with that and so forth.

136
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
But I do want to take this moment to say you know maybe now is the day to make a change.

137
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Maybe today is the day you're going to quit or you're going to try something new to quit.

138
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Or you're going to do something that will extend your own life so that hopefully you don't you know end up with this that you had to learn from watching Leonard Nimoy go through it.

139
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So again I'm not like trying to be like talking down or parental but I just feel like this is something that maybe we could turn a very negative thing into a positive thing.

140
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And if I knew that maybe this little rant would make one person maybe stop then I'd be like totally worth it totally worth it.

141
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So just wanting to put that out there for people.

142
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Anyway let's move on we move on there's a lot actually not as much going on in the gaming world this week as there have been in previous weeks.

143
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,000
But we are on the heels of GDC PAX East coming up this week and there are a few things we want to get into.

144
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So we will move on we carry on with the week in gaming news and we're going to start it off as we always do.

145
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Talking about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing this week.

146
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Dark Sakura how was your gaming week?

147
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I played a little Star Trek online of course. Well tried to.

148
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I played Final Fantasy 14 so I could show up for the La La Twerk wedding.

149
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That was the dumbest shit I've ever seen in my life.

150
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The eternal bonding ceremony in Final Fantasy it's seriously like the hokiest hoke that ever hoped.

151
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Like oh we're going to have wings and fly into the air and smooch.

152
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Fuck that's just ridiculous. Becky was watching over my shoulder and she was like what the hell is this?

153
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And then she was like that chapel is really over the top.

154
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm really upset you did not enjoy my twerking down the aisle too.

155
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Since there's no flower girl or ring bearer built into the game I felt like and the folks that were getting married it was it was a bro wedding last night.

156
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And you know it was just it was the whole theme was over the top. I mean so as if the ceremony itself and the game is not already over the top.

157
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You know we were doing it. I was fine with that part. It was the ceremony. It was stupid.

158
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I was like the hell stupid is this. And so I just want and everyone was like we're running around and speedos like that's great.

159
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
But I had I like the people who are running around in the leopard spotted speedos.

160
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
And I was just like I'm just gonna be cute and wear the yukata and have my little chocobo chick hanging around.

161
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I wore a yukata to the last wedding I went to in game so.

162
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
But I'm still trying to convince someone to be my eternal bond mate just for shits and giggles.

163
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Just to do it.

164
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So that we can afford a house.

165
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
There you go.

166
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Because that's the only way you can.

167
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And then I played of course a Dragon Age Inquisition which I'm still kind of slowly going through it.

168
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
But Becky and I were because Becky doesn't really like the games but she likes the characters in it because I've introduced her to him.

169
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
At least as far as my impression is.

170
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:13,000
So basically it was just me walking around making inappropriate comments outside of the game about Cullen's butt.

171
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And then there was that picture on Tumblr that looked like the showgirls poster.

172
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Which makes me have to draw Cullen like the showgirls poster now.

173
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Wow.

174
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Wow.

175
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

176
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Speaking of awkward.

177
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Bobby Blackwell's in our chat room.

178
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
He was not able to do a show tonight unfortunately because he's recovering from being sick.

179
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
But he's able to listen.

180
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And he says Dark Sakura.

181
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
That chocobo head at the end was fabulous.

182
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
He was also at that wedding last night in game.

183
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And one of the grooms last night wore a chocobo head as the ceremony was ending.

184
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And it's that really cheesy scene.

185
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Well you might have missed it because I think you logged out right before.

186
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But it's when they actually get onto the two person chocobo mount and actually like ride off.

187
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Oh yeah I missed that.

188
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I was hanging out with Becky.

189
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Sure you don't want to ignore IRL for in game stuff no matter what it is.

190
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm going to be at another wedding I guess this week in game.

191
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Oh that's right I have to miss that one.

192
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
There's two other guild leads.

193
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I might not be able to stay up for the whole thing because I have to be at work early in the stupid morning.

194
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
But now I love that because Gold Saucer is in Final Fantasy 14.

195
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's a great place for after parties for the weddings.

196
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I haven't been to Gold Saucer yet so.

197
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Oh yeah check it out it's great.

198
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm actually still working on building up my thing with the cat people.

199
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The violent cat people.

200
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The Amolja.

201
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Oh the Amolja yeah yeah yeah.

202
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
That's where you get what mount do you get from them?

203
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You get the little lizard thing from them.

204
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm working on recognized with them right now so.

205
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Nice.

206
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I will point out though you only have to be level 15 to go to Gold Saucer.

207
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
So a lot of people in 14 checking that out.

208
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yeah.

209
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Alright so that's it for your gaming week.

210
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Then we will go on to Loki.

211
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Loki how was your gaming week?

212
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
My gaming week was pretty much just working on my game.

213
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Although I did play.

214
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And it's funny because actually I think I played this last week too but I completely forgot about it.

215
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
So I'm playing a little bit of Saints Row Gata out of Hell.

216
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And it's really at this point I'm done with the game.

217
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I have 100% as far as like the missions go and all the activities.

218
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm just doing all this stupid grindy shit.

219
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
So I was working on some of that.

220
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
And it just is so boring because it's just grindy stuff to get the last few trophies.

221
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
But I just don't want to do it anymore.

222
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So I play it for a while and I'm like okay this is boring.

223
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I shut it off.

224
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And it's really like it's sad because I'm only like 12 hours into the game.

225
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And I've almost completely beat everything 100%.

226
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I mean I have beat everything 100% and now I just have to do that.

227
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Like get 500 kills with this weapon.

228
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Get 500 kills with this weapon.

229
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Get 500 kills with this weapon.

230
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's like that dumb shit.

231
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
But I don't know.

232
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
So that's pretty much it.

233
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm just working on my game.

234
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Alright well good luck as you continue that work on your game.

235
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
For me I got sucked back into Final Fantasy XIV something fierce this week.

236
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I won't double talk a lot of the stuff that Dark Soccer already talked about.

237
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Since I have done the Gold Saucer I will mention they did a pretty good job with it.

238
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
If you didn't know Final Fantasy XIV patched in the Gold Saucer this week.

239
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's own version of it but greatly inspired by Final Fantasy VII's Gold Saucer.

240
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
They have these silly little mini games that are really nothing.

241
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
They're just little throwaways.

242
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But fun little like okay spend a point or like a ticket.

243
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It's another form of currency that's in the game.

244
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
To just do this little press the button when it's right in the center.

245
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
If you do it right you might get 2 points or 5 points depending on how well you do it.

246
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's kind of cute that they put all these little sub mini games.

247
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
But then the two big highlights of Manderville Gold Saucer are.

248
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Triple Triad is in the game now.

249
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Which is pretty cool.

250
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
They built it.

251
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It feels a lot like it does an 8.

252
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It looks a little smaller because it's like a window that comes up on the screen.

253
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You can play the full out Triple Triad.

254
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You get a starter deck.

255
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You can challenge NPCs to try to get their cards.

256
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Or as you run dungeons and old content especially.

257
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And do primal fights.

258
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You get cards there as well.

259
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
The good news is too.

260
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You don't lose cards like you did in Final Fantasy VIII.

261
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
So it makes it a lot easier to build up a deck.

262
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So that's really cool.

263
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And then Chocobo Racing is in the game.

264
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Which looks great.

265
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
The controls are a little funky.

266
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Left and right doesn't really turn left and right.

267
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's more like using a left lane or a right lane.

268
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
And then like all Accelerate does.

269
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Is you want to accelerate up to the point where your Chocobo is starting to get exhausted.

270
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
And then you want to stop.

271
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So you don't waste all your stamina.

272
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So I mean there's kind of.

273
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's a little bit clunky in the controls.

274
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
But it still looks really nice.

275
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And it's still kind of fun to check out.

276
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
So Chocobo Racing is a worthy addition as well.

277
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
They need to put Chocobo Racing as in the kart racing in the game.

278
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Right?

279
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
That's what I was really hoping for.

280
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Because man the Playstation 1 version was so good.

281
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
But I understand.

282
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
That's going to take a lot of work in a different way.

283
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
And maybe something like that is just too difficult to build in the engine.

284
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm happy with what they did give us.

285
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
That is disappointing that it would be too difficult to build into the engine.

286
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I guess they'll just have to make a standalone game then.

287
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm fine with that.

288
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm okay with that logic.

289
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That is totally fine with me.

290
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Honestly.

291
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
So.

292
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Love that.

293
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
So there you go.

294
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I've also been playing a lot of Diablo 3 this week.

295
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
As the seasons are continuing.

296
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Alan is already up to like Paragon 130 something.

297
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I don't know.

298
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Like it's a really high level.

299
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And I'm working on it too.

300
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm up to Paragon 80 something on my Monk.

301
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I've been just doing some rifts.

302
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Trying to get some better gear.

303
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Wishing that that Blood Shard lady would give me a set helm already.

304
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
But yeah.

305
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Just making my way on Diablo 3.

306
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Other than those two games.

307
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Honestly it hasn't been an awful lot.

308
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Yesterday I went on a day trip with Flaco Jones and Shane.

309
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
We went to go see Extover from Hoard House who lives in the Bay Area.

310
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
So we went on a day trip over there.

311
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And I will say we played board games while we were there.

312
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
We don't talk about board games enough on this program.

313
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Which you know.

314
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm sure there are board game podcasts out there.

315
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And there's probably plenty you could say about board games and card games.

316
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
But you know.

317
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I think there's a lot that ties into video games after all.

318
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Many great board and card games become a video game at some point.

319
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
And many great video games also become a board game at some point.

320
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
In fact, Dark Sakura at a store in Berkeley yesterday.

321
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I saw the Mass Effect Risk game.

322
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And I thought about it.

323
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I kind of want it.

324
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's like 50 bucks isn't it?

325
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It's 50 bucks.

326
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
They changed the board completely.

327
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It looks very different.

328
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
But I still kind of wanted it.

329
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But anyway.

330
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
We played board games.

331
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
We played The Resistance.

332
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Which is kind of the wolf game that you play at Dragon Con.

333
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Or I'm sure many conventions.

334
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
As a card game.

335
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's just a little different.

336
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But that's a lot of fun.

337
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Because you know.

338
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
If you play with a group of friends you get all into it.

339
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And you know.

340
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I of course was the spy in both games.

341
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And you know.

342
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Somebody figured it out.

343
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
But luckily the other people wouldn't listen to him.

344
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And I won both times.

345
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Beam.

346
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
We also played.

347
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
What is it called?

348
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
The DC deck building game.

349
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Something like that.

350
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It's like a card game.

351
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
But you're building your deck.

352
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And it was all DC heroes and things.

353
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Like you know.

354
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I would get like.

355
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I think Cyborg was the hero that I was playing.

356
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And I think Alan was playing as the Flash.

357
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
And so.

358
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Yeah.

359
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
That was a fun game.

360
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I like those games.

361
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Where you kind of start with a very small deck.

362
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
And then you build up more and more cards.

363
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
To try to get enough points to win.

364
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I know Dominion is a huge game like that too.

365
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I've played that before.

366
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And that was a lot of fun.

367
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
So.

368
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Yeah.

369
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
William Murderface in our chat room.

370
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Over at Live.VogueNetwork.com says.

371
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Need some betrayal at House on the Hill in my life.

372
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Good stuff.

373
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I played that one two weeks ago.

374
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
With Flaco and his wife and Shane.

375
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
And that game is a lot of fun.

376
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
That's one of my favorite board games right now.

377
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
So.

378
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yeah.

379
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
That's a great one too.

380
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
If you haven't played that.

381
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
So.

382
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
There you go.

383
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I played a lot of board games this week.

384
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It's like video games without the video.

385
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
So.

386
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
There you go.

387
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Let's get into some housekeeping real quick.

388
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And then we'll get into what news is going on this week.

389
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
For housekeeping I will say of course as always.

390
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Follow us on Twitter please.

391
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

392
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
We're also on Facebook.

393
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

394
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
As a reminder guys.

395
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
We will not be here next week.

396
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
There is no O-L-R here next week.

397
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It will not be live.

398
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Nor will it be podcast.

399
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
There will be nothing.

400
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
We will be back on March 15th.

401
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And the reason for that of course.

402
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Is that as I've mentioned on previous shows.

403
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I will be going to PAX East.

404
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
And my flight home is Sunday night.

405
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
So there's no way.

406
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I don't get back into San Francisco until 1130.

407
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Which is well after the show is already over.

408
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
So there will be no show live or on the podcast next week.

409
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
But I hope you guys all have a great week.

410
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I'm sure there will be lots of news and things to discuss.

411
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
That come out of PAX.

412
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Which we'll talk about in two weeks.

413
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
On episode 590 on March 15th.

414
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
So there you go.

415
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Alright.

416
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Let's get into some news.

417
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Gaming news.

418
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Again.

419
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
A little bit of a quieter week.

420
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
But a few things to talk about.

421
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Worthy of our time this week.

422
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Loki.

423
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
So they made an announcement regarding Fable Legends.

424
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
That it's going to be a free to play game.

425
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
On Xbox One and PC.

426
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
So that's kind of cool.

427
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Because I wouldn't have bought it anyways.

428
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
But I'm glad to hear that it will be free to play I guess.

429
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
So maybe I'll check it out.

430
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
If my PC can run it.

431
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Since Windows 10 is supposed to be free.

432
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Maybe?

433
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Is it supposed to be?

434
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Yeah.

435
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
It's supposed to be free.

436
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
So I'll have to check it out.

437
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I'm wondering though how they're going to do the microtransactions in the game.

438
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
So that would be kind of interesting.

439
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Now the other thing though.

440
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Is they're saying that it does require Xbox Live Gold.

441
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
If you're on Xbox One to play it.

442
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Unlike I think.

443
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Don't the free to play games on Playstation Network.

444
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Don't require that.

445
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
At least on Playstation 3 I think.

446
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I don't know.

447
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
But I guess we'll have to wait and find out some more information.

448
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I think this is coming out later this year.

449
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I'm surprised at the free to play news about this.

450
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Because it didn't seem like one when we saw it at E3 last year.

451
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So this is a bit of a surprise.

452
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I know that Molineau doesn't have much to do with this.

453
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
But I'm kind of glad it's free to play.

454
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Well I mean he has really nothing to do with it at this point.

455
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I understand it.

456
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
But a lot of the failed games have been kind of a let down.

457
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Especially after 2.

458
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Yeah 2 was great and then 3 was eh.

459
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
And then connect eh.

460
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Yeah right.

461
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It's none of reels.

462
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Well I would like to see perhaps just a Fable 4 at some point.

463
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
That would be great.

464
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
You know especially to maybe kind of go back to some of the things that worked with 2.

465
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
And you know with the Xbox One technology and so forth.

466
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Even though Molineau wouldn't be involved at this point likely.

467
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I mean I would hope that they can bring enough talent.

468
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I'm sure they can bring in talent to you know still make a worthy game of the Fable title.

469
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
But not to belittle this game.

470
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It's kind of weird that it's free to play at this point.

471
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
But it's also kind of like okay I'll for sure play it now.

472
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Yeah it was also kind of a stranger.

473
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I mean kind of with that you know the free to play model to it.

474
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Is that going to be more of like an MMO now?

475
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Or is it going to be more of just like you know it's a free to play kind of single co-op type game.

476
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
You know that's what I'm kind of interested to find out I guess.

477
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Bobby Blackwolf pointing out in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

478
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
That it's on a case by case basis if free to play games require the plus subscription or not.

479
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
On both systems.

480
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
So.

481
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Ragenator pointing out too bad Fable 2 isn't available on Steam.

482
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Those comments over at live.vognetwork.com.

483
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So.

484
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
2 was good. My wife hated 3.

485
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Well I mean but this one is not going to be related to those games at all really except in name right?

486
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I mean it's a totally different type of game.

487
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
So I mean it's kind of a crap shoot in a way.

488
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
That doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be bad.

489
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
It's just it's not necessarily going to be good either.

490
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
It's kind of a.

491
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:32,000
It looked more of like a I don't know just kind of a co-op you know like for almost like 4 on 1 because it was that whole thing again.

492
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Yeah.

493
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Why is everyone doing the 4 on 1 thing.

494
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I mean it's it's what we said that at E3 last year like it was just all the lines coming out.

495
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I understand though that like you know Evolve did it and stuff like that.

496
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,000
And I don't even know if people are still really interested in that game because it looked interesting and looked like any idea.

497
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
But I just think with everybody doing that all of a sudden it's just kind of like eh.

498
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Well I think what happened with Evolve was the DLC stuff really turned a lot of people off.

499
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
You know despite whatever they've said about it.

500
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Despite how good the standalone package may be.

501
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I think the fact that there was so much DLC at the start.

502
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And the fact that there is no single player mode in it at all.

503
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I think those kind of turned people off.

504
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
You know what would be good.

505
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:25,000
You know with the 4 on 1 thing is to have like some sort of like Dungeons and Dragons type game where one person that won is the DM and the other people are the people running the game.

506
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
And that would be pretty cool I think.

507
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Was it Neverwinter Nights?

508
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Was it Neverwinter Nights?

509
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Is it?

510
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Sort of.

511
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I just call that D&D.

512
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I understand that but I'm talking about like a video game.

513
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I understand that yes it's fun to imagine and do all the rolling and stuff like that.

514
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
But like let's just streamline it down and make it a little bit more accessible for people that don't want to.

515
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
That are going to be too encumbered by trying to learn all the rules and everything.

516
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
That's what they did with D&D 4th edition which is why it sucks.

517
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
So maybe they shouldn't.

518
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Well keep in mind 4 v 1 is not necessarily new to 2015 either.

519
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
I mean I think part of the reason a lot of people wanted to get on board with it is.

520
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Go back and remember how freaking awesome Pac-Man Versus was.

521
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And the Wii U brought a few versions of that to Nintendo Land as well.

522
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
What the Mario Chase and the Animal Crossing games are kind of like that.

523
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I bet you we'll see a new Nintendo Land this year.

524
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You really think?

525
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I think so.

526
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I wouldn't have thought Nintendo Land would be up for a sequel.

527
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I would think they would try to make the magic happen again with Wii Sports.

528
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
One way or another.

529
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Maybe.

530
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And I'm well aware that there is Wii Sports was released on the Wii U.

531
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
But some type of.

532
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
It's not really new.

533
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
It's just kind of ported Wii Sports.

534
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Wii Sports AGG whatever.

535
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
It's only the biggest video game of all time ported to the Wii U.

536
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Yeah it's because they were innovative for a short brief period of time.

537
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
And they had a pretty decent game to go along with that.

538
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
They just need to recapture that fire though.

539
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Many people in chat chiming in about Neverwinter Nights saying.

540
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Bobby Blackwell saying Neverwinter Nights 2 didn't really have that.

541
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
But Neverwinter Nights 1 had that.

542
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Let's see.

543
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Bobby also saying he's got a lot of chat comments tonight.

544
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Bobby saying I guess when he couldn't do his own show he's got a lot to say in chat.

545
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Bobby saying Pac-Man versus on GameCube.

546
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Best party game ever.

547
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Too bad it kind of took a lot to get that game up and running.

548
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:32,000
But man those GameCube Game Boy Advance games were a real fun party when you had everything to make it happen.

549
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Like Zelda Four Swords was so much fun.

550
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
As was even the Final Fantasy game.

551
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Even though it was a little more complex I think to just kind of plug and play at a party.

552
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I still think that was a lot of fun if you could get people who were into it to play.

553
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
So anyway.

554
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Yeah so there you go.

555
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Gonna be a free to play four versus one game.

556
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I'll certainly check it out now that it's gonna be free.

557
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I don't even have to ask that question.

558
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Do I spend the money? Don't I spend the money?

559
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Especially after last week's news where Shadow Realms got cancelled.

560
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Well Loki there you go. There's one of those four versus one games that's not happening now.

561
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
So I guess some are unfortunately falling because there's too many of them out there.

562
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
So I would have liked to see what they come up with.

563
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
But I also have a weak spot for BioWare. I'll openly admit that. I do.

564
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Anyhow. I also have a weak spot for this series as do a lot of you.

565
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Dragon Quest. Good news guys. A Dragon Quest game is coming westward.

566
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Sadly it's not Dragon Quest X for the Wii U or something.

567
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
But this will still be pretty cool nevertheless.

568
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Dragon Quest Heroes will be coming to PlayStation 4.

569
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Hmm interesting.

570
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
In North America and Europe later this year.

571
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Both via retail and digital download.

572
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And of course Square Enix will be selling it on their own online store.

573
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
The PlayStation 4 will obviously have the high definition graphics.

574
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
And all the characters that you know. Like the little blue slime.

575
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
So is this the one that's supposed to be like Dynasty Warriors or something?

576
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I have not really played this game myself.

577
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
But I believe that's kind of how it is.

578
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Maybe not.

579
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
It's not a main quest game. Obviously because it's not a numbered one.

580
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It's more of a side game.

581
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
But I think it's a little more action oriented because of that.

582
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Maybe that's not the same one I'm thinking.

583
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I thought they had one because they did Hyrule Warriors.

584
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
And then they were doing one that was like I think Dragon Quest characters.

585
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
And kind of like a Hyrule Warriors style game.

586
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Yeah I think it's more like Hyrule Warriors than it is an actual Dragon Quest game.

587
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Akuma JP who I know lives in Japan.

588
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
And so has definitely already played Dragon Quest Heroes.

589
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I'm sure says Dragon Quest Heroes sucks ass.

590
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
That's unfortunate.

591
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
That is unfortunate hearing that.

592
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Why would you port a crappy game?

593
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I mean granted that's just one person's opinion.

594
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Other people may feel differently.

595
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
But still.

596
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
You know you might be wondering why this and not Dragon Quest X.

597
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Dartetsuya saying though well if Dragon Quest Heroes is anything like Hyrule Warriors it might be a fun game.

598
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,000
You know Hyrule Warriors starting to show us a real vast amount of depth.

599
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
But we'll get into that later in the show.

600
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I know something else is coming up on Hyrule Warriors later in the show.

601
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,000
So there you go.

602
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I'll still.

603
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
It kind of depends how much they're going to charge for this.

604
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
That's one thing I don't think they said in the release.

605
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
I'm trying to see if it's in the.

606
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Maybe a demo?

607
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Yeah a demo would be great.

608
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Something to let me know if I'm really going to like it or not before I drop that kind of money on it.

609
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Yeah no day or date yet.

610
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,000
So we'll see if this maybe is more of a budget title although I kind of doubt it.

611
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
So.

612
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
You pay the Square Enix premium.

613
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Yeah right.

614
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Like we're going to be doing with Type 0.

615
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Which is you know buying a PSP game that's been tinkered with and now will be on the Playstation 4.

616
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
But I do really want to play that game.

617
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Not even just for the.

618
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Not even for the Final Fantasy 15 demo but I mean obviously that's a big part of it.

619
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
But with Type 0 I'm just excited.

620
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
What is that even about?

621
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I mean the music is so good.

622
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
But is Type 0 like tied in with 13 or is it like.

623
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Well I think that whole universe kind of got split up.

624
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
But yeah I think it at one time did.

625
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
So but I'm still going to check it out.

626
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
We'll see.

627
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
All right let's move on.

628
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Dark Saga.

629
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Well a few big names out there have put out that there is going to be a Final Fantasy Mystic Quest HD remake.

630
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
But Squeenix is like uh uh.

631
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
That's crap.

632
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Basically the official statements as we are aware of the Final Fantasy Mystic Quest HD remake project.

633
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,000
And can confirm that it is not a Square Enix project nor endorsed by Square Enix in any way.

634
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Basically it was that a group called Dark Design Games has been going around the base saying oh yeah we're going to be making this game.

635
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And you know spreading the word.

636
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:06,000
And they're actually the head of the company Jake Jackson was saying that oh we just crossed our wires.

637
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Square Enix Europe has endorsed it.

638
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:18,000
You know so I think that he's trying to pull off some kind of scam or trying to I don't know get a little bit of attention.

639
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
But Square Enix officially said it's not true.

640
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:32,000
And basically if the game is released it is definitely unlicensed and a violation of their copyright.

641
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Why would you want to remake Mystic Quest anyway?

642
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Besides the music the music was great.

643
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Hell if I know.

644
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
That aside the game itself was a little weak.

645
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
It was like Final Fantasy for five year olds.

646
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Well and that was the point well it was Final Fantasy for Americans.

647
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,000
That was the point really behind it was it was let's let's do an entry level RPG for the big stupid Americans.

648
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
And it wasn't even really a Final Fantasy game to begin with.

649
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
No it really wasn't.

650
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
It didn't even really.

651
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Hold on I'm going to figure out which one it was.

652
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Maybe some of the spell names and things came from Final Fantasy but that's that's really it.

653
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I mean it was so I actually own this.

654
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:18,000
My mom knew I loved Final Fantasy so she and she knew that it also wasn't a game that was filled with gore and blood and stuff like that.

655
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
So when she saw Final Fantasy Mystic Quest came out she got it for me for like my birthday or something.

656
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Yeah actually it was a Final Fantasy game.

657
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
What?

658
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,000
It was a Final Fantasy.

659
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Oh no no the Final Fantasy Mystic Quest came out in Japan as Final Fantasy USA Mystic Quest.

660
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Yeah.

661
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Final Fantasy stupid US edition.

662
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Final Fantasy dumb Americans.

663
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Yeah this actually was completely not yeah.

664
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I believe it was a game developed in Japan for the US which is what made it kind of unique in a way.

665
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
But again soundtrack was stellar.

666
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
If you're going to play the game for no other reason the soundtrack is great.

667
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,000
It was not Nobui Matsu it was somebody else but it was it's great.

668
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Some of the songs are in theater them which is one of the ways to kind of remember it now.

669
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:10,000
So act deft and chat over at live.vognetoverwork.com saying hey hey hey Final Fantasy Mystic Quest is cool don't diss it.

670
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I just I guess it had its moments but it was it was so linear like you think Final Fantasy 13 was bad.

671
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was actually linear you were on the world map was lines that you followed to and you would go to a battlefield.

672
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Where you'd have to just do 10 battles back to back and then you'd clear that battlefield.

673
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And of course all the hit points were represented visually because here in America we don't know numbers.

674
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
We only know meters.

675
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:48,000
So there were some silly aspects to the game but again the music fantastic.

676
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
So Dungeon Buster saying it's Final Fantasy Casual Quest.

677
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Act deaf saying I'm a dumb Mexican and I love it.

678
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Let's see yeah those are some comments from our chat room.

679
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Rama saying Secret of Evermore was so much better than Mystic Quest.

680
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I actually.

681
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I have that game.

682
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I support that.

683
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I think Secret of Evermore got so much shit and there's I think it was a way better game than people give it credit for.

684
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I understand why because of the fact that we got that and not Second Densetsu 3.

685
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:29,000
So I understand why the frustration is there but like that game didn't deserve to be like a one and done for Square USA you know.

686
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Jeremy Soleil that was like the very first game soundtrack he ever did.

687
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
And now he's gone on to do Elder Scrolls like his big thing right Guild Wars all that big stuff.

688
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:48,000
So you know anyway all those other Square Enix games besides the ones in the main series.

689
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Lots of news on those tonight.

690
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Let's move on with some more news.

691
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,000
So Microsoft is putting on sale the one year subscription for Xbox Live.

692
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,000
They're dropping it to $40 a year instead of 60.

693
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Although you know everyone's thinking oh they're trying to undercut Sony but it's actually supposed to be temporary discount.

694
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:18,000
But I wonder though if it's going to be a temporary discount like the system discounts were and then they weren't so temporary.

695
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
So I'm wondering you know they'll do something similar with that.

696
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
It'd be nice I just don't think they're going to do that.

697
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:29,000
And let's be honest a lot of people weren't paying $60 for gold anyways for a year you could buy for 40 a lot of places.

698
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Like during Black Friday sales.

699
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Not even just like all the time it's discounted like on Amazon and wherever.

700
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
What do you think might be the strategical reasons for Microsoft to do that.

701
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Is it some type of competition with PlayStation because isn't PlayStation what $50 for a year.

702
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Yeah.

703
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
So now not only are they no longer more expensive but they kind of undercut them in a way right.

704
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Yes maybe just trying to see if that brings a boost in you know sales or something.

705
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Maybe just subscriptions increases the amount of subscriptions.

706
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I worry though and not to be too tinfoil hat or you know angsty gamer type of thing but I just want to throw this out there.

707
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:14,000
And I've talked in the past before about how like double dipping on the Xbox is going to piss me off.

708
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Like if I have to pay one fee through Xbox Live to pay the game online.

709
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And then I'm gonna have to pay a second fee through the game maker to have to play something online.

710
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Like that's like double dipping right.

711
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Yeah.

712
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And I don't believe correct me if I'm wrong people but I don't believe PlayStation does this with their MMOs like Final Fantasy 14.

713
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
I do not believe you have to have PlayStation Plus to do Final Fantasy 14.

714
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Well according to what Bobby was saying earlier it's on a case by case basis.

715
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,000
On a case by case basis right.

716
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:46,000
So and I'm trying to remember what game it was or I was like they better not have a fee to do online because then that's double dipping.

717
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Because you're gonna have to pay once for Xbox Live and then you're gonna have to pay another fee through whoever the game maker is.

718
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I can't remember at the time what.

719
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Is it Elder Scrolls Online?

720
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Maybe I don't know but I wonder if the reduction in price for Xbox Live is to make double dipping less offensive.

721
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
If that makes sense.

722
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Then maybe some of that's coming that they'll make that $20 or the publishers will make that $20 in other ways.

723
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Again I am admittedly being negative about this but I feel like I have to ask that question.

724
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Like what's the real reason behind this?

725
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Well the other thing I'm thinking is maybe it's because they're thinking I honestly don't think it's very long term anyways.

726
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:34,000
I think it's just the boost sales right now because it's kind of a I don't know it's a very sparse time of the year.

727
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,000
So I'm thinking maybe it's just to help boost sales a little bit just you know an experiment they can try it and see what happens.

728
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:52,000
I don't know if it's gonna be necessarily something that they drop the price because they're thinking hey we're gonna get people on Windows 10 to pay the subscription fee for games as well.

729
00:41:52,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Which let me start off there by saying I think that's really stupid to do on PC to pay a subscription to play games online on PC.

730
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Oh god hackers will find a way around that in seconds. I hope Microsoft isn't banking on making money with that. Hackers will work around that in seconds.

731
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I just you know because that's you know what they're saying I think with Fable the new Fable game is that you have to have gold to play that.

732
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Oh then it's not really free to play is it?

733
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,000
But then I think that's just on consoles though right now. But I'm just saying right now you know I understand it's on consoles currently.

734
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:38,000
But it could very well move over to all platforms like you play you know for PlayStation Plus or whatever you get it on you know all your PlayStation consoles.

735
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,000
But maybe now that they're having Windows 10 as being this whole platform thing that you pay for it on Windows 10.

736
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:51,000
I don't know I think it'd be hard to sell that but I could see them maybe offering other services through that perhaps.

737
00:42:51,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Okay that's a more positive way of looking at it is that maybe there's some type of uniform Microsoft subscription or Microsoft gold or something that's going to have synergy with Windows 10.

738
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:10,000
And so buying this would get you not only the gaming but tinfoil hat, Microsoft Word, like Microsoft Office suite of products you could use.

739
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I hate that they have a subscription for that too but you know whatever.

740
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Well it worked for Adobe so it's where a lot of those companies their software gets pirated all the time.

741
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
That's kind of where they're going now you know.

742
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:29,000
So that's their way around it is that you know you check in with an authentication server all the time or it doesn't work.

743
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Always online apps essentially.

744
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Okay so I have to jump in.

745
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Okay what is going on in the chat room Dark Soccer?

746
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,000
While we've been talking about Microsoft and Xbox you guys in the chat room are going crazy. What is happening?

747
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Basically it starts with Act Deft going because it's talking about well it went to talk about like Final Fantasy Mexico edition.

748
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
And so he says Fantasica Final Busqueda Mystica.

749
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
So we've now started talking about what enemies and classes would be in the game.

750
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,000
So instead of cactuars you have cactuses and I said instead of bards you have El Mariachi.

751
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
You know and I was actually sort of thinking of you know Antonio Banderas walking around.

752
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Wait so since we joked about a Final Fantasy that was made for stereotypical Americans.

753
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:18,000
You guys are designing a Final Fantasy for stereotypical Mexicans.

754
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
Mexicans yes. So we have luchadors instead of dragoons.

755
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
They're going to wrestle them into you know pieces.

756
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Then we have what else was in there I said to have the Toreador.

757
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
So that you have bullfights instead of boss fights.

758
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Chihuahua instead of carbuncles.

759
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Which is Spanish but still.

760
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Can the plot of the game be like straight out of a Tene novella?

761
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
It should be. There needs to be fake crying.

762
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
There needs to be lots of crying.

763
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
And slap fighting.

764
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Yeah lots of slap fighting.

765
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:56,000
But that would have to take elements from Final Fantasy 7 when you have the slap fight on top of the Shinra building.

766
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Just bring that over.

767
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Well they were like we need to rom hack something and I'm like just do it in RPG Maker.

768
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
So I said this should be an official dream game.

769
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
The gold saucer equivalent in Mexico by the way.

770
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,000
It should be.

771
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Sabado Higante.

772
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
There it is.

773
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
And like you don't you don't rest in a tent.

774
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,000
You just have your little villages should be like in a circle and you know.

775
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I love it. I love it.

776
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Then your old ruins are like you know Aztec and Mayan ruins and whatnot.

777
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
It's like just stereotypical enough to not quite be offensive.

778
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Exactly.

779
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Which is very like tongue in cheek.

780
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
But we should have we should have real.

781
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Kind of like um.

782
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Um.

783
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Oh my God why is the name escaping me.

784
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Fucking fantastic Metroid media game.

785
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Agi-Dub says salsa saucer.

786
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Why is this.

787
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Guacamelee.

788
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
God.

789
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
There was mentions of that too.

790
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Yeah.

791
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,000
So now this is actually according to Dark Tetsuya Final Fantasy Mexican Quest is now on the wiki.

792
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
No you have to use the right name.

793
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,000
The name that that uh the active gave it because active is our official.

794
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Uh he is our official muse in this liaison.

795
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Early.

796
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,000
No I'm inspired.

797
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,000
He's our muse.

798
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,000
OK.

799
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
So Fantasia Final Busqueta Mystica.

800
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Make it so.

801
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I love that.

802
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Love it.

803
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
And no we don't want to use the maracas.

804
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
That would just be too much.

805
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Yeah.

806
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
No now you're getting too stereotypical.

807
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Come on people.

808
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Come on.

809
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
All right.

810
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
The things that go on in our chat room.

811
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Now I do like fifth dream your party can only have three members because amigos.

812
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
That was a good movie.

813
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
OK.

814
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Oh my gosh.

815
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,000
All right.

816
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Well since Dark Sakura and the chat room had to go there with maracas like from you know

817
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,000
somebody amigo that has us thinking a little bit about rhythm games right.

818
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
And we had some potentially big rhythm game news last week on the show maybe two weeks

819
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
ago when rumors are really gaining steam that rock band is going to come back this year.

820
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Which is supposed to be rumored to be announced this week.

821
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Could be yeah it could be something I'm hoping to get my hands on next week if the line isn't

822
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
horrendous.

823
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
We'll see.

824
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Well the good thing about PAX I will say this the good thing about it is that you know unlike

825
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,000
E3 I mean E3 you can't do shit anymore without an appointment.

826
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:24,000
E3 is honestly if you are just kind of going you're going to get to maybe see Nintendo

827
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Sony Microsoft has stuff out there.

828
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Everybody else you might as well have an appointment or you're really not going to get to see anything.

829
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
And because it's only those three booths that really have stuff out on the floor the lines

830
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
are really really long like you all know like the epically long Nintendo lines right.

831
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Well because the point of PAX is it's out there for everybody to see and do and the media

832
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
doesn't really get special treatment at PAX.

833
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Hopefully those lines will move a little more briskly than they would perhaps it like an

834
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
E3 type show.

835
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:59,000
So I will hope that if Rock Band is unveiled at PAX I might be able to get my hands on it

836
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
as will I'm sure some of our listeners that will be there at the show as well.

837
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Now here's the thing though this is where the plot thickens.

838
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Harmonix not the only ones thinking about bringing their plastic instrument franchise

839
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
back from the dead.

840
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Yep Activision rumored to be working on a Guitar Hero game for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

841
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Now they're talking a more realistic visual style with this.

842
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,000
So it won't be so cartoony like the old games were.

843
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Maybe because that cartoony stuff got them into trouble.

844
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Like remember Gwen Stefani not happy that she could be singing songs by Nirvana and stuff in the game right.

845
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Remember some of those lawsuit issues.

846
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
So they might take a more realistic approach with the game.

847
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Maybe that's because Rock sorry Rocksmith does still is doing pretty well and that's more realistic game.

848
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I don't know I don't know just throwing ideas out there.

849
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
But the rumor is an E3 reveal for the game.

850
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
New guitar peripherals will be introduced for this.

851
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:04,000
But not hearing anything about drums or keyboards so maybe the focus will be on guitar like the old games.

852
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Boo I don't want to have to buy new fucking instruments.

853
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I have enough instruments I have a garage full of instruments.

854
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Activision of course saying that they don't comment on rumor or speculation.

855
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
But have previously said that it's one of the most beloved entertainment franchises.

856
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:28,000
We would only bring Guitar Hero back if we developed the right innovations to usher the franchise into the new generation of gaming.

857
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
And I'm going to say the same thing that I said when we talked about Rock Band.

858
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
And that is we live in a very social world now and I sort of see.

859
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I mean the Rock Band and Guitar Hero games that we had before were great.

860
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I mean mostly Rock Band but even Guitar Hero as well were great party games.

861
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Living room party games invite your friends over and have a blast.

862
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:58,000
We live in an even more connected world now just even five years later than we did five years ago.

863
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I mean Twitch TV streaming not really as big of a thing five years ago.

864
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I think it was still Justin TV five years ago and it was kind of a fringe thing right?

865
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Than it is now.

866
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:16,000
So I think maybe those innovations are going to be very rooted in social things.

867
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Like not only can I play online with my friends but we can kind of all see each other.

868
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,000
And I think what did I say about Rock Band? We'd make a music video together using all the cameras.

869
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,000
You'd make an awesome music video that would get copyright striked as soon as you upload it online.

870
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Innovation is the future.

871
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Absolutely.

872
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
So they've rebuilt the cow.

873
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
They have the technology and now they're going to milk it dry again.

874
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Well the Guitar Hero. Here's the thing about Guitar Hero.

875
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I don't think it's as bad as people remember it in their memory.

876
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Really?

877
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Because you know four releases in a year is just not too much.

878
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
That's the thing.

879
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
It's not like the core games themselves that were the issue.

880
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
It was the fact that they bled that series dry.

881
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,000
That hurt not only that but Rock Band as well.

882
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:12,000
Which with all due respect to harmonics, even that was happening a little bit.

883
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,000
What with the Rock Band Green Day and the Rock Band Beatles.

884
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Although if any band deserves their own stand alone game it's the Beatles.

885
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I think the Beatles one was treated quite well and they had their own separate thing with that.

886
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Well that was George Harrison's son behind the whole thing.

887
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
That's fair. Sorry.

888
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
I did not mean to come for Rock Band Beatles.

889
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,000
I completely agree with you on Green Day. I just don't see that.

890
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:38,000
And then Guitar Hero was Aerosmith, Van Halen. Didn't they have an ACDC one at one point too?

891
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Yeah.

892
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
All these bands were getting their own games.

893
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
The thing with ACDC, I think the Rock Band one, that was a Walmart game.

894
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
It was Walmart exclusive for a while.

895
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
And then there was the Family Guitar Hero or Band Hero, right?

896
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Which was the one that had Taylor Swift and stuff in it, right?

897
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
And Lego Rock Band was pretty cool.

898
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Oh yeah, but I don't know.

899
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,000
But see, really those games I only wanted for the songs they were in because they had some pretty sweet songs with that.

900
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Yeah.

901
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
I don't know. I just...

902
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,000
But then keep in mind, at the same time, Guitar Hero is getting Milk Dry.

903
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
DJ Hero, pretty fucking awesome.

904
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
It was! They only released two games. Why?

905
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
That's the one I want Activision to bring back.

906
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I want that to come back.

907
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Let Harmonix do the guitar game. Let Activision do the DJ game.

908
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
That was amazing. It was such a great game.

909
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
It was such a cool idea.

910
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Like, we're gonna mix these two.

911
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
It's like a whole original soundtrack with it.

912
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I thought that was cool.

913
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
But no, let's just, you know, we'll bring back Guitar Hero.

914
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Fine, you know what? I'm fine with it.

915
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
You know, we'll see what they do with it.

916
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I just hope it's just not like a clone of Rocksmith.

917
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
I mean...

918
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
And once again, I don't want to buy new guitars.

919
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I have a whole set for my Xbox 360,

920
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
and I just wish I could use that with other games.

921
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Bobby Blackwolf making a good point in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com,

922
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
saying, here's the thing about the plastic instruments.

923
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
A lot of people's plastic instruments no longer work,

924
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
and they no longer make the plastic instruments,

925
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
so people can't play those games anymore.

926
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
So new instruments is a given.

927
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
That's going to happen, Loki.

928
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Like it or not, there will be new instruments.

929
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:19,000
The question is, will there be an adapter that ends up happening

930
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:25,000
that will allow those old devices to be playable in place of the new ones?

931
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Well, let me put it this way.

932
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:33,000
I have a device to do that already for playing my Xbox 360 controller

933
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
and my PlayStation 3 and stuff like that.

934
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Yeah, but the console manufacturers have to allow this stuff too, right?

935
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Because they can lock it out, can't they?

936
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
It's hacks, whatever.

937
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Yeah, but see, the harmonics in Activision can't really be all like,

938
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
use your old instrument with a hack.

939
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I don't think they can really endorse that, so we'll see.

940
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
We'll see.

941
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Anyway, Legend of Zaku in chat wondering,

942
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
how about Kinect or camera-based instruments?

943
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,000
No.

944
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
For example, air guitar.

945
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
No.

946
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Yeah, I don't want to see it go that route because it's not going to be accurate.

947
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Ridiculous.

948
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I wouldn't go so far as to call it ridiculous.

949
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I think it's one of those things where it works better in your mind

950
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,000
than it will in reality.

951
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
That's the problem with it.

952
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I reject his version of reality and replace it with my own.

953
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,000
If you want to be rejected as well, join us in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

954
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
DarkSakura is standing by.

955
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Rejection!

956
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I seriously hope we get a new DJ Hero game because that would be amazing.

957
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
I really think that that was an underutilized series.

958
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Just harmonics, do guitar,

959
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
You know what?

960
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:54,000
I'm telling you, I'm fine with Activision going the guitar route,

961
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
but you know what?

962
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I want harmonics to put out a DJ game then.

963
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
That could be good.

964
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
They are doing amplitude, which I know is not DJ.

965
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,000
That's not the same.

966
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I know. Anyway.

967
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Obviously, our show's roots is in music games,

968
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
so we have some very passionate opinions about this.

969
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I meant to go play DJ Hero this week.

970
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I'll do that this week.

971
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Here's my thing at PAX East, guys.

972
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I'm going to be there. Bobby's going to be there.

973
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
We all know Bobby's a drummer, so Bobby's clearly going to be the drummer in the band.

974
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
What am I going to do? Am I going to sing? I hope I'm not going to sing.

975
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I want to play bass or something.

976
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I'm going to be the bassist.

977
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Who else is going to stand in line with Bobby and I to play the new rock band?

978
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
That's what I want to know.

979
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Maybe SSJ100 Matt. He likes to play guitar. He could be lead guitar, right? We'll see.

980
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Anyway.

981
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Who's the best singer in the O.L. Army that's going to PAX East? That's what I want to know.

982
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
We'll see.

983
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Bobby Blackwell's saying amplitude is what they'll be showing on the PAX floor.

984
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
For sure, amplitude will be there.

985
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
So maybe they'll announce rock band, but it may not be playable.

986
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
We are making a huge assumption that rock band would be playable if they announced it.

987
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
And maybe they're going to keep that in their hat till E3.

988
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:10,000
I could still see them having rock band there, but it will be maybe the new DLC.

989
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Oh, okay. Yeah. I can see that.

990
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Or maybe a demo where every 15, 30 minutes the harmonics PR guys will come out on stage and play a song and that's that.

991
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
You don't play a song. They play a song and you watch. That type of thing.

992
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,000
That's what they did at that one E3 with rock band Beatles. They played it. We watched.

993
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:37,000
But of course there was a big focus on that game and the visuals and how everything was in the Beatles style.

994
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Alright. Act F saying I can play keyboard.

995
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:51,000
My last thought on rock band. Please don't ditch the keyboards just because rock band 3 was not as huge of a deal as rock band 2 and so forth.

996
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:57,000
I loved keyboards. Please, please, please don't get rid of keyboards. Please harmonics. Please.

997
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
I'm going to ugly cry if you get rid of keyboards.

998
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I'm going to tell you, I'm going to be there. I have a keyboard too. Haven't really used it. I'm going to be there at PAX East.

999
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
If you get rid of keyboards, I'm going to ugly cry at your booth. Ugly, ugly cry.

1000
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Do you want to know something funny? What? We actually still have all of our peripherals and they still work.

1001
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,000
All of them. They were, they were well built. Do you know what else I have that still works?

1002
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Huh? My guitar freaks controller. Right? And my drum mania controller.

1003
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I don't think I have a single dance pad that still works, but yeah, I have those plastic instruments, man. They take a lickin'.

1004
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Who did I sell my keyboard mania to or did I? Did I sell it to you?

1005
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:35,000
No. No. I bought my own years ago. I was going to sell my keyboard mania to somebody. I don't remember.

1006
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Alright. I think I offered it to you first. I think you did.

1007
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Alright. Well anyway, Sega has words for Nintendo, which honestly, you know, Sega's fucking up a lot of stuff so I don't know how much Nintendo should listen.

1008
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:58,000
But this comes from this former Sega CEO, Tom Kalinske. Basically, he's saying Nintendo should keep doing what they're doing because they're really good at it.

1009
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:05,000
The quote says, I don't think Nintendo should give up hardware or consoles. I'm surprised they haven't formed a division to extend the IP.

1010
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I'd love to play some of their games on my iPhone or iPad. It's really a form of marketing for them in a sense.

1011
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:17,000
They wouldn't even need to make that much money off of it. It would keep their brands relevant to the user, including people that are older like me.

1012
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:25,000
So it seems to me it's a marketing mistake, but I don't think they should give up what they're doing because they're damn good at it.

1013
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Hmm.

1014
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:39,000
It seems to me that Sega's mistake is going the portable route as far as doing things on phones and whatnot.

1015
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Because I think they might have even oversaturated the public consciousness with their IP.

1016
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I don't think it's a mistake, honestly, just because look at the sales that they had in their last console game.

1017
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I mean, I think if they're making money in mobile and they're not making money in consoles, then they've got to move to mobile.

1018
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:09,000
So they need to actually go back and instead of putting all of the effort into shitty games and mediocre mobile games, they could actually recapture what they had and put out good games.

1019
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Exactly.

1020
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
And not oversaturate it with a new reinvention every five months.

1021
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Look at what you did right in the past. You don't need to change it. You just need to make more of it. That's it.

1022
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I mean, no one ever, ever said, damn, I wish Sonic had some more friends. No one said that.

1023
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Or, hey, you know, I like this fast running part, but I really wish it would just slow down so I could have a nice little brawl with some robots.

1024
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:42,000
No one fucking said that ever in the history of time about Sonic the Hedgehog.

1025
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:51,000
You know what? I like Knuckles. Sonic Adventure did everything right, I think. That was the last really good Sonic game, was the first Sonic adventure.

1026
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:56,000
It gave us different gameplay, but we could always go back and do the Sonic levels. It had the speed.

1027
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:04,000
And it was actually something that you were playing instead of just a series of cut scenes or target dashes, you know.

1028
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:12,000
And I think that perhaps maybe it should be that Sega should be following Nintendo's example and doing what they know works.

1029
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Recapturing what they know works using the teams that they knew put out a good product.

1030
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Make a fighting game with all your franchise characters.

1031
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
What?

1032
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,000
That's right, make a fighting game with all your franchise characters.

1033
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
They've done that several times.

1034
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Sega?

1035
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Yes.

1036
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Well, I understand that, but it's been a while.

1037
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
We need Fighters Megamix 2.

1038
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Yes, like Smash Bros.

1039
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
We want to play as the Daytona car.

1040
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Hell yes, or just get the Daytona car as DLC for Smash Bros.

1041
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
You could also play as the palm tree from the AM2 logo.

1042
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
So random.

1043
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I know, that was such a great game.

1044
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
But yeah, just go back and do what works, you know.

1045
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Stop, you know, trying to chase something that's this ephemeral distant item that you can't obtain and go back to your roots.

1046
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:11,000
You know, if you look at actually other companies in general, how many companies do you know that branched off, branched off, branched off until they forgot what they were doing, wiped everything out, went back to what they were good at, and are now profitable companies?

1047
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:19,000
I mean, I can't name certain names, but I can definitely allude to it here in the studio here.

1048
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:28,000
But there are a bunch of companies who have just branched off, forgot what they did well, and had to go back to their roots. Rebuild start from zero.

1049
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Right.

1050
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
So Sega, learn your lesson.

1051
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Nintendo's doing fine. You should learn from them.

1052
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Just please don't disappear altogether, Sega. That'd be a bit much for me to take. That's all I'm saying.

1053
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Anyhow, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and check out some games coming to a console or a PC near you a little sooner than perhaps whatever Sega's doing next.

1054
01:01:50,000 --> 01:02:02,000
It's really sad that it's been such a slow year. I mean, I just don't even know. But this week, we really only have one game coming out on Xbox One and Xbox 360, Scream Ride.

1055
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
What even is that?

1056
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Scream Ride is a rollercoaster game where you build a track as you're kind of going, and I don't know if you're killing people in your ride. It's just some weird puzzle racing game. I know that's strange.

1057
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Interesting. All right, well, there you go.

1058
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Hey, but that's all you got this week.

1059
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Take it or leave it. Maybe something digitally is sweet in the pot. Who knows?

1060
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
There is other digital games, but I'm talking about physical releases. That's it.

1061
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:41,000
All right. Anyhow, going over to Japan and checking out the releases there. PlayStation 4 looks pretty thin, too. You do get Evolve this week. The Japanese release of Evolve is this week on March the 5th.

1062
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:49,000
On the PlayStation 3, Downtown Nekketsu Koshi Kyouku. What is that? I don't even know what that is.

1063
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Downtown Nekketsu. It's River City Ransom.

1064
01:02:52,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Oh, my God, it is. Oh, I didn't recognize it in the name when I see it. But now that I see the artwork, I'm like, holy shit, this looks awesome. What is this? I want it now.

1065
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Yeah, fuck.

1066
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
This looks like, okay.

1067
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:12,000
You see, Downtown Nekketsu, that's the hot blooded story thing.

1068
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Oh, my God, it even looks like it has stories. This looks like it's some type of fucking sequel to like River City Ransom or something. What is this? I need it now.

1069
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:27,000
There's online battle, whatever this is, online battle, single play, free battle, online battle.

1070
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
If Ikuma-san gets this for me, I'll send him something from here.

1071
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Well, oh, yeah, because PlayStation 3 is region free, isn't it?

1072
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Yep.

1073
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Hmm. This might be something we have to check out.

1074
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I'm actually just sort of kidding, but I'm going to import the fuck out of this.

1075
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Let's see. Okay, here it is. So they recently announced in Famitsu a remake of this.

1076
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:52,000
It was also known as Crash and the Boys Street Challenge, released in 1990 for the NES.

1077
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:57,000
It takes these characters and pits them against each other in a sporting event where everything goes, especially cheating.

1078
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:04,000
New in this version, highly detailed 3D backgrounds, online multiplayer support, and a single player story mode.

1079
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Huh.

1080
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
So there you go.

1081
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Crash and the Boys.

1082
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,000
I laughed my ass off of that reference in Scott Pilgrim.

1083
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Yeah, right?

1084
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Mm-hmm.

1085
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
So that's pretty awesome. I would see-

1086
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,000
I'm going to buy this right now.

1087
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Why do I end up doing Japanese releases when you know some of these series right by their Japanese titles?

1088
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
I fully admit I don't know that. So, I don't know.

1089
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Anyway, getting a price-

1090
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Damn it. I can't order it yet.

1091
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Getting a price reduction this week. Ayu Densetsu Sen no Kisuke going into the best series there.

1092
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Let's see. Moving on. On the Wii U this week, nothing, because Mario Party 10 is not out until next week.

1093
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:53,000
On the PlayStation Vita this week, Ayu Densetsu Sen no Kisuke gets its price reduction on the Vita as well.

1094
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,000
And lastly on the 3DS, Lego City Undercover gets a Japanese release this week.

1095
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:04,000
And Doraemon no Bita no Uchu Iyuki comes out this week on the-

1096
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Doraemon?

1097
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Yeah.

1098
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I love Doraemon games. They're so cute.

1099
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Yeah. Now that one I know. But there's a lot of games in that series.

1100
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
All right. How about the UK, Dar Sakura?

1101
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:20,000
In the UK, we have just a few things, really.

1102
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:27,000
We've got Ali Ali 2 for PS4 Vita and White Knight for PS4 on the 4th.

1103
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:34,000
And then on the 6th, we have Scream Ride for the Microsoft systems.

1104
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:39,000
And Zombie Army Trilogy on PS4, X-Bone, and PC.

1105
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
That's it.

1106
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:49,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Country Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase SHOP.

1107
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:54,000
All right. Just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week. Loki.

1108
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Well, I know it's time to get excited, especially when I'm saying that Valve had an announcement.

1109
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Well, actually, I should say HTC had an announcement because they have a brand new virtual reality headset.

1110
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:11,000
This is the kind of culmination of HTC and Steam.

1111
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Now it's the HTC Vive, which is supposed to be coming out later this year and is going to be another headset for VR.

1112
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:24,000
They're saying that it's going to have some pretty awesome displays.

1113
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
We can do video up to 90 frames per second.

1114
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:37,000
They're saying that it's got dual 1200 by 1080 displays as opposed to what's currently in the Oculus Rift DK2, which is a single 1080p panel.

1115
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:44,000
And they have this really strange video teaser of it, but I don't know.

1116
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I'm worried though that there's going to be a lot of fragmentation from this.

1117
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
And also, is this going to be like the new Valve console now?

1118
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Because remember we're going to have those Steam boxes and stuff and that kind of went by the wayside.

1119
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Is this going to be kind of like the new Steam box thing?

1120
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,000
I don't know. But they are saying it's going to be out this year.

1121
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,000
So at the very least we know there will be some VR this year.

1122
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Some sort of consumer VR piece.

1123
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
And how much does it cost is what I want to know too.

1124
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Any worry about the pool getting a little crowded with all these different people now getting in?

1125
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Well, yeah, no. Because there's a lot of different PC manufacturers out there.

1126
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
And there doesn't seem to be any fragmentation there.

1127
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:33,000
And like the mobile market though, especially on the Android side, there's a lot of fragmentation.

1128
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
I'm worried though there needs to be some sort of standard.

1129
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Or hopefully it's easy to port, like say, if I make a game for Oculus, it's easy to port it to this.

1130
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:48,000
And port it to Morpheus and HoloLens, however I'm going to do it on there. You know, that type of thing.

1131
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Well, if they're all rooted in PC, you don't exactly have to port things to your PC.

1132
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
I understand that. But like, you know, just different standards I guess for things.

1133
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Like specs maybe, like resolutions.

1134
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Like how the sensors work in it for tracking movement and that kind of thing.

1135
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Again though, with a PC it's very easy to do different resolutions, right?

1136
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:11,000
So hopefully, I mean, I get what you're saying, but it doesn't seem like it would be too challenging.

1137
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
I would hope. I don't know.

1138
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Be interesting to see. I think they're supposed to be showing this off at GDC this week.

1139
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Well, if Bobby had done a show tonight, I'm sure he would have been talking about this.

1140
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:26,000
But he is in chat saying the Valve HMD will be a higher end product that will cost a lot more.

1141
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Kind of like Alienware PCs.

1142
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Tigerclaw asking, what's the refresh rate on this new headset?

1143
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:36,000
If it's two screens at 1080p, it has to be able to do 60 hertz on each eye and BlackWolf saying it is 90.

1144
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
So there you go.

1145
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:45,000
That sounds pretty cool. I just, you know, I hope it's not incredibly expensive.

1146
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,000
I think we're getting really, really close to those VR headsets showing up in people's homes pretty regularly.

1147
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I think that's probably going to be a thing this holiday. You're going to start to see that.

1148
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I don't know if necessarily like the PlayStation 4's Morpheus will be this holiday.

1149
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:04,000
But if not this holiday next, for sure, like we're going to really start to see this take off, I think, next year.

1150
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I'm excited. This is different. This is kind of the whole, you know, different way to experience things.

1151
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Like when the Wii first came out, this is the type of innovation.

1152
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Sadly, Nintendo doesn't seem to have anything like this yet.

1153
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:27,000
And I'm worried that they're going to kind of miss the boat on it again.

1154
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:32,000
I'm okay with them doing their own path. Maybe they'll think of something else.

1155
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,000
I mean, you just said they did the Wii. You know, they thought of that. So maybe they'll think of something else.

1156
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:45,000
That's like years ago now. I mean, well, let's be innovative. I mean, they tried, but it's just not working.

1157
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,000
They're like, they're kind of trailing on what's being popular with things.

1158
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:55,000
I think they're like, oh, people like tablets. Let's make a tablet control. Oh, people are like really into 3D now.

1159
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:01,000
I think from a technical aspect, yeah, because they still very much want to profit on every console they sell.

1160
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Whereas other companies will take a loss, but they want to profit on every Wii U sold.

1161
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:10,000
So the tech specs aren't usually as impressive. But, you know, they believed in the tablet thing.

1162
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:16,000
They just, I guess, hope that third parties will be a little more excited about it than they really ended up being in practice.

1163
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:21,000
I think that's what kind of, you know, everybody sounded really excited about it in the beginning.

1164
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:29,000
But then, like, everybody just ran away. Like, when the system didn't do so well when it came out, everybody just ran away.

1165
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:36,000
And now it's been really up to Nintendo to support it. And, you know, instead of maybe necessarily doing these vision games they wanted to make,

1166
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,000
they had to do the games that they know would sell that they can do well that would sell.

1167
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Like, a new Mario Kart probably came out a little faster than maybe otherwise would have. And so on and so on.

1168
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Bobby says Nintendo's failing all the way to the bank.

1169
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,000
The DS is still doing well for them.

1170
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:59,000
I am glad the DS is doing well. I have high hopes for them with Zelda. I just hope it's enough.

1171
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:07,000
I mean, I don't know. They're doing okay right now, but there's only so long they can last on first party titles.

1172
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:12,000
And, yeah, I understand that the first party titles are good, and people do buy their systems for those titles.

1173
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:21,000
But how long is it going to be that people are going to just pay all this money just to buy first party games for this one platform?

1174
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:28,000
I mean, I don't know. This is why I'm not buying a system yet, because what else am I going to really play in there except for a couple games?

1175
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Well, here's a big part of Nintendo's future here as well, because these things won't stop selling.

1176
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:41,000
And this week, for a very brief period of time, Gold Mario Amiibo, they showed up.

1177
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:50,000
It was a Walmart exclusive thing, and they showed up for order, pre-order, whatever, on Walmart's website, and they were gone in minutes.

1178
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,000
And what happened? Of course, they're all up on eBay.

1179
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:02,000
$65, some are a little more modest, like $20 to $30, some are going up to $100.

1180
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:10,000
One pre-order reportedly went for $1500, although that could have been trolls that inflated that amount. Who knows?

1181
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:17,000
But the Gold Amiibo's flying, and I have to admit, like, I just...

1182
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
I don't get it.

1183
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,000
I don't get it. I don't. But you guys all know how I feel about the Amiibo in the first place.

1184
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:28,000
And then to take the Mario Amiibo and basically spray-paint it gold, I'm like, what's the big fucking deal? Why are people going so crazy?

1185
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Does he appear gold in the game when you play as them?

1186
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Or if it's not, then there's really no reason.

1187
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Even if he did, who cares? It's not, like, worth $60 from a scalper for that.

1188
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Just think about it. I don't understand, like, these Amiibos are like, what, $13? Is that what they are?

1189
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I mean, let's assume that you buy it at retail. Okay, so $13.

1190
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:55,000
You're essentially buying a character. It's not even a character DLC. You're buying, like, I don't even know what you're buying for $13.

1191
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Like, a collectible figure, cool, but...

1192
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:05,000
The figures are well-made, and the people that are collecting it for the figures themselves, and even the limited functionality there is, I get it.

1193
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Like, I don't want to make it sound like, oh, I fucking hate Amiibo and everybody that buys them is stupid or whatever.

1194
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
No, no, no, no, no, no. That's not what I'm saying.

1195
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:23,000
The thing I don't get is, because it is so limited, whether that's Port Strike, Nintendo's artificial, whatever the case may be, because it's so limited, it's the hysteria behind it.

1196
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,000
And the whole, I have to have every single one mentality that I don't get.

1197
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:32,000
I don't buy the Port Strike bullshit for a minute, because they've done this shit ever since, like, the Wii came out.

1198
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Like, oh, we just can't keep up with them, they've demanded so much!

1199
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Come on, they know how the fuck their products sell at this point.

1200
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:48,000
I don't believe for a second that, oh, that Port Strike, they even said it was light enough to where they could ship that shit air.

1201
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:56,000
So, I'm sorry. I don't buy that for a second. It's fucking artificial shortages to drive the hysteria up so that it's...

1202
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:03,000
How many fucking articles, seriously, and this is why I don't try to report on a lot of this stuff anyways, even though I guess we're talking about it now, but...

1203
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Well, it was a slower news week.

1204
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:14,000
I understand that. But, like, seriously, if you read the game box, how many fucking articles about Amiibos, because people are still looking for them and, like, talking about pre-orders and what's out, where it's out at.

1205
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Dude, who gives a shit?

1206
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Okay, I'm gonna tell you why. I'm gonna tell you why. The reason why all those articles are going, because of all the hysteria behind it, it's clickbait.

1207
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:34,000
It is essentially clickbait because never do these websites, well, I shouldn't say never, but rarely do these websites say, go here to pre-order the Amiibo.

1208
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,000
The website instead says, come to our site to learn about where you can get the Amiibo.

1209
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:44,000
You have to click through to their site, and then it will show you what is open and taking the orders for Amiibo.

1210
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,000
It's clickbait, and the reason why it's so popular is because money.

1211
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Because of the fact that there are people that want to hunt this stuff out and will snatch them up when they first come out so they can resell them.

1212
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:06,000
It's that money factor, and these sites that are running the story about who has them in at this second and so forth want those hits from people googling it and so forth.

1213
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:19,000
So stupid. I'm sick of hearing about these things. Because there's no, honestly, aside from being able to train them a little bit and smash them, there's really no worthwhile uses for these characters right now.

1214
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:26,000
It's a promise that these will be used in the future for something really interesting. I remember the Kinect like that.

1215
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Okay, SSJ100Matt in our chatroom over at Live.VogueNetwork.com saying, so it's Mario in a blue and white dress. I mean white and gold. I mean blue and black.

1216
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Shut up. Shut. Up.

1217
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:45,000
I had to make a reference at some point tonight. It was a good job. I'm high-fiving you, SSJ100Matt.

1218
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Okay, BobbyBlackWolfLoki calling you out a little bit here, and I have to get your thoughts on this, saying, quote, Nintendo can't survive this way for long. Quote, Nintendo sucks because there's too much demand.

1219
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:05,000
I thought Nintendo was a failing company and nobody cared about what they were selling. Now we're talking about too many people wanting what Nintendo is selling. Make up your mind.

1220
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:22,000
No, my mind is made up. They're not selling a lot of them because they're creating artificial shortages. So, I mean, they could be selling a lot more if they would, you know, do this bullshit, and you wouldn't have also that middle market, but it doesn't make for a good story if stuff's readily available.

1221
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Are you perhaps irritated because since you don't get Amiibo, and Amiibo is so popular right now because they're figures or this eBay hysteria or whatever, that the focus is not on games right now, the focus is on these figures.

1222
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,000
No, it's gonna be a focus...

1223
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:38,000
I was trying to help you out.

1224
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:58,000
No, no. Here's what it is. They're just going the same route as Activision is with Skylanders, and what it is is it's extremely profitable for them to create these figures. It costs nothing to make that shit. It costs nothing. Nowhere near $12, and they're making a huge profit from it.

1225
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:12,000
So of course they're gonna want that, and they're gonna want to put out as many of those as possible. That's why Skylanders, which is essentially nothing. At one point it was just like a knockoff of the Spyro brand. Now it's spun off into its own thing.

1226
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:19,000
I mean, they're making tons of money off that because people are dumb and will buy every single Skylanders figure that comes out and all the variants and all the other shit.

1227
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:34,000
They literally had, at one time, there was the Skylander that came with basically every single copy of that game. Whether you bought the starter pack or you bought if you already owned it pack or whatever they call that, it was just a different color.

1228
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:41,000
But people bought it. It's literally just a different fucking color than the one you already have.

1229
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:55,000
And people bought it because I don't know why. And this is the same reason with these Amiibos. It's a gold Mario. Who gives a shit? No one's gonna be like, oh my god, you have a gold Mario. That's so exclusive to Walmart.

1230
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:09,000
No one gives a shit. It's just an Amiibo. It's just a little toy. And now they're gonna have the card ones too. Whatever. You know what? I can't tell you how to spend your money. I just don't get it. I think they really need to have some worthwhile reason for this.

1231
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:19,000
It's tricky because actually, Loki, I do agree with you to a point. I really do. To a point. I think you might be a little harsh on it.

1232
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:28,000
It's like the new 3DS. They're like, oh, it's got all these features that we're not utilizing yet. Kind of like that. It's like, well, we promise we'll use it in really cool ways later on.

1233
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:33,000
But there's a lot of people that never got the 3DS XL, so there's a worthy upgrade there. I get it.

1234
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
That's fine, but they can still get the 3DS XLs now.

1235
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Back to Amiibo for a minute. I do kind of agree there's a lot of mentality out there of the, I have this and you don't, nah nah nah nah nah. Like, there's just a lot of that in gaming. You see that everywhere. The whole, like, I've got it and you don't, nah nah nah nah. Like, it's the whole, like, gotta catch them all and everything. That definitely plays a factor to it.

1236
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:08,000
You think Amiibos are bad now. You have no fucking idea. And you think I'm joking. They will put out a Pokemon Amiibo for every goddamn fucking Pokemon that they have.

1237
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:24,000
But, but, but. My mother, bless her heart, her birthday was this week, by the way. Happy birthday, mom. She collects dolls that she sees on QVC. She has a complete collection of Richard Simmons dolls.

1238
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Oh my god.

1239
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
That sell, yes, she has them in a glass case. Jamie's like, what?

1240
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I knew I loved your mother for a reason.

1241
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,000
You have to have them in a glass case so they don't kill you in the middle of the night when they come alive.

1242
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:41,000
And she also collects the Marie Osmond dolls, which are like a very similar thing that she also has in her glass case and so forth.

1243
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:48,000
So a lot of you are probably sitting here and going, oh my god, Richard Simmons dolls, really? Your mom's a quack and so forth.

1244
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,000
I'm just imagining these little porcelain dolls of Richard Simmons.

1245
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:59,000
You know what? Well, they're, they're old people that look like Richard Simmons. That's the whole, it's fascinating. But anyway, I'm not going to get into that.

1246
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:08,000
My point is, why does she buy them? Because she wants to. She wants to have them. She wants that collection. She wants them all in the case.

1247
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:12,000
And you know what? I, for one, the woman, did you Google it?

1248
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Yes, I did.

1249
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:21,000
The woman has worked very hard in her life. She raised me, for God's sake. She can have whatever she wants in her glass case.

1250
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:31,000
So if collecting all these amiibo, if going to the store at six o'clock in the morning and camping out and getting that amiibo and being right there and cleaning, if that's what you want,

1251
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:40,000
I am not one to question you on those choices and building up that collection. I'm just going to say, respectfully, not for me. Thank you.

1252
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
I don't, I don't care that much.

1253
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,000
In that case.

1254
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:50,000
And I wish Nintendo would put the dolls on QVC because my mother never had to wait at six a.m. to get a fucking doll.

1255
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
She could just call QVC and they happily took her money.

1256
01:20:52,000 --> 01:21:06,000
If that's the case, then you know what? I just hope, I hope to God that like months now, or months from now, when they haven't still found a real reasonable use for those amiibos, aside from unlocking some shit in a game,

1257
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:13,000
I really hope that you don't have your buyer's remorse at that time and realize, oh, I spent like $400 on these stupid, you know, figurines.

1258
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:18,000
I just hope that's the case because, I don't know, I just, I don't get it.

1259
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:30,000
And I, I, if, if they had a really good use to the, you know, for them, if, you know, aside from just training them for whatever, you know, in Smash Brothers, then I could probably get on board with that.

1260
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,000
But it just doesn't, it doesn't seem like they're used for anything.

1261
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. We have SHA100Matt, our local comedian, with another question saying, here's a question, what is harder to catch these days, amiibos or llamas?

1262
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Again, with the meme jokes for the week.

1263
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
You know it's easier to catch than amiibos?

1264
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Measles because of anti-vaxxers.

1265
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:02,000
I'm like, can we get something worked in there? Okay, I don't know what this is that, that is not.

1266
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:07,000
There's another link that I had above that one because it's actually that doll, that girl doll there.

1267
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,000
I found a picture of Richard Simmons like posing with her on the cover of like doll fancy or something.

1268
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:15,000
No, whatever. Okay, that, that second one is definitely not the doll.

1269
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Again, Dark Soccer is posting links in our live chat room over at live.vognetwork.com so I apologize. I know it's radio.

1270
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Okay, this, this is it. This first one that you linked here.

1271
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Like there's like a nun and like this guy just in a raincoat with pink wings or something was one of them.

1272
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I'm like, okay, those are actually kind of cute.

1273
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:37,000
See, okay, see the, and sorry, I'm describing this best I can for people listening on the podcast.

1274
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:43,000
There's like an old man here and he has a little tag and it said Nana's Family in the Mama's Family font, by the way.

1275
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:48,000
And it says Richard Simmons. That's how you know it's one of the dolls because it has a little tag on it, a little blue tag that says that.

1276
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
I don't get it though. It doesn't look like Richard Simmons.

1277
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,000
But there is, well, it's not just inspired by him. It's inspired by people in his family.

1278
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:59,000
So they, trust me, they look a little bit like him. They do. They do.

1279
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:04,000
This is just a little, like if you were a wrinkly old man and had, you know, billions of dollars of plastic surgery.

1280
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Sadly, Richard Simmons hasn't been seen in a year. He probably is starting to get that way.

1281
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Although I hate to think of it.

1282
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
I think that's what surgery's for.

1283
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Well, now all you need to do is stick one of those, you know, those readers on the bottom of that and there you go.

1284
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,000
There's your amiibo. It's a Richard Simmons old man amiibo.

1285
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:23,000
By the way, my mother loves Richard Simmons with all her heart and therefore so do I.

1286
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,000
So I'm just going to say, don't you fucking come for Richard Simmons.

1287
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Hey!

1288
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,000
I'm going to wreck you. I'm just going to say that loud and clear. The man is a saint.

1289
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Rob.

1290
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
End of story.

1291
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,000
I was actually going to ask you if you wanted me to put together a RuPaul for you.

1292
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,000
A what?

1293
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
I was going to make you your favorite drag queen.

1294
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:48,000
If you could, if you sent me pictures, I could totally make you a ball jointed doll that looks like your favorite drag queen.

1295
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:57,000
My favorite drag queen. I probably amongst all the seasons, one of my very favorites ever was probably, I don't know, probably right now actually at the moment, Alaska.

1296
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
Alaska was probably my favorite.

1297
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
There was one that I was-

1298
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,000
After all, my Final Fantasy character is Lil Poundcake, so.

1299
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:26,000
There was one though that I was looking at though who is up for like some like board member status for one of the GLBTQA something deal who is a drag queen that goes by, fuck I can't think of the name now, but using his Native American roots for his drag persona.

1300
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Hmm.

1301
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,000
And I can't remember, but the gorgeous.

1302
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Hmm.

1303
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
And that's Dan.

1304
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,000
And your phone just made a level up noise as you were talking about drag queen.

1305
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
When Dan texts me, it makes level up noise.

1306
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Yeah, SSJ reminded me in chat, SSJ100Matt said, Richard Simmons retweeted and favorited one of Rob's tweets. He died that day.

1307
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
He actually didn't retweet it, but he did respond to it. And yes, that did make my day.

1308
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Have you seen the-

1309
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
You know who I called first thing?

1310
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
My mother.

1311
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Your mom.

1312
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:59,000
You know, actually though, have you seen who I've been in a really random tagging really randomly in a Twitter conversation?

1313
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Hmm.

1314
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Is Moon Yoon at Zappa.

1315
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Me and this other guy were like, I retweeted something that she said about having like a social media thing that was all pictures of your pets.

1316
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Hmm.

1317
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,000
And then we started talking about making one that was all reaction gifs and you got in on it too.

1318
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
And you tagged her for this.

1319
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
So I don't even remember this.

1320
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I'm sure that Ms. Zappa is sitting here going, the fuck are these people?

1321
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:31,000
All right, look, we got to take a time, we got to take a time back, a step back to the classic game of the week.

1322
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Back when the Zappas were, you know, all the craze actually. No, not that far back.

1323
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:41,000
But we are going to take a step back in gaming's history with a saying that we call the classic game of the week,

1324
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:48,000
where DarkStalker is going to step into the vault and she's going to find a game that she thinks, hey, you all should be playing this game this week.

1325
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:53,000
And you know what? I think this week DarkStalker has picked a game I think a lot of you have played,

1326
01:25:53,000 --> 01:26:00,000
but you should probably go back and play it again to remember how awesome the series used to be.

1327
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,000
So many feelings.

1328
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Me too. We talked about some of these feelings last week.

1329
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
DarkStalker, what is the classic game of the week?

1330
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Mortal Kombat 2.

1331
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Mortal Kombat.

1332
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Electric Boogaloo?

1333
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,000
No.

1334
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Mortal Kombat 2, now mind you, I have done the first Mortal Kombat, you know,

1335
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:20,000
but Mortal Kombat 2 has a very special place in the bowels of my bowels.

1336
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Bow.

1337
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:29,000
The cockles of the heart. Maybe the liver. Maybe even the colon.

1338
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Sorry, I'm just getting some of that tense battle music.

1339
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Mortal Kombat 2, when it came out, it was a thing.

1340
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Like, a thing capitalized in bold text with that weird MS Word 3D effect and exclamation points.

1341
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
It was a thing.

1342
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Which is probably topical for the day anyway.

1343
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,000
So it came out in 1993.

1344
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:00,000
This was actually my senior year of high school.

1345
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:05,000
And it was just a big thing.

1346
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,000
It came out on damn near everything too that was available at the time.

1347
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,000
But it was the second game in the Mortal Kombat series.

1348
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:15,000
It really added a lot more to the mythology of the game.

1349
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,000
It gave us more fatalities.

1350
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:24,000
New characters, which actually had, I was completely addicted to playing as Kitana.

1351
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:33,000
We got Kung Lao Molina, who is actually coming up with a very big role in the current Mortal Kombat game.

1352
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:38,000
And then it had Shao Kahn in there, who I don't believe was playable to begin with.

1353
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:46,000
But now he's like the big bad and you get to play as the previous boss.

1354
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,000
It's set in Outworld, so it has a lot more going on in it.

1355
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:54,000
A lot more crazy mysticism.

1356
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:58,000
You know, weird backgrounds.

1357
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,000
And microphone destruction.

1358
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:10,000
This is probably, to me, the best, best, best of the entire series.

1359
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Just saying.

1360
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:18,000
It also had a spinoff game that came out called Mortal Kombat Shao Lin Monks.

1361
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:23,000
And it was the biggest influence on the 2011 reboot of Mortal Kombat.

1362
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:27,000
It was, all the characters were digitized.

1363
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:35,000
They stopped this, I believe, after Mortal Kombat 3, so Mortal Kombat 3 was the last one to digitize the characters.

1364
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:42,000
It had, you know, really in-depth, you know, high punch, low punch, high kick, low kick.

1365
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
All kinds of different, neat easter eggs.

1366
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
You had crouching punch, turnaround kicks.

1367
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
All kinds of more stuff that was thrown in it.

1368
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:54,000
The whole uppercut, including the toasty that you could get.

1369
01:28:54,000 --> 01:29:01,000
And basically, the big thing that was taken out of it, which I thought didn't hurt the game at all, was the test your might thing.

1370
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:05,000
And the point system from the first game.

1371
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
That was, I was glad to see, gone.

1372
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Of course, we had the fatalities.

1373
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,000
Every character, I believe, had at least two.

1374
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:16,000
You also had the babalities, where they turned the opponent into the crying baby.

1375
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Friendships, which were absolutely freaking hilarious.

1376
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
I loved...

1377
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Friendships were rad.

1378
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Oh, yeah.

1379
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Like, uh...

1380
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Just a little voice.

1381
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Friendship, friendship.

1382
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Well, I also feel like Molinas was, what, making a cake.

1383
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Yeah.

1384
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:34,000
And Johnny Cage was his signature.

1385
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
And, uh...

1386
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Luke Cage's was a disco dance.

1387
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:42,000
This video we have here that we're looking at in the studio is a bunch of kulau doing the fighting.

1388
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
And I believe he pulls a bunny out of his hat.

1389
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Yes.

1390
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I believe he does.

1391
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
Or either that or it was Raiden.

1392
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,000
No, Raiden does the rainbow.

1393
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Yeah.

1394
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,000
Raiden does the rainbow.

1395
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
Um...

1396
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,000
You also have, um, of course...

1397
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Oh my god, he just did it in the video.

1398
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
He did the bunny.

1399
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
He's cute.

1400
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Yeah.

1401
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Friendship, friendship.

1402
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Friendship, friendship.

1403
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Anyway, sorry.

1404
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Distracted.

1405
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Um, anyway, you also had stage-specific fatalities.

1406
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Like, you had, uh, the pit, you had the acid, you had, uh...

1407
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:16,000
You know, you even had the, uh...

1408
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,000
What was the, the one for, um...

1409
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
What was his name?

1410
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
The guy that would shape-shift.

1411
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Shang Tsung.

1412
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Shang Tsung, yeah.

1413
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Um, you had his Goro Fatality.

1414
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Where he would shape-shift into Goro.

1415
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Where you had to hold the, was it the low-kick button?

1416
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
You had to hold it for 40 seconds.

1417
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:38,000
So what we would do is we would just have somebody hold that button for us while we were doing it.

1418
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Nice.

1419
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,000
So we could see it.

1420
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Um, there were a bunch of different beta editions of this, too.

1421
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,000
That was the big thing.

1422
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Oh yeah, Baraka was in this game, too.

1423
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Baraka was cool.

1424
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Um...

1425
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
Baby Baraka.

1426
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Baby Baraka.

1427
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Um, but anyway, uh, this, uh...

1428
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:05,000
There were so many different, uh, beta versions that were out that you actually found strategy guides being released for the beta editions of these.

1429
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:12,000
You know, when the internet was in its infancy as far as a big source of public information, we had...

1430
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
We got this shit off BBSs that were connected.

1431
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Fuck yeah.

1432
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Connected BBS message boards.

1433
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:24,000
So it's like somebody in fucking, uh, Sunnyvale or, you know, wherever the homes were would post on their BBS.

1434
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,000
And then like the BBS in Fresno would download from that.

1435
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:30,000
And then the BBS here in Sacramento would download from that.

1436
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,000
It's like that's how we got all our fucking moves lists and things.

1437
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Crazy.

1438
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:40,000
But, like, it's so crazy because, I mean, we actually started following, like, some of these actors.

1439
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Like, have I seen them in other games?

1440
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Or are they doing other things?

1441
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,000
You know?

1442
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Or do they play three people in the same game?

1443
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Exactly.

1444
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Like, uh, palette-swap people.

1445
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Like, uh, you know, just looking at, uh, you know, uh...

1446
01:31:55,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Like, the one who played Kitana and Mileena after a while, I think she actually was a...

1447
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,000
An actual, legit, um, martial artist.

1448
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
She was a Cuban lady.

1449
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
I think a lot of them were.

1450
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
I think a lot of them, uh, big in Chicago were...

1451
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Yeah.

1452
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,000
They were based.

1453
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Um, but basically, uh, the thing about those beta editions is that the fact that whenever they would put out a tweak to the game...

1454
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:24,000
And see, a lot of the betas on these were mostly East Coast, which is...

1455
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:29,000
That was when I, um, my high school band took a trip up the East Coast to go to New York.

1456
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
And we got to try...

1457
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:36,000
We ran into at least two different, um, game betas at the time.

1458
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Having photocopied BBS printouts of move lists and combo patterns.

1459
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:49,000
And it was back in the day of Kitana's Infinite, where you could do the fly and the fan and the thing over and over again.

1460
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
I always used to be so good at that.

1461
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Um, so yeah, um, in this game we had Baraka, we had Jax, who ended up getting, like, the neck of arms and whatever.

1462
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Um, Kitana, we had Kung Lao, we had Mileena, and we also then had the returning characters of Johnny Cage, rest in peace.

1463
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Liu Kang, uh, Raiden, uh, Reptile, Scorpion, Shang Tsung, and Sub-Zero.

1464
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Um, for the non-playables you had Shao Kahn, and you had, uh, Kentaro, who was actually a stop motion animation while the rest of everybody was ditched.

1465
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Um, hidden characters in here were, um, you had Jade, who was a, uh, green palette swap of Kitana and Mileena.

1466
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:42,000
You had Noob Saibot, who was the lost warrior from the first Mortal Kombat game, who, you know, people kept saying,

1467
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Oh, he's hidden in the game. Well, they put him in.

1468
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Um, and then you had Smoke, who was in gray with the smoke effect.

1469
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Um, you, uh, you could not play as Sonya Arcana, although they did, uh, show up in the background.

1470
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:58,000
Was Reptile in two?

1471
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Reptile was in two, I believe.

1472
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Yeah.

1473
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Because Reptile had the acid breath.

1474
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Yeah. He did that little forest ball that went, ehh, ehh, ehh, and it would make you, like, fly over, yeah.

1475
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:14,000
And this was also the game that, and actually, I think if you fought Reptile, you fought him in the pit, or one of the guys you fought in the spike pit.

1476
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
In Mortal Kombat 1, you did. In Mortal Kombat 1, you did.

1477
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Yeah.

1478
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Uh, but Reptile was just a character like any other in this game.

1479
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Yeah.

1480
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Um, the other thing, too, is, um, this is the game that gave, uh, gave us, uh, Ermac.

1481
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Because it was in the, uh, I actually got to see it, too.

1482
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Um, one of the arcade techs at my, um, at the, uh, movie theater I used to go to would, uh, you know, say,

1483
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Hey, look, this is where they got the Ermac from, and this is this guy, and this is this guy.

1484
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:50,000
And he's like, I wonder what this is gonna be. I've tried to, to fiddle around with this, and I haven't found anything in the code, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1485
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,000
And it was just really crazy.

1486
01:34:53,000 --> 01:35:05,000
The whole point, though, is that Ed Boom, who was, uh, the lead programmer, said that the big thing was that they wanted to make it look, uh, different than the original Mortal Kombat.

1487
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:09,000
And it has everything in the game that they didn't have time for in the first one.

1488
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Um, they said they got new equipment, um, and just everything.

1489
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:22,000
They had actually started working on it while they were still in the middle of the whole mania that was surrounding the first Mortal Kombat.

1490
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Um, the actors were actually filmed in, uh, on a gray screen, recorded on a Hi8 camera, and then, um, uh, which then they ended up, uh, upgrading the camera that they were using.

1491
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:41,000
The video capture was computer-processed and rendered, so it was a lot of different stuff like this.

1492
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:45,000
They were even said that they were spray-painted with water to make them look sweaty.

1493
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:56,000
And to, um, and then they actually went and re-edited the sprites that they made from those captures to add shine and add more depth to muscle and everything.

1494
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:02,000
I always thought, especially because we're looking at the video again where he's fighting Liu Kang, and Liu Kang looks especially shiny.

1495
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Yeah.

1496
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Goro and Kentaro were clay sculptures that were made by a friend of, uh, John Tobias.

1497
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Um, and these were, uh, turned into 12-inch latex miniatures for stop-motion filming.

1498
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Um, and they had to keep all of the, um, the costumes simple because of things like, uh, what they had to be able to animate.

1499
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:36,000
So they would actually freeze, uh, have them pose in, like, a curled-up position so that if they had to do things like a backflip or something, it was just a stationary pose.

1500
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
It wasn't, like, a full animation.

1501
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Um, and then, um, the memory limitation, um, of the game was why they couldn't include more of the characters from the previous game.

1502
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:56,000
They had to have more palette-swap characters, um, and just had the move lists, you know, set for each character.

1503
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:03,000
Um, the other thing, too, is that they actually, uh, worked on gravity effects for the game.

1504
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Um, redid a lot of the music. Basically, they just put- went all out into this.

1505
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Um, and there was even a, um, a comic book that came out, um, when the arcade version came out.

1506
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:19,000
It was actually written and done, uh, drawn by Tobias.

1507
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,000
I've had a copy of this at one time.

1508
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:26,000
So as far as, um, versions, there's a fucking buttload of them.

1509
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Um, there are- there's actually a whole wiki page dedicated to the various versions.

1510
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:39,000
So there was the Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo, Game Boy, Game Gear, Master System, 32X PlayStation,

1511
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Sega Saturn, Amiga, DOS, um, later releases under the Midway Arcade Treasures,

1512
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,000
and then PSN, Xbox Live Arcade, and Windows editions.

1513
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,000
So, trust me, it's not hard to find this.

1514
01:37:50,000 --> 01:38:01,000
What I want to find is, um, good, uh, emulators of the, uh, what's the version of the- of the beta versions.

1515
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Because the betas, I think, were a little bit more fun to play.

1516
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Ooh, I think I have some of those on the cabinet.

1517
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Mm-hmm.

1518
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Um, now the game, though, was opened up to a ton of controversy, even more than the first window.

1519
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:18,000
So many people were like, ooh, violence and blood and blah blah blah blah blah.

1520
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
And it was banned in Germany.

1521
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Um, it was considered harmful to young persons.

1522
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:30,000
All versions except the Game Boy edition were confiscated for violating German penal code.

1523
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Um, the game also came out with green colored blood and black and white fatality sequences in Japan.

1524
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Um, which was kind of the opposite of what we would have with games that came out over here from Japan.

1525
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Yeah, isn't that the opposite of what happened with Kill Bill?

1526
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Yeah.

1527
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Well, Kill Bill was still much later, but-

1528
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Yeah, I know, but still, it's just interesting.

1529
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Um, and this is something, actually, that Boon came out saying that they were glad, you know, that a rating system is actually a good idea.

1530
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:03,000
And they were happy that it existed for the time that Mortal Kombat 2 came out.

1531
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:09,000
It was an M-rated game, so people wouldn't have an issue with it. They knew what they were going into.

1532
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Um-

1533
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Which is funny, because nowadays if it's an M-rated game, they don't know what they're getting into, for the most part.

1534
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:27,000
And then, uh, Guy Aoki, who was the president of a media action network for Asian Americans, said that it was perpetuating existing stereotypes of Asian martial artists.

1535
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Even though, and I will point this out, most of the, uh, cast was Hispanic.

1536
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Um, it's just a whole bunch of crap came out, and then there were, you know, it was just so much that went out, and now we sort of look at it and go, oh, oh, oh, laugh about it.

1537
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
But we still see this happen today.

1538
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:57,000
I think many folks our age certainly remember it was, like, the first Super Nintendo game where Nintendo finally said, all right, you can put blood in the game.

1539
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:00,000
You know, and that's probably thanks to the fact that the ESRB was there now.

1540
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Oh my god, this game was great on Super Nintendo.

1541
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:05,000
And Super Nintendo was a great translation, it really was.

1542
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:13,000
But I remember sitting up with my little brothers, uh, because, um, in the arcade, this actually had things hidden in it.

1543
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:22,000
I was gonna say, you are not gonna, you've been talking about this game for almost 15 minutes now, which is fine, it's a game that needs it, but you cannot end this without talking about the hidden game in the game.

1544
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
You cannot.

1545
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:38,000
After playing 250 consecutive games, um, I believe it would be 250 consecutive victories of, um, this game, you could unlock Pong.

1546
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Yes, you can play Pong hidden in this game.

1547
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,000
I mean, I'm sorry, it's Midway. Fuck.

1548
01:40:44,000 --> 01:41:01,000
So, um, it was just, my brothers and I sat and tried so hard to see if it was there in the Super Nintendo version only to find out that it only let us play 200 matches before it reset the number.

1549
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:03,000
So sad, so sad.

1550
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Um, there were, of course, other rumors of unlockable content, like, um, the Nudality, which, of course, wasn't gonna happen, you know, because people can't seem to separate, you know, their libido from a fucking video game.

1551
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Um, there was also, um, you know, a few different Torch, there was the Torch thing that was basically a unnamed Liu Kang that was, like, back in the background of one of the pits.

1552
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Um, and then they actually brought that out in Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance as a character named Blaze, um, who actually became the final boss of Mortal Kombat Armageddon.

1553
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Um, the Animalities, which they, you know, had rumored in this one, they came out in Mortal Kombat 3.

1554
01:41:51,000 --> 01:42:00,000
So, uh, there was even that, wasn't the, there was the Mortal Kombat movie, which was good. The second Mortal Kombat movie was crap.

1555
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:08,000
And I don't even think I bared with, bothered, no, I did see the second one in the theater, it was the third one I was forced to watch and wanted that hour and a half of my life back.

1556
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,000
It was straight to video, wasn't it? The third one was straight to video, wasn't it?

1557
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,000
I think so. Maybe, I don't remember.

1558
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:19,000
Mortal Kombat 2 actually does have an HD remake collection, which is a Mortal Kombat arcade collection.

1559
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Um, but yeah, you know, I'm actually really disappointed because this article doesn't have all of the hidden stuff in it.

1560
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Um, and then there was the, um, yeah, the other rumor about Scarlet, remember?

1561
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Oh yeah.

1562
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Which was supposed to be a red palette swap of Mileena, and she ended up being in the 2011 Mortal Kombat.

1563
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:55,000
So, I guess there's all this stuff in there. But yeah, I like how they take the speculations that the fan community has, you know, made or tried to do and like, okay, well, you asked for it.

1564
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Thank you for saving us the idea of, you know, trouble, you know, of brainstorming this. Here we go.

1565
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
So yeah, the game's Mortal Kombat 2.

1566
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:10,000
There it is. As I say, that 16-minute video finished Star Saga. You've been talking about this game a long time. That's alright. You know what? It's a great game.

1567
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
I have fond, fond memories.

1568
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,000
As I'm sure a lot of people do.

1569
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Fond, fuzzy, warm, happy memories.

1570
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Alright.

1571
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Of such a violent, gory game.

1572
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:25,000
But we are going to take a break, guys. When we come back, there's plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come, including the chance for you guys to call in and participate with the show.

1573
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Maybe you want to talk to Loki about that whole amiibo thing, or maybe you want to talk about Final Fantasy, especially the Final Fantasy Mexico version, as Darusaku was talking about earlier in the show.

1574
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Or...

1575
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
I do like that title, though. That's awesome.

1576
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:47,000
If you are, you aren't excited for Dragon Quest Heroes. We'll talk about all that and more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.

1577
01:43:47,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this March 1st, 2015. Can you believe it's March already? The 589th episode of our show, already in progress.

1578
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:17,000
And before we get to rapid-fire news tonight, let us go to the forum follow-up segment, where we are going to take a post or two from our forums and talk about it.

1579
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Actually, there wasn't a lot of activity on the forums this week, and part of that was my bad. I didn't really get around to making any topics to follow up last week's show, because I was doing some other stuff.

1580
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:39,000
But, thankfully, some of y'all remember that you can make topics, and we'll still talk about them on the show if you want to do some extended discussion.

1581
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:46,000
And Flaco Jones made a topic on the forum this week that he calls the Metacritic Danger Zone.

1582
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:53,000
And that was inspired by something we were talking about on last week's show with The Order and the poor Metacritic score that The Order was receiving.

1583
01:44:53,000 --> 01:45:00,000
And so Flaco Jones was wondering on the forums, what is your favorite game that scored a 74 or lower, that would be yellow or red,

1584
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:05,000
despite the fact that you think it's plenty awesome anyway? I'm going to be greedy and pick two.

1585
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:10,000
And Flaco Jones picked Beyond Two Souls, which had got a 70 on Metacritic, saying,

1586
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:37,000
And then Flaco Jones mentions Game & Wario for Wii U, which got a 61.

1587
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Not a lot of responses in our forums. Maybe you guys want to chime in at our chat room right now over at live.vognole.com.

1588
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Since I didn't get to comment on that, I would say probably any of the Earth Defense Force games, because those are all nice in the middle there.

1589
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:09,000
I had picked a few as well. I picked White Knight Chronicles, which I think got a 64 on Metacritic.

1590
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:15,000
But it's a level 5 game, which you know, Fantasy Life, Ni No Kuni. I liked it more than most people did.

1591
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:20,000
I didn't think it was like a plus game, but it was better than a lot of people said it was.

1592
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Especially when you consider the sequel was both games, which was a really good value.

1593
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:29,000
And I also picked Every Extend Extra, which was a 74, so it was like right on the border.

1594
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:34,000
But I think Every Extend Extra should have been a game that was in the 90s. It was one of the PSP highlights for me.

1595
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:39,000
And I loved the version they had on Xbox 360 as well, Every Extend Extra Extreme.

1596
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:44,000
So, anyway, thank you Flaco for that topic this week.

1597
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:50,000
And if you want to participate with some follow-up topics from this week's show, forums.vognetwork.com.

1598
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Dark Soccer, before I have you do your rapid-fire news stories, any games you can think of that you love that critics did not love?

1599
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:05,000
I can think of a lot of movies I love that critics hate. I like Xanadu.

1600
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Yeah, that's true. I can think of a lot of those pretty easy too. It's a little harder with games.

1601
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:17,000
I've liked a few RPGs that got kind of poo-pooed as being too simplistic or too short.

1602
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
Final Fantasy Mystic Quest? Just kidding.

1603
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:28,000
No. Do Prism, or what do we get it over here? Threads of Fate? I liked that game.

1604
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:37,000
There's been greatly lauded games that I didn't like. So, it's a matter of taste and no critic can tell you what to like.

1605
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Don't judge me. I love what I love.

1606
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,000
That's right.

1607
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,000
They can bite my butt.

1608
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:49,000
Alright, speaking Dark Sakura of you and what's going on, you actually are going to be departing the show a little early tonight because you have some IRL things going on.

1609
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Yeah.

1610
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:56,000
So, we're going to let you go ahead and do your rapid-fire news here and then we'll be saying bye to you for the night.

1611
01:47:56,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Yeah, too bad. But there are burritos in my future, maybe.

1612
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Wait, are you saying burritos are more important than this show?

1613
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:07,000
No, I'm just saying burritos are at least as important as the show.

1614
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:08,000
Mm-hmm.

1615
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:18,000
So, basically there is some news about Street Fighter V that's going to be a PS4 console exclusive, but also have a PC release.

1616
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:35,000
And it's going to have a cross-platform play, but there is a character hinted at that's going to be in here is Nash from Street Fighter Alpha.

1617
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Hmm.

1618
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,000
So, that's happy.

1619
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
But they showed off Charlie this week, wasn't it?

1620
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Well...

1621
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Same. Charlie Nash.

1622
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,000
Nash Charlie.

1623
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Oh, yeah.

1624
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Same character.

1625
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
I don't think it's a rumor anymore. They had gameplay of him.

1626
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Yeah, it's up there. The pictures are out.

1627
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Yep.

1628
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
Now it was in Mexico and they're teasing it as, uh...

1629
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
No, I can't...

1630
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Rolento?

1631
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:56,000
No, not Rolento.

1632
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,000
I want Rolento in the game.

1633
01:48:58,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Uh...

1634
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,000
God.

1635
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,000
The master of, uh, was...

1636
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Bison.

1637
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Bison. Thank you.

1638
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,000
I was like, duh.

1639
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:07,000
I can see his face.

1640
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,000
I can't think of his name.

1641
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
The human chin.

1642
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Uh, the guy with the cape.

1643
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,000
Uh, Superman.

1644
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:14,000
No, no.

1645
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,000
No.

1646
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:18,000
As if I do recall correctly, he was in Japan.

1647
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,000
He was Vega.

1648
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,000
So...

1649
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Next in news, we have a Blaze Blue game, but it's a rhythm game, and you can get it now.

1650
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:35,000
It actually is a mobile game called Eat Beat Dead Spikes On.

1651
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:40,000
So I might have to get that just because the name is absolutely hilarious.

1652
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:46,000
And then, last but not least, there is a game jam going on.

1653
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:54,000
A month-long game jam called Jam For Leela that is dealing with trans issues.

1654
01:49:54,000 --> 01:50:00,000
So I'm really, really looking forward to what's going to be coming out of this.

1655
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:05,000
There's a visual novel done by Lara Kate Dale from Destructoid.

1656
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Lots of other neat stuff to be seen from that one, so I'm really looking forward to it.

1657
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
It should be almost done.

1658
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:15,000
There are 22 participating games that are available now.

1659
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,000
So, that's it.

1660
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Leela, if I'm not mistaken, was the teen that took her own life and made the big tumb-

1661
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
That her parents were being shits over.

1662
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Yeah, she made the big Tumblr post about it, and the parents really, really needed education.

1663
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
To put it lightly.

1664
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:37,000
No, I'm just going to say plainly, her parents had access to the education.

1665
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Her parents were shits.

1666
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Yeah.

1667
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Very deep fundamentalists.

1668
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:42,000
They are...

1669
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,000
I don't have a problem with a person being a fundamentalist, but the moment-

1670
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
They were like the mom and Carrie.

1671
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Yeah.

1672
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Unfortunately.

1673
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:55,000
The moment that your fundamentalism impacts the life of another person so dramatically

1674
01:50:55,000 --> 01:51:00,000
that it drives them to want to die, maybe you should stop and evaluate your beliefs.

1675
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Just saying.

1676
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Sorry, I didn't mean to take it to a rough place, but I think that shocking news really

1677
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,000
rallied people to want to...

1678
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:17,000
In case people might be wondering, why is this important?

1679
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Why are we reporting on it?

1680
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Because we as a society have a long way to go with trans issues still.

1681
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Long way to go.

1682
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:29,000
We're making a lot of progress with gay and lesbian.

1683
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
We're making progress.

1684
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
We're not there yet, but we're making a lot of progress.

1685
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,000
34 states.

1686
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:36,000
When I've lost count of how many states, that's good.

1687
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Even though I-

1688
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:38,000
My home state.

1689
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Even though I would like to say-

1690
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Alabama.

1691
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Even though I would like to say 50 states.

1692
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:48,000
But what happened with Lila regretfully shows we have a long way to go with our trans brothers

1693
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,000
and sisters.

1694
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:52,000
So that's why this is important, in case you were wondering.

1695
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:58,000
There actually is a really good Tumblr out there, by the way, for people who are transitioning

1696
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:04,000
or even non-gender associated called Non-Binary Support.

1697
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
I follow them.

1698
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:10,000
I actually have really good information out, because I've tried to offer up support for

1699
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:15,000
people on that forum when I can.

1700
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:21,000
It's one thing when you are sitting there with a friend of yours who is practically

1701
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:25,000
in tears, because she could have been that person.

1702
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:28,000
It really hits home.

1703
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:34,000
Anyway, to change the topic and move along here, DarkSakura, you are going to be on your

1704
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:35,000
way out.

1705
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,000
So let's ask at the end of the show, but I'll ask you now, do you have any final thoughts

1706
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
for our listeners tonight?

1707
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:44,000
I'm hungry, and I really want to play Twinbee.

1708
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Ikuma and I have been chatting about Twinbee.

1709
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Well, then you need to get a burrito, and you need to play some Twinbee, but not tonight.

1710
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
And then I have to go to bed.

1711
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:52,000
You got to go to bed.

1712
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Put that on your to-do list for tomorrow.

1713
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Tomorrow, work Twinbee.

1714
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Basically, my normal shift is like 1130 to 830, and my shift this week is seven to four.

1715
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Fun.

1716
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:08,000
And guess whose sleep cycle is going to be completely uprooted and turned on its end?

1717
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Well, I'm going to East Coast, so the same thing will happen to me, for what it's worth.

1718
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Yeah, but you're not going to be at work.

1719
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,000
I'm also seven to four.

1720
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,000
Woo!

1721
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:16,000
That's this week, too.

1722
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Why don't I sleep anyway?

1723
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,000
So that's okay.

1724
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
No, no, no.

1725
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,000
And I'm really not trying to complain.

1726
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,000
I love my job.

1727
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,000
I just hate waking up early.

1728
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Sure.

1729
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,000
I understand.

1730
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
All right, let's go on to some more rapid-fire news.

1731
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Have a good night, DarkSakura.

1732
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
We'll see you in two weeks.

1733
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Loki, your rapid-fire news tonight.

1734
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Okay, so this is kind of cool.

1735
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:41,000
I'm a pretty big fan of Terry Cavanaugh, and they've got a brand new game that he's making.

1736
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Hopefully, it's uber hard as well.

1737
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:48,000
It's called Grab Them by the Eyes, and it's basically you play a street food vendor named

1738
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Jay who must resort to buying an endless wave of ever flashier signs in order to attract

1739
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:56,000
attention for your business.

1740
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:59,000
That sounds hilarious.

1741
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:02,000
I guess they're saying that it's almost like a card game.

1742
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:07,000
And the signs have various texts, colors, borders, and effects, and each of those elements

1743
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:12,000
contribute to some number of customers to the day's totals.

1744
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:16,000
So, I do want to check this out.

1745
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Not sure when it's supposed to be released, though, but it looks pretty awesome.

1746
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:22,000
It's on the web, right?

1747
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Oh, it is on its website.

1748
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:24,000
I think it's already there.

1749
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Oh, I thought it was something he was selling.

1750
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:26,000
No.

1751
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Okay, well, yeah.

1752
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Go check it out, then.

1753
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:31,000
And don't forget about the sequel, Grab Them by the Ass.

1754
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Weren't you leaving?

1755
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,000
Yeah.

1756
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,000
He's a talented guy.

1757
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Yes, there you go.

1758
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:37,000
I'll play just because he's eating on it.

1759
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Okay, you can check it out.

1760
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:45,000
terrycavanaghames.com slash grabthembytheeyes slash grabthembytheeyes is all one word.

1761
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Awesome.

1762
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,000
That's awesome.

1763
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Bye.

1764
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:52,000
That sounds like a premise of a funny cartoon, so I'd be down with that.

1765
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:58,000
And then, you know, one of the things that people kind of hated about Resident Evil Revelations 2

1766
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:02,000
was the fact that, you know, the PC version got released, and then they're all,

1767
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:07,000
oh, hey, by the way, there's some features that we cut out, but we didn't tell you about that until after the game was released.

1768
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:14,000
One of those features was local co-op, and thanks to modders,

1769
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:19,000
and this is sad that we live in a day and age now where companies can't fix their games,

1770
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
but modders have to fix them for them.

1771
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:28,000
They've added a mod to actually allow for split-stream co-op.

1772
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:32,000
The only thing is right now is it's not part of the raid mode.

1773
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:38,000
It's just in the local story mode, and also apparently you have to use game pads,

1774
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:41,000
but that's still pretty cool, and I guess they're still working on that.

1775
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:47,000
If you want to check it out, you can actually go find it in the Steam community forums for the game.

1776
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:56,000
And then lastly, Payday 2 is getting a cool cameo character for their game,

1777
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:01,000
including Jacket from Hotline Miami 2,

1778
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:05,000
and you're going to be able to, by purchasing the game on Steam,

1779
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:12,000
you'll be able to unlock stuff in Payday 2, including the Jacket character,

1780
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:18,000
also, you know, themed masks and weapons, so that's pretty sweet.

1781
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Will it have the sweet music?

1782
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:25,000
I don't know if it will have the sweet music, hopefully, because that would be pretty sweet.

1783
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:29,000
I really need to go back and play that game. I have it on a bunch of different platforms.

1784
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,000
Right, before the sequel's out.

1785
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:33,000
I know, I need to. I'll make that a point this week to go play that game.

1786
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:37,000
That and Civ 5, because I have it installed on my system now.

1787
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Nice. You've got to get to Beyond Earth, too, because Sid Meier's Starships got dated.

1788
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:46,000
It's like the week after next, or something like that?

1789
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:52,000
It's only $14.99, so it must be kind of a scaled-down game, but I'm excited to check it out, that's for sure.

1790
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Yeah, you can check that out. It's a pretty awesome pre-order bonus, I guess, if you have both of those games.

1791
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:02,000
All right, moving on with some other news that I have for you guys,

1792
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,000
including some updates with Forza Horizon 2.

1793
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:11,000
There's going to be a standalone expansion called Forza Horizon 2 Presents Fast and Furious.

1794
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Could that have anything to do with the new movie coming out pretty soon? Probably.

1795
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:20,000
But the expansion will be free from March 27th through April 10th.

1796
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,000
I like free.

1797
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Well, motivation to be an Xbox owner now, too.

1798
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,000
And it's standalone.

1799
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Yes, it is. It will cost $10 after that, just so you know.

1800
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:34,000
But once you download it during the free period, you still have it free of charge.

1801
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Ludicrous will be arriving in the game with that.

1802
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Well, also, too, even if you have an Xbox 360, but say you don't have an Xbox One,

1803
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:46,000
you can always download that online, and then you still have it in your library,

1804
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:51,000
because that's what I've done with all the Xbox Live game with gold games, even though I don't have an Xbox One yet.

1805
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Also, Shovel Knight will be coming out on PlayStation 4, Vita, and PlayStation 3.

1806
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:00,000
We knew that this was coming from, I think, the PlayStation Experience,

1807
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:03,000
is when they announced that Shovel Knight will make its way over there.

1808
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:10,000
But now we have a date. April 21st is the date. PlayStation Plus members will be able to pick this game up for $13.49,

1809
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:13,000
a little discount there, $15 after that.

1810
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:19,000
There will be a boss battle with Kratos in the game, so a lot of people will be checking it out for that fact alone,

1811
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,000
and to be able to play with that pretty awesome PlayStation 4 controller.

1812
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Another game I have owned, but I haven't played yet.

1813
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Shame, shame.

1814
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Damn it.

1815
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:28,000
All right.

1816
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:31,000
I was almost going to buy more games this week, too, for no apparent reason.

1817
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:36,000
And get this, a Sega Capcom crossover comic, Worlds Unite.

1818
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:42,000
That's right, Archie Comics creating Worlds Unite, and it's a crossover between Sega and Capcom,

1819
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:46,000
and lots of characters, including some we haven't seen in a very long time.

1820
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:47,000
And Mega Man, which...

1821
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Mega Man, for one.

1822
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Ironically, you know.

1823
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Get this, though, from Sega, Billy Hatcher, Alex Kidd.

1824
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:54,000
It's pretty rad.

1825
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:59,000
Knights from Capcom, Nina from Breath of Fire, Viewtiful Joe, we miss him.

1826
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:00,000
That's what I'm saying.

1827
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:05,000
You get a fighting game that has these characters all together, and you release it on consoles.

1828
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
People buy the shit out of it.

1829
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Sadly, it is a comic, not a game.

1830
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,000
I understand that.

1831
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,000
I know, I'm just saying.

1832
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:13,000
It should be a game, right?

1833
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Why not?

1834
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Why not?

1835
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:18,000
It's way more interesting than any of the Sonic games that they've put out recently.

1836
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Well, they had that Sonic Mega Man crossover a while back.

1837
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:25,000
I mean, let's do something with that.

1838
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
I mean, come on.

1839
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:31,000
Alright, let's get into the Fugu Question of the Week.

1840
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Every week, we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities, and we read some

1841
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
of our favorite answers here on the show.

1842
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Alright, for tonight's Fugu Question of the Week, we asked you guys about this whole Guitar

1843
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Hero rock band situation.

1844
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:53,000
What do you think of the news?

1845
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Guitar Hero may be on its way back from a long sleep this year.

1846
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Do you think the revival of these plastic instrument franchises is a good thing, or

1847
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,000
are they better left in our memory?

1848
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:07,000
We had a few people answer over on Facebook, so let me read some of those answers here.

1849
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Fifth Dream saying,

1850
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:17,000
Well, that seems as good of a reason as any, right?

1851
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:18,000
It has been several years.

1852
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:22,000
If you think about it, you know, there's maybe like 20-year-olds that were only like 14 when

1853
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,000
this game was last running.

1854
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:24,000
I know.

1855
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
This is awesome that music games are coming back, Konami.

1856
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Ed S. replies and says,

1857
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Well, let's, I, we got to place a phone call and see if that's going to happen.

1858
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Let's hope so.

1859
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Let's hope so.

1860
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,000
I sure hope so.

1861
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,000
I'd love to go to that again.

1862
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:43,000
It was a great cause.

1863
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
Well, at the very least, they have new DLCs.

1864
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:46,000
I mean, that's something.

1865
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:47,000
That's something.

1866
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Andy R. saying,

1867
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:56,000
They do it in a way that doesn't kill the genre.

1868
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
DJ Rama S. says,

1869
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Ooh.

1870
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:13,000
I have a really, let me, remind me to tell you my crazy tinfoil hat thought after.

1871
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Okay.

1872
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Ursa being Slurpee said, but DJ Rama just totally made a spark go off in my head.

1873
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Ursa being Slurpee replied and said,

1874
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Well, that's, that's a really good way of looking at it.

1875
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:36,000
That's a great way to say I'm not a fan, but for those that are, have at it.

1876
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
Bryce H. says,

1877
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:39,000
I think it's great they're coming back.

1878
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:42,000
I can't tell you how many times I heard a new song on the radio and thought to myself,

1879
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
man, this would be fun to play on Guitar Hero or a rock band.

1880
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
So I'm super excited about this news.

1881
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,000
RageNator says,

1882
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Rene A. replied and said,

1883
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:06,000
I think this could be a good thing, but I'm hoping there will be more variety in the songs available from a variety of genres.

1884
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
And SHO and Hunter Matt on Facebook says,

1885
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:23,000
We're going to go over to Google Plus as well and check out the answers over there.

1886
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Although I think we just had a couple of answers because it's not quite as trafficked on Google Plus.

1887
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Regretfully for Google and Act Def saying on Google.

1888
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:37,000
As long as they don't oversaturate the market like they did last gen, I don't mind.

1889
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Of course, I'm probably going to give my support to Harmonix rather than Activision on this one.

1890
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:42,000
And lastly, Retertainment says,

1891
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:47,000
The reason the plastic music genre collapsed wasn't because of an oversaturation of games.

1892
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:51,000
It was because of an oversaturation of expensive, incompatible plastic instruments.

1893
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:56,000
If they can do something to address that, I'd love to see these games make a comeback.

1894
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
All right. I mentioned tinfoil hat. You ready?

1895
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:08,000
So there was a word in Rama's post, something that also has changed in the past six years or so since the last time we saw these games.

1896
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:14,000
That's not just social. Mobile. Mobile.

1897
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Now, thinking about the Jackbox games and even like SingStar, what do they allow you to do?

1898
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
Use your mobile phone as the controller.

1899
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
They don't sell SingStar microphones anymore.

1900
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Well, they might, but SingStar has an app on the iPhone that you use.

1901
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:32,000
It kind of works just for, you know, like a microphone and stuff.

1902
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:35,000
I'm not sure if that would be, I mean, that'd be cool for the microphone part.

1903
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
But wasn't there singing in Rock Band?

1904
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:38,000
There was.

1905
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:42,000
Wasn't part of the problem about all the harmony and everything? It was like, God, I don't have enough microphones.

1906
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Imagine if now your cellular phone can be a microphone and it'll be like, bang, one plastic instrument solved right there.

1907
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:53,000
So you don't even have to buy an instrument. If all you want to do is sing, you can just buy the base game and use your mobile phone.

1908
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
Assuming, of course, that you have a mobile phone.

1909
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:00,000
But it's safe to say that enough people do that they could probably get away with that.

1910
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Just throwing it out there. And then, I don't know what kind of instrument you could have on mobile. Maybe a...

1911
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Well, I'm not even worried about that so much because they've got...

1912
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:13,000
I don't know, like a frickin' mambo.

1913
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:16,000
It won't work very well, yeah, as far as like instruments on mobile.

1914
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,000
It really won't.

1915
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:27,000
So, I mean, I don't know. Any instruments on mobile, aside from singing, we're getting into Wii Music territory there.

1916
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
It's not where you want to go with that.

1917
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Oh, God. I wonder, I gotta ask if Bobby's still listening. Bobby, how would you feel if the entire drum kit was available on an iPad where you could just play with your fingers?

1918
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
Pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat.

1919
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Would that kind of, would that be something you'd be excited about? And I ask this to all the drummers out there.

1920
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:50,000
Would you be excited about that or would that make you kind of twitch? Like, no, please don't.

1921
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Because that's the only other thing I could see on mobile is pat, pat, pat drumming.

1922
02:04:54,000 --> 02:05:02,000
He's sitting pretty nice because he has a MIDI set and so all he has to do is just wait for them to, you know, put on an updated MIDI controller or that.

1923
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:07,000
But, you know, whereas I have console exclusive peripherals, that's not so good.

1924
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:16,000
There it is. Alright, some folks in chat wanting Accordion Hero, Weird Al Accordion Hero.

1925
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Give love for a Weird Al exclusive version. Like, give him, give Weird Al the Beatles treatment.

1926
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:29,000
BobbyBlackWolf in chat says, no. I can just imagine that little JPEG with Grumpy Cat, no.

1927
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:35,000
But then again, ReRave was kind of fun. So, trying to see the silver lining in my crazy tinfoil hat thought there.

1928
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Alright, there you go. There's the Fugu question of the week. Let's get back into some more news. Loki.

1929
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:46,000
With that kind of reminded me, is anyone still giving a shit about Fantasia?

1930
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Yeah, I think it came out and people didn't like it enough.

1931
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:54,000
I know, but that's it. It came out and that's the last I remember of it.

1932
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:57,000
Well, that's what usually happens with video games, Loki.

1933
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Is there like any DLC for it? I mean, are they supporting it? It's like kind of, you know, I don't know.

1934
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
It kind of just dropped off the face of you.

1935
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:08,000
I think I remember stories about DLC. I think there has been DLC for that game.

1936
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:15,000
It's just probably, you know, with the Xbox having distanced itself from Kinect,

1937
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:19,000
and the Kinect being very important to the experience of Fantasia,

1938
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:25,000
I think unfortunately, and we all knew this was going to happen, it kind of muted Fantasia's arrival a little bit.

1939
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
That doesn't make the game any worse.

1940
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:28,000
True.

1941
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:33,000
And Bobby BlackWolf saying, I enjoyed Fantasia and they released DLC songs and DLC remixes.

1942
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
So, they did extend that a little bit.

1943
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:36,000
Alright. There you go.

1944
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:41,000
Anyways, games with gold. So, for March, they got actually a pretty decent lineup.

1945
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:46,000
If you have an Xbox One, your game of the month is going to be Rayman Legends, which is pretty sweet.

1946
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:50,000
And iDARV, if you haven't picked that up already, so please do.

1947
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Also, up until the 15th for Xbox 360, you'll be able to download Tomb Raider.

1948
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:59,000
And then, starting on March 16th, Bioshock Infinite.

1949
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:02,000
So, I'd say overall, that's a pretty solid month.

1950
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
So, check those out.

1951
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Ironically, though, we're already in March and we still haven't heard of the lineup for PlayStation Plus.

1952
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:14,000
That's kind of a head scratcher right there.

1953
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Yeah, a little bit.

1954
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:18,000
So, I'm kind of curious to see what's going to go on there.

1955
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
What games are we getting?

1956
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Yeah, you've got to wonder if they're going to pull some big rabbit out of the hat.

1957
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Like, Drive Club! Fucking finally!

1958
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Or Knack.

1959
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:30,000
I mean, they're practically leaving that way already.

1960
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
I mean, I don't know.

1961
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:33,000
I could see that.

1962
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:36,000
Yeah, I was talking about this the other day with Flaco Jones.

1963
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Like, what could the games be?

1964
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:41,000
And I was kind of saying, you know, this is probably the month we finally get Knack.

1965
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:42,000
We all know it's coming.

1966
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Knack is going to be coming, yeah.

1967
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:45,000
It's a matter of time.

1968
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
I can't think of whatever, like, really...

1969
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:52,000
I don't know, unless we start getting into Angry Birds or something like that.

1970
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:55,000
You know, like, a really shitty PS4 game.

1971
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:58,000
Like, a game that had no business being on PlayStation 4 type of thing.

1972
02:07:58,000 --> 02:07:59,000
Yeah.

1973
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Drive Club at some point soon.

1974
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Maybe now's the time for Drive Club.

1975
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:09,000
Maybe. Maybe they just don't want to promise it until they're, like, absolutely sure those network issues are not going to fuck everything up.

1976
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Because, I mean, the retail release of that game got so screwed.

1977
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:16,000
But this is a chance to reboot it, in a way, you know?

1978
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
Get people excited about it. Who knows?

1979
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Yeah.

1980
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:24,000
Alright, well, I mentioned earlier in the show that this game is showing some really strong legs through its DLC.

1981
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:27,000
And that is Hyrule Warriors on the Wii U.

1982
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:32,000
I got to admit, you know, when it first came out, I was kind of like, eh, there's a lot of other games I want to play right now.

1983
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
This is kind of going to slip by.

1984
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:38,000
But the more and more stuff that keeps happening in this game, and the way they've really given this game legs...

1985
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Because I sort of thought Nintendo would kind of just let it go.

1986
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
But they really haven't. They've been supporting it.

1987
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
And here we go again.

1988
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Ganon got his own separate mode coming into the game.

1989
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:53,000
It's releasing March 12th in North America.

1990
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:59,000
And it's part of the season pass for the game, or you can get it by itself for $3.

1991
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
It's part of the Boss Pack DLC.

1992
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:08,000
But this is what's also awesome about it, is that apparently, in this pack, a giant chicken.

1993
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
It's Pojo all over again!

1994
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:14,000
The Quokko you can actually play in that game.

1995
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:18,000
There's a boss rush mode.

1996
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:21,000
So if you want to do that, you can do that.

1997
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:25,000
And then a free game update coming as well that will address load times.

1998
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:28,000
Raise the level cap to 255.

1999
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:34,000
And have the apothecary carry mixtures that cause the weak point gauge to deplete more quickly.

2000
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Increase attacks against giant bosses, and absorb magic from bosses.

2001
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:42,000
I've got to say, that game is really turning out to be a lot better than I thought it was going to be.

2002
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
I mean, I thought it was going to be okay.

2003
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:47,000
But actually, they're supporting it quite well.

2004
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Now you know Bobby's jumping in here with a jab at you, Loki.

2005
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:55,000
I thought Nintendo didn't understand modern gaming and were dying and can't be sustained.

2006
02:09:55,000 --> 02:10:01,000
Yeah, but this is Koei that's developing this game, not Nintendo.

2007
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Alright.

2008
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:09,000
That's a little bit different. They understand DLC in their games a little more than Nintendo.

2009
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Anyhow, you know what, I'm sure a lot of it too is to keep the Zelda hype going for Majora's Mask on 3DS.

2010
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:25,000
And then of course the big Zelda Wii U, which will be a definite head spinner this holiday season, I'm sure.

2011
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:31,000
Let's see, Dark Sakura was going to talk about this, but I guess I'm going to talk about it instead.

2012
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:36,000
It had to do a Mortal Kombat as well, which her class game of the week of course was Mortal Kombat.

2013
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:40,000
But as you know, Mortal Kombat X is on the way out.

2014
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Brutalities were revealed for the game. There's supposed to be a whole lot of them.

2015
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:49,000
And then another new trailer came out that shows some new characters, including Mileena.

2016
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
Yay, one of my favorites. I love Mileena.

2017
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:54,000
I think Mileena is supposed to be the main boss of the game now.

2018
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:55,000
Oh, interesting.

2019
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
Based on what the trailer was.

2020
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:58,000
That's the story trailer.

2021
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
Yeah, and I was like, there's a story?

2022
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Also revealed in the trailer, daughter of Jax, Jacqueline Briggs, son of Kenshi and Kung Jin, descendant of Kung Lao, Takashi Takeda.

2023
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Now I don't know if, I didn't catch if these characters were playable or if they are just part of the story.

2024
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:23,000
I guess they are. They are showing on a confirmed playable list.

2025
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:27,000
Jacqueline Briggs is there, Takashi Takeda and Kung Jin are all on that list.

2026
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
So I guess that is pretty cool. I guess they are playable, after all.

2027
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:33,000
So that's kind of cool. That's going to be a lot, a lot of characters in the game.

2028
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:36,000
The only one that's not on the playable list is Mileena.

2029
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:40,000
So maybe you're right in the whole, like, she's the big, big boss or something.

2030
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,000
So she's not in the playable list.

2031
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:44,000
It's kind of weird. You'd think they would be like some new person.

2032
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Yeah. So there you go. Some updates there with Mortal Kombat X.

2033
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:54,000
Which, although it may be a bit too violent for me, I'll probably have to check it out anyway.

2034
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
I think I'm going to end up buying it anyway. I have a week.

2035
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:59,000
I want to know what the bonus characters are going to be.

2036
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Is what I want to know. What are we looking at as DLC characters?

2037
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
Because that would be kind of interesting.

2038
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Can we get Deadpool?

2039
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:09,000
Maybe. Ash from Evil Dead is a lot of the rumors.

2040
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:10,000
I hope so.

2041
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:13,000
Or Jason would make a lot of sense after Freddy. Who knows?

2042
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
That would be pretty sweet. I don't know.

2043
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:21,000
Alright. So there was a Sonic 3D title that never came out.

2044
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:25,000
It was teased at E3 way back.

2045
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:34,000
But now, thanks to some fans of Sonic, they have made it possible to play said game because they've ported it over to PC.

2046
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:38,000
And this is Sonic Extreme. It was originally supposed to be a Saturn game.

2047
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:43,000
It never was finished, but now it's playable on PC.

2048
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:50,000
And it kind of reminds me of, like, Gex, but, you know, Sonic.

2049
02:12:50,000 --> 02:13:00,000
And it's really weird. I mean, even in the trailer that they had for the E3, the actual official trailer, and then the PC trailer, they have the rings there, but it doesn't look like he's collecting them.

2050
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
He's just, like, going right through them.

2051
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:05,000
Now he just swings from them, or he just kind of, you know...

2052
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
He just clips right through them.

2053
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
Because of reasons.

2054
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:13,000
I don't know. It looks okay, I guess.

2055
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:17,000
I don't know. It kind of looks like a lot of the Saturn games did back then.

2056
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Just very, you know, depth 3D type stuff in there, and not so...

2057
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Kind of like 3D platforming, I guess.

2058
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:31,000
But you can check that out, and I'm trying to see where you can find it.

2059
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
Hackers gonna hack, but in this case...

2060
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Or modders gonna mod, or whatever the case may be.

2061
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:40,000
But in this case, to allow us all to play a game that we may never have played otherwise, right?

2062
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:45,000
Yeah, you can check it out. The Sonic Retro forums had links to the game, so you can check that out there.

2063
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:51,000
Still better than probably the last Sonic game that they put out.

2064
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Still better than Sonic Boom.

2065
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:54,000
Still better than that.

2066
02:13:54,000 --> 02:14:02,000
At least his proportions look correct in this picture, as opposed to Lanky Legs Sonic there.

2067
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Alright, well, Disney is at work on a new game for the Wii U.

2068
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:15,000
A character artist and 3D artist shared images of a Disney project that she was working on for the Wii U.

2069
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
They're medieval fantasy characters.

2070
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:21,000
These characters were shown with permission by Carrie Mail.

2071
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
Actually showed off these images.

2072
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:26,000
We just don't really know exactly what it's all about.

2073
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:33,000
What this medieval fantasy game could be, because it doesn't tie into an existing Disney franchise.

2074
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Or at least it sure doesn't look like it.

2075
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:44,000
So, Disney is at work with something for the Wii U that's in a medieval fantasy setting that doesn't tie into one of their existing properties, it appears.

2076
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
Who knows?

2077
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,000
So, that's really all I got.

2078
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Tron medieval.

2079
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
Tron medieval.

2080
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:56,000
Remember, they said that there's a new Tron game coming out. What was it that one artist says?

2081
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:00,000
I will point out though, these drawings, they're nice. They're very good looking.

2082
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:03,000
But they're perfect for little figurines, don't you think?

2083
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:08,000
Do you think that's something that Disney might be double dipping in?

2084
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
A Disney Infinity RPG type thing.

2085
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:15,000
Oh no, why even be tied to Disney Infinity? A completely separate character collection game.

2086
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:19,000
At least Disney can print all the toys to me to hand.

2087
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:28,000
You know what, and to be fair, Disney actually, as far as from what I remember dealing with Activision and Disney,

2088
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:32,000
when you buy figures from Activision, they're all fucking randomly assorted.

2089
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:40,000
So, forget it. Oh, I'm out of X figure. Well, fuck you, you're gonna get random figures until you get whatever you want.

2090
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:44,000
Whereas Disney, it's like, oh hey, we need more Mickey. Okay, cool, we can order some more Mickey.

2091
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:50,000
You know, instead of, fuck you, you're gonna have to order some random assortments until you maybe get Mickey or not.

2092
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:53,000
Yeah, that's kind of Activision's take on the whole thing.

2093
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:57,000
I'm laughing because Dark Tetsuya is accusing me of baiting you. Maybe a little.

2094
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:01,000
Hitstun in chat says, EpicMickey3? Doesn't really...

2095
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:03,000
Nah, it doesn't look like anything Mickey.

2096
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:08,000
I mean, anything's possible, but it doesn't... I kind of feel like EpicMickey's kind of done for after the second game as well.

2097
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
Yeah, I don't think...

2098
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
Anything's possible, anything's possible.

2099
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Alright, anyhow, let's go to the mailbag because every week you guys send us emails and we take a moment to read them here on the program.

2100
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:38,000
participate at orange laundry calm is the place to send those emails and we will read our favorites here on the air we have two emails to read tonight obviously with our soccer not here somebody's got to fill in

2101
02:16:38,000 --> 02:17:07,000
so I volunteer as tribute first email tonight from entertainment who says howdy I'm curious as to why sky reacted so negatively the Loki's thought from last week that Nintendo would sell the amiibo trading cards in a blind pack sky's reaction struck me as weird given that it's already common practice for trading card companies to sell their cards in blind packs go down to your local place that sells trading cards assuming you can find such an establishment and you can find row after row of trading cards in blind packs from many different companies across many different media properties

2102
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:36,000
ranging from sports to TV shows to whatever the fuck Duck Dynasty is also well before we get to the second half of the email let me let me take a minute to respond to the first half here's the difference in my opinion with the trading card packs and those types of games you're talking about that's that's all of it that's the whole niche behind it like a game like Magic the Gathering that you know some cards are going to be rarer than others and that maintains the balance of the game right but with amiibo you want a

2103
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:56,000
certain character because that's the character you want to level in the game and I just I don't know I kind of feel like you know when you own the base game itself you can play pretty much any character you want granted there are a few unlocks but anybody can unlock those the same way so therefore there's not that same rarity level

2104
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:21,000
whereas if you have these blind packs then I worry you are going to have some of that rarity level and it would be imagine how frickin frustrating it would be to buy a blind pack and then get a card from Mario now not that Mario is a bad character or whatever but the Mario amiibo is not hard to find if you want Mario or link gee Nintendo doesn't seem to have a problem making enough of those to go around for the most part

2105
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:47,000
but do you see the difference there the rarity factor kind of comes into play I feel like in the trading cards you're talking about that's the entire game whereas these are enhancements to an existing game that's the difference to me I hope that makes sense I mean I just if I'm going to go out and buy one of these cards or whatever I want the one I want I'm not fucking gambling to get Ness who I want or something like that does that make sense

2106
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:50,000
Alright second half of the email from Entertainment

2107
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:39,000
fire emblem look it up also I I think I just I'm not okay with that whole like imbalance and rarity and now you're talking about kids too I don't know I don't know again when that is the game it's kind of a different thing but when it's a accessory to an existing game I think it's different I don't know

2108
02:19:39,000 --> 02:20:04,000
well they have been doesn't that's how they do with Disney infinity and I don't like it there either just to be clear and I haven't bought a one so I'm just just at least I'm consistent right so I don't like it there either in Disney infinity so alright moving on let's see going to the next email which I just closed the freaking meal bag this is why Jamie handles it people this is why I don't do it

2109
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:31,000
alright hello can I do this here while I put the email bag help me out here Loki alright well let's talk about how much I hate me both some more no I I just it's cool they're collectible figures but it's not what they're selling them as oh we're good alright anyway second email

2110
02:20:31,000 --> 02:21:00,000
from Martin from Belgium if I'm not mistaken who says hello olr hope y'all are doing well I had issues getting my gamepad to work with the game grow home it took 1.5 hours a bunch of driver reinstalls in a shady exe file but eventually it worked this kind of stuff makes me realize PC gaming is never going to be as mainstream as consoles are or some things will seriously need to change I've been a PC gamer for 16 years or so and it has been like this as long as I can remember nothing ever changed

2111
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:28,000
just works do you think the steam boxes are a viable solution to this problem of standardization let's stop and answer that question do you think the steam boxes are a viable method that standardization I think that's part of what they want to accomplish but remember there's not just one steam box there's many different steam boxes and if I'm not mistaken the way things were when we last heard of them they were a little on the pricey side too so I

2112
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:57,960
don't even know if they're still coming out with them yeah it seems odd we haven't heard anything about it in a while huh yeah I would think GDC a good time to hear about that um so I'm gonna actually say no but what's interesting is that some of these VR headsets we're hearing about coming out I think are an attempt to kind of standardize that even though everybody has their own well I think there is still some there is some standardization with you know gamepads now it seems like everything works with the Xbox 360 controller true and even with like

2113
02:21:57,960 --> 02:22:27,720
steam you know like big picture mode and stuff I think that they have stuff that kind of have some sort of broad controller support and I know with their steam controller that that's something that's going to eventually happen as well so maybe they're moving towards I think that's one of the things that with consoles you have a lot more restrictions as far as okay your game must be able to support these you know controllers a hundred percent and I guess more of it's like testing I think you know and how do you not

2114
02:22:27,760 --> 02:22:54,360
test your game like grow home or something with controllers and not have that work like right from the get go I don't know if this is like a new controller that you're using now or if this is something that worked on other games but for some reason this game is giving you shit it could very well be a bug in the very like in a version of the game because you know I had that with one of the was it I am bread or something like that is early access and they had some controller support issues so then they fix it

2115
02:22:54,360 --> 02:23:03,560
moving on with the email or is streaming gaming the future where the firepower is in the cloud and we play on any device connected to the internet

2116
02:23:03,560 --> 02:23:31,720
I once again you know even like the amiibos and other technology that they're really pushing you know for the use of I need to see a good example of what this means to me as far as like really good gameplay because you know how they had Titanfall I want to see what the difference was Titanfall without cloud support and Titanfall with cloud support I mean why it seemed like you know to me I didn't notice anything like whoa this is so much better than if it weren't always connected online

2117
02:23:31,720 --> 02:24:01,000
I sort of think lag is going to be an issue for a very very very long time until they can really you know minimalize that to you know such a negligible amount that games will still flow very easy I think streaming gaming will grow more and more and we're going to see more and more of it in the coming years but I don't see it 100% taking over because I just feel like there's always going to be that lag issue otherwise and some games won't work period

2118
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:30,920
some games will some games won't it's getting better but it's not 100% so my problem also too is like aside from like Titanfall you know some of these other games that have said oh we need the cloud for X and you know Y reasons like Sim City and then you find out oh no they really didn't need that that's just an excuse so that you could be connected online and like another form of DRM and that's like and then when you break trust like that like gamers are gonna think you're full of shit for years to come that takes a long time to erase you know

2119
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:50,200
yeah so anyhow also Martin continues saying I'm from Belgium boobies are not that big a deal here but they are still awesome I want to say we talked about this in last week's episode I don't remember what the frickin topic was but we mentioned how nudity is not a big deal in other countries but here it's like oh my god you can't show that on television

2120
02:24:50,200 --> 02:25:05,240
Martin also says we have amazing chocolate and I will send you some if you want I know the guys at giantbomb.com get mailed stuff from fans all the time and I think you guys deserve something as well well thank you very much what do they got that we don't got here at Orange Toms Radio

2121
02:25:05,240 --> 02:25:35,220
bomb money I appreciate that I appreciate well soon we'll have we'll have chocolate that'd be awesome access to packs yeah fuck you you are such a little shit alright you know what Bobby gets free reign tonight to just razz every little thing that comes out of your mouth alright Martin continues if you give me an address I will send you some but I understand

2122
02:25:35,220 --> 02:26:03,460
if you don't want to give your address to random strangers on the internet no problem I'm gonna email you Loki's address alright keep up I don't mind getting random things but then then here's here's my problem is that Nellie will be like somebody sent me chocolate the problem you just have to send boring chocolate if it's fancy chocolate if it's like milk chocolate oh she's in touch in that or white chocolate that might as well be like kryptonite she's like forget it

2123
02:26:04,460 --> 02:26:32,900
we'll get you an address off air Martin I really really appreciate that that's awesome s 200 Matt suggesting set up a vog p.o. box for all of the candy see like I'm like I'm actually thinking like okay maybe we should just get a little p.o. box like how expensive can it be like even actually vog network has an address but Bobby will get the chocolate if you send it there and I can't have that so I need the chocolate the vog West Office

2124
02:26:32,900 --> 02:27:02,620
yeah we need a we need a post office box from fog West or something I don't know actually I gotta say this there's been a lot of you guys out there very kind to offer like some folks like can I send you something can I send money which is always like wow like people would actually like pay us to do this stuff I've given thought to the whole like should we do a Kickstarter should we do a patreon type of thing but I have some reservations for one with Kickstarter

2125
02:27:02,620 --> 02:27:25,500
I don't ever want to give the perception that you need $30,000 to do a podcast because you don't if you have a desire to do it and you're willing to use some secondhand tools and maybe not sound optimal but work towards that as you progress with your new hobby I think you should be able to do that so I just I'm not comfortable with the idea of Kickstarter patreon

2126
02:27:25,500 --> 02:27:55,460
I'm iffy on it I understand some other shows do it and this is a decision shows have to make for themselves my only concern with something like patreon is a they get a slice of the money when whenever you do something like that and I think there's a lot of pressure in the patreon kind of community to like well if you're donated to this why aren't you donated me as well this as well and this and that but that like a lot of them like well if you donate to us and you get exclusive content and they

2127
02:27:55,500 --> 02:28:25,340
ever make exactly and I kind of want to just focus on this three-hour show that we're doing so that's why I'm kind of like I don't know how I feel about that and just the fact that you know we do this for fun and we do this you know because you guys show up and participate and send us emails and offer to send us chocolate and things like that like that's that's our motivation like don't get me wrong money would help because we do pay out-of-pocket like you know it does cost money to run the

2128
02:28:25,340 --> 02:28:53,460
VoG network server but you know what when all is said and done it's about as much money as it is if I were to go join a bowling league or you know something that would be fun for me to do once a week right you know everybody's got their hobby that they pay money for so you know I don't know we're thinking about we're thinking about it we'll see what we come up with in the coming weeks I'm hoping sooner rather than later we will have

2129
02:28:53,460 --> 02:29:23,420
merchandise available via VoG network.com I don't think I'm like ruining any surprises saying this I mean it's a very logical route to take where we'll have like t-shirts buttons stickers those sorts of things available where you know if you're a fan of the show you can buy those to not only support the show but then you're getting something in return and it's tangible and you have it and you know that's what you're getting and you can use it to help spread the word as we say at the end of every show so that's that's more the

2130
02:29:23,420 --> 02:29:50,500
idea that I would lean towards right now all right anyhow keep up the great show it's nice to be able to participate all the best and Martin from Belgium clarifying yes it is pronounced more or less like Martin although saying that to Jamie and sadly I'm not Jamie but I'm sure she's happy that you thought of her anyway there it is the mailbag participate at orange laundry.com if you would like to send us an email for a future week

2131
02:29:50,500 --> 02:30:01,340
let's get to the FUs of the week every week we get a little bit angsty on this show why well because I guess we have anger issues I don't know I don't know what to tell you

2132
02:30:01,340 --> 02:30:31,220
well if you want to start a few to restaurant store hours I I don't understand what it is about like all these really good restaurants or places that I want to eat at having limited hours on Sundays I mean

2133
02:30:31,220 --> 02:31:01,100
or even just being close I don't get it like I wanted to get we went to the place yesterday and they make fucking awesome cheese steaks and garlic fries they're literally the best garlic fries I've ever had and I can just eat a ton of them and I wanted to go there but they close at three fucking o'clock and I just can't make it over there in time to get food or Nippon which is a local teriyaki place they close at fucking four o'clock every day I can't

2134
02:31:01,100 --> 02:31:16,100
stop on my way home from work to get food because they're fucking closed they used to be open to eight o'clock but now they're closed at four for some damn reason and they're not open on Sunday so what the hell people come on people need to eat on Sundays as well

2135
02:31:16,100 --> 02:31:46,060
all right my a few of the week I'm gonna keep it pretty simple because there's been a lot of good stuff going on so I can't be upset but my a few of the week we go to crisis sees that show up crisis is that show up at four o'clock on a Friday afternoon that shit has to stop on a Friday afternoon I don't need everything burning down OMG WTF BBQ like that is when I'm slipping into weekend mode I don't want to deal with crisis at four o'clock on a Friday can we not have that happen anymore

2136
02:31:46,060 --> 02:32:15,900
thank you just a couple more news stories for you guys and then we're gonna open up the skype line for your calls 1877 game olr or username on skype orange lounge radio but first Loki so there's a brand new kickstarter for another franchise you may remember and coming from human nature studios toe jamming Earl back in the groove it's a brand new toe jamming Earl game with kind of this they're calling it a retro comic book style

2137
02:32:15,900 --> 02:32:42,580
yeah retro comic style I don't know they're looking for $400,000 and they were almost reached the halfway point already with 25 days left to go I gotta be honest I don't like the art so I think it's really fucking ugly but whatever it's kind of a cross between like a Saturday morning like

2138
02:32:43,580 --> 02:33:12,540
comic like a lot of the characters are all 2d but it's like in this 3d environment that really does clashes with everything else and that's just kind of my problem there but a toe jamming Earl so if you're a toe jamming Earl fan maybe you want to you know back that they're gonna have four player co-op it's gonna be on PC Windows Mac and Linux and they're looking at consoles as well one of the cool things about those are gonna lie to kind of chat with each

2139
02:33:12,540 --> 02:33:36,620
other so you can actually you know type messages whatever you want to each other as you're playing the game I don't know it's interesting I guess if you want to copy the game's gonna cost you 15 bucks and you also get your name in the credits hmm what do you think about a toe

2140
02:33:36,620 --> 02:34:06,580
jamming Earl reboot the iron was hot on that a long time ago it's his past a lot here's my problem okay and I understand this is probably early in development stuff but I gotta be honest that it just does not look good like I like like if you if you're gonna stick with it do either like the comic book style and leave like the rest alone or like you know do it all the same style or just don't do it at all cuz they like

2141
02:34:06,580 --> 02:34:25,220
they have all the sprites in our 2d but it's like 2d and like a 3d world so it looks really strange it looks like they're billboard it is what they call it I guess and it's not that doesn't look it looks really weird it looks like a cheap ripoff but but maybe if

2142
02:34:25,220 --> 02:34:36,260
whatever money they can make something that looks better you know see I I'm all for it I think a cartoon style like all done in that style without the you know kind of shaded background would look fine but

2143
02:34:36,820 --> 02:34:50,500
I don't know we'll see I hope it ends up working out because I know even though there's you know some well-known franchises that do kick stars and stuff sometimes they ran into problems and I would not like to see this be one of those

2144
02:34:50,500 --> 02:35:15,300
alright well our last story tonight has to do with a different type of video game and this is one I know I've talked about on OLR before but Alan and I play a game together that Google is kind of the head of one of their side companies Niantic Labs runs a game called Ingress and I noticed Google's been pushing Ingress more and more lately they have like YouTube commercials

2145
02:35:15,940 --> 02:35:44,980
it's actually like an AR game well sorta I don't know it's a game you play in the real world but it's so it's like GPS but like okay let me you know how there's a park not far from the house right without telling all the listeners where I live yeah that's pretty general there's a park not far from the house right okay so the sign that says welcome to that park is what is known as a portal and so if you're walking around on your iPhone or your Android device obviously because it's a

2146
02:35:45,020 --> 02:36:13,780
Google game that was on Android first and they brought it over to iOS if I'm in front of that sign or within about a good probably 25 meters from that sign so not a huge distance but close enough I can hack that portal and hacking that portal will give me items which I can then use to build on new portals or destroy portals because there's a player versus player element to this you have the blue team which is the team you don't want to play on the bad people I'm just kidding

2147
02:36:14,500 --> 02:36:34,060
there's gonna be resistance players listening who are gonna be like shut up and then the gold team no no it's blue and green actually so I play on the green side which is the enlightened there's this whole backstory behind it about how there's exotic matter out there and the enlightened want to use it to progress humanity and so forth but the resistance

2148
02:36:34,700 --> 02:37:03,220
so how do you hack these portals do you push a button that says hack yes you push a button that says hack but you can also hold the button down and then do a mini game called glyph hacking where you get shown different glyphs and you trace them and you get more stuff think okay you know how like foursquare was supposed to be a fucking game when it came out and it wasn't it's just like oh check into places this is an actual game and I see that judgey look you're giving me right now hold on I'll tell you what people get like really into this game

2149
02:37:03,220 --> 02:37:31,220
I can see that they people get really into this game and they there's these big events that they will have locally and so I've been able to go to one but they had a huge event here in Sacramento where people are kept coming up from LA and the Bay Area and it just happened to be on a weekend where I was traveling so I couldn't do it but they have these big events and so on you know it is a Google sponsored game but you know people get super into these games and it gets me up and moving Loki that's the important part

2150
02:37:31,220 --> 02:37:57,220
so like I will actually go down and walk to the park so when some Smurf that's what we call the blue players when some Smurf comes over and decides to stomp the park and be like fuck that shit I'm gonna walk over there and take my shit back so it gets me up and moving and walking so and now and the reason why I bring this up is because the creators of Ingress and Google are actually going to be incorporating this into that's right the Android Wear Watch

2151
02:37:57,220 --> 02:38:21,220
so the Android Watch will allow you to play Ingress so and they're showing some concept things about this where on the watch if you walk near a portal on the watch you could actually do the hacking of the portal and I'm assuming you could also do some of the attacking I don't that mobile interface is gonna be really weird to use and probably a little slow but the fact that you know you don't even need to whip your phone out you can be very subtle and hacking portals as you go by

2152
02:38:22,220 --> 02:38:27,220
that's pretty cool there and I know there'll be some local players who are really into that

2153
02:38:28,220 --> 02:38:39,220
did I mention by the way Loki you can do missions as well that's a new thing they put in the game so like because a lot of the portals are like historic landmarks or places of public interest so people will create missions

2154
02:38:40,220 --> 02:38:57,220
like one that I did in Seattle was around the Science Center where you know you go to the Space Needle and hack the Space Needle then you go to EMP and hack the EMP and so it like gets you exploring all these places to make sure you've seen everything there like that kind of thing so it's kind of cool I like it

2155
02:38:57,220 --> 02:39:06,220
okay don't judge me and soon I'll be able to do it from my watch if I were to get an Android watch although I'm not really planning on getting the watch

2156
02:39:07,220 --> 02:39:20,220
anyway act deft in our chat room says Smurfs and Green Giants actually they call us frogs well we call ourselves frogs and we call the people we call the people leveling we call people leveling tadpoles so there's that

2157
02:39:20,220 --> 02:39:34,220
Black Wolf in chat says I installed Ingress and joined the green team correct you made the correct choice Rama's also team enlightened Hitstun says oh shit we might need to go turn Boston green wow you all made good choices in the chat room

2158
02:39:34,220 --> 02:40:02,220
no I know there are olr listeners who are resistance who I'm sure who I am sure are fuming right now let's not forget though at the end of the day if there wasn't an opponent in the game there would be no game to play so get it and part of the reason we joined enlightened here inside well actually I just joined it because it was green but part of the reason we stick with it and don't flip is because green is like really the underdogs here in sac like blue really dominates this town like you go to Folsom

2159
02:40:02,220 --> 02:40:22,220
it's all fucking blue over there you go to Roseville it's all fucking blue over there and now and I actually kind of like being on the underdog team it's kind of fun so you know even though we never win actually we did win last cycle so it happens what okay go to what go to spot and push button

2160
02:40:22,220 --> 02:40:51,820
whoo you are in the back of the plan man whoo push the button trace the line whoo it's odd it sounds so amazing to some stupid shit too don't even fucking sit here judge my life choices Loki I just okay it's such a dick I just don't all right call in and tell Loki he's a dick one eight seven seven game olr or a username on Skype is orange

2161
02:40:51,820 --> 02:41:21,320
lounge radio if you want to give us a call we can talk about ingress or you talk about anything else we can talk about any of the other stories we've talked about on the show so far tonight or perhaps we missed something that you want to talk about we can do all that right now on our Skype line one eight seven seven game olr or username on Skype orange lounge radio that's all one word Loki I don't know if you have any last minute stories I was just gonna say that looks like they've decided to ban some of the costumes from

2162
02:41:21,820 --> 02:41:51,140
dead or alive five for fighting game tournaments because they're too risque would you have a call coming in so let's get to it hello you're on orange lounge radio who's this hey this act-def hey act-def how you doing hey pretty fun pretty fine despite the rain oh is it raining where you are yeah pretty that's pretty much all day it was supposed to rain here but it kind of didn't for whatever reason it's a little bit disappointing so hold on I'll show Loki something okay Loki see

2163
02:41:51,140 --> 02:42:19,140
there's my anger scanner and see right now some jerk Smurf drew a field over the house I didn't even talk about that you link portals together and the goals to draw triangles or field and the more population that you control in the field is basically like how the scoring works so some jerk Smurf drew a field right over the house so you can see we're sitting in a yucky pool of potty water right now which the blue there but over here this is some of the stuff that Alan and I did over here at the park we made a little green field cute huh

2164
02:42:21,140 --> 02:42:41,140
yes I'm not even getting paid by Google to pimp this shit see if I do this anymore we're not you know I wasn't to ingress once and I played it a bit a little but I can easily see Loki getting into it no really unfortunately you're wrong I can't get into because my phone

2165
02:42:41,140 --> 02:43:02,020
wouldn't probably it does murder your phone is a piece of shit I mean like a 2.3 genderbread so it yeah any phone can run it you know what Loki would probably sign up for ingress and he would do the exact same dick thing that Shane did and that is sign up for the blue team because he knows I'm

2166
02:43:02,020 --> 02:43:27,020
on he'd be like oh you told me that the blue guys are the winners in this town I'm signing up with them fuck y'all all right anyway sorry I didn't mean to derail but now I would not do that because that's it's no it's just I know I know all right anyway what did you want to talk about that well things to talk about

2167
02:43:27,020 --> 02:43:50,020
there's the amiibo thing there's also the there was another thing I wanted to talk about but but mostly the one of the forum threads you read about at the beginning of part B the Metacritic thing yes about the topic that Flacco had started about what game did you love that all the critics were like eh

2168
02:43:51,020 --> 02:44:16,020
yeah basically and it's not necessarily that I that I have some games that critics dashed and I love it's more like the general public that that they go for a score basically and and it's if it's not above 80 they'll pretty much dismiss it and it's really really sad especially

2169
02:44:16,020 --> 02:44:45,020
when sites go well when they rate their games from one to 10 no it's a 70 should be a good game not not even on decent level it should be a good game you know what I actually like I really agree with you on this and this is why you're actually seeing a lot of pushback on a lot of these review sites and now you have you know joystick before they closed came out and said we're not going to do scores anymore because we don't want to contribute to that kind of culture essentially I mean their their explanation was a lot longer but Eurogamer

2170
02:44:46,020 --> 02:45:02,020
which is historically been very harsh and a lot of their game reviews and and goes against the grain a lot of the times they have now removed scores from their reviews as well and so you see a lot of sites that kind of don't want to be associated with that Metacritic culture and that that number it's just a number at the end of the day right

2171
02:45:02,020 --> 02:45:31,020
um we have vog network we decided to go with letter grades because we felt it spoke a language where C meant average middle of the pack meant average right whereas what you're saying is is absolutely right why we didn't go with a number system at vog 5 out of 10 people aren't going to see that as average they're going to see it as bad so we wanted a system where the middle was average so that's why we ultimately went with letter grades over at vog network but then Metacritic for example I gave Pokemon shuffle which I reviewed this week at vog network

2172
02:45:32,020 --> 02:45:52,020
dot com I gave that a C minus I believe Metacritic would just turn that into a 70 for me you know what I mean yeah whereas I'm kind of like well wait a minute a C's really a 50 but because you know what I mean it's like it's not read that way so it's just it's weird

2173
02:45:52,020 --> 02:46:16,020
yeah it's definitely weird and especially speaking of Pokemon shuffle and and I gave a review of response for it I noticed that and I pretty much agreed on most of it but it's not a bad game it's it's it has its flaws and it's not definitely a great game to play but it's good it's a great pass time to pass the time

2174
02:46:17,020 --> 02:46:28,020
that's where I was kind of out with it is that I have my big time problems with it but you know what for the time that you can play it free it's a it's a cute little time waster so I kind of placed it near the middle of the pack because that's how I felt about it you know

2175
02:46:28,020 --> 02:46:57,020
yeah the grade that was given by you and by me also it's pretty much an average score so it's it's around the middle it's not that bad it's not great but it's decent definitely and there are a lot of games like that that they're not they're not bad I consider a bad game a game that it's not playable that it's difficult and you cannot progress basically

2176
02:46:58,020 --> 02:47:27,020
so I those are the things I consider for a bad game a really bad game yeah there are there are bad games in the sense that okay that it has its bugs it has things that pretty much do interfere with the game right by well I can give the example of like this is great unity that it can flood but the game was at least somewhat playable and it probably was good for the most of it

2177
02:47:29,020 --> 02:47:51,020
one other thing I wanted to say about Metacritic is that I notice a lot of like publishers tie bonuses to Metacritic scores we've heard about that happening in the industry and I think that's kind of I mean like exactly what you're talking about where it's like you know 80 is that hard line where it's like that could be the difference between you get a Christmas bonus and you don't get a Christmas bonus and that's so sketchy to me you know what I mean

2178
02:47:52,020 --> 02:48:06,020
yeah definitely it's it's definitely a big problem and with all the industry that yeah you have to pretty much do that to to progress and well you know

2179
02:48:07,020 --> 02:48:22,020
well any other thoughts on your mind before we let you go tonight another thought yeah amiibos are good what what drive well let me ask you quickly if you can summarize quickly what drives you to collect amiibos what are Loki and I missing from this amiibo craze

2180
02:48:23,020 --> 02:48:45,020
I could really try to explain it but I collect them because I like them they look great I even despite the not so great functionality they have outside Smash Brothers I still like to collect them they're pretty cool figurines but if you don't

2181
02:48:45,020 --> 02:49:14,020
well in my perspective I'm a big collector I have talked about my collection of like Pokemon my Final Fantasy stuff my music and all that stuff but that's because I am a collector if you're not a collector you probably won't get it so that's pretty much it I'm collecting because for the sake of collecting there are even people that don't take the amiibo out of the box they collect them they have all the 29

2182
02:49:15,020 --> 02:49:44,020
amiibo so far that have been released and all in the box they do not use them so yeah it's pretty much for the sake of collecting and I'm pretty much on that boat too fair enough fair enough well I'm gonna let you go act F because our phones are like lighting up on fire so I gotta get to another call but take care okay hey thanks for having me hey thank you take care we have a lot of calls coming in tonight so let me try to get to another one here right now hi you're an orange launch radio who's this I'm calling to defend myself

2183
02:49:45,020 --> 02:50:13,020
hi Shane welcome to the show where your ears burning no I heard you slander me what call what did I say in particular I mean I slander you a lot so what was it in particular that you took offense to that I joined the blue team on that dumb game because you joined the green first of all you know me and everybody else does it's blue that is what I'm gonna pick secondly it's just a bonus that it screws you over

2184
02:50:15,020 --> 02:50:44,020
you didn't even I a I might I point out I didn't even know that you downloaded ingress until I was driving by like one of the local portals one day and I was like wait a minute Shane a link goes on this portal is the enemy that little bastard pretty much where the game is crappy anyway like it is really dumb and not fun so so you're on you're on team Loki with that one oh yeah yeah totally that is just like a really stupid game

2185
02:50:46,020 --> 02:51:13,020
you're both wrong but that's every gamer has a voice even when they're wrong it's fine you know what and I'm not one to judge since I haven't played it but based on that plane I think it looks really dumb maybe it'd be more fun if when you did the hacking stuff you went beep boop bop beep that's the only way I could see it being more I will do that sometime or maybe if it worked with a Power Rangers toy or something oh yeah then I'd be all for it what if it was just called Power Ranger portal game I would play the crap out of it

2186
02:51:14,020 --> 02:51:42,020
you have very easy to like you know get my attention grabbed by something stupid and then that's all I'll focus on all right well there you have it you've defended yourself here on the show was there anything else that we've talked about that you wanted to that you took issue with I wasn't listening that much that I could comment on anything else or anything else that you talked about trying playing Final Fantasy right now too no I I wanted to give a shout out to that

2187
02:51:42,020 --> 02:52:11,020
crappy that's actually a good dating sim though that any person should play if they I guess have the money to buy it or just randomly download it at some point and find it on their computer like I did and what game is that that's coming out on top it's a dating sin that's kind of horny but come on if you have a computer you seem porn so it's not that big a deal and actually I think it kind of detracts from the game but it's really like funny and well written and it was written by a woman and it's all about

2188
02:52:12,020 --> 02:52:41,020
gay guys so that was interesting to me why and what what what kind of sets it apart from maybe other I don't know I don't know if you've played a lot of dating since I've never except I heard people kind of consider persona one but I don't see that me because I didn't date anybody in person before but I don't know it doesn't have pigeons or whatever so it's not like that other dating sin but I like that what is it about like it just has good gameplay or the story

2189
02:52:41,020 --> 02:53:10,020
I think the writing is just like point and click and choose this choice and manage your event calendar type thing I just thought it was pretty funny like I didn't know that those games would be funny they're like super serious and people would like I don't know fantasize about the characters and make pillows out of them or something maybe they do I don't know I think they do this game I think has a bit of a fan following I think it was all through a Kickstarter campaign

2190
02:53:11,020 --> 02:53:40,020
I want to say I remember when it was a Kickstarter campaign oh well I don't know I know it's getting DLC which is weird but mmm I people should play it if they have an interest in that sort of stuff I guess people want more of a variety and in what porny scenes they can end up in well that's that's the weird part of the game like I don't necessarily condone that part it's very awkwardly placed sometimes like oh you had a crush on this guy forever and he liked you too

2191
02:53:41,020 --> 02:54:08,020
now he's tied up to bed and you have to pick how you're gonna have sex with him it's like you could ride him or you could get inside him or you can you can get make him give you a blowjob or you can get okay Shane I think we've heard enough about this then you don't have to finish you can pick the other options you can choose to finish or go back to the other ones that you didn't pick yet and go through those ones too

2192
02:54:08,020 --> 02:54:23,020
oh my god all right well I've heard plenty enough about this game and I will certainly check it out because there's more it's like financing you can do bukkake you know what look at the time we gotta let you go and our phone lines are lighting up but have a good one Shane okay bye bye

2193
02:54:23,020 --> 02:54:52,780
alright he just he just wanted to dirty up the show all right well we got another person on the line so let's get to it like Rama says in the chatroom over at live.com well okay accurate right all right hi you're on orange launch radio who's this yeah what's up this guy you know hey guys you know what's on your mind not much first before I get into I just want to recommend to games for it to you yeah but before I get into that I just want to say that I'm also

2194
02:54:52,780 --> 02:55:22,700
an amiibo collector but I'm not because they look great I actually don't think they're a good-looking whatever you want to call them action figure toy whatever I have Kirby there's some little distortion in the back it looks like it kind of looks like you know when you were when you were a kid and you put the quarter into the machine you get those little eggs that you got to twist off and pop them open to get the prize that's what Kirby looks like is it really cheaply made you know everybody knows about how every character that has a sword the sword is all bent up and

2195
02:55:22,780 --> 02:55:52,700
screwed up and um a lot of them don't have a lot of really great detail in them that's why they're $12.99 you know but um I basically collect them because I play Smash Brothers and um I get a lot of fun out of my amiibo with Smash Brothers I don't know what they're gonna do later I'm not really into just putting my amiibo onto my controller just so I could get an outfit or something like that I think that's stupid but um as far as what they do for Smash Brothers it's a lot of fun and I'm hoping that when Mario Party comes out they're gonna do something similar to what they do with

2196
02:55:52,940 --> 02:56:22,620
Smash Brothers maybe not train them but I know one of the big uh one of the big problems for people with Mario Party is uh Mario Party was never online right I never played any of the Mario Party games but they're they're not online connected right I don't think so I gotta I'm not really having to rack my brain here and I think I think the main problem was you know it's a Mario Party so you know it's one of those games where you know it depends on a group of people playing and I think a lot of people since uh you know um they don't

2197
02:56:22,620 --> 02:56:47,100
have a lot of people over because you know not everyone's in the video games it's really hard to get uh you know your friends into video games um I think that's one of the main reasons why people kind of maybe didn't buy the game or kind of hesitated on buying the game just for the simple fact that they didn't have that party over at their house so maybe these amiibos are going to replace that and you actually have like uh some decent AI to play with when you play Mario Party

2198
02:56:47,100 --> 02:57:01,100
um I understood the amiibo is unlocked to seek a special mode in Mario Party that you can only get like if you have the amiibo so that's what people are I guess uh at least probably going to get that bundle that has Mario in it for so

2199
02:57:01,100 --> 02:57:31,020
in the gold mario there's a um there's a gold mario in mario golf so that's where the gold guy came from but anyway I wanted to recommend um I I can't believe I'm recommending this because I hate I don't really like app games I don't like the pay to play type games I don't like platformers this game has everything in it that I hate but for some reason I love it and that game is uh king of thieves I think it's only exclusive to the android devices right now okay but it's a lot of fun like it's uh it's a combination

2200
02:57:31,020 --> 02:58:00,620
of uh super meat boy meets uh you remember that game uh n plus you ever played that yeah yeah yeah it has a little bit of n plus in it's on tower defense it's really cool like you start out as like this little thief character and um you have to infiltrate uh dungeons to steal people's gold and the people's gold that you're stealing are actually real players who are also playing the game and they can also break into your dungeon and steal your gold that's when you have to set up your traps was what's really cool about the game is the fact that um

2201
02:58:01,020 --> 02:58:30,940
you can't just uh you know you would think that if somebody has to set up a trap they're gonna set up like this impossible trap for you to get through the game doesn't allow you to create that trap unless you're able to beat the dungeon yourself so you actually have to beat your dungeon two times in a row before you're able to save it and allow someone else to play it which I think is like one of the best features what's this called again uh king of thieves hmm it's a lot of fun it's made by the uh people that may cut the rope but it's totally different from cut the rope because I can't stand cut the rope um but yeah it's a totally different game

2202
02:58:31,100 --> 02:59:00,700
from that and I mean there's just there's so much more to it but I know you only have a little bit of time so I'm not gonna get into all that but but I will try again it is on iOS I just uh grabbed it yeah it is great man and you can you can start guilds like when you get to a certain level you can have like guilds and you can have your uh friends help you to steal your shit back when somebody rips you off because like you know a lot of people will start getting in your shit and like stealing everything and then you got to get it back from them it's a lot of fun second game is uh the town of Salem that's like a

2203
02:59:00,700 --> 02:59:06,220
web browser game and you're talking about um the resistance earlier that's like one of my favorite

2204
02:59:06,220 --> 02:59:12,780
card games and I love the werewolf card game yeah and um uh town of Salem is just like that it's

2205
02:59:12,780 --> 02:59:17,980
basically uh before we had werewolf werewolf is a game that's based off of another game called

2206
02:59:17,980 --> 02:59:24,540
mafia yeah I know mafia yep yeah so um the town of Salem is basically mafia like there's a mafia team

2207
02:59:24,540 --> 02:59:29,020
in the game I think there's actually a werewolf at some point in the game but I don't think I play

2208
02:59:29,020 --> 02:59:34,620
with the rules say that but um mafia and werewolf combined yeah yeah yeah it's mafia werewolf the

2209
02:59:34,620 --> 02:59:39,500
sailing were trials all that stuff combined into one game there's a serial killer in there it's

2210
02:59:39,500 --> 02:59:43,580
just a lot of fun it's like you know one of those social production games you just have to find out

2211
02:59:43,580 --> 02:59:47,900
who's going around killing everyone and you know you get your special role like uh there's a spy

2212
02:59:47,900 --> 02:59:54,220
role a detective role uh doctor role it's just a lot of fun it's a simple web browser game

2213
02:59:54,860 --> 02:59:58,860
and uh you I think I think the longest I ever played was like 15 minutes so it's not one of

2214
02:59:58,860 --> 03:00:05,580
those games that you really have to invest a lot of time in and you know just uh a lot of fun too

2215
03:00:05,580 --> 03:00:11,740
two fun games and they're completely free uh I will say uh the resistance is a lot of fun but uh

2216
03:00:11,740 --> 03:00:15,500
since you've played it a lot uh what's your strategy when you're a spy how do you how do

2217
03:00:15,500 --> 03:00:20,860
you throw people off your trail oh I just uh pretty much what I try to do I try to uh

2218
03:00:20,940 --> 03:00:26,620
do all my damage when I'm the the team captain you know I try to go for that and then I then I

2219
03:00:26,620 --> 03:00:31,260
start to try to put you know like you don't you don't put your spy mates on the team right away

2220
03:00:31,260 --> 03:00:35,420
like the the first mission that you do like when have you ever become the team leader

2221
03:00:35,420 --> 03:00:39,980
you send all the good people on the mission yeah let them succeed and then they're gonna trust you

2222
03:00:39,980 --> 03:00:45,100
and then by the next time you get around or if they get around to somebody else on your team

2223
03:00:45,100 --> 03:00:48,220
that person will like select you and you know they'll trust you more and they'll put you on

2224
03:00:48,220 --> 03:00:53,100
the team and that's when you can sabotage stuff you know how I won the first game is I got put

2225
03:00:53,100 --> 03:00:58,460
on the very first mission and I let it succeed and I got put on the second mission as well because of

2226
03:00:58,460 --> 03:01:03,740
that and I let that succeed as well and I could see the other spy was looking at me going like

2227
03:01:03,740 --> 03:01:09,020
you just gave them two and they only need three to win and I was like you know I got this I got this

2228
03:01:09,020 --> 03:01:12,460
sure enough they put me on every single other mission in the game and I failed them all

2229
03:01:12,460 --> 03:01:21,180
yeah yeah that was a lot of fun thank you it's also uh you mentioned werewolf but uh um to me

2230
03:01:21,180 --> 03:01:26,300
it's more of like a streamlined uh version of uh the battle star galactic game you gotta try that

2231
03:01:26,300 --> 03:01:31,180
I mean that's a heavy duty board game but um if you ever meet anyone that has that game you gotta

2232
03:01:31,180 --> 03:01:36,780
try but I mean it it literally takes like two hours to finish that game but um time yeah just

2233
03:01:36,780 --> 03:01:41,180
fun stuff all right board games are fun try them they are fun guys you know I'm gonna let you go

i hope you guys going to gdc have a fantastic time that is also this week as well uh so i'm

2264
03:04:07,820 --> 03:04:11,900
sure there's going to be lots of news to talk about in two weeks we are back on march 15th

2265
03:04:11,900 --> 03:04:15,340
time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts uh dark soccer has already left we

2266
03:04:15,340 --> 03:04:18,460
talked to her earlier loki it's your turn what's your final thought for the night

2267
03:04:18,460 --> 03:04:25,100
uh we're more of a game this week um i know last week i meant to get some levels done but my i've

2268
03:04:25,100 --> 03:04:30,860
been mainly working on because one of the things i hated was that um the curves are hard to get up

2269
03:04:30,860 --> 03:04:35,180
on a game because the car is really small um so i've been putting these what i'm calling

2270
03:04:35,180 --> 03:04:39,740
curb ramps in the game so now everything all the curves are kind of have a 45 degree slope on it

2271
03:04:39,740 --> 03:04:44,460
so you just you just drive right into them and it goes it makes it a lot more fun so that's what

2272
03:04:44,460 --> 03:04:48,940
i've been working on i'm just about done with it i have them all in the game except that the model

2273
03:04:48,940 --> 03:04:54,860
two more that are for some really like um unique pieces and then and then i had to figure out what

2274
03:04:54,860 --> 03:04:58,700
level two is going to be i i've been trying to come up with some ideas but i have a bunch of

2275
03:04:58,700 --> 03:05:05,260
ideas that aren't good for level two but later on it's just i had to get the right one that's the

2276
03:05:05,260 --> 03:05:11,980
least amount of crazy before i get into the crazy stuff so um it's just hard picking one that's

2277
03:05:11,980 --> 03:05:18,300
simple enough for the first real stage that you play all right and my final thought for the night

2278
03:05:18,300 --> 03:05:22,620
is uh sj100 matt reminded me of this so i'll say this is my final thought there is a packs east

2279
03:05:22,620 --> 03:05:27,420
thread on our forums uh so if you want to uh try to meet up with us uh post in the thread and that

2280
03:05:27,420 --> 03:05:33,580
