0	17080	This week, although the Smash Bros. series amiibos are not yet complete, Mario is getting
17080	19680	friendlier with a classic design, releasing imminently.
19680	22680	The collectibles keep coming along with this week in gaming news, and it all begins along
22680	29960	with your comments and more, right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
29960	34840	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
34840	36520	where every gamer has a voice.
36520	45120	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with our 592nd episode for March the 29th of 2015.
45120	48920	Here with you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the
48920	52080	gamer lifestyle, style, style, style, style.
52080	58440	Here with me, Rob Roberts, and over there taunting me already, Wob Wobbits, a serious
58440	63840	interview with Wob Wobbits and DarkSakura.
63840	65680	How are you, Ms. Jamie Summers, or DarkSakura?
65680	66680	I have a sinus infection.
66680	67680	Do you?
67680	68680	I'm sorry to hear that.
68680	69900	You know what, I blame Alabama.
69900	71640	As long as you're not contagious?
71640	76480	You can't get sinus infections unless you dig your finger up my nose and pull some bacteria
76480	77480	and eat it.
77480	80140	And even then, highly unlikely.
80140	81140	Don't test me.
81140	82140	Ew!
82140	83140	I'm going home, bye.
83140	87200	I'll do a lot on a dare, no I'm kidding.
87200	90720	I thought it was funny because earlier this week you gave me a call and you were like,
90720	94800	Wob Wobbits, I don't know why you're Barbara Walters all of a sudden, Wob Wobbits, what
94800	98640	was the condition that Alan had when he got sick?
98640	105000	I started to feel like scratchy and sore on like Tuesday, but usually that's how my sinus
105000	106000	infection hit.
106000	108200	Every time I come back from Alabama, sinus infection.
108200	109200	There it is.
109200	110200	And I didn't even think about it.
110200	113520	I thought, oh, Alan was sick maybe, but that was like a week and a half.
113520	116000	Something about traveling to Alabama just makes you sick.
116000	117000	I don't know.
117000	121880	I don't know what it is.
121880	122880	The humidity.
122880	123880	The humidity.
123880	124880	That's it.
124880	125880	Magnolias, camellias, azaleas.
125880	126880	All right.
126880	130400	Also, here in studio, of course, as he is every week, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
130400	131400	Hi.
131400	132400	How are you, Loki?
132400	133400	I'm fine.
133400	136960	Now, Loki said earlier, I just want to quote for you guys, that he may have had too much
136960	137960	bacon.
137960	143880	No, I said there may have been too much bacon on the pizza because it was too salty.
143880	144880	I didn't have a...
144880	146680	See, the problem was...
146680	150400	How appropriate for you that it's a little too salty here on O.L.R.
150400	151400	Here is my dilemma.
151400	152400	Okay.
152400	156360	The gas station I went to is one of those grocery store gas stations.
156360	158920	They only had a fucking 16 ounce Red Bull.
158920	164120	That is not enough Red Bull for me to, you know, first off, be awake right now, and second
164120	166480	to have with that pizza.
166480	170560	So, you know, I have to make sure my sodium intake is good.
170560	171560	Be careful with those energy drinks.
171560	172560	I know.
172560	173560	Be careful with those energy drinks.
174240	175240	I have one a day.
175240	176240	I mean...
176240	179240	I guess so did my husband, and he ended up in the hospital for...
179240	180240	Most days I have one a day.
180240	181240	His heart.
181240	182240	So be careful.
182240	183240	Be careful.
183240	185240	It's just a little bit of caffeine.
185240	186240	All right.
186240	187240	Along with salt.
187240	189480	Make sure you get in your exercise.
189480	190480	Work out with the kids.
190480	191480	All right.
191480	196240	Of course, we are here in studio, but you guys are out there in the internet.
196240	201240	Hello everybody who is listening live to us at the Voice of Geeks Network, vog.network.com,
201240	205200	where we do tape our show live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern
205200	207560	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
207560	210740	And Bobby Black Wolf is actually live in our chat room there along with some of the other
210740	212740	folks saying...
212740	215800	Starting us off tonight, Bobby says, I'm hunting Wob Wobbits.
215800	218880	So a little bit of Elmer Fudd there, action.
218880	219880	How wonderful.
219880	225640	Anyhow, of course, if you are listening on the podcast, a big hello to you as well.
225640	228980	If for whatever reason it's your very first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, we've
228980	230840	been doing this for a while.
230840	237340	We started this show back in June of 2002, myself, Dark Sakura, and Loki all met playing
237340	241760	Dance Dance Revolution at a local arcade here, Sun Splash.
241760	245400	And we wanted to make a show about the little community that we were building because it
245400	248800	was like Wednesday night worship, Wednesday night.
248800	251040	And I'm not talking about like false idols or anything like that, but it's just what
251040	252040	it was.
252040	253080	Wednesday nights, we all got together.
253080	256760	We would go to play DDR and we just stand around the machine like it was some cult with
256760	257880	a little flashing lights.
257880	258880	Play me.
258880	259880	Give me a dollar.
259920	261600	Give me a cute Eurobeat.
261600	263440	So that was, that was us.
263440	269480	And after we played DDR, we'd go to the diner right across the street and then we'd talk
269480	270480	a little bit of smack.
270480	272000	It was the old people diner on top of that.
272000	273000	That's right.
273000	274000	It was.
274000	278460	And we talk a little smack and good things and bad things about our favorite pastime.
278460	283920	And so we've extended that into the internet and with you guys at the world's largest dinner
283920	285720	table, diner table here.
285720	289480	Anyway, we have some very special guests here in studio.
289480	291680	And I'm so excited to welcome these guys to the show.
291680	296600	Speaking of Malwij, as I see talking about in our chat room, Wuv Twuwuv says a game guru
296600	298880	in our chat.
298880	302320	We met up a few weeks ago and it was literally one of those moments of where have you been
302320	303320	all my life?
303320	307960	And now here we are joining forces for you gamers out there.
307960	312680	I'm so excited to welcome from the Sacramento IGDA chapter tonight.
312680	314760	We have two representatives here in studio.
314760	318480	Say hello everybody to Gabriel.
318480	321000	And go ahead and pick up the mic there and say hello.
321000	322000	And Brianna.
322000	323000	Hi.
323000	324000	Hi.
324000	325000	How are you?
325000	326000	Ladies first.
326000	327000	Ladies first.
327000	328000	I'm great.
328000	329000	And I'm so happy to be here.
329000	332680	And oh boy, I can't believe you had me in here.
332680	335080	Wait, what does that mean?
335080	336080	Wait a minute.
336080	337800	Does that mean she's a loose cannon?
337800	338800	I don't know.
338800	339800	I can't confirm or deny that.
339800	340800	Sorry.
340800	342280	How are you doing Gabriel?
342280	343280	Never better.
343280	344280	We're here.
344280	347440	This is like I'm five minutes from home and it's like I'm in a whole other world right
347440	348440	now.
348440	349440	Beautiful.
349440	352960	You were mentioning that beforehand that when I gave you the address to our top secret location
352960	357000	where we tape in the Sacramento area, you found out that's five minutes from my house.
357000	358000	Yes.
358000	359000	You've been doing that crap for years.
359000	360000	Seriously.
360000	361360	I've been here three years and only now.
361360	362360	Only now.
362360	363360	And like, yeah.
363360	364360	Yeah.
364360	365360	Seriously.
365360	366360	Way too long to have connected.
366360	367360	Well, you know what?
367360	369960	It goes both ways because now I'm realizing, holy crap, somebody's developing a Wii U game
369960	371280	five minutes from my house.
371280	372280	Damn straight.
372280	375320	Tell us a little bit about your company Gabriel.
375320	379000	You actually have like a little startup indie company and you're making games as well.
379000	380000	Tell us a little bit about that.
380000	381000	Yeah.
381000	391000	So we've got, so the idea behind Nascent Games was, I needed a definition for the studio.
391000	395080	You know, like where were we, what were the games that we're making going to do?
395080	397720	What were we trying to achieve with our games?
397720	404040	And the idea was we wanted to, I hate to say the phrase take it to the next level because
404040	407520	it's so cliche, it's so overused and I try not to do that.
407520	412360	So I tried to approach it a little differently just, you know, for me it was leave a good
412360	415360	experience for every player that tries our stuff.
415360	422480	Whether it's the player by definition of actually physically playing the game or by actually
422480	426800	watching the game and saying, ooh, I want to see what happens next.
426800	433200	So you know, so for me it was all about, you know, that ascent of the experience.
433200	437040	You know, ascending and wanting to find out more, take it higher.
437040	441080	So just without getting all cliche about it all.
441080	446000	You know what, sometimes the answer is a little simpler than some might think.
446000	447000	You know what I mean?
447000	450780	Like some people want to know, where did the name Orange Lounge Radio come from?
450780	454320	Because Orange Lounge was on a DDR machine and we thought like, you know, oh, we're all
454320	456320	sitting, we're lounging around talking about games.
456320	457320	It's a great name.
457320	459240	So it's really that simple, people.
459240	461240	That's all right.
461240	466360	Also in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com we have Blakeman, who actually renamed his
466360	467360	nickname there.
467360	468360	Wow.
468360	471520	Blakeman in our chat room says, excuse my ignorance, but what does IGDA mean?
471520	474320	That is the International Game Developers Association, right?
474320	475320	I should have said that, right?
475320	476320	Yes, that's quite okay.
476320	480280	Yeah, International Game Developers Association and what that is, they're a worldwide non-profit
480280	481280	organization.
481280	486600	They represent, I mean, all the countries possible, I mean, especially here.
486600	496380	And it's a connection of game developers and gamers who just want to get involved more
496380	500800	in the community, in the industry.
500800	506680	And without, you know, without the, what's the best way to put this?
506680	510000	I mean, I think it's just really, it's just a huge resource.
510000	518200	IGDA is just a massive resource for people to learn more about how they can become, you
518200	522760	know, how they can put their talents to use, or learn to put talents to use, or even just
522760	523760	learn a talent.
523760	529320	You know, just from the idea guy, which is me, to the programmer who can't draw.
529320	533520	They want to find somebody, you know, who does art.
533520	539100	Or the community outreach folks who want to bring folks together to do more.
539100	544860	You know, to do more and, you know, really for the love of it all.
544860	547680	I kind of hashtagged for the love of the game quite a bit.
547680	549540	And there's kind of a core reason behind that.
549540	550740	We maybe get to that later.
550740	552820	But yeah, I mean, it's really for that.
552820	553820	It's for the love of the game.
553820	555900	And then hopefully we make a few bucks out of it.
555900	560100	But otherwise, otherwise, yeah, we just, we love what we do.
560100	563980	I think, you know, a lot of people out there, I would think not so much the listeners to
563980	564980	this show.
564980	568420	But you go on Twitter, you go on any message forum, and you see sometimes a lot, and there's
568420	575340	a running joke here on OLR about GamersHateEverything.com, right, where, you know, where anything is
575340	578660	announced and there's always like instant snark that goes with that, right?
578660	579980	And we try to be...
579980	582700	Are you talking about someone in particular?
582700	585020	There is no salty individual I can think of.
585020	588340	But, you know, all joking aside, I mean, we have fun with it.
588340	591660	And there are some games sometimes that for whatever reason don't turn out as well as
591660	592660	they could be.
592660	596860	And usually that reason is middle management, but we won't go there.
596860	601740	But I think some people don't really realize what goes into making a game.
601740	606020	There's so much that goes into making a game, even a tiny little indie game, there's a lot
606020	607020	that goes with it, right?
607020	610900	So when you talk about resource sharing, I mean, we've even had, you know, Loki and he's
610900	613820	been talking about some of the various projects he's been working on for a long time here
613820	614900	on the show.
614900	616860	Maybe he needs to sign up for your organization, I don't know.
616860	620820	He really should, because I'm looking at what he's doing right now and then I didn't realize
620820	621820	you were...
621820	625500	You're seeing something like nobody else is getting to see, by the way, that whole, his
625500	629020	mysterious VoG Jam game that ended in January.
629020	630020	Yeah.
630020	631020	Make it happen, man.
631020	632020	We're right here.
632020	633020	So...
633020	635060	Just wasn't on time, unfortunately.
635060	639460	Bobby is taking so much pleasure right now in the fact that Loki is being lectured by
639460	641460	the IGDA here in the studio.
641460	648660	Listen, if it's okay, if Zelda can be delayed, then I can delay my game.
648660	649660	It's perfectly fine.
649660	651660	I mean, I don't want to compare it to it.
651660	654020	Is this the agony in the SSC featuring Loki?
654020	656660	I'm not going to be the one that's going to make those comparisons, but I mean, if
656660	657660	you want to draw those, that's fine.
657660	658660	When will it be finished?
658660	659660	When it's finished.
659660	660660	Okay.
660660	666060	But all this joking about deadlines aside, you have talked about how finding music for
666060	671860	your game was like your big issue, and it took you a while to find that right resource,
671860	672860	right?
672860	673860	Yes.
673860	681500	Just listening to everything that's CC by 3.0 or whatever on SoundCloud and browsing
681500	682540	by genres.
682540	686580	You know what, you and I could have just connected much sooner because I actually make
686580	689620	my own music for my games.
689620	695100	So yeah, double whammy, man.
695100	697580	The music he did end up finding is actually really awesome.
697580	698580	Oh, good.
698580	702060	And if by awesome you mean really annoying because it was on purpose that I picked a
702060	704620	really annoying dubstep song for the game.
704620	705620	All right.
705620	707340	Anyway, this isn't about you, Loki.
707340	710860	This is about our guests here in the studio this week.
710900	714460	And I do want to talk to Brianna in a minute as well, but since Gabriel, you have the mic
714460	719540	right now, I want to talk about specifically the game that you're working on here.
719540	722960	Because I know there's a lot of people, it's no secret right now, we've talked about on
722960	726780	previous episodes of the show, we're going to be doing this event where we're live streaming
726780	728940	on April 11th and y'all can check it out.
728940	734380	It's the Sacramento in the Arcade event, which is presented by you guys in April 11th from
734380	735540	10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
735540	737780	You can tune in at vognetwork.com.
737780	742500	Or if you're like that 3% of our listener base that lives in Sacramento, or even the
742500	746900	Bay Area, heck, come on out to the show, check it out, we'll be there live in person.
746900	750320	But I'm sure there's a lot of people out there that might, you know, because we have listeners
750320	757220	in Mexico, we have listeners in Australia, Japan, Sweden, whatever happened to that man?
757220	762500	I see him on Tumblr, but anyway, they might be wondering, why do I care about some event
762500	764820	happening in Sacramento?
765820	770820	But you guys are making games that everybody's going to play, right?
770820	771820	Yes sir.
771820	772820	That's the high goal.
772820	777580	Well, it's more, it goes, see that's on the surface, yes, but it goes beyond that.
777580	785740	For me, you know, there's a parallel going on with my startup as Nascent Games and, you
785740	791780	know, founding that and then being the founder and chair for the chapter for IG Day Sacramento.
791780	798340	For me, it was when I started my games, you know, even just having the confidence to say
798340	800420	I'm going to make a game.
800420	804680	Because that's the first biggest step, it's just having the confidence to make it.
804680	810820	But then it became, becomes a thing of who else is out there that's struggling for that
810820	811820	direction?
811820	817260	And, you know, long story short, you know, it's, we are now, we are now in a position
817260	823300	where my main goal, one of my biggest goals for this chapter is happening now.
823300	827740	We are creating talent here in Sacramento.
827740	831300	We are not outsourcing it anywhere, you know, unless we really, really need to, because
831300	834240	I mean, you know, times are tough, you know, we just sometimes we need to.
834240	839560	But there's so much talent here in Sacramento and so much of this talent have been very
839560	844260	hesitant, you know, because they don't know where to go, they don't know who to connect
844260	850020	with, they don't know who to talk to, or they have connected with people and they have
850020	854820	lost, you know, they have been screwed over, you know, their trust has been tainted.
854820	856340	And they're like, what do we do now?
856340	860580	And you mentioned, you know, briefly mentioned the Bay Area, a lot of them, how many people
860580	866140	we've met from LA, from the Bay, they were from here, but they left Sacramento because
866140	869500	they wanted, you know, they wanted something better and they ended up in some way, shape
869500	870820	or form got screwed over.
870820	871920	So now they're back.
871920	876900	And now, so now it's not just games that everyone's going to be able to play.
876900	880460	It's the games are being made by Sacramento folks.
880460	886100	And now, you know, the person trying these games is not going to be just a commenter
886100	892420	on an app, you know, it's going to be in your face, like, this is what I think, you know,
892420	894580	or, you know, and so on and so forth.
894580	899460	And there's that in your face interaction, how old school yet how new it seems today
899460	900460	in 2015.
901100	902100	Yeah.
902100	904740	Oh, my gosh.
904740	906260	So much I can ask you guys about.
906260	909260	It's only a three hour show, however.
909260	913420	But let me let me just guys seriously don't even we met up for dinner a couple weeks ago.
913420	914420	We could have been there all night.
914420	918700	But anyway, let me ask you about this specifically the game you're working on.
918700	923000	You're working on a game with your with nascent games, you are creating a game.
923000	926780	You just had a big demo go out to DeSoura, right?
926780	929540	And this is something that people should be keeping their eye on is going to come to the
929620	930620	Wii U eventually, right?
930620	931620	Yes, they will.
931620	932620	Tell us a little bit about Crumple.
932620	940260	So Crumple, our very, very first game demo ever on anything, just which was extremely
940260	946460	unexpected, like we I really didn't like we in the back of our head, we thought, yeah,
946460	947460	we can make it happen.
947460	950820	But you didn't you don't really believe completely it's going to actually happen.
950820	952100	But now it has.
952100	956700	And I've been very, very fortunate to connect with the right people, you know, just taking
956700	958620	that initiative to connect with folks.
958620	962580	And now we're at this place, our demos out there on DeSoura.
962580	967540	We are at a probably around two thousand two thousand two thousand visits and tries for
967540	970340	just the demo in a week.
970340	973580	And that's insane because I don't know who the hell they are.
973580	974580	I don't know who they are.
974580	979260	I mean, and I know I know we have, you know, I think I think five different countries.
979260	986060	I mean, I've seen people trying our game from Ukraine, Italy, Germany, Finland.
986060	987620	I don't know who these people are.
987620	993140	You know, you and I have the exact same reactions, but for you it's a game, for me it's a podcast.
993140	994140	It's the same thing.
994140	999340	You sit there and you go, somebody in Belgium's listening to my show and sending me an email.
999340	1000340	That's so cool.
1000340	1001340	Yeah, it's insane.
1001340	1006020	And the and the and the reviews have been we've actually we actually got our first review
1006020	1007020	from some person.
1007020	1009660	I have no idea who they are, but they reviewed our game.
1009660	1011680	They're very, very in-depth with it.
1011680	1016420	The commentary, you know, especially from my own dear Brianna as well.
1016420	1019780	She left some fantastic commentary, especially the Twitter was nuts that day.
1019780	1022220	But anyway, so Crumple, back to Crumple.
1022220	1027260	So Crumple is, yes, it is going to be out for PC first, then for the Wii U.
1027260	1031220	Crumple is about this little envelope that comes to life and it wakes up in this burning
1031220	1032220	paper factory.
1032220	1035380	I kind of wanted to go with the similar approach of Limbo, you know, where this little boy
1035380	1037140	wakes up in Limbo.
1037140	1040740	We have no idea how the hell it got there, but, you know, it just has to keep going.
1040740	1045080	So I kind of wanted to approach it that way with with Crumple.
1045080	1049480	But obviously, you know, it's not it's not in like the first circle of hell or anything
1049480	1050480	like that.
1050480	1051980	You know, it's just it's just in the burning paper factory.
1051980	1054900	Just wanted to keep it simple and then proceed from there.
1054900	1057080	The game is going to be released in episodes.
1057080	1063580	So the first full episode for Crumple should hopefully be out sometime in May and then
1063580	1068980	episode two and three, hopefully about three or four months apart from each one.
1069000	1074340	And then the idea will be, once we get all those episodes out, get it ported over to
1074340	1075340	the Wii U.
1075340	1079420	I would need to find a new programmer for it, though, because Wii U doesn't play Flash
1079420	1080420	games.
1080420	1083700	So I have to use either HTML5 or JavaScript, but anyway, technical stuff.
1083700	1086740	So now I'm sorry.
1086740	1089620	So our other game tripping my own my own partner.
1089620	1094400	So our other game is Kinship and Kinship was actually the first game we started on.
1094400	1097580	But it is admittedly a bit of an ambitious game.
1097580	1098580	But that's what I want.
1098580	1102260	I like, you know, you need that ambition, but then you need your simple stuff.
1102260	1108420	So Kinship is essentially an action story implemented shmup.
1108420	1112620	And you know, shmups are, you know, a dime a dozen, one of the oldest genres out there
1112620	1113620	in video gaming.
1113620	1118340	But very few of them have ever implemented any sort of story, let alone any sort of decent
1118340	1119340	story.
1119340	1121340	And I said, you know what?
1121340	1130060	I want to take the things I loved about Gradius 3, Axlae, R-Type, games like that, but have
1130060	1136060	some sort of deeper-ish, not Mass Effect deeper-ish, but I mean, you know, just deeper narrative
1136060	1141940	to it where, as I mentioned before, where people were maybe like Brianna, who may not
1141940	1148180	be into shmups, can just watch it and be like, wow, that's great, that's cool, what happens
1148180	1149180	next?
1149180	1151220	I know who you might need to talk to.
1151220	1154020	And I would be remiss if I did not mention, because we just had them on the show like
1154020	1158660	six weeks ago, but the guys behind Starmazer, which is a game that's on Kickstarter, that's
1158660	1160900	a shooter meets a point and click adventure game.
1160900	1164540	I don't know if you've seen that, but when you kind of talk about that, I mean, I'm sure
1164540	1167380	you're not thinking like the same direction or whatever, but like that, I couldn't help
1167380	1169020	it have that pop in my mind.
1169020	1172540	But that's so funny that all these like different ideas, and I think it was, I was hearing a
1172540	1175980	lot of that same thing from them is that this is the game we wanted to make.
1175980	1181100	This is our vision, and we've got these two genres, and we wanted a game that had both.
1181100	1182100	So that's awesome.
1182100	1185980	Yeah, that's actually good, I would love to actually connect with them.
1185980	1192460	And now that, you know, now with the first game being on Desura for a demo, and learning
1192460	1198460	that Desura actually accepts demos for Unity, because Kinship's being made in Unity, we're
1198460	1204580	going to get a demo for Kinship on Unity, hopefully in the next couple of months, hopefully
1204580	1209420	within May as well, and finally tease that more as well.
1209420	1212180	So yeah, there's some great, great stuff happening.
1212180	1215260	You're going to be a busy guy in these coming months between this event in April and then
1215260	1217300	these releases in May.
1217300	1220780	By the way, since you mentioned you've got about 2,000 people that have checked out Crumple
1220780	1225740	so far, I'm sure our dozens and dozens of listeners can help out a little bit and at
1225740	1228100	least get that number up maybe 10 more.
1228100	1237220	So let's go and give you guys the link www.desura.com slash games slash crumple, that's C-R-U-M-P-L-E
1237220	1238220	if you want to check that out.
1238220	1243460	And it's a very, the biggest important thing that I ask for, and I cannot stress this enough,
1243460	1247740	please leave feedback in the comments, even if it means sending me a private message to
1247740	1248740	let me know what you think.
1248740	1252260	You know, if you're following me on Twitter, shoot me a direct message, whatever the case
1252260	1253260	may be.
1253260	1257020	I want to know what you guys think because it's very vital to the development, you know,
1257020	1260500	the further development of this game, you know, but don't, you know, don't be an ass
1260500	1261500	about it.
1261500	1264580	You know, just talk to me, be constructive, you know, be constructive about what you're
1264580	1265580	saying.
1265580	1266580	Tell me why.
1266580	1268020	You know, I'm not going to cry about it.
1268020	1272020	I've got a very thick skin, I'm from Jersey, so we can, I can handle this.
1272020	1273020	We good.
1273020	1274020	You know what I'm saying?
1274020	1276540	I just want constructive criticism because if I hear BS, all I'm going to say is plus
1276540	1280540	one out of spite and move forward and I'm not going to do, and they're going to be like,
1280540	1281540	what is he doing that for?
1281540	1282960	Because I'm not going to feed to that.
1282960	1284460	So that's all I ask.
1284460	1287820	So since you brought up, you are from Jersey that led a spark in my head that I have to
1287820	1291420	ask you about this because I will say the Northeast folks that I do know that listen
1291420	1294700	to this show would kick my butt if they knew, I knew you were involved with this and didn't
1294700	1299540	ask you about it, but you used to do a lot of stuff with Magfest right out back East,
1299540	1300540	right?
1300540	1301540	I did.
1301540	1302540	Yes.
1302540	1303540	Yes.
1303540	1307620	I was, um, I, I w I just did volunteer work, um, at, at I think Mac Fest, not eight or
1307620	1309020	nine, I think Mac Fest eight.
1309020	1313500	And then a couple of years later I had moved here to, to, to Sacramento and reconnected
1313540	1317860	with, with, uh, the team there and had asked them a couple of, this was a couple of years
1317860	1318860	ago.
1318860	1320160	I had asked them, Hey, look, what is it?
1320160	1321900	What would it cost to get me a table?
1321900	1323300	Cause I'm working on games now.
1323300	1324700	I'm w this was when I only had kinship.
1324700	1326500	I said, well, what would it cost to get a table?
1326500	1330860	They're like, well, wait a minute, you know, w wait a minute, we're doing something for
1330860	1331860	indie for Mac Fest.
1331860	1333660	They're like, do you want to run the department?
1333660	1336260	I'm like, we remember how you helped us so greatly with volunteering.
1336260	1339820	I'm like, wait, wait, wait, wait, you know, I'm in California.
1339820	1341940	I just want to show off my game.
1341940	1344780	You're asking me to help run this new department.
1344780	1345780	And yeah.
1345780	1351060	And it turned out, yeah, my, myself and my partner Tronster, we, uh, we formed what is
1351060	1356580	now Mac Fest independent, uh, video game showcase, I think M I V S I think that's what it stands
1356580	1357580	for.
1357580	1358580	But yeah, yeah.
1358580	1359580	We've done it for a few years now.
1359580	1364660	And, uh, and now there's talk for something more here, but you know, I'll leave that.
1364660	1366300	I'll leave that for later.
1366300	1370540	This was literally just like yesterday, but I, it's becoming more and more apparent.
1370540	1373180	I have no choice, but to go to Mac Fest 2016.
1373180	1379500	You have no reason to miss Mac Fest, I swear to God, man, because Mac Fest will destroy
1379500	1380500	you.
1380500	1383540	Mac Fest is four days of madness.
1383540	1384780	It's just four days of nonsense.
1384780	1385780	They don't shut down.
1385780	1386780	My body is ready.
1386780	1387780	No, seriously.
1387780	1391340	Your body better be ready because it's like, it doesn't shut down.
1391340	1392380	Like it doesn't shut.
1392380	1396580	That's the thing about Mac Fest, unlike these other conventions where, you know, okay, we're
1396580	1398740	closed at six or we're closed at seven.
1398740	1404380	You know, Mac Fest does literally starts at 12 noon on a Thursday and does not end
1404380	1408880	until Sunday or Monday, three, four, five o'clock in the afternoon.
1408880	1413480	So you're literally, you have open access 24 hours to that four day weekend.
1413480	1416620	That sounds like our beloved Dragon Con, which isn't games, you know, it's a different type
1416620	1417620	of thing.
1417620	1418620	But I love that.
1418620	1421620	Like just 24 seven beer in hand.
1421620	1422620	Let's do this.
1422620	1423620	Good times.
1423620	1424620	Good times.
1424620	1425620	Uh, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
1425620	1429300	SSJ100Matt saying the Indie Showcase was really impressive last year.
1429300	1431380	He's out in that area.
1431380	1434100	And Breakman with a question about your game here.
1434100	1437780	How did you come up with the name Crumple?
1437780	1438780	Funny enough.
1438780	1443740	So Crumple, um, it is funny cause I was kind of debating what, yeah, when I was figuring
1443740	1450180	out a name for this game, um, cause my biggest struggle was I know what I want the character
1450180	1451180	to be.
1451180	1453080	You know, that was one challenging part.
1453080	1457680	You know, I stood the envelope up and as I looked at the envelope, I said that, you
1457680	1462760	know, some envelopes have windows, but there was just one, I said, what if I add another
1462760	1463760	one?
1463760	1464760	There are the eyes.
1464760	1468300	And then I'm like, now I've got an identifying character.
1468300	1470280	Now comes the next steps.
1470280	1472080	What, what can it do?
1472080	1473600	What will it be able to do?
1473600	1476240	And one of the biggest, biggest things was Crumpling.
1476240	1481280	Um, and funny enough, this is kind of a, no one knows this, not even you, but, um, when
1481280	1486080	we were in the process of when my pro, cause it's just a two man team for, for Crumple.
1486080	1490920	Um, when Alex, uh, big, big shout out to my man, Alex, my, he's the programmer artist,
1490920	1493520	the whole nine yards, the animator for all of this.
1493520	1499240	Um, he, uh, when we were talking, I actually kept calling it Crumble and he had to correct
1499240	1500240	me like a month later.
1500240	1501760	He's like, Gabriel, can I just tell you something?
1501760	1502760	I'm like, what?
1502760	1504760	He was like, it's Crumple.
1504760	1506260	It's not Crumble.
1506260	1509000	You're confusing your envelope with coffee cake.
1509000	1510680	He's like, please stop doing that.
1510680	1512080	And I'm like, oh, I want coffee cake.
1512080	1515240	But then I was embarrassed after that and I was like, holy crap.
1515240	1516240	Yes.
1516240	1520520	And when he did that, when he said that to me, I said, yes, that's what we're going to
1520520	1521600	call it.
1521600	1523240	We're going to call it Crumple.
1523240	1527320	So essentially the title is at the cost of my dignity.
1527320	1532400	The calling it something else entirely different, but it caught on and that, and then I said,
1532400	1535320	now we have to emphasize Crumple.
1535320	1536320	What is it?
1536320	1537320	How are we defining this?
1537320	1539480	So yeah, that's kind of where it happened.
1539480	1543880	I do feel like you're, you're, you're pitching ideas for a sequel though, because you can
1543880	1547200	have a coffee cake in Crumple 2, the Crumbling.
1547200	1548200	You can have that.
1548200	1550200	So just, just throwing that out there.
1550200	1551600	Hey, it's video games, man.
1551600	1553000	You can do whatever the hell you want, man.
1553000	1555040	You can do whatever the hell you want.
1555040	1558880	Dungeon Buster in chat over at live.vognetware.com says your body better be ready.
1558880	1560560	That's the bagfest byline right there.
1560560	1562320	Put that on the poster.
1562320	1563320	All right.
1563320	1567520	More information where we can check out nascent games and Crumple.
1567560	1569480	Literally you've got a website, a Twitter plug away.
1569480	1570480	Absolutely.
1570480	1571480	Yeah.
1571480	1575640	Funny enough, the website admittedly has been tough to keep up with because it's just me,
1575640	1579680	myself and I for the time being, but nascentgames.com.
1579680	1580900	You can see our stuff there.
1580900	1584920	I haven't updated it in a while, so forgive me and don't hold it against me, but I am
1584920	1586080	phenomenal on Twitter.
1586080	1587080	I am amazing on there.
1587080	1589960	So my Twitter handle is at nascentgames.
1589960	1591540	So just hit us up there.
1591540	1594880	And again, I mean, the good thing is at least, even though I don't update the website too,
1594880	1597680	too often, there's a live Twitter feed connected to the website.
1597680	1600220	So at least you'll see things going on actively on there.
1600220	1601440	So yeah.
1601440	1606080	And also, actually, matter of fact, if you want to see gameplay videos of both games,
1606080	1611800	we have our most recent trailer for Kinship and our most recent game, well, I shouldn't
1611800	1615300	most recent, our only gameplay video for Crumple on YouTube.
1615300	1619120	We have a channel on YouTube, youtube.com slash nascent games.
1619120	1620120	Yeah.
1620120	1621600	You can check stuff out there as well.
1621600	1622600	So.
1622600	1623600	Awesome.
1623600	1624600	Great.
1625320	1628320	So I just wanted to check out that demo for Crumple and I will be checking that out too,
1628320	1629320	for sure.
1629320	1634700	I was meant to play it last week when I saw you guys at the event that you guys do every
1634700	1637240	Tuesday, which I'll talk more about with Brie in a minute.
1637240	1641280	I wanted to see that, but it's timing, I wasn't able to have the time to see it.
1641280	1642280	So soon, soon.
1642280	1643280	I brought it with me.
1643280	1645160	We can plug it up to the TV later.
1645160	1646160	We might have to do that during break.
1646160	1647160	We'll make that happen.
1647160	1648160	Might have that happen.
1648160	1649160	I do want to spend a little time.
1649160	1652680	I know we got to get to our gaming weeks and the news and everything, but I can't just...
1652680	1653680	Brie's been so patient.
1653760	1654760	Yes, no, definitely.
1654760	1658560	I want to talk to Brie a little bit here about what she does with the IGDA.
1658560	1664120	Now Brie, I know you're not necessarily creating games, but like, you know, as Gabriel was
1664120	1667320	saying before, sometimes game developers need help.
1667320	1670520	And I know a lot of that help, and I need it with running a podcast, is the business
1670520	1671520	end of things.
1671520	1672520	Right?
1672520	1674260	Yes, that's true.
1674260	1678040	So my background is in performing arts.
1678040	1683160	And I grew up loving games and it wasn't until I met with Gabriel that everything was kind
1683160	1688360	of put together for me as far as it's not just the programming, it's not just the art,
1688360	1692640	there's also the music component, and then the business aspect as well, especially for
1692640	1694720	our local developers here.
1694720	1699240	Many of them are startup companies or getting ready to become a startup company.
1699240	1703760	And we, as part of the IGDA, we want to help encourage them to build a strong foundation
1703760	1706460	because we want them to be long lasting.
1706460	1707520	That's very important.
1707520	1713240	And especially with Gabriel kind of leading the charge with that, as well as a few of
1713240	1717400	the other established studios here, we're all kind of growing together.
1717400	1723180	And so yeah, my whole role in this wonderful world of game development here in Sacramento
1723180	1725720	is I'm kind of the storyteller.
1725720	1730240	I like to be the voice for our chapter and for our developers.
1730240	1733280	Again, we are in Sacramento, California.
1733280	1735280	We're a lot different than the Bay Area.
1735280	1739160	But we're the capital of California, and there was no presence here at all.
1739160	1742640	So now we have the attention of the United Kingdom.
1742640	1748600	We have IGDA Australia that's a little jealous of our networking and mingle events.
1748600	1754400	Yeah, you know, before I really knew you guys, I would try to explain like game development
1754400	1757760	in Sacramento, and I'd be like, well, there's that building downtown.
1757760	1758760	It's BioWare.
1758760	1760120	Oh, wait, no, no, no, it's EA.
1760120	1764400	Wait, no, no, no, you know, but that's all, you know, I could really think about.
1764400	1769940	But there's tons that I'm not, I haven't been seeing until you guys have been getting bigger.
1769940	1770940	There are.
1770940	1775440	So when I was speaking with Gabriel yesterday during our last progressive game jam, you
1775440	1779880	know, we've had people come through and we kind of made sense where we have all these
1779880	1780960	different components.
1780960	1786400	We have the established studios, the AAA studios, and then our scene, the indie scene.
1786400	1791040	And now as IGDA, I think we're all just trying to put that together so that we all start
1791040	1794960	working together to help grow together.
1794960	1795960	It's all about togetherness.
1795960	1796960	That's great.
1796960	1797960	That's great.
1797960	1798960	Tell me a little bit.
1798960	1802480	Here on the show a couple weeks ago, I focused a lot on PAX East because I was out at Penny
1802480	1806080	Arcade Expo in Boston, so I talked a little bit about my experiences there.
1806080	1809200	But meanwhile, at the same time, GDC was going on.
1809200	1812340	So when you're talking about togetherness, my mind goes, well, that's the time when they're
1812340	1814160	all together is GDC.
1814160	1816640	Tell me a little bit about your experiences at GDC this year.
1816640	1822640	So at the top of the show, I said, haha, I'm so glad to be here because I'm a casual gamer.
1822640	1825560	I hope your chat room is blowing up right now.
1825560	1831640	Because once you guys start getting into details, it's not that like it goes over my head.
1831640	1832880	I'm just not there yet.
1832880	1834120	I am in my Renaissance.
1834120	1836920	So GDC for me was mind blowing.
1836920	1841800	I mean, you're hearing it here first.
1841800	1845240	I get so anxious playing games in front of other people.
1845240	1851440	So to be at a conference with 24,000 developers from around the world freaked me out.
1851440	1855840	But I loved it because the workshops were incredible, very informative.
1855840	1858320	They had a whole retro section.
1858320	1863200	I kind of, you know, I had my business workshops that I went to, but then I just kind of walked
1863200	1864200	around and played games.
1864200	1870280	And I thought that was the coolest thing because none of my other boring conferences had that.
1870280	1874480	But you will not be here to promote a Twitch channel tonight if you don't.
1874480	1881300	So I'm trying to figure out how to get myself on Twitch because I think I'd be pretty entertaining.
1881300	1884360	So even though you just said, I don't like to play games in front of other people, you're
1884360	1885880	like, but you know what, I'm just going to throw caution.
1885880	1887400	I know what you should play.
1887400	1889440	You need to play Hatoful Boyfriend on Twitch.
1889440	1891440	That would be hilarious.
1891440	1892440	I'm unaware of this.
1892440	1895440	It's a pigeon dating simulator.
1895440	1901880	Oh, but it's got like a, once you've dated all the pigeons, then it has like this really
1901880	1905660	like morbid, whole full storyline.
1905660	1907400	It's really wrong and hilarious.
1907400	1912140	See, there's a whole world that I have yet to explore and you guys need to help open
1912140	1913140	my perspective.
1913140	1914140	All right.
1914140	1915140	You got it.
1915140	1916140	We got your back.
1916140	1917140	We got your back.
1917140	1918140	Just don't, don't listen to them.
1918140	1920320	Don't listen to the games that my chatters say you should play because then you'll be
1920320	1924880	doing nothing but Five Nights at Freddy's, Amnesia, and scary games.
1924880	1929120	Mister, I haven't played Five Nights at Freddy's 2 after Jamie bought it for him.
1929120	1930120	Anyway.
1930120	1931120	I'm open.
1931360	1932360	All right.
1932360	1933360	All right.
1933360	1937280	Let's talk a little bit about the event we're going to be broadcasting from on April 11th.
1937280	1939560	What can folks look forward to seeing?
1939560	1943520	I mean, again, a very small portion of our audience is actually in Sacramento, so I have
1943520	1947000	to kind of look at the bigger picture about what everybody's going to hear nationwide.
1947000	1950880	But what can folks kind of look forward to coming out of this event?
1950880	1954960	So Gabriel, would you like to chime in?
1954960	1955960	Love it.
1955960	1956960	Love it.
1956960	1957960	You're adorable.
1957960	1965920	The, you know, we, the main thing is, you know, we're, we're, it's a professional developers
1965920	1973920	event where we open access to all gamers to try out these professional upcoming startup
1973920	1975920	indie studios.
1975920	1980320	And like I mentioned earlier, you know, it's, it's going to be in your face and there's
1980320	1986320	going to be, you know, at least 15 game developers, a couple, I think at least one, at least one
1986360	1991400	maybe two is, is an indie studio bringing the Oculus Rift.
1991400	1993600	They brought it last year and it was huge.
1993600	1995560	It was a huge, it was, it was a huge response.
1995560	2001280	I mean, but fortunately it was a huge response for all the teams, all the studios.
2001280	2003560	You know, so we're going to have more of that this year.
2003560	2010080	I think it's, there's a greater, there's a greater scale now because, and I want to say
2010080	2016280	a huge achievement, which is so Xbox language talk, but anyway, it's, you know, but it's
2016280	2023280	like, it's real stuff here because this year Kate Edwards, she's the director, the executive
2024640	2027020	director for all of IGDA.
2027020	2032560	She's going to be here to, as the keynote speaker for our little local chapter event.
2032560	2037520	So the president of the IGDA, the top, the top dog, she will be here, is going to be
2037520	2042580	here and we're going to, we're going to, if, if hopefully I'm 99% sure we're going to bring
2042580	2045240	her to you on, on VOG and you can check it out.
2045240	2046440	You guys are.
2046440	2051060	And that's a huge, huge step for us because that means they see what we're doing.
2051060	2052640	She sees it, she values it.
2052640	2057340	She saw it at GDC because we made our chapter known at GDC.
2057340	2059740	It wasn't just a social gathering.
2059740	2065740	I said, we're turning this into a demo night and we, that's what we did.
2065740	2068240	So we, you know, so it was great to have that.
2068240	2073340	So she saw that other people that we're going to have speaking, we have Jeff Louie from
2073340	2078740	Capsity, which is where we host a lot of our IGDA events and even my own startup studio
2078740	2082180	where I meet with my team and we, we work on there.
2082180	2085940	And you know, so Jeff Louie, you know, big, you know, founder of Capsity, he's going to
2085940	2087340	be there speaking as well.
2087340	2091420	We, you know, we have Deborah Mirimoto from California Capital.
2091420	2097260	She's all about minority owned women, owned businesses, startups, providing resources,
2097260	2100240	business resources, legal resources, all these things.
2100240	2105320	She attended one of our events and spoke for a little while, you know, so we're getting
2105320	2110380	this recognition, you know, you know, from these real, real deal people and, you know,
2110380	2116080	and then finally our, our educational advisor for the chapter, his name is Patrick Cranley.
2116080	2118580	He's a professor at Sac City College.
2118580	2123880	He's going to soon be running the entire game developer program for Sac City College.
2123880	2127460	He's going to be speaking as well and it's just a huge deal.
2127460	2131860	So we're going to have a lot of, there's going to be a lot of guidance and education, you
2131860	2133000	know, you know, advice.
2133000	2137820	So I was just going to say, we've had like kind of a running theme on VOG Network practically
2137820	2141220	this year about like, you know, yes, you can make a game, you know, and sometimes it's
2141220	2144180	going to, it's going to be very difficult and it can be very time consuming, but you
2144180	2148060	know, yes, you can make a game and there's a lot of people out there that may not even
2148060	2152820	know like where I want to make a game and I, I'm starting to get that technical know
2152820	2154820	how and just, but now what do I do with it?
2154820	2155820	How do I get noticed?
2155820	2156820	How do I get bigger?
2157820	2162700	I love how you said that you're going to let all the gamers get access to this information.
2162700	2166820	Like we can all see how the sausage is made type of thing and I, no, I think that's excellent.
2166820	2167820	I think that's great.
2167820	2168820	I, I'm still looking forward to that myself.
2168820	2169820	You said sausage.
2169820	2170820	It's what it is.
2170820	2175420	It's not a, it's not a, why y'all got to take it to a nasty place?
2175420	2176820	It's not a nasty thing.
2176820	2177820	All right.
2177820	2178820	Anyway.
2178820	2181620	And now I'm going to get all serious again.
2181620	2186780	And that's what I found at least in my promoting of the event with people around the area is
2186780	2190580	you know, I'm talking to parents who have younger kids that very passionate about their
2190580	2193980	video games, but you know, they don't have the experience that we do with some of the
2193980	2196780	retro games and to see where it's at now.
2196780	2199620	So they, their kids are like, I want to make a game.
2199620	2200820	I want to learn how to make game.
2200820	2202580	I don't know where to go.
2202580	2203880	Please come to our event.
2203880	2208740	Because what we found in our own chapter is we're working with gentlemen and a few ladies
2208740	2213380	that are, you know, in their late thirties that are just now getting to do what they
2213380	2214980	love to do.
2214980	2218140	And we don't want kids to wait that long.
2218140	2222380	So there's really a bigger picture going on here and we want the entire community, the
2222380	2227820	whole region to come and see, and who knows what's going to be ignited within that.
2227820	2228820	That is so powerful.
2228820	2232940	That really, I mean, truly just that, that really just lays it out right there that like,
2232940	2237540	you know, you don't want some kid thinking they can't do it and wait until they're, you
2237540	2239900	know, my age to do it.
2239900	2240900	Yeah.
2240900	2244020	And, and I was, I was one of those, actually what she just said.
2244060	2245060	I was one of those kids.
2245060	2248660	I wanted to start, I had game ideas and I didn't know they were game ideas.
2248660	2250220	I just wrote things on paper.
2250220	2255500	I was nine, 10 years old drawing out highways and, and city, crappy looking city skylines.
2255500	2256500	Did we all do that?
2256500	2257500	Yeah.
2257500	2258500	That was like the big thing in grade school.
2258500	2260700	You draw the dungeon and I'm drawing out the store, store.
2260700	2263420	Okay now, so you're going to have to buy a rope from the store to get over the pit or
2263420	2265180	you're going to get eaten by this little alligator I drew.
2265180	2269980	I will say that the one my friend Ashley and I made in ninth grade in high school turned
2269980	2272700	out to be a tabletop game I ran in college.
2272700	2273700	Nice.
2274380	2275380	That's awesome.
2275380	2276380	There you go.
2276380	2277380	Anything is possible, kids.
2277380	2278780	You see anything is possible.
2278780	2279980	And that's, that's just it.
2279980	2285460	I do have to say though, I hope no kids are listening to this show, that whole salty thing
2285460	2286460	we talked about before.
2286460	2287460	Yeah.
2287460	2288460	It's purely educational.
2288460	2289460	It's so sorry.
2289460	2290460	Not sorry.
2290460	2291460	Yeah.
2291460	2292460	The following commentary.
2292460	2294980	We're not responsible on VOG network and its affiliates.
2294980	2300380	But yeah, I mean, and that, and I think that's where our, our arcade event is going to stand
2300380	2303660	out from other types of events.
2303660	2305340	It, you know, other types of events.
2305340	2306340	It's just entertainment.
2306340	2307740	Oh, look at your famous celebrity.
2307740	2308740	Oh good.
2308740	2309940	I've seen you for the third year in a row.
2309940	2313320	But no, here you're going to learn.
2313320	2314340	You're going to have fun.
2314340	2315340	You're going to learn.
2315340	2316340	But we get to play too.
2316340	2317340	Yeah.
2317340	2318340	You're, yeah.
2318340	2319340	And that's it.
2319340	2320340	Once you play, you're going to interact.
2320340	2322460	And it'll be nice to actually play with an Oculus Rift for once.
2322460	2323460	Yeah.
2323460	2324460	And Bree, here you go.
2324460	2327340	I want to ask Bree, I want to ask Bree a little more and then I got to start to wrap things
2327340	2328340	up so we can move on.
2328340	2331580	I want to ask Bree a little more about the play end of this, because it's not just like
2331580	2334940	lectures and things and motivation, but there's, there's play as well.
2334940	2336980	But I do have to get some comments from her chat room.
2336980	2341980	Dark Tetsuya over at live.vognetwork.com says, sausage is good.
2341980	2342980	I love sausage.
2342980	2343980	Thank you.
2343980	2344980	Me too.
2344980	2345980	All right.
2345980	2348740	And Bobby Blackwell says, to be fair, we had to wait that long because we didn't have triple
2348740	2353100	A level game engines available for low cost or free when we were in college.
2353100	2357460	If Unity or UE4 existed when I was in college, I would have made games in college.
2357460	2358460	Precisely.
2358460	2359460	That's true.
2359460	2362940	We had what, the incredible machine and you got to make your little machines in there.
2362940	2363940	ZZT, right?
2363940	2365900	Hey, don't be knocking, click and play, okay?
2365900	2366900	No, no, no.
2366900	2368420	It was all about muds.
2368420	2369420	All right.
2369420	2372820	Bree, tell us a little bit quickly about the play end of things.
2372820	2376380	So it's not just this educational, but we get to play too.
2376380	2377380	Right.
2377380	2378380	Indie Arcade is going to be fun.
2378380	2384140	We've partnered with Retro Gen 916 and every Tuesday they host a throwback down the street
2384140	2388940	from us and they're going to set up a bunch of consoles, everything from the NES to the
2388940	2395660	Super NES to PlayStation, the first one, and you'll have a diverse array of games to play.
2395660	2396660	They have a virtual boy.
2396660	2397660	And that impressed me.
2397660	2398660	They have a virtual boy?
2398660	2399660	That impressed me.
2399660	2400660	Holy cow.
2400660	2401660	Yes.
2401660	2403740	We're going to have some Guitar Hero up.
2403740	2407180	Bill from Davis Atari Party is going to set up a mini Atari party.
2407180	2408180	Yes.
2408180	2410060	Dan was mentioning that because we go to Atari party every year.
2410060	2411060	My husband.
2411060	2412060	He's coming up.
2412060	2413060	Cool.
2413060	2415240	We're going to have a preview of that.
2415240	2416300	You guys are going to be there.
2416300	2417900	So that's a party in itself.
2417900	2419780	Oh, shucks.
2419780	2424520	We're going to have video game tournaments, Smash Brothers, Super Smash Brothers, Killer
2424520	2428220	Instinct and what was the, oh, Mario Kart 8.
2428220	2431720	And there's going to be documentaries and live video game music.
2431720	2433220	It's going to be a really great party.
2433220	2437440	So it's not all boring.
2437440	2439140	But the boring stuff is important.
2439140	2440140	Yes.
2440140	2441140	Yes.
2441140	2442660	Which means Gabriel, stop talking about boring stuff.
2442660	2443660	I got you.
2443660	2444660	I got you.
2444660	2445660	No, no.
2445660	2446660	I got you.
2446660	2447660	You guys are laughing.
2447660	2448660	We can hear you guys actually talk even more.
2448660	2449660	You can hear more of this chemistry, right?
2449660	2450660	You guys have your own podcast?
2450660	2451660	We do.
2451660	2452660	We actually have our next...
2452660	2453660	God help us.
2453660	2454660	Yeah.
2454660	2455660	Yeah.
2455660	2456660	We have our next show actually on Wednesday.
2456660	2457660	Don't sell yourselves.
2457660	2458660	Sort now.
2458660	2459660	Oh, no.
2459660	2460660	Oh, God.
2460660	2461660	Don't remind me about the podcast.
2461660	2463460	Oh, shit.
2463460	2471620	We have on the first Wednesday of every month, we do our own video game community type of
2471620	2477780	news discussion and talk and ranting and so on and so forth.
2477780	2478780	He rants.
2478780	2483060	I just tweet because he doesn't share the microphone, kind of like right now.
2483060	2489700	Oh, there's your preview, SacGamersUnite, at SacGamersUnite on Twitter.
2489700	2493660	Tune in for more drama on Wednesday nights, 7 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.
2493660	2495540	Why are you doing a three hour show?
2495540	2502900	Can I say, I love that she has to interrupt you to actually plug the actual podcast, because
2502900	2507060	you're not mentioning this is where you go to listen to it.
2507060	2508060	It's on purpose.
2508060	2509060	Oh, my God.
2509060	2510060	You guys are hilarious.
2510060	2511060	It's all scripted.
2511060	2512060	Stay forever.
2512060	2513060	You guys are great.
2513060	2514060	All right.
2514060	2515060	Okay.
2515060	2518860	So again, so just one more time, the Sac Indie Arcade event is happening April 11th.
2518860	2522840	That's 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Pacific on VOG.
2522840	2526240	My understanding is it might go a little later if you're there in person, but on VOG, it'll
2526240	2531000	be 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Pacific, and we're so excited to bring it to you guys.
2531000	2534600	And I'm just excited to go and meet all this talent.
2534600	2536880	You guys are helping to...
2536880	2540520	It's kind of like we're watering the lawn, and soon it's going to look like my backyard.
2540520	2541520	Absolutely.
2541520	2542520	Yeah.
2542520	2543520	Absolutely.
2543520	2544520	Absolutely.
2544520	2545520	And that's exactly it.
2545520	2549200	Just the community, because we're all in this together here, and that's why I say I'm in
2549200	2550200	it.
2550200	2551200	I'm still learning it all.
2551640	2555360	At this point, it's like, whatever I learn, I want to share with others, because we're
2555360	2556740	all in this together.
2556740	2558720	That's essentially what this event is about.
2558720	2562720	It's a celebration of this talent here.
2562720	2563720	Awesome.
2563720	2564720	Awesome.
2564720	2570120	And I hope folks worldwide will tune in to hear it, and not only check out some of these,
2570120	2574680	what gamers or what game makers go through and what they learn about, but also some of
2574680	2578520	these games that you might be playing yourself someday or shouldn't be playing, really.
2578520	2581400	You can play right now on Desura or wherever.
2581400	2586160	All these other different companies have their games hosted.
2586160	2589940	I do want to ask one more very important question, and then we'll move into our gaming weeks
2589940	2591600	and the news and everything.
2591600	2597480	But I always ask every guest that comes on OLR, I got to know, favorite video game of
2597480	2601240	all time, and defend your choice.
2601240	2602240	Oh, no.
2602240	2603240	Oh, no.
2603240	2607120	And you can only pick one, one, one, one.
2607120	2608120	Okay.
2608720	2609720	I'm going to let Brianna answer first.
2609720	2611680	Do you know why he's going to let me answer first?
2611680	2613680	Because he's going to take forever.
2613680	2614680	All right.
2614680	2617840	I like Galaga, and I'm proud to say that.
2617840	2618840	Okay.
2618840	2622360	I've come a long way because I was very hesitant to say that before.
2622360	2623360	But here I am.
2623360	2624360	I'm saying it.
2624360	2625360	Where's the Galaga hate?
2625360	2626360	Is there a Galaga hate club out there?
2626360	2628440	The Galaga's important.
2628440	2632440	Maybe there was no hate, but I was still very intimidated to say it.
2632440	2633440	I don't.
2633440	2634440	Galaga's awesome.
2634440	2635440	Yeah.
2635440	2637440	When she said that to me, I was like, Galaga's phenomenal.
2637440	2638440	What do you mean?
2638440	2639440	Don't ever be ashamed of that.
2639440	2643480	And yeah, we became real close after that as it was awesome.
2643480	2646640	Especially considering Galaga's a shooter, and you were talking about shooters earlier.
2646640	2648000	It kind of makes sense.
2648000	2649000	That was unplanned.
2649000	2650000	I promise you.
2650000	2652960	So with me, oh my goodness.
2652960	2653960	There's so many.
2653960	2659200	But yes, if there's one that really, really hits home for me, and really life itself is
2659200	2660200	Journey.
2660200	2661200	Yup.
2661200	2664200	No, wait a minute though.
2664200	2665200	Wait a minute though.
2665200	2666200	Let me be clear.
2666200	2668200	Jamie's probably thinking about the 1981 game.
2668200	2670320	No, I'm just kidding.
2670320	2673760	You're not talking about Journey, the band, although that was an awesome game too.
2673760	2677960	I was talking about the new one that I honestly have only watched people play because it's
2677960	2678960	funny.
2678960	2679960	Yes.
2679960	2684640	Made by that game company who I had the pleasure of meeting both founders, Jenova Chen and
2684640	2685840	Kelly Santiago.
2685840	2690360	Kelly Santiago was a guest on our show recently, and I had the pleasure of meeting Jenova twice.
2690360	2693840	Yes, Journey is definitely the life-changing game for me.
2693840	2696400	There's so, so, so many, but Journey's it.
2696400	2697400	Definitely.
2697400	2698400	Interesting.
2698400	2703120	You don't hear a lot of people picking a contemporary choice when presented with that question.
2703120	2708360	Most answers I hear are either 80s arcade classics, like we got there, or Nintendo or
2708360	2709360	Super Nintendo.
2709360	2710360	If you asked me, I'd say Super Metroid.
2710360	2711360	Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
2711360	2713360	See, there's just so many.
2713360	2714360	Yeah.
2714360	2716120	If you talk about the ending of Super Metroid, we can go on for it.
2716120	2718800	See, Rob's wrong because actually the best game ever is the Guardian Legend.
2718800	2719800	All right.
2719800	2720800	Anyway, anyway.
2720800	2722360	But you don't hear contemporary choices.
2722360	2723360	Awesome.
2723880	2728240	What was it about Journey that just made you go, this is it?
2728240	2731160	This is the experience I've been waiting for?
2731160	2737620	Because Journey took two characters, well, a character that had no identity, and the
2737620	2743160	entire game it was all about it finding itself and its purpose for being there and why.
2743160	2752120	And for me, it took me so long to find myself and have my identity, which I did not have
2752120	2754240	until I got here to Sacramento.
2754240	2756240	I didn't have that period.
2756240	2766500	So the timing of the game's release was impeccable because I had just started on kinship.
2766500	2771440	We actually started having an actual tiny prototype, and then I see this game, and then
2771440	2779440	I see the story of that game company, and it just, yeah.
2779440	2782480	It hits at the deepest core of me.
2782480	2783480	So yeah.
2783480	2784480	No, I hear you.
2784480	2786720	I remember my first experience with that game, and I can mention this now.
2786720	2787720	It's not really spoilers.
2787720	2792280	The game's been out for years, but the big twist in that game was that you're not alone
2792280	2793420	when you play Journey.
2793420	2799880	You will be put in, I mean, it's online, and so another random person will be in your game.
2799880	2804280	And with all the venom that's out there sometimes in the gaming world, and I know we've all
2804280	2808480	seen the YouTubes of people that do really nasty things when they play Halo and so forth,
2808520	2810200	Journey strips that out.
2810200	2816040	You cannot verbally communicate with the other person that's there, but you can non-verbally
2816040	2819880	communicate and you have other ways of making cues with that person.
2819880	2827200	And seeing the way that people essentially invented language in a game like Journey was
2827200	2828820	phenomenal.
2828820	2833440	And I think for me, that game is definitely probably, I would agree, is in the top 10
2833440	2834680	for me of all time.
2834680	2839520	And I think the way that people, it was a game that made you invent language, or you
2839520	2843720	could also choose to just abandon the person.
2843720	2848480	And that says a lot about how people react in different situations as well.
2848480	2853180	And I just, I remember not knowing that twist going in and playing it, and when I figured
2853180	2858880	it out that the person that was with me was another person, was an actual person playing,
2858880	2862240	I was like, mind exploded.
2862240	2863240	Mind exploded.
2863240	2864240	Absolutely.
2864800	2867960	And it's so simple, it's so simple.
2867960	2870320	But my god, what a powerful message.
2870320	2872680	And that's just it, that's exactly it.
2872680	2874840	So yeah, I would definitely say that.
2874840	2875840	Amazing.
2875840	2876840	Amazing stuff.
2876840	2878080	All right, good answers you guys, good answers.
2878080	2882560	And Dungeon Buster in chat, showing some love for Galaga, it's a big arcade classic.
2882560	2883560	No shame.
2883560	2884560	Yup.
2884560	2885560	Absolutely.
2885560	2890720	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Onge Radio at vognetwork.com,
2890720	2892680	use the passphrase, smash.
2893120	2896760	All right, let's get into our gaming weeks, the types of video games we've been playing
2896760	2897760	this week.
2897760	2899760	And of course I'm going to invite our guests to stay as long as they can tonight and chime
2899760	2902720	in on our regular segments as well as the news.
2902720	2907000	But let's quickly go over our gaming weeks, we'll try to make this a little quick tonight
2907000	2908000	for time.
2908000	2909000	Dark Sakura.
2909000	2914680	Um, I feel really sad because the game that IkumaJP sent to me and Dan, I haven't had
2914680	2918560	a chance to play yet, because either he's been busy watching stuff or hasn't been home
2918560	2920000	for us to play it together.
2920000	2921440	So you have to do it together, yeah.
2922200	2926320	It's the Kunio-kun, you know, sports game series.
2926320	2932080	So like Super Dodgeball and all those, which is super fun.
2932080	2936800	I did play some Final Fantasy XIV today, long enough to check out the Gold Saucer, which
2936800	2937800	is...
2937800	2944880	I still maintain that I hate Uldah, because it's worse to navigate than Orgrimmar was.
2944880	2946480	And wow.
2946480	2951360	And then, um, I, uh, what else did I do?
2951360	2955480	Yeah, I did the first quest at the Gold Saucer, I'm kind of like, I played like a game of
2955480	2957360	Triple Triad, I'm like, this is stupid.
2957360	2958360	What?
2958360	2959360	I love Triple Triad!
2959360	2963080	Well, you can play Triple Triad for me.
2963080	2965640	And I took Hot Wings out and tried to get him some levels.
2965640	2968800	My chocobo is a red chocobo named Hot Wings.
2968800	2969800	Nice.
2969800	2970800	Yeah.
2970800	2973400	Kentucky fayagra chocobo or whatever, that old joke.
2973400	2974400	Faragga chocobo.
2974400	2975400	Yeah.
2975400	2976400	I bow to you in that.
2976400	2977400	Oh my god.
2977400	2982040	So, um, and I did play, um, I've been playing Dragon Age Inquisition, the DLC came out,
2982040	2987180	so uh, been playing through Jaws of Hakkon, it's pretty okay, I'm just mad that it nixed
2987180	2992520	all of my mods, because, and the modding community is plenty pissed too, but of course they understand.
2992520	2997040	There's actually, a dude from BioWare went on Reddit, one of the programmers, and said,
2997040	3003080	hey, we didn't do this on purpose, but we cannot accommodate for mods when we put out
3003080	3004080	the DLC.
3004080	3005080	Exactly.
3005120	3007760	We have to bug check our own shit, we can't bug check yours.
3007760	3008760	Exactly.
3008760	3009760	I get it.
3009760	3012920	Some of the differences, I was going to actually put that in on show roll, just reading from
3012920	3018760	the forum on there, but I didn't, but he was going in saying that, yeah, Frostbite is a
3018760	3025040	completely different creature than what they used before in Real Engine, you know, saying
3025040	3031800	that it doesn't allow you, and let me start over, it doesn't allow for that type of maintenance
3031840	3035680	of the mods to keep them working like it did in the previous iterations.
3035680	3041320	So another guy on one of the mod forums, on the official BioWare forum, they actually
3041320	3048320	got another guy in to pick up where warranty voider left off from the version of the modules,
3048320	3052080	and they're saying that there's like, there were, you know, the code was pretty much open
3052080	3058040	for Frostbite in the full release, but in the DLC there's like 72 lines of encrypted
3058040	3064160	code that basically are what's preventing it from being just open source for everybody.
3064160	3070960	So that's where they're getting into, do we break this or do we just stop the mods here
3070960	3072760	or do we find another way to get it to work?
3072760	3073760	Fair enough.
3073760	3075980	So you've been pretty busy with the Dragon Age then.
3075980	3076980	And writing fan fiction.
3076980	3077980	All right.
3077980	3078980	Fair enough.
3078980	3079980	Fair enough.
3079980	3080980	Loki.
3080980	3082280	Loki, how was your gaming week?
3082280	3083280	I didn't play anything.
3083280	3084280	You didn't play anything?
3084280	3085280	Yeah, unfortunately.
3085280	3086840	But you're still working on your own game, that's...
3086840	3090600	Yeah, I've been working on mine, and then, what else did I do?
3090600	3098240	Oh, I also went through, because I had noticed I had some message from Indie Gala or whatever
3098240	3101160	about some upcoming bundle that they had, and I was like, you know, I should really
3101160	3104640	check these sites that I've been buying these bundles for to see if I've actually redeemed
3104640	3106760	all my games on Steam, and no, I hadn't.
3106760	3109240	So now up to like over 350 games.
3109240	3110560	Ah, the Steam problem.
3110560	3111560	The Steam problem.
3111560	3112560	I haven't played.
3112560	3113560	He's over 9000.
3113560	3114560	I don't even know what they are anymore.
3114560	3116560	I'm like, what is this thing that I bought?
3117280	3119840	No, they had that sale this week, it was on PlayStation Network.
3119840	3120840	I bought it.
3120840	3121840	Was that the 10% discount?
3121840	3122840	Or...
3122840	3123840	No, it was the games under a dollar.
3123840	3124840	Oh, the dollar!
3124840	3125840	The games under a dollar.
3125840	3126840	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
3126840	3127840	So I had to buy like, like, oh, Katamari.
3127840	3128840	Yes.
3128840	3129840	Toes of Metal Black.
3129840	3130840	Yes.
3130840	3131840	And then you played none of them.
3131840	3132840	Right.
3132840	3136280	Because I didn't play any of them.
3136280	3137280	That's okay, though.
3137280	3138280	So...
3138280	3142600	But no, I spent most of my week actually trying to get some confetti launchers to work correctly
3142600	3144080	in my game, and they look nice now.
3144080	3146080	You have to get the perfect confetti cannon.
3146600	3150280	I did, I did have to get the perfect confetti cannon, and so now my confetti looks nice.
3150280	3151280	I love it.
3151280	3155200	Let me, I'm gonna go to Gabriel next for his gaming week, because, you know, we're hearing
3155200	3159800	from Loki that the development of games is keeping him from playing a lot of games.
3159800	3161800	Are you having the same experience?
3161800	3162800	No.
3162800	3163800	So...
3163800	3164800	No.
3164800	3165800	Well, instruct Loki on how it's done.
3165800	3167040	What have you been playing?
3167040	3171560	It's just time management, and maybe losing some sleep or whatever, sacrificing time to
3171560	3173000	call your family, whatever.
3173000	3174000	It's fine.
3174000	3180960	Yeah, I, the games for this week have been Ori and the Blind Forest, Xbox One, stunning,
3180960	3185560	stunning, stunning, gorgeous, but painfully difficult game.
3185560	3190480	Should not be as difficult as it is, for as gorgeous as it is, because I think it's taken
3190480	3195960	away from my, some of my experiences with it so far, but it's still a gorgeous game.
3195960	3199720	Resident Evil Revelations 2, I was rocking that, I've been rocking that out this week,
3199720	3203080	the full game, been loving that so far.
3203080	3207640	And DuckTales for the Nintendo just came in for me a couple, yesterday, so I was rocking
3207640	3208860	that out yesterday.
3208860	3211160	So yeah, DuckTales for the NES, yep.
3211160	3216480	Wait, like, you said it came in for you, so somebody out there is hunting old NES games
3216480	3218320	and putting some aside for you, huh?
3218320	3220520	Well, yeah, and then I got a really good deal for it.
3220520	3223160	Yeah, I'm gonna need some contact information.
3223160	3226640	We will, yeah, the retro gen people, I have surprised them with the games that they just
3226640	3229120	couldn't find, but that I did, so yeah.
3229120	3234000	And then I think the last game that I've been messing around with, Shantae and the
3234000	3237240	Pirates something something on the Wii U, because they put it on discount.
3237240	3238240	So yeah.
3238240	3239240	I had that on Steam.
3239240	3240240	Yes!
3240240	3241240	Great game.
3241240	3242240	Loving the hell out of that game.
3242240	3244240	So yeah, that's been mainly my games this week.
3244240	3245240	Awesome.
3245240	3246240	Brianna, what about you?
3246240	3248440	What kind of video games have you been playing this week?
3248440	3250920	Just remember, new gamer here.
3250920	3251920	It's alright.
3251920	3257680	So my whole week encompassed two games, one of which was the Crumple demo, because my
3257680	3264320	laptop is so slow, and I can't, I keep dying, I keep burning, and I keep dying.
3264320	3266920	Do you hear the aggressiveness in my voice?
3266920	3271420	That is what you would see on a Twitch video, because I think it's so frustrated.
3271420	3272640	But you're giving all that feedback.
3272640	3275520	Oh, heck yes, I gave all that feedback.
3275520	3283180	And then the second game, I started playing just Friday night, the Fast and Furious free
3283180	3284920	play from Xbox One.
3284920	3286360	Oh, I want to check that out.
3286360	3287520	I don't even have an Xbox One.
3287560	3291760	Yeah, I downloaded that today, or I meant to download, or I just beat it today.
3291760	3292760	Is it on Xbox 360?
3292760	3293760	Oh, yes.
3293760	3294760	It is.
3294760	3296520	Oh, Gabriel's telling me yes it is.
3296520	3297520	Yes it is.
3297520	3298520	There it is.
3298520	3300520	Sorry, just remember, sir, if you're not on a mic, they can't hear you.
3300520	3301520	Yeah, that's true, sorry.
3301520	3302520	No, that's alright.
3302520	3305680	I yell out random things at a whim as well, it's just that this one's permanently attached
3305680	3306680	to my face.
3306680	3311080	So how are you liking the Fast and the Furious expansion, or I guess standalone side story
3311080	3312540	for Forza?
3312540	3314360	So I really like driving games.
3314360	3315360	Me too.
3315360	3316360	And I love Forza.
3316400	3321480	I have the Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 2, and I forgot how much I enjoy it, because
3321480	3326280	I was playing Rise for a little bit, and I have 3% left, and then I'm done with my first
3326280	3328640	game ever, like all the way through.
3328640	3330720	Do you hear the excitement in my voice?
3330720	3332320	I'm so proud.
3332320	3335440	I won't tell you how long it's taken me, because that's embarrassing.
3335440	3339760	I can't remember the last time I got 100% on a game, because I have what we call here
3339760	3341760	at OLR, Gamer ADD.
3341760	3342760	People don't finish games?
3342760	3343760	No, oh.
3343760	3351120	It depends on who you are, see now Dark Sakura, you know, she'll talk about the same game
3351120	3356240	for 50 weeks on this show, but she has explored every nook and cranny of the Hinterlands like
3356240	3357240	you wouldn't believe.
3357240	3360400	No, I did that on purpose, because I actually wanted to fill up the whole map and see if
3360400	3361400	I could break the map.
3361400	3362400	That's me!
3362400	3367280	I have to hit every XP board, I need to drive every single race, and then if I don't come
3367280	3369600	in the top 3, I need to do that race again.
3369600	3373320	Y'all don't want to know what I did with Mass Effect.
3373320	3380080	I have modded my Mass Effect to where it's all high-res mods, and custom hair, and everything.
3380080	3383080	You're not alone.
3383080	3387120	She's trying to push beyond, the Castlevania Symphony of the Night has ruined her, because
3387120	3390080	she feels she can push beyond 100% exploration in Mass Effect.
3390080	3391880	No, you can't do it on the Xbox version.
3391880	3393640	Oh, that's right, I heard about that.
3393640	3395480	The trick doesn't work on the Xbox version.
3395480	3396480	I heard about that.
3396480	3398480	The, what was it, 211%?
3398480	3399480	Yeah, 211.
3399480	3400480	You can't do that.
3400480	3402480	You can get 206, I think, but not 211.
3402640	3406160	Yeah, because you can't do the wolf trick where you do the wolf turn into the gas and
3406160	3408520	then the bats fly outside.
3408520	3409520	For goodness sake.
3409520	3410520	I know.
3410520	3411520	Yeah.
3411520	3413200	Okay, my gaming week, I'll talk about real quick.
3413200	3418640	I got to play a little bit of Bloodborne today, because my friend Shane brought that over,
3418640	3422160	and I got killed a lot, and I had no idea what the hell I was doing, because you know,
3422160	3425240	that's one of those games that just kind of throws you in, it's like, have fun, you're
3425240	3426240	gonna die.
3426240	3427240	A lot.
3427240	3431160	No, literally, it's set at, you will die in the first five minutes of the game, you have
3431160	3434520	to, there's no way around it, and I was like, what the hell, I'm getting killed by the
3434520	3435520	first mob?
3435520	3438160	What kind of sadistic fuck plays this game?
3438160	3441480	And I knew.
3441480	3444080	But it was, I gotta say, it is a gorgeous game.
3444080	3449080	As much as I was getting frustrated by, how am I supposed to play a 3D game with my old
3449080	3451360	brain, how am I gonna play a 3D game with no map?
3451360	3454720	You mean to tell me there's no map in Bloodborne, what am I supposed to do?
3454720	3456680	Use visual cues and landmarks?
3456680	3457680	What is this?
3457680	3458680	So.
3458680	3459960	Dudes don't need maps.
3459960	3460960	This one does.
3461480	3463280	I will defy that stereotype.
3463280	3468840	I need, I would love to put Siri in the game to say, you know, go left, up ahead, and look
3468840	3471520	out for the werewolf behind the rock.
3471520	3475680	That's what I would love to have, but not gonna happen, because, you know, then they
3475680	3481600	would be, then they would be dumbing it down for filthy casuals like me, and heaven forbid
3481600	3482600	a game like Bloodborne.
3482600	3484680	So are you suggesting like a Bobby Blackwolf?
3484680	3486760	Yes, I need, I need Bobby.
3486760	3487760	Best friend.
3487760	3488880	Bobby Blackwolf Bloodborne.
3488880	3489880	Say that four times fast.
3489880	3492400	Bobby Blackwolf Bloodborne.
3492400	3493400	That's what I need.
3493400	3494400	All right.
3494400	3497600	Anyway, so I played a little bit of that.
3497600	3498600	Just a little bit.
3498600	3500760	I didn't buy the game, but a friend of mine brought it over so I could check it out.
3500760	3503540	But I did play a little bit of, and I gotta give a shout out to this, I don't talk about
3503540	3507960	mobile games an awful lot on the show, but there's one that came out this week, and I,
3507960	3512080	a lot of you that are into this series probably are aware of it, but if you're not, I'm gonna
3512080	3518320	mention Final Fantasy Record Keeper that just came out on iOS and I believe Android.
3518360	3523680	And the last Final Fantasy original game that they did, the ATB game or whatever that game
3523680	3524960	was called, I hated that game.
3524960	3525960	I was not a fan of that game.
3525960	3526960	It was awful.
3526960	3527960	I did not, right?
3527960	3530600	It was, it was just, it was finger swipey the game.
3530600	3532280	It was just clean the window of the game.
3532280	3534720	Like you just swipe your finger back and forth as fast as you can.
3534720	3540440	The good news is Final Fantasy Record Keeper, I think is a lot more the type of Final Fantasy
3540440	3542640	game we frickin' wanted out of a mobile.
3542640	3546520	And this game is going to tickle your nostalgia bone.
3546520	3553240	It's going to do a lot to your nostalgia bone because this game is filled with nostalgia.
3553240	3558240	Meaning that you travel back and forth into different Final Fantasy worlds.
3558240	3562480	And so you'll maybe play a little bit of the Final Fantasy X story, but you're not playing
3562480	3563480	the game itself.
3563480	3569640	You're just fighting monsters in classic Final Fantasy fashion and old bosses.
3569640	3574900	But the party that you use can be made up of characters that you acquired playing Final
3574900	3578360	Fantasy VII memories or Final Fantasy IV memories.
3578360	3582620	So you can mix and match the party in these classic Final Fantasy fights.
3582620	3585620	And, and here's the part that y'all wanted.
3585620	3590740	They made Final Fantasy VII and X, and I don't know, I think XII's in there too.
3590740	3597240	They made them all pixel sprites from the characters to the monsters and bosses, right?
3597240	3599580	But you get all the classic music and all that.
3599580	3602260	So I thought, now it is a free to play game.
3602260	3607060	So they do have some, you know, money elements in it where you can get like better equipment
3607060	3609900	and you can get some other things with a premium currency.
3609900	3613860	But I was pretty impressed with what they give you for the free baseline experience.
3613860	3614860	Oh my Lord.
3614860	3617180	Damn me for having a Windows phone.
3617180	3618180	That sucks.
3618180	3621260	Oh, they'll never come out for that.
3621260	3627060	So yeah, I gotta say, Record Keepers for a Final Fantasy mobile game is pretty cool.
3627060	3628980	It's worth checking out for free.
3628980	3630860	Brianna can download it at least.
3630860	3632180	Let me borrow your phone.
3632180	3633180	Yes.
3633180	3634180	Let me borrow your phone, please.
3634180	3635180	Love it.
3635180	3636180	All right.
3636180	3637180	So that was my gaming week.
3637180	3638180	So quickly, some housekeeping here in studio.

3650260	3651260	All one word.
3651260	3653780	We will get to the frugal question of the week a little later on.
3653780	3659100	And as I'm mentioning every week until it gets here, we will be broadcasting live April
3659100	3660100	11th.

3675080	3678700	And I'm hoping if for whatever reason you miss it, I don't want you to miss it, but
3678700	3682700	if you have to miss it, cause like, you know, I don't know, WrestleMania is next Saturday
3682700	3684580	as well, or two Saturdays now as well.
3684580	3685580	It's today.
3685580	3686580	It's tonight.
3686580	3687580	That's my joke.
3687580	3688580	That's my joke.
3689580	3694700	Uh, we're hoping that you'll be able to later after the fact, go back and like, listen to
3694700	3695700	it.
3695700	3697620	We're going to try to archive it and all that good stuff so you can hear it, but please
3697620	3698620	be there Saturday.
3698620	3699620	Be there live.
3699620	3700620	Darn it.
3700620	3703720	Because just like we interact with you guys during the show, there may be opportunities
3703720	3707900	where you can ask questions in chat and we'll ask who happens to be sitting with us at the
3707900	3708900	moment, those questions.
3708900	3711260	So if you're not here live, you will miss out on that.
3711260	3712420	Will there be loot?
3712420	3713420	Check that out.
3713420	3714420	Will there be loot?
3714420	3715420	Probably.
3715420	3716420	Probably.
3716420	3721060	I'll talk to Bobby about that on a vognetwork.com special loot, uh, available, um, loot in person
3721060	3722060	as well.
3722060	3725740	Right now through vognetwork.com, you can do the whole digital loot.
3725740	3729140	Uh, if you're a member of the site, which is free, we don't charge for that.
3729140	3730140	That's not cool.
3730140	3735060	So you can go there and you get, we're not going to, you can actually get like loot just
3735060	3737780	for participating with the site and checking into shows.
3737780	3741420	If you're listening live, you check in, you get, you know, a little something, something,
3741420	3742420	some points.
3742420	3747500	Uh, and then, um, uh, if you listen to the podcast, there's a word hidden somewhere in
3747500	3748500	the podcast.
3748500	3749620	You can use that on the front page.
3749620	3753860	You can check in and get, uh, points and that often leads to loot.
3753860	3757340	Uh, so yeah, I'm pretty sure we're going to have some type of special loot for the Sac
3757340	3758340	IGDA event.
3758340	3761860	I don't know why we wouldn't, uh, Bobby and I just have to work out the specifics of that
3761860	3762860	for sure.
3762860	3766340	But IRL loot, are there going to be, are there going to be giveaways at the event, the Sac
3766340	3767340	Arcade event?
3767340	3768340	We are.
3768340	3769340	Yeah.
3769340	3770340	Yes.
3770340	3771340	Yes.
3771340	3775660	We are planning that we do have a few, um, we did get a few, uh, uh, price, uh, sponsors.
3775660	3780340	Um, and we are still working on a few more things that I can't just say yet because if
3780340	3782820	it doesn't happen, then I'm going to upset a lot of people.
3782820	3786140	But if it happens, then everyone's going to love us even more than they do now.
3786140	3790260	But yes, we are going to have some giveaways, um, that we're aiming for.
3790260	3795420	And uh, yeah, that's, I mean, I know, I know for sure there may be a couple, there may
3795420	3800740	be for the tournaments, uh, amiibo, uh, yeah, Nintendo amiibo stuff, um, a couple, there's,
3800740	3806620	I think, um, we have, uh, did we receive codes for, um, uh, construct, I think so.
3806620	3807620	Yeah.
3807620	3811980	So, uh, construct was the game, the games of development software, uh, very popular,
3811980	3812980	very popular.
3812980	3816660	So yeah, so there, so we're going to have those as well, but there's still more stuff
3816660	3817660	incoming.
3817660	3818660	So we're good.
3818660	3819660	It's going to be last late minute stuff.
3819660	3820660	I already know it.
3820660	3821660	It's very cool.
3821660	3822660	You know what?
3822660	3824660	Sometimes the best ideas happen that way.
3824900	3825900	All right.
3825900	3826900	Uh, there you go with housekeeping.
3826900	3831380	Let's get into some news and talk about what is going on in the universe of video gaming
3831380	3832540	this week.
3832540	3833540	There's been quite a bit, right?
3833540	3834540	Logie?
3834540	3838420	Color me not surprised, but, um, they made the announcement that Zelda isn't going to
3838420	3840820	make it for 2015.
3840820	3844220	I know I'm totally shocked that they delayed the game.
3844220	3846380	I'm relieved as a game developer.
3846380	3850980	My schedule was around, it was going to be around that between that and star Fox.
3850980	3851980	Forget it.
3851980	3853580	I'm glad because like, good.
3853580	3859220	Now you've given us a reprieve technically, but anyway, I digress basically just reiterating
3859220	3863620	that, um, they're not making it a priority to release it in 2015 and so they're making
3863620	3868380	it a priority to have a quality game, which I don't think anyone's going to argue against
3868380	3869380	that.
3869380	3873200	Um, and then also going on to further say that, you know, at E3 this year, they're going
3873200	3875900	to be showing off games for 2015 only.
3875900	3879820	Well, it's supposedly, we'll see.
3879820	3882620	Well, I am all for Zelda getting delayed.
3882620	3886060	If that's what they have to do to make the game they want to do, then yes, delay it.
3886060	3888140	And we all know you've, you've seen it all around Twitter.
3888140	3893140	The Miyamoto quote about, you know, a bad game is going to be a bad game forever, but
3893140	3894780	a good game, you know, is always going to be a good game.
3894780	3895780	I'm totally paraphrasing.
3895780	3899020	I don't have the exact quote in front of me, but you know, delay it and make a good game
3899020	3900180	that people will remember.
3900180	3901540	That's fine.
3901540	3906520	But the reality is, and as much of a Nintendo fan boys, you might be, you have to realize
3906520	3910120	that was a huge tent pole for Nintendo's 2015 holiday.
3910120	3913440	That was something that was sold me a Wii U.
3913440	3915960	Now I'm not buying a Wii U until that comes out.
3915960	3916960	Right.
3916960	3918720	So what's going to fill in that gap now?
3918720	3921160	And that I imagine is what we'll hear about at E3.
3921160	3922160	Star Fox.
3922160	3924280	I mean, you think maybe they'll bump Star Fox?
3924280	3926360	I thought Star Fox was supposed to be a little sooner than that.
3926360	3927360	Interesting.
3927360	3931820	It was supposed to be a few months before, um, Zelda, but yeah, I mean, but again, I'm
3931820	3933000	completely okay with it.
3933000	3936480	I mean, I, I mean, I foresee definitely Star Fox, but I think they're going to be fine.
3936480	3937800	They're going to come up with another surprise.
3937800	3938800	I just don't know.
3938800	3942880	I, I, my gut tells me it's going to be a mainline Mario game.
3942880	3946240	And I don't know if that means they're going to try to crank out like a 3d land to real
3946240	3947240	quick.
3947240	3952560	I fingers and toes crossed galaxy three, I think is what a lot of us would like to see.
3952560	3953560	Yeah.
3953560	3958760	That's or even, and I'm even willing to go far enough and say, if they want to do a new
3958760	3964720	Mario series, you know, cause the game cube had sunshine, the, we had galaxy, if they
3964720	3967320	were to do a brand new Mario, I think that's fine too.
3967320	3968720	There is Mario maker.
3968720	3970480	That's supposed to be coming this year as well.
3970480	3971480	There's systems.
3971480	3972480	Yeah.
3972480	3976320	I kind of, I kind of put that as a, I mean, that's, I, I'm like that I want to pick that
3976320	3977320	up.
3977320	3980240	I want to buy that, but that's, that's kind of like a more like the kind of something
3980240	3982360	that should be out long before holiday.
3982360	3983360	You know?
3983360	3984360	Yeah, that's true.
3984360	3985360	That's true.
3985360	3989000	So I'm very curious to see, Hey, I'll take an F zero remaster for the Wii U.
3989000	3990000	Thank you.
3990000	3991000	Nintendo.
3991400	3992400	Amen to that.
3992400	3993400	Amen.
3993400	3997000	A remaster like Pikmin two or something dumb like that.
3997000	3998000	I don't know.
3998000	3999000	We'll see.
3999000	4000640	It's what you wanted.
4000640	4001640	You get Pikmin two.
4001640	4002640	No, no.
4002640	4003640	Well, we'll see.
4003640	4004640	We'll see what happens there.
4004640	4010240	Uh, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com dark Tetsuya says, I remember watching the
4010240	4011240	video.
4011240	4014720	I could just sense that they would announce a delay to 2016, but I agree with Miyamoto's
4014720	4017380	philosophy on delayed games.
4017380	4020640	Tiger claw says you think they would make a new super Mario brothers three.
4020640	4022480	I would like to see another in that series.
4022480	4026640	See, I kind of think that's the gap that Mario maker fills.
4026640	4030280	I think something, you know, you know, cause Mario is a huge universe.
4030280	4031280	Obviously.
4031280	4035000	I think something in the 3d Mario space would be great, but we'll, we'll see.
4035000	4037960	Well, Mario 3d world was spectacular.
4037960	4042840	It definitely falls into prob, probably my top 10 of all time for sure.
4042840	4049160	Because, because that, because I mean, not since Mario world and Mario 64 has a Mario
4049160	4050160	game blown me away.
4050160	4051920	Like, like, yeah, I love galaxy.
4051920	4052920	They'll give me one.
4052920	4056040	I can, I just have to say, I can tell you're from Jersey cause you say Mario and I don't
4056040	4058480	hear that outside of east coast.
4058480	4064680	I apologize to the English language for my vowel misrepresentation, but yeah, I mean,
4064680	4068200	but yeah, Mario sunshine galaxy, not to discredit those games.
4068200	4075360	Those games were beautiful, wonderful games, but Marrow 3d world literally brought back
4075360	4078800	what was missing completely from a Mario game.
4078800	4079800	Not then.
4079800	4080800	So yeah.
4080800	4083800	You know, so I can see that I can definitely see it, but if they're going to do a new super
4083800	4089600	Mario brothers game, they need to really change it up because that Wii U one, yeah, it was
4089600	4092960	pretty, but it was really just a remake of the Wii version.
4092960	4095600	So again, I think Mario maker is going to fill that gap.
4095600	4099280	I don't think we need to have two of those in a year, but I mean, I, I wouldn't complain.
4099280	4101040	I'm not going to talk bad about it.
4101040	4106000	Does that mean we'll get a third Mario amiibo that everyone's going to like cream themselves
4106000	4107000	over?
4107000	4108760	I mean, seriously, be careful what you wish for.
4108760	4110840	Well, technically there are three already.
4110840	4111840	Don't forget.
4111840	4112840	There's the gold one.
4112840	4115680	Oh, well that's totally different than the other one.
4115680	4120680	I mean, they didn't just slap paint on it or here's, here's what hasn't happened yet.
4120680	4126120	And you know, it's going to happen is good use for those amiibos pipe down salty man.
4126120	4129680	I'm talking about pixelated amiibo.
4129720	4132740	There's pixel Mario and pixel Luigi.
4132740	4134240	You know that it'll happen.
4134240	4135240	Oh, no.
4135240	4136800	It, you know, it shake your head all you want.
4136800	4137800	You know, it's coming.
4137800	4138800	Bring it.
4138800	4143920	They're going to, if they're, they're taking a page out of the Activision playbook, milk
4143920	4146440	that shit till it's dry.
4146440	4148120	All right.
4148120	4154600	I'm moving on some other information coming out of Nintendo and that is a splatoon splatoon.
4154600	4155600	Let's not forget.
4155600	4158960	That's a game that's coming out before the holiday over the summer.
4158960	4162920	I think if some of the Facebook posts are to be listened to, but they're talking about
4162920	4168400	that splatoon is going to do for action shooters, what Mario Kart did for racing.
4168400	4172480	At least that's what Reggie Fils-Aime said, saying, quote, it's aiming to do for action
4172480	4175440	shooters, what Mario Kart did for racing.
4175440	4178360	Also saying it's a major new IP for Nintendo.
4178360	4180360	The game is not just about kills.
4180360	4183600	It's supposed to be fun no matter what your skill level is.
4183600	4187480	So we'll see more about, you know, the fun factor when the game is released.
4187520	4193720	That's going to be a fun game period because I've seen so many videos of that and yeah.
4193720	4200080	It's very refreshing to see Nintendo finally bring us something new, new, new.
4200080	4202040	It just looks insanely fun though.
4202040	4207240	I kind of love the idea of, you know, Nintendo kind of realized, oh yeah, like shit loads
4207240	4210120	of people are playing Halo and Destiny.
4210120	4212920	How can, how can we kind of put our own spin on that?
4212920	4215200	And I think that's what you're seeing with this.
4215280	4219320	And I think more importantly with something like Splatoon, I think we talked about on
4219320	4224440	a previous episode, Splatoon is being developed by like a younger team, you know, a greener
4224440	4226240	team at Nintendo.
4226240	4230280	And so this is really a chance for them to say, you know, we're going to do our own thing
4230280	4231280	and here it is.
4231280	4234840	And I think wasn't it the same team that did Animal Crossing, which ended up being huge?
4234840	4238520	I want, I want to say, I want to say yes, but yeah, I'm not sure.
4238520	4242440	So anyway, I'm just excited to see, you know, what they put together, fourth quarter game
4242440	4243440	right there.
4243560	4245600	You know, Splatoon is supposed to be out sooner than that.
4245600	4247040	No, no, no, no, no.
4247040	4248600	Animal Crossing.
4248600	4249800	I fucking hope so.
4249800	4250800	I'm sorry.
4250800	4255400	I know some of y'all are over it, but if they, especially if they can kind of do something
4255400	4260200	new with it, like that's my one wish for Animal Crossing is I really need to see them do something
4260200	4261200	new.
4261200	4263200	I want Isabelle the rampage.
4263200	4266080	You want to see a Splatoon crossover.
4266080	4267540	I want Isabelle to go postal.
4267540	4272120	So you want Isabelle as a character in Splatoon, except her paint gun is replaced with an actual
4272120	4273120	gun.
4273120	4282600	As long as Tom Nook does not get her revenge through public works.
4282600	4284360	She'll just build a bench on you.
4284360	4288800	One thing that might be a bummer for some people is that Splatoon will not have voice
4288800	4289800	chat.
4289800	4292720	It has been confirmed and you know, rumors are going around about this, but it was confirmed
4292720	4293720	this week.
4293720	4295480	Splatoon will not have voice chat.
4295480	4299680	So you cannot communicate with your teammates online unless, I don't know, you do a Skype
4299680	4300680	thing.
4300680	4303520	I know a lot of people that when they play the Nintendo stuff, they just have Skype on
4303520	4307880	their mobile phone and so I don't know, but for whatever reason they've decided not to
4307880	4308880	implement that.
4308880	4313640	It's too bad they couldn't tie like voice chat to, I don't know, some sort of parental
4313640	4315640	settings or something that are on the console.
4315640	4317360	I mean, they have that, right?
4317360	4318360	They can do that.
4318360	4320080	That would be very forward thinking.
4320080	4325080	Yeah, it's not, it's not heavily utilized and I, and I honestly, I don't blame Nintendo
4325080	4329080	for the voice chat thing because let's face it, look at what happened with Microsoft when
4329080	4332620	they, when they created the party chat idea.
4332620	4336160	Everyone went bonkers over, oh my God, we could chat with our own people and not have
4336160	4338000	to worry about talking with others.
4338000	4340800	But unfortunately that's exactly what happened.
4340800	4345720	And now no one hears anybody at all anymore when they play multiplayer because they're
4345720	4346720	in a party.
4346720	4347720	They're in a party chat.
4347720	4350360	That actually raises a good point.
4350360	4354040	Like when I played Destiny, when I played Destiny, it was all about party chat.
4354040	4357320	You didn't, I mean, I think that's part of why they didn't even put voice chat.
4357560	4361720	And remember voice chat isn't in Destiny if you randomly connect with people.
4361720	4365840	And I think that was probably half the whole, you know, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck
4365840	4367560	you factor for some people.
4367560	4368560	Right.
4368560	4373520	And much more colorful language coming out of those mouths and half the factor of people
4373520	4375440	are playing in party mode anyway.
4375440	4376440	Yup.
4376440	4377440	That's true.
4377440	4381040	And I, and I, and with this being on Nintendo, yeah, the last thing you need is a, is a 10
4381040	4383040	year old on Nintendo.
4383040	4387160	You hear it on Halo, Call of Duty, that's fine, but you don't hear parents getting all
4387200	4388200	upset about it.
4388200	4390520	But if they hear it on a Nintendo game, it'll be on the phone.
4390520	4391520	It'll be on the nightly news.
4391520	4395000	It'll be on Fox 40 tonight.
4395000	4398160	Little kid hears fuck while playing Splatoon, film at 11.
4398160	4399160	First time ever.
4399160	4400160	Who cares?
4400160	4405160	That, that's why, why bother paying attention to your news channel if that's the kind of
4405160	4406160	news that they're reporting.
4406160	4410640	I mean, it's like, Bob took a shit today, you know, news at six.
4410640	4411640	It's like, who gives a fuck?
4411640	4414600	Did he flush find out tonight at seven?
4414600	4416640	People do this stuff all the time.
4416640	4419400	It's like, I don't understand why any of this is news.
4419400	4420400	It's America.
4420400	4422140	That's why people watch it.
4422140	4423140	That's America.
4423140	4425760	That's why Jamie just has this look of disgust.
4425760	4430200	It was, no, it wasn't that it was just a line from Arthur popped in my head.
4430200	4431520	I think I'll take a bath.
4431520	4435480	I'll alert the media.
4435480	4437440	You all remember that movie, right?
4437440	4438440	You went there.
4438440	4439440	Talk about old school.
4439440	4440440	Talk about old school.
4440440	4441440	All right.
4441440	4442520	My mom's favorite movie next to Fiddler on the Roof.
4442520	4446920	Uh, I was going to say, I was going to say, she's surprised her daughter's a Jew now.
4446920	4447920	Okay.
4447920	4450320	I was going to say, aren't they going to remake Arthur?
4450320	4452560	And then I remembered they did remake Arthur.
4452560	4454280	It's just, it was awful.
4454280	4455280	Anyway.
4455280	4456280	All right.
4456280	4457280	Yeah.
4457280	4458280	Moving on.
4458280	4459280	Speaking of watching movies, dark soccer.
4459280	4466360	Well, I do have something for fans of, of the walking dead, I guess.
4466360	4469740	Um, and who have PlayStations.
4469740	4475580	If you are a PlayStation view subscriber, you get AMC, which didn't they play all the
4475580	4478460	black and white movies and then they decided that they were going to be relevant?
4478460	4479460	Yup.
4479460	4480460	Yes they did.
4480460	4481460	Yeah, they did actually.
4481460	4482980	This is supposed to be American movie classics.
4482980	4487140	This is where I used to watch Orson Welles presenting War of the Worlds.
4487140	4491940	Actually what happened, Jamie, we got older and then suddenly movies like Pretty Woman
4491940	4496180	are a classic and it's like, shit, when did I get old?
4496180	4500620	Or like, you know, you listen to classic rock and it's like that song by Aerosmith
4500620	4502380	that everybody's sung in high school.
4502380	4504780	Living on the edge, you can't.
4504780	4505780	It's like, wait a minute, wait a minute.
4505780	4506860	This is classic rock now.
4506860	4507860	Hold up, hold up.
4507860	4508860	I ain't that old.
4508860	4509860	Oops.
4509860	4510860	Yes I am.
4510860	4511860	Yes we are.
4511860	4515540	I wanted to cry when I was in Alabama listening to one of the classic rock stations and they
4515540	4518540	played gorillas.
4518540	4524260	I wanted, I wanted to find a possum cause it's the south.
4524260	4528220	I wanted to find a possum and kick it.
4528220	4531740	Take this possum, that's for gorillas.
4531740	4537020	So anyway, they've got different access packages that are going to come up.
4537020	4544500	It also includes IFC, Sundance, WeTV, and it's, right now it's only available in New
4544500	4547060	York, Philadelphia, and Chicago.
4547060	4550740	So you get the three ones, which is Access Core and Elite.
4550740	4555340	Access has 50 different channels, I'm not naming them all, except they have food networks.
4555340	4556340	That's pretty awesome.
4556340	4558340	For 50 bucks a month and then you get access.
4558340	4559980	You can never watch enough Chopped.
4559980	4561980	You can never watch enough Chopped.
4561980	4562980	Okay.
4562980	4565140	Do you want to know what my porn crack is?
4565140	4566140	What?
4566140	4569340	Watching a cooking show while eating.
4569340	4573820	That's kind of like me, except I like to watch NBC's The Biggest Loser while eating Ben and
4573820	4576660	Jerry's and then I cry and I don't know why.
4576660	4579860	I can't watch that show because I found out what they do to those poor people.
4579860	4580860	It's pretty bad.
4580860	4581860	I can't support that show.
4581860	4582860	I choose to be ignorant.
4582860	4584860	Do they turn them into meat at the end?
4584860	4586860	No, that's not how the sausage is made.
4586860	4587860	Okay.
4587860	4593220	Anyway, the last package is going to be like 70 bucks a month and there's actually a thing
4593220	4598260	about it on Wired if people want to find out the plus and minuses, but AMC will be involved
4598260	4599460	in all of the channels.
4599460	4602820	PlayStation Vue is on PS3 and PS4.
4602820	4603820	You know what?
4603820	4604820	I've never watched Walking Dead.
4604820	4605820	I have a story about Walking Dead.
4605820	4609220	Could that be because Walking Dead is on Sunday nights and we kind of do something else on
4609220	4610220	Sunday nights?
4610220	4611220	I have a story about that though.
4611220	4612220	What?
4612220	4613220	About my mother.
4613220	4614220	Okay.
4614220	4616500	I'm going to do my mom voice.
4616500	4619340	You know, I thought that Walking Dead show was going to be kind of stupid, so I said
4619340	4620980	I wasn't going to watch it.
4620980	4625780	And then I was watching something with Michael, her husband, and I was like, hey, this is
4625780	4626780	pretty good.
4626780	4627780	What is it?
4627780	4628780	He's like, Walking Dead.
4628780	4632180	Well, shit.
4632180	4634740	And that's my story that my mom told me while I was in Alabama.
4634740	4635740	Bravo.
4635740	4636740	Here's my thing though.
4636740	4637740	AMC kind of needs a new show.
4638260	4642420	Look, I'm not trying to insult the Walking Dead fans out there, but how much time does
4642420	4643420	your show have left?
4643420	4646260	Because pretty soon everybody's going to be dead.
4646260	4647660	But they're still going to be walking.
4647660	4652260	No, it's just going to be What's His Face.
4652260	4654060	Looking all angry and rednecky.
4654060	4655060	Awesome.
4655060	4658060	With a gun, sitting on top of a pile of zombies.
4658060	4659060	Go ahead.
4659060	4660060	Bring it.
4660060	4663500	No, because now you'll be able to play him in Silent Hills, assuming that is still happening.
4663500	4664500	And I want E3 to clarify.
4664500	4665500	Silent Hills.
4666260	4670260	I need Konami to clarify some things, please.
4670260	4671260	All right.
4671260	4673260	Anyway, it'll be on the gambling machine.
4673260	4674260	Sorry.
4674260	4676700	I don't think I talked about that yet.
4676700	4677700	I talked about it on Bobby's show.
4677700	4678700	I talked about it here.
4678700	4682020	I was in Reno over the weekend, just on an impromptu trip.
4682020	4683020	Trip.
4683020	4684020	Trick.
4684020	4685020	Oh, shit.
4685020	4686020	Uh oh.
4686020	4687020	No.
4687020	4688020	Trip.
4688020	4689020	That's how he got his gambling money.
4689020	4692020	Guess who's paid for dinner tonight, y'all?
4692020	4693020	Anyway.
4693020	4694020	Wow.
4694540	4701380	So I went up there on an impromptu trip, and I was playing some nerdy machines, because
4701380	4705740	I saw a Jenga machine, and I was like, that reminds me of Gamer X. I'm playing Jenga.
4705740	4710900	But then I saw a Dungeons & Dragons slot machine, and I was like, oh my god, they're coming
4710900	4711900	after nerds.
4711900	4712900	They're trying to get nerds to get old people.
4712900	4713900	Oh my god.
4713900	4714900	Old people don't know what this is.
4714900	4715900	Yeah.
4715900	4716900	They're gonna think it's the devil.
4716900	4718740	Except here's the problem, Loki.
4718740	4722620	Dungeons & Dragons was in the 70s, and so there's a lot of people who you would call
4722620	4727340	quote unquote old people that were our age when Dungeons & Dragons came out, so...
4727340	4728340	Mm-hmm.
4728340	4729860	I'm talking about really old people.
4729860	4734540	I'm talking about people that would have been, you know, playing Dungeons & Dragons.
4734540	4735540	People older than that.
4735540	4736540	Oh, okay.
4736540	4738500	Like people that voted for the governor of Indiana.
4738500	4739500	Like that type of thing.
4739500	4740500	Oh boy.
4740500	4742900	Gotta throw a little shade while I can.
4742900	4743900	All right, anyway.
4743900	4747740	I didn't say misinformed, I said older.
4747740	4748740	Buzzing.
4748740	4755700	All right, anyway, so the Dungeons & Dragons machine made by Konami, I didn't even notice
4755700	4756700	that.
4756700	4760300	I tweeted about it, and somebody replied to my tweet saying, Konami frown.
4760300	4762940	And I was like, oh my god, it is a Konami game.
4762940	4768340	So this is, they've let Kojima go to make Dungeons & Dragons slot machines.
4768340	4769340	Yep.
4769340	4770340	I guess there's money to be made there.
4770340	4771340	All right, anyway.
4771340	4772340	I digress.
4772340	4773540	Loki, what else is in the news tonight?
4773540	4776340	I've gone from walking dead to gambling.
4776340	4781020	So hey look, Twitch had a security breach, and passwords and stuff came out, so they
4781020	4785260	reset your password, and is anyone shocked by this?
4785260	4788340	Major website has a security breach.
4788340	4790540	Loki, it's the internet.
4790540	4795420	Things I put in the internet should be safe, because it's interneted.
4795420	4798500	Yes, that's correct.
4798500	4800700	That's how the internet works.
4800700	4805620	The good thing though is they basically said, hey, you know what, well I don't know if it's
4805620	4806900	good.
4806900	4813260	Their quote was, there may have been a little bit of an unauthorized access to some of your
4813260	4817260	Twitch user account information, including the possibility of your Twitch username, associated
4817260	4821740	email address, your password, the last IP you logged in from, maybe some limited credit
4821740	4828820	card information, card type, card number expiration, and some of the following, first, last name,
4828820	4832580	phone number, address, date of birth, if you put that stuff in there.
4832580	4837700	But hey, it's a good thing we don't store the full credit card number.
4837700	4842820	But your passwords were protected.
4842820	4847420	In the cloud probably, because Amazon owns it now, so it's in their cloud technology.
4847420	4851020	That's a good point.
4851020	4855340	But your credit card number's all safe in the cloud, everything's in the cloud.
4855340	4857780	Nobody bad will get in the cloud.
4857780	4861220	But they reset it, so you have to go do that.
4861220	4866020	My thing is, I forget what my Twitch name is on there anyways, because I use it so frequently.
4866020	4873780	Well, I'm Rob Roberts on Twitch, that's easy enough to find, but I was going to say, yeah,
4873780	4879220	they made you reset your password, so there's that whole thing, but this is just your weekly
4879220	4882340	reminder at this point, because it seems like we have one of these stories every week these
4882340	4886920	days, but this is your weekly reminder, use different passwords on different websites.
4886920	4894480	Use an app like what was 1Password or some of those, if that helps you out at all.
4894480	4897520	And two-step authentication would be nice.
4897520	4899200	Two-step authentication, always smart.
4899200	4900760	Which I don't think they have.
4900760	4902480	No, I don't think they do.
4902480	4906360	Not yet, but maybe that'll come soon, who knows, so you might need it.
4906360	4913240	All right, well, moving on, talking a little something different here about region locking.
4913240	4917640	We talk a lot about region locking on OLR, and basically it all boils down to, why do
4917640	4919120	they still do this shit?
4919120	4923720	It is on the internet, I can download it from anywhere, I want people from Finland to download
4923720	4925600	my demo.
4925600	4927480	Is there a reason to region lock Crumple?
4927480	4930480	Hey, bro, is there a reason you might want to region lock that?
4930480	4931480	No.
4931480	4932480	Yeah.
4932480	4937520	It's not like there's any text or anything like that other than the title, where it's
4937520	4938680	like, what is it saying?
4938680	4940200	I don't know what it's saying.
4940200	4946880	Or complex and antiquated rights, music, laws that would maybe prevent that.
4946880	4947880	You don't have any of that.
4947880	4949720	I wrote the music for it.
4949720	4952560	Let it go around the world, I beg it to.
4952560	4956960	That someone's not going to copyright strike that for some reason.
4956960	4961480	My thought, though, is that they do have a lot of different, especially when you get
4961480	4966840	on a console or something, where you have to submit your game to these different organizations
4966840	4968280	that do the ratings and stuff like that.
4968280	4970000	It costs money to do that.
4970000	4974800	I don't know how that works as far as if we just made it region-free, because obviously
4974800	4979120	it's worked for Sony for the last few generations.
4979120	4986020	Well, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PSP, and Vita.
4986020	4989800	So they haven't really had any problems there, so I don't know how to get around it.
4989800	4991720	This could be something that could affect Nacho.
4991720	4995240	We're talking about games, but it goes even beyond that.
4995240	4997800	And this could be very interesting if this pans out.
4997800	5002700	The European Commission, apparently, this week said they want to remove regional limits
5002700	5004400	on digital goods.
5004400	5009240	And one of the things they're looking at that's specifically cited is watching US Netflix
5009240	5014540	from the United Kingdom, because you know a lot of other countries want the US Netflix
5014540	5016800	because we have more stuff.
5016800	5019640	Granted, I want to say sometimes, though, it's the other way around, too.
5019640	5021000	They have things we don't have.
5021000	5026480	Some of the BBC shows, I know, though, the BBC website used to have a lot of their content
5026480	5027480	region-locked.
5028080	5033120	And they unlocked all of it, so for TV shows that are on, you know, TV over there.
5033120	5034120	Yeah.
5034120	5038480	It's just sad that it takes Europeans, once again, not Americans, Europeans, it takes
5038480	5040080	them to start this.
5040080	5042200	I don't care where it starts, as long as it...
5042200	5044200	But it's like, we should be doing this.
5044200	5049400	It's like, we talk all this smack about ourselves, you know, our egotistical ways, you know,
5049400	5053720	the country's egotistical ways, and yet we, you know, hear the Europeans beating us again.
5053720	5057440	I actually had someone I went to high school with unfriend me because I sent her the link
5057440	5059600	about how many things we are no longer number one in.
5059600	5060600	Oh!
5060600	5061600	Well...
5061600	5064920	But I have my big foam finger, this is we're number one.
5064920	5071520	But is there such a thing as, like, Japanese television, Netflix, because I want that.
5071520	5072520	There isn't.
5072520	5073520	I think Korea does, though.
5073520	5074720	I think Korea has something like that.
5074720	5077920	I want, like, Tekashi's Castle, all the episodes.
5077920	5079840	I just want the Jdrama channel.
5079840	5082880	Well, anyway, it might start in Europe.
5082880	5086680	And again, this is maybe, this is just a new strategy that's being outlined called the
5086680	5088720	Digital Single Market.
5088720	5093800	This will prevent companies from geo-blocking online services when it's not truly necessary.
5093800	5097560	Now see, that's a gray term to me, and that's what's going to take a while to figure out
5097560	5099400	what is necessary.
5099400	5103360	But the type of arbitrary limit would not be able to exist in a single European Union-wide
5103360	5105080	digital marketplace.
5105080	5111160	So more information supposedly coming in May when the full strategy is due.
5111160	5114920	But yeah, you would not have to, you would not get locked out.
5114920	5118760	You could watch French Netflix while you're in Germany, whatever.
5118760	5120320	That is all going to be the European Union.
5120320	5124100	Now, keep in mind, because it's the European Union, that isn't necessarily going to have
5124100	5126200	an impact on us in America.
5126200	5130000	But again, if we start hearing about all the good shit they have over there, one thing
5130000	5132920	Americans are really good at is complaining.
5132920	5137960	So we're going to start complaining to Netflix in droves, well, I can't hear you.
5137960	5138960	You raised my prices.
5138960	5141040	There's a fly in my soup.
5141040	5142040	You raised my prices.
5142040	5143880	Give me European content.
5143880	5146920	So that is one, but we are number one in complaining.
5146920	5148960	I don't think anybody's going to dispute me there.
5148960	5149960	Nope.
5149960	5150960	All right.
5150960	5156040	Anyhow, just an interesting statistic that goes along with that, that might explain why
5156040	5158200	this is happening, by the way.
5158200	5169200	9% of console games sold digitally in 2014, 58% of PC games sold digitally in 2014.
5169200	5176800	Now that's Germany, and that's the second biggest video game market after the UK.
5176800	5181800	But you've got to think, those numbers probably aren't drastically different here in the U.S.
5181800	5183400	I don't imagine so.
5183400	5188320	Especially when you see how the PC shelf space is shrinking at a place like GameStop.
5188320	5190440	I wonder if it's higher here.
5190440	5196680	And how many people, like Loki over here, with how many games on his Steam account alone.
5196680	5199860	So I saw that yesterday when we were doing a game jam.
5199860	5205320	One of my guys, Nicholas, he pulled up his Steam account, and I swore I saw probably
5205320	5206320	200 plus games.
5206320	5208040	I'm like, have you played all of these?
5208040	5209040	Like, nope.
5209040	5211520	I'm embarrassed to bring mine up.
5211520	5212680	I would not want to show.
5212680	5213680	I'm not going to show you.
5213680	5216400	If you ask me, I'm going to say, no, some things are private, and you shouldn't be asked
5216400	5217400	about it.
5217400	5218400	My Steam library is one of them.
5218400	5221780	My PlayStation Network account's starting to get like that too now.
5221780	5225120	It's getting pretty, with the crazy sales they're doing too.
5225120	5226120	It's something else.
5226560	5230560	Anyhow, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
5230560	5236240	Well, we haven't really given our friends in the UK, except for just now, of course.
5236240	5240120	You know, in the past, normally the UK was sort of my big thing.
5240120	5246800	There is a study out now about UK children and what they're doing that makes them pretty
5246800	5247800	lazy.
5247800	5254360	UK children are spending six hours a day in front of a screen, on average.
5254360	5260640	And this isn't necessarily just like TV, but it includes TV, playing video games, using
5260640	5263780	a mobile device, a personal computer, or a tablet.
5263780	5270960	And this was based off of a survey of 2,000 children between 5 and 16.
5270960	5274600	It's called the Connected Kids Report.
5274600	5281060	So basically, it's actually, teenage girls are spending about seven and a half hours
5281060	5286060	watching the screens, compared with 3.5 hours of TV viewing in 1995.
5286060	5292180	And boys spend longer times, up to eight hours, in front of screens.
5292180	5296820	So they clearly don't work in a call center.
5296820	5303580	And then, love video games, where we spend 12 hours in front of the screen, but...
5303580	5304580	Only?
5304580	5305580	Only.
5305580	5306580	Jeez.
5306580	5307580	No, seriously.
5307580	5310020	But basically, the big thing...
5310020	5313740	One of these days, Dark Soccer, if somebody's gonna do something crazy, like create this
5313740	5318180	headset where you just strap the screen right in front of your space, and the screen moves
5318180	5319180	with you everywhere you go.
5319180	5321100	Fox News at 6.
5321100	5325180	VR headsets will make you blind, because the screen's in front of you.
5325180	5327340	No, it's gonna be the game in Star Trek, The Next Generation.
5327340	5332340	They're gonna play a clip of some old woman, or whatever, from a long time ago.
5332340	5335620	If you sit so close to the screen, you'll go blind!
5335620	5336740	There's my proof right there.
5336740	5338220	It's gonna make people blind.
5338220	5339220	Then it's gonna end.
5339220	5340220	Thanks, Obama.
5340220	5341860	But we digress.
5341860	5346540	Anyway, the big thing is that they're saying that TV is actually less important to children
5346540	5351740	who are using their DVR services more, and they pay for Netflix and YouTube.
5351740	5357900	They watch that much more than actual television, than broadcast television.
5357900	5363300	And another thing that was reported to the BBC is that the internet has become, basically,
5363300	5365980	their biggest source of information.
5366740	5374540	Now I will pause this in saying that I went over to my friend Becky's house last night
5374540	5384460	to find that Julian plays an MMORPG, made for kids, called Pirate101.
5384460	5388660	And he's talking about, yeah, I need to do this or else my damage will decrease, and
5388660	5394500	I'm like, blink blink, you're gonna be playing WoW before too long.
5394500	5397460	But I mean, it's the same thing.
5397460	5403060	When I was seven, I was playing games in the 80s on my Nintendo.
5403060	5404060	Same diff.
5404060	5405060	Same thing.
5405060	5407780	As you know, when I was seven, I was playing the ColecoVision.
5407780	5412100	And I was getting yelled at by my mother, Rab, you're sitting too close to the TV, Rab.
5412100	5415780	But I'm like, that's the only way I'm gonna actually be able to shoot the ducks, is to
5415780	5417460	get right in front of the damn TV.
5417460	5418460	Oh, no no no no.
5418460	5422380	My mom was like, you're too close to the TV, what, can you not see it?
5422380	5424420	And then, you know, three years later I get glasses.
5424420	5429260	Because I'm nearsighted, I was like, well gee, mom, maybe that should have been your
5429260	5430260	first clue.
5430260	5433800	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games
5433800	5435900	ruining vision near you.
5435900	5436900	First in America, Loki.
5436900	5445460	Yeah, so now we have one of the first expansions for Sims 4, Sims 4, get back to work!
5445460	5446460	I don't want to.
5446460	5447460	On PC.
5447460	5450540	Story of Seasons on 3DS.
5450540	5454340	On PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, they're kind of doing a bundle from Square Enix, they've
5454340	5459980	got Just Cause, Sleeping Dogs, and Tomb Raider bundled together for $29.99, and that's the
5459980	5464660	ultimate action triple pack, because, you know, they've got to race off some of those
5464660	5467460	old discs.
5467460	5476460	Toa Kidin, Kowami on Vita, and we've got MLB 15 the Show on Vita, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation
5476460	5483380	4, as well as the MLB The Show 10th Anniversary Edition on PlayStation 4 as well.
5483380	5491300	Also the Ultimate Stealth Pack, which is another compilation by Square Enix, including Thief,
5491300	5495260	Hitman, and Deus Ex.
5495260	5499300	And then we've got RBI Baseball 15 on PC.
5499300	5503060	What else do we have here?
5503060	5504060	Lots of baseball.
5504060	5506300	It's all being released at the same time.
5507140	5508140	Let's see.
5508140	5510020	Oh, that'll be it, actually.
5510020	5511020	We end with baseball.
5511020	5512020	Alright, fair enough.
5512020	5515420	Well, let's travel over to Japan, and I'm going to start off with a whopper here, because
5515420	5522560	on April 2nd, Loki, listen up, Earth Defense Force is 4.1, the Shadow of New Despair comes
5522560	5525780	out of Japan on April 2nd on the PlayStation 4.
5525780	5526780	Do not say that.
5526780	5528460	That is one of my...
5528460	5534980	Oh, you two should be besties, because he talks about that all the time, Earth Defense
5534980	5535980	Force.
5536660	5537740	I even got Brianna into that game.
5537740	5542940	She was, you know, yeah, ee-dee, yeah, ee-dee, yeah, ee-dee, text message, yeah, yeah, just
5542940	5543940	incredible.
5543940	5544940	Oh, my God.
5544940	5547340	I saw the trailer for, wait, is that only for PlayStation?
5547340	5550020	That is on PlayStation 4, at least in Japan.
5550020	5554900	Remember, I'm reading Japanese release dates, so that's coming out of Japan, but PS4 region
5554900	5555900	free, right?
5555900	5556900	Or no?
5556900	5557900	Yes.
5557900	5558900	Uh-oh.
5558900	5559900	Uh-oh.
5559900	5560900	Well.
5560900	5561900	Oh, boy.
5561900	5565460	I was going to get a PS4 today, and I didn't, and I had to change my mind.
5565940	5567540	They'll eventually release it over here, just...
5567540	5568540	No, no, no, I can't wait.
5568540	5570260	No, it's Earth Defense Force.
5570260	5571260	I will import that game.
5571260	5572260	I understand.
5572260	5573260	I understand.
5573260	5576780	Lego Batman 3, also seeing a release in Japan this week.
5576780	5579980	I'm going to check the Xbox One for you, but I don't see...
5579980	5581460	No, it was only on PlayStation 4.
5581460	5583100	Yeah, I don't see Earth Defense Force there.
5583100	5586940	I do see Dark Souls 2 on April 9th, but that's on the Xbox One.
5586940	5590580	But that Earth Defense Force game is just an upgrade of, you know, 2048 or whatever
5590580	5592460	the last one was that they had come out.
5592460	5593460	Yep, 2025.
5593460	5594460	2025.
5594460	5595460	That's close enough.
5595460	5601980	So, I mean, that's good, but I really wanted just a new Earth Defense Force game.
5601980	5603580	Well, maybe you will.
5603580	5604580	Maybe you will.
5604580	5610300	On the PlayStation 3 in Japan this week, Dai 3G Super Robot Taisen Z Tengoku Hen comes
5610300	5612740	out this week from Bandai Namco, who makes...
5612740	5614220	That's a series that will never die.
5614220	5615220	I was going to say, yeah.
5615220	5616620	Makes those games all the time.
5616620	5617620	All the time.
5617620	5623540	On the Wii U this week, we have Lego Batman 3 on the Wii U, as well as Rodea the Sky Soldier
5623620	5625860	comes out on the Wii U this week.
5625860	5630620	And on the handheld systems this week, on the Vita, we have that same Dai 3G Super Robot
5630620	5637020	Taisen, and we also have Norn 9, Norn plus Nonet Last Era comes out on the Vita this
5637020	5638020	week.
5638020	5641860	And lastly, but not leastly, on the 3DS this week, that Lego Batman game is out there as
5641860	5642860	well.
5642860	5646340	Some new cover plates, just to rub it in a little bit, which you will not be seeing ever
5646340	5649420	in the States, because they won't release that little 3DS here.
5649420	5653340	But if you're in Japan, you can get some Zelda and Xenoblade face plates for your new
5653340	5654340	3DS.
5654340	5655340	Oh, God.
5655340	5658980	Xenoblade also getting its Japanese release this week on April the 2nd.
5658980	5660860	That's kind of a big deal.
5660860	5670020	Also Terra Formars, Akaki Hoshi no Gekitou comes out, and one more from Capcom here.
5670020	5671620	That was impressive, by the way, dude.
5671620	5672620	What's that?
5672620	5673620	That was impressive.
5673620	5674620	I was like...
5674620	5675620	How you read that?
5675620	5676620	That was good.
5676620	5677620	Bless your hearts.
5677620	5680940	After all these years, it's finally happened.
5680940	5683260	Somebody has complimented my Japanese.
5683260	5684260	I never...
5684260	5685260	I just need a moment.
5685260	5686260	I'd like to make all...
5686260	5687700	How you fill in the klempt?
5687700	5688700	A little bit.
5688700	5689700	A little bit.
5689700	5695100	Gaya Kuten Saiben 5 also gets a price reduction.
5695100	5696100	You know that is, right?
5696100	5697100	Actually, I don't.
5697100	5698100	Ace Attorney.
5698100	5699100	Is it?
5699100	5700100	Oh, it is.
5700100	5701100	No kidding.
5701100	5702100	Phoenix Wright.
5702100	5703100	There it is.
5703100	5705100	So that gets a little price reduction if you need to catch up on that in Japan this week.
5705100	5706100	There you go.
5706100	5707100	That's it for Japan.
5707100	5708100	How about the UK, DarkSakura?
5708100	5714980	On the 30th, as I mentioned last week, Bloodsportz.tv on PC, 31st Neverwinter for Xbone.
5714980	5716420	I'm sorry, Xbox One.
5716420	5719780	April 1st, Pool Nation FX.
5719780	5724620	Let me go to actually official April now.
5724620	5727900	On the 2nd, we have Xenoblade Chronicles for 3DS.
5727900	5733060	On the 3rd, Dark Souls II, Scholar of the First Sin on Damn Near Everything.
5733060	5734060	And that's it.
5734060	5735060	All right.
5735060	5738420	Just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.
5738420	5740740	We're gonna run through these quickly for time, Loki.
5740740	5742100	I wasn't looking up.
5742100	5743620	Oh, there it is.
5743620	5744860	Ooh, $59.99.
5744860	5745860	That's not too bad.
5745860	5746860	Loki, news, news.
5746860	5747860	Sorry.
5747860	5748860	Distracted.
5748860	5753900	So anyways, this is pretty cool if you live in Russia.
5753900	5758520	You can actually play Halo Online, much like they did Call of Duty Online.
5758520	5764060	Now they have an online-only version of Halo where you can play multiplayer games and it's
5764060	5765100	free to play.
5765100	5768420	That's pretty awesome.
5768420	5772100	It is running on a modified version of the Halo 3 engine.
5772100	5775700	And I guess it's supposed to take place on the secret UNSC space installation called
5775700	5778180	Anvil.
5778180	5779180	Looks pretty awesome.
5779180	5780500	Too bad they'll never ever come over here.
5780500	5784380	Uh, I would hope maybe it's being tested and maybe we could see it here.
5784380	5785860	Why did they pick Russia though?
5785860	5787860	That's what I don't understand.
5787860	5789660	Same thing happened with Call of Duty Online.
5789660	5791620	It never came out over here either and that's in China.
5791620	5792620	That's true.
5792620	5794140	And Civilization Online is in China only.
5794140	5795780	I tried playing Call of Duty Online.
5795780	5796780	Did you?
5796780	5801860	It's awesome because it was all the Call of Duty 1 and 2 maps with the Call of Duty Modern
5801860	5802860	Warfare 3.
5802860	5807860	Or I'm sorry, the Modern Warfare 1 and 2 maps with the Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 engine
5807860	5809860	and weapons.
5809860	5812300	So is Halo a super big deal in Russia?
5812300	5813300	We're just not aware?
5813300	5814300	I don't know.
5814300	5817860	Yeah, I mean because we know Starcraft and Korea.
5817860	5819060	We know how they roll.
5820060	5822060	They release Dynasty Warriors Online everywhere.
5822060	5824020	Why the hell couldn't they do Halo Online?
5824020	5828460	I'm sure if it's free to play someone will find a way to be able to get around it where
5828460	5829460	you can play it.
5829460	5830460	Patch it.
5830460	5831460	Yeah.
5831460	5832460	Maybe it won't be Apache.
5832460	5833460	You'll just play it in Russian.
5833460	5836460	I mean that's how it worked with Fantasy Star Online 2.
5836460	5839340	A lot of people did that because you weren't supposed to play that outside Japan.
5839340	5840340	True that.
5840340	5841620	Hey, wouldn't it be awesome if they brought that to the Wii U?
5841620	5842700	That might be pretty nice.
5842700	5844540	You know why you gotta fucking tease me?
5844540	5846060	Like why do you gotta do that?
5846060	5847740	You know that's a soft spot for me.
5847740	5848740	Why are you doing that?
5849420	5852420	Alright, because I know they'll never do it.
5852420	5853420	Maybe.
5853420	5856260	I know I have some Russian people on Twitter at least.
5856260	5860580	I don't know if they still listen to OLR actively, but if you're out there and you're in Russia,
5860580	5862940	how's the Halo scene out there?
5862940	5867300	Any insight as to why you're getting this and the rest of us aren't?
5867300	5868300	Sniff.
5868300	5874300	Anyhow, speaking of Xbox related things, the April system update, you can actually check
5874300	5876180	that out right now.
5876180	5879900	Some of the previews going on for that if you're in the preview program including voice
5879900	5882660	messages finally on the Xbox One.
5882660	5887060	We talked a little bit about that last week, but voice messages making their way in the
5887060	5888940	April update.
5888940	5890980	Dedicated servers for party chat.
5890980	5894180	So to kind of follow up earlier that more and more people are using nothing but party
5894180	5895180	chat.
5895180	5898740	Yeah, there are going to be some dedicated chat relay servers that will kind of make
5898740	5904660	them run more reliably and the what's on area which highlights videos, movies, TV shows
5904660	5906260	and game broadcasts.
5906260	5909700	They are doing some enhancements and just generally trying to make the algorithm and
5909700	5911140	that work a little better.
5911140	5913940	So that's all what you have to look forward to in the April update.
5913940	5918380	An answer of sorts to the 2.5 update that hit the PlayStation this past week.
5918380	5923700	All right, but you know what, let's go back to a much more classic time in gaming.
5923700	5924700	We didn't have face plates.
5924700	5926500	Yeah, you didn't have face plates.
5926500	5929560	You didn't have updates to your console.
5929560	5930560	What is that?
5930560	5933120	They just kept shrinking.
5933120	5936560	Or maybe you would get like a top loader NES that you'd never be able to find.
5936560	5938200	Or your Genesis would shrink.
5938200	5940800	It's the classic game of the week.
5940800	5944480	And every week Dark Soccer is going to step into the vault and find a game that she thinks,
5944480	5951960	hey, you kids and your halos on lines and your Earth Defense Force 41s and all this
5951960	5952960	stuff.
5952960	5954680	Don't mock that game dude.
5954680	5956680	That's EDF dude.
5956680	5959200	We got to pay our respects to a classic game first.
5959200	5962400	So Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week this week?
5962400	5967960	I will preface this saying that I went specifically looking for a treasure game because you cannot
5967960	5970620	go wrong with a treasure game.
5970620	5975880	So today's classic game of the week came out on the Genesis slash Mega Drive and it is
5975880	5977640	called Dynamite Heady.
5977640	5980640	Oh my goodness.
5980640	5981920	Wow.
5981920	5989960	It came out in 1994 when I was a senior in high school and it was on Mega Drive and Genesis
5990000	5992720	Game Gear and there was a Master System version.
5992720	5996320	I'm not sure if it was just one of those Brazilian releases because they still love the Master
5996320	5998240	System in Brazil.
5998240	6002780	There was a 32X port planned but who likes the 32X?
6002780	6003780	Nobody who owned Winded.
6003780	6004780	I do.
6004780	6005780	Oh wait.
6005780	6009480	Well, I've got a couple of 32Xs and I pretty much just play Calibri on it.
6009480	6010480	Or Space Harrier.
6010480	6011480	Nice.
6011480	6015040	Because Space Harrier is my third favorite game.
6015040	6016480	Good choice.
6016480	6022480	Anyway, it has been ported onto the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007 and was included in
6022480	6027480	the Gunstar Heroes treasure box collection for PS2 and the Sonic's Ultimate Genesis collection
6027480	6030720	for Xbox 360 and PS3.
6030720	6036520	So this is a game where you basically play a puppet who can take off his head and beat
6036520	6039000	people with it.
6039000	6040600	I'll read the official thing.
6040600	6047480	Eddie arrives in a place called Northtown to see that this evil puppet king has been
6047480	6052120	attacking people and turning all the peaceful toys into evil minions.
6052120	6057440	And so he got captured, got rejected, and he's like, well screw you, I'm going to stop
6057440	6058440	this.
6058440	6059520	And so he did.
6059520	6063960	So basically he's a puppet with a detachable head and his head can be fired in eight different
6063960	6070960	directions and he can use it to smack obstacles as well as reach items.
6070960	6074760	He can hold onto a thing called a hangman, lets him pull himself up platforms.
6074760	6079280	So he's sort of like Bionic Commando with his head.
6079280	6085120	You also can find a case walking around called Head Case that can give his head special damage.
6085120	6088080	So basically this is a game where you get head.
6088080	6094000	Anyway, so he basically can get like homing stars or he can suck things off the screen
6094000	6101520	and he has different heads that have invulnerability or shrinking and all kinds of other special
6101520	6103960	things can go on.
6103960	6109560	It even has a side scrolling shooter stage so that heady can charge and use his different
6109560	6111760	head types.
6111760	6118920	You know, I have to pause for a second because every time I think of head, I think of the
6118920	6126840	monkeys movie head and they were quoted saying that if ever they did a sequel, they wanted
6126840	6131920	it to be from the people who gave you head.
6131920	6133920	I love the monkeys.
6133920	6139440	Anyway, so basically you have all kinds of different scenes, different locations, you
6139440	6143840	find a different boss, and then you have to collect all these different pieces from
6143840	6146120	defeating keymasters.
6146120	6147480	Are you the keymaster?
6147480	6149480	Are you the gatekeeper?
6149480	6153080	Anyway, and you know basically just make it through the game.
6153080	6159800	You also get the liberty head, ho head, where you enter a bonus stage with your head and
6159800	6161920	shoot basketballs into hoops.
6161920	6166920	So you get different codes and when you compile the code at the end you get a bonus stage.
6166920	6170800	So you've got different characters in the games.
6170800	6176560	You have heady, you have a girl with floating hands called heather, although her other name
6176560	6181840	is fangie.
6181840	6183400	Does she throw her fingers around?
6183400	6187960	No, she just uses her fingers for the keymaster.
6187960	6190800	You have dark demon or king dark demon.
6190800	6193680	You have trouble bruin or mariyama.
6193680	6200320	You have head case, also known as mokun, I'm sure you can figure out what the Japanese
6200320	6201320	ones are by now.
6201320	6203320	You have hangman or hukun.
6203320	6205080	You have bow or yakun.
6205080	6206080	You have bino.
6206080	6208900	You have mad dog slash bounty bounty.
6208900	6210440	That's actually a cooler name.
6210440	6213880	Wooden dresser or Jacqueline dressy, as she's called.
6213880	6221760	Spinderella, who wasn't she the DJ for Salt-N-Pepa?
6222440	6224160	Spinderella was in this game?
6224160	6225160	Awesome.
6225160	6226840	The other name is motor hand.
6226840	6230160	It would be funny if it was motor head.
6230160	6233880	I just gotta say in our chat room real quick over at live.vognetwork.com AkumaJP is saying
6233880	6235600	is this a horror game?
6235600	6241440	You know and I'm like no cause when you're running around giving random people head that's
6241440	6243440	not horror.
6243440	6246840	Unless it's from someone you didn't want to give that you had.
6246840	6251200	Well AkumaJP says oh so this is a horror porn game.
6251200	6256200	And I'm like and that caused me to think about what are some horror porn games that I've
6256200	6257200	played.
6257200	6258200	This is the horrifying one.
6258200	6261240	It's the character named baby face also known as mitsuru.
6261240	6264960	It was the fourth keymaster which is a baby head on a pole.
6264960	6265960	Wow.
6265960	6270720	And he gets older every time he goes to his treasure.
6270720	6274000	Gatekeeper you have nasty gatekeeper, nasty.
6274000	6279400	You have twin freak slash reaver face and smiley.
6279400	6284160	So dynamite heady it was a really good game.
6284160	6289840	I mean it's just treasure can hardly do anything wrong pretty much.
6289840	6293480	When it came out it got EGM gave it a seven point six out of ten.
6293480	6299080	Famitsu gave it an eight out of ten which is not bad for Famitsu back in the day.
6299080	6304500	It's just it was a really good game and that's all I have to say.
6304500	6307720	Treasure or as my friend says it treasure.
6307720	6308720	Treasure.
6309120	6313960	There it is your classic game of the week dynamite heady.
6313960	6315640	The prequel to dynamite rave.
6315640	6316640	Just kidding.
6316640	6317640	What?
6317640	6318640	Thingy.
6318640	6325760	Going to our chat room where they're talking about horror porn.
6325760	6328000	Bobby Blackwell saying phantasmagoria.
6328000	6332840	I was the first one I thought about but that night trap.
6332840	6334760	I thought it was a night trap.
6334760	6338680	That's if we're gonna take it there with full FMV night trap.
6338680	6343240	That was more than anything else but oh god bless phantasmagoria good call that was a
6343240	6344240	great game.
6344240	6345240	Alright.
6345240	6348600	I named that last week as a game I thought had been really dated though.
6348600	6349600	Yeah.
6349600	6350600	Phantasmagoria.
6350600	6351600	Yeah.
6351600	6352600	Alright.
6352600	6353600	Good game though.
6353600	6354600	We're gonna take a break though.
6354600	6356720	There's plenty more Orange Laundry to come believe it or not.

6360280	6362000	The FUCL Question of the Week.

6367280	6368840	Going to the next level.

6534980	6536900	of many appearances by these guys on our show.

6539020	6540020	I'm looking forward to it.
6540020	6541020	Awesome.
6541020	6542020	I want that review of Earth Defense Force, Gabriel.
6542020	6543020	Yes.
6543020	6544020	Gotta hear it.
6544020	6545020	I may buy that.
6545020	6546020	Be careful what you wish for.
6546020	6548020	I wish, I wish, I wish.
6548020	6549020	All right.
6549020	6550780	Thank you guys so much for being here and especially live.
6550780	6554780	Not many people get to be here live in studio but only in Sacramento or where we're at.
6554780	6556860	We're not in San Jose or LA.
6556860	6557860	All right.
6557860	6563820	Well, I'm gonna get into some foreign feedback tonight and get into that segment here and
6563820	6568540	of course, you guys can participate in our forums over at vognetwork.com.
6568540	6576340	You just click on forums and I do have one topic to talk about tonight that popped up
6576340	6581220	on the forums this week and it's one of those that was user-created.
6581220	6587100	I didn't even do this but good old SSJ100Matt actually made this topic on our forums this
6587100	6594660	week and it's about the topic we got into last week of Nintendo mobile games.
6594660	6599340	So SSJ100Matt last week had mentioned going off the big news last week that Nintendo is
6599340	6604280	going to be making games out of their popular franchises for mobile smartphone tablet smart
6604280	6605280	device.
6605280	6608900	This was a big move by Nintendo since they've been very reluctant to allow their franchises
6608900	6611280	to be on platforms other than their own.
6611280	6614500	Many people including investors felt it was about time for the company to venture into
6614500	6616940	the mobile market while some were hesitant.
6616940	6620460	Regardless, Nintendo's franchises will be reaching a far broader audience than it has
6620460	6621460	before.
6621460	6626060	But this made me wonder, what type of games and what Nintendo franchises could we see
6626060	6628920	ourselves playing on these devices?
6628920	6634020	So SSJ100Matt goes over some of his picks including Pokemon Shuffle, which we've talked
6634020	6638980	about, you know, before would make a good mobile game most likely, Advance Wars, which
6638980	6643460	I brought up on the show last week but certainly, as SSJ100Matt says, I've been waiting a long
6643460	6647020	time for this franchise to make a comeback and I think the mobile platform is a perfect
6647020	6648140	place for it.
6648140	6652820	This game just screams a very fun tablet experience and even allows some possible multiplayer
6652820	6654140	aspects.
6654140	6659020	And then WarioWare, I thought that was a really good suggestion, WarioWare.
6659020	6662780	While it may be a little gimmicky, I think WarioWare would be great on the mobile platform
6662780	6664460	utilizing the gyroscopics.
6664460	6668100	I think this could be a very fun and probably public embarrassing experience.
6668100	6671540	I can also see some fun pass and play multiplayer mechanics.
6671540	6673340	I think WarioWare is a great suggestion.
6673340	6677840	Well, considering that it was at one time on the Game Boy Advance, I could see them
6677840	6678840	doing that.
6678840	6679840	Yeah, absolutely.
6679840	6680840	So we'll see what happens.
6680840	6684980	And then with the touch screens and all that, it could really play into that a lot.
6684980	6687460	Tigerclaw say, excellent mobile games.
6687460	6691500	Mobile games don't really give you the AAA experience you get from the Wii U or the 3DS.
6691500	6694620	I could see them more as companion games to the bigger ones.
6694620	6698440	Flaco Jones suggested, since Hearthstone is a mobile game that I think is amazing and
6698440	6702560	does mobile gaming right by not forcing players to nickel and dine themselves to death in
6702560	6707100	order to have fun, I sort of hope they do a Hearthstone style trading card game with
6707100	6712000	Nintendo's All-Stars and their famous abilities featured on the cards.
6712000	6715600	You know, isn't there a Pokemon trading card game?
6715600	6720360	I mean, that would be prime to convert over, but maybe, you know, I can also see maybe
6720360	6725560	they don't want to do that because, you know, that makes their bread and butter in the old
6725560	6726560	fashioned way.
6726560	6727760	And maybe they don't want to get into that.
6727760	6728920	I don't know.
6728920	6733540	But anyway, that topic on our forums, that was some of the responses there.
6733540	6737860	So check that out over at vognetwork.com slash forums.
6737860	6742480	And if you have a topic, especially follow up that you want us to talk about on the show
6742480	6745660	with your perspective, be sure to post it.
6745660	6747600	We like to read that stuff here on the show.
6747600	6748600	All right.
6748600	6753280	Well, we're going to move on with some rapid fire news and travel around the world of gaming
6753280	6756720	quickly and see what else is going on that we just don't have time to fit in anywhere
6756720	6757720	else.
6757720	6758720	Loki.
6758720	6761660	So Microsoft is upping the amount of free games they're going to give you with their
6761660	6764960	Games with Gold program starting in April.
6764960	6770120	Hopefully this is going to continue on beyond April, but for April, they're going to start
6770120	6775560	off with, I guess, for Xbox One, you'll be able to download Pool Nation FX and Child
6775560	6776680	of Light.
6776680	6781960	On the Xbox 360, you can get two games for the first half of the month and two games
6781960	6783200	for the second half.
6783200	6787120	So for the first half, between April 1st and the 15th, you can get Gears of War Judgment
6787120	6789260	and Terraria.
6789260	6794160	And during the latter half of the month, you get Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag and Army
6794160	6796840	II The Devil's Cartel.
6796840	6802840	That's a pretty good offering, I'd say, and those are all really recent games.
6802840	6807600	And then, let's see here, unfortunately, there's yet another delay.
6807600	6809000	Another big AAA game.
6809040	6813080	Batman Arkham Knight has been delayed now.
6813080	6818880	The word is that the new date that's supposed to be released is June 23rd, 2015.
6818880	6819880	And no word.
6819880	6820880	Hey, it's our show's birthday!
6820880	6821880	Yay!
6821880	6824840	Same date as Heaven's Word for Final Fantasy XIV.
6824840	6827200	I am screwed that week.
6827200	6833440	So obviously, it's to polish up the game a little bit more, but it seems to be a trend
6833440	6837040	nowadays, with a lot of AAA games getting pushed back.
6837080	6844000	Thankfully, this isn't into 2016 yet, so I'm kinda glad to see that they're at least giving
6844000	6848160	themselves more time, as opposed to putting out a game that's really buggy.
6848160	6851440	What'll really suck is if they give themselves more time and put out a game that's really
6851440	6852720	buggy.
6852720	6855440	So hopefully that's not the case.
6855440	6861360	Last but not least, there's a brand new video out there for Mortal Kombat X that's confirming
6861360	6864920	Liu Kang as a playable character in the game.
6864920	6871680	And there was another player I want to say that they showed off to, like some sort of
6871680	6874000	cowboy-looking guy as well.
6874000	6878640	And of course, Mortal Kombat X is only a few weeks away, actually.
6878640	6880400	Yeah, it's really close.
6880400	6885400	So at least on PlayStation 4 and PC and Xbox One.
6885400	6886400	Awesome.
6886400	6890760	Alright, I just want to say quickly, in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, I was
6890760	6896600	getting some feedback there on the Nintendo mobile that I was talking about with the forum.
6896600	6902800	And Fifth Dream in our chat poking out and saying, Pokemon card game is mobile already.
6902800	6903800	I didn't realize that.
6903800	6908000	And gives the link to where the Pokemon trading card game online is on the App Store and iTunes.
6908000	6909000	I did not realize that.
6909000	6910000	I stand corrected.
6910000	6911000	Well, there you go.
6911000	6915120	Akuma JP suggesting, I don't think you'll see existing titles to mobile yet, but you'll
6915120	6918800	see new ideas and titles from Nintendo to mobile.
6918840	6924960	See, I'm sort of with you there, but I sort of feel like we'll see franchises move in
6924960	6926700	a new mobile direction.
6926700	6929120	Like you know they're going to put Mario's face on a mobile game somewhere.
6929120	6930120	They have to.
6930120	6933440	What about like all those mini games that they had for like Mario Kart or Mario 64 on
6933440	6934440	the DS?
6934440	6937160	Remember how they used to have all those like, was it Yoshi mini games or whatever?
6937160	6938160	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6938160	6939160	Yeah, you never know.
6939160	6940160	You never know.
6940160	6941160	Something like that.
6941160	6942160	Maybe expanding on some of these other ideas.
6942160	6943160	Who knows?
6943160	6944160	Alright, anyhow.
6944160	6946440	Moving on to some other, I just want to get those comments out there.
6946440	6947960	I thought they were all really good.
6948120	6954640	Anyway, some interesting updates this week on VR and, you know, as this is an expanding
6954640	6959160	thing, as more and more people are trying out things like Gear VR and Oculus Rift and
6959160	6966280	so forth, you know, the reality sets in that some people don't respond too well in terms
6966280	6970020	of getting sick from playing these devices.
6970020	6973380	So of course, you know, they're trying to figure out how can we make it so that people,
6973380	6978860	you know, who are very sensitive to this sort of stuff don't get sick with this.
6978860	6986220	So apparently one idea to help is creating a virtual nose.
6986220	6990660	This is from a study that was done at Purdue University.
6990660	6996220	Assistant professor Dave Whittinghill studied simulator sickness and one of the research
6996220	6999020	assistants suggested putting in a nose.
6999020	7004020	And so by putting in the nose and participants who were given this virtual nose, they didn't
7004020	7007120	even report noticing it until it was pointed out.
7007120	7011740	So apparently having like that nose in there, because you kind of see it, I guess, I don't
7011740	7015520	know how often I really look at my nose, but I guess you're kind of aware it's there.
7015520	7022020	So kind of having that in the simulator vision makes people a little less sick.
7022020	7024020	Follow your nose!
7024020	7025520	Follow your nose!
7025520	7030240	Anyway, obviously, you know, everybody responds differently to different situations.
7030240	7033660	And you know, ultimately, people are gonna have to find what works best for them.
7033660	7038640	But I thought that was a pretty creative solution to trying and help people deal with some of
7038640	7040960	the motion sickness that can come with that.
7040960	7042880	Have that with like the character creators in the game.
7042880	7046240	So if you give a character like a giant nose, it just takes up a large portion.
7046240	7047760	Are you trying to say something about my nose, Loki?
7047760	7050480	No, I'm trying to say if you're making characters with large noses.
7050480	7051480	Oh, okay.
7051480	7052480	All right.
7052480	7053480	Fair enough.
7053480	7059440	Anyhow, Facebook is going to be bringing 360 degree videos to Oculus and the newsfeed.
7059440	7060440	That's awesome.
7060440	7062720	I'm sure they'll autoplay without any sort of way to stop that.
7062720	7065840	I knew you'd have something smart ass to say.
7065840	7068880	Facebook had a big update meeting this week, and of course, you know, now that Facebook
7068880	7071440	owns Oculus, they talked a little bit about that.
7071440	7075480	And yes, they do plan to bring spherical video content to its VR headset.
7075480	7080660	Now, I think a lot of people, at least I do, I look at this and go, okay, that's the direction
7080660	7085020	I expected Facebook to move in is that it's not going to just be about games.
7085020	7088460	And even some of the demos I've talked about that I've seen on Oculus before have nothing
7088460	7090540	to do necessarily with games.
7090540	7095180	Like when Bobby was showing me that Gear VR when I was at PAX East, I didn't play a single
7095180	7096180	game on it.
7096180	7099860	It had games, but the stuff I just happened to look at was, you know, like a Paul McCartney
7099860	7101380	concert where I was there.
7101380	7106220	Like, it's like I'm on stage with Paul McCartney and a Cirque du Soleil type experience.
7106220	7112580	And I could, I could really see that too, putting those types of experiences on Facebook.
7112580	7114380	So yeah, so that's, that's pretty neat.
7114380	7117940	And then they were actually showing off some of these 360 degree video viewing experiences
7117940	7118940	at the Facebook Dev Conference.
7118940	7122840	Are you going to be able to do lines and like say a Scarface type game with your virtual
7122840	7125180	nose?
7125180	7126180	Stop it.
7126180	7130300	Actually, Bobby in our chat room over at live.hognetwork.com says it's less about having a nose and more
7130300	7134780	about having a frame of reference that your eyes can focus on that doesn't move.
7134780	7135780	Yeah.
7136340	7140180	It's just in real life, your nose happens to be there.
7140180	7145100	So you kind of have that in real life where you may not have that when you're playing
7145100	7148820	the Oculus or whatever VR headset you're using.
7148820	7150660	And maybe that's the trick for some people.
7150660	7151920	I don't know.
7151920	7154900	But anyhow, so yeah, that could be very interesting.
7154900	7158460	I mean, you think about, think about what we're doing today.
7158460	7164260	You know, it's all about what, like Snapchat and pictures on Twitter and little videos
7164300	7165300	on Facebook.
7165300	7170540	Imagine that you're going to one day strap on the Gear VR, the Oculus Rift, and you're
7170540	7175460	going to look at, here's some highlights that your friends took from around the world.
7175460	7178060	And you're going to experience that right now in full 3D motion.
7178060	7182020	I kind of feel like that's what we're going to start to see.
7182020	7183020	But I don't know.
7183020	7184020	We'll see.
7184020	7185020	We'll see.
7185020	7189460	By the way, also some little hints being dropped that the Oculus Rift could be available this
7189460	7190460	year.
7190460	7195180	However, Facebook quickly clarifying the comments, saying that they're not trying to announce
7195180	7197720	any shipping date regarding the Oculus Rift.
7197720	7202400	They were just intending to say that PC hardware will be available this year that can create
7202400	7205300	the VR experiences that they were speaking about.
7205300	7210060	But I, you know, whether it's this year or next year, it's really starting to heat up
7210060	7211060	a little bit.
7211060	7214140	And I think, I kind of think it still will be a little quiet this year.
7214140	7216180	I mean, VR is already out there.
7216180	7219640	You know, the Gear VR you can get at Best Buy, right?
7219640	7221820	So the VR experience is starting to get out there.
7221820	7225560	I think it's just going to really start to ramp up, I feel like, you know, next year
7225560	7229880	between what we're going to see on PlayStation 4, probably more and more of this Oculus ramping
7229880	7230880	up.
7230880	7233520	I really think 2016 is going to be a big year for all this.
7233520	7237560	Anyway, lastly, let's throw it back with some talk about EverQuest.
7237560	7239960	And I didn't realize EverQuest did this.
7239960	7243480	But you know, EverQuest has been around for a long time.
7243480	7247120	And EverQuest has been, you know, to kind of keep people interested in what's going
7247120	7248120	on over there.
7248600	7253000	And a lot of people have been playing an MMO for a very long time, because I saw this all
7253000	7258440	the time in World of Warcraft, was, man, what if we could play this game vanilla?
7258440	7261760	What if we could play this game the way it was intended, the way it was meant to be in
7261760	7264160	the beginning before all this other stuff?
7264160	7269080	Well, EverQuest doing some polls and bringing their users exactly something like that.
7269080	7273880	And they're actually looking at and polling the users right now about doing a new progression
7273880	7274880	server.
7274880	7279200	So they're going to start the server as normal, but at a specific point, all progression would
7279200	7282480	cease and the server would just stay at that point.
7282480	7286520	And so, you know, it'll talk about, they go on to talk about like how long some of the
7286520	7288420	stuff will be locked.
7288420	7295120	So like Kunark would be the thing, the Ruins of Kunark would be open for 6.75 months.
7295120	7298600	And then Velius for 3.75 months, and so on and so on.
7298600	7303120	All these expansions would slowly unlock, which would allow people to kind of appreciate,
7303160	7305000	I guess, the earlier days.
7305000	7310240	So they're doing voting on more of like specifically the time frames and when the expansion should
7310240	7312200	be unlocked and so forth.
7312200	7315040	And this, again, just has me kind of thinking about World of Warcraft, which is a game I
7315040	7317120	have a little more experience with.
7317120	7320600	You know, I hear people saying in WoW all the time, oh, I want to see that vanilla server.
7320600	7322020	I want to see what that was like.
7322020	7325160	And then sure enough, when they did that Molten Core raid recently, where you could actually
7325160	7329920	have a 40-man team in Molten Raid, everybody was like, this is fucking terrible, trying
7329920	7331340	to run through with 40 people.
7331340	7332340	This is awful.
7332540	7335140	Yet there's still some people clamoring for that vanilla experience.
7335140	7338020	So that's something they're doing over in EverQuest, at least.
7338020	7339020	Kind of interesting.
7339020	7340020	Anyway, Dark Soccer.
7340020	7341020	What do you have for us?
7341020	7344780	I'm trying not to get tangled over here.
7344780	7350860	Well, there is a, this is funny, the folks that are behind Lords of the Fallen, they
7350860	7355980	offered Hideo Kojima a job over Twitter.
7355980	7361900	It goes, Dear Mr. At Hideo Underscore Kojima Underscore Ian, in case you are currently
7361900	7365700	searching, we have an open position as Head of Game Design at Deck 13.
7365700	7366700	Please get in touch.
7366700	7370460	Yeah, he's probably not going to go for that.
7370460	7372740	So let's move forward to Tekken News.
7372740	7376420	I love Tekken, all the things practically.
7376420	7379500	So coming up in Tekken 7, we are getting Jin.
7379500	7381500	Yay, I love Jin.
7381500	7382500	Devil Jin.
7382500	7384120	Yay, I love Devil Jin, too.
7384120	7391020	And a new character named Josie, who is a Philippines-born model and martial artist
7391020	7394820	who is pretty, pretty cheerful.
7394820	7400180	It's also designed by the same person who gave us Bayonetta.
7400180	7402420	So that's good.
7402420	7412220	And then last but not least, this is actually kind of old.
7412220	7415440	Okay.
7415440	7420620	So yes, Jaws of Hakkon was already been released on Xbox One and PC.
7421220	7425660	But the other versions are going to be released much later.
7425660	7434940	Those are going to be coming out for PS4 and Xbox on, I think, later this week.
7434940	7439060	The Xbox One, I think, came out this week, but yeah, PS4.
7439060	7447860	It came out days ago, but I don't know if they put the date for the PS4 one yet.
7447860	7452100	I want to say I read somewhere that they couldn't tell us what it is because of some
7452100	7454140	type of contractual agreement.
7454140	7455140	What the release date is?
7455140	7456140	Yeah.
7456140	7457140	What the release date is for the PS4.
7457140	7458140	Like, they can't tell us what it is.
7458140	7461440	Well, I'm going to tell you all right now.
7461440	7463140	It's pretty and doesn't do much.
7463140	7466300	You get a little bit of lore, but it's just pretty.
7466300	7467300	Hmm.
7467300	7468300	Interesting.
7468300	7469300	All right.
7469300	7470300	Well, then I guess I'm not missing out so much because I was kind of pissed at first.
7470300	7473180	Oh, you get a lot of Scott Harding.
7473180	7474180	I love Scott Harding.
7474180	7475180	Oh, there you go.
7475180	7476180	I wish she was romanceable.
7476180	7479140	All right.
7479140	7481660	Let's go to the FUGL question of the week.
7481660	7485340	Every week here on the show, we go to Facebook and Google Plus, and we ask a question of
7485340	7491220	our communities, and when you slam Facebook and Google Plus together, you get FUGL.
7491220	7502460	Well, this week in the FUGL question of the week, we asked a little bit about clubs and
7502460	7507140	organizations because since our guests tonight were from the Sacramento IGDA, I don't expect
7507140	7513300	that everybody that listens to this show is a member of the IGDA, but I figure maybe a
7513300	7518340	few of you have belonged to some type of club or association at some point, so we wanted
7518340	7519820	to get more information about that.
7519820	7520820	Tell us about it.
7520820	7524060	Have you ever been the member of a club or association that relates to gaming, like an
7524060	7530180	official fan club or an unofficial group dedicated to playing, creating one, or multiple games?
7530180	7531260	Tell us about it.
7531260	7535780	So over on Facebook, we got RageNator, who said, sort of.
7535780	7539620	During my senior year of high school, a few people, including myself, regularly got together
7539620	7543140	before school during lunch periods and after to play Magic the Gathering.
7543140	7544140	Nerd.
7544140	7545140	Just kidding.
7545140	7546140	I did the same thing.
7546140	7550420	Granted, at the time, it wasn't a club officially sanctioned by the school and didn't have a
7550420	7554740	name, but it was the seed that eventually became an official club based on what I was
7554740	7557540	told by others that graduated after me.
7557540	7559200	Oh, wow.
7559200	7564000	It's always weird to me to hear about that something really awesome existed at your high
7564000	7566280	school after you left.
7566280	7570640	My high school finally started offering Japanese after I left.
7570640	7573840	Anyway, I guess that always happens.
7573840	7574840	Princess Ireni.
7574840	7578960	Our good pal Princess Ireni actually answered the question here on Facebook this week and
7578960	7585520	said, I used to run with a crew called the Sacramentals back in the early 2000s.
7585520	7589680	We played a bunch of Imani games at Roosevelt Golf Land and ate at Brookfield's a lot.
7589680	7590680	Maybe you've heard of them.
7590680	7592840	They're pretty legendary in these parts.
7592840	7595640	I heard they were big fucking nerds.
7595640	7596640	You know what?
7596640	7601440	I remember trying to actually register that domain to find that some Catholic group already
7601440	7602440	had it.
7602440	7603440	I was so mad.
7603440	7604440	All right.
7604440	7605440	Anyhow.
7605440	7611920	Surping Slurpee responded and said, occasionally I attend board game get togethers every week
7611920	7617080	between 20 to 30 people get together at Panera, then Denny's after Panera closes, and game
7617080	7618080	out.
7618080	7621280	Most attendees are in their late 20s to early 30s, though some are older and predominantly
7621280	7622280	female.
7622280	7623280	It's great fun.
7623280	7625160	Andy R said, nope.
7625160	7628640	Was part of an anime club in college, though, and a lot of our meetings consisted of playing
7628640	7629640	games.
7629640	7632700	I did hang out with the remnants of our college's Bamani Club a lot when they were basically
7632700	7635480	disbanded by the time I met them due to bullshittery.
7635480	7641580	I have to remember to use that term more often in my life, bullshittery.
7641580	7644440	We completely dominated the school's rock band tournament both years.
7644440	7645940	They held it.
7645940	7650660	Bryce replied and simply said, no, crying face.
7650660	7651660	Start one.
7651660	7653140	Bryce needed to start one.
7653140	7656340	Deakman replied and said, does Club Nintendo count?
7656340	7659940	Well, if you helped to run it, maybe.
7659940	7660940	No.
7660940	7661940	Club Nintendo, I guess.
7661940	7662940	Of course Club Nintendo counts.
7662940	7664060	Somebody has to say that.
7664060	7668060	Dark Tetsuya said, Irene stole my answer, but Wednesdays back in the day with the Sac
7668060	7673580	Bamani crew were fucking epic, trying to get all the content unlocked on Max 2 by playing
7673580	7675220	the crap out of it.
7675220	7676700	Good times.
7676700	7677700	That was good times.
7677700	7681520	Remember when the whole community had to come together to get stuff in the games?
7681520	7683180	That was always a good time.
7683180	7690740	Anyway, last but not least, and I love this answer over on Google Plus from Prince Peachfuzz.
7690740	7692380	One of my other favorite names here.
7692380	7696880	Prince Peachfuzz responded and said, does the OL Army count?
7696880	7697880	If so, yes.
7697880	7700760	Gold star for you, sir.
7700760	7701920	Yes, it counts.
7701920	7703620	You're all a part of the club now.
7703620	7708120	So even the poor guy on Facebook who felt left out, you could be a part of the OL Army.
7708120	7714160	We're a club and I'm the president and Jamie is the overlord because she has to outrank
7714160	7715560	me.
7715560	7720480	I was just going to say I am the queen bee.
7720480	7725040	And Loki, clearly the court jester.
7725040	7726040	Prince of Bacon.
7726040	7727840	No, no, no, no, no.
7727840	7731680	Loki is our, he's our Cullen.
7731680	7732680	Cullen?
7732680	7733680	Oh yeah.
7733680	7735080	He's our Cullen.
7735080	7736840	What does Cullen do?
7736840	7739080	He's the commander of the Inquisition's forces.
7739080	7740080	I see.
7740080	7743360	Do you really want to put him in charge of the actual army?
7743360	7744360	No.
7744360	7746200	Loki, what would you...
7746200	7748280	We could put a big hat on him.
7748280	7749720	Fair enough.
7749720	7750720	He's the Pope.
7750720	7751720	He's the Pope.
7751720	7754560	He's the Pope of the OL Army.
7754560	7755560	He's the OL Army Pope.
7755560	7756560	He's the spiritual figurehead.
7756560	7757560	No, no, no.
7757560	7759360	A big hat.
7759360	7760360	He can be the admiral.
7760360	7761360	There you go.
7761360	7762360	You're the admiral.
7762360	7763360	I like that.
7763360	7764360	Admiral Loki.
7764360	7767120	Loki just has this look on his face of like, I don't know what the fuck you two are talking
7767120	7768120	about.
7768120	7769120	Exactly.
7769120	7770120	That's exactly what I was thinking.
7770120	7773560	Alright, then Loki, let's get back to some news because I know this first one.
7773560	7775400	You've got to have something to say about this, Loki.
7775400	7776720	I think it's pretty awesome.
7776720	7781800	I mean, they've had the rights sold already to Warner Brothers for Ready Player One for,
7782040	7788560	God, I don't even know how long now, but they have a director and I guess I could have picked
7788560	7789560	just anybody.
7789560	7794240	I mean, they've got this guy named Steven Spielberg, I mean, like, what's he done?
7794240	7799340	But he's going to be directing the movie, which hopefully will be coming out sooner
7799340	7803280	than it actually takes place in 2044.
7803280	7805440	But I am psyched for this movie when it comes out.
7805440	7809840	I'm going to be psyched anyways, it's just a bunch of like, it's just an orgy of 80s
7809840	7810840	stuff.
7810880	7816000	You have fucking mecha and shit fighting each other and it's like, how is this not going
7816000	7817000	to be awesome?
7817000	7822240	Of course my wife's like, I'm just reciting things and it's like, she complains about
7822240	7823240	the book all the time.
7823240	7824240	Have you read the book yet?
7824240	7828080	I still have not read the book, but I'm glad to know there's a movie coming out so I don't
7828080	7829080	have to read.
7829080	7830080	Do you want to borrow the book?
7830080	7831080	Maybe.
7831080	7832080	You should read the book.
7832080	7833080	It's awesome.
7833080	7834080	It's just garbage, but it's, it's...
7834080	7837240	My partner has a Kindle that neither one of us ever use, so maybe I could get a digital,
7837240	7839080	I don't even know where the fucking Kindle is, but...
7839320	7841360	You have an iPad with a Kindle app.
7841360	7842360	You don't need a digital version.
7842360	7843360	I have a hard...
7843360	7848160	Wait, how am I supposed to use paper?
7848160	7849160	A book?
7849160	7850160	What are we going to do with that?
7850160	7853160	Are they going to hold down another book?
7853160	7854160	It's a quick read.
7854160	7855160	All right.
7855160	7857160	They played Joust in it at one point.
7857160	7860640	Books are the things that Rob used to hold up his monitor.
7860640	7862320	But I don't know.
7862320	7865320	I'm very excited about it.
7865320	7870880	It should hopefully turn out better than, say, I don't know, Pixels or something.
7870880	7872840	I am excited to see this.
7872840	7877920	Even though I don't always love Spielberg, I think some of his stuff is overrated, I
7877920	7883600	think that's really cool that somebody of his caliber is attached to this.
7883600	7889080	And I know it's considered one of his worst movies, but I will always stick up for Hook.
7889080	7890080	I love that movie.
7890080	7891080	I'm sorry.
7891080	7892080	I love that movie as a kid.
7892080	7893560	It was so good.
7894120	7896600	You know that's considered one of his worst movies.
7896600	7899360	If that's his worst movie, then he can't do too bad.
7899360	7901360	I mean, that's not bad.
7901360	7905760	I mean, damn, you've got a pretty entertaining movie as your worst movie.
7905760	7908520	Okay, well that's terrible of you, I guess.
7908520	7909520	All right.
7909520	7915220	Well, anyhow, from movies to television, and you're really into Ready Player One, I really
7915220	7917200	like this mobile phone game.
7917200	7918440	Maybe this should be the thing.
7918480	7923880	I will read Ready Player One when you sign up to play Ingress, which is a game that I've
7923880	7924880	talked about on this show.
7924880	7927000	Dude, my phone would not run that if I even...
7927000	7928000	Oh, that's true.
7928000	7929000	I'm guessing.
7929000	7930000	It's a Samsung Galaxy S2.
7930000	7932560	It hardly runs a fucking web page.
7932560	7937200	Yeah, I think Alan had a three, and it was pretty slow on that, so I don't know.
7937200	7938200	So, sorry.
7938200	7939200	That's all right.
7939200	7940200	I can't do that yet.
7940200	7941200	Maybe on the next one.
7941200	7942200	I can't play anything on this.
7942200	7943200	Maybe on the next one.
7943200	7945760	But anyway, Ingress apparently going to be coming to television.
7946400	7952680	Now, of course, I've talked about this game on the show before, but it gets you out and
7952680	7955280	going around to places of public interest to capture...
7955280	7958520	Imagine if Foursquare met Capture the Flag.
7958520	7962920	That's kind of what Ingress is, is you battle out in these factions to then capture these
7962920	7965920	nodes and connect them to create control fields.
7965920	7966920	And so that's what Ingress is all about.
7966920	7974600	But of course, there's this whole YouTube and a viral alternate augmented reality game
7974600	7977040	type of stuff that goes on behind it.
7977040	7980020	There's an actual reporter that goes out to all these events.
7980020	7984660	Some of the local folks I know that play here in Sacramento all went down to Pasadena this
7984660	7990200	weekend for what they call an anomaly, which is just basically a big event where it actually
7990200	7991800	drives the game's lore.
7991800	7995600	So one of these events, when people go to it, is it just a bunch of people on their
7995600	7996600	phones going...
7996600	7997600	Yes!
7997600	7998600	It's so stupid.
7998600	8004560	If you're watching this, it happened in Sacramento and it's thousands of people on the street
8004560	8005800	all staring at their phones.
8005800	8009000	It looks like some frickin' flash mob hit where people can't be bothered to pay attention.
8009000	8013400	Or just regular life with people on the street with their phones.
8013400	8015440	It's like no one actually understands their...
8015440	8016440	What?
8016440	8017440	There's an anomaly going on?
8017440	8018440	I was just playing on my phone.
8018440	8021800	Now little did you know, they're all sitting there going, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew,
8021800	8022800	pew, pew, pew.
8022800	8025280	Yes, it doesn't make it any less stupid.
8025280	8026280	No.
8026280	8028560	Ah, you're such an asshole.
8028560	8031480	Anyway, now more people can learn about it because apparently...
8031480	8036080	At least they're not running around pretending their guns and stuff and going pew, pew, pew,
8036080	8040360	and hiding behind bushes and shit like that.
8040360	8043560	Anyway, Google Niantic apparently working with Sean...
8043560	8044840	Do they have costumes?
8044840	8047120	Do you wear costumes to these events?
8047120	8052840	Well, because the factions are blue and green, people will wear blue and green.
8052840	8055240	Some people will wear the green wigs.
8055240	8058720	So they're gonna think it's a gang war going on.
8059240	8061520	Yes, somebody's gonna think it's a gang war.
8061520	8063880	But they're all staring at their phones.
8063880	8065400	I'm glad to be coming after you, man.
8065400	8066400	Alright, shut up.
8066400	8070920	Anyway, Google Niantic Labs, who created the game, working with Sean Daniel Company.
8070920	8075320	This is the production company responsible for the Mummy film franchise and The Expanse,
8075320	8076880	which is coming to Syfy.
8076880	8078840	Nothing pitched to networks yet.
8078840	8080680	No showrunner attached.
8080680	8083040	So this is still very early on in development.
8083040	8087960	Some folks thinking that this might actually not be about Ingress, but Niantic working
8087960	8092280	on a follow-up of sorts, which is also going to be taking place.
8092280	8096560	So this could be that the TV agreement's actually for what's to come next.
8096560	8100400	And what cracks me up is that, and I forget the name of it, maybe somebody in chat remembers
8100400	8108440	it, but Niantic's working with author James Frey to create the book that will kind of
8108440	8109440	be part of the lore.
8109440	8112680	Well, if you don't recognize that name, do you know who James Frey was?
8112680	8117920	He's the guy that got read to filth by Oprah because he lied on the show about his memoir.
8117920	8121360	Remember that whole thing, the million broken pieces or whatever it was called?
8121360	8125760	He fricking lied, I guess, about the experiences or embellished a lot and Oprah had them on
8125760	8131280	the show and like, you don't ever see Oprah get mad, but when she gets mad, heaven help
8131280	8132280	you.
8132280	8133280	Right?
8133280	8134280	So that was that guy.
8134280	8137280	And I'm like, wow, he's back and he's going to write Game War.
8137280	8138760	Apparently he's good at fabrication.
8138760	8139760	Right?
8139840	8145120	Why not the guy's good at lying and making stories up.
8145120	8146120	Oh Lord.
8146120	8147120	All right.
8147120	8148120	Anyway.
8148120	8149120	Uh, let's move on.
8149120	8150120	Dark Sakura.
8150120	8157800	Well, um, there is a UK, uh, charity event that went on.
8157800	8162440	It was run by, uh, a group called, uh, special effect.
8162440	8169120	They had a charity, uh, event called game blast that they managed to pull in over 120,000
8169160	8175240	pounds in donations and they surpassed last year's goal by 50,000 pounds.
8175240	8181400	So, uh, they, uh, basically have, uh, just been pulling this in, trying to help, you
8181400	8183640	know, poor kids that need the help.
8183640	8186800	Um, their donation page is still up and active.
8186800	8193800	Uh, the, uh, next game blast is going to be tentatively February 26th through 28th, 2016.
8193800	8197640	And you can go to their donation page at just giving.com.
8200120	8201120	Awesome.
8201120	8202120	Yep.
8202120	8203120	I like it.
8203120	8204120	We like people doing nice stuff.
8204120	8205120	That's right.
8205120	8210000	It's nice to hear about gamers doing good as opposed to, you know, gang warfare created
8210000	8211000	by video games.
8211000	8212200	Don't be a Dick.
8212200	8213200	That's right.
8213200	8216200	Uh, moving on Loki.
8216200	8219000	Hey, I don't know.
8219000	8224280	I can't believe they're using that author quote unquote to, uh, make the storyline for
8224280	8225280	this thing.
8225280	8226280	I can't remember that.
8226280	8227280	Does he actually write anything?
8227440	8232480	I mean that he hasn't, you know, plagiarized, uh, I will do what anyone would do in this
8232480	8238860	situation and I'm going to look it up on Wikipedia right now and try to find out, um, what else
8238860	8241280	that he's written since then.
8241280	8248480	Um, he has a young adult novel publishing company, uh, that was trying to gracely create
8248480	8249480	Twilight knockoffs.
8249480	8251320	It sounds like, wow.
8251320	8252320	So there you go.
8252320	8253320	All right.
8253320	8255360	And game is the name of the game I was trying to think of.
8255440	8256440	End game.
8256440	8257440	End game.
8257440	8258440	End game.
8258440	8259440	Okay.
8259440	8264400	Anyways, um, so remember that cool rumor that we had that Netflix was going to be getting
8264400	8267440	some Zelda series or something?
8267440	8273960	Yeah, that's unfortunately not, not going to happen.
8273960	8281360	Nintendo basically said, Hey, that, uh, talk of the show is not based on correct information.
8281360	8283360	There's nothing new to share.
8283360	8284360	Sorry.
8285360	8286360	That was all the show.
8286360	8292120	Well, to be fair and maybe a little tinfoil haddish, Nintendo could be lying.
8292120	8294360	It wouldn't be the first time they've done it.
8294360	8295360	Right.
8298360	8305860	Um, I mean, you're opening up to, you're opening me up to like so many jokes, but yes, I won't
8305860	8306860	take those.
8306860	8312240	Um, I, yeah, I guess they could be lying, but it's kind of stupid.
8313120	8315120	Like, ha, we're not going to talk about it.
8315120	8318120	And we're never going to talk about it.
8318120	8319120	All right.
8319120	8323160	Uh, looking at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Tigerclaw wants to know why did it take Nintendo
8323160	8325120	this long to respond to it?
8325120	8329120	You know, I'm getting this weird feeling that nobody asked.
8329120	8334760	I mean, granted, they probably contacted the Nintendo PR department or whatever and got
8334760	8339040	the whole line of we don't comment on rumors or speculation, but this was the first time
8339040	8342920	that, you know, it was a wata that put the kibosh on this, right?
8342920	8346520	That somebody sat him down and asked him point blank.
8346520	8347640	So what about this rumor?
8347640	8352400	So I think that's part of the reason why it took this long to hear about it is it took
8352400	8356740	this long for somebody to ask him point blank in a situation where he couldn't necessarily
8356740	8358640	PR speak his way out of it.
8358640	8360640	So we'll see.
8360640	8366760	Uh, yeah, and SSG100 Matt says, uh, they're not going to talk about it until E3.
8366760	8370400	Dungeon Buster says not correct isn't really a flat out denial.
8370400	8377240	So we'll see anyhow, moving on to Minecraft, which still gets a lot of press even to this
8377240	8378240	day.
8378240	8383200	And, uh, this is, I find this story fascinating because what's happening with Minecraft, they're
8383200	8388880	going to be giving it for free in every Northern Ireland secondary school.
8388880	8394440	Uh, this is, uh, Culture Tech, which is a festival of technology and creative industries.
8394440	8398880	They've gotten funding from the department of culture, arts and leisure to supply 200
8398880	8401280	schools with download codes.
8401280	8405240	Each license is for a version of the game called Minecraft edu.
8405240	8409280	I didn't even know this was a thing, but you can look it up at Minecraft edu.com and it's
8409280	8412120	designed specifically for the classroom.
8412120	8416880	So this is going to be distributed thanks to this funding across all of Northern Ireland.
8416880	8421360	And I couldn't help but think about, you know, when I'm reading about this, I'm like, geez,
8421360	8425960	when I grew up, we were playing Oregon trail and number munchers, and now kids today they're
8425960	8428600	playing Minecraft in school.
8428600	8429960	That's kind of neat.
8429960	8430960	I love that idea.
8430960	8431960	I mean, I don't know.
8431960	8437640	I mean, I guess Minecraft certainly teaches them design and it's art and you know, that
8437640	8438640	all of that.
8438640	8444080	But, uh, you know, it's not, I guess it's in your face as eat all the multiples of three
8444080	8445680	or get eaten by a traggle.
8445680	8450860	You know, it's not quite as in your face as that, but I think that's pretty awesome.
8450860	8454500	So who knew that Netflix was what the kids were playing in schools these days?
8454500	8455500	I should Minecraft.
8455500	8457180	You mean what'd I say?
8457180	8458180	Netflix.
8458180	8459180	Oh, Rob.
8459180	8461940	I was looking at another story.
8461940	8462940	Minecraft.
8462940	8468320	Well, you know, one kid's got Minecraft open and the other kid buying them as Netflix open
8468320	8469320	or something.
8469320	8470320	That's what they do.
8470320	8471320	Anyway.
8471320	8472320	Uh, let's move on.
8472320	8473660	We're going to go to our mailbag every week.
8473660	8477860	You guys send us emails to participate at orange lounge radio.com, which is our email
8477860	8484080	address and dark Sakura dives into the mailbag and find some emails that she deems worthy
8484080	8486220	of reading on the program.
8486220	8487220	Dark Sakura.
8487220	8489300	How many do we have in the mailbag tonight?
8489300	8490300	Four four.
8490300	8492620	There was only one and I looked in there earlier.
8492620	8493620	Holy crap.
8493620	8494620	Four emails tonight.
8494620	8495620	All right.
8495620	8496620	Yes.
8496620	8497620	What's up orange lounge.
8497620	8499260	I'm sure you guys have noticed this trend.
8499260	8500700	Indiana Jones was brought back.
8500700	8502660	Pirates of the Caribbean is getting a fifth movie.
8502660	8503860	The Marvel movies keep coming.
8503860	8506240	The Hobbit was built from a book.
8506240	8510640	Uncharted for a new mass effect, new gears of war, more halo to become to stop hiring
8510640	8512400	good writers.
8512400	8516760	Do people stop going to school for writing and instead we have too many CG animators.
8516760	8517760	I'm confused.
8517760	8521960	The entertainment industry for mainly movies and games has literally been flooded with
8521960	8523680	prequel sequels, remakes.
8523680	8525040	What happened to creativity?
8525040	8528760	I'm going to stop and say there's nothing wrong with any mass effect game.
8528760	8530120	Okay.
8530120	8532360	I thought you guys might, you need to watch your step.
8532360	8535160	You need to watch it.
8535160	8538920	I thought you guys might enjoy this topic since lately so many of our AAA games are
8538920	8542480	broken, a remake or just another chapter in an already established IP.
8542480	8543600	Where did originality go?
8543600	8545840	Is indie all we have left for creative genius?
8545840	8547880	All the best is easy.
8547880	8554020	For the record, I see, I actually kind of see nothing wrong with having different stories
8554020	8557320	that we've come to love expanded on.
8557320	8559520	I don't want to see mass effect go away.
8559520	8560520	I'd like to see more.
8560520	8565760	I don't want it to end up, you know, getting Lucas sized, you know, like star Wars did.
8565760	8570760	Well it's funny you make that reference because I would honestly say to the emailer, it's
8570760	8575640	nothing really different from other forms of entertainment, specifically movies.
8575640	8577520	Don't movies have the same problem?
8577520	8580960	We just talked earlier in the show, they remade Arthur of all fricking movies.
8580960	8584000	I think that's what he was pointing out though when he mentioned all the Marvel movies and
8584000	8585000	stuff.
8585000	8586000	I guess that's true.
8586000	8592280	And keep in mind, the Marvel movies are part of a larger story, right?
8592280	8595600	It's like how many different issues of the comic books do we buy?
8595600	8599320	If you really want to, you know, see what's going on in the Marvel universe, they're making
8599320	8602640	a Deadpool movie and it looks awesome.
8602640	8603800	Did you see that costume picture?
8603800	8604880	Oh, that was the best.
8604880	8608560	I love and dark to see a point of this or somebody, no, somebody, no, it wasn't hard
8608560	8609560	to see it.
8609560	8610560	Sorry.
8610560	8611560	I missed tribute to some of you.
8611560	8615360	It was saying my buddy sake that did this on Twitter actually pointed out that Deadpool
8615360	8617960	on Twitter only follows Hello Kitty.
8617960	8618960	And that's it.
8618960	8620920	And he's like, how perfect is that?
8620920	8622040	That's amazing.
8622040	8623040	You know what though?
8623040	8627960	I thought I'd bet anything if I made a B Arthur account, it'd get followed.
8627960	8628960	Here you go.
8628960	8629960	I might have to do that.
8629960	8630960	Here you go.
8630960	8634040	Um, I'm going to do, I'm going to do RIP B Arthur.
8634040	8638840	But I do want us to actually, I knew a podcaster around here called spanking B Arthur.
8638840	8644080	So that's, that's the thing, but anyway, um, let me point out, uh, the whole, uh, again,
8644080	8649760	the whole ideas and everything, I really think that we're seeing in games really nothing
8649760	8653800	different from what you see in movies or even in books, you know?
8653800	8657440	And I wouldn't even say Indy's going to be a way to get around that because all you have,
8657440	8662400	a lot of indie guys are making games that are spiritual successors to things, you know,
8662400	8666320	it's like, well, we can't license the rights to make a sequel to this game, but we're going
8666320	8668080	to make one that's very similar to that.
8668080	8669080	Yeah.
8669080	8673600	So I don't know, but there's, there's original stuff and who cares sometimes going back to
8673600	8675520	like a franchise is pretty awesome.
8675520	8678320	Like, look, they rebooted Tomb Raider for like the eighth time.
8678320	8680880	So, and I, this time it was actually good.
8680880	8686920	I see a lot of indie games kind of saying like, we're really inspired by Metroidvania
8686920	8688980	and I don't see that as a bad thing whatsoever.
8688980	8691400	And I don't say, Oh, this means the Indies are running out of ideas.
8691400	8694580	I think this just says, Hey, the Indies are taking something they love and putting their
8694580	8695600	own spin on it.
8695600	8700480	So you know, I wonder if we'll ever see a metric cross Castlevania game.
8700480	8701480	Yeah.
8701480	8709240	I just want to see a game called Metroidvania, Samus finds herself in a haunted castle from
8709240	8710240	years ago.
8710240	8711240	Anyway.
8711240	8712240	Yeah.
8712240	8716480	I seriously, if I was going to sit down and do an indie game, I would totally do something
8716480	8718360	in the style of the guardian legend.
8718360	8719520	Awesome.
8719520	8721080	I need people to help me make this happen.
8721080	8725160	I'm telling you though, don't, don't, don't make the mistake I've made for this long.
8725160	8728440	Flacco said you need to check out velocity and I finally did and I was like, he was right.
8728440	8729440	I do.
8729440	8730440	I'm going to check that out.
8730440	8731440	Anyway.
8731440	8732440	Next email.
8732440	8733440	Yes.
8733440	8734440	Uh, greetings.
8734440	8735440	OLR.
8735440	8736440	It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
8736440	8737440	Serious turtle.
8737440	8739560	Rob, based on what you've been playing every week for some time now, I picked up reaper
8739560	8740560	of souls on sale.
8740560	8744560	I'm loving it and I'm definitely having a lonely turtle in need of friends.
8744560	8749640	Does OLR, does OLR or VOG have a clan or anything that I can join?
8749640	8753080	I'd love to play with members of the show or VOG community.
8753080	8754080	Nope.
8754080	8758600	Um, then, uh, no actually, horde house has one.
8758600	8759820	So I've got that.
8759820	8763320	So if you want to join the horde house, my other show, horde house, if you want to join
8763320	8767680	the horde house hotties, uh, we, I'm going to, I forgot to do it after the show this
8767680	8769920	week cause I still need to post to horde house.
8769920	8770920	I'm way behind.
8770920	8774960	Um, but, uh, on the forums I'll post more information, including battle tags of who
8774960	8777880	you can contact if you want to join the horde house hotties.
8777880	8779360	So we do have that.
8779360	8782880	And then, uh, he said, sends me condolences about grandma.
8782880	8783880	So thank you.
8783880	8787320	Um, Loki finish your game already so I can play it.
8787320	8790760	I'm looking forward to what you've come up with and I hope you're smart enough to sell
8790760	8793080	an amiibo for the game, especially separately.
8793080	8794080	Of course.
8794080	8795080	Of course.
8795080	8796920	And it won't do anything like regular amiibos.
8796920	8797920	Stop it.
8797920	8801200	I'll say it like I do in every email your show gets me through my Mondays, your loyal
8801200	8802200	turtle in Philly.
8802200	8803200	Serious turtle.
8803200	8804200	Thank you.
8804200	8805960	That, that means a lot that we can help you out with your Monday.
8805960	8806960	Really appreciate that.
8806960	8808960	I'm pulling up the next one.
8808960	8809960	Sure.
8809960	8810960	Sorry.
8810960	8811960	My voice is going out.
8811960	8812960	That's all right.
8812960	8813960	Look.
8813960	8814960	Oh, sorry.
8814960	8815960	I was going to read some comments in chat to help do the time here.
8815960	8820160	Uh, bonds, double a six saying I want a new, I've never ending story movie.
8820160	8821160	Mm hmm.
8821160	8825120	Uh, Bobby black will says, I hear there's a Hobbit remake coming soon and then a hunger
8825120	8826120	games remake.
8826120	8827120	Oh, who knows?
8827120	8828120	Who knows?
8828120	8829640	Uh, probably just a matter of time.
8829640	8833760	Black will says a never ending story remake with only females.
8833760	8834760	You never know.
8834760	8840120	Uh, if it's SGA 100, Matt says a mean girls remake with guys, uh, and you know, bonds
8840120	8843760	double a six says still, unless all the guys are gay.
8843760	8846680	That's actually on YouTube.
8846680	8847680	It's mean gays.
8847680	8848680	Look it up on YouTube.
8848680	8849680	Okay.
8849680	8851800	But I'd rather it be called bitchy boys.
8851800	8856880	Uh, and bonds double a six says still no unit racers meet remake.
8856880	8861080	Maybe that could be the game Nintendo announces to save the Wii U this holiday.
8861080	8863560	Uniracers you can I read the next email?
8863560	8864560	All right.
8864560	8866440	I think they're going to try to see peoples.
8866440	8872920	Um, and then the article about the final fantasy 15 director saying about the all male cast.
8873080	8876600	Um, at this point in the show, you probably covered the comments by final fantasy five
8876600	8883120	director Hajime Tabata about making the cast and final fantasy 15 all male to make the
8883120	8884560	game more approachable quotes.
8884560	8885840	No, we haven't.
8885840	8890960	I thought I would add in my thoughts because honestly it's bullshit.
8890960	8893200	And funny enough, it's not on our show tonight.
8893200	8895200	So here's our opportunity to bring it up.
8895200	8900140	Why, why couldn't he just say the decision to go the all male cast was part of the plot.
8900140	8904100	People who are aware that the final fantasy series of games are plot driven would have
8904100	8906260	bought that as an excuse, at least for a little while.
8906260	8910660	And some people are either of two different conclusions about this move.
8910660	8916620	One, this move is driven by a misinterpretation of the market for these games to squirt index
8916620	8921340	has joined Spanky and Alfalfa in the He-Man Woman Haters Club.
8921340	8926860	Stay care entertainment trainer sent from my iPad, which was in the email.
8926860	8927860	I know.
8927860	8928860	I know.
8928860	8935820	I, I get, I, I, it's not so much the fact that the story is about four guys that bothers
8935820	8936820	me.
8936820	8941700	Cause you know, I've seen enough movie, stand by me, stand by me is about four guys.
8941700	8942700	Right.
8942700	8944620	And that's just part of the story and the plot device.
8944620	8948540	But at the same time, I do understand you have this separate conversation about, you
8948540	8950260	know, diversity and games and dah, dah, dah.
8950260	8951260	And I get that.
8951260	8957260	And y'all know I'm for that, but I, do you want to elaborate on your thoughts real quick
8957260	8958260	here?
8958260	8959340	Who cares about diversity in games?
8959340	8960340	I do.
8960340	8961340	Yeah.
8961340	8964340	Who cares about there being four guys in this game that are the leads in the game.
8964340	8966380	This is what they decided that they want to do with it.
8966380	8967380	That's it.
8967380	8968380	If you don't like the game, don't play it.
8968380	8973780	I understand why should there be fucking females and males in every single goddamn game.
8973780	8975360	You can have all female cast.
8975360	8976500	You can have all male cast.
8976500	8978180	You can have a mix of both.
8978180	8979180	You can have cats and dogs.
8979180	8980660	Who gives a shit?
8980660	8982180	Here's here's what it boils down to.
8982180	8983420	Here's what it boils down to.
8983420	8988940	I'm fine with them wanting to do the game about four, four bros or whatever, you know,
8988940	8995180	and I'm sure there'll be supporting characters, but here's the thing is that clearly the industry
8995180	8997820	as a whole has an issue.
8997820	9004620	And I think if Square Enix can show that they can address the bigger issue, then fine.
9004620	9007500	They can make whatever these games are that they want to make, but the industry as a whole
9007500	9009540	kind of has to answer for the other issue.
9010540	9015740	This is literally like the only Final Fantasy game that they've had that's had all males
9015740	9018500	as like the party in the game.
9018500	9021820	Everything else has been like diversified, if you want to put it that way.
9021820	9026440	I mean, we've had fucking Yetis in there and stuff, but who cares?
9026440	9027440	That's what I'm saying.
9027440	9028440	Who gives a shit?
9028440	9030380	I mean, your rest of your games are all like that.
9030380	9032620	They want to make a game that has all guys in it.
9032620	9033620	Then fine.
9033620	9037780	They had a game already that had a female lead and she was the only playable character.
9037780	9040120	I think that's fucking even enough.
9040120	9042300	Why does it have to be like, oh, well, we don't like that?
9042300	9043780	Well, too bad you don't like it.
9043780	9044780	Don't play it.
9044780	9045780	I don't like sports games.
9045780	9048580	I'm not saying stop making sports games.
9048580	9049580	That's my thing.
9049580	9050580	It's like, who gives a shit?
9050580	9054300	It's their story that they want to tell if they feel that it needs four male characters
9054300	9057300	in the lead roles, then that's fine.
9057300	9061260	Once again, because of our industry and because it's diversified, we have a lot of people
9061260	9067700	out there creating games that have a bunch of different mixes of groups, race, gender,
9067700	9072500	you know, sexual orientation, species in their games.
9072500	9076980	I don't understand why we have to force other games to kind of go by that.
9076980	9080100	I mean, it's not like Final Fantasy is all male, all of your games.
9080100	9085400	For the record, we only have one confirmed asexual character in any game ever that actually
9085400	9087940	is flesh and blood, just saying.
9087940	9092220	Maya from Borderlands 2.
9092220	9096660	So I, again, I think we have to kind of, I don't think it's so much about the decision
9096660	9101300	to put the four, again, there's plenty of movies out there that do it too, but it's
9101300	9107940	about can the games industry as a whole show that level of maturity that the movies industry
9107940	9108940	had to show?
9108940	9111420	I just, I don't know.
9111420	9118460	I think the problem is much larger than one game, and you know, to Loki's credit, Square
9118460	9124740	Enix has brought us an amazing female protagonist in the form of Lara Croft, so in the Square
9124740	9127700	Enix games themselves, they tend to show a little bit of diversity.
9127700	9129820	Even Lightning, if you want to stick with Final Fantasy.
9129820	9130820	Sure.
9130820	9131820	So, you know, anyway.
9131820	9136620	Or fuck, Final Fantasy X-2 or whatever.
9136620	9137620	There you go.
9137620	9139020	All female cast right there.
9139020	9141180	I don't understand what the problem is.
9141180	9143260	Like, they've done it both ways.
9143260	9144440	I think that's pretty even.
9144440	9148660	I really don't think that they have, people have a say in, I guess, I mean, you can say
9148660	9152060	whatever you want, but I don't think they should do anything about it, because I think
9152060	9154900	they've fairly represented the whole gamut.
9154900	9155900	All right.
9155900	9161060	Looking at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
9161060	9162060	Let's see.
9162060	9165660	SSU100Matt suggesting Sid is a brilliant inventor and mechanic, and they made the character
9165660	9168940	as a woman in Final Fantasy XV.
9168940	9173500	Fifth Dream in chat says, I'm saying stop making sports games.
9173500	9179380	Brad from Pod Culture says, equal opportunity, a DOA game where you can adjust the junk jangle.
9179380	9181220	All right.
9181220	9182220	Anyhow.
9182220	9183220	I would play that.
9183220	9187220	I just want a game called junk jangle.
9187220	9190460	Anyhow.
9190460	9191460	Any more to email?
9191460	9192460	Yes.
9192460	9193460	We have another email.
9193460	9194460	Okay.
9194460	9195460	Cheese Rob.
9195460	9196460	Hello, LR.
9196460	9200020	I have to be at work early tomorrow, so I wasn't able to join you all live tonight,
9200020	9202940	but I need to say something.
9202940	9205860	Who was it that recommended the mobile game King of Thieves?
9205860	9206860	Was it Kaijuto?
9206860	9208860	Well, there's something I need to say to that person.
9208860	9211060	Are you happy with what you've done?
9211060	9212880	I'm now a hopeless addict.
9212880	9215580	My life is in tattered ruins, or maybe that's my dungeon.
9215580	9219100	Anyway, thank you very much for ruining my life, you jerk.
9219100	9222220	Now, excuse me while I steal someone's gems.
9222220	9226900	The stone league has only 24 hours left, and I'm 6,000 points behind.
9226900	9229660	Exploding ferrets upon your family, Aaron YYR.
9229660	9234460	PS, you should at least give this game a look if you don't mind having your life ruined.
9234460	9237820	Yes, that was Kaijuto that recommended that game to me.
9238700	9241580	He brought it up on the show, and then I brought it up on the show that, yes, I checked it
9241580	9243500	out, and yes, I had fun with it.
9243500	9244500	And so there you go.
9244500	9248060	So maybe in our little OL army, we all have our titles, right?
9248060	9249060	I'm the president.
9249060	9250580	Darth Vader is the overlord.
9250580	9251580	Loki's the pope.
9251580	9253340	Kaijuto can be the life ruiner.
9253340	9255220	There you go.
9255220	9256220	Ruiner of lives.
9256220	9258220	Is that it for emails tonight?
9258220	9259220	Yes.
9259220	9261500	By the way, do you have any pizza left?
9261500	9262500	Yes, I do.
9262500	9264300	May I have a slice?
9264300	9265300	You may.
9265300	9266500	It's terribly greasy, though.
9266500	9267500	I don't care.
9267500	9270380	I'm sitting here, my stomach rumbling.
9270380	9275420	Participate at, very important updates, participate at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send
9275420	9280220	us an email for next week, or the week after, or whenever you feel like you have something
9280220	9281220	to say.
9281220	9282220	You aren't shitting.
9282220	9285500	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
9285500	9288700	Every week on the show, we, are you okay, are you going to be okay over there, Dark
9288700	9289700	Sakura?
9289700	9290700	Oh my God, it's the whole week.
9290700	9294060	Okay, Dark Sakura is about ready to barf live in studio.
9294060	9295060	That's awkward.
9296060	9298060	But we're going to do the FUs of the week right now.
9314060	9315060	Dark Sakura.
9315060	9316060	Number one, fuck this pizza.
9316060	9317060	It's delicious.
9317060	9318060	And salty.
9318060	9319060	You weren't kidding.
9319060	9323060	Yeah, I told you there could be possibly too much bacon on that pizza.
9323060	9324060	It's pretty good.
9324060	9325060	I don't even care.
9325060	9326060	I'm so hungry right now.
9326060	9329060	I've had a pita today.
9329060	9339060	So, also FU to the guy driving the Corvette who decided it was a good idea to leave in
9339060	9342060	and out of traffic on single lane roads.
9342060	9345060	Yeah, fuck you.
9345060	9351060	And, fuck you to my sinus infection.
9351060	9352060	Loki?
9352060	9357060	I guess FU to having to still tweak my game.
9357060	9361060	I'm still making more levels and stuff, but like this other level I'm making that is supposed
9361060	9366060	to be focused on kind of teaching you that you can jump in your car.
9366060	9369060	I still have to figure out how I'm going to break it yet.
9369060	9371060	And it's kind of annoying.
9371060	9372060	Invisible ceilings.
9372060	9378060	No, no, no, not invisible ceilings, but I need something else like obstacles in a way
9378060	9379060	or something.
9379060	9380060	I just haven't figured out what.
9381060	9382060	I don't know.
9382060	9383060	It's just something ridiculous.
9383060	9386060	I haven't quite gotten there yet.
9386060	9387060	Is that it?
9387060	9388060	Yeah.
9388060	9391060	I just don't know what I'm going to do with that.
9391060	9392060	Oh, God.
9392060	9395060	I kind of have a lot I want to say in this FU segment, but I don't really have the words
9395060	9396060	for them right now.
9396060	9403060	So I'm just going to say FU to complicated things that happen.
9403060	9408060	I'm being vague for a reason, but there's just some complicated things that happened
9408060	9409060	recently.
9410060	9411060	Is it that thing?
9411060	9413060	I've been thinking about a lot.
9413060	9415060	Yes, we talked about it briefly before the show tonight.
9415060	9419060	And so you know, I'm kind of like I have a lot I want to say and yet I don't want to
9419060	9420060	say it.
9420060	9424060	So I will add in equal amounts of FU attention.
9424060	9429060	So I apologize for being vague, but at the same time, this is just like where I've fucking
9429060	9430060	been at for like 48 hours.
9430060	9435060	So FU to being vague.
9435060	9438060	Sorry, that's all I got.
9438060	9441060	All right, let's move on with a couple more stories.
9441060	9446060	And then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype,
9446060	9448060	Orange Lounge Radio.
9448060	9449060	Loki.
9449060	9454060	So this is kind of disappointing, but I guess it makes sense considering, you know, the
9454060	9456060	events that have transpired.
9456060	9464060	But apparently Gen Con is looking to relocate from their location in Indiana.
9464060	9470060	They're basically saying that, you know, they for a decade more than a decade Indianapolis
9470060	9475060	has provided tremendous hospitality and accommodation to our attendees culminating in an estimated
9475060	9479060	economic impact of more than 50 million dollars to the city.
9479060	9484060	Gen Con and its attendees look forward to receiving the same warm Hoosier hospitality
9484060	9486060	throughout the term of our contract.
9486060	9492060	It says legislation that could allow for refusal of services or discrimination against our
9492060	9493060	attendees.
9493060	9497060	We'll have a direct negative impact on the state's economy and we'll factor in our decision
9497060	9502060	in making on hosting the convention in the state of Indiana in future years.
9502060	9507060	So basically because of SB 101, they're thinking of moving it.
9507060	9511060	I do want to say I have to jump in here with a follow up because I was following this pretty
9511060	9514060	closely because obviously, you know, when I heard the news about what happened in Indiana,
9514060	9516060	I was just like, what the fuck?
9516060	9518060	You know, like I think many people were.
9518060	9522060	Gen Con actually came out since that first came out and actually did reiterate that they're
9522060	9526060	kind of stuck there for, uh, until 2020 because of contractual obligations.
9526060	9530060	So they will actually not be relocating next year despite the threat.
9530060	9536060	However, they really bent over backwards to say, you know, the local businesses that we're
9536060	9540060	going to work with here in Indianapolis are not signing up for the, and they're not going
9540060	9541060	to discriminate.
9541060	9544060	We want to welcome all our attendees, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.
9544060	9546060	Uh, it leaves, I don't know.
9546060	9551060	I'm, I'm very, I'm very torn on this because I do feel like there's probably a lot of people
9551060	9556060	in Indianapolis and Gen Con that want nothing to do with this fucking law.
9556060	9562060	Like they want nothing to do with this back at S word Z and, or excuse me, bullshittery
9562060	9565060	since I learned that word tonight and what happened in Indiana is bullshittery.
9565060	9566060	Let's be real.
9566060	9568060	Uh, so.
9568060	9575060	I kind of understand from that perspective, but I also understand the need to take an
9575060	9580060	iron fist and have an iron stance because the reality of the situation and delivering
9580060	9585060	that message to the governor that this is not okay, doesn't get delivered otherwise.
9585060	9590060	But I think what's happening, not to get too political here on OLR, but obviously I have
9590060	9597060	somewhat of an interest in this story here because the reality is I, with Alan, could
9597060	9600060	one day decide, I don't know why we would do this, but we, well, we might decide we
9600060	9601060	want to go to Gen Con.
9601060	9603060	I do have friends that go to Gen Con and have a good time.
9603060	9610060	We might go there to Indiana and somebody could legally choose to discriminate against
9610060	9611060	me.
9611060	9614060	And so I'm kind of like, that's fucking fucked.
9614060	9618060	So, I mean, I appreciate that the organizers of Gen Con are making sure that's not going
9618060	9621060	to happen, any business near them or any of that stuff.
9621060	9625060	But obviously a lot of stuff is happening with other companies.
9625060	9629060	Like I got to give massive props to like Salesforce and what is that?
9629060	9630060	Angie's List.
9630060	9631060	Is that what that site's called?
9632060	9633060	Yeah, Angie's List.
9633060	9639060	Who have come out big time to like say, not okay, and we're not going to do business in
9639060	9640060	a state.
9640060	9641060	And the guy acts so confused.
9641060	9644060	Well, why is everybody being mean to me?
9644060	9645060	Right?
9645060	9648060	Because you're a shit?
9648060	9653060	I would hope that the people of Indiana who do not believe in this bullshittery, and I
9653060	9655060	know there's decent people in Indiana.
9655060	9660060	I know some of y'all listen to this show, hi, act against this.
9661060	9662060	It blows my mind.
9662060	9669060	Here in the state of California in 2003, we recalled our governor over rolling blackouts
9669060	9670060	and power issues.
9672060	9675060	But the governor of Indiana is going to be allowed to stay after this.
9675060	9678060	Did you see what the mayor of San Francisco is doing?
9678060	9681060	Oh, they stopped all traveled Indiana.
9681060	9683060	Oh, officially sanctioned travel.
9683060	9687060	And I was reading about other places refusing to do trade business.
9688060	9691060	I just, it blows my mind people.
9691060	9692060	It blows my mind anyway.
9692060	9698060	So, uh, I'm, I'm a little sad to hear that Gen Con couldn't put its iron fist down, but
9698060	9704060	I also, I'm also trying to be fair and realize that a lot of these businesses in Indianapolis
9704060	9707060	probably want nothing to do with this fucking law and they're probably pissed about it.
9707060	9713060	So again, to sum it up, my voice is if you're pissed about it, you need to let your lawmakers
9713060	9719060	know, don't be passive about this shit because there's other people that aren't going to
9719060	9720060	react so passively.
9721060	9722060	Just saying.
9722060	9723060	All right.
9723060	9724060	Um, let's see.
9724060	9728060	Um, and Brad from pod culture saying I'm from Indiana and I'm kind of ashamed of that fact
9728060	9729060	right now.
9729060	9730060	Watch what you say.
9730060	9734060	I got that statement, got the Dixie chicks and a whole lot of trouble of my, you know,
9734060	9735060	my friend Susan.
9735060	9736060	Yeah.
9736060	9737060	She moves in Susan.
9737060	9738060	Yeah.
9738060	9739060	Yeah.
9739060	9740060	She's from Indiana.
9740060	9741060	She said the same thing.
9741060	9745220	There are tons of awesome people from Indiana of which these are two people I would put
9745220	9749500	near the top of the list, but I will come out and say that when the Alabama Supreme
9749500	9754060	Court was pulling the bullshit, I was really ashamed to be from there.
9754060	9758180	And I'm going to say it on radio, I love where I'm from.
9758180	9761780	I am super disappointed in my home state.
9761780	9765820	I think because you all know, I volunteered for the no on eight campaign when that whole
9765820	9770620	thing went down and yeah, no, I know, but when, when it, when it ended up passing, I
9770620	9772140	don't know if I would say I was in shame.
9772140	9775940	I was ashamed, but I was just embarrassed.
9775940	9778820	I was just embarrassed.
9778820	9781060	I'm still embarrassed that there's like that black mark.
9781060	9784940	I mean, I realized it all got fixed up since then, but I'm still kind of like, that was
9784940	9787220	just embarrassing.
9787220	9793260	But you know, even in that short time, I have actually talked to people one on one that
9793260	9796800	said, I voted yes on eight and I was wrong.
9796800	9798140	I've changed my mind.
9798140	9799440	I've thought differently.
9799440	9803200	And so you have to kind of look at that and go, okay, progress.
9803200	9804200	We're making progress.
9804200	9805200	It's happening.
9805200	9808880	I've talked to people who voted on it and said they would vote on it again.
9808880	9810640	And I was like, why am I talking to you?
9810640	9815960	That would be my reaction by Felicia.
9815960	9821040	And the thing is, is that I really, it's, it's, I'm so disgusted with it.
9821040	9825300	I'm literally disgusted to think that there are still people in this world who think that
9825300	9827520	having that kind of attitude is right.
9827520	9828520	Yeah.
9828600	9832840	If you didn't know, if you didn't catch on to it already, I'm a gay guy who's here doing
9832840	9837960	the show and I live with my partner and we're in a, we're in a relationship and we've been
9837960	9842680	a long-term five years and, and you know, we're, we're, we're pretty decent people and
9842680	9850240	I'm not really looking to corrupt people or I'm not, I don't have a fucking agenda.
9850240	9855880	My agenda is to make sure the cat gets fed, uh, go to work every day so I can, you know,
9855920	9858760	afford to have a place for me and my partner to live.
9858760	9861400	I don't, I, I like to play video games too.
9861400	9862400	Like a lot of you do.
9862400	9866760	We're just, we're, we're not fucking like crazy people.
9866760	9869320	Crazy people are in all sorts of, sure.
9869320	9870560	There's gay, crazy people out there.
9870560	9872360	There's a lot of straight, crazy people too.
9872360	9874640	There's a lot of white, crazy people, a lot of black, crazy people.
9874640	9877320	There are crazy people everywhere.
9877320	9885840	As I told my mother, don't judge the entire LBGTQA et cetera community based on the praise
9885840	9889000	it's a little crazy.
9889000	9894120	Now the one thing I was going to say is that I, now I grew up Southern Baptist.
9894120	9900320	The attitudes that have formed this had a hand in my raising and I will say this, if
9900320	9909320	y'all want to know what the hell the commandment is, it's one love God to love your neighbor.
9909320	9910320	That's it.
9910320	9911320	There's nothing on there.
9911320	9914240	There's no except in that part of scripture at all.
9914240	9917820	So the moment I hear this shit, I say, what does it say that in scripture you pointed
9917820	9918820	out to me?
9918820	9919820	Yeah.
9919820	9923220	No, I, and I got to watch how far down the political religious route we go because we
9923220	9924220	are a video game show.
9924220	9928020	But at the same time, these are, these are issues that like fucking impact me.
9928020	9929760	This is, this is my life.
9929760	9934520	You know, when, when people are saying that, you know, there might be a business or a restaurant
9934520	9940960	that you might go into that doesn't serve you because you know, of some agenda they
9940960	9941960	made up.
9941960	9944600	And that speech also gives people the right to pick at that place.
9944600	9945600	Yeah.
9945600	9951280	Anyway, moving on, uh, let's talk about, let's end on some positivity and charity and good
9951280	9952280	things.
9952280	9957620	And we're going to talk about a guy who you may not have knew was gay, just from my hometown
9957620	9964240	and just, just happens to be a gay guy running like the biggest funky, funky, get down in
9964240	9965240	funk.
9965240	9970200	Uh, the biggest funky company in the world, Apple, uh, Apple CEO, Tim Cook has mentioned
9970200	9975960	that he's going to donate his fortune to charity, uh, and that he's been quietly donating to
9975960	9977880	causes for quite some time now.
9977880	9984240	Uh, he looks forward to when he can actually just, uh, you know, engage in meaningful philanthropy
9984240	9986080	on a greater scale later on in life.
9986080	9989400	So I'm imagining talking about retirement and those sorts of things.
9989400	9993680	Um, so I mean, in some of these other interviews, in some of the interviews and so forth, he
9993680	9998600	said that he has enough set aside for like the nephew to get his nephew through college
9998600	9999920	and all this stuff.
9999920	10004480	But the vast majority of his fortune, he plans to turn around and donate to charity.
10004480	10008560	Now I'm not saying everybody out there has to donate all of their money to charity.
10008560	10010360	And what does this have to do with gaming?
10010360	10013200	Well, Apple's getting a bigger and bigger presence.
10013200	10019240	You know, 30% of whatever you buy on iTunes, uh, goes to Apple and some of that money goes
10019240	10020240	to Tim Cook.
10020240	10025640	So, you know, it's nice to know at least that some people want to turn it around and put
10025640	10028900	that money back into their community in one way or another.
10028900	10032040	But at the same time, if Tim Cook had come out and said, you know, I want to make sure
10032040	10036980	that all my relatives are being provided for and so forth, I would, I would have been cool
10036980	10037980	with that too.
10037980	10042860	But I think it's really cool when you can say, I'm going to provide for this person,
10042860	10046020	but to a point, you know, and then they're going to have to go out and make their own
10046020	10048220	riches between providing and enabling.
10048220	10049220	Yeah.
10049220	10052500	I think that's, that's a good way of putting it just makes me super, super happy because
10052500	10053500	he's from my hometown.
10053500	10054500	Yeah.
10054500	10055500	So, all right.
10055500	10056500	There you go.
10056500	10061500	So, uh, good to know that some of that money you're putting into iTunes today, uh, might
10061500	10064300	go around and end up in charitable things in the future.
10064300	10068820	But to be fair and, you know, to, to make sure everybody gets their praises, obviously
10068820	10072940	Bill Gates, Microsoft, Bill Gates may not be as intimately involved in Microsoft as
10072940	10077180	he once was, but certainly super charitable guy himself does a lot of great things and
10077180	10078380	brings awareness to that stuff.
10078380	10082260	So there's a lot of awesome charitable people in the tech industry and, uh, you know, we
10082260	10083500	should tip our hat to him.
10083500	10084500	All right.
10084500	10089540	Uh, we're going to get to the phone lines right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR and your username
10089540	10090540	on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.
10090540	10095260	Uh, if you want to give us a call, we're going to get to some calls here live on the show
10095260	10099860	and then I'll also check in with Loki and see if he has any last minute topics.
10099860	10104340	Uh, let's go to the phones, however, right now, cause I think we have the phones lighting
10104340	10105340	up.
10105340	10106340	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
10106340	10107340	Who's this?
10107340	10108340	Hi, this is Ragingator.
10108340	10109340	Hey, Ragingator.
10109340	10110340	How you doing?
10110340	10111340	How about yourself?
10111340	10112340	Good.
10112340	10113340	Good.
10113340	10116420	Ragingator, as you were calling yourself earlier in the show with a new haircut.
10116420	10117420	I see.
10117420	10118420	It looks like you buzzed your hair there.
10118420	10119420	How you doing?
10119420	10124300	Uh, yeah, I was in dire need of a haircut, you know, so I can't figure what the hell.
10124300	10125780	It is sure as possible.
10125780	10127180	Well, it looks good, my friend.
10127180	10128180	How you doing?
10128180	10129180	What's on your mind tonight?
10129180	10130180	Uh, yeah.
10130180	10132180	A couple of things to note.
10132180	10137700	Um, I, you know, if you personally have noticed or not, uh, I would imagine you being kind
10137700	10145780	of busy and whatnot, but, um, right now, if you look on Steam, there's, um, uh, this
10145780	10154620	weekend, there's a sale on, uh, all of, uh, Sega's, uh, titles, uh, you know, if I remember
10154620	10155620	right there.
10155620	10157180	You want me to bring you up?
10157180	10159580	I did see the sale itself on Steam.
10159580	10163020	I did log into Steam this weekend because I looked at it and I went, ooh, Sega stuff's
10163020	10164020	on sale.
10164020	10165900	I need to make sure I have everything I want.
10165900	10169340	And sure enough, things like Space Channel 5, I have them in my library.
10169340	10172140	I just haven't played them since I bought them.
10172140	10174020	And I brought, that's how I brought Deep Shame.
10174020	10179340	I'm jumping out of a club, ugh, God, I, you know, not to sound like I'm bragging on, uh,
10179340	10185620	that's not my intention, but I got shit ton of games myself and, uh, I only played a handful
10185620	10191020	of them and I, of all my games, I haven't beaten a single one yet.
10191020	10197380	Uh, but anyway, you know, getting back to my point, I can't figure, you know, this
10197380	10201980	would probably be something that Sky would be interested in, uh, I already know that
10201980	10210980	Dr. Sakura noticed because I seen, uh, she bought themself, but, um, but anyway, there
10210980	10217620	was a second point to my, uh, call, but, uh, I'm starting to go, you know, get, uh, I'm
10217620	10218620	brain farting.
10218620	10228020	I forget what I was going to mention, uh, ooh, sorry, brain fart, um, you know, oh yeah,
10228020	10234700	you know, uh, you know, well, since I'm brain farting on my second point, I'm going to make
10234700	10237700	something up on the, uh, on the fly.
10237700	10247380	Um, now, you know, if, uh, since, uh, uh, Sega's, uh, you know, put a lot of the Sega
10247380	10255180	Genesis stuff, uh, on Steam, uh, you know, is there any, like, older console games that
10255180	10265180	you would love to, uh, see on, uh, Steam or, uh, there's also some, uh, no, just, uh, console
10265180	10271020	games, but arcade games, like, uh, I've seen Ikaruga on there, there was arcade game and
10271020	10276100	of course there's the Pac-Man games, so on and so forth, other, you know, older arcade
10276100	10280020	games as well that you would like to see on Steam.
10280020	10281020	That's a really good question.
10281020	10284940	What kind of, like, old arcade or old console games would you like to see on Steam?
10284940	10289620	I think things that I remember from my youth with a strong co-op angle from it, um, and,
10289620	10293460	you know, things come to mind, like the Ninja Turtles game and the Simpsons arcade game,
10293460	10297100	but I thought the Simpsons arcade game was on, I don't know if it's on Steam, but I thought
10297100	10301540	that was something they put on PC when they ported to all the other consoles some time
10301540	10302540	ago.
10302540	10305340	It was on PC a long time ago, too, because I had an old floppy version of it.
10305340	10306880	Oh, god, that's right!
10306880	10310420	There was, like, the whole, like, you could play on EGA and CGA and all, oh my god, that's
10310420	10311420	right!
10311420	10314420	Well, it was CGA, but yeah, it was, it was, it was, it was a version.
10314420	10318980	Oh yeah, no, I remember, that's right, that's old school, but, um, yeah, I, I mean, I think
10318980	10322480	about, like, arcade experiences like that and those are the types of things I would
10322520	10323720	like to see on Steam.
10323720	10326040	Is The Grid on Steam?
10326040	10328880	Because I know we used to play a lot of that at, uh, Golf Land.
10328880	10333360	Uh, maybe, uh, I don't know if this is old school, but maybe, like, Initial D. I don't
10333360	10335160	know, you guys have any answers for this?
10335160	10337360	What kind of, like, old school, either arcade or PC?
10337360	10339640	The Grid's probably emulated through MAME now.
10339640	10341120	I guess that's true.
10341120	10342120	I don't know how well it would work.
10342120	10344400	I wish Planet Harrier actually worked.
10344400	10346400	I haven't been able to get it to work yet.
10346400	10347400	Mm-hmm.
10347400	10349080	There you go.
10349080	10350080	Some of our answers here.
10350080	10351080	What about you, buddy?
10351680	10358600	Oh, there's so many, uh, unless it's, uh, hard to give a short, concise answer, uh,
10358600	10367280	just off the top of my head, maybe some old, uh, you know, virtually, you know, the entire
10367280	10374480	back catalog of, uh, Konami, you know, arcade games, uh, and miracle games like Galaga,
10375480	10384280	you know, the 1980-19, like you mentioned, the Simpsons game, uh, so on and so forth.
10384280	10394480	Um, and, ooh, I mean, there's so many games, it's hard to, uh, give a short answer.
10394480	10400480	I mean, I can go on all nights and, you know, rallying them off as they occur to me, so,
10400480	10410480	um, you know, I, I love retro stuff, and, uh, you know, even, and, uh, you know, when,
10410480	10417480	uh, whatchamacallit, uh, you know, Game Room was out for, uh, you know, uh, you know, Xbox
10417480	10418480	360, and, uh,
10418480	10421480	God, you're gonna taunt me with memories of this again, aren't you?
10421480	10424480	You're gonna taunt me with all the things that Game Room could have and should have
10424480	10427480	been until the plug was prematurely pulled.
10427480	10429480	Are we really gonna do this again?
10430480	10431480	You're right.
10431480	10438480	Yeah, oh, oh, yeah, um, not to quickly, you know, uh, switch tracks up before I forget
10438480	10446480	again, um, if you recall, just at the end of, uh, Bobby's show, when he was taking calls,
10446480	10455480	I called in, and, uh, I mentioned, uh, the arcade stick that I had recently, uh, bought,
10455480	10462480	uh, you know, and I, I was seriously thinking, uh, thinking of doing a review, uh, for the
10462480	10468480	site, because I, you know, to the best of my knowledge, I hardly ever see, uh, you know,
10468480	10472480	a hardware review for, uh, the sites, unless I'm overlooking something.
10472480	10474480	No, I, uh, why not?
10474480	10483480	Which, uh, now, uh, Bobby mentioned, uh, emailing, uh, emailing, uh, a review, uh, which email,
10483480	10490480	you know, address do I, uh, send, uh, send out the review to, or do I send it to, uh,
10490480	10493480	participate OLR, or?
10493480	10498480	No, send it, send it to me directly at vognetwork, rob at vognetwork.com, and, uh, I'll look it
10498480	10501480	over, and if I have any feedback, I'll let you know, and, you know, yeah, we're always
10501480	10504480	looking for more people that want to contribute to VOG Network.
10504480	10506480	Um, I have to be very careful sometimes.
10506480	10507480	It's a slippery slope.
10507480	10512480	I don't want to go out and quote-unquote recruit writers, because we're an all-volunteer organization,
10512480	10516480	and I realize there's writers out there that do great work and deserve to get paid for
10516480	10520480	that work, and, but the reality is, you know, we're pretty much, you know, I don't get paid
10520480	10521480	for this podcast.
10521480	10526480	We actually pay out of pocket to do the site, so as it is right now, we're pretty much an
10526480	10530480	all-volunteer, you know, group, but if somebody wants to contribute something, I've got a
10530480	10532480	platform to run that contribution on.
10532480	10536480	Let's do it, you know, so this is why I don't like to tell people what to write about.
10536480	10541480	I want to just say, hey, voice of geeks, geeks, lend me your voices.
10541480	10542480	What do you want to say?
10542480	10543480	And see what happens.
10543480	10546480	So, I think if I were to start bossing people around, then I'd have failed.
10546480	10547480	Yeah, I've definitely seen your point.
10547480	10557480	Uh, you know, honestly, I just felt like contributing something, you know, aside from the quote-unquote
10557480	10563480	unofficial reviews I posted into the forums, uh, you know, regarding the two magic, uh,
10563480	10568480	recent Magic the Gallery games that came out, uh, for the past few years, I thought I would
10568480	10574480	do something more official that would be on the main site rather than just the forums.
10574480	10578480	Well, send me an email, and that goes for anybody out there, just, just not to make
10578480	10581480	this show just about you, Rage Nator, so this goes about for everybody out there.
10581480	10583480	If you're interested, uh, send me an email.
10583480	10586480	So, uh, I will look forward to reading your review soon.
10586480	10590480	Uh, actually, I didn't hear the very end of Bobby's, uh, show, uh, when you called in
10590480	10594480	because our guest had just showed up, so, um, I will, I will look for that when you
10594480	10595480	email it.
10595480	10596480	All right?
10596480	10600480	Uh, sure, yeah, you know, in fact, I'll, you know, get started on the, the, you know,
10600480	10603480	writing the review, uh, you know, first thing tomorrow.
10603480	10604480	Sounds good.
10604480	10606480	All right, my friend, I gotta let you know just so we can get more calls.
10606480	10607480	Take care, my friend.
10607480	10608480	All right.
10608480	10609480	Good night.
10609480	10610480	Bye.
10610480	10611480	Later.
10611480	10614480	All right, 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, but it's lighting
10614480	10615480	up tonight.
10615480	10617480	Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
10617480	10622480	Hello, if you can hear me, I can't hear you, so make sure you're talking into your microphone
10622480	10623480	or you...
10623480	10624480	Whoa, Legend of Zaku here.
10624480	10625480	Hey, Zaku, how you doing, buddy?
10625480	10626480	Fine, as usual.
10626480	10628480	What's on your mind?
10628480	10634480	Oh, nothing much the usual of, uh, trying to get through seeing you and Paxis a few
10634480	10635480	weeks back.
10635480	10638480	I know, it was literally for, like, two seconds that I saw you.
10638480	10642480	Yeah, well, I mean, it was, yeah, we were at that party that Friday night.
10642480	10644480	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
10644480	10648480	The, the, the, and I forget the name of it, 16-bit Boston or something like that, I know
10648480	10652480	the gals from Electric Sisterhood were co-sponsoring it, but yeah, good times.
10652480	10659480	Yup, I mean, yeah, I haven't been, well, let's just say aside from, like, whoring out FSX
10659480	10664480	for the past few weeks as usual, spending godly amounts of money on planes, such as
10664480	10672480	60 bucks, almost $60 on a 747, but aside from that, like, GTA 5's coming out on PC, and
10672480	10677480	I guess, you know, because obviously I'm probably gonna get suckered into getting that one,
10677480	10681480	I'm wondering whether or not it's, like, too late at this point, because, you know,
10681480	10686480	I've, I've had to, like, plunk down money for the PS3 version, and after a few months
10686480	10691480	of beating the game, there was nothing really other than to try GTA Online, and then now
10691480	10695480	it's whether or not I should, you know, whether or not it's even worth getting back into it,
10695480	10700480	even with the new Heist patch and everything.
10701480	10707480	I know, it's kind of, like, because of the fact that I, I've already, I've already, like,
10707480	10712480	already sailed that ship, and whether or not I should go back on board with the PC version
10712480	10716480	because of the new graphics and the fact that I have a card that can actually handle it.
10716480	10719480	Is that tough to want to buy the same game multiple times? Because maybe I'm the wrong
10719480	10724480	person to ask about that, because can we talk about how many times I bought Mass Effect 3?
10724480	10729480	Yeah, and the fact, and the fact of the matter that I haven't even bought that one yet,
10729480	10735480	but I guess, yeah, whether or not that justifies, you know, the fact that I bought a GTX 970
10735480	10736480	over the holidays.
10736480	10741480	Really? Isn't that the fancy one? Isn't that the fancy pants graphic card?
10741480	10746480	Yeah, and that was, and that's the thing, it's like, I had to pull together not just
10746480	10750480	birthday and Christmas money to, you know, soften the blow, and then I had to take out
10750480	10755480	a little bit of extra savings just to make, you know, just to get it through.
10755480	10760480	But it's micro center, so it's not, that purchase has not gone in vain.
10760480	10766480	Because at least, you know, with the two-year warranty, I could just hand it in, no questions
10766480	10770480	asked, and, you know, get store credit for it for another card.
10770480	10774480	Let me ask you about this, because I don't think we've had you on the show since this
10774480	10779480	news kind of broke, and I think, I want to say you were actually the first person to
10779480	10782480	kind of tell me this was going on, and then I started to get messages from everywhere,
10782480	10785480	but this is, of course, I'm going to ask you, because I know you're a long time supporter
10785480	10788480	of Konami and music games and so forth, I want to ask you about the whole, you know,
10788480	10796480	shutdown and the EMUs global. As a Bomani fan, what do you think about where all this is going?
10796480	10802480	Probably nowhere, just because of that company's disappointment.
10802480	10808480	I mean, let's be honest here, the only time they really have taken risks was back in the
10809480	10812480	days when this whole, you know, when music games were really starting to take off.
10812480	10818480	Like, if it wasn't for them, like, taking the risk of bringing DDR worldwide, then yeah,
10818480	10823480	I would have stayed in Japan. But then once they take the risk, then they become too comfortable
10823480	10831480	with their position. And once they feel threatened as a result of competing forces,
10831480	10836480	like, you know, for Pump It Up and, you know, back in the day with ITG,
10836480	10843480	they resort to using the, you know, the courts in order to seek remedies for that.
10843480	10849480	That is a really, I gotta say, that's a really succinct and good way of kind of summing it all up,
10849480	10855480	and I think it's similar to something I've definitely said on the show before,
10855480	10859480	is that they were too afraid to take risks, and then when other people took the risks and it paid off,
10859480	10865480	they were like, how did we get left in the dust? Shouldn't this have been our idea?
10865480	10868480	Was it our idea? Do we have a patent?
10868480	10874480	It's not even like them being completely, you know, risk takers in that sense.
10874480	10879480	It's more them being risk adverse and being reactive instead of being proactive.
10879480	10887480	Supernova was a reaction to ITG. And then, you know, everything else like,
10887480	10897480	and then further iterations of DER were essentially a reaction to Pump It Up, like, you know, early on.
10897480	10904480	But I'm not holding my breath just because, as I said, even with the shakeup in leadership of that company,
10904480	10910480	a lot of sources, from what I'm hearing, are still very wary of bringing EMU stateside,
10910480	10913480	short of like round one taking care of that.
10913480	10920480	And that really is yet to be seen whether or not round one has a viable chance expanding.
10920480	10923480	I mean, sure, they're definitely hitting up the East Coast right now.
10923480	10927480	From what I've seen on their site, they're trying to build one near Massachusetts.
10927480	10936480	But as I said, this whole arcade scene here, to be honest, it's kind of like it's dying.
10936480	10940480	And this is what Kyle Ward alluded to when I was talking to him at PAX East.
10940480	10946480	He pretty much said that the front, I mean, the front right now is pretty much mobile.
10946480	10954480	Getting re-raved to mobile was, you know, was probably one of the early, the initial goals aside from the arcade version.
10954480	10961480	But even the new game that he had out, the one that we have to follow the actual notes for each measure.
10961480	10962480	I believe it's called Ditto Beat.
10962480	10963480	Yeah, something like that.
10963480	10970480	And he basically targeted mobile first because that's the one with the lowest amount of overhead and risk.
10970480	10971480	Sure.
10971480	10976480	Anybody, just about any couple of devs, a small dev team could easily turn out a mobile app.
10976480	10980480	Yeah, you're still taking a risk with time, but yeah, as far as the financial risk, yeah.
10980480	10990480	But the financial, the fiscal overhead is so low that you definitely don't need massive, you know, you don't need multimillion dollar budgets to pull it off.
10990480	10994480	You can do it with a simple bank loan or a small Kickstarter.
10994480	10995480	Right.
10995480	10999480	I mean, obviously you don't pay yourself, but you wait until you actually turn a profit.
10999480	11000480	Right, right.
11000480	11002480	In order to insure it.
11002480	11006480	But yeah, it's unfortunate. We kind of knew this was going to happen.
11006480	11014480	I remember talking to the guy who actually ran Program World back, you know, like many Otakons ago, you know, almost four years ago.
11014480	11020480	And he pretty much said that the day when he got to C and D from them is the day that they start winding down.
11020480	11028480	Because he kind of knew that once round one started expanding here that it was only a matter of time before they would find out.
11028480	11029480	Yeah.
11029480	11032480	All right. Well, my friend, I got to let you go so we can try to squeeze in one more call.
11032480	11034480	But thanks for the call, for lending your voice.
11034480	11035480	Yup.
11035480	11036480	All right.
11036480	11037480	Have a good night.
11037480	11038480	Take care.
11038480	11039480	Night.
11039480	11056480	All right.
11056480	11057480	Twat.
11057480	11059480	Loki, any last minute stories?
11059480	11063480	Yeah, they announced that Halo 5 is coming out October 27th.
11063480	11065480	Oh, wow. Was that just announced?
11065480	11066480	Yeah.
11066480	11067480	We somehow missed that.
11067480	11068480	All right. Well, there you go. Now we know.
11068480	11071480	We do have one more call here. Let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
11071480	11075480	Hey, hey. It's a tired and exhausted Ranma.
11075480	11078480	Why are you tired and exhausted? Was there a con this weekend?
11078480	11082480	Yeah, that and I was stuck in Jersey for 30 minutes more than I should have been.
11082480	11087480	Oh, you poor thing. I wish our guest Gabriel from Jersey was still here to hear that.
11087480	11089480	Yeah.
11089480	11091480	Well, what con did you go to this week?
11092480	11099480	Zenkai Con. It's out in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. It's a nice hybrid of anime, fantasy, sci-fi, and all that cool stuff.
11099480	11104480	Isn't Lancaster, like, right in the heart of Dutch country? Or, no, I'm sorry. Amish Dutch country?
11104480	11109480	Yeah, you passed the giant Dutch wonderland going to the convention center.
11109480	11110480	That's awesome.
11110480	11111480	Yes.
11111480	11117480	So, you were out there with the Amish in your cosplays.
11117480	11123480	Well, no, actually, I saw them when we were in Walmart picking up stuff for The Room, but, you know.
11123480	11127480	Now, did somebody actually cosplay as the Amish to go to the con?
11127480	11129480	No, not to my knowledge.
11129480	11133480	God, people, do I have to do all the thinking for you? I'm just kidding.
11133480	11137480	All right, all those silliness aside, how was the con?
11137480	11147480	It was fun overall, despite, you know, the issues I had to deal with in The Room, you know, but other than that, made some great friends, had some good times.
11147480	11156480	One thing I love about this con, it's like a cool down convention for me. In between all the cons that I go to, this is where I can just go and relax and have a good time.
11156480	11163480	Nice. Good. Even though you're still worn out, but I know how that goes. You need a vacation from the vacation. I know exactly how that goes.
11163480	11166480	Even when I got home from Boston, I was like, I need another week off work to recover.
11166480	11173480	I know, right, but I didn't call in to talk about the con. There's a couple of things I wanted to cover real quick, then get the heck up and out of here.
11173480	11174480	Go for it.
11174480	11181480	Now, your guest I was on earlier, I was listening on the way in, and he was talking about the conventions and how they close early.
11181480	11185480	If I was able to call in right into the day, I would have called in, because here's the thing.
11185480	11194480	Conventions go, if there are conventions in the hotel, they will go all night long. Video rooms will either go to 3, 4 o'clock in the morning or all night.
11194480	11205480	The reason why some cons shut down at 2, 2.30, because they're in a convention center, and union contract says at 2 or 2.30, the convention center closes down.
11205480	11207480	There's no ifs, ands, or buts about that.
11207480	11217480	That's usually a hotel versus convention center thing, right? Because even Dragon Con, like the quote-unquote convention center, which I guess is America Mart or whatever, you know, is kind of that.
11217480	11223480	And that does close at like probably, I don't know, 10 o'clock or something, but the hotels, you know, go all night long.
11223480	11232480	So I think, and if I'm not mistaken, MAGFest is at a hotel, Dragon Con's at hotels, you know, so if you have a convention that's at a hotel, it's more likely to go all day, all night.
11232480	11233480	Whereas...
11233480	11235480	That's why AX was a combination of the two.
11235480	11243480	And what probably he was thinking about, because I told him, you know, we were making some difficult decisions at VOG, you know, are we going to do PAX East next year, are we going to do MAGFest next year?
11243480	11250480	And right now, we're pretty much at this point all in for MAGFest 2016 and not doing PAX East.
11250480	11254480	And I think that's probably where he was kind of noting, you know, PAX, they have to shut down.
11254480	11263480	You know, to be fair, though, PAX is in a convention center, but, you know, looking at that comparison, I don't know, PAX does not go all day, all night.
11264480	11273480	True, true, true. But then again, I do remember that one time I went to Fauna May and I stayed up till like 3 o'clock in the morning just to go to a, just to see a video presentation I wanted to see, so, you know.
11273480	11281480	Well, who needs sleep at a convention, says the 20-year-olds, and then the 30-year-olds are like, me.
11281480	11286480	See, at that point, that's when I'm like, you know what, I'm calling it a night at 4 AM.
11286480	11292480	I'm only having like five people in the room because I need, I like to stretch out, you know, get my sleep on.
11292480	11296480	The days of packing 8, 9, 10 people to a room are long gone.
11296480	11306480	That's even my, yeah, that's my thing is like I can't do that anymore, like all those people in a hotel room, like I'm like two people in the room, that's about it.
11306480	11312480	Or I will say GamerX, it was me, Alan, and Jamie in the room, and that was plenty.
11312480	11317480	Three people, three's a crowd, okay? That was, it was a good crowd, but that was it.
11318480	11326480	And DarkSakura, by the way, since you did have to sleep with two gay men, did we push an agenda on you? I'm just curious, did we push our agenda on you?
11326480	11330480	Well, I'm not interested in cock or anything, so.
11331480	11345480	Nope. Rob, seriously, and I've said this to people, if I ever had a problem with the gay agenda, I would not be able to do half the stuff I do at conventions.
11345480	11350480	I'd probably be a hunted person. I would not be able to go to cons, do the part, a lot of stuff, you know?
11350480	11355480	Because I look at this, I've hung out with gay people, I hang out with lesbians, it doesn't matter to me.
11355480	11359480	They get part, it's just as hard as straight people. It doesn't matter to me.
11359480	11363480	Yeah, I just, I like people. I just like people. That's it.
11363480	11365480	If you're a dick, you're just a dick, you know?
11365480	11367480	Alright, you said you had one other quick thing?
11367480	11374480	Yeah, I believe Bobby talked about this last PAX, and we talked about it on OLR.
11374480	11380480	That multi-function game, Artemis, where you're doing the spaceship simulation.
11380480	11382480	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
11382480	11388480	I meant to say about this before, but Zekai Khan had a full room dedicated to Artemis running the whole weekend.
11388480	11390480	Oh, nice. Did you check that out? Did you play it?
11390480	11396480	I think it's just to play it, but I was gonna get some pictures, but let's just say it was a bit of a wait to get in there to play.
11396480	11402480	So I was like, I really couldn't wait around to get a chance to play, so you know.
11402480	11406480	Oh, I bet. Wow. Well, that sounds like fun. I gotta check that out.
11406480	11409480	It hasn't shown up at a con near me yet, but I'm hoping soon.
11409480	11411480	Well, I'll keep an eye out, you know.
11411480	11414480	Sounds good. Rama, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, alright?
11414480	11415480	No problem, bro.
11415480	11416480	Alright, take care my friend.
11416480	11417480	You too.
11417480	11418480	Alright, bye.
11418480	11421480	Well, that is about gonna do it for another episode of OLR.
11421480	11425480	Let me check in with Loki real quick for one other chance for last minute stories here.
11425480	11426480	No, that's it.
11426480	11427480	Alright, if you have a-
11427480	11431480	Those screenshots from Grand Theft Auto on the PC version look awesome.
11431480	11432480	Yeah, I know.
11432480	11433480	My PC can't run it.
11434480	11436480	Don't, you have to convince the guy to do one.
11436480	11441480	I'll just have to live it on, you know, just play it on one or four systems, I don't know.
11441480	11442480	There you go.
11442480	11448480	Alright, well, if you have something you want to say about tonight's show or any other show or something in general you want us to bring up,
11448480	11454480	like, you know, we had a topic in the mailbag tonight that wasn't on the agenda, just, you know, for whatever stories get slotted,
11454480	11459480	you can always email us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
11459480	11461480	I do try to read the tweets throughout the week.
11461480	11465480	I know I've been really bad about addressing those on the show, but I do read all the tweets.
11465480	11472480	So, you know, you can always get my attention at OLR on Twitter or my personal Twitter as well, at SKIE.
11472480	11476480	Anyhow, that is the end of another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
11476480	11478480	We're running pretty long tonight, but what a great show.
11478480	11485480	I want to thank once again our friends from the Sacramento IGDA for joining us in studio tonight, Gabriel and Brianna.
11485480	11488480	Be sure to check us out on April 11th when we're broadcasting live.
11488480	11498480	And check out Gabriel's company, Crumple, the demo, which is available right now on Desura and soon, trademark.
11498480	11502480	I mean, not like next month, soon, but soon in the future on the Wii U as well.
11502480	11503480	So check that out.
11503480	11512480	As I say at the end of every episode of Orange Lounge Radio, you know, we're not some mega, huge, multi-million dollar company or website.
11512480	11515480	We're just a bunch of people doing this for fun because we like to do this for y'all.
11515480	11517480	We like to hang out with each other and talk to each other.
11517480	11520480	We like to hang out with you guys who show up for it every Sunday night.
11520480	11524480	So, you know, if you liked what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, I'm not going to ask for your money.
11524480	11526480	I just ask, spread the word.
11526480	11531480	Tell a friend or two about the show and help spread the word here about where every gamer has a voice.
11531480	11535480	Because if we don't know your voices out there, we can't put them out there.
11535480	11540480	I mean, how long did it take for me to meet this guy five blocks from my house that was making games?
11540480	11549480	Anyway, but, you know, spread the word and we can show up and get more indie developers and more game enthusiasts and everybody here on the show.
11549480	11550480	So help spread the word.
11550480	11556480	And if for whatever reason you can't think, you know, you can't think of five people to tell or you can't even think of one person to tell off the top of your head,
11556480	11560480	it would be great to leave us a five-star review on iTunes or Stitcher Radio.
11560480	11565480	Those reviews go a long way and we really appreciate that type of visibility as well.
11565480	11568480	For now, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.
11568480	11570480	DarkSakura, I see you're packing up and getting ready to go.
11570480	11572480	DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?
11572480	11574480	I'm tired of my nose.
11574480	11575480	Feel better.
11575480	11577480	Loki, your final thought tonight?
11577480	11585480	I'm just tired, but, you know, I have another game concept that my wife really wants me to work on.
11585480	11589480	I'm not doing it yet until I finish what I'm working on now.
11589480	11591480	You'll never hear the end of it if you start another one.
11591480	11592480	Alright.
11592480	11593480	I'm not going to.
11593480	11594480	Fair enough.
11594480	11599480	My final thought for the day is I almost bought a 60-inch television today
11599480	11604480	and I was just about to walk out the door at Sears until they told me,
11604480	11609480	oh, gee, you know that TV that's on display, we actually don't have any in stock at any store nearby,
11609480	11612480	nor can we do delivery when you do it online.
11612480	11615480	And they wouldn't sell you the display bottle?
11615480	11621480	And that is how Amazon got my purchase on a television that would have gone to Sears otherwise today,
11621480	11623480	so just some food for thought.
11625480	11626480	Just saying.
11626480	11629480	Anyway, but there's a 60-inch TV in my future.
11629480	11630480	Yes.
11630480	11631480	Finally.
11631480	11635480	I've been using that other TV way too long, so excited about that.
11635480	11637480	Anyway, have a great night, everybody.
11637480	11641480	We'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio to do it all over again.
11641480	11644480	Thank you, everybody, for listening, whether it be live or on the podcast feed.
11644480	11646480	Thank you for sitting down at the table with us tonight.
