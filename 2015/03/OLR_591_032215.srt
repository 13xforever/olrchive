Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This week, Team DriveClub hits another bump in the road as the studio is hit with a number of layoffs. But don't worry, DriveClub for PlayStation Plus is still coming. The game will be seeing bigger changes and we'll tell you about them along with your comments, feedback, and more right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, DarkSakura, and Jamie

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Welcome back, we missed you last week.

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Thank you. I missed you too, but I was too far away to aim.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Well, hopefully your aim was improving through much practice. I heard on the flight back you were able to partake in your favorite pastime, Tumblr, from 10,000 feet in the air. Is that correct?

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes, it was great. And it posted fan fiction.

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Did you?

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
For the novelty of it.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The Mile High FanFic Club.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Somewhere over Kansas.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I want to give a shout out to this, certainly at some point. What better time than the top of the show. When you returned, you had some mail to catch up on, right? And what was one of the boxes that apparently had to go through customs to get to your house?

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Well, we got a package from IkumaJP, thank you, that included the Kunio-kun game that I had mentioned wanting. And lots and lots and lots and lots of Japanese snacks. Which, whatever these pear brittle things are.

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yeah, that pear chocolate brittle thing is so amazing.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I just want nothing but that for the rest of my life.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Right? Just dip me in a vat of it.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I did, though, leave the Melty Kiss at home, but I love Melty Kiss. It's one of my favorite Japanese candies.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's why you left it at home. No, I'm just kidding.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
No, I opened it and I put it aside.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Well, the Japanese care package from IkumaJP also contained, and I was really floored with this, a Wii Fit Trainer amiibo. Which I've bitched and complained about on the show before, how I kind of gave up on amiibo because the early amiibo was so hard to get.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And I kind of just wanted the Wii Fit Trainer. So when I complain about stuff like that, that doesn't mean you have to buy it for me. I was really, really surprised and touched by that.

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And yes, the Japanese amiibo work here, so I won't have a problem training that to level 50 and maybe using it in a tournament someday. Who knows?

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And for Loki, he got a Koopa, or Bowser as we call him.

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Tech master Loki.

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'll get lots of use out of that.

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
With all your copies.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
There's one more thing, there was a Strider postcard for Dan.

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Oh, that's awesome.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Which he really, really liked.

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That's awesome. Well, thank you IkumaJP for taking care of us. We love care packages from other countries. Like, you know, obviously we got our care package from Japan.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Sil has sent a care package from where she lives and not London before, and that's always great. So we love our care package. Somebody in Belgium offered to send us one, didn't they?

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I think we got to make that happen. I met a neglected to send our address.

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But anyway, Tech Master Loki here as he is every week. Yes, but I thought it was funny. I kind of saw the irony in you getting a Bowser amiibo because sometimes, sometimes your criticisms of Nintendo can be a little pointed.

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I thought it was hilarious.

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Pointed in the right direction. Yes, I understand that.

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I thought it was a little hilarious that you would get the villain of the series.

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I think that will be a nice decoration for your desk at work or something like that. That's great.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
How are you doing otherwise, Tech Master Loki?

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm good. I'm testing out my second level, which is extremely hard.

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I actually, now I realize this VoG Jam game is really, it's kind of transcended the jam at this point. It's just now the project that Loki said he would do that he'll finish when he's damn good and ready type of thing.

44
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But I will say, I've looked over your shoulder and this is the first time I've seen your game really in motion like that and it's impressive. I could not build something like that. I'm a little intimidated by what you've done, Loki.

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Which is probably totally against what we were trying to accomplish with that.

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I successfully finished the level despite the fact that the level moves around a lot.

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You can't even beat your own creation.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
No, I did. I just did. It took me four minutes, but I managed to do it.

49
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So your game will not be for the week of heart.

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Well, I've got to do some tweaks to it to make it a little bit easier.

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You need a Bobby Black Wolf mode, don't forget.

52
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Well, no. There will be some sort of mode like that where you can just play stuff. But no, it's supposed to be challenging.

53
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But I just don't know where this is going to fit in yet. It's not necessarily going to be level two, it's just the second level I'm making. So I have to figure out where I'm going to put it among everything.

54
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
All right. Go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Because we do tape our show live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network.

56
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
vognetwork.com, vognetwork.com.

57
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And we have some comments in our chat, some pep talks for Loki in the chat room.

58
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Tigerclaw saying, all these delays for Loki's vogjam game sounds ambitious. It better live up to the hype.

59
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Now you know what the rest of the gaming industry goes through. This is why things are so secretive in the industry.

60
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Because when you announce something years and years before it actually happens, everybody makes up this hype in their head.

61
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's why I'm worried for the last...

62
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I don't know why they're hyped up about anything.

63
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Like Duke Nukem Forever.

64
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I haven't been hyping up anything.

65
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
All right. This is why I worry for The Last Guardian. But anyway, that's a whole other episode.

66
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat saying, the second level I created for my game was hard for me too. I moved it to the last level.

67
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yeah, that's kind of where I'm at. I sat there for a while trying to figure out what level two would be.

68
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm like, you know, I have to knock stuff out and they'll figure that out later on.

69
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And that's really kind of the best way to go about it.

70
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Because otherwise they'd be still sitting here going, hmm, what am I going to do for the second level?

71
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
SSG100Matt in our chat room saying, Loki uses the Blizzard development model, which means it should be great.

72
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And the Blizzard development model, it's ready when it's done.

73
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
That's right. Soon.

74
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Well, I don't want to work on this forever, so it'll be ready a lot sooner than that, hopefully.

75
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Or the Square Enix Yoshi P Final Fantasy XIV trademark. Please look forward to it.

76
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Please look forward to it.

77
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
All right, anyway. Actually, they say that in all the Nintendo Directs too, don't they?

78
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
No, the Nintendo Direct ones are, please understand.

79
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Oh, please understand. That's right. Please understand. Yes.

80
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So, every company has their own little catchphrase asking for your forgiveness.

81
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Anyway, somebody who might need to be asking for forgiveness this week, getting into our kickoff topic this week.

82
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
No, all joking aside, a lot of people have a lot of feelings about this.

83
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And we're going to talk about a movie here at the top of the show for our kickoff topic this week.

84
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And, you know, movies are still important, even though this is a video gaming show.

85
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Sometimes it's important to see how our video games translate into movies.

86
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Obviously, we can talk about things like Mortal Kombat.

87
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You know, that was a pretty decent video game movie, right?

88
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Or Street Fighter, which was a pretty horrific video game movie,

89
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
but with some really cheesy, awesome moments, such as Raul Julia's entire performance. Rest in peace.

90
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And then you get things like Wreck-It Ralph, which was, like, really awesome.

91
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Tron, which was, you know, it's kind of video game.

92
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Actually, Flynn's Arcade is very video game related, right? Also, awesome.

93
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
So, I'm starting to think only Disney should touch video game movies.

94
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But this week, we got to see the first trailer for the movie Pixels,

95
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
which, if you haven't seen it, is out there online to watch.

96
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And this is a movie starring Adam Sandler, which you can interpret that however you like.

97
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And it seems, based on the trailer, the plot is that a time capsule from 1982 was sent into space,

98
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and there was some various pop culture things about the 80s.

99
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Well, yeah, it wasn't a time capsule. It's, like, an actual...

100
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
A space time capsule or something, right?

101
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Probe that they sent out with...

102
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Which they actually do things like that.

103
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Like, there are actually probes floating out in space, Lord knows where,

104
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
that has, like, a picture of where Earth is located, like, on a map, and, like, pictures of humans.

105
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Like, we're here. Like, if you find this, come here. We're here.

106
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
They actually have these types of things in space, so, I mean, it's not a completely implausible idea.

107
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But anyway, so, this time capsule has video game moments in it, like Donkey Kong and Pac-Man.

108
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So, apparently, the whole gist of the plot is, whatever alien race finds it, thinks we're threatening them with these creations.

109
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So, they send these pixelated creations to Earth to destroy us, because we've been very bad.

110
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And then the whole thing erupts into, like, a Michael Bay-looking movie.

111
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I don't know, like, half Michael Bay, half Adam Sandler comedy.

112
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm not really sure what to think.

113
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yeah, it was sensory overload a little bit for me.

114
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I gotta start with Dark Sakura, because I got to watch her watching the trailer here for the first time in studio,

115
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
and this was actually her reaction at the end of it.

116
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
She goes,

117
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
No.

118
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Click.

119
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That was it. That was the only word that left.

120
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
No. Click.

121
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Jamie, you want to elaborate on your feelings? You were not pleased with what you saw?

122
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
No.

123
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
My feelings are no.

124
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
All of the no.

125
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The only thing that was remotely cute about that was the Pac-Man biting the dude's hand.

126
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Was that really the creator of Pac-Man?

127
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I think so.

128
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It wouldn't surprise me if they kind of figured out how to get him involved with the movie or whatever.

129
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Give somebody enough money, they'll do anything. I'd be in the movie for the right price.

130
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's just fluff for the masses.

131
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yeah. Fluff for the masses.

132
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Wreck-It Ralph had a plot.

133
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
This movie will have a plot, Jamie.

134
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It will have a plot made out of cream cheese.

135
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Kind of squishy, and if you leave it out too long, it'll go bad.

136
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Okay, and they're saying in chat it is not really the creator.

137
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I've never seen what the guy looks like.

138
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I didn't bother looking it up, because it's the first time I've seen it.

139
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I mean, the premise is weak at best.

140
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's already been done, and no.

141
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Maybe I'm a little bitter and jaded right now, given that I haven't been in the best mood, but no.

142
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I don't know.

143
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I would watch a movie made out of candy that's sitting on that table before I would watch that movie.

144
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Here's my concern. My concern is obviously where I think many of your concerns are.

145
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
When I see Adam Sandler, and I see that guy from The King of Queens.

146
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Kevin James.

147
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Kevin James, which was a horrifically unfunny show. I'm sorry.

148
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Hey, at least David Spade isn't in the movie yet.

149
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
We think.

150
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Or Rob Schneider.

151
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,000
This is the problem. When I see those people, I expect a certain movie that I already know I'm probably not going to care for.

152
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I will admit, back when I was 22, Adam Sandler was really funny.

153
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
No, don't get me wrong. Adam Sandler in his prime was pretty funny.

154
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I mean, the movies were stupid, but you kind of knew what you were getting.

155
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And everything up to, I think, maybe borderline Little Nicky was good.

156
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
He started going family.

157
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:50,000
When he branched out into the family movies with Big Daddy and stuff, it just started going downhill from there.

158
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The only movie I've seen him in that I liked was The Wedding Singer.

159
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The Wedding Singer will always be the pinnacle, the climax of his career, I think, for many of us.

160
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But I even like stuff like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore.

161
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I haven't seen Happy Gilmore, though. I haven't seen that one.

162
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Oh, that's fantastic.

163
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That one's great, because that's where he gets in the fight with Bob Barker.

164
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
The price is wrong, bitch. That is legendary cinema right there.

165
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
As far as sophomore humor goes, that's it for me.

166
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But I used to have my little chat sound that I would play that was all bullshit with him singing it very loudly.

167
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That was my thing.

168
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Oh, interesting. SSJ100Matt says, Rob Schneider is being avoided these days because of his anti-vax comments.

169
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Is that true? I had no idea that was the thing. I thought that all...

170
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
No, he's not being voiced.

171
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I don't want to get into that controversy, but I will say I always thought that was all pegged on Jenny McCarthy.

172
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I always thought that she was the...

173
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
No, he's been in all the different grown-ups movies and stuff that they've been doing.

174
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Those have been popular, but those are also really stupid movies.

175
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I haven't watched them, so to be fair, I can't really judge them, but they look dumb.

176
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It doesn't look as funny as, say, the older stuff.

177
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
That's kind of what I compare it to. Is this going to be as funny or funnier than Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore?

178
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I will say this much, and it kind of goes back to even, even Dark Soccer's succinct little summary of her feelings,

179
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
is that, hey, video games... I haven't even said my thought yet, and you're already laughing at me.

180
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
No, Claire Valera showed up in the chatroom and said, I think Rob Schneider is being avoided because he's Rob Schneider.

181
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That could be right. That could be right. But anyway, love it or hate it or whatever,

182
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,000
at least you have to kind of recognize, okay, video games are embedded in our pop culture.

183
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:51,000
When people our age, and even folks in their 20s and teens, 30s, you look back on what were the 80s all about,

184
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
you think about Pac-Man and Donkey Kong and these types of video games.

185
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's really only a matter of time that video games are not a niche thing. They're really for everybody.

186
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Everybody knows who Pac-Man is. Everybody knows who Donkey Kong is.

187
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But here's my problem, and I only have a problem with them being in this movie and that stuff.

188
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's just, you're showing me a trailer, which is kind of like highlighting, I would say probably some good parts of the movie,

189
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
and you have dialogue like, Pac-Man's a bad guy? I mean, that's just fucking terrible.

190
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That is just terrible writing, and that's what kind of bothers me, is that kind of nonsense.

191
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I think it'll be okay. I think it'll be an okay movie. I don't think it's going to be fantastic,

192
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
but it's kind of along the lines of Grandma's Boy. Grandma's Boy is a little bit about game development.

193
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That's right. I totally forgot about that movie.

194
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's Pixel Shit, the movie.

195
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Do you think Aaron should be suing them?

196
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yes, he should sue them.

197
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I should sue them for having thought of shitty pixels first.

198
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I like Peter Dinklage as some crazy guy that's in there.

199
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
He's supposed to be the Billy Mitchell type guy.

200
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I think that's fantastic.

201
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
If he's selling sauce, that would be great.

202
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
He could actually be really funny in that type of role.

203
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
There are little moments where I'm like, I guess I could sit through it.

204
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And it's something that they like the subject.

205
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's not like they're just like, okay, we're doing it for a paycheck.

206
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I mean, they probably are, but it's not like someone paid them to make this movie.

207
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yeah, like Adam Sandler probably has played a few video games in his case.

208
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Yeah, so I think that they'll do the best they can, but it's just like,

209
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
what kind of expectations do you have for an Adam Sandler movie?

210
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I mean, really, the bar is not that high.

211
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It shouldn't be too hard to go into that and not be let down,

212
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
because it's Adam Sandler.

213
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's not going to be a brilliant movie.

214
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's just going to be kind of like, ha ha ha, that's silly.

215
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Very interesting counterthought from our chat room here,

216
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
and I want to state this and then we'll wrap up and move on to our gaming weeks.

217
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
But Kaijuto in chat talking about the movie saying,

218
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
the movie is a big spoof on gamers.

219
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's not going to push games into the mainstream.

220
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's just going to make gamers look more losers,

221
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
so make gamers look more like losers.

222
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Do you think that that could be a danger,

223
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
that it actually is making fun of games the entire time

224
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and that gamers are all fat and lazy and getting high?

225
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I think they did that already in Grandma's Boy.

226
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I think they've already gone that route in Grandma's Boy,

227
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
but this one I think is more of like maybe making fun of people

228
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
that are like 40 years old that are trying to be professional arcade game players.

229
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
What are you trying to say?

230
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm saying that they're making fun of Billy Mitchell, and I think that's hilarious.

231
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
What are you trying to say? Because I'm going to be 40.

232
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You're not a professional video game player, okay?

233
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Not that I have a podcast.

234
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
No, you have a podcast. You're not trying to...

235
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I don't see an arcade cabinet being used in your living room.

236
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I have arcade machines in my house that are actually being used.

237
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I came so close to getting that burger.

238
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
In which world records are you trying to break?

239
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
The ones in my house.

240
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
So that's what I'm saying. That's I think what's making fun of, but we'll see.

241
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I mean, it's just a silly movie with a silly premise.

242
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
They took a short animation and they tried to throw a story to it.

243
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
All right, whatever.

244
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
YYR has just joined chat and said,

245
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Please cease and desist use of my trademark pixel shits.

246
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
This has been Konami's legal department. Thank you very much.

247
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Love it.

248
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Also, one more thought from the other side,

249
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
because I kind of gave a really anti-comment there from Kajudo.

250
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I know Tiger Claw has a more favorable opinion.

251
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I want to read his thought here in chat.

252
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Tiger Claw says,

253
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Keep in mind that Pixels is directed by Chris Columbus.

254
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
He's a big-time director who's directed some of the best movies in the past couple years.

255
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Home Alone, Harry Potter 1 and 2, Mrs. Doubtfire.

256
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Okay, I do love me some Mrs. Doubtfire, but that was Robin Williams' credit.

257
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But okay, Chris Columbus is an A-list director for sure.

258
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
That's a fair counterpoint.

259
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Gremlins.

260
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Gremlins is the best Christmas movie ever.

261
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And if you say Die Hard, you're wrong.

262
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Die Hard.

263
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Actually, Gremlins 2 is better.

264
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Because Gremlins 2 had Tony, what was his face?

265
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
That was the smart Gremlin?

266
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I think the best Christmas movie ever is Eyes Wide Shut.

267
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
But that's, anyway, that's just for the last line in the entire movie.

268
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Just makes the whole three hours worth it.

269
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Anyway, low-key.

270
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Tangent, choo-choo.

271
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Last thought on Pixels, then we'll move on.

272
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'd go see it.

273
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I mean, I don't know.

274
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It looks entertaining.

275
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And that's really it.

276
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I mean, it's a popcorn movie.

277
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm not expecting a cinematic masterpiece or anything like that.

278
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
There will be other movies for that.

279
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
This is what this is.

280
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I don't understand why people are getting mad about it.

281
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So what?

282
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's an Adam Sandler movie that's saying that gamers are stupid or living in the basements

283
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
and stuff like that.

284
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Who gives a shit what Adam Sandler thinks?

285
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Does anybody really take credit to what Adam Sandler thinks?

286
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Do you see newscasts going, wow, Adam Sandler thinks that gamers are really lazy.

287
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I think they're all lazy.

288
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
No one gives a fuck.

289
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Nobody cares what Adam Sandler thinks.

290
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
But you know what?

291
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
He's entertaining.

292
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's just Adam Sandler sitting there with that whole split screen.

293
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's Adam Sandler and Nancy Grace.

294
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
These are our opinions.

295
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's just a movie.

296
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Just go to be entertained.

297
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
If you don't want to see it, then don't go see it.

298
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
That's all it is.

299
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's not trying to send a message.

300
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's just fun.

301
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
That's it.

302
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Right.

303
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Loki, I will go see a matinee with you.

304
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
How does that sound?

305
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
We'll go see a matinee.

306
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
A matinee is definitely what that deserves.

307
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Because I don't think it deserves a full ticket price.

308
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Dark Sakura, could we somehow hit you over the head with a baseball bat,

309
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
push the trunk of the car and make you go?

310
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
If you feed me after, maybe.

311
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Okay.

312
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
For food, I would do it.

313
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'd do it for a burrito.

314
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Alright.

315
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And I would never hit Dark Sakura with a baseball bat

316
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
unless it was plastic and orange.

317
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
That may have happened one time at a DDR tournament.

318
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
One time, people.

319
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
That was great.

320
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I still have the bat.

321
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yes.

322
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I'm not sure, though, if I appreciate the fact that they're driving

323
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
a lot of Mini Coopers in the movie, but you know, whatever.

324
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
SSG100Matt says it's a vlog movie date.

325
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
We haven't done a good OLR or vlog movie date in a long time,

326
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
but I think the last thing we all went and saw was Avatar

327
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
was our last movie date.

328
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So we need to have another vlog movie date.

329
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Really?

330
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I think so.

331
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I thought we saw Tron.

332
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Did we all go see that as a group?

333
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Maybe not.

334
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
No.

335
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
We just all saw it multiple times.

336
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I would see it in D-Box.

337
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You know, that actually should be a regular thing that we do,

338
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
the OLR movie review.

339
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Yeah?

340
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Why not?

341
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Do one like once a month.

342
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Yeah.

343
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Or I don't know, see if we can invade.

344
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Like maybe John from Critical Myth would let us crash a show

345
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
or something like, hey, what's up?

346
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
We're here.

347
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
We're going to talk about a movie because you got the movie show.

348
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Yeah, we should do like a 15-minute podcast called

349
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The OLR Movie Review.

350
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Here's the thing that's really annoying.

351
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Followed by food.

352
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Sure, sign me up for another podcast.

353
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
What the hell?

354
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Here's the thing that's really annoying, though,

355
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
about that movie is they have this little hidden thing

356
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
in the trailer.

357
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I don't know if you saw, towards the very end,

358
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
it's a little flash for like some stupid game that they made

359
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
or whatever.

360
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Oh, Lord.

361
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's like a fictional arcade chick.

362
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Of course.

363
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
The game tie-in.

364
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
How could I forget the inevitable game tie-in?

365
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
So they have that going.

366
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's a mobile game or something that you can play.

367
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Of course.

368
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Of course.

369
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I just want it to be Cortana going, you guys are stupid.

370
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
All right, on that note, let's talk about our gaming weeks

371
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

372
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
We always like to start off towards the beginning of the show

373
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
talking about that because it gives you a good frame of reference

374
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
where we're coming from as gamers.

375
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week or two weeks?

376
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It wasn't.

377
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I maybe played a couple of, actually, no,

378
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I couldn't log into my Steam account in Alabama for some reason.

379
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You told me about a new one on 3DS.

380
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
My Steam account?

381
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
No, no, your 3DS.

382
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Oh, sorry.

383
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I had a very fun dinner with our friend, Jay,

384
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
who lives in Pensacola.

385
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
He came all the way out there to see me,

386
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
and he got me a copy of Theater of Them.

387
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Oh, awesome.

388
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So I started it, but I really didn't have a whole lot of time to play.

389
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
My intention was to play it on the plane,

390
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
but the guy next to me was just being a butt,

391
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
so instead I played on Tumblr.

392
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You can't play Theater of Them on the plane anyway, I've tried.

393
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It's too loud.

394
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Well, I have my headphones.

395
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Even with headphones, it's really hard to hear.

396
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:39,000
So I really didn't play too much of anything

397
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
except just whatever was on my phone.

398
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I played some Peggle on the flight.

399
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I played some Bejeweled, because those are my two.

400
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I need something really quick and easy to play games.

401
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Most of the time, I actually did write work on my fan fiction a little bit,

402
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
so there was a touch of Dragon Age to it,

403
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
but honestly, I don't think I was in much of a mindset

404
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
to play much of anything and enjoy it.

405
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Sure, fair enough.

406
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
So yeah, I really was more focused on my family.

407
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Actually, I went to my friend Derek's house,

408
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
and his daughter Branwyn was playing Dragon Age Inquisition,

409
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
so I sort of gave her a few hints here and there.

410
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
She's like, what did I do here? I'm like, do this.

411
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Oops, that was the wrong one.

412
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Resume your save, do the other things,

413
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
and then we pretty much gushed about Cullen's butt the whole time.

414
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Oh my gosh. How old is she?

415
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Sixteen.

416
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Okay. That's old enough to be talking about butts.

417
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
That's old enough to be talking about butts.

418
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
She's actually got a cool dad.

419
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
She's smart as a whip.

420
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Into Homestuck, so she's one of my people.

421
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Homestuck and Cullen's butt.

422
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
And I'm getting her started on Mass Effect.

423
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Oh lord, help us all.

424
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Now's the time to get started just before that announcement of,

425
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm sure that's coming at E3 this year, whatever the fourth game's going to be.

426
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Oh yes.

427
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
If that doesn't happen at E3, I'm going to be so mad. So mad.

428
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I've also told her what my biggest problem is with Mass Effect,

429
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
that every time I start trying to romance somebody else, nope, Garrus.

430
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
So.

431
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Alright, we'll see if she ends up Team Garrus or Team Thane,

432
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
or maybe people like me, Team Caden, so we'll see.

433
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Or she could go for trainer.

434
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Who knows?

435
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Or watch Kelly be incredibly slutty.

436
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Which is Kelly's right to be slutty if she wishes.

437
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
That's right, options, options people.

438
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Options, alright.

439
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Loki, what were your options for the game you played this week?

440
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I just played Final Fantasy this week, so both Final Fantasy Type 0 HD,

441
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
and the Final Fantasy 11, or 11, 15 demo.

442
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
So Type 0 HD, I played that a little bit last night.

443
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Definitely a very violent game.

444
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,000
The thing I had a little trouble with is they just kind of dump a ton of history on you,

445
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
like all in the beginning scene.

446
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I'm like, I have no fucking clue what's going on.

447
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Somebody that war with somebody else, I don't know who these people are,

448
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
who's dying, who's good, who's bad, whatever.

449
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
It's hard to follow.

450
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And then the actual combat says okay.

451
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
It definitely feels like a PSP game since it was at one time,

452
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
and the way they have everything kind of broken down.

453
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I don't know, it's kind of neat.

454
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Also sort of like an anime vibe to it with this class.

455
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
They have a neat dynamic to them.

456
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
So I don't know, I'll try to maybe be playing through the whole thing.

457
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
See how my patience is with that.

458
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And then, let's see, Final Fantasy 15.

459
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
That demo's pretty awesome.

460
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I was just trying to grind a little bit in there,

461
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
and I ended up going through, and I did through the first Behemoth encounter.

462
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And then, I don't know.

463
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
For me it was just like, ooh, things, I'm going to go kill them.

464
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
And then I would go kill them and keep doing that.

465
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I don't know, I still couldn't quite get the whole weapon system that they have,

466
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
with picking which weapon you want to wear.

467
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I ended up, I think, settling on having the polearm as my main weapon,

468
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
which actually, that seems to work out.

469
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
It's kind of a good balance between speed and damage.

470
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
So I stuck with that.

471
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,000
But it's a little kind of confusing on how to balance your weapons and everything in there.

472
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
So I tried to experiment that a little bit.

473
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Can I read a quick comment from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com?

474
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Bobby Blackwolf says,

475
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I find it funny that the opening credits scene in Type-0 is blocked for streaming and recording.

476
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
My assumption was because it was the song that was playing over it.

477
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I think it was only the song that they did that.

478
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Yeah, it's just the length of the song while it was blocked,

479
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
so there must be some weird rights thing with it.

480
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I wish it wouldn't show that unless I'm fucking recording, because it's kind of annoying.

481
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Yeah, I agree.

482
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Because I saw that, and I'm like, am I recording?

483
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Low-hit the button by mistake?

484
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Here's the thing. Maybe actually it doesn't show up,

485
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
because you always are recording the last 15 minutes of gameplay.

486
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
So maybe if you turn that off, which most people don't bother to do,

487
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
because, oh, okay, cool, it's saving gameplay.

488
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So I bet if you turn that off, I bet you would not see that message anymore.

489
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I haven't tried it.

490
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I don't know, whatever.

491
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Crazy talk.

492
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
It wasn't a big deal.

493
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I was just kind of, huh, I've never seen this before, but all right.

494
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
But anyways, back to 15.

495
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I don't know, it's okay.

496
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
It's just such a small portion of the game, and it's not finished yet.

497
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I do think that the graphics don't seem to be that impressive to me.

498
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Really?

499
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
It looks very PlayStation 3 to me.

500
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
I don't know.

501
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
What?

502
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
You need to get your TV fixed, because I totally disagree with you there.

503
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I think a lot of people will, Loki.

504
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
No, I was not getting a PlayStation 3 vibe from it.

505
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I will say the frame rate, maybe.

506
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Because there were definitely noticeable parts where the frame rate started dipping a little bit,

507
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,000
and I was like, okay, again, it's early, not done, I'm not going to hold that against the game.

508
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
But I was like, okay, this game still needs work.

509
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Maybe I'd have to go back and play a PlayStation 3 game or something.

510
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I don't know.

511
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
But I don't know.

512
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
It was okay.

513
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I'm definitely going to buy it when it comes out.

514
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I still will play through the demo, because I want to go kill all of the things.

515
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I did think it was annoying, though.

516
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Like I was mentioning, I had an issue where I was fighting a big group of monsters.

517
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Oh, a couple times, actually, I was fighting a big group of monsters.

518
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
There was one time it was before the first camp, and so I was fighting monsters, and it got dark.

519
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And these monsters kept coming, and I just kept fighting them and fighting them and fighting them.

520
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And the stupid soldiers in the ships that kept dropping down, I'd kill them,

521
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
and then I'd go back to fighting some more monsters, and then they'd fucking respawn again and drop down again,

522
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
and I'd kill them and go back to fighting some more monsters again.

523
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
And then they'd keep coming and coming.

524
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
It's like, shit, what the hell? This is kind of annoying.

525
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I thought this was supposed to be a little bit random, but it just kept respawning in the same spot rather quickly.

526
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
So that was the only annoying thing that I saw with the combat.

527
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I just ended up having to run away and just go into my actual campsite.

528
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I don't know.

529
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
But yeah, that's pretty much it.

530
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
That was my week, Final Fantasy.

531
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:42,000
My week, very similar to yours, although I played a lot of my standbys, like Final Fantasy XIV and Diablo III.

532
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
We're going to get to it later in the show, but they made a big announcement with Diablo III this week,

533
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
so it motivated me, like, oh crap, I've got to finish the hardcore character I've been working on for the season.

534
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
So I've been trying to finish some of that.

535
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
But like Loki, I had a Final Fantasy week mostly, played a little bit of Type-0,

536
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
and I definitely agree the story is kind of hard to follow in the beginning,

537
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
but I also chalk that up to a lot of Final Fantasy games are hard to follow in the beginning.

538
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I mean, like, even XIII. Like, I go back and play XIII now, it makes total sense.

539
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,000
But at the time, I'm like, oh my god, this game is so, like, all the, like, the LaCie and the Falcie and Cocoon and Grand Pulse,

540
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
and is, like, so much going on, right? So...

541
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I did find it funny, though, was it in Final Fantasy XV's demo, the voice actors in it.

542
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I'm like, isn't that fucking Titus in fucking, what's his name, you know, Oran or whatever?

543
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Like, oh shit, it's all, it's just the whole crew's back again.

544
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
It's all back, yeah, they tend to use the same group.

545
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
And that guy is like, dude, you do not look like a guy that would have a British accent,

546
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
but okay, that's where they went with that.

547
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Yeah. So, okay, so first Type-0, I admittedly did not get very far in Type-0,

548
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I only really played through the first mission and a half or something like that,

549
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
but I definitely noticed the violence thing.

550
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I was like, wow, this game really is, like, super violent compared to the other Final Fantasy games,

551
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
and I was a bit taken aback by that.

552
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
But I understand, it's a side story, it's a different thing, so I'm like, okay, it's cool.

553
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Even if I didn't totally understand the story, I was interested enough to not want to skip the cutscenes,

554
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
and it was, you know, the characters are always very interesting to me, so I was watching that.

555
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:24,000
The gameplay, it really is hard for me to get used to, and what's really bugging me is the whole, like,

556
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
okay, so when I kill a mob, I have to, like, instantly flick the controller, hit the button,

557
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:36,000
and then hit the other button to draw the treasure out from the mob, or the, whatever it's called.

558
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Yeah, like the MP, and then there's also, you get some type of, like, they come in the different colors,

559
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
and I forget the name, somebody in chow probably yelled out, sorry guys,

560
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I did not spend enough time with it this week, I really shouldn't even be talking about it, but I have a big mouth.

561
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I just thought that was really hard to control, and sometimes you can't really lock on things the right way,

562
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,000
and then when you turn, my god, it's, like, so fast, so you can really tell in those ways,

563
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,000
like, this was definitely a game made for handhelds that I'm now playing on the TV, so it does give me pause now.

564
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I know I talk about games like Bravely Default, and I've said, like,

565
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
why can't they just make a version of Bravely Default that I can play on the TV?

566
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I mean, is there, they don't really use 3D in Bravely Default, I would like to just sit my big butt on the couch and play Bravely Default.

567
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Well, Type-0 shows that maybe not every mobile, or mobile on-the-go portable game needs to necessarily be on the TV without some tweaking.

568
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,000
But it's not, like, so bad it's unplayable or anything like that, it's just, I definitely noticed it.

569
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
So, the controls were a little bit wonky, it's taken me some getting used to,

570
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
but I'm interested enough in the game itself and the story to keep going with it.

571
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
But, like many of you, and like Loki, I took a side trip to go check out the Final Fantasy XV demo.

572
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I, unlike Loki, and again, I think Loki is totally off on that comment, I think the game is gorgeous,

573
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
and that's one of the strongest things it has going for it, is just, it looks amazing,

574
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:08,000
and the fact that, you know, it transitions from battle to world map and all this seamlessly is really, really cool.

575
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Certainly, XV addresses the problem that most people had with XIII, not counting XIV,

576
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
because the MMOs are kind of their own different thing, right?

577
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:25,000
In the fact that XV, the first thing you notice is, wow, this is open world, this is an open world Final Fantasy game,

578
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:32,000
this is like, like, this is like being in the Hinterlands in Dragon Age Inquisition, but it's a fucking Final Fantasy game.

579
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Like, that's what I kind of noticed, like, right off the bat.

580
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,000
So I thought that was neat, kind of a different direction for the series, especially since I do play the Final Fantasy MMOs,

581
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
which do feel like that, just because MMOs in nature kind of tend to do that in our open world.

582
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
So I kind of like that.

583
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
And I was interested enough with the story and where it was going, you know, in the demo,

584
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
you're trying to track down this behemoth because you want to get the reward so you can get, you know,

585
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
pay Sydney to get your car fixed, basically, is the whole gist of the demo.

586
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:04,000
And you find all these side things while you're going through the world.

587
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:12,000
But the thing that really bothered me about the demo, like, really bothered me about the demo is the controls.

588
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Again, like, I was never locking on the thing I wanted to be locking on.

589
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,000
The camera always ended up in this real awkward place where, like, the mob I'm fighting is behind a big bush,

590
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
and so all I see is just giant bush filling up my television screen.

591
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It's like a 70s porno.

592
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Pretty much.

593
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
So it's like, yeah, it is hard to, like, see what I'm doing and so forth.

594
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
So, and that's very jarring to not have that turn-based system anymore.

595
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Like, and even when they went away from that and things like Final Fantasy XIII, it still felt very Final Fantasy.

596
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
So, like, this is a huge departure from that.

597
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And that was a little weird for me to get used to it.

598
00:34:53,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm okay with it, but the camera, the controls, and the frame rate all need a little tweaking.

599
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
This is a demo, however, and I think we all need to keep that in mind.

600
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Very important. I'm not going to base my final decision of the game off this demo,

601
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
but it certainly shows me it needs a little more time before it's finished.

602
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And whereas I was thinking for a while, like, oh, I can't wait to play Final Fantasy XV this holiday.

603
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
This is going to be the big holiday. Yeah, I'm going to play nothing but Final Fantasy XV over Christmas.

604
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Now I'm thinking maybe they ought to wait until next year.

605
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Maybe it needs to be in the oven a little longer and we'll see it next year,

606
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
and I'm totally okay with that after playing this demo.

607
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Like, if they can go back and tweak some of these things and get it a little tighter based off some of this feedback,

608
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I'm sure they're going to hear from other places in the demo.

609
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I'm okay with it taking a little longer.

610
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
So, that's it, though. That was my gaming week, so very similar to what Loki did.

611
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
All right. Let's see. Go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

612
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Dungeon Buster says, I kept getting hit by enemies off camera. So annoying.

613
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
There's no way to scale the camera back that I could find either.

614
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Act Def says, Final Fantasy XV is like a 70s porno, so we finally got Final Fantasy XXX.

615
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Maybe. Maybe a little bit. I don't know. All right.

616
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Anyhow, housekeeping real quick. Of course, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R.

617
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
We're also on Facebook and Google Plus as Orange Lounge Radio.

618
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,000
As we announced last week on the show, and I'll be announcing every week until it gets here, which is only in a few weeks,

619
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:35,000
we will be broadcasting live on April 11th from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Pacific time from the Sacramento IGDA event,

620
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:44,000
the Sacramento arcade event that is happening at Cafe Colonial and The Colony, which is down off Stockton.

621
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
It's the 35th. I cannot remember my directions very well, but if you live here in SAC, you know where The Colonial is.

622
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Google it, people. Google it. We're going to be broadcasting there all day and hoping to bring you some of the speakers that will be there.

623
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:04,000
They've got some great speakers and doing some coverage of some indie games you probably have not heard about yet, but you will soon.

624
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
So we definitely want to spotlight these hardworking, deserving folks.

625
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Also, next week here on O-L-R, we're actually going to have Gabriel Ambriano from that group.

626
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
We're going to be here next week live on the show to talk about that event, talk about what we can look forward to.

627
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And I also know Gabriel's company just pushed a demo onto Desura today, and this is a game he's going to be putting on Wii U eventually as well.

628
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
It's a game called Crumple. So we're going to talk more about that next week when he's here.

629
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
So that's very exciting for him.

630
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Cool. All right. I think the time has come for us to get into some news for the week. So, Loki?

631
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Actually, may I say one thing that I had intended to before?

632
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Sure, of course.

633
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I wanted to thank everyone for their well wishes about my grandmother.

634
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:57,000
She would have been like, who are all these people? But she would have appreciated it too.

635
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
So I'd like to thank everyone and thanks for putting up with me.

636
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I wasn't going to ask, but I also noticed a lot of that out there.

637
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:16,000
And even though it certainly doesn't impact me the same way it impacts you, I was just really happy and warm to see that outpouring for you.

638
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And I was like, she deserves it. So I was very happy to see that.

639
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Well, my grandma practically raised me, so it's like losing closer than a grandmother, pretty much.

640
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Sure.

641
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I have one grandmother left, my granny, and she's stubborn.

642
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
But it was a pretty crazy ride the last week and a half.

643
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Sure.

644
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,000
But thanks to everybody.

645
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,000
We're all here for you, DarkSakura. You know that. It's one big family here at OLR.

646
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Still not be in my house at the same time.

647
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
What's that?

648
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Still not be in my house at the same time.

649
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
But we used to be all at your house on Sunday nights for the show.

650
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I know.

651
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Mystique was here last week. You missed it. And I was like, I don't think you've crashed the show since we did it at Jamie's.

652
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And also, Midna thanks you for cleaning up after.

653
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Well, she's welcome. Yeah.

654
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Yeah.

655
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
All right. Anyhow. Okay. Thank you for sharing. Let's get into some gaming news. Loki.

656
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Yeah. So there is some big announcements regarding Nintendo and it's kind of like everybody's been bugging them about, hey, when are you going to do mobile games?

657
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Hey, when are you going to do mobile games? Well, finally they're going to do mobile games.

658
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:33,000
So they have a collaboration with DNA and basically it's going to put up mobile games.

659
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:41,000
They're going to actually create the products themselves whereas DNA is going to take care of the service side apparently.

660
00:39:41,000 --> 00:40:07,000
And Satoru Iwata said, you know, we have come to the stage where we can say that we will be able to develop and operate software which in the end will not hurt the value of the Nintendo IP but rather will become an opportunity for a great number of people around the world who own smart devices but do not have interest in dedicated video game hardware to be interested in Nintendo IP and eventually become fans of our dedicated game systems.

661
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Along with that announcement that they're going to, you know, have these mobile games, they announced that there's going to be, well, I should say teased that there's going to be a new system or game system that they're going to be creating that ties into this somehow.

662
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:35,000
They haven't really said anything about it other than, you know, it's called the, well, they're calling it right now the NX and basically it's going to be something that they'll be talking about next year.

663
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:46,000
But, I don't know. I'm not sure what it is. A lot of people are definitely, is it a tablet? Is it a new game system? Is it like a phone?

664
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Is it all of them? Is it all those things? I think it's a new handheld system but, you know, whatever. We'll see.

665
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:07,000
So there's a lot to digest with this story I think. So first off, Nintendo is getting into mobile which I have to admit I'm surprised a little bit. I thought they would stick with that stubbornness for a little while.

666
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I suspected the 3DS was doing pretty well. Every time a new Pokemon game comes out, people lose their shit. So it seems very weird that by going into mobile, they would almost take away from the DS a little bit.

667
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:31,000
And I understand, before y'all jump down my throat, I understand that there's different experiences, you know, there's certain types of games that will work well on mobile and certain types of things that will work well on 3DS.

668
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:40,000
You will not have something with the depth of Mario 3D Land which is an amazing game. You can't get that on a mobile device. It's just not gonna happen.

669
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:49,000
But something like Pokemon Shuffle I guess you could and I'm sure is the example many people think of as, oh, this is probably what a Nintendo mobile game is gonna look like.

670
00:41:49,000 --> 00:42:00,000
So it's just interesting to me that they finally bowed to that. And I realize investor pressure has a lot to do with these types of things, especially when you're not making your projections.

671
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:08,000
And even though I don't think the Wii U is losing money anymore, Nintendo has failed to meet those investor projections several times now.

672
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And they're on an upswing and I think that's worth this amiibo things, putting them on an upswing, but they probably have a lot of investor pressure to upswing it more to make up for some of these past few years.

673
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:26,000
And basically, why? Why not get into mobile? And maybe finally that just became a question that was too much to bear. Why not get into mobile?

674
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:38,000
You know, Microsoft and Sony have even kind of done it in their own ways. Granted, the Sony mobile platform, I believe we just talked about last week, didn't turn out so well.

675
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:48,000
But we have like a little big Planet Endless Runner game. Granted, I guess Media Molecule, that might complicate the relationship a little bit when it's not really Sony, but anyway.

676
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:56,000
But Microsoft has, it's kind of a whole other issue when you consider that Windows is a phone and it's a little bit apples to oranges.

677
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Regardless, it's interesting to see that Nintendo is now having to bow to coming to mobile phones.

678
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I just, there's some things I think would work very well on my iPhone or if I were an Android user on that device or tablet or what have you.

679
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I think of things like Advance Wars. I think that's a Nintendo IP a lot of people may have forgot about, but I think that would work very well on a tablet.

680
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I would think that would be the first thing to make. I think kind of like you see a lot of Disney characters in their own versions of popular games on the marketplace.

681
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I don't want to say like Disney Temple Run, but I believe they did a Temple Run game with the characters from Brave, did they not? I think that was one of the things.

682
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:51,000
So perhaps you will see something like that with Mario, not saying exactly Temple Run, but existing types of ideas that you have.

683
00:43:51,000 --> 00:44:00,000
But with Mario, Luigi, because that is Nintendo's real bread and butter and something that they can really give the world beyond gaming is strong characters.

684
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I mean, I use the Disney comparison because Disney does this extremely well. They create strong characters.

685
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I mean, think about how old of a character Snow White, Princess Aurora, and these characters are.

686
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Aurora.

687
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Aurora. You can never say that word.

688
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Aurora.

689
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Aurora.

690
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Think about how old some of these characters are and they are still selling on clothes and cups and dolls and things like that today.

691
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
You know what I mean? Very strong characters. Just like Mario, it's going to be around forever. You know?

692
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I just find it interesting that the whole reason they announced that NX thing is because they want people to be aware that they're still not going to give up on the console side of things.

693
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:49,000
But you would think that they would just say, but we're going to keep up with the 3DS and Wii U, not, hey, we're going to have another console coming out.

694
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:55,000
It's like, well, did you just release a console already?

695
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:05,000
All the big blogs, all the profit sites, all the gaming journalism for profit sites just saw big in their eye when Nintendo said that because now they can run that headline.

696
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Nintendo announces they're working on their new console, the NX. Here's the thing. No shit. That is not news.

697
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Guess what? Sony working on the PlayStation 5 right now or whatever the successor is to the PlayStation 4. Guarantee it.

698
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Microsoft working on Xbox's successor. Guarantee it. Why? Listen to them talk about the systems that are out now.

699
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Development for these systems start right after the old systems get released.

700
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,000
It's not like they let these hardware teams go for, you know, years and years and then bring them back the year before.

701
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:48,000
These things take an insane amount of planning and they go through many changes and I'm sure there's so many things they think they might want to implement.

702
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Yeah, but why announce it now? I mean, it's way too early to be announcing that, especially when they're like, yay, we've got something coming and you'll hear about it next year.

703
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:07,000
I think it was more of a reassurance to investors and I think you kind of said it. It was to reassure everybody we're going to enter the mobile space, but we're not moving to mobile.

704
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:16,000
We're still developing these other experiences and you're going to hear about one next year, which is, you know, any of us that kind of watch the industry.

705
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
That's kind of what I think we expected.

706
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I'm just going to be curious to see if these are any experiences I actually want to experience because it's like, you know, no offense, but mobile games a lot of times have come with the connotation of like, you know, it's kind of a cheap cash in, you know.

707
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:43,000
So I kind of want to see something that's a little bit more than just a cheap cash in, see how they're actually utilizing because, you know, once again, they take things Nintendo's pace, I guess, and they're a little behind in everything.

708
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:49,000
And so I'm kind of wondering what stuff will see them kind of repeat the mistakes of other companies.

709
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Going to some comments over in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, SSG100Matt says it was a reassurance to the investors, not for the gamers per se.

710
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I mean, it is a true point. They said it in an investor meeting, not at E3. So that message was for investors and just everybody else ran with it.

711
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Tigerclaw says, I just hope Nintendo doesn't jump on the bandwagon that is those tower defense games. There's so many of them.

712
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Excuse me.

713
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:21,000
DarkTetsuya says, exactly. Soon as the current systems start to ship, they're likely right back on the drawing board for whatever's next.

714
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Rama says, put a couple of the minor characters in mobile games. Oh, that's a good thought.

715
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Maybe some characters that deserve a little more love that we don't seem to ever get their games on console.

716
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Like Tingle could have his own game on mobile or Birdo or I don't know, like kind of like, you know, the B-list Nintendo characters. Why not?

717
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Tingle's match three jewel game. Yeah, I could see that.

718
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Tingle's rupee extravaganza or something. Who knows? Who knows? That'd be great.

719
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
That'd be lame.

720
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
You'd play it once, Loki.

721
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
I wouldn't play it at all.

722
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
My phone wouldn't run it.

723
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
You say that now.

724
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
I do say that now because my phone wouldn't run it.

725
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
You're not going to get a new phone before then?

726
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Probably not.

727
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Alright.

728
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:15,000
DarkSakura, I know you're not a Wii U owner, so I know you don't really have your finger on the pulse of everything happening with Nintendo, but how do you kind of take to this news?

729
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Is this something you're interested in seeing Nintendo explore? Is that tablet universe or do you wish they would just kind of stick with consoles?

730
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:34,000
It depends on what they put out, honestly. With knowing so little about what's coming out, I mean, if they did Dr. Mario on iOS, I'd totally be down for it.

731
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Yoshi's Cookie would be a great, like some of the puzzlers would be great.

732
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I'm not much of a fan of Yoshi's Cookie.

733
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I love Yoshi's Cookie and that would be a great one with Touching Girls.

734
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
But I love Dr. Mario.

735
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
That's fair.

736
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:55,000
But I mean, I would love to have some of the classic games on there, but you have to be really careful with how they do it because some games do not translate to touchscreen at all.

737
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Like Super Mario Brothers, not going to work on a touchscreen. Zelda, not going to work on a touchscreen.

738
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
No, not necessarily. The first Zelda game could work on touchscreen.

739
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
It would work on a touchscreen.

740
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
The first one?

741
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:12,000
No, it would work on a touchscreen because they've had touchscreen-based Zelda games for the DS and it works just fine with a touchscreen.

742
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I'm just wondering.

743
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I just don't think that the second one would because it's more of a platformer aspect.

744
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:22,000
But I like the idea of them being like just separate, like this is another Hyrule adventure.

745
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Like that Phantom Hourglass was kind of like a side story, right?

746
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
So as long as they're side stories.

747
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:33,000
But then when we talk side stories in Zelda, you know somebody's got to say CDI.

748
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Don't go down that road again.

749
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Let's hope that is not what ends up happening because that would be very sad.

750
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Some folks in chat saying Oramase agrees, Yoshi's cookie. Tiger Claw saying Yoshi's cookie clicker.

751
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Now you're talking. Now you're talking.

752
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
That's more of a Wario game. I can see that.

753
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Brad from Pod Culture, I can't believe none of us said that Animal Crossing mobile game.

754
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Maybe.

755
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Oh yeah, Animal Crossing in the style of Smurf Village. Oh, you're going to love it.

756
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Dark Soccer just gasped.

757
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Just gasped.

758
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
But I want Animal Crossing all the things now.

759
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Hey, you want that really cool wallpaper for your house?

760
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Look at all these Nintendo employees that just joined our chat.

761
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Shout out all the Nintendo mobile games they want.

762
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Alright, let's move on. Speaking of Nintendo, you know this is just one of those stories where I look at this and I go,

763
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Nintendo, maybe you're just cutting too many corners. I don't know.

764
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
As much as I stick up for Nintendo on this show and there's a lot of things they do that I love,

765
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
this is one of those things where I go, really guys?

766
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Nintendo has announced that Xenoblade Chronicles 3D is going to be an 8GB download,

767
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:52,000
which means it will not fit on the 4GB MicroSD card that comes with your new 3DS or your new 3DS XL.

768
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,000
So if you want to digitally download Xenoblade Chronicles 3D, you're going to have to get a new memory card.

769
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,000
So you can just pick that up when you pick up your charger, which the system also did not come with.

770
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Now, in all fairness, because I know the Nintendo fanboys will yell at me if I don't mention it,

771
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:15,000
certainly a lot of folks out there already have a charger and probably already have a bigger card that they used on their last system.

772
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:21,000
But it does seem a little strange that they couldn't have just put out a slightly bigger card for it to come in.

773
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,000
You can always just go buy the damn cartridge. You don't have to digitally download the game.

774
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:32,000
But it just seems so weird to me that they couldn't think six months ahead that the very first game we're going to put out

775
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,000
that requires the new 3DS, people aren't going to be able to digitally download because the card's too small.

776
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Like, is memory that expensive? I don't think it was.

777
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
No, it's absolutely not expensive.

778
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:48,000
So, it's just one of those, like, too many corners. Been cutting too many.

779
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Anyhow.

780
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Some other comments on the game that the port mentions.

781
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,000
They mention when making the port, the specs of the Wii are actually higher than the new Nintendo 3DS.

782
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:09,000
So they're saying, on top of this, implementing the 3D effect, which requires double the image processing, made it even harder.

783
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,000
This is all coming from the game's coordinator, Hiro Yamada.

784
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
However, we used a lot of tricks, technically, as well as in our working methods.

785
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:22,000
We achieved the 3D effect while retaining an almost equal graphical quality, except for the resolution.

786
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Without the higher performance of the CPU on the new 3DS compared to Nintendo 3DS, we simply wouldn't have been able to port the game.

787
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:38,000
The new Nintendo 3DS also comes with the C-Stick and the ZL and ZR, which was really helpful, as we could just use the Wii Classic Controller control scheme without any changes.

788
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Porting the game itself was difficult.

789
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Importing the game, we had to use a lot of technical tricks to show both seamlessly without performance drops.

790
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Dealing with the 3D effect was a difficult challenge, but something we deemed necessary to provide players with a sense of immersion with these huge landscapes.

791
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
So, there you go.

792
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I still am not going to buy myself a new 3DS just for this game, but I feel like this is one of those games that I'll kind of pick up when it goes on sale after some other game is announced at E3 that I'm going to have to buy a new Nintendo 3DS for.

793
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
And hopefully some different colors will be announced at E3 as well. That's my hope.

794
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I want a green one.

795
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Yeah, right.

796
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
In our chat room, Dungeon Buster says,

797
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Skandis and Kingston thank Nintendo for their business.

798
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Right?

799
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

800
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Well, there is a, there's a rumor going around that basically Hideo Kojima is pretty much not going to work on Metal Gear Solid 5, the Phantom Pain, anymore.

801
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:48,000
But he and Konami both issued a joint statement that says the game is still going to come out, he's still 100% involved, and he's determined to make it, quote,

802
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
the greatest game I've ever directed to date. Don't miss it, end quote.

803
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:02,000
So it should be released on Tuesday, September 1st, 2015, which is my wedding anniversary. Ten years, can you believe it?

804
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Thank you Kojima for my present.

805
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
How appropriate that a Metal Gear game is coming out on your anniversary.

806
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Mmm, Metal Gear.

807
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:16,000
And he's saying that this is going to be his last one again.

808
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
But he's still working on other things for Konami.

809
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,000
He's just not saying what exactly PTPTPTPTPTPT.

810
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Silent Hills, yeah.

811
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Yes.

812
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:36,000
That better be one of them, because that's where my head went when I heard all this, I was like, the hell with Metal Gear, I could care less about Metal Gear, sorry Metal Gear fans.

813
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
What the hell's going to happen to Silent Hills? I need to know this.

814
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Well, we don't have anything about that within this article, but as far as we know, it's still on track, and so is Metal Gear Solid 5.

815
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:54,000
There were other players with Silent Hills as well. I mean, you know, Guillermo del Toro is obviously a huge part of that.

816
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Yeah.

817
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,000
You know, but I just, I worry. I just hope that game didn't get derailed by this.

818
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
But maybe-

819
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Happy thoughts, happy thoughts.

820
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Yeah, maybe, and maybe Silent Hills is on track for a Halloween release this year. I mean-

821
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
That would be great.

822
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:13,000
We did get the demo, so I mean, it is feasible that Kojima could probably wrap up both games around the same time.

823
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:18,000
I mean, P.T., how long ago did P.T. come out? It was a while ago. It was last year, right?

824
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
I don't know. I'm just incredibly amused that I beat it the first time around.

825
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
You're right. But anyway, uh-

826
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I wanted to smack that ugly baby in the thing.

827
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:42,000
The other weird thing about all this news coming out is, why now? Isn't this usually the type of news you wait, and then the game comes out, and then you say,

828
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Oh, Kojima's leaving Konami after, you know, he's finally making good on his promises.

829
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I think it's more of someone noticed that his name had been taken off of, like, some of the Konami pages.

830
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,000
But still, why did they make it obvious now? Did they, did they, I guess they had to? I don't know, legally?

831
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
It's weird.

832
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:11,000
I still, the game has got to be so far along at this point that I don't think the, like, the Metal Gear game you're going to get is going to be the same Kojima levels as all your, like, it's just, it's too far along at this point.

833
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
You're going to get what you get, and you're going to like it.

834
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Exactly. Exactly. But, uh, yeah, I worry about-

835
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:26,000
You eat your peas. You eat your Phantom Pain. No dessert if you don't, no pea tea if you don't do Phantom Pain. No dessert.

836
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:36,000
And without Kojima, like, what does Konami have left? Soccer? Like, what's, I'd like to know a little bit more from Konami.

837
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:42,000
What does your, what does your five-year plan look like? Like, what, what games will you be releasing?

838
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Pop and music and pachinko machines.

839
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I, I, and, you know, we, we can't forget, Konami does have a huge business, huge business, that is not just games for the PlayStation, the Xbox, and the Wii.

840
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Like, it's, there's a huge physical gambling device, you know, uh, division, and maybe that's where they're at.

841
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I wish that they would, though, bring back the Super Konami World franchise and have all those game mashups, you know, because that's kind of the popular genre right now.

842
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:19,000
I feel like things like that don't start happening until somebody buys Konami digital entertainment.

843
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I, I feel like if a lot of these dominoes keep falling, at some point, Konami will sell off just that digital arm.

844
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:36,000
They're gonna keep all that other casino business and all that stuff, that'll, that'll still be like Konami, but they'll sell off that branch to somebody else.

845
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
But, who knows?

846
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:44,000
You know what they need to do? What would, I think, be their salvation? Is continue the Symphony of the Night series.

847
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:50,000
We have Rondo of Blood, we do Symphony of the Night, we do something continuing on with Alucard and Richter.

848
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Yeah, but, um,

849
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Everyone would play it and you know that would happen.

850
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Castlevania guy's long gone from Konami. He left.

851
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
So?

852
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
I worry.

853
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
There are people who love it. I mean, I do pay attention to developers, but not many other people do.

854
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:13,000
So all they're gonna see is, this is the third in the series for Rondo of Blood, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Castlevania, wee.

855
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
It's called Castle Wank.

856
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Castle Wankia.

857
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Castle Wankia, coming to a Playstation near you.

858
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Yeah.

859
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Moving on, Loki.

860
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
So, this is kinda lame, but apparently there's been some bullying being done by Atari.

861
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Atari of all people, or companies, I should say. Although we are treating corporations like people nowadays.

862
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Seriously, what have they done lately, aside from some really terrible mobile games and proposed really terrible reboots of different franchises?

863
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
But now they are bullying developers.

864
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:57,000
And Jeff Minter, who also did the remake of Tempest 2000, has a new game that he was working on called TXK.

865
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:05,000
And it was supposed to be coming out on the Playstation Vita and then later on on Playstation 4 PC and Android and also VR.

866
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:17,000
Apparently, he got a cease and desist from Atari because his game was infringing on Atari's intellectual property.

867
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Basically saying that it's a blatant copy of the Tempest games.

868
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:33,000
And it was supposed to be kind of like a spiritual successor to Tempest, but they were basically saying that he has to remove this from the market.

869
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,000
And any copies have to be destroyed, deleted, and then the source code has to be delivered to Atari.

870
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:43,000
And he's just kind of, it's like, what the hell?

871
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Because this game is not Tempest, but they're just near this point.

872
00:59:50,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I don't know if you'd really be able to say that, because you can kind of copy styles and stuff, you can't really copyright gameplay.

873
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
So I don't know how they can really get across saying that it's...

874
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
They do look really similar though.

875
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I mean, look, I understand why people are upset with Atari, because this is the game that people want to play.

876
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Atari is not making that game. Somebody else made that game. Why can't I have that game?

877
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Gamer entitlement, right? This is why people are upset.

878
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:31,000
But at the same time, people, come on, the game is a lot like Tempest.

879
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Which, and I'm not saying, that doesn't make it bad, that absolutely doesn't make it bad, it actually makes it quite good.

880
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:45,000
But I kind of think, okay, Atari has a right to say, please don't copy this game.

881
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Even if we all think Atari should be saying we would like to buy your game and publish it under Atari.

882
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
We would like to partner with you. That's, I think, the resolution a lot of us would like to see.

883
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:02,000
And maybe this weird legal bullying, if they're going to have to turn over the source code,

884
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
maybe in some sick way Atari will end up putting the game out anyway, which is kind of weird.

885
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:16,000
But, I mean, there is a part of me that does kind of go, okay, but is Atari really like this awful, evil, bad guy villain?

886
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Because the games are kind of similar, people.

887
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I mean, are we really going to turn a blind eye to that? I have to ask that difficult question.

888
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:34,000
Are we really going to say, oh no, these two games are completely different?

889
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:42,000
I don't know, it's just, how far do you drill it down to saying it's a clone of something?

890
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:50,000
I mean, how far do you say it? It kind of goes down to the Street Fighter type clones and stuff.

891
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:56,000
You know what I'm really reminded of is, and we spent forever talking about this on the show,

892
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:01,000
when In the Groove came out, and it was very, very similar to DDR, right?

893
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:04,000
And there was definitely two schools of thought with that.

894
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:10,000
There was one school of thought where people, it's DDR, and Konami isn't giving us new DDR,

895
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:16,000
so somebody's giving us new DDR, so I want to fucking play new DDR, even if it's got a new name, right?

896
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:22,000
And then, you know, there was other people that really enjoyed the fact that In the Groove

897
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:27,000
probably lent itself a little more to the Perfect Attack game as opposed to the Freestyle game.

898
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:35,000
It kind of pushed the Perfect Attack game to the next level, and then it had the poison arrows was the thing, right?

899
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:40,000
And then Konami ended up even actually adapting that into their games later, after all that lawsuit and everything.

900
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,000
But, you know, those two, despite wherever you felt about those two games,

901
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,000
we kind of saw what happened there, where those two games were awfully similar.

902
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:57,000
But I can also see the point of where do you draw the line of, but a dancing game anybody should be able to make.

903
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I just think, I mean, unless gameplay is exactly the same, which I did kind of read the arguments a little bit,

904
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
and they did point out a lot of similarities between the two.

905
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:12,000
And I got to say, definitely the main ship looks awfully similar, and the game field looks pretty similar,

906
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:20,000
but I don't know how similar it's got to be before you can actually file a lawsuit against it, you know what I mean?

907
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Especially on a game like Tempest, it looks really simple.

908
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:28,000
It's like, I don't know, has vector graphics, and it's on like, you know, kind of like a hallway type thing,

909
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:35,000
that you're shooting ships that are coming up. I don't really know where to draw the line there, I guess.

910
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,000
But that's not for me to care, because that's for a lawyer in the court to decide, I guess.

911
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
All right, obviously our chat room is lighting up on this,

912
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
and I do want to make sure we get some other comments out on this over at live.vognetware.com.

913
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Dungeon Buster's saying, Atari's bound to the system that their lawyers are obligated to use to protect the IP of their clients, regardless of the fallout.

914
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,000
Nascent Games, I hope I said that right, says Atari is another Konami.

915
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,000
They are doing nothing constructive other than telling others what they can't do.

916
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:07,000
YYR over at live.vognetware.com says the debate isn't whether the games are similar to each other,

917
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:18,000
the debate is whether TXK is legal. Truthfully, TXK contains 0% of Tempest 2000's code, audio, or visuals.

918
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,000
And YYR says Capcom versus Data East, that is all I have to say.

919
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Dungeon Buster's saying Magnavox did the same thing in the 80's against other companies that developed consoles, even Nintendo had to settle.

920
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
I just wish Atari had something good coming out, but they don't.

921
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:38,000
And like anything that they talk about, like was it the reboot of Asteroids that they're doing, it's like, what the hell is that?

922
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Well, and Atari even did a Tempest game on the 360 at least, I think it was the last time I remember one,

923
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:51,000
and it was okay just because Tempest is such a solid game, but it wasn't Tempest 2000, you know what I mean?

924
01:04:51,000 --> 01:05:01,000
And like, Tempest 2000 was the reason to own an Atari Jaguar, like that was the like must-have game on the Jaguar, right?

925
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:10,000
So there's a lot of people that want to re-experience that, so I mean, again, I'm not like against this game per se,

926
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:17,000
I would love to see that resolution where can't we all just get along type of thing where, you know, maybe Atari sees this,

927
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:22,000
and sees that people want it, yeah, but you're right, and it's lawyers that screw all that up on that side.

928
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:32,000
It's tough. I kind of agree with the comment that like, unfortunately, as much of dirtbags as it might make Atari look like,

929
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I believe the way the law is, you have to try to enforce your intellectual property or you're gonna lose it.

930
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:46,000
You do, but like, I just, it's not, I think that's necessarily for like trademarks and stuff,

931
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:51,000
because I could see that they have like, they have the protector trademarks, so like if a game comes,

932
01:05:51,000 --> 01:06:01,000
like if you put out a game called Tempest or something like, or Tempest Quest or, I don't know, you know, Tempest Saga,

933
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:09,000
then he would, they would need to protect their copy, or their trademark, or they will lose that trademark.

934
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:15,000
But we're not talking about a trademark here, I mean, there's, it's not called Tempest, so at this point,

935
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I guess they're trying to say it's a, you know, infringement on their copyright.

936
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Well, they're saying trademark as well, but I don't see it.

937
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:30,000
So now they're saying it's a copyright, well that should be easy to prove, because they didn't use any assets from Tempest,

938
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:40,000
so I don't know. I mean, come on, if we can live in a world that fucking Mighty No. 9 can come out and not be Mega Man,

939
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:51,000
then this should not be Tempest. It's easy as that. Because Mighty No. 9 is so fucking Mega Man, it's not even funny.

940
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:57,000
You know, and it's interesting, because the Capcom versus Data East thing is getting brought up a lot,

941
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,000
so I want to just kind of remind people what happened with that. I went to the good old wiki to refresh my memory.

942
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Were they not bad enough dudes for come?

943
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:12,000
So, okay, so here's the deal. So, Capcom USA sued Data East over Fighter's History, which if you've never played the game,

944
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:18,000
is pretty much Street Fighter 2 for the Super Nintendo, but it, Karnov was, I remember Karnov was a character,

945
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:23,000
and so they had some, like, different characters, but it played a lot like Street Fighter 2, right?

946
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:29,000
So, Capcom felt this was an infringement on Street Fighter 2, and then they also went after Data East in Japan.

947
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Now, Data East said that they started it with Karate Champ in 1984, and that was the originator of the fighting game genre,

948
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:50,000
and that predated the original Street Fighter three years. So, a trial date was set in 1994, noting some of the similarities and so forth.

949
01:07:50,000 --> 01:08:00,000
However, ultimately, Capcom lost the case, stating that the copied elements were scenes of fare and thus excluded from copyright,

950
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:08,000
and what that means is that it's a scene that is almost obligatory for a genre of its type.

951
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:18,000
So, as an example, a spy novel will have Swiss bank accounts, a femme fatale, gadgets and devices.

952
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:26,000
There are certain things you expect will happen in these types, so it's very, very interesting how that all played out.

953
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Loki, you want to say something?

954
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

955
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Please, open your mouth, please.

956
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:40,000
So, like a Peter Molyneaux game, you expect to be let down by high expectations, does that, you know, fall under that?

957
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Jamie, do you have something more constructive?

958
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:54,000
This makes me want to write a spy novel that doesn't include the gadgets, has a femme fatale, and uses a mattress with money in it.

959
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Don't steal my idea!

960
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
I'm gonna do Redneck Bond.

961
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Your Swiss bank account's like a giant block of Swiss cheese that they hide money in.

962
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
My spy novel's gonna be Jimmy Bond.

963
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:11,000
You know what, all I use my Swiss bank account for is to buy ABBA albums.

964
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,000
That is all you need a Swiss bank account for, I'm just saying.

965
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
No, you just have people who buy you ABBA albums.

966
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Hey, I bought that one in Seattle.

967
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I bought you Super Trooper.

968
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I know you did, I know you did.

969
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Alright.

970
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Like three years ago.

971
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Anyhow, MXC in chat asking, where was Atari when TXK launched a year ago on the Vita?

972
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Well, you know how fast the lawyers work, right?

973
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Anyway.

974
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
They run off a computer system still based off the 2600.

975
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I think we're gonna be hearing a lot more on this.

976
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I think we're gonna get some phone calls on it later and probably some emails.

977
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:47,000
But you know what, I welcome all the perspectives.

978
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,000
At the end of the day, again, I just want to reiterate, like, even though I'm bringing up a counterpoint

979
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:56,000
I think people don't want to hear, I really wish these guys could just hug it out somehow, you know?

980
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
We want to play the game, let us play the game.

981
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Yeah, I mean, I understand that lawyers have their job, and that's fine.

982
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:09,000
But at the same time, they are supposed to be doing, you know, making sure they're enforcing their trademarks.

983
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:17,000
They could also come to, like, an agreement that, like, okay, we find that this is not infringing on our trademarks, so it's okay.

984
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Like, that's why I got to figure, you know, with some of these companies that have names or their trademark names,

985
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,000
like, remember Elder Scrolls and Scrolls and stuff like that?

986
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Like, I don't think that they necessarily wanted to sue them or thought that they were infringing on a trademark,

987
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
but they had to do it in order to keep their trademarks.

988
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:42,000
So I just, once again, it comes back to needing to, you know, fix our trademark and copyright laws.

989
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Alright, let's move on to a story about something happening in PlayStation's world.

990
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:57,000
This doesn't directly relate to games, but as you know, in this day and age, unlike when this show started almost 13 years ago,

991
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:02,000
the game devices that are in your living room are now entertainment devices.

992
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
What are you talking about? They've always been able to play CDs.

993
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:14,000
That's true. You could always drop those fat tunes from, you know, such popular 90s artists on your PlayStation.

994
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:23,000
But anyway, the PlayStation 4, Sony's going to be pushing, of course, more home entertainment things in the PlayStation,

995
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,000
and Sony has created Vue, which is a television streaming service.

996
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:35,000
This is officially launching this past week in New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia. Those are some pretty big markets.

997
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
It's pronounced Chicago.

998
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Chicago. Da Bears. Vue will be offering a mixture of live and on-demand content from cable networks,

999
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:54,000
such as offerings from Discovery, who happens to own Animal Planet, TLC, which, damn, I love me some TLC.

1000
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,000
Some trash learning channel. That is some trash learning.

1001
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:03,000
And most importantly, the Oprah Winfrey Network, and I wouldn't dare say anything negative about Oprah Winfrey.

1002
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Yeah, or she'll hit some hit squad against you.

1003
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:12,000
That's right. NBCUniversal, who makes the all-important Bravo Network and the Real Housewives of Sony County.

1004
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:19,000
And also will be broadcasting television from NBC, CBS, and Fox. Interesting ABC's absent from that. Did you notice that?

1005
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Anyhow, PSVU will also have a virtually unlimited digital video recording device.

1006
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:29,000
And so, of course, a lot of comments being made on this this week.

1007
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:36,000
I love this, though, from Eric Lempel, who is part of the, he's actually the head of Sony's network's entertainment division, saying,

1008
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:41,000
the point of view is to, quote, take the burden out of watching television.

1009
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Really? You guys.

1010
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Oh my god, keep my eyes open.

1011
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Where did I put the remote? This is so difficult.

1012
01:12:53,000 --> 01:13:00,000
I just want to watch Drag Race and go to bed. Come on.

1013
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Do you not going to say it? What? What? Come on.

1014
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,000
America, this is why you're fat.

1015
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:13,000
PlayStation TV. No, good TV. Better TV.

1016
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Anyhow, is this free?

1017
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:23,000
The reason behind it is, of course, it's not free. The reason behind it is that it's streamlining the interactive elements that consumers find frustrating.

1018
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:29,000
DVR management, channel guides have been reconsidered. It's not a book you have to read.

1019
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Remember back in my day, kids, the TV guide was something you bought at the supermarket.

1020
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
It was something you had to open it and you had to read.

1021
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
This is funny, actually.

1022
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Or you had to wait until Friday to get the one out of the newspaper.

1023
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,000
You got a crossword puzzle every damn week.

1024
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:53,000
This is funny. My son, he had to go to the bathroom the other day when we were over at his grandma's house.

1025
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,000
He's like, if I go, will the show remember where I was at?

1026
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I'm like, no. This is TV, not Netflix. Sorry.

1027
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Because he's so used to watching Netflix at home, let me just pause it.

1028
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Anyhow, some of this is interesting.

1029
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:16,000
View can also store a backlog of every episode currently airing, available on catch-up or on demand.

1030
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:26,000
For example, if you want to watch every episode of The Simpsons, you will have access to all the episodes according to what networks are airing them.

1031
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Thank you, non-Hulu device.

1032
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Yes, Hulu, when you want to catch up on the last two episodes of a series or something like that.

1033
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Anyhow, some thoughts about how this is going to work.

1034
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Surely Comcast has some issues with this.

1035
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
Oh god, they have issues with everything.

1036
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
But now with net neutrality, there may not be a lot they can do about it.

1037
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I don't know.

1038
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,000
I don't know, Comcast has subscriptions.

1039
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Well, they'll just make cable more expensive.

1040
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
I think that's ultimately what's going to happen.

1041
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Your cable internet is just going to cost what internet and TV costs now.

1042
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
They're just going to find ways to keep kicking out.

1043
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,000
It'll be bandwidth caps and all this other stuff.

1044
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
As long as there's no competition.

1045
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
In other words, they're going to throw a tantrum.

1046
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Yeah, in a way.

1047
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
There should be competition, ideally.

1048
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,000
We'll see.

1049
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Have people move in.

1050
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
That's a whole other slippery slope, but we'll see.

1051
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Well, if they raise my rates up to what it costs to have TV, then yeah, I won't be going with Comcast.

1052
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
So there you go.

1053
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I'm trying to see what the price is of this whole thing.

1054
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Free with PlayStation Plus.

1055
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Is it free with PlayStation Plus?

1056
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
I don't know, I'm hoping.

1057
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Though PlayStation Plus, Sony's subscription service for gaming, doesn't have anything to do with Vue.

1058
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Damn it.

1059
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
They say it could change in the future.

1060
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Maybe Sony would tie the two services together and create a streamlined billing process.

1061
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Or maybe incentives for some type of tiered programming package.

1062
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Also, hey, you could get the PlayStation Plus show.

1063
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Powers is on Vue, y'all.

1064
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
So you could check that out if you ever watch it.

1065
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Oh, here it is. Here's the price.

1066
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Seven day trial period.

1067
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,000
And then after that, you can do one of three pricing tiers.

1068
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
You ready, Loki?

1069
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:15,000
For the elite tier, $70.

1070
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
For the core tier, $60.

1071
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:21,000
For the access tier, $50.

1072
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
That's the lowest tier.

1073
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Is that per year?

1074
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,000
50 bucks.

1075
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Monthly pricing tiers.

1076
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Fuck that. Nope. Sorry.

1077
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
How much are you paying for Comcast, though? Isn't it pretty similar?

1078
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
I'm not paying for Comcast TV.

1079
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:35,000
So that is $70 more than I'm gonna pay.

1080
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:42,000
I'm sorry. Why would I do that when I can just get Hulu and Netflix for a lot cheaper?

1081
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Sorry. No.

1082
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,000
I can do it. I can do it.

1083
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

1084
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Okay, this comment about Oprah Winfrey was too funny for me to pass up.

1085
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Akuma JP in our chatroom says,

1086
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
And you get to hit O-L-R. And you get to hit O-L-R.

1087
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Okay, I thought that was funny. It was just me.

1088
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Tigerclaw says,

1089
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:08,000
My TiVo records a lot of shows. I never get around to watching them, except for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

1090
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Of course, Tigerclaw. Of course.

1091
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Do they air the old ones that I remember from the 90s? Do they still air that one?

1092
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,000
I am pissed off at the comics right now because they just killed off someone.

1093
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:26,000
They didn't really kill him off because in the next preview episode, they'll do a reboot. He's not dead.

1094
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
I hope not.

1095
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
They're not gonna do that.

1096
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
That was fucked up.

1097
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Seriously, why would I pay them $70, or even $50, when seriously it costs less to bundle that in with Comcast, who is not cheap by any means?

1098
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Why the fuck would I pay more to do that? It makes no goddamn sense.

1099
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Well, now Bobby Blackwolf giving an interesting thought on this.

1100
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Comcast doesn't have an issue with this because NBCUniversal is involved. That's a good point.

1101
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Why would NBC be on board when Comcast now owns them?

1102
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Yeah. Sling. There you go. That's what I'm talking about right there. Sling. $19.99 a month. I can deal with that.

1103
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Oh, that comment from Nascent Games there in our chat room over at Live.VogNetwork.com.

1104
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Let's see, one other comment here from YYR.

1105
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:21,000
The one thing I'm most concerned about regarding internet-based TV versus more traditional TV, buffering, net neutralities, importance increases.

1106
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:27,000
That's a good counterpoint, though, from Bobby that if NBC's involved, that means Comcast knows what's about to happen here.

1107
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
I don't know. I've got to be honest. I haven't really run into issues with buffering.

1108
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:42,000
It's just you will notice when it's buffering a little bit that it kind of looks a little compressed, but usually it's not so bad. I don't know. I've never really run into problems.

1109
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:50,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andrade with VogNetwork.com, use the passphrase, Snake.

1110
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Alright, let's go from the future to the past Dark Soccer and a game that's near and dear to all of our hearts, I think, right, Jamie?

1111
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Well, kinda. Final Fantasy XI, how often did we play that?

1112
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Cure, please. Raise, please.

1113
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
That's why I quit.

1114
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
I would still be playing it now if it was free to play.

1115
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Raise, please. Teleport, please.

1116
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Or at least just drop the monthly fee to like $5. $5 or even less than that.

1117
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Well, now it's not going to be at all because on PS2 and Xbox 360, it is going to be shut down in March of next year.

1118
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:37,000
The PC version will continue on, but basically they're going to start doing the special content called Rhapsodies.

1119
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:47,000
It will be a grand conclusion to the Final Fantasy series' first MMORPG, Square Enix has stated.

1120
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:53,000
The Rhapsodies contents will be in three parts with the first chunk of it coming out in May this year.

1121
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Then there'll be another one in August and another one at the end of the year in November.

1122
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
And a fourth one named the Bohemian Rhapsody.

1123
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,000
I thought it would be the Behemoth Rhapsody.

1124
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Bohemiathan Rhapsody, there you go.

1125
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:14,000
They are also doing a mobile version of Final Fantasy XI with Nexon Korea that will be out at some point in 2016.

1126
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:22,000
So my thought is that they are shutting down the console versions to pave the way for Server Room or something, I guess.

1127
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Well, I think they're trying to switch everything off of Play Online to what the hell is it now?

1128
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Mog Station is what they have for XIV.

1129
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,000
I think that's what they're doing, and they can't do that with PS2 at 360.

1130
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:45,000
And maybe they're going to give it a nice little graphical update, which would be kind of nice, and maybe they can't do that.

1131
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Well, they can probably do that on 360, but they can't do that on PlayStation 2.

1132
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Well, and I think 360 in general is on its way out, in a way.

1133
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
It's all about the one now, right?

1134
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:05,000
So I was more surprised that they didn't announce some type of updated client for PlayStation 4 or some of the other systems, but I don't know.

1135
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
They want everybody on XIV, though.

1136
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:19,000
I guess. Well, if people are willing to pay for both, and I know people who've been willing to pay for both, I may have done it myself, do they really need to force people to move?

1137
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,000
I think that they should just do a version of it that's free to play.

1138
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:37,000
But I understand. The problem is that they don't know how to keep both around, both XIV and XI around, without making changes to XI that would take away people from XIV is the problem, I think.

1139
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Because they don't know how to do that. If you make it free to play, you may lose some players from XIV.

1140
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:49,000
If you cut down the costs of it, you may lose that. I don't know how they're going to do it.

1141
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:52,000
I wish there was an offline version of the game. That would be pretty nice.

1142
01:21:52,000 --> 01:22:06,000
That's what I was hoping they'd announce, is that, you know, we're just going to, you know, we'll have maybe these servers for people that want to pay for it, but for people that just want to experience it, we have these trusts and ways that you can kind of play the game as a single player and experience it.

1143
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:21,000
I was hoping that's where they'd go with it, but no, we're going to make a mobile version of it, because everybody wants a freaking mobile game. The investors want mobile. Mobile's where it's at. Mobile, people. Mobile, mobile, mobile. You get a mobile, and you get a mobile.

1144
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:30,000
I guess I can't knock it until it comes out, but I'm worried that the mobile version will be like $60 because it is a Square Enix game, and so they have their fees.

1145
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:43,000
I think there are legitimate reasons to be very concerned with Square Enix and mobile. Like, they have a tendency to release games and then just not support them. And The World Ends With You, I think, is a good example.

1146
01:22:43,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Because I want to say The World Ends With You, and maybe somebody in chat, don't take me literally with this. I just remember reading something about it, and maybe somebody in chat can help me out. But I want to say that The World Ends With You stops working on iOS 8, and they're not going to patch it. They're not going to bother. They're done. After they charge a premium for people to play that game.

1147
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:19,000
So, I think there's a lot of legitimate reasons to be concerned about Square Enix and the mobile space. Like, if they can't demonstrate that they're going to support these types of games when they're charging a premium for them, I think we have the right to be cautious with our money.

1148
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:29,000
So, just throwing that out there. Somebody in chat, please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. Over at live.vognetwork.com.

1149
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Tigerclaw in chat says, we gotta stop calling it mobile. I suppose it's tablet, but I mean, a lot of touch devices. Portable devices.

1150
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Tablets on a mobile device? I mean, can you not be mobile with them?

1151
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Yeah, see, the thing is that even if I were to call it a portable device, I still think there's a very clear distinction between a 3DS and a Vita, and then a phone.

1152
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:57,000
It's considered mobile for the most part. I mean, I don't understand what the big deal is.

1153
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Alright, let's move on with some more news. Actually, we'll do some release dates. We'll travel around the world and check out what's coming out a whole lot sooner than the Final Fantasy XI mobile version. Loki, starting in the US.

1154
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Okay, so this week we've got Bloodborne coming out on Playstation 4, so that should be pretty awesome, especially if you're a fan of Dark Souls or something like that.

1155
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:40,000
So look for that. And then also, Borderlands, the handsome collection on Playstation 4 and Xbox One. I may have to pick that up, because I didn't pick up the pre-sequel, and it does look pretty awesome, so let me have to do that.

1156
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:56,000
They're doing a physical release for Child of Light for the Vita. And then we have Lego Ninjago Shadows of Ronin for 3DS. Is that it? Let's see. Yep, that would be it for that week.

1157
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Sorry, I had to investigate that whole world ends with you thing. And it looks like Square Enix did actually pull the game from iTunes, and they put out a support notice, and this all happened in February, saying that the service had been suspended and that they are, I guess, working to update the game, but at the current time it was no longer available for purchase from iTunes and couldn't even be re-downloaded.

1158
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:29,000
So I don't know if that ever actually got fixed. Maybe somebody in our chat knows or could search iTunes real quick for that.

1159
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Anyhow, meanwhile, going over to Japan and checking out some of the releases over there. I'm not sure if there's an awful lot this week over in Japan. They usually get their games on Fridays.

1160
01:25:44,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Actually, I'm so wrong. There are quite a few things coming out in Japan this week on March 26th, including Bloodborne on the PlayStation 4, Kagero Muhitori no Princess in a regular and premium box, Makai Senkei Disgaea 5 comes out. That's kind of a huge deal over on the PlayStation 4. I know there's some Disgaea fans out there.

1161
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Sengoku Hime 5, Senkattatsu Hao no Kifu comes out this week, and One Piece, Kaizuko Musou 3, those are all releases on the PlayStation 4 this week, so a pretty busy week over there in Japan.

1162
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:23,000
The Xbox One, not getting any of those games this week, actually. It's a lot quieter on the Xbox One this week.

1163
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:41,000
On the PlayStation 3 in Japan, One Piece, Kaizuko Musou 3, Senkoku Hime 5, Senkattatsu Hao no Kifu, Pro Yaku Spirits 2015, that Muhitori no Princess game, and Sword Art Online, Lost Song on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.

1164
01:26:41,000 --> 01:27:01,000
On the Wii U, Susume Kinopio Taiko, an amiibo set, comes out this week. So this is Mario Party, and their version, or is this, no, this is a version of Captain Toad with a Toad amiibo that's coming out in Japan.

1165
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:09,000
That's what that is. It's not Mario Party, it's Captain Toad, but like an amiibo bundle set. That's pretty cool that they're getting that, because I don't think we have that here in the States.

1166
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Also on the Japanese release schedule, looking at the handhelds real quick, on the PlayStation Vita, Kagero Muhitori no Princess is there as well.

1167
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:30,000
One Piece, Kaizuko Musou 3, Pro Yaku Spirits 2015, Sword Art Online, Lost Song, Justy Cross Nasty.

1168
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
There's a Sword Art Online game.

1169
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:40,000
Mao Hajimemashita comes out in regular and limited edition. Yes, the name of the game is Justy Cross Nasty.

1170
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Hajimemashite?

1171
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Yeah, and I don't have screenshots from this game. I'm assuming these are the two characters. Let me look at the limited edition here real quick and see if there's screenshots.

1172
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:55,000
There's just these two characters, who I'm assuming are Justy and Nasty. So, maybe it's pronounced different in Japanese.

1173
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:03,000
If I have kids, I'm going to name my first one Nasty. Is it N-A-S-T-E?

1174
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:05,000
It's N-A-S-T-Y.

1175
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Then that would be Nasty.

1176
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Yeah, because if it was N-A-S-T-E, I would say Nasty.

1177
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Alright, Justy Cross Nasty.

1178
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:24,000
And lastly, on the 3DS this week, Lego Ninja, oops sorry, that's a US release, Kuroko no Basuke Mirai Inokizuna comes out this week.

1179
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:30,000
And, I bet a lot of you will be importing, Theatrhythm Dragon Quest comes out this week on the 3DS in Japan.

1180
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Dark Sakura, how about the UK?

1181
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
On the 24th, we have Grand Theft Auto 5 for PC.

1182
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:46,000
And on the 26th, Iron Cast for Mac and PC, Pillars of Eternity for Mac and PC, and The Trace for iPad and iOS.

1183
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
The iPhone, both iOS versions.

1184
01:28:49,000 --> 01:29:08,000
On the 27th, we have Borderlands The Handsome Collection for PS4, Xbox One, Oddworld New and Tasty on Xbox One, Ride on a bunch of stuff, and Tokiden Kyoku on Playstation Vita and PS4.

1185
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

1186
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Actually, I have one more, because I forgot the 28th.

1187
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Sorry.

1188
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Yeah, Bloodborne.

1189
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Oh, of course.

1190
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,000
And, there's also one on the 31st, I'm just going to go ahead and mention it, is Neverwinter.

1191
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Wow.

1192
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Oh, the Neverwinter, the online one, right.

1193
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week. Loki.

1194
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:50,000
So, this is disappointing. Unfortunately, there's been some layoffs at Evolution Studios, the company behind the wonderful Motorstorm franchise, and now the not-so-wonderful Drive Club.

1195
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:55,000
So, yeah, they've been hit with a number of layoffs, they say.

1196
01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Mentioning, I guess, that the focus of the studio will be updating the games as a service, while still trying to launch the Playstation Plus version of Drive Club.

1197
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
That kind of sucks.

1198
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Are we ever going to see that stinkin' Drive Club release at this point?

1199
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
I kind of don't care at this point.

1200
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
I know, I think a lot of us are kind of over it.

1201
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Like, you know, I had really, it looked cool at the time, but I kind of don't want to purchase it at this point.

1202
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:30,000
By the time that shit comes out, it's going to be like fuckin' $20, or like, you know, it's going to be in bargain bin at that point.

1203
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Yeah. So, maybe they shouldn't have made that promise? Do you think a lesson learned at Sony? I don't know.

1204
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Maybe they should just put it out for free as a whole game in Playstation Plus, and just wipe the slate clean of that.

1205
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Oh, you think maybe that's the direction things are going? That maybe they're just going to write it off?

1206
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,000
When that shit comes out, it'll be like a year or two before it.

1207
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:56,000
That's certainly a thought, that maybe they're just going to say, you know what, there's not going to be a separate Playstation, it's just releasing it for free.

1208
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Ooh, that would, uh, that might be quite the loss for Sony, though, who knows?

1209
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:07,000
I guess at this point, though, because of all the online downtime and all that stuff, I guess, can it really get any worse?

1210
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Then again, if you open it up to all the Playstation Plus users at the same time, yes, it probably could get worse, actually, so I don't know.

1211
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Well, you're going to open it up to Playstation Plus users anyways.

1212
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Yeah, that's true.

1213
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:27,000
YYR is pointing out on the counterpoint, Xbox is getting a free version of Forza next week, not just for gold members, but for everyone.

1214
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Exactly, and I want to download that, because I like Forza.

1215
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
That's the Fast and Furious one, right?

1216
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Yeah, I'm down with that, seriously.

1217
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Alright, well, moving on, Bloodborne was a game that we talked all about in our releases for next week.

1218
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:52,000
What if I told you you could buy Bloodborne with actual blood? Sorry, that is not the blood of your enemies, but maybe you're figuring out here.

1219
01:31:53,000 --> 01:32:00,000
This is actually just happening in Denmark, so unless you happen to live there, which I do not know if we have any folks from Denmark listening to the show, but if we do, hello.

1220
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:11,000
And if you happen to be near the University of Copenhagen, you can donate blood for a chance of getting a free copy of Bloodborne. Sorry, it's not guaranteed.

1221
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:13,000
That's lame.

1222
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Donating blood's not lame, but that's lame.

1223
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:24,000
That actually isn't the first time it's been done. There were blood drives, and I used to do some SEO work, some search engine optimization.

1224
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:37,000
And I remember reading in my searches that there was a tournament, I believe, in Australia where they gave blood and then had a chance to preview a game that came out, like some battle game or something.

1225
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
But it's not the first time something like this has been done.

1226
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Yeah. So what happens, you're going to give blood and you roll a die to see if you've won a copy of the game or another PlayStation 4 game.

1227
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Everyone who gives blood, they get entered into a contest to win a Bloodborne-themed PlayStation 4 console. So there it is.

1228
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Also very interesting about this, just on another note, because this isn't just about the fact that they're giving this away, but Give Blood, which is the organization that's putting this together in Denmark,

1229
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:14,000
they said that this blood drive is significant because male blood donors are rare in Denmark.

1230
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:26,000
So they're trying to do this to get more, presumably, young males and females, let's not forget ladies play games too, but it's going to get both in there donating some blood.

1231
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:39,000
There's also a reference here to when Canadians tried something on Kickstarter called Bloodsport, which was an Xbox 360 gamepad that also would collect blood when the gamepad rumbled or vibrated.

1232
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,000
That might be a bit much.

1233
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Anyhow, there you go. So Bloodborne, if you're in Denmark, you might be able to win if you're lucky with the dice and giving blood, and maybe you didn't know that they need more male blood in Denmark.

1234
01:33:54,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Alright, let's take a time to visit a classic moment in gaming's past, back when machines weren't actually taking blood from you as you played video games on them.

1235
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:11,000
But maybe if you gripped them a little too tight, they'd leave a bruise.

1236
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:19,000
It's the Classic Game of the Week where DarkSakura is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, this is worthy of your attention as a classic title of the week.

1237
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:25,000
And remember, just a reminder this week, a Classic Game of the Week must be a game that is 10 years old or more.

1238
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
And this game hit 10 years old this month.

1239
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
And this is going to be one of those games where you're like, I am old.

1240
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:36,000
I think it's also the first one on the system that started on the system that I have done.

1241
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Well then here it is, DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

1242
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Luminesse. Yes, Luminesse is 10 years old.

1243
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:55,000
It is a puzzle video game based on light patterns and sound that was created by Tetsuya Mizuguchi and Q Entertainment, which we have brought up earlier in the show.

1244
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
And it was a launch title for the PlayStation Portable.

1245
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:06,000
It came out in Japan on December 12, 2004 and released in North America on March 23, 2005.

1246
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
It later had a European release on September 1, 2005.

1247
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:18,000
It has sold over half a million units as of October 11, 2005 in Japan.

1248
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:25,000
And in Europe 180,000 since it was released in September 2005.

1249
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:30,000
North America about 300,000 and that's just as of October.

1250
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:34,000
That same year. It sold a lot and it sold quickly.

1251
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Basically Gameloft said that they would be bringing both Meteos and Luminesse to cell phones.

1252
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:46,000
So we have Luminesse Mobile that came out on March 1, 2006, which I played a decent amount of.

1253
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:53,000
It also had a PS2 port in Europe and in North America Luminesse Plus.

1254
01:35:54,000 --> 01:36:01,000
And on the PC it was released by, I'm sorry, it was released on the Wild Games platform and then on Steam in 2008.

1255
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:08,000
In 2009 Luminesse Touch was released for iOS and it had four sequels.

1256
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Luminesse Live, Luminesse 2, Luminesse Supernova and Luminesse Electronic Symphony.

1257
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
And that was the most recent as of 2012.

1258
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
We had been three years without a Luminesse game. Get to it.

1259
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:27,000
So with this game, one very strong memory I have is that was one of the years we did my birthday at Dave & Buster's.

1260
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,000
And I got to level 24 piss drunk.

1261
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:37,000
I was sitting at the end of the table with my cupcake in front of me, drinking a 25 ounce Guinness.

1262
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,000
I remember this.

1263
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,000
Playing Wendell's version of it.

1264
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,000
And got to level 24.

1265
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Drunk.

1266
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Can I just point out, like, not only is this game 10 years old this month.

1267
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:54,000
This game is 10, in North America anyway, it's actually older than, because in Japan it came out December 2014.

1268
01:36:54,000 --> 01:37:00,000
It is 10 years old today in the U.S. Today is Luminesse's birthday of being released in the U.S.

1269
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
That's my reason for picking it.

1270
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
There you go.

1271
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:09,000
So basically it's a block drop, you know, we've seen stuff like this in Tetris.

1272
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,000
It's a 2x2 square.

1273
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Or as it's also said, an O-Tetromino.

1274
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Made of four smaller block pieces that's dropped from the field.

1275
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:26,000
And it can be different colors if you've got levels or skins, on your level or different skins.

1276
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:31,000
The blocks make up larger blocks which will be of one or two different colors.

1277
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
You can rotate them, realign them, you've got different colors in them.

1278
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:44,000
But once you attach them to other blocks, they will start sharing themselves if you've got one that's going to match on one of those sides.

1279
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:55,000
And then it actually, as you join pieces, and then you emerge more and more of them to a certain amount.

1280
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
So in other words you have to be really fast with that.

1281
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:04,000
It will make a sound that's synchronized with the music that you're listening to.

1282
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:15,000
You also basically, your timeline moves across which is showing you where you are with the music and how the blocks are going.

1283
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:22,000
So you have to basically get as many of them falling during one timeline sweep.

1284
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:29,000
And so when the timeline ends they will match up all the colors they're touching and it will decrease to the bottom.

1285
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Of course when you hit the top of it you end.

1286
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:46,000
You can also get a block with a jewel in the center which will clear as part of the overall block and anything that is horizontally or vertically adjacent to that matched block.

1287
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
And it will be cleared without a score.

1288
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:57,000
So you do have your different skins and your different skins work with, they have different music attached to them in some cases.

1289
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:05,000
And the music and the sound effects are really integral to the game, it's a lot like Rez in that respect.

1290
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Which was another music video game.

1291
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Each skin also changes the rate at which the timeline moves in time with the music and it can make it faster or slower, make it harder to create different, you know, combos.

1292
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Or it can have you, when it slows down, it makes it a lot harder to fill those sweeps going across.

1293
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:29,000
You also have your challenge and your versus CPU mode.

1294
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:36,000
You can play your versus and it's just really, really an awesome game.

1295
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:43,000
So you have, like I said, you've got your four modes, you have challenge, time attack, puzzle versus, and versus CPU mode.

1296
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:51,000
And like I said with the playing against another person you actually do it wirelessly on your PSP.

1297
01:39:52,000 --> 01:40:03,000
So it is, I mean it's one of the best games that has ever been out on PSP. To me it was the reason to have one.

1298
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:16,000
And of course we got more and more, you know, music and skins. I mean we were all obsessed with Shinin right when that song was in the first one.

1299
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Lumines Live, by the way, was included on the cubed compilation on Xbox 360 that included Res HD and Every Extend Extra Extreme.

1300
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:35,000
And it had the Advanced Challenge Pack, the Versus CPU Pack, the Puzzle Mission Pack, Rocket Holiday Pack, and both Genki Rocket skins, Heavenly Star and Breeze.

1301
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:42,000
So the only thing that wasn't included were the Booster Pack and the Tokyo Club Mix Pack, but you could buy them separately.

1302
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:53,000
So, Lumines Supernova was on Playstation Network and it had all of the features of Lumines Live without the online multiplayer.

1303
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,000
And the Sequencer for Lumines 2 and then it had a Dig Down mode.

1304
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Lumines Electronic Symphony was announced in Gamescom 2011 and it was showcased at Tokyo Game Show 2011.

1305
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:14,000
And it's basically just another awesome Lumines game. So there you go, Lumines.

1306
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
There it is, your classic game of the week. Happy 10th birthday, Lumines.

1307
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Although I personally feel Lumines 2 was the superior game, obviously we wouldn't be there without Lumines 1.

1308
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:33,000
And like you said, some of these songs that were in Lumines 1 were unforgettable and didn't end up showing up for the sequel.

1309
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:40,000
And here we are, all these years later, Dark Sakura, and that Madonna skin still hasn't come out for the 360 version of Lumines.

1310
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:49,000
That one E3 will be the only time I ever got to play that Madonna song in Lumines. I guess they were going to expand with all these different songs.

1311
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:56,000
It was going to be like a Jukebox and what was the song? It was Madonna's Sorry. That's what was the song.

1312
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,000
I don't wanna do. It was that song.

1313
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:06,000
Maybe Sorry was just the apology. You can play this once. Sorry, you'll never play this again.

1314
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:13,000
I remember that E3. I got to play Madonna in Lumines at one time, but that'll never happen again.

1315
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Is that the same E3 that I discovered SingStar and started just singing Motorhead for fun?

1316
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:25,000
I believe that would have been the Paris Hilton year. It would have been the 2006 E3, I think.

1317
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
And that was the year that Wii was announced, right?

1318
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
That was the Paris Hilton year.

1319
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:34,000
That was when I was obsessed with singing Motorhead, because I could.

1320
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
You're calling that game system what?

1321
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
The Paris Hilton year?

1322
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Yeah, I remember because that's the year they announced the Wii. It's like, yes.

1323
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Because the revolution was totally not a good name for your system. Let's go with the Wii.

1324
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Yeah, no, I remember that. I remember that.

1325
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Anyhow, we're going to take a break, guys. When we come back, there is plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come.

1326
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:13,000
In fact, we're going to talk about things like the Fugu Question of the Week, some interesting Steam updates, some interesting Windows 10 updates, and more importantly, your calls, your emails, you guys, when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.

1327
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Launch Radio, live tonight with our 591st episode for this March the 22nd of 2015.

1328
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:40,000
We're going to get into the forum follow-up here real quick, but we're chowing down on all these lovely Japanese goodies that AkumaJP sent us in his care package from Japan.

1329
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:47,000
And DarkSakura and I were kind of talking about some of our favorites, and I think hands down that pear chocolate brittle thing is the best.

1330
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
I need like 50,000 more boxes of that. I'm trying to find it.

1331
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
What's your second favorite? The Pretz?

1332
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Probably one of the Melty Kiss that I forgot to bring.

1333
01:43:57,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Oh. Holding out on me, DarkSakura.

1334
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Melty Kiss is one of my favorite Japanese candies.

1335
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:07,000
I would say, and I don't know what flavor this is, maybe if AkumaJP is still in our chat, maybe you can tell me.

1336
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,000
The Topopole?

1337
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
Yeah, the Topopole. I really like that. That's like my second favorite, I think, and I don't know what flavor that is.

1338
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Have to try the Pretz.

1339
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Try the Pretz?

1340
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,000
In the yellow package. Try the Pretz.

1341
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,000
Okay, I will. I will try the Pretz next. Maybe that'll be my new favorite.

1342
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:28,000
But I need to get to our forum follow-up. We're going to go to our forums over at vognetwork.com where we do some follow-up topics from the show the week before.

1343
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Over on the forums, we have a couple topics this week. I wanted to start with what was a very popular issue on our show last week.

1344
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:46,000
They got a lot of people talking because, you know, our show is rooted in music gaming.

1345
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:57,000
So a lot of people were talking about the Bomani issue and why suddenly the cease and desists were going out to this network that was allowing the BeatMania 2DX machines and so forth to run.

1346
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,000
So a lot of countries outside of Japan.

1347
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:04,000
So Dark Tetsuya responded to a post that I made over there saying,

1348
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:09,000
I did hear that on their registration site for the EMU's network that you can register an account if you live in the U.S.

1349
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Personally, I'm hoping that round one will expand even further in the coming months and years.

1350
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Or at the very least, this means that Konami will officially launch a worldwide version of the EMU's network.

1351
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:28,000
I do find it odd that we've had the Japanese-Korean bootleg DDR machines in this country for the past 15 years or so and they just look the other way.

1352
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:35,000
But now they take issue with it, I do really hope it has to do with them wanting to launch EMU's over on this side of the world.

1353
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:41,000
And one interesting note on the streaming video as far as region locking is concerned, YouTube does do that sometimes.

1354
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Last week I talked about how region locking is really done with and you know, it's silly that we have all this region locking when the internet makes everything global.

1355
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:55,000
And Dark Tetsuya reminded me, YouTube does this a lot where they block things.

1356
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:03,000
I think mainly for certain music videos in other countries, but I don't think that makes your point any less valid since there's ways to get around that too.

1357
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:11,000
YYR replied and said, so basically Konami's global EMU's service launched on the 19th.

1358
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
It looks more or less the same as before, but with the following changes.

1359
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:18,000
The site was semi-translated a little, most of the text is in Japanese.

1360
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:24,000
You can now register a Konami ID in many more countries, including the USA as Dark Tetsuya mentioned.

1361
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
And that's it. Other than that, no changes or announcement.

1362
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:34,000
It appears that for the moment there is no change as far as the service actually being offered in more locations, but we'll see what happens in the days to come.

1363
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Rob, I really like your idea about the 30 to 50 mile radius, thank you.

1364
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:44,000
I think it's pretty damn fair, but if round one is currently paying to be exclusive, I don't know that their minds can be changed.

1365
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Anyway, the site where the most current music gamers convene these days produced this, and I saw this floating around Facebook and I'm sure many of you did too.

1366
01:46:53,000 --> 01:47:01,000
It looks like a PowerPoint presentation, it says Konami Internal Use Only, and it's titled 2015 Strategy and Planning, and the bullet points go like this.

1367
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Fuck Hideo Kojima, fuck Metal Gear, fuck Silent Hill, fuck it, and fuck you.

1368
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Oh, you guys.

1369
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Then we had a user-started topic, thank you Flocko Jones for participating in the forums this week over at vognetwork.com, saying that listening to the classic Game of the Week segment, I couldn't help but wonder if the reason that Jones and the Fast Lane got a lot of jokes thrown its way might have been because of when it was released and where we are now in gaming.

1370
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:34,000
I know a lot of those CD-ROM games can be an acquired taste, and it got me thinking about games that don't hold up.

1371
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Now, I can't judge Jones having never played it, but as far as games I used to love that don't quite hold up, the first game that came to mind is Syphon Filter.

1372
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:49,000
I used to love this game and spent a lot of time attempting the stealth missions on my roommate's PlayStation 1.

1373
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:54,000
I downloaded it on PlayStation 3 when it became available to play there, and I found it to be a mess.

1374
01:47:55,000 --> 01:48:03,000
The camera bugged me, the controls weren't great, and the voice acting and story were bad, especially compared to Metal Gear Solid, which came from about the same time period and still holds up pretty well.

1375
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:08,000
So, is there an old game you love that doesn't quite hold up anymore?

1376
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
I'm going to come around and ask in a moment. Let me finish up on the forums, though.

1377
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:18,000
I do want to point out Bobby not happy with what happened to the discussions last week, because I know he was a big fan of Jones and the Fast Lane.

1378
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Live radio, folks, it's unpredictable.

1379
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:30,000
And Bobby saying, you know, Jones does hold up and was not happy with the way the game was portrayed on the show, which is fair. It is what it is.

1380
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:47,000
And, you know, I did kind of, I did want to say, though, that, you know, in part of my response, I do think there are some elements of Jones that are a little dated, because some of that puns and some of the things it does is an acquired taste.

1381
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:59,000
And the fact that, and I think Flacco hit on it in his first message, it was a CD-ROM based game, and it was really a genre you didn't expect to see that CD-ROM and full motion thing in.

1382
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,000
And I think that's what made it an easy target for jokes last week.

1383
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:12,000
But I think also as part of the reason why, you know, when you kind of get acquired to that and you see that for the first time when you're 12 or you're 13 or you're a kid, you look at that and you go, oh my God, that's so cool.

1384
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:19,000
And that's part of the reason why I loved it personally myself, but I ended with this disclaimer and I really do feel this way.

1385
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:28,000
Any classic game we have here that's more obscure than a Final Fantasy or a Mario, go check it out. Draw your own conclusions.

1386
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Of course, try to do it legally wherever possible, just saying.

1387
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:43,000
I did also give two examples on this, and two examples that I gave was Anticipation, which I also got some giggles on the show previously with the heels, but I mean, it makes sense.

1388
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:51,000
But like 20 years later, I don't even have to see the drawing. If I see the dots, I know what the damn puzzle is. I don't even need to see it anymore.

1389
01:49:51,000 --> 01:50:01,000
So there's that. And then I didn't mean to pick on Rare, but I also thought about Pinbot, and I've talked a lot about how much I love that game on the NES, and I still do.

1390
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:07,000
But if you really think about it, it was kind of like the way they did the view in that game was kind of jank.

1391
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:20,000
And the fact that they really changed the table to add all these weird monsters that come out and things, it's actually not really that cool in retrospect.

1392
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:29,000
That now you can download something like Pinball Arcade, you can actually get a full recreation of the actual table, and it kind of doesn't hold up in retrospect to that.

1393
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,000
However, YYR responded to me, talking about Pinbot, saying,

1394
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:46,000
Pinbot was as awesome of a pinball table recreation as possible on the NES. Since playing it as a kid, I've played the actual table and now I own the pinball arcade rendition, but I wouldn't have been as familiar with either one without the time I spent with Rare's NES version.

1395
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Knowing the rules going in really helped, and I enjoyed the real deal a lot more than I possibly would have otherwise.

1396
01:50:54,000 --> 01:51:00,000
I know you guys might want to answer Flaco's question, what is a game that you loved that doesn't really hold up? Dark Sakura.

1397
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Loom.

1398
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Yeah, you know what's funny? Good old games, I think, started selling a lot of those LucasArts games this week.

1399
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,000
Steam has it as well.

1400
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Yeah, but that encouraged a discussion on Facebook, where a friend and I were talking about Loom, and he was saying,

1401
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:21,000
yeah, for those two hours you play Loom, you'll have a good time. It's not a very long game.

1402
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Possibly even Phantasmagoria.

1403
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Oh, really?

1404
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:26,000
Or the original Myst.

1405
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Yeah, and that's tough to hear because Phantasmagoria, my God, that game was so awesome and, you know, nothing but love for Roberta Williams, but a lot of those CD-ROM games in general, they're rough to see now.

1406
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:45,000
It's dated and hard to watch, but still, I mean, it makes it no less of a fun game, but you really have to put all of that aside.

1407
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Modern sensibilities need to check at the door.

1408
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:55,000
You have to look at it through the lens of 1995 when this game came out. Loki, anything come to mind for you?

1409
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:03,000
I can't really think of anything, although one game that is kind of giggle-worthy, I guess, is Omega Boost. I don't know if you remember that.

1410
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:05,000
I don't.

1411
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,000
I remember Omega Boost.

1412
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,000
It's got music that doesn't really fit the game, but it's pretty awesome.

1413
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:24,000
It's just, you know, that might not hold up now. I can't really think of a lot of stuff because, you know, a lot of games I played were just, like, classic games on, like, the NES and stuff that still, I think, hold up pretty well.

1414
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Maybe Mega Race, that game. Well, that's like a first-generation CD-ROM game.

1415
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Oh, that's a great CD-ROM example. Mega Race. I think that would be really hard to play today.

1416
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Oh, yeah, if you could even get the run. It's just, like, very...

1417
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:39,000
That's a good one. That's a really good one.

1418
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
That'd be worth remaking, I think, but, yeah.

1419
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Awesome. Alright, some good choices. It's interesting that a lot of these choices are all that CD-ROM game era that I think, you know, and again, back to Flacco's original point, I think just games from that era, when you have today's technology, are kind of rough to watch.

1420
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,000
So what about, uh...

1421
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:06,000
What about SimCity? SimCity Action News is the best version of that game they ever made. It was, uh, you guys, it's a hurricane.

1422
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Oh, man. Has somebody... Surely there's, like, a Kickstarter out there where somebody's trying to make, like, an old-school CD-ROM game. Just like you remember.

1423
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Um, no, not necessarily that, but that studio that did, um, Roundabout and stuff like that, they tried to do, like, the full-motion video type stuff that's cheesy like that.

1424
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:31,000
So, um, they did that with, um, Gun Stringer and then, um, with Roundabout, so...

1425
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:33,000
That's right, that's right, I remember that.

1426
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Uh, Hitstun pointing out that the Good Old Games version of Mega Race is actually really nice as far as full-motion video games go.

1427
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Ooh, maybe you have to pick that up.

1428
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,000
I did not realize Good Old Games had it. That's awesome.

1429
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,000
I may have to pick that up, yeah.

1430
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:56,000
You know, I don't like to make flat-out endorsements like this when I'm not being paid for it, but I just have to say, as somebody who does love the classic games, especially on the PC,

1431
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:04,000
I really gotta tip my hat for Good Old Games, because I feel like it's a real niche thing that they're providing, but I wish more people would check it out, because there's so many...

1432
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:12,000
I wish they had more on it, too. You know, I realize some people are really holding out with some of the licenses and things, but there's a lot of good stuff on there. A lot of good stuff on there.

1433
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:18,000
All right, anyhow, let's do some rapid-fire news and quickly address some other news stories that have come up this week.

1434
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Rapid-fire, low-key.

1435
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Well, there's lots of games that are being redone or made to look nicer for the new generation consoles, starting off with an announcement for God of War 3 being remastered.

1436
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:39,000
It's going to be coming out July 14th, and it's going to feature 1080p gameplay, and they're targeting 60 frames per second.

1437
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Not much more is really known about that, other than it will look slightly better than the PlayStation 3 version, so hooray.

1438
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Then, also, to kind of go along with that, Gravity Rush is coming to PlayStation 4 as well.

1439
01:54:54,000 --> 01:55:03,000
They're going to be remastering that game, which was originally on the Vita, and so that'll be coming to PlayStation 4 sometime in the near future.

1440
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:11,000
And then, last but not least, Codemasters is teasing a new Overlord game, which I kind of was a fan of the Overlord games.

1441
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Never really got around to playing through number two, but number one is pretty awesome.

1442
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,000
It's one of those games where you play the villain, which is kind of nice.

1443
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:31,000
So, they tweeted a picture of the Overlord helmet, so maybe that'll be an announcement at E3.

1444
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Alright, it's going to be an exciting E3 this year, we'll see.

1445
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:43,000
I mentioned earlier in the show during my gaming week that I was stepping it up on Diablo 3 with my hardcore character, because I had to finish it.

1446
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:48,000
Because it was announced this week that season two in Diablo 3 will be ending soon.

1447
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:53,000
Season will be ending the first week of April, I believe.

1448
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:59,000
I thought I had the exact date here, but it is not here. Maybe somebody in chat will shout it out.

1449
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,000
It's not on the page I'm looking at.

1450
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Oh no, here it is. Season two ends Sunday, April 5th at 9pm. So that is the season two end date in North America.

1451
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Very interesting, because this season went by a lot faster than season one did.

1452
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Season one lasted a good four or five months. Season two, this means it lasted about two months.

1453
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:25,000
So I think Blizzard's trying to find that balance on, do people like the fast seasons, or do people like the slow seasons?

1454
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Or if judging from a lot of gamers out on Twitter are accurate, people aren't happy either way, no matter what you do.

1455
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,000
That sounds more like it.

1456
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
I like the fast seasons personally. I think that's the way to go.

1457
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Because the fast season means we're getting a patch really soon, and I think that's a good thing.

1458
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,000
So I say more fast seasons.

1459
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Microsoft denying that a Gears of War collection is happening.

1460
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Sorry, I know on the heels of the Halo collection a lot of you are hoping for a Gears of War collection.

1461
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:56,000
But Black Tusk Studios manager Rod Ferguson says on Twitter, quote,

1462
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:03,000
I love the passion, but there's no Marcus Fenix collection. We are working on other exciting Gears projects.

1463
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:05,000
I'll see you at E3.

1464
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:09,000
And then he slapped in the entirety of Twitter with a two by four to the face.

1465
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Because, I mean, doesn't that kind of scream that they're going to announce something Gears related at E3?

1466
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,000
So, anyhow, there you go.

1467
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Gears of War, of course, went to development at Black Tusk for Xbox One.

1468
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:27,000
As you know, Cliffy B is doing new stuff now. What is this new studio? Blue something something?

1469
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,000
I don't know what it's called.

1470
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Anyhow.

1471
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:38,000
He's got that sketch combat game that looks like a bunch of pencil sketches.

1472
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Yes, yes.

1473
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:48,000
You know what? This is not the popular opinion I totally realized, but I did not think Halo 4 was bad at all.

1474
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:54,000
In fact, I thought Halo 4 was probably much better than Halo 3 or any of the variety of spinoffs that came out after it.

1475
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
And that was when it was in new studio's hands.

1476
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:03,000
So, you know what? Sometimes that fresh blood can kind of invigorate an old IP.

1477
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:07,000
Which, not to get too in depth, because I probably should have mentioned this earlier,

1478
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:14,000
but when Jamie was talking about Hideo Kojima and leaving Metal Gear and kind of talked about the Castlevania thing

1479
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
and can they do a new Castlevania without Itagaki, well, why not?

1480
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:25,000
They did a Halo without Bungie, and even though not everybody was a fan, I thought it was a pretty solid Halo game.

1481
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,000
So, we'll see. Anyway.

1482
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:33,000
And nassengames in chat at live.vognetwork.com agrees with me.

1483
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:39,000
Halo 4 was the one Halo game I beat multiple times. I genuinely enjoyed that game.

1484
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Anyhow, the ZX Spectrum. What a throwback, right? Back to the 80's computer days, the ZX Spectrum.

1485
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:54,000
Well, you can also throwback to this. There is a new ZX Spectrum keyboard that has come out.

1486
01:58:54,000 --> 01:59:01,000
It's the recreated Sinclair ZX Spectrum. It's a keyboard for tablets. So that's kind of neat.

1487
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:03,000
It's kind of weird.

1488
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Yeah, well, it's kind of neat though. All it is, it's a Bluetooth keyboard and you can actually put it with a tablet.

1489
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:17,000
And so I guess you can actually get this Sinclair app for your iPad or whatever, and then you can actually hook it up with this keyboard.

1490
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:22,000
And it's just like having the old stinkin' Sinclair, which is pretty cool. So, you know, if you were a fan of that.

1491
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:28,000
I wonder then if that would work to project it to an Apple TV so that you can play it on the big screen.

1492
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:34,000
You know what, and they show in this somebody playing Spectrum on the TV, so I bet you that's exactly what they're doing. That's a very good thought.

1493
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:38,000
If you've got an Apple TV, you can play your iOS games.

1494
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Yeah, and they just have that price reduction. Although, I'm crossing my fingers and my toes. There's rumors that there'll be a new one soon, so I'm gonna see what happens. We'll see.

1495
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Alright, Dark Soccer, you have some other rapid-fire news for us.

1496
01:59:52,000 --> 02:00:00,000
I do. Squeenix, the president, Yosuke Matsuda, said that there is going to be a box of surprises for 2015.

1497
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:06,000
They have a considerable amount of high-end games. That's a quote from both inside and outside the country.

1498
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:11,000
And this was for a Nikkei interview, so he was referring to Japan, of course.

1499
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:16,000
We've got Final Fantasy XV is the start of it, but then this is a quote.

1500
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:24,000
I think we'll have a little surprise too, a JRPG for home game machines. So, who knows?

1501
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Next up, PlayStation Now has a closed beta that starts this spring in the UK.

1502
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:37,000
Plus, members are going to be among the first to use it, but they will have to register to get in on the beta.

1503
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:42,000
And I found a typo on the article. That was professional.

1504
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:53,000
It will be available on PS4 only, and PS Now is going to initially be free, but the later stages are going to have trial rental periods and pricing models to go out.

1505
02:00:54,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Games included in the closed beta are Dirt 3, Far Cry 3, Blood Dragon, God of War Ascension, Just Cause 2, Rayman Legends, Saints Row the Third, The Full Package, The Last of Us, The Walking Dead, and Uncharted 2 Among Thieves.

1506
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:19,000
And then, and this is really cool, there is a machine out called Smash-A-Ball, and it's meant to improve the memory and spatial awareness for blind kids.

1507
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Basically, they have audio clues and different type of tactile stimuli that let them choose the right one.

1508
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:34,000
It's sort of like, for lack of a better description, blind whack-a-mole.

1509
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:46,000
The team that's developing it is trying to raise £100,000 or $148,000 on Kickstarter so that it can go into production.

1510
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:52,000
And if you pledge at least £180 or $267, you can get one of your own.

1511
02:01:53,000 --> 02:02:00,000
But, you know, you can also contribute £50 and get other friends to do the same.

1512
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:11,000
And then, for everyone who pledges £50, the team will give a set to a blind child who needs it.

1513
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:24,000
So, I would say definitely hop on Kickstarter and search for this device. It's called Smash-A-Ball.

1514
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:38,000
And right now, their US goal, like I said, about $150,383, they've hit $17,000 of it right now. 25 backers, 16 days to go.

1515
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:42,000
That's awesome. I'm glad we could bring a little light to that subject.

1516
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
The video for it is pretty cool.

1517
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Alright. Let's get to the FUGL question of the week, you guys.

1518
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:53,000
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities.

1519
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Yes, Google Plus is still there. For now, I guess I heard Google Plus is going to change.

1520
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Now it's like Google Streams or something because, you know, I don't know.

1521
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:05,000
But anyway, for now, I'm still calling it Google Plus until a different name shows up.

1522
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
But you get the FUGL question of the week.

1523
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Thank God I didn't call it like the fluss segment of the week or I would have had to change the name, but Google should still work, right?

1524
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:25,000
The fellow.

1525
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Alright, this week, very simple question of the week. It's similar to our kickoff topic tonight because all I did is I said,

1526
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
I'm going to just leave this right here and ask for your thoughts.

1527
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:40,000
And I posted the trailer for the Pixels movie that we talked about at the top of the show.

1528
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:44,000
So I just want to know your thoughts, folks, on the Pixels trailer we saw at the top of the show.

1529
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
So over on Facebook, Surping Slurpee says,

1530
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:52,000
The movie seems like shameless pandering to gamers just like Chuck and Larry was pandering to the gay community.

1531
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:56,000
And let's face it, Adam Sandler hasn't made a decent movie in 10 years.

1532
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Gonna wait till it's at Red Box.

1533
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:00,000
It's pretty harsh.

1534
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:08,000
I totally forgot that the Chuck and Larry thing was a thing because I remember seeing that trailer and my eyes rolled back so far I could see my fucking brain.

1535
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,000
Just saying.

1536
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:11,000
Red the Haze says,

1537
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Looks interesting and would watch it but not pay any money for it.

1538
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Yo ho yo ho.

1539
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Fifth Dream says,

1540
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:25,000
I saw the trailer on TV the other night. At first I was kind of intrigued. Wonder what this could possibly be.

1541
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Then I saw Adam Sandler and realized it would be a total piece of crap.

1542
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:35,000
I won't even bother watching it unless someone else pays for a rental and then it would just be to see if I'm right about how dumb it really is.

1543
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:36,000
Andy R says,

1544
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Looks kind of dumb and pandering but I might see it anyway just to get some of that sweet cinema popcorn.

1545
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:44,000
That's a great reason.

1546
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,000
Critical Myth says,

1547
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:50,000
It would make a fine sketch or short but how are they going to sustain this for an entire film?

1548
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Cial says,

1549
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:54,000
I'll keep my expectations low and wait for it to come on TV.

1550
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Tiger Claw says,

1551
02:04:57,000 --> 02:05:01,000
I think it looks like it could be a fun movie. I love the idea of aliens using video games as weapons of mass destruction.

1552
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Something we all take for granted because in video games you never worry about the repercussions because it's never real.

1553
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Only this time the video games become real and are out to kill us all.

1554
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:14,000
So I see a bit of irony in this. The things we took for granted could be our end.

1555
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:20,000
This film combines one of my favorite genres, the alien invasion, but with video games instead of spaceships.

1556
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
And Bryce H. I think sums it all up saying,

1557
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:27,000
It looks like a great movie. Just wish it wasn't Adam Sandler.

1558
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:33,000
Let's go to Google Plus, however, and check out some of the answers there. We actually had a few answers over there.

1559
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Dustin B. says,

1560
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
I'll watch it. It looks awesome. I grew up on these games and I'm glad when they get the movie treatment.

1561
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:42,000
I went to see Wreck-It Ralph after all even though I didn't have much interest in the show otherwise.

1562
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:46,000
I don't get people calling this a train wreck before they even have a chance to see it.

1563
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Ruttertainment says,

1564
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:52,000
It's a movie produced by Happy Madison Productions so my dad is going to love this.

1565
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:54,000
My dad has really bad taste.

1566
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Facepalm.

1567
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Adam Sandler movies, or at least some of his earlier work, but this movie is total utter crap.

1568
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
They meet a Futurama seven minute short into a full length movie.

1569
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,000
It's going to suck no matter what.

1570
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
I'd rather watch Wreck-It Ralph than this train wreck of a movie.

1571
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:12,000
And the Toro Iwatani nod is just plain fucking stupid and not funny.

1572
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Ooh, some harsh language from Act Deaf. I'm going to put some soap in your mouth.

1573
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Josh Y. replied and said,

1574
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:22,000
For a big dumb summer movie, I'd probably watch it, subject to reviews.

1575
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Seems rather heavy on fan service though.

1576
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:26,000
And lastly, CyberJudge says,

1577
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Some of his movies I enjoyed, others I was not so impressed.

1578
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:34,000
That being said, a movie that has video games in it will at least get me to rent the movie.

1579
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
If reviews come out strong, I may go to the theater to watch it.

1580
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:42,000
Thank you to our Google Plus and Facebook communities for answering our question this week.

1581
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Appreciate it.

1582
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:48,000
We already shared our thoughts earlier in the show, so we're a little behind on time.

1583
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
I want to make sure we have time to get in your calls, so we'll get back into the news.

1584
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,000
So, Loki, let's do some news.

1585
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Alright, sounds good.

1586
02:06:55,000 --> 02:07:00,000
So, yeah, they finally, well it didn't take that long because they just announced the first character last week.

1587
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:09,000
But they announced all four characters that will be a part of the combat pack that's available for Mortal Kombat X.

1588
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:15,000
And the pack will run you thirty dollars for four characters.

1589
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Thirty, really, thirty fucking dollars for four characters.

1590
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Okay, and that's basically the season pass.

1591
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Well aren't they, they're throwing in some skins as well.

1592
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Whoo! Skins! Oh, mime is sick. That's totally worth it then.

1593
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:38,000
Okay, anyways, so they already announced Jason Vorhees as a playable character last week.

1594
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
Also, Tanya, Tremor.

1595
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:43,000
I love Tanya in four.

1596
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:50,000
Yeah, Tremor, and then the new character that everyone's getting their panties in a bunch about, the Predator.

1597
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Okay, that's kind of cool though. I mean, I can't hate on that.

1598
02:07:55,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Is that, do you think maybe that's why this is so expensive, is because maybe it cost them an arm and a leg, literally, ha, Mortal Kombat, get it?

1599
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:07,000
To license Jason and Predator for this, so maybe this is how they recoup that money?

1600
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:13,000
This is about what they charge for season passes, twenty or thirty dollars, and so, I don't know.

1601
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Dark Sakura, curious on your thoughts on being able to play as the Predator in Mortal Kombat X. Any interest at all?

1602
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:23,000
Only interesting if we get the alien.

1603
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:31,000
There, like in a later pack, we'll get the alien. I wish they'd bring back Freddy Krueger too, like, they could all throw down.

1604
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Here's my thing, it's like, if you don't give a shit about certain characters and that, just don't buy the season pass and buy them a la carte.

1605
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:47,000
But, at the same time, it's really expensive for each individual character. You gotta imagine that, you know, that's at least, it's not gonna be an even thirty dollars for that.

1606
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:52,000
It's not gonna be seven fifty per download, it's gonna be maybe a little bit more than that, like ten dollars or something.

1607
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:59,000
That's ridiculous for a single character. And, ooh, and skins. Oh, my mistake. I forgot about the skins.

1608
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:05,000
Kaijuto says, Jason and no Freddy? Predator and no alien? Lame shit.

1609
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Fifth Dream says, is Jason gonna walk really slow? Cause that won't fit in, and if he doesn't, he's wrong.

1610
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:18,000
Let's see, ActDeft agrees, licenses cost money, and Predator too.

1611
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
Bonds006 says, Fox Entertainment need that money.

1612
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:30,000
I can't imagine licenses don't play into it somehow, but you are right in that, okay, they're charging the same for Jason that they would for Tanya.

1613
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:38,000
And, you know, Tanya isn't gonna cost a bunch in licensing, cause that's their character. So, it is a little bit, hmm, I don't know.

1614
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:44,000
And that's the character, I want Tanya most of all, I'm telling you, that's the character I played, like, all the time.

1615
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
I loved her fatality where she jumped up on the guy's head and then went.

1616
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
I just, I don't care.

1617
02:09:51,000 --> 02:10:02,000
Yeah, and I just will say, my concerns about Mortal Kombat X, again, like, I'm all for, like, cartoony violence, and I thought the old Mortal Kombat games were so over the top and stupid and great.

1618
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:10,000
But, like, as the graphics get better, I actually get a little more squeamish at some of the stuff I've seen coming out of the Mortal Kombat games.

1619
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:19,000
And I'm like, is this, is this now going, cause I've told you guys before, I do not like the Saw movies and things that are just, like, the gore fest, like, I'm not here for that.

1620
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:33,000
So, I'm getting a little worried that Mortal Kombat might become a little too much. However, I do still feel my duty to the internet to buy Mortal Kombat X and make my mother play it and get her reaction.

1621
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:43,000
That is, I do feel like that is my destiny and what needs to happen. So, for you, internet, I will. For you, I will.

1622
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
The sacrifices you make.

1623
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:48,000
That's right, the sacrifices I make.

1624
02:10:49,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Moving on. Talking about an update on Steam. A subscriber agreement went out for Steam. Now, if you are a user of Steam, as more and more, I guess, promotional opportunities and broadcast opportunities come up on Steam, such as the Curators List and Steam Broadcasting come up, there's opportunities that users might be getting paid to give favorable mentions to companies.

1625
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:24,000
So, as part of the Steam subscriber agreement that you're now agreeing to, you will need to disclose if you're being paid to promote a product on the service.

1626
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:31,000
This means if there's been a monetary exchange, this also means a free game key or physical goods.

1627
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:49,000
Quote, if you use Steam services, like this Curators List or the Broadcasting Service, to promote or endorse a product, service, or event in return for any kind of consideration from a third party, including non-monetary rewards like free games, you must clearly indicate the source of such consideration to your audience.

1628
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:56,000
You can find this in Section 6, Paragraph C of the new Steam subscriber agreement. So, I keep in everything.

1629
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Nice. I like that.

1630
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:10,000
It's one of those things where I'm like, you should be doing it anyway, Steam shouldn't have to tell you to do it, but I understand the need. Now, my question is, how do you enforce it?

1631
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:16,000
The users will enforce it. They catch somebody, they'll point it out.

1632
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:22,000
We'll see. We'll see. So, there you go. Moving on, DarkSakura.

1633
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:33,000
Well, this is actually pretty cool. Bungie is putting in a colorblind mode in Destiny's next update. It's the 1.1.2 update.

1634
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:40,000
And so, it will also add the ability to play your own music, adjust your teammate's chat volume, or mute the soundtrack.

1635
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:46,000
But the colorblind mode is letting other players see the game better.

1636
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:52,000
You know, the community manager is like, we don't all see the world the same way to provide a better solution. We increase the contrast between colors.

1637
02:12:53,000 --> 02:13:00,000
We do have it in the perceived palette. So, basically, they're just really working on making it to where it's going to be an easier game for others to play.

1638
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:10,000
That being said, I actually watched this little video circulating around Facebook where they've created glasses that allow colorblind people to see color.

1639
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:12,000
I saw that.

1640
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:14,000
And I wonder how that works with a game.

1641
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Good question.

1642
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:24,000
So, I mean, this is really good, but I wonder then if we're not going to see those glasses become more mainstream and this not be a need.

1643
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Still good of them to consider the colorblind.

1644
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Absolutely. You know, and just in general, there's been a lot of good news for accessibility in gaming.

1645
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Like, World of Warcraft just did something almost exactly like this about a month ago where they put in a patch that really lets you adjust colors.

1646
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:44,000
So that, you know, colorblind folks can have the world be a little more tailored for accessibility purposes.

1647
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:54,000
And then, of course, we've talked about the upcoming PlayStation update where it's not color so much, but button mapping will be a part of the system firmware.

1648
02:13:55,000 --> 02:14:00,000
So that way, even if a game neglects to do button remapping, you can override it in the PlayStation 4 firmware.

1649
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:02,000
And I think that's awesome.

1650
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Because how many times have we sat here going, this game would be a lot better if you could just remap the buttons to something that makes a little more sense.

1651
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Or I've had it where game pads will break slightly and it's like, oh, my L3s or R3s not working or something like that, you know, and I really wish I could map this to something else.

1652
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:30,000
You know, last month on the show, it was a few weeks ago on the show, I gave that Qbert game, the Qbert rebooted on PlayStation 4, I gave it a lot of shit.

1653
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Because it controlled like ass and I still believe that and I said it in the review I did at VOG.

1654
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:48,000
But, you know, if on the PlayStation 4 firmware, I'm going to be able to turn the hops into using buttons instead, like I just would use the buttons and for the left and right use L1 and R1.

1655
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:53,000
I actually think that game could be playable. I don't think it would necessarily make it good.

1656
02:14:53,000 --> 02:15:00,000
It's not going to fix all the problems that that game had, but at least I wouldn't like want to give up after literally one minute of playing it.

1657
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:08,000
So that'll be kind of cool. But anyway, I digress a little bit. But I think these accessibility things are really, really cool.

1658
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:15,000
Hitstun in our chat room says, I want to update my VOG jam game to include button mapping. You should do it.

1659
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:26,000
You should do it. I don't think Bobby would take issue to you updating the file at VOG network. If he does, then he's being a meanie mean and he's holding that Jones in the fast lane thing against me far too long.

1660
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:37,000
Hitstun also says AbleGamers has great guidelines for developers to make stuff accessible. Rule number one, let people remap the buttons. Very good. Very good.

1661
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:48,000
Dungeon Buster says, I don't think I've been back on Destiny for a few months or so now. You know, it's interesting. I was thinking about it when I was putting together today's show role and saw that this was something Jamie wanted to talk about on the show.

1662
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:54,000
It kind of did make me go, I do need to go check out what's changed to Destiny.

1663
02:15:55,000 --> 02:16:00,000
I need to play it since I have it and I have not played it yet. That and Watch Dogs.

1664
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Yeah, I would play Destiny with you if you're curious about it.

1665
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:06,000
I need to stop buying games.

1666
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:13,000
Last but not least, I love this comment from Act F. This is by far the most important thing about the update with the music changing.

1667
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Act F says, finally, we can now play the moon theme from DuckTales when playing on the moon in Destiny.

1668
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:30,000
Yes, sir, you are correct. Perfect answer. Best news. More important than anything else. Okay, maybe not anything else.

1669
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Loki, what do you have for us?

1670
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Alright, so, you know, a lot of people may be running Windows on their PCs of choice.

1671
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:46,000
A lot of them also may be running not so legit copies of Windows.

1672
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:55,000
However, Microsoft is kind of okay with that currently as far as the upgrades to Windows 10 since those will be free.

1673
02:16:55,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Basically saying, we're excited to launch Windows 10 this summer and anyone with a qualified device can upgrade Windows 10, including those with pirated copies of Windows.

1674
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:13,000
We believe that the customer over time will realize the value of properly licensing Windows and we will make it easy for them to move to legitimate copies.

1675
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:23,000
So that's kind of nice. I wonder what that means necessarily as far as like limitations and stuff like that or if it's just going to work and they're like, well, you'll just pay us when you feel like it.

1676
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:26,000
Whereas the last two iterations of OS 10 have been free.

1677
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:31,000
Well, and I think that's put pressure. I think that's probably exactly the reason why.

1678
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Linux is free.

1679
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Yeah, I think Microsoft had to reevaluate their model because all their competition is making money by having free operating systems.

1680
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:53,000
So to be fair, though, Windows doesn't necessarily force obsolete, you know, force systems to become obsolete when you upgrade or can't upgrade to future versions of OS X or iOS.

1681
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:04,000
Well, we'll see. We'll see what develops with this. I don't know. But free. You know what? Who's going to complain about free? I'm not.

1682
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:17,000
And the best part about it, it's also coming in the summer. So look forward to an update, I guess, later on this year. And it'll be free for anybody that has Windows 7 or Windows 8.1.

1683
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:29,000
Now YYR wants to point out, this is not news. Copies of Windows 7 and Windows 8 that are currently not activated will still not be activated after the upgrade and this will not change their genuine status.

1684
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:39,000
Dungeon Buster pointing out it's free forever, but the offer only lasts a year. And so there's some links being given out in chat, which I don't have a lot of time to read all of that right now live on air.

1685
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:45,000
But Dungeon Buster says if you don't upgrade in the year, you will have to pay for a Windows 10 copy.

1686
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
That's stupid. They can always change that, though.

1687
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:59,000
And not that I'm endorsing it, but I'm just saying the reality is, hackers gonna hack. And do you think a year will be enough time for them to figure out how to override whatever locks they're going to...

1688
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:08,000
They've already done it with every single other version of their OS that they've put out, so I don't doubt that this will be hacked as well.

1689
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:18,000
Alright, anyhow, let's move on. We're going to get to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails to participate at orangelaungeradio.com

1690
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:24,000
And DarkSakura dives into the mailbag and pulls out some emails that she believes are worthy of our attention.

1691
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
DarkSakura, what is in ye old mailbag this week?

1692
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
YYR sends sup bitches.

1693
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
Oh, that was back from March 6th. Oops.

1694
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:43,000
Oh, I might have just missed that last week. You know, YYR, you weren't here last week, unfortunately.

1695
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:49,000
YYR did a guest correspondence segment on the show and he did a very good job. And actually, I'm getting a lot of positive feedback to that.

1696
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:59,000
So I'm just going to throw this out there again. If you think you can do a guest correspondence segment and you think we're not covering a story well enough and you want to do the story,

1697
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Send me an email. Talk to me about it. rob at vognetwork.com and we'll try to make it happen. You have to keep it to like 5 or 6 minutes. I can't have you going on for 3 hours about it.

1698
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:12,000
But I really loved what he did last week.

1699
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Only we get to go on for 3 hours.

1700
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
That's right. That's right. Still our show, dammit.

1701
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:19,000
First email comes from Flaco Jones.

1702
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Okay, OLR, here's my cracked out NX console theory.

1703
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:31,000
It's a portable slash console hybrid thing. It looks more like an iPad than a Wii U tablet controller but somehow retains physical buttons.

1704
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:37,000
It plays all the mobile games that they dream up plus also plays traditional games.

1705
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:48,000
You can do that and play all the games solo or for another $60 to $80 you can buy a separate piece of hardware that hooks to your TV and lets you play all the same games but on the TV with friends connecting via controllers.

1706
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:57,000
It works like a reverse Wii U where the bulk of the power is in the handheld not in the device hooked up to the TV.

1707
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:06,000
So that's it. A one stop shop. It's a handheld and home console and it's a tablet all at the same time and all the games are made for one system instead of being spread out among different platforms.

1708
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Maybe they can call it the Nintendo One.

1709
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:14,000
The One's already taken for a console name. I don't know if Nintendo would want to do that.

1710
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:20,000
But the rest of the theory, I could see that. A lot of it makes sense.

1711
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:26,000
You didn't sell me at first because in the back of my mind I'm going Nintendo's not going to give up the living room experience.

1712
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
Nintendo's bread and butter is that living room experience.

1713
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:36,000
But when you talk about the power's in the tablet and you can beam it to a TV there could be a receiver or something.

1714
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Maybe they bundle in or sell something. I really don't think you could sell a Apple TV, a Nintendo TV or whatever.

1715
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:51,000
I don't think you could sell that separately. It would have to be part of that base experience with a low cost or Nintendo's not going to be able to do it.

1716
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
But I like where you're going with it.

1717
02:21:55,000 --> 02:22:01,000
I would like to know more about how Nintendo's going to do online. Maybe buff up Virtual Console a little bit.

1718
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:06,000
But anyway, I like the majority of the theory he's proposing there.

1719
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:15,000
We'll see. It could be anything. Who knew that motion gaming was going to be the thing that Nintendo would do that would do so amazingly well.

1720
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:22,000
And who knew that when they embraced the tablet thing a lot of people wouldn't get it. So we'll see.

1721
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
Was that it or is there more?

1722
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:27,000
One more.

1723
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:31,000
Hello LR. On the subject of PlayStation Mobile ending I'm not too surprised.

1724
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:38,000
Around September 2013 I believe the subscription fee to become a developer went down from $99 to $0.

1725
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:42,000
So I signed up and sold the dev kit and got started trying to put something together.

1726
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:49,000
Everything seemed easy until I needed to draw a texture on the screen. With XNA this was one line of code. Very easy.

1727
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:54,000
I searched the documentation but couldn't find a comparable function in the PlayStation Mobile libraries.

1728
02:22:54,000 --> 02:23:02,000
So I went to the development forums and amidst the why is performance so slow and when is this going to be fixed threads I asked how to draw a texture.

1729
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:11,000
Someone on the team started to explain that in order to do this you need to set up a triangle to draw the texture on and started to explain how to do this in 2D.

1730
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:13,000
And I gave up.

1731
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:19,000
I knew that the team behind Xbox Live Indie Games had already significantly reduced their developer support by that point.

1732
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:27,000
And the PSM developer forums seemed comparably quiet. Had a bad feeling about it and it looks like I was right.

1733
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:31,000
I do however feel very bad for developers who won't be able to sell their work anymore.

1734
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:36,000
Neon FM came up in conversation. The game is a lot of fun.

1735
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
And I've enjoyed playing it but there's one major problem with it.

1736
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:45,000
It has targets that move towards stationary versions of those targets and you have to do something when they overlap.

1737
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:53,000
Konami claims ownership over this gameplay style and Harmonic Snack Division are just two entities that pay royalties to Konami as a result.

1738
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:58,000
I feel like the lawsuit bomb is just waiting to explode and that makes me very sad.

1739
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:06,000
Especially seeing as how they'll probably wait to drop it until Neon FM actually becomes popular and a sequel is about to come out. Freaking Konami.

1740
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:14,000
I don't know if they can still do that though because like we were talking about earlier with the case against Data East and Capcom.

1741
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:21,000
I don't know if you can't really copyright gameplay so I don't know how they would...

1742
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:27,000
I mean I guess they could try bullying you with lawyers and if you agree to pay licensing towards it. I don't know.

1743
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:33,000
Loki asked for a Zelda Maker but I see some problems with it.

1744
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:39,000
Allowing us to create even more of our own scenarios might reduce demand for official Nintendo products.

1745
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:44,000
Also devoted Nintendo fans may run out of amiibos to collect. Disaster!

1746
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:54,000
But here we can fix both of those problems. Nintendo can just release another line of amiibo consisting of all the different Zelda enemy characters.

1747
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Octoroks, Staphos, P-hats, like likes, etc.

1748
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:05,000
Then in order to put a particular character in the game you have to touch the amiibo to your Wii U gamepad first.

1749
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:09,000
But what if you successfully manage to collect all of the amiibo?

1750
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:15,000
Simple solution. Each amiibo can only be tapped 10 times before you have to go buy another one.

1751
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:17,000
Genius! Another great new Nintendo experience.

1752
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:21,000
You know what? It sounds like they're really gearing up for mobile then.

1753
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:25,000
Enjoy it with your family. Hugs and kisses, Aaron Weiser.

1754
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:30,000
I don't think that it would make less of a demand for Zelda games.

1755
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:35,000
Why make Mario Maker then? Because Mario is your biggest breadwinner for Nintendo.

1756
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:37,000
Obviously they're not worried about that.

1757
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
And we're talking about an old style of the game anyways.

1758
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:45,000
I'm talking old SNES Zelda.

1759
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:49,000
Where every gamer has a voice but I'm taking years away after that.

1760
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:53,000
I can't have those ideas out there in the universe.

1761
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:58,000
There is a remote possibility that Reggie Fils-Aime listens to this show in his car.

1762
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:03,000
I'm sure he eagerly awaits every new episode as he gets on his plane to fly from Washington.

1763
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:05,000
You're smoking some crack, Rob.

1764
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:07,000
I can't have him hearing that.

1765
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:09,000
Put down the Topopo.

1766
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:13,000
And then someday when I go to one of these Nintendo press conferences far, far in the future,

1767
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:15,000
he'll look out into the audience and be like,

1768
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:17,000
You!

1769
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:22,000
And he will bring you up on stage and punch you in the face.

1770
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:24,000
He will. He will. You better believe it.

1771
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:26,000
I will fully embrace that.

1772
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:34,000
yyrnchat over at live.vognetwork.com says,

1773
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
You can only use the voice 10 times.

1774
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:42,000
Everybody's been asking me when this show is finally going to make some damn money.

1775
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:44,000
Oh my God, yyrnchat, you're a genius.

1776
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:51,000
I'm going to limit the amount of calls you can make to this program until you join the OLR Premium Club.

1777
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
How's that? No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding, people. I'm kidding.

1778
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:56,000
Get your finger off the pause button.

1779
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:57,000
We'll call it. We'll call it.

1780
02:26:58,000 --> 02:26:59,000
I'm sorry.

1781
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:01,000
We'll make them OL Army officers.

1782
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:05,000
I'm sorry, if you'd like to shit some more in this game, you're going to need to purchase more taco bucks in order to purchase tacos.

1783
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:14,000
Alright, let's get into the FUs. That's it for the mailbag tonight?

1784
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:19,000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com if you would like to send us some emails for the future.

1785
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:23,000
I'm sure what I just said might just burn some more emails. We'll see there.

1786
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.

1787
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:31,000
Every week here we like to say FU to a few things that are bothering us in the game world and beyond.

1788
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:37,000
Why? Because after 591 episodes, we do have a fuck to give.

1789
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:58,000
Fuck you to human frailty and mortality. That's it.

1790
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:00,000
Hello, Keith.

1791
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Fuck you for not having enough time to work on all these awesome game ideas I have. I have another idea for a puzzle game that incorporates a phrase I've been using on this show for a long time.

1792
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:14,000
It's so goddamn hilarious. I just can't wait to prototype this thing.

1793
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
Oh, joy. Another game for you to start when you have it finished.

1794
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:21,000
No, no, no. It's going to be quick. It's a simple concept, but it's so ridiculous.

1795
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:24,000
Bobby Black Wolf is currently looking at his brain.

1796
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:29,000
I'm still going to finish this first, but when I'm done...

1797
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:38,000
Alright, let's see. My FU of the week goes to my old Keurig machine. I'm surprised our soccer didn't comment when she walked in here.

1798
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
My old Keurig machine finally bit the dust this week.

1799
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:43,000
In what way?

1800
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:52,000
After five years. It will no longer... It can't suck anymore. The water will not suck. It's gone from suck to blow.

1801
02:28:53,000 --> 02:29:03,000
Anyway, there it is. So yeah, I had to go out and buy a new coffee maker this week, but I will say the new coffee maker is a little faster, so I like getting my coffee fast.

1802
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
You know how bad those are for the environment, though.

1803
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:15,000
Okay, Debbie Downer, I want my coffee. I saw those things where you could turn them into little planners and cute shit, and I'm fine with that. That's fine.

1804
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
I also have a reusable K-cup that I do use.

1805
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:20,000
I got it for you.

1806
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:22,000
You have like two or three of them.

1807
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
I did buy you a box of K-cups at Dunkin' Donuts.

1808
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
Yay! I love Dunkin' Donuts.

1809
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Fuck you, environment. Anyway.

1810
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:42,000
Anyhow, there it is for the FUs of the week. So we have one more story, and then we are going to open up the Skype line over at 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1811
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:50,000
But the last story I have for you guys has to do with Tetris, and how Tetris is being used for educational purposes.

1812
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:57,000
The European Central Bank created a game called Tetris New 20 Euro.

1813
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:07,000
You can play this in your browser, and it's a variation on Tetris that will let you learn security facts about the new 20 euro note.

1814
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:11,000
Because, you know, people like to counterfeit money, and they do the same thing in the US.

1815
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:16,000
They've redone the $20 bill, I don't know how many times, and they always put all these new security things in it.

1816
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:22,000
Like, you can hold it up to a light, and you see the strip, and there's like heat sensitive ink, and all this crazy stuff.

1817
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:24,000
So I'm sure the 20 euro note is no different.

1818
02:30:25,000 --> 02:30:33,000
But what's interesting about this is that they're using Tetris, and when you beat a level, you learn a fact about how to fake a 20 euro bill.

1819
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:35,000
Just kidding. Obviously you don't want to fake them.

1820
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:47,000
But did you know that as one sample fact here, the portrait of Europa, who's pictured on the bill, becomes a transparent hologram if you hold it up to the light.

1821
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:58,000
So there you go. If you're horrible at Tetris though, you'll still be trying to use a copy machine to copy 20 dollar euros, because you won't get to learn anything about the security facts.

1822
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:05,000
And obviously I'm making jokes, don't copy money, don't end up arrested as a result of this show.

1823
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:07,000
Don't copy that euro.

1824
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:09,000
Yeah, don't copy that floppy or that euro.

1825
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:17,000
Skypline is open, it's that time. 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype, which Skype's on every stinking device these days, and phone.

1826
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:21,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word if you want to give us a call.

1827
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
Over in the chat room, some concern over my coffee there.

1828
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:29,000
SHO 100 Matt says, Rob, just don't get those Keurig 2.0 machines because they're coffee DRM.

1829
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:38,000
Oh, you better believe it. We researched and we stayed away from the 2.0 machines. They actually still have a 1.0 model, at least Target did.

1830
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:43,000
Honestly, the model I picked up is almost exactly like my old machine.

1831
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:51,000
There's a little chip that can read if the foil is genuine on the cup, and if it's not, then it will reject it.

1832
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
It will not brew the coffee. It says, I will not brew coffee.

1833
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:55,000
So it has to be licensed by Keurig?

1834
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
Yes. Oh, you didn't hear about the coffee DRM? Oh, it's awesome.

1835
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:00,000
None shall brew.

1836
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:02,000
None shall brew.

1837
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:04,000
I don't have one of those. I use a drip.

1838
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
But, you know, people found a way around it. Do you know what you do?

1839
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:09,000
You save the foil from the previous one?

1840
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
You just save the foil from the one before and put it right on top of the new one.

1841
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:16,000
How easy was that?

1842
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:18,000
I guess.

1843
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:19,000
Coffee DRM. What would they think of next?

1844
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:21,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1845
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:23,000
Hey, this is Hack Def.

1846
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:25,000
Hey, Hack Def. What's on your mind, my friend?

1847
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:27,000
So, you're one of us.

1848
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
Oh God, the amiibo thing, right?

1849
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:34,000
Yeah. Did I talk about it on this show or was that only on Bobby's show?

1850
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:36,000
I don't remember.

1851
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:42,000
Okay, well, I got the Wii Fit Trainer amiibo from AkumaJP, but that was a gift, so you can't hold that one against me.

1852
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:47,000
But this week, I guess I talked about this on Bobby's show. I didn't talk about it here.

1853
02:32:48,000 --> 02:33:01,000
So, this week, a friend of mine wanted to go buy Pokemon for his new 3DS, because he just got one of the new 3DSs, and he didn't have, because he didn't even have any 3DS at all, but he wanted to get Pokemon.

1854
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:08,000
So, we actually went to GameStop, and you guys know I don't ever go to GameStop either.

1855
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:18,000
We went in, and sure enough, sitting on the shelf, Mega Man amiibo. And I was like, I have to have it. I want it.

1856
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:25,000
So, everything I've said about, I'm done with this amiibo game. I'm over it. I'm not supporting it anymore.

1857
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:27,000
I'm not shopping at GameStop.

1858
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:37,000
I'm not shopping at GameStop. That Mega Man looked me in the face and said, please love me. Capcom stopped loving me a long time ago, but won't you love me and take me home?

1859
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:41,000
So, I bought it, and now it has a home sitting on my shelf.

1860
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:49,000
I'm not surprised about you buying the amiibo, because if you look up the Mega Man amiibo, it's one of the pretty much better looking ones.

1861
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:51,000
Yeah, it really is.

1862
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:57,000
I'm more surprised of you buying the GameStop, especially after my friend about it months ago.

1863
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:03,000
You know, it was one of those things where my friend was like, let's go to the mall, we can go to these different places, and I can go to GameStop.

1864
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:12,000
And I'm not, you know, I'm not going to be the type to say like, oh no friend, listen to me, you can't shop at GameStop, because you know what, I'm not going to ruin somebody's day.

1865
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
Just fine. If that's what you want to do, go, fine.

1866
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:26,000
Yeah, that's it. If you have something that's on GameStop, if you want to buy it, well then, buy it.

1867
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:37,000
But yeah, speaking of the amiibos, pretty much I have also expanded my collection a little bit. Sorry.

1868
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
A little horse here.

1869
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:47,000
That's alright. Alan is very sick this week actually, he hasn't dropped on the show this week because he's not allowed to bring germs into the studio.

1870
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:57,000
But yeah, I got some of the new amiibo, I got the Toad amiibo, and the new Yoshi amiibo too.

1871
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:08,000
Yeah, you know, actually I saw they also had it at GameStop, they had the new Luigi and the new Princess and some of those Super Mario amiibo, but I could, like, one, one only.

1872
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:17,000
Mega Man, I'm doing it, and I'm not buying all these other ones as well, because at least I didn't like, totally, because there is a part of me that would have been like, I'm buying ten.

1873
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:21,000
I'm buying all ten you have on the shelf, I'm buying them all. But I resisted that, so.

1874
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:33,000
Yeah, I'm limited in myself too. I'm pretty much only collecting, or at least will try to collect, all the Smash Brothers ones, but I got the Yoshi one because it looks pretty nice.

1875
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:38,000
It looks pretty. And I got the Toad one because of Captain Toad Treasure Tracker.

1876
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:44,000
And what does Toad do in Toad Treasure Tracker, the amiibo? I haven't played that yet.

1877
02:35:44,000 --> 02:36:01,000
It isn't that much. It has a new mode of gameplay, if you can say it like that. In each level of the game, it hides a pixel Toad, an 8-bit Toad basically, and you have to find it.

1878
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:11,000
And after you find it, you have to tap your gamepad, and that's pretty much it. Some of them are easy, and some of them are pretty hard to find.

1879
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:24,000
In one of the levels, I pretty much lasted like ten minutes trying to find him, after I finally found him.

1880
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:34,000
And it's pretty much really fun. It has a little bit of replayability if you have finished the game, like me in this case.

1881
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:48,000
But yeah, it's suffering a little but fun addition. So if you have Treasure Tracker, you can pretty much get a Toad. It's not that hard to find. There are a lot of stores happening.

1882
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:59,000
So if you want to add a little bit to that, you can buy it. And again, it's fun, and it adds that replayability to the game.

1883
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:07,000
Well, that's good to know about. I didn't play enough of Captain Toad. I bought it, and I played a little bit of it, but then I just, you know,

1884
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:14,000
Ooh, shiny, a new game over here. Ooh, I gotta play eleven more hours of Final Fantasy XIV, because I thought it would be a good idea to start grinding the books in that game.

1885
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:21,000
So, you know, things happen to distract me, but I like Captain Toad. I need to go back and do some more levels and play with this amiibo stuff, for sure.

1886
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:34,000
Yeah, Captain Toad is a really great game to play in little bits. It's a short game. You don't need to spend that much time playing it.

1887
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:42,000
So yeah, you can play it, and with the Toad amiibo, you can add a little bit more. Sorry.

1888
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:49,000
You know, it strikes me as the kind of game to Captain Toad that might be alright on a tablet.

1889
02:37:51,000 --> 02:38:01,000
I wonder. I wonder. I don't know, parts of it would. Like, obviously there were some levels, like when you're in the mine cart and stuff, that might be a little more difficult and might not translate so well,

1890
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:07,000
but, like, the base game, or at least the levels as they were in Mario 3D Land might kind of work. I don't know.

1891
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:17,000
Maybe, but I don't know. The controls would be really kind of awkward, but it maybe could work. Maybe.

1892
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:21,000
Alright. Well, Act F, I'm going to let you go to get more calls, but thanks so much for calling in tonight.

1893
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:23,000
Hey, thanks for having me.

1894
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:25,000
No, of course. Anytime. Anytime. Take care.

1895
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:34,000
1877 Game O.L.R., or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word. Tigerclaw shared this in the chatroom, and I got a kick out of this.

1896
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:43,000
I had heard that the new Mortal Kombat game, Mortal Kombat X, was going to be bringing a new type of, you know how they have fatality, babality, and all this stuff?

1897
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:49,000
There was going to be a new type of ality that came into Mortal Kombat X, and they revealed it this week on Twitter.

1898
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:55,000
Ed Boon wrote a tweet that says, what happens when your opponent disconnects during an online match?

1899
02:38:56,000 --> 02:39:03,000
You are rewarded with a quit-ality, is the new, it's a quit-ality. That is fucking brilliant. I love it.

1900
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:10,000
And there it is, a little picture there of a quit-ality, because your opponent rage quit. I love that.

1901
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Dar Sakura, you like that? A quit-ality?

1902
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:14,000
I am smirking deep within my soul.

1903
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:20,000
You couldn't do that back in the day. Well, I guess you could. You could just say, like, throw your hands up and just walk away.

1904
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Fuck this game. Just walk away. But then, you know, you lost your quarter, so, or 50 cents, depending on where you gamed at.

1905
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:31,000
Alright, we got another call coming in, so let's do it. Hi on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

1906
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:33,000
Hey, hey, it's Ronma.

1907
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:35,000
Hey, Ronma, how you doing?

1908
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:37,000
Not much, I'm alright, how about you?

1909
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:39,000
I'm super, thanks for asking. What's on your mind tonight?

1910
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:47,000
Well, I called because, um, I don't know if you realize, but you did break one of the cardinal rules of OLR and VOG.

1911
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
I shopped at Evil G?

1912
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:52,000
Yes, you have to give your pennants.

1913
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:57,000
Hail Betty White, Hail Betty White, Hail Betty White.

1914
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
Nah, my brother, you gotta do a little bit more than that.

1915
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:02,000
Okay, what?

1916
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:08,000
1,000 B.Arthurs, 2,000 Betty Whites, and 300 Fairchild Channel Fs.

1917
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
I'll get started on that right after the show.

1918
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:13,000
Good, good, good.

1919
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:20,000
Uh, love it, love it. Uh, so, uh, you're, you're, you're, uh, you're very upset at me for my shopping adventure?

1920
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:28,000
Uh, no, I'm just busting your balls about because you kind of got on me when I talked to you about G4 years ago, so I think we're even now.

1921
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:33,000
I, I appreciate, I appreciate the listeners looking out. That's the last time I...

1922
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:35,000
That's because we love you!

1923
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:41,000
I'm never, you know what, I'm not tweeting that shit in the future. In the future, I'm just going to be like, somebody's going to come over and be like, Rob, when did you get a Mega Man amiibo?

1924
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:43,000
And I'm just going to be like, I don't know, maybe, maybe Allen bought it.

1925
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:45,000
You disappeared.

1926
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:47,000
I think Allen got it, I wasn't looking.

1927
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:49,000
Oh, why are you going to blame him? Come on!

1928
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:51,000
Okay, fine, I'll blame the cats.

1929
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:53,000
Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.

1930
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:55,000
Thrift store.

1931
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:57,000
Yeah, Sanrio brought it in from the backyard.

1932
02:40:58,000 --> 02:40:59,000
Thrift store.

1933
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:03,000
Which is funny, I found a Mega Man amiibo for 20 bucks at the flea market in Mobile, Alabama.

1934
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:04,000
Did you really?

1935
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:08,000
I did, I almost bought it. And then I was like, wait, I just bought two Atari controllers for three bucks.

1936
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:10,000
I, I wanted...

1937
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:12,000
And one of them is kind of rare.

1938
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:14,000
I wanted to go to the flea market this weekend here in Sac, but I just...

1939
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:16,000
Let's go to the flea market next week.

1940
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:18,000
I'm going possibly to Reno next week.

1941
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:20,000
Too bad, we're going.

1942
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:22,000
I may be in Reno next week, which, yeah.

1943
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:32,000
Well, apparently I got to check out some arcades out there. Tiger Claw may not realize this, but I was actually on Google Plus, and I was posting the Orange Sanrio question of the week on Google Plus.

1944
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:38,000
And the comment he made on a video that was like a Reno arcade thing actually showed up in the feed.

1945
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:40,000
And of course I looked at it and I was like, I want to see this.

1946
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:46,000
And I didn't realize they have this arcade up in Reno that has like quite a few classic games at Pepper Mill, which is why I never realized it was there.

1947
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:48,000
Because why on earth would I go to the Pepper Mill casino?

1948
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:53,000
But I need to check it out apparently. They've got a lot of classic games there, so...

1949
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:57,000
Thanks, Tiger Claw. You didn't even know you gave me a tip without realizing it.

1950
02:41:58,000 --> 02:41:59,000
You got to watch what you Plus won.

1951
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
Anyway, what else is on your mind, Rama? Anything?

1952
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:09,000
Ah, I know that. I just called, you know, to playfully give you shit for going to the evil of GRs. I like to call them Shame Stop.

1953
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:13,000
Well, I appreciate it. It's fine. It's fine. What's coming up on Anime Jam Session this week?

1954
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:23,000
Well, we are getting ready for Zenkai Con this weekend. Marco is still working on the outlines, so I'll know what we're definitely talking about.

1955
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:33,000
But there is an interesting article about furry cosplay, how it's come a long, long way, and it's like, it's really articulate and really nice, so...

1956
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:42,000
There's no more the whole cosplay versus furries thing. It's like we've kind of made peace. We're happy now. We've all worked together.

1957
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:49,000
Alright. That's, that's, yeah, yeah. Cosplay is for everybody, right?

1958
02:42:49,000 --> 02:43:03,000
Yes, and that's, you know, that's what is starting to take a stronger trend now, because now that you've got cosplayers who are trying to do it for the publicity and this and that, the trend is now moving from that towards fun, and now, why not both?

1959
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:10,000
Porque no los dos. Alright. Take care, my friend. I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls. Thank you for calling in to yell at me.

1960
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:12,000
Hey, no problem, because I love you.

1961
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:14,000
Alright. Mwah. Bye.

1962
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:22,000
1-877-GAME-OL-R, username on Skype, Orange Laundrio. Akuma JP in chat asking, did I start something I'm not supposed to? Rob is shopping at Evil G.

1963
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:33,000
No, no, no, no. Don't blame you. Don't blame you. I did not know about your gift, actually. I did not know about that until, actually, it was when Jamie called me yesterday evening.

1964
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:41,000
So, funny enough, only like a few hours after buying that Mega Man did I even find out that you had bought the generous gift that you gave me.

1965
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:55,000
But even if that wasn't the case, I mean, it would be pretty cool. I just love the fact that, dude, I got an Amiibo that actually came from Japan, and the fact that it came from a listener is like super cool as well.

1966
02:43:56,000 --> 02:44:06,000
Like, I, you know, even if it was something like, even if you'd sent me like an Xbox One game and I don't even own an Xbox One right now, I'd be like, that's so cool that somebody did that.

1967
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:15,000
So, at least the Wii Fit Trainer Amiibo, I can use that, and I'm going to train that, and I'm going to enter that Amiibo in some tournaments. You better bet, and it'll be awesome.

1968
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:29,000
Alright, so anyhow, 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to call in here while we wait to see if the phone lines go off. Askin' Loki or Dark Soccer real quick, any last minute stories you guys might have?

1969
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:42,000
Sure. So the Driver franchise is coming back, because I'm really excited how the Driver series has gone. This time, it's coming back as Driver Speed of a Paradise, which is an Android and iOS game.

1970
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:51,000
And it looks exactly like, I don't know, Hydro Thunder. Hooray!

1971
02:44:52,000 --> 02:45:01,000
And then I was going to also mention that there's a brand new game jam that's going on now, called the Boob Is Life game jam.

1972
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000
It's celebrating boobs in games.

1973
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:19,000
I was, you know, I gave that the benefit of the doubt for like a half minute, and I was like, oh, is it like, maybe like, breast cancer awareness? Like, is it trying to bring and raise, nope, okay, oh, it's just, oh, it's porny, okay, I see.

1974
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:28,000
That's too bad. I thought there might have been a good note there. I suppose not. What if, okay, wait, what are the rules of the boob game?

1975
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:46,000
There's only one rule. The only rule is it must have boob in game. Any size, big or small, a mini boob, or not mini boob, main feature or small feature must have, but must have, female boob is the best thing on the planet, but man boob, boob, okay if insist.

1976
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:50,000
Okay, I was going to ask, are man boobs okay?

1977
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:52,000
Yes.

1978
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:58,000
Alright, so man boobs are okay. Good, then I don't have to read this whole thing going on there, whatever.

1979
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:12,000
It's the internet, people. There's something for everything there on the internet. 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call, last chance to get in before we close it up for the night. Anything else, Logie?

1980
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:31,000
There's supposed to be a tease being done by Famitsu about some sort of new game that's coming out for the DS and Wii, I'm assuming they mean Wii U. Something by Level 5, maybe Dragon Quest-ish, but not sure what that is.

1981
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:37,000
Level 5 did Fantasy Life, so we already know that sequel's coming, so we'd be surprised if they were working on something there too.

1982
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
That'd be kind of cool if it was for the Wii U as well.

1983
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:54,000
That'd be nice. Tiger Lot sent me this earlier in the night, apparently Roller Coaster Tycoon World. The graphics are being changed because fans complained. There was a gameplay trailer that came out and fans weren't happy with it after the trailer came out.

1984
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:59,000
Well, they said, yeah, I remember reading, they said, oh, it's from pre-alpha footage, you know, that's why.

1985
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
Yeah, don't get mad, people, don't get mad.

1986
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:17,000
Supposedly, this game is coming in mid-2015, so if those graphics have to be changed, I'm gonna think they're gonna do it quick, but it was a pre-alpha, it was a pre-alpha, don't panic, people. Don't panic. Please give us your money. Please. Here it is.

1987
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:30,000
Alright, um, let's see here, um, 1877 Game O.L.R., or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.

1988
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:38,000
I guess I'll leave that open for one more minute here, because I see some people in chat might be trying to get through, so we'll wait on that real quick here, but then I'm gonna close it up.

1989
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
Um, any other stories?

1990
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:43,000
I got nothing else.

1991
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:51,000
Yeah, it was kind of a slower week this week, um, I mean, you had some big stories, some big, big news, but then outside of that, it was kind of slim pickins, so.

1992
02:47:52,000 --> 02:48:05,000
Alright, well, sadly, it doesn't look like the phones are lighting up there, so I am, sadly, gonna have to close it down. I'm sorry to those that didn't get through, but please consider sending us an email over at, uh, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1993
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:10,000
Uh, you can also tweet at us, Twitter.com slash O.L.R.

1994
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:21,000
Uh, if you want to send us your thoughts after the show, of course, uh, many folks also participate in the forums, sometimes we get some comments on the episodes as well, over at VogNetwork.com.

1995
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:31,000
Uh, I mentioned this earlier in the show, but next week on the show, we're gonna have, uh, talk a little more about the, uh, Sacramento Indie Arcade event that's happening in April that we're gonna be broadcasting live from.

1996
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:52,000
We're gonna have Brianna and Gabriel here in studio, live, to talk about, uh, that event, and I know Gabriel's gonna want to talk about his game, uh, that just had a demo go to Desura today, Crumple, so they'll be on the show next week when you talk all about all those things, and they'll also be here with us to chat and laugh at the news with us next week.

1997
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:54,000
So, uh, that's to look forward to next week.

1998
02:48:55,000 --> 02:49:09,000
Also coming up in the month of April, uh, Kyle Ward gonna be coming on the show, I think I mentioned that before, uh, Kyle Ward, of course, has a long history of the music games, um, he's got new games coming out, Ditto Beat, and ReRave, now on Android devices, ReRave Plus.

1999
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:19,000
He will be on the show in April, we're still working out exactly what date that is going to be, so, uh, we're working out some other guests as well for the month of April, so we're gonna have a lot of cool stuff to look forward to coming up in the coming weeks.

2000
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:26,000
But now is the part of the show where I say thank you for listening to the show, thank you for supporting independent radio, thank you for downloading our show.

2001
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:47,000
If you liked what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two or fifty about the show, help spread the word, because, you know, we're not supported by some big website, we don't have a big budget, we, we just do this because we love games, and we love you guys, and the family that we have here that turns out every Sunday night, and we just want it to grow with more cool, awesome people.

2002
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:58,000
So, tell a friend or five about the show, and if you really can't think of anyone to tell, you could always leave us a nice review on iTunes or Stitcher Radio, those reviews, I tell you, they go a long way.

2003
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:03,000
Wherever you found out about the show, please leave a nice review and let someone else find out about it too.

2004
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:10,000
It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought for the night before we can wrap up. Uh, Loki, we'll start with you tonight, your final thought?

2005
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:22,000
I'm still trying to figure out what the title of my second level here of my game, because I'm trying to give it, like, a funny title for each one, but, without kind of giving away what the gimmick is, I don't know, we'll figure it out, I guess.

2006
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:24,000
Alright.

2007
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
And what the hell am I going to do with this amiibo? I guess I'll put it on my shelf.

2008
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
It is, well, I mean, the nice thing about amiibo, they're good figures too.

2009
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:32,000
Yeah, they are. It's a standing box.

2010
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
You do have, you have kids, well, the kids might be too young for that.

2011
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:37,000
Kids will eat that.

2012
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
They can appreciate it in a couple more years though.

2013
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:50,000
Alright, my final thought for the night, my final thought is, oh my god, those pear candies, like, how many years is it going to be before I get to have another one?

2014
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:56,000
I need, some place in Japantown and SF must have those, and we must find them, Dark Sakura, I'm just saying.

2015
02:50:57,000 --> 02:51:01,000
They didn't have it at Oto's last time I was there, so we will, that's what we need to do, Rob.

2016
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:06,000
We need to make a pilgrimage to Japantown for candy.

2017
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:08,000
Sounds good to me.

2018
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:13,000
We checked, like, Coriana Plaza or something like that, that has, like, a bunch of, like, stuff from all around.

2019
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:15,000
Oh, over in Rancho?

2020
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:17,000
Yeah, they have, like, all sorts of stuff.

2021
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:19,000
That's right, I forget they have more, like, cause when I lived over there-

2022
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:21,000
Didn't they, like, buy every store next to them?

2023
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:25,000
Yeah, when I lived over there, they didn't really have anything, but now they've got a ton of stuff over there.

2024
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:27,000
It's a huge, yeah, thing, so you might check over there.

2025
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:29,000
Well, Dark Sakura, we might have to make a trip, we'll see.

2026
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:33,000
Alright, anyhow, Dark Sakura, last but not least, your final thought for the night.

2027
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:36,000
Bye, bitches.

2028
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:40,000
Have a great week, everybody, we'll be back in seven days to do it all over again.

2029
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:45,000
Have fun gaming, be civil to each other, have a wonderful night. Good night.
