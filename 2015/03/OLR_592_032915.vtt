00:00.000 --> 00:17.080
This week, although the Smash Bros. series amiibos are not yet complete, Mario is getting

00:17.080 --> 00:19.680
friendlier with a classic design, releasing imminently.

00:19.680 --> 00:22.680
The collectibles keep coming along with this week in gaming news, and it all begins along

00:22.680 --> 00:29.960
with your comments and more, right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:29.960 --> 00:34.840
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.840 --> 00:36.520
where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.520 --> 00:45.120
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with our 592nd episode for March the 29th of 2015.

00:45.120 --> 00:48.920
Here with you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the

00:48.920 --> 00:52.080
gamer lifestyle, style, style, style, style.

00:52.080 --> 00:58.440
Here with me, Rob Roberts, and over there taunting me already, Wob Wobbits, a serious

00:58.440 --> 01:03.840
interview with Wob Wobbits and DarkSakura.

01:03.840 --> 01:05.680
How are you, Ms. Jamie Summers, or DarkSakura?

01:05.680 --> 01:06.680
I have a sinus infection.

01:06.680 --> 01:07.680
Do you?

01:07.680 --> 01:08.680
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:08.680 --> 01:09.900
You know what, I blame Alabama.

01:09.900 --> 01:11.640
As long as you're not contagious?

01:11.640 --> 01:16.480
You can't get sinus infections unless you dig your finger up my nose and pull some bacteria

01:16.480 --> 01:17.480
and eat it.

01:17.480 --> 01:20.140
And even then, highly unlikely.

01:20.140 --> 01:21.140
Don't test me.

01:21.140 --> 01:22.140
Ew!

01:22.140 --> 01:23.140
I'm going home, bye.

01:23.140 --> 01:27.200
I'll do a lot on a dare, no I'm kidding.

01:27.200 --> 01:30.720
I thought it was funny because earlier this week you gave me a call and you were like,

01:30.720 --> 01:34.800
Wob Wobbits, I don't know why you're Barbara Walters all of a sudden, Wob Wobbits, what

01:34.800 --> 01:38.640
was the condition that Alan had when he got sick?

01:38.640 --> 01:45.000
I started to feel like scratchy and sore on like Tuesday, but usually that's how my sinus

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
infection hit.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.200
Every time I come back from Alabama, sinus infection.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.200
There it is.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.200
And I didn't even think about it.

01:50.200 --> 01:53.520
I thought, oh, Alan was sick maybe, but that was like a week and a half.

01:53.520 --> 01:56.000
Something about traveling to Alabama just makes you sick.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
I don't know.

01:57.000 --> 02:01.880
I don't know what it is.

02:01.880 --> 02:02.880
The humidity.

02:02.880 --> 02:03.880
The humidity.

02:03.880 --> 02:04.880
That's it.

02:04.880 --> 02:05.880
Magnolias, camellias, azaleas.

02:05.880 --> 02:06.880
All right.

02:06.880 --> 02:10.400
Also, here in studio, of course, as he is every week, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

02:10.400 --> 02:11.400
Hi.

02:11.400 --> 02:12.400
How are you, Loki?

02:12.400 --> 02:13.400
I'm fine.

02:13.400 --> 02:16.960
Now, Loki said earlier, I just want to quote for you guys, that he may have had too much

02:16.960 --> 02:17.960
bacon.

02:17.960 --> 02:23.880
No, I said there may have been too much bacon on the pizza because it was too salty.

02:23.880 --> 02:24.880
I didn't have a...

02:24.880 --> 02:26.680
See, the problem was...

02:26.680 --> 02:30.400
How appropriate for you that it's a little too salty here on O.L.R.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.400
Here is my dilemma.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.400
Okay.

02:32.400 --> 02:36.360
The gas station I went to is one of those grocery store gas stations.

02:36.360 --> 02:38.920
They only had a fucking 16 ounce Red Bull.

02:38.920 --> 02:44.120
That is not enough Red Bull for me to, you know, first off, be awake right now, and second

02:44.120 --> 02:46.480
to have with that pizza.

02:46.480 --> 02:50.560
So, you know, I have to make sure my sodium intake is good.

02:50.560 --> 02:51.560
Be careful with those energy drinks.

02:51.560 --> 02:52.560
I know.

02:52.560 --> 02:53.560
Be careful with those energy drinks.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.240
I have one a day.

02:55.240 --> 02:56.240
I mean...

02:56.240 --> 02:59.240
I guess so did my husband, and he ended up in the hospital for...

02:59.240 --> 03:00.240
Most days I have one a day.

03:00.240 --> 03:01.240
His heart.

03:01.240 --> 03:02.240
So be careful.

03:02.240 --> 03:03.240
Be careful.

03:03.240 --> 03:05.240
It's just a little bit of caffeine.

03:05.240 --> 03:06.240
All right.

03:06.240 --> 03:07.240
Along with salt.

03:07.240 --> 03:09.480
Make sure you get in your exercise.

03:09.480 --> 03:10.480
Work out with the kids.

03:10.480 --> 03:11.480
All right.

03:11.480 --> 03:16.240
Of course, we are here in studio, but you guys are out there in the internet.

03:16.240 --> 03:21.240
Hello everybody who is listening live to us at the Voice of Geeks Network, vog.network.com,

03:21.240 --> 03:25.200
where we do tape our show live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern

03:25.200 --> 03:27.560
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

03:27.560 --> 03:30.740
And Bobby Black Wolf is actually live in our chat room there along with some of the other

03:30.740 --> 03:32.740
folks saying...

03:32.740 --> 03:35.800
Starting us off tonight, Bobby says, I'm hunting Wob Wobbits.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.880
So a little bit of Elmer Fudd there, action.

03:38.880 --> 03:39.880
How wonderful.

03:39.880 --> 03:45.640
Anyhow, of course, if you are listening on the podcast, a big hello to you as well.

03:45.640 --> 03:48.980
If for whatever reason it's your very first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, we've

03:48.980 --> 03:50.840
been doing this for a while.

03:50.840 --> 03:57.340
We started this show back in June of 2002, myself, Dark Sakura, and Loki all met playing

03:57.340 --> 04:01.760
Dance Dance Revolution at a local arcade here, Sun Splash.

04:01.760 --> 04:05.400
And we wanted to make a show about the little community that we were building because it

04:05.400 --> 04:08.800
was like Wednesday night worship, Wednesday night.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.040
And I'm not talking about like false idols or anything like that, but it's just what

04:11.040 --> 04:12.040
it was.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.080
Wednesday nights, we all got together.

04:13.080 --> 04:16.760
We would go to play DDR and we just stand around the machine like it was some cult with

04:16.760 --> 04:17.880
a little flashing lights.

04:17.880 --> 04:18.880
Play me.

04:18.880 --> 04:19.880
Give me a dollar.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.600
Give me a cute Eurobeat.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.440
So that was, that was us.

04:23.440 --> 04:29.480
And after we played DDR, we'd go to the diner right across the street and then we'd talk

04:29.480 --> 04:30.480
a little bit of smack.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.000
It was the old people diner on top of that.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
That's right.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
It was.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.460
And we talk a little smack and good things and bad things about our favorite pastime.

04:38.460 --> 04:43.920
And so we've extended that into the internet and with you guys at the world's largest dinner

04:43.920 --> 04:45.720
table, diner table here.

04:45.720 --> 04:49.480
Anyway, we have some very special guests here in studio.

04:49.480 --> 04:51.680
And I'm so excited to welcome these guys to the show.

04:51.680 --> 04:56.600
Speaking of Malwij, as I see talking about in our chat room, Wuv Twuwuv says a game guru

04:56.600 --> 04:58.880
in our chat.

04:58.880 --> 05:02.320
We met up a few weeks ago and it was literally one of those moments of where have you been

05:02.320 --> 05:03.320
all my life?

05:03.320 --> 05:07.960
And now here we are joining forces for you gamers out there.

05:07.960 --> 05:12.680
I'm so excited to welcome from the Sacramento IGDA chapter tonight.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.760
We have two representatives here in studio.

05:14.760 --> 05:18.480
Say hello everybody to Gabriel.

05:18.480 --> 05:21.000
And go ahead and pick up the mic there and say hello.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
And Brianna.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Hi.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Hi.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
How are you?

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Ladies first.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Ladies first.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
I'm great.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
And I'm so happy to be here.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.680
And oh boy, I can't believe you had me in here.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.080
Wait, what does that mean?

05:35.080 --> 05:36.080
Wait a minute.

05:36.080 --> 05:37.800
Does that mean she's a loose cannon?

05:37.800 --> 05:38.800
I don't know.

05:38.800 --> 05:39.800
I can't confirm or deny that.

05:39.800 --> 05:40.800
Sorry.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.280
How are you doing Gabriel?

05:42.280 --> 05:43.280
Never better.

05:43.280 --> 05:44.280
We're here.

05:44.280 --> 05:47.440
This is like I'm five minutes from home and it's like I'm in a whole other world right

05:47.440 --> 05:48.440
now.

05:48.440 --> 05:49.440
Beautiful.

05:49.440 --> 05:52.960
You were mentioning that beforehand that when I gave you the address to our top secret location

05:52.960 --> 05:57.000
where we tape in the Sacramento area, you found out that's five minutes from my house.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Yes.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
You've been doing that crap for years.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Seriously.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.360
I've been here three years and only now.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.360
Only now.

06:02.360 --> 06:03.360
And like, yeah.

06:03.360 --> 06:04.360
Yeah.

06:04.360 --> 06:05.360
Seriously.

06:05.360 --> 06:06.360
Way too long to have connected.

06:06.360 --> 06:07.360
Well, you know what?

06:07.360 --> 06:09.960
It goes both ways because now I'm realizing, holy crap, somebody's developing a Wii U game

06:09.960 --> 06:11.280
five minutes from my house.

06:11.280 --> 06:12.280
Damn straight.

06:12.280 --> 06:15.320
Tell us a little bit about your company Gabriel.

06:15.320 --> 06:19.000
You actually have like a little startup indie company and you're making games as well.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Tell us a little bit about that.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Yeah.

06:21.000 --> 06:31.000
So we've got, so the idea behind Nascent Games was, I needed a definition for the studio.

06:31.000 --> 06:35.080
You know, like where were we, what were the games that we're making going to do?

06:35.080 --> 06:37.720
What were we trying to achieve with our games?

06:37.720 --> 06:44.040
And the idea was we wanted to, I hate to say the phrase take it to the next level because

06:44.040 --> 06:47.520
it's so cliche, it's so overused and I try not to do that.

06:47.520 --> 06:52.360
So I tried to approach it a little differently just, you know, for me it was leave a good

06:52.360 --> 06:55.360
experience for every player that tries our stuff.

06:55.360 --> 07:02.480
Whether it's the player by definition of actually physically playing the game or by actually

07:02.480 --> 07:06.800
watching the game and saying, ooh, I want to see what happens next.

07:06.800 --> 07:13.200
So you know, so for me it was all about, you know, that ascent of the experience.

07:13.200 --> 07:17.040
You know, ascending and wanting to find out more, take it higher.

07:17.040 --> 07:21.080
So just without getting all cliche about it all.

07:21.080 --> 07:26.000
You know what, sometimes the answer is a little simpler than some might think.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
You know what I mean?

07:27.000 --> 07:30.780
Like some people want to know, where did the name Orange Lounge Radio come from?

07:30.780 --> 07:34.320
Because Orange Lounge was on a DDR machine and we thought like, you know, oh, we're all

07:34.320 --> 07:36.320
sitting, we're lounging around talking about games.

07:36.320 --> 07:37.320
It's a great name.

07:37.320 --> 07:39.240
So it's really that simple, people.

07:39.240 --> 07:41.240
That's all right.

07:41.240 --> 07:46.360
Also in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com we have Blakeman, who actually renamed his

07:46.360 --> 07:47.360
nickname there.

07:47.360 --> 07:48.360
Wow.

07:48.360 --> 07:51.520
Blakeman in our chat room says, excuse my ignorance, but what does IGDA mean?

07:51.520 --> 07:54.320
That is the International Game Developers Association, right?

07:54.320 --> 07:55.320
I should have said that, right?

07:55.320 --> 07:56.320
Yes, that's quite okay.

07:56.320 --> 08:00.280
Yeah, International Game Developers Association and what that is, they're a worldwide non-profit

08:00.280 --> 08:01.280
organization.

08:01.280 --> 08:06.600
They represent, I mean, all the countries possible, I mean, especially here.

08:06.600 --> 08:16.380
And it's a connection of game developers and gamers who just want to get involved more

08:16.380 --> 08:20.800
in the community, in the industry.

08:20.800 --> 08:26.680
And without, you know, without the, what's the best way to put this?

08:26.680 --> 08:30.000
I mean, I think it's just really, it's just a huge resource.

08:30.000 --> 08:38.200
IGDA is just a massive resource for people to learn more about how they can become, you

08:38.200 --> 08:42.760
know, how they can put their talents to use, or learn to put talents to use, or even just

08:42.760 --> 08:43.760
learn a talent.

08:43.760 --> 08:49.320
You know, just from the idea guy, which is me, to the programmer who can't draw.

08:49.320 --> 08:53.520
They want to find somebody, you know, who does art.

08:53.520 --> 08:59.100
Or the community outreach folks who want to bring folks together to do more.

08:59.100 --> 09:04.860
You know, to do more and, you know, really for the love of it all.

09:04.860 --> 09:07.680
I kind of hashtagged for the love of the game quite a bit.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.540
And there's kind of a core reason behind that.

09:09.540 --> 09:10.740
We maybe get to that later.

09:10.740 --> 09:12.820
But yeah, I mean, it's really for that.

09:12.820 --> 09:13.820
It's for the love of the game.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.900
And then hopefully we make a few bucks out of it.

09:15.900 --> 09:20.100
But otherwise, otherwise, yeah, we just, we love what we do.

09:20.100 --> 09:23.980
I think, you know, a lot of people out there, I would think not so much the listeners to

09:23.980 --> 09:24.980
this show.

09:24.980 --> 09:28.420
But you go on Twitter, you go on any message forum, and you see sometimes a lot, and there's

09:28.420 --> 09:35.340
a running joke here on OLR about GamersHateEverything.com, right, where, you know, where anything is

09:35.340 --> 09:38.660
announced and there's always like instant snark that goes with that, right?

09:38.660 --> 09:39.980
And we try to be...

09:39.980 --> 09:42.700
Are you talking about someone in particular?

09:42.700 --> 09:45.020
There is no salty individual I can think of.

09:45.020 --> 09:48.340
But, you know, all joking aside, I mean, we have fun with it.

09:48.340 --> 09:51.660
And there are some games sometimes that for whatever reason don't turn out as well as

09:51.660 --> 09:52.660
they could be.

09:52.660 --> 09:56.860
And usually that reason is middle management, but we won't go there.

09:56.860 --> 10:01.740
But I think some people don't really realize what goes into making a game.

10:01.740 --> 10:06.020
There's so much that goes into making a game, even a tiny little indie game, there's a lot

10:06.020 --> 10:07.020
that goes with it, right?

10:07.020 --> 10:10.900
So when you talk about resource sharing, I mean, we've even had, you know, Loki and he's

10:10.900 --> 10:13.820
been talking about some of the various projects he's been working on for a long time here

10:13.820 --> 10:14.900
on the show.

10:14.900 --> 10:16.860
Maybe he needs to sign up for your organization, I don't know.

10:16.860 --> 10:20.820
He really should, because I'm looking at what he's doing right now and then I didn't realize

10:20.820 --> 10:21.820
you were...

10:21.820 --> 10:25.500
You're seeing something like nobody else is getting to see, by the way, that whole, his

10:25.500 --> 10:29.020
mysterious VoG Jam game that ended in January.

10:29.020 --> 10:30.020
Yeah.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.020
Make it happen, man.

10:31.020 --> 10:32.020
We're right here.

10:32.020 --> 10:33.020
So...

10:33.020 --> 10:35.060
Just wasn't on time, unfortunately.

10:35.060 --> 10:39.460
Bobby is taking so much pleasure right now in the fact that Loki is being lectured by

10:39.460 --> 10:41.460
the IGDA here in the studio.

10:41.460 --> 10:48.660
Listen, if it's okay, if Zelda can be delayed, then I can delay my game.

10:48.660 --> 10:49.660
It's perfectly fine.

10:49.660 --> 10:51.660
I mean, I don't want to compare it to it.

10:51.660 --> 10:54.020
Is this the agony in the SSC featuring Loki?

10:54.020 --> 10:56.660
I'm not going to be the one that's going to make those comparisons, but I mean, if

10:56.660 --> 10:57.660
you want to draw those, that's fine.

10:57.660 --> 10:58.660
When will it be finished?

10:58.660 --> 10:59.660
When it's finished.

10:59.660 --> 11:00.660
Okay.

11:00.660 --> 11:06.060
But all this joking about deadlines aside, you have talked about how finding music for

11:06.060 --> 11:11.860
your game was like your big issue, and it took you a while to find that right resource,

11:11.860 --> 11:12.860
right?

11:12.860 --> 11:13.860
Yes.

11:13.860 --> 11:21.500
Just listening to everything that's CC by 3.0 or whatever on SoundCloud and browsing

11:21.500 --> 11:22.540
by genres.

11:22.540 --> 11:26.580
You know what, you and I could have just connected much sooner because I actually make

11:26.580 --> 11:29.620
my own music for my games.

11:29.620 --> 11:35.100
So yeah, double whammy, man.

11:35.100 --> 11:37.580
The music he did end up finding is actually really awesome.

11:37.580 --> 11:38.580
Oh, good.

11:38.580 --> 11:42.060
And if by awesome you mean really annoying because it was on purpose that I picked a

11:42.060 --> 11:44.620
really annoying dubstep song for the game.

11:44.620 --> 11:45.620
All right.

11:45.620 --> 11:47.340
Anyway, this isn't about you, Loki.

11:47.340 --> 11:50.860
This is about our guests here in the studio this week.

11:50.900 --> 11:54.460
And I do want to talk to Brianna in a minute as well, but since Gabriel, you have the mic

11:54.460 --> 11:59.540
right now, I want to talk about specifically the game that you're working on here.

11:59.540 --> 12:02.960
Because I know there's a lot of people, it's no secret right now, we've talked about on

12:02.960 --> 12:06.780
previous episodes of the show, we're going to be doing this event where we're live streaming

12:06.780 --> 12:08.940
on April 11th and y'all can check it out.

12:08.940 --> 12:14.380
It's the Sacramento in the Arcade event, which is presented by you guys in April 11th from

12:14.380 --> 12:15.540
10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

12:15.540 --> 12:17.780
You can tune in at vognetwork.com.

12:17.780 --> 12:22.500
Or if you're like that 3% of our listener base that lives in Sacramento, or even the

12:22.500 --> 12:26.900
Bay Area, heck, come on out to the show, check it out, we'll be there live in person.

12:26.900 --> 12:30.320
But I'm sure there's a lot of people out there that might, you know, because we have listeners

12:30.320 --> 12:37.220
in Mexico, we have listeners in Australia, Japan, Sweden, whatever happened to that man?

12:37.220 --> 12:42.500
I see him on Tumblr, but anyway, they might be wondering, why do I care about some event

12:42.500 --> 12:44.820
happening in Sacramento?

12:45.820 --> 12:50.820
But you guys are making games that everybody's going to play, right?

12:50.820 --> 12:51.820
Yes sir.

12:51.820 --> 12:52.820
That's the high goal.

12:52.820 --> 12:57.580
Well, it's more, it goes, see that's on the surface, yes, but it goes beyond that.

12:57.580 --> 13:05.740
For me, you know, there's a parallel going on with my startup as Nascent Games and, you

13:05.740 --> 13:11.780
know, founding that and then being the founder and chair for the chapter for IG Day Sacramento.

13:11.780 --> 13:18.340
For me, it was when I started my games, you know, even just having the confidence to say

13:18.340 --> 13:20.420
I'm going to make a game.

13:20.420 --> 13:24.680
Because that's the first biggest step, it's just having the confidence to make it.

13:24.680 --> 13:30.820
But then it became, becomes a thing of who else is out there that's struggling for that

13:30.820 --> 13:31.820
direction?

13:31.820 --> 13:37.260
And, you know, long story short, you know, it's, we are now, we are now in a position

13:37.260 --> 13:43.300
where my main goal, one of my biggest goals for this chapter is happening now.

13:43.300 --> 13:47.740
We are creating talent here in Sacramento.

13:47.740 --> 13:51.300
We are not outsourcing it anywhere, you know, unless we really, really need to, because

13:51.300 --> 13:54.240
I mean, you know, times are tough, you know, we just sometimes we need to.

13:54.240 --> 13:59.560
But there's so much talent here in Sacramento and so much of this talent have been very

13:59.560 --> 14:04.260
hesitant, you know, because they don't know where to go, they don't know who to connect

14:04.260 --> 14:10.020
with, they don't know who to talk to, or they have connected with people and they have

14:10.020 --> 14:14.820
lost, you know, they have been screwed over, you know, their trust has been tainted.

14:14.820 --> 14:16.340
And they're like, what do we do now?

14:16.340 --> 14:20.580
And you mentioned, you know, briefly mentioned the Bay Area, a lot of them, how many people

14:20.580 --> 14:26.140
we've met from LA, from the Bay, they were from here, but they left Sacramento because

14:26.140 --> 14:29.500
they wanted, you know, they wanted something better and they ended up in some way, shape

14:29.500 --> 14:30.820
or form got screwed over.

14:30.820 --> 14:31.920
So now they're back.

14:31.920 --> 14:36.900
And now, so now it's not just games that everyone's going to be able to play.

14:36.900 --> 14:40.460
It's the games are being made by Sacramento folks.

14:40.460 --> 14:46.100
And now, you know, the person trying these games is not going to be just a commenter

14:46.100 --> 14:52.420
on an app, you know, it's going to be in your face, like, this is what I think, you know,

14:52.420 --> 14:54.580
or, you know, and so on and so forth.

14:54.580 --> 14:59.460
And there's that in your face interaction, how old school yet how new it seems today

14:59.460 --> 15:00.460
in 2015.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.100
Yeah.

15:02.100 --> 15:04.740
Oh, my gosh.

15:04.740 --> 15:06.260
So much I can ask you guys about.

15:06.260 --> 15:09.260
It's only a three hour show, however.

15:09.260 --> 15:13.420
But let me let me just guys seriously don't even we met up for dinner a couple weeks ago.

15:13.420 --> 15:14.420
We could have been there all night.

15:14.420 --> 15:18.700
But anyway, let me ask you about this specifically the game you're working on.

15:18.700 --> 15:23.000
You're working on a game with your with nascent games, you are creating a game.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.780
You just had a big demo go out to DeSoura, right?

15:26.780 --> 15:29.540
And this is something that people should be keeping their eye on is going to come to the

15:29.620 --> 15:30.620
Wii U eventually, right?

15:30.620 --> 15:31.620
Yes, they will.

15:31.620 --> 15:32.620
Tell us a little bit about Crumple.

15:32.620 --> 15:40.260
So Crumple, our very, very first game demo ever on anything, just which was extremely

15:40.260 --> 15:46.460
unexpected, like we I really didn't like we in the back of our head, we thought, yeah,

15:46.460 --> 15:47.460
we can make it happen.

15:47.460 --> 15:50.820
But you didn't you don't really believe completely it's going to actually happen.

15:50.820 --> 15:52.100
But now it has.

15:52.100 --> 15:56.700
And I've been very, very fortunate to connect with the right people, you know, just taking

15:56.700 --> 15:58.620
that initiative to connect with folks.

15:58.620 --> 16:02.580
And now we're at this place, our demos out there on DeSoura.

16:02.580 --> 16:07.540
We are at a probably around two thousand two thousand two thousand visits and tries for

16:07.540 --> 16:10.340
just the demo in a week.

16:10.340 --> 16:13.580
And that's insane because I don't know who the hell they are.

16:13.580 --> 16:14.580
I don't know who they are.

16:14.580 --> 16:19.260
I mean, and I know I know we have, you know, I think I think five different countries.

16:19.260 --> 16:26.060
I mean, I've seen people trying our game from Ukraine, Italy, Germany, Finland.

16:26.060 --> 16:27.620
I don't know who these people are.

16:27.620 --> 16:33.140
You know, you and I have the exact same reactions, but for you it's a game, for me it's a podcast.

16:33.140 --> 16:34.140
It's the same thing.

16:34.140 --> 16:39.340
You sit there and you go, somebody in Belgium's listening to my show and sending me an email.

16:39.340 --> 16:40.340
That's so cool.

16:40.340 --> 16:41.340
Yeah, it's insane.

16:41.340 --> 16:46.020
And the and the and the reviews have been we've actually we actually got our first review

16:46.020 --> 16:47.020
from some person.

16:47.020 --> 16:49.660
I have no idea who they are, but they reviewed our game.

16:49.660 --> 16:51.680
They're very, very in-depth with it.

16:51.680 --> 16:56.420
The commentary, you know, especially from my own dear Brianna as well.

16:56.420 --> 16:59.780
She left some fantastic commentary, especially the Twitter was nuts that day.

16:59.780 --> 17:02.220
But anyway, so Crumple, back to Crumple.

17:02.220 --> 17:07.260
So Crumple is, yes, it is going to be out for PC first, then for the Wii U.

17:07.260 --> 17:11.220
Crumple is about this little envelope that comes to life and it wakes up in this burning

17:11.220 --> 17:12.220
paper factory.

17:12.220 --> 17:15.380
I kind of wanted to go with the similar approach of Limbo, you know, where this little boy

17:15.380 --> 17:17.140
wakes up in Limbo.

17:17.140 --> 17:20.740
We have no idea how the hell it got there, but, you know, it just has to keep going.

17:20.740 --> 17:25.080
So I kind of wanted to approach it that way with with Crumple.

17:25.080 --> 17:29.480
But obviously, you know, it's not it's not in like the first circle of hell or anything

17:29.480 --> 17:30.480
like that.

17:30.480 --> 17:31.980
You know, it's just it's just in the burning paper factory.

17:31.980 --> 17:34.900
Just wanted to keep it simple and then proceed from there.

17:34.900 --> 17:37.080
The game is going to be released in episodes.

17:37.080 --> 17:43.580
So the first full episode for Crumple should hopefully be out sometime in May and then

17:43.580 --> 17:48.980
episode two and three, hopefully about three or four months apart from each one.

17:49.000 --> 17:54.340
And then the idea will be, once we get all those episodes out, get it ported over to

17:54.340 --> 17:55.340
the Wii U.

17:55.340 --> 17:59.420
I would need to find a new programmer for it, though, because Wii U doesn't play Flash

17:59.420 --> 18:00.420
games.

18:00.420 --> 18:03.700
So I have to use either HTML5 or JavaScript, but anyway, technical stuff.

18:03.700 --> 18:06.740
So now I'm sorry.

18:06.740 --> 18:09.620
So our other game tripping my own my own partner.

18:09.620 --> 18:14.400
So our other game is Kinship and Kinship was actually the first game we started on.

18:14.400 --> 18:17.580
But it is admittedly a bit of an ambitious game.

18:17.580 --> 18:18.580
But that's what I want.

18:18.580 --> 18:22.260
I like, you know, you need that ambition, but then you need your simple stuff.

18:22.260 --> 18:28.420
So Kinship is essentially an action story implemented shmup.

18:28.420 --> 18:32.620
And you know, shmups are, you know, a dime a dozen, one of the oldest genres out there

18:32.620 --> 18:33.620
in video gaming.

18:33.620 --> 18:38.340
But very few of them have ever implemented any sort of story, let alone any sort of decent

18:38.340 --> 18:39.340
story.

18:39.340 --> 18:41.340
And I said, you know what?

18:41.340 --> 18:50.060
I want to take the things I loved about Gradius 3, Axlae, R-Type, games like that, but have

18:50.060 --> 18:56.060
some sort of deeper-ish, not Mass Effect deeper-ish, but I mean, you know, just deeper narrative

18:56.060 --> 19:01.940
to it where, as I mentioned before, where people were maybe like Brianna, who may not

19:01.940 --> 19:08.180
be into shmups, can just watch it and be like, wow, that's great, that's cool, what happens

19:08.180 --> 19:09.180
next?

19:09.180 --> 19:11.220
I know who you might need to talk to.

19:11.220 --> 19:14.020
And I would be remiss if I did not mention, because we just had them on the show like

19:14.020 --> 19:18.660
six weeks ago, but the guys behind Starmazer, which is a game that's on Kickstarter, that's

19:18.660 --> 19:20.900
a shooter meets a point and click adventure game.

19:20.900 --> 19:24.540
I don't know if you've seen that, but when you kind of talk about that, I mean, I'm sure

19:24.540 --> 19:27.380
you're not thinking like the same direction or whatever, but like that, I couldn't help

19:27.380 --> 19:29.020
it have that pop in my mind.

19:29.020 --> 19:32.540
But that's so funny that all these like different ideas, and I think it was, I was hearing a

19:32.540 --> 19:35.980
lot of that same thing from them is that this is the game we wanted to make.

19:35.980 --> 19:41.100
This is our vision, and we've got these two genres, and we wanted a game that had both.

19:41.100 --> 19:42.100
So that's awesome.

19:42.100 --> 19:45.980
Yeah, that's actually good, I would love to actually connect with them.

19:45.980 --> 19:52.460
And now that, you know, now with the first game being on Desura for a demo, and learning

19:52.460 --> 19:58.460
that Desura actually accepts demos for Unity, because Kinship's being made in Unity, we're

19:58.460 --> 20:04.580
going to get a demo for Kinship on Unity, hopefully in the next couple of months, hopefully

20:04.580 --> 20:09.420
within May as well, and finally tease that more as well.

20:09.420 --> 20:12.180
So yeah, there's some great, great stuff happening.

20:12.180 --> 20:15.260
You're going to be a busy guy in these coming months between this event in April and then

20:15.260 --> 20:17.300
these releases in May.

20:17.300 --> 20:20.780
By the way, since you mentioned you've got about 2,000 people that have checked out Crumple

20:20.780 --> 20:25.740
so far, I'm sure our dozens and dozens of listeners can help out a little bit and at

20:25.740 --> 20:28.100
least get that number up maybe 10 more.

20:28.100 --> 20:37.220
So let's go and give you guys the link www.desura.com slash games slash crumple, that's C-R-U-M-P-L-E

20:37.220 --> 20:38.220
if you want to check that out.

20:38.220 --> 20:43.460
And it's a very, the biggest important thing that I ask for, and I cannot stress this enough,

20:43.460 --> 20:47.740
please leave feedback in the comments, even if it means sending me a private message to

20:47.740 --> 20:48.740
let me know what you think.

20:48.740 --> 20:52.260
You know, if you're following me on Twitter, shoot me a direct message, whatever the case

20:52.260 --> 20:53.260
may be.

20:53.260 --> 20:57.020
I want to know what you guys think because it's very vital to the development, you know,

20:57.020 --> 21:00.500
the further development of this game, you know, but don't, you know, don't be an ass

21:00.500 --> 21:01.500
about it.

21:01.500 --> 21:04.580
You know, just talk to me, be constructive, you know, be constructive about what you're

21:04.580 --> 21:05.580
saying.

21:05.580 --> 21:06.580
Tell me why.

21:06.580 --> 21:08.020
You know, I'm not going to cry about it.

21:08.020 --> 21:12.020
I've got a very thick skin, I'm from Jersey, so we can, I can handle this.

21:12.020 --> 21:13.020
We good.

21:13.020 --> 21:14.020
You know what I'm saying?

21:14.020 --> 21:16.540
I just want constructive criticism because if I hear BS, all I'm going to say is plus

21:16.540 --> 21:20.540
one out of spite and move forward and I'm not going to do, and they're going to be like,

21:20.540 --> 21:21.540
what is he doing that for?

21:21.540 --> 21:22.960
Because I'm not going to feed to that.

21:22.960 --> 21:24.460
So that's all I ask.

21:24.460 --> 21:27.820
So since you brought up, you are from Jersey that led a spark in my head that I have to

21:27.820 --> 21:31.420
ask you about this because I will say the Northeast folks that I do know that listen

21:31.420 --> 21:34.700
to this show would kick my butt if they knew, I knew you were involved with this and didn't

21:34.700 --> 21:39.540
ask you about it, but you used to do a lot of stuff with Magfest right out back East,

21:39.540 --> 21:40.540
right?

21:40.540 --> 21:41.540
I did.

21:41.540 --> 21:42.540
Yes.

21:42.540 --> 21:43.540
Yes.

21:43.540 --> 21:47.620
I was, um, I, I w I just did volunteer work, um, at, at I think Mac Fest, not eight or

21:47.620 --> 21:49.020
nine, I think Mac Fest eight.

21:49.020 --> 21:53.500
And then a couple of years later I had moved here to, to, to Sacramento and reconnected

21:53.540 --> 21:57.860
with, with, uh, the team there and had asked them a couple of, this was a couple of years

21:57.860 --> 21:58.860
ago.

21:58.860 --> 22:00.160
I had asked them, Hey, look, what is it?

22:00.160 --> 22:01.900
What would it cost to get me a table?

22:01.900 --> 22:03.300
Cause I'm working on games now.

22:03.300 --> 22:04.700
I'm w this was when I only had kinship.

22:04.700 --> 22:06.500
I said, well, what would it cost to get a table?

22:06.500 --> 22:10.860
They're like, well, wait a minute, you know, w wait a minute, we're doing something for

22:10.860 --> 22:11.860
indie for Mac Fest.

22:11.860 --> 22:13.660
They're like, do you want to run the department?

22:13.660 --> 22:16.260
I'm like, we remember how you helped us so greatly with volunteering.

22:16.260 --> 22:19.820
I'm like, wait, wait, wait, wait, you know, I'm in California.

22:19.820 --> 22:21.940
I just want to show off my game.

22:21.940 --> 22:24.780
You're asking me to help run this new department.

22:24.780 --> 22:25.780
And yeah.

22:25.780 --> 22:31.060
And it turned out, yeah, my, myself and my partner Tronster, we, uh, we formed what is

22:31.060 --> 22:36.580
now Mac Fest independent, uh, video game showcase, I think M I V S I think that's what it stands

22:36.580 --> 22:37.580
for.

22:37.580 --> 22:38.580
But yeah, yeah.

22:38.580 --> 22:39.580
We've done it for a few years now.

22:39.580 --> 22:44.660
And, uh, and now there's talk for something more here, but you know, I'll leave that.

22:44.660 --> 22:46.300
I'll leave that for later.

22:46.300 --> 22:50.540
This was literally just like yesterday, but I, it's becoming more and more apparent.

22:50.540 --> 22:53.180
I have no choice, but to go to Mac Fest 2016.

22:53.180 --> 22:59.500
You have no reason to miss Mac Fest, I swear to God, man, because Mac Fest will destroy

22:59.500 --> 23:00.500
you.

23:00.500 --> 23:03.540
Mac Fest is four days of madness.

23:03.540 --> 23:04.780
It's just four days of nonsense.

23:04.780 --> 23:05.780
They don't shut down.

23:05.780 --> 23:06.780
My body is ready.

23:06.780 --> 23:07.780
No, seriously.

23:07.780 --> 23:11.340
Your body better be ready because it's like, it doesn't shut down.

23:11.340 --> 23:12.380
Like it doesn't shut.

23:12.380 --> 23:16.580
That's the thing about Mac Fest, unlike these other conventions where, you know, okay, we're

23:16.580 --> 23:18.740
closed at six or we're closed at seven.

23:18.740 --> 23:24.380
You know, Mac Fest does literally starts at 12 noon on a Thursday and does not end

23:24.380 --> 23:28.880
until Sunday or Monday, three, four, five o'clock in the afternoon.

23:28.880 --> 23:33.480
So you're literally, you have open access 24 hours to that four day weekend.

23:33.480 --> 23:36.620
That sounds like our beloved Dragon Con, which isn't games, you know, it's a different type

23:36.620 --> 23:37.620
of thing.

23:37.620 --> 23:38.620
But I love that.

23:38.620 --> 23:41.620
Like just 24 seven beer in hand.

23:41.620 --> 23:42.620
Let's do this.

23:42.620 --> 23:43.620
Good times.

23:43.620 --> 23:44.620
Good times.

23:44.620 --> 23:45.620
Uh, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

23:45.620 --> 23:49.300
SSJ100Matt saying the Indie Showcase was really impressive last year.

23:49.300 --> 23:51.380
He's out in that area.

23:51.380 --> 23:54.100
And Breakman with a question about your game here.

23:54.100 --> 23:57.780
How did you come up with the name Crumple?

23:57.780 --> 23:58.780
Funny enough.

23:58.780 --> 24:03.740
So Crumple, um, it is funny cause I was kind of debating what, yeah, when I was figuring

24:03.740 --> 24:10.180
out a name for this game, um, cause my biggest struggle was I know what I want the character

24:10.180 --> 24:11.180
to be.

24:11.180 --> 24:13.080
You know, that was one challenging part.

24:13.080 --> 24:17.680
You know, I stood the envelope up and as I looked at the envelope, I said that, you

24:17.680 --> 24:22.760
know, some envelopes have windows, but there was just one, I said, what if I add another

24:22.760 --> 24:23.760
one?

24:23.760 --> 24:24.760
There are the eyes.

24:24.760 --> 24:28.300
And then I'm like, now I've got an identifying character.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.280
Now comes the next steps.

24:30.280 --> 24:32.080
What, what can it do?

24:32.080 --> 24:33.600
What will it be able to do?

24:33.600 --> 24:36.240
And one of the biggest, biggest things was Crumpling.

24:36.240 --> 24:41.280
Um, and funny enough, this is kind of a, no one knows this, not even you, but, um, when

24:41.280 --> 24:46.080
we were in the process of when my pro, cause it's just a two man team for, for Crumple.

24:46.080 --> 24:50.920
Um, when Alex, uh, big, big shout out to my man, Alex, my, he's the programmer artist,

24:50.920 --> 24:53.520
the whole nine yards, the animator for all of this.

24:53.520 --> 24:59.240
Um, he, uh, when we were talking, I actually kept calling it Crumble and he had to correct

24:59.240 --> 25:00.240
me like a month later.

25:00.240 --> 25:01.760
He's like, Gabriel, can I just tell you something?

25:01.760 --> 25:02.760
I'm like, what?

25:02.760 --> 25:04.760
He was like, it's Crumple.

25:04.760 --> 25:06.260
It's not Crumble.

25:06.260 --> 25:09.000
You're confusing your envelope with coffee cake.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.680
He's like, please stop doing that.

25:10.680 --> 25:12.080
And I'm like, oh, I want coffee cake.

25:12.080 --> 25:15.240
But then I was embarrassed after that and I was like, holy crap.

25:15.240 --> 25:16.240
Yes.

25:16.240 --> 25:20.520
And when he did that, when he said that to me, I said, yes, that's what we're going to

25:20.520 --> 25:21.600
call it.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.240
We're going to call it Crumple.

25:23.240 --> 25:27.320
So essentially the title is at the cost of my dignity.

25:27.320 --> 25:32.400
The calling it something else entirely different, but it caught on and that, and then I said,

25:32.400 --> 25:35.320
now we have to emphasize Crumple.

25:35.320 --> 25:36.320
What is it?

25:36.320 --> 25:37.320
How are we defining this?

25:37.320 --> 25:39.480
So yeah, that's kind of where it happened.

25:39.480 --> 25:43.880
I do feel like you're, you're, you're pitching ideas for a sequel though, because you can

25:43.880 --> 25:47.200
have a coffee cake in Crumple 2, the Crumbling.

25:47.200 --> 25:48.200
You can have that.

25:48.200 --> 25:50.200
So just, just throwing that out there.

25:50.200 --> 25:51.600
Hey, it's video games, man.

25:51.600 --> 25:53.000
You can do whatever the hell you want, man.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.040
You can do whatever the hell you want.

25:55.040 --> 25:58.880
Dungeon Buster in chat over at live.vognetware.com says your body better be ready.

25:58.880 --> 26:00.560
That's the bagfest byline right there.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.320
Put that on the poster.

26:02.320 --> 26:03.320
All right.

26:03.320 --> 26:07.520
More information where we can check out nascent games and Crumple.

26:07.560 --> 26:09.480
Literally you've got a website, a Twitter plug away.

26:09.480 --> 26:10.480
Absolutely.

26:10.480 --> 26:11.480
Yeah.

26:11.480 --> 26:15.640
Funny enough, the website admittedly has been tough to keep up with because it's just me,

26:15.640 --> 26:19.680
myself and I for the time being, but nascentgames.com.

26:19.680 --> 26:20.900
You can see our stuff there.

26:20.900 --> 26:24.920
I haven't updated it in a while, so forgive me and don't hold it against me, but I am

26:24.920 --> 26:26.080
phenomenal on Twitter.

26:26.080 --> 26:27.080
I am amazing on there.

26:27.080 --> 26:29.960
So my Twitter handle is at nascentgames.

26:29.960 --> 26:31.540
So just hit us up there.

26:31.540 --> 26:34.880
And again, I mean, the good thing is at least, even though I don't update the website too,

26:34.880 --> 26:37.680
too often, there's a live Twitter feed connected to the website.

26:37.680 --> 26:40.220
So at least you'll see things going on actively on there.

26:40.220 --> 26:41.440
So yeah.

26:41.440 --> 26:46.080
And also, actually, matter of fact, if you want to see gameplay videos of both games,

26:46.080 --> 26:51.800
we have our most recent trailer for Kinship and our most recent game, well, I shouldn't

26:51.800 --> 26:55.300
most recent, our only gameplay video for Crumple on YouTube.

26:55.300 --> 26:59.120
We have a channel on YouTube, youtube.com slash nascent games.

26:59.120 --> 27:00.120
Yeah.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.600
You can check stuff out there as well.

27:01.600 --> 27:02.600
So.

27:02.600 --> 27:03.600
Awesome.

27:03.600 --> 27:04.600
Great.

27:05.320 --> 27:08.320
So I just wanted to check out that demo for Crumple and I will be checking that out too,

27:08.320 --> 27:09.320
for sure.

27:09.320 --> 27:14.700
I was meant to play it last week when I saw you guys at the event that you guys do every

27:14.700 --> 27:17.240
Tuesday, which I'll talk more about with Brie in a minute.

27:17.240 --> 27:21.280
I wanted to see that, but it's timing, I wasn't able to have the time to see it.

27:21.280 --> 27:22.280
So soon, soon.

27:22.280 --> 27:23.280
I brought it with me.

27:23.280 --> 27:25.160
We can plug it up to the TV later.

27:25.160 --> 27:26.160
We might have to do that during break.

27:26.160 --> 27:27.160
We'll make that happen.

27:27.160 --> 27:28.160
Might have that happen.

27:28.160 --> 27:29.160
I do want to spend a little time.

27:29.160 --> 27:32.680
I know we got to get to our gaming weeks and the news and everything, but I can't just...

27:32.680 --> 27:33.680
Brie's been so patient.

27:33.760 --> 27:34.760
Yes, no, definitely.

27:34.760 --> 27:38.560
I want to talk to Brie a little bit here about what she does with the IGDA.

27:38.560 --> 27:44.120
Now Brie, I know you're not necessarily creating games, but like, you know, as Gabriel was

27:44.120 --> 27:47.320
saying before, sometimes game developers need help.

27:47.320 --> 27:50.520
And I know a lot of that help, and I need it with running a podcast, is the business

27:50.520 --> 27:51.520
end of things.

27:51.520 --> 27:52.520
Right?

27:52.520 --> 27:54.260
Yes, that's true.

27:54.260 --> 27:58.040
So my background is in performing arts.

27:58.040 --> 28:03.160
And I grew up loving games and it wasn't until I met with Gabriel that everything was kind

28:03.160 --> 28:08.360
of put together for me as far as it's not just the programming, it's not just the art,

28:08.360 --> 28:12.640
there's also the music component, and then the business aspect as well, especially for

28:12.640 --> 28:14.720
our local developers here.

28:14.720 --> 28:19.240
Many of them are startup companies or getting ready to become a startup company.

28:19.240 --> 28:23.760
And we, as part of the IGDA, we want to help encourage them to build a strong foundation

28:23.760 --> 28:26.460
because we want them to be long lasting.

28:26.460 --> 28:27.520
That's very important.

28:27.520 --> 28:33.240
And especially with Gabriel kind of leading the charge with that, as well as a few of

28:33.240 --> 28:37.400
the other established studios here, we're all kind of growing together.

28:37.400 --> 28:43.180
And so yeah, my whole role in this wonderful world of game development here in Sacramento

28:43.180 --> 28:45.720
is I'm kind of the storyteller.

28:45.720 --> 28:50.240
I like to be the voice for our chapter and for our developers.

28:50.240 --> 28:53.280
Again, we are in Sacramento, California.

28:53.280 --> 28:55.280
We're a lot different than the Bay Area.

28:55.280 --> 28:59.160
But we're the capital of California, and there was no presence here at all.

28:59.160 --> 29:02.640
So now we have the attention of the United Kingdom.

29:02.640 --> 29:08.600
We have IGDA Australia that's a little jealous of our networking and mingle events.

29:08.600 --> 29:14.400
Yeah, you know, before I really knew you guys, I would try to explain like game development

29:14.400 --> 29:17.760
in Sacramento, and I'd be like, well, there's that building downtown.

29:17.760 --> 29:18.760
It's BioWare.

29:18.760 --> 29:20.120
Oh, wait, no, no, no, it's EA.

29:20.120 --> 29:24.400
Wait, no, no, no, you know, but that's all, you know, I could really think about.

29:24.400 --> 29:29.940
But there's tons that I'm not, I haven't been seeing until you guys have been getting bigger.

29:29.940 --> 29:30.940
There are.

29:30.940 --> 29:35.440
So when I was speaking with Gabriel yesterday during our last progressive game jam, you

29:35.440 --> 29:39.880
know, we've had people come through and we kind of made sense where we have all these

29:39.880 --> 29:40.960
different components.

29:40.960 --> 29:46.400
We have the established studios, the AAA studios, and then our scene, the indie scene.

29:46.400 --> 29:51.040
And now as IGDA, I think we're all just trying to put that together so that we all start

29:51.040 --> 29:54.960
working together to help grow together.

29:54.960 --> 29:55.960
It's all about togetherness.

29:55.960 --> 29:56.960
That's great.

29:56.960 --> 29:57.960
That's great.

29:57.960 --> 29:58.960
Tell me a little bit.

29:58.960 --> 30:02.480
Here on the show a couple weeks ago, I focused a lot on PAX East because I was out at Penny

30:02.480 --> 30:06.080
Arcade Expo in Boston, so I talked a little bit about my experiences there.

30:06.080 --> 30:09.200
But meanwhile, at the same time, GDC was going on.

30:09.200 --> 30:12.340
So when you're talking about togetherness, my mind goes, well, that's the time when they're

30:12.340 --> 30:14.160
all together is GDC.

30:14.160 --> 30:16.640
Tell me a little bit about your experiences at GDC this year.

30:16.640 --> 30:22.640
So at the top of the show, I said, haha, I'm so glad to be here because I'm a casual gamer.

30:22.640 --> 30:25.560
I hope your chat room is blowing up right now.

30:25.560 --> 30:31.640
Because once you guys start getting into details, it's not that like it goes over my head.

30:31.640 --> 30:32.880
I'm just not there yet.

30:32.880 --> 30:34.120
I am in my Renaissance.

30:34.120 --> 30:36.920
So GDC for me was mind blowing.

30:36.920 --> 30:41.800
I mean, you're hearing it here first.

30:41.800 --> 30:45.240
I get so anxious playing games in front of other people.

30:45.240 --> 30:51.440
So to be at a conference with 24,000 developers from around the world freaked me out.

30:51.440 --> 30:55.840
But I loved it because the workshops were incredible, very informative.

30:55.840 --> 30:58.320
They had a whole retro section.

30:58.320 --> 31:03.200
I kind of, you know, I had my business workshops that I went to, but then I just kind of walked

31:03.200 --> 31:04.200
around and played games.

31:04.200 --> 31:10.280
And I thought that was the coolest thing because none of my other boring conferences had that.

31:10.280 --> 31:14.480
But you will not be here to promote a Twitch channel tonight if you don't.

31:14.480 --> 31:21.300
So I'm trying to figure out how to get myself on Twitch because I think I'd be pretty entertaining.

31:21.300 --> 31:24.360
So even though you just said, I don't like to play games in front of other people, you're

31:24.360 --> 31:25.880
like, but you know what, I'm just going to throw caution.

31:25.880 --> 31:27.400
I know what you should play.

31:27.400 --> 31:29.440
You need to play Hatoful Boyfriend on Twitch.

31:29.440 --> 31:31.440
That would be hilarious.

31:31.440 --> 31:32.440
I'm unaware of this.

31:32.440 --> 31:35.440
It's a pigeon dating simulator.

31:35.440 --> 31:41.880
Oh, but it's got like a, once you've dated all the pigeons, then it has like this really

31:41.880 --> 31:45.660
like morbid, whole full storyline.

31:45.660 --> 31:47.400
It's really wrong and hilarious.

31:47.400 --> 31:52.140
See, there's a whole world that I have yet to explore and you guys need to help open

31:52.140 --> 31:53.140
my perspective.

31:53.140 --> 31:54.140
All right.

31:54.140 --> 31:55.140
You got it.

31:55.140 --> 31:56.140
We got your back.

31:56.140 --> 31:57.140
We got your back.

31:57.140 --> 31:58.140
Just don't, don't listen to them.

31:58.140 --> 32:00.320
Don't listen to the games that my chatters say you should play because then you'll be

32:00.320 --> 32:04.880
doing nothing but Five Nights at Freddy's, Amnesia, and scary games.

32:04.880 --> 32:09.120
Mister, I haven't played Five Nights at Freddy's 2 after Jamie bought it for him.

32:09.120 --> 32:10.120
Anyway.

32:10.120 --> 32:11.120
I'm open.

32:11.360 --> 32:12.360
All right.

32:12.360 --> 32:13.360
All right.

32:13.360 --> 32:17.280
Let's talk a little bit about the event we're going to be broadcasting from on April 11th.

32:17.280 --> 32:19.560
What can folks look forward to seeing?

32:19.560 --> 32:23.520
I mean, again, a very small portion of our audience is actually in Sacramento, so I have

32:23.520 --> 32:27.000
to kind of look at the bigger picture about what everybody's going to hear nationwide.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.880
But what can folks kind of look forward to coming out of this event?

32:30.880 --> 32:34.960
So Gabriel, would you like to chime in?

32:34.960 --> 32:35.960
Love it.

32:35.960 --> 32:36.960
Love it.

32:36.960 --> 32:37.960
You're adorable.

32:37.960 --> 32:45.920
The, you know, we, the main thing is, you know, we're, we're, it's a professional developers

32:45.920 --> 32:53.920
event where we open access to all gamers to try out these professional upcoming startup

32:53.920 --> 32:55.920
indie studios.

32:55.920 --> 33:00.320
And like I mentioned earlier, you know, it's, it's going to be in your face and there's

33:00.320 --> 33:06.320
going to be, you know, at least 15 game developers, a couple, I think at least one, at least one

33:06.360 --> 33:11.400
maybe two is, is an indie studio bringing the Oculus Rift.

33:11.400 --> 33:13.600
They brought it last year and it was huge.

33:13.600 --> 33:15.560
It was a huge, it was, it was a huge response.

33:15.560 --> 33:21.280
I mean, but fortunately it was a huge response for all the teams, all the studios.

33:21.280 --> 33:23.560
You know, so we're going to have more of that this year.

33:23.560 --> 33:30.080
I think it's, there's a greater, there's a greater scale now because, and I want to say

33:30.080 --> 33:36.280
a huge achievement, which is so Xbox language talk, but anyway, it's, you know, but it's

33:36.280 --> 33:43.280
like, it's real stuff here because this year Kate Edwards, she's the director, the executive

33:44.640 --> 33:47.020
director for all of IGDA.

33:47.020 --> 33:52.560
She's going to be here to, as the keynote speaker for our little local chapter event.

33:52.560 --> 33:57.520
So the president of the IGDA, the top, the top dog, she will be here, is going to be

33:57.520 --> 34:02.580
here and we're going to, we're going to, if, if hopefully I'm 99% sure we're going to bring

34:02.580 --> 34:05.240
her to you on, on VOG and you can check it out.

34:05.240 --> 34:06.440
You guys are.

34:06.440 --> 34:11.060
And that's a huge, huge step for us because that means they see what we're doing.

34:11.060 --> 34:12.640
She sees it, she values it.

34:12.640 --> 34:17.340
She saw it at GDC because we made our chapter known at GDC.

34:17.340 --> 34:19.740
It wasn't just a social gathering.

34:19.740 --> 34:25.740
I said, we're turning this into a demo night and we, that's what we did.

34:25.740 --> 34:28.240
So we, you know, so it was great to have that.

34:28.240 --> 34:33.340
So she saw that other people that we're going to have speaking, we have Jeff Louie from

34:33.340 --> 34:38.740
Capsity, which is where we host a lot of our IGDA events and even my own startup studio

34:38.740 --> 34:42.180
where I meet with my team and we, we work on there.

34:42.180 --> 34:45.940
And you know, so Jeff Louie, you know, big, you know, founder of Capsity, he's going to

34:45.940 --> 34:47.340
be there speaking as well.

34:47.340 --> 34:51.420
We, you know, we have Deborah Mirimoto from California Capital.

34:51.420 --> 34:57.260
She's all about minority owned women, owned businesses, startups, providing resources,

34:57.260 --> 35:00.240
business resources, legal resources, all these things.

35:00.240 --> 35:05.320
She attended one of our events and spoke for a little while, you know, so we're getting

35:05.320 --> 35:10.380
this recognition, you know, you know, from these real, real deal people and, you know,

35:10.380 --> 35:16.080
and then finally our, our educational advisor for the chapter, his name is Patrick Cranley.

35:16.080 --> 35:18.580
He's a professor at Sac City College.

35:18.580 --> 35:23.880
He's going to soon be running the entire game developer program for Sac City College.

35:23.880 --> 35:27.460
He's going to be speaking as well and it's just a huge deal.

35:27.460 --> 35:31.860
So we're going to have a lot of, there's going to be a lot of guidance and education, you

35:31.860 --> 35:33.000
know, you know, advice.

35:33.000 --> 35:37.820
So I was just going to say, we've had like kind of a running theme on VOG Network practically

35:37.820 --> 35:41.220
this year about like, you know, yes, you can make a game, you know, and sometimes it's

35:41.220 --> 35:44.180
going to, it's going to be very difficult and it can be very time consuming, but you

35:44.180 --> 35:48.060
know, yes, you can make a game and there's a lot of people out there that may not even

35:48.060 --> 35:52.820
know like where I want to make a game and I, I'm starting to get that technical know

35:52.820 --> 35:54.820
how and just, but now what do I do with it?

35:54.820 --> 35:55.820
How do I get noticed?

35:55.820 --> 35:56.820
How do I get bigger?

35:57.820 --> 36:02.700
I love how you said that you're going to let all the gamers get access to this information.

36:02.700 --> 36:06.820
Like we can all see how the sausage is made type of thing and I, no, I think that's excellent.

36:06.820 --> 36:07.820
I think that's great.

36:07.820 --> 36:08.820
I, I'm still looking forward to that myself.

36:08.820 --> 36:09.820
You said sausage.

36:09.820 --> 36:10.820
It's what it is.

36:10.820 --> 36:15.420
It's not a, it's not a, why y'all got to take it to a nasty place?

36:15.420 --> 36:16.820
It's not a nasty thing.

36:16.820 --> 36:17.820
All right.

36:17.820 --> 36:18.820
Anyway.

36:18.820 --> 36:21.620
And now I'm going to get all serious again.

36:21.620 --> 36:26.780
And that's what I found at least in my promoting of the event with people around the area is

36:26.780 --> 36:30.580
you know, I'm talking to parents who have younger kids that very passionate about their

36:30.580 --> 36:33.980
video games, but you know, they don't have the experience that we do with some of the

36:33.980 --> 36:36.780
retro games and to see where it's at now.

36:36.780 --> 36:39.620
So they, their kids are like, I want to make a game.

36:39.620 --> 36:40.820
I want to learn how to make game.

36:40.820 --> 36:42.580
I don't know where to go.

36:42.580 --> 36:43.880
Please come to our event.

36:43.880 --> 36:48.740
Because what we found in our own chapter is we're working with gentlemen and a few ladies

36:48.740 --> 36:53.380
that are, you know, in their late thirties that are just now getting to do what they

36:53.380 --> 36:54.980
love to do.

36:54.980 --> 36:58.140
And we don't want kids to wait that long.

36:58.140 --> 37:02.380
So there's really a bigger picture going on here and we want the entire community, the

37:02.380 --> 37:07.820
whole region to come and see, and who knows what's going to be ignited within that.

37:07.820 --> 37:08.820
That is so powerful.

37:08.820 --> 37:12.940
That really, I mean, truly just that, that really just lays it out right there that like,

37:12.940 --> 37:17.540
you know, you don't want some kid thinking they can't do it and wait until they're, you

37:17.540 --> 37:19.900
know, my age to do it.

37:19.900 --> 37:20.900
Yeah.

37:20.900 --> 37:24.020
And, and I was, I was one of those, actually what she just said.

37:24.060 --> 37:25.060
I was one of those kids.

37:25.060 --> 37:28.660
I wanted to start, I had game ideas and I didn't know they were game ideas.

37:28.660 --> 37:30.220
I just wrote things on paper.

37:30.220 --> 37:35.500
I was nine, 10 years old drawing out highways and, and city, crappy looking city skylines.

37:35.500 --> 37:36.500
Did we all do that?

37:36.500 --> 37:37.500
Yeah.

37:37.500 --> 37:38.500
That was like the big thing in grade school.

37:38.500 --> 37:40.700
You draw the dungeon and I'm drawing out the store, store.

37:40.700 --> 37:43.420
Okay now, so you're going to have to buy a rope from the store to get over the pit or

37:43.420 --> 37:45.180
you're going to get eaten by this little alligator I drew.

37:45.180 --> 37:49.980
I will say that the one my friend Ashley and I made in ninth grade in high school turned

37:49.980 --> 37:52.700
out to be a tabletop game I ran in college.

37:52.700 --> 37:53.700
Nice.

37:54.380 --> 37:55.380
That's awesome.

37:55.380 --> 37:56.380
There you go.

37:56.380 --> 37:57.380
Anything is possible, kids.

37:57.380 --> 37:58.780
You see anything is possible.

37:58.780 --> 37:59.980
And that's, that's just it.

37:59.980 --> 38:05.460
I do have to say though, I hope no kids are listening to this show, that whole salty thing

38:05.460 --> 38:06.460
we talked about before.

38:06.460 --> 38:07.460
Yeah.

38:07.460 --> 38:08.460
It's purely educational.

38:08.460 --> 38:09.460
It's so sorry.

38:09.460 --> 38:10.460
Not sorry.

38:10.460 --> 38:11.460
Yeah.

38:11.460 --> 38:12.460
The following commentary.

38:12.460 --> 38:14.980
We're not responsible on VOG network and its affiliates.

38:14.980 --> 38:20.380
But yeah, I mean, and that, and I think that's where our, our arcade event is going to stand

38:20.380 --> 38:23.660
out from other types of events.

38:23.660 --> 38:25.340
It, you know, other types of events.

38:25.340 --> 38:26.340
It's just entertainment.

38:26.340 --> 38:27.740
Oh, look at your famous celebrity.

38:27.740 --> 38:28.740
Oh good.

38:28.740 --> 38:29.940
I've seen you for the third year in a row.

38:29.940 --> 38:33.320
But no, here you're going to learn.

38:33.320 --> 38:34.340
You're going to have fun.

38:34.340 --> 38:35.340
You're going to learn.

38:35.340 --> 38:36.340
But we get to play too.

38:36.340 --> 38:37.340
Yeah.

38:37.340 --> 38:38.340
You're, yeah.

38:38.340 --> 38:39.340
And that's it.

38:39.340 --> 38:40.340
Once you play, you're going to interact.

38:40.340 --> 38:42.460
And it'll be nice to actually play with an Oculus Rift for once.

38:42.460 --> 38:43.460
Yeah.

38:43.460 --> 38:44.460
And Bree, here you go.

38:44.460 --> 38:47.340
I want to ask Bree, I want to ask Bree a little more and then I got to start to wrap things

38:47.340 --> 38:48.340
up so we can move on.

38:48.340 --> 38:51.580
I want to ask Bree a little more about the play end of this, because it's not just like

38:51.580 --> 38:54.940
lectures and things and motivation, but there's, there's play as well.

38:54.940 --> 38:56.980
But I do have to get some comments from her chat room.

38:56.980 --> 39:01.980
Dark Tetsuya over at live.vognetwork.com says, sausage is good.

39:01.980 --> 39:02.980
I love sausage.

39:02.980 --> 39:03.980
Thank you.

39:03.980 --> 39:04.980
Me too.

39:04.980 --> 39:05.980
All right.

39:05.980 --> 39:08.740
And Bobby Blackwell says, to be fair, we had to wait that long because we didn't have triple

39:08.740 --> 39:13.100
A level game engines available for low cost or free when we were in college.

39:13.100 --> 39:17.460
If Unity or UE4 existed when I was in college, I would have made games in college.

39:17.460 --> 39:18.460
Precisely.

39:18.460 --> 39:19.460
That's true.

39:19.460 --> 39:22.940
We had what, the incredible machine and you got to make your little machines in there.

39:22.940 --> 39:23.940
ZZT, right?

39:23.940 --> 39:25.900
Hey, don't be knocking, click and play, okay?

39:25.900 --> 39:26.900
No, no, no.

39:26.900 --> 39:28.420
It was all about muds.

39:28.420 --> 39:29.420
All right.

39:29.420 --> 39:32.820
Bree, tell us a little bit quickly about the play end of things.

39:32.820 --> 39:36.380
So it's not just this educational, but we get to play too.

39:36.380 --> 39:37.380
Right.

39:37.380 --> 39:38.380
Indie Arcade is going to be fun.

39:38.380 --> 39:44.140
We've partnered with Retro Gen 916 and every Tuesday they host a throwback down the street

39:44.140 --> 39:48.940
from us and they're going to set up a bunch of consoles, everything from the NES to the

39:48.940 --> 39:55.660
Super NES to PlayStation, the first one, and you'll have a diverse array of games to play.

39:55.660 --> 39:56.660
They have a virtual boy.

39:56.660 --> 39:57.660
And that impressed me.

39:57.660 --> 39:58.660
They have a virtual boy?

39:58.660 --> 39:59.660
That impressed me.

39:59.660 --> 40:00.660
Holy cow.

40:00.660 --> 40:01.660
Yes.

40:01.660 --> 40:03.740
We're going to have some Guitar Hero up.

40:03.740 --> 40:07.180
Bill from Davis Atari Party is going to set up a mini Atari party.

40:07.180 --> 40:08.180
Yes.

40:08.180 --> 40:10.060
Dan was mentioning that because we go to Atari party every year.

40:10.060 --> 40:11.060
My husband.

40:11.060 --> 40:12.060
He's coming up.

40:12.060 --> 40:13.060
Cool.

40:13.060 --> 40:15.240
We're going to have a preview of that.

40:15.240 --> 40:16.300
You guys are going to be there.

40:16.300 --> 40:17.900
So that's a party in itself.

40:17.900 --> 40:19.780
Oh, shucks.

40:19.780 --> 40:24.520
We're going to have video game tournaments, Smash Brothers, Super Smash Brothers, Killer

40:24.520 --> 40:28.220
Instinct and what was the, oh, Mario Kart 8.

40:28.220 --> 40:31.720
And there's going to be documentaries and live video game music.

40:31.720 --> 40:33.220
It's going to be a really great party.

40:33.220 --> 40:37.440
So it's not all boring.

40:37.440 --> 40:39.140
But the boring stuff is important.

40:39.140 --> 40:40.140
Yes.

40:40.140 --> 40:41.140
Yes.

40:41.140 --> 40:42.660
Which means Gabriel, stop talking about boring stuff.

40:42.660 --> 40:43.660
I got you.

40:43.660 --> 40:44.660
I got you.

40:44.660 --> 40:45.660
No, no.

40:45.660 --> 40:46.660
I got you.

40:46.660 --> 40:47.660
You guys are laughing.

40:47.660 --> 40:48.660
We can hear you guys actually talk even more.

40:48.660 --> 40:49.660
You can hear more of this chemistry, right?

40:49.660 --> 40:50.660
You guys have your own podcast?

40:50.660 --> 40:51.660
We do.

40:51.660 --> 40:52.660
We actually have our next...

40:52.660 --> 40:53.660
God help us.

40:53.660 --> 40:54.660
Yeah.

40:54.660 --> 40:55.660
Yeah.

40:55.660 --> 40:56.660
We have our next show actually on Wednesday.

40:56.660 --> 40:57.660
Don't sell yourselves.

40:57.660 --> 40:58.660
Sort now.

40:58.660 --> 40:59.660
Oh, no.

40:59.660 --> 41:00.660
Oh, God.

41:00.660 --> 41:01.660
Don't remind me about the podcast.

41:01.660 --> 41:03.460
Oh, shit.

41:03.460 --> 41:11.620
We have on the first Wednesday of every month, we do our own video game community type of

41:11.620 --> 41:17.780
news discussion and talk and ranting and so on and so forth.

41:17.780 --> 41:18.780
He rants.

41:18.780 --> 41:23.060
I just tweet because he doesn't share the microphone, kind of like right now.

41:23.060 --> 41:29.700
Oh, there's your preview, SacGamersUnite, at SacGamersUnite on Twitter.

41:29.700 --> 41:33.660
Tune in for more drama on Wednesday nights, 7 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.

41:33.660 --> 41:35.540
Why are you doing a three hour show?

41:35.540 --> 41:42.900
Can I say, I love that she has to interrupt you to actually plug the actual podcast, because

41:42.900 --> 41:47.060
you're not mentioning this is where you go to listen to it.

41:47.060 --> 41:48.060
It's on purpose.

41:48.060 --> 41:49.060
Oh, my God.

41:49.060 --> 41:50.060
You guys are hilarious.

41:50.060 --> 41:51.060
It's all scripted.

41:51.060 --> 41:52.060
Stay forever.

41:52.060 --> 41:53.060
You guys are great.

41:53.060 --> 41:54.060
All right.

41:54.060 --> 41:55.060
Okay.

41:55.060 --> 41:58.860
So again, so just one more time, the Sac Indie Arcade event is happening April 11th.

41:58.860 --> 42:02.840
That's 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Pacific on VOG.

42:02.840 --> 42:06.240
My understanding is it might go a little later if you're there in person, but on VOG, it'll

42:06.240 --> 42:11.000
be 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Pacific, and we're so excited to bring it to you guys.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.600
And I'm just excited to go and meet all this talent.

42:14.600 --> 42:16.880
You guys are helping to...

42:16.880 --> 42:20.520
It's kind of like we're watering the lawn, and soon it's going to look like my backyard.

42:20.520 --> 42:21.520
Absolutely.

42:21.520 --> 42:22.520
Yeah.

42:22.520 --> 42:23.520
Absolutely.

42:23.520 --> 42:24.520
Absolutely.

42:24.520 --> 42:25.520
And that's exactly it.

42:25.520 --> 42:29.200
Just the community, because we're all in this together here, and that's why I say I'm in

42:29.200 --> 42:30.200
it.

42:30.200 --> 42:31.200
I'm still learning it all.

42:31.640 --> 42:35.360
At this point, it's like, whatever I learn, I want to share with others, because we're

42:35.360 --> 42:36.740
all in this together.

42:36.740 --> 42:38.720
That's essentially what this event is about.

42:38.720 --> 42:42.720
It's a celebration of this talent here.

42:42.720 --> 42:43.720
Awesome.

42:43.720 --> 42:44.720
Awesome.

42:44.720 --> 42:50.120
And I hope folks worldwide will tune in to hear it, and not only check out some of these,

42:50.120 --> 42:54.680
what gamers or what game makers go through and what they learn about, but also some of

42:54.680 --> 42:58.520
these games that you might be playing yourself someday or shouldn't be playing, really.

42:58.520 --> 43:01.400
You can play right now on Desura or wherever.

43:01.400 --> 43:06.160
All these other different companies have their games hosted.

43:06.160 --> 43:09.940
I do want to ask one more very important question, and then we'll move into our gaming weeks

43:09.940 --> 43:11.600
and the news and everything.

43:11.600 --> 43:17.480
But I always ask every guest that comes on OLR, I got to know, favorite video game of

43:17.480 --> 43:21.240
all time, and defend your choice.

43:21.240 --> 43:22.240
Oh, no.

43:22.240 --> 43:23.240
Oh, no.

43:23.240 --> 43:27.120
And you can only pick one, one, one, one.

43:27.120 --> 43:28.120
Okay.

43:28.720 --> 43:29.720
I'm going to let Brianna answer first.

43:29.720 --> 43:31.680
Do you know why he's going to let me answer first?

43:31.680 --> 43:33.680
Because he's going to take forever.

43:33.680 --> 43:34.680
All right.

43:34.680 --> 43:37.840
I like Galaga, and I'm proud to say that.

43:37.840 --> 43:38.840
Okay.

43:38.840 --> 43:42.360
I've come a long way because I was very hesitant to say that before.

43:42.360 --> 43:43.360
But here I am.

43:43.360 --> 43:44.360
I'm saying it.

43:44.360 --> 43:45.360
Where's the Galaga hate?

43:45.360 --> 43:46.360
Is there a Galaga hate club out there?

43:46.360 --> 43:48.440
The Galaga's important.

43:48.440 --> 43:52.440
Maybe there was no hate, but I was still very intimidated to say it.

43:52.440 --> 43:53.440
I don't.

43:53.440 --> 43:54.440
Galaga's awesome.

43:54.440 --> 43:55.440
Yeah.

43:55.440 --> 43:57.440
When she said that to me, I was like, Galaga's phenomenal.

43:57.440 --> 43:58.440
What do you mean?

43:58.440 --> 43:59.440
Don't ever be ashamed of that.

43:59.440 --> 44:03.480
And yeah, we became real close after that as it was awesome.

44:03.480 --> 44:06.640
Especially considering Galaga's a shooter, and you were talking about shooters earlier.

44:06.640 --> 44:08.000
It kind of makes sense.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.000
That was unplanned.

44:09.000 --> 44:10.000
I promise you.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.960
So with me, oh my goodness.

44:12.960 --> 44:13.960
There's so many.

44:13.960 --> 44:19.200
But yes, if there's one that really, really hits home for me, and really life itself is

44:19.200 --> 44:20.200
Journey.

44:20.200 --> 44:21.200
Yup.

44:21.200 --> 44:24.200
No, wait a minute though.

44:24.200 --> 44:25.200
Wait a minute though.

44:25.200 --> 44:26.200
Let me be clear.

44:26.200 --> 44:28.200
Jamie's probably thinking about the 1981 game.

44:28.200 --> 44:30.320
No, I'm just kidding.

44:30.320 --> 44:33.760
You're not talking about Journey, the band, although that was an awesome game too.

44:33.760 --> 44:37.960
I was talking about the new one that I honestly have only watched people play because it's

44:37.960 --> 44:38.960
funny.

44:38.960 --> 44:39.960
Yes.

44:39.960 --> 44:44.640
Made by that game company who I had the pleasure of meeting both founders, Jenova Chen and

44:44.640 --> 44:45.840
Kelly Santiago.

44:45.840 --> 44:50.360
Kelly Santiago was a guest on our show recently, and I had the pleasure of meeting Jenova twice.

44:50.360 --> 44:53.840
Yes, Journey is definitely the life-changing game for me.

44:53.840 --> 44:56.400
There's so, so, so many, but Journey's it.

44:56.400 --> 44:57.400
Definitely.

44:57.400 --> 44:58.400
Interesting.

44:58.400 --> 45:03.120
You don't hear a lot of people picking a contemporary choice when presented with that question.

45:03.120 --> 45:08.360
Most answers I hear are either 80s arcade classics, like we got there, or Nintendo or

45:08.360 --> 45:09.360
Super Nintendo.

45:09.360 --> 45:10.360
If you asked me, I'd say Super Metroid.

45:10.360 --> 45:11.360
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

45:11.360 --> 45:13.360
See, there's just so many.

45:13.360 --> 45:14.360
Yeah.

45:14.360 --> 45:16.120
If you talk about the ending of Super Metroid, we can go on for it.

45:16.120 --> 45:18.800
See, Rob's wrong because actually the best game ever is the Guardian Legend.

45:18.800 --> 45:19.800
All right.

45:19.800 --> 45:20.800
Anyway, anyway.

45:20.800 --> 45:22.360
But you don't hear contemporary choices.

45:22.360 --> 45:23.360
Awesome.

45:23.880 --> 45:28.240
What was it about Journey that just made you go, this is it?

45:28.240 --> 45:31.160
This is the experience I've been waiting for?

45:31.160 --> 45:37.620
Because Journey took two characters, well, a character that had no identity, and the

45:37.620 --> 45:43.160
entire game it was all about it finding itself and its purpose for being there and why.

45:43.160 --> 45:52.120
And for me, it took me so long to find myself and have my identity, which I did not have

45:52.120 --> 45:54.240
until I got here to Sacramento.

45:54.240 --> 45:56.240
I didn't have that period.

45:56.240 --> 46:06.500
So the timing of the game's release was impeccable because I had just started on kinship.

46:06.500 --> 46:11.440
We actually started having an actual tiny prototype, and then I see this game, and then

46:11.440 --> 46:19.440
I see the story of that game company, and it just, yeah.

46:19.440 --> 46:22.480
It hits at the deepest core of me.

46:22.480 --> 46:23.480
So yeah.

46:23.480 --> 46:24.480
No, I hear you.

46:24.480 --> 46:26.720
I remember my first experience with that game, and I can mention this now.

46:26.720 --> 46:27.720
It's not really spoilers.

46:27.720 --> 46:32.280
The game's been out for years, but the big twist in that game was that you're not alone

46:32.280 --> 46:33.420
when you play Journey.

46:33.420 --> 46:39.880
You will be put in, I mean, it's online, and so another random person will be in your game.

46:39.880 --> 46:44.280
And with all the venom that's out there sometimes in the gaming world, and I know we've all

46:44.280 --> 46:48.480
seen the YouTubes of people that do really nasty things when they play Halo and so forth,

46:48.520 --> 46:50.200
Journey strips that out.

46:50.200 --> 46:56.040
You cannot verbally communicate with the other person that's there, but you can non-verbally

46:56.040 --> 46:59.880
communicate and you have other ways of making cues with that person.

46:59.880 --> 47:07.200
And seeing the way that people essentially invented language in a game like Journey was

47:07.200 --> 47:08.820
phenomenal.

47:08.820 --> 47:13.440
And I think for me, that game is definitely probably, I would agree, is in the top 10

47:13.440 --> 47:14.680
for me of all time.

47:14.680 --> 47:19.520
And I think the way that people, it was a game that made you invent language, or you

47:19.520 --> 47:23.720
could also choose to just abandon the person.

47:23.720 --> 47:28.480
And that says a lot about how people react in different situations as well.

47:28.480 --> 47:33.180
And I just, I remember not knowing that twist going in and playing it, and when I figured

47:33.180 --> 47:38.880
it out that the person that was with me was another person, was an actual person playing,

47:38.880 --> 47:42.240
I was like, mind exploded.

47:42.240 --> 47:43.240
Mind exploded.

47:43.240 --> 47:44.240
Absolutely.

47:44.800 --> 47:47.960
And it's so simple, it's so simple.

47:47.960 --> 47:50.320
But my god, what a powerful message.

47:50.320 --> 47:52.680
And that's just it, that's exactly it.

47:52.680 --> 47:54.840
So yeah, I would definitely say that.

47:54.840 --> 47:55.840
Amazing.

47:55.840 --> 47:56.840
Amazing stuff.

47:56.840 --> 47:58.080
All right, good answers you guys, good answers.

47:58.080 --> 48:02.560
And Dungeon Buster in chat, showing some love for Galaga, it's a big arcade classic.

48:02.560 --> 48:03.560
No shame.

48:03.560 --> 48:04.560
Yup.

48:04.560 --> 48:05.560
Absolutely.

48:05.560 --> 48:10.720
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Onge Radio at vognetwork.com,

48:10.720 --> 48:12.680
use the passphrase, smash.

48:13.120 --> 48:16.760
All right, let's get into our gaming weeks, the types of video games we've been playing

48:16.760 --> 48:17.760
this week.

48:17.760 --> 48:19.760
And of course I'm going to invite our guests to stay as long as they can tonight and chime

48:19.760 --> 48:22.720
in on our regular segments as well as the news.

48:22.720 --> 48:27.000
But let's quickly go over our gaming weeks, we'll try to make this a little quick tonight

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
for time.

48:28.000 --> 48:29.000
Dark Sakura.

48:29.000 --> 48:34.680
Um, I feel really sad because the game that IkumaJP sent to me and Dan, I haven't had

48:34.680 --> 48:38.560
a chance to play yet, because either he's been busy watching stuff or hasn't been home

48:38.560 --> 48:40.000
for us to play it together.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.440
So you have to do it together, yeah.

48:42.200 --> 48:46.320
It's the Kunio-kun, you know, sports game series.

48:46.320 --> 48:52.080
So like Super Dodgeball and all those, which is super fun.

48:52.080 --> 48:56.800
I did play some Final Fantasy XIV today, long enough to check out the Gold Saucer, which

48:56.800 --> 48:57.800
is...

48:57.800 --> 49:04.880
I still maintain that I hate Uldah, because it's worse to navigate than Orgrimmar was.

49:04.880 --> 49:06.480
And wow.

49:06.480 --> 49:11.360
And then, um, I, uh, what else did I do?

49:11.360 --> 49:15.480
Yeah, I did the first quest at the Gold Saucer, I'm kind of like, I played like a game of

49:15.480 --> 49:17.360
Triple Triad, I'm like, this is stupid.

49:17.360 --> 49:18.360
What?

49:18.360 --> 49:19.360
I love Triple Triad!

49:19.360 --> 49:23.080
Well, you can play Triple Triad for me.

49:23.080 --> 49:25.640
And I took Hot Wings out and tried to get him some levels.

49:25.640 --> 49:28.800
My chocobo is a red chocobo named Hot Wings.

49:28.800 --> 49:29.800
Nice.

49:29.800 --> 49:30.800
Yeah.

49:30.800 --> 49:33.400
Kentucky fayagra chocobo or whatever, that old joke.

49:33.400 --> 49:34.400
Faragga chocobo.

49:34.400 --> 49:35.400
Yeah.

49:35.400 --> 49:36.400
I bow to you in that.

49:36.400 --> 49:37.400
Oh my god.

49:37.400 --> 49:42.040
So, um, and I did play, um, I've been playing Dragon Age Inquisition, the DLC came out,

49:42.040 --> 49:47.180
so uh, been playing through Jaws of Hakkon, it's pretty okay, I'm just mad that it nixed

49:47.180 --> 49:52.520
all of my mods, because, and the modding community is plenty pissed too, but of course they understand.

49:52.520 --> 49:57.040
There's actually, a dude from BioWare went on Reddit, one of the programmers, and said,

49:57.040 --> 50:03.080
hey, we didn't do this on purpose, but we cannot accommodate for mods when we put out

50:03.080 --> 50:04.080
the DLC.

50:04.080 --> 50:05.080
Exactly.

50:05.120 --> 50:07.760
We have to bug check our own shit, we can't bug check yours.

50:07.760 --> 50:08.760
Exactly.

50:08.760 --> 50:09.760
I get it.

50:09.760 --> 50:12.920
Some of the differences, I was going to actually put that in on show roll, just reading from

50:12.920 --> 50:18.760
the forum on there, but I didn't, but he was going in saying that, yeah, Frostbite is a

50:18.760 --> 50:25.040
completely different creature than what they used before in Real Engine, you know, saying

50:25.040 --> 50:31.800
that it doesn't allow you, and let me start over, it doesn't allow for that type of maintenance

50:31.840 --> 50:35.680
of the mods to keep them working like it did in the previous iterations.

50:35.680 --> 50:41.320
So another guy on one of the mod forums, on the official BioWare forum, they actually

50:41.320 --> 50:48.320
got another guy in to pick up where warranty voider left off from the version of the modules,

50:48.320 --> 50:52.080
and they're saying that there's like, there were, you know, the code was pretty much open

50:52.080 --> 50:58.040
for Frostbite in the full release, but in the DLC there's like 72 lines of encrypted

50:58.040 --> 51:04.160
code that basically are what's preventing it from being just open source for everybody.

51:04.160 --> 51:10.960
So that's where they're getting into, do we break this or do we just stop the mods here

51:10.960 --> 51:12.760
or do we find another way to get it to work?

51:12.760 --> 51:13.760
Fair enough.

51:13.760 --> 51:15.980
So you've been pretty busy with the Dragon Age then.

51:15.980 --> 51:16.980
And writing fan fiction.

51:16.980 --> 51:17.980
All right.

51:17.980 --> 51:18.980
Fair enough.

51:18.980 --> 51:19.980
Fair enough.

51:19.980 --> 51:20.980
Loki.

51:20.980 --> 51:22.280
Loki, how was your gaming week?

51:22.280 --> 51:23.280
I didn't play anything.

51:23.280 --> 51:24.280
You didn't play anything?

51:24.280 --> 51:25.280
Yeah, unfortunately.

51:25.280 --> 51:26.840
But you're still working on your own game, that's...

51:26.840 --> 51:30.600
Yeah, I've been working on mine, and then, what else did I do?

51:30.600 --> 51:38.240
Oh, I also went through, because I had noticed I had some message from Indie Gala or whatever

51:38.240 --> 51:41.160
about some upcoming bundle that they had, and I was like, you know, I should really

51:41.160 --> 51:44.640
check these sites that I've been buying these bundles for to see if I've actually redeemed

51:44.640 --> 51:46.760
all my games on Steam, and no, I hadn't.

51:46.760 --> 51:49.240
So now up to like over 350 games.

51:49.240 --> 51:50.560
Ah, the Steam problem.

51:50.560 --> 51:51.560
The Steam problem.

51:51.560 --> 51:52.560
I haven't played.

51:52.560 --> 51:53.560
He's over 9000.

51:53.560 --> 51:54.560
I don't even know what they are anymore.

51:54.560 --> 51:56.560
I'm like, what is this thing that I bought?

51:57.280 --> 51:59.840
No, they had that sale this week, it was on PlayStation Network.

51:59.840 --> 52:00.840
I bought it.

52:00.840 --> 52:01.840
Was that the 10% discount?

52:01.840 --> 52:02.840
Or...

52:02.840 --> 52:03.840
No, it was the games under a dollar.

52:03.840 --> 52:04.840
Oh, the dollar!

52:04.840 --> 52:05.840
The games under a dollar.

52:05.840 --> 52:06.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:06.840 --> 52:07.840
So I had to buy like, like, oh, Katamari.

52:07.840 --> 52:08.840
Yes.

52:08.840 --> 52:09.840
Toes of Metal Black.

52:09.840 --> 52:10.840
Yes.

52:10.840 --> 52:11.840
And then you played none of them.

52:11.840 --> 52:12.840
Right.

52:12.840 --> 52:16.280
Because I didn't play any of them.

52:16.280 --> 52:17.280
That's okay, though.

52:17.280 --> 52:18.280
So...

52:18.280 --> 52:22.600
But no, I spent most of my week actually trying to get some confetti launchers to work correctly

52:22.600 --> 52:24.080
in my game, and they look nice now.

52:24.080 --> 52:26.080
You have to get the perfect confetti cannon.

52:26.600 --> 52:30.280
I did, I did have to get the perfect confetti cannon, and so now my confetti looks nice.

52:30.280 --> 52:31.280
I love it.

52:31.280 --> 52:35.200
Let me, I'm gonna go to Gabriel next for his gaming week, because, you know, we're hearing

52:35.200 --> 52:39.800
from Loki that the development of games is keeping him from playing a lot of games.

52:39.800 --> 52:41.800
Are you having the same experience?

52:41.800 --> 52:42.800
No.

52:42.800 --> 52:43.800
So...

52:43.800 --> 52:44.800
No.

52:44.800 --> 52:45.800
Well, instruct Loki on how it's done.

52:45.800 --> 52:47.040
What have you been playing?

52:47.040 --> 52:51.560
It's just time management, and maybe losing some sleep or whatever, sacrificing time to

52:51.560 --> 52:53.000
call your family, whatever.

52:53.000 --> 52:54.000
It's fine.

52:54.000 --> 53:00.960
Yeah, I, the games for this week have been Ori and the Blind Forest, Xbox One, stunning,

53:00.960 --> 53:05.560
stunning, stunning, gorgeous, but painfully difficult game.

53:05.560 --> 53:10.480
Should not be as difficult as it is, for as gorgeous as it is, because I think it's taken

53:10.480 --> 53:15.960
away from my, some of my experiences with it so far, but it's still a gorgeous game.

53:15.960 --> 53:19.720
Resident Evil Revelations 2, I was rocking that, I've been rocking that out this week,

53:19.720 --> 53:23.080
the full game, been loving that so far.

53:23.080 --> 53:27.640
And DuckTales for the Nintendo just came in for me a couple, yesterday, so I was rocking

53:27.640 --> 53:28.860
that out yesterday.

53:28.860 --> 53:31.160
So yeah, DuckTales for the NES, yep.

53:31.160 --> 53:36.480
Wait, like, you said it came in for you, so somebody out there is hunting old NES games

53:36.480 --> 53:38.320
and putting some aside for you, huh?

53:38.320 --> 53:40.520
Well, yeah, and then I got a really good deal for it.

53:40.520 --> 53:43.160
Yeah, I'm gonna need some contact information.

53:43.160 --> 53:46.640
We will, yeah, the retro gen people, I have surprised them with the games that they just

53:46.640 --> 53:49.120
couldn't find, but that I did, so yeah.

53:49.120 --> 53:54.000
And then I think the last game that I've been messing around with, Shantae and the

53:54.000 --> 53:57.240
Pirates something something on the Wii U, because they put it on discount.

53:57.240 --> 53:58.240
So yeah.

53:58.240 --> 53:59.240
I had that on Steam.

53:59.240 --> 54:00.240
Yes!

54:00.240 --> 54:01.240
Great game.

54:01.240 --> 54:02.240
Loving the hell out of that game.

54:02.240 --> 54:04.240
So yeah, that's been mainly my games this week.

54:04.240 --> 54:05.240
Awesome.

54:05.240 --> 54:06.240
Brianna, what about you?

54:06.240 --> 54:08.440
What kind of video games have you been playing this week?

54:08.440 --> 54:10.920
Just remember, new gamer here.

54:10.920 --> 54:11.920
It's alright.

54:11.920 --> 54:17.680
So my whole week encompassed two games, one of which was the Crumple demo, because my

54:17.680 --> 54:24.320
laptop is so slow, and I can't, I keep dying, I keep burning, and I keep dying.

54:24.320 --> 54:26.920
Do you hear the aggressiveness in my voice?

54:26.920 --> 54:31.420
That is what you would see on a Twitch video, because I think it's so frustrated.

54:31.420 --> 54:32.640
But you're giving all that feedback.

54:32.640 --> 54:35.520
Oh, heck yes, I gave all that feedback.

54:35.520 --> 54:43.180
And then the second game, I started playing just Friday night, the Fast and Furious free

54:43.180 --> 54:44.920
play from Xbox One.

54:44.920 --> 54:46.360
Oh, I want to check that out.

54:46.360 --> 54:47.520
I don't even have an Xbox One.

54:47.560 --> 54:51.760
Yeah, I downloaded that today, or I meant to download, or I just beat it today.

54:51.760 --> 54:52.760
Is it on Xbox 360?

54:52.760 --> 54:53.760
Oh, yes.

54:53.760 --> 54:54.760
It is.

54:54.760 --> 54:56.520
Oh, Gabriel's telling me yes it is.

54:56.520 --> 54:57.520
Yes it is.

54:57.520 --> 54:58.520
There it is.

54:58.520 --> 55:00.520
Sorry, just remember, sir, if you're not on a mic, they can't hear you.

55:00.520 --> 55:01.520
Yeah, that's true, sorry.

55:01.520 --> 55:02.520
No, that's alright.

55:02.520 --> 55:05.680
I yell out random things at a whim as well, it's just that this one's permanently attached

55:05.680 --> 55:06.680
to my face.

55:06.680 --> 55:11.080
So how are you liking the Fast and the Furious expansion, or I guess standalone side story

55:11.080 --> 55:12.540
for Forza?

55:12.540 --> 55:14.360
So I really like driving games.

55:14.360 --> 55:15.360
Me too.

55:15.360 --> 55:16.360
And I love Forza.

55:16.400 --> 55:21.480
I have the Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 2, and I forgot how much I enjoy it, because

55:21.480 --> 55:26.280
I was playing Rise for a little bit, and I have 3% left, and then I'm done with my first

55:26.280 --> 55:28.640
game ever, like all the way through.

55:28.640 --> 55:30.720
Do you hear the excitement in my voice?

55:30.720 --> 55:32.320
I'm so proud.

55:32.320 --> 55:35.440
I won't tell you how long it's taken me, because that's embarrassing.

55:35.440 --> 55:39.760
I can't remember the last time I got 100% on a game, because I have what we call here

55:39.760 --> 55:41.760
at OLR, Gamer ADD.

55:41.760 --> 55:42.760
People don't finish games?

55:42.760 --> 55:43.760
No, oh.

55:43.760 --> 55:51.120
It depends on who you are, see now Dark Sakura, you know, she'll talk about the same game

55:51.120 --> 55:56.240
for 50 weeks on this show, but she has explored every nook and cranny of the Hinterlands like

55:56.240 --> 55:57.240
you wouldn't believe.

55:57.240 --> 56:00.400
No, I did that on purpose, because I actually wanted to fill up the whole map and see if

56:00.400 --> 56:01.400
I could break the map.

56:01.400 --> 56:02.400
That's me!

56:02.400 --> 56:07.280
I have to hit every XP board, I need to drive every single race, and then if I don't come

56:07.280 --> 56:09.600
in the top 3, I need to do that race again.

56:09.600 --> 56:13.320
Y'all don't want to know what I did with Mass Effect.

56:13.320 --> 56:20.080
I have modded my Mass Effect to where it's all high-res mods, and custom hair, and everything.

56:20.080 --> 56:23.080
You're not alone.

56:23.080 --> 56:27.120
She's trying to push beyond, the Castlevania Symphony of the Night has ruined her, because

56:27.120 --> 56:30.080
she feels she can push beyond 100% exploration in Mass Effect.

56:30.080 --> 56:31.880
No, you can't do it on the Xbox version.

56:31.880 --> 56:33.640
Oh, that's right, I heard about that.

56:33.640 --> 56:35.480
The trick doesn't work on the Xbox version.

56:35.480 --> 56:36.480
I heard about that.

56:36.480 --> 56:38.480
The, what was it, 211%?

56:38.480 --> 56:39.480
Yeah, 211.

56:39.480 --> 56:40.480
You can't do that.

56:40.480 --> 56:42.480
You can get 206, I think, but not 211.

56:42.640 --> 56:46.160
Yeah, because you can't do the wolf trick where you do the wolf turn into the gas and

56:46.160 --> 56:48.520
then the bats fly outside.

56:48.520 --> 56:49.520
For goodness sake.

56:49.520 --> 56:50.520
I know.

56:50.520 --> 56:51.520
Yeah.

56:51.520 --> 56:53.200
Okay, my gaming week, I'll talk about real quick.

56:53.200 --> 56:58.640
I got to play a little bit of Bloodborne today, because my friend Shane brought that over,

56:58.640 --> 57:02.160
and I got killed a lot, and I had no idea what the hell I was doing, because you know,

57:02.160 --> 57:05.240
that's one of those games that just kind of throws you in, it's like, have fun, you're

57:05.240 --> 57:06.240
gonna die.

57:06.240 --> 57:07.240
A lot.

57:07.240 --> 57:11.160
No, literally, it's set at, you will die in the first five minutes of the game, you have

57:11.160 --> 57:14.520
to, there's no way around it, and I was like, what the hell, I'm getting killed by the

57:14.520 --> 57:15.520
first mob?

57:15.520 --> 57:18.160
What kind of sadistic fuck plays this game?

57:18.160 --> 57:21.480
And I knew.

57:21.480 --> 57:24.080
But it was, I gotta say, it is a gorgeous game.

57:24.080 --> 57:29.080
As much as I was getting frustrated by, how am I supposed to play a 3D game with my old

57:29.080 --> 57:31.360
brain, how am I gonna play a 3D game with no map?

57:31.360 --> 57:34.720
You mean to tell me there's no map in Bloodborne, what am I supposed to do?

57:34.720 --> 57:36.680
Use visual cues and landmarks?

57:36.680 --> 57:37.680
What is this?

57:37.680 --> 57:38.680
So.

57:38.680 --> 57:39.960
Dudes don't need maps.

57:39.960 --> 57:40.960
This one does.

57:41.480 --> 57:43.280
I will defy that stereotype.

57:43.280 --> 57:48.840
I need, I would love to put Siri in the game to say, you know, go left, up ahead, and look

57:48.840 --> 57:51.520
out for the werewolf behind the rock.

57:51.520 --> 57:55.680
That's what I would love to have, but not gonna happen, because, you know, then they

57:55.680 --> 58:01.600
would be, then they would be dumbing it down for filthy casuals like me, and heaven forbid

58:01.600 --> 58:02.600
a game like Bloodborne.

58:02.600 --> 58:04.680
So are you suggesting like a Bobby Blackwolf?

58:04.680 --> 58:06.760
Yes, I need, I need Bobby.

58:06.760 --> 58:07.760
Best friend.

58:07.760 --> 58:08.880
Bobby Blackwolf Bloodborne.

58:08.880 --> 58:09.880
Say that four times fast.

58:09.880 --> 58:12.400
Bobby Blackwolf Bloodborne.

58:12.400 --> 58:13.400
That's what I need.

58:13.400 --> 58:14.400
All right.

58:14.400 --> 58:17.600
Anyway, so I played a little bit of that.

58:17.600 --> 58:18.600
Just a little bit.

58:18.600 --> 58:20.760
I didn't buy the game, but a friend of mine brought it over so I could check it out.

58:20.760 --> 58:23.540
But I did play a little bit of, and I gotta give a shout out to this, I don't talk about

58:23.540 --> 58:27.960
mobile games an awful lot on the show, but there's one that came out this week, and I,

58:27.960 --> 58:32.080
a lot of you that are into this series probably are aware of it, but if you're not, I'm gonna

58:32.080 --> 58:38.320
mention Final Fantasy Record Keeper that just came out on iOS and I believe Android.

58:38.360 --> 58:43.680
And the last Final Fantasy original game that they did, the ATB game or whatever that game

58:43.680 --> 58:44.960
was called, I hated that game.

58:44.960 --> 58:45.960
I was not a fan of that game.

58:45.960 --> 58:46.960
It was awful.

58:46.960 --> 58:47.960
I did not, right?

58:47.960 --> 58:50.600
It was, it was just, it was finger swipey the game.

58:50.600 --> 58:52.280
It was just clean the window of the game.

58:52.280 --> 58:54.720
Like you just swipe your finger back and forth as fast as you can.

58:54.720 --> 59:00.440
The good news is Final Fantasy Record Keeper, I think is a lot more the type of Final Fantasy

59:00.440 --> 59:02.640
game we frickin' wanted out of a mobile.

59:02.640 --> 59:06.520
And this game is going to tickle your nostalgia bone.

59:06.520 --> 59:13.240
It's going to do a lot to your nostalgia bone because this game is filled with nostalgia.

59:13.240 --> 59:18.240
Meaning that you travel back and forth into different Final Fantasy worlds.

59:18.240 --> 59:22.480
And so you'll maybe play a little bit of the Final Fantasy X story, but you're not playing

59:22.480 --> 59:23.480
the game itself.

59:23.480 --> 59:29.640
You're just fighting monsters in classic Final Fantasy fashion and old bosses.

59:29.640 --> 59:34.900
But the party that you use can be made up of characters that you acquired playing Final

59:34.900 --> 59:38.360
Fantasy VII memories or Final Fantasy IV memories.

59:38.360 --> 59:42.620
So you can mix and match the party in these classic Final Fantasy fights.

59:42.620 --> 59:45.620
And, and here's the part that y'all wanted.

59:45.620 --> 59:50.740
They made Final Fantasy VII and X, and I don't know, I think XII's in there too.

59:50.740 --> 59:57.240
They made them all pixel sprites from the characters to the monsters and bosses, right?

59:57.240 --> 59:59.580
But you get all the classic music and all that.

59:59.580 --> 01:00:02.260
So I thought, now it is a free to play game.

01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:07.060
So they do have some, you know, money elements in it where you can get like better equipment

01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:09.900
and you can get some other things with a premium currency.

01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:13.860
But I was pretty impressed with what they give you for the free baseline experience.

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:14.860
Oh my Lord.

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:17.180
Damn me for having a Windows phone.

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.180
That sucks.

01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:21.260
Oh, they'll never come out for that.

01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:27.060
So yeah, I gotta say, Record Keepers for a Final Fantasy mobile game is pretty cool.

01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:28.980
It's worth checking out for free.

01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:30.860
Brianna can download it at least.

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:32.180
Let me borrow your phone.

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:33.180
Yes.

01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:34.180
Let me borrow your phone, please.

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:35.180
Love it.

01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:36.180
All right.

01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:37.180
So that was my gaming week.

01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:38.180
So quickly, some housekeeping here in studio.

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:50.260
lounge radio.

01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:51.260
All one word.

01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:53.780
We will get to the frugal question of the week a little later on.

01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:59.100
And as I'm mentioning every week until it gets here, we will be broadcasting live April

01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:00.100
11th.

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:04.980
We'll be broadcasting from the Sacramento Indie Arcade event brought to you by the Sacramento

01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:08.620
IGDA, whom are here in the studio tonight.

01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:13.300
Some of the folks from that and yeah, we'll be there live from 10 AM to 5 PM and you can

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:15.080
check that out on Saturday.

01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:18.700
And I'm hoping if for whatever reason you miss it, I don't want you to miss it, but

01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:22.700
if you have to miss it, cause like, you know, I don't know, WrestleMania is next Saturday

01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:24.580
as well, or two Saturdays now as well.

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:25.580
It's today.

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:26.580
It's tonight.

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:27.580
That's my joke.

01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:28.580
That's my joke.

01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:34.700
Uh, we're hoping that you'll be able to later after the fact, go back and like, listen to

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:35.700
it.

01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:37.620
We're going to try to archive it and all that good stuff so you can hear it, but please

01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:38.620
be there Saturday.

01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:39.620
Be there live.

01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:40.620
Darn it.

01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:43.720
Because just like we interact with you guys during the show, there may be opportunities

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:47.900
where you can ask questions in chat and we'll ask who happens to be sitting with us at the

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:48.900
moment, those questions.

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:51.260
So if you're not here live, you will miss out on that.

01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:52.420
Will there be loot?

01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:53.420
Check that out.

01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:54.420
Will there be loot?

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:55.420
Probably.

01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:56.420
Probably.

01:01:56.420 --> 01:02:01.060
I'll talk to Bobby about that on a vognetwork.com special loot, uh, available, um, loot in person

01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:02.060
as well.

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:05.740
Right now through vognetwork.com, you can do the whole digital loot.

01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:09.140
Uh, if you're a member of the site, which is free, we don't charge for that.

01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:10.140
That's not cool.

01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:15.060
So you can go there and you get, we're not going to, you can actually get like loot just

01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:17.780
for participating with the site and checking into shows.

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:21.420
If you're listening live, you check in, you get, you know, a little something, something,

01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:22.420
some points.

01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:27.500
Uh, and then, um, uh, if you listen to the podcast, there's a word hidden somewhere in

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:28.500
the podcast.

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:29.620
You can use that on the front page.

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:33.860
You can check in and get, uh, points and that often leads to loot.

01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:37.340
Uh, so yeah, I'm pretty sure we're going to have some type of special loot for the Sac

01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:38.340
IGDA event.

01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:41.860
I don't know why we wouldn't, uh, Bobby and I just have to work out the specifics of that

01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:42.860
for sure.

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:46.340
But IRL loot, are there going to be, are there going to be giveaways at the event, the Sac

01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:47.340
Arcade event?

01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:48.340
We are.

01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:49.340
Yeah.

01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:50.340
Yes.

01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:51.340
Yes.

01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:55.660
We are planning that we do have a few, um, we did get a few, uh, uh, price, uh, sponsors.

01:02:55.660 --> 01:03:00.340
Um, and we are still working on a few more things that I can't just say yet because if

01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:02.820
it doesn't happen, then I'm going to upset a lot of people.

01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:06.140
But if it happens, then everyone's going to love us even more than they do now.

01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:10.260
But yes, we are going to have some giveaways, um, that we're aiming for.

01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:15.420
And uh, yeah, that's, I mean, I know, I know for sure there may be a couple, there may

01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:20.740
be for the tournaments, uh, amiibo, uh, yeah, Nintendo amiibo stuff, um, a couple, there's,

01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:26.620
I think, um, we have, uh, did we receive codes for, um, uh, construct, I think so.

01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:27.620
Yeah.

01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:31.980
So, uh, construct was the game, the games of development software, uh, very popular,

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:32.980
very popular.

01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:36.660
So yeah, so there, so we're going to have those as well, but there's still more stuff

01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:37.660
incoming.

01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:38.660
So we're good.

01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:39.660
It's going to be last late minute stuff.

01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:40.660
I already know it.

01:03:40.660 --> 01:03:41.660
It's very cool.

01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:42.660
You know what?

01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:44.660
Sometimes the best ideas happen that way.

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:45.900
All right.

01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:46.900
Uh, there you go with housekeeping.

01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:51.380
Let's get into some news and talk about what is going on in the universe of video gaming

01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:52.540
this week.

01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:53.540
There's been quite a bit, right?

01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:54.540
Logie?

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:58.420
Color me not surprised, but, um, they made the announcement that Zelda isn't going to

01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:00.820
make it for 2015.

01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:04.220
I know I'm totally shocked that they delayed the game.

01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:06.380
I'm relieved as a game developer.

01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:10.980
My schedule was around, it was going to be around that between that and star Fox.

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:11.980
Forget it.

01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:13.580
I'm glad because like, good.

01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:19.220
Now you've given us a reprieve technically, but anyway, I digress basically just reiterating

01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:23.620
that, um, they're not making it a priority to release it in 2015 and so they're making

01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:28.380
it a priority to have a quality game, which I don't think anyone's going to argue against

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:29.380
that.

01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:33.200
Um, and then also going on to further say that, you know, at E3 this year, they're going

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:35.900
to be showing off games for 2015 only.

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:39.820
Well, it's supposedly, we'll see.

01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:42.620
Well, I am all for Zelda getting delayed.

01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:46.060
If that's what they have to do to make the game they want to do, then yes, delay it.

01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:48.140
And we all know you've, you've seen it all around Twitter.

01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:53.140
The Miyamoto quote about, you know, a bad game is going to be a bad game forever, but

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:54.780
a good game, you know, is always going to be a good game.

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:55.780
I'm totally paraphrasing.

01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:59.020
I don't have the exact quote in front of me, but you know, delay it and make a good game

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:00.180
that people will remember.

01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:01.540
That's fine.

01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:06.520
But the reality is, and as much of a Nintendo fan boys, you might be, you have to realize

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:10.120
that was a huge tent pole for Nintendo's 2015 holiday.

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:13.440
That was something that was sold me a Wii U.

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:15.960
Now I'm not buying a Wii U until that comes out.

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:16.960
Right.

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:18.720
So what's going to fill in that gap now?

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:21.160
And that I imagine is what we'll hear about at E3.

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:22.160
Star Fox.

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.280
I mean, you think maybe they'll bump Star Fox?

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:26.360
I thought Star Fox was supposed to be a little sooner than that.

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:27.360
Interesting.

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:31.820
It was supposed to be a few months before, um, Zelda, but yeah, I mean, but again, I'm

01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:33.000
completely okay with it.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.480
I mean, I, I mean, I foresee definitely Star Fox, but I think they're going to be fine.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:37.800
They're going to come up with another surprise.

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:38.800
I just don't know.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:42.880
I, I, my gut tells me it's going to be a mainline Mario game.

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.240
And I don't know if that means they're going to try to crank out like a 3d land to real

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:47.240
quick.

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:52.560
I fingers and toes crossed galaxy three, I think is what a lot of us would like to see.

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:53.560
Yeah.

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:58.760
That's or even, and I'm even willing to go far enough and say, if they want to do a new

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:04.720
Mario series, you know, cause the game cube had sunshine, the, we had galaxy, if they

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.320
were to do a brand new Mario, I think that's fine too.

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:08.720
There is Mario maker.

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.480
That's supposed to be coming this year as well.

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:11.480
There's systems.

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:12.480
Yeah.

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:16.320
I kind of, I kind of put that as a, I mean, that's, I, I'm like that I want to pick that

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:17.320
up.

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:20.240
I want to buy that, but that's, that's kind of like a more like the kind of something

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:22.360
that should be out long before holiday.

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:23.360
You know?

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:24.360
Yeah, that's true.

01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:25.360
That's true.

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:29.000
So I'm very curious to see, Hey, I'll take an F zero remaster for the Wii U.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Thank you.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000
Nintendo.

01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:32.400
Amen to that.

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:33.400
Amen.

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:37.000
A remaster like Pikmin two or something dumb like that.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
I don't know.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000
We'll see.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.640
It's what you wanted.

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:41.640
You get Pikmin two.

01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:42.640
No, no.

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:43.640
Well, we'll see.

01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:44.640
We'll see what happens there.

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:50.240
Uh, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com dark Tetsuya says, I remember watching the

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:51.240
video.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:54.720
I could just sense that they would announce a delay to 2016, but I agree with Miyamoto's

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:57.380
philosophy on delayed games.

01:06:57.380 --> 01:07:00.640
Tiger claw says you think they would make a new super Mario brothers three.

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.480
I would like to see another in that series.

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:06.640
See, I kind of think that's the gap that Mario maker fills.

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:10.280
I think something, you know, you know, cause Mario is a huge universe.

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:11.280
Obviously.

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:15.000
I think something in the 3d Mario space would be great, but we'll, we'll see.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.960
Well, Mario 3d world was spectacular.

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:22.840
It definitely falls into prob, probably my top 10 of all time for sure.

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:29.160
Because, because that, because I mean, not since Mario world and Mario 64 has a Mario

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.160
game blown me away.

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:31.920
Like, like, yeah, I love galaxy.

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:32.920
They'll give me one.

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:36.040
I can, I just have to say, I can tell you're from Jersey cause you say Mario and I don't

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:38.480
hear that outside of east coast.

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:44.680
I apologize to the English language for my vowel misrepresentation, but yeah, I mean,

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:48.200
but yeah, Mario sunshine galaxy, not to discredit those games.

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:55.360
Those games were beautiful, wonderful games, but Marrow 3d world literally brought back

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:58.800
what was missing completely from a Mario game.

01:07:58.800 --> 01:07:59.800
Not then.

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:00.800
So yeah.

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:03.800
You know, so I can see that I can definitely see it, but if they're going to do a new super

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:09.600
Mario brothers game, they need to really change it up because that Wii U one, yeah, it was

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.960
pretty, but it was really just a remake of the Wii version.

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:15.600
So again, I think Mario maker is going to fill that gap.

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:19.280
I don't think we need to have two of those in a year, but I mean, I, I wouldn't complain.

01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:21.040
I'm not going to talk bad about it.

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:26.000
Does that mean we'll get a third Mario amiibo that everyone's going to like cream themselves

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.000
over?

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.760
I mean, seriously, be careful what you wish for.

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:30.840
Well, technically there are three already.

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:31.840
Don't forget.

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:32.840
There's the gold one.

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:35.680
Oh, well that's totally different than the other one.

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:40.680
I mean, they didn't just slap paint on it or here's, here's what hasn't happened yet.

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:46.120
And you know, it's going to happen is good use for those amiibos pipe down salty man.

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:49.680
I'm talking about pixelated amiibo.

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:52.740
There's pixel Mario and pixel Luigi.

01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:54.240
You know that it'll happen.

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:55.240
Oh, no.

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:56.800
It, you know, it shake your head all you want.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:57.800
You know, it's coming.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:58.800
Bring it.

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:03.920
They're going to, if they're, they're taking a page out of the Activision playbook, milk

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:06.440
that shit till it's dry.

01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:08.120
All right.

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:14.600
I'm moving on some other information coming out of Nintendo and that is a splatoon splatoon.

01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:15.600
Let's not forget.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:18.960
That's a game that's coming out before the holiday over the summer.

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:22.920
I think if some of the Facebook posts are to be listened to, but they're talking about

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:28.400
that splatoon is going to do for action shooters, what Mario Kart did for racing.

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:32.480
At least that's what Reggie Fils-Aime said, saying, quote, it's aiming to do for action

01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:35.440
shooters, what Mario Kart did for racing.

01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:38.360
Also saying it's a major new IP for Nintendo.

01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:40.360
The game is not just about kills.

01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:43.600
It's supposed to be fun no matter what your skill level is.

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:47.480
So we'll see more about, you know, the fun factor when the game is released.

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:53.720
That's going to be a fun game period because I've seen so many videos of that and yeah.

01:09:53.720 --> 01:10:00.080
It's very refreshing to see Nintendo finally bring us something new, new, new.

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.040
It just looks insanely fun though.

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:07.240
I kind of love the idea of, you know, Nintendo kind of realized, oh yeah, like shit loads

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:10.120
of people are playing Halo and Destiny.

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.920
How can, how can we kind of put our own spin on that?

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:15.200
And I think that's what you're seeing with this.

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:19.320
And I think more importantly with something like Splatoon, I think we talked about on

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:24.440
a previous episode, Splatoon is being developed by like a younger team, you know, a greener

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:26.240
team at Nintendo.

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:30.280
And so this is really a chance for them to say, you know, we're going to do our own thing

01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:31.280
and here it is.

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:34.840
And I think wasn't it the same team that did Animal Crossing, which ended up being huge?

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:38.520
I want, I want to say, I want to say yes, but yeah, I'm not sure.

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:42.440
So anyway, I'm just excited to see, you know, what they put together, fourth quarter game

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:43.440
right there.

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.600
You know, Splatoon is supposed to be out sooner than that.

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:47.040
No, no, no, no, no.

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.600
Animal Crossing.

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:49.800
I fucking hope so.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:50.800
I'm sorry.

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:55.400
I know some of y'all are over it, but if they, especially if they can kind of do something

01:10:55.400 --> 01:11:00.200
new with it, like that's my one wish for Animal Crossing is I really need to see them do something

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:01.200
new.

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:03.200
I want Isabelle the rampage.

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:06.080
You want to see a Splatoon crossover.

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:07.540
I want Isabelle to go postal.

01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:12.120
So you want Isabelle as a character in Splatoon, except her paint gun is replaced with an actual

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:13.120
gun.

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:22.600
As long as Tom Nook does not get her revenge through public works.

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:24.360
She'll just build a bench on you.

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:28.800
One thing that might be a bummer for some people is that Splatoon will not have voice

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:29.800
chat.

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:32.720
It has been confirmed and you know, rumors are going around about this, but it was confirmed

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:33.720
this week.

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:35.480
Splatoon will not have voice chat.

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:39.680
So you cannot communicate with your teammates online unless, I don't know, you do a Skype

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:40.680
thing.

01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:43.520
I know a lot of people that when they play the Nintendo stuff, they just have Skype on

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:47.880
their mobile phone and so I don't know, but for whatever reason they've decided not to

01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:48.880
implement that.

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:53.640
It's too bad they couldn't tie like voice chat to, I don't know, some sort of parental

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.640
settings or something that are on the console.

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:57.360
I mean, they have that, right?

01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:58.360
They can do that.

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.080
That would be very forward thinking.

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:05.080
Yeah, it's not, it's not heavily utilized and I, and I honestly, I don't blame Nintendo

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:09.080
for the voice chat thing because let's face it, look at what happened with Microsoft when

01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:12.620
they, when they created the party chat idea.

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:16.160
Everyone went bonkers over, oh my God, we could chat with our own people and not have

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:18.000
to worry about talking with others.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.800
But unfortunately that's exactly what happened.

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:25.720
And now no one hears anybody at all anymore when they play multiplayer because they're

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:26.720
in a party.

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:27.720
They're in a party chat.

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:30.360
That actually raises a good point.

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:34.040
Like when I played Destiny, when I played Destiny, it was all about party chat.

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:37.320
You didn't, I mean, I think that's part of why they didn't even put voice chat.

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:41.720
And remember voice chat isn't in Destiny if you randomly connect with people.

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:45.840
And I think that was probably half the whole, you know, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:47.560
you factor for some people.

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:48.560
Right.

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:53.520
And much more colorful language coming out of those mouths and half the factor of people

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:55.440
are playing in party mode anyway.

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:56.440
Yup.

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:57.440
That's true.

01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:01.040
And I, and I, and with this being on Nintendo, yeah, the last thing you need is a, is a 10

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:03.040
year old on Nintendo.

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:07.160
You hear it on Halo, Call of Duty, that's fine, but you don't hear parents getting all

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:08.200
upset about it.

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:10.520
But if they hear it on a Nintendo game, it'll be on the phone.

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:11.520
It'll be on the nightly news.

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:15.000
It'll be on Fox 40 tonight.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.160
Little kid hears fuck while playing Splatoon, film at 11.

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:19.160
First time ever.

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:20.160
Who cares?

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:25.160
That, that's why, why bother paying attention to your news channel if that's the kind of

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:26.160
news that they're reporting.

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:30.640
I mean, it's like, Bob took a shit today, you know, news at six.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:31.640
It's like, who gives a fuck?

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:34.600
Did he flush find out tonight at seven?

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:36.640
People do this stuff all the time.

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:39.400
It's like, I don't understand why any of this is news.

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:40.400
It's America.

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:42.140
That's why people watch it.

01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:43.140
That's America.

01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:45.760
That's why Jamie just has this look of disgust.

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:50.200
It was, no, it wasn't that it was just a line from Arthur popped in my head.

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.520
I think I'll take a bath.

01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:55.480
I'll alert the media.

01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:57.440
You all remember that movie, right?

01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:58.440
You went there.

01:13:58.440 --> 01:13:59.440
Talk about old school.

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:00.440
Talk about old school.

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:01.440
All right.

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:02.520
My mom's favorite movie next to Fiddler on the Roof.

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:06.920
Uh, I was going to say, I was going to say, she's surprised her daughter's a Jew now.

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:07.920
Okay.

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:10.320
I was going to say, aren't they going to remake Arthur?

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.560
And then I remembered they did remake Arthur.

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:14.280
It's just, it was awful.

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.280
Anyway.

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.280
All right.

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:17.280
Yeah.

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:18.280
Moving on.

01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:19.280
Speaking of watching movies, dark soccer.

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:26.360
Well, I do have something for fans of, of the walking dead, I guess.

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:29.740
Um, and who have PlayStations.

01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:35.580
If you are a PlayStation view subscriber, you get AMC, which didn't they play all the

01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:38.460
black and white movies and then they decided that they were going to be relevant?

01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:39.460
Yup.

01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:40.460
Yes they did.

01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:41.460
Yeah, they did actually.

01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:42.980
This is supposed to be American movie classics.

01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:47.140
This is where I used to watch Orson Welles presenting War of the Worlds.

01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:51.940
Actually what happened, Jamie, we got older and then suddenly movies like Pretty Woman

01:14:51.940 --> 01:14:56.180
are a classic and it's like, shit, when did I get old?

01:14:56.180 --> 01:15:00.620
Or like, you know, you listen to classic rock and it's like that song by Aerosmith

01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:02.380
that everybody's sung in high school.

01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:04.780
Living on the edge, you can't.

01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:05.780
It's like, wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:06.860
This is classic rock now.

01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:07.860
Hold up, hold up.

01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:08.860
I ain't that old.

01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:09.860
Oops.

01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:10.860
Yes I am.

01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:11.860
Yes we are.

01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:15.540
I wanted to cry when I was in Alabama listening to one of the classic rock stations and they

01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:18.540
played gorillas.

01:15:18.540 --> 01:15:24.260
I wanted, I wanted to find a possum cause it's the south.

01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:28.220
I wanted to find a possum and kick it.

01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:31.740
Take this possum, that's for gorillas.

01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:37.020
So anyway, they've got different access packages that are going to come up.

01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:44.500
It also includes IFC, Sundance, WeTV, and it's, right now it's only available in New

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:47.060
York, Philadelphia, and Chicago.

01:15:47.060 --> 01:15:50.740
So you get the three ones, which is Access Core and Elite.

01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:55.340
Access has 50 different channels, I'm not naming them all, except they have food networks.

01:15:55.340 --> 01:15:56.340
That's pretty awesome.

01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:58.340
For 50 bucks a month and then you get access.

01:15:58.340 --> 01:15:59.980
You can never watch enough Chopped.

01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:01.980
You can never watch enough Chopped.

01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:02.980
Okay.

01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:05.140
Do you want to know what my porn crack is?

01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:06.140
What?

01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:09.340
Watching a cooking show while eating.

01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:13.820
That's kind of like me, except I like to watch NBC's The Biggest Loser while eating Ben and

01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:16.660
Jerry's and then I cry and I don't know why.

01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:19.860
I can't watch that show because I found out what they do to those poor people.

01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:20.860
It's pretty bad.

01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:21.860
I can't support that show.

01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:22.860
I choose to be ignorant.

01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:24.860
Do they turn them into meat at the end?

01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:26.860
No, that's not how the sausage is made.

01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:27.860
Okay.

01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:33.220
Anyway, the last package is going to be like 70 bucks a month and there's actually a thing

01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:38.260
about it on Wired if people want to find out the plus and minuses, but AMC will be involved

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:39.460
in all of the channels.

01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:42.820
PlayStation Vue is on PS3 and PS4.

01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:43.820
You know what?

01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:44.820
I've never watched Walking Dead.

01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:45.820
I have a story about Walking Dead.

01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:49.220
Could that be because Walking Dead is on Sunday nights and we kind of do something else on

01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:50.220
Sunday nights?

01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:51.220
I have a story about that though.

01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:52.220
What?

01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:53.220
About my mother.

01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:54.220
Okay.

01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:56.500
I'm going to do my mom voice.

01:16:56.500 --> 01:16:59.340
You know, I thought that Walking Dead show was going to be kind of stupid, so I said

01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:00.980
I wasn't going to watch it.

01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:05.780
And then I was watching something with Michael, her husband, and I was like, hey, this is

01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:06.780
pretty good.

01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:07.780
What is it?

01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:08.780
He's like, Walking Dead.

01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:12.180
Well, shit.

01:17:12.180 --> 01:17:14.740
And that's my story that my mom told me while I was in Alabama.

01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:15.740
Bravo.

01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:16.740
Here's my thing though.

01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:17.740
AMC kind of needs a new show.

01:17:18.260 --> 01:17:22.420
Look, I'm not trying to insult the Walking Dead fans out there, but how much time does

01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:23.420
your show have left?

01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:26.260
Because pretty soon everybody's going to be dead.

01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:27.660
But they're still going to be walking.

01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:32.260
No, it's just going to be What's His Face.

01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:34.060
Looking all angry and rednecky.

01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:35.060
Awesome.

01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:38.060
With a gun, sitting on top of a pile of zombies.

01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:39.060
Go ahead.

01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:40.060
Bring it.

01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:43.500
No, because now you'll be able to play him in Silent Hills, assuming that is still happening.

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:44.500
And I want E3 to clarify.

01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:45.500
Silent Hills.

01:17:46.260 --> 01:17:50.260
I need Konami to clarify some things, please.

01:17:50.260 --> 01:17:51.260
All right.

01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:53.260
Anyway, it'll be on the gambling machine.

01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:54.260
Sorry.

01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:56.700
I don't think I talked about that yet.

01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:57.700
I talked about it on Bobby's show.

01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:58.700
I talked about it here.

01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:02.020
I was in Reno over the weekend, just on an impromptu trip.

01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:03.020
Trip.

01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:04.020
Trick.

01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:05.020
Oh, shit.

01:18:05.020 --> 01:18:06.020
Uh oh.

01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:07.020
No.

01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:08.020
Trip.

01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:09.020
That's how he got his gambling money.

01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:12.020
Guess who's paid for dinner tonight, y'all?

01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:13.020
Anyway.

01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:14.020
Wow.

01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:21.380
So I went up there on an impromptu trip, and I was playing some nerdy machines, because

01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:25.740
I saw a Jenga machine, and I was like, that reminds me of Gamer X. I'm playing Jenga.

01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:30.900
But then I saw a Dungeons & Dragons slot machine, and I was like, oh my god, they're coming

01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:31.900
after nerds.

01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:32.900
They're trying to get nerds to get old people.

01:18:32.900 --> 01:18:33.900
Oh my god.

01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:34.900
Old people don't know what this is.

01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:35.900
Yeah.

01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:36.900
They're gonna think it's the devil.

01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:38.740
Except here's the problem, Loki.

01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:42.620
Dungeons & Dragons was in the 70s, and so there's a lot of people who you would call

01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:47.340
quote unquote old people that were our age when Dungeons & Dragons came out, so...

01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:48.340
Mm-hmm.

01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:49.860
I'm talking about really old people.

01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:54.540
I'm talking about people that would have been, you know, playing Dungeons & Dragons.

01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:55.540
People older than that.

01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:56.540
Oh, okay.

01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:58.500
Like people that voted for the governor of Indiana.

01:18:58.500 --> 01:18:59.500
Like that type of thing.

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:00.500
Oh boy.

01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:02.900
Gotta throw a little shade while I can.

01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:03.900
All right, anyway.

01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:07.740
I didn't say misinformed, I said older.

01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:08.740
Buzzing.

01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:15.700
All right, anyway, so the Dungeons & Dragons machine made by Konami, I didn't even notice

01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:16.700
that.

01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:20.300
I tweeted about it, and somebody replied to my tweet saying, Konami frown.

01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:22.940
And I was like, oh my god, it is a Konami game.

01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:28.340
So this is, they've let Kojima go to make Dungeons & Dragons slot machines.

01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:29.340
Yep.

01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:30.340
I guess there's money to be made there.

01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:31.340
All right, anyway.

01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:32.340
I digress.

01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:33.540
Loki, what else is in the news tonight?

01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:36.340
I've gone from walking dead to gambling.

01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:41.020
So hey look, Twitch had a security breach, and passwords and stuff came out, so they

01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:45.260
reset your password, and is anyone shocked by this?

01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:48.340
Major website has a security breach.

01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:50.540
Loki, it's the internet.

01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:55.420
Things I put in the internet should be safe, because it's interneted.

01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:58.500
Yes, that's correct.

01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:00.700
That's how the internet works.

01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:05.620
The good thing though is they basically said, hey, you know what, well I don't know if it's

01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:06.900
good.

01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:13.260
Their quote was, there may have been a little bit of an unauthorized access to some of your

01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:17.260
Twitch user account information, including the possibility of your Twitch username, associated

01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:21.740
email address, your password, the last IP you logged in from, maybe some limited credit

01:20:21.740 --> 01:20:28.820
card information, card type, card number expiration, and some of the following, first, last name,

01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:32.580
phone number, address, date of birth, if you put that stuff in there.

01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:37.700
But hey, it's a good thing we don't store the full credit card number.

01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:42.820
But your passwords were protected.

01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:47.420
In the cloud probably, because Amazon owns it now, so it's in their cloud technology.

01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:51.020
That's a good point.

01:20:51.020 --> 01:20:55.340
But your credit card number's all safe in the cloud, everything's in the cloud.

01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:57.780
Nobody bad will get in the cloud.

01:20:57.780 --> 01:21:01.220
But they reset it, so you have to go do that.

01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:06.020
My thing is, I forget what my Twitch name is on there anyways, because I use it so frequently.

01:21:06.020 --> 01:21:13.780
Well, I'm Rob Roberts on Twitch, that's easy enough to find, but I was going to say, yeah,

01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:19.220
they made you reset your password, so there's that whole thing, but this is just your weekly

01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:22.340
reminder at this point, because it seems like we have one of these stories every week these

01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:26.920
days, but this is your weekly reminder, use different passwords on different websites.

01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:34.480
Use an app like what was 1Password or some of those, if that helps you out at all.

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:37.520
And two-step authentication would be nice.

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:39.200
Two-step authentication, always smart.

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:40.760
Which I don't think they have.

01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:42.480
No, I don't think they do.

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:46.360
Not yet, but maybe that'll come soon, who knows, so you might need it.

01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:53.240
All right, well, moving on, talking a little something different here about region locking.

01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:57.640
We talk a lot about region locking on OLR, and basically it all boils down to, why do

01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:59.120
they still do this shit?

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:03.720
It is on the internet, I can download it from anywhere, I want people from Finland to download

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:05.600
my demo.

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:07.480
Is there a reason to region lock Crumple?

01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:10.480
Hey, bro, is there a reason you might want to region lock that?

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:11.480
No.

01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:12.480
Yeah.

01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:17.520
It's not like there's any text or anything like that other than the title, where it's

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:18.680
like, what is it saying?

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:20.200
I don't know what it's saying.

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:26.880
Or complex and antiquated rights, music, laws that would maybe prevent that.

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:27.880
You don't have any of that.

01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:29.720
I wrote the music for it.

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:32.560
Let it go around the world, I beg it to.

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:36.960
That someone's not going to copyright strike that for some reason.

01:22:36.960 --> 01:22:41.480
My thought, though, is that they do have a lot of different, especially when you get

01:22:41.480 --> 01:22:46.840
on a console or something, where you have to submit your game to these different organizations

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:48.280
that do the ratings and stuff like that.

01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:50.000
It costs money to do that.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:54.800
I don't know how that works as far as if we just made it region-free, because obviously

01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:59.120
it's worked for Sony for the last few generations.

01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:06.020
Well, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PSP, and Vita.

01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:09.800
So they haven't really had any problems there, so I don't know how to get around it.

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:11.720
This could be something that could affect Nacho.

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:15.240
We're talking about games, but it goes even beyond that.

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:17.800
And this could be very interesting if this pans out.

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:22.700
The European Commission, apparently, this week said they want to remove regional limits

01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:24.400
on digital goods.

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:29.240
And one of the things they're looking at that's specifically cited is watching US Netflix

01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:34.540
from the United Kingdom, because you know a lot of other countries want the US Netflix

01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:36.800
because we have more stuff.

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:39.640
Granted, I want to say sometimes, though, it's the other way around, too.

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.000
They have things we don't have.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:46.480
Some of the BBC shows, I know, though, the BBC website used to have a lot of their content

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:47.480
region-locked.

01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:53.120
And they unlocked all of it, so for TV shows that are on, you know, TV over there.

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:54.120
Yeah.

01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:58.480
It's just sad that it takes Europeans, once again, not Americans, Europeans, it takes

01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:00.080
them to start this.

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:02.200
I don't care where it starts, as long as it...

01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:04.200
But it's like, we should be doing this.

01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:09.400
It's like, we talk all this smack about ourselves, you know, our egotistical ways, you know,

01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:13.720
the country's egotistical ways, and yet we, you know, hear the Europeans beating us again.

01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:17.440
I actually had someone I went to high school with unfriend me because I sent her the link

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.600
about how many things we are no longer number one in.

01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:20.600
Oh!

01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:21.600
Well...

01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:24.920
But I have my big foam finger, this is we're number one.

01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:31.520
But is there such a thing as, like, Japanese television, Netflix, because I want that.

01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:32.520
There isn't.

01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:33.520
I think Korea does, though.

01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:34.720
I think Korea has something like that.

01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:37.920
I want, like, Tekashi's Castle, all the episodes.

01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:39.840
I just want the Jdrama channel.

01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:42.880
Well, anyway, it might start in Europe.

01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:46.680
And again, this is maybe, this is just a new strategy that's being outlined called the

01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:48.720
Digital Single Market.

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:53.800
This will prevent companies from geo-blocking online services when it's not truly necessary.

01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:57.560
Now see, that's a gray term to me, and that's what's going to take a while to figure out

01:24:57.560 --> 01:24:59.400
what is necessary.

01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:03.360
But the type of arbitrary limit would not be able to exist in a single European Union-wide

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:05.080
digital marketplace.

01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:11.160
So more information supposedly coming in May when the full strategy is due.

01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:14.920
But yeah, you would not have to, you would not get locked out.

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:18.760
You could watch French Netflix while you're in Germany, whatever.

01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:20.320
That is all going to be the European Union.

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:24.100
Now, keep in mind, because it's the European Union, that isn't necessarily going to have

01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:26.200
an impact on us in America.

01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:30.000
But again, if we start hearing about all the good shit they have over there, one thing

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.920
Americans are really good at is complaining.

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:37.960
So we're going to start complaining to Netflix in droves, well, I can't hear you.

01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:38.960
You raised my prices.

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:41.040
There's a fly in my soup.

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:42.040
You raised my prices.

01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:43.880
Give me European content.

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:46.920
So that is one, but we are number one in complaining.

01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:48.960
I don't think anybody's going to dispute me there.

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:49.960
Nope.

01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:50.960
All right.

01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:56.040
Anyhow, just an interesting statistic that goes along with that, that might explain why

01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:58.200
this is happening, by the way.

01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:09.200
9% of console games sold digitally in 2014, 58% of PC games sold digitally in 2014.

01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:16.800
Now that's Germany, and that's the second biggest video game market after the UK.

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:21.800
But you've got to think, those numbers probably aren't drastically different here in the U.S.

01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:23.400
I don't imagine so.

01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:28.320
Especially when you see how the PC shelf space is shrinking at a place like GameStop.

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:30.440
I wonder if it's higher here.

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:36.680
And how many people, like Loki over here, with how many games on his Steam account alone.

01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:39.860
So I saw that yesterday when we were doing a game jam.

01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:45.320
One of my guys, Nicholas, he pulled up his Steam account, and I swore I saw probably

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:46.320
200 plus games.

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:48.040
I'm like, have you played all of these?

01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:49.040
Like, nope.

01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:51.520
I'm embarrassed to bring mine up.

01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:52.680
I would not want to show.

01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:53.680
I'm not going to show you.

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:56.400
If you ask me, I'm going to say, no, some things are private, and you shouldn't be asked

01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:57.400
about it.

01:26:57.400 --> 01:26:58.400
My Steam library is one of them.

01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:01.780
My PlayStation Network account's starting to get like that too now.

01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:05.120
It's getting pretty, with the crazy sales they're doing too.

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:06.120
It's something else.

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:10.560
Anyhow, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:16.240
Well, we haven't really given our friends in the UK, except for just now, of course.

01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:20.120
You know, in the past, normally the UK was sort of my big thing.

01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:26.800
There is a study out now about UK children and what they're doing that makes them pretty

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:27.800
lazy.

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:34.360
UK children are spending six hours a day in front of a screen, on average.

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:40.640
And this isn't necessarily just like TV, but it includes TV, playing video games, using

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:43.780
a mobile device, a personal computer, or a tablet.

01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:50.960
And this was based off of a survey of 2,000 children between 5 and 16.

01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:54.600
It's called the Connected Kids Report.

01:27:54.600 --> 01:28:01.060
So basically, it's actually, teenage girls are spending about seven and a half hours

01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:06.060
watching the screens, compared with 3.5 hours of TV viewing in 1995.

01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:12.180
And boys spend longer times, up to eight hours, in front of screens.

01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:16.820
So they clearly don't work in a call center.

01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:23.580
And then, love video games, where we spend 12 hours in front of the screen, but...

01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:24.580
Only?

01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:25.580
Only.

01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:26.580
Jeez.

01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:27.580
No, seriously.

01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:30.020
But basically, the big thing...

01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:33.740
One of these days, Dark Soccer, if somebody's gonna do something crazy, like create this

01:28:33.740 --> 01:28:38.180
headset where you just strap the screen right in front of your space, and the screen moves

01:28:38.180 --> 01:28:39.180
with you everywhere you go.

01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:41.100
Fox News at 6.

01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:45.180
VR headsets will make you blind, because the screen's in front of you.

01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:47.340
No, it's gonna be the game in Star Trek, The Next Generation.

01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:52.340
They're gonna play a clip of some old woman, or whatever, from a long time ago.

01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:55.620
If you sit so close to the screen, you'll go blind!

01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:56.740
There's my proof right there.

01:28:56.740 --> 01:28:58.220
It's gonna make people blind.

01:28:58.220 --> 01:28:59.220
Then it's gonna end.

01:28:59.220 --> 01:29:00.220
Thanks, Obama.

01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:01.860
But we digress.

01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:06.540
Anyway, the big thing is that they're saying that TV is actually less important to children

01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:11.740
who are using their DVR services more, and they pay for Netflix and YouTube.

01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:17.900
They watch that much more than actual television, than broadcast television.

01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:23.300
And another thing that was reported to the BBC is that the internet has become, basically,

01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:25.980
their biggest source of information.

01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:34.540
Now I will pause this in saying that I went over to my friend Becky's house last night

01:29:34.540 --> 01:29:44.460
to find that Julian plays an MMORPG, made for kids, called Pirate101.

01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:48.660
And he's talking about, yeah, I need to do this or else my damage will decrease, and

01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:54.500
I'm like, blink blink, you're gonna be playing WoW before too long.

01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:57.460
But I mean, it's the same thing.

01:29:57.460 --> 01:30:03.060
When I was seven, I was playing games in the 80s on my Nintendo.

01:30:03.060 --> 01:30:04.060
Same diff.

01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:05.060
Same thing.

01:30:05.060 --> 01:30:07.780
As you know, when I was seven, I was playing the ColecoVision.

01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:12.100
And I was getting yelled at by my mother, Rab, you're sitting too close to the TV, Rab.

01:30:12.100 --> 01:30:15.780
But I'm like, that's the only way I'm gonna actually be able to shoot the ducks, is to

01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:17.460
get right in front of the damn TV.

01:30:17.460 --> 01:30:18.460
Oh, no no no no.

01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:22.380
My mom was like, you're too close to the TV, what, can you not see it?

01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:24.420
And then, you know, three years later I get glasses.

01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:29.260
Because I'm nearsighted, I was like, well gee, mom, maybe that should have been your

01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:30.260
first clue.

01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:33.800
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games

01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:35.900
ruining vision near you.

01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:36.900
First in America, Loki.

01:30:36.900 --> 01:30:45.460
Yeah, so now we have one of the first expansions for Sims 4, Sims 4, get back to work!

01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:46.460
I don't want to.

01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:47.460
On PC.

01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:50.540
Story of Seasons on 3DS.

01:30:50.540 --> 01:30:54.340
On PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, they're kind of doing a bundle from Square Enix, they've

01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:59.980
got Just Cause, Sleeping Dogs, and Tomb Raider bundled together for $29.99, and that's the

01:30:59.980 --> 01:31:04.660
ultimate action triple pack, because, you know, they've got to race off some of those

01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:07.460
old discs.

01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:16.460
Toa Kidin, Kowami on Vita, and we've got MLB 15 the Show on Vita, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation

01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:23.380
4, as well as the MLB The Show 10th Anniversary Edition on PlayStation 4 as well.

01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:31.300
Also the Ultimate Stealth Pack, which is another compilation by Square Enix, including Thief,

01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:35.260
Hitman, and Deus Ex.

01:31:35.260 --> 01:31:39.300
And then we've got RBI Baseball 15 on PC.

01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:43.060
What else do we have here?

01:31:43.060 --> 01:31:44.060
Lots of baseball.

01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:46.300
It's all being released at the same time.

01:31:47.140 --> 01:31:48.140
Let's see.

01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:50.020
Oh, that'll be it, actually.

01:31:50.020 --> 01:31:51.020
We end with baseball.

01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:52.020
Alright, fair enough.

01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:55.420
Well, let's travel over to Japan, and I'm going to start off with a whopper here, because

01:31:55.420 --> 01:32:02.560
on April 2nd, Loki, listen up, Earth Defense Force is 4.1, the Shadow of New Despair comes

01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:05.780
out of Japan on April 2nd on the PlayStation 4.

01:32:05.780 --> 01:32:06.780
Do not say that.

01:32:06.780 --> 01:32:08.460
That is one of my...

01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:14.980
Oh, you two should be besties, because he talks about that all the time, Earth Defense

01:32:14.980 --> 01:32:15.980
Force.

01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:17.740
I even got Brianna into that game.

01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:22.940
She was, you know, yeah, ee-dee, yeah, ee-dee, yeah, ee-dee, text message, yeah, yeah, just

01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:23.940
incredible.

01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:24.940
Oh, my God.

01:32:24.940 --> 01:32:27.340
I saw the trailer for, wait, is that only for PlayStation?

01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:30.020
That is on PlayStation 4, at least in Japan.

01:32:30.020 --> 01:32:34.900
Remember, I'm reading Japanese release dates, so that's coming out of Japan, but PS4 region

01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:35.900
free, right?

01:32:35.900 --> 01:32:36.900
Or no?

01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:37.900
Yes.

01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:38.900
Uh-oh.

01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:39.900
Uh-oh.

01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:40.900
Well.

01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:41.900
Oh, boy.

01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:45.460
I was going to get a PS4 today, and I didn't, and I had to change my mind.

01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:47.540
They'll eventually release it over here, just...

01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:48.540
No, no, no, I can't wait.

01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:50.260
No, it's Earth Defense Force.

01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:51.260
I will import that game.

01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:52.260
I understand.

01:32:52.260 --> 01:32:53.260
I understand.

01:32:53.260 --> 01:32:56.780
Lego Batman 3, also seeing a release in Japan this week.

01:32:56.780 --> 01:32:59.980
I'm going to check the Xbox One for you, but I don't see...

01:32:59.980 --> 01:33:01.460
No, it was only on PlayStation 4.

01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:03.100
Yeah, I don't see Earth Defense Force there.

01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:06.940
I do see Dark Souls 2 on April 9th, but that's on the Xbox One.

01:33:06.940 --> 01:33:10.580
But that Earth Defense Force game is just an upgrade of, you know, 2048 or whatever

01:33:10.580 --> 01:33:12.460
the last one was that they had come out.

01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:13.460
Yep, 2025.

01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:14.460
2025.

01:33:14.460 --> 01:33:15.460
That's close enough.

01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:21.980
So, I mean, that's good, but I really wanted just a new Earth Defense Force game.

01:33:21.980 --> 01:33:23.580
Well, maybe you will.

01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:24.580
Maybe you will.

01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:30.300
On the PlayStation 3 in Japan this week, Dai 3G Super Robot Taisen Z Tengoku Hen comes

01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:32.740
out this week from Bandai Namco, who makes...

01:33:32.740 --> 01:33:34.220
That's a series that will never die.

01:33:34.220 --> 01:33:35.220
I was going to say, yeah.

01:33:35.220 --> 01:33:36.620
Makes those games all the time.

01:33:36.620 --> 01:33:37.620
All the time.

01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:43.540
On the Wii U this week, we have Lego Batman 3 on the Wii U, as well as Rodea the Sky Soldier

01:33:43.620 --> 01:33:45.860
comes out on the Wii U this week.

01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:50.620
And on the handheld systems this week, on the Vita, we have that same Dai 3G Super Robot

01:33:50.620 --> 01:33:57.020
Taisen, and we also have Norn 9, Norn plus Nonet Last Era comes out on the Vita this

01:33:57.020 --> 01:33:58.020
week.

01:33:58.020 --> 01:34:01.860
And lastly, but not leastly, on the 3DS this week, that Lego Batman game is out there as

01:34:01.860 --> 01:34:02.860
well.

01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:06.340
Some new cover plates, just to rub it in a little bit, which you will not be seeing ever

01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:09.420
in the States, because they won't release that little 3DS here.

01:34:09.420 --> 01:34:13.340
But if you're in Japan, you can get some Zelda and Xenoblade face plates for your new

01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:14.340
3DS.

01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:15.340
Oh, God.

01:34:15.340 --> 01:34:18.980
Xenoblade also getting its Japanese release this week on April the 2nd.

01:34:18.980 --> 01:34:20.860
That's kind of a big deal.

01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:30.020
Also Terra Formars, Akaki Hoshi no Gekitou comes out, and one more from Capcom here.

01:34:30.020 --> 01:34:31.620
That was impressive, by the way, dude.

01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:32.620
What's that?

01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:33.620
That was impressive.

01:34:33.620 --> 01:34:34.620
I was like...

01:34:34.620 --> 01:34:35.620
How you read that?

01:34:35.620 --> 01:34:36.620
That was good.

01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:37.620
Bless your hearts.

01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:40.940
After all these years, it's finally happened.

01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:43.260
Somebody has complimented my Japanese.

01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:44.260
I never...

01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:45.260
I just need a moment.

01:34:45.260 --> 01:34:46.260
I'd like to make all...

01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:47.700
How you fill in the klempt?

01:34:47.700 --> 01:34:48.700
A little bit.

01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:49.700
A little bit.

01:34:49.700 --> 01:34:55.100
Gaya Kuten Saiben 5 also gets a price reduction.

01:34:55.100 --> 01:34:56.100
You know that is, right?

01:34:56.100 --> 01:34:57.100
Actually, I don't.

01:34:57.100 --> 01:34:58.100
Ace Attorney.

01:34:58.100 --> 01:34:59.100
Is it?

01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:00.100
Oh, it is.

01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:01.100
No kidding.

01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:02.100
Phoenix Wright.

01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:03.100
There it is.

01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:05.100
So that gets a little price reduction if you need to catch up on that in Japan this week.

01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:06.100
There you go.

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:07.100
That's it for Japan.

01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:08.100
How about the UK, DarkSakura?

01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:14.980
On the 30th, as I mentioned last week, Bloodsportz.tv on PC, 31st Neverwinter for Xbone.

01:35:14.980 --> 01:35:16.420
I'm sorry, Xbox One.

01:35:16.420 --> 01:35:19.780
April 1st, Pool Nation FX.

01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:24.620
Let me go to actually official April now.

01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:27.900
On the 2nd, we have Xenoblade Chronicles for 3DS.

01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:33.060
On the 3rd, Dark Souls II, Scholar of the First Sin on Damn Near Everything.

01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:34.060
And that's it.

01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:35.060
All right.

01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:38.420
Just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:40.740
We're gonna run through these quickly for time, Loki.

01:35:40.740 --> 01:35:42.100
I wasn't looking up.

01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:43.620
Oh, there it is.

01:35:43.620 --> 01:35:44.860
Ooh, $59.99.

01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:45.860
That's not too bad.

01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:46.860
Loki, news, news.

01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:47.860
Sorry.

01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:48.860
Distracted.

01:35:48.860 --> 01:35:53.900
So anyways, this is pretty cool if you live in Russia.

01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:58.520
You can actually play Halo Online, much like they did Call of Duty Online.

01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:04.060
Now they have an online-only version of Halo where you can play multiplayer games and it's

01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:05.100
free to play.

01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:08.420
That's pretty awesome.

01:36:08.420 --> 01:36:12.100
It is running on a modified version of the Halo 3 engine.

01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:15.700
And I guess it's supposed to take place on the secret UNSC space installation called

01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:18.180
Anvil.

01:36:18.180 --> 01:36:19.180
Looks pretty awesome.

01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:20.500
Too bad they'll never ever come over here.

01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:24.380
Uh, I would hope maybe it's being tested and maybe we could see it here.

01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:25.860
Why did they pick Russia though?

01:36:25.860 --> 01:36:27.860
That's what I don't understand.

01:36:27.860 --> 01:36:29.660
Same thing happened with Call of Duty Online.

01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:31.620
It never came out over here either and that's in China.

01:36:31.620 --> 01:36:32.620
That's true.

01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:34.140
And Civilization Online is in China only.

01:36:34.140 --> 01:36:35.780
I tried playing Call of Duty Online.

01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:36.780
Did you?

01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:41.860
It's awesome because it was all the Call of Duty 1 and 2 maps with the Call of Duty Modern

01:36:41.860 --> 01:36:42.860
Warfare 3.

01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:47.860
Or I'm sorry, the Modern Warfare 1 and 2 maps with the Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 engine

01:36:47.860 --> 01:36:49.860
and weapons.

01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:52.300
So is Halo a super big deal in Russia?

01:36:52.300 --> 01:36:53.300
We're just not aware?

01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:54.300
I don't know.

01:36:54.300 --> 01:36:57.860
Yeah, I mean because we know Starcraft and Korea.

01:36:57.860 --> 01:36:59.060
We know how they roll.

01:37:00.060 --> 01:37:02.060
They release Dynasty Warriors Online everywhere.

01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:04.020
Why the hell couldn't they do Halo Online?

01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:08.460
I'm sure if it's free to play someone will find a way to be able to get around it where

01:37:08.460 --> 01:37:09.460
you can play it.

01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:10.460
Patch it.

01:37:10.460 --> 01:37:11.460
Yeah.

01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:12.460
Maybe it won't be Apache.

01:37:12.460 --> 01:37:13.460
You'll just play it in Russian.

01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:16.460
I mean that's how it worked with Fantasy Star Online 2.

01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:19.340
A lot of people did that because you weren't supposed to play that outside Japan.

01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:20.340
True that.

01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:21.620
Hey, wouldn't it be awesome if they brought that to the Wii U?

01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:22.700
That might be pretty nice.

01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:24.540
You know why you gotta fucking tease me?

01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:26.060
Like why do you gotta do that?

01:37:26.060 --> 01:37:27.740
You know that's a soft spot for me.

01:37:27.740 --> 01:37:28.740
Why are you doing that?

01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:32.420
Alright, because I know they'll never do it.

01:37:32.420 --> 01:37:33.420
Maybe.

01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:36.260
I know I have some Russian people on Twitter at least.

01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:40.580
I don't know if they still listen to OLR actively, but if you're out there and you're in Russia,

01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:42.940
how's the Halo scene out there?

01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:47.300
Any insight as to why you're getting this and the rest of us aren't?

01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:48.300
Sniff.

01:37:48.300 --> 01:37:54.300
Anyhow, speaking of Xbox related things, the April system update, you can actually check

01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:56.180
that out right now.

01:37:56.180 --> 01:37:59.900
Some of the previews going on for that if you're in the preview program including voice

01:37:59.900 --> 01:38:02.660
messages finally on the Xbox One.

01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:07.060
We talked a little bit about that last week, but voice messages making their way in the

01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:08.940
April update.

01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:10.980
Dedicated servers for party chat.

01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:14.180
So to kind of follow up earlier that more and more people are using nothing but party

01:38:14.180 --> 01:38:15.180
chat.

01:38:15.180 --> 01:38:18.740
Yeah, there are going to be some dedicated chat relay servers that will kind of make

01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:24.660
them run more reliably and the what's on area which highlights videos, movies, TV shows

01:38:24.660 --> 01:38:26.260
and game broadcasts.

01:38:26.260 --> 01:38:29.700
They are doing some enhancements and just generally trying to make the algorithm and

01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:31.140
that work a little better.

01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:33.940
So that's all what you have to look forward to in the April update.

01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:38.380
An answer of sorts to the 2.5 update that hit the PlayStation this past week.

01:38:38.380 --> 01:38:43.700
All right, but you know what, let's go back to a much more classic time in gaming.

01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:44.700
We didn't have face plates.

01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:46.500
Yeah, you didn't have face plates.

01:38:46.500 --> 01:38:49.560
You didn't have updates to your console.

01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:50.560
What is that?

01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:53.120
They just kept shrinking.

01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:56.560
Or maybe you would get like a top loader NES that you'd never be able to find.

01:38:56.560 --> 01:38:58.200
Or your Genesis would shrink.

01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:00.800
It's the classic game of the week.

01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:04.480
And every week Dark Soccer is going to step into the vault and find a game that she thinks,

01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:11.960
hey, you kids and your halos on lines and your Earth Defense Force 41s and all this

01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:12.960
stuff.

01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:14.680
Don't mock that game dude.

01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:16.680
That's EDF dude.

01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:19.200
We got to pay our respects to a classic game first.

01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:22.400
So Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week this week?

01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:27.960
I will preface this saying that I went specifically looking for a treasure game because you cannot

01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:30.620
go wrong with a treasure game.

01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:35.880
So today's classic game of the week came out on the Genesis slash Mega Drive and it is

01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:37.640
called Dynamite Heady.

01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:40.640
Oh my goodness.

01:39:40.640 --> 01:39:41.920
Wow.

01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:49.960
It came out in 1994 when I was a senior in high school and it was on Mega Drive and Genesis

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.720
Game Gear and there was a Master System version.

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:56.320
I'm not sure if it was just one of those Brazilian releases because they still love the Master

01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:58.240
System in Brazil.

01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:02.780
There was a 32X port planned but who likes the 32X?

01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:03.780
Nobody who owned Winded.

01:40:03.780 --> 01:40:04.780
I do.

01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:05.780
Oh wait.

01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:09.480
Well, I've got a couple of 32Xs and I pretty much just play Calibri on it.

01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:10.480
Or Space Harrier.

01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:11.480
Nice.

01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:15.040
Because Space Harrier is my third favorite game.

01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:16.480
Good choice.

01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:22.480
Anyway, it has been ported onto the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007 and was included in

01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:27.480
the Gunstar Heroes treasure box collection for PS2 and the Sonic's Ultimate Genesis collection

01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:30.720
for Xbox 360 and PS3.

01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:36.520
So this is a game where you basically play a puppet who can take off his head and beat

01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:39.000
people with it.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.600
I'll read the official thing.

01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:47.480
Eddie arrives in a place called Northtown to see that this evil puppet king has been

01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:52.120
attacking people and turning all the peaceful toys into evil minions.

01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:57.440
And so he got captured, got rejected, and he's like, well screw you, I'm going to stop

01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:58.440
this.

01:40:58.440 --> 01:40:59.520
And so he did.

01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:03.960
So basically he's a puppet with a detachable head and his head can be fired in eight different

01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:10.960
directions and he can use it to smack obstacles as well as reach items.

01:41:10.960 --> 01:41:14.760
He can hold onto a thing called a hangman, lets him pull himself up platforms.

01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:19.280
So he's sort of like Bionic Commando with his head.

01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:25.120
You also can find a case walking around called Head Case that can give his head special damage.

01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:28.080
So basically this is a game where you get head.

01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:34.000
Anyway, so he basically can get like homing stars or he can suck things off the screen

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:41.520
and he has different heads that have invulnerability or shrinking and all kinds of other special

01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:43.960
things can go on.

01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:49.560
It even has a side scrolling shooter stage so that heady can charge and use his different

01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:51.760
head types.

01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:58.920
You know, I have to pause for a second because every time I think of head, I think of the

01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:06.840
monkeys movie head and they were quoted saying that if ever they did a sequel, they wanted

01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:11.920
it to be from the people who gave you head.

01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:13.920
I love the monkeys.

01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:19.440
Anyway, so basically you have all kinds of different scenes, different locations, you

01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:23.840
find a different boss, and then you have to collect all these different pieces from

01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:26.120
defeating keymasters.

01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:27.480
Are you the keymaster?

01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:29.480
Are you the gatekeeper?

01:42:29.480 --> 01:42:33.080
Anyway, and you know basically just make it through the game.

01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:39.800
You also get the liberty head, ho head, where you enter a bonus stage with your head and

01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:41.920
shoot basketballs into hoops.

01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:46.920
So you get different codes and when you compile the code at the end you get a bonus stage.

01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:50.800
So you've got different characters in the games.

01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:56.560
You have heady, you have a girl with floating hands called heather, although her other name

01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:01.840
is fangie.

01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:03.400
Does she throw her fingers around?

01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:07.960
No, she just uses her fingers for the keymaster.

01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:10.800
You have dark demon or king dark demon.

01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:13.680
You have trouble bruin or mariyama.

01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:20.320
You have head case, also known as mokun, I'm sure you can figure out what the Japanese

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:21.320
ones are by now.

01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:23.320
You have hangman or hukun.

01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:25.080
You have bow or yakun.

01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:26.080
You have bino.

01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:28.900
You have mad dog slash bounty bounty.

01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:30.440
That's actually a cooler name.

01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:33.880
Wooden dresser or Jacqueline dressy, as she's called.

01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:41.760
Spinderella, who wasn't she the DJ for Salt-N-Pepa?

01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:44.160
Spinderella was in this game?

01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:45.160
Awesome.

01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:46.840
The other name is motor hand.

01:43:46.840 --> 01:43:50.160
It would be funny if it was motor head.

01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:53.880
I just gotta say in our chat room real quick over at live.vognetwork.com AkumaJP is saying

01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:55.600
is this a horror game?

01:43:55.600 --> 01:44:01.440
You know and I'm like no cause when you're running around giving random people head that's

01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:03.440
not horror.

01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:06.840
Unless it's from someone you didn't want to give that you had.

01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:11.200
Well AkumaJP says oh so this is a horror porn game.

01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:16.200
And I'm like and that caused me to think about what are some horror porn games that I've

01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:17.200
played.

01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:18.200
This is the horrifying one.

01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:21.240
It's the character named baby face also known as mitsuru.

01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:24.960
It was the fourth keymaster which is a baby head on a pole.

01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:25.960
Wow.

01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:30.720
And he gets older every time he goes to his treasure.

01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:34.000
Gatekeeper you have nasty gatekeeper, nasty.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:39.400
You have twin freak slash reaver face and smiley.

01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:44.160
So dynamite heady it was a really good game.

01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:49.840
I mean it's just treasure can hardly do anything wrong pretty much.

01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:53.480
When it came out it got EGM gave it a seven point six out of ten.

01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:59.080
Famitsu gave it an eight out of ten which is not bad for Famitsu back in the day.

01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:04.500
It's just it was a really good game and that's all I have to say.

01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:07.720
Treasure or as my friend says it treasure.

01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:08.720
Treasure.

01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:13.960
There it is your classic game of the week dynamite heady.

01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:15.640
The prequel to dynamite rave.

01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:16.640
Just kidding.

01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:17.640
What?

01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:18.640
Thingy.

01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:25.760
Going to our chat room where they're talking about horror porn.

01:45:25.760 --> 01:45:28.000
Bobby Blackwell saying phantasmagoria.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:32.840
I was the first one I thought about but that night trap.

01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:34.760
I thought it was a night trap.

01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:38.680
That's if we're gonna take it there with full FMV night trap.

01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:43.240
That was more than anything else but oh god bless phantasmagoria good call that was a

01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:44.240
great game.

01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:45.240
Alright.

01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:48.600
I named that last week as a game I thought had been really dated though.

01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:49.600
Yeah.

01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:50.600
Phantasmagoria.

01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:51.600
Yeah.

01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:52.600
Alright.

01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:53.600
Good game though.

01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:54.600
We're gonna take a break though.

01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:56.720
There's plenty more Orange Laundry to come believe it or not.

01:45:56.720 --> 01:46:00.280
We're gonna really run through part B when you guys come back with some rapid fire news.

01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:02.000
The FUCL Question of the Week.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:07.240
Some news about one of something Loki has raved about on this show time and time again.

01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:08.840
Going to the next level.

01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:09.840
Pun intended.

01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:14.680
And we're gonna talk about that when we come back with part B of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:18.960
Also your emails, the FUs of the Week, and your phone calls if you wanna give us a call

01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:20.720
at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:25.080
We'll get to all that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:34.440
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:40.000
We are live on this March the 29th of 2015 with the 592nd episode of our show already

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:41.240
in progress.

01:46:41.240 --> 01:46:46.920
I will say though here Gabriel and Brianna are friends from the Sacramento IGDA.

01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:50.200
They're actually about ready to head out, take care of some other business before it's

01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:51.800
back to the work week tomorrow.

01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:52.800
Oh God.

01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:55.040
But I wanted to thank you guys so much for coming to the show tonight.

01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:56.040
Thank you.

01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:57.040
Seriously.

01:46:57.040 --> 01:47:00.840
You guys have been so great in like promoting us and VOG and I am glad we can do the same

01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:03.600
for you guys and we so look forward to the event.

01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:06.920
Saturday after this coming one's coming right around the corner.

01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:07.920
Very excited.

01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:08.920
Yep.

01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:09.920
Yep.

01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:10.920
And it's a pleasure.

01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:11.920
It's a pleasure to have this happen.

01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:12.920
So thank you.

01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:16.560
Thank you for broadcasting live at our event too because everybody put a lot of heart into

01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:20.840
this and we just wanna share that with your listeners.

01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:21.840
So thank you.

01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:22.840
We're happy to do it.

01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:23.840
We're happy to.

01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:24.840
We wanna share.

01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:27.040
We wanna get more indie stuff out there and people, you know, you don't know about it

01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:28.040
unless you hear about it.

01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:29.720
So we're happy to do that.

01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:33.560
Real quick though before you guys take off any like last plugs to give before we get

01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:35.800
into our forum feedback this week.

01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:38.200
Anything you guys wanna plug on your way out of here?

01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:43.060
Well I mean again like we talked about earlier just check the Crumple demo game out.

01:47:43.060 --> 01:47:44.060
Check it out.

01:47:44.060 --> 01:47:45.060
Hit us up.

01:47:45.060 --> 01:47:49.280
You know, let me know what you think and yeah I mean right now that's it and the indie arcade

01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:50.280
event.

01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:51.280
Yeah.

01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:52.280
Indiearcade.org.

01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:53.280
If you wanna know the website.

01:47:53.280 --> 01:47:55.440
If you haven't bought tickets yet go there.

01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:57.640
That's where all the information is at.

01:47:57.640 --> 01:48:01.080
So indiearcade.org is where you can go.

01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:04.540
You can buy your tickets, get more information on who's gonna be talking, playing, all that

01:48:04.540 --> 01:48:05.540
good stuff.

01:48:05.540 --> 01:48:06.540
Awesome.

01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:09.600
Cause we didn't even talk about like the symphony and the other music performers you got showing

01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:10.600
up.

01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:11.600
I know.

01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:12.600
Yeah.

01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:13.600
I mean we've got, yeah the performers.

01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:14.600
Yeah.

01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:15.600
We talked about the speakers but the performers.

01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:18.520
Reno Video Game Symphony returning for their second time and then Petraform who performed

01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:21.960
at Rockage will be performing at our event as well.

01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:25.920
Brie, do I, anything, okay.

01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:30.720
Anything that we didn't mention on the show can be found on Twitter also at Sac Indie

01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:31.720
Arcade.

01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:32.720
Awesome.

01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:36.280
And again, you know, we wanna encourage people beyond Sacramento to check out what's brewing

01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:41.240
here in the Bay Area's neighbor, Silicon Valley's neighbor, we're making a name for ourselves

01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:42.240
as well here.

01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:43.880
We welcome everybody with open arms.

01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:44.880
Awesome.

01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:45.880
Awesome.

01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:49.520
Well, best of luck to you guys in this final crunch time before your event and I still

01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:50.560
look forward to it.

01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:54.940
So thanks again for being on the show tonight and it sounds like this will be the first

01:48:54.980 --> 01:48:56.900
of many appearances by these guys on our show.

01:48:56.900 --> 01:48:59.020
I'm looking forward to it.

01:48:59.020 --> 01:49:00.020
I'm looking forward to it.

01:49:00.020 --> 01:49:01.020
Awesome.

01:49:01.020 --> 01:49:02.020
I want that review of Earth Defense Force, Gabriel.

01:49:02.020 --> 01:49:03.020
Yes.

01:49:03.020 --> 01:49:04.020
Gotta hear it.

01:49:04.020 --> 01:49:05.020
I may buy that.

01:49:05.020 --> 01:49:06.020
Be careful what you wish for.

01:49:06.020 --> 01:49:08.020
I wish, I wish, I wish.

01:49:08.020 --> 01:49:09.020
All right.

01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:10.780
Thank you guys so much for being here and especially live.

01:49:10.780 --> 01:49:14.780
Not many people get to be here live in studio but only in Sacramento or where we're at.

01:49:14.780 --> 01:49:16.860
We're not in San Jose or LA.

01:49:16.860 --> 01:49:17.860
All right.

01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:23.820
Well, I'm gonna get into some foreign feedback tonight and get into that segment here and

01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:28.540
of course, you guys can participate in our forums over at vognetwork.com.

01:49:28.540 --> 01:49:36.340
You just click on forums and I do have one topic to talk about tonight that popped up

01:49:36.340 --> 01:49:41.220
on the forums this week and it's one of those that was user-created.

01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:47.100
I didn't even do this but good old SSJ100Matt actually made this topic on our forums this

01:49:47.100 --> 01:49:54.660
week and it's about the topic we got into last week of Nintendo mobile games.

01:49:54.660 --> 01:49:59.340
So SSJ100Matt last week had mentioned going off the big news last week that Nintendo is

01:49:59.340 --> 01:50:04.280
going to be making games out of their popular franchises for mobile smartphone tablet smart

01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:05.280
device.

01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:08.900
This was a big move by Nintendo since they've been very reluctant to allow their franchises

01:50:08.900 --> 01:50:11.280
to be on platforms other than their own.

01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:14.500
Many people including investors felt it was about time for the company to venture into

01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:16.940
the mobile market while some were hesitant.

01:50:16.940 --> 01:50:20.460
Regardless, Nintendo's franchises will be reaching a far broader audience than it has

01:50:20.460 --> 01:50:21.460
before.

01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:26.060
But this made me wonder, what type of games and what Nintendo franchises could we see

01:50:26.060 --> 01:50:28.920
ourselves playing on these devices?

01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:34.020
So SSJ100Matt goes over some of his picks including Pokemon Shuffle, which we've talked

01:50:34.020 --> 01:50:38.980
about, you know, before would make a good mobile game most likely, Advance Wars, which

01:50:38.980 --> 01:50:43.460
I brought up on the show last week but certainly, as SSJ100Matt says, I've been waiting a long

01:50:43.460 --> 01:50:47.020
time for this franchise to make a comeback and I think the mobile platform is a perfect

01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:48.140
place for it.

01:50:48.140 --> 01:50:52.820
This game just screams a very fun tablet experience and even allows some possible multiplayer

01:50:52.820 --> 01:50:54.140
aspects.

01:50:54.140 --> 01:50:59.020
And then WarioWare, I thought that was a really good suggestion, WarioWare.

01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:02.780
While it may be a little gimmicky, I think WarioWare would be great on the mobile platform

01:51:02.780 --> 01:51:04.460
utilizing the gyroscopics.

01:51:04.460 --> 01:51:08.100
I think this could be a very fun and probably public embarrassing experience.

01:51:08.100 --> 01:51:11.540
I can also see some fun pass and play multiplayer mechanics.

01:51:11.540 --> 01:51:13.340
I think WarioWare is a great suggestion.

01:51:13.340 --> 01:51:17.840
Well, considering that it was at one time on the Game Boy Advance, I could see them

01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:18.840
doing that.

01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:19.840
Yeah, absolutely.

01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:20.840
So we'll see what happens.

01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:24.980
And then with the touch screens and all that, it could really play into that a lot.

01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:27.460
Tigerclaw say, excellent mobile games.

01:51:27.460 --> 01:51:31.500
Mobile games don't really give you the AAA experience you get from the Wii U or the 3DS.

01:51:31.500 --> 01:51:34.620
I could see them more as companion games to the bigger ones.

01:51:34.620 --> 01:51:38.440
Flaco Jones suggested, since Hearthstone is a mobile game that I think is amazing and

01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:42.560
does mobile gaming right by not forcing players to nickel and dine themselves to death in

01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:47.100
order to have fun, I sort of hope they do a Hearthstone style trading card game with

01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:52.000
Nintendo's All-Stars and their famous abilities featured on the cards.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:55.600
You know, isn't there a Pokemon trading card game?

01:51:55.600 --> 01:52:00.360
I mean, that would be prime to convert over, but maybe, you know, I can also see maybe

01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:05.560
they don't want to do that because, you know, that makes their bread and butter in the old

01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:06.560
fashioned way.

01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:07.760
And maybe they don't want to get into that.

01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:08.920
I don't know.

01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:13.540
But anyway, that topic on our forums, that was some of the responses there.

01:52:13.540 --> 01:52:17.860
So check that out over at vognetwork.com slash forums.

01:52:17.860 --> 01:52:22.480
And if you have a topic, especially follow up that you want us to talk about on the show

01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:25.660
with your perspective, be sure to post it.

01:52:25.660 --> 01:52:27.600
We like to read that stuff here on the show.

01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:28.600
All right.

01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:33.280
Well, we're going to move on with some rapid fire news and travel around the world of gaming

01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:36.720
quickly and see what else is going on that we just don't have time to fit in anywhere

01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:37.720
else.

01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:38.720
Loki.

01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:41.660
So Microsoft is upping the amount of free games they're going to give you with their

01:52:41.660 --> 01:52:44.960
Games with Gold program starting in April.

01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:50.120
Hopefully this is going to continue on beyond April, but for April, they're going to start

01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:55.560
off with, I guess, for Xbox One, you'll be able to download Pool Nation FX and Child

01:52:55.560 --> 01:52:56.680
of Light.

01:52:56.680 --> 01:53:01.960
On the Xbox 360, you can get two games for the first half of the month and two games

01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:03.200
for the second half.

01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:07.120
So for the first half, between April 1st and the 15th, you can get Gears of War Judgment

01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:09.260
and Terraria.

01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:14.160
And during the latter half of the month, you get Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag and Army

01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:16.840
II The Devil's Cartel.

01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:22.840
That's a pretty good offering, I'd say, and those are all really recent games.

01:53:22.840 --> 01:53:27.600
And then, let's see here, unfortunately, there's yet another delay.

01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:29.000
Another big AAA game.

01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:33.080
Batman Arkham Knight has been delayed now.

01:53:33.080 --> 01:53:38.880
The word is that the new date that's supposed to be released is June 23rd, 2015.

01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:39.880
And no word.

01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:40.880
Hey, it's our show's birthday!

01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:41.880
Yay!

01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:44.840
Same date as Heaven's Word for Final Fantasy XIV.

01:53:44.840 --> 01:53:47.200
I am screwed that week.

01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:53.440
So obviously, it's to polish up the game a little bit more, but it seems to be a trend

01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:57.040
nowadays, with a lot of AAA games getting pushed back.

01:53:57.080 --> 01:54:04.000
Thankfully, this isn't into 2016 yet, so I'm kinda glad to see that they're at least giving

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:08.160
themselves more time, as opposed to putting out a game that's really buggy.

01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:11.440
What'll really suck is if they give themselves more time and put out a game that's really

01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:12.720
buggy.

01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:15.440
So hopefully that's not the case.

01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:21.360
Last but not least, there's a brand new video out there for Mortal Kombat X that's confirming

01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:24.920
Liu Kang as a playable character in the game.

01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:31.680
And there was another player I want to say that they showed off to, like some sort of

01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:34.000
cowboy-looking guy as well.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:38.640
And of course, Mortal Kombat X is only a few weeks away, actually.

01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:40.400
Yeah, it's really close.

01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:45.400
So at least on PlayStation 4 and PC and Xbox One.

01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:46.400
Awesome.

01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:50.760
Alright, I just want to say quickly, in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, I was

01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:56.600
getting some feedback there on the Nintendo mobile that I was talking about with the forum.

01:54:56.600 --> 01:55:02.800
And Fifth Dream in our chat poking out and saying, Pokemon card game is mobile already.

01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:03.800
I didn't realize that.

01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:08.000
And gives the link to where the Pokemon trading card game online is on the App Store and iTunes.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:09.000
I did not realize that.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:10.000
I stand corrected.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Well, there you go.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:15.120
Akuma JP suggesting, I don't think you'll see existing titles to mobile yet, but you'll

01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:18.800
see new ideas and titles from Nintendo to mobile.

01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:24.960
See, I'm sort of with you there, but I sort of feel like we'll see franchises move in

01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:26.700
a new mobile direction.

01:55:26.700 --> 01:55:29.120
Like you know they're going to put Mario's face on a mobile game somewhere.

01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:30.120
They have to.

01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:33.440
What about like all those mini games that they had for like Mario Kart or Mario 64 on

01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:34.440
the DS?

01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:37.160
Remember how they used to have all those like, was it Yoshi mini games or whatever?

01:55:37.160 --> 01:55:38.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:55:38.160 --> 01:55:39.160
Yeah, you never know.

01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:40.160
You never know.

01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:41.160
Something like that.

01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:42.160
Maybe expanding on some of these other ideas.

01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:43.160
Who knows?

01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:44.160
Alright, anyhow.

01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:46.440
Moving on to some other, I just want to get those comments out there.

01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:47.960
I thought they were all really good.

01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:54.640
Anyway, some interesting updates this week on VR and, you know, as this is an expanding

01:55:54.640 --> 01:55:59.160
thing, as more and more people are trying out things like Gear VR and Oculus Rift and

01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:06.280
so forth, you know, the reality sets in that some people don't respond too well in terms

01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:10.020
of getting sick from playing these devices.

01:56:10.020 --> 01:56:13.380
So of course, you know, they're trying to figure out how can we make it so that people,

01:56:13.380 --> 01:56:18.860
you know, who are very sensitive to this sort of stuff don't get sick with this.

01:56:18.860 --> 01:56:26.220
So apparently one idea to help is creating a virtual nose.

01:56:26.220 --> 01:56:30.660
This is from a study that was done at Purdue University.

01:56:30.660 --> 01:56:36.220
Assistant professor Dave Whittinghill studied simulator sickness and one of the research

01:56:36.220 --> 01:56:39.020
assistants suggested putting in a nose.

01:56:39.020 --> 01:56:44.020
And so by putting in the nose and participants who were given this virtual nose, they didn't

01:56:44.020 --> 01:56:47.120
even report noticing it until it was pointed out.

01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:51.740
So apparently having like that nose in there, because you kind of see it, I guess, I don't

01:56:51.740 --> 01:56:55.520
know how often I really look at my nose, but I guess you're kind of aware it's there.

01:56:55.520 --> 01:57:02.020
So kind of having that in the simulator vision makes people a little less sick.

01:57:02.020 --> 01:57:04.020
Follow your nose!

01:57:04.020 --> 01:57:05.520
Follow your nose!

01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:10.240
Anyway, obviously, you know, everybody responds differently to different situations.

01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:13.660
And you know, ultimately, people are gonna have to find what works best for them.

01:57:13.660 --> 01:57:18.640
But I thought that was a pretty creative solution to trying and help people deal with some of

01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:20.960
the motion sickness that can come with that.

01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:22.880
Have that with like the character creators in the game.

01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:26.240
So if you give a character like a giant nose, it just takes up a large portion.

01:57:26.240 --> 01:57:27.760
Are you trying to say something about my nose, Loki?

01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:30.480
No, I'm trying to say if you're making characters with large noses.

01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:31.480
Oh, okay.

01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:32.480
All right.

01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:33.480
Fair enough.

01:57:33.480 --> 01:57:39.440
Anyhow, Facebook is going to be bringing 360 degree videos to Oculus and the newsfeed.

01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:40.440
That's awesome.

01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:42.720
I'm sure they'll autoplay without any sort of way to stop that.

01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:45.840
I knew you'd have something smart ass to say.

01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:48.880
Facebook had a big update meeting this week, and of course, you know, now that Facebook

01:57:48.880 --> 01:57:51.440
owns Oculus, they talked a little bit about that.

01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:55.480
And yes, they do plan to bring spherical video content to its VR headset.

01:57:55.480 --> 01:58:00.660
Now, I think a lot of people, at least I do, I look at this and go, okay, that's the direction

01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:05.020
I expected Facebook to move in is that it's not going to just be about games.

01:58:05.020 --> 01:58:08.460
And even some of the demos I've talked about that I've seen on Oculus before have nothing

01:58:08.460 --> 01:58:10.540
to do necessarily with games.

01:58:10.540 --> 01:58:15.180
Like when Bobby was showing me that Gear VR when I was at PAX East, I didn't play a single

01:58:15.180 --> 01:58:16.180
game on it.

01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:19.860
It had games, but the stuff I just happened to look at was, you know, like a Paul McCartney

01:58:19.860 --> 01:58:21.380
concert where I was there.

01:58:21.380 --> 01:58:26.220
Like, it's like I'm on stage with Paul McCartney and a Cirque du Soleil type experience.

01:58:26.220 --> 01:58:32.580
And I could, I could really see that too, putting those types of experiences on Facebook.

01:58:32.580 --> 01:58:34.380
So yeah, so that's, that's pretty neat.

01:58:34.380 --> 01:58:37.940
And then they were actually showing off some of these 360 degree video viewing experiences

01:58:37.940 --> 01:58:38.940
at the Facebook Dev Conference.

01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:42.840
Are you going to be able to do lines and like say a Scarface type game with your virtual

01:58:42.840 --> 01:58:45.180
nose?

01:58:45.180 --> 01:58:46.180
Stop it.

01:58:46.180 --> 01:58:50.300
Actually, Bobby in our chat room over at live.hognetwork.com says it's less about having a nose and more

01:58:50.300 --> 01:58:54.780
about having a frame of reference that your eyes can focus on that doesn't move.

01:58:54.780 --> 01:58:55.780
Yeah.

01:58:56.340 --> 01:59:00.180
It's just in real life, your nose happens to be there.

01:59:00.180 --> 01:59:05.100
So you kind of have that in real life where you may not have that when you're playing

01:59:05.100 --> 01:59:08.820
the Oculus or whatever VR headset you're using.

01:59:08.820 --> 01:59:10.660
And maybe that's the trick for some people.

01:59:10.660 --> 01:59:11.920
I don't know.

01:59:11.920 --> 01:59:14.900
But anyhow, so yeah, that could be very interesting.

01:59:14.900 --> 01:59:18.460
I mean, you think about, think about what we're doing today.

01:59:18.460 --> 01:59:24.260
You know, it's all about what, like Snapchat and pictures on Twitter and little videos

01:59:24.300 --> 01:59:25.300
on Facebook.

01:59:25.300 --> 01:59:30.540
Imagine that you're going to one day strap on the Gear VR, the Oculus Rift, and you're

01:59:30.540 --> 01:59:35.460
going to look at, here's some highlights that your friends took from around the world.

01:59:35.460 --> 01:59:38.060
And you're going to experience that right now in full 3D motion.

01:59:38.060 --> 01:59:42.020
I kind of feel like that's what we're going to start to see.

01:59:42.020 --> 01:59:43.020
But I don't know.

01:59:43.020 --> 01:59:44.020
We'll see.

01:59:44.020 --> 01:59:45.020
We'll see.

01:59:45.020 --> 01:59:49.460
By the way, also some little hints being dropped that the Oculus Rift could be available this

01:59:49.460 --> 01:59:50.460
year.

01:59:50.460 --> 01:59:55.180
However, Facebook quickly clarifying the comments, saying that they're not trying to announce

01:59:55.180 --> 01:59:57.720
any shipping date regarding the Oculus Rift.

01:59:57.720 --> 02:00:02.400
They were just intending to say that PC hardware will be available this year that can create

02:00:02.400 --> 02:00:05.300
the VR experiences that they were speaking about.

02:00:05.300 --> 02:00:10.060
But I, you know, whether it's this year or next year, it's really starting to heat up

02:00:10.060 --> 02:00:11.060
a little bit.

02:00:11.060 --> 02:00:14.140
And I think, I kind of think it still will be a little quiet this year.

02:00:14.140 --> 02:00:16.180
I mean, VR is already out there.

02:00:16.180 --> 02:00:19.640
You know, the Gear VR you can get at Best Buy, right?

02:00:19.640 --> 02:00:21.820
So the VR experience is starting to get out there.

02:00:21.820 --> 02:00:25.560
I think it's just going to really start to ramp up, I feel like, you know, next year

02:00:25.560 --> 02:00:29.880
between what we're going to see on PlayStation 4, probably more and more of this Oculus ramping

02:00:29.880 --> 02:00:30.880
up.

02:00:30.880 --> 02:00:33.520
I really think 2016 is going to be a big year for all this.

02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:37.560
Anyway, lastly, let's throw it back with some talk about EverQuest.

02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:39.960
And I didn't realize EverQuest did this.

02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:43.480
But you know, EverQuest has been around for a long time.

02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:47.120
And EverQuest has been, you know, to kind of keep people interested in what's going

02:00:47.120 --> 02:00:48.120
on over there.

02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:53.000
And a lot of people have been playing an MMO for a very long time, because I saw this all

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:58.440
the time in World of Warcraft, was, man, what if we could play this game vanilla?

02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:01.760
What if we could play this game the way it was intended, the way it was meant to be in

02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:04.160
the beginning before all this other stuff?

02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:09.080
Well, EverQuest doing some polls and bringing their users exactly something like that.

02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:13.880
And they're actually looking at and polling the users right now about doing a new progression

02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:14.880
server.

02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:19.200
So they're going to start the server as normal, but at a specific point, all progression would

02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:22.480
cease and the server would just stay at that point.

02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:26.520
And so, you know, it'll talk about, they go on to talk about like how long some of the

02:01:26.520 --> 02:01:28.420
stuff will be locked.

02:01:28.420 --> 02:01:35.120
So like Kunark would be the thing, the Ruins of Kunark would be open for 6.75 months.

02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:38.600
And then Velius for 3.75 months, and so on and so on.

02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:43.120
All these expansions would slowly unlock, which would allow people to kind of appreciate,

02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:45.000
I guess, the earlier days.

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:50.240
So they're doing voting on more of like specifically the time frames and when the expansion should

02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:52.200
be unlocked and so forth.

02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:55.040
And this, again, just has me kind of thinking about World of Warcraft, which is a game I

02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:57.120
have a little more experience with.

02:01:57.120 --> 02:02:00.600
You know, I hear people saying in WoW all the time, oh, I want to see that vanilla server.

02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:02.020
I want to see what that was like.

02:02:02.020 --> 02:02:05.160
And then sure enough, when they did that Molten Core raid recently, where you could actually

02:02:05.160 --> 02:02:09.920
have a 40-man team in Molten Raid, everybody was like, this is fucking terrible, trying

02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:11.340
to run through with 40 people.

02:02:11.340 --> 02:02:12.340
This is awful.

02:02:12.540 --> 02:02:15.140
Yet there's still some people clamoring for that vanilla experience.

02:02:15.140 --> 02:02:18.020
So that's something they're doing over in EverQuest, at least.

02:02:18.020 --> 02:02:19.020
Kind of interesting.

02:02:19.020 --> 02:02:20.020
Anyway, Dark Soccer.

02:02:20.020 --> 02:02:21.020
What do you have for us?

02:02:21.020 --> 02:02:24.780
I'm trying not to get tangled over here.

02:02:24.780 --> 02:02:30.860
Well, there is a, this is funny, the folks that are behind Lords of the Fallen, they

02:02:30.860 --> 02:02:35.980
offered Hideo Kojima a job over Twitter.

02:02:35.980 --> 02:02:41.900
It goes, Dear Mr. At Hideo Underscore Kojima Underscore Ian, in case you are currently

02:02:41.900 --> 02:02:45.700
searching, we have an open position as Head of Game Design at Deck 13.

02:02:45.700 --> 02:02:46.700
Please get in touch.

02:02:46.700 --> 02:02:50.460
Yeah, he's probably not going to go for that.

02:02:50.460 --> 02:02:52.740
So let's move forward to Tekken News.

02:02:52.740 --> 02:02:56.420
I love Tekken, all the things practically.

02:02:56.420 --> 02:02:59.500
So coming up in Tekken 7, we are getting Jin.

02:02:59.500 --> 02:03:01.500
Yay, I love Jin.

02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:02.500
Devil Jin.

02:03:02.500 --> 02:03:04.120
Yay, I love Devil Jin, too.

02:03:04.120 --> 02:03:11.020
And a new character named Josie, who is a Philippines-born model and martial artist

02:03:11.020 --> 02:03:14.820
who is pretty, pretty cheerful.

02:03:14.820 --> 02:03:20.180
It's also designed by the same person who gave us Bayonetta.

02:03:20.180 --> 02:03:22.420
So that's good.

02:03:22.420 --> 02:03:32.220
And then last but not least, this is actually kind of old.

02:03:32.220 --> 02:03:35.440
Okay.

02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:40.620
So yes, Jaws of Hakkon was already been released on Xbox One and PC.

02:03:41.220 --> 02:03:45.660
But the other versions are going to be released much later.

02:03:45.660 --> 02:03:54.940
Those are going to be coming out for PS4 and Xbox on, I think, later this week.

02:03:54.940 --> 02:03:59.060
The Xbox One, I think, came out this week, but yeah, PS4.

02:03:59.060 --> 02:04:07.860
It came out days ago, but I don't know if they put the date for the PS4 one yet.

02:04:07.860 --> 02:04:12.100
I want to say I read somewhere that they couldn't tell us what it is because of some

02:04:12.100 --> 02:04:14.140
type of contractual agreement.

02:04:14.140 --> 02:04:15.140
What the release date is?

02:04:15.140 --> 02:04:16.140
Yeah.

02:04:16.140 --> 02:04:17.140
What the release date is for the PS4.

02:04:17.140 --> 02:04:18.140
Like, they can't tell us what it is.

02:04:18.140 --> 02:04:21.440
Well, I'm going to tell you all right now.

02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:23.140
It's pretty and doesn't do much.

02:04:23.140 --> 02:04:26.300
You get a little bit of lore, but it's just pretty.

02:04:26.300 --> 02:04:27.300
Hmm.

02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:28.300
Interesting.

02:04:28.300 --> 02:04:29.300
All right.

02:04:29.300 --> 02:04:30.300
Well, then I guess I'm not missing out so much because I was kind of pissed at first.

02:04:30.300 --> 02:04:33.180
Oh, you get a lot of Scott Harding.

02:04:33.180 --> 02:04:34.180
I love Scott Harding.

02:04:34.180 --> 02:04:35.180
Oh, there you go.

02:04:35.180 --> 02:04:36.180
I wish she was romanceable.

02:04:36.180 --> 02:04:39.140
All right.

02:04:39.140 --> 02:04:41.660
Let's go to the FUGL question of the week.

02:04:41.660 --> 02:04:45.340
Every week here on the show, we go to Facebook and Google Plus, and we ask a question of

02:04:45.340 --> 02:04:51.220
our communities, and when you slam Facebook and Google Plus together, you get FUGL.

02:04:51.220 --> 02:05:02.460
Well, this week in the FUGL question of the week, we asked a little bit about clubs and

02:05:02.460 --> 02:05:07.140
organizations because since our guests tonight were from the Sacramento IGDA, I don't expect

02:05:07.140 --> 02:05:13.300
that everybody that listens to this show is a member of the IGDA, but I figure maybe a

02:05:13.300 --> 02:05:18.340
few of you have belonged to some type of club or association at some point, so we wanted

02:05:18.340 --> 02:05:19.820
to get more information about that.

02:05:19.820 --> 02:05:20.820
Tell us about it.

02:05:20.820 --> 02:05:24.060
Have you ever been the member of a club or association that relates to gaming, like an

02:05:24.060 --> 02:05:30.180
official fan club or an unofficial group dedicated to playing, creating one, or multiple games?

02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:31.260
Tell us about it.

02:05:31.260 --> 02:05:35.780
So over on Facebook, we got RageNator, who said, sort of.

02:05:35.780 --> 02:05:39.620
During my senior year of high school, a few people, including myself, regularly got together

02:05:39.620 --> 02:05:43.140
before school during lunch periods and after to play Magic the Gathering.

02:05:43.140 --> 02:05:44.140
Nerd.

02:05:44.140 --> 02:05:45.140
Just kidding.

02:05:45.140 --> 02:05:46.140
I did the same thing.

02:05:46.140 --> 02:05:50.420
Granted, at the time, it wasn't a club officially sanctioned by the school and didn't have a

02:05:50.420 --> 02:05:54.740
name, but it was the seed that eventually became an official club based on what I was

02:05:54.740 --> 02:05:57.540
told by others that graduated after me.

02:05:57.540 --> 02:05:59.200
Oh, wow.

02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:04.000
It's always weird to me to hear about that something really awesome existed at your high

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.280
school after you left.

02:06:06.280 --> 02:06:10.640
My high school finally started offering Japanese after I left.

02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:13.840
Anyway, I guess that always happens.

02:06:13.840 --> 02:06:14.840
Princess Ireni.

02:06:14.840 --> 02:06:18.960
Our good pal Princess Ireni actually answered the question here on Facebook this week and

02:06:18.960 --> 02:06:25.520
said, I used to run with a crew called the Sacramentals back in the early 2000s.

02:06:25.520 --> 02:06:29.680
We played a bunch of Imani games at Roosevelt Golf Land and ate at Brookfield's a lot.

02:06:29.680 --> 02:06:30.680
Maybe you've heard of them.

02:06:30.680 --> 02:06:32.840
They're pretty legendary in these parts.

02:06:32.840 --> 02:06:35.640
I heard they were big fucking nerds.

02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:36.640
You know what?

02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:41.440
I remember trying to actually register that domain to find that some Catholic group already

02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:42.440
had it.

02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:43.440
I was so mad.

02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:44.440
All right.

02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:45.440
Anyhow.

02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:51.920
Surping Slurpee responded and said, occasionally I attend board game get togethers every week

02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:57.080
between 20 to 30 people get together at Panera, then Denny's after Panera closes, and game

02:06:57.080 --> 02:06:58.080
out.

02:06:58.080 --> 02:07:01.280
Most attendees are in their late 20s to early 30s, though some are older and predominantly

02:07:01.280 --> 02:07:02.280
female.

02:07:02.280 --> 02:07:03.280
It's great fun.

02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:05.160
Andy R said, nope.

02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:08.640
Was part of an anime club in college, though, and a lot of our meetings consisted of playing

02:07:08.640 --> 02:07:09.640
games.

02:07:09.640 --> 02:07:12.700
I did hang out with the remnants of our college's Bamani Club a lot when they were basically

02:07:12.700 --> 02:07:15.480
disbanded by the time I met them due to bullshittery.

02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:21.580
I have to remember to use that term more often in my life, bullshittery.

02:07:21.580 --> 02:07:24.440
We completely dominated the school's rock band tournament both years.

02:07:24.440 --> 02:07:25.940
They held it.

02:07:25.940 --> 02:07:30.660
Bryce replied and simply said, no, crying face.

02:07:30.660 --> 02:07:31.660
Start one.

02:07:31.660 --> 02:07:33.140
Bryce needed to start one.

02:07:33.140 --> 02:07:36.340
Deakman replied and said, does Club Nintendo count?

02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:39.940
Well, if you helped to run it, maybe.

02:07:39.940 --> 02:07:40.940
No.

02:07:40.940 --> 02:07:41.940
Club Nintendo, I guess.

02:07:41.940 --> 02:07:42.940
Of course Club Nintendo counts.

02:07:42.940 --> 02:07:44.060
Somebody has to say that.

02:07:44.060 --> 02:07:48.060
Dark Tetsuya said, Irene stole my answer, but Wednesdays back in the day with the Sac

02:07:48.060 --> 02:07:53.580
Bamani crew were fucking epic, trying to get all the content unlocked on Max 2 by playing

02:07:53.580 --> 02:07:55.220
the crap out of it.

02:07:55.220 --> 02:07:56.700
Good times.

02:07:56.700 --> 02:07:57.700
That was good times.

02:07:57.700 --> 02:08:01.520
Remember when the whole community had to come together to get stuff in the games?

02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:03.180
That was always a good time.

02:08:03.180 --> 02:08:10.740
Anyway, last but not least, and I love this answer over on Google Plus from Prince Peachfuzz.

02:08:10.740 --> 02:08:12.380
One of my other favorite names here.

02:08:12.380 --> 02:08:16.880
Prince Peachfuzz responded and said, does the OL Army count?

02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:17.880
If so, yes.

02:08:17.880 --> 02:08:20.760
Gold star for you, sir.

02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:21.920
Yes, it counts.

02:08:21.920 --> 02:08:23.620
You're all a part of the club now.

02:08:23.620 --> 02:08:28.120
So even the poor guy on Facebook who felt left out, you could be a part of the OL Army.

02:08:28.120 --> 02:08:34.160
We're a club and I'm the president and Jamie is the overlord because she has to outrank

02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:35.560
me.

02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:40.480
I was just going to say I am the queen bee.

02:08:40.480 --> 02:08:45.040
And Loki, clearly the court jester.

02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:46.040
Prince of Bacon.

02:08:46.040 --> 02:08:47.840
No, no, no, no, no.

02:08:47.840 --> 02:08:51.680
Loki is our, he's our Cullen.

02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:52.680
Cullen?

02:08:52.680 --> 02:08:53.680
Oh yeah.

02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:55.080
He's our Cullen.

02:08:55.080 --> 02:08:56.840
What does Cullen do?

02:08:56.840 --> 02:08:59.080
He's the commander of the Inquisition's forces.

02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:00.080
I see.

02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:03.360
Do you really want to put him in charge of the actual army?

02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:04.360
No.

02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:06.200
Loki, what would you...

02:09:06.200 --> 02:09:08.280
We could put a big hat on him.

02:09:08.280 --> 02:09:09.720
Fair enough.

02:09:09.720 --> 02:09:10.720
He's the Pope.

02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:11.720
He's the Pope.

02:09:11.720 --> 02:09:14.560
He's the Pope of the OL Army.

02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:15.560
He's the OL Army Pope.

02:09:15.560 --> 02:09:16.560
He's the spiritual figurehead.

02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:17.560
No, no, no.

02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:19.360
A big hat.

02:09:19.360 --> 02:09:20.360
He can be the admiral.

02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:21.360
There you go.

02:09:21.360 --> 02:09:22.360
You're the admiral.

02:09:22.360 --> 02:09:23.360
I like that.

02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:24.360
Admiral Loki.

02:09:24.360 --> 02:09:27.120
Loki just has this look on his face of like, I don't know what the fuck you two are talking

02:09:27.120 --> 02:09:28.120
about.

02:09:28.120 --> 02:09:29.120
Exactly.

02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:30.120
That's exactly what I was thinking.

02:09:30.120 --> 02:09:33.560
Alright, then Loki, let's get back to some news because I know this first one.

02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:35.400
You've got to have something to say about this, Loki.

02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:36.720
I think it's pretty awesome.

02:09:36.720 --> 02:09:41.800
I mean, they've had the rights sold already to Warner Brothers for Ready Player One for,

02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:48.560
God, I don't even know how long now, but they have a director and I guess I could have picked

02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:49.560
just anybody.

02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:54.240
I mean, they've got this guy named Steven Spielberg, I mean, like, what's he done?

02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:59.340
But he's going to be directing the movie, which hopefully will be coming out sooner

02:09:59.340 --> 02:10:03.280
than it actually takes place in 2044.

02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:05.440
But I am psyched for this movie when it comes out.

02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:09.840
I'm going to be psyched anyways, it's just a bunch of like, it's just an orgy of 80s

02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:10.840
stuff.

02:10:10.880 --> 02:10:16.000
You have fucking mecha and shit fighting each other and it's like, how is this not going

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:17.000
to be awesome?

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:22.240
Of course my wife's like, I'm just reciting things and it's like, she complains about

02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:23.240
the book all the time.

02:10:23.240 --> 02:10:24.240
Have you read the book yet?

02:10:24.240 --> 02:10:28.080
I still have not read the book, but I'm glad to know there's a movie coming out so I don't

02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:29.080
have to read.

02:10:29.080 --> 02:10:30.080
Do you want to borrow the book?

02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:31.080
Maybe.

02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:32.080
You should read the book.

02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:33.080
It's awesome.

02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:34.080
It's just garbage, but it's, it's...

02:10:34.080 --> 02:10:37.240
My partner has a Kindle that neither one of us ever use, so maybe I could get a digital,

02:10:37.240 --> 02:10:39.080
I don't even know where the fucking Kindle is, but...

02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:41.360
You have an iPad with a Kindle app.

02:10:41.360 --> 02:10:42.360
You don't need a digital version.

02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:43.360
I have a hard...

02:10:43.360 --> 02:10:48.160
Wait, how am I supposed to use paper?

02:10:48.160 --> 02:10:49.160
A book?

02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:50.160
What are we going to do with that?

02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:53.160
Are they going to hold down another book?

02:10:53.160 --> 02:10:54.160
It's a quick read.

02:10:54.160 --> 02:10:55.160
All right.

02:10:55.160 --> 02:10:57.160
They played Joust in it at one point.

02:10:57.160 --> 02:11:00.640
Books are the things that Rob used to hold up his monitor.

02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:02.320
But I don't know.

02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:05.320
I'm very excited about it.

02:11:05.320 --> 02:11:10.880
It should hopefully turn out better than, say, I don't know, Pixels or something.

02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:12.840
I am excited to see this.

02:11:12.840 --> 02:11:17.920
Even though I don't always love Spielberg, I think some of his stuff is overrated, I

02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:23.600
think that's really cool that somebody of his caliber is attached to this.

02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:29.080
And I know it's considered one of his worst movies, but I will always stick up for Hook.

02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:30.080
I love that movie.

02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:31.080
I'm sorry.

02:11:31.080 --> 02:11:32.080
I love that movie as a kid.

02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:33.560
It was so good.

02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:36.600
You know that's considered one of his worst movies.

02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:39.360
If that's his worst movie, then he can't do too bad.

02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:41.360
I mean, that's not bad.

02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:45.760
I mean, damn, you've got a pretty entertaining movie as your worst movie.

02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:48.520
Okay, well that's terrible of you, I guess.

02:11:48.520 --> 02:11:49.520
All right.

02:11:49.520 --> 02:11:55.220
Well, anyhow, from movies to television, and you're really into Ready Player One, I really

02:11:55.220 --> 02:11:57.200
like this mobile phone game.

02:11:57.200 --> 02:11:58.440
Maybe this should be the thing.

02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:03.880
I will read Ready Player One when you sign up to play Ingress, which is a game that I've

02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:04.880
talked about on this show.

02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:07.000
Dude, my phone would not run that if I even...

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:08.000
Oh, that's true.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.000
I'm guessing.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:10.000
It's a Samsung Galaxy S2.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.560
It hardly runs a fucking web page.

02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:17.200
Yeah, I think Alan had a three, and it was pretty slow on that, so I don't know.

02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:18.200
So, sorry.

02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:19.200
That's all right.

02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:20.200
I can't do that yet.

02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:21.200
Maybe on the next one.

02:12:21.200 --> 02:12:22.200
I can't play anything on this.

02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:23.200
Maybe on the next one.

02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:25.760
But anyway, Ingress apparently going to be coming to television.

02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:32.680
Now, of course, I've talked about this game on the show before, but it gets you out and

02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:35.280
going around to places of public interest to capture...

02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:38.520
Imagine if Foursquare met Capture the Flag.

02:12:38.520 --> 02:12:42.920
That's kind of what Ingress is, is you battle out in these factions to then capture these

02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:45.920
nodes and connect them to create control fields.

02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:46.920
And so that's what Ingress is all about.

02:12:46.920 --> 02:12:54.600
But of course, there's this whole YouTube and a viral alternate augmented reality game

02:12:54.600 --> 02:12:57.040
type of stuff that goes on behind it.

02:12:57.040 --> 02:13:00.020
There's an actual reporter that goes out to all these events.

02:13:00.020 --> 02:13:04.660
Some of the local folks I know that play here in Sacramento all went down to Pasadena this

02:13:04.660 --> 02:13:10.200
weekend for what they call an anomaly, which is just basically a big event where it actually

02:13:10.200 --> 02:13:11.800
drives the game's lore.

02:13:11.800 --> 02:13:15.600
So one of these events, when people go to it, is it just a bunch of people on their

02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:16.600
phones going...

02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:17.600
Yes!

02:13:17.600 --> 02:13:18.600
It's so stupid.

02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:24.560
If you're watching this, it happened in Sacramento and it's thousands of people on the street

02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:25.800
all staring at their phones.

02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:29.000
It looks like some frickin' flash mob hit where people can't be bothered to pay attention.

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:33.400
Or just regular life with people on the street with their phones.

02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:35.440
It's like no one actually understands their...

02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:36.440
What?

02:13:36.440 --> 02:13:37.440
There's an anomaly going on?

02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:38.440
I was just playing on my phone.

02:13:38.440 --> 02:13:41.800
Now little did you know, they're all sitting there going, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew,

02:13:41.800 --> 02:13:42.800
pew, pew, pew.

02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:45.280
Yes, it doesn't make it any less stupid.

02:13:45.280 --> 02:13:46.280
No.

02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:48.560
Ah, you're such an asshole.

02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:51.480
Anyway, now more people can learn about it because apparently...

02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:56.080
At least they're not running around pretending their guns and stuff and going pew, pew, pew,

02:13:56.080 --> 02:14:00.360
and hiding behind bushes and shit like that.

02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:03.560
Anyway, Google Niantic apparently working with Sean...

02:14:03.560 --> 02:14:04.840
Do they have costumes?

02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:07.120
Do you wear costumes to these events?

02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:12.840
Well, because the factions are blue and green, people will wear blue and green.

02:14:12.840 --> 02:14:15.240
Some people will wear the green wigs.

02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:18.720
So they're gonna think it's a gang war going on.

02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:21.520
Yes, somebody's gonna think it's a gang war.

02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:23.880
But they're all staring at their phones.

02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:25.400
I'm glad to be coming after you, man.

02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:26.400
Alright, shut up.

02:14:26.400 --> 02:14:30.920
Anyway, Google Niantic Labs, who created the game, working with Sean Daniel Company.

02:14:30.920 --> 02:14:35.320
This is the production company responsible for the Mummy film franchise and The Expanse,

02:14:35.320 --> 02:14:36.880
which is coming to Syfy.

02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:38.840
Nothing pitched to networks yet.

02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:40.680
No showrunner attached.

02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:43.040
So this is still very early on in development.

02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:47.960
Some folks thinking that this might actually not be about Ingress, but Niantic working

02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:52.280
on a follow-up of sorts, which is also going to be taking place.

02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:56.560
So this could be that the TV agreement's actually for what's to come next.

02:14:56.560 --> 02:15:00.400
And what cracks me up is that, and I forget the name of it, maybe somebody in chat remembers

02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:08.440
it, but Niantic's working with author James Frey to create the book that will kind of

02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:09.440
be part of the lore.

02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:12.680
Well, if you don't recognize that name, do you know who James Frey was?

02:15:12.680 --> 02:15:17.920
He's the guy that got read to filth by Oprah because he lied on the show about his memoir.

02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:21.360
Remember that whole thing, the million broken pieces or whatever it was called?

02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:25.760
He fricking lied, I guess, about the experiences or embellished a lot and Oprah had them on

02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:31.280
the show and like, you don't ever see Oprah get mad, but when she gets mad, heaven help

02:15:31.280 --> 02:15:32.280
you.

02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:33.280
Right?

02:15:33.280 --> 02:15:34.280
So that was that guy.

02:15:34.280 --> 02:15:37.280
And I'm like, wow, he's back and he's going to write Game War.

02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:38.760
Apparently he's good at fabrication.

02:15:38.760 --> 02:15:39.760
Right?

02:15:39.840 --> 02:15:45.120
Why not the guy's good at lying and making stories up.

02:15:45.120 --> 02:15:46.120
Oh Lord.

02:15:46.120 --> 02:15:47.120
All right.

02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:48.120
Anyway.

02:15:48.120 --> 02:15:49.120
Uh, let's move on.

02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:50.120
Dark Sakura.

02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:57.800
Well, um, there is a UK, uh, charity event that went on.

02:15:57.800 --> 02:16:02.440
It was run by, uh, a group called, uh, special effect.

02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:09.120
They had a charity, uh, event called game blast that they managed to pull in over 120,000

02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:15.240
pounds in donations and they surpassed last year's goal by 50,000 pounds.

02:16:15.240 --> 02:16:21.400
So, uh, they, uh, basically have, uh, just been pulling this in, trying to help, you

02:16:21.400 --> 02:16:23.640
know, poor kids that need the help.

02:16:23.640 --> 02:16:26.800
Um, their donation page is still up and active.

02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:33.800
Uh, the, uh, next game blast is going to be tentatively February 26th through 28th, 2016.

02:16:33.800 --> 02:16:37.640
And you can go to their donation page at just giving.com.

02:16:40.120 --> 02:16:41.120
Awesome.

02:16:41.120 --> 02:16:42.120
Yep.

02:16:42.120 --> 02:16:43.120
I like it.

02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:44.120
We like people doing nice stuff.

02:16:44.120 --> 02:16:45.120
That's right.

02:16:45.120 --> 02:16:50.000
It's nice to hear about gamers doing good as opposed to, you know, gang warfare created

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:51.000
by video games.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:52.200
Don't be a Dick.

02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:53.200
That's right.

02:16:53.200 --> 02:16:56.200
Uh, moving on Loki.

02:16:56.200 --> 02:16:59.000
Hey, I don't know.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:04.280
I can't believe they're using that author quote unquote to, uh, make the storyline for

02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:05.280
this thing.

02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:06.280
I can't remember that.

02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:07.280
Does he actually write anything?

02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:12.480
I mean that he hasn't, you know, plagiarized, uh, I will do what anyone would do in this

02:17:12.480 --> 02:17:18.860
situation and I'm going to look it up on Wikipedia right now and try to find out, um, what else

02:17:18.860 --> 02:17:21.280
that he's written since then.

02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:28.480
Um, he has a young adult novel publishing company, uh, that was trying to gracely create

02:17:28.480 --> 02:17:29.480
Twilight knockoffs.

02:17:29.480 --> 02:17:31.320
It sounds like, wow.

02:17:31.320 --> 02:17:32.320
So there you go.

02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:33.320
All right.

02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:35.360
And game is the name of the game I was trying to think of.

02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:36.440
End game.

02:17:36.440 --> 02:17:37.440
End game.

02:17:37.440 --> 02:17:38.440
End game.

02:17:38.440 --> 02:17:39.440
Okay.

02:17:39.440 --> 02:17:44.400
Anyways, um, so remember that cool rumor that we had that Netflix was going to be getting

02:17:44.400 --> 02:17:47.440
some Zelda series or something?

02:17:47.440 --> 02:17:53.960
Yeah, that's unfortunately not, not going to happen.

02:17:53.960 --> 02:18:01.360
Nintendo basically said, Hey, that, uh, talk of the show is not based on correct information.

02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:03.360
There's nothing new to share.

02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:04.360
Sorry.

02:18:05.360 --> 02:18:06.360
That was all the show.

02:18:06.360 --> 02:18:12.120
Well, to be fair and maybe a little tinfoil haddish, Nintendo could be lying.

02:18:12.120 --> 02:18:14.360
It wouldn't be the first time they've done it.

02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:15.360
Right.

02:18:18.360 --> 02:18:25.860
Um, I mean, you're opening up to, you're opening me up to like so many jokes, but yes, I won't

02:18:25.860 --> 02:18:26.860
take those.

02:18:26.860 --> 02:18:32.240
Um, I, yeah, I guess they could be lying, but it's kind of stupid.

02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:35.120
Like, ha, we're not going to talk about it.

02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:38.120
And we're never going to talk about it.

02:18:38.120 --> 02:18:39.120
All right.

02:18:39.120 --> 02:18:43.160
Uh, looking at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Tigerclaw wants to know why did it take Nintendo

02:18:43.160 --> 02:18:45.120
this long to respond to it?

02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:49.120
You know, I'm getting this weird feeling that nobody asked.

02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:54.760
I mean, granted, they probably contacted the Nintendo PR department or whatever and got

02:18:54.760 --> 02:18:59.040
the whole line of we don't comment on rumors or speculation, but this was the first time

02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:02.920
that, you know, it was a wata that put the kibosh on this, right?

02:19:02.920 --> 02:19:06.520
That somebody sat him down and asked him point blank.

02:19:06.520 --> 02:19:07.640
So what about this rumor?

02:19:07.640 --> 02:19:12.400
So I think that's part of the reason why it took this long to hear about it is it took

02:19:12.400 --> 02:19:16.740
this long for somebody to ask him point blank in a situation where he couldn't necessarily

02:19:16.740 --> 02:19:18.640
PR speak his way out of it.

02:19:18.640 --> 02:19:20.640
So we'll see.

02:19:20.640 --> 02:19:26.760
Uh, yeah, and SSG100 Matt says, uh, they're not going to talk about it until E3.

02:19:26.760 --> 02:19:30.400
Dungeon Buster says not correct isn't really a flat out denial.

02:19:30.400 --> 02:19:37.240
So we'll see anyhow, moving on to Minecraft, which still gets a lot of press even to this

02:19:37.240 --> 02:19:38.240
day.

02:19:38.240 --> 02:19:43.200
And, uh, this is, I find this story fascinating because what's happening with Minecraft, they're

02:19:43.200 --> 02:19:48.880
going to be giving it for free in every Northern Ireland secondary school.

02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:54.440
Uh, this is, uh, Culture Tech, which is a festival of technology and creative industries.

02:19:54.440 --> 02:19:58.880
They've gotten funding from the department of culture, arts and leisure to supply 200

02:19:58.880 --> 02:20:01.280
schools with download codes.

02:20:01.280 --> 02:20:05.240
Each license is for a version of the game called Minecraft edu.

02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:09.280
I didn't even know this was a thing, but you can look it up at Minecraft edu.com and it's

02:20:09.280 --> 02:20:12.120
designed specifically for the classroom.

02:20:12.120 --> 02:20:16.880
So this is going to be distributed thanks to this funding across all of Northern Ireland.

02:20:16.880 --> 02:20:21.360
And I couldn't help but think about, you know, when I'm reading about this, I'm like, geez,

02:20:21.360 --> 02:20:25.960
when I grew up, we were playing Oregon trail and number munchers, and now kids today they're

02:20:25.960 --> 02:20:28.600
playing Minecraft in school.

02:20:28.600 --> 02:20:29.960
That's kind of neat.

02:20:29.960 --> 02:20:30.960
I love that idea.

02:20:30.960 --> 02:20:31.960
I mean, I don't know.

02:20:31.960 --> 02:20:37.640
I mean, I guess Minecraft certainly teaches them design and it's art and you know, that

02:20:37.640 --> 02:20:38.640
all of that.

02:20:38.640 --> 02:20:44.080
But, uh, you know, it's not, I guess it's in your face as eat all the multiples of three

02:20:44.080 --> 02:20:45.680
or get eaten by a traggle.

02:20:45.680 --> 02:20:50.860
You know, it's not quite as in your face as that, but I think that's pretty awesome.

02:20:50.860 --> 02:20:54.500
So who knew that Netflix was what the kids were playing in schools these days?

02:20:54.500 --> 02:20:55.500
I should Minecraft.

02:20:55.500 --> 02:20:57.180
You mean what'd I say?

02:20:57.180 --> 02:20:58.180
Netflix.

02:20:58.180 --> 02:20:59.180
Oh, Rob.

02:20:59.180 --> 02:21:01.940
I was looking at another story.

02:21:01.940 --> 02:21:02.940
Minecraft.

02:21:02.940 --> 02:21:08.320
Well, you know, one kid's got Minecraft open and the other kid buying them as Netflix open

02:21:08.320 --> 02:21:09.320
or something.

02:21:09.320 --> 02:21:10.320
That's what they do.

02:21:10.320 --> 02:21:11.320
Anyway.

02:21:11.320 --> 02:21:12.320
Uh, let's move on.

02:21:12.320 --> 02:21:13.660
We're going to go to our mailbag every week.

02:21:13.660 --> 02:21:17.860
You guys send us emails to participate at orange lounge radio.com, which is our email

02:21:17.860 --> 02:21:24.080
address and dark Sakura dives into the mailbag and find some emails that she deems worthy

02:21:24.080 --> 02:21:26.220
of reading on the program.

02:21:26.220 --> 02:21:27.220
Dark Sakura.

02:21:27.220 --> 02:21:29.300
How many do we have in the mailbag tonight?

02:21:29.300 --> 02:21:30.300
Four four.

02:21:30.300 --> 02:21:32.620
There was only one and I looked in there earlier.

02:21:32.620 --> 02:21:33.620
Holy crap.

02:21:33.620 --> 02:21:34.620
Four emails tonight.

02:21:34.620 --> 02:21:35.620
All right.

02:21:35.620 --> 02:21:36.620
Yes.

02:21:36.620 --> 02:21:37.620
What's up orange lounge.

02:21:37.620 --> 02:21:39.260
I'm sure you guys have noticed this trend.

02:21:39.260 --> 02:21:40.700
Indiana Jones was brought back.

02:21:40.700 --> 02:21:42.660
Pirates of the Caribbean is getting a fifth movie.

02:21:42.660 --> 02:21:43.860
The Marvel movies keep coming.

02:21:43.860 --> 02:21:46.240
The Hobbit was built from a book.

02:21:46.240 --> 02:21:50.640
Uncharted for a new mass effect, new gears of war, more halo to become to stop hiring

02:21:50.640 --> 02:21:52.400
good writers.

02:21:52.400 --> 02:21:56.760
Do people stop going to school for writing and instead we have too many CG animators.

02:21:56.760 --> 02:21:57.760
I'm confused.

02:21:57.760 --> 02:22:01.960
The entertainment industry for mainly movies and games has literally been flooded with

02:22:01.960 --> 02:22:03.680
prequel sequels, remakes.

02:22:03.680 --> 02:22:05.040
What happened to creativity?

02:22:05.040 --> 02:22:08.760
I'm going to stop and say there's nothing wrong with any mass effect game.

02:22:08.760 --> 02:22:10.120
Okay.

02:22:10.120 --> 02:22:12.360
I thought you guys might, you need to watch your step.

02:22:12.360 --> 02:22:15.160
You need to watch it.

02:22:15.160 --> 02:22:18.920
I thought you guys might enjoy this topic since lately so many of our AAA games are

02:22:18.920 --> 02:22:22.480
broken, a remake or just another chapter in an already established IP.

02:22:22.480 --> 02:22:23.600
Where did originality go?

02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:25.840
Is indie all we have left for creative genius?

02:22:25.840 --> 02:22:27.880
All the best is easy.

02:22:27.880 --> 02:22:34.020
For the record, I see, I actually kind of see nothing wrong with having different stories

02:22:34.020 --> 02:22:37.320
that we've come to love expanded on.

02:22:37.320 --> 02:22:39.520
I don't want to see mass effect go away.

02:22:39.520 --> 02:22:40.520
I'd like to see more.

02:22:40.520 --> 02:22:45.760
I don't want it to end up, you know, getting Lucas sized, you know, like star Wars did.

02:22:45.760 --> 02:22:50.760
Well it's funny you make that reference because I would honestly say to the emailer, it's

02:22:50.760 --> 02:22:55.640
nothing really different from other forms of entertainment, specifically movies.

02:22:55.640 --> 02:22:57.520
Don't movies have the same problem?

02:22:57.520 --> 02:23:00.960
We just talked earlier in the show, they remade Arthur of all fricking movies.

02:23:00.960 --> 02:23:04.000
I think that's what he was pointing out though when he mentioned all the Marvel movies and

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:05.000
stuff.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:06.000
I guess that's true.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:12.280
And keep in mind, the Marvel movies are part of a larger story, right?

02:23:12.280 --> 02:23:15.600
It's like how many different issues of the comic books do we buy?

02:23:15.600 --> 02:23:19.320
If you really want to, you know, see what's going on in the Marvel universe, they're making

02:23:19.320 --> 02:23:22.640
a Deadpool movie and it looks awesome.

02:23:22.640 --> 02:23:23.800
Did you see that costume picture?

02:23:23.800 --> 02:23:24.880
Oh, that was the best.

02:23:24.880 --> 02:23:28.560
I love and dark to see a point of this or somebody, no, somebody, no, it wasn't hard

02:23:28.560 --> 02:23:29.560
to see it.

02:23:29.560 --> 02:23:30.560
Sorry.

02:23:30.560 --> 02:23:31.560
I missed tribute to some of you.

02:23:31.560 --> 02:23:35.360
It was saying my buddy sake that did this on Twitter actually pointed out that Deadpool

02:23:35.360 --> 02:23:37.960
on Twitter only follows Hello Kitty.

02:23:37.960 --> 02:23:38.960
And that's it.

02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:40.920
And he's like, how perfect is that?

02:23:40.920 --> 02:23:42.040
That's amazing.

02:23:42.040 --> 02:23:43.040
You know what though?

02:23:43.040 --> 02:23:47.960
I thought I'd bet anything if I made a B Arthur account, it'd get followed.

02:23:47.960 --> 02:23:48.960
Here you go.

02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:49.960
I might have to do that.

02:23:49.960 --> 02:23:50.960
Here you go.

02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:54.040
Um, I'm going to do, I'm going to do RIP B Arthur.

02:23:54.040 --> 02:23:58.840
But I do want us to actually, I knew a podcaster around here called spanking B Arthur.

02:23:58.840 --> 02:24:04.080
So that's, that's the thing, but anyway, um, let me point out, uh, the whole, uh, again,

02:24:04.080 --> 02:24:09.760
the whole ideas and everything, I really think that we're seeing in games really nothing

02:24:09.760 --> 02:24:13.800
different from what you see in movies or even in books, you know?

02:24:13.800 --> 02:24:17.440
And I wouldn't even say Indy's going to be a way to get around that because all you have,

02:24:17.440 --> 02:24:22.400
a lot of indie guys are making games that are spiritual successors to things, you know,

02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:26.320
it's like, well, we can't license the rights to make a sequel to this game, but we're going

02:24:26.320 --> 02:24:28.080
to make one that's very similar to that.

02:24:28.080 --> 02:24:29.080
Yeah.

02:24:29.080 --> 02:24:33.600
So I don't know, but there's, there's original stuff and who cares sometimes going back to

02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:35.520
like a franchise is pretty awesome.

02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:38.320
Like, look, they rebooted Tomb Raider for like the eighth time.

02:24:38.320 --> 02:24:40.880
So, and I, this time it was actually good.

02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:46.920
I see a lot of indie games kind of saying like, we're really inspired by Metroidvania

02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:48.980
and I don't see that as a bad thing whatsoever.

02:24:48.980 --> 02:24:51.400
And I don't say, Oh, this means the Indies are running out of ideas.

02:24:51.400 --> 02:24:54.580
I think this just says, Hey, the Indies are taking something they love and putting their

02:24:54.580 --> 02:24:55.600
own spin on it.

02:24:55.600 --> 02:25:00.480
So you know, I wonder if we'll ever see a metric cross Castlevania game.

02:25:00.480 --> 02:25:01.480
Yeah.

02:25:01.480 --> 02:25:09.240
I just want to see a game called Metroidvania, Samus finds herself in a haunted castle from

02:25:09.240 --> 02:25:10.240
years ago.

02:25:10.240 --> 02:25:11.240
Anyway.

02:25:11.240 --> 02:25:12.240
Yeah.

02:25:12.240 --> 02:25:16.480
I seriously, if I was going to sit down and do an indie game, I would totally do something

02:25:16.480 --> 02:25:18.360
in the style of the guardian legend.

02:25:18.360 --> 02:25:19.520
Awesome.

02:25:19.520 --> 02:25:21.080
I need people to help me make this happen.

02:25:21.080 --> 02:25:25.160
I'm telling you though, don't, don't, don't make the mistake I've made for this long.

02:25:25.160 --> 02:25:28.440
Flacco said you need to check out velocity and I finally did and I was like, he was right.

02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:29.440
I do.

02:25:29.440 --> 02:25:30.440
I'm going to check that out.

02:25:30.440 --> 02:25:31.440
Anyway.

02:25:31.440 --> 02:25:32.440
Next email.

02:25:32.440 --> 02:25:33.440
Yes.

02:25:33.440 --> 02:25:34.440
Uh, greetings.

02:25:34.440 --> 02:25:35.440
OLR.

02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:36.440
It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

02:25:36.440 --> 02:25:37.440
Serious turtle.

02:25:37.440 --> 02:25:39.560
Rob, based on what you've been playing every week for some time now, I picked up reaper

02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:40.560
of souls on sale.

02:25:40.560 --> 02:25:44.560
I'm loving it and I'm definitely having a lonely turtle in need of friends.

02:25:44.560 --> 02:25:49.640
Does OLR, does OLR or VOG have a clan or anything that I can join?

02:25:49.640 --> 02:25:53.080
I'd love to play with members of the show or VOG community.

02:25:53.080 --> 02:25:54.080
Nope.

02:25:54.080 --> 02:25:58.600
Um, then, uh, no actually, horde house has one.

02:25:58.600 --> 02:25:59.820
So I've got that.

02:25:59.820 --> 02:26:03.320
So if you want to join the horde house, my other show, horde house, if you want to join

02:26:03.320 --> 02:26:07.680
the horde house hotties, uh, we, I'm going to, I forgot to do it after the show this

02:26:07.680 --> 02:26:09.920
week cause I still need to post to horde house.

02:26:09.920 --> 02:26:10.920
I'm way behind.

02:26:10.920 --> 02:26:14.960
Um, but, uh, on the forums I'll post more information, including battle tags of who

02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:17.880
you can contact if you want to join the horde house hotties.

02:26:17.880 --> 02:26:19.360
So we do have that.

02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:22.880
And then, uh, he said, sends me condolences about grandma.

02:26:22.880 --> 02:26:23.880
So thank you.

02:26:23.880 --> 02:26:27.320
Um, Loki finish your game already so I can play it.

02:26:27.320 --> 02:26:30.760
I'm looking forward to what you've come up with and I hope you're smart enough to sell

02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:33.080
an amiibo for the game, especially separately.

02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:34.080
Of course.

02:26:34.080 --> 02:26:35.080
Of course.

02:26:35.080 --> 02:26:36.920
And it won't do anything like regular amiibos.

02:26:36.920 --> 02:26:37.920
Stop it.

02:26:37.920 --> 02:26:41.200
I'll say it like I do in every email your show gets me through my Mondays, your loyal

02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:42.200
turtle in Philly.

02:26:42.200 --> 02:26:43.200
Serious turtle.

02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:44.200
Thank you.

02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:45.960
That, that means a lot that we can help you out with your Monday.

02:26:45.960 --> 02:26:46.960
Really appreciate that.

02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:48.960
I'm pulling up the next one.

02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:49.960
Sure.

02:26:49.960 --> 02:26:50.960
Sorry.

02:26:50.960 --> 02:26:51.960
My voice is going out.

02:26:51.960 --> 02:26:52.960
That's all right.

02:26:52.960 --> 02:26:53.960
Look.

02:26:53.960 --> 02:26:54.960
Oh, sorry.

02:26:54.960 --> 02:26:55.960
I was going to read some comments in chat to help do the time here.

02:26:55.960 --> 02:27:00.160
Uh, bonds, double a six saying I want a new, I've never ending story movie.

02:27:00.160 --> 02:27:01.160
Mm hmm.

02:27:01.160 --> 02:27:05.120
Uh, Bobby black will says, I hear there's a Hobbit remake coming soon and then a hunger

02:27:05.120 --> 02:27:06.120
games remake.

02:27:06.120 --> 02:27:07.120
Oh, who knows?

02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:08.120
Who knows?

02:27:08.120 --> 02:27:09.640
Uh, probably just a matter of time.

02:27:09.640 --> 02:27:13.760
Black will says a never ending story remake with only females.

02:27:13.760 --> 02:27:14.760
You never know.

02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:20.120
Uh, if it's SGA 100, Matt says a mean girls remake with guys, uh, and you know, bonds

02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:23.760
double a six says still, unless all the guys are gay.

02:27:23.760 --> 02:27:26.680
That's actually on YouTube.

02:27:26.680 --> 02:27:27.680
It's mean gays.

02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:28.680
Look it up on YouTube.

02:27:28.680 --> 02:27:29.680
Okay.

02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:31.800
But I'd rather it be called bitchy boys.

02:27:31.800 --> 02:27:36.880
Uh, and bonds double a six says still no unit racers meet remake.

02:27:36.880 --> 02:27:41.080
Maybe that could be the game Nintendo announces to save the Wii U this holiday.

02:27:41.080 --> 02:27:43.560
Uniracers you can I read the next email?

02:27:43.560 --> 02:27:44.560
All right.

02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:46.440
I think they're going to try to see peoples.

02:27:46.440 --> 02:27:52.920
Um, and then the article about the final fantasy 15 director saying about the all male cast.

02:27:53.080 --> 02:27:56.600
Um, at this point in the show, you probably covered the comments by final fantasy five

02:27:56.600 --> 02:28:03.120
director Hajime Tabata about making the cast and final fantasy 15 all male to make the

02:28:03.120 --> 02:28:04.560
game more approachable quotes.

02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:05.840
No, we haven't.

02:28:05.840 --> 02:28:10.960
I thought I would add in my thoughts because honestly it's bullshit.

02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:13.200
And funny enough, it's not on our show tonight.

02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:15.200
So here's our opportunity to bring it up.

02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:20.140
Why, why couldn't he just say the decision to go the all male cast was part of the plot.

02:28:20.140 --> 02:28:24.100
People who are aware that the final fantasy series of games are plot driven would have

02:28:24.100 --> 02:28:26.260
bought that as an excuse, at least for a little while.

02:28:26.260 --> 02:28:30.660
And some people are either of two different conclusions about this move.

02:28:30.660 --> 02:28:36.620
One, this move is driven by a misinterpretation of the market for these games to squirt index

02:28:36.620 --> 02:28:41.340
has joined Spanky and Alfalfa in the He-Man Woman Haters Club.

02:28:41.340 --> 02:28:46.860
Stay care entertainment trainer sent from my iPad, which was in the email.

02:28:46.860 --> 02:28:47.860
I know.

02:28:47.860 --> 02:28:48.860
I know.

02:28:48.860 --> 02:28:55.820
I, I get, I, I, it's not so much the fact that the story is about four guys that bothers

02:28:55.820 --> 02:28:56.820
me.

02:28:56.820 --> 02:29:01.700
Cause you know, I've seen enough movie, stand by me, stand by me is about four guys.

02:29:01.700 --> 02:29:02.700
Right.

02:29:02.700 --> 02:29:04.620
And that's just part of the story and the plot device.

02:29:04.620 --> 02:29:08.540
But at the same time, I do understand you have this separate conversation about, you

02:29:08.540 --> 02:29:10.260
know, diversity and games and dah, dah, dah.

02:29:10.260 --> 02:29:11.260
And I get that.

02:29:11.260 --> 02:29:17.260
And y'all know I'm for that, but I, do you want to elaborate on your thoughts real quick

02:29:17.260 --> 02:29:18.260
here?

02:29:18.260 --> 02:29:19.340
Who cares about diversity in games?

02:29:19.340 --> 02:29:20.340
I do.

02:29:20.340 --> 02:29:21.340
Yeah.

02:29:21.340 --> 02:29:24.340
Who cares about there being four guys in this game that are the leads in the game.

02:29:24.340 --> 02:29:26.380
This is what they decided that they want to do with it.

02:29:26.380 --> 02:29:27.380
That's it.

02:29:27.380 --> 02:29:28.380
If you don't like the game, don't play it.

02:29:28.380 --> 02:29:33.780
I understand why should there be fucking females and males in every single goddamn game.

02:29:33.780 --> 02:29:35.360
You can have all female cast.

02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:36.500
You can have all male cast.

02:29:36.500 --> 02:29:38.180
You can have a mix of both.

02:29:38.180 --> 02:29:39.180
You can have cats and dogs.

02:29:39.180 --> 02:29:40.660
Who gives a shit?

02:29:40.660 --> 02:29:42.180
Here's here's what it boils down to.

02:29:42.180 --> 02:29:43.420
Here's what it boils down to.

02:29:43.420 --> 02:29:48.940
I'm fine with them wanting to do the game about four, four bros or whatever, you know,

02:29:48.940 --> 02:29:55.180
and I'm sure there'll be supporting characters, but here's the thing is that clearly the industry

02:29:55.180 --> 02:29:57.820
as a whole has an issue.

02:29:57.820 --> 02:30:04.620
And I think if Square Enix can show that they can address the bigger issue, then fine.

02:30:04.620 --> 02:30:07.500
They can make whatever these games are that they want to make, but the industry as a whole

02:30:07.500 --> 02:30:09.540
kind of has to answer for the other issue.

02:30:10.540 --> 02:30:15.740
This is literally like the only Final Fantasy game that they've had that's had all males

02:30:15.740 --> 02:30:18.500
as like the party in the game.

02:30:18.500 --> 02:30:21.820
Everything else has been like diversified, if you want to put it that way.

02:30:21.820 --> 02:30:26.440
I mean, we've had fucking Yetis in there and stuff, but who cares?

02:30:26.440 --> 02:30:27.440
That's what I'm saying.

02:30:27.440 --> 02:30:28.440
Who gives a shit?

02:30:28.440 --> 02:30:30.380
I mean, your rest of your games are all like that.

02:30:30.380 --> 02:30:32.620
They want to make a game that has all guys in it.

02:30:32.620 --> 02:30:33.620
Then fine.

02:30:33.620 --> 02:30:37.780
They had a game already that had a female lead and she was the only playable character.

02:30:37.780 --> 02:30:40.120
I think that's fucking even enough.

02:30:40.120 --> 02:30:42.300
Why does it have to be like, oh, well, we don't like that?

02:30:42.300 --> 02:30:43.780
Well, too bad you don't like it.

02:30:43.780 --> 02:30:44.780
Don't play it.

02:30:44.780 --> 02:30:45.780
I don't like sports games.

02:30:45.780 --> 02:30:48.580
I'm not saying stop making sports games.

02:30:48.580 --> 02:30:49.580
That's my thing.

02:30:49.580 --> 02:30:50.580
It's like, who gives a shit?

02:30:50.580 --> 02:30:54.300
It's their story that they want to tell if they feel that it needs four male characters

02:30:54.300 --> 02:30:57.300
in the lead roles, then that's fine.

02:30:57.300 --> 02:31:01.260
Once again, because of our industry and because it's diversified, we have a lot of people

02:31:01.260 --> 02:31:07.700
out there creating games that have a bunch of different mixes of groups, race, gender,

02:31:07.700 --> 02:31:12.500
you know, sexual orientation, species in their games.

02:31:12.500 --> 02:31:16.980
I don't understand why we have to force other games to kind of go by that.

02:31:16.980 --> 02:31:20.100
I mean, it's not like Final Fantasy is all male, all of your games.

02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:25.400
For the record, we only have one confirmed asexual character in any game ever that actually

02:31:25.400 --> 02:31:27.940
is flesh and blood, just saying.

02:31:27.940 --> 02:31:32.220
Maya from Borderlands 2.

02:31:32.220 --> 02:31:36.660
So I, again, I think we have to kind of, I don't think it's so much about the decision

02:31:36.660 --> 02:31:41.300
to put the four, again, there's plenty of movies out there that do it too, but it's

02:31:41.300 --> 02:31:47.940
about can the games industry as a whole show that level of maturity that the movies industry

02:31:47.940 --> 02:31:48.940
had to show?

02:31:48.940 --> 02:31:51.420
I just, I don't know.

02:31:51.420 --> 02:31:58.460
I think the problem is much larger than one game, and you know, to Loki's credit, Square

02:31:58.460 --> 02:32:04.740
Enix has brought us an amazing female protagonist in the form of Lara Croft, so in the Square

02:32:04.740 --> 02:32:07.700
Enix games themselves, they tend to show a little bit of diversity.

02:32:07.700 --> 02:32:09.820
Even Lightning, if you want to stick with Final Fantasy.

02:32:09.820 --> 02:32:10.820
Sure.

02:32:10.820 --> 02:32:11.820
So, you know, anyway.

02:32:11.820 --> 02:32:16.620
Or fuck, Final Fantasy X-2 or whatever.

02:32:16.620 --> 02:32:17.620
There you go.

02:32:17.620 --> 02:32:19.020
All female cast right there.

02:32:19.020 --> 02:32:21.180
I don't understand what the problem is.

02:32:21.180 --> 02:32:23.260
Like, they've done it both ways.

02:32:23.260 --> 02:32:24.440
I think that's pretty even.

02:32:24.440 --> 02:32:28.660
I really don't think that they have, people have a say in, I guess, I mean, you can say

02:32:28.660 --> 02:32:32.060
whatever you want, but I don't think they should do anything about it, because I think

02:32:32.060 --> 02:32:34.900
they've fairly represented the whole gamut.

02:32:34.900 --> 02:32:35.900
All right.

02:32:35.900 --> 02:32:41.060
Looking at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

02:32:41.060 --> 02:32:42.060
Let's see.

02:32:42.060 --> 02:32:45.660
SSU100Matt suggesting Sid is a brilliant inventor and mechanic, and they made the character

02:32:45.660 --> 02:32:48.940
as a woman in Final Fantasy XV.

02:32:48.940 --> 02:32:53.500
Fifth Dream in chat says, I'm saying stop making sports games.

02:32:53.500 --> 02:32:59.380
Brad from Pod Culture says, equal opportunity, a DOA game where you can adjust the junk jangle.

02:32:59.380 --> 02:33:01.220
All right.

02:33:01.220 --> 02:33:02.220
Anyhow.

02:33:02.220 --> 02:33:03.220
I would play that.

02:33:03.220 --> 02:33:07.220
I just want a game called junk jangle.

02:33:07.220 --> 02:33:10.460
Anyhow.

02:33:10.460 --> 02:33:11.460
Any more to email?

02:33:11.460 --> 02:33:12.460
Yes.

02:33:12.460 --> 02:33:13.460
We have another email.

02:33:13.460 --> 02:33:14.460
Okay.

02:33:14.460 --> 02:33:15.460
Cheese Rob.

02:33:15.460 --> 02:33:16.460
Hello, LR.

02:33:16.460 --> 02:33:20.020
I have to be at work early tomorrow, so I wasn't able to join you all live tonight,

02:33:20.020 --> 02:33:22.940
but I need to say something.

02:33:22.940 --> 02:33:25.860
Who was it that recommended the mobile game King of Thieves?

02:33:25.860 --> 02:33:26.860
Was it Kaijuto?

02:33:26.860 --> 02:33:28.860
Well, there's something I need to say to that person.

02:33:28.860 --> 02:33:31.060
Are you happy with what you've done?

02:33:31.060 --> 02:33:32.880
I'm now a hopeless addict.

02:33:32.880 --> 02:33:35.580
My life is in tattered ruins, or maybe that's my dungeon.

02:33:35.580 --> 02:33:39.100
Anyway, thank you very much for ruining my life, you jerk.

02:33:39.100 --> 02:33:42.220
Now, excuse me while I steal someone's gems.

02:33:42.220 --> 02:33:46.900
The stone league has only 24 hours left, and I'm 6,000 points behind.

02:33:46.900 --> 02:33:49.660
Exploding ferrets upon your family, Aaron YYR.

02:33:49.660 --> 02:33:54.460
PS, you should at least give this game a look if you don't mind having your life ruined.

02:33:54.460 --> 02:33:57.820
Yes, that was Kaijuto that recommended that game to me.

02:33:58.700 --> 02:34:01.580
He brought it up on the show, and then I brought it up on the show that, yes, I checked it

02:34:01.580 --> 02:34:03.500
out, and yes, I had fun with it.

02:34:03.500 --> 02:34:04.500
And so there you go.

02:34:04.500 --> 02:34:08.060
So maybe in our little OL army, we all have our titles, right?

02:34:08.060 --> 02:34:09.060
I'm the president.

02:34:09.060 --> 02:34:10.580
Darth Vader is the overlord.

02:34:10.580 --> 02:34:11.580
Loki's the pope.

02:34:11.580 --> 02:34:13.340
Kaijuto can be the life ruiner.

02:34:13.340 --> 02:34:15.220
There you go.

02:34:15.220 --> 02:34:16.220
Ruiner of lives.

02:34:16.220 --> 02:34:18.220
Is that it for emails tonight?

02:34:18.220 --> 02:34:19.220
Yes.

02:34:19.220 --> 02:34:21.500
By the way, do you have any pizza left?

02:34:21.500 --> 02:34:22.500
Yes, I do.

02:34:22.500 --> 02:34:24.300
May I have a slice?

02:34:24.300 --> 02:34:25.300
You may.

02:34:25.300 --> 02:34:26.500
It's terribly greasy, though.

02:34:26.500 --> 02:34:27.500
I don't care.

02:34:27.500 --> 02:34:30.380
I'm sitting here, my stomach rumbling.

02:34:30.380 --> 02:34:35.420
Participate at, very important updates, participate at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send

02:34:35.420 --> 02:34:40.220
us an email for next week, or the week after, or whenever you feel like you have something

02:34:40.220 --> 02:34:41.220
to say.

02:34:41.220 --> 02:34:42.220
You aren't shitting.

02:34:42.220 --> 02:34:45.500
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:34:45.500 --> 02:34:48.700
Every week on the show, we, are you okay, are you going to be okay over there, Dark

02:34:48.700 --> 02:34:49.700
Sakura?

02:34:49.700 --> 02:34:50.700
Oh my God, it's the whole week.

02:34:50.700 --> 02:34:54.060
Okay, Dark Sakura is about ready to barf live in studio.

02:34:54.060 --> 02:34:55.060
That's awkward.

02:34:56.060 --> 02:34:58.060
But we're going to do the FUs of the week right now.

02:35:14.060 --> 02:35:15.060
Dark Sakura.

02:35:15.060 --> 02:35:16.060
Number one, fuck this pizza.

02:35:16.060 --> 02:35:17.060
It's delicious.

02:35:17.060 --> 02:35:18.060
And salty.

02:35:18.060 --> 02:35:19.060
You weren't kidding.

02:35:19.060 --> 02:35:23.060
Yeah, I told you there could be possibly too much bacon on that pizza.

02:35:23.060 --> 02:35:24.060
It's pretty good.

02:35:24.060 --> 02:35:25.060
I don't even care.

02:35:25.060 --> 02:35:26.060
I'm so hungry right now.

02:35:26.060 --> 02:35:29.060
I've had a pita today.

02:35:29.060 --> 02:35:39.060
So, also FU to the guy driving the Corvette who decided it was a good idea to leave in

02:35:39.060 --> 02:35:42.060
and out of traffic on single lane roads.

02:35:42.060 --> 02:35:45.060
Yeah, fuck you.

02:35:45.060 --> 02:35:51.060
And, fuck you to my sinus infection.

02:35:51.060 --> 02:35:52.060
Loki?

02:35:52.060 --> 02:35:57.060
I guess FU to having to still tweak my game.

02:35:57.060 --> 02:36:01.060
I'm still making more levels and stuff, but like this other level I'm making that is supposed

02:36:01.060 --> 02:36:06.060
to be focused on kind of teaching you that you can jump in your car.

02:36:06.060 --> 02:36:09.060
I still have to figure out how I'm going to break it yet.

02:36:09.060 --> 02:36:11.060
And it's kind of annoying.

02:36:11.060 --> 02:36:12.060
Invisible ceilings.

02:36:12.060 --> 02:36:18.060
No, no, no, not invisible ceilings, but I need something else like obstacles in a way

02:36:18.060 --> 02:36:19.060
or something.

02:36:19.060 --> 02:36:20.060
I just haven't figured out what.

02:36:21.060 --> 02:36:22.060
I don't know.

02:36:22.060 --> 02:36:23.060
It's just something ridiculous.

02:36:23.060 --> 02:36:26.060
I haven't quite gotten there yet.

02:36:26.060 --> 02:36:27.060
Is that it?

02:36:27.060 --> 02:36:28.060
Yeah.

02:36:28.060 --> 02:36:31.060
I just don't know what I'm going to do with that.

02:36:31.060 --> 02:36:32.060
Oh, God.

02:36:32.060 --> 02:36:35.060
I kind of have a lot I want to say in this FU segment, but I don't really have the words

02:36:35.060 --> 02:36:36.060
for them right now.

02:36:36.060 --> 02:36:43.060
So I'm just going to say FU to complicated things that happen.

02:36:43.060 --> 02:36:48.060
I'm being vague for a reason, but there's just some complicated things that happened

02:36:48.060 --> 02:36:49.060
recently.

02:36:50.060 --> 02:36:51.060
Is it that thing?

02:36:51.060 --> 02:36:53.060
I've been thinking about a lot.

02:36:53.060 --> 02:36:55.060
Yes, we talked about it briefly before the show tonight.

02:36:55.060 --> 02:36:59.060
And so you know, I'm kind of like I have a lot I want to say and yet I don't want to

02:36:59.060 --> 02:37:00.060
say it.

02:37:00.060 --> 02:37:04.060
So I will add in equal amounts of FU attention.

02:37:04.060 --> 02:37:09.060
So I apologize for being vague, but at the same time, this is just like where I've fucking

02:37:09.060 --> 02:37:10.060
been at for like 48 hours.

02:37:10.060 --> 02:37:15.060
So FU to being vague.

02:37:15.060 --> 02:37:18.060
Sorry, that's all I got.

02:37:18.060 --> 02:37:21.060
All right, let's move on with a couple more stories.

02:37:21.060 --> 02:37:26.060
And then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype,

02:37:26.060 --> 02:37:28.060
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:37:28.060 --> 02:37:29.060
Loki.

02:37:29.060 --> 02:37:34.060
So this is kind of disappointing, but I guess it makes sense considering, you know, the

02:37:34.060 --> 02:37:36.060
events that have transpired.

02:37:36.060 --> 02:37:44.060
But apparently Gen Con is looking to relocate from their location in Indiana.

02:37:44.060 --> 02:37:50.060
They're basically saying that, you know, they for a decade more than a decade Indianapolis

02:37:50.060 --> 02:37:55.060
has provided tremendous hospitality and accommodation to our attendees culminating in an estimated

02:37:55.060 --> 02:37:59.060
economic impact of more than 50 million dollars to the city.

02:37:59.060 --> 02:38:04.060
Gen Con and its attendees look forward to receiving the same warm Hoosier hospitality

02:38:04.060 --> 02:38:06.060
throughout the term of our contract.

02:38:06.060 --> 02:38:12.060
It says legislation that could allow for refusal of services or discrimination against our

02:38:12.060 --> 02:38:13.060
attendees.

02:38:13.060 --> 02:38:17.060
We'll have a direct negative impact on the state's economy and we'll factor in our decision

02:38:17.060 --> 02:38:22.060
in making on hosting the convention in the state of Indiana in future years.

02:38:22.060 --> 02:38:27.060
So basically because of SB 101, they're thinking of moving it.

02:38:27.060 --> 02:38:31.060
I do want to say I have to jump in here with a follow up because I was following this pretty

02:38:31.060 --> 02:38:34.060
closely because obviously, you know, when I heard the news about what happened in Indiana,

02:38:34.060 --> 02:38:36.060
I was just like, what the fuck?

02:38:36.060 --> 02:38:38.060
You know, like I think many people were.

02:38:38.060 --> 02:38:42.060
Gen Con actually came out since that first came out and actually did reiterate that they're

02:38:42.060 --> 02:38:46.060
kind of stuck there for, uh, until 2020 because of contractual obligations.

02:38:46.060 --> 02:38:50.060
So they will actually not be relocating next year despite the threat.

02:38:50.060 --> 02:38:56.060
However, they really bent over backwards to say, you know, the local businesses that we're

02:38:56.060 --> 02:39:00.060
going to work with here in Indianapolis are not signing up for the, and they're not going

02:39:00.060 --> 02:39:01.060
to discriminate.

02:39:01.060 --> 02:39:04.060
We want to welcome all our attendees, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

02:39:04.060 --> 02:39:06.060
Uh, it leaves, I don't know.

02:39:06.060 --> 02:39:11.060
I'm, I'm very, I'm very torn on this because I do feel like there's probably a lot of people

02:39:11.060 --> 02:39:16.060
in Indianapolis and Gen Con that want nothing to do with this fucking law.

02:39:16.060 --> 02:39:22.060
Like they want nothing to do with this back at S word Z and, or excuse me, bullshittery

02:39:22.060 --> 02:39:25.060
since I learned that word tonight and what happened in Indiana is bullshittery.

02:39:25.060 --> 02:39:26.060
Let's be real.

02:39:26.060 --> 02:39:28.060
Uh, so.

02:39:28.060 --> 02:39:35.060
I kind of understand from that perspective, but I also understand the need to take an

02:39:35.060 --> 02:39:40.060
iron fist and have an iron stance because the reality of the situation and delivering

02:39:40.060 --> 02:39:45.060
that message to the governor that this is not okay, doesn't get delivered otherwise.

02:39:45.060 --> 02:39:50.060
But I think what's happening, not to get too political here on OLR, but obviously I have

02:39:50.060 --> 02:39:57.060
somewhat of an interest in this story here because the reality is I, with Alan, could

02:39:57.060 --> 02:40:00.060
one day decide, I don't know why we would do this, but we, well, we might decide we

02:40:00.060 --> 02:40:01.060
want to go to Gen Con.

02:40:01.060 --> 02:40:03.060
I do have friends that go to Gen Con and have a good time.

02:40:03.060 --> 02:40:10.060
We might go there to Indiana and somebody could legally choose to discriminate against

02:40:10.060 --> 02:40:11.060
me.

02:40:11.060 --> 02:40:14.060
And so I'm kind of like, that's fucking fucked.

02:40:14.060 --> 02:40:18.060
So, I mean, I appreciate that the organizers of Gen Con are making sure that's not going

02:40:18.060 --> 02:40:21.060
to happen, any business near them or any of that stuff.

02:40:21.060 --> 02:40:25.060
But obviously a lot of stuff is happening with other companies.

02:40:25.060 --> 02:40:29.060
Like I got to give massive props to like Salesforce and what is that?

02:40:29.060 --> 02:40:30.060
Angie's List.

02:40:30.060 --> 02:40:31.060
Is that what that site's called?

02:40:32.060 --> 02:40:33.060
Yeah, Angie's List.

02:40:33.060 --> 02:40:39.060
Who have come out big time to like say, not okay, and we're not going to do business in

02:40:39.060 --> 02:40:40.060
a state.

02:40:40.060 --> 02:40:41.060
And the guy acts so confused.

02:40:41.060 --> 02:40:44.060
Well, why is everybody being mean to me?

02:40:44.060 --> 02:40:45.060
Right?

02:40:45.060 --> 02:40:48.060
Because you're a shit?

02:40:48.060 --> 02:40:53.060
I would hope that the people of Indiana who do not believe in this bullshittery, and I

02:40:53.060 --> 02:40:55.060
know there's decent people in Indiana.

02:40:55.060 --> 02:41:00.060
I know some of y'all listen to this show, hi, act against this.

02:41:01.060 --> 02:41:02.060
It blows my mind.

02:41:02.060 --> 02:41:09.060
Here in the state of California in 2003, we recalled our governor over rolling blackouts

02:41:09.060 --> 02:41:10.060
and power issues.

02:41:12.060 --> 02:41:15.060
But the governor of Indiana is going to be allowed to stay after this.

02:41:15.060 --> 02:41:18.060
Did you see what the mayor of San Francisco is doing?

02:41:18.060 --> 02:41:21.060
Oh, they stopped all traveled Indiana.

02:41:21.060 --> 02:41:23.060
Oh, officially sanctioned travel.

02:41:23.060 --> 02:41:27.060
And I was reading about other places refusing to do trade business.

02:41:28.060 --> 02:41:31.060
I just, it blows my mind people.

02:41:31.060 --> 02:41:32.060
It blows my mind anyway.

02:41:32.060 --> 02:41:38.060
So, uh, I'm, I'm a little sad to hear that Gen Con couldn't put its iron fist down, but

02:41:38.060 --> 02:41:44.060
I also, I'm also trying to be fair and realize that a lot of these businesses in Indianapolis

02:41:44.060 --> 02:41:47.060
probably want nothing to do with this fucking law and they're probably pissed about it.

02:41:47.060 --> 02:41:53.060
So again, to sum it up, my voice is if you're pissed about it, you need to let your lawmakers

02:41:53.060 --> 02:41:59.060
know, don't be passive about this shit because there's other people that aren't going to

02:41:59.060 --> 02:42:00.060
react so passively.

02:42:01.060 --> 02:42:02.060
Just saying.

02:42:02.060 --> 02:42:03.060
All right.

02:42:03.060 --> 02:42:04.060
Um, let's see.

02:42:04.060 --> 02:42:08.060
Um, and Brad from pod culture saying I'm from Indiana and I'm kind of ashamed of that fact

02:42:08.060 --> 02:42:09.060
right now.

02:42:09.060 --> 02:42:10.060
Watch what you say.

02:42:10.060 --> 02:42:14.060
I got that statement, got the Dixie chicks and a whole lot of trouble of my, you know,

02:42:14.060 --> 02:42:15.060
my friend Susan.

02:42:15.060 --> 02:42:16.060
Yeah.

02:42:16.060 --> 02:42:17.060
She moves in Susan.

02:42:17.060 --> 02:42:18.060
Yeah.

02:42:18.060 --> 02:42:19.060
Yeah.

02:42:19.060 --> 02:42:20.060
She's from Indiana.

02:42:20.060 --> 02:42:21.060
She said the same thing.

02:42:21.060 --> 02:42:25.220
There are tons of awesome people from Indiana of which these are two people I would put

02:42:25.220 --> 02:42:29.500
near the top of the list, but I will come out and say that when the Alabama Supreme

02:42:29.500 --> 02:42:34.060
Court was pulling the bullshit, I was really ashamed to be from there.

02:42:34.060 --> 02:42:38.180
And I'm going to say it on radio, I love where I'm from.

02:42:38.180 --> 02:42:41.780
I am super disappointed in my home state.

02:42:41.780 --> 02:42:45.820
I think because you all know, I volunteered for the no on eight campaign when that whole

02:42:45.820 --> 02:42:50.620
thing went down and yeah, no, I know, but when, when it, when it ended up passing, I

02:42:50.620 --> 02:42:52.140
don't know if I would say I was in shame.

02:42:52.140 --> 02:42:55.940
I was ashamed, but I was just embarrassed.

02:42:55.940 --> 02:42:58.820
I was just embarrassed.

02:42:58.820 --> 02:43:01.060
I'm still embarrassed that there's like that black mark.

02:43:01.060 --> 02:43:04.940
I mean, I realized it all got fixed up since then, but I'm still kind of like, that was

02:43:04.940 --> 02:43:07.220
just embarrassing.

02:43:07.220 --> 02:43:13.260
But you know, even in that short time, I have actually talked to people one on one that

02:43:13.260 --> 02:43:16.800
said, I voted yes on eight and I was wrong.

02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:18.140
I've changed my mind.

02:43:18.140 --> 02:43:19.440
I've thought differently.

02:43:19.440 --> 02:43:23.200
And so you have to kind of look at that and go, okay, progress.

02:43:23.200 --> 02:43:24.200
We're making progress.

02:43:24.200 --> 02:43:25.200
It's happening.

02:43:25.200 --> 02:43:28.880
I've talked to people who voted on it and said they would vote on it again.

02:43:28.880 --> 02:43:30.640
And I was like, why am I talking to you?

02:43:30.640 --> 02:43:35.960
That would be my reaction by Felicia.

02:43:35.960 --> 02:43:41.040
And the thing is, is that I really, it's, it's, I'm so disgusted with it.

02:43:41.040 --> 02:43:45.300
I'm literally disgusted to think that there are still people in this world who think that

02:43:45.300 --> 02:43:47.520
having that kind of attitude is right.

02:43:47.520 --> 02:43:48.520
Yeah.

02:43:48.600 --> 02:43:52.840
If you didn't know, if you didn't catch on to it already, I'm a gay guy who's here doing

02:43:52.840 --> 02:43:57.960
the show and I live with my partner and we're in a, we're in a relationship and we've been

02:43:57.960 --> 02:44:02.680
a long-term five years and, and you know, we're, we're, we're pretty decent people and

02:44:02.680 --> 02:44:10.240
I'm not really looking to corrupt people or I'm not, I don't have a fucking agenda.

02:44:10.240 --> 02:44:15.880
My agenda is to make sure the cat gets fed, uh, go to work every day so I can, you know,

02:44:15.920 --> 02:44:18.760
afford to have a place for me and my partner to live.

02:44:18.760 --> 02:44:21.400
I don't, I, I like to play video games too.

02:44:21.400 --> 02:44:22.400
Like a lot of you do.

02:44:22.400 --> 02:44:26.760
We're just, we're, we're not fucking like crazy people.

02:44:26.760 --> 02:44:29.320
Crazy people are in all sorts of, sure.

02:44:29.320 --> 02:44:30.560
There's gay, crazy people out there.

02:44:30.560 --> 02:44:32.360
There's a lot of straight, crazy people too.

02:44:32.360 --> 02:44:34.640
There's a lot of white, crazy people, a lot of black, crazy people.

02:44:34.640 --> 02:44:37.320
There are crazy people everywhere.

02:44:37.320 --> 02:44:45.840
As I told my mother, don't judge the entire LBGTQA et cetera community based on the praise

02:44:45.840 --> 02:44:49.000
it's a little crazy.

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:54.120
Now the one thing I was going to say is that I, now I grew up Southern Baptist.

02:44:54.120 --> 02:45:00.320
The attitudes that have formed this had a hand in my raising and I will say this, if

02:45:00.320 --> 02:45:09.320
y'all want to know what the hell the commandment is, it's one love God to love your neighbor.

02:45:09.320 --> 02:45:10.320
That's it.

02:45:10.320 --> 02:45:11.320
There's nothing on there.

02:45:11.320 --> 02:45:14.240
There's no except in that part of scripture at all.

02:45:14.240 --> 02:45:17.820
So the moment I hear this shit, I say, what does it say that in scripture you pointed

02:45:17.820 --> 02:45:18.820
out to me?

02:45:18.820 --> 02:45:19.820
Yeah.

02:45:19.820 --> 02:45:23.220
No, I, and I got to watch how far down the political religious route we go because we

02:45:23.220 --> 02:45:24.220
are a video game show.

02:45:24.220 --> 02:45:28.020
But at the same time, these are, these are issues that like fucking impact me.

02:45:28.020 --> 02:45:29.760
This is, this is my life.

02:45:29.760 --> 02:45:34.520
You know, when, when people are saying that, you know, there might be a business or a restaurant

02:45:34.520 --> 02:45:40.960
that you might go into that doesn't serve you because you know, of some agenda they

02:45:40.960 --> 02:45:41.960
made up.

02:45:41.960 --> 02:45:44.600
And that speech also gives people the right to pick at that place.

02:45:44.600 --> 02:45:45.600
Yeah.

02:45:45.600 --> 02:45:51.280
Anyway, moving on, uh, let's talk about, let's end on some positivity and charity and good

02:45:51.280 --> 02:45:52.280
things.

02:45:52.280 --> 02:45:57.620
And we're going to talk about a guy who you may not have knew was gay, just from my hometown

02:45:57.620 --> 02:46:04.240
and just, just happens to be a gay guy running like the biggest funky, funky, get down in

02:46:04.240 --> 02:46:05.240
funk.

02:46:05.240 --> 02:46:10.200
Uh, the biggest funky company in the world, Apple, uh, Apple CEO, Tim Cook has mentioned

02:46:10.200 --> 02:46:15.960
that he's going to donate his fortune to charity, uh, and that he's been quietly donating to

02:46:15.960 --> 02:46:17.880
causes for quite some time now.

02:46:17.880 --> 02:46:24.240
Uh, he looks forward to when he can actually just, uh, you know, engage in meaningful philanthropy

02:46:24.240 --> 02:46:26.080
on a greater scale later on in life.

02:46:26.080 --> 02:46:29.400
So I'm imagining talking about retirement and those sorts of things.

02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:33.680
Um, so I mean, in some of these other interviews, in some of the interviews and so forth, he

02:46:33.680 --> 02:46:38.600
said that he has enough set aside for like the nephew to get his nephew through college

02:46:38.600 --> 02:46:39.920
and all this stuff.

02:46:39.920 --> 02:46:44.480
But the vast majority of his fortune, he plans to turn around and donate to charity.

02:46:44.480 --> 02:46:48.560
Now I'm not saying everybody out there has to donate all of their money to charity.

02:46:48.560 --> 02:46:50.360
And what does this have to do with gaming?

02:46:50.360 --> 02:46:53.200
Well, Apple's getting a bigger and bigger presence.

02:46:53.200 --> 02:46:59.240
You know, 30% of whatever you buy on iTunes, uh, goes to Apple and some of that money goes

02:46:59.240 --> 02:47:00.240
to Tim Cook.

02:47:00.240 --> 02:47:05.640
So, you know, it's nice to know at least that some people want to turn it around and put

02:47:05.640 --> 02:47:08.900
that money back into their community in one way or another.

02:47:08.900 --> 02:47:12.040
But at the same time, if Tim Cook had come out and said, you know, I want to make sure

02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:16.980
that all my relatives are being provided for and so forth, I would, I would have been cool

02:47:16.980 --> 02:47:17.980
with that too.

02:47:17.980 --> 02:47:22.860
But I think it's really cool when you can say, I'm going to provide for this person,

02:47:22.860 --> 02:47:26.020
but to a point, you know, and then they're going to have to go out and make their own

02:47:26.020 --> 02:47:28.220
riches between providing and enabling.

02:47:28.220 --> 02:47:29.220
Yeah.

02:47:29.220 --> 02:47:32.500
I think that's, that's a good way of putting it just makes me super, super happy because

02:47:32.500 --> 02:47:33.500
he's from my hometown.

02:47:33.500 --> 02:47:34.500
Yeah.

02:47:34.500 --> 02:47:35.500
So, all right.

02:47:35.500 --> 02:47:36.500
There you go.

02:47:36.500 --> 02:47:41.500
So, uh, good to know that some of that money you're putting into iTunes today, uh, might

02:47:41.500 --> 02:47:44.300
go around and end up in charitable things in the future.

02:47:44.300 --> 02:47:48.820
But to be fair and, you know, to, to make sure everybody gets their praises, obviously

02:47:48.820 --> 02:47:52.940
Bill Gates, Microsoft, Bill Gates may not be as intimately involved in Microsoft as

02:47:52.940 --> 02:47:57.180
he once was, but certainly super charitable guy himself does a lot of great things and

02:47:57.180 --> 02:47:58.380
brings awareness to that stuff.

02:47:58.380 --> 02:48:02.260
So there's a lot of awesome charitable people in the tech industry and, uh, you know, we

02:48:02.260 --> 02:48:03.500
should tip our hat to him.

02:48:03.500 --> 02:48:04.500
All right.

02:48:04.500 --> 02:48:09.540
Uh, we're going to get to the phone lines right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR and your username

02:48:09.540 --> 02:48:10.540
on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:48:10.540 --> 02:48:15.260
Uh, if you want to give us a call, we're going to get to some calls here live on the show

02:48:15.260 --> 02:48:19.860
and then I'll also check in with Loki and see if he has any last minute topics.

02:48:19.860 --> 02:48:24.340
Uh, let's go to the phones, however, right now, cause I think we have the phones lighting

02:48:24.340 --> 02:48:25.340
up.

02:48:25.340 --> 02:48:26.340
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:48:26.340 --> 02:48:27.340
Who's this?

02:48:27.340 --> 02:48:28.340
Hi, this is Ragingator.

02:48:28.340 --> 02:48:29.340
Hey, Ragingator.

02:48:29.340 --> 02:48:30.340
How you doing?

02:48:30.340 --> 02:48:31.340
How about yourself?

02:48:31.340 --> 02:48:32.340
Good.

02:48:32.340 --> 02:48:33.340
Good.

02:48:33.340 --> 02:48:36.420
Ragingator, as you were calling yourself earlier in the show with a new haircut.

02:48:36.420 --> 02:48:37.420
I see.

02:48:37.420 --> 02:48:38.420
It looks like you buzzed your hair there.

02:48:38.420 --> 02:48:39.420
How you doing?

02:48:39.420 --> 02:48:44.300
Uh, yeah, I was in dire need of a haircut, you know, so I can't figure what the hell.

02:48:44.300 --> 02:48:45.780
It is sure as possible.

02:48:45.780 --> 02:48:47.180
Well, it looks good, my friend.

02:48:47.180 --> 02:48:48.180
How you doing?

02:48:48.180 --> 02:48:49.180
What's on your mind tonight?

02:48:49.180 --> 02:48:50.180
Uh, yeah.

02:48:50.180 --> 02:48:52.180
A couple of things to note.

02:48:52.180 --> 02:48:57.700
Um, I, you know, if you personally have noticed or not, uh, I would imagine you being kind

02:48:57.700 --> 02:49:05.780
of busy and whatnot, but, um, right now, if you look on Steam, there's, um, uh, this

02:49:05.780 --> 02:49:14.620
weekend, there's a sale on, uh, all of, uh, Sega's, uh, titles, uh, you know, if I remember

02:49:14.620 --> 02:49:15.620
right there.

02:49:15.620 --> 02:49:17.180
You want me to bring you up?

02:49:17.180 --> 02:49:19.580
I did see the sale itself on Steam.

02:49:19.580 --> 02:49:23.020
I did log into Steam this weekend because I looked at it and I went, ooh, Sega stuff's

02:49:23.020 --> 02:49:24.020
on sale.

02:49:24.020 --> 02:49:25.900
I need to make sure I have everything I want.

02:49:25.900 --> 02:49:29.340
And sure enough, things like Space Channel 5, I have them in my library.

02:49:29.340 --> 02:49:32.140
I just haven't played them since I bought them.

02:49:32.140 --> 02:49:34.020
And I brought, that's how I brought Deep Shame.

02:49:34.020 --> 02:49:39.340
I'm jumping out of a club, ugh, God, I, you know, not to sound like I'm bragging on, uh,

02:49:39.340 --> 02:49:45.620
that's not my intention, but I got shit ton of games myself and, uh, I only played a handful

02:49:45.620 --> 02:49:51.020
of them and I, of all my games, I haven't beaten a single one yet.

02:49:51.020 --> 02:49:57.380
Uh, but anyway, you know, getting back to my point, I can't figure, you know, this

02:49:57.380 --> 02:50:01.980
would probably be something that Sky would be interested in, uh, I already know that

02:50:01.980 --> 02:50:10.980
Dr. Sakura noticed because I seen, uh, she bought themself, but, um, but anyway, there

02:50:10.980 --> 02:50:17.620
was a second point to my, uh, call, but, uh, I'm starting to go, you know, get, uh, I'm

02:50:17.620 --> 02:50:18.620
brain farting.

02:50:18.620 --> 02:50:28.020
I forget what I was going to mention, uh, ooh, sorry, brain fart, um, you know, oh yeah,

02:50:28.020 --> 02:50:34.700
you know, uh, you know, well, since I'm brain farting on my second point, I'm going to make

02:50:34.700 --> 02:50:37.700
something up on the, uh, on the fly.

02:50:37.700 --> 02:50:47.380
Um, now, you know, if, uh, since, uh, uh, Sega's, uh, you know, put a lot of the Sega

02:50:47.380 --> 02:50:55.180
Genesis stuff, uh, on Steam, uh, you know, is there any, like, older console games that

02:50:55.180 --> 02:51:05.180
you would love to, uh, see on, uh, Steam or, uh, there's also some, uh, no, just, uh, console

02:51:05.180 --> 02:51:11.020
games, but arcade games, like, uh, I've seen Ikaruga on there, there was arcade game and

02:51:11.020 --> 02:51:16.100
of course there's the Pac-Man games, so on and so forth, other, you know, older arcade

02:51:16.100 --> 02:51:20.020
games as well that you would like to see on Steam.

02:51:20.020 --> 02:51:21.020
That's a really good question.

02:51:21.020 --> 02:51:24.940
What kind of, like, old arcade or old console games would you like to see on Steam?

02:51:24.940 --> 02:51:29.620
I think things that I remember from my youth with a strong co-op angle from it, um, and,

02:51:29.620 --> 02:51:33.460
you know, things come to mind, like the Ninja Turtles game and the Simpsons arcade game,

02:51:33.460 --> 02:51:37.100
but I thought the Simpsons arcade game was on, I don't know if it's on Steam, but I thought

02:51:37.100 --> 02:51:41.540
that was something they put on PC when they ported to all the other consoles some time

02:51:41.540 --> 02:51:42.540
ago.

02:51:42.540 --> 02:51:45.340
It was on PC a long time ago, too, because I had an old floppy version of it.

02:51:45.340 --> 02:51:46.880
Oh, god, that's right!

02:51:46.880 --> 02:51:50.420
There was, like, the whole, like, you could play on EGA and CGA and all, oh my god, that's

02:51:50.420 --> 02:51:51.420
right!

02:51:51.420 --> 02:51:54.420
Well, it was CGA, but yeah, it was, it was, it was, it was a version.

02:51:54.420 --> 02:51:58.980
Oh yeah, no, I remember, that's right, that's old school, but, um, yeah, I, I mean, I think

02:51:58.980 --> 02:52:02.480
about, like, arcade experiences like that and those are the types of things I would

02:52:02.520 --> 02:52:03.720
like to see on Steam.

02:52:03.720 --> 02:52:06.040
Is The Grid on Steam?

02:52:06.040 --> 02:52:08.880
Because I know we used to play a lot of that at, uh, Golf Land.

02:52:08.880 --> 02:52:13.360
Uh, maybe, uh, I don't know if this is old school, but maybe, like, Initial D. I don't

02:52:13.360 --> 02:52:15.160
know, you guys have any answers for this?

02:52:15.160 --> 02:52:17.360
What kind of, like, old school, either arcade or PC?

02:52:17.360 --> 02:52:19.640
The Grid's probably emulated through MAME now.

02:52:19.640 --> 02:52:21.120
I guess that's true.

02:52:21.120 --> 02:52:22.120
I don't know how well it would work.

02:52:22.120 --> 02:52:24.400
I wish Planet Harrier actually worked.

02:52:24.400 --> 02:52:26.400
I haven't been able to get it to work yet.

02:52:26.400 --> 02:52:27.400
Mm-hmm.

02:52:27.400 --> 02:52:29.080
There you go.

02:52:29.080 --> 02:52:30.080
Some of our answers here.

02:52:30.080 --> 02:52:31.080
What about you, buddy?

02:52:31.680 --> 02:52:38.600
Oh, there's so many, uh, unless it's, uh, hard to give a short, concise answer, uh,

02:52:38.600 --> 02:52:47.280
just off the top of my head, maybe some old, uh, you know, virtually, you know, the entire

02:52:47.280 --> 02:52:54.480
back catalog of, uh, Konami, you know, arcade games, uh, and miracle games like Galaga,

02:52:55.480 --> 02:53:04.280
you know, the 1980-19, like you mentioned, the Simpsons game, uh, so on and so forth.

02:53:04.280 --> 02:53:14.480
Um, and, ooh, I mean, there's so many games, it's hard to, uh, give a short answer.

02:53:14.480 --> 02:53:20.480
I mean, I can go on all nights and, you know, rallying them off as they occur to me, so,

02:53:20.480 --> 02:53:30.480
um, you know, I, I love retro stuff, and, uh, you know, even, and, uh, you know, when,

02:53:30.480 --> 02:53:37.480
uh, whatchamacallit, uh, you know, Game Room was out for, uh, you know, uh, you know, Xbox

02:53:37.480 --> 02:53:38.480
360, and, uh,

02:53:38.480 --> 02:53:41.480
God, you're gonna taunt me with memories of this again, aren't you?

02:53:41.480 --> 02:53:44.480
You're gonna taunt me with all the things that Game Room could have and should have

02:53:44.480 --> 02:53:47.480
been until the plug was prematurely pulled.

02:53:47.480 --> 02:53:49.480
Are we really gonna do this again?

02:53:50.480 --> 02:53:51.480
You're right.

02:53:51.480 --> 02:53:58.480
Yeah, oh, oh, yeah, um, not to quickly, you know, uh, switch tracks up before I forget

02:53:58.480 --> 02:54:06.480
again, um, if you recall, just at the end of, uh, Bobby's show, when he was taking calls,

02:54:06.480 --> 02:54:15.480
I called in, and, uh, I mentioned, uh, the arcade stick that I had recently, uh, bought,

02:54:15.480 --> 02:54:22.480
uh, you know, and I, I was seriously thinking, uh, thinking of doing a review, uh, for the

02:54:22.480 --> 02:54:28.480
site, because I, you know, to the best of my knowledge, I hardly ever see, uh, you know,

02:54:28.480 --> 02:54:32.480
a hardware review for, uh, the sites, unless I'm overlooking something.

02:54:32.480 --> 02:54:34.480
No, I, uh, why not?

02:54:34.480 --> 02:54:43.480
Which, uh, now, uh, Bobby mentioned, uh, emailing, uh, emailing, uh, a review, uh, which email,

02:54:43.480 --> 02:54:50.480
you know, address do I, uh, send, uh, send out the review to, or do I send it to, uh,

02:54:50.480 --> 02:54:53.480
participate OLR, or?

02:54:53.480 --> 02:54:58.480
No, send it, send it to me directly at vognetwork, rob at vognetwork.com, and, uh, I'll look it

02:54:58.480 --> 02:55:01.480
over, and if I have any feedback, I'll let you know, and, you know, yeah, we're always

02:55:01.480 --> 02:55:04.480
looking for more people that want to contribute to VOG Network.

02:55:04.480 --> 02:55:06.480
Um, I have to be very careful sometimes.

02:55:06.480 --> 02:55:07.480
It's a slippery slope.

02:55:07.480 --> 02:55:12.480
I don't want to go out and quote-unquote recruit writers, because we're an all-volunteer organization,

02:55:12.480 --> 02:55:16.480
and I realize there's writers out there that do great work and deserve to get paid for

02:55:16.480 --> 02:55:20.480
that work, and, but the reality is, you know, we're pretty much, you know, I don't get paid

02:55:20.480 --> 02:55:21.480
for this podcast.

02:55:21.480 --> 02:55:26.480
We actually pay out of pocket to do the site, so as it is right now, we're pretty much an

02:55:26.480 --> 02:55:30.480
all-volunteer, you know, group, but if somebody wants to contribute something, I've got a

02:55:30.480 --> 02:55:32.480
platform to run that contribution on.

02:55:32.480 --> 02:55:36.480
Let's do it, you know, so this is why I don't like to tell people what to write about.

02:55:36.480 --> 02:55:41.480
I want to just say, hey, voice of geeks, geeks, lend me your voices.

02:55:41.480 --> 02:55:42.480
What do you want to say?

02:55:42.480 --> 02:55:43.480
And see what happens.

02:55:43.480 --> 02:55:46.480
So, I think if I were to start bossing people around, then I'd have failed.

02:55:46.480 --> 02:55:47.480
Yeah, I've definitely seen your point.

02:55:47.480 --> 02:55:57.480
Uh, you know, honestly, I just felt like contributing something, you know, aside from the quote-unquote

02:55:57.480 --> 02:56:03.480
unofficial reviews I posted into the forums, uh, you know, regarding the two magic, uh,

02:56:03.480 --> 02:56:08.480
recent Magic the Gallery games that came out, uh, for the past few years, I thought I would

02:56:08.480 --> 02:56:14.480
do something more official that would be on the main site rather than just the forums.

02:56:14.480 --> 02:56:18.480
Well, send me an email, and that goes for anybody out there, just, just not to make

02:56:18.480 --> 02:56:21.480
this show just about you, Rage Nator, so this goes about for everybody out there.

02:56:21.480 --> 02:56:23.480
If you're interested, uh, send me an email.

02:56:23.480 --> 02:56:26.480
So, uh, I will look forward to reading your review soon.

02:56:26.480 --> 02:56:30.480
Uh, actually, I didn't hear the very end of Bobby's, uh, show, uh, when you called in

02:56:30.480 --> 02:56:34.480
because our guest had just showed up, so, um, I will, I will look for that when you

02:56:34.480 --> 02:56:35.480
email it.

02:56:35.480 --> 02:56:36.480
All right?

02:56:36.480 --> 02:56:40.480
Uh, sure, yeah, you know, in fact, I'll, you know, get started on the, the, you know,

02:56:40.480 --> 02:56:43.480
writing the review, uh, you know, first thing tomorrow.

02:56:43.480 --> 02:56:44.480
Sounds good.

02:56:44.480 --> 02:56:46.480
All right, my friend, I gotta let you know just so we can get more calls.

02:56:46.480 --> 02:56:47.480
Take care, my friend.

02:56:47.480 --> 02:56:48.480
All right.

02:56:48.480 --> 02:56:49.480
Good night.

02:56:49.480 --> 02:56:50.480
Bye.

02:56:50.480 --> 02:56:51.480
Later.

02:56:51.480 --> 02:56:54.480
All right, 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, but it's lighting

02:56:54.480 --> 02:56:55.480
up tonight.

02:56:55.480 --> 02:56:57.480
Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:56:57.480 --> 02:57:02.480
Hello, if you can hear me, I can't hear you, so make sure you're talking into your microphone

02:57:02.480 --> 02:57:03.480
or you...

02:57:03.480 --> 02:57:04.480
Whoa, Legend of Zaku here.

02:57:04.480 --> 02:57:05.480
Hey, Zaku, how you doing, buddy?

02:57:05.480 --> 02:57:06.480
Fine, as usual.

02:57:06.480 --> 02:57:08.480
What's on your mind?

02:57:08.480 --> 02:57:14.480
Oh, nothing much the usual of, uh, trying to get through seeing you and Paxis a few

02:57:14.480 --> 02:57:15.480
weeks back.

02:57:15.480 --> 02:57:18.480
I know, it was literally for, like, two seconds that I saw you.

02:57:18.480 --> 02:57:22.480
Yeah, well, I mean, it was, yeah, we were at that party that Friday night.

02:57:22.480 --> 02:57:24.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:57:24.480 --> 02:57:28.480
The, the, the, and I forget the name of it, 16-bit Boston or something like that, I know

02:57:28.480 --> 02:57:32.480
the gals from Electric Sisterhood were co-sponsoring it, but yeah, good times.

02:57:32.480 --> 02:57:39.480
Yup, I mean, yeah, I haven't been, well, let's just say aside from, like, whoring out FSX

02:57:39.480 --> 02:57:44.480
for the past few weeks as usual, spending godly amounts of money on planes, such as

02:57:44.480 --> 02:57:52.480
60 bucks, almost $60 on a 747, but aside from that, like, GTA 5's coming out on PC, and

02:57:52.480 --> 02:57:57.480
I guess, you know, because obviously I'm probably gonna get suckered into getting that one,

02:57:57.480 --> 02:58:01.480
I'm wondering whether or not it's, like, too late at this point, because, you know,

02:58:01.480 --> 02:58:06.480
I've, I've had to, like, plunk down money for the PS3 version, and after a few months

02:58:06.480 --> 02:58:11.480
of beating the game, there was nothing really other than to try GTA Online, and then now

02:58:11.480 --> 02:58:15.480
it's whether or not I should, you know, whether or not it's even worth getting back into it,

02:58:15.480 --> 02:58:20.480
even with the new Heist patch and everything.

02:58:21.480 --> 02:58:27.480
I know, it's kind of, like, because of the fact that I, I've already, I've already, like,

02:58:27.480 --> 02:58:32.480
already sailed that ship, and whether or not I should go back on board with the PC version

02:58:32.480 --> 02:58:36.480
because of the new graphics and the fact that I have a card that can actually handle it.

02:58:36.480 --> 02:58:39.480
Is that tough to want to buy the same game multiple times? Because maybe I'm the wrong

02:58:39.480 --> 02:58:44.480
person to ask about that, because can we talk about how many times I bought Mass Effect 3?

02:58:44.480 --> 02:58:49.480
Yeah, and the fact, and the fact of the matter that I haven't even bought that one yet,

02:58:49.480 --> 02:58:55.480
but I guess, yeah, whether or not that justifies, you know, the fact that I bought a GTX 970

02:58:55.480 --> 02:58:56.480
over the holidays.

02:58:56.480 --> 02:59:01.480
Really? Isn't that the fancy one? Isn't that the fancy pants graphic card?

02:59:01.480 --> 02:59:06.480
Yeah, and that was, and that's the thing, it's like, I had to pull together not just

02:59:06.480 --> 02:59:10.480
birthday and Christmas money to, you know, soften the blow, and then I had to take out

02:59:10.480 --> 02:59:15.480
a little bit of extra savings just to make, you know, just to get it through.

02:59:15.480 --> 02:59:20.480
But it's micro center, so it's not, that purchase has not gone in vain.

02:59:20.480 --> 02:59:26.480
Because at least, you know, with the two-year warranty, I could just hand it in, no questions

02:59:26.480 --> 02:59:30.480
asked, and, you know, get store credit for it for another card.

02:59:30.480 --> 02:59:34.480
Let me ask you about this, because I don't think we've had you on the show since this

02:59:34.480 --> 02:59:39.480
news kind of broke, and I think, I want to say you were actually the first person to

02:59:39.480 --> 02:59:42.480
kind of tell me this was going on, and then I started to get messages from everywhere,

02:59:42.480 --> 02:59:45.480
but this is, of course, I'm going to ask you, because I know you're a long time supporter

02:59:45.480 --> 02:59:48.480
of Konami and music games and so forth, I want to ask you about the whole, you know,

02:59:48.480 --> 02:59:56.480
shutdown and the EMUs global. As a Bomani fan, what do you think about where all this is going?

02:59:56.480 --> 03:00:02.480
Probably nowhere, just because of that company's disappointment.

03:00:02.480 --> 03:00:08.480
I mean, let's be honest here, the only time they really have taken risks was back in the

03:00:09.480 --> 03:00:12.480
days when this whole, you know, when music games were really starting to take off.

03:00:12.480 --> 03:00:18.480
Like, if it wasn't for them, like, taking the risk of bringing DDR worldwide, then yeah,

03:00:18.480 --> 03:00:23.480
I would have stayed in Japan. But then once they take the risk, then they become too comfortable

03:00:23.480 --> 03:00:31.480
with their position. And once they feel threatened as a result of competing forces,

03:00:31.480 --> 03:00:36.480
like, you know, for Pump It Up and, you know, back in the day with ITG,

03:00:36.480 --> 03:00:43.480
they resort to using the, you know, the courts in order to seek remedies for that.

03:00:43.480 --> 03:00:49.480
That is a really, I gotta say, that's a really succinct and good way of kind of summing it all up,

03:00:49.480 --> 03:00:55.480
and I think it's similar to something I've definitely said on the show before,

03:00:55.480 --> 03:00:59.480
is that they were too afraid to take risks, and then when other people took the risks and it paid off,

03:00:59.480 --> 03:01:05.480
they were like, how did we get left in the dust? Shouldn't this have been our idea?

03:01:05.480 --> 03:01:08.480
Was it our idea? Do we have a patent?

03:01:08.480 --> 03:01:14.480
It's not even like them being completely, you know, risk takers in that sense.

03:01:14.480 --> 03:01:19.480
It's more them being risk adverse and being reactive instead of being proactive.

03:01:19.480 --> 03:01:27.480
Supernova was a reaction to ITG. And then, you know, everything else like,

03:01:27.480 --> 03:01:37.480
and then further iterations of DER were essentially a reaction to Pump It Up, like, you know, early on.

03:01:37.480 --> 03:01:44.480
But I'm not holding my breath just because, as I said, even with the shakeup in leadership of that company,

03:01:44.480 --> 03:01:50.480
a lot of sources, from what I'm hearing, are still very wary of bringing EMU stateside,

03:01:50.480 --> 03:01:53.480
short of like round one taking care of that.

03:01:53.480 --> 03:02:00.480
And that really is yet to be seen whether or not round one has a viable chance expanding.

03:02:00.480 --> 03:02:03.480
I mean, sure, they're definitely hitting up the East Coast right now.

03:02:03.480 --> 03:02:07.480
From what I've seen on their site, they're trying to build one near Massachusetts.

03:02:07.480 --> 03:02:16.480
But as I said, this whole arcade scene here, to be honest, it's kind of like it's dying.

03:02:16.480 --> 03:02:20.480
And this is what Kyle Ward alluded to when I was talking to him at PAX East.

03:02:20.480 --> 03:02:26.480
He pretty much said that the front, I mean, the front right now is pretty much mobile.

03:02:26.480 --> 03:02:34.480
Getting re-raved to mobile was, you know, was probably one of the early, the initial goals aside from the arcade version.

03:02:34.480 --> 03:02:41.480
But even the new game that he had out, the one that we have to follow the actual notes for each measure.

03:02:41.480 --> 03:02:42.480
I believe it's called Ditto Beat.

03:02:42.480 --> 03:02:43.480
Yeah, something like that.

03:02:43.480 --> 03:02:50.480
And he basically targeted mobile first because that's the one with the lowest amount of overhead and risk.

03:02:50.480 --> 03:02:51.480
Sure.

03:02:51.480 --> 03:02:56.480
Anybody, just about any couple of devs, a small dev team could easily turn out a mobile app.

03:02:56.480 --> 03:03:00.480
Yeah, you're still taking a risk with time, but yeah, as far as the financial risk, yeah.

03:03:00.480 --> 03:03:10.480
But the financial, the fiscal overhead is so low that you definitely don't need massive, you know, you don't need multimillion dollar budgets to pull it off.

03:03:10.480 --> 03:03:14.480
You can do it with a simple bank loan or a small Kickstarter.

03:03:14.480 --> 03:03:15.480
Right.

03:03:15.480 --> 03:03:19.480
I mean, obviously you don't pay yourself, but you wait until you actually turn a profit.

03:03:19.480 --> 03:03:20.480
Right, right.

03:03:20.480 --> 03:03:22.480
In order to insure it.

03:03:22.480 --> 03:03:26.480
But yeah, it's unfortunate. We kind of knew this was going to happen.

03:03:26.480 --> 03:03:34.480
I remember talking to the guy who actually ran Program World back, you know, like many Otakons ago, you know, almost four years ago.

03:03:34.480 --> 03:03:40.480
And he pretty much said that the day when he got to C and D from them is the day that they start winding down.

03:03:40.480 --> 03:03:48.480
Because he kind of knew that once round one started expanding here that it was only a matter of time before they would find out.

03:03:48.480 --> 03:03:49.480
Yeah.

03:03:49.480 --> 03:03:52.480
All right. Well, my friend, I got to let you go so we can try to squeeze in one more call.

03:03:52.480 --> 03:03:54.480
But thanks for the call, for lending your voice.

03:03:54.480 --> 03:03:55.480
Yup.

03:03:55.480 --> 03:03:56.480
All right.

03:03:56.480 --> 03:03:57.480
Have a good night.

03:03:57.480 --> 03:03:58.480
Take care.

03:03:58.480 --> 03:03:59.480
Night.

03:03:59.480 --> 03:04:16.480
All right.

03:04:16.480 --> 03:04:17.480
Twat.

03:04:17.480 --> 03:04:19.480
Loki, any last minute stories?

03:04:19.480 --> 03:04:23.480
Yeah, they announced that Halo 5 is coming out October 27th.

03:04:23.480 --> 03:04:25.480
Oh, wow. Was that just announced?

03:04:25.480 --> 03:04:26.480
Yeah.

03:04:26.480 --> 03:04:27.480
We somehow missed that.

03:04:27.480 --> 03:04:28.480
All right. Well, there you go. Now we know.

03:04:28.480 --> 03:04:31.480
We do have one more call here. Let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

03:04:31.480 --> 03:04:35.480
Hey, hey. It's a tired and exhausted Ranma.

03:04:35.480 --> 03:04:38.480
Why are you tired and exhausted? Was there a con this weekend?

03:04:38.480 --> 03:04:42.480
Yeah, that and I was stuck in Jersey for 30 minutes more than I should have been.

03:04:42.480 --> 03:04:47.480
Oh, you poor thing. I wish our guest Gabriel from Jersey was still here to hear that.

03:04:47.480 --> 03:04:49.480
Yeah.

03:04:49.480 --> 03:04:51.480
Well, what con did you go to this week?

03:04:52.480 --> 03:04:59.480
Zenkai Con. It's out in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. It's a nice hybrid of anime, fantasy, sci-fi, and all that cool stuff.

03:04:59.480 --> 03:05:04.480
Isn't Lancaster, like, right in the heart of Dutch country? Or, no, I'm sorry. Amish Dutch country?

03:05:04.480 --> 03:05:09.480
Yeah, you passed the giant Dutch wonderland going to the convention center.

03:05:09.480 --> 03:05:10.480
That's awesome.

03:05:10.480 --> 03:05:11.480
Yes.

03:05:11.480 --> 03:05:17.480
So, you were out there with the Amish in your cosplays.

03:05:17.480 --> 03:05:23.480
Well, no, actually, I saw them when we were in Walmart picking up stuff for The Room, but, you know.

03:05:23.480 --> 03:05:27.480
Now, did somebody actually cosplay as the Amish to go to the con?

03:05:27.480 --> 03:05:29.480
No, not to my knowledge.

03:05:29.480 --> 03:05:33.480
God, people, do I have to do all the thinking for you? I'm just kidding.

03:05:33.480 --> 03:05:37.480
All right, all those silliness aside, how was the con?

03:05:37.480 --> 03:05:47.480
It was fun overall, despite, you know, the issues I had to deal with in The Room, you know, but other than that, made some great friends, had some good times.

03:05:47.480 --> 03:05:56.480
One thing I love about this con, it's like a cool down convention for me. In between all the cons that I go to, this is where I can just go and relax and have a good time.

03:05:56.480 --> 03:06:03.480
Nice. Good. Even though you're still worn out, but I know how that goes. You need a vacation from the vacation. I know exactly how that goes.

03:06:03.480 --> 03:06:06.480
Even when I got home from Boston, I was like, I need another week off work to recover.

03:06:06.480 --> 03:06:13.480
I know, right, but I didn't call in to talk about the con. There's a couple of things I wanted to cover real quick, then get the heck up and out of here.

03:06:13.480 --> 03:06:14.480
Go for it.

03:06:14.480 --> 03:06:21.480
Now, your guest I was on earlier, I was listening on the way in, and he was talking about the conventions and how they close early.

03:06:21.480 --> 03:06:25.480
If I was able to call in right into the day, I would have called in, because here's the thing.

03:06:25.480 --> 03:06:34.480
Conventions go, if there are conventions in the hotel, they will go all night long. Video rooms will either go to 3, 4 o'clock in the morning or all night.

03:06:34.480 --> 03:06:45.480
The reason why some cons shut down at 2, 2.30, because they're in a convention center, and union contract says at 2 or 2.30, the convention center closes down.

03:06:45.480 --> 03:06:47.480
There's no ifs, ands, or buts about that.

03:06:47.480 --> 03:06:57.480
That's usually a hotel versus convention center thing, right? Because even Dragon Con, like the quote-unquote convention center, which I guess is America Mart or whatever, you know, is kind of that.

03:06:57.480 --> 03:07:03.480
And that does close at like probably, I don't know, 10 o'clock or something, but the hotels, you know, go all night long.

03:07:03.480 --> 03:07:12.480
So I think, and if I'm not mistaken, MAGFest is at a hotel, Dragon Con's at hotels, you know, so if you have a convention that's at a hotel, it's more likely to go all day, all night.

03:07:12.480 --> 03:07:13.480
Whereas...

03:07:13.480 --> 03:07:15.480
That's why AX was a combination of the two.

03:07:15.480 --> 03:07:23.480
And what probably he was thinking about, because I told him, you know, we were making some difficult decisions at VOG, you know, are we going to do PAX East next year, are we going to do MAGFest next year?

03:07:23.480 --> 03:07:30.480
And right now, we're pretty much at this point all in for MAGFest 2016 and not doing PAX East.

03:07:30.480 --> 03:07:34.480
And I think that's probably where he was kind of noting, you know, PAX, they have to shut down.

03:07:34.480 --> 03:07:43.480
You know, to be fair, though, PAX is in a convention center, but, you know, looking at that comparison, I don't know, PAX does not go all day, all night.

03:07:44.480 --> 03:07:53.480
True, true, true. But then again, I do remember that one time I went to Fauna May and I stayed up till like 3 o'clock in the morning just to go to a, just to see a video presentation I wanted to see, so, you know.

03:07:53.480 --> 03:08:01.480
Well, who needs sleep at a convention, says the 20-year-olds, and then the 30-year-olds are like, me.

03:08:01.480 --> 03:08:06.480
See, at that point, that's when I'm like, you know what, I'm calling it a night at 4 AM.

03:08:06.480 --> 03:08:12.480
I'm only having like five people in the room because I need, I like to stretch out, you know, get my sleep on.

03:08:12.480 --> 03:08:16.480
The days of packing 8, 9, 10 people to a room are long gone.

03:08:16.480 --> 03:08:26.480
That's even my, yeah, that's my thing is like I can't do that anymore, like all those people in a hotel room, like I'm like two people in the room, that's about it.

03:08:26.480 --> 03:08:32.480
Or I will say GamerX, it was me, Alan, and Jamie in the room, and that was plenty.

03:08:32.480 --> 03:08:37.480
Three people, three's a crowd, okay? That was, it was a good crowd, but that was it.

03:08:38.480 --> 03:08:46.480
And DarkSakura, by the way, since you did have to sleep with two gay men, did we push an agenda on you? I'm just curious, did we push our agenda on you?

03:08:46.480 --> 03:08:50.480
Well, I'm not interested in cock or anything, so.

03:08:51.480 --> 03:09:05.480
Nope. Rob, seriously, and I've said this to people, if I ever had a problem with the gay agenda, I would not be able to do half the stuff I do at conventions.

03:09:05.480 --> 03:09:10.480
I'd probably be a hunted person. I would not be able to go to cons, do the part, a lot of stuff, you know?

03:09:10.480 --> 03:09:15.480
Because I look at this, I've hung out with gay people, I hang out with lesbians, it doesn't matter to me.

03:09:15.480 --> 03:09:19.480
They get part, it's just as hard as straight people. It doesn't matter to me.

03:09:19.480 --> 03:09:23.480
Yeah, I just, I like people. I just like people. That's it.

03:09:23.480 --> 03:09:25.480
If you're a dick, you're just a dick, you know?

03:09:25.480 --> 03:09:27.480
Alright, you said you had one other quick thing?

03:09:27.480 --> 03:09:34.480
Yeah, I believe Bobby talked about this last PAX, and we talked about it on OLR.

03:09:34.480 --> 03:09:40.480
That multi-function game, Artemis, where you're doing the spaceship simulation.

03:09:40.480 --> 03:09:42.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:09:42.480 --> 03:09:48.480
I meant to say about this before, but Zekai Khan had a full room dedicated to Artemis running the whole weekend.

03:09:48.480 --> 03:09:50.480
Oh, nice. Did you check that out? Did you play it?

03:09:50.480 --> 03:09:56.480
I think it's just to play it, but I was gonna get some pictures, but let's just say it was a bit of a wait to get in there to play.

03:09:56.480 --> 03:10:02.480
So I was like, I really couldn't wait around to get a chance to play, so you know.

03:10:02.480 --> 03:10:06.480
Oh, I bet. Wow. Well, that sounds like fun. I gotta check that out.

03:10:06.480 --> 03:10:09.480
It hasn't shown up at a con near me yet, but I'm hoping soon.

03:10:09.480 --> 03:10:11.480
Well, I'll keep an eye out, you know.

03:10:11.480 --> 03:10:14.480
Sounds good. Rama, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, alright?

03:10:14.480 --> 03:10:15.480
No problem, bro.

03:10:15.480 --> 03:10:16.480
Alright, take care my friend.

03:10:16.480 --> 03:10:17.480
You too.

03:10:17.480 --> 03:10:18.480
Alright, bye.

03:10:18.480 --> 03:10:21.480
Well, that is about gonna do it for another episode of OLR.

03:10:21.480 --> 03:10:25.480
Let me check in with Loki real quick for one other chance for last minute stories here.

03:10:25.480 --> 03:10:26.480
No, that's it.

03:10:26.480 --> 03:10:27.480
Alright, if you have a-

03:10:27.480 --> 03:10:31.480
Those screenshots from Grand Theft Auto on the PC version look awesome.

03:10:31.480 --> 03:10:32.480
Yeah, I know.

03:10:32.480 --> 03:10:33.480
My PC can't run it.

03:10:34.480 --> 03:10:36.480
Don't, you have to convince the guy to do one.

03:10:36.480 --> 03:10:41.480
I'll just have to live it on, you know, just play it on one or four systems, I don't know.

03:10:41.480 --> 03:10:42.480
There you go.

03:10:42.480 --> 03:10:48.480
Alright, well, if you have something you want to say about tonight's show or any other show or something in general you want us to bring up,

03:10:48.480 --> 03:10:54.480
like, you know, we had a topic in the mailbag tonight that wasn't on the agenda, just, you know, for whatever stories get slotted,

03:10:54.480 --> 03:10:59.480
you can always email us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

03:10:59.480 --> 03:11:01.480
I do try to read the tweets throughout the week.

03:11:01.480 --> 03:11:05.480
I know I've been really bad about addressing those on the show, but I do read all the tweets.

03:11:05.480 --> 03:11:12.480
So, you know, you can always get my attention at OLR on Twitter or my personal Twitter as well, at SKIE.

03:11:12.480 --> 03:11:16.480
Anyhow, that is the end of another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

03:11:16.480 --> 03:11:18.480
We're running pretty long tonight, but what a great show.

03:11:18.480 --> 03:11:25.480
I want to thank once again our friends from the Sacramento IGDA for joining us in studio tonight, Gabriel and Brianna.

03:11:25.480 --> 03:11:28.480
Be sure to check us out on April 11th when we're broadcasting live.

03:11:28.480 --> 03:11:38.480
And check out Gabriel's company, Crumple, the demo, which is available right now on Desura and soon, trademark.

03:11:38.480 --> 03:11:42.480
I mean, not like next month, soon, but soon in the future on the Wii U as well.

03:11:42.480 --> 03:11:43.480
So check that out.

03:11:43.480 --> 03:11:52.480
As I say at the end of every episode of Orange Lounge Radio, you know, we're not some mega, huge, multi-million dollar company or website.

03:11:52.480 --> 03:11:55.480
We're just a bunch of people doing this for fun because we like to do this for y'all.

03:11:55.480 --> 03:11:57.480
We like to hang out with each other and talk to each other.

03:11:57.480 --> 03:12:00.480
We like to hang out with you guys who show up for it every Sunday night.

03:12:00.480 --> 03:12:04.480
So, you know, if you liked what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, I'm not going to ask for your money.

03:12:04.480 --> 03:12:06.480
I just ask, spread the word.

03:12:06.480 --> 03:12:11.480
Tell a friend or two about the show and help spread the word here about where every gamer has a voice.

03:12:11.480 --> 03:12:15.480
Because if we don't know your voices out there, we can't put them out there.

03:12:15.480 --> 03:12:20.480
I mean, how long did it take for me to meet this guy five blocks from my house that was making games?

03:12:20.480 --> 03:12:29.480
Anyway, but, you know, spread the word and we can show up and get more indie developers and more game enthusiasts and everybody here on the show.

03:12:29.480 --> 03:12:30.480
So help spread the word.

03:12:30.480 --> 03:12:36.480
And if for whatever reason you can't think, you know, you can't think of five people to tell or you can't even think of one person to tell off the top of your head,

03:12:36.480 --> 03:12:40.480
it would be great to leave us a five-star review on iTunes or Stitcher Radio.

03:12:40.480 --> 03:12:45.480
Those reviews go a long way and we really appreciate that type of visibility as well.

03:12:45.480 --> 03:12:48.480
For now, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

03:12:48.480 --> 03:12:50.480
DarkSakura, I see you're packing up and getting ready to go.

03:12:50.480 --> 03:12:52.480
DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

03:12:52.480 --> 03:12:54.480
I'm tired of my nose.

03:12:54.480 --> 03:12:55.480
Feel better.

03:12:55.480 --> 03:12:57.480
Loki, your final thought tonight?

03:12:57.480 --> 03:13:05.480
I'm just tired, but, you know, I have another game concept that my wife really wants me to work on.

03:13:05.480 --> 03:13:09.480
I'm not doing it yet until I finish what I'm working on now.

03:13:09.480 --> 03:13:11.480
You'll never hear the end of it if you start another one.

03:13:11.480 --> 03:13:12.480
Alright.

03:13:12.480 --> 03:13:13.480
I'm not going to.

03:13:13.480 --> 03:13:14.480
Fair enough.

03:13:14.480 --> 03:13:19.480
My final thought for the day is I almost bought a 60-inch television today

03:13:19.480 --> 03:13:24.480
and I was just about to walk out the door at Sears until they told me,

03:13:24.480 --> 03:13:29.480
oh, gee, you know that TV that's on display, we actually don't have any in stock at any store nearby,

03:13:29.480 --> 03:13:32.480
nor can we do delivery when you do it online.

03:13:32.480 --> 03:13:35.480
And they wouldn't sell you the display bottle?

03:13:35.480 --> 03:13:41.480
And that is how Amazon got my purchase on a television that would have gone to Sears otherwise today,

03:13:41.480 --> 03:13:43.480
so just some food for thought.

03:13:45.480 --> 03:13:46.480
Just saying.

03:13:46.480 --> 03:13:49.480
Anyway, but there's a 60-inch TV in my future.

03:13:49.480 --> 03:13:50.480
Yes.

03:13:50.480 --> 03:13:51.480
Finally.

03:13:51.480 --> 03:13:55.480
I've been using that other TV way too long, so excited about that.

03:13:55.480 --> 03:13:57.480
Anyway, have a great night, everybody.

03:13:57.480 --> 03:14:01.480
We'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio to do it all over again.

03:14:01.480 --> 03:14:04.480

03:14:04.480 --> 03:14:06.480
Thank you for sitting down at the table with us tonight.

03:14:06.480 --> 03:14:07.480
