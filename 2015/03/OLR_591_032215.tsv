7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	This week, Team DriveClub hits another bump in the road as the studio is hit with a number of layoffs. But don't worry, DriveClub for PlayStation Plus is still coming. The game will be seeing bigger changes and we'll tell you about them along with your comments, feedback, and more right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Forage Lounge Radio
57000	64000	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, DarkSakura, and Jamie
64000	65000	Welcome back, we missed you last week.
65000	67000	Thank you. I missed you too, but I was too far away to aim.
67000	79000	Well, hopefully your aim was improving through much practice. I heard on the flight back you were able to partake in your favorite pastime, Tumblr, from 10,000 feet in the air. Is that correct?
79000	81000	Yes, it was great. And it posted fan fiction.
81000	82000	Did you?
82000	83000	For the novelty of it.
84000	86000	The Mile High FanFic Club.
86000	87000	Yeah.
87000	89000	Somewhere over Kansas.
89000	102000	I want to give a shout out to this, certainly at some point. What better time than the top of the show. When you returned, you had some mail to catch up on, right? And what was one of the boxes that apparently had to go through customs to get to your house?
102000	119000	Well, we got a package from IkumaJP, thank you, that included the Kunio-kun game that I had mentioned wanting. And lots and lots and lots and lots of Japanese snacks. Which, whatever these pear brittle things are.
119000	123000	Yeah, that pear chocolate brittle thing is so amazing.
123000	125000	I just want nothing but that for the rest of my life.
125000	127000	Right? Just dip me in a vat of it.
127000	132000	I did, though, leave the Melty Kiss at home, but I love Melty Kiss. It's one of my favorite Japanese candies.
132000	133000	That's why you left it at home. No, I'm just kidding.
133000	135000	No, I opened it and I put it aside.
135000	150000	Well, the Japanese care package from IkumaJP also contained, and I was really floored with this, a Wii Fit Trainer amiibo. Which I've bitched and complained about on the show before, how I kind of gave up on amiibo because the early amiibo was so hard to get.
150000	159000	And I kind of just wanted the Wii Fit Trainer. So when I complain about stuff like that, that doesn't mean you have to buy it for me. I was really, really surprised and touched by that.
159000	167000	And yes, the Japanese amiibo work here, so I won't have a problem training that to level 50 and maybe using it in a tournament someday. Who knows?
167000	172000	And for Loki, he got a Koopa, or Bowser as we call him.
172000	173000	Tech master Loki.
173000	175000	I'll get lots of use out of that.
175000	176000	With all your copies.
176000	179000	There's one more thing, there was a Strider postcard for Dan.
179000	180000	Oh, that's awesome.
180000	181000	Which he really, really liked.
181000	188000	That's awesome. Well, thank you IkumaJP for taking care of us. We love care packages from other countries. Like, you know, obviously we got our care package from Japan.
188000	197000	Sil has sent a care package from where she lives and not London before, and that's always great. So we love our care package. Somebody in Belgium offered to send us one, didn't they?
197000	201000	I think we got to make that happen. I met a neglected to send our address.
201000	215000	But anyway, Tech Master Loki here as he is every week. Yes, but I thought it was funny. I kind of saw the irony in you getting a Bowser amiibo because sometimes, sometimes your criticisms of Nintendo can be a little pointed.
215000	216000	I thought it was hilarious.
216000	219000	Pointed in the right direction. Yes, I understand that.
219000	225000	I thought it was a little hilarious that you would get the villain of the series.
225000	230000	I think that will be a nice decoration for your desk at work or something like that. That's great.
230000	234000	How are you doing otherwise, Tech Master Loki?
234000	237000	I'm good. I'm testing out my second level, which is extremely hard.
237000	249000	I actually, now I realize this VoG Jam game is really, it's kind of transcended the jam at this point. It's just now the project that Loki said he would do that he'll finish when he's damn good and ready type of thing.
249000	260000	But I will say, I've looked over your shoulder and this is the first time I've seen your game really in motion like that and it's impressive. I could not build something like that. I'm a little intimidated by what you've done, Loki.
260000	263000	Which is probably totally against what we were trying to accomplish with that.
263000	267000	I successfully finished the level despite the fact that the level moves around a lot.
267000	269000	You can't even beat your own creation.
269000	273000	No, I did. I just did. It took me four minutes, but I managed to do it.
273000	277000	So your game will not be for the week of heart.
278000	284000	Well, I've got to do some tweaks to it to make it a little bit easier.
284000	288000	You need a Bobby Black Wolf mode, don't forget.
288000	295000	Well, no. There will be some sort of mode like that where you can just play stuff. But no, it's supposed to be challenging.
295000	304000	But I just don't know where this is going to fit in yet. It's not necessarily going to be level two, it's just the second level I'm making. So I have to figure out where I'm going to put it among everything.
304000	309000	All right. Go into our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
309000	317000	Because we do tape our show live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network.
317000	320000	vognetwork.com, vognetwork.com.
320000	325000	And we have some comments in our chat, some pep talks for Loki in the chat room.
325000	331000	Tigerclaw saying, all these delays for Loki's vogjam game sounds ambitious. It better live up to the hype.
332000	336000	Now you know what the rest of the gaming industry goes through. This is why things are so secretive in the industry.
336000	342000	Because when you announce something years and years before it actually happens, everybody makes up this hype in their head.
342000	344000	That's why I'm worried for the last...
344000	345000	I don't know why they're hyped up about anything.
345000	347000	Like Duke Nukem Forever.
347000	348000	I haven't been hyping up anything.
348000	352000	All right. This is why I worry for The Last Guardian. But anyway, that's a whole other episode.
352000	359000	Bobby Black Wolf in chat saying, the second level I created for my game was hard for me too. I moved it to the last level.
359000	364000	Yeah, that's kind of where I'm at. I sat there for a while trying to figure out what level two would be.
364000	368000	I'm like, you know, I have to knock stuff out and they'll figure that out later on.
368000	370000	And that's really kind of the best way to go about it.
370000	374000	Because otherwise they'd be still sitting here going, hmm, what am I going to do for the second level?
374000	380000	SSG100Matt in our chat room saying, Loki uses the Blizzard development model, which means it should be great.
380000	383000	And the Blizzard development model, it's ready when it's done.
383000	384000	That's right. Soon.
385000	389000	Well, I don't want to work on this forever, so it'll be ready a lot sooner than that, hopefully.
389000	395000	Or the Square Enix Yoshi P Final Fantasy XIV trademark. Please look forward to it.
395000	397000	Please look forward to it.
397000	400000	All right, anyway. Actually, they say that in all the Nintendo Directs too, don't they?
400000	405000	No, the Nintendo Direct ones are, please understand.
405000	407000	Oh, please understand. That's right. Please understand. Yes.
407000	412000	So, every company has their own little catchphrase asking for your forgiveness.
412000	417000	Anyway, somebody who might need to be asking for forgiveness this week, getting into our kickoff topic this week.
417000	422000	No, all joking aside, a lot of people have a lot of feelings about this.
422000	426000	And we're going to talk about a movie here at the top of the show for our kickoff topic this week.
426000	432000	And, you know, movies are still important, even though this is a video gaming show.
432000	436000	Sometimes it's important to see how our video games translate into movies.
437000	440000	Obviously, we can talk about things like Mortal Kombat.
440000	443000	You know, that was a pretty decent video game movie, right?
443000	447000	Or Street Fighter, which was a pretty horrific video game movie,
447000	452000	but with some really cheesy, awesome moments, such as Raul Julia's entire performance. Rest in peace.
452000	457000	And then you get things like Wreck-It Ralph, which was, like, really awesome.
457000	460000	Tron, which was, you know, it's kind of video game.
460000	463000	Actually, Flynn's Arcade is very video game related, right? Also, awesome.
464000	467000	So, I'm starting to think only Disney should touch video game movies.
467000	472000	But this week, we got to see the first trailer for the movie Pixels,
472000	476000	which, if you haven't seen it, is out there online to watch.
476000	483000	And this is a movie starring Adam Sandler, which you can interpret that however you like.
483000	490000	And it seems, based on the trailer, the plot is that a time capsule from 1982 was sent into space,
490000	493000	and there was some various pop culture things about the 80s.
493000	495000	Well, yeah, it wasn't a time capsule. It's, like, an actual...
495000	497000	A space time capsule or something, right?
497000	498000	Probe that they sent out with...
498000	500000	Which they actually do things like that.
500000	504000	Like, there are actually probes floating out in space, Lord knows where,
504000	510000	that has, like, a picture of where Earth is located, like, on a map, and, like, pictures of humans.
510000	514000	Like, we're here. Like, if you find this, come here. We're here.
514000	518000	They actually have these types of things in space, so, I mean, it's not a completely implausible idea.
518000	525000	But anyway, so, this time capsule has video game moments in it, like Donkey Kong and Pac-Man.
525000	534000	So, apparently, the whole gist of the plot is, whatever alien race finds it, thinks we're threatening them with these creations.
534000	540000	So, they send these pixelated creations to Earth to destroy us, because we've been very bad.
540000	542000	And then the whole thing erupts into, like, a Michael Bay-looking movie.
542000	545000	I don't know, like, half Michael Bay, half Adam Sandler comedy.
545000	547000	I'm not really sure what to think.
548000	550000	Yeah, it was sensory overload a little bit for me.
550000	556000	I gotta start with Dark Sakura, because I got to watch her watching the trailer here for the first time in studio,
556000	559000	and this was actually her reaction at the end of it.
559000	560000	She goes,
560000	561000	No.
561000	562000	Click.
562000	565000	That was it. That was the only word that left.
565000	566000	No. Click.
566000	571000	Jamie, you want to elaborate on your feelings? You were not pleased with what you saw?
571000	572000	No.
573000	575000	My feelings are no.
575000	576000	All of the no.
576000	582000	The only thing that was remotely cute about that was the Pac-Man biting the dude's hand.
582000	585000	Was that really the creator of Pac-Man?
585000	586000	I think so.
586000	590000	It wouldn't surprise me if they kind of figured out how to get him involved with the movie or whatever.
590000	595000	Give somebody enough money, they'll do anything. I'd be in the movie for the right price.
595000	601000	It's just fluff for the masses.
601000	604000	Yeah. Fluff for the masses.
604000	607000	Wreck-It Ralph had a plot.
607000	610000	This movie will have a plot, Jamie.
610000	614000	It will have a plot made out of cream cheese.
614000	618000	Kind of squishy, and if you leave it out too long, it'll go bad.
618000	622000	Okay, and they're saying in chat it is not really the creator.
622000	624000	I've never seen what the guy looks like.
624000	626000	I didn't bother looking it up, because it's the first time I've seen it.
626000	632000	I mean, the premise is weak at best.
632000	637000	It's already been done, and no.
637000	646000	Maybe I'm a little bitter and jaded right now, given that I haven't been in the best mood, but no.
646000	648000	I don't know.
648000	656000	I would watch a movie made out of candy that's sitting on that table before I would watch that movie.
656000	661000	Here's my concern. My concern is obviously where I think many of your concerns are.
661000	666000	When I see Adam Sandler, and I see that guy from The King of Queens.
666000	667000	Kevin James.
667000	670000	Kevin James, which was a horrifically unfunny show. I'm sorry.
670000	673000	Hey, at least David Spade isn't in the movie yet.
673000	674000	We think.
674000	676000	Or Rob Schneider.
676000	683000	This is the problem. When I see those people, I expect a certain movie that I already know I'm probably not going to care for.
683000	688000	I will admit, back when I was 22, Adam Sandler was really funny.
688000	691000	No, don't get me wrong. Adam Sandler in his prime was pretty funny.
691000	694000	I mean, the movies were stupid, but you kind of knew what you were getting.
694000	699000	And everything up to, I think, maybe borderline Little Nicky was good.
699000	702000	He started going family.
702000	710000	When he branched out into the family movies with Big Daddy and stuff, it just started going downhill from there.
710000	714000	The only movie I've seen him in that I liked was The Wedding Singer.
714000	722000	The Wedding Singer will always be the pinnacle, the climax of his career, I think, for many of us.
722000	726000	But I even like stuff like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore.
726000	729000	I haven't seen Happy Gilmore, though. I haven't seen that one.
729000	730000	Oh, that's fantastic.
730000	733000	That one's great, because that's where he gets in the fight with Bob Barker.
733000	737000	The price is wrong, bitch. That is legendary cinema right there.
737000	740000	As far as sophomore humor goes, that's it for me.
740000	750000	But I used to have my little chat sound that I would play that was all bullshit with him singing it very loudly.
750000	751000	That was my thing.
751000	759000	Oh, interesting. SSJ100Matt says, Rob Schneider is being avoided these days because of his anti-vax comments.
759000	763000	Is that true? I had no idea that was the thing. I thought that all...
763000	765000	No, he's not being voiced.
765000	770000	I don't want to get into that controversy, but I will say I always thought that was all pegged on Jenny McCarthy.
770000	771000	I always thought that she was the...
771000	775000	No, he's been in all the different grown-ups movies and stuff that they've been doing.
775000	778000	Those have been popular, but those are also really stupid movies.
778000	782000	I haven't watched them, so to be fair, I can't really judge them, but they look dumb.
782000	786000	It doesn't look as funny as, say, the older stuff.
786000	792000	That's kind of what I compare it to. Is this going to be as funny or funnier than Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore?
792000	798000	I will say this much, and it kind of goes back to even, even Dark Soccer's succinct little summary of her feelings,
798000	804000	is that, hey, video games... I haven't even said my thought yet, and you're already laughing at me.
804000	809000	No, Claire Valera showed up in the chatroom and said, I think Rob Schneider is being avoided because he's Rob Schneider.
809000	816000	That could be right. That could be right. But anyway, love it or hate it or whatever,
816000	823000	at least you have to kind of recognize, okay, video games are embedded in our pop culture.
823000	831000	When people our age, and even folks in their 20s and teens, 30s, you look back on what were the 80s all about,
831000	835000	you think about Pac-Man and Donkey Kong and these types of video games.
835000	844000	It's really only a matter of time that video games are not a niche thing. They're really for everybody.
844000	847000	Everybody knows who Pac-Man is. Everybody knows who Donkey Kong is.
847000	852000	But here's my problem, and I only have a problem with them being in this movie and that stuff.
852000	860000	It's just, you're showing me a trailer, which is kind of like highlighting, I would say probably some good parts of the movie,
860000	866000	and you have dialogue like, Pac-Man's a bad guy? I mean, that's just fucking terrible.
866000	874000	That is just terrible writing, and that's what kind of bothers me, is that kind of nonsense.
874000	881000	I think it'll be okay. I think it'll be an okay movie. I don't think it's going to be fantastic,
881000	886000	but it's kind of along the lines of Grandma's Boy. Grandma's Boy is a little bit about game development.
886000	889000	That's right. I totally forgot about that movie.
889000	891000	It's Pixel Shit, the movie.
893000	895000	Do you think Aaron should be suing them?
895000	896000	Yes, he should sue them.
898000	901000	I should sue them for having thought of shitty pixels first.
901000	908000	I like Peter Dinklage as some crazy guy that's in there.
908000	911000	He's supposed to be the Billy Mitchell type guy.
911000	912000	I think that's fantastic.
912000	914000	If he's selling sauce, that would be great.
914000	917000	He could actually be really funny in that type of role.
917000	921000	There are little moments where I'm like, I guess I could sit through it.
921000	924000	And it's something that they like the subject.
924000	927000	It's not like they're just like, okay, we're doing it for a paycheck.
927000	933000	I mean, they probably are, but it's not like someone paid them to make this movie.
933000	936000	Yeah, like Adam Sandler probably has played a few video games in his case.
936000	941000	Yeah, so I think that they'll do the best they can, but it's just like,
941000	944000	what kind of expectations do you have for an Adam Sandler movie?
944000	946000	I mean, really, the bar is not that high.
946000	953000	It shouldn't be too hard to go into that and not be let down,
953000	955000	because it's Adam Sandler.
955000	959000	It's not going to be a brilliant movie.
959000	962000	It's just going to be kind of like, ha ha ha, that's silly.
962000	965000	Very interesting counterthought from our chat room here,
965000	968000	and I want to state this and then we'll wrap up and move on to our gaming weeks.
968000	971000	But Kaijuto in chat talking about the movie saying,
971000	973000	the movie is a big spoof on gamers.
973000	976000	It's not going to push games into the mainstream.
976000	980000	It's just going to make gamers look more losers,
980000	982000	so make gamers look more like losers.
982000	984000	Do you think that that could be a danger,
984000	988000	that it actually is making fun of games the entire time
988000	992000	and that gamers are all fat and lazy and getting high?
992000	995000	I think they did that already in Grandma's Boy.
995000	997000	I think they've already gone that route in Grandma's Boy,
997000	1000000	but this one I think is more of like maybe making fun of people
1000000	1004000	that are like 40 years old that are trying to be professional arcade game players.
1004000	1006000	What are you trying to say?
1006000	1008000	I'm saying that they're making fun of Billy Mitchell, and I think that's hilarious.
1008000	1011000	What are you trying to say? Because I'm going to be 40.
1011000	1013000	You're not a professional video game player, okay?
1013000	1015000	Not that I have a podcast.
1015000	1018000	No, you have a podcast. You're not trying to...
1018000	1025000	I don't see an arcade cabinet being used in your living room.
1025000	1028000	I have arcade machines in my house that are actually being used.
1028000	1030000	I came so close to getting that burger.
1030000	1033000	In which world records are you trying to break?
1033000	1035000	The ones in my house.
1035000	1039000	So that's what I'm saying. That's I think what's making fun of, but we'll see.
1039000	1042000	I mean, it's just a silly movie with a silly premise.
1042000	1047000	They took a short animation and they tried to throw a story to it.
1047000	1048000	All right, whatever.
1048000	1050000	YYR has just joined chat and said,
1050000	1053000	Please cease and desist use of my trademark pixel shits.
1053000	1057000	This has been Konami's legal department. Thank you very much.
1057000	1058000	Love it.
1058000	1060000	Also, one more thought from the other side,
1060000	1063000	because I kind of gave a really anti-comment there from Kajudo.
1063000	1065000	I know Tiger Claw has a more favorable opinion.
1065000	1066000	I want to read his thought here in chat.
1066000	1067000	Tiger Claw says,
1067000	1070000	Keep in mind that Pixels is directed by Chris Columbus.
1070000	1074000	He's a big-time director who's directed some of the best movies in the past couple years.
1074000	1079000	Home Alone, Harry Potter 1 and 2, Mrs. Doubtfire.
1079000	1084000	Okay, I do love me some Mrs. Doubtfire, but that was Robin Williams' credit.
1084000	1087000	But okay, Chris Columbus is an A-list director for sure.
1087000	1089000	That's a fair counterpoint.
1089000	1090000	Gremlins.
1090000	1093000	Gremlins is the best Christmas movie ever.
1093000	1095000	And if you say Die Hard, you're wrong.
1095000	1096000	Die Hard.
1096000	1098000	Actually, Gremlins 2 is better.
1098000	1102000	Because Gremlins 2 had Tony, what was his face?
1102000	1104000	That was the smart Gremlin?
1104000	1108000	I think the best Christmas movie ever is Eyes Wide Shut.
1108000	1113000	But that's, anyway, that's just for the last line in the entire movie.
1113000	1115000	Just makes the whole three hours worth it.
1115000	1116000	Anyway, low-key.
1116000	1118000	Tangent, choo-choo.
1118000	1120000	Last thought on Pixels, then we'll move on.
1120000	1121000	I'd go see it.
1121000	1123000	I mean, I don't know.
1123000	1125000	It looks entertaining.
1125000	1126000	And that's really it.
1126000	1128000	I mean, it's a popcorn movie.
1128000	1132000	I'm not expecting a cinematic masterpiece or anything like that.
1132000	1134000	There will be other movies for that.
1134000	1135000	This is what this is.
1135000	1138000	I don't understand why people are getting mad about it.
1138000	1139000	So what?
1139000	1144000	It's an Adam Sandler movie that's saying that gamers are stupid or living in the basements
1144000	1145000	and stuff like that.
1145000	1146000	Who gives a shit what Adam Sandler thinks?
1146000	1150000	Does anybody really take credit to what Adam Sandler thinks?
1150000	1155000	Do you see newscasts going, wow, Adam Sandler thinks that gamers are really lazy.
1155000	1157000	I think they're all lazy.
1157000	1158000	No one gives a fuck.
1158000	1161000	Nobody cares what Adam Sandler thinks.
1161000	1162000	But you know what?
1162000	1163000	He's entertaining.
1163000	1166000	It's just Adam Sandler sitting there with that whole split screen.
1166000	1168000	It's Adam Sandler and Nancy Grace.
1168000	1169000	These are our opinions.
1169000	1171000	It's just a movie.
1171000	1172000	Just go to be entertained.
1172000	1174000	If you don't want to see it, then don't go see it.
1174000	1176000	That's all it is.
1176000	1178000	It's not trying to send a message.
1178000	1180000	It's just fun.
1180000	1181000	That's it.
1181000	1182000	Right.
1182000	1184000	Loki, I will go see a matinee with you.
1184000	1185000	How does that sound?
1185000	1186000	We'll go see a matinee.
1186000	1188000	A matinee is definitely what that deserves.
1188000	1190000	Because I don't think it deserves a full ticket price.
1190000	1196000	Dark Sakura, could we somehow hit you over the head with a baseball bat,
1196000	1198000	push the trunk of the car and make you go?
1198000	1200000	If you feed me after, maybe.
1200000	1201000	Okay.
1201000	1202000	For food, I would do it.
1202000	1204000	I'd do it for a burrito.
1204000	1205000	Alright.
1205000	1208000	And I would never hit Dark Sakura with a baseball bat
1208000	1210000	unless it was plastic and orange.
1210000	1212000	That may have happened one time at a DDR tournament.
1212000	1213000	One time, people.
1213000	1214000	That was great.
1214000	1216000	I still have the bat.
1216000	1217000	Yes.
1217000	1219000	I'm not sure, though, if I appreciate the fact that they're driving
1219000	1222000	a lot of Mini Coopers in the movie, but you know, whatever.
1222000	1224000	SSG100Matt says it's a vlog movie date.
1224000	1227000	We haven't done a good OLR or vlog movie date in a long time,
1227000	1230000	but I think the last thing we all went and saw was Avatar
1230000	1231000	was our last movie date.
1231000	1233000	So we need to have another vlog movie date.
1233000	1234000	Really?
1234000	1235000	I think so.
1235000	1236000	I thought we saw Tron.
1236000	1237000	Did we all go see that as a group?
1237000	1238000	Maybe not.
1238000	1239000	No.
1239000	1240000	We just all saw it multiple times.
1240000	1241000	I would see it in D-Box.
1241000	1243000	You know, that actually should be a regular thing that we do,
1243000	1245000	the OLR movie review.
1245000	1246000	Yeah?
1246000	1247000	Why not?
1247000	1248000	Do one like once a month.
1248000	1249000	Yeah.
1249000	1251000	Or I don't know, see if we can invade.
1252000	1254000	Like maybe John from Critical Myth would let us crash a show
1254000	1255000	or something like, hey, what's up?
1255000	1256000	We're here.
1256000	1258000	We're going to talk about a movie because you got the movie show.
1258000	1260000	Yeah, we should do like a 15-minute podcast called
1260000	1261000	The OLR Movie Review.
1261000	1263000	Here's the thing that's really annoying.
1263000	1264000	Followed by food.
1264000	1265000	Sure, sign me up for another podcast.
1265000	1266000	What the hell?
1266000	1267000	Here's the thing that's really annoying, though,
1267000	1269000	about that movie is they have this little hidden thing
1269000	1270000	in the trailer.
1270000	1272000	I don't know if you saw, towards the very end,
1272000	1274000	it's a little flash for like some stupid game that they made
1274000	1275000	or whatever.
1275000	1276000	Oh, Lord.
1276000	1278000	It's like a fictional arcade chick.
1278000	1279000	Of course.
1279000	1280000	The game tie-in.
1280000	1282000	How could I forget the inevitable game tie-in?
1282000	1283000	So they have that going.
1283000	1285000	It's a mobile game or something that you can play.
1285000	1286000	Of course.
1286000	1287000	Of course.
1287000	1290000	I just want it to be Cortana going, you guys are stupid.
1290000	1293000	All right, on that note, let's talk about our gaming weeks
1293000	1296000	and the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1296000	1299000	We always like to start off towards the beginning of the show
1299000	1301000	talking about that because it gives you a good frame of reference
1301000	1303000	where we're coming from as gamers.
1303000	1306000	Dark Sakura, how was your gaming week or two weeks?
1306000	1307000	It wasn't.
1308000	1311000	I maybe played a couple of, actually, no,
1311000	1313000	I couldn't log into my Steam account in Alabama for some reason.
1313000	1316000	You told me about a new one on 3DS.
1316000	1317000	My Steam account?
1317000	1318000	No, no, your 3DS.
1318000	1319000	Oh, sorry.
1322000	1327000	I had a very fun dinner with our friend, Jay,
1327000	1329000	who lives in Pensacola.
1329000	1331000	He came all the way out there to see me,
1331000	1334000	and he got me a copy of Theater of Them.
1334000	1335000	Oh, awesome.
1335000	1339000	So I started it, but I really didn't have a whole lot of time to play.
1339000	1341000	My intention was to play it on the plane,
1341000	1343000	but the guy next to me was just being a butt,
1343000	1345000	so instead I played on Tumblr.
1345000	1348000	You can't play Theater of Them on the plane anyway, I've tried.
1348000	1349000	It's too loud.
1349000	1351000	Well, I have my headphones.
1351000	1353000	Even with headphones, it's really hard to hear.
1353000	1359000	So I really didn't play too much of anything
1359000	1362000	except just whatever was on my phone.
1362000	1365000	I played some Peggle on the flight.
1365000	1368000	I played some Bejeweled, because those are my two.
1368000	1372000	I need something really quick and easy to play games.
1372000	1377000	Most of the time, I actually did write work on my fan fiction a little bit,
1377000	1380000	so there was a touch of Dragon Age to it,
1380000	1384000	but honestly, I don't think I was in much of a mindset
1384000	1386000	to play much of anything and enjoy it.
1386000	1388000	Sure, fair enough.
1388000	1392000	So yeah, I really was more focused on my family.
1392000	1394000	Actually, I went to my friend Derek's house,
1394000	1399000	and his daughter Branwyn was playing Dragon Age Inquisition,
1399000	1403000	so I sort of gave her a few hints here and there.
1403000	1405000	She's like, what did I do here? I'm like, do this.
1405000	1407000	Oops, that was the wrong one.
1407000	1409000	Resume your save, do the other things,
1409000	1412000	and then we pretty much gushed about Cullen's butt the whole time.
1412000	1415000	Oh my gosh. How old is she?
1415000	1416000	Sixteen.
1416000	1421000	Okay. That's old enough to be talking about butts.
1421000	1425000	That's old enough to be talking about butts.
1425000	1428000	She's actually got a cool dad.
1428000	1431000	She's smart as a whip.
1431000	1436000	Into Homestuck, so she's one of my people.
1436000	1439000	Homestuck and Cullen's butt.
1439000	1441000	And I'm getting her started on Mass Effect.
1441000	1443000	Oh lord, help us all.
1443000	1446000	Now's the time to get started just before that announcement of,
1446000	1449000	I'm sure that's coming at E3 this year, whatever the fourth game's going to be.
1449000	1450000	Oh yes.
1450000	1452000	If that doesn't happen at E3, I'm going to be so mad. So mad.
1452000	1456000	I've also told her what my biggest problem is with Mass Effect,
1456000	1460000	that every time I start trying to romance somebody else, nope, Garrus.
1460000	1462000	So.
1462000	1467000	Alright, we'll see if she ends up Team Garrus or Team Thane,
1467000	1471000	or maybe people like me, Team Caden, so we'll see.
1471000	1474000	Or she could go for trainer.
1474000	1476000	Who knows?
1476000	1480000	Or watch Kelly be incredibly slutty.
1480000	1483000	Which is Kelly's right to be slutty if she wishes.
1483000	1485000	That's right, options, options people.
1485000	1486000	Options, alright.
1486000	1489000	Loki, what were your options for the game you played this week?
1489000	1495000	I just played Final Fantasy this week, so both Final Fantasy Type 0 HD,
1495000	1501000	and the Final Fantasy 11, or 11, 15 demo.
1501000	1506000	So Type 0 HD, I played that a little bit last night.
1506000	1509000	Definitely a very violent game.
1509000	1514000	The thing I had a little trouble with is they just kind of dump a ton of history on you,
1514000	1517000	like all in the beginning scene.
1517000	1519000	I'm like, I have no fucking clue what's going on.
1519000	1523000	Somebody that war with somebody else, I don't know who these people are,
1523000	1525000	who's dying, who's good, who's bad, whatever.
1525000	1527000	It's hard to follow.
1527000	1530000	And then the actual combat says okay.
1530000	1534000	It definitely feels like a PSP game since it was at one time,
1534000	1538000	and the way they have everything kind of broken down.
1538000	1540000	I don't know, it's kind of neat.
1540000	1545000	Also sort of like an anime vibe to it with this class.
1545000	1549000	They have a neat dynamic to them.
1549000	1552000	So I don't know, I'll try to maybe be playing through the whole thing.
1552000	1555000	See how my patience is with that.
1555000	1559000	And then, let's see, Final Fantasy 15.
1559000	1561000	That demo's pretty awesome.
1561000	1564000	I was just trying to grind a little bit in there,
1564000	1570000	and I ended up going through, and I did through the first Behemoth encounter.
1570000	1573000	And then, I don't know.
1573000	1576000	For me it was just like, ooh, things, I'm going to go kill them.
1576000	1580000	And then I would go kill them and keep doing that.
1580000	1585000	I don't know, I still couldn't quite get the whole weapon system that they have,
1585000	1588000	with picking which weapon you want to wear.
1588000	1593000	I ended up, I think, settling on having the polearm as my main weapon,
1593000	1595000	which actually, that seems to work out.
1595000	1597000	It's kind of a good balance between speed and damage.
1597000	1599000	So I stuck with that.
1599000	1605000	But it's a little kind of confusing on how to balance your weapons and everything in there.
1605000	1608000	So I tried to experiment that a little bit.
1608000	1611000	Can I read a quick comment from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com?
1611000	1612000	Bobby Blackwolf says,
1612000	1617000	I find it funny that the opening credits scene in Type-0 is blocked for streaming and recording.
1617000	1620000	My assumption was because it was the song that was playing over it.
1620000	1621000	I think it was only the song that they did that.
1621000	1623000	Yeah, it's just the length of the song while it was blocked,
1623000	1625000	so there must be some weird rights thing with it.
1625000	1630000	I wish it wouldn't show that unless I'm fucking recording, because it's kind of annoying.
1630000	1631000	Yeah, I agree.
1631000	1634000	Because I saw that, and I'm like, am I recording?
1634000	1636000	Low-hit the button by mistake?
1636000	1639000	Here's the thing. Maybe actually it doesn't show up,
1639000	1642000	because you always are recording the last 15 minutes of gameplay.
1642000	1645000	So maybe if you turn that off, which most people don't bother to do,
1645000	1647000	because, oh, okay, cool, it's saving gameplay.
1647000	1653000	So I bet if you turn that off, I bet you would not see that message anymore.
1653000	1654000	I haven't tried it.
1654000	1656000	I don't know, whatever.
1656000	1657000	Crazy talk.
1657000	1658000	It wasn't a big deal.
1658000	1662000	I was just kind of, huh, I've never seen this before, but all right.
1662000	1664000	But anyways, back to 15.
1664000	1666000	I don't know, it's okay.
1666000	1670000	It's just such a small portion of the game, and it's not finished yet.
1670000	1675000	I do think that the graphics don't seem to be that impressive to me.
1675000	1677000	Really?
1677000	1680000	It looks very PlayStation 3 to me.
1680000	1681000	I don't know.
1681000	1682000	What?
1682000	1686000	You need to get your TV fixed, because I totally disagree with you there.
1686000	1688000	I think a lot of people will, Loki.
1688000	1691000	No, I was not getting a PlayStation 3 vibe from it.
1691000	1693000	I will say the frame rate, maybe.
1693000	1697000	Because there were definitely noticeable parts where the frame rate started dipping a little bit,
1697000	1703000	and I was like, okay, again, it's early, not done, I'm not going to hold that against the game.
1703000	1705000	But I was like, okay, this game still needs work.
1705000	1709000	Maybe I'd have to go back and play a PlayStation 3 game or something.
1709000	1710000	I don't know.
1710000	1711000	But I don't know.
1711000	1712000	It was okay.
1712000	1715000	I'm definitely going to buy it when it comes out.
1715000	1720000	I still will play through the demo, because I want to go kill all of the things.
1720000	1722000	I did think it was annoying, though.
1722000	1726000	Like I was mentioning, I had an issue where I was fighting a big group of monsters.
1726000	1729000	Oh, a couple times, actually, I was fighting a big group of monsters.
1729000	1733000	There was one time it was before the first camp, and so I was fighting monsters, and it got dark.
1733000	1738000	And these monsters kept coming, and I just kept fighting them and fighting them and fighting them.
1738000	1742000	And the stupid soldiers in the ships that kept dropping down, I'd kill them,
1742000	1747000	and then I'd go back to fighting some more monsters, and then they'd fucking respawn again and drop down again,
1747000	1750000	and I'd kill them and go back to fighting some more monsters again.
1750000	1752000	And then they'd keep coming and coming.
1752000	1756000	It's like, shit, what the hell? This is kind of annoying.
1756000	1762000	I thought this was supposed to be a little bit random, but it just kept respawning in the same spot rather quickly.
1762000	1766000	So that was the only annoying thing that I saw with the combat.
1766000	1771000	I just ended up having to run away and just go into my actual campsite.
1771000	1772000	I don't know.
1772000	1773000	But yeah, that's pretty much it.
1773000	1775000	That was my week, Final Fantasy.
1775000	1782000	My week, very similar to yours, although I played a lot of my standbys, like Final Fantasy XIV and Diablo III.
1782000	1786000	We're going to get to it later in the show, but they made a big announcement with Diablo III this week,
1786000	1791000	so it motivated me, like, oh crap, I've got to finish the hardcore character I've been working on for the season.
1791000	1794000	So I've been trying to finish some of that.
1794000	1799000	But like Loki, I had a Final Fantasy week mostly, played a little bit of Type-0,
1799000	1803000	and I definitely agree the story is kind of hard to follow in the beginning,
1803000	1806000	but I also chalk that up to a lot of Final Fantasy games are hard to follow in the beginning.
1806000	1810000	I mean, like, even XIII. Like, I go back and play XIII now, it makes total sense.
1810000	1817000	But at the time, I'm like, oh my god, this game is so, like, all the, like, the LaCie and the Falcie and Cocoon and Grand Pulse,
1817000	1820000	and is, like, so much going on, right? So...
1820000	1826000	I did find it funny, though, was it in Final Fantasy XV's demo, the voice actors in it.
1826000	1832000	I'm like, isn't that fucking Titus in fucking, what's his name, you know, Oran or whatever?
1832000	1834000	Like, oh shit, it's all, it's just the whole crew's back again.
1834000	1836000	It's all back, yeah, they tend to use the same group.
1836000	1840000	And that guy is like, dude, you do not look like a guy that would have a British accent,
1840000	1842000	but okay, that's where they went with that.
1842000	1848000	Yeah. So, okay, so first Type-0, I admittedly did not get very far in Type-0,
1848000	1851000	I only really played through the first mission and a half or something like that,
1851000	1854000	but I definitely noticed the violence thing.
1854000	1859000	I was like, wow, this game really is, like, super violent compared to the other Final Fantasy games,
1859000	1861000	and I was a bit taken aback by that.
1861000	1867000	But I understand, it's a side story, it's a different thing, so I'm like, okay, it's cool.
1867000	1872000	Even if I didn't totally understand the story, I was interested enough to not want to skip the cutscenes,
1872000	1877000	and it was, you know, the characters are always very interesting to me, so I was watching that.
1877000	1884000	The gameplay, it really is hard for me to get used to, and what's really bugging me is the whole, like,
1884000	1889000	okay, so when I kill a mob, I have to, like, instantly flick the controller, hit the button,
1889000	1896000	and then hit the other button to draw the treasure out from the mob, or the, whatever it's called.
1896000	1901000	Yeah, like the MP, and then there's also, you get some type of, like, they come in the different colors,
1901000	1903000	and I forget the name, somebody in chow probably yelled out, sorry guys,
1903000	1908000	I did not spend enough time with it this week, I really shouldn't even be talking about it, but I have a big mouth.
1908000	1914000	I just thought that was really hard to control, and sometimes you can't really lock on things the right way,
1914000	1919000	and then when you turn, my god, it's, like, so fast, so you can really tell in those ways,
1919000	1925000	like, this was definitely a game made for handhelds that I'm now playing on the TV, so it does give me pause now.
1925000	1930000	I know I talk about games like Bravely Default, and I've said, like,
1930000	1933000	why can't they just make a version of Bravely Default that I can play on the TV?
1933000	1939000	I mean, is there, they don't really use 3D in Bravely Default, I would like to just sit my big butt on the couch and play Bravely Default.
1939000	1950000	Well, Type-0 shows that maybe not every mobile, or mobile on-the-go portable game needs to necessarily be on the TV without some tweaking.
1950000	1956000	But it's not, like, so bad it's unplayable or anything like that, it's just, I definitely noticed it.
1956000	1960000	So, the controls were a little bit wonky, it's taken me some getting used to,
1960000	1964000	but I'm interested enough in the game itself and the story to keep going with it.
1964000	1969000	But, like many of you, and like Loki, I took a side trip to go check out the Final Fantasy XV demo.
1969000	1977000	I, unlike Loki, and again, I think Loki is totally off on that comment, I think the game is gorgeous,
1977000	1981000	and that's one of the strongest things it has going for it, is just, it looks amazing,
1981000	1988000	and the fact that, you know, it transitions from battle to world map and all this seamlessly is really, really cool.
1988000	1996000	Certainly, XV addresses the problem that most people had with XIII, not counting XIV,
1996000	1998000	because the MMOs are kind of their own different thing, right?
1998000	2005000	In the fact that XV, the first thing you notice is, wow, this is open world, this is an open world Final Fantasy game,
2005000	2012000	this is like, like, this is like being in the Hinterlands in Dragon Age Inquisition, but it's a fucking Final Fantasy game.
2012000	2015000	Like, that's what I kind of noticed, like, right off the bat.
2015000	2021000	So I thought that was neat, kind of a different direction for the series, especially since I do play the Final Fantasy MMOs,
2021000	2026000	which do feel like that, just because MMOs in nature kind of tend to do that in our open world.
2026000	2028000	So I kind of like that.
2028000	2032000	And I was interested enough with the story and where it was going, you know, in the demo,
2032000	2036000	you're trying to track down this behemoth because you want to get the reward so you can get, you know,
2036000	2040000	pay Sydney to get your car fixed, basically, is the whole gist of the demo.
2041000	2044000	And you find all these side things while you're going through the world.
2044000	2052000	But the thing that really bothered me about the demo, like, really bothered me about the demo is the controls.
2052000	2058000	Again, like, I was never locking on the thing I wanted to be locking on.
2058000	2064000	The camera always ended up in this real awkward place where, like, the mob I'm fighting is behind a big bush,
2064000	2069000	and so all I see is just giant bush filling up my television screen.
2069000	2071000	It's like a 70s porno.
2071000	2073000	Pretty much.
2073000	2077000	So it's like, yeah, it is hard to, like, see what I'm doing and so forth.
2077000	2082000	So, and that's very jarring to not have that turn-based system anymore.
2082000	2088000	Like, and even when they went away from that and things like Final Fantasy XIII, it still felt very Final Fantasy.
2088000	2091000	So, like, this is a huge departure from that.
2091000	2093000	And that was a little weird for me to get used to it.
2093000	2100000	I'm okay with it, but the camera, the controls, and the frame rate all need a little tweaking.
2100000	2103000	This is a demo, however, and I think we all need to keep that in mind.
2103000	2107000	Very important. I'm not going to base my final decision of the game off this demo,
2107000	2112000	but it certainly shows me it needs a little more time before it's finished.
2112000	2117000	And whereas I was thinking for a while, like, oh, I can't wait to play Final Fantasy XV this holiday.
2117000	2120000	This is going to be the big holiday. Yeah, I'm going to play nothing but Final Fantasy XV over Christmas.
2120000	2125000	Now I'm thinking maybe they ought to wait until next year.
2125000	2128000	Maybe it needs to be in the oven a little longer and we'll see it next year,
2128000	2131000	and I'm totally okay with that after playing this demo.
2131000	2137000	Like, if they can go back and tweak some of these things and get it a little tighter based off some of this feedback,
2137000	2139000	I'm sure they're going to hear from other places in the demo.
2139000	2141000	I'm okay with it taking a little longer.
2141000	2146000	So, that's it, though. That was my gaming week, so very similar to what Loki did.
2147000	2151000	All right. Let's see. Go into our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
2151000	2155000	Dungeon Buster says, I kept getting hit by enemies off camera. So annoying.
2155000	2158000	There's no way to scale the camera back that I could find either.
2158000	2165000	Act Def says, Final Fantasy XV is like a 70s porno, so we finally got Final Fantasy XXX.
2165000	2169000	Maybe. Maybe a little bit. I don't know. All right.
2169000	2175000	Anyhow, housekeeping real quick. Of course, follow us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R.
2175000	2179000	We're also on Facebook and Google Plus as Orange Lounge Radio.
2179000	2185000	As we announced last week on the show, and I'll be announcing every week until it gets here, which is only in a few weeks,
2185000	2195000	we will be broadcasting live on April 11th from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Pacific time from the Sacramento IGDA event,
2195000	2204000	the Sacramento arcade event that is happening at Cafe Colonial and The Colony, which is down off Stockton.
2204000	2209000	It's the 35th. I cannot remember my directions very well, but if you live here in SAC, you know where The Colonial is.
2209000	2216000	Google it, people. Google it. We're going to be broadcasting there all day and hoping to bring you some of the speakers that will be there.
2216000	2224000	They've got some great speakers and doing some coverage of some indie games you probably have not heard about yet, but you will soon.
2224000	2229000	So we definitely want to spotlight these hardworking, deserving folks.
2229000	2236000	Also, next week here on O-L-R, we're actually going to have Gabriel Ambriano from that group.
2236000	2241000	We're going to be here next week live on the show to talk about that event, talk about what we can look forward to.
2241000	2249000	And I also know Gabriel's company just pushed a demo onto Desura today, and this is a game he's going to be putting on Wii U eventually as well.
2249000	2254000	It's a game called Crumple. So we're going to talk more about that next week when he's here.
2254000	2255000	So that's very exciting for him.
2255000	2262000	Cool. All right. I think the time has come for us to get into some news for the week. So, Loki?
2262000	2265000	Actually, may I say one thing that I had intended to before?
2265000	2266000	Sure, of course.
2266000	2270000	I wanted to thank everyone for their well wishes about my grandmother.
2270000	2277000	She would have been like, who are all these people? But she would have appreciated it too.
2277000	2281000	So I'd like to thank everyone and thanks for putting up with me.
2282000	2287000	I wasn't going to ask, but I also noticed a lot of that out there.
2287000	2296000	And even though it certainly doesn't impact me the same way it impacts you, I was just really happy and warm to see that outpouring for you.
2296000	2299000	And I was like, she deserves it. So I was very happy to see that.
2299000	2307000	Well, my grandma practically raised me, so it's like losing closer than a grandmother, pretty much.
2307000	2308000	Sure.
2308000	2312000	I have one grandmother left, my granny, and she's stubborn.
2312000	2318000	But it was a pretty crazy ride the last week and a half.
2318000	2319000	Sure.
2319000	2320000	But thanks to everybody.
2320000	2325000	We're all here for you, DarkSakura. You know that. It's one big family here at OLR.
2325000	2327000	Still not be in my house at the same time.
2327000	2328000	What's that?
2328000	2329000	Still not be in my house at the same time.
2329000	2332000	But we used to be all at your house on Sunday nights for the show.
2332000	2333000	I know.
2334000	2339000	Mystique was here last week. You missed it. And I was like, I don't think you've crashed the show since we did it at Jamie's.
2339000	2344000	And also, Midna thanks you for cleaning up after.
2344000	2346000	Well, she's welcome. Yeah.
2346000	2347000	Yeah.
2347000	2352000	All right. Anyhow. Okay. Thank you for sharing. Let's get into some gaming news. Loki.
2352000	2361000	Yeah. So there is some big announcements regarding Nintendo and it's kind of like everybody's been bugging them about, hey, when are you going to do mobile games?
2361000	2365000	Hey, when are you going to do mobile games? Well, finally they're going to do mobile games.
2365000	2373000	So they have a collaboration with DNA and basically it's going to put up mobile games.
2373000	2381000	They're going to actually create the products themselves whereas DNA is going to take care of the service side apparently.
2381000	2407000	And Satoru Iwata said, you know, we have come to the stage where we can say that we will be able to develop and operate software which in the end will not hurt the value of the Nintendo IP but rather will become an opportunity for a great number of people around the world who own smart devices but do not have interest in dedicated video game hardware to be interested in Nintendo IP and eventually become fans of our dedicated game systems.
2408000	2423000	Along with that announcement that they're going to, you know, have these mobile games, they announced that there's going to be, well, I should say teased that there's going to be a new system or game system that they're going to be creating that ties into this somehow.
2423000	2435000	They haven't really said anything about it other than, you know, it's called the, well, they're calling it right now the NX and basically it's going to be something that they'll be talking about next year.
2435000	2446000	But, I don't know. I'm not sure what it is. A lot of people are definitely, is it a tablet? Is it a new game system? Is it like a phone?
2446000	2453000	Is it all of them? Is it all those things? I think it's a new handheld system but, you know, whatever. We'll see.
2453000	2467000	So there's a lot to digest with this story I think. So first off, Nintendo is getting into mobile which I have to admit I'm surprised a little bit. I thought they would stick with that stubbornness for a little while.
2468000	2481000	I suspected the 3DS was doing pretty well. Every time a new Pokemon game comes out, people lose their shit. So it seems very weird that by going into mobile, they would almost take away from the DS a little bit.
2481000	2491000	And I understand, before y'all jump down my throat, I understand that there's different experiences, you know, there's certain types of games that will work well on mobile and certain types of things that will work well on 3DS.
2491000	2500000	You will not have something with the depth of Mario 3D Land which is an amazing game. You can't get that on a mobile device. It's just not gonna happen.
2500000	2509000	But something like Pokemon Shuffle I guess you could and I'm sure is the example many people think of as, oh, this is probably what a Nintendo mobile game is gonna look like.
2509000	2520000	So it's just interesting to me that they finally bowed to that. And I realize investor pressure has a lot to do with these types of things, especially when you're not making your projections.
2520000	2528000	And even though I don't think the Wii U is losing money anymore, Nintendo has failed to meet those investor projections several times now.
2528000	2538000	And they're on an upswing and I think that's worth this amiibo things, putting them on an upswing, but they probably have a lot of investor pressure to upswing it more to make up for some of these past few years.
2538000	2546000	And basically, why? Why not get into mobile? And maybe finally that just became a question that was too much to bear. Why not get into mobile?
2547000	2558000	You know, Microsoft and Sony have even kind of done it in their own ways. Granted, the Sony mobile platform, I believe we just talked about last week, didn't turn out so well.
2558000	2568000	But we have like a little big Planet Endless Runner game. Granted, I guess Media Molecule, that might complicate the relationship a little bit when it's not really Sony, but anyway.
2568000	2576000	But Microsoft has, it's kind of a whole other issue when you consider that Windows is a phone and it's a little bit apples to oranges.
2576000	2583000	Regardless, it's interesting to see that Nintendo is now having to bow to coming to mobile phones.
2583000	2594000	I just, there's some things I think would work very well on my iPhone or if I were an Android user on that device or tablet or what have you.
2594000	2602000	I think of things like Advance Wars. I think that's a Nintendo IP a lot of people may have forgot about, but I think that would work very well on a tablet.
2602000	2615000	I would think that would be the first thing to make. I think kind of like you see a lot of Disney characters in their own versions of popular games on the marketplace.
2615000	2622000	I don't want to say like Disney Temple Run, but I believe they did a Temple Run game with the characters from Brave, did they not? I think that was one of the things.
2622000	2631000	So perhaps you will see something like that with Mario, not saying exactly Temple Run, but existing types of ideas that you have.
2631000	2640000	But with Mario, Luigi, because that is Nintendo's real bread and butter and something that they can really give the world beyond gaming is strong characters.
2640000	2648000	I mean, I use the Disney comparison because Disney does this extremely well. They create strong characters.
2648000	2656000	I mean, think about how old of a character Snow White, Princess Aurora, and these characters are.
2656000	2657000	Aurora.
2657000	2658000	Aurora. You can never say that word.
2658000	2659000	Aurora.
2659000	2660000	Aurora.
2660000	2668000	Think about how old some of these characters are and they are still selling on clothes and cups and dolls and things like that today.
2668000	2673000	You know what I mean? Very strong characters. Just like Mario, it's going to be around forever. You know?
2673000	2681000	I just find it interesting that the whole reason they announced that NX thing is because they want people to be aware that they're still not going to give up on the console side of things.
2681000	2689000	But you would think that they would just say, but we're going to keep up with the 3DS and Wii U, not, hey, we're going to have another console coming out.
2689000	2695000	It's like, well, did you just release a console already?
2695000	2705000	All the big blogs, all the profit sites, all the gaming journalism for profit sites just saw big in their eye when Nintendo said that because now they can run that headline.
2705000	2713000	Nintendo announces they're working on their new console, the NX. Here's the thing. No shit. That is not news.
2713000	2721000	Guess what? Sony working on the PlayStation 5 right now or whatever the successor is to the PlayStation 4. Guarantee it.
2721000	2728000	Microsoft working on Xbox's successor. Guarantee it. Why? Listen to them talk about the systems that are out now.
2728000	2734000	Development for these systems start right after the old systems get released.
2734000	2740000	It's not like they let these hardware teams go for, you know, years and years and then bring them back the year before.
2740000	2748000	These things take an insane amount of planning and they go through many changes and I'm sure there's so many things they think they might want to implement.
2748000	2756000	Yeah, but why announce it now? I mean, it's way too early to be announcing that, especially when they're like, yay, we've got something coming and you'll hear about it next year.
2756000	2767000	I think it was more of a reassurance to investors and I think you kind of said it. It was to reassure everybody we're going to enter the mobile space, but we're not moving to mobile.
2767000	2776000	We're still developing these other experiences and you're going to hear about one next year, which is, you know, any of us that kind of watch the industry.
2776000	2778000	That's kind of what I think we expected.
2778000	2790000	I'm just going to be curious to see if these are any experiences I actually want to experience because it's like, you know, no offense, but mobile games a lot of times have come with the connotation of like, you know, it's kind of a cheap cash in, you know.
2790000	2803000	So I kind of want to see something that's a little bit more than just a cheap cash in, see how they're actually utilizing because, you know, once again, they take things Nintendo's pace, I guess, and they're a little behind in everything.
2803000	2809000	And so I'm kind of wondering what stuff will see them kind of repeat the mistakes of other companies.
2809000	2817000	Going to some comments over in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, SSG100Matt says it was a reassurance to the investors, not for the gamers per se.
2817000	2825000	I mean, it is a true point. They said it in an investor meeting, not at E3. So that message was for investors and just everybody else ran with it.
2826000	2833000	Tigerclaw says, I just hope Nintendo doesn't jump on the bandwagon that is those tower defense games. There's so many of them.
2833000	2834000	Excuse me.
2834000	2841000	DarkTetsuya says, exactly. Soon as the current systems start to ship, they're likely right back on the drawing board for whatever's next.
2841000	2847000	Rama says, put a couple of the minor characters in mobile games. Oh, that's a good thought.
2847000	2853000	Maybe some characters that deserve a little more love that we don't seem to ever get their games on console.
2853000	2862000	Like Tingle could have his own game on mobile or Birdo or I don't know, like kind of like, you know, the B-list Nintendo characters. Why not?
2862000	2865000	Tingle's match three jewel game. Yeah, I could see that.
2865000	2869000	Tingle's rupee extravaganza or something. Who knows? Who knows? That'd be great.
2869000	2871000	That'd be lame.
2871000	2873000	You'd play it once, Loki.
2873000	2875000	I wouldn't play it at all.
2875000	2877000	My phone wouldn't run it.
2877000	2878000	You say that now.
2878000	2880000	I do say that now because my phone wouldn't run it.
2880000	2881000	You're not going to get a new phone before then?
2881000	2882000	Probably not.
2882000	2883000	Alright.
2886000	2895000	DarkSakura, I know you're not a Wii U owner, so I know you don't really have your finger on the pulse of everything happening with Nintendo, but how do you kind of take to this news?
2895000	2903000	Is this something you're interested in seeing Nintendo explore? Is that tablet universe or do you wish they would just kind of stick with consoles?
2903000	2914000	It depends on what they put out, honestly. With knowing so little about what's coming out, I mean, if they did Dr. Mario on iOS, I'd totally be down for it.
2914000	2918000	Yoshi's Cookie would be a great, like some of the puzzlers would be great.
2918000	2919000	I'm not much of a fan of Yoshi's Cookie.
2919000	2921000	I love Yoshi's Cookie and that would be a great one with Touching Girls.
2921000	2922000	But I love Dr. Mario.
2922000	2923000	That's fair.
2924000	2935000	But I mean, I would love to have some of the classic games on there, but you have to be really careful with how they do it because some games do not translate to touchscreen at all.
2935000	2939000	Like Super Mario Brothers, not going to work on a touchscreen. Zelda, not going to work on a touchscreen.
2939000	2943000	No, not necessarily. The first Zelda game could work on touchscreen.
2943000	2944000	It would work on a touchscreen.
2944000	2945000	The first one?
2945000	2952000	No, it would work on a touchscreen because they've had touchscreen-based Zelda games for the DS and it works just fine with a touchscreen.
2952000	2953000	I'm just wondering.
2953000	2957000	I just don't think that the second one would because it's more of a platformer aspect.
2957000	2962000	But I like the idea of them being like just separate, like this is another Hyrule adventure.
2962000	2965000	Like that Phantom Hourglass was kind of like a side story, right?
2965000	2967000	So as long as they're side stories.
2967000	2973000	But then when we talk side stories in Zelda, you know somebody's got to say CDI.
2973000	2975000	Don't go down that road again.
2975000	2979000	Let's hope that is not what ends up happening because that would be very sad.
2980000	2987000	Some folks in chat saying Oramase agrees, Yoshi's cookie. Tiger Claw saying Yoshi's cookie clicker.
2989000	2991000	Now you're talking. Now you're talking.
2991000	2993000	That's more of a Wario game. I can see that.
2993000	2998000	Brad from Pod Culture, I can't believe none of us said that Animal Crossing mobile game.
2998000	2999000	Maybe.
2999000	3004000	Oh yeah, Animal Crossing in the style of Smurf Village. Oh, you're going to love it.
3004000	3006000	Dark Soccer just gasped.
3006000	3007000	Just gasped.
3007000	3012000	But I want Animal Crossing all the things now.
3012000	3014000	Hey, you want that really cool wallpaper for your house?
3014000	3017000	Look at all these Nintendo employees that just joined our chat.
3017000	3020000	Shout out all the Nintendo mobile games they want.
3020000	3026000	Alright, let's move on. Speaking of Nintendo, you know this is just one of those stories where I look at this and I go,
3026000	3029000	Nintendo, maybe you're just cutting too many corners. I don't know.
3029000	3033000	As much as I stick up for Nintendo on this show and there's a lot of things they do that I love,
3033000	3036000	this is one of those things where I go, really guys?
3036000	3043000	Nintendo has announced that Xenoblade Chronicles 3D is going to be an 8GB download,
3043000	3052000	which means it will not fit on the 4GB MicroSD card that comes with your new 3DS or your new 3DS XL.
3052000	3058000	So if you want to digitally download Xenoblade Chronicles 3D, you're going to have to get a new memory card.
3058000	3063000	So you can just pick that up when you pick up your charger, which the system also did not come with.
3063000	3067000	Now, in all fairness, because I know the Nintendo fanboys will yell at me if I don't mention it,
3067000	3075000	certainly a lot of folks out there already have a charger and probably already have a bigger card that they used on their last system.
3075000	3081000	But it does seem a little strange that they couldn't have just put out a slightly bigger card for it to come in.
3081000	3086000	You can always just go buy the damn cartridge. You don't have to digitally download the game.
3086000	3092000	But it just seems so weird to me that they couldn't think six months ahead that the very first game we're going to put out
3092000	3097000	that requires the new 3DS, people aren't going to be able to digitally download because the card's too small.
3097000	3100000	Like, is memory that expensive? I don't think it was.
3100000	3101000	No, it's absolutely not expensive.
3101000	3108000	So, it's just one of those, like, too many corners. Been cutting too many.
3109000	3110000	Anyhow.
3111000	3116000	Some other comments on the game that the port mentions.
3116000	3121000	They mention when making the port, the specs of the Wii are actually higher than the new Nintendo 3DS.
3121000	3129000	So they're saying, on top of this, implementing the 3D effect, which requires double the image processing, made it even harder.
3129000	3132000	This is all coming from the game's coordinator, Hiro Yamada.
3132000	3136000	However, we used a lot of tricks, technically, as well as in our working methods.
3136000	3142000	We achieved the 3D effect while retaining an almost equal graphical quality, except for the resolution.
3142000	3149000	Without the higher performance of the CPU on the new 3DS compared to Nintendo 3DS, we simply wouldn't have been able to port the game.
3149000	3158000	The new Nintendo 3DS also comes with the C-Stick and the ZL and ZR, which was really helpful, as we could just use the Wii Classic Controller control scheme without any changes.
3158000	3160000	Porting the game itself was difficult.
3160000	3167000	Importing the game, we had to use a lot of technical tricks to show both seamlessly without performance drops.
3167000	3175000	Dealing with the 3D effect was a difficult challenge, but something we deemed necessary to provide players with a sense of immersion with these huge landscapes.
3175000	3177000	So, there you go.
3179000	3192000	I still am not going to buy myself a new 3DS just for this game, but I feel like this is one of those games that I'll kind of pick up when it goes on sale after some other game is announced at E3 that I'm going to have to buy a new Nintendo 3DS for.
3192000	3196000	And hopefully some different colors will be announced at E3 as well. That's my hope.
3196000	3197000	I want a green one.
3197000	3198000	Yeah, right.
3198000	3200000	In our chat room, Dungeon Buster says,
3200000	3204000	Skandis and Kingston thank Nintendo for their business.
3204000	3205000	Right?
3205000	3207000	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
3207000	3218000	Well, there is a, there's a rumor going around that basically Hideo Kojima is pretty much not going to work on Metal Gear Solid 5, the Phantom Pain, anymore.
3218000	3228000	But he and Konami both issued a joint statement that says the game is still going to come out, he's still 100% involved, and he's determined to make it, quote,
3228000	3232000	the greatest game I've ever directed to date. Don't miss it, end quote.
3233000	3242000	So it should be released on Tuesday, September 1st, 2015, which is my wedding anniversary. Ten years, can you believe it?
3243000	3245000	Thank you Kojima for my present.
3245000	3248000	How appropriate that a Metal Gear game is coming out on your anniversary.
3248000	3250000	Mmm, Metal Gear.
3251000	3256000	And he's saying that this is going to be his last one again.
3257000	3260000	But he's still working on other things for Konami.
3261000	3265000	He's just not saying what exactly PTPTPTPTPTPT.
3265000	3266000	Silent Hills, yeah.
3266000	3267000	Yes.
3267000	3276000	That better be one of them, because that's where my head went when I heard all this, I was like, the hell with Metal Gear, I could care less about Metal Gear, sorry Metal Gear fans.
3276000	3279000	What the hell's going to happen to Silent Hills? I need to know this.
3279000	3287000	Well, we don't have anything about that within this article, but as far as we know, it's still on track, and so is Metal Gear Solid 5.
3288000	3294000	There were other players with Silent Hills as well. I mean, you know, Guillermo del Toro is obviously a huge part of that.
3294000	3295000	Yeah.
3295000	3300000	You know, but I just, I worry. I just hope that game didn't get derailed by this.
3300000	3301000	But maybe-
3301000	3302000	Happy thoughts, happy thoughts.
3302000	3306000	Yeah, maybe, and maybe Silent Hills is on track for a Halloween release this year. I mean-
3306000	3307000	That would be great.
3307000	3313000	We did get the demo, so I mean, it is feasible that Kojima could probably wrap up both games around the same time.
3313000	3318000	I mean, P.T., how long ago did P.T. come out? It was a while ago. It was last year, right?
3318000	3322000	I don't know. I'm just incredibly amused that I beat it the first time around.
3322000	3325000	You're right. But anyway, uh-
3325000	3329000	I wanted to smack that ugly baby in the thing.
3329000	3342000	The other weird thing about all this news coming out is, why now? Isn't this usually the type of news you wait, and then the game comes out, and then you say,
3342000	3347000	Oh, Kojima's leaving Konami after, you know, he's finally making good on his promises.
3347000	3353000	I think it's more of someone noticed that his name had been taken off of, like, some of the Konami pages.
3353000	3358000	But still, why did they make it obvious now? Did they, did they, I guess they had to? I don't know, legally?
3358000	3359000	It's weird.
3359000	3371000	I still, the game has got to be so far along at this point that I don't think the, like, the Metal Gear game you're going to get is going to be the same Kojima levels as all your, like, it's just, it's too far along at this point.
3371000	3373000	You're going to get what you get, and you're going to like it.
3373000	3378000	Exactly. Exactly. But, uh, yeah, I worry about-
3378000	3386000	You eat your peas. You eat your Phantom Pain. No dessert if you don't, no pea tea if you don't do Phantom Pain. No dessert.
3386000	3396000	And without Kojima, like, what does Konami have left? Soccer? Like, what's, I'd like to know a little bit more from Konami.
3396000	3402000	What does your, what does your five-year plan look like? Like, what, what games will you be releasing?
3402000	3404000	Pop and music and pachinko machines.
3404000	3414000	I, I, and, you know, we, we can't forget, Konami does have a huge business, huge business, that is not just games for the PlayStation, the Xbox, and the Wii.
3414000	3422000	Like, it's, there's a huge physical gambling device, you know, uh, division, and maybe that's where they're at.
3422000	3432000	I wish that they would, though, bring back the Super Konami World franchise and have all those game mashups, you know, because that's kind of the popular genre right now.
3432000	3439000	I feel like things like that don't start happening until somebody buys Konami digital entertainment.
3439000	3448000	I, I feel like if a lot of these dominoes keep falling, at some point, Konami will sell off just that digital arm.
3448000	3456000	They're gonna keep all that other casino business and all that stuff, that'll, that'll still be like Konami, but they'll sell off that branch to somebody else.
3456000	3458000	But, who knows?
3458000	3464000	You know what they need to do? What would, I think, be their salvation? Is continue the Symphony of the Night series.
3464000	3470000	We have Rondo of Blood, we do Symphony of the Night, we do something continuing on with Alucard and Richter.
3470000	3472000	Yeah, but, um,
3472000	3474000	Everyone would play it and you know that would happen.
3474000	3476000	Castlevania guy's long gone from Konami. He left.
3476000	3478000	So?
3478000	3480000	I worry.
3480000	3484000	There are people who love it. I mean, I do pay attention to developers, but not many other people do.
3484000	3493000	So all they're gonna see is, this is the third in the series for Rondo of Blood, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Castlevania, wee.
3493000	3495000	It's called Castle Wank.
3495000	3497000	Castle Wankia.
3499000	3501000	Castle Wankia, coming to a Playstation near you.
3501000	3502000	Yeah.
3502000	3504000	Moving on, Loki.
3504000	3509000	So, this is kinda lame, but apparently there's been some bullying being done by Atari.
3509000	3515000	Atari of all people, or companies, I should say. Although we are treating corporations like people nowadays.
3515000	3522000	Seriously, what have they done lately, aside from some really terrible mobile games and proposed really terrible reboots of different franchises?
3523000	3526000	But now they are bullying developers.
3526000	3537000	And Jeff Minter, who also did the remake of Tempest 2000, has a new game that he was working on called TXK.
3537000	3545000	And it was supposed to be coming out on the Playstation Vita and then later on on Playstation 4 PC and Android and also VR.
3546000	3557000	Apparently, he got a cease and desist from Atari because his game was infringing on Atari's intellectual property.
3557000	3561000	Basically saying that it's a blatant copy of the Tempest games.
3561000	3573000	And it was supposed to be kind of like a spiritual successor to Tempest, but they were basically saying that he has to remove this from the market.
3573000	3578000	And any copies have to be destroyed, deleted, and then the source code has to be delivered to Atari.
3578000	3583000	And he's just kind of, it's like, what the hell?
3583000	3590000	Because this game is not Tempest, but they're just near this point.
3590000	3600000	I don't know if you'd really be able to say that, because you can kind of copy styles and stuff, you can't really copyright gameplay.
3600000	3604000	So I don't know how they can really get across saying that it's...
3604000	3607000	They do look really similar though.
3607000	3615000	I mean, look, I understand why people are upset with Atari, because this is the game that people want to play.
3615000	3621000	Atari is not making that game. Somebody else made that game. Why can't I have that game?
3621000	3624000	Gamer entitlement, right? This is why people are upset.
3624000	3631000	But at the same time, people, come on, the game is a lot like Tempest.
3631000	3637000	Which, and I'm not saying, that doesn't make it bad, that absolutely doesn't make it bad, it actually makes it quite good.
3637000	3645000	But I kind of think, okay, Atari has a right to say, please don't copy this game.
3645000	3653000	Even if we all think Atari should be saying we would like to buy your game and publish it under Atari.
3653000	3657000	We would like to partner with you. That's, I think, the resolution a lot of us would like to see.
3657000	3662000	And maybe this weird legal bullying, if they're going to have to turn over the source code,
3662000	3666000	maybe in some sick way Atari will end up putting the game out anyway, which is kind of weird.
3666000	3676000	But, I mean, there is a part of me that does kind of go, okay, but is Atari really like this awful, evil, bad guy villain?
3676000	3680000	Because the games are kind of similar, people.
3681000	3688000	I mean, are we really going to turn a blind eye to that? I have to ask that difficult question.
3688000	3694000	Are we really going to say, oh no, these two games are completely different?
3694000	3702000	I don't know, it's just, how far do you drill it down to saying it's a clone of something?
3702000	3710000	I mean, how far do you say it? It kind of goes down to the Street Fighter type clones and stuff.
3710000	3716000	You know what I'm really reminded of is, and we spent forever talking about this on the show,
3716000	3721000	when In the Groove came out, and it was very, very similar to DDR, right?
3721000	3724000	And there was definitely two schools of thought with that.
3724000	3730000	There was one school of thought where people, it's DDR, and Konami isn't giving us new DDR,
3730000	3736000	so somebody's giving us new DDR, so I want to fucking play new DDR, even if it's got a new name, right?
3736000	3742000	And then, you know, there was other people that really enjoyed the fact that In the Groove
3742000	3747000	probably lent itself a little more to the Perfect Attack game as opposed to the Freestyle game.
3747000	3755000	It kind of pushed the Perfect Attack game to the next level, and then it had the poison arrows was the thing, right?
3755000	3760000	And then Konami ended up even actually adapting that into their games later, after all that lawsuit and everything.
3760000	3764000	But, you know, those two, despite wherever you felt about those two games,
3764000	3768000	we kind of saw what happened there, where those two games were awfully similar.
3768000	3777000	But I can also see the point of where do you draw the line of, but a dancing game anybody should be able to make.
3777000	3783000	I just think, I mean, unless gameplay is exactly the same, which I did kind of read the arguments a little bit,
3783000	3787000	and they did point out a lot of similarities between the two.
3787000	3792000	And I got to say, definitely the main ship looks awfully similar, and the game field looks pretty similar,
3792000	3800000	but I don't know how similar it's got to be before you can actually file a lawsuit against it, you know what I mean?
3800000	3803000	Especially on a game like Tempest, it looks really simple.
3803000	3808000	It's like, I don't know, has vector graphics, and it's on like, you know, kind of like a hallway type thing,
3808000	3815000	that you're shooting ships that are coming up. I don't really know where to draw the line there, I guess.
3815000	3819000	But that's not for me to care, because that's for a lawyer in the court to decide, I guess.
3819000	3822000	All right, obviously our chat room is lighting up on this,
3822000	3826000	and I do want to make sure we get some other comments out on this over at live.vognetware.com.
3826000	3834000	Dungeon Buster's saying, Atari's bound to the system that their lawyers are obligated to use to protect the IP of their clients, regardless of the fallout.
3834000	3838000	Nascent Games, I hope I said that right, says Atari is another Konami.
3838000	3842000	They are doing nothing constructive other than telling others what they can't do.
3842000	3847000	YYR over at live.vognetware.com says the debate isn't whether the games are similar to each other,
3847000	3858000	the debate is whether TXK is legal. Truthfully, TXK contains 0% of Tempest 2000's code, audio, or visuals.
3858000	3862000	And YYR says Capcom versus Data East, that is all I have to say.
3862000	3869000	Dungeon Buster's saying Magnavox did the same thing in the 80's against other companies that developed consoles, even Nintendo had to settle.
3869000	3872000	I just wish Atari had something good coming out, but they don't.
3872000	3878000	And like anything that they talk about, like was it the reboot of Asteroids that they're doing, it's like, what the hell is that?
3878000	3884000	Well, and Atari even did a Tempest game on the 360 at least, I think it was the last time I remember one,
3884000	3891000	and it was okay just because Tempest is such a solid game, but it wasn't Tempest 2000, you know what I mean?
3891000	3901000	And like, Tempest 2000 was the reason to own an Atari Jaguar, like that was the like must-have game on the Jaguar, right?
3901000	3910000	So there's a lot of people that want to re-experience that, so I mean, again, I'm not like against this game per se,
3910000	3917000	I would love to see that resolution where can't we all just get along type of thing where, you know, maybe Atari sees this,
3917000	3922000	and sees that people want it, yeah, but you're right, and it's lawyers that screw all that up on that side.
3922000	3932000	It's tough. I kind of agree with the comment that like, unfortunately, as much of dirtbags as it might make Atari look like,
3932000	3938000	I believe the way the law is, you have to try to enforce your intellectual property or you're gonna lose it.
3938000	3946000	You do, but like, I just, it's not, I think that's necessarily for like trademarks and stuff,
3946000	3951000	because I could see that they have like, they have the protector trademarks, so like if a game comes,
3951000	3961000	like if you put out a game called Tempest or something like, or Tempest Quest or, I don't know, you know, Tempest Saga,
3961000	3969000	then he would, they would need to protect their copy, or their trademark, or they will lose that trademark.
3969000	3975000	But we're not talking about a trademark here, I mean, there's, it's not called Tempest, so at this point,
3975000	3980000	I guess they're trying to say it's a, you know, infringement on their copyright.
3980000	3983000	Well, they're saying trademark as well, but I don't see it.
3983000	3990000	So now they're saying it's a copyright, well that should be easy to prove, because they didn't use any assets from Tempest,
3990000	4000000	so I don't know. I mean, come on, if we can live in a world that fucking Mighty No. 9 can come out and not be Mega Man,
4000000	4011000	then this should not be Tempest. It's easy as that. Because Mighty No. 9 is so fucking Mega Man, it's not even funny.
4011000	4017000	You know, and it's interesting, because the Capcom versus Data East thing is getting brought up a lot,
4017000	4022000	so I want to just kind of remind people what happened with that. I went to the good old wiki to refresh my memory.
4022000	4024000	Were they not bad enough dudes for come?
4024000	4032000	So, okay, so here's the deal. So, Capcom USA sued Data East over Fighter's History, which if you've never played the game,
4032000	4038000	is pretty much Street Fighter 2 for the Super Nintendo, but it, Karnov was, I remember Karnov was a character,
4038000	4043000	and so they had some, like, different characters, but it played a lot like Street Fighter 2, right?
4043000	4049000	So, Capcom felt this was an infringement on Street Fighter 2, and then they also went after Data East in Japan.
4049000	4060000	Now, Data East said that they started it with Karate Champ in 1984, and that was the originator of the fighting game genre,
4060000	4070000	and that predated the original Street Fighter three years. So, a trial date was set in 1994, noting some of the similarities and so forth.
4070000	4080000	However, ultimately, Capcom lost the case, stating that the copied elements were scenes of fare and thus excluded from copyright,
4080000	4088000	and what that means is that it's a scene that is almost obligatory for a genre of its type.
4088000	4098000	So, as an example, a spy novel will have Swiss bank accounts, a femme fatale, gadgets and devices.
4098000	4106000	There are certain things you expect will happen in these types, so it's very, very interesting how that all played out.
4107000	4109000	Loki, you want to say something?
4109000	4110000	Oh, yeah, yeah.
4110000	4112000	Please, open your mouth, please.
4112000	4120000	So, like a Peter Molyneaux game, you expect to be let down by high expectations, does that, you know, fall under that?
4120000	4122000	Jamie, do you have something more constructive?
4122000	4134000	This makes me want to write a spy novel that doesn't include the gadgets, has a femme fatale, and uses a mattress with money in it.
4136000	4138000	Don't steal my idea!
4139000	4141000	I'm gonna do Redneck Bond.
4141000	4145000	Your Swiss bank account's like a giant block of Swiss cheese that they hide money in.
4145000	4147000	My spy novel's gonna be Jimmy Bond.
4147000	4151000	You know what, all I use my Swiss bank account for is to buy ABBA albums.
4151000	4154000	That is all you need a Swiss bank account for, I'm just saying.
4154000	4156000	No, you just have people who buy you ABBA albums.
4157000	4159000	Hey, I bought that one in Seattle.
4159000	4160000	I bought you Super Trooper.
4160000	4161000	I know you did, I know you did.
4161000	4162000	Alright.
4162000	4163000	Like three years ago.
4163000	4171000	Anyhow, MXC in chat asking, where was Atari when TXK launched a year ago on the Vita?
4171000	4175000	Well, you know how fast the lawyers work, right?
4176000	4177000	Anyway.
4177000	4180000	They run off a computer system still based off the 2600.
4180000	4182000	I think we're gonna be hearing a lot more on this.
4182000	4185000	I think we're gonna get some phone calls on it later and probably some emails.
4185000	4187000	But you know what, I welcome all the perspectives.
4187000	4191000	At the end of the day, again, I just want to reiterate, like, even though I'm bringing up a counterpoint
4191000	4196000	I think people don't want to hear, I really wish these guys could just hug it out somehow, you know?
4196000	4198000	We want to play the game, let us play the game.
4198000	4202000	Yeah, I mean, I understand that lawyers have their job, and that's fine.
4202000	4209000	But at the same time, they are supposed to be doing, you know, making sure they're enforcing their trademarks.
4209000	4217000	They could also come to, like, an agreement that, like, okay, we find that this is not infringing on our trademarks, so it's okay.
4217000	4223000	Like, that's why I got to figure, you know, with some of these companies that have names or their trademark names,
4223000	4227000	like, remember Elder Scrolls and Scrolls and stuff like that?
4227000	4232000	Like, I don't think that they necessarily wanted to sue them or thought that they were infringing on a trademark,
4232000	4234000	but they had to do it in order to keep their trademarks.
4234000	4242000	So I just, once again, it comes back to needing to, you know, fix our trademark and copyright laws.
4242000	4248000	Alright, let's move on to a story about something happening in PlayStation's world.
4248000	4257000	This doesn't directly relate to games, but as you know, in this day and age, unlike when this show started almost 13 years ago,
4257000	4262000	the game devices that are in your living room are now entertainment devices.
4262000	4264000	What are you talking about? They've always been able to play CDs.
4264000	4274000	That's true. You could always drop those fat tunes from, you know, such popular 90s artists on your PlayStation.
4274000	4283000	But anyway, the PlayStation 4, Sony's going to be pushing, of course, more home entertainment things in the PlayStation,
4283000	4288000	and Sony has created Vue, which is a television streaming service.
4288000	4295000	This is officially launching this past week in New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia. Those are some pretty big markets.
4295000	4296000	It's pronounced Chicago.
4296000	4305000	Chicago. Da Bears. Vue will be offering a mixture of live and on-demand content from cable networks,
4305000	4314000	such as offerings from Discovery, who happens to own Animal Planet, TLC, which, damn, I love me some TLC.
4314000	4318000	Some trash learning channel. That is some trash learning.
4318000	4323000	And most importantly, the Oprah Winfrey Network, and I wouldn't dare say anything negative about Oprah Winfrey.
4323000	4325000	Yeah, or she'll hit some hit squad against you.
4325000	4332000	That's right. NBCUniversal, who makes the all-important Bravo Network and the Real Housewives of Sony County.
4332000	4339000	And also will be broadcasting television from NBC, CBS, and Fox. Interesting ABC's absent from that. Did you notice that?
4339000	4345000	Anyhow, PSVU will also have a virtually unlimited digital video recording device.
4345000	4349000	And so, of course, a lot of comments being made on this this week.
4349000	4356000	I love this, though, from Eric Lempel, who is part of the, he's actually the head of Sony's network's entertainment division, saying,
4356000	4361000	the point of view is to, quote, take the burden out of watching television.
4361000	4365000	Really? You guys.
4365000	4368000	Oh my god, keep my eyes open.
4368000	4373000	Where did I put the remote? This is so difficult.
4373000	4380000	I just want to watch Drag Race and go to bed. Come on.
4380000	4383000	Do you not going to say it? What? What? Come on.
4383000	4386000	America, this is why you're fat.
4386000	4393000	PlayStation TV. No, good TV. Better TV.
4393000	4395000	Anyhow, is this free?
4395000	4403000	The reason behind it is, of course, it's not free. The reason behind it is that it's streamlining the interactive elements that consumers find frustrating.
4403000	4409000	DVR management, channel guides have been reconsidered. It's not a book you have to read.
4409000	4415000	Remember back in my day, kids, the TV guide was something you bought at the supermarket.
4415000	4418000	It was something you had to open it and you had to read.
4418000	4420000	This is funny, actually.
4420000	4423000	Or you had to wait until Friday to get the one out of the newspaper.
4423000	4426000	You got a crossword puzzle every damn week.
4426000	4433000	This is funny. My son, he had to go to the bathroom the other day when we were over at his grandma's house.
4433000	4437000	He's like, if I go, will the show remember where I was at?
4437000	4441000	I'm like, no. This is TV, not Netflix. Sorry.
4441000	4445000	Because he's so used to watching Netflix at home, let me just pause it.
4446000	4449000	Anyhow, some of this is interesting.
4449000	4456000	View can also store a backlog of every episode currently airing, available on catch-up or on demand.
4456000	4466000	For example, if you want to watch every episode of The Simpsons, you will have access to all the episodes according to what networks are airing them.
4466000	4469000	Thank you, non-Hulu device.
4470000	4476000	Yes, Hulu, when you want to catch up on the last two episodes of a series or something like that.
4476000	4481000	Anyhow, some thoughts about how this is going to work.
4481000	4484000	Surely Comcast has some issues with this.
4484000	4486000	Oh god, they have issues with everything.
4486000	4489000	But now with net neutrality, there may not be a lot they can do about it.
4489000	4490000	I don't know.
4490000	4493000	I don't know, Comcast has subscriptions.
4493000	4495000	Well, they'll just make cable more expensive.
4495000	4497000	I think that's ultimately what's going to happen.
4497000	4502000	Your cable internet is just going to cost what internet and TV costs now.
4502000	4504000	They're just going to find ways to keep kicking out.
4504000	4507000	It'll be bandwidth caps and all this other stuff.
4507000	4509000	As long as there's no competition.
4509000	4511000	In other words, they're going to throw a tantrum.
4511000	4512000	Yeah, in a way.
4512000	4514000	There should be competition, ideally.
4514000	4515000	We'll see.
4515000	4516000	Have people move in.
4516000	4518000	That's a whole other slippery slope, but we'll see.
4518000	4526000	Well, if they raise my rates up to what it costs to have TV, then yeah, I won't be going with Comcast.
4526000	4528000	So there you go.
4528000	4531000	I'm trying to see what the price is of this whole thing.
4531000	4533000	Free with PlayStation Plus.
4533000	4535000	Is it free with PlayStation Plus?
4535000	4536000	I don't know, I'm hoping.
4536000	4541000	Though PlayStation Plus, Sony's subscription service for gaming, doesn't have anything to do with Vue.
4541000	4542000	Damn it.
4542000	4544000	They say it could change in the future.
4544000	4549000	Maybe Sony would tie the two services together and create a streamlined billing process.
4549000	4553000	Or maybe incentives for some type of tiered programming package.
4553000	4557000	Also, hey, you could get the PlayStation Plus show.
4557000	4560000	Powers is on Vue, y'all.
4560000	4562000	So you could check that out if you ever watch it.
4562000	4564000	Oh, here it is. Here's the price.
4564000	4566000	Seven day trial period.
4566000	4569000	And then after that, you can do one of three pricing tiers.
4569000	4570000	You ready, Loki?
4571000	4575000	For the elite tier, $70.
4575000	4578000	For the core tier, $60.
4578000	4581000	For the access tier, $50.
4581000	4582000	That's the lowest tier.
4582000	4583000	Is that per year?
4583000	4584000	50 bucks.
4584000	4585000	Monthly pricing tiers.
4585000	4587000	Fuck that. Nope. Sorry.
4587000	4589000	How much are you paying for Comcast, though? Isn't it pretty similar?
4589000	4591000	I'm not paying for Comcast TV.
4591000	4595000	So that is $70 more than I'm gonna pay.
4595000	4602000	I'm sorry. Why would I do that when I can just get Hulu and Netflix for a lot cheaper?
4602000	4605000	Sorry. No.
4605000	4608000	I can do it. I can do it.
4608000	4610000	Going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.
4610000	4614000	Okay, this comment about Oprah Winfrey was too funny for me to pass up.
4614000	4616000	Akuma JP in our chatroom says,
4616000	4619000	And you get to hit O-L-R. And you get to hit O-L-R.
4619000	4621000	Okay, I thought that was funny. It was just me.
4622000	4623000	Tigerclaw says,
4623000	4628000	My TiVo records a lot of shows. I never get around to watching them, except for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
4628000	4630000	Of course, Tigerclaw. Of course.
4630000	4636000	Do they air the old ones that I remember from the 90s? Do they still air that one?
4636000	4639000	I am pissed off at the comics right now because they just killed off someone.
4639000	4646000	They didn't really kill him off because in the next preview episode, they'll do a reboot. He's not dead.
4646000	4647000	I hope not.
4647000	4649000	They're not gonna do that.
4649000	4650000	That was fucked up.
4650000	4663000	Seriously, why would I pay them $70, or even $50, when seriously it costs less to bundle that in with Comcast, who is not cheap by any means?
4663000	4668000	Why the fuck would I pay more to do that? It makes no goddamn sense.
4668000	4671000	Well, now Bobby Blackwolf giving an interesting thought on this.
4671000	4676000	Comcast doesn't have an issue with this because NBCUniversal is involved. That's a good point.
4676000	4679000	Why would NBC be on board when Comcast now owns them?
4679000	4686000	Yeah. Sling. There you go. That's what I'm talking about right there. Sling. $19.99 a month. I can deal with that.
4686000	4690000	Oh, that comment from Nascent Games there in our chat room over at Live.VogNetwork.com.
4690000	4692000	Let's see, one other comment here from YYR.
4692000	4701000	The one thing I'm most concerned about regarding internet-based TV versus more traditional TV, buffering, net neutralities, importance increases.
4701000	4707000	That's a good counterpoint, though, from Bobby that if NBC's involved, that means Comcast knows what's about to happen here.
4707000	4711000	I don't know. I've got to be honest. I haven't really run into issues with buffering.
4711000	4722000	It's just you will notice when it's buffering a little bit that it kind of looks a little compressed, but usually it's not so bad. I don't know. I've never really run into problems.
4724000	4730000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Andrade with VogNetwork.com, use the passphrase, Snake.
4730000	4738000	Alright, let's go from the future to the past Dark Soccer and a game that's near and dear to all of our hearts, I think, right, Jamie?
4738000	4743000	Well, kinda. Final Fantasy XI, how often did we play that?
4743000	4746000	Cure, please. Raise, please.
4746000	4747000	That's why I quit.
4747000	4749000	I would still be playing it now if it was free to play.
4749000	4752000	Raise, please. Teleport, please.
4753000	4759000	Or at least just drop the monthly fee to like $5. $5 or even less than that.
4759000	4768000	Well, now it's not going to be at all because on PS2 and Xbox 360, it is going to be shut down in March of next year.
4768000	4777000	The PC version will continue on, but basically they're going to start doing the special content called Rhapsodies.
4777000	4787000	It will be a grand conclusion to the Final Fantasy series' first MMORPG, Square Enix has stated.
4787000	4793000	The Rhapsodies contents will be in three parts with the first chunk of it coming out in May this year.
4793000	4796000	Then there'll be another one in August and another one at the end of the year in November.
4796000	4799000	And a fourth one named the Bohemian Rhapsody.
4799000	4803000	I thought it would be the Behemoth Rhapsody.
4803000	4805000	Bohemiathan Rhapsody, there you go.
4806000	4814000	They are also doing a mobile version of Final Fantasy XI with Nexon Korea that will be out at some point in 2016.
4814000	4822000	So my thought is that they are shutting down the console versions to pave the way for Server Room or something, I guess.
4822000	4827000	Well, I think they're trying to switch everything off of Play Online to what the hell is it now?
4827000	4830000	Mog Station is what they have for XIV.
4830000	4834000	I think that's what they're doing, and they can't do that with PS2 at 360.
4839000	4845000	And maybe they're going to give it a nice little graphical update, which would be kind of nice, and maybe they can't do that.
4845000	4849000	Well, they can probably do that on 360, but they can't do that on PlayStation 2.
4849000	4854000	Well, and I think 360 in general is on its way out, in a way.
4855000	4857000	It's all about the one now, right?
4857000	4865000	So I was more surprised that they didn't announce some type of updated client for PlayStation 4 or some of the other systems, but I don't know.
4865000	4867000	They want everybody on XIV, though.
4867000	4879000	I guess. Well, if people are willing to pay for both, and I know people who've been willing to pay for both, I may have done it myself, do they really need to force people to move?
4879000	4883000	I think that they should just do a version of it that's free to play.
4883000	4897000	But I understand. The problem is that they don't know how to keep both around, both XIV and XI around, without making changes to XI that would take away people from XIV is the problem, I think.
4897000	4902000	Because they don't know how to do that. If you make it free to play, you may lose some players from XIV.
4902000	4909000	If you cut down the costs of it, you may lose that. I don't know how they're going to do it.
4909000	4912000	I wish there was an offline version of the game. That would be pretty nice.
4912000	4926000	That's what I was hoping they'd announce, is that, you know, we're just going to, you know, we'll have maybe these servers for people that want to pay for it, but for people that just want to experience it, we have these trusts and ways that you can kind of play the game as a single player and experience it.
4926000	4941000	I was hoping that's where they'd go with it, but no, we're going to make a mobile version of it, because everybody wants a freaking mobile game. The investors want mobile. Mobile's where it's at. Mobile, people. Mobile, mobile, mobile. You get a mobile, and you get a mobile.
4941000	4950000	I guess I can't knock it until it comes out, but I'm worried that the mobile version will be like $60 because it is a Square Enix game, and so they have their fees.
4950000	4963000	I think there are legitimate reasons to be very concerned with Square Enix and mobile. Like, they have a tendency to release games and then just not support them. And The World Ends With You, I think, is a good example.
4963000	4986000	Because I want to say The World Ends With You, and maybe somebody in chat, don't take me literally with this. I just remember reading something about it, and maybe somebody in chat can help me out. But I want to say that The World Ends With You stops working on iOS 8, and they're not going to patch it. They're not going to bother. They're done. After they charge a premium for people to play that game.
4986000	4999000	So, I think there's a lot of legitimate reasons to be concerned about Square Enix and the mobile space. Like, if they can't demonstrate that they're going to support these types of games when they're charging a premium for them, I think we have the right to be cautious with our money.
4999000	5009000	So, just throwing that out there. Somebody in chat, please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong. Over at live.vognetwork.com.
5010000	5021000	Tigerclaw in chat says, we gotta stop calling it mobile. I suppose it's tablet, but I mean, a lot of touch devices. Portable devices.
5021000	5025000	Tablets on a mobile device? I mean, can you not be mobile with them?
5025000	5033000	Yeah, see, the thing is that even if I were to call it a portable device, I still think there's a very clear distinction between a 3DS and a Vita, and then a phone.
5033000	5037000	It's considered mobile for the most part. I mean, I don't understand what the big deal is.
5037000	5050000	Alright, let's move on with some more news. Actually, we'll do some release dates. We'll travel around the world and check out what's coming out a whole lot sooner than the Final Fantasy XI mobile version. Loki, starting in the US.
5050000	5060000	Okay, so this week we've got Bloodborne coming out on Playstation 4, so that should be pretty awesome, especially if you're a fan of Dark Souls or something like that.
5061000	5080000	So look for that. And then also, Borderlands, the handsome collection on Playstation 4 and Xbox One. I may have to pick that up, because I didn't pick up the pre-sequel, and it does look pretty awesome, so let me have to do that.
5080000	5096000	They're doing a physical release for Child of Light for the Vita. And then we have Lego Ninjago Shadows of Ronin for 3DS. Is that it? Let's see. Yep, that would be it for that week.
5096000	5122000	Sorry, I had to investigate that whole world ends with you thing. And it looks like Square Enix did actually pull the game from iTunes, and they put out a support notice, and this all happened in February, saying that the service had been suspended and that they are, I guess, working to update the game, but at the current time it was no longer available for purchase from iTunes and couldn't even be re-downloaded.
5123000	5129000	So I don't know if that ever actually got fixed. Maybe somebody in our chat knows or could search iTunes real quick for that.
5130000	5144000	Anyhow, meanwhile, going over to Japan and checking out some of the releases over there. I'm not sure if there's an awful lot this week over in Japan. They usually get their games on Fridays.
5144000	5164000	Actually, I'm so wrong. There are quite a few things coming out in Japan this week on March 26th, including Bloodborne on the PlayStation 4, Kagero Muhitori no Princess in a regular and premium box, Makai Senkei Disgaea 5 comes out. That's kind of a huge deal over on the PlayStation 4. I know there's some Disgaea fans out there.
5165000	5176000	Sengoku Hime 5, Senkattatsu Hao no Kifu comes out this week, and One Piece, Kaizuko Musou 3, those are all releases on the PlayStation 4 this week, so a pretty busy week over there in Japan.
5177000	5183000	The Xbox One, not getting any of those games this week, actually. It's a lot quieter on the Xbox One this week.
5184000	5201000	On the PlayStation 3 in Japan, One Piece, Kaizuko Musou 3, Senkoku Hime 5, Senkattatsu Hao no Kifu, Pro Yaku Spirits 2015, that Muhitori no Princess game, and Sword Art Online, Lost Song on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.
5201000	5221000	On the Wii U, Susume Kinopio Taiko, an amiibo set, comes out this week. So this is Mario Party, and their version, or is this, no, this is a version of Captain Toad with a Toad amiibo that's coming out in Japan.
5221000	5229000	That's what that is. It's not Mario Party, it's Captain Toad, but like an amiibo bundle set. That's pretty cool that they're getting that, because I don't think we have that here in the States.
5231000	5240000	Also on the Japanese release schedule, looking at the handhelds real quick, on the PlayStation Vita, Kagero Muhitori no Princess is there as well.
5241000	5250000	One Piece, Kaizuko Musou 3, Pro Yaku Spirits 2015, Sword Art Online, Lost Song, Justy Cross Nasty.
5251000	5252000	There's a Sword Art Online game.
5252000	5260000	Mao Hajimemashita comes out in regular and limited edition. Yes, the name of the game is Justy Cross Nasty.
5261000	5262000	Hajimemashite?
5263000	5268000	Yeah, and I don't have screenshots from this game. I'm assuming these are the two characters. Let me look at the limited edition here real quick and see if there's screenshots.
5269000	5275000	There's just these two characters, who I'm assuming are Justy and Nasty. So, maybe it's pronounced different in Japanese.
5275000	5283000	If I have kids, I'm going to name my first one Nasty. Is it N-A-S-T-E?
5284000	5285000	It's N-A-S-T-Y.
5286000	5287000	Then that would be Nasty.
5288000	5290000	Yeah, because if it was N-A-S-T-E, I would say Nasty.
5291000	5292000	Alright, Justy Cross Nasty.
5293000	5304000	And lastly, on the 3DS this week, Lego Ninja, oops sorry, that's a US release, Kuroko no Basuke Mirai Inokizuna comes out this week.
5305000	5310000	And, I bet a lot of you will be importing, Theatrhythm Dragon Quest comes out this week on the 3DS in Japan.
5311000	5312000	Dark Sakura, how about the UK?
5312000	5314000	On the 24th, we have Grand Theft Auto 5 for PC.
5315000	5326000	And on the 26th, Iron Cast for Mac and PC, Pillars of Eternity for Mac and PC, and The Trace for iPad and iOS.
5327000	5329000	The iPhone, both iOS versions.
5329000	5348000	On the 27th, we have Borderlands The Handsome Collection for PS4, Xbox One, Oddworld New and Tasty on Xbox One, Ride on a bunch of stuff, and Tokiden Kyoku on Playstation Vita and PS4.
5349000	5355000	Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
5356000	5357000	Actually, I have one more, because I forgot the 28th.
5357000	5358000	Sorry.
5359000	5360000	Yeah, Bloodborne.
5361000	5362000	Oh, of course.
5363000	5366000	And, there's also one on the 31st, I'm just going to go ahead and mention it, is Neverwinter.
5367000	5368000	Wow.
5369000	5372000	Oh, the Neverwinter, the online one, right.
5373000	5377000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week. Loki.
5377000	5390000	So, this is disappointing. Unfortunately, there's been some layoffs at Evolution Studios, the company behind the wonderful Motorstorm franchise, and now the not-so-wonderful Drive Club.
5391000	5395000	So, yeah, they've been hit with a number of layoffs, they say.
5396000	5406000	Mentioning, I guess, that the focus of the studio will be updating the games as a service, while still trying to launch the Playstation Plus version of Drive Club.
5408000	5409000	That kind of sucks.
5410000	5412000	Are we ever going to see that stinkin' Drive Club release at this point?
5413000	5414000	I kind of don't care at this point.
5415000	5416000	I know, I think a lot of us are kind of over it.
5416000	5423000	Like, you know, I had really, it looked cool at the time, but I kind of don't want to purchase it at this point.
5424000	5430000	By the time that shit comes out, it's going to be like fuckin' $20, or like, you know, it's going to be in bargain bin at that point.
5431000	5436000	Yeah. So, maybe they shouldn't have made that promise? Do you think a lesson learned at Sony? I don't know.
5437000	5442000	Maybe they should just put it out for free as a whole game in Playstation Plus, and just wipe the slate clean of that.
5442000	5446000	Oh, you think maybe that's the direction things are going? That maybe they're just going to write it off?
5447000	5450000	When that shit comes out, it'll be like a year or two before it.
5451000	5456000	That's certainly a thought, that maybe they're just going to say, you know what, there's not going to be a separate Playstation, it's just releasing it for free.
5457000	5460000	Ooh, that would, uh, that might be quite the loss for Sony, though, who knows?
5461000	5467000	I guess at this point, though, because of all the online downtime and all that stuff, I guess, can it really get any worse?
5468000	5474000	Then again, if you open it up to all the Playstation Plus users at the same time, yes, it probably could get worse, actually, so I don't know.
5475000	5477000	Well, you're going to open it up to Playstation Plus users anyways.
5478000	5479000	Yeah, that's true.
5480000	5487000	YYR is pointing out on the counterpoint, Xbox is getting a free version of Forza next week, not just for gold members, but for everyone.
5488000	5491000	Exactly, and I want to download that, because I like Forza.
5492000	5494000	That's the Fast and Furious one, right?
5494000	5497000	Yeah, I'm down with that, seriously.
5498000	5503000	Alright, well, moving on, Bloodborne was a game that we talked all about in our releases for next week.
5504000	5512000	What if I told you you could buy Bloodborne with actual blood? Sorry, that is not the blood of your enemies, but maybe you're figuring out here.
5513000	5520000	This is actually just happening in Denmark, so unless you happen to live there, which I do not know if we have any folks from Denmark listening to the show, but if we do, hello.
5521000	5531000	And if you happen to be near the University of Copenhagen, you can donate blood for a chance of getting a free copy of Bloodborne. Sorry, it's not guaranteed.
5532000	5533000	That's lame.
5534000	5536000	Donating blood's not lame, but that's lame.
5537000	5544000	That actually isn't the first time it's been done. There were blood drives, and I used to do some SEO work, some search engine optimization.
5545000	5557000	And I remember reading in my searches that there was a tournament, I believe, in Australia where they gave blood and then had a chance to preview a game that came out, like some battle game or something.
5558000	5560000	But it's not the first time something like this has been done.
5560000	5568000	Yeah. So what happens, you're going to give blood and you roll a die to see if you've won a copy of the game or another PlayStation 4 game.
5569000	5577000	Everyone who gives blood, they get entered into a contest to win a Bloodborne-themed PlayStation 4 console. So there it is.
5578000	5588000	Also very interesting about this, just on another note, because this isn't just about the fact that they're giving this away, but Give Blood, which is the organization that's putting this together in Denmark,
5588000	5594000	they said that this blood drive is significant because male blood donors are rare in Denmark.
5595000	5606000	So they're trying to do this to get more, presumably, young males and females, let's not forget ladies play games too, but it's going to get both in there donating some blood.
5607000	5619000	There's also a reference here to when Canadians tried something on Kickstarter called Bloodsport, which was an Xbox 360 gamepad that also would collect blood when the gamepad rumbled or vibrated.
5620000	5621000	That might be a bit much.
5622000	5634000	Anyhow, there you go. So Bloodborne, if you're in Denmark, you might be able to win if you're lucky with the dice and giving blood, and maybe you didn't know that they need more male blood in Denmark.
5634000	5646000	Alright, let's take a time to visit a classic moment in gaming's past, back when machines weren't actually taking blood from you as you played video games on them.
5647000	5651000	But maybe if you gripped them a little too tight, they'd leave a bruise.
5652000	5659000	It's the Classic Game of the Week where DarkSakura is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, this is worthy of your attention as a classic title of the week.
5660000	5665000	And remember, just a reminder this week, a Classic Game of the Week must be a game that is 10 years old or more.
5666000	5668000	And this game hit 10 years old this month.
5669000	5671000	And this is going to be one of those games where you're like, I am old.
5672000	5676000	I think it's also the first one on the system that started on the system that I have done.
5677000	5680000	Well then here it is, DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?
5681000	5684000	Luminesse. Yes, Luminesse is 10 years old.
5685000	5695000	It is a puzzle video game based on light patterns and sound that was created by Tetsuya Mizuguchi and Q Entertainment, which we have brought up earlier in the show.
5696000	5699000	And it was a launch title for the PlayStation Portable.
5700000	5706000	It came out in Japan on December 12, 2004 and released in North America on March 23, 2005.
5707000	5709000	It later had a European release on September 1, 2005.
5709000	5718000	It has sold over half a million units as of October 11, 2005 in Japan.
5719000	5725000	And in Europe 180,000 since it was released in September 2005.
5726000	5730000	North America about 300,000 and that's just as of October.
5731000	5734000	That same year. It sold a lot and it sold quickly.
5734000	5740000	Basically Gameloft said that they would be bringing both Meteos and Luminesse to cell phones.
5741000	5746000	So we have Luminesse Mobile that came out on March 1, 2006, which I played a decent amount of.
5747000	5753000	It also had a PS2 port in Europe and in North America Luminesse Plus.
5754000	5761000	And on the PC it was released by, I'm sorry, it was released on the Wild Games platform and then on Steam in 2008.
5761000	5768000	In 2009 Luminesse Touch was released for iOS and it had four sequels.
5769000	5774000	Luminesse Live, Luminesse 2, Luminesse Supernova and Luminesse Electronic Symphony.
5775000	5777000	And that was the most recent as of 2012.
5778000	5780000	We had been three years without a Luminesse game. Get to it.
5781000	5787000	So with this game, one very strong memory I have is that was one of the years we did my birthday at Dave & Buster's.
5787000	5790000	And I got to level 24 piss drunk.
5791000	5797000	I was sitting at the end of the table with my cupcake in front of me, drinking a 25 ounce Guinness.
5798000	5799000	I remember this.
5800000	5801000	Playing Wendell's version of it.
5802000	5803000	And got to level 24.
5804000	5805000	Drunk.
5805000	5809000	Can I just point out, like, not only is this game 10 years old this month.
5810000	5814000	This game is 10, in North America anyway, it's actually older than, because in Japan it came out December 2014.
5814000	5820000	It is 10 years old today in the U.S. Today is Luminesse's birthday of being released in the U.S.
5821000	5822000	That's my reason for picking it.
5823000	5824000	There you go.
5825000	5829000	So basically it's a block drop, you know, we've seen stuff like this in Tetris.
5830000	5831000	It's a 2x2 square.
5832000	5836000	Or as it's also said, an O-Tetromino.
5837000	5841000	Made of four smaller block pieces that's dropped from the field.
5841000	5846000	And it can be different colors if you've got levels or skins, on your level or different skins.
5847000	5851000	The blocks make up larger blocks which will be of one or two different colors.
5852000	5854000	You can rotate them, realign them, you've got different colors in them.
5855000	5864000	But once you attach them to other blocks, they will start sharing themselves if you've got one that's going to match on one of those sides.
5864000	5875000	And then it actually, as you join pieces, and then you emerge more and more of them to a certain amount.
5876000	5878000	So in other words you have to be really fast with that.
5879000	5884000	It will make a sound that's synchronized with the music that you're listening to.
5885000	5895000	You also basically, your timeline moves across which is showing you where you are with the music and how the blocks are going.
5896000	5902000	So you have to basically get as many of them falling during one timeline sweep.
5903000	5909000	And so when the timeline ends they will match up all the colors they're touching and it will decrease to the bottom.
5910000	5911000	Of course when you hit the top of it you end.
5911000	5926000	You can also get a block with a jewel in the center which will clear as part of the overall block and anything that is horizontally or vertically adjacent to that matched block.
5927000	5929000	And it will be cleared without a score.
5930000	5937000	So you do have your different skins and your different skins work with, they have different music attached to them in some cases.
5938000	5945000	And the music and the sound effects are really integral to the game, it's a lot like Rez in that respect.
5946000	5947000	Which was another music video game.
5948000	5960000	Each skin also changes the rate at which the timeline moves in time with the music and it can make it faster or slower, make it harder to create different, you know, combos.
5961000	5965000	Or it can have you, when it slows down, it makes it a lot harder to fill those sweeps going across.
5965000	5969000	You also have your challenge and your versus CPU mode.
5970000	5976000	You can play your versus and it's just really, really an awesome game.
5977000	5983000	So you have, like I said, you've got your four modes, you have challenge, time attack, puzzle versus, and versus CPU mode.
5984000	5991000	And like I said with the playing against another person you actually do it wirelessly on your PSP.
5992000	6003000	So it is, I mean it's one of the best games that has ever been out on PSP. To me it was the reason to have one.
6006000	6016000	And of course we got more and more, you know, music and skins. I mean we were all obsessed with Shinin right when that song was in the first one.
6016000	6025000	Lumines Live, by the way, was included on the cubed compilation on Xbox 360 that included Res HD and Every Extend Extra Extreme.
6026000	6035000	And it had the Advanced Challenge Pack, the Versus CPU Pack, the Puzzle Mission Pack, Rocket Holiday Pack, and both Genki Rocket skins, Heavenly Star and Breeze.
6036000	6042000	So the only thing that wasn't included were the Booster Pack and the Tokyo Club Mix Pack, but you could buy them separately.
6043000	6053000	So, Lumines Supernova was on Playstation Network and it had all of the features of Lumines Live without the online multiplayer.
6054000	6057000	And the Sequencer for Lumines 2 and then it had a Dig Down mode.
6057000	6066000	Lumines Electronic Symphony was announced in Gamescom 2011 and it was showcased at Tokyo Game Show 2011.
6067000	6074000	And it's basically just another awesome Lumines game. So there you go, Lumines.
6075000	6077000	There it is, your classic game of the week. Happy 10th birthday, Lumines.
6078000	6086000	Although I personally feel Lumines 2 was the superior game, obviously we wouldn't be there without Lumines 1.
6087000	6093000	And like you said, some of these songs that were in Lumines 1 were unforgettable and didn't end up showing up for the sequel.
6094000	6100000	And here we are, all these years later, Dark Sakura, and that Madonna skin still hasn't come out for the 360 version of Lumines.
6101000	6109000	That one E3 will be the only time I ever got to play that Madonna song in Lumines. I guess they were going to expand with all these different songs.
6110000	6116000	It was going to be like a Jukebox and what was the song? It was Madonna's Sorry. That's what was the song.
6117000	6120000	I don't wanna do. It was that song.
6121000	6126000	Maybe Sorry was just the apology. You can play this once. Sorry, you'll never play this again.
6127000	6133000	I remember that E3. I got to play Madonna in Lumines at one time, but that'll never happen again.
6134000	6138000	Is that the same E3 that I discovered SingStar and started just singing Motorhead for fun?
6139000	6145000	I believe that would have been the Paris Hilton year. It would have been the 2006 E3, I think.
6146000	6148000	And that was the year that Wii was announced, right?
6149000	6150000	That was the Paris Hilton year.
6151000	6154000	That was when I was obsessed with singing Motorhead, because I could.
6154000	6156000	You're calling that game system what?
6159000	6160000	The Paris Hilton year?
6161000	6164000	Yeah, I remember because that's the year they announced the Wii. It's like, yes.
6165000	6169000	Because the revolution was totally not a good name for your system. Let's go with the Wii.
6170000	6171000	Yeah, no, I remember that. I remember that.
6172000	6177000	Anyhow, we're going to take a break, guys. When we come back, there is plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come.
6177000	6193000	In fact, we're going to talk about things like the Fugu Question of the Week, some interesting Steam updates, some interesting Windows 10 updates, and more importantly, your calls, your emails, you guys, when we come back with more of Orange Launch Radio right after this.
6193000	6210000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Launch Radio, live tonight with our 591st episode for this March the 22nd of 2015.
6211000	6220000	We're going to get into the forum follow-up here real quick, but we're chowing down on all these lovely Japanese goodies that AkumaJP sent us in his care package from Japan.
6220000	6227000	And DarkSakura and I were kind of talking about some of our favorites, and I think hands down that pear chocolate brittle thing is the best.
6228000	6230000	I need like 50,000 more boxes of that. I'm trying to find it.
6231000	6233000	What's your second favorite? The Pretz?
6234000	6236000	Probably one of the Melty Kiss that I forgot to bring.
6237000	6240000	Oh. Holding out on me, DarkSakura.
6241000	6242000	Melty Kiss is one of my favorite Japanese candies.
6243000	6247000	I would say, and I don't know what flavor this is, maybe if AkumaJP is still in our chat, maybe you can tell me.
6247000	6248000	The Topopole?
6249000	6251000	Yeah, the Topopole. I really like that. That's like my second favorite, I think, and I don't know what flavor that is.
6252000	6253000	Have to try the Pretz.
6254000	6255000	Try the Pretz?
6256000	6257000	In the yellow package. Try the Pretz.
6258000	6259000	Okay, I will. I will try the Pretz next. Maybe that'll be my new favorite.
6260000	6268000	But I need to get to our forum follow-up. We're going to go to our forums over at vognetwork.com where we do some follow-up topics from the show the week before.
6268000	6281000	Over on the forums, we have a couple topics this week. I wanted to start with what was a very popular issue on our show last week.
6282000	6286000	They got a lot of people talking because, you know, our show is rooted in music gaming.
6287000	6297000	So a lot of people were talking about the Bomani issue and why suddenly the cease and desists were going out to this network that was allowing the BeatMania 2DX machines and so forth to run.
6298000	6299000	So a lot of countries outside of Japan.
6300000	6304000	So Dark Tetsuya responded to a post that I made over there saying,
6305000	6309000	I did hear that on their registration site for the EMU's network that you can register an account if you live in the U.S.
6310000	6314000	Personally, I'm hoping that round one will expand even further in the coming months and years.
6315000	6321000	Or at the very least, this means that Konami will officially launch a worldwide version of the EMU's network.
6321000	6328000	I do find it odd that we've had the Japanese-Korean bootleg DDR machines in this country for the past 15 years or so and they just look the other way.
6329000	6335000	But now they take issue with it, I do really hope it has to do with them wanting to launch EMU's over on this side of the world.
6336000	6341000	And one interesting note on the streaming video as far as region locking is concerned, YouTube does do that sometimes.
6341000	6351000	Last week I talked about how region locking is really done with and you know, it's silly that we have all this region locking when the internet makes everything global.
6352000	6355000	And Dark Tetsuya reminded me, YouTube does this a lot where they block things.
6356000	6363000	I think mainly for certain music videos in other countries, but I don't think that makes your point any less valid since there's ways to get around that too.
6363000	6371000	YYR replied and said, so basically Konami's global EMU's service launched on the 19th.
6372000	6374000	It looks more or less the same as before, but with the following changes.
6375000	6378000	The site was semi-translated a little, most of the text is in Japanese.
6379000	6384000	You can now register a Konami ID in many more countries, including the USA as Dark Tetsuya mentioned.
6385000	6387000	And that's it. Other than that, no changes or announcement.
6387000	6394000	It appears that for the moment there is no change as far as the service actually being offered in more locations, but we'll see what happens in the days to come.
6395000	6398000	Rob, I really like your idea about the 30 to 50 mile radius, thank you.
6399000	6404000	I think it's pretty damn fair, but if round one is currently paying to be exclusive, I don't know that their minds can be changed.
6405000	6413000	Anyway, the site where the most current music gamers convene these days produced this, and I saw this floating around Facebook and I'm sure many of you did too.
6413000	6421000	It looks like a PowerPoint presentation, it says Konami Internal Use Only, and it's titled 2015 Strategy and Planning, and the bullet points go like this.
6422000	6426000	Fuck Hideo Kojima, fuck Metal Gear, fuck Silent Hill, fuck it, and fuck you.
6429000	6430000	Oh, you guys.
6431000	6449000	Then we had a user-started topic, thank you Flocko Jones for participating in the forums this week over at vognetwork.com, saying that listening to the classic Game of the Week segment, I couldn't help but wonder if the reason that Jones and the Fast Lane got a lot of jokes thrown its way might have been because of when it was released and where we are now in gaming.
6450000	6454000	I know a lot of those CD-ROM games can be an acquired taste, and it got me thinking about games that don't hold up.
6455000	6463000	Now, I can't judge Jones having never played it, but as far as games I used to love that don't quite hold up, the first game that came to mind is Syphon Filter.
6464000	6469000	I used to love this game and spent a lot of time attempting the stealth missions on my roommate's PlayStation 1.
6470000	6474000	I downloaded it on PlayStation 3 when it became available to play there, and I found it to be a mess.
6475000	6483000	The camera bugged me, the controls weren't great, and the voice acting and story were bad, especially compared to Metal Gear Solid, which came from about the same time period and still holds up pretty well.
6484000	6488000	So, is there an old game you love that doesn't quite hold up anymore?
6489000	6491000	I'm going to come around and ask in a moment. Let me finish up on the forums, though.
6492000	6498000	I do want to point out Bobby not happy with what happened to the discussions last week, because I know he was a big fan of Jones and the Fast Lane.
6499000	6501000	Live radio, folks, it's unpredictable.
6502000	6510000	And Bobby saying, you know, Jones does hold up and was not happy with the way the game was portrayed on the show, which is fair. It is what it is.
6510000	6527000	And, you know, I did kind of, I did want to say, though, that, you know, in part of my response, I do think there are some elements of Jones that are a little dated, because some of that puns and some of the things it does is an acquired taste.
6528000	6539000	And the fact that, and I think Flacco hit on it in his first message, it was a CD-ROM based game, and it was really a genre you didn't expect to see that CD-ROM and full motion thing in.
6540000	6543000	And I think that's what made it an easy target for jokes last week.
6544000	6552000	But I think also as part of the reason why, you know, when you kind of get acquired to that and you see that for the first time when you're 12 or you're 13 or you're a kid, you look at that and you go, oh my God, that's so cool.
6553000	6559000	And that's part of the reason why I loved it personally myself, but I ended with this disclaimer and I really do feel this way.
6560000	6568000	Any classic game we have here that's more obscure than a Final Fantasy or a Mario, go check it out. Draw your own conclusions.
6568000	6571000	Of course, try to do it legally wherever possible, just saying.
6572000	6583000	I did also give two examples on this, and two examples that I gave was Anticipation, which I also got some giggles on the show previously with the heels, but I mean, it makes sense.
6584000	6591000	But like 20 years later, I don't even have to see the drawing. If I see the dots, I know what the damn puzzle is. I don't even need to see it anymore.
6591000	6601000	So there's that. And then I didn't mean to pick on Rare, but I also thought about Pinbot, and I've talked a lot about how much I love that game on the NES, and I still do.
6602000	6607000	But if you really think about it, it was kind of like the way they did the view in that game was kind of jank.
6608000	6620000	And the fact that they really changed the table to add all these weird monsters that come out and things, it's actually not really that cool in retrospect.
6621000	6629000	That now you can download something like Pinball Arcade, you can actually get a full recreation of the actual table, and it kind of doesn't hold up in retrospect to that.
6630000	6633000	However, YYR responded to me, talking about Pinbot, saying,
6634000	6646000	Pinbot was as awesome of a pinball table recreation as possible on the NES. Since playing it as a kid, I've played the actual table and now I own the pinball arcade rendition, but I wouldn't have been as familiar with either one without the time I spent with Rare's NES version.
6647000	6653000	Knowing the rules going in really helped, and I enjoyed the real deal a lot more than I possibly would have otherwise.
6654000	6660000	I know you guys might want to answer Flaco's question, what is a game that you loved that doesn't really hold up? Dark Sakura.
6661000	6662000	Loom.
6663000	6669000	Yeah, you know what's funny? Good old games, I think, started selling a lot of those LucasArts games this week.
6670000	6671000	Steam has it as well.
6672000	6676000	Yeah, but that encouraged a discussion on Facebook, where a friend and I were talking about Loom, and he was saying,
6677000	6681000	yeah, for those two hours you play Loom, you'll have a good time. It's not a very long game.
6681000	6682000	Possibly even Phantasmagoria.
6683000	6684000	Oh, really?
6685000	6686000	Or the original Myst.
6687000	6698000	Yeah, and that's tough to hear because Phantasmagoria, my God, that game was so awesome and, you know, nothing but love for Roberta Williams, but a lot of those CD-ROM games in general, they're rough to see now.
6699000	6705000	It's dated and hard to watch, but still, I mean, it makes it no less of a fun game, but you really have to put all of that aside.
6706000	6708000	Modern sensibilities need to check at the door.
6708000	6715000	You have to look at it through the lens of 1995 when this game came out. Loki, anything come to mind for you?
6716000	6723000	I can't really think of anything, although one game that is kind of giggle-worthy, I guess, is Omega Boost. I don't know if you remember that.
6724000	6725000	I don't.
6726000	6727000	I remember Omega Boost.
6728000	6731000	It's got music that doesn't really fit the game, but it's pretty awesome.
6732000	6744000	It's just, you know, that might not hold up now. I can't really think of a lot of stuff because, you know, a lot of games I played were just, like, classic games on, like, the NES and stuff that still, I think, hold up pretty well.
6745000	6748000	Maybe Mega Race, that game. Well, that's like a first-generation CD-ROM game.
6749000	6753000	Oh, that's a great CD-ROM example. Mega Race. I think that would be really hard to play today.
6754000	6757000	Oh, yeah, if you could even get the run. It's just, like, very...
6758000	6759000	That's a good one. That's a really good one.
6759000	6761000	That'd be worth remaking, I think, but, yeah.
6762000	6777000	Awesome. Alright, some good choices. It's interesting that a lot of these choices are all that CD-ROM game era that I think, you know, and again, back to Flacco's original point, I think just games from that era, when you have today's technology, are kind of rough to watch.
6778000	6779000	So what about, uh...
6780000	6786000	What about SimCity? SimCity Action News is the best version of that game they ever made. It was, uh, you guys, it's a hurricane.
6786000	6796000	Oh, man. Has somebody... Surely there's, like, a Kickstarter out there where somebody's trying to make, like, an old-school CD-ROM game. Just like you remember.
6797000	6805000	Um, no, not necessarily that, but that studio that did, um, Roundabout and stuff like that, they tried to do, like, the full-motion video type stuff that's cheesy like that.
6806000	6811000	So, um, they did that with, um, Gun Stringer and then, um, with Roundabout, so...
6812000	6813000	That's right, that's right, I remember that.
6814000	6820000	Uh, Hitstun pointing out that the Good Old Games version of Mega Race is actually really nice as far as full-motion video games go.
6821000	6822000	Ooh, maybe you have to pick that up.
6823000	6824000	I did not realize Good Old Games had it. That's awesome.
6825000	6826000	I may have to pick that up, yeah.
6827000	6836000	You know, I don't like to make flat-out endorsements like this when I'm not being paid for it, but I just have to say, as somebody who does love the classic games, especially on the PC,
6836000	6844000	I really gotta tip my hat for Good Old Games, because I feel like it's a real niche thing that they're providing, but I wish more people would check it out, because there's so many...
6845000	6852000	I wish they had more on it, too. You know, I realize some people are really holding out with some of the licenses and things, but there's a lot of good stuff on there. A lot of good stuff on there.
6853000	6858000	All right, anyhow, let's do some rapid-fire news and quickly address some other news stories that have come up this week.
6859000	6860000	Rapid-fire, low-key.
6860000	6871000	Well, there's lots of games that are being redone or made to look nicer for the new generation consoles, starting off with an announcement for God of War 3 being remastered.
6872000	6879000	It's going to be coming out July 14th, and it's going to feature 1080p gameplay, and they're targeting 60 frames per second.
6880000	6887000	Not much more is really known about that, other than it will look slightly better than the PlayStation 3 version, so hooray.
6887000	6893000	Then, also, to kind of go along with that, Gravity Rush is coming to PlayStation 4 as well.
6894000	6903000	They're going to be remastering that game, which was originally on the Vita, and so that'll be coming to PlayStation 4 sometime in the near future.
6904000	6911000	And then, last but not least, Codemasters is teasing a new Overlord game, which I kind of was a fan of the Overlord games.
6911000	6915000	Never really got around to playing through number two, but number one is pretty awesome.
6916000	6919000	It's one of those games where you play the villain, which is kind of nice.
6920000	6931000	So, they tweeted a picture of the Overlord helmet, so maybe that'll be an announcement at E3.
6932000	6936000	Alright, it's going to be an exciting E3 this year, we'll see.
6936000	6943000	I mentioned earlier in the show during my gaming week that I was stepping it up on Diablo 3 with my hardcore character, because I had to finish it.
6944000	6948000	Because it was announced this week that season two in Diablo 3 will be ending soon.
6949000	6953000	Season will be ending the first week of April, I believe.
6954000	6959000	I thought I had the exact date here, but it is not here. Maybe somebody in chat will shout it out.
6960000	6961000	It's not on the page I'm looking at.
6961000	6968000	Oh no, here it is. Season two ends Sunday, April 5th at 9pm. So that is the season two end date in North America.
6969000	6974000	Very interesting, because this season went by a lot faster than season one did.
6975000	6979000	Season one lasted a good four or five months. Season two, this means it lasted about two months.
6980000	6985000	So I think Blizzard's trying to find that balance on, do people like the fast seasons, or do people like the slow seasons?
6985000	6992000	Or if judging from a lot of gamers out on Twitter are accurate, people aren't happy either way, no matter what you do.
6993000	6994000	That sounds more like it.
6995000	6997000	I like the fast seasons personally. I think that's the way to go.
6998000	7001000	Because the fast season means we're getting a patch really soon, and I think that's a good thing.
7002000	7003000	So I say more fast seasons.
7004000	7008000	Microsoft denying that a Gears of War collection is happening.
7009000	7012000	Sorry, I know on the heels of the Halo collection a lot of you are hoping for a Gears of War collection.
7012000	7016000	But Black Tusk Studios manager Rod Ferguson says on Twitter, quote,
7017000	7023000	I love the passion, but there's no Marcus Fenix collection. We are working on other exciting Gears projects.
7024000	7025000	I'll see you at E3.
7026000	7029000	And then he slapped in the entirety of Twitter with a two by four to the face.
7030000	7035000	Because, I mean, doesn't that kind of scream that they're going to announce something Gears related at E3?
7036000	7037000	So, anyhow, there you go.
7037000	7041000	Gears of War, of course, went to development at Black Tusk for Xbox One.
7042000	7047000	As you know, Cliffy B is doing new stuff now. What is this new studio? Blue something something?
7048000	7049000	I don't know what it's called.
7050000	7051000	Anyhow.
7052000	7058000	He's got that sketch combat game that looks like a bunch of pencil sketches.
7059000	7060000	Yes, yes.
7060000	7068000	You know what? This is not the popular opinion I totally realized, but I did not think Halo 4 was bad at all.
7069000	7074000	In fact, I thought Halo 4 was probably much better than Halo 3 or any of the variety of spinoffs that came out after it.
7075000	7077000	And that was when it was in new studio's hands.
7078000	7083000	So, you know what? Sometimes that fresh blood can kind of invigorate an old IP.
7084000	7087000	Which, not to get too in depth, because I probably should have mentioned this earlier,
7087000	7094000	but when Jamie was talking about Hideo Kojima and leaving Metal Gear and kind of talked about the Castlevania thing
7095000	7097000	and can they do a new Castlevania without Itagaki, well, why not?
7098000	7105000	They did a Halo without Bungie, and even though not everybody was a fan, I thought it was a pretty solid Halo game.
7106000	7107000	So, we'll see. Anyway.
7107000	7113000	And nassengames in chat at live.vognetwork.com agrees with me.
7114000	7119000	Halo 4 was the one Halo game I beat multiple times. I genuinely enjoyed that game.
7120000	7127000	Anyhow, the ZX Spectrum. What a throwback, right? Back to the 80's computer days, the ZX Spectrum.
7128000	7134000	Well, you can also throwback to this. There is a new ZX Spectrum keyboard that has come out.
7134000	7141000	It's the recreated Sinclair ZX Spectrum. It's a keyboard for tablets. So that's kind of neat.
7142000	7143000	It's kind of weird.
7144000	7148000	Yeah, well, it's kind of neat though. All it is, it's a Bluetooth keyboard and you can actually put it with a tablet.
7149000	7157000	And so I guess you can actually get this Sinclair app for your iPad or whatever, and then you can actually hook it up with this keyboard.
7158000	7162000	And it's just like having the old stinkin' Sinclair, which is pretty cool. So, you know, if you were a fan of that.
7162000	7168000	I wonder then if that would work to project it to an Apple TV so that you can play it on the big screen.
7169000	7174000	You know what, and they show in this somebody playing Spectrum on the TV, so I bet you that's exactly what they're doing. That's a very good thought.
7175000	7178000	If you've got an Apple TV, you can play your iOS games.
7179000	7188000	Yeah, and they just have that price reduction. Although, I'm crossing my fingers and my toes. There's rumors that there'll be a new one soon, so I'm gonna see what happens. We'll see.
7188000	7191000	Alright, Dark Soccer, you have some other rapid-fire news for us.
7192000	7200000	I do. Squeenix, the president, Yosuke Matsuda, said that there is going to be a box of surprises for 2015.
7201000	7206000	They have a considerable amount of high-end games. That's a quote from both inside and outside the country.
7207000	7211000	And this was for a Nikkei interview, so he was referring to Japan, of course.
7211000	7216000	We've got Final Fantasy XV is the start of it, but then this is a quote.
7217000	7224000	I think we'll have a little surprise too, a JRPG for home game machines. So, who knows?
7225000	7231000	Next up, PlayStation Now has a closed beta that starts this spring in the UK.
7232000	7237000	Plus, members are going to be among the first to use it, but they will have to register to get in on the beta.
7237000	7242000	And I found a typo on the article. That was professional.
7243000	7253000	It will be available on PS4 only, and PS Now is going to initially be free, but the later stages are going to have trial rental periods and pricing models to go out.
7254000	7265000	Games included in the closed beta are Dirt 3, Far Cry 3, Blood Dragon, God of War Ascension, Just Cause 2, Rayman Legends, Saints Row the Third, The Full Package, The Last of Us, The Walking Dead, and Uncharted 2 Among Thieves.
7265000	7279000	And then, and this is really cool, there is a machine out called Smash-A-Ball, and it's meant to improve the memory and spatial awareness for blind kids.
7280000	7289000	Basically, they have audio clues and different type of tactile stimuli that let them choose the right one.
7290000	7294000	It's sort of like, for lack of a better description, blind whack-a-mole.
7295000	7306000	The team that's developing it is trying to raise £100,000 or $148,000 on Kickstarter so that it can go into production.
7307000	7312000	And if you pledge at least £180 or $267, you can get one of your own.
7313000	7320000	But, you know, you can also contribute £50 and get other friends to do the same.
7320000	7331000	And then, for everyone who pledges £50, the team will give a set to a blind child who needs it.
7332000	7344000	So, I would say definitely hop on Kickstarter and search for this device. It's called Smash-A-Ball.
7345000	7358000	And right now, their US goal, like I said, about $150,383, they've hit $17,000 of it right now. 25 backers, 16 days to go.
7359000	7362000	That's awesome. I'm glad we could bring a little light to that subject.
7363000	7365000	The video for it is pretty cool.
7366000	7369000	Alright. Let's get to the FUGL question of the week, you guys.
7370000	7373000	Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities.
7374000	7378000	Yes, Google Plus is still there. For now, I guess I heard Google Plus is going to change.
7379000	7381000	Now it's like Google Streams or something because, you know, I don't know.
7382000	7385000	But anyway, for now, I'm still calling it Google Plus until a different name shows up.
7386000	7388000	But you get the FUGL question of the week.
7396000	7403000	Thank God I didn't call it like the fluss segment of the week or I would have had to change the name, but Google should still work, right?
7404000	7405000	The fellow.
7406000	7413000	Alright, this week, very simple question of the week. It's similar to our kickoff topic tonight because all I did is I said,
7414000	7416000	I'm going to just leave this right here and ask for your thoughts.
7417000	7420000	And I posted the trailer for the Pixels movie that we talked about at the top of the show.
7420000	7424000	So I just want to know your thoughts, folks, on the Pixels trailer we saw at the top of the show.
7425000	7427000	So over on Facebook, Surping Slurpee says,
7428000	7432000	The movie seems like shameless pandering to gamers just like Chuck and Larry was pandering to the gay community.
7433000	7436000	And let's face it, Adam Sandler hasn't made a decent movie in 10 years.
7437000	7438000	Gonna wait till it's at Red Box.
7439000	7440000	It's pretty harsh.
7441000	7448000	I totally forgot that the Chuck and Larry thing was a thing because I remember seeing that trailer and my eyes rolled back so far I could see my fucking brain.
7448000	7449000	Just saying.
7450000	7451000	Red the Haze says,
7452000	7454000	Looks interesting and would watch it but not pay any money for it.
7455000	7457000	Yo ho yo ho.
7458000	7460000	Fifth Dream says,
7461000	7465000	I saw the trailer on TV the other night. At first I was kind of intrigued. Wonder what this could possibly be.
7466000	7469000	Then I saw Adam Sandler and realized it would be a total piece of crap.
7470000	7475000	I won't even bother watching it unless someone else pays for a rental and then it would just be to see if I'm right about how dumb it really is.
7475000	7476000	Andy R says,
7477000	7482000	Looks kind of dumb and pandering but I might see it anyway just to get some of that sweet cinema popcorn.
7483000	7484000	That's a great reason.
7485000	7486000	Critical Myth says,
7487000	7490000	It would make a fine sketch or short but how are they going to sustain this for an entire film?
7491000	7492000	Cial says,
7493000	7494000	I'll keep my expectations low and wait for it to come on TV.
7495000	7496000	Tiger Claw says,
7497000	7501000	I think it looks like it could be a fun movie. I love the idea of aliens using video games as weapons of mass destruction.
7501000	7507000	Something we all take for granted because in video games you never worry about the repercussions because it's never real.
7508000	7510000	Only this time the video games become real and are out to kill us all.
7511000	7514000	So I see a bit of irony in this. The things we took for granted could be our end.
7515000	7520000	This film combines one of my favorite genres, the alien invasion, but with video games instead of spaceships.
7521000	7523000	And Bryce H. I think sums it all up saying,
7524000	7527000	It looks like a great movie. Just wish it wasn't Adam Sandler.
7528000	7533000	Let's go to Google Plus, however, and check out some of the answers there. We actually had a few answers over there.
7534000	7535000	Dustin B. says,
7536000	7538000	I'll watch it. It looks awesome. I grew up on these games and I'm glad when they get the movie treatment.
7539000	7542000	I went to see Wreck-It Ralph after all even though I didn't have much interest in the show otherwise.
7543000	7546000	I don't get people calling this a train wreck before they even have a chance to see it.
7547000	7548000	Ruttertainment says,
7549000	7552000	It's a movie produced by Happy Madison Productions so my dad is going to love this.
7553000	7554000	My dad has really bad taste.
7555000	7556000	Facepalm.
7557000	7560000	Adam Sandler movies, or at least some of his earlier work, but this movie is total utter crap.
7561000	7563000	They meet a Futurama seven minute short into a full length movie.
7564000	7565000	It's going to suck no matter what.
7566000	7568000	I'd rather watch Wreck-It Ralph than this train wreck of a movie.
7569000	7572000	And the Toro Iwatani nod is just plain fucking stupid and not funny.
7573000	7575000	Ooh, some harsh language from Act Deaf. I'm going to put some soap in your mouth.
7576000	7578000	Josh Y. replied and said,
7579000	7582000	For a big dumb summer movie, I'd probably watch it, subject to reviews.
7583000	7584000	Seems rather heavy on fan service though.
7585000	7586000	And lastly, CyberJudge says,
7587000	7590000	Some of his movies I enjoyed, others I was not so impressed.
7591000	7594000	That being said, a movie that has video games in it will at least get me to rent the movie.
7595000	7597000	If reviews come out strong, I may go to the theater to watch it.
7598000	7602000	Thank you to our Google Plus and Facebook communities for answering our question this week.
7603000	7604000	Appreciate it.
7605000	7608000	We already shared our thoughts earlier in the show, so we're a little behind on time.
7609000	7611000	I want to make sure we have time to get in your calls, so we'll get back into the news.
7612000	7613000	So, Loki, let's do some news.
7614000	7615000	Alright, sounds good.
7615000	7620000	So, yeah, they finally, well it didn't take that long because they just announced the first character last week.
7621000	7629000	But they announced all four characters that will be a part of the combat pack that's available for Mortal Kombat X.
7630000	7635000	And the pack will run you thirty dollars for four characters.
7636000	7640000	Thirty, really, thirty fucking dollars for four characters.
7641000	7644000	Okay, and that's basically the season pass.
7645000	7647000	Well aren't they, they're throwing in some skins as well.
7648000	7652000	Whoo! Skins! Oh, mime is sick. That's totally worth it then.
7653000	7658000	Okay, anyways, so they already announced Jason Vorhees as a playable character last week.
7659000	7661000	Also, Tanya, Tremor.
7662000	7663000	I love Tanya in four.
7663000	7670000	Yeah, Tremor, and then the new character that everyone's getting their panties in a bunch about, the Predator.
7671000	7674000	Okay, that's kind of cool though. I mean, I can't hate on that.
7675000	7683000	Is that, do you think maybe that's why this is so expensive, is because maybe it cost them an arm and a leg, literally, ha, Mortal Kombat, get it?
7684000	7687000	To license Jason and Predator for this, so maybe this is how they recoup that money?
7688000	7693000	This is about what they charge for season passes, twenty or thirty dollars, and so, I don't know.
7694000	7701000	Dark Sakura, curious on your thoughts on being able to play as the Predator in Mortal Kombat X. Any interest at all?
7702000	7703000	Only interesting if we get the alien.
7704000	7711000	There, like in a later pack, we'll get the alien. I wish they'd bring back Freddy Krueger too, like, they could all throw down.
7712000	7717000	Here's my thing, it's like, if you don't give a shit about certain characters and that, just don't buy the season pass and buy them a la carte.
7718000	7727000	But, at the same time, it's really expensive for each individual character. You gotta imagine that, you know, that's at least, it's not gonna be an even thirty dollars for that.
7728000	7732000	It's not gonna be seven fifty per download, it's gonna be maybe a little bit more than that, like ten dollars or something.
7733000	7739000	That's ridiculous for a single character. And, ooh, and skins. Oh, my mistake. I forgot about the skins.
7740000	7745000	Kaijuto says, Jason and no Freddy? Predator and no alien? Lame shit.
7746000	7750000	Fifth Dream says, is Jason gonna walk really slow? Cause that won't fit in, and if he doesn't, he's wrong.
7753000	7758000	Let's see, ActDeft agrees, licenses cost money, and Predator too.
7759000	7761000	Bonds006 says, Fox Entertainment need that money.
7762000	7770000	I can't imagine licenses don't play into it somehow, but you are right in that, okay, they're charging the same for Jason that they would for Tanya.
7771000	7778000	And, you know, Tanya isn't gonna cost a bunch in licensing, cause that's their character. So, it is a little bit, hmm, I don't know.
7779000	7784000	And that's the character, I want Tanya most of all, I'm telling you, that's the character I played, like, all the time.
7785000	7787000	I loved her fatality where she jumped up on the guy's head and then went.
7788000	7790000	I just, I don't care.
7791000	7802000	Yeah, and I just will say, my concerns about Mortal Kombat X, again, like, I'm all for, like, cartoony violence, and I thought the old Mortal Kombat games were so over the top and stupid and great.
7803000	7810000	But, like, as the graphics get better, I actually get a little more squeamish at some of the stuff I've seen coming out of the Mortal Kombat games.
7810000	7819000	And I'm like, is this, is this now going, cause I've told you guys before, I do not like the Saw movies and things that are just, like, the gore fest, like, I'm not here for that.
7820000	7833000	So, I'm getting a little worried that Mortal Kombat might become a little too much. However, I do still feel my duty to the internet to buy Mortal Kombat X and make my mother play it and get her reaction.
7833000	7843000	That is, I do feel like that is my destiny and what needs to happen. So, for you, internet, I will. For you, I will.
7844000	7846000	The sacrifices you make.
7847000	7848000	That's right, the sacrifices I make.
7849000	7875000	Moving on. Talking about an update on Steam. A subscriber agreement went out for Steam. Now, if you are a user of Steam, as more and more, I guess, promotional opportunities and broadcast opportunities come up on Steam, such as the Curators List and Steam Broadcasting come up, there's opportunities that users might be getting paid to give favorable mentions to companies.
7875000	7884000	So, as part of the Steam subscriber agreement that you're now agreeing to, you will need to disclose if you're being paid to promote a product on the service.
7885000	7891000	This means if there's been a monetary exchange, this also means a free game key or physical goods.
7892000	7909000	Quote, if you use Steam services, like this Curators List or the Broadcasting Service, to promote or endorse a product, service, or event in return for any kind of consideration from a third party, including non-monetary rewards like free games, you must clearly indicate the source of such consideration to your audience.
7910000	7916000	You can find this in Section 6, Paragraph C of the new Steam subscriber agreement. So, I keep in everything.
7917000	7918000	Nice. I like that.
7918000	7930000	It's one of those things where I'm like, you should be doing it anyway, Steam shouldn't have to tell you to do it, but I understand the need. Now, my question is, how do you enforce it?
7931000	7936000	The users will enforce it. They catch somebody, they'll point it out.
7937000	7942000	We'll see. We'll see. So, there you go. Moving on, DarkSakura.
7943000	7953000	Well, this is actually pretty cool. Bungie is putting in a colorblind mode in Destiny's next update. It's the 1.1.2 update.
7954000	7960000	And so, it will also add the ability to play your own music, adjust your teammate's chat volume, or mute the soundtrack.
7961000	7966000	But the colorblind mode is letting other players see the game better.
7966000	7972000	You know, the community manager is like, we don't all see the world the same way to provide a better solution. We increase the contrast between colors.
7973000	7980000	We do have it in the perceived palette. So, basically, they're just really working on making it to where it's going to be an easier game for others to play.
7981000	7990000	That being said, I actually watched this little video circulating around Facebook where they've created glasses that allow colorblind people to see color.
7991000	7992000	I saw that.
7993000	7994000	And I wonder how that works with a game.
7994000	7995000	Good question.
7996000	8004000	So, I mean, this is really good, but I wonder then if we're not going to see those glasses become more mainstream and this not be a need.
8005000	8007000	Still good of them to consider the colorblind.
8008000	8012000	Absolutely. You know, and just in general, there's been a lot of good news for accessibility in gaming.
8013000	8019000	Like, World of Warcraft just did something almost exactly like this about a month ago where they put in a patch that really lets you adjust colors.
8019000	8024000	So that, you know, colorblind folks can have the world be a little more tailored for accessibility purposes.
8025000	8034000	And then, of course, we've talked about the upcoming PlayStation update where it's not color so much, but button mapping will be a part of the system firmware.
8035000	8040000	So that way, even if a game neglects to do button remapping, you can override it in the PlayStation 4 firmware.
8041000	8042000	And I think that's awesome.
8042000	8049000	Because how many times have we sat here going, this game would be a lot better if you could just remap the buttons to something that makes a little more sense.
8050000	8060000	Or I've had it where game pads will break slightly and it's like, oh, my L3s or R3s not working or something like that, you know, and I really wish I could map this to something else.
8061000	8070000	You know, last month on the show, it was a few weeks ago on the show, I gave that Qbert game, the Qbert rebooted on PlayStation 4, I gave it a lot of shit.
8070000	8075000	Because it controlled like ass and I still believe that and I said it in the review I did at VOG.
8076000	8088000	But, you know, if on the PlayStation 4 firmware, I'm going to be able to turn the hops into using buttons instead, like I just would use the buttons and for the left and right use L1 and R1.
8089000	8093000	I actually think that game could be playable. I don't think it would necessarily make it good.
8093000	8100000	It's not going to fix all the problems that that game had, but at least I wouldn't like want to give up after literally one minute of playing it.
8101000	8108000	So that'll be kind of cool. But anyway, I digress a little bit. But I think these accessibility things are really, really cool.
8109000	8115000	Hitstun in our chat room says, I want to update my VOG jam game to include button mapping. You should do it.
8115000	8126000	You should do it. I don't think Bobby would take issue to you updating the file at VOG network. If he does, then he's being a meanie mean and he's holding that Jones in the fast lane thing against me far too long.
8127000	8137000	Hitstun also says AbleGamers has great guidelines for developers to make stuff accessible. Rule number one, let people remap the buttons. Very good. Very good.
8138000	8148000	Dungeon Buster says, I don't think I've been back on Destiny for a few months or so now. You know, it's interesting. I was thinking about it when I was putting together today's show role and saw that this was something Jamie wanted to talk about on the show.
8149000	8154000	It kind of did make me go, I do need to go check out what's changed to Destiny.
8155000	8160000	I need to play it since I have it and I have not played it yet. That and Watch Dogs.
8161000	8164000	Yeah, I would play Destiny with you if you're curious about it.
8165000	8166000	I need to stop buying games.
8167000	8173000	Last but not least, I love this comment from Act F. This is by far the most important thing about the update with the music changing.
8174000	8181000	Act F says, finally, we can now play the moon theme from DuckTales when playing on the moon in Destiny.
8182000	8190000	Yes, sir, you are correct. Perfect answer. Best news. More important than anything else. Okay, maybe not anything else.
8191000	8192000	Loki, what do you have for us?
8192000	8200000	Alright, so, you know, a lot of people may be running Windows on their PCs of choice.
8201000	8206000	A lot of them also may be running not so legit copies of Windows.
8207000	8215000	However, Microsoft is kind of okay with that currently as far as the upgrades to Windows 10 since those will be free.
8215000	8224000	Basically saying, we're excited to launch Windows 10 this summer and anyone with a qualified device can upgrade Windows 10, including those with pirated copies of Windows.
8225000	8233000	We believe that the customer over time will realize the value of properly licensing Windows and we will make it easy for them to move to legitimate copies.
8234000	8243000	So that's kind of nice. I wonder what that means necessarily as far as like limitations and stuff like that or if it's just going to work and they're like, well, you'll just pay us when you feel like it.
8243000	8246000	Whereas the last two iterations of OS 10 have been free.
8247000	8251000	Well, and I think that's put pressure. I think that's probably exactly the reason why.
8252000	8253000	Linux is free.
8254000	8260000	Yeah, I think Microsoft had to reevaluate their model because all their competition is making money by having free operating systems.
8260000	8273000	So to be fair, though, Windows doesn't necessarily force obsolete, you know, force systems to become obsolete when you upgrade or can't upgrade to future versions of OS X or iOS.
8276000	8284000	Well, we'll see. We'll see what develops with this. I don't know. But free. You know what? Who's going to complain about free? I'm not.
8285000	8297000	And the best part about it, it's also coming in the summer. So look forward to an update, I guess, later on this year. And it'll be free for anybody that has Windows 7 or Windows 8.1.
8298000	8309000	Now YYR wants to point out, this is not news. Copies of Windows 7 and Windows 8 that are currently not activated will still not be activated after the upgrade and this will not change their genuine status.
8309000	8319000	Dungeon Buster pointing out it's free forever, but the offer only lasts a year. And so there's some links being given out in chat, which I don't have a lot of time to read all of that right now live on air.
8320000	8325000	But Dungeon Buster says if you don't upgrade in the year, you will have to pay for a Windows 10 copy.
8326000	8328000	That's stupid. They can always change that, though.
8329000	8339000	And not that I'm endorsing it, but I'm just saying the reality is, hackers gonna hack. And do you think a year will be enough time for them to figure out how to override whatever locks they're going to...
8340000	8348000	They've already done it with every single other version of their OS that they've put out, so I don't doubt that this will be hacked as well.
8349000	8358000	Alright, anyhow, let's move on. We're going to get to the mailbag. Every week you guys send us emails to participate at orangelaungeradio.com
8359000	8364000	And DarkSakura dives into the mailbag and pulls out some emails that she believes are worthy of our attention.
8370000	8372000	DarkSakura, what is in ye old mailbag this week?
8373000	8375000	YYR sends sup bitches.
8376000	8378000	Oh, that was back from March 6th. Oops.
8379000	8383000	Oh, I might have just missed that last week. You know, YYR, you weren't here last week, unfortunately.
8384000	8389000	YYR did a guest correspondence segment on the show and he did a very good job. And actually, I'm getting a lot of positive feedback to that.
8390000	8399000	So I'm just going to throw this out there again. If you think you can do a guest correspondence segment and you think we're not covering a story well enough and you want to do the story,
8400000	8410000	Send me an email. Talk to me about it. rob at vognetwork.com and we'll try to make it happen. You have to keep it to like 5 or 6 minutes. I can't have you going on for 3 hours about it.
8411000	8412000	But I really loved what he did last week.
8413000	8414000	Only we get to go on for 3 hours.
8415000	8417000	That's right. That's right. Still our show, dammit.
8418000	8419000	First email comes from Flaco Jones.
8420000	8423000	Okay, OLR, here's my cracked out NX console theory.
8424000	8431000	It's a portable slash console hybrid thing. It looks more like an iPad than a Wii U tablet controller but somehow retains physical buttons.
8432000	8437000	It plays all the mobile games that they dream up plus also plays traditional games.
8438000	8448000	You can do that and play all the games solo or for another $60 to $80 you can buy a separate piece of hardware that hooks to your TV and lets you play all the same games but on the TV with friends connecting via controllers.
8449000	8457000	It works like a reverse Wii U where the bulk of the power is in the handheld not in the device hooked up to the TV.
8458000	8466000	So that's it. A one stop shop. It's a handheld and home console and it's a tablet all at the same time and all the games are made for one system instead of being spread out among different platforms.
8467000	8469000	Maybe they can call it the Nintendo One.
8470000	8474000	The One's already taken for a console name. I don't know if Nintendo would want to do that.
8475000	8480000	But the rest of the theory, I could see that. A lot of it makes sense.
8481000	8486000	You didn't sell me at first because in the back of my mind I'm going Nintendo's not going to give up the living room experience.
8487000	8489000	Nintendo's bread and butter is that living room experience.
8490000	8496000	But when you talk about the power's in the tablet and you can beam it to a TV there could be a receiver or something.
8496000	8504000	Maybe they bundle in or sell something. I really don't think you could sell a Apple TV, a Nintendo TV or whatever.
8505000	8511000	I don't think you could sell that separately. It would have to be part of that base experience with a low cost or Nintendo's not going to be able to do it.
8512000	8514000	But I like where you're going with it.
8515000	8521000	I would like to know more about how Nintendo's going to do online. Maybe buff up Virtual Console a little bit.
8521000	8526000	But anyway, I like the majority of the theory he's proposing there.
8527000	8535000	We'll see. It could be anything. Who knew that motion gaming was going to be the thing that Nintendo would do that would do so amazingly well.
8536000	8542000	And who knew that when they embraced the tablet thing a lot of people wouldn't get it. So we'll see.
8543000	8545000	Was that it or is there more?
8546000	8547000	One more.
8547000	8551000	Hello LR. On the subject of PlayStation Mobile ending I'm not too surprised.
8552000	8558000	Around September 2013 I believe the subscription fee to become a developer went down from $99 to $0.
8559000	8562000	So I signed up and sold the dev kit and got started trying to put something together.
8563000	8569000	Everything seemed easy until I needed to draw a texture on the screen. With XNA this was one line of code. Very easy.
8570000	8574000	I searched the documentation but couldn't find a comparable function in the PlayStation Mobile libraries.
8574000	8582000	So I went to the development forums and amidst the why is performance so slow and when is this going to be fixed threads I asked how to draw a texture.
8583000	8591000	Someone on the team started to explain that in order to do this you need to set up a triangle to draw the texture on and started to explain how to do this in 2D.
8592000	8593000	And I gave up.
8594000	8599000	I knew that the team behind Xbox Live Indie Games had already significantly reduced their developer support by that point.
8599000	8607000	And the PSM developer forums seemed comparably quiet. Had a bad feeling about it and it looks like I was right.
8608000	8611000	I do however feel very bad for developers who won't be able to sell their work anymore.
8612000	8616000	Neon FM came up in conversation. The game is a lot of fun.
8617000	8619000	And I've enjoyed playing it but there's one major problem with it.
8620000	8625000	It has targets that move towards stationary versions of those targets and you have to do something when they overlap.
8625000	8633000	Konami claims ownership over this gameplay style and Harmonic Snack Division are just two entities that pay royalties to Konami as a result.
8634000	8638000	I feel like the lawsuit bomb is just waiting to explode and that makes me very sad.
8639000	8646000	Especially seeing as how they'll probably wait to drop it until Neon FM actually becomes popular and a sequel is about to come out. Freaking Konami.
8647000	8654000	I don't know if they can still do that though because like we were talking about earlier with the case against Data East and Capcom.
8655000	8661000	I don't know if you can't really copyright gameplay so I don't know how they would...
8662000	8667000	I mean I guess they could try bullying you with lawyers and if you agree to pay licensing towards it. I don't know.
8670000	8673000	Loki asked for a Zelda Maker but I see some problems with it.
8674000	8679000	Allowing us to create even more of our own scenarios might reduce demand for official Nintendo products.
8679000	8684000	Also devoted Nintendo fans may run out of amiibos to collect. Disaster!
8685000	8694000	But here we can fix both of those problems. Nintendo can just release another line of amiibo consisting of all the different Zelda enemy characters.
8695000	8699000	Octoroks, Staphos, P-hats, like likes, etc.
8700000	8705000	Then in order to put a particular character in the game you have to touch the amiibo to your Wii U gamepad first.
8706000	8709000	But what if you successfully manage to collect all of the amiibo?
8710000	8715000	Simple solution. Each amiibo can only be tapped 10 times before you have to go buy another one.
8716000	8717000	Genius! Another great new Nintendo experience.
8718000	8721000	You know what? It sounds like they're really gearing up for mobile then.
8722000	8725000	Enjoy it with your family. Hugs and kisses, Aaron Weiser.
8726000	8730000	I don't think that it would make less of a demand for Zelda games.
8730000	8735000	Why make Mario Maker then? Because Mario is your biggest breadwinner for Nintendo.
8736000	8737000	Obviously they're not worried about that.
8738000	8740000	And we're talking about an old style of the game anyways.
8741000	8745000	I'm talking old SNES Zelda.
8746000	8749000	Where every gamer has a voice but I'm taking years away after that.
8750000	8753000	I can't have those ideas out there in the universe.
8754000	8758000	There is a remote possibility that Reggie Fils-Aime listens to this show in his car.
8758000	8763000	I'm sure he eagerly awaits every new episode as he gets on his plane to fly from Washington.
8764000	8765000	You're smoking some crack, Rob.
8766000	8767000	I can't have him hearing that.
8768000	8769000	Put down the Topopo.
8770000	8773000	And then someday when I go to one of these Nintendo press conferences far, far in the future,
8774000	8775000	he'll look out into the audience and be like,
8776000	8777000	You!
8779000	8782000	And he will bring you up on stage and punch you in the face.
8783000	8784000	He will. He will. You better believe it.
8785000	8786000	I will fully embrace that.
8788000	8794000	yyrnchat over at live.vognetwork.com says,
8795000	8797000	You can only use the voice 10 times.
8798000	8802000	Everybody's been asking me when this show is finally going to make some damn money.
8803000	8804000	Oh my God, yyrnchat, you're a genius.
8805000	8811000	I'm going to limit the amount of calls you can make to this program until you join the OLR Premium Club.
8812000	8814000	How's that? No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding, people. I'm kidding.
8815000	8816000	Get your finger off the pause button.
8816000	8817000	We'll call it. We'll call it.
8818000	8819000	I'm sorry.
8820000	8821000	We'll make them OL Army officers.
8822000	8825000	I'm sorry, if you'd like to shit some more in this game, you're going to need to purchase more taco bucks in order to purchase tacos.
8830000	8834000	Alright, let's get into the FUs. That's it for the mailbag tonight?
8835000	8839000	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com if you would like to send us some emails for the future.
8840000	8843000	I'm sure what I just said might just burn some more emails. We'll see there.
8843000	8846000	Alright, let's get to the FUs of the week.
8847000	8851000	Every week here we like to say FU to a few things that are bothering us in the game world and beyond.
8852000	8857000	Why? Because after 591 episodes, we do have a fuck to give.
8874000	8878000	Fuck you to human frailty and mortality. That's it.
8879000	8880000	Hello, Keith.
8881000	8890000	Fuck you for not having enough time to work on all these awesome game ideas I have. I have another idea for a puzzle game that incorporates a phrase I've been using on this show for a long time.
8891000	8894000	It's so goddamn hilarious. I just can't wait to prototype this thing.
8895000	8897000	Oh, joy. Another game for you to start when you have it finished.
8898000	8901000	No, no, no. It's going to be quick. It's a simple concept, but it's so ridiculous.
8901000	8904000	Bobby Black Wolf is currently looking at his brain.
8905000	8909000	I'm still going to finish this first, but when I'm done...
8910000	8918000	Alright, let's see. My FU of the week goes to my old Keurig machine. I'm surprised our soccer didn't comment when she walked in here.
8919000	8921000	My old Keurig machine finally bit the dust this week.
8922000	8923000	In what way?
8923000	8932000	After five years. It will no longer... It can't suck anymore. The water will not suck. It's gone from suck to blow.
8933000	8943000	Anyway, there it is. So yeah, I had to go out and buy a new coffee maker this week, but I will say the new coffee maker is a little faster, so I like getting my coffee fast.
8944000	8946000	You know how bad those are for the environment, though.
8946000	8955000	Okay, Debbie Downer, I want my coffee. I saw those things where you could turn them into little planners and cute shit, and I'm fine with that. That's fine.
8956000	8958000	I also have a reusable K-cup that I do use.
8959000	8960000	I got it for you.
8961000	8962000	You have like two or three of them.
8963000	8965000	I did buy you a box of K-cups at Dunkin' Donuts.
8966000	8968000	Yay! I love Dunkin' Donuts.
8969000	8970000	Fuck you, environment. Anyway.
8971000	8982000	Anyhow, there it is for the FUs of the week. So we have one more story, and then we are going to open up the Skype line over at 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8983000	8990000	But the last story I have for you guys has to do with Tetris, and how Tetris is being used for educational purposes.
8990000	8997000	The European Central Bank created a game called Tetris New 20 Euro.
8998000	9007000	You can play this in your browser, and it's a variation on Tetris that will let you learn security facts about the new 20 euro note.
9008000	9011000	Because, you know, people like to counterfeit money, and they do the same thing in the US.
9012000	9016000	They've redone the $20 bill, I don't know how many times, and they always put all these new security things in it.
9016000	9022000	Like, you can hold it up to a light, and you see the strip, and there's like heat sensitive ink, and all this crazy stuff.
9023000	9024000	So I'm sure the 20 euro note is no different.
9025000	9033000	But what's interesting about this is that they're using Tetris, and when you beat a level, you learn a fact about how to fake a 20 euro bill.
9034000	9035000	Just kidding. Obviously you don't want to fake them.
9035000	9047000	But did you know that as one sample fact here, the portrait of Europa, who's pictured on the bill, becomes a transparent hologram if you hold it up to the light.
9048000	9058000	So there you go. If you're horrible at Tetris though, you'll still be trying to use a copy machine to copy 20 dollar euros, because you won't get to learn anything about the security facts.
9058000	9065000	And obviously I'm making jokes, don't copy money, don't end up arrested as a result of this show.
9066000	9067000	Don't copy that euro.
9068000	9069000	Yeah, don't copy that floppy or that euro.
9070000	9077000	Skypline is open, it's that time. 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype, which Skype's on every stinking device these days, and phone.
9078000	9081000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word if you want to give us a call.
9082000	9084000	Over in the chat room, some concern over my coffee there.
9084000	9089000	SHO 100 Matt says, Rob, just don't get those Keurig 2.0 machines because they're coffee DRM.
9090000	9098000	Oh, you better believe it. We researched and we stayed away from the 2.0 machines. They actually still have a 1.0 model, at least Target did.
9099000	9103000	Honestly, the model I picked up is almost exactly like my old machine.
9104000	9111000	There's a little chip that can read if the foil is genuine on the cup, and if it's not, then it will reject it.
9111000	9113000	It will not brew the coffee. It says, I will not brew coffee.
9114000	9115000	So it has to be licensed by Keurig?
9116000	9118000	Yes. Oh, you didn't hear about the coffee DRM? Oh, it's awesome.
9119000	9120000	None shall brew.
9121000	9122000	None shall brew.
9123000	9124000	I don't have one of those. I use a drip.
9125000	9127000	But, you know, people found a way around it. Do you know what you do?
9128000	9129000	You save the foil from the previous one?
9130000	9132000	You just save the foil from the one before and put it right on top of the new one.
9133000	9136000	How easy was that?
9137000	9138000	I guess.
9138000	9139000	Coffee DRM. What would they think of next?
9140000	9141000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
9142000	9143000	Hey, this is Hack Def.
9144000	9145000	Hey, Hack Def. What's on your mind, my friend?
9146000	9147000	So, you're one of us.
9148000	9150000	Oh God, the amiibo thing, right?
9151000	9154000	Yeah. Did I talk about it on this show or was that only on Bobby's show?
9155000	9156000	I don't remember.
9157000	9162000	Okay, well, I got the Wii Fit Trainer amiibo from AkumaJP, but that was a gift, so you can't hold that one against me.
9163000	9167000	But this week, I guess I talked about this on Bobby's show. I didn't talk about it here.
9168000	9181000	So, this week, a friend of mine wanted to go buy Pokemon for his new 3DS, because he just got one of the new 3DSs, and he didn't have, because he didn't even have any 3DS at all, but he wanted to get Pokemon.
9182000	9188000	So, we actually went to GameStop, and you guys know I don't ever go to GameStop either.
9188000	9198000	We went in, and sure enough, sitting on the shelf, Mega Man amiibo. And I was like, I have to have it. I want it.
9199000	9205000	So, everything I've said about, I'm done with this amiibo game. I'm over it. I'm not supporting it anymore.
9206000	9207000	I'm not shopping at GameStop.
9208000	9217000	I'm not shopping at GameStop. That Mega Man looked me in the face and said, please love me. Capcom stopped loving me a long time ago, but won't you love me and take me home?
9218000	9221000	So, I bought it, and now it has a home sitting on my shelf.
9222000	9229000	I'm not surprised about you buying the amiibo, because if you look up the Mega Man amiibo, it's one of the pretty much better looking ones.
9230000	9231000	Yeah, it really is.
9232000	9237000	I'm more surprised of you buying the GameStop, especially after my friend about it months ago.
9237000	9243000	You know, it was one of those things where my friend was like, let's go to the mall, we can go to these different places, and I can go to GameStop.
9244000	9252000	And I'm not, you know, I'm not going to be the type to say like, oh no friend, listen to me, you can't shop at GameStop, because you know what, I'm not going to ruin somebody's day.
9253000	9255000	Just fine. If that's what you want to do, go, fine.
9255000	9266000	Yeah, that's it. If you have something that's on GameStop, if you want to buy it, well then, buy it.
9267000	9277000	But yeah, speaking of the amiibos, pretty much I have also expanded my collection a little bit. Sorry.
9278000	9280000	A little horse here.
9280000	9287000	That's alright. Alan is very sick this week actually, he hasn't dropped on the show this week because he's not allowed to bring germs into the studio.
9288000	9297000	But yeah, I got some of the new amiibo, I got the Toad amiibo, and the new Yoshi amiibo too.
9298000	9308000	Yeah, you know, actually I saw they also had it at GameStop, they had the new Luigi and the new Princess and some of those Super Mario amiibo, but I could, like, one, one only.
9309000	9317000	Mega Man, I'm doing it, and I'm not buying all these other ones as well, because at least I didn't like, totally, because there is a part of me that would have been like, I'm buying ten.
9318000	9321000	I'm buying all ten you have on the shelf, I'm buying them all. But I resisted that, so.
9321000	9333000	Yeah, I'm limited in myself too. I'm pretty much only collecting, or at least will try to collect, all the Smash Brothers ones, but I got the Yoshi one because it looks pretty nice.
9334000	9338000	It looks pretty. And I got the Toad one because of Captain Toad Treasure Tracker.
9339000	9344000	And what does Toad do in Toad Treasure Tracker, the amiibo? I haven't played that yet.
9344000	9361000	It isn't that much. It has a new mode of gameplay, if you can say it like that. In each level of the game, it hides a pixel Toad, an 8-bit Toad basically, and you have to find it.
9362000	9371000	And after you find it, you have to tap your gamepad, and that's pretty much it. Some of them are easy, and some of them are pretty hard to find.
9371000	9384000	In one of the levels, I pretty much lasted like ten minutes trying to find him, after I finally found him.
9385000	9394000	And it's pretty much really fun. It has a little bit of replayability if you have finished the game, like me in this case.
9394000	9408000	But yeah, it's suffering a little but fun addition. So if you have Treasure Tracker, you can pretty much get a Toad. It's not that hard to find. There are a lot of stores happening.
9409000	9419000	So if you want to add a little bit to that, you can buy it. And again, it's fun, and it adds that replayability to the game.
9420000	9427000	Well, that's good to know about. I didn't play enough of Captain Toad. I bought it, and I played a little bit of it, but then I just, you know,
9428000	9434000	Ooh, shiny, a new game over here. Ooh, I gotta play eleven more hours of Final Fantasy XIV, because I thought it would be a good idea to start grinding the books in that game.
9435000	9441000	So, you know, things happen to distract me, but I like Captain Toad. I need to go back and do some more levels and play with this amiibo stuff, for sure.
9442000	9454000	Yeah, Captain Toad is a really great game to play in little bits. It's a short game. You don't need to spend that much time playing it.
9455000	9462000	So yeah, you can play it, and with the Toad amiibo, you can add a little bit more. Sorry.
9463000	9469000	You know, it strikes me as the kind of game to Captain Toad that might be alright on a tablet.
9471000	9481000	I wonder. I wonder. I don't know, parts of it would. Like, obviously there were some levels, like when you're in the mine cart and stuff, that might be a little more difficult and might not translate so well,
9482000	9487000	but, like, the base game, or at least the levels as they were in Mario 3D Land might kind of work. I don't know.
9488000	9497000	Maybe, but I don't know. The controls would be really kind of awkward, but it maybe could work. Maybe.
9498000	9501000	Alright. Well, Act F, I'm going to let you go to get more calls, but thanks so much for calling in tonight.
9502000	9503000	Hey, thanks for having me.
9504000	9505000	No, of course. Anytime. Anytime. Take care.
9506000	9514000	1877 Game O.L.R., or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word. Tigerclaw shared this in the chatroom, and I got a kick out of this.
9515000	9523000	I had heard that the new Mortal Kombat game, Mortal Kombat X, was going to be bringing a new type of, you know how they have fatality, babality, and all this stuff?
9523000	9529000	There was going to be a new type of ality that came into Mortal Kombat X, and they revealed it this week on Twitter.
9530000	9535000	Ed Boon wrote a tweet that says, what happens when your opponent disconnects during an online match?
9536000	9543000	You are rewarded with a quit-ality, is the new, it's a quit-ality. That is fucking brilliant. I love it.
9544000	9550000	And there it is, a little picture there of a quit-ality, because your opponent rage quit. I love that.
9550000	9552000	Dar Sakura, you like that? A quit-ality?
9553000	9554000	I am smirking deep within my soul.
9555000	9560000	You couldn't do that back in the day. Well, I guess you could. You could just say, like, throw your hands up and just walk away.
9561000	9566000	Fuck this game. Just walk away. But then, you know, you lost your quarter, so, or 50 cents, depending on where you gamed at.
9567000	9571000	Alright, we got another call coming in, so let's do it. Hi on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
9572000	9573000	Hey, hey, it's Ronma.
9574000	9575000	Hey, Ronma, how you doing?
9576000	9577000	Not much, I'm alright, how about you?
9578000	9579000	I'm super, thanks for asking. What's on your mind tonight?
9580000	9587000	Well, I called because, um, I don't know if you realize, but you did break one of the cardinal rules of OLR and VOG.
9588000	9590000	I shopped at Evil G?
9591000	9592000	Yes, you have to give your pennants.
9593000	9597000	Hail Betty White, Hail Betty White, Hail Betty White.
9598000	9600000	Nah, my brother, you gotta do a little bit more than that.
9601000	9602000	Okay, what?
9603000	9608000	1,000 B.Arthurs, 2,000 Betty Whites, and 300 Fairchild Channel Fs.
9609000	9611000	I'll get started on that right after the show.
9612000	9613000	Good, good, good.
9614000	9620000	Uh, love it, love it. Uh, so, uh, you're, you're, you're, uh, you're very upset at me for my shopping adventure?
9621000	9628000	Uh, no, I'm just busting your balls about because you kind of got on me when I talked to you about G4 years ago, so I think we're even now.
9629000	9633000	I, I appreciate, I appreciate the listeners looking out. That's the last time I...
9634000	9635000	That's because we love you!
9635000	9641000	I'm never, you know what, I'm not tweeting that shit in the future. In the future, I'm just going to be like, somebody's going to come over and be like, Rob, when did you get a Mega Man amiibo?
9642000	9643000	And I'm just going to be like, I don't know, maybe, maybe Allen bought it.
9644000	9645000	You disappeared.
9646000	9647000	I think Allen got it, I wasn't looking.
9648000	9649000	Oh, why are you going to blame him? Come on!
9650000	9651000	Okay, fine, I'll blame the cats.
9652000	9653000	Rob, Rob, Rob, Rob.
9654000	9655000	Thrift store.
9656000	9657000	Yeah, Sanrio brought it in from the backyard.
9658000	9659000	Thrift store.
9660000	9663000	Which is funny, I found a Mega Man amiibo for 20 bucks at the flea market in Mobile, Alabama.
9663000	9664000	Did you really?
9665000	9668000	I did, I almost bought it. And then I was like, wait, I just bought two Atari controllers for three bucks.
9669000	9670000	I, I wanted...
9671000	9672000	And one of them is kind of rare.
9673000	9674000	I wanted to go to the flea market this weekend here in Sac, but I just...
9675000	9676000	Let's go to the flea market next week.
9677000	9678000	I'm going possibly to Reno next week.
9679000	9680000	Too bad, we're going.
9681000	9682000	I may be in Reno next week, which, yeah.
9683000	9692000	Well, apparently I got to check out some arcades out there. Tiger Claw may not realize this, but I was actually on Google Plus, and I was posting the Orange Sanrio question of the week on Google Plus.
9693000	9698000	And the comment he made on a video that was like a Reno arcade thing actually showed up in the feed.
9699000	9700000	And of course I looked at it and I was like, I want to see this.
9701000	9706000	And I didn't realize they have this arcade up in Reno that has like quite a few classic games at Pepper Mill, which is why I never realized it was there.
9707000	9708000	Because why on earth would I go to the Pepper Mill casino?
9709000	9713000	But I need to check it out apparently. They've got a lot of classic games there, so...
9714000	9717000	Thanks, Tiger Claw. You didn't even know you gave me a tip without realizing it.
9718000	9719000	You got to watch what you Plus won.
9720000	9722000	Anyway, what else is on your mind, Rama? Anything?
9723000	9729000	Ah, I know that. I just called, you know, to playfully give you shit for going to the evil of GRs. I like to call them Shame Stop.
9730000	9733000	Well, I appreciate it. It's fine. It's fine. What's coming up on Anime Jam Session this week?
9734000	9743000	Well, we are getting ready for Zenkai Con this weekend. Marco is still working on the outlines, so I'll know what we're definitely talking about.
9743000	9753000	But there is an interesting article about furry cosplay, how it's come a long, long way, and it's like, it's really articulate and really nice, so...
9754000	9762000	There's no more the whole cosplay versus furries thing. It's like we've kind of made peace. We're happy now. We've all worked together.
9763000	9769000	Alright. That's, that's, yeah, yeah. Cosplay is for everybody, right?
9769000	9783000	Yes, and that's, you know, that's what is starting to take a stronger trend now, because now that you've got cosplayers who are trying to do it for the publicity and this and that, the trend is now moving from that towards fun, and now, why not both?
9784000	9790000	Porque no los dos. Alright. Take care, my friend. I'm going to let you go so we can get some more calls. Thank you for calling in to yell at me.
9791000	9792000	Hey, no problem, because I love you.
9793000	9794000	Alright. Mwah. Bye.
9794000	9802000	1-877-GAME-OL-R, username on Skype, Orange Laundrio. Akuma JP in chat asking, did I start something I'm not supposed to? Rob is shopping at Evil G.
9803000	9813000	No, no, no, no. Don't blame you. Don't blame you. I did not know about your gift, actually. I did not know about that until, actually, it was when Jamie called me yesterday evening.
9814000	9821000	So, funny enough, only like a few hours after buying that Mega Man did I even find out that you had bought the generous gift that you gave me.
9821000	9835000	But even if that wasn't the case, I mean, it would be pretty cool. I just love the fact that, dude, I got an Amiibo that actually came from Japan, and the fact that it came from a listener is like super cool as well.
9836000	9846000	Like, I, you know, even if it was something like, even if you'd sent me like an Xbox One game and I don't even own an Xbox One right now, I'd be like, that's so cool that somebody did that.
9846000	9855000	So, at least the Wii Fit Trainer Amiibo, I can use that, and I'm going to train that, and I'm going to enter that Amiibo in some tournaments. You better bet, and it'll be awesome.
9856000	9869000	Alright, so anyhow, 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to call in here while we wait to see if the phone lines go off. Askin' Loki or Dark Soccer real quick, any last minute stories you guys might have?
9869000	9882000	Sure. So the Driver franchise is coming back, because I'm really excited how the Driver series has gone. This time, it's coming back as Driver Speed of a Paradise, which is an Android and iOS game.
9883000	9891000	And it looks exactly like, I don't know, Hydro Thunder. Hooray!
9892000	9901000	And then I was going to also mention that there's a brand new game jam that's going on now, called the Boob Is Life game jam.
9902000	9904000	It's celebrating boobs in games.
9905000	9919000	I was, you know, I gave that the benefit of the doubt for like a half minute, and I was like, oh, is it like, maybe like, breast cancer awareness? Like, is it trying to bring and raise, nope, okay, oh, it's just, oh, it's porny, okay, I see.
9920000	9928000	That's too bad. I thought there might have been a good note there. I suppose not. What if, okay, wait, what are the rules of the boob game?
9928000	9946000	There's only one rule. The only rule is it must have boob in game. Any size, big or small, a mini boob, or not mini boob, main feature or small feature must have, but must have, female boob is the best thing on the planet, but man boob, boob, okay if insist.
9947000	9950000	Okay, I was going to ask, are man boobs okay?
9951000	9952000	Yes.
9952000	9958000	Alright, so man boobs are okay. Good, then I don't have to read this whole thing going on there, whatever.
9959000	9972000	It's the internet, people. There's something for everything there on the internet. 1877 Game OLR, or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call, last chance to get in before we close it up for the night. Anything else, Logie?
9973000	9991000	There's supposed to be a tease being done by Famitsu about some sort of new game that's coming out for the DS and Wii, I'm assuming they mean Wii U. Something by Level 5, maybe Dragon Quest-ish, but not sure what that is.
9992000	9997000	Level 5 did Fantasy Life, so we already know that sequel's coming, so we'd be surprised if they were working on something there too.
9998000	10000000	That'd be kind of cool if it was for the Wii U as well.
10000000	10014000	That'd be nice. Tiger Lot sent me this earlier in the night, apparently Roller Coaster Tycoon World. The graphics are being changed because fans complained. There was a gameplay trailer that came out and fans weren't happy with it after the trailer came out.
10015000	10019000	Well, they said, yeah, I remember reading, they said, oh, it's from pre-alpha footage, you know, that's why.
10020000	10022000	Yeah, don't get mad, people, don't get mad.
10023000	10037000	Supposedly, this game is coming in mid-2015, so if those graphics have to be changed, I'm gonna think they're gonna do it quick, but it was a pre-alpha, it was a pre-alpha, don't panic, people. Don't panic. Please give us your money. Please. Here it is.
10038000	10050000	Alright, um, let's see here, um, 1877 Game O.L.R., or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.
10051000	10058000	I guess I'll leave that open for one more minute here, because I see some people in chat might be trying to get through, so we'll wait on that real quick here, but then I'm gonna close it up.
10059000	10061000	Um, any other stories?
10062000	10063000	I got nothing else.
10064000	10071000	Yeah, it was kind of a slower week this week, um, I mean, you had some big stories, some big, big news, but then outside of that, it was kind of slim pickins, so.
10072000	10085000	Alright, well, sadly, it doesn't look like the phones are lighting up there, so I am, sadly, gonna have to close it down. I'm sorry to those that didn't get through, but please consider sending us an email over at, uh, participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
10086000	10090000	Uh, you can also tweet at us, Twitter.com slash O.L.R.
10091000	10101000	Uh, if you want to send us your thoughts after the show, of course, uh, many folks also participate in the forums, sometimes we get some comments on the episodes as well, over at VogNetwork.com.
10102000	10111000	Uh, I mentioned this earlier in the show, but next week on the show, we're gonna have, uh, talk a little more about the, uh, Sacramento Indie Arcade event that's happening in April that we're gonna be broadcasting live from.
10112000	10132000	We're gonna have Brianna and Gabriel here in studio, live, to talk about, uh, that event, and I know Gabriel's gonna want to talk about his game, uh, that just had a demo go to Desura today, Crumple, so they'll be on the show next week when you talk all about all those things, and they'll also be here with us to chat and laugh at the news with us next week.
10133000	10134000	So, uh, that's to look forward to next week.
10135000	10149000	Also coming up in the month of April, uh, Kyle Ward gonna be coming on the show, I think I mentioned that before, uh, Kyle Ward, of course, has a long history of the music games, um, he's got new games coming out, Ditto Beat, and ReRave, now on Android devices, ReRave Plus.
10150000	10159000	He will be on the show in April, we're still working out exactly what date that is going to be, so, uh, we're working out some other guests as well for the month of April, so we're gonna have a lot of cool stuff to look forward to coming up in the coming weeks.
10160000	10166000	But now is the part of the show where I say thank you for listening to the show, thank you for supporting independent radio, thank you for downloading our show.
10167000	10187000	If you liked what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two or fifty about the show, help spread the word, because, you know, we're not supported by some big website, we don't have a big budget, we, we just do this because we love games, and we love you guys, and the family that we have here that turns out every Sunday night, and we just want it to grow with more cool, awesome people.
10187000	10198000	So, tell a friend or five about the show, and if you really can't think of anyone to tell, you could always leave us a nice review on iTunes or Stitcher Radio, those reviews, I tell you, they go a long way.
10199000	10203000	Wherever you found out about the show, please leave a nice review and let someone else find out about it too.
10204000	10210000	It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought for the night before we can wrap up. Uh, Loki, we'll start with you tonight, your final thought?
10210000	10222000	I'm still trying to figure out what the title of my second level here of my game, because I'm trying to give it, like, a funny title for each one, but, without kind of giving away what the gimmick is, I don't know, we'll figure it out, I guess.
10223000	10224000	Alright.
10225000	10227000	And what the hell am I going to do with this amiibo? I guess I'll put it on my shelf.
10228000	10230000	It is, well, I mean, the nice thing about amiibo, they're good figures too.
10231000	10232000	Yeah, they are. It's a standing box.
10233000	10235000	You do have, you have kids, well, the kids might be too young for that.
10236000	10237000	Kids will eat that.
10237000	10239000	They can appreciate it in a couple more years though.
10240000	10250000	Alright, my final thought for the night, my final thought is, oh my god, those pear candies, like, how many years is it going to be before I get to have another one?
10251000	10256000	I need, some place in Japantown and SF must have those, and we must find them, Dark Sakura, I'm just saying.
10257000	10261000	They didn't have it at Oto's last time I was there, so we will, that's what we need to do, Rob.
10261000	10266000	We need to make a pilgrimage to Japantown for candy.
10267000	10268000	Sounds good to me.
10269000	10273000	We checked, like, Coriana Plaza or something like that, that has, like, a bunch of, like, stuff from all around.
10274000	10275000	Oh, over in Rancho?
10276000	10277000	Yeah, they have, like, all sorts of stuff.
10278000	10279000	That's right, I forget they have more, like, cause when I lived over there-
10280000	10281000	Didn't they, like, buy every store next to them?
10282000	10285000	Yeah, when I lived over there, they didn't really have anything, but now they've got a ton of stuff over there.
10286000	10287000	It's a huge, yeah, thing, so you might check over there.
10288000	10289000	Well, Dark Sakura, we might have to make a trip, we'll see.
10289000	10293000	Alright, anyhow, Dark Sakura, last but not least, your final thought for the night.
10295000	10296000	Bye, bitches.
10297000	10300000	Have a great week, everybody, we'll be back in seven days to do it all over again.
10301000	10305000	Have fun gaming, be civil to each other, have a wonderful night. Good night.
