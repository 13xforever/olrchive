00:00.000 --> 00:17.400
This week, music gaming is bustled with news of an arcade upstart, giving waiting players

00:17.400 --> 00:20.840
something to do, and the return of Rock Band coming to most of this generation's consoles

00:20.840 --> 00:21.840
and more.

00:21.840 --> 00:25.040
Join us for this, stories from PAX, as well as your comments, calls and more right now

00:25.040 --> 00:31.560
on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:31.560 --> 00:34.960
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:34.960 --> 00:36.480
where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.480 --> 00:46.980
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with this episode 590 for Sunday, March 15th of 2015.

00:46.980 --> 00:52.680
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me live in studio is Techmaster Loki.

00:52.680 --> 00:53.680
How are you doing, Loki?

00:53.680 --> 00:54.680
I'm doing okay.

00:54.680 --> 00:55.840
I bought too much pizza.

00:55.840 --> 00:57.640
But you brought a lot of pizza.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.240
You actually had to unload pizza on me.

00:59.240 --> 01:00.240
It doesn't always happen.

01:00.240 --> 01:07.000
But it's Little Caesars and five bucks for a large pizza, so it's like, eh, why not?

01:07.000 --> 01:09.200
Is there such a thing as too much pizza?

01:09.200 --> 01:10.200
Almost.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.720
I don't think they had them.

01:11.720 --> 01:15.160
You know they have those hot and ready pizzas, so you just go ahead and pay money and they

01:15.160 --> 01:18.940
just throw you a pizza instead of having to wait for them to cook it.

01:18.940 --> 01:23.680
I don't know if they have those bacon-wrapped pizzas because they have their new, was it

01:23.680 --> 01:26.600
bacon crust?

01:26.600 --> 01:30.280
There might actually be a thing as too much bacon and that pizza sounds like it.

01:30.280 --> 01:31.440
It's just wrapped in bacon.

01:31.440 --> 01:35.600
I think it's just too much hype, to be honest, but I was going to try that.

01:35.600 --> 01:36.600
Wait, food?

01:36.600 --> 01:37.760
Too much hype?

01:37.760 --> 01:38.760
In fast food?

01:38.760 --> 01:44.360
I didn't actually want pizza, to be honest, but my first choice, despite their website

01:44.360 --> 01:49.300
and their door hours saying that they should be open, they were closed, and so I had to

01:49.300 --> 01:50.300
improvise.

01:50.300 --> 01:54.100
Alright, it wouldn't be an episode of Orange Lounge Radio if we didn't talk about food

01:54.100 --> 01:57.900
at the top of the show, but believe it or not, it is a show about video games.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.980
But I do have to mention something on a serious note.

01:59.980 --> 02:03.860
You'll notice I did not introduce Dark Sakura in the introductions tonight.

02:03.860 --> 02:04.860
She's fine.

02:04.860 --> 02:07.060
She'll be back on the show next week.

02:07.060 --> 02:11.060
I had to ask her if I could get permission to share this because she did have a bit of

02:11.060 --> 02:14.620
a personal crisis this week and I did get permission to share with you all what's going

02:14.620 --> 02:16.420
on with Dark Sakura.

02:16.420 --> 02:22.020
Dark Sakura was mentioned previously on the program about her upbringing in Mobile and

02:22.020 --> 02:26.460
she shared a lot of stories with us about her family and so forth, and one of the people

02:26.460 --> 02:30.700
I know that was very close to her in her upbringing that she talks about a lot on the show is

02:30.700 --> 02:33.940
her grandma.

02:33.940 --> 02:39.620
She's spoken very fondly about her grandma and has mentioned some medical issues that

02:39.620 --> 02:43.700
her grandma was facing over the past few weeks here on the program.

02:43.700 --> 02:47.660
Unfortunately last week, Dark Sakura's grandma did pass away.

02:47.660 --> 02:51.740
So she had to go to Alabama at the drop of a hat to go be with her family.

02:51.740 --> 02:57.260
So she left town, I think, on Thursday or Friday night and she won't be back until Thursday.

02:57.260 --> 03:01.180
So I just want to pass that along to all you guys.

03:01.180 --> 03:03.740
I know here at Orange and Ontario, we've been going for so long.

03:03.740 --> 03:09.220
There's so many of you that show up week after week and support us, not just for the laughs,

03:09.220 --> 03:12.980
but for all the things that we go personally deal with in our lives as well.

03:12.980 --> 03:16.360
And if you have a minute to let Dark Sakura know you're sending some hugs, I know she

03:16.360 --> 03:17.860
would really, really appreciate it.

03:17.860 --> 03:21.880
So I just want to let you all know that's what was going on with Dark Sakura and she's

03:21.880 --> 03:26.580
a Mobile, but she will be back on the show next week and we will move on with the show

03:26.580 --> 03:29.260
as we always do.

03:29.260 --> 03:34.300
That all being said, let's try to get into some video games and gaming, of course with

03:34.300 --> 03:39.380
you guys live in the chat room as you are every week with us at live.vognetwork.com

03:39.380 --> 03:43.660
where we do tape live at the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, every Sunday

03:43.660 --> 03:49.380
night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, which

03:49.380 --> 03:53.340
we actually did some announcements in between the show tonight, but I will get back to that

03:53.340 --> 03:55.020
in a little bit.

03:55.020 --> 03:58.020
First off tonight, after welcoming all you guys in chat, and thank you, I see a lot of

03:58.020 --> 04:02.580
kind words for Jamie's grandmother in chat, I will pass that along to her.

04:02.580 --> 04:06.500
But those of you that follow her on Tumblr, Twitter, or even Facebook, I know she's got

04:06.500 --> 04:10.340
a Facebook page, you might want to stop by there if you have a chance because I don't

04:10.340 --> 04:13.980
think she'll be in the chat tonight considering they're three hours ahead and her schedule

04:13.980 --> 04:17.900
is adjusted a little bit with her family, she's going to bed a little earlier when she's

04:17.900 --> 04:19.900
out there.

04:19.900 --> 04:24.300
Anyhow, let's bring the focus back to games a little bit.

04:24.300 --> 04:28.420
We were not here last week because I was at PAX.

04:28.420 --> 04:33.980
I went to Penny Arcade Expo, PAX East, which is the first time I've been to the show in

04:33.980 --> 04:35.740
probably five years.

04:35.740 --> 04:37.860
I went to the very first PAX East.

04:37.860 --> 04:42.820
We all went to PAX, myself, Loki, and Dark Sakura all went to PAX in 2008.

04:42.820 --> 04:46.700
That was a fun year because we actually got to broadcast live from the show floor, right?

04:46.700 --> 04:47.700
That was fun.

04:47.700 --> 04:48.700
That was a lot of fun.

04:48.700 --> 04:52.460
And then 2010, we got to go to the show and had a lot of fun.

04:52.460 --> 04:59.900
And this year, I went to the show as well, but it was a tough show this year.

04:59.900 --> 05:03.140
The good news is, loved getting to see people.

05:03.140 --> 05:07.620
Loved getting to see people I hardly ever get to see, but maybe once every five years

05:07.620 --> 05:09.340
at these sorts of things.

05:09.340 --> 05:13.020
The gals from Electric Sistahood, which shout out to their show because they had Bobby and

05:13.020 --> 05:19.820
I on their show during PAX East, which we got to tape out in one of the hallways connecting

05:19.820 --> 05:20.980
some of the rooms.

05:20.980 --> 05:22.500
So that was really cool.

05:22.500 --> 05:25.900
And just getting to meet up with some listeners and people that I know have been listening

05:25.900 --> 05:26.900
to the show for a very long time.

05:26.900 --> 05:29.220
I thought that was really cool.

05:29.220 --> 05:33.420
But I got to say, there's a lot of frustrations as well that I've kind of been going through

05:33.420 --> 05:34.940
with PAX East.

05:34.940 --> 05:41.340
The fact that the show is very crowded and there was a line for everything did not exactly

05:41.340 --> 05:42.900
help the situation.

05:42.900 --> 05:43.900
And I get it.

05:43.900 --> 05:45.580
Yeah, it's a big con.

05:45.580 --> 05:47.180
It's a huge thing that happens.

05:47.180 --> 05:52.020
But I mean, you would have these huge four-hour lines, I'm not even kidding, four-hour line

05:52.020 --> 05:54.180
to do the Oculus Rift.

05:54.180 --> 05:55.180
And they kept the line.

05:55.180 --> 05:58.840
So it's like, you can't even really stand around to get in the line.

05:58.840 --> 06:03.160
You have to kind of walk around the booth and maybe when you come back, you'll happen

06:03.160 --> 06:06.800
to catch that 60-second window where you can jump in the line.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.320
Bobby and I got to do this with Final Fantasy XIV.

06:09.320 --> 06:10.320
We lucked out.

06:10.320 --> 06:14.080
The line was capped, but we had actually turned around to go look at something else real quick.

06:14.080 --> 06:16.600
And then we noticed that the guy wasn't standing there.

06:16.600 --> 06:19.900
So we jumped in the line and immediately that Enforcer got back in the line behind us and

06:19.900 --> 06:20.900
capped it again.

06:20.900 --> 06:25.280
So we lucked out getting to do that Final Fantasy XIV thing where all I wanted was the

06:25.280 --> 06:26.280
t-shirt.

06:26.280 --> 06:29.520
All I wanted was the t-shirt that says, I beat Shiva.

06:29.520 --> 06:32.420
So phew, we got the shirt and I didn't have to worry about that anymore, but that was

06:32.420 --> 06:36.400
an hour wait just to play a game that I've already played online.

06:36.400 --> 06:42.220
But I think part of the problem that a lot of the demos on the show floor are having

06:42.220 --> 06:47.240
is that either A, they don't bring enough of it or B, the demos are a bit long.

06:47.240 --> 06:51.180
I think a lot of companies are bringing demos that might be a bit long and it's not really

06:51.180 --> 06:53.720
moving things along very quickly.

06:53.720 --> 06:57.840
I will give a shout out to Harmonix though, the Amplitude demo, they kept people moving

06:57.840 --> 06:58.840
pretty good.

06:58.840 --> 07:02.120
And that was one of the better demos I actually played at the show was the Amplitude demo,

07:02.120 --> 07:04.360
which I love me some music games, right?

07:04.360 --> 07:08.520
So I got to play the Amplitude demo and that was a lot of fun and they can move four players

07:08.520 --> 07:14.160
through every two minutes and that's a really good ratio compared to some of the boosts.

07:14.160 --> 07:18.520
I will say though, to Paxi's credit, there really was a focus on indie this year and

07:18.520 --> 07:21.880
that's always exciting to see and especially when the indie games themselves are getting

07:21.880 --> 07:24.960
a huge line of people to play even those games.

07:24.960 --> 07:30.120
I think we stood around for about 20, 30 minutes to play a game called Thumper, again because

07:30.120 --> 07:32.120
it was kind of a game that had a really long demo.

07:32.120 --> 07:38.440
It was by some former Harmonix devs, but I enjoyed the game and it was worth the wait

07:38.440 --> 07:40.720
so I don't have anything negative to say about that.

07:40.720 --> 07:47.720
But there was a lot of love for indie, although this could also be the fact that because GDC

07:47.720 --> 07:56.760
was going on the exact same week that we could not get more of a AAA presence at Penny

07:56.760 --> 07:57.760
Arcade Expo.

07:57.760 --> 08:03.560
I sort of like the shows where it's like a little of the AAA's, a little of the like

08:03.560 --> 08:05.880
A- and the Bs, and a little of the indies.

08:05.880 --> 08:14.200
It's a great harmonious mix of all of them and Pax East, Pax East I think was missing

08:14.200 --> 08:17.960
probably a few key players, probably because of the GDC thing.

08:17.960 --> 08:24.360
Now they've moved it out a month next year, which Pax East really needs to do.

08:24.360 --> 08:28.460
The snow thing and the weather, you know, I'm a West Coast guy and I get that a lot

08:28.460 --> 08:33.040
of you think I'm a big wimp and so forth, but that was pretty brutal, some of the weather

08:33.040 --> 08:34.960
while I was out there.

08:34.960 --> 08:39.480
And it doesn't really help for the travel, getting around, just all the snow on the side

08:39.480 --> 08:43.000
of the road and look out where you're walking because you might slip and fall in a puddle.

08:43.040 --> 08:47.240
So they're moving it back a month next year, probably to get out of GDC's way and so that

08:47.240 --> 08:50.680
snowmageddon can't happen to them again, which is good.

08:50.680 --> 08:53.600
Really good because yeah, the weather doesn't help that situation.

08:53.600 --> 08:58.240
And another thing that I have to admit kind of bothered me about Pax East and apologies

08:58.240 --> 09:03.440
to my friends who are out there in the Northeast and who live in Boston, but that convention

09:03.440 --> 09:09.860
center where they host Pax East at, man, that thing is a pain in the butt to get to travel-wise.

09:09.860 --> 09:14.000
And especially considering that Boston is a city that doesn't really have the greatest

09:14.000 --> 09:19.580
traffic to begin with, with all its streets that weren't really built for cars, right?

09:19.580 --> 09:20.980
It already is a mess to begin with.

09:20.980 --> 09:26.140
I mean, when you're waiting on the shuttle for an hour to get from your hotel to Pax,

09:26.140 --> 09:29.900
which honestly we probably should have just walked faster, but we didn't think it would

09:29.900 --> 09:32.140
be such a huge mess.

09:32.140 --> 09:36.420
I mean, it just kind of says something about what a cluster that whole thing was out there.

09:36.420 --> 09:39.980
So I actually liked it better when it was at the Heinz the first year that I went, even

09:39.980 --> 09:43.740
though I realized it was a smaller show.

09:43.740 --> 09:48.200
Here's the other thing that kind of, just to give you an idea where my mindset is at

09:48.200 --> 09:49.860
with Pax.

09:49.860 --> 09:54.220
I'm going to spill the tea on a little something and I'm going to be very honest and open about

09:54.220 --> 09:58.860
something that frustrated me greatly and I know frustrated Bobby greatly.

09:58.860 --> 10:03.160
And we've been dropping hints about this a little bit, but I'm going to tell you exactly

10:03.160 --> 10:08.960
what went down with Pax East and why we've been a little bit frustrated and the fact

10:08.960 --> 10:14.320
that the show was kind of a mess, for lack of a better term, doesn't exactly instill

10:14.320 --> 10:18.980
confidence that I want to go back next year.

10:18.980 --> 10:24.040
We were contacted about four months ago, Bobby and myself, to reprise a panel that we had

10:24.040 --> 10:29.940
done at Dragon Con on starting a network with some other independent broadcasters.

10:29.940 --> 10:35.600
So the point of this was to try and reprise this panel at Pax East, that this group was

10:35.600 --> 10:38.980
going to submit to actually do this panel at Pax East.

10:38.980 --> 10:40.060
Of course we were on board.

10:40.060 --> 10:41.620
It sounded very exciting.

10:41.620 --> 10:46.500
We love to enable more people to do independent broadcasting and start their own network and

10:46.500 --> 10:47.500
so on.

10:47.500 --> 10:49.820
So we said, sure, we'll do the panel.

10:49.820 --> 10:56.140
And Bobby and I were talking a little bit off this email conversation and, well, what

10:56.140 --> 10:57.780
if they don't pick up the panel?

10:57.780 --> 11:01.900
Because we don't have any, and I'm using my quotey fingers here, star power on this

11:01.900 --> 11:02.900
panel.

11:02.900 --> 11:08.600
So the realization is the odds are that the panel will get picked up is pretty low.

11:08.600 --> 11:13.700
But then we realized, well, okay, if we don't get into the show with this panel, then we

11:13.700 --> 11:17.700
can certainly get in as media because we broadcast from the show floor in 2008.

11:17.700 --> 11:18.700
We had that.

11:18.700 --> 11:22.140
We did our thing in 2010 and had fun at the show there.

11:22.140 --> 11:26.980
So we know that other podcasters that have got in as media and it's not a problem.

11:26.980 --> 11:28.820
We won't have a problem with that.

11:28.820 --> 11:33.100
So I booked my flight to Boston, Bobby got the hotel, and we're all ready to do Pax East.

11:33.100 --> 11:37.820
And of course, this is long after the general admission tickets had already sold out because

11:37.820 --> 11:41.820
you know, Pax sells out in 15 minutes, right?

11:41.820 --> 11:47.540
So Bobby and I find out that we didn't get the panel, which we kind of saw that coming

11:47.540 --> 11:48.540
unfortunately.

11:48.540 --> 11:49.540
We would love to do it again.

11:49.540 --> 11:50.540
But all right, it is what it is.

11:50.540 --> 11:55.840
They want to focus on these big AAA developers hosting their panels, even ones that don't

11:55.840 --> 11:59.260
have a booth on the show floor, at least they're showing up to do a panel so they give

11:59.260 --> 12:02.600
this panel space to these AAA developers, whatever, fine.

12:02.600 --> 12:08.960
So we decide to apply as media and we send them everything that they requested and we

12:08.960 --> 12:13.720
get a form letter denial that we do not meet the criteria to get in as media.

12:13.720 --> 12:17.200
What's interesting about this, Bobby and I submit our credentials together.

12:17.200 --> 12:22.760
Bobby gets the denial for media and then I get at the exact same time, even though my

12:22.760 --> 12:28.120
information was on page two, I get the exact same time, please submit your credentials.

12:28.120 --> 12:33.320
So I send them the exact same thing that had been sent before a week later, get denied.

12:33.320 --> 12:39.160
Both Bobby and I independently write to this email box to say, could we get more insight

12:39.160 --> 12:41.480
as to why we were denied?

12:41.480 --> 12:43.640
We meet the criteria.

12:43.640 --> 12:48.080
We're fortunate enough that, you know, if you look at Stitcher Top 100, we're one of

12:48.080 --> 12:52.640
the podcasts in there, very competitive with some offerings from like IGN and so forth.

12:52.640 --> 12:53.640
And that's all thanks to you guys.

12:53.640 --> 12:54.640
Thank you so much.

12:54.640 --> 13:00.160
But, you know, we feel like we have enough of a listenership to kind of justify that

13:00.160 --> 13:04.880
sort of access and keep this in mind because I don't want you guys to think, oh, this is

13:04.880 --> 13:11.220
Rob just bitching that, you know, he's on a podcast and podcasts aren't media anyway,

13:11.220 --> 13:13.800
because here's the other side to this.

13:13.800 --> 13:19.460
We have peers that we know are getting into the show as media and we know other people

13:19.460 --> 13:23.500
that have comparable listener bases and comparable, you know, stuff to us that are getting in

13:23.500 --> 13:24.500
as media.

13:24.500 --> 13:27.900
So we figure, well, if they're all getting in, then we shouldn't have a problem either.

13:27.900 --> 13:32.420
We'll just pick up the phone and call them like we do with E3 and explain it and that

13:32.420 --> 13:35.700
won't be a problem because that's exactly what happened with E3 last year.

13:35.700 --> 13:42.000
Unfortunately, no telephone number, no response to our email, nothing.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.780
We're not given a reason.

13:43.780 --> 13:45.600
We're not given an explanation.

13:45.600 --> 13:47.620
We're not given a chance to appeal.

13:47.620 --> 13:51.660
We're not given a live person to contact for this.

13:51.660 --> 13:55.980
Meanwhile, again, we talked to other podcasters.

13:55.980 --> 13:58.860
We know our peers are getting in.

13:58.860 --> 14:01.420
Our peers are getting emails answered.

14:01.420 --> 14:08.220
Our peers are finding a way to, I guess, get a live human being to respond to something.

14:08.220 --> 14:11.700
Again, Bobby and I had contacted independently.

14:11.700 --> 14:12.700
Are we being ignored?

14:12.700 --> 14:15.980
Yo, Pax, did I hurt your feelings?

14:15.980 --> 14:16.980
It would be nice to know.

14:17.340 --> 14:19.900
I mean, tell me, let's have a chat over coffee.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.820
Let's see if we can hug it out a little bit.

14:21.820 --> 14:28.460
I'd like to know because when you don't answer emails and you don't provide customer service,

14:28.460 --> 14:30.460
that comes off as unprofessional.

14:30.460 --> 14:34.360
Again, I want to reiterate this.

14:34.360 --> 14:36.020
This is very important.

14:36.020 --> 14:38.900
I am not complaining that I didn't get a media pass.

14:38.900 --> 14:45.620
I am totally fine with that if the rules are consistent.

14:45.620 --> 14:51.420
I believe I've presented enough examples here where I'm showing that it was not consistent.

14:51.420 --> 14:55.640
That's what frustrates me greatly is that it was not consistent.

14:55.640 --> 15:00.980
We weren't even given the cordial reply of, if they had replied back and said, sorry,

15:00.980 --> 15:03.920
we were looking for X, you have Y, then you know what?

15:03.920 --> 15:06.500
As long as I had my chance to kind of make my case and so forth that they were going

15:06.500 --> 15:08.940
to stick with it, then fine, it is what it is.

15:08.940 --> 15:15.380
Even though this is the same show where we were broadcasting from the show floor in 2008,

15:15.380 --> 15:16.900
apparently it was media then.

15:16.900 --> 15:22.180
With a much smaller listenership at that time, I'm assuming as well.

15:22.180 --> 15:23.580
Right?

15:23.580 --> 15:28.980
So anyway, that left a sour taste in my mouth, which you probably could tell over the past

15:28.980 --> 15:30.500
couple of weeks in the show.

15:30.500 --> 15:31.500
But you know what?

15:31.500 --> 15:32.500
Damn it.

15:32.500 --> 15:36.220
I knew there were people that were going to the show that I wanted to see, and one of

15:36.220 --> 15:40.700
our listeners, Hitstun Awesome, came through for us because I was getting ready to cancel

15:40.700 --> 15:41.700
the flight.

15:41.700 --> 15:42.700
And he said, you know what?

15:42.700 --> 15:46.660
I have these extra passes and I'm more than happy to sell them to you at face value and

15:46.660 --> 15:47.780
you can go to the show.

15:47.780 --> 15:52.680
I wouldn't play in that scalping game, but our listeners are good enough to not be scalpers.

15:52.680 --> 15:57.300
So I decided, you know what, fine, I will pay the money to get these tickets and I'll

15:57.300 --> 15:58.300
go to the show.

15:58.300 --> 16:00.900
I flew out there on my own dollar and all this stuff.

16:00.900 --> 16:02.780
You know, it is an independent pilot.

16:02.780 --> 16:10.180
There's no first class jet or expense, you know, it's my money I used to fly out there

16:10.180 --> 16:15.580
and I'm telling you, I don't see a reason ever again to spend that kind of money to

16:15.580 --> 16:17.500
go to a show like that.

16:17.500 --> 16:21.540
The lone exception being that I could see my friends again.

16:21.540 --> 16:26.700
However, I have a pretty good suspicion that if I go to some different cons out on the

16:26.700 --> 16:30.900
East Coast, such as Dragon Con, which I will continue to support.

16:30.900 --> 16:35.020
Dragon Con is kind of its own thing because Dragon Con isn't an expo so much as it is

16:35.020 --> 16:39.180
a convention and it's like 20 small conventions all taking place at the same time.

16:39.180 --> 16:42.420
And Dragon Con replies to their emails, so that's one thing.

16:42.420 --> 16:44.500
You know, I'll continue to do stuff with that.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.700
I'm very interested in doing MAGFest next year.

16:46.700 --> 16:50.260
I love the Rockage event out here on the West Coast, so I'm looking forward very much to

16:50.260 --> 16:51.540
doing MAGFest on the East Coast.

16:51.540 --> 16:55.700
I want to do that next time and I think I'll get to see a lot of the OLR and VOG people

16:55.700 --> 16:56.700
out there, so that's fine.

16:56.700 --> 17:00.180
But as far as PAX goes, kind of done.

17:00.180 --> 17:04.720
And I just, again, while we're spilling tea, can I just say one more thing here?

17:04.720 --> 17:10.000
There's a lot of perception out there that, well, what does that media access get you,

17:10.000 --> 17:11.160
Rob Roberts?

17:11.160 --> 17:13.240
Why do you even care about the media access?

17:13.240 --> 17:18.220
Because PAX is the show where media is treated no differently than the general public, save

17:18.220 --> 17:21.960
maybe they get to go on the expo floor one hour sooner.

17:21.960 --> 17:23.780
Wrong!

17:23.780 --> 17:25.840
That is wrong!

17:25.840 --> 17:29.000
That changed quietly a few years ago.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
Y'all didn't notice.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.000
Oh, when did that change?

17:31.000 --> 17:36.640
Well, about the time that Penny Arcade outsourced that expo to that new vendor who runs it on

17:36.640 --> 17:43.480
their behalf and has expanded it into a brand that runs PAX South and now PAX Australia,

17:43.480 --> 17:51.160
the brand that cannot be bothered to reply to emails.

17:51.160 --> 17:56.360
There are appointments to be made at Boos to see games that are not out on the floor

17:56.360 --> 17:57.600
for the general public.

17:57.600 --> 18:01.880
There are things being shown in hotel rooms, much like they are at E3, that, again, cannot

18:01.880 --> 18:03.520
be seen with the general public.

18:03.520 --> 18:09.020
If you think that PAX is this open, I get to see everything there, sorry, that changed

18:09.020 --> 18:10.620
a few years ago.

18:10.620 --> 18:14.740
But I do think it's still cool that PAX has a lot of board games and card games and bring

18:14.740 --> 18:18.120
your own computer and other stuff that kind of mixes it up a little bit.

18:18.120 --> 18:24.760
But as far as the bang for my buck, I'm spending it elsewhere in the future.

18:24.760 --> 18:26.720
Did you want to ask me anything about PAX East, Loki?

18:26.720 --> 18:29.040
Did you get to play Rock Band?

18:29.040 --> 18:30.360
No, they didn't bring it.

18:30.360 --> 18:31.360
They didn't have it.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.360
How's Amplitude?

18:32.360 --> 18:33.680
Amplitude was fun.

18:33.680 --> 18:34.680
I liked it.

18:34.680 --> 18:35.680
It was good.

18:35.680 --> 18:36.680
It was a good time.

18:36.680 --> 18:40.960
I played a lot of music games because there was Thumper, Kyle Ward was there showing off

18:40.960 --> 18:44.960
what he's doing on the Android tablets with DittoBeat and Rerave Plus.

18:44.960 --> 18:46.600
He's going to come on the show next month, by the way.

18:46.600 --> 18:47.800
I'm very excited to have him.

18:47.800 --> 18:53.580
He's a longtime music game community guy, and we got to talk and dish a little bit about

18:53.620 --> 18:57.660
some of the things going on, and he is going to absolutely come on the show and promote

18:57.660 --> 18:59.020
that stuff in the future.

18:59.020 --> 19:00.020
So looking forward to that.

19:00.020 --> 19:01.020
Cool.

19:01.020 --> 19:02.020
Yep.

19:02.020 --> 19:04.540
So anyway, that's my little story about PAX East.

19:04.540 --> 19:08.340
Otherwise, there are some other little things that were kind of fun, like I enjoyed going

19:08.340 --> 19:13.380
to the classic game room and getting Bobby Blackwolf to play the guardian legend for

19:13.380 --> 19:14.380
the first time.

19:14.380 --> 19:15.380
That was a lot of fun.

19:15.380 --> 19:20.140
And just getting to play Kid Icarus on a Nintendo with an NES controller.

19:20.140 --> 19:23.860
I haven't done that in a very long time because I don't have a working Nintendo.

19:23.860 --> 19:28.020
So yeah, it was awesome to get to do that all over again.

19:28.020 --> 19:29.020
And again, see people.

19:29.020 --> 19:32.620
You know, we got to go to dinner one night with a couple people from VoG, and that was

19:32.620 --> 19:33.620
really cool.

19:33.620 --> 19:38.820
SSG100Matt, whose girlfriend lives out in the area, knows Boston very well, took us

19:38.820 --> 19:42.620
out to Harvard, and we went to a brewery over there, and that was a lot of fun.

19:42.620 --> 19:48.220
In fact, SSG100Matt is in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com saying, the first PAX

19:48.220 --> 19:49.420
East wasn't bad.

19:49.420 --> 19:51.980
I still like that more than the previous ones.

19:51.980 --> 19:57.060
Me too, I had a great time at the first PAX East, but again, that was before they outsourced

19:57.060 --> 20:00.100
it, but anyway.

20:00.100 --> 20:04.340
Let's see, over at live.vognetwork.com, YYR says, Magfest will definitely get the bad

20:04.340 --> 20:06.060
taste out of your mouth.

20:06.060 --> 20:08.460
And SSG100Matt saying, Magfest is where it's at.

20:08.460 --> 20:10.460
I can't praise it enough.

20:10.460 --> 20:13.300
So yeah, it seems like people are loving that.

20:13.300 --> 20:17.220
And Kaijuto saying, Dragon Con has real dragon transportation.

20:17.220 --> 20:22.180
Yeah, well Dragon Con's a lot easier to get around because they hold it downtown at all

20:22.180 --> 20:25.540
these different hotels, they're all interconnected, and even if they're not, there's a lot of

20:25.540 --> 20:26.540
shuttle service.

20:26.540 --> 20:29.740
I don't hear about a lot of these same problems at Dragon Con.

20:29.740 --> 20:35.380
So Dragon Con will be like the one big show that I do here, but from now on, I totally

20:35.380 --> 20:42.820
plan to focus on more like small and mid-level gaming expos, where there's more to do.

20:42.900 --> 20:48.300
Just to put this in perspective, I played more games, actual games.

20:48.300 --> 20:54.180
I got my hands on more games at Rockage in San Jose, which was one, actually, I was there

20:54.180 --> 20:55.220
for only one day.

20:55.220 --> 20:56.220
That event was multiple days.

20:56.220 --> 21:00.900
I was there for one day and played more games than I did the three days at PAX East.

21:00.900 --> 21:02.980
Just food for thought.

21:02.980 --> 21:08.060
Anyhow, I'm not just here to bitch and complain, but a lot of you guys have been asking me

21:08.060 --> 21:12.460
questions about what's going on, why have you been subtly side-eyeing this whole thing?

21:12.460 --> 21:13.460
So there it is.

21:13.460 --> 21:14.900
I've laid it all out on the table.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.900
Take what you will from it.

21:16.900 --> 21:22.900
I will, to turn this into a positive, though, before the show tonight, getting into housekeeping

21:22.900 --> 21:28.120
a little bit here as well, before the show tonight, Bobby and I and Loki made some announcements

21:28.120 --> 21:29.660
about what's going on with VOG Network.

21:29.660 --> 21:34.860
So first off, great news, we'd like to welcome the Geek Card to VOG Network, yay, hosted

21:34.860 --> 21:42.060
by Razorbug, Rob, and Sil over in the UK about various things in geek culture, video games,

21:42.060 --> 21:45.660
television and so forth, so get your Geek Card stamped with them every week, so welcome

21:45.660 --> 21:46.780
then to the network.

21:46.780 --> 21:51.340
And we also talked about how we're not doing E3 this year, for very similar reasons that

21:51.340 --> 21:56.820
I've just vented to you about with PAX, E3's also going down this whole of, why am I going

21:56.820 --> 22:02.800
to spend all this money to go to E3 just to maybe have appointments, maybe, if I'm lucky

22:02.800 --> 22:09.220
and I beg, and we can make people understand what a podcast is, even though cereal is huge

22:09.220 --> 22:10.220
right now.

22:10.220 --> 22:15.300
If we can get an appointment to see the exact same thing that they're streaming on Twitch

22:15.300 --> 22:21.780
TV at 3 o'clock, you know, I just, I'm not sure the money is justified to spend to go

22:21.780 --> 22:29.060
to something like E3 when that is money that we could spend to get table space at a medium

22:29.060 --> 22:36.420
or small convention like GamerX, like Magfest, like, you know, something else.

22:36.420 --> 22:38.900
California Stream I get to go to this year, I don't know if we're doing anything with

22:38.900 --> 22:42.820
that yet, but maybe, I hope to, I'm going to ask that question.

22:42.820 --> 22:46.860
One other exciting announcement, I'm very excited about this because this is a local

22:46.860 --> 22:51.140
organization, but they're doing things on an international scale, and that is the Sacramento

22:51.140 --> 22:56.260
branch of the International Game Developers Association, and the Sac IGDA is actually

22:56.260 --> 23:04.300
hosting an event here locally on April 11th, and we are going to be broadcasting from that

23:04.300 --> 23:10.140
event live all day from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., actually going to be broadcasting from that,

23:10.140 --> 23:12.660
and you guys will be able to ask questions with some of the developers that we'll be

23:12.660 --> 23:17.260
sitting down with, and you might think, well, oh, if it's Sacramento, then I don't live

23:17.260 --> 23:23.420
there, am I, well, these games are all games that are trying to get noticed more on a national

23:23.420 --> 23:27.500
scale so they can be distributed on things like DeSoura, as some of them are actually

23:27.500 --> 23:33.580
getting exposure on, and, you know, other national platforms, so it's not like, you

23:33.580 --> 23:36.900
know, in this day and age of the internet, you won't be able to check out a lot of these

23:36.900 --> 23:41.340
games for yourself that we're actually going to be talking about on the show, on that live

23:41.340 --> 23:42.340
broadcast.

23:42.340 --> 23:49.860
So VOG Network with us from OLR will be broadcasting from the Sacramento Indie Arcade Gaming Expo

23:49.860 --> 23:54.220
at the Colonial Cafe in the colony next door on Saturday, April 11th.

23:54.220 --> 23:58.380
If you happen to be local in the area, you should probably come on down and say hello.

23:58.380 --> 24:01.100
So that was, that's something very exciting to announce.

24:01.100 --> 24:08.660
You see, see, and I, I bet, I bet we'll talk to 10 times as many developers at that than

24:08.660 --> 24:16.940
I have at any other show, and I have to spend $5 on gas to get over there.

24:16.940 --> 24:17.940
If that.

24:17.940 --> 24:19.780
Isn't that a better use of money?

24:19.780 --> 24:20.780
I think so.

24:20.780 --> 24:22.620
So I'm excited about that.

24:22.620 --> 24:25.660
Loki, you were already talking about going to this and then all of a sudden it's, hey,

24:25.660 --> 24:26.660
guess what?

24:26.660 --> 24:28.260
We're going to be, we're going to be broadcasting from it.

24:28.260 --> 24:30.340
Uh, hopefully I can still go to it.

24:30.380 --> 24:31.380
I'm hoping I can.

24:31.380 --> 24:32.380
No, I'm hoping you can too.

24:32.380 --> 24:33.700
It won't be the same without you.

24:33.700 --> 24:35.220
So, all right.

24:35.220 --> 24:36.220
Anyhow.

24:36.220 --> 24:37.220
Uh, there you go.

24:37.220 --> 24:40.780
That's, that's our housekeeping and, and everything we're going to talk about at the top of the

24:40.780 --> 24:44.620
show, except of course, how we always start off the show here at Orange Launch Radio,

24:44.620 --> 24:47.140
talking out a little bit about our gaming weeks.

24:47.140 --> 24:48.340
Loki, how was your gaming week?

24:48.340 --> 24:50.940
Uh, my gaming week was, I didn't play really anything.

24:50.940 --> 24:52.060
I was just been working on my game.

24:52.060 --> 24:53.060
In fact, it's weird.

24:53.060 --> 24:58.820
I had a bug creep up on me that I've already had fixed, so I'm not sure how it came back

24:58.820 --> 25:02.820
and even looking at the code, it doesn't make any sense because it should work and

25:02.820 --> 25:05.140
yet it's not working.

25:05.140 --> 25:07.660
So I'm trying to figure out why that is.

25:07.660 --> 25:12.620
Well, if you can ever finish a darn game that you work on, Loki, maybe you can join the

25:12.620 --> 25:16.020
SAC IJCA and maybe show at the show.

25:16.020 --> 25:17.020
Wouldn't that be something?

25:17.020 --> 25:20.500
Uh, you might miss the deadline for the submissions, but maybe next year.

25:20.500 --> 25:21.500
Nope.

25:21.500 --> 25:22.740
Figured it out what it is just now.

25:22.740 --> 25:25.620
We just now, wait, you just, you squashed a bug in your head as you were complaining

25:25.620 --> 25:26.620
about it?

25:26.620 --> 25:31.380
I'm hitting the collider that's on the car that I put there because I replaced the colliders

25:31.380 --> 25:37.460
on there and so I don't have it on a masking layer and so it's hitting the car's own collider

25:37.460 --> 25:39.740
and that's why it thinks it's still on the ground.

25:39.740 --> 25:41.740
Ah, I'm so stupid.

25:41.740 --> 25:44.180
Anyways, but that'll be fixed today.

25:44.180 --> 25:48.380
No, but really the whole thing I was working on this week was getting the car model they

25:48.380 --> 25:53.420
had was originally this kind of stand-in thing and now I have an actual car model on there

25:53.420 --> 25:55.860
and it looks fancy and everything.

25:56.540 --> 26:00.340
It matches the style of the game and what else did I do?

26:00.340 --> 26:01.820
That was pretty much it.

26:01.820 --> 26:03.220
I was just really tired this week.

26:03.220 --> 26:07.380
A lot of it was trying to catch up on sleep and I got really distracted by CinemaSins

26:07.380 --> 26:08.380
this week.

26:08.380 --> 26:14.740
I watched way too many of those videos, but mostly because I was so tired I couldn't concentrate

26:14.740 --> 26:20.660
to work on stuff and so I just, I don't know, I just kind of slacked off a little bit.

26:20.660 --> 26:27.220
I played a little bit of LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, but less than a minute, just very

26:27.220 --> 26:28.220
little.

26:28.220 --> 26:31.140
And I really meant to play DJ Hero this week.

26:31.140 --> 26:36.260
I just, once again, too lazy to go dig out the turntables in the other room and set up

26:36.260 --> 26:41.620
my Xbox 360 because it's not currently set up and finding the disc, wherever the hell

26:41.620 --> 26:43.860
that is.

26:43.860 --> 26:47.500
So yeah, but I want to.

26:47.500 --> 26:51.860
I still want to play that and maybe something on my Steam library, I've been kind of digging

26:51.860 --> 26:52.860
through that a little bit.

26:52.860 --> 26:53.860
I don't know.

26:53.860 --> 26:55.500
It's just been kind of slacking off a week.

26:55.500 --> 26:56.980
Hopefully it'll be a little more productive.

26:56.980 --> 27:01.020
Well, if you've been working on the game, you know, working on a game is likely.

27:01.020 --> 27:05.460
My goal was trying to have, you know, the game at least another level built and I still

27:05.460 --> 27:07.260
very well can have another level built.

27:07.260 --> 27:11.740
I'm just kind of tweaking the car a bit just to make sure that it works fine because in

27:11.740 --> 27:16.180
order to make the other levels, I have to basically duplicate this start level that

27:16.180 --> 27:18.300
I have and then change stuff in it.

27:18.300 --> 27:22.520
And if I make a change to something outside of that, then I've got to change it in every

27:22.520 --> 27:24.260
single level that I make afterwards.

27:24.260 --> 27:30.300
And it's just better to get all of those things fixed first and then do, you know, do the

27:30.300 --> 27:31.300
car stuff.

27:31.300 --> 27:33.460
But I don't know.

27:33.460 --> 27:35.660
That's it.

27:35.660 --> 27:38.500
Anything that you think you might get to play in the next week?

27:38.500 --> 27:40.760
Well, the game's quite playable.

27:40.760 --> 27:43.400
My son played it for a good 20 minutes today.

27:43.400 --> 27:48.160
I just, you know, I have to jump on past, you know, one of the checkpoints, basically

27:48.160 --> 27:50.060
a game breaking bug.

27:50.060 --> 27:55.200
And so I get him past that little ring and he can drive around with however he wants

27:55.200 --> 27:57.320
and it works just fine.

27:57.320 --> 27:58.780
So that was the thing.

27:58.780 --> 28:00.960
So he's been playing with that and it works.

28:00.960 --> 28:02.960
I don't know.

28:02.960 --> 28:04.380
All right.

28:04.380 --> 28:06.320
So I'll just work on a little more.

28:06.320 --> 28:10.400
I'm, since I didn't get a level done this week, that means I got to get two done next

28:10.400 --> 28:11.400
week.

28:11.400 --> 28:12.400
All right.

28:12.400 --> 28:15.200
Well, my gaming week, you know, I talked about some of the stuff I played at PAX already.

28:15.200 --> 28:21.620
So outside of the expo, of course, I did a little playing of like Theatrhythm and Fantasy

28:21.620 --> 28:26.360
Life on the flight and those good old standby 3DS games, right?

28:26.360 --> 28:29.560
And then when I got home, I've been playing some of the usual stuff, Diablo 3, because

28:29.560 --> 28:31.720
Alan is still super into Diablo 3.

28:31.720 --> 28:34.120
He's like Paragon 350 plus at this point, I think.

28:34.120 --> 28:35.120
I don't know.

28:35.120 --> 28:36.120
I'd have to ask him.

28:36.120 --> 28:38.680
But I know that doesn't mean anything to you, Loki, but that's a lot.

28:38.680 --> 28:40.960
That's like 350 levels in a game.

28:40.960 --> 28:41.960
That's a lot.

28:41.960 --> 28:42.960
That's a lot.

28:42.960 --> 28:44.540
But, you know, it's what he loves doing right now.

28:44.540 --> 28:45.540
So that's cool.

28:45.540 --> 28:48.640
I'm up to Paragon 140, I think at this point.

28:48.640 --> 28:53.120
So I'm lagging behind a little bit, but I'm able to run Torment 6's with him and stay

28:53.120 --> 28:54.120
alive with my move.

28:54.120 --> 28:57.760
So are they like, does the difficulty ramp up as you level up or you just become all

28:57.760 --> 29:00.440
godlike and just be able to like squash anything?

29:00.440 --> 29:05.040
Well, the set difficulties in the game are like, you know, like normal, master, hard,

29:05.040 --> 29:07.360
like all the way up through Torment 6.

29:07.360 --> 29:11.480
And you do get to a point where even in Torment 6, you're pretty much face rolling a lot of

29:11.480 --> 29:12.480
the rifts and all this.

29:12.480 --> 29:13.840
But here's what happened.

29:13.840 --> 29:19.960
Here's what happens is that when you beat a rift, most of the time you'll get what's

29:19.960 --> 29:20.960
called a keystone.

29:20.960 --> 29:24.220
And that keystone allows you to enter a greater rift.

29:24.220 --> 29:28.480
And the greater rift starts with a trial where you just fight these mobs over and over again.

29:28.480 --> 29:32.480
They get harder and harder and harder and they respawn in these different waves.

29:32.480 --> 29:39.000
And if you get to about wave 25, you're running the equivalent of a Torment 6.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.800
But the numbers go higher than 25.

29:40.800 --> 29:43.600
In fact, I believe they go all the way up to 50, maybe 60.

29:43.600 --> 29:44.600
I don't know.

29:44.600 --> 29:46.120
This is probably more of an Alan question.

29:46.120 --> 29:48.880
Maybe he's listening and can run out here and tell me.

29:48.880 --> 29:53.520
So once you get the keystone, then you actually run a rift at that level.

29:53.520 --> 29:57.280
So let me tell you, even though like Alan is that level I told you he's at, he's still

29:57.280 --> 30:00.160
banging his head on, I think Torment 37 right now.

30:00.160 --> 30:04.000
So there's still a lot of room for him to grow beyond what he's doing.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.160
So that's kind of what the end game ends up being.

30:06.160 --> 30:08.680
But I mean, it is still Diablo.

30:08.680 --> 30:09.740
It's a dungeon crawler.

30:09.740 --> 30:11.160
It's a click loot fest.

30:11.160 --> 30:13.360
But there's something very zen about it.

30:13.360 --> 30:14.360
Just sitting down and playing.

30:14.360 --> 30:16.720
And then, you know, you get to play with friends and you get more experience when you play

30:16.720 --> 30:17.860
with friends and so forth.

30:17.860 --> 30:18.860
So that's exciting.

30:18.860 --> 30:23.720
I tried playing Clicker Heroes this week just to see because I haven't looked at it in months

30:23.720 --> 30:25.960
and it won't even open anymore.

30:25.960 --> 30:26.960
What?

30:26.960 --> 30:28.400
Yeah, it won't even open on my computer.

30:28.400 --> 30:29.400
Oh no.

30:29.640 --> 30:33.640
I was like, okay, well I guess I'm done with that.

30:33.640 --> 30:37.920
Um, let's see, anyway, um, what was I going to say?

30:37.920 --> 30:43.120
Outside of Diablo 3, also a little more Final Fantasy XIV, because I didn't even mention

30:43.120 --> 30:44.860
we did this at Penny Arcade Expo.

30:44.860 --> 30:49.560
The one panel we did stand in a line to get in a line, even though you're not supposed

30:49.560 --> 30:53.400
to do that, everyone does it anyway, but we stood in a line to get into the line to get

30:53.400 --> 30:58.440
into the Final Fantasy XIV panel where they showed all the information about the expansion,

30:58.480 --> 31:03.720
all the new outfits for the different jobs, and announced the release date of June 23rd.

31:03.720 --> 31:06.520
Our birthday, here at OLR, so how appropriate, right?

31:06.520 --> 31:09.840
So Heavens War, the expansion's coming out June 23rd.

31:09.840 --> 31:12.840
So we actually did that panel.

31:12.840 --> 31:16.280
So of course it kind of got me a little more enthused for Final Fantasy XIV, so I came

31:16.280 --> 31:18.160
home and I played a lot of that as well.

31:18.160 --> 31:22.980
But I did play new stuff, guys, in fact I played a game that I really should have played

31:22.980 --> 31:27.920
three months ago, four months ago, when it was first free on PlayStation Plus, and I

31:27.920 --> 31:30.120
downloaded it, and I really should have played it then.

31:30.120 --> 31:34.160
I don't know why I didn't, I just, probably game overload, or I was sucked into my MMOs

31:34.160 --> 31:35.160
or something.

31:35.160 --> 31:39.440
But Flaco Jones had told me about four or five different times, Rob, you need to play

31:39.440 --> 31:41.800
Velocity 2X, you need to play this game.

31:41.800 --> 31:45.040
So finally, I decided to sit down and play it this week.

31:45.040 --> 31:50.020
I think his most recent tweet yelling at me about this finally resonated in my head.

31:50.020 --> 31:53.920
So I went in and I played the game, and I love it.

31:53.920 --> 31:55.400
It's so, it's great.

31:55.400 --> 31:59.880
It's like, you know, and Flaco was saying that I would really like it because every

31:59.880 --> 32:03.320
time I talk about the Guardian Legend and how it's like half a shooter game, half like

32:03.320 --> 32:07.780
a Zelda adventure exploration game, he's like, that's Velocity, you need to play Velocity.

32:07.780 --> 32:12.480
And it kind of is, I mean, Velocity definitely has the shooter, and more like a side-scrolling

32:12.480 --> 32:19.700
platformer, whereas, whereas Guardian Legend is more like a Zelda slash shooter, I would

32:19.700 --> 32:24.960
say Velocity is more like a Rayman slash shooter type of thing, but definitely encourages and

32:25.000 --> 32:30.000
embraces speedrunning because, you know, it's, at the end of each level, of which I think

32:30.000 --> 32:33.360
there's 50 levels in the game, at the end of each level, you're evaluated and you get

32:33.360 --> 32:38.360
a medal on how fast did you do it, how many of the possible survivor capsules did you

32:38.360 --> 32:42.920
pick up, how many of the possible crystals did you pick up, and how much out of the total

32:42.920 --> 32:46.960
possible score did you get by killing every monster that's in the level and so forth.

32:46.960 --> 32:53.220
So you get evaluated on all that, and if you want a perfect, which of course, if you obsess

32:53.220 --> 32:58.620
over not missing anything in your games like I do, then you obsess about getting a perfect,

32:58.620 --> 33:01.980
but if you want a perfect medal, you gotta do all those things at the same time in one

33:01.980 --> 33:07.820
run-through. Get a very fast time and collect everything. So it really, like, presents a

33:07.820 --> 33:13.740
challenge, and, you know, it's a good-looking game, even though the graphics don't exactly

33:13.740 --> 33:16.900
push the envelope of the PlayStation 4, it's probably the type of game that could have

33:16.900 --> 33:19.980
been on PlayStation 3, in fact, I believe it is, and there's probably not much of a

33:19.980 --> 33:24.380
difference between PS3 and PS4 versions. Still, at the end of the day, it's about

33:24.380 --> 33:29.460
fun, and the graphic style suits the game, and it's a lot of fun. I go back and I play

33:29.460 --> 33:35.140
levels over and over to try to better my score, and the soundtrack is so good. The soundtrack

33:35.140 --> 33:41.860
is, like, Commodore 64-influenced. So, like, again, credit to you, Flaco Jones, because

33:41.860 --> 33:45.220
like three or four months ago, you were telling me, Rob, this is like a perfect game for you,

33:45.220 --> 33:49.300
why are you not playing this game? And he was right. He was right. I don't know why

33:49.300 --> 33:53.180
I didn't. Just sometimes, sometimes you're like, oh, but no new games right now, because

33:53.180 --> 33:57.820
I got to get my palette into max level and 14. But I'm so happy I checked out Velocity

33:57.820 --> 34:01.460
2X. That's a lot of fun, and I'll probably be playing that more in the coming weeks.

34:01.460 --> 34:05.620
So, if you didn't pick up that game on PlayStation Plus, I would say it's still worth your money

34:05.620 --> 34:11.740
to check it out. So, that was my gaming week. Since we already went through our housekeeping

34:11.740 --> 34:16.140
notes for the night, I will mention we are on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R. We're

34:16.140 --> 34:20.340
on Facebook and Google Plus as well. Facebook dot com slash Orange Lounge Radio. Google

34:20.340 --> 34:26.380
dot com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio. Let's get into some gaming news. Usually, we would

34:26.380 --> 34:32.140
do like a last week's news set to Holic, but there was kind of a few big stories that require

34:32.140 --> 34:35.900
a little more attention. So, let's get into some highlights from last week, Loki.

34:35.900 --> 34:39.580
So, the big one, which we kind of knew was going to happen, or at least thought it would

34:39.580 --> 34:44.260
happen was Rock Band 4 was announced, and they announced it for PlayStation 4 and Xbox

34:44.260 --> 34:52.820
One. Haven't really slated exactly when it's going to be coming out, but looks pretty awesome.

34:52.820 --> 34:58.060
It's got a new set of instruments, which honestly look just like the old set of instruments,

34:58.060 --> 35:06.940
but I don't know. Apparently, though, they are looking at trying to take the support

35:06.940 --> 35:11.740
that you had, because a lot of people really were into Rock Band on Xbox 360 and PlayStation

35:11.740 --> 35:17.700
3, and so they're having ways that you can import your songs that you bought on PlayStation

35:17.700 --> 35:26.300
3 or Xbox 360 to your consoles. I'm hoping that that's cross platform, but I don't think

35:26.300 --> 35:30.860
so. I think it's Xbox 360 to Xbox One. No, I think they even said in an FAQ, it's

35:30.860 --> 35:35.260
not cross platform because of the rules of the different stores, which, yeah, I think

35:35.260 --> 35:41.460
you, me, a lot of people are sitting out there going, Rock Band 4 might have just sold me

35:41.460 --> 35:47.740
an Xbox One. I know that's where I'm at. Not that I didn't want one anyway. I already

35:47.740 --> 35:52.400
wanted an Xbox One for other reasons, but now I'm sitting here going, yeah, by the time

35:52.400 --> 35:57.180
Rock Band 4 comes out, I'm going to need an Xbox One, because I'm not losing that library

35:57.180 --> 36:02.140
of songs. Yeah, exactly. And the other thing, too, is that there's supposed to be maybe

36:02.140 --> 36:08.780
support for the old instruments as well. I hope so, because damn, I have a full set of

36:08.780 --> 36:12.720
instruments on the Xbox 360, and that's kind of the thing with me. It's like, I don't play

36:12.720 --> 36:19.820
a ton of Rock Band right now, or pretty much at all anymore, and I am not buying another

36:19.820 --> 36:24.920
set of instruments for Rock Band 4. So, I hope that that's the case, because otherwise

36:24.920 --> 36:28.860
I probably just won't pick it up. I think they said that they're trying solutions right

36:28.860 --> 36:31.180
now. They don't have a definitive answer, but they're working on it. I would be fine

36:31.180 --> 36:35.380
with like a third party mod type situation where, you know, you have some sort of devices

36:35.380 --> 36:39.060
that allow it to run on other consoles or something like that. Yeah, YYR summarizes

36:39.060 --> 36:43.380
it in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com, saying, controller compatibility is not guaranteed,

36:43.380 --> 36:47.700
but they said they're looking into it. ActDeft was some very strong words here, saying, Rock

36:47.700 --> 36:53.500
Band 4 defined what next gen console I'm getting. Xbox One for me now. So, very interesting

36:53.500 --> 37:00.140
that this is the game that is going to cement the next gen for a lot of people. Yeah. Microsoft

37:00.140 --> 37:05.300
should be like, not only has Harmonix really been supporting the Kinect, when like, literally

37:05.300 --> 37:10.540
nobody else has, like, Microsoft should be sending Harmonix a dozen roses every day.

37:10.540 --> 37:16.220
I mean, really. And chocolates. And like, whatever they want. A pony. And then fortunately

37:16.220 --> 37:23.180
there will not be an Xbox, or a Wii U version of that game, because EA, I'm assuming is

37:23.180 --> 37:28.620
publishing it again, and EA fucking hates the Wii U, so, sorry. No Rock Band on the

37:28.620 --> 37:34.540
Wii U. Well, are they necessarily publishing it? There's no... I don't think anything's

37:34.540 --> 37:37.620
been said on that. I don't think anything's been said, but... There's also no MTV Games

37:37.620 --> 37:40.820
in the picture anymore, so a lot could be different. I would be willing to bet that

37:40.820 --> 37:45.380
EA is probably publishing that. Alright. That'd be interesting to see. I mean, I'm guessing.

37:45.380 --> 37:51.740
I don't know who else would be. Maybe Self. Who knows? They could do it. No. I doubt it.

37:51.740 --> 37:57.280
Well, we'll see. We'll see. But, well, I think also just the mere fact is, if they're developing

37:57.280 --> 38:05.480
it for next gen, Wii U runs on current gen, right? Or are they doing Rock Band 4 on Playstation

38:05.480 --> 38:11.840
3 and Xbox 360 as well? Well, the question was, you know, why not on Wii or Wii U or

38:11.840 --> 38:16.640
PC? It says due to shifting production priorities and capabilities of studios, we don't currently

38:16.640 --> 38:21.200
have any plans to release Rock Band 4 on the Wii or Wii U or PC simultaneously with Xbox

38:21.200 --> 38:29.240
1 and Playstation 4. Bobby in our chat room is clarifying that EA doesn't publish Rock

38:29.240 --> 38:34.120
Band 3 anymore. Mad Catz publishes it now. There's no EA splash screen anymore. And act

38:34.120 --> 38:38.120
deaf to jumping in saying Mad Catz is doing it as well. Oh, that's right. They make the

38:38.120 --> 38:42.280
instruments, so. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. They had that whole thing. I am a little sad

38:42.280 --> 38:47.040
that they eliminated keyboards. I, you know, I think we all saw it coming, so I can't like

38:47.040 --> 38:52.360
be upset, and I don't want to be one of those gamershateeverything.com types of people,

38:52.360 --> 38:57.600
but yeah, I'm still a little sad. Especially if the old tracks are gonna work. Like, it'd

38:57.600 --> 39:02.400
be nice. It'd be nice. It'd be nice just to have that support there, not necessarily new

39:02.400 --> 39:06.480
songs supporting it, but like the old songs would be nice. Yeah, that's, I would like

39:06.480 --> 39:11.320
to see that as well, but. But why put it in if you're not gonna support it in new songs?

39:11.320 --> 39:16.320
Keyboards clearly did not do too well, but this, I just, I am expressing my grievance.

39:16.320 --> 39:21.040
I would like it to be aired, and that's that. So, we'll move on and just hope there are

39:21.040 --> 39:24.160
other exciting things. I think it's cool that it's coming out. Just, you know, once again,

39:24.160 --> 39:29.280
I'm kind of, I'm a little over the whole like, ooh, it's a music game, gotta pick it up and

39:29.280 --> 39:34.200
support it. Now it's like, yeah, I've supported it enough with all the crap that's in my garage

39:34.200 --> 39:38.880
and on my, you know, Xbox 360. Well, I mean, they really, I mean, besides the fact that

39:38.880 --> 39:42.840
they've said it's coming, we really haven't seen anything about it. We don't have a screenshot

39:42.840 --> 39:46.360
at all. We don't really have anything else to go off of. So, but I mean, that's, that's

39:46.360 --> 39:49.720
also a good thing because that means there might be new play modes and new things in

39:49.720 --> 39:54.000
the game. And I've, I've talked about on the show before how I think social and this new

39:54.000 --> 39:57.440
day and age of social gaming we live in is gonna really drive Rock Band 4. We don't know

39:57.440 --> 40:01.000
any of that stuff. And I imagine that's what they're keeping in their hat until E3 that

40:01.000 --> 40:06.100
they can put out there on the Twitch stream or by appointment, you know. We will see more

40:06.100 --> 40:11.640
information about what's happening with that. Yeah. So I'm sure it'll be at E3. I'm sure

40:11.640 --> 40:16.600
it will too. And Bobby Blackwell in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com saying, I want

40:16.600 --> 40:21.880
stage kit compatibility. I agree. I still want one of those stage kits, even though

40:21.880 --> 40:24.600
that'd be a complete waste of money at this point. You could probably get them really

40:24.600 --> 40:31.160
cheap now. All right. Also in last week's news, speaking of EA, I'm sure many of you

40:31.160 --> 40:36.520
caught wind of this, even though this happened during GDC. And I don't know if that was an

40:36.520 --> 40:41.280
attempt to not have this show up on the radar, but in this day and age of the internet, when

40:41.280 --> 40:47.480
you try really hard to have something not show up on the radar, guess what? It elevates

40:47.480 --> 40:53.460
it to people's radar that much more. And that's what happened when news came out that EA has

40:53.460 --> 41:03.040
closed Maxis. Maxis behind the Sims 4 and of course the ill-fated SimCity reboot that

41:03.040 --> 41:08.960
happened a couple years ago that, you know, didn't, it wasn't received too well because

41:08.960 --> 41:13.040
of the always online component that not everybody was on board for. Well, and even like SimCity

41:13.040 --> 41:18.280
or the Sims 4, like with all the removed features and stuff in there, it's like, come on. You

41:18.280 --> 41:23.880
know, I mean, I have a hard time believing it was just Maxis going, you know, this is

41:23.880 --> 41:28.800
going to be a good idea. I can't, I can't help but think that EA kind of pushed them

41:28.800 --> 41:33.140
to do certain things that they did in that. That's, that's the other thing that's kind

41:33.140 --> 41:39.700
of interesting or crazy to me and all this is that, you know, Maxis, you know, ate a

41:39.700 --> 41:44.460
lot of controversy with the SimCity thing. And I don't know, when I still think of Maxis,

41:44.460 --> 41:48.620
I have a very soft space in my heart because I think of all those amazing Sim games from

41:48.620 --> 41:53.380
the nineties, like the original SimCity, even SimCity 2000, even though I didn't like that

41:53.380 --> 41:59.100
one as much, but I know a lot of people did, but I think of things like SimAnt, SimEarth,

41:59.100 --> 42:04.460
SimTower. I loved all those games and man, that was the heyday. And unfortunately, you

42:04.460 --> 42:09.660
know, now they started going in this direction with the, the SimCity and I wasn't a big fan

42:09.660 --> 42:14.040
of the whole always online thing because I think a lot of us, why did we love SimCity

42:14.040 --> 42:18.820
the original? Cheat codes and making Godzilla appear whenever you want by typing certain

42:18.820 --> 42:23.300
things in the keyboard. But in this day and age, and the way EA's model has been as of

42:23.300 --> 42:29.400
late is now you can pay money to unlock all that. And people were not having that, but

42:29.400 --> 42:37.640
I feel like that is part of EA's culture, not Maxis' culture. So there's something very

42:37.640 --> 42:45.060
odd to me about the reason that that game flopped was probably more EA's influence than

42:45.060 --> 42:51.500
anybody else. And so that's, what's very frustrating about this news, you know, and again, I'm

42:51.500 --> 42:56.460
just sitting here in my spare room in Sacramento commentating on what I see. I don't know how

42:56.460 --> 43:01.140
it works on the inside, but I still can't help but feel like every issue with these

43:01.140 --> 43:04.260
games was something that was decided in a boardroom, not by a developer.

43:04.260 --> 43:09.060
To me, that's kind of the same situation I think with Activision and Bazaar was, you

43:09.060 --> 43:13.180
know, kind of that, oh, hey, we have an idea, you do this. And then like, it didn't work

43:13.180 --> 43:17.860
out. And so they punished, they punished the developer instead, you know, even though it

43:17.860 --> 43:20.100
was their terrible idea.

43:20.100 --> 43:25.740
Kossin in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, no shout out for Sim Farm. Look, I didn't

43:25.740 --> 43:31.100
shout out Simcopter either. Okay, look, I just, I can't, can't name them all. Anyhow,

43:31.100 --> 43:36.700
EA saying that today we're consolidating Maxis IP development to our studios in Redwood Shores,

43:36.700 --> 43:42.300
Salt Lake City, Helsinki, and Melbourne as we close our Emeryville locations. Maxis continues

43:42.300 --> 43:46.740
to support and develop new experiences for current Sims and SimCity players while expanding

43:46.740 --> 43:52.260
our franchises to new platforms and developing new cross-platform IP. In other words, SimCity

43:52.260 --> 43:56.660
isn't dead, the Sims isn't dead, but they're probably going to show up on mobiles.

43:56.660 --> 44:00.580
Well, they already have. I think it's more of they're going to have different teams developing

44:00.580 --> 44:04.700
it. And you know what, maybe that's better for that series. Maybe it'll end up being...

44:04.700 --> 44:09.540
I still feel like if some of the same decisions are still made, it's not going to change a

44:09.540 --> 44:14.300
goddamn thing. And you know that. So EA is going to have to take a different approach

44:14.340 --> 44:17.860
with if they're going to move it to a different development studio, they need to let that

44:17.860 --> 44:22.220
studio make the decisions. Well, whose idea was it for like Sim... I mean, I'm assuming

44:22.220 --> 44:27.860
it started with like kind of Sims 2 and stuff, maybe even Sims 1 where they have like $400

44:27.860 --> 44:33.100
worth of expansions and shit for like the Sims. Well, here's the other thing to keep

44:33.100 --> 44:39.940
in mind though, is that the Sims at the time, and I think maybe still possibly eclipsed

44:39.940 --> 44:43.260
by one of the Blizzard games like World of Warcraft, but I'm pretty confident in saying

44:43.260 --> 44:50.180
the Sims is the biggest PC game of all time, or at least was for a very long period of

44:50.180 --> 44:54.180
time unless something's eclipsed it recently that I'm not aware of. But I mean, when you

44:54.180 --> 44:59.620
have the most popular game of all time, multiple expansions to that I think are justifiable

44:59.620 --> 45:04.900
and fine, you know, whatever. Yeah, but when you have like a new expansion... It's not

45:04.900 --> 45:08.500
that different from DLC today. It's not that different from DLC today. It's not that different

45:08.500 --> 45:13.980
from EA DLC today. I mean, it's the same thing. It's just, you know, they supported

45:13.980 --> 45:20.340
it with discs and that kind of nonsense. Yeah. So, I don't know. I just... This news hits

45:20.340 --> 45:25.180
hard a little bit just because, again, I remember Maxis from the 90s and I used to love them,

45:25.180 --> 45:28.460
but then, you know... It kind of went downhill with support, didn't it? Yeah, I just... I

45:28.460 --> 45:34.500
hate to say it, but they haven't... Unfortunately, they haven't knocked one out of the park probably

45:34.500 --> 45:39.860
since maybe what? Sims 2. Even Dark Sakura, that girl in the earlier years of the show,

45:39.860 --> 45:44.380
she used to play the Sims all the time, right? Have you heard her talk about Sims 4? Maybe

45:44.380 --> 45:49.500
once? She's kind of moved on. So, I think, unfortunately, that kind of says a lot about

45:49.500 --> 45:54.060
what's going on. You're right. Spore... And it's so hard to say this because I think Will

45:54.060 --> 45:58.900
Wright is a genius. I do, but Spore... We all know Spore missed the mark in several

45:58.900 --> 46:01.500
places where it was just too disjointed. That's fine. I'm fine with Will Wright kickstarting

46:01.500 --> 46:07.980
something if you... Yeah! Hey, why don't you, like, you know, come out with another

46:07.980 --> 46:14.580
city simulator or something like that. Simulator City. Every musician has their not-so-great

46:14.580 --> 46:20.140
album, so you know what? Every designer is allowed their not-so-great game as well, so...

46:20.140 --> 46:26.380
It happens. It happens. Anyway, also, it's funny you should say that. Why doesn't he

46:26.380 --> 46:30.220
go back? It sounds like somebody else might have actually put out the game that people

46:30.220 --> 46:34.980
wanted. Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com saying, apparently, Cities

46:34.980 --> 46:40.820
Skylines, or whatever, is today a SimCity. A lot of people love it, and it just launched

46:40.820 --> 46:45.320
last week. And TigerClaw says, yeah, one of the reasons is the Steam Workshop support.

46:45.320 --> 46:49.460
People can mod it. And yeah, I'm... Somebody even tweeted me like, Rob, are you gonna play

46:49.460 --> 46:53.580
this game? And I'm like, yeah, if I can look away from the MMOs for like two minutes, I'll

46:53.580 --> 46:58.980
play this game. But I am very interested in the Cities Skyline, which sounds like opportunistic

46:59.020 --> 47:04.860
as hell in a way, but hey, good on ya. You heard that all the people wanted this game

47:04.860 --> 47:09.340
instead, so you went and made that game. Good for you. And it's getting very good reviews

47:09.340 --> 47:12.540
from what I'm hearing as well. So maybe Cities Skylines is where it's at.

47:12.540 --> 47:19.540
Yeah. So, anyhow, never... Bad decisions or not, it's never easy to talk about people

47:19.580 --> 47:24.700
losing their jobs, so I hope all those people can find footing somewhere else, and again,

47:24.700 --> 47:28.740
I know I realize, and I think a little bit realizes, it's probably not your fault if

47:28.740 --> 47:31.680
you're a programmer or an artist or somebody on the front lines, it's probably not your

47:31.680 --> 47:35.500
fault that SimCity went online, and I'm sure many of you internally often wanted to do

47:35.500 --> 47:39.980
these questions as well. So, sorry to see that that happened. I hope you can find other

47:39.980 --> 47:44.180
employment somewhere very soon, or venture out and open up a new studio, as we've seen

47:44.180 --> 47:47.540
a lot of people doing, and a lot of those indie developers that were at PAX East were

47:47.540 --> 47:50.740
part of that. Anyhow, let's move on to something else.

47:50.740 --> 47:53.900
This is gonna be something a little different for the show. We haven't really done anything

47:53.900 --> 47:58.900
like this before, but some big news came up during that week that I was at PAX East,

47:58.900 --> 48:02.860
and this was so big that I was getting plenty of Facebook messages about it, like, Rob,

48:02.860 --> 48:05.820
you gonna talk about this on OLR? You gonna talk about this? I was getting tweets about

48:05.820 --> 48:11.500
it and so forth. So yes, we're gonna talk about it on OLR. And I think this news is

48:11.500 --> 48:17.700
not on a lot of people's radars, and I actually got a tweet from our buddy YYR that said,

48:17.700 --> 48:22.700
hey, Rob, can I do a special piece on this or something? Because I really wanna have

48:22.700 --> 48:26.440
my say on this and explain this to everybody. And I was like, yes, we can have a foreign

48:26.440 --> 48:33.180
correspondent now. We made it. We do. We have a foreign correspondent from New York. Is

48:33.180 --> 48:36.560
that foreign? Well, foreign enough here for us here. It's a little outside the People's

48:36.560 --> 48:41.640
Republic of Davis, but you know. So we are gonna go to our foreign correspondent to talk

48:41.640 --> 48:46.580
a little bit about what is going on with Programmed World. And I'm gonna reiterate, I don't think

48:46.580 --> 48:52.680
a lot of people are talking about this because this is very deeply rooted in our deep roots

48:52.680 --> 48:57.240
of being a music gaming program, which is really where we started. So I don't think

48:57.240 --> 49:02.080
this is popping up on a lot of people's radars, but I'm gonna ping it right now. So let's

49:02.080 --> 49:06.400
go to our foreign correspondent, YYR, with more information.

49:06.400 --> 49:11.960
The end of an era, Nostal Mix. This is an Orange Lounge Radio special report. I'm Aaron

49:11.960 --> 49:19.020
Toplitsky. How far would you go to play a video game or to share it with the world?

49:19.020 --> 49:24.260
Germany ceased production of Beatmania 2DX home versions in 2009. They continued yearly

49:24.260 --> 49:30.060
updates to the game, each bringing lots of new songs and challenges. But outside of Japan,

49:30.060 --> 49:36.800
they were impossible to find. A small group calling themselves DJ Hackers began to crack

49:36.800 --> 49:42.580
these newer versions of 2DX, which were running on fairly ordinary PCs running Windows XP

49:42.580 --> 49:48.020
embedded. They did release the cracked data for download on a private BitTorrent tracker,

49:48.020 --> 49:54.260
but their true goal was to bring the full 2DX experience to arcades outside of Japan.

49:54.260 --> 49:59.100
So while they soon had cracked versions of the game running on legitimate 2DX cabinets,

49:59.100 --> 50:01.940
their efforts did not end there.

50:01.940 --> 50:07.820
In Japan, Konami runs a network called eAmusement. At first, it simply tracked scores and clear

50:07.820 --> 50:13.860
status for each song, but the online features were greatly expanded in later versions. Today's

50:13.860 --> 50:20.340
Bimani games are continuously updated, each having dozens of unlockable songs, plus customization

50:20.340 --> 50:25.900
features, in-game score comparisons with rival players, and even the ability to pay for your

50:25.900 --> 50:28.980
games using virtual currency.

50:28.980 --> 50:34.180
Konami's current business model actually revolves around the eAmusement network. Arcades no

50:34.180 --> 50:39.820
longer pay for new versions of Bimani games. Instead, they pay Konami monthly for network

50:39.820 --> 50:46.260
access, and also pay approximately 30% of each machine's revenue. Further, the latest

50:46.260 --> 50:50.660
games need to be connected to the network just to function. If they can't connect at

50:50.660 --> 50:57.020
boot time, they can't be played. In fact, arcades must have a current eAmusement subscription

50:57.020 --> 51:01.700
and agree to these terms in order to receive the newest game versions at all. They can't

51:01.700 --> 51:04.260
be obtained in any other way.

51:04.260 --> 51:09.200
Several independent arcades in America have tried contacting Konami in an effort to sign

51:09.200 --> 51:13.840
up for eAmusement, but none to date have received a reply.

51:13.840 --> 51:19.120
Following many months of work, DJ Hackers successfully reverse engineered the eAmusement

51:19.120 --> 51:25.080
network, and then set up their own, which they of course named after a song in 2DX,

51:25.080 --> 51:30.760
Programmed World. They also found a source in Japan who could provide access to current

51:30.760 --> 51:36.760
Bimani games. By late 2011, Programmed World had reached out to known locations outside

51:36.760 --> 51:42.360
of Japan with 2DX machines, informing them that they could now run the latest, current

51:42.360 --> 51:47.960
version. All they needed was their machine, a pair of card readers, a broadband internet

51:47.960 --> 51:53.460
connection, a Linksys router, and a bit of cooperation. Programmed World offered the

51:53.460 --> 52:00.460
service free of charge, and just as Beatmania 2DX 19, Linkle, was released in Japan, arcades

52:00.980 --> 52:07.540
in America received it mere days later. This effort grew, and over time, Programmed World

52:07.540 --> 52:14.540
added support for Popin' Music, DDR, Ubeat, SoundVoltex, GuitarFreaks, and Drummania,

52:15.420 --> 52:20.460
delivering new versions of most games as they were released. Programmed World even added

52:20.460 --> 52:25.820
some features Konami never offered, such as transfer of player song scores from one game

52:25.820 --> 52:27.660
version to the next.

52:27.740 --> 52:33.380
Then, seemingly suddenly, just over a week ago, the administrator of Programmed World

52:33.380 --> 52:38.900
received a cease and desist letter from Konami Digital Entertainment Incorporated. Several

52:38.900 --> 52:43.820
arcades serviced by Programmed World also received letters asking them to stop running

52:43.820 --> 52:50.100
current versions of Bimani games or face potential legal action. Two days later, on the evening

52:50.100 --> 52:56.820
of Sunday, March 8th, Programmed World permanently shut down. Devoted players convened online

52:56.820 --> 53:02.940
asking why. It had become clear over time that as Programmed World expanded, and as

53:02.940 --> 53:07.820
our communications became increasingly social, it was impossible to keep it a secret from

53:07.820 --> 53:13.460
Konami. However, according to sources, Konami had been aware of the network's existence

53:13.460 --> 53:18.700
for at least several years. Why did they wait to take action until now?

53:18.700 --> 53:24.860
One possibility comes in the form of a Japanese chain of amusement centers named Round 1,

53:24.900 --> 53:30.900
which in recent years decided to expand into the United States beginning in California.

53:30.900 --> 53:37.380
These centers feature karaoke, bowling, billiards, darts, ping pong, and a large arcade packed

53:37.380 --> 53:43.620
with Japanese games including the latest Bimani games. But through a special deal with Konami,

53:43.620 --> 53:50.460
Round 1's Bimani games are all connected to the official Japanese e-amusement network.

53:50.460 --> 53:55.940
As Programmed World continued to grow worldwide, reaching Europe, South America, and even parts

53:55.940 --> 54:01.300
of Asia, Round 1 continued their expansion in the United States. They've already opened

54:01.300 --> 54:08.300
locations in Texas and Illinois, and are coming soon to Washington, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania.

54:08.420 --> 54:15.420
They list Beatmania 2DX as a Round 1 exclusive game on their website. So, some players believe

54:15.420 --> 54:20.340
that they may have seen Programmed World as unfair competition and asked Konami to

54:20.340 --> 54:22.140
shut it down.

54:22.140 --> 54:26.860
Another possibility comes in the form of an announcement quietly posted to Konami's website

54:26.860 --> 54:33.540
less than two weeks ago, the opening of what they call e-Amusement Global Service. Further

54:33.540 --> 54:38.780
details have been promised later this month, but what players are hoping for is that Konami

54:38.780 --> 54:44.140
recognizes a global demand for their games and will begin to provide the service directly

54:44.140 --> 54:49.540
to arcades around the world. However, whether they'll actually provide the service to locations

54:49.540 --> 54:54.580
other than Round 1 remains to be seen. And even if they do offer the service to other

54:54.580 --> 55:00.300
locations, there's no guarantee that the cost will be affordable enough for struggling independent

55:00.300 --> 55:01.580
arcades.

55:01.580 --> 55:07.880
Ultimately, these arcades, and their owners, stand to lose even more than the players.

55:07.880 --> 55:12.460
At the very least, until we learn more about Konami's plans, all of the machines that were

55:12.460 --> 55:18.620
connected to Programmed World must be manually downgraded to versions that will run offline.

55:18.620 --> 55:25.540
The newest of these is over three years old. The situation for some venues is even worse.

55:25.540 --> 55:33.060
The newly opened Nanuet Arcade in New York recently purchased DDR2014 and SoundVoltex3

55:33.060 --> 55:39.260
machines. Both are still on their way from overseas, and without a network connection,

55:39.260 --> 55:41.980
they can't be played at all.

55:41.980 --> 55:45.260
For Orange Lounge Radio, I'm Aaron Toplitsky.

56:41.980 --> 56:45.500
Do they have one in California? Because I'd like to go, it sounds awesome.

56:45.500 --> 56:51.260
But anyway, I think that whole theory about Round 1 and the fact that, okay, if they are

56:51.260 --> 56:55.660
embracing having these machines there, and they've made these deals with Konami, because

56:55.660 --> 56:59.660
they know that, you know, Bomani games are still huge in Japan, and they want to be like

56:59.660 --> 57:05.300
a Japanese center or whatever, maybe they've agreed to pay the proceeds to Konami, or what

57:05.300 --> 57:09.940
have you, then if they're going to go to these other arcades and see, wait a minute, these

57:09.980 --> 57:14.580
pirated versions of the game where they're not paying anything at all is running rampant,

57:14.580 --> 57:19.780
then, you know, it's, or I shouldn't say pirated, because some of them are purchased legitimately

57:19.780 --> 57:25.860
and on the network or whatever, but they're not paying that percentage to Konami, clearly,

57:25.860 --> 57:30.780
so there is a different type of money exchange going on there. If they're all doing that,

57:30.780 --> 57:33.740
then, you know, Round 1 probably did complain about a problem there.

57:33.740 --> 57:35.860
It's a bowling alley, by the way.

57:35.860 --> 57:40.820
But it says they have a multitude, probably like our bowling alley here has Laser X and

57:40.820 --> 57:43.860
a big arcade and all this other stuff, so it's probably like a similar type of thing.

57:43.860 --> 57:49.860
So, let's see, the closest place that they have one, which I'm wondering now that I see

57:49.860 --> 57:54.660
this, if they've taken over a different location there, but apparently they do have them in

57:54.660 --> 58:00.420
California. They've got one, I'd say probably the closest one would be in the East Ridge

58:00.420 --> 58:02.220
Shopping Center in San Jose.

58:02.220 --> 58:05.820
Yeah, they're all mentioning in chat that there's a bunch in California. Well, gee,

58:05.820 --> 58:06.820
somehow slipped off my radar.

58:06.820 --> 58:08.420
That's five. I wouldn't say it's a lot.

58:08.420 --> 58:09.820
That's five's a lot.

58:09.820 --> 58:15.580
Most are in Southern California. There's one in Santa Ana, one in Lakewood, Moreno Valley,

58:15.580 --> 58:16.580
and City of Independence.

58:16.580 --> 58:18.500
Fine, OLR Road Trip. We'll make this happen.

58:18.500 --> 58:24.380
And actually, the one that's in East Ridge is coming soon. It's not even out there yet.

58:24.380 --> 58:29.540
It's a slippery slope, though, because, like, I know when I went to Scandia back when they

58:29.540 --> 58:34.100
actually still had the newer 2DX machines, I had a lot of fun playing it, and I really

58:34.100 --> 58:39.860
enjoyed that. And, you know, I'm glad that they were able to provide that where Konami

58:39.860 --> 58:44.820
would not put that out officially in the U.S. and was kind of holding that back from the

58:44.820 --> 58:49.840
fans. So, in a way, you know, the fans are to thank for putting that together and having

58:49.840 --> 58:54.620
it out there. But I think now that somebody's stepping in saying, I want to do it legitimately,

58:54.620 --> 58:56.380
that's probably why it's taken away.

58:56.380 --> 59:00.100
But it is lame, though, that we have these round one exclusive arcade game titles, and

59:00.100 --> 59:07.960
here's what they have. Initial D8, Purikura, which is a photo booth, BeatMania 2DX, Pump

59:07.960 --> 59:14.580
It Up Pro 50-inch Prime 2015, Transformers, and Pac-Man Smash.

59:14.580 --> 59:20.420
Hmm. Well, I mean, when you consider that a lot of other arcades are really, like, you

59:20.420 --> 59:25.100
know, kind of going downhill, unfortunately, I mean, it's not too, I mean, what, you have

59:25.100 --> 59:31.020
Dave and Busters? I still think it's absolutely, it's, like, kind of a kick in the face of

59:31.020 --> 59:34.660
all the people that have supported Konami all this time. It's like, oh, hey, fuck you

59:34.660 --> 59:38.500
guys, you know. Oh, you still want to support us? Oh, fuck you. You know, we'll just go

59:38.500 --> 59:41.620
ahead and give money to, because they're going to give us money to have this game exclusive

59:41.620 --> 59:46.380
to this arcade. So, screw you guys. There's no answer to this that isn't going to piss

59:46.380 --> 59:51.220
somebody off. Like, I, and I can honestly, I can honestly truly sit here and say, I see

59:51.220 --> 59:54.980
both sides of it. And I think a lot of you out there, as much as maybe you don't want

59:54.980 --> 01:00:00.660
to admit that, you know, you can see Konami's side of it, if they, the way Aaron put it

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:04.020
there with the whole agreement with round one, and that maybe round one's going to give

01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:07.900
them that cut, and once it's exclusive detail, so for, in order for that to happen, the rest

01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:14.380
has to get shut down. I mean, money talks, and I can see that. At the same time, you

01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:20.980
know what we always say here on OLR? Hackers gonna hack. And so, where program world goes

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:27.700
away, there'll probably be another solution that's out there. But if this round one arcade

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:33.100
catches wind of this mom and pop arcade that suddenly is running a BeatMania 2DX, you know,

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:37.860
much newer version that is connected online on EMUs, they'll, the arcade will probably

01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:43.660
get season assisted. I mean, if that's, if, it depends on how big of a draw and how important

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:52.060
that is to round one, but if this arcade chain knows there is a cult of music game

01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:57.720
fans, and I say cult in a loving type of way, not in a, we're all gonna, like, you know,

01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:02.820
take drugs and die kind of way, I mean, if there is this cult of people who love this

01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:09.260
music games that will travel a great distance to come to our place, if we are the exclusive,

01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:14.500
then there's perhaps a certain allure with that, where they want people to have to do

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:15.500
that a little bit.

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:17.700
They also apparently have Project Diva.

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:24.740
Oh, hell, I'm sold on that. I love Project, alright, anyway. Over in our chat room over

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:29.980
at live.vognetwork.com, YYR of course providing comments in the chat room there saying, the

01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:36.700
people really screwed are the ones in countries not serviced by either EMUsment or round one.

01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:39.900
That's a very good point, is that you might have places in other companies, which, which

01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:47.160
is why it might be a good thing if this particular EMUsment global service ends up being a thing

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:50.860
and maybe in other countries where they don't have round one, maybe there will be another

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:55.300
option, or maybe, you know, if the mom and pop arcade wants to get on the 2DX, they can

01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:57.300
join this EMUs global thing.

01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:00.800
But here's what I do really like to happen.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:06.660
If Konami's suddenly realizing that this shit is recognized on a global scale, and if music

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:14.100
games are experiencing a bit of a renaissance right now, is it too much to ask for a proper

01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:20.700
goddamn Beatmania release on PlayStation 4 where, wait for it, I know this might be hard

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:26.060
to believe, but would it be too much to ask that we just get the same thing that Japan

01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:29.780
gets? Would it just, I know this might blow people's minds.

01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:34.640
This is something that might blow minds too, but couldn't you maybe do a digital only release

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:35.640
or something like that?

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:38.000
Hey, hey, the arcades are upgrading.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:44.520
Let's send, let's push out upgrades that you can too by, you know, maybe it will be slightly

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:47.800
limited because, you know, they still got to have some sort of draw for the arcades

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:50.000
or maybe it's going to be a year behind or something like that.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.960
But I, I don't understand why they couldn't do that.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:56.320
What, what the hell 2DX are they on anymore anyway?

01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:00.000
I'm really sorry to all the longtime Monty fans, but was Trichorros the latest one?

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
23?

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Is that where they're at?

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000
I don't know.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Somebody in chat will correct me if I'm wrong.

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:06.520
When was the last one they put out properly on consoles?

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:07.520
Princess, right?

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:08.520
Six or no, sorry.

01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:09.520
Empress.

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:10.520
Princess.

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:11.520
Close enough.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:13.600
Uh, 16 was the last one they put out on PlayStation 2, right?

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:20.160
So why not, why not release the new one digitally or even got physical release cause you want

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.160
to have a controller, right?

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.160
Or whatever.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.560
Maybe you can even use the touch pad.

01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:24.560
I don't know.

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:25.560
Whatever.

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:31.880
Figure something out where you can release that and then all those older ones we missed,

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:33.960
there's your DLC library.

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:34.960
Oh my God.

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:35.960
Oh my God.

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:36.960
Come on.

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:37.960
How many Konami originals do you have?

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:38.960
It costs you literally nothing.

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:42.080
Why do you need Konami originals?

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:43.080
Nevermind in joke.

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:44.080
Forget it.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:46.920
Uh, 22 Penn Jewel I'm being told is the recent one.

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:47.920
Sorry guys.

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:52.720
Uh, Bonds 006 in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, yes, Rob, it's too much to ask.

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:54.360
Konami doesn't like making money.

01:03:54.360 --> 01:04:01.800
Well, you know, to be fair, to be fair, did Beatmania sell as well as something like Rock

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:02.800
Band did?

01:04:02.800 --> 01:04:03.800
No.

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:09.240
Did, was it supported by America as well as something like Rock Band was?

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:10.240
Nope.

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:11.240
Why?

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:15.120
Because they didn't, well, they didn't really advertise it and do anything they may.

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:18.160
I think didn't they have like a Britney Spears song in there or something like that and that

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.160
was about it.

01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:24.240
Two reasons, and these are the two things that must be fixed if the Konami is ever going

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:27.280
to succeed with something like this here in America, if they're going to reboot.

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.880
These are the two things that must be fixed.

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:34.960
Problem number one, the songs that were in the game as well as the songs that were in

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:39.720
Rock Revolution and so forth, dah, dah, dah, dah, were not really the songs that the general

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:45.840
population, not the Colt Bimani fans, I'll get to you in a minute, that was not the group

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:48.020
of songs that people wanted to play.

01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:50.360
Why did Guitar Hero do so stinking well?

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:54.680
Because you could actually play like fucking Aerosmith, ACDC, Metallica, and it wasn't

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:57.280
just covers, it was the actual songs.

01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:03.680
They took a huge risk in licensing original songs and it paid off for a few years very,

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:05.400
very well, the Guitar Hero and Rock Band thing.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:09.440
Well, it would continue to still pay off if they didn't melt that into the ground, but

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:12.480
yeah, that's, it worked for Rock Band.

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:18.360
Now item number two, and this one is for those Colt Bimani and music game fans.

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:21.160
Item number two that must be fixed.

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:24.240
Stop pretending we don't fucking know what's happening in Japan.

01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:26.340
This is the day and the age of the internet.

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:31.300
So stop assuming that your bread and butter Colt fan base doesn't know damn well what's

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:32.580
happening in Japan.

01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:37.740
If you have to cut a few licenses here and there because of legality reasons, then whatever.

01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:38.940
People will forgive it.

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:43.820
But as far as, you know, the vast library of Konami originals in house, there is no

01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:47.940
reason why the release we get here should not mirror what comes out in Japan.

01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:50.020
And I would still love a new DDR game.

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:51.020
I would.

01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:53.480
I mean, come on, look at this shit.

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:57.320
Look at like what people pay for fucking collector's editions on games and shit.

01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:02.280
You can't tell me that you can't put on a decent dance pad for a couple hundred dollars.

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:05.840
I mean, it's ridiculous.

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:09.560
Anyway, there you go.

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:14.880
We've given some attention to this topic and I don't, I think E3 may have some answers

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:16.280
if Konami is going to unveil.

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:19.360
It's all going to be the Melger Solid 5 show and that's about it.

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:21.560
Oh, maybe Silent Hills, which would be kind of cool.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.680
But of course that.

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:26.840
But it's going to be that because that's where their money is going to be made.

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:31.080
They're not going to, there's not going to be any sort of dance masters, which I think

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:32.760
that was kind of a mistake anyways.

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:40.240
But yeah, YYR in chat saying problem is they tailored their American releases to new players

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:42.240
exclusively.

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:47.240
Act F saying Beatmania was 99% originals and remixes of originals.

01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:51.080
Let's see Akuma JP saying developers, developers, developers.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:55.040
Akuma just needs to say that, wow, that's an old, I'm sure we get some licensed songs

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.880
from Vincent de Mora means shit.

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:57.880
What's he done lately?

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:01.560
I mean, I still, Hey, those are still some of my favorite songs.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:02.560
Exactly.

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:06.240
I'm that, I'm not seeing it like being sarcastically, seriously, what has he done lately?

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:10.640
Cause I want to listen to more of his stuff and there were other people like UltraMix

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.840
brought in some very talented people into the family, right?

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:16.560
Like Midi Head who did the intro to our show in case you forgot that little riff you heard

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.560
at the beginning.

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:18.560
That was Midi Head who is from UltraMix.

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:23.560
And I think he had like one 2DX song, you know, maybe get, get some of his newer stuff.

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.120
See what he's been up to in the past 10 years.

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:26.680
I think he's been doing a lot of scoring for TV.

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:28.360
There's a whole ton of indie guys out there.

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:29.800
Get Vert to do some music.

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:30.800
Fuck yes.

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:31.800
Fuck yes.

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:32.800
Oh my God.

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:37.880
There's all these like huge chiptune guys that are creating these soundtracks that people

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:40.160
jizz over that.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.160
I do.

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:46.320
Do you think Vert would be happy to, for, for a couple hundred bucks or something, throw

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:49.920
down a couple tracks that can be in 2DX and would people be here for that?

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:51.500
I think they would.

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:55.360
And a lot of these other very talented people as well that, that write video game music.

01:07:55.360 --> 01:08:00.560
That's a fucking great idea, but it's why they won't do it.

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:02.240
All right.

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:04.100
Anyhow, let's move on.

01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:06.200
It is a three hour show, not a 30 hour show.

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:08.100
I really want to thank YYR for that though.

01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:12.000
And I got to say, if you're interested in doing a report like that, like if you think

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.360
you're an expert on a particular subject and you see something happening throughout the

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:19.120
week where you're like, you know what, I want to do a report on that for OLR.

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:23.420
You can always email us, participate at orangelaundry.com or actually it might be even better.

01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:26.040
You can always email me directly as long as you're not sending me crap.

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:29.540
I'll read it rob at vog network.com.

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:32.600
And if you're interested in contributing something to the show, you can also tweet at me.

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:34.360
That's what YYR did at SKIE.

01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:41.160
And as long as you're not like tweeting me all this inane bullshit about ethics or whatever,

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:46.000
I will happily pay attention to whatever it is you might want to contribute to the

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000
show.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
So.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000
All right.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Let's move on though.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.280
We got a lot more news to cover as well.

01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:52.280
Right, Loki?

01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:53.280
Moving into this week, finally.

01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:54.280
So news from this week.

01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:55.280
Absolutely.

01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:56.280
And this is kind of cool.

01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:59.800
It's more information about the new PlayStation 4 firmware update 2.5.

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:03.320
Some of the cool things that they're going to add to it is button remapping, which is

01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:07.280
great if you happen to have like a controller that maybe like a certain button's kind of

01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:11.620
not working correctly anymore and you want to fix that or maybe you just want to remap

01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:15.160
your buttons because you like playing a certain way.

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:16.160
That's fantastic.

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.520
So you're able to do that now with the firmware.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:23.760
Also with that, they're going to be adding suspend and resume to gameplay.

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:27.820
So normally you can suspend your system and that kind of stuff, but now you can literally

01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:32.680
pause your game and then come back to right in the same spot that you were in your game

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:34.280
without having to worry about that.

01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:35.280
So that's pretty awesome.

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:39.080
I think that's kind of how they were originally talking, you know, advertising that feature

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:43.040
when they were talking about PlayStation 4 initially.

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:49.480
The other thing which is kind of cool is they're going to be allowing you to upload 60 frames

01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:55.800
per second video for share play and remote play to daily motion.

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:56.800
So that's pretty cool.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:10:04.640
And I guess also that button remapping will be pretty nice for accessibility as well.

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:07.760
That is awesome that they're doing that on a system-wide level.

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:12.480
So the games that fail to remember to put something so easy into the game, not a problem

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.480
anymore.

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:14.480
Yeah.

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:21.380
Or say a game offers you certain button configurations and you just don't like it, you want something

01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:25.600
of your own, then you can do that.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:30.760
Moving on, talking about what's happening with Nintendo while we all wait for that PS4

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:33.240
firmware release because it isn't out yet, but soon.

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:34.800
I think in like April maybe.

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:38.340
Some people making a really big deal about that suspend resume thing because it was something

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:40.840
they announced at the beginning and then it never came out.

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:44.240
Am I the only one that like kind of forgot that that was supposed to be a thing on PlayStation

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.240
4?

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:46.240
Yeah.

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:48.240
But you know, some of the people, there's always those two camps of people and to be

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:52.920
fair, I know there's people that do this to Microsoft and as well, but man, there's some

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:56.460
people out there that just like every little thing Sony does, they just, they'll take the

01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:58.820
opportunity to jump down their throat.

01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:01.040
And I know people that do that with Nintendo too, like Loki.

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:07.080
Well, I am a bit bugged when they announce features and this is specifically for Sony

01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:12.680
in this case, you know, they announce features and then they don't end up releasing with

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:13.680
those features.

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:17.560
I'd rather they just don't announce those features and then put it out and then, oh

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:18.560
hey, we did this.

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:21.320
I was talking with somebody about this at PAX East.

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:25.760
This is why our industry is so fucking secretive, by the way, the video game industry.

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:29.920
This is why there are so many secrets because any little thing that gets out becomes an

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:35.000
expectation and becomes, you know, this thing that is judged and put out there for, you

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.920
know, the cynical game reverse that's out there, of which there's a lot of.

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:38.920
Well, it's fine.

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:41.920
It's fine if like they could say, you know, initially when they're talking about, yeah,

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:44.920
we're these power saving features and what we're working on, we're trying to get this,

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:47.920
you know, resume suspend function to work.

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:53.180
It may be not necessarily as part of an announcement, maybe like, you know, talking with the hardware

01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:57.380
developers type piece or something like that, but I'd be fine with that and wouldn't expect

01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:58.380
them to do that.

01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:01.340
Like, well, we're trying to get that to work, you know, we'll see, you know, it's probably

01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:04.460
not something that's going to be at launch, you know, or even if they're announcing a

01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:08.060
feature like, oh, the resume suspend thing, you know, all this is not going to be at launch.

01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:10.860
This will be coming later on, you know, something we're working on.

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:16.460
I don't believe that was ever outlined, you know, it's more of like, ah, the console releases

01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:17.460
in two weeks.

01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:19.460
Oh, by the way, this is not going to be part of the launch thing.

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:20.460
All right.

01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:26.020
Well, let's move on to Nintendo and Loki is going to try very hard to not find something

01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:27.820
to complain about with these stories.

01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:34.420
Hey, I am, I, I am very fair.

01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:35.420
Sure you are.

01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:36.420
Sure you are.

01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:37.420
All right.

01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:40.060
Uh, let's talk about Splatoon, which of course is coming out on the Wii U later this year,

01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:44.580
which by the way, huge line to play that at PAX East, Splatoon, and I'm kind of thinking

01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:46.660
like why the game's out next month.

01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:50.180
And I just, I don't know, I just, it was the same demo that they had had at E3 and I was

01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:54.420
kind of, I was happy just watching other people play it going, I get an idea what this probably

01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:55.420
game is like.

01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:59.420
I'll probably check it out when it comes out on the Wii U, but I'm sure this, this is not

01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:00.420
a secret anyway.

01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:04.020
Uh, this is, this is one of those very non surprising things.

01:13:04.020 --> 01:13:09.220
However, a Splatoon eShop listing showed up and shows that Splatoon will be supporting

01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:10.860
the amiibo.

01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:12.820
I'm sure this is surprising nobody.

01:13:12.820 --> 01:13:18.420
Uh, it is not an official confirmation, however, but come on, come on, amiibo and Splatoon.

01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:20.020
This is Nintendo's huge thing now.

01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:23.820
So of course I'm sure the amiibo are going to do something in Splatoon.

01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:27.820
Uh, the pages were then quickly taken down after they were discovered, which, you know,

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:31.620
just means it was true, or else what would they have had to be afraid of?

01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:38.020
Um, also apparently there was a, a retailer out there called Raru, uh, that had a Splatoon

01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:39.020
amiibo pages.

01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:43.420
There was a Splatoon squid girl and a boy that were going to be released at the end

01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:44.420
of May.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:48.220
So maybe Splatoon was actually going to get its own dedicated amiibo, or still is going

01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:49.920
to get its own dedicated amiibo.

01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:55.320
If they are, uh, A, I hope we can find them, and B, I'm sure more information will come

01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:57.720
on that in a Nintendo Direct soon.

01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:00.820
You know, though, for all the complaining I've done about amiibo here on the show, which

01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:06.320
I still believe is, is justified, when Nintendo wants certain amiibo to be available, they're

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:07.320
not that hard to find.

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:12.220
Like, if you, you can go to Target and get Mario, Pikachu, Zelda, you know, you can get

01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:18.160
a lot of those pretty easy, and I imagine, like, you know, some of the Mario Party characters

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:22.860
probably won't be so difficult either, uh, and if these Splatoon people are, are released,

01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:25.420
then I'm sure they won't be too hard to find either.

01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:30.660
It's all those niche characters that are the ones that, of course, the gaming fanboys and

01:14:30.660 --> 01:14:35.660
fangirls just, they have to have in their collection, because I'm cool enough for school

01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:40.660
to know, you know, when they were still making Mega Man games, and all these sorts of things,

01:14:40.660 --> 01:14:44.460
that, that causes frenzy, and then Nintendo does, can't print enough of them, because

01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:47.660
there's only so much shelf space or whatever, I don't know.

01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:51.160
Random amiibo tangent, sorry for that.

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:53.160
And here I thought Loki would be the one complaining.

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:54.160
Sorry about that.

01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:57.660
But hey, nothing to complain about with this, because this series is fantastic.

01:14:57.660 --> 01:15:02.160
It's Mother, also known as Earthbound Zero, which is the first one.

01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:06.660
Of course, the soundtrack to these Mother games, uh, are always really kind of trippy

01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:12.160
and fun, and, uh, the official soundtrack to Earthbound Zero was never released outside

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:13.160
of Japan.

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:20.660
However, what's happening with this, a record label named Ship-to-Shore Fanoko has obtained

01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:27.160
the licensing rights to this Mother soundtrack album, and they have taken to Kickstarter

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:33.660
to officially release the Mother official soundtrack outside of Japan and on vinyl.

01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:37.660
So if the Kickstarter does well enough, they might consider releasing soundtracks for other

01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:41.160
video games on vinyl as well, including the rest of the Mother series.

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:43.660
So you can check that out on Kickstarter if you want.

01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:46.660
Uh, trying to get an update on where they're at right now.

01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:47.660
Oh, they made it.

01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:48.660
So it looks like this is happening.

01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:49.660
Their goal was 42,000.

01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:52.660
They're at 48,000 with 24 days to go.

01:15:52.660 --> 01:15:55.660
So they're, they'll probably beat that goal by quite a bit.

01:15:55.660 --> 01:15:59.660
That's pretty awesome that they're going to be releasing those on vinyl.

01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:04.660
It's also pretty disappointing that Nintendo still doesn't give a shit about releasing

01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:05.660
those titles.

01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:11.160
They, isn't, isn't that something when you, when you actually see money being made on

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:16.160
the internet off this and yet, I don't know, I guess they just feel there's more bang for

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:19.160
the buck and focusing on Amiibo or something, which shouldn't, to be fair, they're probably

01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:21.160
here's what I think that they need to do.

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:26.160
Then get a fucking B team develop development team or something like, you know, don't they

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:29.160
have like four or five R and D teams inside Nintendo.

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:31.660
I think here's an idea and I'm going to throw this out there.

01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:33.160
It's going to sound a little, here it is.

01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:34.160
Here it is, folks.

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:35.160
Here it is.

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:39.660
I thought instead of producing Miyamoto's fucking terrible ideas, like, and I'm not

01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:43.660
saying like he has great ideas, but the two, wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:47.660
You just said a Miyamoto's terrible ideas.

01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:50.660
The man behind Super Mario Brothers.

01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:52.160
And yes, yes.

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:56.160
Let's give him a pass on every single idea that he comes up with because he made Super

01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:57.160
Mario Brothers.

01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:01.660
Oh, as I said at the beginning of the show, every developer has a couple of stinkers once

01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:02.660
in a while.

01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:03.660
I've got two couples.

01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:08.160
I have his couple of stinkers right here that he showed off at E3 for an extended period

01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:09.160
of time.

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.160
Oh, fuck you.

01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:11.160
You don't want to know anything about Star Fox.

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:12.160
It'll be good though.

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:16.660
But let me show you this, these, my personal projects that I really care about.

01:17:16.660 --> 01:17:17.660
They're fucking terrible.

01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:23.660
Which was a direct response to everybody saying they wanted to see the Wii U game pad being

01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:24.660
used more.

01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:28.660
That wasn't to quell some type of Miyamoto ego issue.

01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:33.660
That was to shut the fucking stock investors up because they were saying that they didn't

01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:35.660
understand the point of the game pad.

01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:36.660
All right.

01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:37.660
Anyway, anyway.

01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:38.660
Okay.

01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:39.660
Anyways.

01:17:39.660 --> 01:17:40.660
Project watch fucking piece of shit.

01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:41.660
You don't need that.

01:17:41.660 --> 01:17:43.660
It's going to be Five Nights at Freddy's already did.

01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:48.660
And number two, whatever the fucking robot fighting game that he's doing is also garbage.

01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:52.660
So take the people that are going to be making those games and put them on a new mother game.

01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:55.660
You can't tell me that there's not anyone's command.

01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:56.660
You know what?

01:17:56.660 --> 01:17:58.660
Nobody wants to see those games instead of a new mother game.

01:17:58.660 --> 01:18:00.660
No one is going to say that.

01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:01.660
Nobody.

01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:03.660
No one is going to say, I really want to play project watch.

01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:10.660
I really want to defend some arbitrary building from Rob the robot.

01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:14.660
I'm going to, I'm going to poke at this Loki, because I know there's many Nintendo fanboys

01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:17.660
sitting out there with steamed faces right now at what you're saying.

01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:19.660
And you need to consider this.

01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:26.660
Nintendo is trying to broaden the audience than just cult gamers who want cult games.

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:30.660
And so by some of these Wii U projects, the thought is, and we don't really know until

01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:35.660
they're out there and get to test the audience, will this bring more people to the Wii U that

01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:36.660
don't already own one?

01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:37.660
You're right.

01:18:37.660 --> 01:18:39.660
Because that really worked well with Wii Music, didn't it?

01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:41.660
They tried to broaden the audience with that.

01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:43.660
No, no, no, no.

01:18:43.660 --> 01:18:44.660
Apples and oranges.

01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:45.660
Apples and oranges.

01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:47.660
No, it wasn't apples and oranges.

01:18:47.660 --> 01:18:48.660
They thought they could recapture the...

01:18:48.660 --> 01:18:51.660
The Wii had already sold 11 billion copies.

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:55.660
They, oh, and it shouldn't have been a problem to have that game be a success then, because

01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:59.660
even a mart, you know, a small fraction of the people that own the Wii U could have,

01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:02.660
or the Wii, could have bought, you know, Wii Music.

01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:03.660
But guess what?

01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:05.660
Nobody fucking bought that game.

01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:06.660
It was terrible.

01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:08.660
And it didn't broaden any audiences.

01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:12.660
It was just like, oh hey, we're going to recapture the fire that we had with Wii Sports, and

01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:13.660
we're just going to apply it to this.

01:19:13.660 --> 01:19:16.660
And people will buy it because it's like Wii Sports.

01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:21.660
So, I just think if they save their time from producing those two games, hey, Star

01:19:21.660 --> 01:19:22.660
Box is going to be amazing.

01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:27.660
And I'm sure a lot of the things that Miyamoto does are amazing, but I wouldn't waste my

01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:28.660
time on these tech demos.

01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:30.660
It's just not going to work out.

01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:36.660
All right, as expected, as usual, Loki's Rants getting a variety of responses in chat.

01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:40.660
And, you know, some supporting you, Loki.

01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:44.660
We've got Bonds006 saying thank you, Loki, for that rant.

01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:48.660
And YYR saying this episode would not be complete without a Loki Nintendo rant.

01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:50.660
I'm glad this is still a complete episode.

01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:56.660
And then the other side of it, AkumaJP saying please play the game first before you slam

01:19:56.660 --> 01:19:57.660
it.

01:19:57.660 --> 01:20:00.660
What, Wii Music, or are we talking about this?

01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:02.660
I'm assuming these Wii U prototypes.

01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:06.660
Okay, I'll play Project Watch when it comes out.

01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:08.660
Eventually, whenever that is.

01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:09.660
All right, I'm holding you to that.

01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:10.660
I'm holding you to that.

01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:13.660
Okay, I'll play it, and I'm sure I will love it.

01:20:13.660 --> 01:20:15.660
I'll be like, oh my god, Miyamoto made this?

01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:16.660
I have to love it.

01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:19.660
I have to love it.

01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:24.660
Let's see, and Kaijuto saying I don't even know what the heck Mother is, so I'm not looking

01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:25.660
for a remake of it.

01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:28.660
They called Mother 2 Earthbound here in the US.

01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:29.660
That's what that is.

01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:33.660
And Akdeft saying Wii Music was a failed tech demo.

01:20:33.660 --> 01:20:35.660
So, there you go.

01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:41.660
But these two games that, I mean, projects he's working on, wouldn't those technically

01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:42.660
be a tech demo?

01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:46.660
Because it certainly looked like a tech demo to me.

01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:53.660
I, I think it's, honestly, I think it's too soon to say, because sometimes, especially

01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:57.660
Nintendo does this, they put out one tiny little part of their game that becomes a much

01:20:57.660 --> 01:20:58.660
bigger thing.

01:20:58.660 --> 01:21:01.660
But Nintendo has also listened to feedback, and sometimes they'll put out a tech demo

01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:03.660
and then end up not doing anything with it.

01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:06.660
Wii Vitality Sensor.

01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:10.660
So, they must believe in these and that there's full games in there somewhere if they're

01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:12.660
going to actually end up releasing the games.

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:13.660
So, we'll see.

01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:14.660
We'll see, Loki.

01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:17.660
I can't wait to see your beaming reaction to playing those.

01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:22.660
I don't think we'll actually ever see Project Watch or this robot fighting game.

01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:24.660
It will end up being whatever Nintendo Land 2 is.

01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:27.660
What about, what about, are you going to hate on everything Nintendo?

01:21:27.660 --> 01:21:29.660
What about Zelda, Wii U?

01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:31.660
No, I didn't say I hated everything in Nintendo.

01:21:31.660 --> 01:21:34.660
I'm just saying these specific two projects are fine.

01:21:34.660 --> 01:21:39.660
I love Miyamoto and his stuff, but I'm just saying, maybe not Pikmin, but I love everything

01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:40.660
else.

01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:46.660
I'm just saying that these two projects in particular are a waste of time.

01:21:46.660 --> 01:21:48.660
All right.

01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:49.660
Moving on.

01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:53.660
Again, it's only a three-hour show, not a 30-hour show.

01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:54.660
Let's move on with some more stories.

01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:57.660
Loki, what is coming out that a lot of people are going to be playing, probably?

01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:00.660
Well, there's actually some decent stuff coming out.

01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:01.660
Soccer moms everywhere.

01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:03.660
Going to check this game, I'm not sure.

01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:08.660
I'd say it's kind of up my alley, but Battlefield Hardline is going to be coming

01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:15.660
out this week on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.

01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:25.660
Also, Resident Evil Revelations 2 on PlayStation 3, and I believe PlayStation, or Xbox 360,

01:22:25.660 --> 01:22:29.660
Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.

01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:32.660
Those will be the disc versions of the game, because I want to say that they've already

01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:33.660
been out digitally.

01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:36.660
What else?

01:22:36.660 --> 01:22:40.660
I think that might have actually been it.

01:22:40.660 --> 01:22:45.660
I want to see if I'm missing any other releases here, but I think that's it.

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:50.660
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio at vognetwork.com,

01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:53.660
use the passphrase, save.

01:22:53.660 --> 01:22:56.660
Before I get to the Japanese release...

01:22:56.660 --> 01:22:57.660
I did miss one.

01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:01.660
And I'm sorry, it is ironic that it is also Nintendo, but Mario Party 10 will be coming

01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:02.660
out this week.

01:23:02.660 --> 01:23:03.660
Oh, is that this week?

01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:04.660
That is on the 20th.

01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:05.660
That would be Friday.

01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:09.660
I need to, it looks like we might have some guests coming to the show here, spur of the

01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:12.660
moment here, so while I get that worked out, do you want to maybe talk a little bit about

01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:16.660
Mortal Kombat X, and then I'll come back and talk about the Japanese releases.

01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:17.660
Absolutely.

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:23.660
So, Mortal Kombat X is pretty awesome, and we've been kind of waiting, you know, especially

01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:27.660
with the last Mortal Kombat game, they had all these guest characters that were coming

01:23:27.660 --> 01:23:30.660
in there, and kind of speculation is, who's going to be the next guest character?

01:23:30.660 --> 01:23:32.660
We had Freddy Krueger last time.

01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:35.660
You know, wouldn't it be awesome if we had, you know, Jason Voorhees or something like

01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:36.660
that?

01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:41.660
And sure enough, you know, they picked the perfect day to release it, you know, the information

01:23:41.660 --> 01:23:46.660
on Friday the 13th, they announced that Jason Voorhees will be the first guest character

01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:51.660
that will appear in Mortal Kombat X, and they had a nice little trailer that went with that.

01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:59.660
It's going to be part of the Kombat Pack that will include Jason as well as two other classic

01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:04.660
Kombatans, and they're going to have another guest character, and that seems like kind

01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:07.660
of a waste of money now that I look at that.

01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:09.660
But $30 for that.

01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:11.660
$30 for four characters.

01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:14.660
That seems awfully expensive.

01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:15.660
That's dumb.

01:24:15.660 --> 01:24:16.660
Oh, hey!

01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:18.660
Where did that voice come from?

01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:20.660
We have some guests here in studio.

01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:21.660
What voice?

01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:22.660
What voice?

01:24:22.660 --> 01:24:23.660
Hey, how you doing?

01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:24.660
It's Princess Irene joining us tonight.

01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:25.660
Hi.

01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:26.660
How are you doing?

01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:27.660
Doing pretty well.

01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:28.660
How are you?

01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:29.660
Just texting me like, hey, I was in the neighborhood.

01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:30.660
Want me to stop by?

01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:31.660
Yeah.

01:24:31.660 --> 01:24:32.660
That's exactly what happened.

01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:33.660
That's exactly what happened.

01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:34.660
Well, how are you doing?

01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:36.660
What brings you to the neighborhood tonight?

01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:41.660
Oh, we were at the Marvel Universe Live, and then I was trying to leave our mutual friend

01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:42.660
Jim's house, and we went the wrong way.

01:24:42.660 --> 01:24:43.660
We went the wrong way.

01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:46.660
And so we're like, you know, Rob lives over here.

01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:47.660
Go there.

01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:48.660
Why not?

01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:49.660
Wait a minute.

01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:50.660
You mean Flacco?

01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:51.660
No, other Jim.

01:24:51.660 --> 01:24:52.660
Oh, oh, oh.

01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:53.660
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:55.660
Oh, he's not far from here at all.

01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:56.660
No, no, no.

01:24:56.660 --> 01:24:57.660
You're kind of in the right area.

01:24:57.660 --> 01:24:58.660
Yeah.

01:24:58.660 --> 01:24:59.660
We were just going in the wrong direction.

01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:02.660
Hey, and also joining us, all these random voices.

01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:03.660
Whoa.

01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:04.660
A wild Mystique approaches.

01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:05.660
How you doing, Mystique?

01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:10.660
We haven't had you on the show ever since we were, I think, at the studio that was at

01:25:10.660 --> 01:25:11.660
Jamie's house years ago.

01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:12.660
Yep.

01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:14.660
I'm usually traveling with a wild Dan.

01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:15.660
Yes, you are.

01:25:15.660 --> 01:25:16.660
Her husband.

01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:17.660
How are you?

01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:18.660
Pretty good.

01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:19.660
Yeah?

01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:20.660
How was Marvel Live?

01:25:20.660 --> 01:25:21.660
It was pretty cool.

01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:22.660
Yeah.

01:25:22.660 --> 01:25:23.660
What do they do with those things?

01:25:23.660 --> 01:25:24.660
Yeah, the first five minutes were awesome.

01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:25.660
Oh, no.

01:25:25.660 --> 01:25:26.660
Oh, God, you went too, huh?

01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:27.660
We'll get to that later.

01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:28.660
Uh-oh.

01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:29.660
Uh-oh.

01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:30.660
All right.

01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:31.660
It's nothing.

01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:32.660
It's no fault.

01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:33.660
It's a fault of my own genetics, unfortunately.

01:25:33.660 --> 01:25:39.340
Let's just say that I pissed away over $200.

01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:40.340
Meaning that after-

01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:41.340
You bought everything there.

01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:42.340
No.

01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:43.340
No, no, no.

01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:44.340
No, no, no.

01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:45.660
The kid had to go to the bathroom five minutes into the show.

01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:48.580
No, the kid got scared five minutes into the show.

01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:51.500
We had to leave, and I had nice ass seats.

01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:54.620
There were five rows from the floor.

01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:55.620
That's your bad.

01:25:55.620 --> 01:25:56.620
It was fantastic.

01:25:56.620 --> 01:25:57.620
It was so fun.

01:25:57.620 --> 01:25:58.620
It was lots of fun.

01:25:58.620 --> 01:25:59.620
It was fun.

01:25:59.620 --> 01:26:01.820
The first five minutes sucked, but the rest was so good.

01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:03.180
No, no, it was awesome.

01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:05.620
It was just too loud and too scary for-

01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:07.420
What do they do at Marvel Live?

01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:08.420
They play fight.

01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:09.420
They have stuntmen.

01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:10.420
So it's like wrestling?

01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:11.420
It's like a stunt show.

01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:12.420
Well, don't they do-

01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:17.220
It's more as I like to say, it's like Disney on ice, but it's Marvel, but it's not on ice.

01:26:17.220 --> 01:26:19.140
But Marvel's owned by Disney now, so it's-

01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:20.140
Kind of technically.

01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:21.140
So it's Disney on ice without the ice.

01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:22.140
There you go.

01:26:22.140 --> 01:26:23.140
So Disney on.

01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:27.180
It's like one of those stunt shows that you see at Universal Studios or something like

01:26:27.180 --> 01:26:28.180
that.

01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:29.180
Oh, with monster trucks?

01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:30.180
Yeah.

01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:31.180
They didn't have trucks in-

01:26:31.180 --> 01:26:32.180
Actually, motorcycles.

01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:33.180
Dirt bikes.

01:26:33.180 --> 01:26:34.180
Oh, it was so cool.

01:26:34.180 --> 01:26:35.180
Cool.

01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:36.180
Yeah, I wanted to see it, but-

01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:37.180
I went to a hockey game over the weekend.

01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:38.180
I had fun with that.

01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:39.180
That's really cool, Rob.

01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:41.180
Actually, it wasn't that cool because our team got fucking clobbered.

01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:42.180
They choked.

01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:43.180
I felt like I was watching a Kings game.

01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:44.180
It was so awful.

01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:46.420
Wait, are you saying that a hockey game's not cool?

01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:47.420
Wow.

01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:48.420
No, hockey's fun.

01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:49.420
You're not cool.

01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:50.420
All right.

01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:53.140
You should already be used to a Kings game not sucking.

01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:54.140
All right, look.

01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:57.540
By the way, I'm talking about the Sacramento Kings, not the LA Kings, but the LA Kings

01:26:57.540 --> 01:26:58.540
suck too.

01:26:58.540 --> 01:26:59.540
All right, anyway.

01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:00.540
Who are the LA Kings?

01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:01.540
Hockey.

01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:02.540
You've never heard of hockey?

01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:03.540
Oh, what's hockey?

01:27:03.540 --> 01:27:04.540
I don't know what hockey is.

01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:07.620
Did you ever play Blades of Steel, one of the greatest NES games ever?

01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:09.340
Oh my God, did I ever.

01:27:09.340 --> 01:27:10.340
There you go.

01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:11.340
Oh, that hockey.

01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:12.340
Duh.

01:27:12.340 --> 01:27:14.340
Why didn't you just say Blades of Steel?

01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:15.340
Jeez.

01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:19.100
Okay, so I don't know if you know this, but Blades of Steel is based on something that

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:20.100
people do.

01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:24.180
Now, I know you're in California, so this is a hard concept for you to believe, but

01:27:24.180 --> 01:27:31.620
having just got back from fucking Boston a week ago, sometimes the water freezes over

01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:33.780
and people skate on it.

01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:34.780
Is it magic?

01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:35.780
It's like Disney on Ice.

01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:42.280
Yeah, it's like, okay, it's like Disney on Ice, except the princesses punch each other

01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:44.100
and the blood bounces on the ice.

01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:45.100
Oh my gosh.

01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:46.100
That's hockey.

01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:51.540
I would pay money to see the Disney princesses in an all out brutal hockey game.

01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:52.540
I wouldn't.

01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:54.940
That does not sound like fun at all.

01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:55.940
It could be.

01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:56.940
All right.

01:27:56.940 --> 01:28:02.940
Anyway, our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, let's see, SJ100Matt saying Rob has gone to

01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:05.860
more NHL games this year than I have.

01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:09.720
Some folks in chat, DarkTests2us saying shots fired.

01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:11.980
And let's see, YYR saying, so it's like roller games.

01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:12.980
You ever been to roller games?

01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:14.980
Oh my God.

01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:15.980
Roller games.

01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:17.860
It was an NES game.

01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:18.860
Right?

01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:19.860
Where you could be that fat guy.

01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:20.860
Maybe.

01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:21.860
I don't know.

01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:22.860
Shut up.

01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:23.860
It's a game.

01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:24.860
Look it up.

01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:25.860
Chat room.

01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:26.860
Roller games is an NES game.

01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:27.860
Hashtag look it up.

01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:28.860
All right.

01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:31.020
But that was a fantastic game too.

01:28:31.020 --> 01:28:32.020
All right.

01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:34.460
Let's get you ladies caught up on everything we've talked about on OLR tonight.

01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:38.860
I would like you to quickly in one sentence or less, give your reaction to the following

01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:39.860
stories.

01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:40.860
All right.

01:28:40.860 --> 01:28:41.860
Here we go.

01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:42.860
Yes.

01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:43.860
What kind of video games have you played this week?

01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:44.860
Irene?

01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:49.940
I've played Luminous Electronic Symphony and other things that I can't remember.

01:28:49.940 --> 01:28:50.940
Mystique?

01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:51.940
Words.

01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:52.940
Words.

01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:53.940
All right.

01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:58.740
So Mavis Beacon teaches typing or typing of the dead or...

01:28:58.740 --> 01:28:59.740
Words with friends.

01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:00.740
Words with friends.

01:29:00.740 --> 01:29:03.340
I have not had time to play games because I'm too busy doing homework.

01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:06.260
Why are you even on the show?

01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:07.860
Because you made me get on the show.

01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:08.860
That's true.

01:29:08.860 --> 01:29:09.860
Sorry.

01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:10.860
Cause she's fun.

01:29:10.860 --> 01:29:11.860
All right.

01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:13.860
Rock band four has been confirmed.

01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:14.860
What?

01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:18.860
Okay.

01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:19.860
All right.

01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:20.860
Let's see.

01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:23.860
EA closed Maxis, the developers of SimCity.

01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:24.860
Oh no.

01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:25.860
God no.

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:27.860
What are we going to do now?

01:29:27.860 --> 01:29:28.860
I guess play something else.

01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:29.860
You can't be serious.

01:29:29.860 --> 01:29:30.860
Let's see.

01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:36.580
Konami has shut down the service Programmed World that allowed BeatMania 2DX machines

01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:38.860
past Linkle to work here in the US.

01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:39.860
Okay.

01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:40.860
What?

01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:44.860
Do you not have any opinions on anything going on in games?

01:29:44.860 --> 01:29:45.860
No.

01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:46.860
Let's see.

01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:48.860
What did you think of Marvel Universe Live then?

01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:49.860
Oh my God.

01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:50.860
It was so good.

01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:51.860
You guys.

01:29:51.860 --> 01:29:53.860
Like it was, I didn't know what to expect.

01:29:53.860 --> 01:29:54.860
It was off the hook.

01:29:54.860 --> 01:29:55.860
It was off the hook.

01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:56.860
It was off the chain.

01:29:56.860 --> 01:29:57.860
It really was.

01:29:57.860 --> 01:29:58.860
It was.

01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:00.360
Like I thought it was going to be like for kids like, okay, this is going to be stupid,

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:04.500
but it was so action packed and exciting and like it was, you know, a riot.

01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:05.500
It was awesome.

01:30:05.500 --> 01:30:08.620
It was like watching your cartoon come to life.

01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:09.620
Right.

01:30:09.620 --> 01:30:13.340
It was full of puns and clever one liners and just, it was so good.

01:30:13.340 --> 01:30:15.740
You know what else is action packed and exciting?

01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:20.740
Mortal Kombat X. Jason Voorhees is going to be a character in Mortal Kombat X.

01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:22.740
Is it going to be space Jason?

01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:23.740
No.

01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:24.740
I don't think it's because Freddy.

01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:25.740
That's the Jason X.

01:30:25.740 --> 01:30:29.060
It could be one of the, uh, the, uh, costumes because they're supposed to have different

01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:30.060
costumes.

01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:31.340
Freddy Krueger was in the last Mortal Kombat game.

01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:34.100
Well that would make sense because Jason X was space Jason.

01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:35.100
So it's Mortal Kombat X.

01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:36.660
So they should have like, duh.

01:30:36.660 --> 01:30:37.660
All right.

01:30:37.660 --> 01:30:38.660
Makes sense.

01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:39.940
That movie was not very good.

01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:41.940
Look, let's not talk about that.

01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:42.940
Okay.

01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:43.940
Cause I will scream.

01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:44.940
All right.

01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:47.460
Picking up where we left off with release dates for Japan.

01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:50.020
We'll check in with these ladies throughout the show with the other news.

01:30:50.020 --> 01:30:51.940
Maybe I'll let Irene promote her own show.

01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:53.420
Mystique, do you have a podcast too?

01:30:53.420 --> 01:30:54.420
Everybody's got a podcast these days.

01:30:54.420 --> 01:30:55.420
Shut up.

01:30:55.420 --> 01:30:56.420
Um, no.

01:30:56.420 --> 01:30:57.420
Okay.

01:30:57.420 --> 01:30:58.420
Well maybe.

01:30:58.420 --> 01:30:59.420
I forgot to mention.

01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:00.420
She's stuck on one.

01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:01.420
What?

01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:02.420
Since I didn't quite get done there.

01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:04.760
Um, Mortal Kombat X has been delayed on Xbox 360 and PlayStation three.

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:09.920
So uh, you'll have to wait longer than April 14th, unfortunately.

01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:14.220
Well I mean, I think a lot of people are really focusing, especially the audience that would

01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:17.840
be really into Mortal Kombat and buying these games the day and date they come out.

01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:20.600
A lot of them are probably already on PlayStation four or Xbox one.

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:25.320
So I don't imagine there's a huge audience for the 360 and PlayStation three versions,

01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:30.040
but I'm sure some people are feeling a little shafted by that, but Hey, as long as it works,

01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:31.040
that's the most important thing.

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:32.480
It's got to work.

01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:36.180
Time Buster in our chat room over at live.vog network.com talking about Jason saying he

01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:42.240
should be any S Jason with a purple jumpsuit and a blue mask that, okay, that was a frightening

01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:44.240
ass Jason.

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:45.240
That game.

01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:46.240
Okay.

01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:47.240
Look, I know that game gets a lot of shit.

01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:48.320
I know that game gets a lot of shit.

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:54.460
I don't like that game fucking terrified me when I was a kid, it was kind of glitchy and

01:31:54.460 --> 01:31:56.920
like kind of impossible to win.

01:31:56.920 --> 01:32:01.060
But like when you are going in that house and it's the quote unquote first person mode

01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:04.900
in the NES and you turn a corner and Jason is there.

01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:05.900
You shit your pants.

01:32:05.900 --> 01:32:06.900
Yes.

01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:07.900
It is.

01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:08.900
That's what it sounds like.

01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:09.900
Yeah.

01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:13.500
Or when you encounter him on the road, like, fuck, you know, I was looking at a bird one

01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:20.060
minute and then like, I didn't even cool man, Jason.

01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:21.060
I agree.

01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:22.060
I'm in agreeance with you, Rob.

01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:23.060
So it was scary.

01:32:23.060 --> 01:32:24.580
It was very scary.

01:32:24.580 --> 01:32:25.580
Yes.

01:32:25.580 --> 01:32:27.340
Nothing in Mortal Kombat X would be scarier than purple jumpsuit.

01:32:27.340 --> 01:32:28.340
Jason.

01:32:28.340 --> 01:32:29.340
Right.

01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:30.340
Just jumping out of the forest.

01:32:30.740 --> 01:32:31.740
Right.

01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:32.740
And you shitting your pants.

01:32:32.740 --> 01:32:33.740
Probably.

01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:34.740
Probably.

01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:39.860
Hey, Japanese release dates coming out in Japan on the PlayStation 4 on March 19th.

01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:43.460
Final Fantasy Type 0 HD gets its release in Japan as well.

01:32:43.460 --> 01:32:48.180
Biohazard Revelations 2, that's what they call Resident Evil over there.

01:32:48.180 --> 01:32:52.580
As well as Battlefield Hardline all on the PlayStation 4 this week in Japan.

01:32:52.580 --> 01:32:57.160
On the Xbox 360, Battlefield Hardline there as well and Biohazard Revelations Final Fantasy

01:32:57.160 --> 01:33:02.640
Type 0 HD and Azito Cross Tatsunoko Legends comes out over there.

01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:06.160
I did not know that was even something they were making, so that's pretty cool.

01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:11.280
On the PlayStation 3, Battlefield Hardline and Biohazard Revelations 2.

01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:15.120
And on the Wii U this week in Japan, I think we finally have some releases over there.

01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:19.560
We have Mario versus Donkey Kong, Mina de Mini Land comes out in Japan.

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:21.260
I imagine that's...

01:33:21.260 --> 01:33:24.560
They have the Mario versus Donkey Kong, it's like the puzzle series.

01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:27.600
I imagine that's like an entry in that on the Wii U.

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:31.280
And that's the big release on the Wii U this week in Japan.

01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:35.280
And lastly, looking at the handhelds here, we've got on the PlayStation Vita this week,

01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:43.680
Norn 9, Norn plus Nonet Last Era, Phantasy Star Online 2 Episode 3 Deluxe Package, pardon

01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:47.840
me while I fume that Phantasy Star Online Episode 2 is still not out over here.

01:33:47.840 --> 01:33:48.840
Phantasy...

01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:51.640
Excuse me, Phantasy Star Online 2 is still not out over here.

01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:55.760
That was you shitting your pants.

01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:56.760
Very upset.

01:33:56.760 --> 01:34:02.760
Minecraft PlayStation Vita comes out in Japan, and Iro Toridori no Sekai Worlds End Rebirth

01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:05.360
comes out on the Vita this week as well.

01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:11.000
Lastly, checking the 3DS, the 3DS this week gets Devil Summoner Soul Hackers, gets a price

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:16.080
reduction going into the best collection from Atlus, Mario versus Donkey Kong, Mina de Mini

01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:17.080
Land.

01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:20.680
I think that's the game with the cross-buy on Nintendo, I think that's what Japan's getting

01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:24.800
this week, because it's on 3DS and it's on the Wii U.

01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:32.040
Prepara and Pretty Rhythm, Prepara de Sukairu Oshare Item 1450.

01:34:32.040 --> 01:34:36.000
I don't know what Item 1450 is, but my god is this game pink.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:37.680
I kind of want it.

01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:38.680
You should get it.

01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:39.680
It looks like a rhythm game.

01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:42.440
It kind of looks like a rhythm game, like a Leap Eat Agents, but all the little icons

01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:46.520
are hearts, and she sparkles, and like a Leap Eat Agents, there's like a dude in a little

01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:49.100
beret, like he's dancing, like, hey, I'm dancing.

01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:50.200
So you're totally getting it.

01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:53.480
I totally want this, actually, Prepara and Pretty Rhythm.

01:34:53.480 --> 01:34:55.800
Akuma JP, is this something I want?

01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:59.680
I have to ask our Japanese correspondent, because he's actually, he would know.

01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:02.080
Hai, sou desu ne.

01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:06.560
Thank you, Akuma.

01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:11.200
Moving on, that was it for releases, but I do want to talk about the UK, I know Dark

01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:16.960
Sakura's not here tonight, but she will usually talk about what is coming out in the UK, and

01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:24.240
for March the 19th, Worlds of Magic on the Mac and the PC, and on the 20th of March,

01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:30.600
Battlefield Hardline on everything, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One PC, Blade Storm Nightmare,

01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:36.520
Final Fantasy Type 0 HD, Mario Party 10, and Mario vs. Donkey Kong Tipping Stars, which

01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:40.840
is that same game as the Japanese one I was talking about, and Akuma JP has answered my

01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:44.640
question as to is this game worth my time, and he says no.

01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:45.640
Whatever.

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:47.920
You can't listen anymore.

01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:50.480
You do know I love Hatsune Miku, right?

01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:53.720
And I like some real bad games, I'm just saying.

01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:54.720
I think you should just...

01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:56.400
I did just sit here and talk about how much I love Friday the 13th.

01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:00.080
Did you not even pick up that Sanrio game that was on the 3DS?

01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:01.080
I wanted to.

01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:04.600
I kind of want that more than I want Project Steam right now, but...

01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:05.600
What game is this?

01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:06.600
Is it the racing game?

01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:07.600
The Sanrio racing game.

01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:09.080
Oh my god, it looks so bad.

01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:12.240
It looks like an eight year old programmed it.

01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:13.240
It looks so bad.

01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:14.440
So that means he wants it.

01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:15.440
Exactly.

01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:16.440
I get it.

01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:17.440
I should.

01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:18.440
So I can play it.

01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:19.440
Exactly.

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:20.440
Aha!

01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:23.800
Alright, let's do one more story here and then we'll get to the classic game of the

01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:24.800
week.

01:36:24.800 --> 01:36:30.920
So, unfortunately, one of the first games that Kenji Inafune had mentioned that they

01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:40.920
were working on with his new studio, after he left Konami, Capcom, was Kao King of Pirates.

01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:43.520
That title has been cancelled.

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:49.360
So apparently Marvelous had announced that they are scrapping that title.

01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:50.360
That's unfortunate.

01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:51.360
Yes.

01:36:51.360 --> 01:36:54.140
Especially for all the fans of him.

01:36:54.140 --> 01:36:55.140
That's too bad.

01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:56.140
It looks pretty cool.

01:36:56.140 --> 01:36:58.720
Well, you'll never get to play it.

01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:02.160
Until ten years from now somebody finds it in a vault somewhere and releases it on the

01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:03.160
internet.

01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:04.160
Yeah.

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:05.160
Oh well.

01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:06.160
There's always that to look forward to, right?

01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:11.680
Alright, well let's travel down memory lane and talk about a time that was a little simpler

01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:14.120
in gaming.

01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:16.400
The classic game of the week.

01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:20.120
Back when games came out, even if they were horrible and they weren't scrapped, whatever,

01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:23.240
no actually a lot of games were scrapped back in the day, but this game wasn't scrapped

01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:27.240
and it was great and I'm taking over tonight because usually Dark Sakura would step into

01:37:27.240 --> 01:37:30.200
the vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you should be playing this game this

01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:31.200
week.

01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:37.500
But since she isn't here, I'm stealing her segment, wahaha, with a game that I remember

01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:41.860
And now I'm really regretting this because Irene is going to taunt me endlessly for this

01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:42.860
pick.

01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:43.860
Yay!

01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:48.660
Although, I honestly don't think you know this game whatsoever, but this game was rad.

01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:49.660
God.

01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:50.780
Alright, this game was rad.

01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:51.780
I love this game.

01:37:51.780 --> 01:37:55.820
I played a lot of it when I was growing up.

01:37:55.820 --> 01:37:58.020
It is a PC game I've picked tonight.

01:37:58.020 --> 01:38:00.180
It is a Sierra game that I've picked.

01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:02.660
You're making a face there.

01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:07.300
The classic game of the week this week is...

01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:08.300
Jones in the Fastlane.

01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:09.300
Oh, God.

01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:12.700
Have you ever played Jones in the Fastlane?

01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:14.860
No, I don't play crap.

01:38:14.860 --> 01:38:16.340
You don't even know what this game is.

01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:17.340
This game is amazing.

01:38:17.340 --> 01:38:18.340
Exactly.

01:38:18.340 --> 01:38:19.340
Shut up.

01:38:19.340 --> 01:38:20.340
You don't know what you're talking about.

01:38:20.340 --> 01:38:21.340
Alright.

01:38:21.340 --> 01:38:22.340
You don't know me.

01:38:22.340 --> 01:38:23.340
Are we going to get dysentery?

01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:24.340
You might, from this game.

01:38:24.340 --> 01:38:25.340
Okay, here it is.

01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:30.520
Jones in the Fastlane was a game that was created by Sierra in 1990 and it was kind

01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:33.440
of like a board game-ish type of game.

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:35.680
Is it because the people who played it were really bored?

01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:39.320
No, like a Monopoly type of board game.

01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:43.620
This game also was notable because there was a floppy disk version that would allow people

01:38:43.620 --> 01:38:45.900
to have the little speech bubbles when they talked to me.

01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:47.960
What's a floppy disk?

01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:50.120
It's... you stick it in.

01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:54.640
It's a little disk and you stick it in and it's full of data.

01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:59.060
So like, you know when you save in Word or something and there's that little symbol that

01:38:59.060 --> 01:39:00.760
nobody knows what it is.

01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:01.760
Nobody knows what that is.

01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:03.340
That's totally a floppy disk.

01:39:03.340 --> 01:39:04.340
What?

01:39:04.340 --> 01:39:05.340
Right.

01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:06.900
You mean that same thing?

01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:09.420
How the fuck do you not know what a floppy disk is?

01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:11.240
You're older than me.

01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:12.500
Not to like put you on blast or something.

01:39:12.500 --> 01:39:14.260
She's only interested in hard drives.

01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:15.260
Yeah.

01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:16.260
Hard drives.

01:39:16.260 --> 01:39:17.260
I see what you did there.

01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:18.260
Alright, look.

01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:20.500
Can I talk about Jones in the Fastlane, please?

01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:24.940
Not only was it a game that you could get on floppy disk, but it was on CD-ROM.

01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:28.420
And if you got it on CD, it was completely voice acted.

01:39:28.420 --> 01:39:32.780
All the little employees of the little places you would go on the board, such as Monolith

01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:37.340
Burger and Socket City, would actually talk to you.

01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:40.300
Oh, this does not sound good at all.

01:39:40.300 --> 01:39:42.780
No, this game was amazing.

01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:43.780
Was it?

01:39:43.780 --> 01:39:50.980
Stop making fun of this game with, you know, Monolith Burger and Z-Mart and QT clothing.

01:39:50.980 --> 01:39:54.540
Oh god, it's hurting so bad.

01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:58.300
So what you did is you moved your little marble because that's what represented you

01:39:58.300 --> 01:39:59.340
like a real board game.

01:39:59.340 --> 01:40:03.460
You would move it around the board and as you went to these different places on the

01:40:03.460 --> 01:40:05.140
board, you were a marble.

01:40:05.140 --> 01:40:09.860
Yeah, you were represented by a marble, but you actually had a little dude on the screen

01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:14.820
or doodad if you wanted to play, would walk like as the marbles going, the little dude

01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:15.820
would walk.

01:40:15.820 --> 01:40:20.220
It was on CD-ROM and it had voice acting and you were represented by a marble.

01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:27.820
Because that was supposed to give it the board game feel also because we didn't want

01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:35.380
to animate anything, but what board game has a fucking marble?

01:40:35.380 --> 01:40:37.860
Your pieces will just roll off the game.

01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:40.460
Mouse trap doesn't have a packman board game.

01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:43.620
It's like a hundred marbles, but it's not your piece.

01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:45.980
What activated the goddamn mouse trap?

01:40:45.980 --> 01:40:47.460
It was a fucking marble, Irene.

01:40:47.460 --> 01:40:49.940
But did it have one that you moved around?

01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:50.940
I don't know.

01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:51.940
I don't know.

01:40:51.940 --> 01:40:52.940
Okay.

01:40:52.940 --> 01:40:53.940
I fucking own the mouse trap.

01:40:53.940 --> 01:40:54.940
Rob.

01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:57.340
Don't fucking try to school me on my own games.

01:40:57.340 --> 01:40:58.340
Okay.

01:40:58.340 --> 01:40:59.340
Okay.

01:40:59.340 --> 01:41:02.420
That is the least logical piece.

01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:03.420
I feel like for a board game.

01:41:03.420 --> 01:41:04.700
I'm going to put this on a board.

01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:06.580
Thank God my board is completely level.

01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:07.580
Oh, wait.

01:41:07.580 --> 01:41:08.820
It just rolled off the board.

01:41:08.820 --> 01:41:11.020
Oh, there I go down the hill.

01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:12.020
Right.

01:41:12.020 --> 01:41:18.180
That just would not be my first or second or like ten thousandth choice for a piece.

01:41:18.180 --> 01:41:20.660
Anyway, monolith burger or something.

01:41:20.660 --> 01:41:21.660
Yeah.

01:41:21.660 --> 01:41:22.660
Burger time.

01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:27.940
So look, you move around the board with your marble with and you're only limited by whatever

01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:30.180
time is left in the week in a turn.

01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:33.620
And when you move to a new location, you lose a little bit of time and you do things that

01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:35.740
you would do like IRL.

01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:41.180
You would work or you would try to get an education or you would just sleep all day.

01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:42.180
You can also.

01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:43.180
That's what I would do.

01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:44.180
I know.

01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:45.180
I know that.

01:41:45.180 --> 01:41:46.180
So your marble wouldn't go anywhere.

01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:50.020
Your marble would be calling the cable company going, I want my HBO.

01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:56.060
I can't afford cable.

01:41:56.060 --> 01:42:00.100
And then at the end of every turn, you would be going through the oh, what a weekend event

01:42:00.100 --> 01:42:04.420
where you would lose money usually or you might gain money depending on what you did

01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:05.420
that week.

01:42:05.420 --> 01:42:08.180
What if you're sleeping and then how would you lose money?

01:42:08.180 --> 01:42:09.420
It's like a monopoly.

01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:12.980
You draw a card and you can win ten dollars in a beauty contest, even if you wouldn't

01:42:12.980 --> 01:42:13.980
actually.

01:42:13.980 --> 01:42:15.940
It's weird because I never left my house.

01:42:15.940 --> 01:42:20.460
It's like, did they come into my house and see me on my bed and they're like, man, you're

01:42:20.460 --> 01:42:21.460
so beautiful.

01:42:21.460 --> 01:42:22.460
Here's ten dollars.

01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:23.980
That seems kind of creepy.

01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:28.220
Well, you would get little humorous anecdotes that was very common for Sierra at the time.

01:42:28.220 --> 01:42:32.940
For example, you went to Las Vegas in a twenty thousand dollar car and then you came back

01:42:32.940 --> 01:42:35.940
in a two hundred thousand dollar Greyhound bus.

01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:37.460
That's huh.

01:42:37.460 --> 01:42:38.460
Get it?

01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:39.460
Clever.

01:42:39.460 --> 01:42:40.460
You lost the car because you went to.

01:42:40.460 --> 01:42:41.460
Yeah.

01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:42.460
No, I get it.

01:42:42.460 --> 01:42:43.460
I'm on board.

01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:45.940
Dude, where's your car?

01:42:45.940 --> 01:42:49.740
The object of the game is to be the first player to achieve one hundred percent success.

01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:56.020
You reach four goals, wealth, happiness, education and career by having a certain amount of money

01:42:56.020 --> 01:43:02.320
in the bank, happiness by getting other goals like acquiring goods and taking time off work,

01:43:02.320 --> 01:43:07.420
education by going through all the university things and then career by climbing the career

01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:13.780
ladder into management participation or whatever at the job.

01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:16.180
So it sounds like the game of life.

01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:17.180
It kind of is.

01:43:17.180 --> 01:43:19.100
Monopoly and marbles.

01:43:19.100 --> 01:43:24.500
It's like it's like life, monopoly and marbles all together without the pink peg and the

01:43:24.500 --> 01:43:26.140
blue peg that you put in your car.

01:43:26.140 --> 01:43:27.140
That's the only thing.

01:43:27.140 --> 01:43:28.140
You have a marble instead.

01:43:28.140 --> 01:43:29.140
No deal then.

01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:30.140
All right.

01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:33.020
Anyway, sometimes you can lose the game as well.

01:43:33.020 --> 01:43:38.160
For example, you can get your money stolen by Wild Willy and Wild Willy may actually

01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:46.340
rip off Wild Willy may actually rip you off at the low cost housing apartments and might

01:43:46.340 --> 01:43:48.260
steal your TV and your VCR.

01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:49.260
I'm sorry.

01:43:49.260 --> 01:43:50.260
This is horrible.

01:43:50.260 --> 01:43:52.880
I stole the TV.

01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:54.980
This is no.

01:43:54.980 --> 01:43:58.840
But Wild Willy can never get into the security apartments.

01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:02.020
So there you go.

01:44:02.020 --> 01:44:06.260
The game was notable for having a voice actors that were actually like they were actually

01:44:06.260 --> 01:44:09.980
like motion captured and they actually would talk through some of the silly little jokes

01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:12.140
in the game and so forth.

01:44:12.140 --> 01:44:16.500
But if you were too poor for a CD-ROM drive, which a lot of us were at the time, you could

01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:18.820
get the version that was on floppy disk.

01:44:18.820 --> 01:44:20.420
Why did you look at me when you said that?

01:44:20.420 --> 01:44:21.420
I'm just saying.

01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:22.420
Fuck Rob.

01:44:22.420 --> 01:44:23.420
Just wanted you to know.

01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:24.860
Because you're a poor college student.

01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:28.020
Just because someone lives in Section 8 housing doesn't mean they're a criminal.

01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:29.020
Okay.

01:44:29.020 --> 01:44:30.020
I'm just going to put that out there.

01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:32.220
What a terrible game.

01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:33.940
All right.

01:44:33.940 --> 01:44:37.580
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:41.460
Bobby is saying this is the first classic game of the week where the host bashed a choice

01:44:41.460 --> 01:44:42.460
frown.

01:44:42.460 --> 01:44:46.820
Hey, first off, those two aren't hosts.

01:44:46.820 --> 01:44:48.060
And now you know why.

01:44:48.060 --> 01:44:50.660
It just sounds terrible.

01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:52.180
And B, you need to play it.

01:44:52.180 --> 01:44:56.780
And Bobby is actually going on to say, really sucks that people on the show are bashing

01:44:56.780 --> 01:44:58.140
it and calling it horrible.

01:44:58.140 --> 01:44:59.660
This game was actually really awesome.

01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:01.420
And I actually agree.

01:45:01.420 --> 01:45:04.620
It's you never, you weren't even around to play this game.

01:45:04.620 --> 01:45:06.860
That's why you never got a chance to get obsessed with it.

01:45:06.860 --> 01:45:08.540
Well, yeah, because I was poor growing up.

01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:10.860
I had like a cardboard box for a computer.

01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:13.900
So don't be mad at the people that can play Jones in the fast lane.

01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:20.020
Just because to your description of the game, Rob, that's the only experience I have.

01:45:20.020 --> 01:45:22.100
And it sounds preposterous.

01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:23.100
It's not preposterous.

01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:24.980
Do you want a handful of ketchup packets with that?

01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:28.420
I read off the screen just now.

01:45:28.420 --> 01:45:31.980
You lost me at marble is what I'm saying.

01:45:31.980 --> 01:45:34.820
But do you not see the little animated characters that walk on the screen as well?

01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:38.740
I do, but I also see the marble very clearly and it's kind of just clouding.

01:45:38.740 --> 01:45:40.340
The marble's just distracting.

01:45:40.340 --> 01:45:42.260
You are really bothered by that damn marble, aren't you?

01:45:42.260 --> 01:45:43.260
I'm so fucking bothered by it.

01:45:43.260 --> 01:45:45.540
You've lost your marbles.

01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:48.340
You have a degree in junior college.

01:45:48.340 --> 01:45:49.780
That's going to do a lot for you.

01:45:49.780 --> 01:45:50.780
The junior college.

01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:55.060
Oh, this was like in the what, 90s or something or late 80s?

01:45:55.060 --> 01:45:57.540
Anyway, 1990 is when this game came out.

01:45:57.540 --> 01:45:59.740
Yeah, so that would have actually had some value.

01:45:59.740 --> 01:46:02.340
And he didn't get the job because he didn't have enough education.

01:46:02.340 --> 01:46:03.340
Dumbass.

01:46:03.340 --> 01:46:05.060
All right.

01:46:05.060 --> 01:46:06.060
There it is.

01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:07.060
Your classic game of the week.

01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:10.260
Jones and the fast lane, which don't listen to these three.

01:46:10.260 --> 01:46:13.060
This game is actually a lot of fun.

01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:15.060
It's on YouTube, but you can also check out.

01:46:15.060 --> 01:46:18.020
Apparently they did like a flash remake of it.

01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:21.260
Not that long ago in 2006, I guess it was a little while ago.

01:46:21.260 --> 01:46:23.980
They actually ported this like a version of it over to flash.

01:46:23.980 --> 01:46:24.980
So you can check this out.

01:46:24.980 --> 01:46:29.580
Although I don't believe that is something that is officially endorsed, but you can draw

01:46:29.580 --> 01:46:34.060
your own conclusions by looking it up on like YouTube or I'm just checking out, you know,

01:46:34.060 --> 01:46:35.540
it makes this game better.

01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:36.540
Hmm.

01:46:36.540 --> 01:46:38.100
It had amiibo support.

01:46:38.100 --> 01:46:40.900
No, no amiibo support in this game.

01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:41.900
And there you go.

01:46:41.900 --> 01:46:43.820
That's why I just can't play it then.

01:46:43.820 --> 01:46:44.820
All right.

01:46:44.820 --> 01:46:45.820
Sorry to hear that.

01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:48.660
I also probably can't play because my computer is probably way too fast for that now.

01:46:48.660 --> 01:46:52.060
And you know, I want me to say, you know, those old games, you try to play them now.

01:46:52.060 --> 01:46:54.300
It's just like, sorry, your computer's too good to play this.

01:46:54.300 --> 01:46:59.060
I'm not, I don't think this particular game is available on like good old games, but one

01:46:59.060 --> 01:47:02.940
of those ones that was archive, didn't they have like that big internet game archive thing

01:47:02.940 --> 01:47:05.300
that, uh, oh, good question.

01:47:05.300 --> 01:47:09.780
Uh, I w there were other Sierra games from that timeframe on it, so I don't see why Jones

01:47:09.780 --> 01:47:10.780
wouldn't be on there.

01:47:10.780 --> 01:47:11.780
We'll check it out there.

01:47:11.780 --> 01:47:15.260
Lobby desk version, not the CD version, cause that would be too much space.

01:47:15.260 --> 01:47:16.420
All right.

01:47:16.420 --> 01:47:18.180
Not that much space nowadays on the internet.

01:47:18.180 --> 01:47:19.740
So all right.

01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:20.740
Well stay tuned guys.

01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:21.900
We've got plenty more show to come.

01:47:21.900 --> 01:47:26.380
We have some rapid fire news, the Fuqua question of the week and some more news mailbag a few

01:47:26.380 --> 01:47:27.380
of the weeks.

01:47:27.380 --> 01:47:31.020
And yes, a chance for you to call in when we come back after this with more of orange

01:47:31.020 --> 01:47:39.640

01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:45.780
Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live on this March the 15th of 2015 with episode

01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:49.460
number 590 of our show in progress.

01:47:49.460 --> 01:47:53.980
Uh, Loki here with me tonight, not here tonight, dark Sakura.

01:47:53.980 --> 01:47:59.260
Um, but here joining us in studio, um, Irene and mystique who have for the first time in

01:47:59.260 --> 01:48:06.720
our 590 a year history, uh, ruined the classic game of the week segment here on orange lounge

01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:07.720
radio.

01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:08.720
You're gonna have to get used to it.

01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:09.720
That's all right.

01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:13.180
Actually, we were talking off air a little bit about like, you know, I was kinda like,

01:48:13.180 --> 01:48:17.420
now, now seriously now this is why people love this game with the whole like Sierra

01:48:17.420 --> 01:48:18.420
era and all that.

01:48:18.460 --> 01:48:20.660
But you were mentioning you play King's quest.

01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:21.940
So you know that era a little bit.

01:48:21.940 --> 01:48:22.940
I do.

01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:23.940
I do.

01:48:23.940 --> 01:48:24.940
Yeah.

01:48:24.940 --> 01:48:27.460
I mean, who hates King quest King's quest for now I might let you get away with that

01:48:27.460 --> 01:48:31.820
sass with Jones and the fast lane, but if this was King's quest for I talked about tonight,

01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:33.340
I would not be having that sass.

01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:37.700
There was one that I remember where like you start off in the town and blah, blah, blah.

01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:40.920
And then there was this pier that you could walk to see that you could go on the ship

01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:43.100
and then sail to another Island or something.

01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:47.340
And then there was like this one part where this kid like tempts you to take a swim.

01:48:47.340 --> 01:48:48.340
I'm almost positive.

01:48:49.260 --> 01:48:50.260
I think it is five.

01:48:50.260 --> 01:48:54.420
And then like you just jump in and you die and it's like, I'm pretty sure it's five.

01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:55.420
Like I was so mad.

01:48:55.420 --> 01:48:59.460
I was a lot of King's quest games though, but I just, I guess that was my first experience

01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:00.460
and I was just so mad.

01:49:00.460 --> 01:49:04.260
I was like, I was not expecting that cause it was just stupid.

01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:07.460
There was a certain level of dark humor in a lot of those old Sierra games.

01:49:07.460 --> 01:49:11.700
You know, it just, I didn't know what triggered it or anything.

01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:15.100
It was just, I came out of the boat and he's like, Oh, it looks like a really nice day

01:49:15.100 --> 01:49:16.100
for a swim.

01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:19.620
I think I'm going to go commit suicide now.

01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:21.540
You don't notice the little shark fan in the background.

01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:22.540
Anyway.

01:49:22.540 --> 01:49:23.540
No, no, I guess I'm stupid.

01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:24.540
All right.

01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:28.500
Uh, anyhow, I know you, you gals can't stay a whole lot longer, but I do want to make

01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:31.060
sure Irene, you have a chance to plug cause you do your own podcast.

01:49:31.060 --> 01:49:33.260
I want to make sure you have a chance to plug it.

01:49:33.260 --> 01:49:37.220
Um, I just saw Piper not that long ago and I know he's on the show as well.

01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:38.900
So tell us about, uh, multi-tap.

01:49:38.900 --> 01:49:39.980
Oh, okay.

01:49:39.980 --> 01:49:42.160
So it's like a video game podcast.

01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:44.580
It's kind of retro, but kind of not.

01:49:44.580 --> 01:49:47.620
Let me just kind of talk about whatever we want cause we're like that.

01:49:47.620 --> 01:49:53.380
Um, so it's at ffop.net, which is short for fistful of potions.

01:49:53.380 --> 01:49:56.220
You could also do fistfulofpotions.net, I guess.

01:49:56.220 --> 01:49:57.220
I don't know.

01:49:57.220 --> 01:50:02.780
Um, so come and listen to us cause we're cool and fun and interesting.

01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:07.300
Now, now when do I get to come on your show and sass all the games that you like?

01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:08.740
When the fuck ever you want.

01:50:08.740 --> 01:50:09.740
Awesome.

01:50:09.740 --> 01:50:10.740
I can't wait.

01:50:10.740 --> 01:50:14.380
You won't because all of our games are perfect and beautiful.

01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:18.220
Unless you're having the Super Metroid special when I'm there, I'll find something.

01:50:18.220 --> 01:50:19.220
We might.

01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:21.700
We love Super Metroid in the house.

01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:22.700
I'd be okay with that.

01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:23.700
I'd be okay with that.

01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:24.700
All right.

01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:27.860
Uh, anyhow, tonight, uh, we do not actually have a forum followup segment tonight since

01:50:27.860 --> 01:50:29.420
we had last week's show off.

01:50:29.420 --> 01:50:32.420
We're going to table that to next week, but don't forget that you can participate in our

01:50:32.420 --> 01:50:36.560
forums over at vog network.com slash forums, and we will definitely post some followup

01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:39.100
topics for us to expand the conversation on.

01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:43.020
I'm really anticipating we're going to talk a little more on the forums about this whole

01:50:43.020 --> 01:50:47.500
Konami and programmed world thing because, uh, just the fact that even I admitted there

01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:49.280
really is not an easy answer to this.

01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:53.220
I can really truly see like both sides of it where it's like on one hand, I understand

01:50:53.220 --> 01:50:57.260
how, you know, Konami wants to protect, you know, some of the revenue that they get in

01:50:57.260 --> 01:51:01.740
Japan and these other agreements, but at the same time, gamers desperate to play these

01:51:01.740 --> 01:51:04.700
games that get their only option really cut off.

01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:06.180
So I want to talk and dive deeper into that.

01:51:06.180 --> 01:51:09.300
So we'll do that on the forums and we'll talk about some of that follow up next week.

01:51:09.300 --> 01:51:12.380
Uh, but for now we have some rapid fire news.

01:51:12.380 --> 01:51:14.340
So some quick news stories starting with Loki.

01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:15.340
All right.

01:51:15.340 --> 01:51:19.140
Um, so let's start off with, I'm pretty excited about this.

01:51:19.140 --> 01:51:23.820
Goat Simulator is coming to Xbox one and Xbox 360 cause it runs like shit on my PC.

01:51:23.820 --> 01:51:29.460
So I'm, I'm down with that and that's going to be sometime in April and they're promising

01:51:29.460 --> 01:51:32.820
it'll be just as buggy as it is on PC.

01:51:32.820 --> 01:51:34.980
Will it have all the extra stuff that they put in like the MMO?

01:51:34.980 --> 01:51:35.980
I think it will, yeah.

01:51:35.980 --> 01:51:36.980
Oh God, that's great.

01:51:36.980 --> 01:51:39.100
So I will definitely be picking that up.

01:51:39.180 --> 01:51:44.300
I think you would like, uh, Goat Simulator, Irene, it's a stupid, stupid game.

01:51:44.300 --> 01:51:45.300
Yeah.

01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:46.300
You like stupid stuff.

01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:47.300
I do.

01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:48.300
That's why I'm friends with you.

01:51:48.300 --> 01:51:52.940
You fucking set that up Rob, that was your own fault.

01:51:52.940 --> 01:51:53.940
I don't think you're stupid.

01:51:53.940 --> 01:51:54.940
You're cool Rob.

01:51:54.940 --> 01:52:01.260
And in fan service game news, uh, Oni Chambara Z2 is going to be headed, um, to North America

01:52:01.260 --> 01:52:02.260
this summer.

01:52:02.260 --> 01:52:06.960
Um, Europe, it's going to be out in the fall and if you're not familiar with Oni Chambara,

01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:12.240
it's basically some chick wearing a really skimpy lingerie and a cowboy hat fighting

01:52:12.240 --> 01:52:14.800
monsters with a samurai sword.

01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:15.800
All right.

01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:16.800
I'm in.

01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:17.800
How's that different from Oni Chambara?

01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:19.800
No, I know Oni Chambara.

01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:26.200
They even have DLC outfits that include like one that's two strawberries and a banana.

01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:27.840
That is all that's covering them up.

01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:28.840
Two strawberries and banana.

01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:29.840
Alrighty.

01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:40.160
Um, and then on the 3DS, uh, Senren Kagura 2 is coming, um, this summer to the 3DS and

01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:43.720
they're also having some special editions coming out with that as well.

01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:49.180
Uh, the Double D and Happy Boobs edition will be coming out.

01:52:49.180 --> 01:52:51.320
So it's about me?

01:52:51.320 --> 01:52:56.560
It's about, yeah, it's about, uh, chicks that fight each other in their clothes.

01:52:56.560 --> 01:53:00.640
All you single fellas, um, they're talking about me.

01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:08.040
I don't know what you're talking about because I'm gay and I play this game, so it sounds

01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:09.040
like fun.

01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:10.040
All right.

01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:13.320
But I'm also for equal opportunity, so I believe we should have men and the clothes fly off

01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:14.320
as well.

01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:15.320
I agree.

01:53:15.320 --> 01:53:16.320
I'm all for that.

01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:17.320
I would play that game.

01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:23.920
That would be, um, uh, Akiba, Akibahara, um, or Akiba's Trip.

01:53:23.920 --> 01:53:24.920
That's what it was.

01:53:24.920 --> 01:53:27.080
Sexual Close Tossing Part 3.

01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:28.080
I don't know.

01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:29.080
Akiba's Trip.

01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:30.080
That would be the one you'd want to play.

01:53:30.080 --> 01:53:31.080
That's what it translates to.

01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:32.080
Anyways.

01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:35.400
Um, and then of course they have, uh, Chroma Squad that's going to be coming out April

01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:36.400
30th.

01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:42.600
This was the Kickstarter game that was kind of like a, uh, Super Sentai sim, if you will.

01:53:42.600 --> 01:53:49.440
Um, and that's going to be coming out on PC, Mac, and Linux April 30th, so, um, Shane will

01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:50.440
be happy about that.

01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:51.440
I'm sure he will.

01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:55.760
Um, talking about 3DS, uh, and the SpotPass.

01:53:55.760 --> 01:53:57.380
There is a SpotPass exploit.

01:53:57.380 --> 01:54:01.840
This actually pisses me off, kinda, because, and I know the old saying hackers gonna hack

01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:02.840
and I get it.

01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:06.480
And I also know it wasn't even a hack, it's just a glitch.

01:54:06.480 --> 01:54:07.480
I know.

01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:08.480
Well, it still sucks.

01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:13.160
And I know this sucks for, uh, you know, people who might live in areas where they hardly ever

01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:17.960
street pass with people, but look, one of my crowning achievements of PAX East is that

01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:23.760
I finished all those fucking puzzles, finally, 1,502 pieces, mine.

01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:28.400
I have every puzzle finished, including the one that those jerks at Nintendo dropped on

01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:33.360
us Sunday morning, the day of the show, the new Monster Hunter puzzle, finished them all.

01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:37.840
And now to hear that, oh, thanks to this exploit, people will just be able to do that.

01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:39.560
Well, alright, alright, here's the deal.

01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:44.280
Uh, you use your special Mii character, like, uh, the Abraham Lincoln Mii that's sent to

01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:48.560
promote codename Steam in all the StreetPass minigames you own.

01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:55.320
You turn off StreetPass and SpotPass, delete the Mii, close Mii Plaza, open it again and

01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:59.400
reactivate, and the Mii character will come right back.

01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:03.360
So you basically tricked the system into thinking you never got the character in the first place

01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:05.840
by deleting all traces of it.

01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:10.320
And, uh, there's, uh, more information on the glitch if you wanna see it on YouTube,

01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:13.480
and I realize you might be thinking, well, then why are you sharing it here, Rob, on

01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:15.120
how to do it if it makes you mad?

01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:19.040
Because it's not like y'all don't know how to use Google, you'd find it anyway, but that's

01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:21.080
essentially how you do it.

01:55:21.080 --> 01:55:22.560
But, uh, you know what?

01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:26.900
My achievement is better than yours if you do this to get all your puzzle pieces.

01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:28.240
My achievement's better than yours.

01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:29.240
Uh, nuh-huh.

01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:30.240
How many puzzle pieces do you have?

01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:32.240
Well, I'm gonna get them all now.

01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:33.800
Yeah, thank you, Rob.

01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:34.800
Ditto.

01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:35.800
Cheating cheaters.

01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:36.800
Alright.

01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:37.800
Anyhow, well, you know what?

01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:40.320
My 3DS has a dead battery right now, so you won't be getting any from me.

01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:41.720
Did you even bring your 3DS?

01:55:41.720 --> 01:55:42.720
No.

01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:44.960
Mine played that for, like, five months.

01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:45.960
Jeez.

01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:46.960
Yeah.

01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:47.960
Anyway.

01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:48.960
Aw, you played longer than me.

01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:49.960
I think this is really cool.

01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:55.000
Um, this is an innovation in the arcade and, uh, in the arcade industry, and it has to

01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:00.680
do with, uh, more, um, I guess, I don't wanna say, like, cross-play, but more, like, I guess,

01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:06.320
synergy between your phone or smart device and the arcade game itself.

01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:10.320
And who knew it's being brought to us from the music game world and an indie in the music

01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:13.600
game world that we hear about all the time, Neon FM.

01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:17.200
I mean, we were hearing about this game, like, 10 years ago, and it seems like now we've

01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:19.920
got this arcade prototype that's going with it.

01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:23.960
And the cool thing about Neon FM and what they're showing, and I gotta admit, I really

01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:29.160
enjoyed this, was that, um, Unit E Technologies, who's, uh, making this game, they're going

01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:34.040
to be linking the arcade version of the game and a smartphone version of the game.

01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:37.640
So what you do is, I guess, you, like, you scan a QR code and you can get your avatar

01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:40.440
and all your information in the game that it imports from your app.

01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:44.880
But this is really cool as well, is that if the smartphone app recognizes that you're

01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:50.480
near the machine, I guess, through a Wi-Fi connection or something that it would identify,

01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:55.680
you can actually play the songs on your phone that the person is playing on the machine

01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:57.160
at the same time.

01:56:57.160 --> 01:57:00.320
And then the score that you get on your phone is displayed on the screen.

01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:05.120
So like, remember back in the day when Para Para Paradise was the, Paradise, Para Para

01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:07.520
Paradise was the big game that everybody was playing.

01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:08.520
And like, what would happen?

01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:12.440
One person would be dancing on the machine and everybody else behind them doing the same

01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:13.440
thing.

01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:17.600
Now it's kind of like that, but with your smartphone, you're playing the game and then

01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:19.440
all the scores display on the screen.

01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:23.600
So I think that's kind of, kind of neat, kind of a different way to do it.

01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:24.600
Yeah.

01:57:24.600 --> 01:57:27.720
So something kind of new and, you know, props to these guys for being the ones to bring

01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:28.720
it to.

01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:33.000
I'm glad they're doing it, but at the same time, I think it also kind of, I mean, not

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:37.640
that it really needs to have them do it, but it kind of promotes that, oh, let's put

01:57:37.640 --> 01:57:42.000
more smartphone games in the arcade, like, you know, the fucking Fruit Ninja and Doodle

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.400
Jump and that nonsense.

01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:46.680
Now it's like, have it at the same time.

01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:50.980
It's really exciting to kind of hear about all these initiatives to kind of bring the

01:57:50.980 --> 01:57:52.240
arcade back.

01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:57.120
You know, despite however you feel about the Konami situation, the deal is that you have

01:57:57.120 --> 01:58:01.400
this company, Round One, that's trying to bring that arcade thing back, you know, to

01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:04.960
all these different places around the country, and that's cool.

01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:07.960
And then you have this, where you talk about, like, this is a new innovation to try and

01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:11.400
energize, you know, participation at the arcade.

01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:15.580
And I think these are ideas that are going to push things forward as opposed to falling

01:58:15.580 --> 01:58:20.260
further down this hole of ticket redemption games and nothing but, you know, Las Vegas

01:58:20.260 --> 01:58:22.120
for children, apparently.

01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:27.900
Anyway, Bonds006 in the chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com saying, Neon FM is the shit.

01:58:27.900 --> 01:58:31.160
You get the QR code, QR code, excuse me, and when you make an account, you can track your

01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:32.160
progress.

01:58:32.160 --> 01:58:35.680
Neon FM is a damn great game, too bad Konami tried to kill it.

01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:38.880
And Dark Tetsuya saying, I thought this was a great idea.

01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:44.920
So some people are really liking that idea, I'd like to play this someday, we'll see.

01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:52.080
Also, this week, a game called Roundabout, which is available on Xbox One, Steam, and

01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:57.640
the Humble Store, the ESRB changed Roundabout's rating.

01:58:57.640 --> 01:59:03.400
Roundabout is no longer T for teen, it is now M for mature, and this is due to the volume

01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:06.200
of blood in the game.

01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:13.720
Roundabout having more blood than Dark Souls 2, but not as much as Bloodborne, and also

01:59:13.720 --> 01:59:15.520
less bloody than Manhunt 2.

01:59:15.520 --> 01:59:19.560
This is all, by the way, these comparisons being made by the developer in a statement

01:59:19.560 --> 01:59:22.400
on their website, roundaboutgame.tumblr.com.

01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:27.280
I'm sorry, can you scroll back up, I need to see their banner or whatever.

01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:30.840
I don't know if this is like cosplays, but it's a Tumblr page, I don't know.

01:59:30.840 --> 01:59:32.160
No, it's actually in the game.

01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:33.160
Is it?

01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:34.160
I haven't played this game.

01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:40.040
The whole premise of the game is that you're driving the world's first revolving limo.

01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:43.360
So the limo spins, and it runs over things.

01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:48.720
But it's kind of like a, like almost a public game, but the whole thing has full motion

01:59:48.720 --> 01:59:53.880
video cinematics in it that are really cheesy, like from the 70s and stuff like that.

01:59:53.880 --> 01:59:55.880
I need to see this, I'm gonna check this one out.

01:59:55.880 --> 01:59:57.680
Now you have really piqued my interest.

01:59:57.680 --> 01:59:58.680
I know, right?

01:59:58.680 --> 02:00:03.320
When I hear this news about a game, like it was too violent, I'm like, ooh, maybe I should

02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:04.320
be playing it.

02:00:04.320 --> 02:00:05.320
I don't know.

02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:06.320
Yeah, like, okay, here's the premise right here.

02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:11.280
Okay, so it's, it's, you know, roundabout is a 70s B-movie game where you drive a constantly

02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:16.040
revolving limousine, pick up passengers, find secret collectibles, take on dangerous missions,

02:00:16.040 --> 02:00:19.960
fall in love in an open world puzzle adventure.

02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:21.960
Sounds right up my alley.

02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:23.640
That sounds like it's calling my name.

02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:24.640
Yeah.

02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:28.200
It's the company that made that game Gun Stringer.

02:00:28.200 --> 02:00:29.200
Remember that one?

02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:30.200
The one that was a Kinect game?

02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:31.200
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:37.040
Well, as if violence wasn't enough, the game was also slapped with a use of drugs descriptor

02:00:37.040 --> 02:00:41.320
because there are apparently some jokes in the game where one of the characters eats

02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:46.920
candy dots in order to make a skeleton appear and the candy dot supplier turns out that

02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:48.400
he's not a narc.

02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:52.260
And then there's another scene later on where one character describes another as really

02:00:52.260 --> 02:00:53.600
strung out.

02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:59.600
This sounds very incongruous with the rest of the description of the video game, so what

02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:00.600
the hell, guys?

02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:03.800
So not only is there blood, there's a little bit of drugs, too.

02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:04.800
Little bit of drugs.

02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:05.800
Just a little bit.

02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:06.800
Yeah, just a smattering.

02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:07.800
Just enough to get a warning label.

02:01:07.800 --> 02:01:08.800
Not safe for kids.

02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:09.800
Right.

02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:10.800
Right.

02:01:10.800 --> 02:01:11.800
Because the blood wasn't a big-

02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:14.160
They have a dedicated esports speedrun mode.

02:01:14.160 --> 02:01:18.960
They claim it's roundabout as the only official esport endorsed by a talking skeleton.

02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:19.960
Wow.

02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:22.000
That's a distinction right there.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:25.320
So we're going to get to the Fugu question of the week here, but I believe you gals are

02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:26.320
on your way out.

02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:27.320
We've got to head out.

02:01:27.320 --> 02:01:31.600
I know you've got to get your tickets now for when the Marvel show returns to town.

02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:32.600
Right.

02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:33.600
Definitely.

02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:35.720
Now would you go see DC Universe live?

02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:36.720
No.

02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:40.000
And I can say that because I'm a big DC fan.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:41.560
They just mess it up.

02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:42.560
They just mess it up.

02:01:42.560 --> 02:01:43.760
They just fuck everything up basically.

02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:45.280
I'd go for free.

02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:46.280
You'd go for free.

02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:47.920
I wouldn't even go for free.

02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:49.560
Maybe if you won the tickets on the radio.

02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:50.560
Right.

02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:51.560
Not me.

02:01:52.120 --> 02:01:54.680
I certainly wouldn't sit as close as I did.

02:01:54.680 --> 02:01:57.240
What if there was violence and the use of drugs?

02:01:57.240 --> 02:01:58.240
Well then yes.

02:01:58.240 --> 02:01:59.240
Absolutely.

02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:00.240
Wouldn't there be?

02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:01.240
Maybe.

02:02:01.240 --> 02:02:02.240
No.

02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:03.240
All right.

02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:07.440
I always ask our guests at the end of every episode your final thought for the night.

02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:09.240
So I will extend the same courtesy to you ladies.

02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:13.400
Thank you for being here tonight even if you decided to hate on my classic game.

02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:15.200
Mystique, your final thought for the night?

02:02:15.200 --> 02:02:18.920
I am waiting for Batman Arkham Knight.

02:02:18.920 --> 02:02:21.040
I think we all are.

02:02:21.040 --> 02:02:25.360
I won it really bad and they just said it went to M rating and I'm like awesome.

02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:27.480
It was always going to be M rating.

02:02:27.480 --> 02:02:28.480
Oh.

02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:29.480
Awesome.

02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:30.480
Yeah I knew that.

02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:31.480
Awesome.

02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:35.040
And you know maybe it's because of violence and the use of drugs maybe.

02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:36.040
I hope so.

02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:37.040
I really do.

02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:38.040
Yes.

02:02:38.040 --> 02:02:40.160
I want to be the goddamn Batman.

02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:41.160
Don't we all.

02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:42.160
Don't we all.

02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:43.160
Irene.

02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:44.160
Princess Irene.

02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:45.160
Your final thought tonight?

02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:48.200
I am rated M for violence and use of drugs.

02:02:48.200 --> 02:02:49.200
There you go.

02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:50.200
There you go.

02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:51.360
Alright.

02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:54.280
Alright well have a safe journey home you guys while we hold down the fort here and

02:02:54.280 --> 02:02:55.280
finish the show.

02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:56.280
Thanks.

02:02:56.280 --> 02:02:57.280
Good luck with Multitap Podcast.

02:02:57.280 --> 02:02:58.280
Thank you.

02:02:58.280 --> 02:02:59.280
Thank you.

02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:00.280
And I'll see you guys soon.

02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:01.280
Yes.

02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:02.280
Alright.

02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:03.280
Hopefully that event I was talking about before that we're going to be broadcasting

02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:04.280
live at you guys will stop by.

02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:05.280
I'll be there.

02:03:05.280 --> 02:03:06.280
Remind me.

02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:07.280
Alright.

02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:08.280
Sounds good.

02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:09.280
Okay.

02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:10.280
Bye.

02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:11.280
Okie dokie.

02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:12.280
Bye.

02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:13.280
Some of our folks in the chat room agreeing with Mystique's assessment about DC.

02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:17.200
Brad from Pod Culture saying DC has fucked things up for the past few years now.

02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:20.200
And Dungeon Buster saying I can't wait for Arkham Knight either.

02:03:20.200 --> 02:03:24.200
But I'm sure Ben Affleck will do a fine job playing Batman.

02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:26.200
I don't know.

02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:27.700
I don't know what to think about all that.

02:03:27.700 --> 02:03:30.200
Maybe Matt Damon could be the Joker in that universe.

02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:33.200
No now they have, what's his name, Jared Leto is playing the Joker.

02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:35.200
Okay Matt Damon could play someone else.

02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:37.200
Maybe Man Bat.

02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:38.200
Robin.

02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:39.200
He would be Robin of course.

02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:41.200
Oh my god that would be perfect.

02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:42.200
There would be that gay subtext.

02:03:42.200 --> 02:03:43.200
That would be perfect.

02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:44.200
That there was a 60's show.

02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:45.200
That would be hilarious.

02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:47.200
Oh they need to do that.

02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:48.200
Alright.

02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:59.200
We're going to move on to the foogle question of the week.

02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:02.760
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities and we read some

02:04:02.760 --> 02:04:05.360
of our favorite answers here on the show.

02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:08.480
And this week we wanted to ask our communities, you know, something that happened the week

02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:11.960
we were out was that the Playstation 2 celebrated a birthday.

02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:15.520
It is now 15 years old if you can believe it.

02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:20.440
So we asked our listeners how important was the Playstation to you as a gamer or did you

02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:22.180
skip the console?

02:04:22.180 --> 02:04:26.480
What was the most memorable Playstation 2 game in your opinion?

02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:29.400
So we're going to get to some of those answers here.

02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:32.880
Let's start over on Google Plus because Facebook is irritating me right now.

02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:38.160
So act deaf starting us off on Google Plus saying the PS2 is probably next to the Super

02:04:38.160 --> 02:04:39.160
Nintendo.

02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:40.160
It's one of the best consoles of all time.

02:04:40.160 --> 02:04:43.040
It was a really great system and had a huge library of games.

02:04:43.040 --> 02:04:44.280
Really good ones too.

02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:48.120
A lot of new series started on the system and old ones were brought back to life too.

02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:50.400
Which also makes it hard to just pick one game out of the bunch.

02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:54.900
But if I have to pick just one, the most memorable of them all would be Katamari Damacy.

02:04:54.900 --> 02:05:00.120
The simplest of games, the weirdest of games, one of the most unique experiences out there.

02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:04.680
Our pal Critical Myth from the Critical Myth show, Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, 4 o'clock

02:05:04.680 --> 02:05:10.540
Pacific 7 Eastern here on VOG, says the Playstation 2 was my first console after the 2600.

02:05:10.540 --> 02:05:15.280
Not kidding, before that I played in the arcade, Commodore 64, PC games during high school

02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:16.280
or college.

02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:21.080
It wasn't until late in the PS2 era that we got one, the Slim Bundle, and have been console

02:05:21.080 --> 02:05:22.840
gamers since.

02:05:22.840 --> 02:05:27.360
As for the most memorable game, hard to pin down but I'll go with Final Fantasy XII because

02:05:27.360 --> 02:05:32.920
it was the last game for the console that I dropped over 100 hours into.

02:05:32.960 --> 02:05:36.560
Retertainment says for me the Playstation 2 was the video game console I bought with

02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:39.480
money that I earned from my first job as an adult.

02:05:39.480 --> 02:05:43.960
I'm not sure, or I'm sure I'm not alone in saying that the Playstation 2 not only served

02:05:43.960 --> 02:05:49.260
as a video game but also as my first DVD player and for a long time my only DVD player.

02:05:49.260 --> 02:05:54.120
As far as the most memorable game, Grand Theft Auto Vice City.

02:05:54.120 --> 02:05:58.600
And Josh Wye replied and said PS2 compared to its predecessor didn't have a wide range

02:05:58.600 --> 02:05:59.600
of game types.

02:05:59.600 --> 02:06:02.560
A lot of the games got quite derivative and tired after a while.

02:06:02.600 --> 02:06:08.080
My most memorable PS2 game was probably EverQuest Online Adventures.

02:06:08.080 --> 02:06:12.240
Nothing beated the feeling of seeing the sunrise over Freeport for the first time after making

02:06:12.240 --> 02:06:15.200
the perilous journey from the west of Tunaria.

02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:17.520
So a lot of answers there over on Google Plus.

02:06:17.520 --> 02:06:22.520
Let's check out our Facebook answers, except again this page not cooperating with me here

02:06:22.520 --> 02:06:24.080
on Facebook.

02:06:24.080 --> 02:06:27.340
Facebook does not want me to read your answers, okay here we go finally got all your comments

02:06:27.340 --> 02:06:29.040
to load.

02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:32.520
Bread the Hayes says the Playstation 2 was important to me at the time when I first got

02:06:32.520 --> 02:06:33.520
it.

02:06:33.520 --> 02:06:36.080
I think I was trying to get over a break up at the time and playing Castlevania Lament

02:06:36.080 --> 02:06:39.200
of Innocence for dozens of hours was helpful.

02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:42.560
Fabrice A says never bought any Playstation because I was into Sega.

02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:48.280
To this day I still refuse to buy any Playstation because of their advertisement campaign against

02:06:48.280 --> 02:06:49.720
Dreamcast.

02:06:49.720 --> 02:06:53.720
Still it would be stupid to deny that Playstation 2 didn't have amazing games and Sony having

02:06:53.720 --> 02:06:55.720
a huge influence on the gaming world.

02:06:55.720 --> 02:07:00.720
You know something else to consider Fabrice, Sega puts out games on Playstation now occasionally

02:07:00.720 --> 02:07:04.520
so I think those rifts from back in the day have passed a little bit.

02:07:04.520 --> 02:07:08.260
It might be time to let it go.

02:07:08.260 --> 02:07:09.960
The snow never bothered you anyway.

02:07:09.960 --> 02:07:14.540
Elliot B says I was a die hard GameCube supporter at the start of the generation but eventually

02:07:14.540 --> 02:07:18.080
gave in and bought a PS2 and I'm glad since otherwise I wouldn't have been able to play

02:07:18.080 --> 02:07:20.920
its wonderful selection of rhythm action games.

02:07:20.920 --> 02:07:24.560
Fifth Dream says I never had much money so I didn't get a PS2 until late in the cycle

02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:26.760
when a friend sold his to me really cheap.

02:07:26.760 --> 02:07:30.720
I immediately played the Final Fantasy games from 7 to 10 too all in a row.

02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:34.320
This was huge for me because I loved Final Fantasy and had missed out on the Playstation

02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:35.640
1's to that point.

02:07:35.640 --> 02:07:40.440
I also loved Katamari Damacy and the .hack and GU trilogy on the system.

02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:41.440
That's a good point.

02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:44.360
Remember how the Playstation 2 would play Playstation 1 games?

02:07:44.360 --> 02:07:46.560
It was just totally backwards compatible.

02:07:46.560 --> 02:07:50.440
Remember when our systems were totally backwards compatible?

02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:52.320
Now only Nintendo does that.

02:07:52.320 --> 02:07:53.320
Sorta.

02:07:53.320 --> 02:07:56.400
Still the old old games but at least hey the Wii games work on the Wii U.

02:07:56.400 --> 02:07:58.760
We don't have that anywhere else.

02:07:58.760 --> 02:07:59.880
Anyway let's see.

02:07:59.880 --> 02:08:04.400
Tiger Caw says I still have an original launch PS2 which still works 100%.

02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:07.580
The Bouncer was a pretty memorable game because it was one of the launch titles.

02:08:07.580 --> 02:08:09.800
It was a game that pushed the PS2's hardware with the graphics.

02:08:09.800 --> 02:08:12.200
It was a fighting game but also cinematics.

02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:14.360
Enter the Matrix was another game I enjoyed playing.

02:08:14.360 --> 02:08:16.640
It was the game that was official canon to the Matrix movies.

02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:20.240
I remember when that came out, Loki and I lived together and you were huge into that

02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:21.240
game.

02:08:21.240 --> 02:08:22.240
I had it in GameCube.

02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:23.240
Yeah.

02:08:23.240 --> 02:08:25.360
And it was on all the platforms really.

02:08:25.360 --> 02:08:26.360
Yeah.

02:08:26.360 --> 02:08:27.360
Let's see.

02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:32.400
Let's not forget that the PS2 was the first console to bring online multiplayer online

02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:34.360
via an add-on ethernet adapter.

02:08:34.360 --> 02:08:38.520
You have to own the PS2 a lot for bringing online multiplayer to consoles for the first

02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:39.520
time.

02:08:39.520 --> 02:08:45.480
I usually think Xbox got a little more credit with that just because of Xbox Live.

02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:49.080
But to be fair, didn't the Dreamcast have Phantasy Star Online?

02:08:49.080 --> 02:08:51.340
And I think we might have had a little bit of it.

02:08:51.340 --> 02:08:56.600
But not to discredit Tiger Cost Point because definitely the PS2 started moving that forward

02:08:56.600 --> 02:09:03.980
and you had a lot more of it than you really did in other places at the time on the PS2.

02:09:03.980 --> 02:09:07.020
Andy R. says, it was pretty big for me.

02:09:07.020 --> 02:09:09.260
PlayStation 1 was the first home console I owned.

02:09:09.260 --> 02:09:13.020
By PlayStation 2, I was middle or high school so it was the first system I spent my own

02:09:13.020 --> 02:09:14.660
money on to get games.

02:09:14.660 --> 02:09:17.260
Favorite PlayStation 2 game is probably Valkyrie Profile 2.

02:09:17.820 --> 02:09:22.620
SSJ100Matt says the PS2 was my entry point into the PlayStation since I skipped the PS1

02:09:22.620 --> 02:09:24.220
in favor of the N64.

02:09:24.220 --> 02:09:28.140
I was blown away with the games and the ability to play PS1 games that I couldn't play up

02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:29.140
till then.

02:09:29.140 --> 02:09:31.820
My most memorable games were SSX3 and Final Fantasy X.

02:09:31.820 --> 02:09:37.060
I logged for probably over 100 hours in both games and I still play SSX3 on occasion.

02:09:37.060 --> 02:09:40.900
Burr replied and said I hated PS2 because I was a Dreamcast fanboy.

02:09:40.900 --> 02:09:43.980
I think it's a shame so many overlooked the Dreamcast because they were busy waiting on

02:09:43.980 --> 02:09:45.440
Sony's false hype.

02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:47.800
That infamous Final Fantasy VII demo took the cake.

02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:50.800
I'm over it now but it was difficult to stomach at the time.

02:09:50.800 --> 02:09:53.640
Degenerate Johnny says, all hail Kingdom Hearts.

02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:57.480
Regretted skipping PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2 surpassed all.

02:09:57.480 --> 02:10:01.480
Mike C. replied and said I bought the PlayStation 2 because it came with a built-in DVD player.

02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:04.640
I think a lot of people did that.

02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:09.340
One of our people on Google Plus kind of made that point that a lot of people were buying

02:10:09.340 --> 02:10:13.680
the PlayStation 2 because it was a DVD player and that really is probably what passed it

02:10:13.680 --> 02:10:16.440
despite all the negativity with Sega and so forth.

02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:22.120
That is what really pushed the PlayStation 2 ahead of the competition.

02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:25.960
Mike C. continued on saying the one game for PlayStation 2 that blew my mind was Grand

02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:26.960
Theft Auto 3.

02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:29.320
It was the first open world game that I ever played.

02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:33.120
I could go wherever I want, kill whoever I want, steal any car I want.

02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:34.840
It was dope.

02:10:34.840 --> 02:10:39.240
Cial replied and said I didn't get a PS2 until the system's price dropped below 50 bucks.

02:10:39.240 --> 02:10:41.240
So it was a partial pass on the system.

02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:42.480
Just a few more here.

02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:44.080
I love this diversity of answers.

02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:46.200
That's why I'm reading so many here.

02:10:46.200 --> 02:10:48.800
Hitstun says the PlayStation 2 got me into online gaming.

02:10:48.800 --> 02:10:53.000
I spent hundreds of hours in Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 making new levels in the Create-A-Park

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.560
tool and playing them online with my new friends.

02:10:55.560 --> 02:10:59.560
And Misty says I got a PlayStation 2 about the same time DDR's American Home releases

02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:02.800
came out and that's what convinced me to get the system at all.

02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:06.360
While the .hack series of games did a much better job than average of grabbing and holding

02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:10.800
my attention, if not for DDR, I likely would have never purchased the system at all.

02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:14.600
I never had the original system and haven't had a PlayStation console since.

02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:18.480
Most memorable game, the .hack series, because I'm still of the opinion that DDR isn't quite

02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:22.120
as pure when it isn't played on an arcade machine.

02:11:22.120 --> 02:11:26.140
And last but not least, Dark Tetsuya says while I don't still have the first PS2 I ever

02:11:26.140 --> 02:11:29.440
had originally, my current one is still working like a charm.

02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:33.120
I do still fire up mine on occasion for a round of BeatMania 2DX.

02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:38.040
Sickstyle is probably my all-time favorite, so my system gets some use still 15 years

02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:39.040
later.

02:11:39.160 --> 02:11:42.960
There, whew, that was a lot of answers, but so diverse I had to read them all.

02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:45.760
Quickly, PlayStation 2 memories, Loki?

02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:51.280
Um, I guess, granted, if I was San Andreas, I can't, no, there's a lot of really good

02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:57.220
games that I played on PS2, I mean, the first game I had was Armored Core, so, it was like

02:11:57.220 --> 02:12:03.400
Armored Core 4, I think, I don't remember which one it was that they launched it with.

02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:07.520
I don't know, I mean, I think that was it.

02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:18.560
It was Driver, no, Driver 3 was on PlayStation 2, yes it was, and Katamari, of course.

02:12:18.560 --> 02:12:22.680
I think some quick ones I would name, since it's the Final Fantasy game no one else named,

02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:27.480
Final Fantasy XI, for sucking me into MMOs, I mean, granted, yeah, but, you know, it was

02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:31.320
really cool to see it on the PlayStation as well, and you know, it was kind of a trip,

02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:35.080
seeing that interconnectivity there, and you know, I'm just such an MMO fan, I have to

02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:36.300
give that a shoutout.

02:12:36.300 --> 02:12:40.820
But otherwise, I would also say, you know, I bought a Japanese PlayStation 2 just so

02:12:40.820 --> 02:12:45.540
I could play Beat Mania 2DX, so I'm kind of with Dark Tetsuya on that one.

02:12:45.540 --> 02:12:52.660
I would also say, though, for serious reasons, Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy X, both phenomenal

02:12:52.660 --> 02:12:56.460
games, and for lolsy inside joke reasons, Magic Pen Gel.

02:12:56.460 --> 02:12:58.660
I love Magic Pen Gel.

02:12:58.660 --> 02:12:59.660
Right?

02:12:59.660 --> 02:13:00.660
Right?

02:13:00.660 --> 02:13:01.660
That's a game they should bring back.

02:13:01.660 --> 02:13:02.660
Right?

02:13:02.660 --> 02:13:04.460
Alright, let's get to some more news.

02:13:04.460 --> 02:13:07.780
We'll try to run through this so we have some time to get to your calls as well.

02:13:07.780 --> 02:13:08.780
Loki.

02:13:08.780 --> 02:13:13.780
Okay, this is really disappointing, but apparently Sony is now getting rid of PlayStation Mobile

02:13:13.780 --> 02:13:14.780
altogether.

02:13:14.780 --> 02:13:19.180
Now, originally it was that they were dropping support on Android for it, which I could live

02:13:19.180 --> 02:13:27.420
with, you know, but now they're actually going to be ending the program on, not only Android,

02:13:27.420 --> 02:13:28.700
but on the Vita.

02:13:28.700 --> 02:13:31.380
And here's the best part about it.

02:13:31.380 --> 02:13:36.700
Apparently the content distribution will stop on July 15th, 2015.

02:13:36.700 --> 02:13:42.260
After September 10th, you will not be able to re-download your purchases.

02:13:42.260 --> 02:13:45.040
So that kind of sucks.

02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:49.180
You apparently need to manually authenticate your device for the Vita.

02:13:49.180 --> 02:13:55.240
You can do that under, I guess, your PlayStation Network System Activation settings.

02:13:55.240 --> 02:14:00.260
And then on PlayStation Mobile, it says you apparently need to open up the app and launch

02:14:00.260 --> 02:14:07.260
any purchases after April 10th and before September 10th so that you can still access

02:14:07.260 --> 02:14:08.780
them after that time.

02:14:08.780 --> 02:14:13.640
Here's the thing that's really annoying about that as well is that's one of the things Unity

02:14:13.640 --> 02:14:18.540
had where you can output to PlayStation Mobile and like right now, if I wanted to publish

02:14:18.540 --> 02:14:22.420
a game or even publish the game that I'm working on, I could do that and, you know, I just

02:14:22.420 --> 02:14:27.620
have to sign up on their website if I could push to PlayStation Mobile.

02:14:27.620 --> 02:14:29.500
But now I won't be able to do that.

02:14:29.500 --> 02:14:31.540
So that kind of sucks.

02:14:31.540 --> 02:14:32.540
Yeah.

02:14:32.540 --> 02:14:36.960
And one of the dangers of digital distribution is that, you know, even though a lot of companies

02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:40.760
have talked about their exit strategy, such as Steam, you know, says if they ever had

02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:44.900
to close down, they have a button they can push that would unlock the DRM on every game

02:14:44.900 --> 02:14:46.060
you've bought.

02:14:46.060 --> 02:14:48.820
But I mean, would you be able to re-download games again?

02:14:48.820 --> 02:14:49.820
No.

02:14:49.820 --> 02:14:50.820
And according to this, they're saying no.

02:14:50.820 --> 02:14:51.820
Yeah.

02:14:51.820 --> 02:14:52.820
Unless you can't.

02:14:52.820 --> 02:14:57.340
So that's kind of messed up that they're saying, sorry, you can't do that.

02:14:57.340 --> 02:15:00.820
I don't understand why they can't do that.

02:15:00.820 --> 02:15:02.140
I don't understand why they're getting rid of it.

02:15:02.140 --> 02:15:04.780
Cost too much money for the servers, I guess, to justify the cost.

02:15:04.780 --> 02:15:05.780
I don't know.

02:15:05.780 --> 02:15:06.780
I mean, that's not much content on there.

02:15:06.780 --> 02:15:08.020
I mean, I can't imagine that.

02:15:08.020 --> 02:15:09.220
I'm just kind of disappointed.

02:15:09.220 --> 02:15:14.080
The fact that it's not easy now to push to PlayStation that way is if they make it easy

02:15:14.080 --> 02:15:18.180
enough to push content to PlayStation, because this was something that you didn't have to

02:15:18.180 --> 02:15:23.660
like go through PlayStation and work out a deal with them to get it on their service.

02:15:23.660 --> 02:15:29.740
It was tucked away in a corner, but ideally I was thinking about this for releasing something

02:15:29.740 --> 02:15:37.020
on PlayStation TV, where it's a title that runs on the Vita, but it's on the console

02:15:37.020 --> 02:15:38.020
now.

02:15:38.020 --> 02:15:39.580
That's an easiest way to get to a console.

02:15:39.580 --> 02:15:44.580
But now we have to go about all these roundabout ways to get to publish on there.

02:15:44.580 --> 02:15:48.260
So I just hope that they open up something similar.

02:15:48.260 --> 02:15:52.240
I know that they're going to have that whole ID at Xbox thing, and eventually those systems

02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:54.360
are going to act as dev units.

02:15:54.360 --> 02:16:00.360
I hope they do something similar for PlayStation, because that kind of sucks.

02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:04.600
Bonds006 in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, it was doomed to fail.

02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:08.680
They could not fight with Google Play and iOS Market.

02:16:08.680 --> 02:16:12.400
Okay, I'll give them that.

02:16:12.400 --> 02:16:18.580
And they did drop the support on Android, but why not just leave it there for Vita?

02:16:18.580 --> 02:16:19.580
Or why not?

02:16:19.580 --> 02:16:20.740
There's a crazy idea.

02:16:20.740 --> 02:16:27.500
Why not leave it open for Vita and open it up for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4?

02:16:27.500 --> 02:16:31.140
I mean, I don't understand why they couldn't do that.

02:16:31.140 --> 02:16:39.100
Well, this news is going to disappoint some, but I think others will understand why there

02:16:39.100 --> 02:16:40.460
was big news this week.

02:16:40.460 --> 02:16:48.420
Uncharted 4, A Thief's End, pushed back to Spring 2016, revealed on the PlayStation blog.

02:16:48.420 --> 02:16:52.780
Since we showed you our first gameplay reveal of Uncharted 4, A Thief's End, more of the

02:16:52.780 --> 02:16:55.600
game and story have come together, and it's become clear to us that this game is much

02:16:55.600 --> 02:16:58.460
more ambitious than we originally envisioned.

02:16:58.460 --> 02:17:01.820
After spending so many years with Nathan Drake, he means a lot to the team, and telling the

02:17:01.820 --> 02:17:05.240
climatic chapter of his adventures is a task we don't take lightly.

02:17:05.240 --> 02:17:09.180
This game deserves every bit of the attention to detail, precise pacing, and nuanced storytelling

02:17:09.180 --> 02:17:10.720
Naughty Dog is known for.

02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:13.800
So we've made the difficult choice of pushing the game's release date.

02:17:13.800 --> 02:17:18.600
All that statement on the PlayStation blog from director Neil Druckmann, which, as you

02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:24.960
can imagine, the people that love to see Sony fail were coming out in droves saying, hahaha,

02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:28.920
whereas I think there's other people of the mindset that are like, you know, well, if

02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:33.420
it takes the system, or I mean, if it takes the game a little longer so that it's not

02:17:33.420 --> 02:17:36.380
all buggy and screwed up, then, you know, so be it.

02:17:36.380 --> 02:17:42.240
But I think that does leave quite a few people wondering, what's Sony going to do this holiday?

02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:44.920
This was supposed to be the tent pole for their holiday.

02:17:44.920 --> 02:17:45.920
So now what?

02:17:45.920 --> 02:17:46.920
Now what?

02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:47.920
What they got?

02:17:47.920 --> 02:17:53.920
Did something have to get put on a fast track to make the holiday to make up for this one

02:17:53.920 --> 02:17:55.360
getting pushed back?

02:17:55.360 --> 02:17:57.800
Are they going to try to rely on third parties?

02:17:57.800 --> 02:17:58.800
Who knows?

02:17:58.800 --> 02:17:59.800
I don't think they would.

02:17:59.800 --> 02:18:00.800
I think they've got to have something.

02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:02.040
I've got to have something.

02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:08.280
But I mean, to be fair, Sony had, I don't want to say Sony had a weak Christmas last

02:18:08.280 --> 02:18:11.860
year because it's not like they didn't say it was a week PS4s, but they did get out sold

02:18:11.860 --> 02:18:15.340
by Xbox one over the first party releases is pretty weak.

02:18:15.340 --> 02:18:16.340
Yeah.

02:18:16.340 --> 02:18:20.620
So it wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't as strong as Nintendo's to be honest.

02:18:20.620 --> 02:18:23.840
So well, Nintendo, all they have is first party.

02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:29.120
So I mean, that's, well, it has to be strong, but Loki, you have to admit what, what Nintendo

02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:33.580
put out over the three months was probably stronger than what, you know, Sony had coming

02:18:33.580 --> 02:18:36.160
out for their system over the three months, all day period.

02:18:36.160 --> 02:18:39.600
I love my PlayStation four and there's a lot of great games for, yeah, it was broken drive

02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:41.760
club and a little big planet three.

02:18:41.760 --> 02:18:44.440
I mean, it's not hard to compete against that.

02:18:44.440 --> 02:18:47.080
So what do you think happens now, Loki?

02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:50.520
I think we wait until E3 and find out what game they have coming out and there's still

02:18:50.520 --> 02:18:51.520
plenty of things.

02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:53.320
And I think it probably is no man's sky.

02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:55.880
Oh, you think they're investing everything in that?

02:18:55.880 --> 02:19:00.440
I would say, and I think the game that probably could be fast tracked, I would think God of

02:19:00.440 --> 02:19:05.800
War is going to be the game that they're going to push to this holiday and make it happen.

02:19:05.800 --> 02:19:07.200
That's just my gut.

02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:09.120
I have nothing to base that off of.

02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:12.720
I just would think that that would be the game that maybe they were looking at for next

02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:14.760
year that maybe they could bump up to this year.

02:19:14.760 --> 02:19:15.760
I don't know.

02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:16.760
We'll see.

02:19:16.760 --> 02:19:17.760
We'll see.

02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:18.760
Nothing's that easy.

02:19:18.760 --> 02:19:19.820
It's just, you know, Oh, let's dial up the graphics.

02:19:19.820 --> 02:19:24.280
Maybe it's a sequel to the order 18, 80, whatever, seven.

02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:25.280
Maybe it's a sequel.

02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:26.280
I don't think so.

02:19:26.280 --> 02:19:27.280
I don't think so.

02:19:27.280 --> 02:19:28.280
All right.

02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:29.280
Well, yeah, we'll see at E3.

02:19:29.280 --> 02:19:30.280
Knack two.

02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:31.280
What?

02:19:31.280 --> 02:19:32.280
Knack two.

02:19:32.280 --> 02:19:33.280
I don't think so.

02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:34.280
I think Knack is more likely to be on PlayStation plus.

02:19:34.280 --> 02:19:35.280
It's a free game.

02:19:35.280 --> 02:19:36.280
Very soon.

02:19:36.280 --> 02:19:37.280
We'll see.

02:19:37.280 --> 02:19:38.280
Okay.

02:19:38.280 --> 02:19:39.280
Cool.

02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:40.280
Um, yeah.

02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:43.800
Uh, you know, but here's the thing, even though I am also here saying, boy, I wonder what

02:19:43.800 --> 02:19:44.800
they're going to have for the holiday.

02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:46.680
Wasn't there supposed to be a new Ratchet and Clank game?

02:19:46.680 --> 02:19:48.840
Like, cause they know there's supposed to be the movie too.

02:19:48.840 --> 02:19:49.840
There could be that.

02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:56.200
Um, but I just want to say, um, if you bought a PlayStation four now in anticipation of

02:19:56.200 --> 02:20:01.720
Uncharted and that was the only thing you were going for, then that's kind of on you.

02:20:01.720 --> 02:20:04.040
Stop buying systems for games that aren't out yet.

02:20:04.040 --> 02:20:09.120
I mean, you can use those games to kind of justify the purchase of the system.

02:20:09.120 --> 02:20:14.200
Like, you know, if you already have a few strong games out that you want to buy, but

02:20:14.200 --> 02:20:18.520
you know, I think it's very important for these games to take their time in the incubator

02:20:18.520 --> 02:20:22.160
and come out right because no one likes a rushed project.

02:20:22.160 --> 02:20:24.360
Take Assassin's Creed Unity, for example.

02:20:24.360 --> 02:20:28.320
Uh, John from Critical Myth wrote a review over at vognetwork.com this week that was

02:20:28.320 --> 02:20:32.920
like, kind of like, let's revisit this game, you know, now that we're six months, you know,

02:20:32.920 --> 02:20:36.000
past when it was, maybe not that far, but like four months, five months past when it

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:39.680
was first released and he kind of touches on everything they've changed since then.

02:20:39.680 --> 02:20:43.560
And you know, this seems like the game they wanted to release and they never should have

02:20:43.560 --> 02:20:44.880
released it over the holiday period.

02:20:44.880 --> 02:20:48.720
That maybe was a game that should have been pushed back or else it wouldn't have gotten,

02:20:48.720 --> 02:20:49.840
you know, half the crap it did.

02:20:49.840 --> 02:20:52.320
Do you want your Uncharted four turning out like Assassin's Creed?

02:20:52.320 --> 02:20:54.880
No, I don't think anybody does.

02:20:54.880 --> 02:20:58.760
So if they have to take the extra time, then they have to take the extra time.

02:20:58.760 --> 02:21:03.840
Um, SSJ100Matt saying, I thought Street Fighter 5 was their big thing for the holidays, but

02:21:03.840 --> 02:21:06.960
I see it's coming out quarter one, 2016.

02:21:06.960 --> 02:21:11.400
Uh, Dungeon Buster saying Witcher 3 was delayed several times.

02:21:11.400 --> 02:21:13.640
I think some people are talking about that in the chat room.

02:21:13.640 --> 02:21:15.480
Uh, so there you go.

02:21:15.480 --> 02:21:18.000
You know, Witcher 3 is multi-platform, so I...

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:19.000
That's true too.

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:20.680
I don't think that really matters.

02:21:20.680 --> 02:21:21.680
Yeah.

02:21:21.680 --> 02:21:23.640
All right, Loki, what do you have for us?

02:21:23.640 --> 02:21:26.040
Um, so this is kind of cool.

02:21:26.040 --> 02:21:32.280
There's a group of modders that are remaking Warcraft 3, I believe in Starcraft 2, because

02:21:32.280 --> 02:21:37.920
they did release the assets for World of Warcraft, not World of Warcraft, for Warcraft 3 to allow

02:21:37.920 --> 02:21:40.720
people to make stuff in Starcraft 2 using that.

02:21:40.720 --> 02:21:47.160
And so now we have Warcraft, the armies of Azeroth.

02:21:47.160 --> 02:21:48.160
It looks pretty cool.

02:21:48.160 --> 02:21:50.920
I'm just not sure when it's coming out.

02:21:50.920 --> 02:21:54.720
Blizzard is surprisingly supportive of these types of projects usually too.

02:21:54.720 --> 02:21:58.680
Yeah, probably because they have no interest in doing it, and if it works out, they can...

02:21:58.680 --> 02:22:03.520
Well, I remember there were rumors around last BlizzCon of a Warcraft 3 HD remake was

02:22:03.520 --> 02:22:07.520
like the big buzz that they were going to announce, but it ended up being Overwatch

02:22:07.520 --> 02:22:11.400
instead because there was a whole misdirect with the cancellation of Titan.

02:22:11.400 --> 02:22:16.080
But yeah, it's interesting that a Warcraft 3 newer version of sorts is going to happen

02:22:16.080 --> 02:22:17.080
anyway.

02:22:17.080 --> 02:22:18.080
Yeah, it looks pretty cool.

02:22:18.080 --> 02:22:22.480
But I think we saw this coming too when Starcraft 2 put the Warcraft assets in it.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:26.320
So anyway, let's go to the mailbag.

02:22:26.320 --> 02:22:31.040
Every week you guys send us emails to participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:33.200
If you want to participate, email us.

02:22:33.200 --> 02:22:35.200
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

02:22:35.200 --> 02:22:41.160
Typically, DarkSakura would dive into the mailbag and read the emails for you, but as

02:22:41.160 --> 02:22:43.680
we mentioned before, she's not here this week.

02:22:43.680 --> 02:22:48.480
She'll be back next week, but I will fill in in her steed this week.

02:22:48.480 --> 02:22:51.800
We just have two quick emails for you guys tonight.

02:22:51.800 --> 02:22:55.720
And again, if you want to have DarkSakura read your email next week, you can participate

02:22:55.720 --> 02:22:57.520
at orangelaungeradio.com.

02:22:57.520 --> 02:22:59.720
First email coming to us from EA Skizie.

02:22:59.720 --> 02:23:03.160
I haven't seen this name in a little while, but EA Skizie writes us and says, hey Orange

02:23:03.160 --> 02:23:07.440
Lounge, did I hear you say episode 589?

02:23:07.440 --> 02:23:08.440
That's crazy.

02:23:08.440 --> 02:23:11.360
I just want to email in and say that I think that's amazing.

02:23:11.360 --> 02:23:14.360
And I hope you go for 589 more.

02:23:14.360 --> 02:23:17.480
Anybody want to start Starbound for the first time with me?

02:23:17.480 --> 02:23:18.480
LOL.

02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:19.480
Yes.

02:23:19.480 --> 02:23:20.480
508.

02:23:20.480 --> 02:23:22.480
Oh, and that's EA Skizie from Milwaukee.

02:23:22.480 --> 02:23:23.480
Yes.

02:23:23.480 --> 02:23:25.320
589 is a long time.

02:23:25.320 --> 02:23:29.760
We're actually going to be celebrating our 13th birthday in June.

02:23:29.760 --> 02:23:32.720
And so for us to go for, you know, now it's 590 tonight.

02:23:32.720 --> 02:23:37.340
For us to go for another 590 episodes, we would have to go for 13 more years.

02:23:37.340 --> 02:23:43.800
I would be 50 years old at that point about, I'm only 36 now, but I'm getting there.

02:23:43.800 --> 02:23:52.720
So you know, obviously we're very fortunate and lucky that we have your guys' support

02:23:52.720 --> 02:23:56.520
as we've had over the years that really motivate us to keep going.

02:23:56.520 --> 02:24:02.760
But you know, DarkSakura, Loki, myself, we've really just made this our Sunday night habit.

02:24:02.760 --> 02:24:06.520
And you know, we are fortunate enough that through all this hard work, we're able to

02:24:06.520 --> 02:24:09.840
say, we're the longest running video game podcast out there.

02:24:09.840 --> 02:24:15.920
You know, granted, some may want to take some radio show, the fact that podcasting wasn't

02:24:15.920 --> 02:24:19.720
around for 2005, whatever, whatever technicalities you want to get it on.

02:24:19.720 --> 02:24:25.640
The point is we've been here since 2002, still doing our thing with you guys.

02:24:25.640 --> 02:24:28.360
And I know I don't want to lose that anytime soon.

02:24:28.360 --> 02:24:32.800
And I doubt Loki does and I doubt DarkSakura does, because I have fun doing this on Sunday

02:24:32.800 --> 02:24:37.120
and you guys, you know, despite all the drama, and I talked about some of it earlier tonight,

02:24:37.120 --> 02:24:41.440
despite all the drama, that's just, that's just that, you know, it wouldn't matter if

02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:44.640
I never went to a single show ever again or ever did.

02:24:44.640 --> 02:24:48.840
The fact that even one person shows up and listens for this is truly, and I know people

02:24:48.840 --> 02:24:52.080
say this, but it's truly like just reward enough and getting to hang out with Loki and

02:24:52.080 --> 02:24:57.760
Jamie because Lord knows if I'd see them otherwise without busy Loki is and so forth.

02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:00.400
So we're going to be here as long as possible.

02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:06.520
I mean, nothing lasts forever, but it will take, it's going to take something big, like,

02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:10.520
you know, and I think we've talked about this openly on the show a few years ago.

02:25:10.520 --> 02:25:15.880
If I haven't talked about this on the show before, then oops, I guess tonight is the

02:25:15.880 --> 02:25:18.240
night where I'm spilling all the tea, isn't it?

02:25:18.240 --> 02:25:23.120
But we had a scare a couple of years ago that Jamie was going to move to Washington and

02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:24.600
she damn near did.

02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:29.320
And there was kind of talks that about, well, if you move away, I mean, there was the talk,

02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:32.880
oh, we could Skype and so forth, but would it really be the same type of show?

02:25:32.880 --> 02:25:33.880
I don't know.

02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:38.640
We had talked about, well, if this happens, this is maybe that it's maybe time to still

02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:39.640
be able to carry on.

02:25:39.640 --> 02:25:40.640
I don't know.

02:25:40.640 --> 02:25:41.640
I don't know.

02:25:41.640 --> 02:25:42.640
Would it really be the same?

02:25:42.640 --> 02:25:45.560
I really think part of what makes this show special is the fact that we're all in the

02:25:45.560 --> 02:25:46.560
same room.

02:25:46.560 --> 02:25:50.760
Like a lot, a lot of podcasts aren't able to do that, which, you know, I know I do,

02:25:50.760 --> 02:25:52.000
I do another podcast.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:55.000
I do two other podcasts where we're not all in the same room and there are a lot of fun.

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:58.620
I know, but I feel like part of what makes this show special is that we are all here

02:25:58.620 --> 02:25:59.620
in the same room.

02:25:59.620 --> 02:26:00.840
So if we lost that, I don't know.

02:26:00.840 --> 02:26:05.600
I mean, I know we did it for a few months after, you know, your son was born low key,

02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:08.240
but that it's something different when there's a time on it.

02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:11.520
And the fact that some of us were still here in studio, it's just, you were remote, you

02:26:11.520 --> 02:26:16.040
know, I don't know how I'd feel about that being a permanent thing though.

02:26:16.040 --> 02:26:22.440
So anyway, just throwing that out there, uh, over at our chat room, over at live.vognetwork.com

02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:27.640
SSG100 Matt says, from what I know of Rob, whether it's OLR or not, I can see him podcasting

02:26:27.640 --> 02:26:29.080
into his fifties.

02:26:29.120 --> 02:26:31.240
Yeah, probably.

02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:35.640
Bonds006 says, I started with OLR on the podcast about 2005.

02:26:35.640 --> 02:26:39.080
Back in my day, when you had the only mic in an online game, it meant your word was

02:26:39.080 --> 02:26:40.640
the law.

02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:43.320
Some folks talking about microphones in online games.

02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:44.320
All right.

02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:49.400
So anyhow, um, and I kind of tend to agree with SSG100 Matt.

02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:52.920
I probably will be podcasting well into my fifties.

02:26:52.920 --> 02:26:56.480
It might not be about this topic, but, uh, probably be something going on.

02:26:56.480 --> 02:26:58.960
It'll probably be about RuPaul's Drag Race, right?

02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:01.520
I'll still be doing that, right?

02:27:01.520 --> 02:27:03.360
Anyway, uh, moving on.

02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:08.760
One more email here from Martin in Belgium, uh, emails us and says, I was interested to

02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:12.320
hear Sky and Loki talk about Ingress last episode.

02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:14.620
Remember that discussion, Loki?

02:27:14.620 --> 02:27:18.340
One thing that did not come up was the fact that Google might be using this game for location

02:27:18.340 --> 02:27:20.080
data mining purposes.

02:27:20.080 --> 02:27:23.840
Google in the past has been doing all kinds of creepy stuff, such as logging all the wifi

02:27:23.840 --> 02:27:26.160
networks and range of their street view cars.

02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:29.040
They now use that data to more accurately determine locations.

02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:33.320
It is hard to believe that Google is not using this app for something similar, given the

02:27:33.320 --> 02:27:35.320
fact that they are pushing it so hard.

02:27:35.320 --> 02:27:39.260
They could use this GPS enabled app to get all kinds of location data, including the

02:27:39.260 --> 02:27:43.660
most popular landmarks in an area, routes you take to get there, or even personal location

02:27:43.660 --> 02:27:45.760
data tied to your Google account, et cetera.

02:27:45.760 --> 02:27:50.000
I think the app claims that no data is being sent back, but in the past, companies like

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:53.520
Google and Apple have been known to send back data without alerting the user.

02:27:53.520 --> 02:27:55.720
How would you feel about the game if this would be the case?

02:27:55.720 --> 02:27:56.960
Would you keep playing it?

02:27:56.960 --> 02:28:00.520
Personally, I'm very aware of trying not to give these companies too much of my data.

02:28:00.520 --> 02:28:03.720
I always disable location history and things like that on my phone.

02:28:03.720 --> 02:28:06.320
This may be tinfoil hat of me, but I don't trust this app.

02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:07.920
It just seems fishy.

02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:08.920
Keep up the great show.

02:28:08.920 --> 02:28:10.560
All the best, Martin from Belgium."

02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:17.320
Sure, that thought's crossed my mind that they might be mining the location data, but

02:28:17.320 --> 02:28:19.520
there's two things to keep in mind with that.

02:28:19.520 --> 02:28:23.880
One, if Google wants to know where I live, they already figured it out.

02:28:23.880 --> 02:28:26.480
They could just look at where I log into my Gmail account from.

02:28:26.480 --> 02:28:28.680
They could probably find a lot out about my habits from that.

02:28:28.680 --> 02:28:30.760
Yeah, I was going to say, they probably don't need a game.

02:28:30.760 --> 02:28:31.760
They don't need a game to do it.

02:28:31.760 --> 02:28:32.760
Yeah, exactly.

02:28:32.760 --> 02:28:34.760
They will just build it into their fucking operating system.

02:28:34.760 --> 02:28:39.720
As far as to know what landmarks are visited frequently and so forth, although that's a

02:28:39.720 --> 02:28:44.680
good thought as well, and I'm not trying to discredit that, I would challenge this, is

02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:51.540
that Ingress, part of the challenge is going to places I wouldn't usually go to.

02:28:51.540 --> 02:28:55.740
If they're trying to track what landmarks people go to, it's going to be artificial

02:28:55.740 --> 02:29:00.140
because some of these places I would never have gone to if it wasn't for Ingress, which

02:29:00.140 --> 02:29:05.740
is both a positive and a negative because the positive is, I also get out of my car,

02:29:05.740 --> 02:29:09.060
get up off my butt, and walk through some of these parks.

02:29:09.060 --> 02:29:16.220
The other night, Thursday night, the Enlightened, the Green Team had a medium-sized event where

02:29:16.220 --> 02:29:20.920
10 people showed up at this predetermined location where we walked around the circumference

02:29:20.920 --> 02:29:26.360
of a park for a couple hours and did all the nodes and then farmed gear off of them.

02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:29.560
So I wouldn't have gotten that exercise if it wasn't for Ingress.

02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:33.420
So that's part of the reason why I'm still into the game.

02:29:33.420 --> 02:29:36.820
But as far as like, is Google spying on me and so forth?

02:29:36.820 --> 02:29:39.100
What is the real intention of Ingress?

02:29:39.100 --> 02:29:45.180
I kind of think even Google doesn't know what the fuck Ingress is, and I think that's part

02:29:45.180 --> 02:29:46.740
of what Google does sometimes.

02:29:46.740 --> 02:29:51.000
And we have heard of the fact that they're supposed to be using that technology in some

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:57.120
other games that they're making, like there's this whole thing, that guy who got into trouble

02:29:57.120 --> 02:30:01.740
with Oprah, what was his name, James Frey, is now writing some novel that is going to

02:30:01.740 --> 02:30:07.060
be teaming up with the people who made Ingress for some other type of ARG.

02:30:07.060 --> 02:30:14.220
And Google with the Ingress, it allows them to get pictures of things from people on foot

02:30:14.220 --> 02:30:19.260
in places that cars can't get into, like parks, like trails.

02:30:19.260 --> 02:30:23.500
And that is information about like, where are all these landmarks that people might

02:30:23.500 --> 02:30:24.500
want to see?

02:30:24.500 --> 02:30:26.900
That is information that they could turn around and market as well.

02:30:26.900 --> 02:30:32.260
So I do think there's data in that regard that they can get from Ingress, but I highly

02:30:32.260 --> 02:30:35.120
doubt Google's making a lot of money off Ingress, if at all.

02:30:35.120 --> 02:30:37.820
They occasionally have their commercial sponsor, but that's really it.

02:30:37.820 --> 02:30:40.140
But am I worried that Google's tracking that?

02:30:40.140 --> 02:30:43.820
I kind of feel like if they wanted to track it, they'd already be doing it.

02:30:43.820 --> 02:30:45.940
They wouldn't need Ingress for me to do it.

02:30:45.940 --> 02:30:50.980
I mean, hell, Apple would find my friends in that location thing.

02:30:50.980 --> 02:30:54.740
I mean, Apple knows where I'm at all the time.

02:30:54.740 --> 02:30:58.140
And it's one of those double-edged swords because it's like, I want that because if

02:30:58.140 --> 02:31:02.660
my phone ever gets stolen, excuse me, I want to be able to find it.

02:31:02.660 --> 02:31:06.100
I want to know who has my phone and tell the police, go here, it's in this shed.

02:31:06.100 --> 02:31:07.100
You know?

02:31:07.100 --> 02:31:09.100
So it's a double-edged sword.

02:31:09.100 --> 02:31:14.260
Kaijuto in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com says, Google doesn't give a shit where you're

02:31:14.260 --> 02:31:15.260
at.

02:31:15.260 --> 02:31:16.260
They just want to make that paper.

02:31:16.260 --> 02:31:20.100
Raginator says, what are the odds that Google's feeding the government any and all data they

02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:21.740
gather from your Ingress use?

02:31:21.740 --> 02:31:28.140
See, I just, again, I just feel like you're starting to get a little tinfoil hat.

02:31:28.140 --> 02:31:32.020
And I'm not saying you shouldn't question things.

02:31:32.020 --> 02:31:33.020
That's fine.

02:31:33.020 --> 02:31:36.800
But I also, I'm just, the reality is if the government wants to know where you're at,

02:31:36.800 --> 02:31:40.320
they don't need Ingress to do it, and they don't need a lot of other stuff to do it.

02:31:40.320 --> 02:31:41.800
They'll find it.

02:31:41.800 --> 02:31:46.560
Just kind of what I believe to be the case, but maybe I'm wrong.

02:31:46.560 --> 02:31:48.920
Anyhow, I still welcome all your opinions.

02:31:48.920 --> 02:31:53.660
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com if you wish to send us an email for next week.

02:31:53.660 --> 02:31:58.960
In the meantime, this is the point of the show where we get into the FUs of the week.

02:31:58.960 --> 02:31:59.960
Why?

02:31:59.960 --> 02:32:00.880
Because FU, that's why.

02:32:06.800 --> 02:32:17.800
Loki.

02:32:17.800 --> 02:32:19.840
I love my kids.

02:32:19.840 --> 02:32:21.520
I love my son Josh.

02:32:21.520 --> 02:32:30.440
But at the same time, I am fucking pissed off at him for, he's very sensitive, I guess.

02:32:30.440 --> 02:32:33.200
And he was super excited to go to the Marvel show and everything.

02:32:33.200 --> 02:32:37.800
So you know, I figured, it's only here once this year, so if I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna

02:32:37.800 --> 02:32:38.800
do it right.

02:32:38.800 --> 02:32:41.840
I'm gonna get some seats so we can actually see everything, we're not gonna be way up

02:32:41.840 --> 02:32:45.720
in the bleachers and stuff like that.

02:32:45.720 --> 02:32:47.800
And he fucking got scared five minutes in.

02:32:47.800 --> 02:32:50.860
And that shit was fucking expensive.

02:32:50.860 --> 02:32:53.640
That's like throwing away $200.

02:32:53.640 --> 02:32:59.520
And I was just fucking pissed at him and just yelling at him when I really shouldn't be

02:32:59.520 --> 02:33:00.520
doing that.

02:33:00.520 --> 02:33:07.480
Seriously though, what's up with kids not appreciating what you're doing for them?

02:33:07.480 --> 02:33:08.480
Someday he will.

02:33:08.480 --> 02:33:13.360
Be sure to tell him about how scared he got when he's 18, he'll really appreciate that.

02:33:13.360 --> 02:33:14.640
I will be sure to do that.

02:33:14.640 --> 02:33:18.480
Maybe we can save this recording for him when he turns 18.

02:33:18.480 --> 02:33:19.480
Sure.

02:33:19.480 --> 02:33:20.480
All right.

02:33:20.480 --> 02:33:23.280
Uh oh, Alan wants to share a story with us, why don't you grab that yellow mic on the

02:33:23.280 --> 02:33:25.000
table over there Alan.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:26.360
Hi Alan, welcome to the studio.

02:33:26.360 --> 02:33:27.360
Hello.

02:33:27.360 --> 02:33:28.360
It's not like you live here or anything.

02:33:28.360 --> 02:33:29.360
Yeah.

02:33:29.360 --> 02:33:30.360
How's Diablo 3 going for you?

02:33:31.200 --> 02:33:33.200
What paragon level are you now?

02:33:33.200 --> 02:33:34.200
385.

02:33:34.200 --> 02:33:35.200
Oh my God.

02:33:35.200 --> 02:33:36.200
All right.

02:33:36.200 --> 02:33:40.440
When I was five or six, my mom took me to Sesame Street Live where they do the stage

02:33:40.440 --> 02:33:45.800
show and Big Bird is there and I was so happy and I got like second or third row seats and

02:33:45.800 --> 02:33:50.240
they were having at the end, they were giving like t-shirts and balloons to certain kids.

02:33:50.240 --> 02:33:53.480
They were picking people out of the audience to come up and hug Big Bird.

02:33:53.480 --> 02:33:57.660
And of course five or six year old's dream is to hug Big Bird.

02:33:58.260 --> 02:34:01.940
I know some people that are 35 that would love to hug Big Bird.

02:34:01.940 --> 02:34:03.820
I would now because I'm six four, a fucker's tall.

02:34:03.820 --> 02:34:04.820
So I'm like, here's a big hug.

02:34:04.820 --> 02:34:09.620
I'm not having to hug a midget, a little person, sorry.

02:34:09.620 --> 02:34:12.580
And they didn't pick me and they're like, that's it, good night.

02:34:12.580 --> 02:34:15.060
I was devastated.

02:34:15.060 --> 02:34:21.500
I cried, like threw up, like I was crying that hard for hours after.

02:34:21.500 --> 02:34:26.780
My mom was like, if they can't give every single kid a thing, because that was like

02:34:26.780 --> 02:34:31.780
a waste of money because I was enjoying it up until the very end and I didn't get picked

02:34:31.780 --> 02:34:33.260
to go up on stage and hug Big Bird.

02:34:33.260 --> 02:34:35.100
So I cry.

02:34:35.100 --> 02:34:37.300
So basically my point is that kids suck.

02:34:37.300 --> 02:34:38.300
They're shitty.

02:34:38.300 --> 02:34:40.100
Well, I just say like, at least you got to sit there.

02:34:40.100 --> 02:34:43.260
I would be fine if like they did the same thing, you know, if that was what happened,

02:34:43.260 --> 02:34:45.900
but like, well, you know, listen, they can't possibly get that.

02:34:45.900 --> 02:34:46.900
Look how many kids are here.

02:34:46.900 --> 02:34:47.900
They can't give something out there.

02:34:47.900 --> 02:34:49.500
At least we got to see the show.

02:34:49.500 --> 02:34:52.560
But it was like, I didn't get to see shit.

02:34:52.560 --> 02:34:55.340
What I saw of the show, I already watched on YouTube.

02:34:55.340 --> 02:35:00.340
So I could have saved myself $200 by fucking watching.

02:35:00.340 --> 02:35:03.140
You have several people in the chat room that are going, but he's just a kid, Loki.

02:35:03.140 --> 02:35:04.140
I understand that.

02:35:04.140 --> 02:35:05.400
But there's other kids.

02:35:05.400 --> 02:35:08.260
There was a ton of other kids in his age group, OK?

02:35:08.260 --> 02:35:09.260
This is a kid.

02:35:09.260 --> 02:35:12.300
He is super like sensitive to like loud noises and stuff like that.

02:35:12.300 --> 02:35:14.300
And you still love your kid, which is reiterated at the beginning.

02:35:14.300 --> 02:35:17.220
I still love him, but like it's frustrating sometimes because I want to take him to do

02:35:17.220 --> 02:35:21.460
all these fun things and he gets fucking scared over everything.

02:35:21.460 --> 02:35:24.540
And he'll make up stuff to be scared about.

02:35:25.060 --> 02:35:27.340
The nephew of the week is to vent.

02:35:27.340 --> 02:35:28.340
But I will say this.

02:35:28.340 --> 02:35:31.300
You know what's going to happen, Loki, is that, and this happens with a lot of kids,

02:35:31.300 --> 02:35:34.500
around age like six or seven, he's just going to transform.

02:35:34.500 --> 02:35:38.060
And suddenly it's going to be like, now the kid will be like a little brat.

02:35:38.060 --> 02:35:39.060
And you won't be...

02:35:39.060 --> 02:35:40.060
He already is!

02:35:40.060 --> 02:35:41.060
It doesn't matter.

02:35:41.060 --> 02:35:42.060
It doesn't...

02:35:42.060 --> 02:35:43.060
I don't get the any of...

02:35:43.060 --> 02:35:44.300
There is no upside.

02:35:44.300 --> 02:35:47.020
He is a brat and fucking...

02:35:47.020 --> 02:35:48.020
Just like daddy.

02:35:48.020 --> 02:35:50.820
It's like, there is no upside.

02:35:50.820 --> 02:35:53.260
All right.

02:35:53.260 --> 02:35:54.260
I like that story.

02:35:54.980 --> 02:35:55.980
Thank you.

02:35:55.980 --> 02:35:58.740
I'm so glad you could talk about how Big Bird made you throw up here on the show.

02:35:58.740 --> 02:35:59.740
Yeah.

02:35:59.740 --> 02:36:00.740
Well, he didn't hug me.

02:36:00.740 --> 02:36:01.740
If he hugged me, I would have been fine.

02:36:01.740 --> 02:36:04.700
But I wailed for hours.

02:36:04.700 --> 02:36:08.620
Now I feel like for your birthday, I should put on a Big Bird costume and come out and

02:36:08.620 --> 02:36:09.620
give you a hug.

02:36:09.620 --> 02:36:10.620
Don't take it there.

02:36:10.620 --> 02:36:11.620
No.

02:36:11.620 --> 02:36:14.100
So here's what I'll do differently.

02:36:14.100 --> 02:36:16.860
Next time, if I were to do something differently, I wouldn't sit as close because I think if

02:36:16.860 --> 02:36:21.360
we were sitting up like at the top of the, you know, the lower section or something,

02:36:21.360 --> 02:36:23.140
it wouldn't have been so bad.

02:36:23.140 --> 02:36:25.700
It's just that they're doing live pyrotechnics in the front.

02:36:25.700 --> 02:36:29.020
He's never seen a show with live pyrotechnics and stuff.

02:36:29.020 --> 02:36:31.700
And so it's a little bit, you know, frightening for him.

02:36:31.700 --> 02:36:32.700
All right.

02:36:32.700 --> 02:36:33.700
So at least you have a lesson learned out of this.

02:36:33.700 --> 02:36:34.700
I understand that.

02:36:34.700 --> 02:36:38.260
But yeah, and also the lesson is I'm not going to waste $200 on fucking tickets too.

02:36:38.260 --> 02:36:40.500
They wanted $12 fucking dollars for popcorn.

02:36:40.500 --> 02:36:41.500
I bought that popcorn.

02:36:41.500 --> 02:36:44.740
I damn well am going to eat every single piece of that popcorn.

02:36:44.740 --> 02:36:45.740
It's not gone yet.

02:36:45.740 --> 02:36:50.700
But they seriously wanted like $15 for a fucking snow cone.

02:36:50.700 --> 02:36:52.940
I mean, come on.

02:36:52.940 --> 02:36:56.620
Speaking of stadium events and paying too much money, I want to give an FU this week

02:36:56.620 --> 02:36:59.140
to the San Jose Sharks.

02:36:59.140 --> 02:37:00.140
You're my team, guys.

02:37:00.140 --> 02:37:01.140
You're my team.

02:37:01.140 --> 02:37:02.620
You're my hometown team.

02:37:02.620 --> 02:37:06.740
You got to break Alan's hockey cherry as well, going to his first Sharks game.

02:37:06.740 --> 02:37:09.220
Did you have fun at the Sharks game, Alan?

02:37:09.220 --> 02:37:13.140
I did, but I have to give a shout out to those seats we got.

02:37:13.140 --> 02:37:14.140
Oh, yeah.

02:37:14.140 --> 02:37:19.380
It would have been nice if they had won with those seats, but we were eight rows from rink.

02:37:19.380 --> 02:37:20.380
Yeah.

02:37:20.380 --> 02:37:21.380
No, that was awesome.

02:37:21.380 --> 02:37:22.380
That was my buddy, Neil.

02:37:22.380 --> 02:37:24.580
He's been playing in the zone since high school that helped hook us up with that.

02:37:24.580 --> 02:37:26.620
So thank you.

02:37:26.620 --> 02:37:27.900
Very appreciative about that.

02:37:27.900 --> 02:37:32.560
But yeah, FU San Jose Sharks for just choking in the third period.

02:37:32.560 --> 02:37:35.980
It was tied 2-2 at the end of the second period.

02:37:35.980 --> 02:37:42.940
And then period three started and the Black Hawks were like, you know what, we're tired

02:37:42.940 --> 02:37:43.940
of this.

02:37:43.940 --> 02:37:45.500
We're just going to win now.

02:37:45.500 --> 02:37:46.500
Yep.

02:37:46.500 --> 02:37:47.500
Man.

02:37:47.500 --> 02:37:52.320
But at the very least, the very least, because before the show, the Kill Time, because he

02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:55.800
had a Batman shirt on that I just wasn't going to do.

02:37:55.800 --> 02:37:59.560
So we went and bought Marvel shirts and so he got an Avenger shirt and I got a Deadpool

02:37:59.560 --> 02:38:00.560
shirt.

02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:01.560
So at least I have a Deadpool shirt.

02:38:01.560 --> 02:38:02.560
At least you have a Deadpool shirt.

02:38:02.560 --> 02:38:05.320
At least I have a Deadpool shirt and some popcorn that I'm going to eat no matter how

02:38:05.320 --> 02:38:06.320
stale it gets.

02:38:06.320 --> 02:38:08.960
Because I paid $12 for that fucking popcorn.

02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:13.200
I am eating every piece of that popcorn.

02:38:13.200 --> 02:38:17.040
Tigerclaw in chat says, what if your presence at the game is the reason why the team lost,

02:38:17.040 --> 02:38:18.040
Rob?

02:38:18.040 --> 02:38:19.040
Just saying.

02:38:19.040 --> 02:38:20.040
Yeah, because that's two losses in a row now.

02:38:20.040 --> 02:38:22.040
They saying you're a cooler?

02:38:22.260 --> 02:38:23.260
You know what?

02:38:23.260 --> 02:38:24.260
Don't go there.

02:38:24.260 --> 02:38:25.260
I am.

02:38:25.260 --> 02:38:29.760
I'm sorry if my radiant beauty and presence just throws the team off their game.

02:38:29.760 --> 02:38:30.760
I can't.

02:38:30.760 --> 02:38:31.760
I can't.

02:38:31.760 --> 02:38:35.120
My friends are already suggesting that I'm the cause of the losses, but I'm telling you

02:38:35.120 --> 02:38:40.320
four goals in one period and removing the goalie from the net so they could score on

02:38:40.320 --> 02:38:41.320
an empty net.

02:38:41.320 --> 02:38:43.320
These were not my decisions, people.

02:38:43.320 --> 02:38:44.320
Not my decisions.

02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:48.320
Anyhow, just a few more stories for you guys and we're going to open up the Skyline quickly

02:38:48.320 --> 02:38:49.320
to get your calls.

02:38:49.320 --> 02:38:53.160
I'm a little late here tonight because of the announcements we did live on VoG before

02:38:53.160 --> 02:38:57.200
the show tonight, but I do want to at least try to get one or two calls in, especially

02:38:57.200 --> 02:39:01.200
people might want to talk about GDC, South by Southwest, PAX, or one of the many things

02:39:01.200 --> 02:39:03.200
that have been going on over the past couple weeks.

02:39:03.200 --> 02:39:06.200
1-877-GAMO-LR or a username on Skype, Orange Law and Tradeo.

02:39:06.200 --> 02:39:10.080
But first, before I get to those calls, a few more stories for you guys.

02:39:10.080 --> 02:39:11.080
Loki.

02:39:11.080 --> 02:39:19.240
So, Marvelous has just acquired G-mode and with that they've also acquired most of

02:39:19.240 --> 02:39:27.240
Data East's intellectual properties, including Magical Drop, Joe and Mac, which, shit, when's

02:39:27.240 --> 02:39:33.080
there been, when's the last time we had a Joe and Mac game, SNES?

02:39:33.080 --> 02:39:38.560
Let's see, Fighter's History, Caveman Ninja, and BurgerTime, among others.

02:39:38.560 --> 02:39:39.560
Yes!

02:39:39.560 --> 02:39:42.040
So maybe we'll get another BurgerTime game.

02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:43.040
Yes!

02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:45.400
That'd be pretty sweet.

02:39:45.400 --> 02:39:46.400
What else do they have?

02:39:46.400 --> 02:39:51.480
They also have, I guess, Metal Max, I still remember that, and Vapor Trail.

02:39:51.480 --> 02:39:55.120
So I wonder if we'll see some more games from that, hopefully, hopefully they do something

02:39:55.120 --> 02:39:56.120
with it.

02:39:56.120 --> 02:39:57.280
I mean, obviously they would do something with it.

02:39:57.280 --> 02:39:58.280
Why would you purchase it?

02:39:58.280 --> 02:40:00.200
Why would they buy it if they're not going to do anything with it, right?

02:40:00.200 --> 02:40:03.720
Data East, so, uh, does that mean we're going to get a new Bad Dudes game?

02:40:03.720 --> 02:40:05.320
Are we going to get a new Bad Dudes game?

02:40:05.320 --> 02:40:07.080
Are they a bad enough dude to put out Bad Dudes?

02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:10.000
Can we get a new Bad Dudes game, because that'd be pretty sweet.

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.760
I don't know, Bad Dudes is kind of one of the games, it actually wasn't very good.

02:40:12.760 --> 02:40:15.000
Like I don't know if you ever played Bad Dudes on the NES, it really wasn't good.

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:19.880
I played Bad Dudes all the time, and I could never do a fucking Roundhouse game with it.

02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:20.880
Never.

02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:23.840
It was... it was too hard.

02:40:23.840 --> 02:40:30.560
Alright, uh, this is interesting, something, it's a peripheral for the Oculus Rift, you

02:40:30.560 --> 02:40:32.880
know, VR, it's where everything's going.

02:40:32.880 --> 02:40:34.440
That looks like a creepy face.

02:40:34.440 --> 02:40:36.440
Lots of people talking about the Oculus Rift.

02:40:36.440 --> 02:40:40.840
Well that creepy face that Loki is referring to is Feel Real.

02:40:40.840 --> 02:40:47.400
It is a Bluetooth add-on for the Oculus Rift that straps over your mouth and nose.

02:40:47.400 --> 02:40:51.600
It looks like a creepy face that you'd be making out with.

02:40:51.600 --> 02:40:54.480
It looks like a creepy like face that you would make out with or something.

02:40:54.480 --> 02:40:59.120
Yeah, it does kind of look like something you would make out with, but uh, anyway, this

02:40:59.120 --> 02:41:05.080
battery powered device will produce seven different scents.

02:41:05.080 --> 02:41:08.440
Like smelly scents, not like money, but scents.

02:41:08.440 --> 02:41:14.120
So it's smell-o-vision with this thing, with unique scents that you can smell.

02:41:14.120 --> 02:41:20.640
So this mask will allow you to smell things like the ocean, a waterfall, or fire.

02:41:20.640 --> 02:41:27.920
Also I guess this will produce temperature controlled air, mist, and vibrations.

02:41:27.920 --> 02:41:36.120
So um, that's uh, that's something every game just gets one step closer to the holodeck,

02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:37.120
doesn't it?

02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:41.560
But now the holodeck will smell like fire and spray you with water and other temperature

02:41:41.560 --> 02:41:42.560
controlled elements.

02:41:42.560 --> 02:41:46.160
So you got to admit though, I mean, as much as we're kind of sitting here and making fun

02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:50.360
of the way it looks and so forth, it does seem like a logical step.

02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:55.000
If you're going to put this thing over your eyes and be immersed in this world with all

02:41:55.000 --> 02:42:00.720
your vision, wouldn't it make sense that, you know, the temp, the other feelings besides

02:42:00.720 --> 02:42:04.500
just your vision, your other senses are stimulated as well and it makes sense.

02:42:04.500 --> 02:42:08.540
That would be cool except, you know, when I'm smelling fire in game and I just don't

02:42:08.540 --> 02:42:13.340
realize that my house is burning down because I have a giant VR headset over me.

02:42:13.340 --> 02:42:18.760
What if you're playing a very violent game on Oculus Rift and you're smelling blood?

02:42:18.760 --> 02:42:22.700
Or people, you know, relieving themselves as you murder them, so.

02:42:22.700 --> 02:42:24.220
That might be a bit much actually.

02:42:24.220 --> 02:42:28.180
I don't, I think smell-o-vision, everyone tries to do smell-o-vision, I just don't think

02:42:28.180 --> 02:42:32.420
it's going to work until you can get it to where you can simulate any smell.

02:42:32.420 --> 02:42:36.700
And even then it's just, I think it's just too hard of a sense to do.

02:42:36.700 --> 02:42:39.060
We don't understand enough about how it works.

02:42:39.060 --> 02:42:43.460
Yeah, usually the smell-o-vision stuff is very limited but, you know, I think about

02:42:43.460 --> 02:42:47.740
like some of the Disney stuff where they kind of like, you know, people love Soarin', right?

02:42:47.740 --> 02:42:50.980
At Disney World they have Soarin' or Soarin' over California or whatever it's called and

02:42:50.980 --> 02:42:53.160
they have it here at California Adventure as well.

02:42:53.160 --> 02:42:56.720
Like a lot of people really like that ride because, again, a lot of your senses are being

02:42:56.720 --> 02:43:00.780
stimulated because you have the vision, which isn't quite the same as Oculus Rift.

02:43:00.780 --> 02:43:02.740
They need a better screen for that nowadays.

02:43:02.740 --> 02:43:05.780
They're actually, they're refurbing it right now as we speak, it's down and the screen

02:43:05.780 --> 02:43:09.980
is getting an HD refurbishment so, your wish is Disney's command, right?

02:43:09.980 --> 02:43:10.980
The magic never ends.

02:43:10.980 --> 02:43:11.980
It better be.

02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:17.940
So, but then not only that but you have that sensation of flying which simulates your senses

02:43:17.940 --> 02:43:22.260
as well and then, yes, even though it's limited, you know, you smell the oranges when you go

02:43:22.260 --> 02:43:25.860
over the orange field and you smell the pine trees and you go over the pine field and I

02:43:25.860 --> 02:43:29.980
think that's really why people love that ride because it's so many different senses all

02:43:29.980 --> 02:43:30.980
being hit at once.

02:43:30.980 --> 02:43:32.660
It's a nice air-conditioned building.

02:43:32.660 --> 02:43:34.580
Yes, that is true.

02:43:34.580 --> 02:43:35.580
That is very true.

02:43:35.580 --> 02:43:38.260
No, or hardly ever a line.

02:43:38.260 --> 02:43:40.740
Kaijuto is wondering, what if I'm playing The Binding of Isaac?

02:43:40.740 --> 02:43:41.740
Well, you know.

02:43:41.740 --> 02:43:44.780
Well, you're gonna smell a lot of blood and feces, I guess.

02:43:44.780 --> 02:43:46.900
Here's the thing, too.

02:43:46.900 --> 02:43:47.900
A lot of game.

02:43:47.900 --> 02:43:53.180
He didn't mention what those other smells were, so it's ocean, fire, and vomit and shit.

02:43:53.180 --> 02:43:58.740
Yeah, and a nerd expo, but no, here's the thing.

02:43:58.740 --> 02:44:03.260
Keep in mind that the goal of the Rift is to not just port all the old games into the

02:44:03.260 --> 02:44:04.260
Rift.

02:44:04.260 --> 02:44:06.340
That's kind of doing it wrong, I think, in many ways.

02:44:06.340 --> 02:44:11.260
Like, you know, we had that 8-bit Zelda experience in the Rift.

02:44:11.260 --> 02:44:15.660
Look, Zelda was not designed to be a Rift game, but there are some pretty cool experiences,

02:44:15.660 --> 02:44:16.660
you know, on the Rift.

02:44:16.660 --> 02:44:21.940
I would love an 8-bit style game that would look like Zelda in the Rift.

02:44:21.940 --> 02:44:24.900
Yeah, but it would have to be something that's kind of developed by that.

02:44:24.900 --> 02:44:28.900
But I mean, like, for example, Bobby let me check out his Gear VR, which is the thing

02:44:28.900 --> 02:44:33.260
that the Note 4 mobile device, you just pop it right in the headset and do it.

02:44:33.260 --> 02:44:34.260
You know what I want?

02:44:34.260 --> 02:44:35.260
What?

02:44:35.260 --> 02:44:36.260
Like, super bad.

02:44:36.260 --> 02:44:37.260
Stop interrupting my story.

02:44:37.260 --> 02:44:38.260
Oh, sorry.

02:44:38.260 --> 02:44:42.540
But I saw this Paul McCartney concert in it, and this Cirque du Soleil thing.

02:44:42.540 --> 02:44:47.020
These weren't games, but they were experiences that, like Soarin' Over California, might

02:44:47.020 --> 02:44:50.620
be kind of cool with the smell, but I just don't see where you could get that at a consumer

02:44:50.620 --> 02:44:51.620
level.

02:44:51.620 --> 02:44:52.620
And it would be very limited.

02:44:52.620 --> 02:44:54.180
All right, yes, your Tangent Loki.

02:44:54.180 --> 02:44:55.620
I want Zelda Maker.

02:44:55.620 --> 02:44:58.500
Oh, if Mario Maker does really well, you want Zelda Maker?

02:44:58.500 --> 02:45:00.340
I don't even give a shit if Mario Maker does really well.

02:45:00.340 --> 02:45:02.160
I want Zelda Maker.

02:45:02.160 --> 02:45:03.160
And then Metroid Maker.

02:45:03.160 --> 02:45:04.980
Let's do all of those.

02:45:04.980 --> 02:45:08.580
You know, if Nintendo was- Or Mario Kart Maker, they'd never do that,

02:45:08.580 --> 02:45:09.580
though.

02:45:09.580 --> 02:45:13.740
If Nintendo was listening to you on this program right now, Loki, they probably turned it off

02:45:13.740 --> 02:45:15.300
about 90 minutes ago.

02:45:15.300 --> 02:45:17.900
I'm sorry, they're throwing away money, okay?

02:45:17.900 --> 02:45:21.660
You know, I understand that you really want to keep him happy, and that's fine.

02:45:21.660 --> 02:45:26.020
He'll make his Mario games later on in Star Fox and all that fun stuff, but I'm sorry.

02:45:26.020 --> 02:45:34.300
It's just not gonna- I love the guy, but it's just- I don't see those being successful.

02:45:34.300 --> 02:45:35.300
I just don't.

02:45:35.300 --> 02:45:36.300
But you know what?

02:45:36.300 --> 02:45:38.100
Prove me wrong, please.

02:45:38.100 --> 02:45:39.700
I hope that I'm wrong.

02:45:39.700 --> 02:45:43.980
I just think it's gonna flop, and it's gonna suck, or it's just nothing's gonna ever happen

02:45:43.980 --> 02:45:44.980
with it.

02:45:44.980 --> 02:45:45.980
It's more of an experiment, and that's it.

02:45:45.980 --> 02:45:49.380
Yeah, Dartitsuya is saying, are you sure you're not gonna dog on Zelda Maker if they do it?

02:45:50.100 --> 02:45:52.940
All right, Nsj100Matt says, or Mega Man Maker?

02:45:52.940 --> 02:45:53.940
Oh, wait.

02:45:53.940 --> 02:45:54.940
Womp, womp, womp.

02:45:54.940 --> 02:45:59.140
Well, hey, we could have had that at one time, you know, but that never-

02:45:59.140 --> 02:46:00.140
That's the joke.

02:46:00.140 --> 02:46:03.580
Well, technically they had that on PSP, but you know.

02:46:03.580 --> 02:46:07.480
Back on the Smellovision real quick, Kaijuto is saying, didn't TGIF do smell stuff?

02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:08.480
It was whack.

02:46:08.480 --> 02:46:09.620
TV Guide.

02:46:09.620 --> 02:46:10.620
I remember.

02:46:10.620 --> 02:46:14.260
I wasn't alive then, but I remember the DVD release of this, where they kind of brought

02:46:14.260 --> 02:46:16.700
it back for a little bit, and I remember reading about it.

02:46:16.700 --> 02:46:18.660
Wait, how are you- oh, okay.

02:46:18.660 --> 02:46:24.500
In the 70s, Pink Flamingos, the cult John Waters movie that's really explicit, right?

02:46:24.500 --> 02:46:27.440
They had a whole smell- no, wait, no, it wasn't Pink Flamingos, it was one of the other John

02:46:27.440 --> 02:46:28.540
Waters movies.

02:46:28.540 --> 02:46:30.400
Was it Polyester?

02:46:30.400 --> 02:46:33.540
One of them had like a Smellovision card, and when the DVD came out, you could actually

02:46:33.540 --> 02:46:36.980
get the Smellovision card, came with it, and you could kind of experience it all over again,

02:46:36.980 --> 02:46:40.400
and that was like John Waters' thing, was it was- and of course, some of them were like

02:46:40.400 --> 02:46:45.880
roses and nice things, and some of them were like poop and offensive things that I would

02:46:45.880 --> 02:46:47.900
advise you don't scratch and sniff.

02:46:47.900 --> 02:46:52.080
But like, that was kind of a fad in the 70s and 80s.

02:46:52.080 --> 02:46:55.380
So anyway, moving on.

02:46:55.380 --> 02:46:57.140
Loki, one more story.

02:46:57.140 --> 02:47:02.620
So hey, Rob, I hope you're happy we finally got a new F-Zero game.

02:47:02.620 --> 02:47:03.620
What?

02:47:03.620 --> 02:47:05.900
Why did we wait till the end of the show to talk about this?

02:47:05.900 --> 02:47:13.420
Because it's actually, it's an unofficial port of F-Zero to the, what was it, the MegaDrive.

02:47:13.420 --> 02:47:15.620
So G-Zero is what it's called now.

02:47:15.620 --> 02:47:16.620
Oh, okay.

02:47:16.620 --> 02:47:21.100
It doesn't have Mode 7, but it looks nice.

02:47:21.100 --> 02:47:22.700
I wonder how that runs.

02:47:22.700 --> 02:47:25.060
It's got to look kind of funky on a Genesis.

02:47:25.060 --> 02:47:26.060
I heard it sounds good though.

02:47:26.060 --> 02:47:31.580
I don't know, they don't have any video of it, but they were saying, you know, this is

02:47:31.580 --> 02:47:35.880
cool, doesn't look bad either, colorful, fits the spirit of the original, and it says this

02:47:35.880 --> 02:47:39.220
is beyond excellent, just the music alone brings tears to my eyes.

02:47:39.220 --> 02:47:41.700
So you know what's kind of cool?

02:47:41.700 --> 02:47:48.900
On the subject of this too, I watched a video of someone that had ported Street Fighter

02:47:48.900 --> 02:47:57.740
2 Turbo Edition to the Virtual Boy, and it actually looked kind of cool.

02:47:57.740 --> 02:48:04.780
So man, Virtual Boy, in some ways that thing was just ahead of its time, right?

02:48:04.780 --> 02:48:05.780
I don't know.

02:48:05.780 --> 02:48:07.780
I think they should try it again.

02:48:07.780 --> 02:48:12.300
All right, well we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username

02:48:12.300 --> 02:48:15.460
on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

02:48:15.460 --> 02:48:19.300
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, so call in and lend yours to the conversation,

02:48:19.300 --> 02:48:22.820
anything we talked about this week, or maybe something that we missed.

02:48:22.820 --> 02:48:24.980
The Skype line is open now.

02:48:24.980 --> 02:48:29.180
Meanwhile, Loki, I don't know if you have any last minute stories, I think we touched

02:48:29.180 --> 02:48:33.860
on, it was kind of a quiet this week, quiet week this week, because last week was kind

02:48:33.860 --> 02:48:37.260
of busy, the week we were gone unfortunately, but we tried to hit on some of the big stuff.

02:48:37.740 --> 02:48:40.020
I don't know if you have any other last minute stories, Loki.

02:48:40.020 --> 02:48:41.540
I don't think so.

02:48:41.540 --> 02:48:42.540
No?

02:48:42.540 --> 02:48:43.540
Yeah.

02:48:43.540 --> 02:48:44.540
No, that's all right.

02:48:44.540 --> 02:48:45.540
It happens.

02:48:45.540 --> 02:48:48.860
We actually are getting some calls coming in, so we can get to the Skype line.

02:48:48.860 --> 02:48:50.060
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:48:50.060 --> 02:48:51.060
Who's this?

02:48:51.060 --> 02:48:53.060
Yes, this is Azur Man.

02:48:53.060 --> 02:48:54.060
Hey, what's up?

02:48:54.060 --> 02:48:55.060
Azur Man.

02:48:55.060 --> 02:48:56.060
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:48:56.060 --> 02:48:57.060
Too much.

02:48:57.060 --> 02:48:58.060
Two things.

02:48:58.060 --> 02:49:05.380
You guys were just basically speaking earlier with the program world and the 2DX issues.

02:49:05.380 --> 02:49:09.500
Yes, our special correspondent, YYR, bringing us the info on that.

02:49:09.500 --> 02:49:18.700
Yeah, I kind of play on the East Coast at Chinatown Fair, and we kind of had that issue.

02:49:18.700 --> 02:49:24.260
We had basically the machine for a pendulum for about a few months, and it was kind of

02:49:24.260 --> 02:49:30.300
a big damper when everything was going down, but what I basically wanted to talk about

02:49:30.300 --> 02:49:41.940
was that radio shows like this and other communities like Bimani style kind of keeps

02:49:41.940 --> 02:49:48.780
people like me who like 2DX playing games like that and keeping ... I'm sorry, I'm trying

02:49:48.780 --> 02:49:49.780
to get my thoughts together.

02:49:49.780 --> 02:49:59.820
What I'm trying to say is that Konami really knew about this whole issue with the people

02:49:59.820 --> 02:50:05.300
in America playing the game, but it seems that you might be right that round one might

02:50:05.300 --> 02:50:10.860
want to try to have some sort of monopoly over it and maybe bring it over here, but

02:50:10.860 --> 02:50:16.180
it's kind of depressing to kind of find out like you can't play it at all in the store

02:50:16.180 --> 02:50:17.180
anymore.

02:50:17.180 --> 02:50:19.340
Yeah, and you know what?

02:50:19.340 --> 02:50:24.940
You bring a very difficult but logical point up that people have to consider whether they

02:50:24.940 --> 02:50:31.020
want to hear it or not, and that is that Konami turned a blind eye to this for a very,

02:50:31.020 --> 02:50:32.580
very long time.

02:50:32.580 --> 02:50:36.780
I mean, even back when we talked about nothing but DDR, I mean, think about it.

02:50:36.780 --> 02:50:41.580
DDR Extreme Machines weren't even supposed to be here in the US, and everybody had them

02:50:41.580 --> 02:50:47.700
anyway, so Konami's turned a very blind eye to this for a very long time, and so for it

02:50:47.700 --> 02:50:52.780
just now to have the rug pulled out kind of stings a little bit for a lot of people, I

02:50:52.780 --> 02:50:53.780
get.

02:50:53.780 --> 02:50:56.220
But on the other hand, I can also see why.

02:50:56.220 --> 02:51:00.060
I don't want to villainize round one in this either because I could also see it from their

02:51:00.060 --> 02:51:04.380
perspective where if round one is like, hey, if we're going to play by the rules, then

02:51:04.380 --> 02:51:06.700
everyone else needs to play by the rules.

02:51:06.700 --> 02:51:11.180
What I would love to see happen in this scenario, I think, I think, you know, what kind of has

02:51:11.180 --> 02:51:15.780
to happen in some ways or else somebody's going to get pissed off is that we really

02:51:15.780 --> 02:51:21.580
need to start tearing down these arbitrary region walls.

02:51:21.580 --> 02:51:25.520
And we've been bitching about this on the 3DS and PlayStation and so forth about region

02:51:25.520 --> 02:51:28.100
locking for the longest time, have we not?

02:51:28.100 --> 02:51:31.020
And isn't this whole thing that we're talking about, isn't this just another form of region

02:51:31.020 --> 02:51:32.020
locking?

02:51:32.020 --> 02:51:36.200
I mean, isn't it time that Konami, I mean, and if the reason, if the real reason they

02:51:36.200 --> 02:51:40.540
shut it all down was to launch E-Amusement Global and now great, everybody can have the

02:51:40.540 --> 02:51:46.540
latest 2DX and everybody can play by the rules, then I think that is, in my opinion,

02:51:46.540 --> 02:51:47.540
a happy ending.

02:51:47.540 --> 02:51:51.140
Although some people may not like the fact that they have to do the 30% of the proceeds

02:51:51.140 --> 02:51:54.900
and it may make it a little tougher for private owners.

02:51:54.900 --> 02:51:59.580
I'm not sure I see a scenario where they can really win, but I think at least all the arcades

02:51:59.580 --> 02:52:01.700
that want to run the machines can do that.

02:52:01.700 --> 02:52:02.700
Yeah.

02:52:02.700 --> 02:52:04.820
I mean, that's one of the issues.

02:52:04.820 --> 02:52:10.860
I mean, it's really hard to get people outside of this small community to play, and I say

02:52:10.860 --> 02:52:15.700
small because compared to the people who play other games like the Street Fighter community,

02:52:15.700 --> 02:52:20.700
the Konami, Bimani's community is rather small.

02:52:20.700 --> 02:52:24.540
And it makes it very difficult for them to kind of like come out with a system, like

02:52:24.540 --> 02:52:26.380
I'm an arcade and played here.

02:52:26.380 --> 02:52:32.100
I had a few friends who had their own arcades and they kind of brought them to big, like

02:52:32.100 --> 02:52:34.900
flea markets and stuff to kind of like have people play.

02:52:34.900 --> 02:52:37.860
And even though it wasn't, they were losing money on it, it wasn't making any money.

02:52:37.860 --> 02:52:42.320
They still tried to keep up with the latest, you know, because the hardware wasn't really

02:52:42.320 --> 02:52:43.320
the problem.

02:52:43.320 --> 02:52:50.940
Once they bought the cabinet, buying the upgrades every single from overseas was rather cheap.

02:52:50.940 --> 02:52:58.300
It was this new network, the EMU's network, where you can't basically play the latest

02:52:58.300 --> 02:53:03.540
mixes without being connected to it, really makes it very difficult for them to keep up

02:53:03.540 --> 02:53:04.540
with it.

02:53:04.540 --> 02:53:07.580
And like, you know, I'm a big fan of all the Bimani music.

02:53:07.580 --> 02:53:11.060
It kind of draws in, we even, I don't know if you're familiar with, we had something

02:53:11.060 --> 02:53:14.220
over here called Ballmani.

02:53:14.220 --> 02:53:20.980
There was actually one of the vendors here in, I think in Massachusetts, Ashley was able

02:53:20.980 --> 02:53:28.140
to get Konami to send over Course K. And he also, he was one of the like DJs for a lot

02:53:28.140 --> 02:53:29.140
of Bimani music.

02:53:29.140 --> 02:53:37.100
He does Hippin' Above, he did, what do you call it again, Rising to the Sky, Rising in

02:53:37.100 --> 02:53:38.600
the Sun.

02:53:38.600 --> 02:53:41.980
And he was actually, he came here, he played a few of his mixes.

02:53:41.980 --> 02:53:43.460
I took a few pictures with him.

02:53:43.460 --> 02:53:45.020
He was really cool.

02:53:45.020 --> 02:53:49.260
And they were trying to like see how people were, you know, they didn't like two years

02:53:49.260 --> 02:53:50.260
of that.

02:53:50.260 --> 02:53:52.540
The other year, I think, REU was supposed to come.

02:53:52.540 --> 02:53:55.820
And it was really cool because they were trying to like see if, you know, if America would

02:53:55.820 --> 02:53:57.940
like it, even though it was a very small group.

02:53:57.940 --> 02:54:01.780
But after that, it kind of just fell apart and we didn't see much about that after that.

02:54:01.780 --> 02:54:05.180
I think the store closed down and somebody else took over the store.

02:54:05.180 --> 02:54:11.820
But you know, out of those 10 years, it was a big part of my like gaming, you know, life.

02:54:11.820 --> 02:54:15.540
I mean, it was either that and Final Fantasy XI, you know, back and forth.

02:54:15.540 --> 02:54:19.100
So this show wouldn't exist without that community.

02:54:19.100 --> 02:54:20.100
It really wouldn't.

02:54:20.100 --> 02:54:24.660
So, I mean, it pains us all to kind of see that Konami doesn't really want anything to

02:54:24.660 --> 02:54:25.660
do with it.

02:54:25.660 --> 02:54:30.700
But at the same time, you know, some of their games were a little half-assed.

02:54:30.700 --> 02:54:32.780
Some of them were very half-assed.

02:54:32.780 --> 02:54:37.140
That pop and music abhoration that is on the Xbox 360, whatever that thing was called,

02:54:37.140 --> 02:54:39.020
Beat and Groovy, that is an insult.

02:54:39.020 --> 02:54:40.020
You know what I mean?

02:54:40.020 --> 02:54:41.020
Yeah, exactly.

02:54:41.020 --> 02:54:42.020
Isn't it?

02:54:42.020 --> 02:54:43.020
That's the word.

02:54:43.020 --> 02:54:46.220
It is an insult because they even, when they bring it to America, they're catering to like

02:54:46.220 --> 02:54:50.280
new players and they're just trying to make sure that it can make their money back.

02:54:50.280 --> 02:54:54.340
And it's not, I mean, like the game is great with the, you know, the actual music they

02:54:54.340 --> 02:54:55.900
have for it right now.

02:54:55.900 --> 02:55:01.220
Changing it and bringing in people who have nothing to do with the genre just makes it

02:55:01.220 --> 02:55:02.220
very difficult.

02:55:02.220 --> 02:55:04.900
I mean, I didn't even touch DJ Hero just because of that, you know?

02:55:04.900 --> 02:55:06.500
Well, but DJ Hero is worth a look.

02:55:06.500 --> 02:55:07.500
It is a different game.

02:55:07.500 --> 02:55:08.780
But anyway, I understand.

02:55:08.780 --> 02:55:11.920
But that's another game that we're not going to get another one of because people, I guess,

02:55:11.920 --> 02:55:12.920
didn't get it or whatever.

02:55:12.920 --> 02:55:13.920
Anyway, my friend, I'm so sorry.

02:55:13.920 --> 02:55:15.640
I got to let you go so we can get some more calls.

02:55:15.640 --> 02:55:18.060
But thank you for calling in and sharing your voice with us.

02:55:18.060 --> 02:55:19.060
No problem.

02:55:19.060 --> 02:55:20.060
All right.

02:55:20.060 --> 02:55:21.060
Take care, my friend.

02:55:21.060 --> 02:55:22.060
Bye-bye.

02:55:22.060 --> 02:55:23.060
All right.

02:55:23.060 --> 02:55:24.060
We're going to get some more calls here.

02:55:24.060 --> 02:55:27.700
I always find it, don't worry if you get a little nervous when you're on air, you forget

02:55:27.700 --> 02:55:28.700
what you're going to say.

02:55:28.700 --> 02:55:31.500
It happens to me every week.

02:55:31.500 --> 02:55:33.620
I always forget what I'm going to say.

02:55:33.620 --> 02:55:35.300
And that is not helping with age.

02:55:35.300 --> 02:55:39.140
That's going to be the problem when I'm a 50-year-old podcaster is I'll be probably

02:55:39.140 --> 02:55:41.660
suffering from even worse memory loss than I do now.

02:55:41.660 --> 02:55:43.300
Anyway, we do have another call on the line.

02:55:43.300 --> 02:55:44.300
We're going to get to it.

02:55:44.300 --> 02:55:45.300
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

02:55:45.300 --> 02:55:46.300
Who's this?

02:55:46.300 --> 02:55:47.300
Hey, what's up?

02:55:47.300 --> 02:55:48.300
This guy's Judo.

02:55:48.300 --> 02:55:49.300
Hey, guys, Judo.

02:55:49.300 --> 02:55:50.300
How you doing?

02:55:50.300 --> 02:55:51.300
I'm doing good, man.

02:55:51.300 --> 02:55:52.300
How are you?

02:55:52.300 --> 02:55:53.300
I'm good.

02:55:53.400 --> 02:55:54.900
How are you?

02:55:54.900 --> 02:55:55.900
I'm very good.

02:55:55.900 --> 02:55:57.380
How was theovid when you said that you were doing?

02:55:57.380 --> 02:55:58.380
I have a week off.

02:55:58.380 --> 02:56:02.500
I was literally in the air when OLR should have been on and it's always a weird feeling,

02:56:02.500 --> 02:56:05.180
but nice to be back home.

02:56:05.180 --> 02:56:06.180
What's on your mind?

02:56:06.180 --> 02:56:07.180
You need to do a show from the air.

02:56:07.180 --> 02:56:08.180
That'd be cool.

02:56:08.180 --> 02:56:10.140
I don't think many people are doing that.

02:56:10.140 --> 02:56:11.700
Oh, do a show from the air?

02:56:11.700 --> 02:56:12.980
Yeah, I can.

02:56:12.980 --> 02:56:13.980
I'm pretty sure.

02:56:13.980 --> 02:56:15.980
You can dab Wi-Fi up in a plane now.

02:56:15.980 --> 02:56:17.260
I haven't played a phone in years.

02:56:17.260 --> 02:56:18.260
They do, actually.

02:56:18.260 --> 02:56:22.860
I was able to chat on Google Chat with Allen from the air, but I don't know if I could

02:56:22.860 --> 02:56:23.860
do that.

02:56:23.860 --> 02:56:24.860
It's a virtual audio cable, man.

02:56:24.860 --> 02:56:25.860
It does wonders.

02:56:25.860 --> 02:56:26.860
Let me put it this way.

02:56:26.860 --> 02:56:30.020
Anyway, I wanted to tell you about Code Name, what is it?

02:56:30.020 --> 02:56:31.020
Code Name Steam.

02:56:31.020 --> 02:56:32.020
That's a great game.

02:56:32.020 --> 02:56:33.860
You need to pick it up as soon as possible.

02:56:33.860 --> 02:56:34.860
Really?

02:56:34.860 --> 02:56:41.020
I'm hearing very mixed reviews on Code Name Steam, or excuse me, Project Steam.

02:56:41.020 --> 02:56:43.500
What are you enjoying about it?

02:56:43.500 --> 02:56:46.380
Just the fact that at first I didn't think I was going to like it because I'm not a fan

02:56:46.380 --> 02:56:47.380
of steampunk.

02:56:47.380 --> 02:56:50.180
I mean, it pretty much has a lot of elements that I don't like.

02:56:50.180 --> 02:56:51.180
I don't like steampunk.

02:56:51.620 --> 02:56:56.460
I don't like American folk culture or folk tales or whatever.

02:56:56.460 --> 02:56:58.340
I definitely don't like MGM.

02:56:58.340 --> 02:57:03.220
I felt like, looking at that game, I felt like it was like if MGM made a game.

02:57:03.220 --> 02:57:05.060
I just don't like that style.

02:57:05.060 --> 02:57:06.540
I don't like that time period.

02:57:06.540 --> 02:57:07.540
Right.

02:57:07.540 --> 02:57:08.540
Yeah.

02:57:08.540 --> 02:57:09.540
It made me want to puke.

02:57:09.540 --> 02:57:15.260
But I got the game anyway, just because I love when a game is being innovative.

02:57:15.260 --> 02:57:19.300
I also like the developer of the game, so I said, let me try it.

02:57:19.300 --> 02:57:20.300
I turned out liking it.

02:57:20.500 --> 02:57:21.940
I like the art style.

02:57:21.940 --> 02:57:24.260
I like pretty much everything about it.

02:57:24.260 --> 02:57:30.340
I like the fact that you move around the board in a third-person view.

02:57:30.340 --> 02:57:36.460
You can't zoom out and look at what's around you, which I think really helps to make the

02:57:36.460 --> 02:57:39.780
game feel suspenseful.

02:57:39.780 --> 02:57:41.420
You don't know where the aliens are, really.

02:57:41.420 --> 02:57:48.700
You got to sneak around corners and look around, and I find that fun.

02:57:48.700 --> 02:57:52.140
So it's the fun factor more than anything else for you, even though the story you're

02:57:52.140 --> 02:57:54.340
kind of a little bit on.

02:57:54.340 --> 02:57:56.820
That's interesting you say that, because I thought the battle system was one of the things

02:57:56.820 --> 02:57:58.940
that people were really resonant on.

02:57:58.940 --> 02:57:59.940
Yeah.

02:57:59.940 --> 02:58:02.060
Well, I like the battle system.

02:58:02.060 --> 02:58:06.140
I think I know why people don't like the battle system, and that's just because it's a new

02:58:06.140 --> 02:58:08.380
system and it just takes getting used to.

02:58:08.380 --> 02:58:12.940
But once you find your groove, once you really get into it, you can do a lot of cool stuff

02:58:12.940 --> 02:58:14.180
with the battle system.

02:58:14.180 --> 02:58:18.740
I think you can do stuff that the game doesn't even intend for you to do.

02:58:18.740 --> 02:58:20.420
Real quickly, I was playing one game.

02:58:20.420 --> 02:58:22.420
Right now, I'm not that far in the game.

02:58:22.420 --> 02:58:24.460
I'm still at the part where I'm only using two characters.

02:58:24.460 --> 02:58:29.900
I'm using John Henry and whoever the heck the main character is.

02:58:29.900 --> 02:58:35.600
There was a part where John Henry, he has this grenade launcher gun, and my other teammate,

02:58:35.600 --> 02:58:36.600
he was in trouble.

02:58:36.600 --> 02:58:37.600
There was an alien next to him.

02:58:37.600 --> 02:58:43.020
I didn't have any steam to move, and pretty much if I stayed there, he was going to die.

02:58:43.020 --> 02:58:48.860
I didn't intend for this to happen, but I tried to shoot the alien with my grenade launcher,

02:58:48.860 --> 02:58:52.940
and I hit the guy and he went flying, which put him in another position away from the

02:58:52.940 --> 02:58:55.960
alien, which was a complete accident.

02:58:55.960 --> 02:58:59.280
It wasn't something intended to happen in the game.

02:58:59.280 --> 02:59:02.620
You know, I gotta say, I'm curious about this game.

02:59:02.620 --> 02:59:05.300
I want to check it out, but I'm just like, ah, there's so much going on.

02:59:05.300 --> 02:59:07.780
Maybe I'll wait for a sale, if there ever will be one.

02:59:07.780 --> 02:59:09.700
Nintendo doesn't do sales very often.

02:59:09.700 --> 02:59:10.700
We'll see though.

02:59:10.860 --> 02:59:14.820
With a game like that, I think you want to get it as soon as possible, because it may

02:59:14.820 --> 02:59:16.820
not be around too long.

02:59:16.820 --> 02:59:21.860
It'll still be on the eShop store, but you actually want a physical copy of this game,

02:59:21.860 --> 02:59:27.620
because you want to be out there saying, hey, I own a copy of this game when it disappears.

02:59:27.620 --> 02:59:33.060
I'm pretty sure it's not going to do that well, just based off of what you've been using.

02:59:33.060 --> 02:59:36.420
Kaijuto, I will give you this, if nothing else.

02:59:36.420 --> 02:59:39.300
You were absolutely right on Fantasy Life.

02:59:39.300 --> 02:59:44.980
I am leaning towards, trust this man, because you were right last time.

02:59:44.980 --> 02:59:48.060
Actually, Kaijuto, you're two for two.

02:59:48.060 --> 02:59:53.060
I didn't even talk about this at all, but with all the traveling I was doing this week,

02:59:53.060 --> 02:59:55.740
I was in need for a mobile phone game, right?

02:59:55.740 --> 02:59:58.260
I've been playing the crap out of King of Thieves.

02:59:58.260 --> 02:59:59.260
You were right on that.

02:59:59.260 --> 03:00:01.180
That game is fun.

03:00:01.180 --> 03:00:04.740
I even finally got first place in the wooden cup or whatever it is, so I could get into

03:00:04.740 --> 03:00:09.380
the next cup, and I get really pissed off when people raid my dungeons, and yeah, you

03:00:09.380 --> 03:00:10.380
were right.

03:00:10.380 --> 03:00:12.620
You know what, Kaijuto?

03:00:12.620 --> 03:00:14.460
You have a good batting record right now, so maybe.

03:00:14.460 --> 03:00:19.020
Yeah, but both of those games, I'm going to hang up in two seconds.

03:00:19.020 --> 03:00:24.380
Both of those games, Codename Steam and King of Thieves, they have a great game mechanic

03:00:24.380 --> 03:00:30.700
that I hope, even if the games don't last, I hope that type of game mechanic can last

03:00:30.700 --> 03:00:31.700
through other games.

03:00:31.700 --> 03:00:35.060
I know there's a ton of games that are like King of Thieves, that will compare it to Clash

03:00:35.060 --> 03:00:40.820
of Clans and other stuff, but I would love to see something like King of Thieves, a hacking

03:00:40.820 --> 03:00:45.020
game where instead of you breaking into people's dungeons, you're hacking people's systems,

03:00:45.020 --> 03:00:47.260
and you get in there and stuff.

03:00:47.260 --> 03:00:51.860
Whenever I do a run, I feel like I'm doing a hack run when I'm playing that game.

03:00:51.860 --> 03:00:57.060
I always try to size up the level like, okay, can I do this, or am I just asking for disaster?

03:00:57.060 --> 03:01:00.660
I'm always blown away by what people had to, because you have to beat the level yourself

03:01:00.660 --> 03:01:03.380
or you can't have it as your fortress, so anyway.

03:01:03.380 --> 03:01:05.980
OLR has a Facebook, right?

03:01:05.980 --> 03:01:06.980
It sure does.

03:01:06.980 --> 03:01:09.980
Yeah, did you connect your game to the OLR?

03:01:09.980 --> 03:01:13.060
Because if you did, you can always send me out to steal your stuff back.

03:01:13.060 --> 03:01:14.060
It's on my-

03:01:14.060 --> 03:01:15.260
I can connect you on Facebook.

03:01:15.260 --> 03:01:18.260
It's on my personal Facebook, because OLR is a group Facebook.

03:01:18.260 --> 03:01:19.260
You can switch it out, though.

03:01:19.260 --> 03:01:20.660
You can actually use multiple Facebooks.

03:01:20.660 --> 03:01:21.660
Oh, okay.

03:01:21.660 --> 03:01:22.660
I'll check that out.

03:01:22.660 --> 03:01:23.660
All right, my friend.

03:01:23.660 --> 03:01:24.660
All right, thank you.

03:01:24.660 --> 03:01:26.540
All right, Melinda, let you go, but thanks for the recommendation.

03:01:26.540 --> 03:01:27.540
Take care.

03:01:27.540 --> 03:01:32.220
All right, Kaijuto, who I must admit has a very good batting record when it comes to

03:01:32.220 --> 03:01:34.580
games, with that recommendation there.

03:01:34.580 --> 03:01:36.500
We'll try to squeeze in one more quick call.

03:01:36.500 --> 03:01:37.500
I know we're going very late.

03:01:37.500 --> 03:01:38.500
You okay, Loki?

03:01:38.500 --> 03:01:39.500
Still, or-

03:01:39.500 --> 03:01:40.500
Yeah, I fixed my problem.

03:01:40.500 --> 03:01:44.300
Oh, you've been fixing your game, the coding issues that you were having.

03:01:44.300 --> 03:01:47.140
Yeah, it wasn't a coding issue, it was I had a wrong tag on something.

03:01:47.140 --> 03:01:48.140
Bug, excuse me.

03:01:48.140 --> 03:01:49.140
Bug.

03:01:49.140 --> 03:01:51.100
Yes, but I got it fixed, so now I can't jump infinitely.

03:01:51.100 --> 03:01:54.980
Although I will add that for Josh's free play mode, because he thought it was hilarious

03:01:54.980 --> 03:01:55.980
today, so.

03:01:56.420 --> 03:01:57.940
Oh, have you been having the kid testing the game?

03:01:57.940 --> 03:01:59.340
Oh yeah, I played it for 20 minutes today.

03:01:59.340 --> 03:02:01.340
I get a lot of good feedback from that.

03:02:01.340 --> 03:02:02.340
All right, awesome.

03:02:02.340 --> 03:02:06.020
If I don't hear him get super frustrated and whine about it, then I know that I'm doing

03:02:06.020 --> 03:02:07.020
something right.

03:02:07.020 --> 03:02:17.140
All right, well, 1877 game OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, and I just

03:02:17.140 --> 03:02:20.700
want to say again, real quick, just recapping some housekeeping tonight, I want to say a

03:02:20.700 --> 03:02:28.060
big welcome to The Geek Card, and Razorbug, Rob Face, and Sil, going to be joining the

03:02:28.060 --> 03:02:31.140
network with their show, Thursdays on the network.

03:02:31.140 --> 03:02:34.980
And for those of you listening live, you'll get to hear the first episode after OLR tonight,

03:02:34.980 --> 03:02:39.380
which I know is very late for some of you, but I also know some of you never go to bed.

03:02:39.380 --> 03:02:42.340
All right, phone is ringing, so let's try to get one more call in here tonight.

03:02:42.340 --> 03:02:43.820
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

03:02:43.820 --> 03:02:45.180
Hey, hey, it's Rama.

03:02:45.180 --> 03:02:47.060
Hey Rama, buddy, how you doing?

03:02:47.060 --> 03:02:49.180
I'm doing good, man.

03:02:49.180 --> 03:02:54.740
It's so weird when I'm not here for a week, I strangely miss you people, but at least

03:02:54.740 --> 03:03:00.380
I had like SSJ100 Matt was out there, and he hit stun, and some of the people that I

03:03:00.380 --> 03:03:04.100
remember back in the day, we were at all games and all that, so it was good to at least see

03:03:04.100 --> 03:03:05.100
some familiar faces.

03:03:05.100 --> 03:03:09.380
Well, we're going to have to round the crew up, we're going to have to do MAGFest 2015,

03:03:09.380 --> 03:03:11.900
we're going to have to get the suite and do it up.

03:03:11.900 --> 03:03:12.900
2016, my friend, but yes.

03:03:12.900 --> 03:03:13.900
That's what I said, 2016.

03:03:13.900 --> 03:03:14.900
Oh, I thought you said 15, my bad.

03:03:14.900 --> 03:03:15.900
Oh, no, no, 2016.

03:03:15.900 --> 03:03:16.900
It's getting late.

03:03:16.900 --> 03:03:25.980
Yeah, no, again, I don't want to say 100% yes, I am coming, because again, money is

03:03:25.980 --> 03:03:30.260
always a thing, and there's things going on in my personal life where I just have to make

03:03:30.260 --> 03:03:32.180
sure everything will be fine.

03:03:32.180 --> 03:03:35.500
I don't want to get too far into that, because I don't like talking about the day life during

03:03:35.500 --> 03:03:39.260
my night life, but as long as everything is cool there, then yeah, I definitely want to

03:03:39.260 --> 03:03:40.260
do MAGFest again.

03:03:40.260 --> 03:03:44.860
Let me put it this way, if I go to any East Coast show at all next year, it'll be MAGFest.

03:03:44.860 --> 03:03:47.980
Oh, yeah, we're going to have a grand old time.

03:03:47.980 --> 03:03:48.980
Yeah.

03:03:48.980 --> 03:03:55.100
All right, now, I was with you about the whole thing with PAX and the press thing.

03:03:55.100 --> 03:04:00.260
Now, before I get into that, I just want to know, why are you hating on bad dudes?

03:04:00.260 --> 03:04:01.260
Come on, man.

03:04:01.260 --> 03:04:02.260
Why?

03:04:02.260 --> 03:04:03.260
Why?

03:04:03.260 --> 03:04:07.260
I just think it's one of those rose-colored glasses games, but to be fair, I don't think

03:04:07.260 --> 03:04:10.460
Loki let me finish my thought, he sometimes cuts me off.

03:04:10.460 --> 03:04:14.660
On the NES, it wasn't very good, but I always thought the arcade version was fun, and I

03:04:14.660 --> 03:04:18.300
did lose a lot of quarters on the arcade version, so to be fair.

03:04:18.300 --> 03:04:23.700
Because I remember back in the day, there were advertisers for bad dudes in EGM and

03:04:23.700 --> 03:04:27.820
other magazines, and what they would do was, they would just take cheap shots at Double

03:04:27.820 --> 03:04:28.820
Dragon.

03:04:28.820 --> 03:04:32.000
They would just basically say that with bad dudes, no matter what version you bought,

03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:37.060
it was practically the same to the arcade, whereas Double Dragon, not so much.

03:04:37.060 --> 03:04:39.780
And I was like, that's low, but you know what?

03:04:39.780 --> 03:04:43.580
I think that's the thing people loved about bad dudes, it wasn't even the game, it was

03:04:43.580 --> 03:04:45.100
everything else around the game.

03:04:45.100 --> 03:04:46.100
You know what I mean?

03:04:46.100 --> 03:04:47.100
Yeah.

03:04:47.100 --> 03:04:48.100
But anyway.

03:04:48.100 --> 03:04:49.100
Mm-hmm.

03:04:49.100 --> 03:04:50.100
So you were gonna ask me something about PAX?

03:04:50.100 --> 03:04:53.060
Not actually about PAX, but I agree with you, what you said at the top of the show about

03:04:53.060 --> 03:05:01.340
covering the big shows and trying to get media coverage, because on the end of covering anime

03:05:01.340 --> 03:05:06.820
conventions and so forth, a lot of these constant, we're just going in, taking pictures, and

03:05:06.820 --> 03:05:07.860
that's it.

03:05:07.860 --> 03:05:11.620
We go in, we take pictures, reviews, interviews, the whole nine yards.

03:05:11.660 --> 03:05:19.340
I could pull up my applications for New York Comic-Con, say people that run PAX, duplicate

03:05:19.340 --> 03:05:20.340
everything.

03:05:20.340 --> 03:05:27.060
There is even a section that says, please give a vial of your blood, and I submit it.

03:05:27.060 --> 03:05:30.080
I went with a crew out of the three of us.

03:05:30.080 --> 03:05:36.020
I was the only one that got pressed, and we all sent in practically identical things.

03:05:36.060 --> 03:05:42.140
Meanwhile, I find out later that somebody that I knew whose ratings and all that were

03:05:42.140 --> 03:05:48.140
lower than mine, but he got in because he BS'd his way in because of the number of hits

03:05:48.140 --> 03:05:49.140
and likes on his Facebook.

03:05:49.140 --> 03:05:50.660
I'm just like, you know what?

03:05:50.660 --> 03:05:51.660
Table flip.

03:05:51.660 --> 03:05:55.540
Here's the thing, and I wanna be very clear on this, and I know you understand this, but

03:05:55.540 --> 03:05:59.900
before, because in my head, I'm fearing the tweets and the emails I'm gonna get where

03:05:59.900 --> 03:06:04.700
Rob was just a big baby and threw a fit, and if he wants to get in his media, then maybe

03:06:04.700 --> 03:06:07.660
he should do more or whatever, blah, blah, blah, blah.

03:06:07.660 --> 03:06:11.220
My issue is not the fact that I didn't get in his media.

03:06:11.220 --> 03:06:12.800
That is not my problem.

03:06:12.800 --> 03:06:18.060
My issue is the fact that I did not see those rules enforced consistently.

03:06:18.060 --> 03:06:24.140
I did not know what those rules even really were, and the fact that I couldn't seem to

03:06:24.140 --> 03:06:28.780
talk to anybody about it, and I found the fact that when I'm not getting any responses

03:06:28.780 --> 03:06:32.900
and Bobby's not getting any responses and the other people are, I just kind of find

03:06:32.900 --> 03:06:38.420
that rude, and that's, it's the lack of consistency that's really ticking me off, and the fact

03:06:38.420 --> 03:06:43.180
that we're kind of taking a dump on podcasts when everybody's about YouTube and Twitch

03:06:43.180 --> 03:06:44.180
TV.

03:06:44.180 --> 03:06:45.180
Well, guess what?

03:06:45.180 --> 03:06:50.180
I know of quite a few people that like to listen to podcasts, not just OLR, but podcasts

03:06:50.180 --> 03:06:56.560
during their workday while they do data entry or something that doesn't require them to

03:06:56.560 --> 03:06:57.560
be listening.

03:06:57.560 --> 03:07:00.020
They just need their ears and their fingers or whatever.

03:07:00.020 --> 03:07:02.820
There's still a driving, hello?

03:07:02.820 --> 03:07:07.060
There's still a huge market for all of that with podcasts, and even though I can't show

03:07:07.060 --> 03:07:13.060
game footage, I can talk to people about the hobby they love, and that's what I want to

03:07:13.060 --> 03:07:19.180
do more, and that's what I like to do with the press access is network, network, network,

03:07:19.180 --> 03:07:20.960
and try to get more people on the show.

03:07:20.960 --> 03:07:24.260
Try to ask the questions people really want to know the answers to and not just regurgitate

03:07:24.260 --> 03:07:29.940
the press releases and share those stories and a lot of the positive that happens in

03:07:29.940 --> 03:07:35.580
games because there's so much fucking negativity, and sometimes we need to ask the negative

03:07:35.580 --> 03:07:39.100
questions, like, you know, as we did earlier with EA and Maxis and that whole thing, but

03:07:39.100 --> 03:07:40.100
there's a lot of positive.

03:07:40.100 --> 03:07:41.100
Don't get me started on that.

03:07:41.100 --> 03:07:44.420
Anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to go on a rant, but you got me wrapped up.

03:07:44.420 --> 03:07:49.140
No, it's okay, because not the fact that it's your show, but I agree with you 100%, like,

03:07:49.140 --> 03:07:53.860
I have one person already, he writes my reviews, and, you know, we got people who like to read

03:07:53.860 --> 03:07:59.860
the reviews, but when you sit down in that chair with your friends that covered the convention

03:07:59.980 --> 03:08:04.380
and you just go, you start talking about it, it gets much more entertaining.

03:08:04.380 --> 03:08:11.220
If you ask me personally, reviewing a trade show, convention or whatever, on an audio

03:08:11.220 --> 03:08:17.940
video platform, it gets more people, more people get it, they feel your enthusiasm,

03:08:17.940 --> 03:08:19.580
they feel how you feel.

03:08:19.580 --> 03:08:26.700
I tell people when I go to shows, these conventions, that I do my absolute best with my crew to

03:08:26.700 --> 03:08:28.900
get as much coverage as we can.

03:08:28.940 --> 03:08:33.980
So when we sit down and give you this coverage, we want you to live vicariously through us.

03:08:33.980 --> 03:08:37.580
We want you to feel that, you know what, even though I missed it, I was still glad I was

03:08:37.580 --> 03:08:40.540
kind of able to be there through these people.

03:08:40.540 --> 03:08:42.460
That's what it comes down to.

03:08:42.460 --> 03:08:46.700
That's bringing the voice of geeks and the diversity everywhere.

03:08:46.700 --> 03:08:51.980
Anyhow, sorry, I guess we're all getting on a little bit of a rant right now, but I guess

03:08:51.980 --> 03:08:56.020
that was just kind of a personally frustrating thing, especially having come from, dude,

03:08:56.020 --> 03:09:00.260
we broadcast on the show floor in recent memory to that.

03:09:00.260 --> 03:09:03.940
And I think, and that's why, again, I think it's important, and then I promise I'll stop

03:09:03.940 --> 03:09:04.940
talking about it.

03:09:04.940 --> 03:09:06.180
I think it's just important to get out there.

03:09:06.180 --> 03:09:11.020
I think people have the perception that PAX is still that, oh, hey, it's those guys that

03:09:11.020 --> 03:09:16.020
do that funny comic about games and they put this whole thing on themselves and they really

03:09:16.020 --> 03:09:18.900
have these rules where nobody's treated differently and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

03:09:18.900 --> 03:09:22.220
I'm just telling you guys, that fucking changed five years ago.

03:09:22.220 --> 03:09:27.660
And of course, the bigger people aren't talking about it, but I'm here to tell you it changed

03:09:27.660 --> 03:09:29.500
and it is not that show anymore.

03:09:29.500 --> 03:09:30.500
Yeah.

03:09:30.500 --> 03:09:37.780
And like, you know, when, when there are people who are willingly taking personal days to

03:09:37.780 --> 03:09:43.620
sit at their computer, just to fight for a badge, at that point, I'm like, no, what?

03:09:43.620 --> 03:09:44.620
It's not, no.

03:09:44.620 --> 03:09:50.980
I will start doing the smaller and the mid range conventions because they love and appreciate

03:09:50.980 --> 03:09:56.500
everything, you know, because, well, sorry, I just address something real quick in chat

03:09:56.500 --> 03:09:58.180
because I just, I have to address it.

03:09:58.180 --> 03:10:02.380
Zaku is saying that a VOG needs to get their assets to Delaware to incorporate.

03:10:02.380 --> 03:10:05.020
Once you're an LLC, your media penis will grow tenfold.

03:10:05.020 --> 03:10:11.420
Actually, it's not in Delaware, but a VOG actually is an LLC out of Georgia, which we

03:10:11.420 --> 03:10:14.160
picked, you know, cause obviously Bobby's based there.

03:10:14.160 --> 03:10:20.220
So Georgia, you know, and has a lot of, there's a lot of Atlanta game stuff in that area too.

03:10:20.220 --> 03:10:23.940
So yeah, we actually are an LLC and we have a business license.

03:10:23.940 --> 03:10:28.460
We have all that stuff that I don't necessarily need to talk about on the air, but yeah, yeah,

03:10:28.460 --> 03:10:29.460
we're covered.

03:10:29.460 --> 03:10:30.460
We're, we're legit.

03:10:30.460 --> 03:10:34.460
I'd like to, I'd like to think we're legit, but you know, Zaku's right, but one thing

03:10:34.460 --> 03:10:39.380
I discovered with the big conventions, they're like, okay, how many hits do you have?

03:10:39.380 --> 03:10:40.380
What can you do?

03:10:40.380 --> 03:10:41.380
What can you do?

03:10:41.380 --> 03:10:48.460
And we're like, you know, the sad part is it's coming down to quantity over quality.

03:10:48.460 --> 03:10:50.700
And then, well, and then how do they measure those hits?

03:10:50.700 --> 03:10:55.220
They use things like Alexa, seriously, who has that toolbar still installed?

03:10:55.220 --> 03:10:56.340
What, what?

03:10:56.340 --> 03:11:00.460
And especially like my bread and butter is not necessarily web content.

03:11:00.460 --> 03:11:03.800
So I don't believe that I can be measured in the same way, which is why it's extremely

03:11:03.800 --> 03:11:09.520
frustrating when I see other people that know of no tea, no shade, I'm getting more hits

03:11:09.520 --> 03:11:15.280
than as far as the podcast and the, I have third party stats to prove that that aren't

03:11:15.280 --> 03:11:16.280
having the problem.

03:11:16.280 --> 03:11:17.280
It's just, yeah.

03:11:17.280 --> 03:11:18.280
Yeah.

03:11:18.280 --> 03:11:19.280
Anyway.

03:11:19.280 --> 03:11:20.280
Yeah.

03:11:20.280 --> 03:11:21.280
Cause we had a discussion about this on my Facebook a couple of years ago.

03:11:21.280 --> 03:11:22.480
After this, I'm getting out of here.

03:11:22.480 --> 03:11:25.600
One convention said your Alexa rating had to be at a certain number.

03:11:25.600 --> 03:11:31.840
We're, Bunch was having a pow wow on my Facebook saying an anime, manga field, there's like

03:11:31.840 --> 03:11:35.320
maybe five of the big name sites that will do coverage.

03:11:35.320 --> 03:11:38.540
And then it's all of us little independent guys and we're looking together.

03:11:38.540 --> 03:11:43.360
We come to a realization because that one rule, there's only going to be like five press

03:11:43.360 --> 03:11:49.400
sites at this convention compared to maybe 10, 15, 20 doing complete coverage that will

03:11:49.400 --> 03:11:51.560
do a lot more than what others will get.

03:11:51.560 --> 03:11:55.440
I think, and this is important too, is that, you know, I appreciate all the advice you

03:11:55.440 --> 03:11:58.480
guys are giving in chat and so forth, but you have to realize, and part of the announcements

03:11:58.480 --> 03:12:02.760
Bobby and I, you know, made earlier kind of go in line with this is that we kind of made

03:12:02.760 --> 03:12:08.240
peace with the fact that E3 and PAX don't want us because we were able to sit back and

03:12:08.240 --> 03:12:13.480
ask the question, do we really need them or are we able to accomplish more spending

03:12:13.480 --> 03:12:15.060
our money other places?

03:12:15.060 --> 03:12:20.180
And I think we kind of came to the consensus that, you know what, we really need to focus

03:12:20.180 --> 03:12:22.880
on where people don't seem to be focusing on.

03:12:22.880 --> 03:12:26.440
And that is the small to mid-level cons and that, and there's nothing wrong with being

03:12:26.440 --> 03:12:27.440
small to mid-level.

03:12:27.440 --> 03:12:29.280
Again, I think you can have a lot of fun.

03:12:29.280 --> 03:12:33.700
We'll do our one big con a year dragon con because you know, it's, it's local for our

03:12:33.700 --> 03:12:37.400
co-owner and it's like 20 small cons all happening at once.

03:12:37.400 --> 03:12:39.920
And they actually respond to emails.

03:12:39.920 --> 03:12:43.520
And even though their media rule, I'll, I'll say this, I love dragon con.

03:12:43.520 --> 03:12:44.760
We never get in this media.

03:12:44.760 --> 03:12:46.240
We're probably never going to get in this media.

03:12:46.240 --> 03:12:51.320
Their media rules are extremely stringent, but at least they're consistent and at least

03:12:51.320 --> 03:12:53.440
you can contact them to talk about it.

03:12:53.440 --> 03:12:54.440
Exactly.

03:12:54.440 --> 03:12:55.440
Anyway.

03:12:55.440 --> 03:12:56.440
Big sites cover everything else.

03:12:56.440 --> 03:12:58.520
We cover everything else for the people.

03:12:58.520 --> 03:12:59.520
That's all it is.

03:12:59.520 --> 03:13:00.520
That's right.

03:13:00.520 --> 03:13:01.520
That's right.

03:13:01.520 --> 03:13:04.480
I think if we can bring coverage to some things you otherwise might not know about, then I

03:13:04.480 --> 03:13:05.480
think we've done our job.

03:13:05.480 --> 03:13:06.480
Anyway.

03:13:06.480 --> 03:13:07.480
Uh, Ron, Mike, I gotta let you go.

03:13:07.480 --> 03:13:08.480
My friend.

03:13:08.480 --> 03:13:09.480
Take care of everybody.

03:13:09.480 --> 03:13:10.480
Stay fabulous.

03:13:10.480 --> 03:13:11.480
Bye.

03:13:11.480 --> 03:13:12.480
Anime Jam session.

03:13:12.480 --> 03:13:13.480
Everybody's check that out.

03:13:13.480 --> 03:13:14.480
Uh, Tuesday nights here at the voice geeks network.

03:13:14.480 --> 03:13:17.240
I'm so sorry to those of you guys that didn't get through, uh, we actually should have ended

03:13:17.240 --> 03:13:18.240
a while ago.

03:13:18.240 --> 03:13:20.360
Uh, and here we are still going.

03:13:20.360 --> 03:13:26.440
Um, so, uh, we got to wrap up, um, thank you guys for listening.

03:13:26.440 --> 03:13:29.300
If you have an email for us, participate at orange on twitter.com.

03:13:29.300 --> 03:13:34.920
You can also tweet us twitter.com slash O L R. Uh, and uh, you know, we appreciate you

03:13:34.920 --> 03:13:37.600
guys being here every week and supporting the show.

03:13:37.600 --> 03:13:42.440
We, you know, the, the E3 media and the packs me that that would be cool.

03:13:42.440 --> 03:13:46.160
We'd love to do that, but honestly, you guys being here, that's, that's the, that's the

03:13:46.160 --> 03:13:47.160
real reward.

03:13:47.160 --> 03:13:49.080
And all we ask here, we're not asking for your money.

03:13:49.080 --> 03:13:52.200
I'm not going to direct you to some place to go send us money.

03:13:52.200 --> 03:13:57.480
Uh, but we would appreciate any positive feedback that you would have in spreading the word

03:13:57.480 --> 03:13:58.480
about our show.

03:13:58.480 --> 03:14:01.180
Uh, if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange on radio, please tell a friend or two

03:14:01.180 --> 03:14:02.180
about this show.

03:14:02.180 --> 03:14:03.180
Help spread the word.

03:14:03.500 --> 03:14:08.020
If you really can't think of anybody to tell a five star review on iTunes or, um, a five

03:14:08.020 --> 03:14:11.420
star review on a stitcher, those things go a long way.

03:14:11.420 --> 03:14:17.180
Trust me, uh, in helping, um, helping us get out there and grow our family so that we can

03:14:17.180 --> 03:14:23.500
diversify and have even more voices here at, um, the voice of geeks network and orange

03:14:23.500 --> 03:14:24.500
lounge radio.

03:14:24.500 --> 03:14:25.500
Anyway.

03:14:25.500 --> 03:14:27.300
Um, again, dark soccer.

03:14:27.300 --> 03:14:31.520
I doubt she's listening this week and a totally understandably why, but we are all thinking

03:14:31.520 --> 03:14:36.320
about you dark soccer and looking forward to seeing her again next week.

03:14:36.320 --> 03:14:37.320
Um, Loki.

03:14:37.320 --> 03:14:38.320
Sorry.

03:14:38.320 --> 03:14:39.600
It was late tonight.

03:14:39.600 --> 03:14:40.920
Hopefully the misses will understand.

03:14:40.920 --> 03:14:41.920
Whatever.

03:14:41.920 --> 03:14:42.920
It's fine.

03:14:42.920 --> 03:14:43.920
He'll be all right.

03:14:43.920 --> 03:14:44.920
Thanks for the pizza.

03:14:44.920 --> 03:14:45.920
No problem.

03:14:45.920 --> 03:14:46.920
Good times.

03:14:46.920 --> 03:14:47.920
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

03:14:47.920 --> 03:14:48.920
I forgot.

03:14:48.920 --> 03:14:50.560
The final fantasy type zero is also releasing this week.

03:14:50.560 --> 03:14:51.560
Did you not say that?

03:14:51.560 --> 03:14:52.560
I did.

03:14:52.560 --> 03:14:53.560
Yeah, whatever.

03:14:53.560 --> 03:14:54.560
It's no big deal.

03:14:54.560 --> 03:14:55.560
Little behind the scenes.

03:14:55.560 --> 03:14:59.440
Look since, since I'm spilling all this tea tonight, I ran out of the room when he did

03:14:59.440 --> 03:15:03.680
release dates because I was trying to get Irene and they, they were coming over.

03:15:03.680 --> 03:15:05.400
So yeah, I didn't hear that you'd miss that.

03:15:05.400 --> 03:15:07.560
Otherwise I would have corrected you on that.

03:15:07.560 --> 03:15:08.560
I remembered.

03:15:08.560 --> 03:15:10.200
Now I'm like, that just crept out of nowhere though.

03:15:10.200 --> 03:15:11.200
Didn't it?

03:15:11.200 --> 03:15:12.200
It did.

03:15:12.200 --> 03:15:14.520
And uh, I, I do want to pick it up just because of the demo.

03:15:14.520 --> 03:15:18.400
I mean, I guess final fantasy games are cool too, but I don't know anything about type

03:15:18.400 --> 03:15:19.400
zero at all.

03:15:19.400 --> 03:15:22.760
So, um, it looked pretty cool from what I was looking at on the packs monitors.

03:15:22.760 --> 03:15:27.920
Uh, and then again, that's, that game has also been around since, uh, PSP granted it

03:15:27.920 --> 03:15:28.920
was in Japan.

03:15:28.920 --> 03:15:31.480
But I'm looking forward to playing it here for the first time.

03:15:31.480 --> 03:15:34.600
So, uh, and of course that final fantasy 15 demo.

03:15:34.600 --> 03:15:35.600
Yes.

03:15:35.600 --> 03:15:36.600
All right.

03:15:36.600 --> 03:15:39.600
Uh, my final thought tonight is, um, I'm going to say the same thing.

03:15:39.600 --> 03:15:43.040
I'm, I'm very much looking forward to type zero, but I'm going to really try to play

03:15:43.040 --> 03:15:47.480
some more games that aren't Diablo and final fantasy 14 this week, but I'm going to play

03:15:47.480 --> 03:15:49.360
a lot of those too.

03:15:49.360 --> 03:15:50.360
What can I say?

03:15:50.360 --> 03:15:51.760
I love playing video games.

03:15:51.760 --> 03:15:53.800
I know you guys all do too.

03:15:53.800 --> 03:15:56.520
Thank you so much for being here and making it a great show tonight.

03:15:56.520 --> 03:15:58.480
We'll be back in seven days to do it all again.

03:15:58.480 --> 03:15:59.480
Have a good night.

03:15:59.480 --> 03:16:03.320
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.

03:16:03.320 --> 03:16:09.800
