14000	21000	Tonight on the eve of GDC, Valve announces that they too are joining the VR scene with HTC by revealing the Vive headset for release later this year.
21000	27000	We'll tell you more about the week in gaming news along with your comments, feedback, and calls right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	43000	It is Orange Lounge Radio live with our 589th episode for this March the 1st of 2015.
43000	50000	My name is Rob Roberts or Skie on Twitter, S-K-I-E, joining me as always my co-hosts DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
51000	54000	And Tech Master Loki is here as well.
54000	60000	I want to start tonight and kind of address something that I think is on a lot of people's minds this week.
60000	66000	Let's go to a clip. I don't usually do this but I want to play a clip here at the top of the show.
81000	86000	But darkness did cover the world once, in legend.
86000	92000	We know so little about the Keyblade War, only that it was just the beginning.
92000	96000	Amidst that crisis a precious light was found.
96000	101000	It is a curious tale and one worth exploring.
101000	109000	They say ruin brings about creation, so what then would another Keyblade War bring?
110000	117000	When the darkness falls will we be found worthy of the precious light the legend speaks of?
117000	119000	I must have these answers.
122000	129000	The Keyblade needs to be forged and with it the door to the Keyblade War unlocked.
129000	140000	So obviously there that is the great Leonard Nimoy, who as I'm sure all of you know by now passed away on Friday at the age of 83.
140000	154000	You know, obviously Leonard Nimoy didn't contribute as much to video gaming probably as he did in the worlds of movies and the worlds of literature and some other places.
154000	158000	But he definitely had a presence in video gaming.
158000	166000	Not only of course with his role that he had there in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, Kingdom Hearts 3D Dream Drop Distance.
166000	173000	Assumably Kingdom Hearts 3, if those parts have already been recorded or not we don't know.
173000	179000	But also Civilization 4, you might not have known this but he was the narrator in Civilization 4.
179000	181000	He also is a big voice in Star Trek Online.
181000	182000	Oh absolutely.
182000	184000	His is the first you hear in the game.
184000	191000	Absolutely. In fact you have some information on some things going on in Star Trek Online about Mr. Nimoy right?
191000	192000	Later on.
192000	198000	And isn't he like, what's that? Wasn't he part of C-Man?
198000	203000	Of course, how could we forget? Of course he is. He is the narrator in C-Man.
203000	212000	That was actually the first game that he was a part of was C-Man. Doing the narrator and all of that.
212000	215000	So some of those great clips we've played on the show previously.
215000	220000	Well in Star Trek Online they're actually going to be putting a big monument to him in the game.
220000	224000	But lately everyone's been converging at Vulcan to pay their respects.
224000	231000	Since Star Trek Online is basically the old school Star Trek universe without the divergence of the movie.
231000	235000	So it's what continued happening after the movie version split off.
235000	237000	So Vulcan still exists.
237000	241000	So yeah, big thing there. I actually re-upped my account over there.
241000	242000	Oh cool.
242000	245000	But I didn't get a chance to log in because the servers were so crazy busy.
245000	247000	So I actually couldn't get into the game.
247000	252000	It seems like a lot of people maybe want to revisit Star Trek Online because of this news.
252000	260000	And you know I know sometimes it's kind of weird to like really mourn these celebrities who pass away.
260000	264000	Because you know it's not like you knew them in real life.
264000	269000	But I kind of think with Leonard Nimoy, I think to anybody who considers themselves a geek.
269000	274000	Leonard Nimoy probably in some part played a part in that.
274000	278000	Because he had his hands in so much of geek culture.
278000	284000	And he embraced that geek culture despite what everybody said about his first bibliography.
284000	287000	The I am not Spock which was all a misunderstanding anyway.
287000	289000	He didn't you know ever really reject that.
289000	295000	You know just obviously through Star Trek which so so many geeks grew up with in one way or another.
295000	300000	But as well as video games and some of these other awesome things he did.
300000	304000	Dark Soccer you were saying that when you think of Leonard Nimoy you think of something completely different right?
304000	313000	Well I mean I always think of Star Trek but he was Galvatron in the Transformers movie that came out in 80 something 86.
313000	317000	So that was a big thing. I mean that movie also had Orson Welles in it.
317000	321000	So you've got and Robert Stack isn't he dead too?
321000	322000	I think so. I think he did better.
322000	324000	At least three of the actors in that movie.
324000	326000	Oh Robert Stack is awesome.
326000	327000	Yeah yeah.
327000	331000	So he was Ultra Magnus and Orson Welles was in there.
331000	338000	So I mean and I talked a little bit about this on Hoard House this week but I because we had the news that you know he was ill.
338000	348000	And I remember him a lot from these I feel like a lot of my love of space is thanks in part to Leonard Nimoy.
348000	355000	Because I remember I had these videos growing up when I was a kid and they were like some they were like educational short films.
355000	364000	But they were just you know they're really cool and would explain things about the planets and you know what we knew out there in the solar system at the time in the 80s when Pluto was still a planet y'all.
364000	365000	It's a planet again.
365000	366000	Is it a planet again?
366000	367000	I think they're working on it.
367000	369000	It will always be a planet in my heart to be honest.
369000	377000	But you know Leonard Nimoy narrated those videos and I think he was really big on education and that as well.
377000	380000	You saw him in a lot of educational initiatives as well.
380000	383000	Again a way that he played into our childhood.
383000	391000	Well another thing for me too is that he was actually I guess not necessarily a big pivotal reason why I converted to Judaism.
391000	408000	But learning about his Jewish roots definitely inspired me especially learning that the live long and prosper thing that I can only do with one hand is actually from the priestly benediction in an Orthodox temple.
408000	409000	Right.
409000	410000	And he did Yiddish theater.
410000	411000	He was fluent in Yiddish.
411000	413000	I grew up speaking it.
413000	423000	He was in productions of Fiddler on the Roof and it was his Star Trek fame even when he went back to doing theater after.
423000	424000	Yeah.
424000	430000	That actually really pushed the genre of Yiddish theater back into the four.
430000	436000	I'm going to really hope that none of my coworkers are listening because I'm about to out my boss as a closet Trekkie.
436000	439000	Although that's something you should never be ashamed of in my opinion.
439000	449000	But when I got the news that Leonard Nimoy passed away I went to talk to my boss about it because I knew she was big on Star Trek like she used to do a lot of the you know super nerd stuff that I'm doing now.
449000	458000	And she was sharing stories about meeting Leonard Nimoy years ago and seeing him in theater where a particular play where he was playing Van Gogh's brother.
458000	463000	So you know he he was much more versatile than just Spock.
463000	467000	Van Gogh's brother is the only person who bought any of his work.
467000	469000	Yeah.
469000	475000	But not just the fact that he in and of himself had a big love of fantasy.
475000	479000	I mean we're not going to talk about the song of Bilbo Baggins but you know.
479000	484000	But I mean on top of that there you know he contributed so deeply to the arts.
484000	496000	He actually was a big continuous contributor to various artistic foundries as well as to an ongoing Yiddish theater.
496000	498000	A few Yiddish theater societies.
498000	504000	So he's done a lot more for the public arts than people might think.
505000	511000	I'm going to our chat room. Of course we do tape live. I haven't said it yet but we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.
511000	516000	voggenetwork.com. 6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwell show.
516000	519000	And if you are listening live you can of course head over to our chat room.
519000	521000	Live.voggenetwork.com.
521000	530000	And obviously many many people taking a moment to remember some parts of Leonard Nimoy's career and the effect that it had on them.
530000	536000	SSJ100Matt saying saddest part of my week. Fifth Dream I posted some stuff of him as Galvatron the other day.
536000	541000	And the intro to C-Man. Of course a few people in there.
541000	547000	ragenator remembering the whole I'll friend your butt joke which you know might seem tasteless at a time like this.
547000	552000	However I think humor is a great way many of us cope with a lot of different tragedies.
552000	559000	Brad from Pod Culture letting us know Star Trek Online has got one hell of a graphics upgrade since the last time I logged in.
559000	567000	ActDef saying Leonard Nimoy is a legend. Tigerclaw Leonard Nimoy was the voice of Sentinel Prime in Transformers Dark of the Moon.
567000	569000	Oh and Michael Bay was related to him.
569000	575000	SSJ100Matt saying Nimoy was such a monumental figure in the geek nerddom.
575000	583000	He was never a vain or jerk celeb and was cool to the fans. He was a classy guy on and off the screen.
584000	593000	Absolutely. I mean all those things I think contribute to him. I think too because so many celebrities we see out there.
593000	600000	You see the whole like oh they had to go to rehab or they're on their seventh marriage.
600000	606000	Or you know they got caught at some party doing something nasty.
606000	609000	You know like Leonard Nimoy never got really caught up in any of that.
609000	612000	He got caught at that party watching Star Wars.
613000	620000	What's going to happen next? They're going to let the same guy direct Star Trek and Star Wars? What's up with that?
620000	631000	So anyhow I just I want to take a moment here to just acknowledge as I'm sure many of you are thinking of Leonard Nimoy this weekend and maybe the impact he had on your life.
631000	641000	And not only his contributions to movies and television and literature but just you know reminding y'all he did work with games too.
641000	648000	He was a huge part of video games. I consider Civilization 4 to be one of the greatest games in the last decade.
648000	653000	So and he's a big part of that and of course Star Trek Online a hugely popular MMO.
653000	660000	And of course I know many many many of y'all like Kingdom Hearts. You may not have played the games that are not one or two but I mean these side games.
660000	662000	I honestly never knew he was in Kingdom Hearts.
662000	664000	Yeah I think a lot of people did.
664000	666000	I stopped midway through the first one so.
666000	671000	Yeah of course so. But you have memories of Leonard Nimoy too I'm sure somewhere right?
671000	672000	Yeah I watched Star Trek.
672000	675000	Of course. So anyhow.
675000	680000	So we have to change the fortune cookie because Brad asks us to.
680000	682000	We'll get to that at the end of the show.
683000	693000	I will just mention real quick too I think this is an important note. Leonard Nimoy passed away because of complications related to smoking.
693000	698000	He didn't smoke at the end of his life. In fact he'd quit for many many years.
698000	702000	But some of the damage that he'd done over the years kind of came back to get him.
702000	708000	So you know if you are a fan of Leonard Nimoy and you're somebody out there who happens to be a smoker.
708000	713000	I'm somebody who used to smoke. I smoked in the past so I don't want to like talk down to anybody.
713000	721000	Certainly not what I want to do and I kind of understand some of the struggles and I understand you know the stress relief that comes with that and so forth.
721000	727000	But I do want to take this moment to say you know maybe now is the day to make a change.
727000	732000	Maybe today is the day you're going to quit or you're going to try something new to quit.
732000	743000	Or you're going to do something that will extend your own life so that hopefully you don't you know end up with this that you had to learn from watching Leonard Nimoy go through it.
744000	754000	So again I'm not like trying to be like talking down or parental but I just feel like this is something that maybe we could turn a very negative thing into a positive thing.
754000	763000	And if I knew that maybe this little rant would make one person maybe stop then I'd be like totally worth it totally worth it.
763000	766000	So just wanting to put that out there for people.
766000	775000	Anyway let's move on we move on there's a lot actually not as much going on in the gaming world this week as there have been in previous weeks.
775000	782000	But we are on the heels of GDC PAX East coming up this week and there are a few things we want to get into.
782000	789000	So we will move on we carry on with the week in gaming news and we're going to start it off as we always do.
789000	793000	Talking about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we've been playing this week.
793000	795000	Dark Sakura how was your gaming week?
795000	800000	I played a little Star Trek online of course. Well tried to.
800000	805000	I played Final Fantasy 14 so I could show up for the La La Twerk wedding.
805000	808000	That was the dumbest shit I've ever seen in my life.
808000	815000	The eternal bonding ceremony in Final Fantasy it's seriously like the hokiest hoke that ever hoped.
815000	820000	Like oh we're going to have wings and fly into the air and smooch.
820000	828000	Fuck that's just ridiculous. Becky was watching over my shoulder and she was like what the hell is this?
828000	834000	And then she was like that chapel is really over the top.
834000	838000	I'm really upset you did not enjoy my twerking down the aisle too.
838000	848000	Since there's no flower girl or ring bearer built into the game I felt like and the folks that were getting married it was it was a bro wedding last night.
848000	855000	And you know it was just it was the whole theme was over the top. I mean so as if the ceremony itself and the game is not already over the top.
855000	861000	You know we were doing it. I was fine with that part. It was the ceremony. It was stupid.
861000	870000	I was like the hell stupid is this. And so I just want and everyone was like we're running around and speedos like that's great.
870000	874000	But I had I like the people who are running around in the leopard spotted speedos.
874000	880000	And I was just like I'm just gonna be cute and wear the yukata and have my little chocobo chick hanging around.
880000	883000	I wore a yukata to the last wedding I went to in game so.
883000	887000	But I'm still trying to convince someone to be my eternal bond mate just for shits and giggles.
887000	888000	Just to do it.
888000	889000	So that we can afford a house.
889000	890000	There you go.
890000	891000	Because that's the only way you can.
891000	897000	And then I played of course a Dragon Age Inquisition which I'm still kind of slowly going through it.
897000	903000	But Becky and I were because Becky doesn't really like the games but she likes the characters in it because I've introduced her to him.
903000	905000	At least as far as my impression is.
905000	913000	So basically it was just me walking around making inappropriate comments outside of the game about Cullen's butt.
913000	917000	And then there was that picture on Tumblr that looked like the showgirls poster.
917000	921000	Which makes me have to draw Cullen like the showgirls poster now.
921000	922000	Wow.
922000	923000	Wow.
923000	925000	Go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
925000	927000	Speaking of awkward.
927000	929000	Bobby Blackwell's in our chat room.
929000	933000	He was not able to do a show tonight unfortunately because he's recovering from being sick.
933000	934000	But he's able to listen.
934000	936000	And he says Dark Sakura.
936000	939000	That chocobo head at the end was fabulous.
939000	941000	He was also at that wedding last night in game.
941000	946000	And one of the grooms last night wore a chocobo head as the ceremony was ending.
946000	948000	And it's that really cheesy scene.
948000	951000	Well you might have missed it because I think you logged out right before.
951000	956000	But it's when they actually get onto the two person chocobo mount and actually like ride off.
956000	958000	Oh yeah I missed that.
958000	961000	I was hanging out with Becky.
961000	965000	Sure you don't want to ignore IRL for in game stuff no matter what it is.
965000	969000	I'm going to be at another wedding I guess this week in game.
969000	972000	Oh that's right I have to miss that one.
972000	974000	There's two other guild leads.
974000	978000	I might not be able to stay up for the whole thing because I have to be at work early in the stupid morning.
978000	983000	But now I love that because Gold Saucer is in Final Fantasy 14.
983000	986000	It's a great place for after parties for the weddings.
986000	988000	I haven't been to Gold Saucer yet so.
988000	989000	Oh yeah check it out it's great.
989000	994000	I'm actually still working on building up my thing with the cat people.
994000	996000	The violent cat people.
996000	998000	The Amolja.
998000	999000	Oh the Amolja yeah yeah yeah.
999000	1001000	That's where you get what mount do you get from them?
1001000	1004000	You get the little lizard thing from them.
1004000	1008000	I'm working on recognized with them right now so.
1008000	1009000	Nice.
1009000	1013000	I will point out though you only have to be level 15 to go to Gold Saucer.
1013000	1015000	So a lot of people in 14 checking that out.
1015000	1016000	Yeah.
1016000	1019000	Alright so that's it for your gaming week.
1019000	1020000	Then we will go on to Loki.
1020000	1022000	Loki how was your gaming week?
1022000	1025000	My gaming week was pretty much just working on my game.
1025000	1027000	Although I did play.
1027000	1031000	And it's funny because actually I think I played this last week too but I completely forgot about it.
1031000	1036000	So I'm playing a little bit of Saints Row Gata out of Hell.
1036000	1039000	And it's really at this point I'm done with the game.
1039000	1044000	I have 100% as far as like the missions go and all the activities.
1044000	1047000	I'm just doing all this stupid grindy shit.
1047000	1049000	So I was working on some of that.
1049000	1054000	And it just is so boring because it's just grindy stuff to get the last few trophies.
1054000	1056000	But I just don't want to do it anymore.
1056000	1059000	So I play it for a while and I'm like okay this is boring.
1059000	1061000	I shut it off.
1061000	1065000	And it's really like it's sad because I'm only like 12 hours into the game.
1065000	1069000	And I've almost completely beat everything 100%.
1069000	1072000	I mean I have beat everything 100% and now I just have to do that.
1072000	1074000	Like get 500 kills with this weapon.
1074000	1076000	Get 500 kills with this weapon.
1076000	1078000	Get 500 kills with this weapon.
1078000	1080000	It's like that dumb shit.
1080000	1082000	But I don't know.
1082000	1084000	So that's pretty much it.
1084000	1086000	I'm just working on my game.
1086000	1089000	Alright well good luck as you continue that work on your game.
1089000	1094000	For me I got sucked back into Final Fantasy XIV something fierce this week.
1094000	1098000	I won't double talk a lot of the stuff that Dark Soccer already talked about.
1098000	1102000	Since I have done the Gold Saucer I will mention they did a pretty good job with it.
1102000	1106000	If you didn't know Final Fantasy XIV patched in the Gold Saucer this week.
1106000	1111000	It's own version of it but greatly inspired by Final Fantasy VII's Gold Saucer.
1111000	1115000	They have these silly little mini games that are really nothing.
1115000	1117000	They're just little throwaways.
1117000	1121000	But fun little like okay spend a point or like a ticket.
1121000	1123000	It's another form of currency that's in the game.
1123000	1126000	To just do this little press the button when it's right in the center.
1126000	1130000	If you do it right you might get 2 points or 5 points depending on how well you do it.
1130000	1133000	It's kind of cute that they put all these little sub mini games.
1133000	1137000	But then the two big highlights of Manderville Gold Saucer are.
1137000	1139000	Triple Triad is in the game now.
1139000	1141000	Which is pretty cool.
1141000	1143000	They built it.
1143000	1145000	It feels a lot like it does an 8.
1145000	1148000	It looks a little smaller because it's like a window that comes up on the screen.
1148000	1150000	You can play the full out Triple Triad.
1150000	1152000	You get a starter deck.
1152000	1155000	You can challenge NPCs to try to get their cards.
1155000	1159000	Or as you run dungeons and old content especially.
1159000	1161000	And do primal fights.
1161000	1163000	You get cards there as well.
1163000	1165000	The good news is too.
1165000	1167000	You don't lose cards like you did in Final Fantasy VIII.
1167000	1170000	So it makes it a lot easier to build up a deck.
1170000	1171000	So that's really cool.
1171000	1173000	And then Chocobo Racing is in the game.
1173000	1174000	Which looks great.
1174000	1176000	The controls are a little funky.
1176000	1179000	Left and right doesn't really turn left and right.
1179000	1182000	It's more like using a left lane or a right lane.
1182000	1184000	And then like all Accelerate does.
1184000	1187000	Is you want to accelerate up to the point where your Chocobo is starting to get exhausted.
1187000	1188000	And then you want to stop.
1188000	1190000	So you don't waste all your stamina.
1190000	1192000	So I mean there's kind of.
1192000	1194000	It's a little bit clunky in the controls.
1194000	1196000	But it still looks really nice.
1196000	1198000	And it's still kind of fun to check out.
1198000	1200000	So Chocobo Racing is a worthy addition as well.
1200000	1202000	They need to put Chocobo Racing as in the kart racing in the game.
1202000	1203000	Right?
1203000	1205000	That's what I was really hoping for.
1205000	1207000	Because man the Playstation 1 version was so good.
1207000	1209000	But I understand.
1209000	1212000	That's going to take a lot of work in a different way.
1212000	1215000	And maybe something like that is just too difficult to build in the engine.
1215000	1217000	I'm happy with what they did give us.
1217000	1220000	That is disappointing that it would be too difficult to build into the engine.
1220000	1223000	I guess they'll just have to make a standalone game then.
1223000	1224000	I'm fine with that.
1224000	1225000	I'm okay with that logic.
1225000	1226000	That is totally fine with me.
1226000	1227000	Honestly.
1227000	1228000	So.
1228000	1230000	Love that.
1230000	1231000	So there you go.
1231000	1234000	I've also been playing a lot of Diablo 3 this week.
1234000	1236000	As the seasons are continuing.
1236000	1238000	Alan is already up to like Paragon 130 something.
1238000	1239000	I don't know.
1239000	1241000	Like it's a really high level.
1241000	1242000	And I'm working on it too.
1242000	1245000	I'm up to Paragon 80 something on my Monk.
1245000	1248000	I've been just doing some rifts.
1248000	1250000	Trying to get some better gear.
1250000	1254000	Wishing that that Blood Shard lady would give me a set helm already.
1254000	1255000	But yeah.
1255000	1257000	Just making my way on Diablo 3.
1257000	1258000	Other than those two games.
1258000	1260000	Honestly it hasn't been an awful lot.
1260000	1264000	Yesterday I went on a day trip with Flaco Jones and Shane.
1264000	1267000	We went to go see Extover from Hoard House who lives in the Bay Area.
1267000	1268000	So we went on a day trip over there.
1268000	1271000	And I will say we played board games while we were there.
1271000	1273000	We don't talk about board games enough on this program.
1273000	1274000	Which you know.
1274000	1276000	I'm sure there are board game podcasts out there.
1276000	1279000	And there's probably plenty you could say about board games and card games.
1279000	1282000	But you know.
1282000	1286000	I think there's a lot that ties into video games after all.
1286000	1290000	Many great board and card games become a video game at some point.
1290000	1293000	And many great video games also become a board game at some point.
1293000	1296000	In fact, Dark Sakura at a store in Berkeley yesterday.
1296000	1298000	I saw the Mass Effect Risk game.
1298000	1300000	And I thought about it.
1300000	1301000	I kind of want it.
1301000	1302000	It's like 50 bucks isn't it?
1302000	1303000	It's 50 bucks.
1303000	1305000	They changed the board completely.
1305000	1306000	It looks very different.
1306000	1307000	But I still kind of wanted it.
1307000	1308000	But anyway.
1308000	1309000	We played board games.
1309000	1310000	We played The Resistance.
1310000	1315000	Which is kind of the wolf game that you play at Dragon Con.
1315000	1316000	Or I'm sure many conventions.
1316000	1318000	As a card game.
1319000	1320000	It's just a little different.
1320000	1321000	But that's a lot of fun.
1321000	1322000	Because you know.
1322000	1324000	If you play with a group of friends you get all into it.
1324000	1325000	And you know.
1325000	1328000	I of course was the spy in both games.
1328000	1330000	And you know.
1330000	1331000	Somebody figured it out.
1331000	1333000	But luckily the other people wouldn't listen to him.
1333000	1334000	And I won both times.
1334000	1335000	Beam.
1335000	1337000	We also played.
1337000	1338000	What is it called?
1338000	1340000	The DC deck building game.
1340000	1341000	Something like that.
1341000	1342000	It's like a card game.
1342000	1343000	But you're building your deck.
1343000	1346000	And it was all DC heroes and things.
1346000	1347000	Like you know.
1347000	1348000	I would get like.
1348000	1351000	I think Cyborg was the hero that I was playing.
1351000	1354000	And I think Alan was playing as the Flash.
1354000	1355000	And so.
1355000	1356000	Yeah.
1356000	1357000	That was a fun game.
1357000	1358000	I like those games.
1358000	1359000	Where you kind of start with a very small deck.
1359000	1362000	And then you build up more and more cards.
1362000	1364000	To try to get enough points to win.
1364000	1366000	I know Dominion is a huge game like that too.
1366000	1367000	I've played that before.
1367000	1368000	And that was a lot of fun.
1368000	1369000	So.
1369000	1370000	Yeah.
1370000	1371000	William Murderface in our chat room.
1371000	1373000	Over at Live.VogueNetwork.com says.
1373000	1375000	Need some betrayal at House on the Hill in my life.
1375000	1376000	Good stuff.
1376000	1378000	I played that one two weeks ago.
1378000	1381000	With Flaco and his wife and Shane.
1381000	1382000	And that game is a lot of fun.
1382000	1384000	That's one of my favorite board games right now.
1384000	1385000	So.
1385000	1386000	Yeah.
1386000	1387000	That's a great one too.
1387000	1388000	If you haven't played that.
1388000	1389000	So.
1389000	1390000	There you go.
1390000	1391000	I played a lot of board games this week.
1391000	1393000	It's like video games without the video.
1393000	1394000	So.
1394000	1395000	There you go.
1395000	1397000	Let's get into some housekeeping real quick.
1397000	1400000	And then we'll get into what news is going on this week.
1400000	1402000	For housekeeping I will say of course as always.
1402000	1403000	Follow us on Twitter please.
1403000	1405000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
1405000	1406000	We're also on Facebook.
1406000	1409000	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
1409000	1410000	As a reminder guys.
1410000	1412000	We will not be here next week.
1412000	1415000	There is no O-L-R here next week.
1415000	1417000	It will not be live.
1417000	1418000	Nor will it be podcast.
1418000	1419000	There will be nothing.
1419000	1422000	We will be back on March 15th.
1422000	1424000	And the reason for that of course.
1424000	1426000	Is that as I've mentioned on previous shows.
1426000	1428000	I will be going to PAX East.
1428000	1431000	And my flight home is Sunday night.
1431000	1432000	So there's no way.
1432000	1435000	I don't get back into San Francisco until 1130.
1435000	1437000	Which is well after the show is already over.
1437000	1441000	So there will be no show live or on the podcast next week.
1441000	1442000	But I hope you guys all have a great week.
1442000	1445000	I'm sure there will be lots of news and things to discuss.
1445000	1446000	That come out of PAX.
1446000	1448000	Which we'll talk about in two weeks.
1448000	1451000	On episode 590 on March 15th.
1451000	1452000	So there you go.
1452000	1454000	Alright.
1454000	1455000	Let's get into some news.
1455000	1456000	Gaming news.
1456000	1457000	Again.
1457000	1458000	A little bit of a quieter week.
1458000	1460000	But a few things to talk about.
1460000	1461000	Worthy of our time this week.
1461000	1462000	Loki.
1462000	1465000	So they made an announcement regarding Fable Legends.
1465000	1467000	That it's going to be a free to play game.
1467000	1469000	On Xbox One and PC.
1469000	1470000	So that's kind of cool.
1470000	1472000	Because I wouldn't have bought it anyways.
1472000	1476000	But I'm glad to hear that it will be free to play I guess.
1476000	1478000	So maybe I'll check it out.
1478000	1480000	If my PC can run it.
1480000	1482000	Since Windows 10 is supposed to be free.
1482000	1483000	Maybe?
1483000	1484000	Is it supposed to be?
1484000	1485000	Yeah.
1485000	1486000	It's supposed to be free.
1486000	1487000	So I'll have to check it out.
1488000	1491000	I'm wondering though how they're going to do the microtransactions in the game.
1491000	1494000	So that would be kind of interesting.
1497000	1498000	Now the other thing though.
1498000	1502000	Is they're saying that it does require Xbox Live Gold.
1502000	1505000	If you're on Xbox One to play it.
1505000	1507000	Unlike I think.
1507000	1510000	Don't the free to play games on Playstation Network.
1510000	1511000	Don't require that.
1511000	1513000	At least on Playstation 3 I think.
1513000	1514000	I don't know.
1515000	1518000	But I guess we'll have to wait and find out some more information.
1518000	1520000	I think this is coming out later this year.
1520000	1524000	I'm surprised at the free to play news about this.
1524000	1528000	Because it didn't seem like one when we saw it at E3 last year.
1528000	1530000	So this is a bit of a surprise.
1530000	1534000	I know that Molineau doesn't have much to do with this.
1534000	1536000	But I'm kind of glad it's free to play.
1536000	1539000	Well I mean he has really nothing to do with it at this point.
1539000	1540000	I understand it.
1540000	1542000	But a lot of the failed games have been kind of a let down.
1542000	1543000	Especially after 2.
1543000	1545000	Yeah 2 was great and then 3 was eh.
1545000	1548000	And then connect eh.
1548000	1549000	Yeah right.
1549000	1550000	It's none of reels.
1550000	1555000	Well I would like to see perhaps just a Fable 4 at some point.
1555000	1556000	That would be great.
1556000	1560000	You know especially to maybe kind of go back to some of the things that worked with 2.
1560000	1563000	And you know with the Xbox One technology and so forth.
1563000	1567000	Even though Molineau wouldn't be involved at this point likely.
1567000	1570000	I mean I would hope that they can bring enough talent.
1570000	1575000	I'm sure they can bring in talent to you know still make a worthy game of the Fable title.
1575000	1578000	But not to belittle this game.
1578000	1582000	It's kind of weird that it's free to play at this point.
1582000	1585000	But it's also kind of like okay I'll for sure play it now.
1585000	1587000	Yeah it was also kind of a stranger.
1587000	1590000	I mean kind of with that you know the free to play model to it.
1590000	1593000	Is that going to be more of like an MMO now?
1593000	1600000	Or is it going to be more of just like you know it's a free to play kind of single co-op type game.
1600000	1603000	You know that's what I'm kind of interested to find out I guess.
1603000	1607000	Bobby Blackwolf pointing out in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
1607000	1612000	That it's on a case by case basis if free to play games require the plus subscription or not.
1612000	1614000	On both systems.
1614000	1615000	So.
1615000	1619000	Ragenator pointing out too bad Fable 2 isn't available on Steam.
1619000	1623000	Those comments over at live.vognetwork.com.
1623000	1625000	So.
1625000	1627000	2 was good. My wife hated 3.
1627000	1633000	Well I mean but this one is not going to be related to those games at all really except in name right?
1633000	1636000	I mean it's a totally different type of game.
1636000	1639000	So I mean it's kind of a crap shoot in a way.
1639000	1641000	That doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be bad.
1641000	1643000	It's just it's not necessarily going to be good either.
1643000	1644000	It's kind of a.
1644000	1652000	It looked more of like a I don't know just kind of a co-op you know like for almost like 4 on 1 because it was that whole thing again.
1652000	1653000	Yeah.
1653000	1654000	Why is everyone doing the 4 on 1 thing.
1654000	1658000	I mean it's it's what we said that at E3 last year like it was just all the lines coming out.
1658000	1662000	I understand though that like you know Evolve did it and stuff like that.
1662000	1669000	And I don't even know if people are still really interested in that game because it looked interesting and looked like any idea.
1669000	1673000	But I just think with everybody doing that all of a sudden it's just kind of like eh.
1673000	1679000	Well I think what happened with Evolve was the DLC stuff really turned a lot of people off.
1679000	1682000	You know despite whatever they've said about it.
1682000	1685000	Despite how good the standalone package may be.
1685000	1689000	I think the fact that there was so much DLC at the start.
1689000	1692000	And the fact that there is no single player mode in it at all.
1692000	1695000	I think those kind of turned people off.
1695000	1696000	You know what would be good.
1696000	1705000	You know with the 4 on 1 thing is to have like some sort of like Dungeons and Dragons type game where one person that won is the DM and the other people are the people running the game.
1705000	1707000	And that would be pretty cool I think.
1707000	1709000	Was it Neverwinter Nights?
1709000	1710000	Was it Neverwinter Nights?
1710000	1712000	Is it?
1712000	1713000	Sort of.
1713000	1715000	I just call that D&D.
1715000	1717000	I understand that but I'm talking about like a video game.
1717000	1720000	I understand that yes it's fun to imagine and do all the rolling and stuff like that.
1720000	1725000	But like let's just streamline it down and make it a little bit more accessible for people that don't want to.
1725000	1729000	That are going to be too encumbered by trying to learn all the rules and everything.
1729000	1732000	That's what they did with D&D 4th edition which is why it sucks.
1732000	1734000	So maybe they shouldn't.
1734000	1739000	Well keep in mind 4 v 1 is not necessarily new to 2015 either.
1739000	1743000	I mean I think part of the reason a lot of people wanted to get on board with it is.
1743000	1746000	Go back and remember how freaking awesome Pac-Man Versus was.
1747000	1753000	And the Wii U brought a few versions of that to Nintendo Land as well.
1753000	1758000	What the Mario Chase and the Animal Crossing games are kind of like that.
1758000	1760000	I bet you we'll see a new Nintendo Land this year.
1760000	1761000	You really think?
1761000	1762000	I think so.
1762000	1767000	I wouldn't have thought Nintendo Land would be up for a sequel.
1767000	1770000	I would think they would try to make the magic happen again with Wii Sports.
1770000	1771000	One way or another.
1771000	1772000	Maybe.
1773000	1776000	And I'm well aware that there is Wii Sports was released on the Wii U.
1776000	1777000	But some type of.
1777000	1779000	It's not really new.
1779000	1781000	It's just kind of ported Wii Sports.
1781000	1783000	Wii Sports AGG whatever.
1784000	1789000	It's only the biggest video game of all time ported to the Wii U.
1789000	1794000	Yeah it's because they were innovative for a short brief period of time.
1794000	1797000	And they had a pretty decent game to go along with that.
1797000	1800000	They just need to recapture that fire though.
1801000	1804000	Many people in chat chiming in about Neverwinter Nights saying.
1804000	1807000	Bobby Blackwell saying Neverwinter Nights 2 didn't really have that.
1807000	1809000	But Neverwinter Nights 1 had that.
1810000	1811000	Let's see.
1812000	1814000	Bobby also saying he's got a lot of chat comments tonight.
1814000	1818000	Bobby saying I guess when he couldn't do his own show he's got a lot to say in chat.
1818000	1820000	Bobby saying Pac-Man versus on GameCube.
1820000	1822000	Best party game ever.
1822000	1825000	Too bad it kind of took a lot to get that game up and running.
1825000	1832000	But man those GameCube Game Boy Advance games were a real fun party when you had everything to make it happen.
1832000	1835000	Like Zelda Four Swords was so much fun.
1835000	1837000	As was even the Final Fantasy game.
1837000	1841000	Even though it was a little more complex I think to just kind of plug and play at a party.
1841000	1845000	I still think that was a lot of fun if you could get people who were into it to play.
1845000	1846000	So anyway.
1849000	1851000	Yeah so there you go.
1851000	1853000	Gonna be a free to play four versus one game.
1853000	1856000	I'll certainly check it out now that it's gonna be free.
1856000	1858000	I don't even have to ask that question.
1858000	1860000	Do I spend the money? Don't I spend the money?
1860000	1863000	Especially after last week's news where Shadow Realms got cancelled.
1863000	1867000	Well Loki there you go. There's one of those four versus one games that's not happening now.
1867000	1873000	So I guess some are unfortunately falling because there's too many of them out there.
1873000	1875000	So I would have liked to see what they come up with.
1875000	1879000	But I also have a weak spot for BioWare. I'll openly admit that. I do.
1880000	1884000	Anyhow. I also have a weak spot for this series as do a lot of you.
1884000	1889000	Dragon Quest. Good news guys. A Dragon Quest game is coming westward.
1889000	1894000	Sadly it's not Dragon Quest X for the Wii U or something.
1894000	1898000	But this will still be pretty cool nevertheless.
1898000	1903000	Dragon Quest Heroes will be coming to PlayStation 4.
1903000	1904000	Hmm interesting.
1904000	1907000	In North America and Europe later this year.
1907000	1910000	Both via retail and digital download.
1910000	1914000	And of course Square Enix will be selling it on their own online store.
1914000	1918000	The PlayStation 4 will obviously have the high definition graphics.
1918000	1923000	And all the characters that you know. Like the little blue slime.
1923000	1926000	So is this the one that's supposed to be like Dynasty Warriors or something?
1926000	1930000	I have not really played this game myself.
1930000	1932000	But I believe that's kind of how it is.
1932000	1933000	Maybe not.
1933000	1937000	It's not a main quest game. Obviously because it's not a numbered one.
1937000	1939000	It's more of a side game.
1939000	1943000	But I think it's a little more action oriented because of that.
1943000	1945000	Maybe that's not the same one I'm thinking.
1945000	1947000	I thought they had one because they did Hyrule Warriors.
1947000	1950000	And then they were doing one that was like I think Dragon Quest characters.
1950000	1952000	And kind of like a Hyrule Warriors style game.
1952000	1956000	Yeah I think it's more like Hyrule Warriors than it is an actual Dragon Quest game.
1956000	1959000	Akuma JP who I know lives in Japan.
1959000	1962000	And so has definitely already played Dragon Quest Heroes.
1962000	1966000	I'm sure says Dragon Quest Heroes sucks ass.
1966000	1968000	That's unfortunate.
1968000	1970000	That is unfortunate hearing that.
1970000	1972000	Why would you port a crappy game?
1972000	1974000	I mean granted that's just one person's opinion.
1974000	1975000	Other people may feel differently.
1975000	1976000	But still.
1976000	1980000	You know you might be wondering why this and not Dragon Quest X.
1980000	1986000	Dartetsuya saying though well if Dragon Quest Heroes is anything like Hyrule Warriors it might be a fun game.
1986000	1991000	You know Hyrule Warriors starting to show us a real vast amount of depth.
1991000	1992000	But we'll get into that later in the show.
1992000	1995000	I know something else is coming up on Hyrule Warriors later in the show.
1995000	1998000	So there you go.
1998000	2001000	I'll still.
2001000	2003000	It kind of depends how much they're going to charge for this.
2003000	2006000	That's one thing I don't think they said in the release.
2006000	2007000	I'm trying to see if it's in the.
2007000	2008000	Maybe a demo?
2008000	2010000	Yeah a demo would be great.
2010000	2014000	Something to let me know if I'm really going to like it or not before I drop that kind of money on it.
2014000	2015000	Yeah no day or date yet.
2015000	2020000	So we'll see if this maybe is more of a budget title although I kind of doubt it.
2020000	2021000	So.
2021000	2023000	You pay the Square Enix premium.
2023000	2024000	Yeah right.
2024000	2026000	Like we're going to be doing with Type 0.
2026000	2032000	Which is you know buying a PSP game that's been tinkered with and now will be on the Playstation 4.
2032000	2034000	But I do really want to play that game.
2034000	2036000	Not even just for the.
2036000	2040000	Not even for the Final Fantasy 15 demo but I mean obviously that's a big part of it.
2040000	2043000	But with Type 0 I'm just excited.
2043000	2044000	What is that even about?
2044000	2046000	I mean the music is so good.
2046000	2049000	But is Type 0 like tied in with 13 or is it like.
2049000	2052000	Well I think that whole universe kind of got split up.
2052000	2055000	But yeah I think it at one time did.
2055000	2059000	So but I'm still going to check it out.
2059000	2060000	We'll see.
2060000	2061000	All right let's move on.
2061000	2062000	Dark Saga.
2062000	2070000	Well a few big names out there have put out that there is going to be a Final Fantasy Mystic Quest HD remake.
2071000	2074000	But Squeenix is like uh uh.
2074000	2076000	That's crap.
2076000	2082000	Basically the official statements as we are aware of the Final Fantasy Mystic Quest HD remake project.
2082000	2088000	And can confirm that it is not a Square Enix project nor endorsed by Square Enix in any way.
2088000	2097000	Basically it was that a group called Dark Design Games has been going around the base saying oh yeah we're going to be making this game.
2097000	2099000	And you know spreading the word.
2099000	2106000	And they're actually the head of the company Jake Jackson was saying that oh we just crossed our wires.
2106000	2108000	Square Enix Europe has endorsed it.
2108000	2118000	You know so I think that he's trying to pull off some kind of scam or trying to I don't know get a little bit of attention.
2118000	2122000	But Square Enix officially said it's not true.
2122000	2132000	And basically if the game is released it is definitely unlicensed and a violation of their copyright.
2134000	2137000	Why would you want to remake Mystic Quest anyway?
2137000	2139000	Besides the music the music was great.
2139000	2140000	Hell if I know.
2140000	2144000	That aside the game itself was a little weak.
2144000	2147000	It was like Final Fantasy for five year olds.
2147000	2150000	Well and that was the point well it was Final Fantasy for Americans.
2150000	2156000	That was the point really behind it was it was let's let's do an entry level RPG for the big stupid Americans.
2156000	2159000	And it wasn't even really a Final Fantasy game to begin with.
2159000	2160000	No it really wasn't.
2160000	2161000	It didn't even really.
2161000	2162000	Hold on I'm going to figure out which one it was.
2162000	2167000	Maybe some of the spell names and things came from Final Fantasy but that's that's really it.
2167000	2170000	I mean it was so I actually own this.
2170000	2178000	My mom knew I loved Final Fantasy so she and she knew that it also wasn't a game that was filled with gore and blood and stuff like that.
2178000	2182000	So when she saw Final Fantasy Mystic Quest came out she got it for me for like my birthday or something.
2182000	2184000	Yeah actually it was a Final Fantasy game.
2184000	2185000	What?
2185000	2186000	It was a Final Fantasy.
2186000	2193000	Oh no no the Final Fantasy Mystic Quest came out in Japan as Final Fantasy USA Mystic Quest.
2193000	2194000	Yeah.
2194000	2196000	Final Fantasy stupid US edition.
2196000	2197000	Final Fantasy dumb Americans.
2197000	2201000	Yeah this actually was completely not yeah.
2201000	2208000	I believe it was a game developed in Japan for the US which is what made it kind of unique in a way.
2208000	2211000	But again soundtrack was stellar.
2211000	2214000	If you're going to play the game for no other reason the soundtrack is great.
2214000	2218000	It was not Nobui Matsu it was somebody else but it was it's great.
2218000	2222000	Some of the songs are in theater them which is one of the ways to kind of remember it now.
2222000	2230000	So act deft and chat over at live.vognetoverwork.com saying hey hey hey Final Fantasy Mystic Quest is cool don't diss it.
2230000	2241000	I just I guess it had its moments but it was it was so linear like you think Final Fantasy 13 was bad.
2241000	2251000	Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was actually linear you were on the world map was lines that you followed to and you would go to a battlefield.
2251000	2254000	Where you'd have to just do 10 battles back to back and then you'd clear that battlefield.
2254000	2260000	And of course all the hit points were represented visually because here in America we don't know numbers.
2260000	2263000	We only know meters.
2263000	2268000	So there were some silly aspects to the game but again the music fantastic.
2268000	2272000	So Dungeon Buster saying it's Final Fantasy Casual Quest.
2272000	2276000	Act deaf saying I'm a dumb Mexican and I love it.
2276000	2280000	Let's see yeah those are some comments from our chat room.
2280000	2284000	Rama saying Secret of Evermore was so much better than Mystic Quest.
2284000	2285000	I actually.
2285000	2286000	I have that game.
2286000	2287000	I support that.
2287000	2295000	I think Secret of Evermore got so much shit and there's I think it was a way better game than people give it credit for.
2295000	2301000	I understand why because of the fact that we got that and not Second Densetsu 3.
2301000	2309000	So I understand why the frustration is there but like that game didn't deserve to be like a one and done for Square USA you know.
2309000	2313000	Jeremy Soleil that was like the very first game soundtrack he ever did.
2313000	2318000	And now he's gone on to do Elder Scrolls like his big thing right Guild Wars all that big stuff.
2318000	2328000	So you know anyway all those other Square Enix games besides the ones in the main series.
2328000	2330000	Lots of news on those tonight.
2330000	2331000	Let's move on with some more news.
2332000	2338000	So Microsoft is putting on sale the one year subscription for Xbox Live.
2338000	2343000	They're dropping it to $40 a year instead of 60.
2343000	2350000	Although you know everyone's thinking oh they're trying to undercut Sony but it's actually supposed to be temporary discount.
2350000	2358000	But I wonder though if it's going to be a temporary discount like the system discounts were and then they weren't so temporary.
2358000	2360000	So I'm wondering you know they'll do something similar with that.
2360000	2362000	It'd be nice I just don't think they're going to do that.
2362000	2369000	And let's be honest a lot of people weren't paying $60 for gold anyways for a year you could buy for 40 a lot of places.
2369000	2371000	Like during Black Friday sales.
2371000	2375000	Not even just like all the time it's discounted like on Amazon and wherever.
2375000	2378000	What do you think might be the strategical reasons for Microsoft to do that.
2378000	2384000	Is it some type of competition with PlayStation because isn't PlayStation what $50 for a year.
2384000	2385000	Yeah.
2385000	2389000	So now not only are they no longer more expensive but they kind of undercut them in a way right.
2389000	2395000	Yes maybe just trying to see if that brings a boost in you know sales or something.
2395000	2399000	Maybe just subscriptions increases the amount of subscriptions.
2399000	2407000	I worry though and not to be too tinfoil hat or you know angsty gamer type of thing but I just want to throw this out there.
2407000	2414000	And I've talked in the past before about how like double dipping on the Xbox is going to piss me off.
2414000	2418000	Like if I have to pay one fee through Xbox Live to pay the game online.
2418000	2422000	And then I'm gonna have to pay a second fee through the game maker to have to play something online.
2422000	2424000	Like that's like double dipping right.
2424000	2425000	Yeah.
2425000	2431000	And I don't believe correct me if I'm wrong people but I don't believe PlayStation does this with their MMOs like Final Fantasy 14.
2431000	2434000	I do not believe you have to have PlayStation Plus to do Final Fantasy 14.
2434000	2437000	Well according to what Bobby was saying earlier it's on a case by case basis.
2437000	2438000	On a case by case basis right.
2438000	2446000	So and I'm trying to remember what game it was or I was like they better not have a fee to do online because then that's double dipping.
2446000	2451000	Because you're gonna have to pay once for Xbox Live and then you're gonna have to pay another fee through whoever the game maker is.
2451000	2452000	I can't remember at the time what.
2452000	2454000	Is it Elder Scrolls Online?
2454000	2465000	Maybe I don't know but I wonder if the reduction in price for Xbox Live is to make double dipping less offensive.
2465000	2466000	If that makes sense.
2466000	2472000	Then maybe some of that's coming that they'll make that $20 or the publishers will make that $20 in other ways.
2472000	2477000	Again I am admittedly being negative about this but I feel like I have to ask that question.
2477000	2479000	Like what's the real reason behind this?
2479000	2485000	Well the other thing I'm thinking is maybe it's because they're thinking I honestly don't think it's very long term anyways.
2485000	2494000	I think it's just the boost sales right now because it's kind of a I don't know it's a very sparse time of the year.
2494000	2500000	So I'm thinking maybe it's just to help boost sales a little bit just you know an experiment they can try it and see what happens.
2500000	2512000	I don't know if it's gonna be necessarily something that they drop the price because they're thinking hey we're gonna get people on Windows 10 to pay the subscription fee for games as well.
2512000	2522000	Which let me start off there by saying I think that's really stupid to do on PC to pay a subscription to play games online on PC.
2522000	2530000	Oh god hackers will find a way around that in seconds. I hope Microsoft isn't banking on making money with that. Hackers will work around that in seconds.
2530000	2541000	I just you know because that's you know what they're saying I think with Fable the new Fable game is that you have to have gold to play that.
2541000	2543000	Oh then it's not really free to play is it?
2544000	2549000	But then I think that's just on consoles though right now. But I'm just saying right now you know I understand it's on consoles currently.
2549000	2558000	But it could very well move over to all platforms like you play you know for PlayStation Plus or whatever you get it on you know all your PlayStation consoles.
2558000	2564000	But maybe now that they're having Windows 10 as being this whole platform thing that you pay for it on Windows 10.
2564000	2571000	I don't know I think it'd be hard to sell that but I could see them maybe offering other services through that perhaps.
2571000	2581000	Okay that's a more positive way of looking at it is that maybe there's some type of uniform Microsoft subscription or Microsoft gold or something that's going to have synergy with Windows 10.
2581000	2590000	And so buying this would get you not only the gaming but tinfoil hat, Microsoft Word, like Microsoft Office suite of products you could use.
2590000	2593000	I hate that they have a subscription for that too but you know whatever.
2593000	2600000	Well it worked for Adobe so it's where a lot of those companies their software gets pirated all the time.
2600000	2602000	That's kind of where they're going now you know.
2602000	2609000	So that's their way around it is that you know you check in with an authentication server all the time or it doesn't work.
2609000	2611000	Always online apps essentially.
2611000	2613000	Okay so I have to jump in.
2613000	2615000	Okay what is going on in the chat room Dark Soccer?
2615000	2620000	While we've been talking about Microsoft and Xbox you guys in the chat room are going crazy. What is happening?
2620000	2630000	Basically it starts with Act Deft going because it's talking about well it went to talk about like Final Fantasy Mexico edition.
2630000	2634000	And so he says Fantasica Final Busqueda Mystica.
2634000	2638000	So we've now started talking about what enemies and classes would be in the game.
2638000	2644000	So instead of cactuars you have cactuses and I said instead of bards you have El Mariachi.
2644000	2648000	You know and I was actually sort of thinking of you know Antonio Banderas walking around.
2648000	2653000	Wait so since we joked about a Final Fantasy that was made for stereotypical Americans.
2653000	2658000	You guys are designing a Final Fantasy for stereotypical Mexicans.
2658000	2662000	Mexicans yes. So we have luchadors instead of dragoons.
2662000	2665000	They're going to wrestle them into you know pieces.
2665000	2670000	Then we have what else was in there I said to have the Toreador.
2670000	2672000	So that you have bullfights instead of boss fights.
2672000	2674000	Chihuahua instead of carbuncles.
2674000	2676000	Which is Spanish but still.
2676000	2681000	Can the plot of the game be like straight out of a Tene novella?
2681000	2684000	It should be. There needs to be fake crying.
2684000	2685000	There needs to be lots of crying.
2685000	2686000	And slap fighting.
2686000	2688000	Yeah lots of slap fighting.
2688000	2696000	But that would have to take elements from Final Fantasy 7 when you have the slap fight on top of the Shinra building.
2696000	2698000	Just bring that over.
2698000	2702000	Well they were like we need to rom hack something and I'm like just do it in RPG Maker.
2702000	2705000	So I said this should be an official dream game.
2705000	2707000	The gold saucer equivalent in Mexico by the way.
2707000	2708000	It should be.
2710000	2711000	Sabado Higante.
2718000	2719000	There it is.
2719000	2723000	And like you don't you don't rest in a tent.
2723000	2728000	You just have your little villages should be like in a circle and you know.
2728000	2729000	I love it. I love it.
2729000	2733000	Then your old ruins are like you know Aztec and Mayan ruins and whatnot.
2733000	2736000	It's like just stereotypical enough to not quite be offensive.
2736000	2737000	Exactly.
2737000	2738000	Which is very like tongue in cheek.
2738000	2740000	But we should have we should have real.
2740000	2741000	Kind of like um.
2741000	2742000	Um.
2742000	2743000	Oh my God why is the name escaping me.
2743000	2745000	Fucking fantastic Metroid media game.
2745000	2746000	Agi-Dub says salsa saucer.
2749000	2750000	Why is this.
2750000	2751000	Guacamelee.
2751000	2752000	God.
2752000	2753000	There was mentions of that too.
2753000	2754000	Yeah.
2754000	2759000	So now this is actually according to Dark Tetsuya Final Fantasy Mexican Quest is now on the wiki.
2759000	2761000	No you have to use the right name.
2761000	2766000	The name that that uh the active gave it because active is our official.
2766000	2770000	Uh he is our official muse in this liaison.
2770000	2771000	Early.
2771000	2772000	No I'm inspired.
2772000	2773000	He's our muse.
2773000	2774000	OK.
2774000	2776000	So Fantasia Final Busqueta Mystica.
2777000	2778000	Make it so.
2778000	2779000	I love that.
2779000	2780000	Love it.
2780000	2782000	And no we don't want to use the maracas.
2782000	2783000	That would just be too much.
2783000	2784000	Yeah.
2784000	2786000	No now you're getting too stereotypical.
2786000	2787000	Come on people.
2787000	2788000	Come on.
2788000	2789000	All right.
2790000	2792000	The things that go on in our chat room.
2792000	2796000	Now I do like fifth dream your party can only have three members because amigos.
2798000	2799000	That was a good movie.
2799000	2800000	OK.
2800000	2801000	Oh my gosh.
2801000	2802000	All right.
2802000	2808000	Well since Dark Sakura and the chat room had to go there with maracas like from you know
2808000	2812000	somebody amigo that has us thinking a little bit about rhythm games right.
2812000	2817000	And we had some potentially big rhythm game news last week on the show maybe two weeks
2817000	2822000	ago when rumors are really gaining steam that rock band is going to come back this year.
2822000	2825000	Which is supposed to be rumored to be announced this week.
2825000	2829000	Could be yeah it could be something I'm hoping to get my hands on next week if the line isn't
2829000	2830000	horrendous.
2830000	2831000	We'll see.
2831000	2835000	Well the good thing about PAX I will say this the good thing about it is that you know unlike
2835000	2839000	E3 I mean E3 you can't do shit anymore without an appointment.
2839000	2844000	E3 is honestly if you are just kind of going you're going to get to maybe see Nintendo
2844000	2846000	Sony Microsoft has stuff out there.
2846000	2850000	Everybody else you might as well have an appointment or you're really not going to get to see anything.
2850000	2854000	And because it's only those three booths that really have stuff out on the floor the lines
2854000	2858000	are really really long like you all know like the epically long Nintendo lines right.
2858000	2864000	Well because the point of PAX is it's out there for everybody to see and do and the media
2864000	2867000	doesn't really get special treatment at PAX.
2867000	2871000	Hopefully those lines will move a little more briskly than they would perhaps it like an
2871000	2872000	E3 type show.
2872000	2879000	So I will hope that if Rock Band is unveiled at PAX I might be able to get my hands on it
2879000	2882000	as will I'm sure some of our listeners that will be there at the show as well.
2882000	2887000	Now here's the thing though this is where the plot thickens.
2887000	2892000	Harmonix not the only ones thinking about bringing their plastic instrument franchise
2892000	2893000	back from the dead.
2893000	2901000	Yep Activision rumored to be working on a Guitar Hero game for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
2901000	2904000	Now they're talking a more realistic visual style with this.
2904000	2907000	So it won't be so cartoony like the old games were.
2907000	2910000	Maybe because that cartoony stuff got them into trouble.
2910000	2915000	Like remember Gwen Stefani not happy that she could be singing songs by Nirvana and stuff in the game right.
2915000	2917000	Remember some of those lawsuit issues.
2917000	2919000	So they might take a more realistic approach with the game.
2919000	2927000	Maybe that's because Rock sorry Rocksmith does still is doing pretty well and that's more realistic game.
2927000	2929000	I don't know I don't know just throwing ideas out there.
2929000	2933000	But the rumor is an E3 reveal for the game.
2933000	2936000	New guitar peripherals will be introduced for this.
2936000	2944000	But not hearing anything about drums or keyboards so maybe the focus will be on guitar like the old games.
2944000	2946000	Boo I don't want to have to buy new fucking instruments.
2946000	2950000	I have enough instruments I have a garage full of instruments.
2950000	2956000	Activision of course saying that they don't comment on rumor or speculation.
2956000	2960000	But have previously said that it's one of the most beloved entertainment franchises.
2960000	2968000	We would only bring Guitar Hero back if we developed the right innovations to usher the franchise into the new generation of gaming.
2968000	2972000	And I'm going to say the same thing that I said when we talked about Rock Band.
2972000	2977000	And that is we live in a very social world now and I sort of see.
2977000	2983000	I mean the Rock Band and Guitar Hero games that we had before were great.
2983000	2988000	I mean mostly Rock Band but even Guitar Hero as well were great party games.
2988000	2991000	Living room party games invite your friends over and have a blast.
2991000	2998000	We live in an even more connected world now just even five years later than we did five years ago.
2998000	3003000	I mean Twitch TV streaming not really as big of a thing five years ago.
3003000	3006000	I think it was still Justin TV five years ago and it was kind of a fringe thing right?
3006000	3008000	Than it is now.
3008000	3016000	So I think maybe those innovations are going to be very rooted in social things.
3016000	3021000	Like not only can I play online with my friends but we can kind of all see each other.
3021000	3025000	And I think what did I say about Rock Band? We'd make a music video together using all the cameras.
3025000	3030000	You'd make an awesome music video that would get copyright striked as soon as you upload it online.
3033000	3035000	Innovation is the future.
3035000	3036000	Absolutely.
3036000	3038000	So they've rebuilt the cow.
3038000	3042000	They have the technology and now they're going to milk it dry again.
3042000	3047000	Well the Guitar Hero. Here's the thing about Guitar Hero.
3047000	3050000	I don't think it's as bad as people remember it in their memory.
3050000	3052000	Really?
3052000	3055000	Because you know four releases in a year is just not too much.
3055000	3057000	That's the thing.
3057000	3061000	It's not like the core games themselves that were the issue.
3061000	3064000	It was the fact that they bled that series dry.
3064000	3067000	That hurt not only that but Rock Band as well.
3067000	3072000	Which with all due respect to harmonics, even that was happening a little bit.
3072000	3075000	What with the Rock Band Green Day and the Rock Band Beatles.
3075000	3078000	Although if any band deserves their own stand alone game it's the Beatles.
3078000	3082000	I think the Beatles one was treated quite well and they had their own separate thing with that.
3082000	3085000	Well that was George Harrison's son behind the whole thing.
3085000	3087000	That's fair. Sorry.
3087000	3089000	I did not mean to come for Rock Band Beatles.
3089000	3092000	I completely agree with you on Green Day. I just don't see that.
3092000	3098000	And then Guitar Hero was Aerosmith, Van Halen. Didn't they have an ACDC one at one point too?
3098000	3100000	Yeah.
3100000	3102000	All these bands were getting their own games.
3102000	3106000	The thing with ACDC, I think the Rock Band one, that was a Walmart game.
3106000	3108000	It was Walmart exclusive for a while.
3108000	3111000	And then there was the Family Guitar Hero or Band Hero, right?
3111000	3113000	Which was the one that had Taylor Swift and stuff in it, right?
3113000	3115000	And Lego Rock Band was pretty cool.
3115000	3118000	Oh yeah, but I don't know.
3118000	3123000	But see, really those games I only wanted for the songs they were in because they had some pretty sweet songs with that.
3123000	3125000	Yeah.
3125000	3127000	I don't know. I just...
3127000	3131000	But then keep in mind, at the same time, Guitar Hero is getting Milk Dry.
3131000	3134000	DJ Hero, pretty fucking awesome.
3134000	3137000	It was! They only released two games. Why?
3137000	3139000	That's the one I want Activision to bring back.
3139000	3141000	I want that to come back.
3141000	3144000	Let Harmonix do the guitar game. Let Activision do the DJ game.
3145000	3147000	That was amazing. It was such a great game.
3147000	3149000	It was such a cool idea.
3149000	3151000	Like, we're gonna mix these two.
3151000	3154000	It's like a whole original soundtrack with it.
3154000	3156000	I thought that was cool.
3156000	3159000	But no, let's just, you know, we'll bring back Guitar Hero.
3159000	3161000	Fine, you know what? I'm fine with it.
3161000	3164000	You know, we'll see what they do with it.
3164000	3167000	I just hope it's just not like a clone of Rocksmith.
3167000	3169000	I mean...
3169000	3171000	And once again, I don't want to buy new guitars.
3171000	3175000	I have a whole set for my Xbox 360,
3175000	3178000	and I just wish I could use that with other games.
3178000	3181000	Bobby Blackwolf making a good point in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com,
3181000	3183000	saying, here's the thing about the plastic instruments.
3183000	3185000	A lot of people's plastic instruments no longer work,
3185000	3187000	and they no longer make the plastic instruments,
3187000	3189000	so people can't play those games anymore.
3189000	3191000	So new instruments is a given.
3191000	3193000	That's going to happen, Loki.
3193000	3195000	Like it or not, there will be new instruments.
3195000	3199000	The question is, will there be an adapter that ends up happening
3199000	3205000	that will allow those old devices to be playable in place of the new ones?
3205000	3206000	Well, let me put it this way.
3206000	3213000	I have a device to do that already for playing my Xbox 360 controller
3213000	3215000	and my PlayStation 3 and stuff like that.
3215000	3218000	Yeah, but the console manufacturers have to allow this stuff too, right?
3218000	3219000	Because they can lock it out, can't they?
3219000	3221000	It's hacks, whatever.
3221000	3226000	Yeah, but see, the harmonics in Activision can't really be all like,
3226000	3228000	use your old instrument with a hack.
3228000	3232000	I don't think they can really endorse that, so we'll see.
3232000	3233000	We'll see.
3233000	3236000	Anyway, Legend of Zaku in chat wondering,
3236000	3239000	how about Kinect or camera-based instruments?
3239000	3240000	No.
3240000	3242000	For example, air guitar.
3242000	3244000	No.
3244000	3249000	Yeah, I don't want to see it go that route because it's not going to be accurate.
3249000	3250000	Ridiculous.
3250000	3254000	I wouldn't go so far as to call it ridiculous.
3254000	3259000	I think it's one of those things where it works better in your mind
3259000	3260000	than it will in reality.
3260000	3262000	That's the problem with it.
3262000	3266000	I reject his version of reality and replace it with my own.
3268000	3273000	If you want to be rejected as well, join us in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
3273000	3275000	DarkSakura is standing by.
3275000	3277000	Rejection!
3277000	3282000	I seriously hope we get a new DJ Hero game because that would be amazing.
3282000	3285000	I really think that that was an underutilized series.
3285000	3287000	Just harmonics, do guitar,
3287000	3289000	You know what?
3289000	3294000	I'm telling you, I'm fine with Activision going the guitar route,
3294000	3295000	but you know what?
3295000	3298000	I want harmonics to put out a DJ game then.
3298000	3300000	That could be good.
3300000	3303000	They are doing amplitude, which I know is not DJ.
3303000	3304000	That's not the same.
3304000	3306000	I know. Anyway.
3306000	3310000	Obviously, our show's roots is in music games,
3310000	3312000	so we have some very passionate opinions about this.
3312000	3315000	I meant to go play DJ Hero this week.
3315000	3317000	I'll do that this week.
3317000	3320000	Here's my thing at PAX East, guys.
3320000	3322000	I'm going to be there. Bobby's going to be there.
3322000	3326000	We all know Bobby's a drummer, so Bobby's clearly going to be the drummer in the band.
3326000	3328000	What am I going to do? Am I going to sing? I hope I'm not going to sing.
3328000	3330000	I want to play bass or something.
3330000	3332000	I'm going to be the bassist.
3332000	3337000	Who else is going to stand in line with Bobby and I to play the new rock band?
3337000	3338000	That's what I want to know.
3338000	3343000	Maybe SSJ100 Matt. He likes to play guitar. He could be lead guitar, right? We'll see.
3343000	3344000	Anyway.
3344000	3348000	Who's the best singer in the O.L. Army that's going to PAX East? That's what I want to know.
3348000	3349000	We'll see.
3349000	3353000	Bobby Blackwell's saying amplitude is what they'll be showing on the PAX floor.
3353000	3355000	For sure, amplitude will be there.
3355000	3359000	So maybe they'll announce rock band, but it may not be playable.
3359000	3363000	We are making a huge assumption that rock band would be playable if they announced it.
3363000	3365000	And maybe they're going to keep that in their hat till E3.
3365000	3370000	I could still see them having rock band there, but it will be maybe the new DLC.
3370000	3374000	Oh, okay. Yeah. I can see that.
3374000	3382000	Or maybe a demo where every 15, 30 minutes the harmonics PR guys will come out on stage and play a song and that's that.
3382000	3386000	You don't play a song. They play a song and you watch. That type of thing.
3386000	3391000	That's what they did at that one E3 with rock band Beatles. They played it. We watched.
3391000	3397000	But of course there was a big focus on that game and the visuals and how everything was in the Beatles style.
3397000	3401000	Alright. Act F saying I can play keyboard.
3401000	3411000	My last thought on rock band. Please don't ditch the keyboards just because rock band 3 was not as huge of a deal as rock band 2 and so forth.
3411000	3417000	I loved keyboards. Please, please, please don't get rid of keyboards. Please harmonics. Please.
3417000	3419000	I'm going to ugly cry if you get rid of keyboards.
3419000	3423000	I'm going to tell you, I'm going to be there. I have a keyboard too. Haven't really used it. I'm going to be there at PAX East.
3423000	3427000	If you get rid of keyboards, I'm going to ugly cry at your booth. Ugly, ugly cry.
3427000	3431000	Do you want to know something funny? What? We actually still have all of our peripherals and they still work.
3431000	3436000	All of them. They were, they were well built. Do you know what else I have that still works?
3436000	3440000	Huh? My guitar freaks controller. Right? And my drum mania controller.
3440000	3445000	I don't think I have a single dance pad that still works, but yeah, I have those plastic instruments, man. They take a lickin'.
3445000	3449000	Who did I sell my keyboard mania to or did I? Did I sell it to you?
3449000	3455000	No. No. I bought my own years ago. I was going to sell my keyboard mania to somebody. I don't remember.
3455000	3458000	Alright. I think I offered it to you first. I think you did.
3458000	3468000	Alright. Well anyway, Sega has words for Nintendo, which honestly, you know, Sega's fucking up a lot of stuff so I don't know how much Nintendo should listen.
3468000	3478000	But this comes from this former Sega CEO, Tom Kalinske. Basically, he's saying Nintendo should keep doing what they're doing because they're really good at it.
3478000	3485000	The quote says, I don't think Nintendo should give up hardware or consoles. I'm surprised they haven't formed a division to extend the IP.
3485000	3491000	I'd love to play some of their games on my iPhone or iPad. It's really a form of marketing for them in a sense.
3491000	3497000	They wouldn't even need to make that much money off of it. It would keep their brands relevant to the user, including people that are older like me.
3497000	3505000	So it seems to me it's a marketing mistake, but I don't think they should give up what they're doing because they're damn good at it.
3505000	3507000	Hmm.
3507000	3519000	It seems to me that Sega's mistake is going the portable route as far as doing things on phones and whatnot.
3519000	3525000	Because I think they might have even oversaturated the public consciousness with their IP.
3525000	3530000	I don't think it's a mistake, honestly, just because look at the sales that they had in their last console game.
3530000	3538000	I mean, I think if they're making money in mobile and they're not making money in consoles, then they've got to move to mobile.
3538000	3549000	So they need to actually go back and instead of putting all of the effort into shitty games and mediocre mobile games, they could actually recapture what they had and put out good games.
3549000	3550000	Exactly.
3550000	3554000	And not oversaturate it with a new reinvention every five months.
3554000	3559000	Look at what you did right in the past. You don't need to change it. You just need to make more of it. That's it.
3559000	3569000	I mean, no one ever, ever said, damn, I wish Sonic had some more friends. No one said that.
3569000	3576000	Or, hey, you know, I like this fast running part, but I really wish it would just slow down so I could have a nice little brawl with some robots.
3576000	3582000	No one fucking said that ever in the history of time about Sonic the Hedgehog.
3582000	3591000	You know what? I like Knuckles. Sonic Adventure did everything right, I think. That was the last really good Sonic game, was the first Sonic adventure.
3591000	3596000	It gave us different gameplay, but we could always go back and do the Sonic levels. It had the speed.
3596000	3604000	And it was actually something that you were playing instead of just a series of cut scenes or target dashes, you know.
3604000	3612000	And I think that perhaps maybe it should be that Sega should be following Nintendo's example and doing what they know works.
3612000	3617000	Recapturing what they know works using the teams that they knew put out a good product.
3617000	3619000	Make a fighting game with all your franchise characters.
3619000	3620000	What?
3620000	3623000	That's right, make a fighting game with all your franchise characters.
3623000	3624000	They've done that several times.
3624000	3625000	Sega?
3625000	3626000	Yes.
3626000	3628000	Well, I understand that, but it's been a while.
3628000	3630000	We need Fighters Megamix 2.
3630000	3632000	Yes, like Smash Bros.
3632000	3633000	We want to play as the Daytona car.
3633000	3635000	Hell yes, or just get the Daytona car as DLC for Smash Bros.
3635000	3639000	You could also play as the palm tree from the AM2 logo.
3639000	3640000	So random.
3640000	3642000	I know, that was such a great game.
3642000	3646000	But yeah, just go back and do what works, you know.
3646000	3658000	Stop, you know, trying to chase something that's this ephemeral distant item that you can't obtain and go back to your roots.
3658000	3671000	You know, if you look at actually other companies in general, how many companies do you know that branched off, branched off, branched off until they forgot what they were doing, wiped everything out, went back to what they were good at, and are now profitable companies?
3671000	3679000	I mean, I can't name certain names, but I can definitely allude to it here in the studio here.
3679000	3688000	But there are a bunch of companies who have just branched off, forgot what they did well, and had to go back to their roots. Rebuild start from zero.
3688000	3689000	Right.
3689000	3691000	So Sega, learn your lesson.
3691000	3693000	Nintendo's doing fine. You should learn from them.
3693000	3699000	Just please don't disappear altogether, Sega. That'd be a bit much for me to take. That's all I'm saying.
3700000	3710000	Anyhow, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and check out some games coming to a console or a PC near you a little sooner than perhaps whatever Sega's doing next.
3710000	3722000	It's really sad that it's been such a slow year. I mean, I just don't even know. But this week, we really only have one game coming out on Xbox One and Xbox 360, Scream Ride.
3722000	3724000	What even is that?
3724000	3737000	Scream Ride is a rollercoaster game where you build a track as you're kind of going, and I don't know if you're killing people in your ride. It's just some weird puzzle racing game. I know that's strange.
3737000	3740000	Interesting. All right, well, there you go.
3740000	3742000	Hey, but that's all you got this week.
3742000	3746000	Take it or leave it. Maybe something digitally is sweet in the pot. Who knows?
3746000	3750000	There is other digital games, but I'm talking about physical releases. That's it.
3751000	3761000	All right. Anyhow, going over to Japan and checking out the releases there. PlayStation 4 looks pretty thin, too. You do get Evolve this week. The Japanese release of Evolve is this week on March the 5th.
3761000	3769000	On the PlayStation 3, Downtown Nekketsu Koshi Kyouku. What is that? I don't even know what that is.
3769000	3772000	Downtown Nekketsu. It's River City Ransom.
3772000	3781000	Oh, my God, it is. Oh, I didn't recognize it in the name when I see it. But now that I see the artwork, I'm like, holy shit, this looks awesome. What is this? I want it now.
3781000	3782000	Yeah, fuck.
3782000	3785000	This looks like, okay.
3785000	3792000	You see, Downtown Nekketsu, that's the hot blooded story thing.
3792000	3799000	Oh, my God, it even looks like it has stories. This looks like it's some type of fucking sequel to like River City Ransom or something. What is this? I need it now.
3800000	3807000	There's online battle, whatever this is, online battle, single play, free battle, online battle.
3807000	3810000	If Ikuma-san gets this for me, I'll send him something from here.
3810000	3813000	Well, oh, yeah, because PlayStation 3 is region free, isn't it?
3813000	3814000	Yep.
3814000	3816000	Hmm. This might be something we have to check out.
3816000	3819000	I'm actually just sort of kidding, but I'm going to import the fuck out of this.
3820000	3826000	Let's see. Okay, here it is. So they recently announced in Famitsu a remake of this.
3826000	3832000	It was also known as Crash and the Boys Street Challenge, released in 1990 for the NES.
3832000	3837000	It takes these characters and pits them against each other in a sporting event where everything goes, especially cheating.
3837000	3844000	New in this version, highly detailed 3D backgrounds, online multiplayer support, and a single player story mode.
3844000	3845000	Huh.
3846000	3847000	So there you go.
3847000	3848000	Crash and the Boys.
3848000	3851000	I laughed my ass off of that reference in Scott Pilgrim.
3851000	3852000	Yeah, right?
3852000	3853000	Mm-hmm.
3853000	3855000	So that's pretty awesome. I would see-
3855000	3856000	I'm going to buy this right now.
3856000	3861000	Why do I end up doing Japanese releases when you know some of these series right by their Japanese titles?
3861000	3864000	I fully admit I don't know that. So, I don't know.
3864000	3866000	Anyway, getting a price-
3866000	3868000	Damn it. I can't order it yet.
3868000	3875000	Getting a price reduction this week. Ayu Densetsu Sen no Kisuke going into the best series there.
3875000	3884000	Let's see. Moving on. On the Wii U this week, nothing, because Mario Party 10 is not out until next week.
3884000	3893000	On the PlayStation Vita this week, Ayu Densetsu Sen no Kisuke gets its price reduction on the Vita as well.
3893000	3898000	And lastly on the 3DS, Lego City Undercover gets a Japanese release this week.
3898000	3904000	And Doraemon no Bita no Uchu Iyuki comes out this week on the-
3904000	3905000	Doraemon?
3905000	3906000	Yeah.
3906000	3908000	I love Doraemon games. They're so cute.
3908000	3912000	Yeah. Now that one I know. But there's a lot of games in that series.
3912000	3915000	All right. How about the UK, Dar Sakura?
3915000	3920000	In the UK, we have just a few things, really.
3920000	3927000	We've got Ali Ali 2 for PS4 Vita and White Knight for PS4 on the 4th.
3928000	3934000	And then on the 6th, we have Scream Ride for the Microsoft systems.
3934000	3939000	And Zombie Army Trilogy on PS4, X-Bone, and PC.
3940000	3941000	That's it.
3943000	3949000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Country Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase SHOP.
3949000	3954000	All right. Just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week. Loki.
3954000	3959000	Well, I know it's time to get excited, especially when I'm saying that Valve had an announcement.
3959000	3965000	Well, actually, I should say HTC had an announcement because they have a brand new virtual reality headset.
3965000	3971000	This is the kind of culmination of HTC and Steam.
3971000	3979000	Now it's the HTC Vive, which is supposed to be coming out later this year and is going to be another headset for VR.
3979000	3984000	They're saying that it's going to have some pretty awesome displays.
3984000	3987000	We can do video up to 90 frames per second.
3987000	3997000	They're saying that it's got dual 1200 by 1080 displays as opposed to what's currently in the Oculus Rift DK2, which is a single 1080p panel.
3997000	4004000	And they have this really strange video teaser of it, but I don't know.
4004000	4008000	I'm worried though that there's going to be a lot of fragmentation from this.
4008000	4011000	And also, is this going to be like the new Valve console now?
4011000	4016000	Because remember we're going to have those Steam boxes and stuff and that kind of went by the wayside.
4016000	4019000	Is this going to be kind of like the new Steam box thing?
4019000	4023000	I don't know. But they are saying it's going to be out this year.
4023000	4026000	So at the very least we know there will be some VR this year.
4026000	4028000	Some sort of consumer VR piece.
4028000	4031000	And how much does it cost is what I want to know too.
4031000	4040000	Any worry about the pool getting a little crowded with all these different people now getting in?
4040000	4045000	Well, yeah, no. Because there's a lot of different PC manufacturers out there.
4045000	4048000	And there doesn't seem to be any fragmentation there.
4048000	4053000	And like the mobile market though, especially on the Android side, there's a lot of fragmentation.
4053000	4056000	I'm worried though there needs to be some sort of standard.
4056000	4062000	Or hopefully it's easy to port, like say, if I make a game for Oculus, it's easy to port it to this.
4062000	4068000	And port it to Morpheus and HoloLens, however I'm going to do it on there. You know, that type of thing.
4068000	4072000	Well, if they're all rooted in PC, you don't exactly have to port things to your PC.
4072000	4075000	I understand that. But like, you know, just different standards I guess for things.
4075000	4077000	Like specs maybe, like resolutions.
4077000	4081000	Like how the sensors work in it for tracking movement and that kind of thing.
4081000	4085000	Again though, with a PC it's very easy to do different resolutions, right?
4085000	4091000	So hopefully, I mean, I get what you're saying, but it doesn't seem like it would be too challenging.
4091000	4093000	I would hope. I don't know.
4093000	4098000	Be interesting to see. I think they're supposed to be showing this off at GDC this week.
4098000	4101000	Well, if Bobby had done a show tonight, I'm sure he would have been talking about this.
4101000	4106000	But he is in chat saying the Valve HMD will be a higher end product that will cost a lot more.
4106000	4108000	Kind of like Alienware PCs.
4108000	4111000	Tigerclaw asking, what's the refresh rate on this new headset?
4111000	4116000	If it's two screens at 1080p, it has to be able to do 60 hertz on each eye and BlackWolf saying it is 90.
4116000	4118000	So there you go.
4118000	4125000	That sounds pretty cool. I just, you know, I hope it's not incredibly expensive.
4125000	4130000	I think we're getting really, really close to those VR headsets showing up in people's homes pretty regularly.
4130000	4134000	I think that's probably going to be a thing this holiday. You're going to start to see that.
4134000	4137000	I don't know if necessarily like the PlayStation 4's Morpheus will be this holiday.
4137000	4144000	But if not this holiday next, for sure, like we're going to really start to see this take off, I think, next year.
4144000	4152000	I'm excited. This is different. This is kind of the whole, you know, different way to experience things.
4152000	4155000	Like when the Wii first came out, this is the type of innovation.
4155000	4162000	Sadly, Nintendo doesn't seem to have anything like this yet.
4162000	4167000	And I'm worried that they're going to kind of miss the boat on it again.
4167000	4172000	I'm okay with them doing their own path. Maybe they'll think of something else.
4172000	4177000	I mean, you just said they did the Wii. You know, they thought of that. So maybe they'll think of something else.
4177000	4185000	That's like years ago now. I mean, well, let's be innovative. I mean, they tried, but it's just not working.
4185000	4189000	They're like, they're kind of trailing on what's being popular with things.
4189000	4195000	I think they're like, oh, people like tablets. Let's make a tablet control. Oh, people are like really into 3D now.
4195000	4201000	I think from a technical aspect, yeah, because they still very much want to profit on every console they sell.
4201000	4204000	Whereas other companies will take a loss, but they want to profit on every Wii U sold.
4204000	4210000	So the tech specs aren't usually as impressive. But, you know, they believed in the tablet thing.
4210000	4216000	They just, I guess, hope that third parties will be a little more excited about it than they really ended up being in practice.
4216000	4221000	I think that's what kind of, you know, everybody sounded really excited about it in the beginning.
4221000	4229000	But then, like, everybody just ran away. Like, when the system didn't do so well when it came out, everybody just ran away.
4229000	4236000	And now it's been really up to Nintendo to support it. And, you know, instead of maybe necessarily doing these vision games they wanted to make,
4236000	4240000	they had to do the games that they know would sell that they can do well that would sell.
4240000	4245000	Like, a new Mario Kart probably came out a little faster than maybe otherwise would have. And so on and so on.
4245000	4249000	Bobby says Nintendo's failing all the way to the bank.
4249000	4254000	The DS is still doing well for them.
4254000	4259000	I am glad the DS is doing well. I have high hopes for them with Zelda. I just hope it's enough.
4259000	4267000	I mean, I don't know. They're doing okay right now, but there's only so long they can last on first party titles.
4267000	4272000	And, yeah, I understand that the first party titles are good, and people do buy their systems for those titles.
4273000	4281000	But how long is it going to be that people are going to just pay all this money just to buy first party games for this one platform?
4281000	4288000	I mean, I don't know. This is why I'm not buying a system yet, because what else am I going to really play in there except for a couple games?
4288000	4295000	Well, here's a big part of Nintendo's future here as well, because these things won't stop selling.
4295000	4301000	And this week, for a very brief period of time, Gold Mario Amiibo, they showed up.
4301000	4310000	It was a Walmart exclusive thing, and they showed up for order, pre-order, whatever, on Walmart's website, and they were gone in minutes.
4310000	4314000	And what happened? Of course, they're all up on eBay.
4314000	4322000	$65, some are a little more modest, like $20 to $30, some are going up to $100.
4322000	4330000	One pre-order reportedly went for $1500, although that could have been trolls that inflated that amount. Who knows?
4330000	4337000	But the Gold Amiibo's flying, and I have to admit, like, I just...
4337000	4338000	I don't get it.
4338000	4342000	I don't get it. I don't. But you guys all know how I feel about the Amiibo in the first place.
4342000	4348000	And then to take the Mario Amiibo and basically spray-paint it gold, I'm like, what's the big fucking deal? Why are people going so crazy?
4348000	4351000	Does he appear gold in the game when you play as them?
4351000	4353000	Or if it's not, then there's really no reason.
4353000	4359000	Even if he did, who cares? It's not, like, worth $60 from a scalper for that.
4359000	4364000	Just think about it. I don't understand, like, these Amiibos are like, what, $13? Is that what they are?
4364000	4367000	I mean, let's assume that you buy it at retail. Okay, so $13.
4367000	4375000	You're essentially buying a character. It's not even a character DLC. You're buying, like, I don't even know what you're buying for $13.
4375000	4377000	Like, a collectible figure, cool, but...
4377000	4385000	The figures are well-made, and the people that are collecting it for the figures themselves, and even the limited functionality there is, I get it.
4385000	4389000	Like, I don't want to make it sound like, oh, I fucking hate Amiibo and everybody that buys them is stupid or whatever.
4389000	4391000	No, no, no, no, no, no. That's not what I'm saying.
4391000	4403000	The thing I don't get is, because it is so limited, whether that's Port Strike, Nintendo's artificial, whatever the case may be, because it's so limited, it's the hysteria behind it.
4403000	4407000	And the whole, I have to have every single one mentality that I don't get.
4407000	4412000	I don't buy the Port Strike bullshit for a minute, because they've done this shit ever since, like, the Wii came out.
4412000	4417000	Like, oh, we just can't keep up with them, they've demanded so much!
4417000	4422000	Come on, they know how the fuck their products sell at this point.
4422000	4428000	I don't believe for a second that, oh, that Port Strike, they even said it was light enough to where they could ship that shit air.
4429000	4436000	So, I'm sorry. I don't buy that for a second. It's fucking artificial shortages to drive the hysteria up so that it's...
4436000	4443000	How many fucking articles, seriously, and this is why I don't try to report on a lot of this stuff anyways, even though I guess we're talking about it now, but...
4443000	4445000	Well, it was a slower news week.
4445000	4454000	I understand that. But, like, seriously, if you read the game box, how many fucking articles about Amiibos, because people are still looking for them and, like, talking about pre-orders and what's out, where it's out at.
4455000	4458000	Dude, who gives a shit?
4458000	4465000	Okay, I'm gonna tell you why. I'm gonna tell you why. The reason why all those articles are going, because of all the hysteria behind it, it's clickbait.
4465000	4474000	It is essentially clickbait because never do these websites, well, I shouldn't say never, but rarely do these websites say, go here to pre-order the Amiibo.
4474000	4479000	The website instead says, come to our site to learn about where you can get the Amiibo.
4479000	4484000	You have to click through to their site, and then it will show you what is open and taking the orders for Amiibo.
4484000	4489000	It's clickbait, and the reason why it's so popular is because money.
4489000	4496000	Because of the fact that there are people that want to hunt this stuff out and will snatch them up when they first come out so they can resell them.
4496000	4506000	It's that money factor, and these sites that are running the story about who has them in at this second and so forth want those hits from people googling it and so forth.
4506000	4519000	So stupid. I'm sick of hearing about these things. Because there's no, honestly, aside from being able to train them a little bit and smash them, there's really no worthwhile uses for these characters right now.
4519000	4526000	It's a promise that these will be used in the future for something really interesting. I remember the Kinect like that.
4527000	4535000	Okay, SSJ100Matt in our chatroom over at Live.VogueNetwork.com saying, so it's Mario in a blue and white dress. I mean white and gold. I mean blue and black.
4535000	4541000	Shut up. Shut. Up.
4541000	4545000	I had to make a reference at some point tonight. It was a good job. I'm high-fiving you, SSJ100Matt.
4545000	4558000	Okay, BobbyBlackWolfLoki calling you out a little bit here, and I have to get your thoughts on this, saying, quote, Nintendo can't survive this way for long. Quote, Nintendo sucks because there's too much demand.
4558000	4565000	I thought Nintendo was a failing company and nobody cared about what they were selling. Now we're talking about too many people wanting what Nintendo is selling. Make up your mind.
4565000	4582000	No, my mind is made up. They're not selling a lot of them because they're creating artificial shortages. So, I mean, they could be selling a lot more if they would, you know, do this bullshit, and you wouldn't have also that middle market, but it doesn't make for a good story if stuff's readily available.
4582000	4596000	Are you perhaps irritated because since you don't get Amiibo, and Amiibo is so popular right now because they're figures or this eBay hysteria or whatever, that the focus is not on games right now, the focus is on these figures.
4596000	4597000	No, it's gonna be a focus...
4597000	4598000	I was trying to help you out.
4598000	4618000	No, no. Here's what it is. They're just going the same route as Activision is with Skylanders, and what it is is it's extremely profitable for them to create these figures. It costs nothing to make that shit. It costs nothing. Nowhere near $12, and they're making a huge profit from it.
4618000	4632000	So of course they're gonna want that, and they're gonna want to put out as many of those as possible. That's why Skylanders, which is essentially nothing. At one point it was just like a knockoff of the Spyro brand. Now it's spun off into its own thing.
4632000	4639000	I mean, they're making tons of money off that because people are dumb and will buy every single Skylanders figure that comes out and all the variants and all the other shit.
4639000	4654000	They literally had, at one time, there was the Skylander that came with basically every single copy of that game. Whether you bought the starter pack or you bought if you already owned it pack or whatever they call that, it was just a different color.
4654000	4661000	But people bought it. It's literally just a different fucking color than the one you already have.
4662000	4675000	And people bought it because I don't know why. And this is the same reason with these Amiibos. It's a gold Mario. Who gives a shit? No one's gonna be like, oh my god, you have a gold Mario. That's so exclusive to Walmart.
4675000	4689000	No one gives a shit. It's just an Amiibo. It's just a little toy. And now they're gonna have the card ones too. Whatever. You know what? I can't tell you how to spend your money. I just don't get it. I think they really need to have some worthwhile reason for this.
4689000	4699000	It's tricky because actually, Loki, I do agree with you to a point. I really do. To a point. I think you might be a little harsh on it.
4699000	4708000	It's like the new 3DS. They're like, oh, it's got all these features that we're not utilizing yet. Kind of like that. It's like, well, we promise we'll use it in really cool ways later on.
4708000	4713000	But there's a lot of people that never got the 3DS XL, so there's a worthy upgrade there. I get it.
4713000	4715000	That's fine, but they can still get the 3DS XLs now.
4716000	4735000	Back to Amiibo for a minute. I do kind of agree there's a lot of mentality out there of the, I have this and you don't, nah nah nah nah nah. Like, there's just a lot of that in gaming. You see that everywhere. The whole, like, I've got it and you don't, nah nah nah nah. Like, it's the whole, like, gotta catch them all and everything. That definitely plays a factor to it.
4735000	4748000	You think Amiibos are bad now. You have no fucking idea. And you think I'm joking. They will put out a Pokemon Amiibo for every goddamn fucking Pokemon that they have.
4748000	4764000	But, but, but. My mother, bless her heart, her birthday was this week, by the way. Happy birthday, mom. She collects dolls that she sees on QVC. She has a complete collection of Richard Simmons dolls.
4764000	4765000	Oh my god.
4765000	4768000	That sell, yes, she has them in a glass case. Jamie's like, what?
4768000	4770000	I knew I loved your mother for a reason.
4770000	4774000	You have to have them in a glass case so they don't kill you in the middle of the night when they come alive.
4774000	4781000	And she also collects the Marie Osmond dolls, which are like a very similar thing that she also has in her glass case and so forth.
4781000	4788000	So a lot of you are probably sitting here and going, oh my god, Richard Simmons dolls, really? Your mom's a quack and so forth.
4788000	4791000	I'm just imagining these little porcelain dolls of Richard Simmons.
4791000	4799000	You know what? Well, they're, they're old people that look like Richard Simmons. That's the whole, it's fascinating. But anyway, I'm not going to get into that.
4799000	4808000	My point is, why does she buy them? Because she wants to. She wants to have them. She wants that collection. She wants them all in the case.
4808000	4812000	And you know what? I, for one, the woman, did you Google it?
4812000	4814000	Yes, I did.
4814000	4821000	The woman has worked very hard in her life. She raised me, for God's sake. She can have whatever she wants in her glass case.
4821000	4831000	So if collecting all these amiibo, if going to the store at six o'clock in the morning and camping out and getting that amiibo and being right there and cleaning, if that's what you want,
4831000	4840000	I am not one to question you on those choices and building up that collection. I'm just going to say, respectfully, not for me. Thank you.
4840000	4842000	I don't, I don't care that much.
4842000	4843000	In that case.
4843000	4850000	And I wish Nintendo would put the dolls on QVC because my mother never had to wait at six a.m. to get a fucking doll.
4850000	4852000	She could just call QVC and they happily took her money.
4852000	4866000	If that's the case, then you know what? I just hope, I hope to God that like months now, or months from now, when they haven't still found a real reasonable use for those amiibos, aside from unlocking some shit in a game,
4866000	4873000	I really hope that you don't have your buyer's remorse at that time and realize, oh, I spent like $400 on these stupid, you know, figurines.
4873000	4878000	I just hope that's the case because, I don't know, I just, I don't get it.
4878000	4890000	And I, I, if, if they had a really good use to the, you know, for them, if, you know, aside from just training them for whatever, you know, in Smash Brothers, then I could probably get on board with that.
4890000	4893000	But it just doesn't, it doesn't seem like they're used for anything.
4893000	4908000	Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. We have SHA100Matt, our local comedian, with another question saying, here's a question, what is harder to catch these days, amiibos or llamas?
4908000	4912000	Again, with the meme jokes for the week.
4912000	4914000	You know it's easier to catch than amiibos?
4914000	4917000	Measles because of anti-vaxxers.
4917000	4922000	I'm like, can we get something worked in there? Okay, I don't know what this is that, that is not.
4922000	4927000	There's another link that I had above that one because it's actually that doll, that girl doll there.
4927000	4931000	I found a picture of Richard Simmons like posing with her on the cover of like doll fancy or something.
4931000	4935000	No, whatever. Okay, that, that second one is definitely not the doll.
4935000	4941000	Again, Dark Soccer is posting links in our live chat room over at live.vognetwork.com so I apologize. I know it's radio.
4941000	4944000	Okay, this, this is it. This first one that you linked here.
4944000	4950000	Like there's like a nun and like this guy just in a raincoat with pink wings or something was one of them.
4950000	4952000	I'm like, okay, those are actually kind of cute.
4952000	4957000	See, okay, see the, and sorry, I'm describing this best I can for people listening on the podcast.
4957000	4963000	There's like an old man here and he has a little tag and it said Nana's Family in the Mama's Family font, by the way.
4963000	4968000	And it says Richard Simmons. That's how you know it's one of the dolls because it has a little tag on it, a little blue tag that says that.
4968000	4970000	I don't get it though. It doesn't look like Richard Simmons.
4970000	4974000	But there is, well, it's not just inspired by him. It's inspired by people in his family.
4974000	4979000	So they, trust me, they look a little bit like him. They do. They do.
4979000	4984000	This is just a little, like if you were a wrinkly old man and had, you know, billions of dollars of plastic surgery.
4984000	4988000	Sadly, Richard Simmons hasn't been seen in a year. He probably is starting to get that way.
4988000	4989000	Although I hate to think of it.
4989000	4990000	I think that's what surgery's for.
4990000	4995000	Well, now all you need to do is stick one of those, you know, those readers on the bottom of that and there you go.
4995000	4998000	There's your amiibo. It's a Richard Simmons old man amiibo.
4998000	5003000	By the way, my mother loves Richard Simmons with all her heart and therefore so do I.
5003000	5007000	So I'm just going to say, don't you fucking come for Richard Simmons.
5007000	5008000	Hey!
5008000	5012000	I'm going to wreck you. I'm just going to say that loud and clear. The man is a saint.
5012000	5013000	Rob.
5013000	5014000	End of story.
5014000	5018000	I was actually going to ask you if you wanted me to put together a RuPaul for you.
5018000	5019000	A what?
5019000	5021000	I was going to make you your favorite drag queen.
5021000	5028000	If you could, if you sent me pictures, I could totally make you a ball jointed doll that looks like your favorite drag queen.
5028000	5037000	My favorite drag queen. I probably amongst all the seasons, one of my very favorites ever was probably, I don't know, probably right now actually at the moment, Alaska.
5037000	5039000	Alaska was probably my favorite.
5039000	5040000	There was one that I was-
5040000	5043000	After all, my Final Fantasy character is Lil Poundcake, so.
5043000	5066000	There was one though that I was looking at though who is up for like some like board member status for one of the GLBTQA something deal who is a drag queen that goes by, fuck I can't think of the name now, but using his Native American roots for his drag persona.
5066000	5067000	Hmm.
5067000	5070000	And I can't remember, but the gorgeous.
5070000	5071000	Hmm.
5071000	5072000	And that's Dan.
5072000	5075000	And your phone just made a level up noise as you were talking about drag queen.
5075000	5077000	When Dan texts me, it makes level up noise.
5077000	5084000	Yeah, SSJ reminded me in chat, SSJ100Matt said, Richard Simmons retweeted and favorited one of Rob's tweets. He died that day.
5084000	5087000	He actually didn't retweet it, but he did respond to it. And yes, that did make my day.
5087000	5088000	Have you seen the-
5088000	5090000	You know who I called first thing?
5090000	5091000	My mother.
5091000	5092000	Your mom.
5092000	5099000	You know, actually though, have you seen who I've been in a really random tagging really randomly in a Twitter conversation?
5099000	5100000	Hmm.
5100000	5101000	Is Moon Yoon at Zappa.
5101000	5111000	Me and this other guy were like, I retweeted something that she said about having like a social media thing that was all pictures of your pets.
5111000	5112000	Hmm.
5112000	5116000	And then we started talking about making one that was all reaction gifs and you got in on it too.
5116000	5118000	And you tagged her for this.
5118000	5119000	So I don't even remember this.
5119000	5124000	I'm sure that Ms. Zappa is sitting here going, the fuck are these people?
5124000	5131000	All right, look, we got to take a time, we got to take a time back, a step back to the classic game of the week.
5131000	5136000	Back when the Zappas were, you know, all the craze actually. No, not that far back.
5136000	5141000	But we are going to take a step back in gaming's history with a saying that we call the classic game of the week,
5141000	5148000	where DarkStalker is going to step into the vault and she's going to find a game that she thinks, hey, you all should be playing this game this week.
5148000	5153000	And you know what? I think this week DarkStalker has picked a game I think a lot of you have played,
5153000	5160000	but you should probably go back and play it again to remember how awesome the series used to be.
5160000	5161000	So many feelings.
5161000	5163000	Me too. We talked about some of these feelings last week.
5163000	5164000	DarkStalker, what is the classic game of the week?
5164000	5166000	Mortal Kombat 2.
5166000	5167000	Mortal Kombat.
5167000	5168000	Electric Boogaloo?
5168000	5169000	No.
5169000	5174000	Mortal Kombat 2, now mind you, I have done the first Mortal Kombat, you know,
5174000	5180000	but Mortal Kombat 2 has a very special place in the bowels of my bowels.
5180000	5181000	Bow.
5181000	5189000	The cockles of the heart. Maybe the liver. Maybe even the colon.
5189000	5192000	Sorry, I'm just getting some of that tense battle music.
5193000	5197000	Mortal Kombat 2, when it came out, it was a thing.
5197000	5208000	Like, a thing capitalized in bold text with that weird MS Word 3D effect and exclamation points.
5208000	5209000	It was a thing.
5209000	5212000	Which is probably topical for the day anyway.
5212000	5215000	So it came out in 1993.
5215000	5220000	This was actually my senior year of high school.
5220000	5225000	And it was just a big thing.
5225000	5228000	It came out on damn near everything too that was available at the time.
5228000	5231000	But it was the second game in the Mortal Kombat series.
5231000	5235000	It really added a lot more to the mythology of the game.
5235000	5238000	It gave us more fatalities.
5238000	5244000	New characters, which actually had, I was completely addicted to playing as Kitana.
5244000	5253000	We got Kung Lao Molina, who is actually coming up with a very big role in the current Mortal Kombat game.
5253000	5258000	And then it had Shao Kahn in there, who I don't believe was playable to begin with.
5258000	5266000	But now he's like the big bad and you get to play as the previous boss.
5266000	5271000	It's set in Outworld, so it has a lot more going on in it.
5271000	5274000	A lot more crazy mysticism.
5274000	5278000	You know, weird backgrounds.
5278000	5282000	And microphone destruction.
5282000	5290000	This is probably, to me, the best, best, best of the entire series.
5290000	5292000	Just saying.
5292000	5298000	It also had a spinoff game that came out called Mortal Kombat Shao Lin Monks.
5298000	5303000	And it was the biggest influence on the 2011 reboot of Mortal Kombat.
5303000	5307000	It was, all the characters were digitized.
5307000	5315000	They stopped this, I believe, after Mortal Kombat 3, so Mortal Kombat 3 was the last one to digitize the characters.
5315000	5322000	It had, you know, really in-depth, you know, high punch, low punch, high kick, low kick.
5322000	5324000	All kinds of different, neat easter eggs.
5324000	5327000	You had crouching punch, turnaround kicks.
5327000	5329000	All kinds of more stuff that was thrown in it.
5329000	5334000	The whole uppercut, including the toasty that you could get.
5334000	5341000	And basically, the big thing that was taken out of it, which I thought didn't hurt the game at all, was the test your might thing.
5341000	5345000	And the point system from the first game.
5345000	5347000	That was, I was glad to see, gone.
5347000	5348000	Of course, we had the fatalities.
5348000	5351000	Every character, I believe, had at least two.
5351000	5356000	You also had the babalities, where they turned the opponent into the crying baby.
5356000	5359000	Friendships, which were absolutely freaking hilarious.
5359000	5360000	I loved...
5360000	5361000	Friendships were rad.
5361000	5362000	Oh, yeah.
5362000	5364000	Like, uh...
5364000	5365000	Just a little voice.
5365000	5367000	Friendship, friendship.
5367000	5370000	Well, I also feel like Molinas was, what, making a cake.
5370000	5371000	Yeah.
5371000	5374000	And Johnny Cage was his signature.
5374000	5376000	And, uh...
5376000	5378000	Luke Cage's was a disco dance.
5378000	5382000	This video we have here that we're looking at in the studio is a bunch of kulau doing the fighting.
5382000	5384000	And I believe he pulls a bunny out of his hat.
5384000	5385000	Yes.
5385000	5386000	I believe he does.
5386000	5387000	Or either that or it was Raiden.
5387000	5389000	No, Raiden does the rainbow.
5389000	5390000	Yeah.
5390000	5391000	Raiden does the rainbow.
5391000	5393000	Um...
5393000	5394000	You also have, um, of course...
5394000	5396000	Oh my god, he just did it in the video.
5396000	5397000	He did the bunny.
5397000	5398000	He's cute.
5398000	5400000	Yeah.
5400000	5401000	Friendship, friendship.
5401000	5402000	Friendship, friendship.
5402000	5403000	Anyway, sorry.
5403000	5404000	Distracted.
5404000	5406000	Um, anyway, you also had stage-specific fatalities.
5406000	5412000	Like, you had, uh, the pit, you had the acid, you had, uh...
5413000	5416000	You know, you even had the, uh...
5416000	5419000	What was the, the one for, um...
5419000	5421000	What was his name?
5421000	5423000	The guy that would shape-shift.
5423000	5424000	Shang Tsung.
5424000	5425000	Shang Tsung, yeah.
5425000	5427000	Um, you had his Goro Fatality.
5427000	5428000	Where he would shape-shift into Goro.
5428000	5431000	Where you had to hold the, was it the low-kick button?
5431000	5433000	You had to hold it for 40 seconds.
5433000	5438000	So what we would do is we would just have somebody hold that button for us while we were doing it.
5438000	5439000	Nice.
5439000	5440000	So we could see it.
5440000	5447000	Um, there were a bunch of different beta editions of this, too.
5447000	5448000	That was the big thing.
5448000	5449000	Oh yeah, Baraka was in this game, too.
5449000	5450000	Baraka was cool.
5450000	5451000	Um...
5451000	5452000	Baby Baraka.
5452000	5453000	Baby Baraka.
5453000	5456000	Um, but anyway, uh, this, uh...
5456000	5465000	There were so many different, uh, beta versions that were out that you actually found strategy guides being released for the beta editions of these.
5465000	5472000	You know, when the internet was in its infancy as far as a big source of public information, we had...
5472000	5474000	We got this shit off BBSs that were connected.
5474000	5475000	Fuck yeah.
5475000	5477000	Connected BBS message boards.
5477000	5484000	So it's like somebody in fucking, uh, Sunnyvale or, you know, wherever the homes were would post on their BBS.
5484000	5487000	And then like the BBS in Fresno would download from that.
5487000	5490000	And then the BBS here in Sacramento would download from that.
5490000	5493000	It's like that's how we got all our fucking moves lists and things.
5493000	5494000	Crazy.
5494000	5500000	But, like, it's so crazy because, I mean, we actually started following, like, some of these actors.
5500000	5502000	Like, have I seen them in other games?
5502000	5503000	Or are they doing other things?
5503000	5504000	You know?
5504000	5506000	Or do they play three people in the same game?
5506000	5507000	Exactly.
5507000	5510000	Like, uh, palette-swap people.
5510000	5515000	Like, uh, you know, just looking at, uh, you know, uh...
5515000	5520000	Like, the one who played Kitana and Mileena after a while, I think she actually was a...
5520000	5523000	An actual, legit, um, martial artist.
5523000	5525000	She was a Cuban lady.
5525000	5526000	I think a lot of them were.
5526000	5528000	I think a lot of them, uh, big in Chicago were...
5528000	5529000	Yeah.
5529000	5530000	They were based.
5530000	5539000	Um, but basically, uh, the thing about those beta editions is that the fact that whenever they would put out a tweak to the game...
5539000	5544000	And see, a lot of the betas on these were mostly East Coast, which is...
5544000	5549000	That was when I, um, my high school band took a trip up the East Coast to go to New York.
5549000	5551000	And we got to try...
5551000	5556000	We ran into at least two different, um, game betas at the time.
5556000	5562000	Having photocopied BBS printouts of move lists and combo patterns.
5562000	5569000	And it was back in the day of Kitana's Infinite, where you could do the fly and the fan and the thing over and over again.
5569000	5571000	I always used to be so good at that.
5571000	5578000	Um, so yeah, um, in this game we had Baraka, we had Jax, who ended up getting, like, the neck of arms and whatever.
5578000	5587000	Um, Kitana, we had Kung Lao, we had Mileena, and we also then had the returning characters of Johnny Cage, rest in peace.
5587000	5593000	Liu Kang, uh, Raiden, uh, Reptile, Scorpion, Shang Tsung, and Sub-Zero.
5593000	5604000	Um, for the non-playables you had Shao Kahn, and you had, uh, Kentaro, who was actually a stop motion animation while the rest of everybody was ditched.
5605000	5614000	Um, hidden characters in here were, um, you had Jade, who was a, uh, green palette swap of Kitana and Mileena.
5614000	5622000	You had Noob Saibot, who was the lost warrior from the first Mortal Kombat game, who, you know, people kept saying,
5622000	5624000	Oh, he's hidden in the game. Well, they put him in.
5624000	5629000	Um, and then you had Smoke, who was in gray with the smoke effect.
5629000	5637000	Um, you, uh, you could not play as Sonya Arcana, although they did, uh, show up in the background.
5637000	5638000	Was Reptile in two?
5638000	5640000	Reptile was in two, I believe.
5640000	5641000	Yeah.
5641000	5643000	Because Reptile had the acid breath.
5643000	5647000	Yeah. He did that little forest ball that went, ehh, ehh, ehh, and it would make you, like, fly over, yeah.
5647000	5654000	And this was also the game that, and actually, I think if you fought Reptile, you fought him in the pit, or one of the guys you fought in the spike pit.
5654000	5656000	In Mortal Kombat 1, you did. In Mortal Kombat 1, you did.
5656000	5657000	Yeah.
5657000	5659000	Uh, but Reptile was just a character like any other in this game.
5659000	5660000	Yeah.
5660000	5666000	Um, the other thing, too, is, um, this is the game that gave, uh, gave us, uh, Ermac.
5666000	5671000	Because it was in the, uh, I actually got to see it, too.
5671000	5680000	Um, one of the arcade techs at my, um, at the, uh, movie theater I used to go to would, uh, you know, say,
5680000	5683000	Hey, look, this is where they got the Ermac from, and this is this guy, and this is this guy.
5683000	5690000	And he's like, I wonder what this is gonna be. I've tried to, to fiddle around with this, and I haven't found anything in the code, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
5690000	5693000	And it was just really crazy.
5693000	5705000	The whole point, though, is that Ed Boom, who was, uh, the lead programmer, said that the big thing was that they wanted to make it look, uh, different than the original Mortal Kombat.
5705000	5709000	And it has everything in the game that they didn't have time for in the first one.
5710000	5716000	Um, they said they got new equipment, um, and just everything.
5716000	5722000	They had actually started working on it while they were still in the middle of the whole mania that was surrounding the first Mortal Kombat.
5722000	5736000	Um, the actors were actually filmed in, uh, on a gray screen, recorded on a Hi8 camera, and then, um, uh, which then they ended up, uh, upgrading the camera that they were using.
5736000	5741000	The video capture was computer-processed and rendered, so it was a lot of different stuff like this.
5741000	5745000	They were even said that they were spray-painted with water to make them look sweaty.
5745000	5756000	And to, um, and then they actually went and re-edited the sprites that they made from those captures to add shine and add more depth to muscle and everything.
5756000	5762000	I always thought, especially because we're looking at the video again where he's fighting Liu Kang, and Liu Kang looks especially shiny.
5762000	5763000	Yeah.
5763000	5769000	Goro and Kentaro were clay sculptures that were made by a friend of, uh, John Tobias.
5769000	5775000	Um, and these were, uh, turned into 12-inch latex miniatures for stop-motion filming.
5775000	5787000	Um, and they had to keep all of the, um, the costumes simple because of things like, uh, what they had to be able to animate.
5787000	5796000	So they would actually freeze, uh, have them pose in, like, a curled-up position so that if they had to do things like a backflip or something, it was just a stationary pose.
5796000	5798000	It wasn't, like, a full animation.
5798000	5810000	Um, and then, um, the memory limitation, um, of the game was why they couldn't include more of the characters from the previous game.
5810000	5816000	They had to have more palette-swap characters, um, and just had the move lists, you know, set for each character.
5817000	5823000	Um, the other thing, too, is that they actually, uh, worked on gravity effects for the game.
5823000	5829000	Um, redid a lot of the music. Basically, they just put- went all out into this.
5829000	5835000	Um, and there was even a, um, a comic book that came out, um, when the arcade version came out.
5835000	5839000	It was actually written and done, uh, drawn by Tobias.
5839000	5842000	I've had a copy of this at one time.
5842000	5846000	So as far as, um, versions, there's a fucking buttload of them.
5846000	5853000	Um, there are- there's actually a whole wiki page dedicated to the various versions.
5853000	5859000	So there was the Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo, Game Boy, Game Gear, Master System, 32X PlayStation,
5859000	5864000	Sega Saturn, Amiga, DOS, um, later releases under the Midway Arcade Treasures,
5864000	5867000	and then PSN, Xbox Live Arcade, and Windows editions.
5867000	5870000	So, trust me, it's not hard to find this.
5870000	5881000	What I want to find is, um, good, uh, emulators of the, uh, what's the version of the- of the beta versions.
5881000	5883000	Because the betas, I think, were a little bit more fun to play.
5883000	5885000	Ooh, I think I have some of those on the cabinet.
5885000	5886000	Mm-hmm.
5886000	5892000	Um, now the game, though, was opened up to a ton of controversy, even more than the first window.
5893000	5898000	So many people were like, ooh, violence and blood and blah blah blah blah blah.
5898000	5900000	And it was banned in Germany.
5900000	5904000	Um, it was considered harmful to young persons.
5904000	5910000	All versions except the Game Boy edition were confiscated for violating German penal code.
5910000	5917000	Um, the game also came out with green colored blood and black and white fatality sequences in Japan.
5917000	5923000	Um, which was kind of the opposite of what we would have with games that came out over here from Japan.
5923000	5925000	Yeah, isn't that the opposite of what happened with Kill Bill?
5925000	5926000	Yeah.
5926000	5928000	Well, Kill Bill was still much later, but-
5928000	5930000	Yeah, I know, but still, it's just interesting.
5930000	5939000	Um, and this is something, actually, that Boon came out saying that they were glad, you know, that a rating system is actually a good idea.
5939000	5943000	And they were happy that it existed for the time that Mortal Kombat 2 came out.
5943000	5949000	It was an M-rated game, so people wouldn't have an issue with it. They knew what they were going into.
5949000	5950000	Um-
5950000	5956000	Which is funny, because nowadays if it's an M-rated game, they don't know what they're getting into, for the most part.
5956000	5967000	And then, uh, Guy Aoki, who was the president of a media action network for Asian Americans, said that it was perpetuating existing stereotypes of Asian martial artists.
5967000	5972000	Even though, and I will point this out, most of the, uh, cast was Hispanic.
5973000	5988000	Um, it's just a whole bunch of crap came out, and then there were, you know, it was just so much that went out, and now we sort of look at it and go, oh, oh, oh, laugh about it.
5988000	5990000	But we still see this happen today.
5990000	5997000	I think many folks our age certainly remember it was, like, the first Super Nintendo game where Nintendo finally said, all right, you can put blood in the game.
5997000	6000000	You know, and that's probably thanks to the fact that the ESRB was there now.
6000000	6002000	Oh my god, this game was great on Super Nintendo.
6002000	6005000	And Super Nintendo was a great translation, it really was.
6005000	6013000	But I remember sitting up with my little brothers, uh, because, um, in the arcade, this actually had things hidden in it.
6013000	6022000	I was gonna say, you are not gonna, you've been talking about this game for almost 15 minutes now, which is fine, it's a game that needs it, but you cannot end this without talking about the hidden game in the game.
6022000	6024000	You cannot.
6024000	6038000	After playing 250 consecutive games, um, I believe it would be 250 consecutive victories of, um, this game, you could unlock Pong.
6038000	6041000	Yes, you can play Pong hidden in this game.
6041000	6044000	I mean, I'm sorry, it's Midway. Fuck.
6044000	6061000	So, um, it was just, my brothers and I sat and tried so hard to see if it was there in the Super Nintendo version only to find out that it only let us play 200 matches before it reset the number.
6061000	6063000	So sad, so sad.
6063000	6079000	Um, there were, of course, other rumors of unlockable content, like, um, the Nudality, which, of course, wasn't gonna happen, you know, because people can't seem to separate, you know, their libido from a fucking video game.
6079000	6092000	Um, there was also, um, you know, a few different Torch, there was the Torch thing that was basically a unnamed Liu Kang that was, like, back in the background of one of the pits.
6092000	6103000	Um, and then they actually brought that out in Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance as a character named Blaze, um, who actually became the final boss of Mortal Kombat Armageddon.
6103000	6111000	Um, the Animalities, which they, you know, had rumored in this one, they came out in Mortal Kombat 3.
6111000	6120000	So, uh, there was even that, wasn't the, there was the Mortal Kombat movie, which was good. The second Mortal Kombat movie was crap.
6120000	6128000	And I don't even think I bared with, bothered, no, I did see the second one in the theater, it was the third one I was forced to watch and wanted that hour and a half of my life back.
6128000	6131000	It was straight to video, wasn't it? The third one was straight to video, wasn't it?
6131000	6134000	I think so. Maybe, I don't remember.
6134000	6139000	Mortal Kombat 2 actually does have an HD remake collection, which is a Mortal Kombat arcade collection.
6139000	6147000	Um, but yeah, you know, I'm actually really disappointed because this article doesn't have all of the hidden stuff in it.
6147000	6153000	Um, and then there was the, um, yeah, the other rumor about Scarlet, remember?
6153000	6154000	Oh yeah.
6154000	6161000	Which was supposed to be a red palette swap of Mileena, and she ended up being in the 2011 Mortal Kombat.
6161000	6175000	So, I guess there's all this stuff in there. But yeah, I like how they take the speculations that the fan community has, you know, made or tried to do and like, okay, well, you asked for it.
6175000	6182000	Thank you for saving us the idea of, you know, trouble, you know, of brainstorming this. Here we go.
6182000	6184000	So yeah, the game's Mortal Kombat 2.
6184000	6190000	There it is. As I say, that 16-minute video finished Star Saga. You've been talking about this game a long time. That's alright. You know what? It's a great game.
6190000	6192000	I have fond, fond memories.
6192000	6193000	As I'm sure a lot of people do.
6193000	6195000	Fond, fuzzy, warm, happy memories.
6195000	6196000	Alright.
6196000	6198000	Of such a violent, gory game.
6198000	6205000	But we are going to take a break, guys. When we come back, there's plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come, including the chance for you guys to call in and participate with the show.
6205000	6216000	Maybe you want to talk to Loki about that whole amiibo thing, or maybe you want to talk about Final Fantasy, especially the Final Fantasy Mexico version, as Darusaku was talking about earlier in the show.
6216000	6217000	Or...
6217000	6219000	I do like that title, though. That's awesome.
6219000	6227000	If you are, you aren't excited for Dragon Quest Heroes. We'll talk about all that and more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.
6227000	6244000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this March 1st, 2015. Can you believe it's March already? The 589th episode of our show, already in progress.
6245000	6257000	And before we get to rapid-fire news tonight, let us go to the forum follow-up segment, where we are going to take a post or two from our forums and talk about it.
6262000	6271000	Actually, there wasn't a lot of activity on the forums this week, and part of that was my bad. I didn't really get around to making any topics to follow up last week's show, because I was doing some other stuff.
6271000	6279000	But, thankfully, some of y'all remember that you can make topics, and we'll still talk about them on the show if you want to do some extended discussion.
6279000	6286000	And Flaco Jones made a topic on the forum this week that he calls the Metacritic Danger Zone.
6286000	6293000	And that was inspired by something we were talking about on last week's show with The Order and the poor Metacritic score that The Order was receiving.
6293000	6300000	And so Flaco Jones was wondering on the forums, what is your favorite game that scored a 74 or lower, that would be yellow or red,
6300000	6305000	despite the fact that you think it's plenty awesome anyway? I'm going to be greedy and pick two.
6305000	6310000	And Flaco Jones picked Beyond Two Souls, which had got a 70 on Metacritic, saying,
6330000	6337000	And then Flaco Jones mentions Game & Wario for Wii U, which got a 61.
6337000	6357000	Not a lot of responses in our forums. Maybe you guys want to chime in at our chat room right now over at live.vognole.com.
6357000	6364000	Since I didn't get to comment on that, I would say probably any of the Earth Defense Force games, because those are all nice in the middle there.
6364000	6369000	I had picked a few as well. I picked White Knight Chronicles, which I think got a 64 on Metacritic.
6369000	6375000	But it's a level 5 game, which you know, Fantasy Life, Ni No Kuni. I liked it more than most people did.
6375000	6380000	I didn't think it was like a plus game, but it was better than a lot of people said it was.
6380000	6383000	Especially when you consider the sequel was both games, which was a really good value.
6383000	6389000	And I also picked Every Extend Extra, which was a 74, so it was like right on the border.
6389000	6394000	But I think Every Extend Extra should have been a game that was in the 90s. It was one of the PSP highlights for me.
6394000	6399000	And I loved the version they had on Xbox 360 as well, Every Extend Extra Extreme.
6399000	6404000	So, anyway, thank you Flaco for that topic this week.
6404000	6410000	And if you want to participate with some follow-up topics from this week's show, forums.vognetwork.com.
6410000	6419000	Dark Soccer, before I have you do your rapid-fire news stories, any games you can think of that you love that critics did not love?
6419000	6425000	I can think of a lot of movies I love that critics hate. I like Xanadu.
6425000	6430000	Yeah, that's true. I can think of a lot of those pretty easy too. It's a little harder with games.
6430000	6437000	I've liked a few RPGs that got kind of poo-pooed as being too simplistic or too short.
6438000	6440000	Final Fantasy Mystic Quest? Just kidding.
6440000	6448000	No. Do Prism, or what do we get it over here? Threads of Fate? I liked that game.
6448000	6457000	There's been greatly lauded games that I didn't like. So, it's a matter of taste and no critic can tell you what to like.
6457000	6459000	Don't judge me. I love what I love.
6459000	6460000	That's right.
6460000	6461000	They can bite my butt.
6461000	6469000	Alright, speaking Dark Sakura of you and what's going on, you actually are going to be departing the show a little early tonight because you have some IRL things going on.
6469000	6470000	Yeah.
6470000	6476000	So, we're going to let you go ahead and do your rapid-fire news here and then we'll be saying bye to you for the night.
6476000	6480000	Yeah, too bad. But there are burritos in my future, maybe.
6480000	6484000	Wait, are you saying burritos are more important than this show?
6484000	6487000	No, I'm just saying burritos are at least as important as the show.
6487000	6488000	Mm-hmm.
6488000	6498000	So, basically there is some news about Street Fighter V that's going to be a PS4 console exclusive, but also have a PC release.
6498000	6515000	And it's going to have a cross-platform play, but there is a character hinted at that's going to be in here is Nash from Street Fighter Alpha.
6515000	6516000	Hmm.
6516000	6519000	So, that's happy.
6519000	6521000	But they showed off Charlie this week, wasn't it?
6521000	6522000	Well...
6522000	6523000	Same. Charlie Nash.
6523000	6524000	Nash Charlie.
6524000	6525000	Oh, yeah.
6525000	6526000	Same character.
6526000	6528000	I don't think it's a rumor anymore. They had gameplay of him.
6528000	6529000	Yeah, it's up there. The pictures are out.
6529000	6530000	Yep.
6530000	6532000	Now it was in Mexico and they're teasing it as, uh...
6532000	6534000	No, I can't...
6534000	6535000	Rolento?
6535000	6536000	No, not Rolento.
6536000	6537000	I want Rolento in the game.
6538000	6539000	Uh...
6539000	6540000	God.
6540000	6543000	The master of, uh, was...
6543000	6544000	Bison.
6544000	6545000	Bison. Thank you.
6545000	6546000	I was like, duh.
6546000	6547000	I can see his face.
6547000	6548000	I can't think of his name.
6548000	6550000	The human chin.
6550000	6552000	Uh, the guy with the cape.
6552000	6553000	Uh, Superman.
6553000	6554000	No, no.
6554000	6555000	No.
6555000	6558000	As if I do recall correctly, he was in Japan.
6558000	6559000	He was Vega.
6560000	6561000	So...
6561000	6568000	Next in news, we have a Blaze Blue game, but it's a rhythm game, and you can get it now.
6568000	6575000	It actually is a mobile game called Eat Beat Dead Spikes On.
6575000	6580000	So I might have to get that just because the name is absolutely hilarious.
6580000	6586000	And then, last but not least, there is a game jam going on.
6587000	6594000	A month-long game jam called Jam For Leela that is dealing with trans issues.
6594000	6600000	So I'm really, really looking forward to what's going to be coming out of this.
6600000	6605000	There's a visual novel done by Lara Kate Dale from Destructoid.
6605000	6610000	Lots of other neat stuff to be seen from that one, so I'm really looking forward to it.
6610000	6612000	It should be almost done.
6612000	6615000	There are 22 participating games that are available now.
6616000	6617000	So, that's it.
6617000	6622000	Leela, if I'm not mistaken, was the teen that took her own life and made the big tumb-
6622000	6624000	That her parents were being shits over.
6624000	6631000	Yeah, she made the big Tumblr post about it, and the parents really, really needed education.
6631000	6633000	To put it lightly.
6633000	6637000	No, I'm just going to say plainly, her parents had access to the education.
6637000	6638000	Her parents were shits.
6638000	6639000	Yeah.
6639000	6641000	Very deep fundamentalists.
6641000	6642000	They are...
6642000	6645000	I don't have a problem with a person being a fundamentalist, but the moment-
6645000	6647000	They were like the mom and Carrie.
6647000	6648000	Yeah.
6648000	6649000	Unfortunately.
6649000	6655000	The moment that your fundamentalism impacts the life of another person so dramatically
6655000	6660000	that it drives them to want to die, maybe you should stop and evaluate your beliefs.
6660000	6661000	Just saying.
6661000	6670000	Sorry, I didn't mean to take it to a rough place, but I think that shocking news really
6670000	6673000	rallied people to want to...
6673000	6677000	In case people might be wondering, why is this important?
6677000	6678000	Why are we reporting on it?
6678000	6683000	Because we as a society have a long way to go with trans issues still.
6683000	6685000	Long way to go.
6685000	6689000	We're making a lot of progress with gay and lesbian.
6689000	6690000	We're making progress.
6690000	6692000	We're not there yet, but we're making a lot of progress.
6692000	6693000	34 states.
6693000	6696000	When I've lost count of how many states, that's good.
6696000	6697000	Even though I-
6697000	6698000	My home state.
6698000	6699000	Even though I would like to say-
6699000	6700000	Alabama.
6700000	6702000	Even though I would like to say 50 states.
6702000	6708000	But what happened with Lila regretfully shows we have a long way to go with our trans brothers
6708000	6709000	and sisters.
6709000	6712000	So that's why this is important, in case you were wondering.
6712000	6718000	There actually is a really good Tumblr out there, by the way, for people who are transitioning
6718000	6724000	or even non-gender associated called Non-Binary Support.
6724000	6726000	I follow them.
6726000	6730000	I actually have really good information out, because I've tried to offer up support for
6730000	6735000	people on that forum when I can.
6735000	6741000	It's one thing when you are sitting there with a friend of yours who is practically
6741000	6745000	in tears, because she could have been that person.
6745000	6748000	It really hits home.
6748000	6754000	Anyway, to change the topic and move along here, DarkSakura, you are going to be on your
6754000	6755000	way out.
6755000	6758000	So let's ask at the end of the show, but I'll ask you now, do you have any final thoughts
6758000	6760000	for our listeners tonight?
6760000	6764000	I'm hungry, and I really want to play Twinbee.
6764000	6766000	Ikuma and I have been chatting about Twinbee.
6766000	6769000	Well, then you need to get a burrito, and you need to play some Twinbee, but not tonight.
6769000	6771000	And then I have to go to bed.
6771000	6772000	You got to go to bed.
6772000	6773000	Put that on your to-do list for tomorrow.
6773000	6776000	Tomorrow, work Twinbee.
6776000	6783000	Basically, my normal shift is like 1130 to 830, and my shift this week is seven to four.
6783000	6784000	Fun.
6784000	6788000	And guess whose sleep cycle is going to be completely uprooted and turned on its end?
6788000	6791000	Well, I'm going to East Coast, so the same thing will happen to me, for what it's worth.
6791000	6793000	Yeah, but you're not going to be at work.
6793000	6794000	I'm also seven to four.
6794000	6795000	Woo!
6795000	6796000	That's this week, too.
6796000	6797000	Why don't I sleep anyway?
6797000	6798000	So that's okay.
6798000	6799000	No, no, no.
6799000	6800000	And I'm really not trying to complain.
6800000	6801000	I love my job.
6801000	6802000	I just hate waking up early.
6802000	6803000	Sure.
6803000	6804000	I understand.
6804000	6806000	All right, let's go on to some more rapid-fire news.
6806000	6808000	Have a good night, DarkSakura.
6808000	6810000	We'll see you in two weeks.
6810000	6813000	Loki, your rapid-fire news tonight.
6813000	6816000	Okay, so this is kind of cool.
6816000	6821000	I'm a pretty big fan of Terry Cavanaugh, and they've got a brand new game that he's making.
6821000	6823000	Hopefully, it's uber hard as well.
6823000	6828000	It's called Grab Them by the Eyes, and it's basically you play a street food vendor named
6828000	6833000	Jay who must resort to buying an endless wave of ever flashier signs in order to attract
6833000	6836000	attention for your business.
6836000	6839000	That sounds hilarious.
6839000	6842000	I guess they're saying that it's almost like a card game.
6842000	6847000	And the signs have various texts, colors, borders, and effects, and each of those elements
6847000	6852000	contribute to some number of customers to the day's totals.
6852000	6856000	So, I do want to check this out.
6856000	6861000	Not sure when it's supposed to be released, though, but it looks pretty awesome.
6861000	6862000	It's on the web, right?
6862000	6863000	Oh, it is on its website.
6863000	6864000	I think it's already there.
6864000	6865000	Oh, I thought it was something he was selling.
6865000	6866000	No.
6866000	6867000	Okay, well, yeah.
6867000	6868000	Go check it out, then.
6868000	6871000	And don't forget about the sequel, Grab Them by the Ass.
6871000	6873000	Weren't you leaving?
6873000	6874000	Yeah.
6874000	6875000	He's a talented guy.
6875000	6876000	Yes, there you go.
6876000	6877000	I'll play just because he's eating on it.
6877000	6878000	Okay, you can check it out.
6878000	6885000	terrycavanaghames.com slash grabthembytheeyes slash grabthembytheeyes is all one word.
6885000	6886000	Awesome.
6886000	6887000	That's awesome.
6887000	6888000	Bye.
6888000	6892000	That sounds like a premise of a funny cartoon, so I'd be down with that.
6893000	6898000	And then, you know, one of the things that people kind of hated about Resident Evil Revelations 2
6898000	6902000	was the fact that, you know, the PC version got released, and then they're all,
6902000	6907000	oh, hey, by the way, there's some features that we cut out, but we didn't tell you about that until after the game was released.
6907000	6914000	One of those features was local co-op, and thanks to modders,
6914000	6919000	and this is sad that we live in a day and age now where companies can't fix their games,
6919000	6921000	but modders have to fix them for them.
6921000	6928000	They've added a mod to actually allow for split-stream co-op.
6928000	6932000	The only thing is right now is it's not part of the raid mode.
6932000	6938000	It's just in the local story mode, and also apparently you have to use game pads,
6938000	6941000	but that's still pretty cool, and I guess they're still working on that.
6941000	6947000	If you want to check it out, you can actually go find it in the Steam community forums for the game.
6950000	6956000	And then lastly, Payday 2 is getting a cool cameo character for their game,
6956000	6961000	including Jacket from Hotline Miami 2,
6961000	6965000	and you're going to be able to, by purchasing the game on Steam,
6965000	6972000	you'll be able to unlock stuff in Payday 2, including the Jacket character,
6972000	6978000	also, you know, themed masks and weapons, so that's pretty sweet.
6979000	6981000	Will it have the sweet music?
6981000	6985000	I don't know if it will have the sweet music, hopefully, because that would be pretty sweet.
6985000	6989000	I really need to go back and play that game. I have it on a bunch of different platforms.
6989000	6990000	Right, before the sequel's out.
6990000	6993000	I know, I need to. I'll make that a point this week to go play that game.
6993000	6997000	That and Civ 5, because I have it installed on my system now.
6997000	7003000	Nice. You've got to get to Beyond Earth, too, because Sid Meier's Starships got dated.
7003000	7006000	It's like the week after next, or something like that?
7006000	7012000	It's only $14.99, so it must be kind of a scaled-down game, but I'm excited to check it out, that's for sure.
7012000	7018000	Yeah, you can check that out. It's a pretty awesome pre-order bonus, I guess, if you have both of those games.
7019000	7022000	All right, moving on with some other news that I have for you guys,
7022000	7025000	including some updates with Forza Horizon 2.
7025000	7031000	There's going to be a standalone expansion called Forza Horizon 2 Presents Fast and Furious.
7031000	7035000	Could that have anything to do with the new movie coming out pretty soon? Probably.
7035000	7040000	But the expansion will be free from March 27th through April 10th.
7040000	7041000	I like free.
7041000	7044000	Well, motivation to be an Xbox owner now, too.
7044000	7045000	And it's standalone.
7045000	7049000	Yes, it is. It will cost $10 after that, just so you know.
7049000	7054000	But once you download it during the free period, you still have it free of charge.
7054000	7057000	Ludicrous will be arriving in the game with that.
7057000	7062000	Well, also, too, even if you have an Xbox 360, but say you don't have an Xbox One,
7062000	7066000	you can always download that online, and then you still have it in your library,
7066000	7071000	because that's what I've done with all the Xbox Live game with gold games, even though I don't have an Xbox One yet.
7073000	7077000	Also, Shovel Knight will be coming out on PlayStation 4, Vita, and PlayStation 3.
7077000	7080000	We knew that this was coming from, I think, the PlayStation Experience,
7080000	7083000	is when they announced that Shovel Knight will make its way over there.
7083000	7090000	But now we have a date. April 21st is the date. PlayStation Plus members will be able to pick this game up for $13.49,
7090000	7093000	a little discount there, $15 after that.
7093000	7099000	There will be a boss battle with Kratos in the game, so a lot of people will be checking it out for that fact alone,
7099000	7102000	and to be able to play with that pretty awesome PlayStation 4 controller.
7102000	7105000	Another game I have owned, but I haven't played yet.
7105000	7106000	Shame, shame.
7106000	7107000	Damn it.
7107000	7108000	All right.
7108000	7111000	I was almost going to buy more games this week, too, for no apparent reason.
7111000	7116000	And get this, a Sega Capcom crossover comic, Worlds Unite.
7116000	7122000	That's right, Archie Comics creating Worlds Unite, and it's a crossover between Sega and Capcom,
7122000	7126000	and lots of characters, including some we haven't seen in a very long time.
7126000	7127000	And Mega Man, which...
7127000	7128000	Mega Man, for one.
7128000	7129000	Ironically, you know.
7129000	7133000	Get this, though, from Sega, Billy Hatcher, Alex Kidd.
7133000	7134000	It's pretty rad.
7134000	7139000	Knights from Capcom, Nina from Breath of Fire, Viewtiful Joe, we miss him.
7139000	7140000	That's what I'm saying.
7140000	7145000	You get a fighting game that has these characters all together, and you release it on consoles.
7145000	7147000	People buy the shit out of it.
7147000	7150000	Sadly, it is a comic, not a game.
7150000	7151000	I understand that.
7151000	7152000	I know, I'm just saying.
7152000	7153000	It should be a game, right?
7153000	7154000	Why not?
7154000	7155000	Why not?
7155000	7158000	It's way more interesting than any of the Sonic games that they've put out recently.
7158000	7162000	Well, they had that Sonic Mega Man crossover a while back.
7162000	7165000	I mean, let's do something with that.
7165000	7167000	I mean, come on.
7167000	7171000	Alright, let's get into the Fugu Question of the Week.
7171000	7175000	Every week, we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities, and we read some
7175000	7177000	of our favorite answers here on the show.
7186000	7190000	Alright, for tonight's Fugu Question of the Week, we asked you guys about this whole Guitar
7190000	7192000	Hero rock band situation.
7192000	7193000	What do you think of the news?
7193000	7197000	Guitar Hero may be on its way back from a long sleep this year.
7197000	7200000	Do you think the revival of these plastic instrument franchises is a good thing, or
7200000	7203000	are they better left in our memory?
7203000	7207000	We had a few people answer over on Facebook, so let me read some of those answers here.
7207000	7208000	Fifth Dream saying,
7214000	7217000	Well, that seems as good of a reason as any, right?
7217000	7218000	It has been several years.
7218000	7222000	If you think about it, you know, there's maybe like 20-year-olds that were only like 14 when
7222000	7223000	this game was last running.
7223000	7224000	I know.
7224000	7226000	This is awesome that music games are coming back, Konami.
7226000	7230000	Ed S. replies and says,
7235000	7238000	Well, let's, I, we got to place a phone call and see if that's going to happen.
7238000	7239000	Let's hope so.
7239000	7240000	Let's hope so.
7240000	7241000	I sure hope so.
7241000	7242000	I'd love to go to that again.
7242000	7243000	It was a great cause.
7243000	7245000	Well, at the very least, they have new DLCs.
7245000	7246000	I mean, that's something.
7246000	7247000	That's something.
7247000	7248000	Andy R. saying,
7253000	7256000	They do it in a way that doesn't kill the genre.
7256000	7258000	DJ Rama S. says,
7267000	7268000	Ooh.
7268000	7273000	I have a really, let me, remind me to tell you my crazy tinfoil hat thought after.
7273000	7274000	Okay.
7274000	7278000	Ursa being Slurpee said, but DJ Rama just totally made a spark go off in my head.
7278000	7280000	Ursa being Slurpee replied and said,
7291000	7293000	Well, that's, that's a really good way of looking at it.
7293000	7296000	That's a great way to say I'm not a fan, but for those that are, have at it.
7296000	7298000	Bryce H. says,
7298000	7299000	I think it's great they're coming back.
7299000	7302000	I can't tell you how many times I heard a new song on the radio and thought to myself,
7302000	7304000	man, this would be fun to play on Guitar Hero or a rock band.
7304000	7306000	So I'm super excited about this news.
7306000	7307000	RageNator says,
7320000	7321000	Rene A. replied and said,
7321000	7326000	I think this could be a good thing, but I'm hoping there will be more variety in the songs available from a variety of genres.
7326000	7328000	And SHO and Hunter Matt on Facebook says,
7340000	7343000	We're going to go over to Google Plus as well and check out the answers over there.
7343000	7349000	Although I think we just had a couple of answers because it's not quite as trafficked on Google Plus.
7349000	7353000	Regretfully for Google and Act Def saying on Google.
7353000	7357000	As long as they don't oversaturate the market like they did last gen, I don't mind.
7357000	7361000	Of course, I'm probably going to give my support to Harmonix rather than Activision on this one.
7361000	7362000	And lastly, Retertainment says,
7362000	7367000	The reason the plastic music genre collapsed wasn't because of an oversaturation of games.
7367000	7371000	It was because of an oversaturation of expensive, incompatible plastic instruments.
7371000	7376000	If they can do something to address that, I'd love to see these games make a comeback.
7376000	7378000	All right. I mentioned tinfoil hat. You ready?
7378000	7388000	So there was a word in Rama's post, something that also has changed in the past six years or so since the last time we saw these games.
7389000	7394000	That's not just social. Mobile. Mobile.
7394000	7400000	Now, thinking about the Jackbox games and even like SingStar, what do they allow you to do?
7400000	7402000	Use your mobile phone as the controller.
7402000	7404000	They don't sell SingStar microphones anymore.
7404000	7408000	Well, they might, but SingStar has an app on the iPhone that you use.
7408000	7412000	It kind of works just for, you know, like a microphone and stuff.
7412000	7415000	I'm not sure if that would be, I mean, that'd be cool for the microphone part.
7415000	7417000	But wasn't there singing in Rock Band?
7417000	7418000	There was.
7418000	7422000	Wasn't part of the problem about all the harmony and everything? It was like, God, I don't have enough microphones.
7422000	7429000	Imagine if now your cellular phone can be a microphone and it'll be like, bang, one plastic instrument solved right there.
7429000	7433000	So you don't even have to buy an instrument. If all you want to do is sing, you can just buy the base game and use your mobile phone.
7433000	7435000	Assuming, of course, that you have a mobile phone.
7435000	7440000	But it's safe to say that enough people do that they could probably get away with that.
7441000	7447000	Just throwing it out there. And then, I don't know what kind of instrument you could have on mobile. Maybe a...
7447000	7450000	Well, I'm not even worried about that so much because they've got...
7450000	7453000	I don't know, like a frickin' mambo.
7453000	7456000	It won't work very well, yeah, as far as like instruments on mobile.
7456000	7457000	It really won't.
7457000	7467000	So, I mean, I don't know. Any instruments on mobile, aside from singing, we're getting into Wii Music territory there.
7467000	7469000	It's not where you want to go with that.
7469000	7479000	Oh, God. I wonder, I gotta ask if Bobby's still listening. Bobby, how would you feel if the entire drum kit was available on an iPad where you could just play with your fingers?
7479000	7481000	Pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat, pat.
7481000	7486000	Would that kind of, would that be something you'd be excited about? And I ask this to all the drummers out there.
7486000	7490000	Would you be excited about that or would that make you kind of twitch? Like, no, please don't.
7490000	7493000	Because that's the only other thing I could see on mobile is pat, pat, pat drumming.
7494000	7502000	He's sitting pretty nice because he has a MIDI set and so all he has to do is just wait for them to, you know, put on an updated MIDI controller or that.
7502000	7507000	But, you know, whereas I have console exclusive peripherals, that's not so good.
7507000	7516000	There it is. Alright, some folks in chat wanting Accordion Hero, Weird Al Accordion Hero.
7516000	7523000	Give love for a Weird Al exclusive version. Like, give him, give Weird Al the Beatles treatment.
7523000	7529000	BobbyBlackWolf in chat says, no. I can just imagine that little JPEG with Grumpy Cat, no.
7529000	7535000	But then again, ReRave was kind of fun. So, trying to see the silver lining in my crazy tinfoil hat thought there.
7535000	7541000	Alright, there you go. There's the Fugu question of the week. Let's get back into some more news. Loki.
7542000	7546000	With that kind of reminded me, is anyone still giving a shit about Fantasia?
7546000	7550000	Yeah, I think it came out and people didn't like it enough.
7550000	7554000	I know, but that's it. It came out and that's the last I remember of it.
7554000	7557000	Well, that's what usually happens with video games, Loki.
7557000	7562000	Is there like any DLC for it? I mean, are they supporting it? It's like kind of, you know, I don't know.
7562000	7564000	It kind of just dropped off the face of you.
7564000	7568000	I think I remember stories about DLC. I think there has been DLC for that game.
7568000	7575000	It's just probably, you know, with the Xbox having distanced itself from Kinect,
7575000	7579000	and the Kinect being very important to the experience of Fantasia,
7579000	7585000	I think unfortunately, and we all knew this was going to happen, it kind of muted Fantasia's arrival a little bit.
7585000	7587000	That doesn't make the game any worse.
7587000	7588000	True.
7588000	7593000	And Bobby BlackWolf saying, I enjoyed Fantasia and they released DLC songs and DLC remixes.
7593000	7595000	So, they did extend that a little bit.
7595000	7596000	Alright. There you go.
7596000	7601000	Anyways, games with gold. So, for March, they got actually a pretty decent lineup.
7601000	7606000	If you have an Xbox One, your game of the month is going to be Rayman Legends, which is pretty sweet.
7606000	7610000	And iDARV, if you haven't picked that up already, so please do.
7610000	7616000	Also, up until the 15th for Xbox 360, you'll be able to download Tomb Raider.
7616000	7619000	And then, starting on March 16th, Bioshock Infinite.
7619000	7622000	So, I'd say overall, that's a pretty solid month.
7622000	7624000	So, check those out.
7624000	7631000	Ironically, though, we're already in March and we still haven't heard of the lineup for PlayStation Plus.
7631000	7634000	That's kind of a head scratcher right there.
7634000	7635000	Yeah, a little bit.
7635000	7638000	So, I'm kind of curious to see what's going to go on there.
7638000	7640000	What games are we getting?
7640000	7644000	Yeah, you've got to wonder if they're going to pull some big rabbit out of the hat.
7644000	7646000	Like, Drive Club! Fucking finally!
7646000	7647000	Or Knack.
7647000	7650000	I mean, they're practically leaving that way already.
7650000	7652000	I mean, I don't know.
7652000	7653000	I could see that.
7653000	7656000	Yeah, I was talking about this the other day with Flaco Jones.
7656000	7658000	Like, what could the games be?
7658000	7661000	And I was kind of saying, you know, this is probably the month we finally get Knack.
7661000	7662000	We all know it's coming.
7662000	7664000	Knack is going to be coming, yeah.
7664000	7665000	It's a matter of time.
7665000	7667000	I can't think of whatever, like, really...
7667000	7672000	I don't know, unless we start getting into Angry Birds or something like that.
7672000	7675000	You know, like, a really shitty PS4 game.
7675000	7678000	Like, a game that had no business being on PlayStation 4 type of thing.
7678000	7679000	Yeah.
7679000	7681000	Drive Club at some point soon.
7681000	7683000	Maybe now's the time for Drive Club.
7683000	7689000	Maybe. Maybe they just don't want to promise it until they're, like, absolutely sure those network issues are not going to fuck everything up.
7689000	7692000	Because, I mean, the retail release of that game got so screwed.
7692000	7696000	But this is a chance to reboot it, in a way, you know?
7696000	7698000	Get people excited about it. Who knows?
7698000	7699000	Yeah.
7699000	7704000	Alright, well, I mentioned earlier in the show that this game is showing some really strong legs through its DLC.
7704000	7707000	And that is Hyrule Warriors on the Wii U.
7707000	7712000	I got to admit, you know, when it first came out, I was kind of like, eh, there's a lot of other games I want to play right now.
7712000	7714000	This is kind of going to slip by.
7714000	7718000	But the more and more stuff that keeps happening in this game, and the way they've really given this game legs...
7718000	7722000	Because I sort of thought Nintendo would kind of just let it go.
7722000	7724000	But they really haven't. They've been supporting it.
7724000	7726000	And here we go again.
7726000	7730000	Ganon got his own separate mode coming into the game.
7730000	7733000	It's releasing March 12th in North America.
7734000	7739000	And it's part of the season pass for the game, or you can get it by itself for $3.
7739000	7741000	It's part of the Boss Pack DLC.
7741000	7748000	But this is what's also awesome about it, is that apparently, in this pack, a giant chicken.
7748000	7750000	It's Pojo all over again!
7750000	7754000	The Quokko you can actually play in that game.
7755000	7758000	There's a boss rush mode.
7758000	7761000	So if you want to do that, you can do that.
7761000	7765000	And then a free game update coming as well that will address load times.
7765000	7768000	Raise the level cap to 255.
7768000	7774000	And have the apothecary carry mixtures that cause the weak point gauge to deplete more quickly.
7774000	7778000	Increase attacks against giant bosses, and absorb magic from bosses.
7778000	7782000	I've got to say, that game is really turning out to be a lot better than I thought it was going to be.
7782000	7784000	I mean, I thought it was going to be okay.
7784000	7787000	But actually, they're supporting it quite well.
7788000	7791000	Now you know Bobby's jumping in here with a jab at you, Loki.
7791000	7795000	I thought Nintendo didn't understand modern gaming and were dying and can't be sustained.
7795000	7801000	Yeah, but this is Koei that's developing this game, not Nintendo.
7803000	7804000	Alright.
7804000	7809000	That's a little bit different. They understand DLC in their games a little more than Nintendo.
7810000	7818000	Anyhow, you know what, I'm sure a lot of it too is to keep the Zelda hype going for Majora's Mask on 3DS.
7818000	7825000	And then of course the big Zelda Wii U, which will be a definite head spinner this holiday season, I'm sure.
7827000	7831000	Let's see, Dark Sakura was going to talk about this, but I guess I'm going to talk about it instead.
7831000	7836000	It had to do a Mortal Kombat as well, which her class game of the week of course was Mortal Kombat.
7836000	7840000	But as you know, Mortal Kombat X is on the way out.
7840000	7844000	Brutalities were revealed for the game. There's supposed to be a whole lot of them.
7844000	7849000	And then another new trailer came out that shows some new characters, including Mileena.
7849000	7851000	Yay, one of my favorites. I love Mileena.
7851000	7854000	I think Mileena is supposed to be the main boss of the game now.
7854000	7855000	Oh, interesting.
7855000	7857000	Based on what the trailer was.
7857000	7858000	That's the story trailer.
7858000	7860000	Yeah, and I was like, there's a story?
7861000	7871000	Also revealed in the trailer, daughter of Jax, Jacqueline Briggs, son of Kenshi and Kung Jin, descendant of Kung Lao, Takashi Takeda.
7871000	7880000	Now I don't know if, I didn't catch if these characters were playable or if they are just part of the story.
7880000	7883000	I guess they are. They are showing on a confirmed playable list.
7883000	7887000	Jacqueline Briggs is there, Takashi Takeda and Kung Jin are all on that list.
7887000	7889000	So I guess that is pretty cool. I guess they are playable, after all.
7889000	7893000	So that's kind of cool. That's going to be a lot, a lot of characters in the game.
7893000	7896000	The only one that's not on the playable list is Mileena.
7896000	7900000	So maybe you're right in the whole, like, she's the big, big boss or something.
7900000	7901000	So she's not in the playable list.
7901000	7904000	It's kind of weird. You'd think they would be like some new person.
7904000	7908000	Yeah. So there you go. Some updates there with Mortal Kombat X.
7908000	7914000	Which, although it may be a bit too violent for me, I'll probably have to check it out anyway.
7914000	7916000	I think I'm going to end up buying it anyway. I have a week.
7916000	7919000	I want to know what the bonus characters are going to be.
7919000	7923000	Is what I want to know. What are we looking at as DLC characters?
7923000	7925000	Because that would be kind of interesting.
7925000	7926000	Can we get Deadpool?
7926000	7929000	Maybe. Ash from Evil Dead is a lot of the rumors.
7929000	7930000	I hope so.
7930000	7933000	Or Jason would make a lot of sense after Freddy. Who knows?
7933000	7935000	That would be pretty sweet. I don't know.
7935000	7941000	Alright. So there was a Sonic 3D title that never came out.
7942000	7945000	It was teased at E3 way back.
7945000	7954000	But now, thanks to some fans of Sonic, they have made it possible to play said game because they've ported it over to PC.
7954000	7958000	And this is Sonic Extreme. It was originally supposed to be a Saturn game.
7958000	7963000	It never was finished, but now it's playable on PC.
7963000	7970000	And it kind of reminds me of, like, Gex, but, you know, Sonic.
7970000	7980000	And it's really weird. I mean, even in the trailer that they had for the E3, the actual official trailer, and then the PC trailer, they have the rings there, but it doesn't look like he's collecting them.
7980000	7982000	He's just, like, going right through them.
7982000	7985000	Now he just swings from them, or he just kind of, you know...
7985000	7987000	He just clips right through them.
7987000	7989000	Because of reasons.
7989000	7993000	I don't know. It looks okay, I guess.
7993000	7997000	I don't know. It kind of looks like a lot of the Saturn games did back then.
7997000	8004000	Just very, you know, depth 3D type stuff in there, and not so...
8004000	8007000	Kind of like 3D platforming, I guess.
8007000	8011000	But you can check that out, and I'm trying to see where you can find it.
8011000	8013000	Hackers gonna hack, but in this case...
8013000	8016000	Or modders gonna mod, or whatever the case may be.
8016000	8020000	But in this case, to allow us all to play a game that we may never have played otherwise, right?
8020000	8025000	Yeah, you can check it out. The Sonic Retro forums had links to the game, so you can check that out there.
8025000	8031000	Still better than probably the last Sonic game that they put out.
8031000	8033000	Still better than Sonic Boom.
8033000	8034000	Still better than that.
8034000	8042000	At least his proportions look correct in this picture, as opposed to Lanky Legs Sonic there.
8042000	8047000	Alright, well, Disney is at work on a new game for the Wii U.
8048000	8055000	A character artist and 3D artist shared images of a Disney project that she was working on for the Wii U.
8055000	8057000	They're medieval fantasy characters.
8057000	8061000	These characters were shown with permission by Carrie Mail.
8061000	8063000	Actually showed off these images.
8063000	8066000	We just don't really know exactly what it's all about.
8068000	8073000	What this medieval fantasy game could be, because it doesn't tie into an existing Disney franchise.
8073000	8075000	Or at least it sure doesn't look like it.
8075000	8084000	So, Disney is at work with something for the Wii U that's in a medieval fantasy setting that doesn't tie into one of their existing properties, it appears.
8084000	8086000	Who knows?
8086000	8087000	So, that's really all I got.
8087000	8088000	Tron medieval.
8088000	8090000	Tron medieval.
8092000	8096000	Remember, they said that there's a new Tron game coming out. What was it that one artist says?
8096000	8100000	I will point out though, these drawings, they're nice. They're very good looking.
8100000	8103000	But they're perfect for little figurines, don't you think?
8105000	8108000	Do you think that's something that Disney might be double dipping in?
8108000	8110000	A Disney Infinity RPG type thing.
8110000	8115000	Oh no, why even be tied to Disney Infinity? A completely separate character collection game.
8115000	8119000	At least Disney can print all the toys to me to hand.
8120000	8128000	You know what, and to be fair, Disney actually, as far as from what I remember dealing with Activision and Disney,
8128000	8132000	when you buy figures from Activision, they're all fucking randomly assorted.
8132000	8140000	So, forget it. Oh, I'm out of X figure. Well, fuck you, you're gonna get random figures until you get whatever you want.
8140000	8144000	Whereas Disney, it's like, oh hey, we need more Mickey. Okay, cool, we can order some more Mickey.
8144000	8150000	You know, instead of, fuck you, you're gonna have to order some random assortments until you maybe get Mickey or not.
8150000	8153000	Yeah, that's kind of Activision's take on the whole thing.
8153000	8157000	I'm laughing because Dark Tetsuya is accusing me of baiting you. Maybe a little.
8157000	8161000	Hitstun in chat says, EpicMickey3? Doesn't really...
8161000	8163000	Nah, it doesn't look like anything Mickey.
8163000	8168000	I mean, anything's possible, but it doesn't... I kind of feel like EpicMickey's kind of done for after the second game as well.
8168000	8170000	Yeah, I don't think...
8170000	8172000	Anything's possible, anything's possible.
8172000	8180000	Alright, anyhow, let's go to the mailbag because every week you guys send us emails and we take a moment to read them here on the program.
8180000	8198000	participate at orange laundry calm is the place to send those emails and we will read our favorites here on the air we have two emails to read tonight obviously with our soccer not here somebody's got to fill in
8198000	8227000	so I volunteer as tribute first email tonight from entertainment who says howdy I'm curious as to why sky reacted so negatively the Loki's thought from last week that Nintendo would sell the amiibo trading cards in a blind pack sky's reaction struck me as weird given that it's already common practice for trading card companies to sell their cards in blind packs go down to your local place that sells trading cards assuming you can find such an establishment and you can find row after row of trading cards in blind packs from many different companies across many different media properties
8228000	8256000	ranging from sports to TV shows to whatever the fuck Duck Dynasty is also well before we get to the second half of the email let me let me take a minute to respond to the first half here's the difference in my opinion with the trading card packs and those types of games you're talking about that's that's all of it that's the whole niche behind it like a game like Magic the Gathering that you know some cards are going to be rarer than others and that maintains the balance of the game right but with amiibo you want a
8256000	8276000	certain character because that's the character you want to level in the game and I just I don't know I kind of feel like you know when you own the base game itself you can play pretty much any character you want granted there are a few unlocks but anybody can unlock those the same way so therefore there's not that same rarity level
8277000	8301000	whereas if you have these blind packs then I worry you are going to have some of that rarity level and it would be imagine how frickin frustrating it would be to buy a blind pack and then get a card from Mario now not that Mario is a bad character or whatever but the Mario amiibo is not hard to find if you want Mario or link gee Nintendo doesn't seem to have a problem making enough of those to go around for the most part
8301000	8327000	but do you see the difference there the rarity factor kind of comes into play I feel like in the trading cards you're talking about that's the entire game whereas these are enhancements to an existing game that's the difference to me I hope that makes sense I mean I just if I'm going to go out and buy one of these cards or whatever I want the one I want I'm not fucking gambling to get Ness who I want or something like that does that make sense
8327000	8330000	Alright second half of the email from Entertainment
8358000	8379000	fire emblem look it up also I I think I just I'm not okay with that whole like imbalance and rarity and now you're talking about kids too I don't know I don't know again when that is the game it's kind of a different thing but when it's a accessory to an existing game I think it's different I don't know
8379000	8404000	well they have been doesn't that's how they do with Disney infinity and I don't like it there either just to be clear and I haven't bought a one so I'm just just at least I'm consistent right so I don't like it there either in Disney infinity so alright moving on let's see going to the next email which I just closed the freaking meal bag this is why Jamie handles it people this is why I don't do it
8405000	8431000	alright hello can I do this here while I put the email bag help me out here Loki alright well let's talk about how much I hate me both some more no I I just it's cool they're collectible figures but it's not what they're selling them as oh we're good alright anyway second email
8431000	8460000	from Martin from Belgium if I'm not mistaken who says hello olr hope y'all are doing well I had issues getting my gamepad to work with the game grow home it took 1.5 hours a bunch of driver reinstalls in a shady exe file but eventually it worked this kind of stuff makes me realize PC gaming is never going to be as mainstream as consoles are or some things will seriously need to change I've been a PC gamer for 16 years or so and it has been like this as long as I can remember nothing ever changed
8461000	8488000	just works do you think the steam boxes are a viable solution to this problem of standardization let's stop and answer that question do you think the steam boxes are a viable method that standardization I think that's part of what they want to accomplish but remember there's not just one steam box there's many different steam boxes and if I'm not mistaken the way things were when we last heard of them they were a little on the pricey side too so I
8488000	8517960	don't even know if they're still coming out with them yeah it seems odd we haven't heard anything about it in a while huh yeah I would think GDC a good time to hear about that um so I'm gonna actually say no but what's interesting is that some of these VR headsets we're hearing about coming out I think are an attempt to kind of standardize that even though everybody has their own well I think there is still some there is some standardization with you know gamepads now it seems like everything works with the Xbox 360 controller true and even with like
8517960	8547720	steam you know like big picture mode and stuff I think that they have stuff that kind of have some sort of broad controller support and I know with their steam controller that that's something that's going to eventually happen as well so maybe they're moving towards I think that's one of the things that with consoles you have a lot more restrictions as far as okay your game must be able to support these you know controllers a hundred percent and I guess more of it's like testing I think you know and how do you not
8547760	8574360	test your game like grow home or something with controllers and not have that work like right from the get go I don't know if this is like a new controller that you're using now or if this is something that worked on other games but for some reason this game is giving you shit it could very well be a bug in the very like in a version of the game because you know I had that with one of the was it I am bread or something like that is early access and they had some controller support issues so then they fix it
8574360	8583560	moving on with the email or is streaming gaming the future where the firepower is in the cloud and we play on any device connected to the internet
8583560	8611720	I once again you know even like the amiibos and other technology that they're really pushing you know for the use of I need to see a good example of what this means to me as far as like really good gameplay because you know how they had Titanfall I want to see what the difference was Titanfall without cloud support and Titanfall with cloud support I mean why it seemed like you know to me I didn't notice anything like whoa this is so much better than if it weren't always connected online
8611720	8641000	I sort of think lag is going to be an issue for a very very very long time until they can really you know minimalize that to you know such a negligible amount that games will still flow very easy I think streaming gaming will grow more and more and we're going to see more and more of it in the coming years but I don't see it 100% taking over because I just feel like there's always going to be that lag issue otherwise and some games won't work period
8641000	8670920	some games will some games won't it's getting better but it's not 100% so my problem also too is like aside from like Titanfall you know some of these other games that have said oh we need the cloud for X and you know Y reasons like Sim City and then you find out oh no they really didn't need that that's just an excuse so that you could be connected online and like another form of DRM and that's like and then when you break trust like that like gamers are gonna think you're full of shit for years to come that takes a long time to erase you know
8671000	8690200	yeah so anyhow also Martin continues saying I'm from Belgium boobies are not that big a deal here but they are still awesome I want to say we talked about this in last week's episode I don't remember what the frickin topic was but we mentioned how nudity is not a big deal in other countries but here it's like oh my god you can't show that on television
8690200	8705240	Martin also says we have amazing chocolate and I will send you some if you want I know the guys at giantbomb.com get mailed stuff from fans all the time and I think you guys deserve something as well well thank you very much what do they got that we don't got here at Orange Toms Radio
8705240	8735220	bomb money I appreciate that I appreciate well soon we'll have we'll have chocolate that'd be awesome access to packs yeah fuck you you are such a little shit alright you know what Bobby gets free reign tonight to just razz every little thing that comes out of your mouth alright Martin continues if you give me an address I will send you some but I understand
8735220	8763460	if you don't want to give your address to random strangers on the internet no problem I'm gonna email you Loki's address alright keep up I don't mind getting random things but then then here's here's my problem is that Nellie will be like somebody sent me chocolate the problem you just have to send boring chocolate if it's fancy chocolate if it's like milk chocolate oh she's in touch in that or white chocolate that might as well be like kryptonite she's like forget it
8764460	8792900	we'll get you an address off air Martin I really really appreciate that that's awesome s 200 Matt suggesting set up a vog p.o. box for all of the candy see like I'm like I'm actually thinking like okay maybe we should just get a little p.o. box like how expensive can it be like even actually vog network has an address but Bobby will get the chocolate if you send it there and I can't have that so I need the chocolate the vog West Office
8792900	8822620	yeah we need a we need a post office box from fog West or something I don't know actually I gotta say this there's been a lot of you guys out there very kind to offer like some folks like can I send you something can I send money which is always like wow like people would actually like pay us to do this stuff I've given thought to the whole like should we do a Kickstarter should we do a patreon type of thing but I have some reservations for one with Kickstarter
8822620	8845500	I don't ever want to give the perception that you need $30,000 to do a podcast because you don't if you have a desire to do it and you're willing to use some secondhand tools and maybe not sound optimal but work towards that as you progress with your new hobby I think you should be able to do that so I just I'm not comfortable with the idea of Kickstarter patreon
8845500	8875460	I'm iffy on it I understand some other shows do it and this is a decision shows have to make for themselves my only concern with something like patreon is a they get a slice of the money when whenever you do something like that and I think there's a lot of pressure in the patreon kind of community to like well if you're donated to this why aren't you donated me as well this as well and this and that but that like a lot of them like well if you donate to us and you get exclusive content and they
8875500	8905340	ever make exactly and I kind of want to just focus on this three-hour show that we're doing so that's why I'm kind of like I don't know how I feel about that and just the fact that you know we do this for fun and we do this you know because you guys show up and participate and send us emails and offer to send us chocolate and things like that like that's that's our motivation like don't get me wrong money would help because we do pay out-of-pocket like you know it does cost money to run the
8905340	8933460	VoG network server but you know what when all is said and done it's about as much money as it is if I were to go join a bowling league or you know something that would be fun for me to do once a week right you know everybody's got their hobby that they pay money for so you know I don't know we're thinking about we're thinking about it we'll see what we come up with in the coming weeks I'm hoping sooner rather than later we will have
8933460	8963420	merchandise available via VoG network.com I don't think I'm like ruining any surprises saying this I mean it's a very logical route to take where we'll have like t-shirts buttons stickers those sorts of things available where you know if you're a fan of the show you can buy those to not only support the show but then you're getting something in return and it's tangible and you have it and you know that's what you're getting and you can use it to help spread the word as we say at the end of every show so that's that's more the
8963420	8990500	idea that I would lean towards right now all right anyhow keep up the great show it's nice to be able to participate all the best and Martin from Belgium clarifying yes it is pronounced more or less like Martin although saying that to Jamie and sadly I'm not Jamie but I'm sure she's happy that you thought of her anyway there it is the mailbag participate at orange laundry.com if you would like to send us an email for a future week
8990500	9001340	let's get to the FUs of the week every week we get a little bit angsty on this show why well because I guess we have anger issues I don't know I don't know what to tell you
9001340	9031220	well if you want to start a few to restaurant store hours I I don't understand what it is about like all these really good restaurants or places that I want to eat at having limited hours on Sundays I mean
9031220	9061100	or even just being close I don't get it like I wanted to get we went to the place yesterday and they make fucking awesome cheese steaks and garlic fries they're literally the best garlic fries I've ever had and I can just eat a ton of them and I wanted to go there but they close at three fucking o'clock and I just can't make it over there in time to get food or Nippon which is a local teriyaki place they close at fucking four o'clock every day I can't
9061100	9076100	stop on my way home from work to get food because they're fucking closed they used to be open to eight o'clock but now they're closed at four for some damn reason and they're not open on Sunday so what the hell people come on people need to eat on Sundays as well
9076100	9106060	all right my a few of the week I'm gonna keep it pretty simple because there's been a lot of good stuff going on so I can't be upset but my a few of the week we go to crisis sees that show up crisis is that show up at four o'clock on a Friday afternoon that shit has to stop on a Friday afternoon I don't need everything burning down OMG WTF BBQ like that is when I'm slipping into weekend mode I don't want to deal with crisis at four o'clock on a Friday can we not have that happen anymore
9106060	9135900	thank you just a couple more news stories for you guys and then we're gonna open up the skype line for your calls 1877 game olr or username on skype orange lounge radio but first Loki so there's a brand new kickstarter for another franchise you may remember and coming from human nature studios toe jamming Earl back in the groove it's a brand new toe jamming Earl game with kind of this they're calling it a retro comic book style
9135900	9162580	yeah retro comic style I don't know they're looking for $400,000 and they were almost reached the halfway point already with 25 days left to go I gotta be honest I don't like the art so I think it's really fucking ugly but whatever it's kind of a cross between like a Saturday morning like
9163580	9192540	comic like a lot of the characters are all 2d but it's like in this 3d environment that really does clashes with everything else and that's just kind of my problem there but a toe jamming Earl so if you're a toe jamming Earl fan maybe you want to you know back that they're gonna have four player co-op it's gonna be on PC Windows Mac and Linux and they're looking at consoles as well one of the cool things about those are gonna lie to kind of chat with each
9192540	9216620	other so you can actually you know type messages whatever you want to each other as you're playing the game I don't know it's interesting I guess if you want to copy the game's gonna cost you 15 bucks and you also get your name in the credits hmm what do you think about a toe
9216620	9246580	jamming Earl reboot the iron was hot on that a long time ago it's his past a lot here's my problem okay and I understand this is probably early in development stuff but I gotta be honest that it just does not look good like I like like if you if you're gonna stick with it do either like the comic book style and leave like the rest alone or like you know do it all the same style or just don't do it at all cuz they like
9246580	9265220	they have all the sprites in our 2d but it's like 2d and like a 3d world so it looks really strange it looks like they're billboard it is what they call it I guess and it's not that doesn't look it looks really weird it looks like a cheap ripoff but but maybe if
9265220	9276260	whatever money they can make something that looks better you know see I I'm all for it I think a cartoon style like all done in that style without the you know kind of shaded background would look fine but
9276820	9290500	I don't know we'll see I hope it ends up working out because I know even though there's you know some well-known franchises that do kick stars and stuff sometimes they ran into problems and I would not like to see this be one of those
9290500	9315300	alright well our last story tonight has to do with a different type of video game and this is one I know I've talked about on OLR before but Alan and I play a game together that Google is kind of the head of one of their side companies Niantic Labs runs a game called Ingress and I noticed Google's been pushing Ingress more and more lately they have like YouTube commercials
9315940	9344980	it's actually like an AR game well sorta I don't know it's a game you play in the real world but it's so it's like GPS but like okay let me you know how there's a park not far from the house right without telling all the listeners where I live yeah that's pretty general there's a park not far from the house right okay so the sign that says welcome to that park is what is known as a portal and so if you're walking around on your iPhone or your Android device obviously because it's a
9345020	9373780	Google game that was on Android first and they brought it over to iOS if I'm in front of that sign or within about a good probably 25 meters from that sign so not a huge distance but close enough I can hack that portal and hacking that portal will give me items which I can then use to build on new portals or destroy portals because there's a player versus player element to this you have the blue team which is the team you don't want to play on the bad people I'm just kidding
9374500	9394060	there's gonna be resistance players listening who are gonna be like shut up and then the gold team no no it's blue and green actually so I play on the green side which is the enlightened there's this whole backstory behind it about how there's exotic matter out there and the enlightened want to use it to progress humanity and so forth but the resistance
9394700	9423220	so how do you hack these portals do you push a button that says hack yes you push a button that says hack but you can also hold the button down and then do a mini game called glyph hacking where you get shown different glyphs and you trace them and you get more stuff think okay you know how like foursquare was supposed to be a fucking game when it came out and it wasn't it's just like oh check into places this is an actual game and I see that judgey look you're giving me right now hold on I'll tell you what people get like really into this game
9423220	9451220	I can see that they people get really into this game and they there's these big events that they will have locally and so I've been able to go to one but they had a huge event here in Sacramento where people are kept coming up from LA and the Bay Area and it just happened to be on a weekend where I was traveling so I couldn't do it but they have these big events and so on you know it is a Google sponsored game but you know people get super into these games and it gets me up and moving Loki that's the important part
9451220	9477220	so like I will actually go down and walk to the park so when some Smurf that's what we call the blue players when some Smurf comes over and decides to stomp the park and be like fuck that shit I'm gonna walk over there and take my shit back so it gets me up and moving and walking so and now and the reason why I bring this up is because the creators of Ingress and Google are actually going to be incorporating this into that's right the Android Wear Watch
9477220	9501220	so the Android Watch will allow you to play Ingress so and they're showing some concept things about this where on the watch if you walk near a portal on the watch you could actually do the hacking of the portal and I'm assuming you could also do some of the attacking I don't that mobile interface is gonna be really weird to use and probably a little slow but the fact that you know you don't even need to whip your phone out you can be very subtle and hacking portals as you go by
9502220	9507220	that's pretty cool there and I know there'll be some local players who are really into that
9508220	9519220	did I mention by the way Loki you can do missions as well that's a new thing they put in the game so like because a lot of the portals are like historic landmarks or places of public interest so people will create missions
9520220	9537220	like one that I did in Seattle was around the Science Center where you know you go to the Space Needle and hack the Space Needle then you go to EMP and hack the EMP and so it like gets you exploring all these places to make sure you've seen everything there like that kind of thing so it's kind of cool I like it
9537220	9546220	okay don't judge me and soon I'll be able to do it from my watch if I were to get an Android watch although I'm not really planning on getting the watch
9547220	9560220	anyway act deft in our chat room says Smurfs and Green Giants actually they call us frogs well we call ourselves frogs and we call the people we call the people leveling we call people leveling tadpoles so there's that
9560220	9574220	Black Wolf in chat says I installed Ingress and joined the green team correct you made the correct choice Rama's also team enlightened Hitstun says oh shit we might need to go turn Boston green wow you all made good choices in the chat room
9574220	9602220	no I know there are olr listeners who are resistance who I'm sure who I am sure are fuming right now let's not forget though at the end of the day if there wasn't an opponent in the game there would be no game to play so get it and part of the reason we joined enlightened here inside well actually I just joined it because it was green but part of the reason we stick with it and don't flip is because green is like really the underdogs here in sac like blue really dominates this town like you go to Folsom
9602220	9622220	it's all fucking blue over there you go to Roseville it's all fucking blue over there and now and I actually kind of like being on the underdog team it's kind of fun so you know even though we never win actually we did win last cycle so it happens what okay go to what go to spot and push button
9622220	9651820	whoo you are in the back of the plan man whoo push the button trace the line whoo it's odd it sounds so amazing to some stupid shit too don't even fucking sit here judge my life choices Loki I just okay it's such a dick I just don't all right call in and tell Loki he's a dick one eight seven seven game olr or a username on Skype is orange
9651820	9681320	lounge radio if you want to give us a call we can talk about ingress or you talk about anything else we can talk about any of the other stories we've talked about on the show so far tonight or perhaps we missed something that you want to talk about we can do all that right now on our Skype line one eight seven seven game olr or username on Skype orange lounge radio that's all one word Loki I don't know if you have any last minute stories I was just gonna say that looks like they've decided to ban some of the costumes from
9681820	9711140	dead or alive five for fighting game tournaments because they're too risque would you have a call coming in so let's get to it hello you're on orange lounge radio who's this hey this act-def hey act-def how you doing hey pretty fun pretty fine despite the rain oh is it raining where you are yeah pretty that's pretty much all day it was supposed to rain here but it kind of didn't for whatever reason it's a little bit disappointing so hold on I'll show Loki something okay Loki see
9711140	9739140	there's my anger scanner and see right now some jerk Smurf drew a field over the house I didn't even talk about that you link portals together and the goals to draw triangles or field and the more population that you control in the field is basically like how the scoring works so some jerk Smurf drew a field right over the house so you can see we're sitting in a yucky pool of potty water right now which the blue there but over here this is some of the stuff that Alan and I did over here at the park we made a little green field cute huh
9741140	9761140	yes I'm not even getting paid by Google to pimp this shit see if I do this anymore we're not you know I wasn't to ingress once and I played it a bit a little but I can easily see Loki getting into it no really unfortunately you're wrong I can't get into because my phone
9761140	9782020	wouldn't probably it does murder your phone is a piece of shit I mean like a 2.3 genderbread so it yeah any phone can run it you know what Loki would probably sign up for ingress and he would do the exact same dick thing that Shane did and that is sign up for the blue team because he knows I'm
9782020	9807020	on he'd be like oh you told me that the blue guys are the winners in this town I'm signing up with them fuck y'all all right anyway sorry I didn't mean to derail but now I would not do that because that's it's no it's just I know I know all right anyway what did you want to talk about that well things to talk about
9807020	9830020	there's the amiibo thing there's also the there was another thing I wanted to talk about but but mostly the one of the forum threads you read about at the beginning of part B the Metacritic thing yes about the topic that Flacco had started about what game did you love that all the critics were like eh
9831020	9856020	yeah basically and it's not necessarily that I that I have some games that critics dashed and I love it's more like the general public that that they go for a score basically and and it's if it's not above 80 they'll pretty much dismiss it and it's really really sad especially
9856020	9885020	when sites go well when they rate their games from one to 10 no it's a 70 should be a good game not not even on decent level it should be a good game you know what I actually like I really agree with you on this and this is why you're actually seeing a lot of pushback on a lot of these review sites and now you have you know joystick before they closed came out and said we're not going to do scores anymore because we don't want to contribute to that kind of culture essentially I mean their their explanation was a lot longer but Eurogamer
9886020	9902020	which is historically been very harsh and a lot of their game reviews and and goes against the grain a lot of the times they have now removed scores from their reviews as well and so you see a lot of sites that kind of don't want to be associated with that Metacritic culture and that that number it's just a number at the end of the day right
9902020	9931020	um we have vog network we decided to go with letter grades because we felt it spoke a language where C meant average middle of the pack meant average right whereas what you're saying is is absolutely right why we didn't go with a number system at vog 5 out of 10 people aren't going to see that as average they're going to see it as bad so we wanted a system where the middle was average so that's why we ultimately went with letter grades over at vog network but then Metacritic for example I gave Pokemon shuffle which I reviewed this week at vog network
9932020	9952020	dot com I gave that a C minus I believe Metacritic would just turn that into a 70 for me you know what I mean yeah whereas I'm kind of like well wait a minute a C's really a 50 but because you know what I mean it's like it's not read that way so it's just it's weird
9952020	9976020	yeah it's definitely weird and especially speaking of Pokemon shuffle and and I gave a review of response for it I noticed that and I pretty much agreed on most of it but it's not a bad game it's it's it has its flaws and it's not definitely a great game to play but it's good it's a great pass time to pass the time
9977020	9988020	that's where I was kind of out with it is that I have my big time problems with it but you know what for the time that you can play it free it's a it's a cute little time waster so I kind of placed it near the middle of the pack because that's how I felt about it you know
9988020	10017020	yeah the grade that was given by you and by me also it's pretty much an average score so it's it's around the middle it's not that bad it's not great but it's decent definitely and there are a lot of games like that that they're not they're not bad I consider a bad game a game that it's not playable that it's difficult and you cannot progress basically
10018020	10047020	so I those are the things I consider for a bad game a really bad game yeah there are there are bad games in the sense that okay that it has its bugs it has things that pretty much do interfere with the game right by well I can give the example of like this is great unity that it can flood but the game was at least somewhat playable and it probably was good for the most of it
10049020	10071020	one other thing I wanted to say about Metacritic is that I notice a lot of like publishers tie bonuses to Metacritic scores we've heard about that happening in the industry and I think that's kind of I mean like exactly what you're talking about where it's like you know 80 is that hard line where it's like that could be the difference between you get a Christmas bonus and you don't get a Christmas bonus and that's so sketchy to me you know what I mean
10072020	10086020	yeah definitely it's it's definitely a big problem and with all the industry that yeah you have to pretty much do that to to progress and well you know
10087020	10102020	well any other thoughts on your mind before we let you go tonight another thought yeah amiibos are good what what drive well let me ask you quickly if you can summarize quickly what drives you to collect amiibos what are Loki and I missing from this amiibo craze
10103020	10125020	I could really try to explain it but I collect them because I like them they look great I even despite the not so great functionality they have outside Smash Brothers I still like to collect them they're pretty cool figurines but if you don't
10125020	10154020	well in my perspective I'm a big collector I have talked about my collection of like Pokemon my Final Fantasy stuff my music and all that stuff but that's because I am a collector if you're not a collector you probably won't get it so that's pretty much it I'm collecting because for the sake of collecting there are even people that don't take the amiibo out of the box they collect them they have all the 29
10155020	10184020	amiibo so far that have been released and all in the box they do not use them so yeah it's pretty much for the sake of collecting and I'm pretty much on that boat too fair enough fair enough well I'm gonna let you go act F because our phones are like lighting up on fire so I gotta get to another call but take care okay hey thanks for having me hey thank you take care we have a lot of calls coming in tonight so let me try to get to another one here right now hi you're an orange launch radio who's this I'm calling to defend myself
10185020	10213020	hi Shane welcome to the show where your ears burning no I heard you slander me what call what did I say in particular I mean I slander you a lot so what was it in particular that you took offense to that I joined the blue team on that dumb game because you joined the green first of all you know me and everybody else does it's blue that is what I'm gonna pick secondly it's just a bonus that it screws you over
10215020	10244020	you didn't even I a I might I point out I didn't even know that you downloaded ingress until I was driving by like one of the local portals one day and I was like wait a minute Shane a link goes on this portal is the enemy that little bastard pretty much where the game is crappy anyway like it is really dumb and not fun so so you're on you're on team Loki with that one oh yeah yeah totally that is just like a really stupid game
10246020	10273020	you're both wrong but that's every gamer has a voice even when they're wrong it's fine you know what and I'm not one to judge since I haven't played it but based on that plane I think it looks really dumb maybe it'd be more fun if when you did the hacking stuff you went beep boop bop beep that's the only way I could see it being more I will do that sometime or maybe if it worked with a Power Rangers toy or something oh yeah then I'd be all for it what if it was just called Power Ranger portal game I would play the crap out of it
10274020	10302020	you have very easy to like you know get my attention grabbed by something stupid and then that's all I'll focus on all right well there you have it you've defended yourself here on the show was there anything else that we've talked about that you wanted to that you took issue with I wasn't listening that much that I could comment on anything else or anything else that you talked about trying playing Final Fantasy right now too no I I wanted to give a shout out to that
10302020	10331020	crappy that's actually a good dating sim though that any person should play if they I guess have the money to buy it or just randomly download it at some point and find it on their computer like I did and what game is that that's coming out on top it's a dating sin that's kind of horny but come on if you have a computer you seem porn so it's not that big a deal and actually I think it kind of detracts from the game but it's really like funny and well written and it was written by a woman and it's all about
10332020	10361020	gay guys so that was interesting to me why and what what what kind of sets it apart from maybe other I don't know I don't know if you've played a lot of dating since I've never except I heard people kind of consider persona one but I don't see that me because I didn't date anybody in person before but I don't know it doesn't have pigeons or whatever so it's not like that other dating sin but I like that what is it about like it just has good gameplay or the story
10361020	10390020	I think the writing is just like point and click and choose this choice and manage your event calendar type thing I just thought it was pretty funny like I didn't know that those games would be funny they're like super serious and people would like I don't know fantasize about the characters and make pillows out of them or something maybe they do I don't know I think they do this game I think has a bit of a fan following I think it was all through a Kickstarter campaign
10391020	10420020	I want to say I remember when it was a Kickstarter campaign oh well I don't know I know it's getting DLC which is weird but mmm I people should play it if they have an interest in that sort of stuff I guess people want more of a variety and in what porny scenes they can end up in well that's that's the weird part of the game like I don't necessarily condone that part it's very awkwardly placed sometimes like oh you had a crush on this guy forever and he liked you too
10421020	10448020	now he's tied up to bed and you have to pick how you're gonna have sex with him it's like you could ride him or you could get inside him or you can you can get make him give you a blowjob or you can get okay Shane I think we've heard enough about this then you don't have to finish you can pick the other options you can choose to finish or go back to the other ones that you didn't pick yet and go through those ones too
10448020	10463020	oh my god all right well I've heard plenty enough about this game and I will certainly check it out because there's more it's like financing you can do bukkake you know what look at the time we gotta let you go and our phone lines are lighting up but have a good one Shane okay bye bye
10463020	10492780	alright he just he just wanted to dirty up the show all right well we got another person on the line so let's get to it like Rama says in the chatroom over at live.com well okay accurate right all right hi you're on orange launch radio who's this yeah what's up this guy you know hey guys you know what's on your mind not much first before I get into I just want to recommend to games for it to you yeah but before I get into that I just want to say that I'm also
10492780	10522700	an amiibo collector but I'm not because they look great I actually don't think they're a good-looking whatever you want to call them action figure toy whatever I have Kirby there's some little distortion in the back it looks like it kind of looks like you know when you were when you were a kid and you put the quarter into the machine you get those little eggs that you got to twist off and pop them open to get the prize that's what Kirby looks like is it really cheaply made you know everybody knows about how every character that has a sword the sword is all bent up and
10522780	10552700	screwed up and um a lot of them don't have a lot of really great detail in them that's why they're $12.99 you know but um I basically collect them because I play Smash Brothers and um I get a lot of fun out of my amiibo with Smash Brothers I don't know what they're gonna do later I'm not really into just putting my amiibo onto my controller just so I could get an outfit or something like that I think that's stupid but um as far as what they do for Smash Brothers it's a lot of fun and I'm hoping that when Mario Party comes out they're gonna do something similar to what they do with
10552940	10582620	Smash Brothers maybe not train them but I know one of the big uh one of the big problems for people with Mario Party is uh Mario Party was never online right I never played any of the Mario Party games but they're they're not online connected right I don't think so I gotta I'm not really having to rack my brain here and I think I think the main problem was you know it's a Mario Party so you know it's one of those games where you know it depends on a group of people playing and I think a lot of people since uh you know um they don't
10582620	10607100	have a lot of people over because you know not everyone's in the video games it's really hard to get uh you know your friends into video games um I think that's one of the main reasons why people kind of maybe didn't buy the game or kind of hesitated on buying the game just for the simple fact that they didn't have that party over at their house so maybe these amiibos are going to replace that and you actually have like uh some decent AI to play with when you play Mario Party
10607100	10621100	um I understood the amiibo is unlocked to seek a special mode in Mario Party that you can only get like if you have the amiibo so that's what people are I guess uh at least probably going to get that bundle that has Mario in it for so
10621100	10651020	in the gold mario there's a um there's a gold mario in mario golf so that's where the gold guy came from but anyway I wanted to recommend um I I can't believe I'm recommending this because I hate I don't really like app games I don't like the pay to play type games I don't like platformers this game has everything in it that I hate but for some reason I love it and that game is uh king of thieves I think it's only exclusive to the android devices right now okay but it's a lot of fun like it's uh it's a combination
10651020	10680620	of uh super meat boy meets uh you remember that game uh n plus you ever played that yeah yeah yeah it has a little bit of n plus in it's on tower defense it's really cool like you start out as like this little thief character and um you have to infiltrate uh dungeons to steal people's gold and the people's gold that you're stealing are actually real players who are also playing the game and they can also break into your dungeon and steal your gold that's when you have to set up your traps was what's really cool about the game is the fact that um
10681020	10710940	you can't just uh you know you would think that if somebody has to set up a trap they're gonna set up like this impossible trap for you to get through the game doesn't allow you to create that trap unless you're able to beat the dungeon yourself so you actually have to beat your dungeon two times in a row before you're able to save it and allow someone else to play it which I think is like one of the best features what's this called again uh king of thieves hmm it's a lot of fun it's made by the uh people that may cut the rope but it's totally different from cut the rope because I can't stand cut the rope um but yeah it's a totally different game
10711100	10740700	from that and I mean there's just there's so much more to it but I know you only have a little bit of time so I'm not gonna get into all that but but I will try again it is on iOS I just uh grabbed it yeah it is great man and you can you can start guilds like when you get to a certain level you can have like guilds and you can have your uh friends help you to steal your shit back when somebody rips you off because like you know a lot of people will start getting in your shit and like stealing everything and then you got to get it back from them it's a lot of fun second game is uh the town of Salem that's like a
10740700	10746220	web browser game and you're talking about um the resistance earlier that's like one of my favorite
10746220	10752780	card games and I love the werewolf card game yeah and um uh town of Salem is just like that it's
10752780	10757980	basically uh before we had werewolf werewolf is a game that's based off of another game called
10757980	10764540	mafia yeah I know mafia yep yeah so um the town of Salem is basically mafia like there's a mafia team
10764540	10769020	in the game I think there's actually a werewolf at some point in the game but I don't think I play
10769020	10774620	with the rules say that but um mafia and werewolf combined yeah yeah yeah it's mafia werewolf the
10774620	10779500	sailing were trials all that stuff combined into one game there's a serial killer in there it's
10779500	10783580	just a lot of fun it's like you know one of those social production games you just have to find out
10783580	10787900	who's going around killing everyone and you know you get your special role like uh there's a spy
10787900	10794220	role a detective role uh doctor role it's just a lot of fun it's a simple web browser game
10794860	10798860	and uh you I think I think the longest I ever played was like 15 minutes so it's not one of
10798860	10805580	those games that you really have to invest a lot of time in and you know just uh a lot of fun too
10805580	10811740	two fun games and they're completely free uh I will say uh the resistance is a lot of fun but uh
10811740	10815500	since you've played it a lot uh what's your strategy when you're a spy how do you how do
10815500	10820860	you throw people off your trail oh I just uh pretty much what I try to do I try to uh
10820940	10826620	do all my damage when I'm the the team captain you know I try to go for that and then I then I
10826620	10831260	start to try to put you know like you don't you don't put your spy mates on the team right away
10831260	10835420	like the the first mission that you do like when have you ever become the team leader
10835420	10839980	you send all the good people on the mission yeah let them succeed and then they're gonna trust you
10839980	10845100	and then by the next time you get around or if they get around to somebody else on your team
10845100	10848220	that person will like select you and you know they'll trust you more and they'll put you on
10848220	10853100	the team and that's when you can sabotage stuff you know how I won the first game is I got put
10853100	10858460	on the very first mission and I let it succeed and I got put on the second mission as well because of
10858460	10863740	that and I let that succeed as well and I could see the other spy was looking at me going like
10863740	10869020	you just gave them two and they only need three to win and I was like you know I got this I got this
10869020	10872460	sure enough they put me on every single other mission in the game and I failed them all
10872460	10881180	yeah yeah that was a lot of fun thank you it's also uh you mentioned werewolf but uh um to me
10881180	10886300	it's more of like a streamlined uh version of uh the battle star galactic game you gotta try that
10886300	10891180	I mean that's a heavy duty board game but um if you ever meet anyone that has that game you gotta
10891180	10896780	try but I mean it it literally takes like two hours to finish that game but um time yeah just
10896780	10901180	fun stuff all right board games are fun try them they are fun guys you know I'm gonna let you go
10901180	10905500	so we can wrap up the show but thanks for your call buddy no problem take care all right I think

11042220	11047820	i hope you guys going to gdc have a fantastic time that is also this week as well uh so i'm
11047820	11051900	sure there's going to be lots of news to talk about in two weeks we are back on march 15th
11051900	11055340	time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts uh dark soccer has already left we
11055340	11058460	talked to her earlier loki it's your turn what's your final thought for the night
11058460	11065100	uh we're more of a game this week um i know last week i meant to get some levels done but my i've
11065100	11070860	been mainly working on because one of the things i hated was that um the curves are hard to get up
11070860	11075180	on a game because the car is really small um so i've been putting these what i'm calling
11075180	11079740	curb ramps in the game so now everything all the curves are kind of have a 45 degree slope on it
11079740	11084460	so you just you just drive right into them and it goes it makes it a lot more fun so that's what
11084460	11088940	i've been working on i'm just about done with it i have them all in the game except that the model
11088940	11094860	two more that are for some really like um unique pieces and then and then i had to figure out what
11094860	11098700	level two is going to be i i've been trying to come up with some ideas but i have a bunch of
11098700	11105260	ideas that aren't good for level two but later on it's just i had to get the right one that's the
11105260	11111980	least amount of crazy before i get into the crazy stuff so um it's just hard picking one that's
11111980	11118300	simple enough for the first real stage that you play all right and my final thought for the night
11118300	11122620	is uh sj100 matt reminded me of this so i'll say this is my final thought there is a packs east
11122620	11127420	thread on our forums uh so if you want to uh try to meet up with us uh post in the thread and that
11127420	11133580	you're going that's over at forums.vognetwork.com uh if you want to uh meet up at packs east um so
