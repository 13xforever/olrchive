0	17400	This week, music gaming is bustled with news of an arcade upstart, giving waiting players
17400	20840	something to do, and the return of Rock Band coming to most of this generation's consoles
20840	21840	and more.
21840	25040	Join us for this, stories from PAX, as well as your comments, calls and more right now
25040	31560	on the show where every gamer has a voice.
31560	34960	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
34960	36480	where every gamer has a voice.
36480	46980	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with this episode 590 for Sunday, March 15th of 2015.
46980	52680	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me live in studio is Techmaster Loki.
52680	53680	How are you doing, Loki?
53680	54680	I'm doing okay.
54680	55840	I bought too much pizza.
55840	57640	But you brought a lot of pizza.
57640	59240	You actually had to unload pizza on me.
59240	60240	It doesn't always happen.
60240	67000	But it's Little Caesars and five bucks for a large pizza, so it's like, eh, why not?
67000	69200	Is there such a thing as too much pizza?
69200	70200	Almost.
70200	71720	I don't think they had them.
71720	75160	You know they have those hot and ready pizzas, so you just go ahead and pay money and they
75160	78940	just throw you a pizza instead of having to wait for them to cook it.
78940	83680	I don't know if they have those bacon-wrapped pizzas because they have their new, was it
83680	86600	bacon crust?
86600	90280	There might actually be a thing as too much bacon and that pizza sounds like it.
90280	91440	It's just wrapped in bacon.
91440	95600	I think it's just too much hype, to be honest, but I was going to try that.
95600	96600	Wait, food?
96600	97760	Too much hype?
97760	98760	In fast food?
98760	104360	I didn't actually want pizza, to be honest, but my first choice, despite their website
104360	109300	and their door hours saying that they should be open, they were closed, and so I had to
109300	110300	improvise.
110300	114100	Alright, it wouldn't be an episode of Orange Lounge Radio if we didn't talk about food
114100	117900	at the top of the show, but believe it or not, it is a show about video games.
117900	119980	But I do have to mention something on a serious note.
119980	123860	You'll notice I did not introduce Dark Sakura in the introductions tonight.
123860	124860	She's fine.
124860	127060	She'll be back on the show next week.
127060	131060	I had to ask her if I could get permission to share this because she did have a bit of
131060	134620	a personal crisis this week and I did get permission to share with you all what's going
134620	136420	on with Dark Sakura.
136420	142020	Dark Sakura was mentioned previously on the program about her upbringing in Mobile and
142020	146460	she shared a lot of stories with us about her family and so forth, and one of the people
146460	150700	I know that was very close to her in her upbringing that she talks about a lot on the show is
150700	153940	her grandma.
153940	159620	She's spoken very fondly about her grandma and has mentioned some medical issues that
159620	163700	her grandma was facing over the past few weeks here on the program.
163700	167660	Unfortunately last week, Dark Sakura's grandma did pass away.
167660	171740	So she had to go to Alabama at the drop of a hat to go be with her family.
171740	177260	So she left town, I think, on Thursday or Friday night and she won't be back until Thursday.
177260	181180	So I just want to pass that along to all you guys.
181180	183740	I know here at Orange and Ontario, we've been going for so long.
183740	189220	There's so many of you that show up week after week and support us, not just for the laughs,
189220	192980	but for all the things that we go personally deal with in our lives as well.
192980	196360	And if you have a minute to let Dark Sakura know you're sending some hugs, I know she
196360	197860	would really, really appreciate it.
197860	201880	So I just want to let you all know that's what was going on with Dark Sakura and she's
201880	206580	a Mobile, but she will be back on the show next week and we will move on with the show
206580	209260	as we always do.
209260	214300	That all being said, let's try to get into some video games and gaming, of course with
214300	219380	you guys live in the chat room as you are every week with us at live.vognetwork.com
219380	223660	where we do tape live at the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, every Sunday
223660	229380	night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, which
229380	233340	we actually did some announcements in between the show tonight, but I will get back to that
233340	235020	in a little bit.
235020	238020	First off tonight, after welcoming all you guys in chat, and thank you, I see a lot of
238020	242580	kind words for Jamie's grandmother in chat, I will pass that along to her.
242580	246500	But those of you that follow her on Tumblr, Twitter, or even Facebook, I know she's got
246500	250340	a Facebook page, you might want to stop by there if you have a chance because I don't
250340	253980	think she'll be in the chat tonight considering they're three hours ahead and her schedule
253980	257900	is adjusted a little bit with her family, she's going to bed a little earlier when she's
257900	259900	out there.
259900	264300	Anyhow, let's bring the focus back to games a little bit.
264300	268420	We were not here last week because I was at PAX.
268420	273980	I went to Penny Arcade Expo, PAX East, which is the first time I've been to the show in
273980	275740	probably five years.
275740	277860	I went to the very first PAX East.
277860	282820	We all went to PAX, myself, Loki, and Dark Sakura all went to PAX in 2008.
282820	286700	That was a fun year because we actually got to broadcast live from the show floor, right?
286700	287700	That was fun.
287700	288700	That was a lot of fun.
288700	292460	And then 2010, we got to go to the show and had a lot of fun.
292460	299900	And this year, I went to the show as well, but it was a tough show this year.
299900	303140	The good news is, loved getting to see people.
303140	307620	Loved getting to see people I hardly ever get to see, but maybe once every five years
307620	309340	at these sorts of things.
309340	313020	The gals from Electric Sistahood, which shout out to their show because they had Bobby and
313020	319820	I on their show during PAX East, which we got to tape out in one of the hallways connecting
319820	320980	some of the rooms.
320980	322500	So that was really cool.
322500	325900	And just getting to meet up with some listeners and people that I know have been listening
325900	326900	to the show for a very long time.
326900	329220	I thought that was really cool.
329220	333420	But I got to say, there's a lot of frustrations as well that I've kind of been going through
333420	334940	with PAX East.
334940	341340	The fact that the show is very crowded and there was a line for everything did not exactly
341340	342900	help the situation.
342900	343900	And I get it.
343900	345580	Yeah, it's a big con.
345580	347180	It's a huge thing that happens.
347180	352020	But I mean, you would have these huge four-hour lines, I'm not even kidding, four-hour line
352020	354180	to do the Oculus Rift.
354180	355180	And they kept the line.
355180	358840	So it's like, you can't even really stand around to get in the line.
358840	363160	You have to kind of walk around the booth and maybe when you come back, you'll happen
363160	366800	to catch that 60-second window where you can jump in the line.
366800	369320	Bobby and I got to do this with Final Fantasy XIV.
369320	370320	We lucked out.
370320	374080	The line was capped, but we had actually turned around to go look at something else real quick.
374080	376600	And then we noticed that the guy wasn't standing there.
376600	379900	So we jumped in the line and immediately that Enforcer got back in the line behind us and
379900	380900	capped it again.
380900	385280	So we lucked out getting to do that Final Fantasy XIV thing where all I wanted was the
385280	386280	t-shirt.
386280	389520	All I wanted was the t-shirt that says, I beat Shiva.
389520	392420	So phew, we got the shirt and I didn't have to worry about that anymore, but that was
392420	396400	an hour wait just to play a game that I've already played online.
396400	402220	But I think part of the problem that a lot of the demos on the show floor are having
402220	407240	is that either A, they don't bring enough of it or B, the demos are a bit long.
407240	411180	I think a lot of companies are bringing demos that might be a bit long and it's not really
411180	413720	moving things along very quickly.
413720	417840	I will give a shout out to Harmonix though, the Amplitude demo, they kept people moving
417840	418840	pretty good.
418840	422120	And that was one of the better demos I actually played at the show was the Amplitude demo,
422120	424360	which I love me some music games, right?
424360	428520	So I got to play the Amplitude demo and that was a lot of fun and they can move four players
428520	434160	through every two minutes and that's a really good ratio compared to some of the boosts.
434160	438520	I will say though, to Paxi's credit, there really was a focus on indie this year and
438520	441880	that's always exciting to see and especially when the indie games themselves are getting
441880	444960	a huge line of people to play even those games.
444960	450120	I think we stood around for about 20, 30 minutes to play a game called Thumper, again because
450120	452120	it was kind of a game that had a really long demo.
452120	458440	It was by some former Harmonix devs, but I enjoyed the game and it was worth the wait
458440	460720	so I don't have anything negative to say about that.
460720	467720	But there was a lot of love for indie, although this could also be the fact that because GDC
467720	476760	was going on the exact same week that we could not get more of a AAA presence at Penny
476760	477760	Arcade Expo.
477760	483560	I sort of like the shows where it's like a little of the AAA's, a little of the like
483560	485880	A- and the Bs, and a little of the indies.
485880	494200	It's a great harmonious mix of all of them and Pax East, Pax East I think was missing
494200	497960	probably a few key players, probably because of the GDC thing.
497960	504360	Now they've moved it out a month next year, which Pax East really needs to do.
504360	508460	The snow thing and the weather, you know, I'm a West Coast guy and I get that a lot
508460	513040	of you think I'm a big wimp and so forth, but that was pretty brutal, some of the weather
513040	514960	while I was out there.
514960	519480	And it doesn't really help for the travel, getting around, just all the snow on the side
519480	523000	of the road and look out where you're walking because you might slip and fall in a puddle.
523040	527240	So they're moving it back a month next year, probably to get out of GDC's way and so that
527240	530680	snowmageddon can't happen to them again, which is good.
530680	533600	Really good because yeah, the weather doesn't help that situation.
533600	538240	And another thing that I have to admit kind of bothered me about Pax East and apologies
538240	543440	to my friends who are out there in the Northeast and who live in Boston, but that convention
543440	549860	center where they host Pax East at, man, that thing is a pain in the butt to get to travel-wise.
549860	554000	And especially considering that Boston is a city that doesn't really have the greatest
554000	559580	traffic to begin with, with all its streets that weren't really built for cars, right?
559580	560980	It already is a mess to begin with.
560980	566140	I mean, when you're waiting on the shuttle for an hour to get from your hotel to Pax,
566140	569900	which honestly we probably should have just walked faster, but we didn't think it would
569900	572140	be such a huge mess.
572140	576420	I mean, it just kind of says something about what a cluster that whole thing was out there.
576420	579980	So I actually liked it better when it was at the Heinz the first year that I went, even
579980	583740	though I realized it was a smaller show.
583740	588200	Here's the other thing that kind of, just to give you an idea where my mindset is at
588200	589860	with Pax.
589860	594220	I'm going to spill the tea on a little something and I'm going to be very honest and open about
594220	598860	something that frustrated me greatly and I know frustrated Bobby greatly.
598860	603160	And we've been dropping hints about this a little bit, but I'm going to tell you exactly
603160	608960	what went down with Pax East and why we've been a little bit frustrated and the fact
608960	614320	that the show was kind of a mess, for lack of a better term, doesn't exactly instill
614320	618980	confidence that I want to go back next year.
618980	624040	We were contacted about four months ago, Bobby and myself, to reprise a panel that we had
624040	629940	done at Dragon Con on starting a network with some other independent broadcasters.
629940	635600	So the point of this was to try and reprise this panel at Pax East, that this group was
635600	638980	going to submit to actually do this panel at Pax East.
638980	640060	Of course we were on board.
640060	641620	It sounded very exciting.
641620	646500	We love to enable more people to do independent broadcasting and start their own network and
646500	647500	so on.
647500	649820	So we said, sure, we'll do the panel.
649820	656140	And Bobby and I were talking a little bit off this email conversation and, well, what
656140	657780	if they don't pick up the panel?
657780	661900	Because we don't have any, and I'm using my quotey fingers here, star power on this
661900	662900	panel.
662900	668600	So the realization is the odds are that the panel will get picked up is pretty low.
668600	673700	But then we realized, well, okay, if we don't get into the show with this panel, then we
673700	677700	can certainly get in as media because we broadcast from the show floor in 2008.
677700	678700	We had that.
678700	682140	We did our thing in 2010 and had fun at the show there.
682140	686980	So we know that other podcasters that have got in as media and it's not a problem.
686980	688820	We won't have a problem with that.
688820	693100	So I booked my flight to Boston, Bobby got the hotel, and we're all ready to do Pax East.
693100	697820	And of course, this is long after the general admission tickets had already sold out because
697820	701820	you know, Pax sells out in 15 minutes, right?
701820	707540	So Bobby and I find out that we didn't get the panel, which we kind of saw that coming
707540	708540	unfortunately.
708540	709540	We would love to do it again.
709540	710540	But all right, it is what it is.
710540	715840	They want to focus on these big AAA developers hosting their panels, even ones that don't
715840	719260	have a booth on the show floor, at least they're showing up to do a panel so they give
719260	722600	this panel space to these AAA developers, whatever, fine.
722600	728960	So we decide to apply as media and we send them everything that they requested and we
728960	733720	get a form letter denial that we do not meet the criteria to get in as media.
733720	737200	What's interesting about this, Bobby and I submit our credentials together.
737200	742760	Bobby gets the denial for media and then I get at the exact same time, even though my
742760	748120	information was on page two, I get the exact same time, please submit your credentials.
748120	753320	So I send them the exact same thing that had been sent before a week later, get denied.
753320	759160	Both Bobby and I independently write to this email box to say, could we get more insight
759160	761480	as to why we were denied?
761480	763640	We meet the criteria.
763640	768080	We're fortunate enough that, you know, if you look at Stitcher Top 100, we're one of
768080	772640	the podcasts in there, very competitive with some offerings from like IGN and so forth.
772640	773640	And that's all thanks to you guys.
773640	774640	Thank you so much.
774640	780160	But, you know, we feel like we have enough of a listenership to kind of justify that
780160	784880	sort of access and keep this in mind because I don't want you guys to think, oh, this is
784880	791220	Rob just bitching that, you know, he's on a podcast and podcasts aren't media anyway,
791220	793800	because here's the other side to this.
793800	799460	We have peers that we know are getting into the show as media and we know other people
799460	803500	that have comparable listener bases and comparable, you know, stuff to us that are getting in
803500	804500	as media.
804500	807900	So we figure, well, if they're all getting in, then we shouldn't have a problem either.
807900	812420	We'll just pick up the phone and call them like we do with E3 and explain it and that
812420	815700	won't be a problem because that's exactly what happened with E3 last year.
815700	822000	Unfortunately, no telephone number, no response to our email, nothing.
822000	823780	We're not given a reason.
823780	825600	We're not given an explanation.
825600	827620	We're not given a chance to appeal.
827620	831660	We're not given a live person to contact for this.
831660	835980	Meanwhile, again, we talked to other podcasters.
835980	838860	We know our peers are getting in.
838860	841420	Our peers are getting emails answered.
841420	848220	Our peers are finding a way to, I guess, get a live human being to respond to something.
848220	851700	Again, Bobby and I had contacted independently.
851700	852700	Are we being ignored?
852700	855980	Yo, Pax, did I hurt your feelings?
855980	856980	It would be nice to know.
857340	859900	I mean, tell me, let's have a chat over coffee.
859900	861820	Let's see if we can hug it out a little bit.
861820	868460	I'd like to know because when you don't answer emails and you don't provide customer service,
868460	870460	that comes off as unprofessional.
870460	874360	Again, I want to reiterate this.
874360	876020	This is very important.
876020	878900	I am not complaining that I didn't get a media pass.
878900	885620	I am totally fine with that if the rules are consistent.
885620	891420	I believe I've presented enough examples here where I'm showing that it was not consistent.
891420	895640	That's what frustrates me greatly is that it was not consistent.
895640	900980	We weren't even given the cordial reply of, if they had replied back and said, sorry,
900980	903920	we were looking for X, you have Y, then you know what?
903920	906500	As long as I had my chance to kind of make my case and so forth that they were going
906500	908940	to stick with it, then fine, it is what it is.
908940	915380	Even though this is the same show where we were broadcasting from the show floor in 2008,
915380	916900	apparently it was media then.
916900	922180	With a much smaller listenership at that time, I'm assuming as well.
922180	923580	Right?
923580	928980	So anyway, that left a sour taste in my mouth, which you probably could tell over the past
928980	930500	couple of weeks in the show.
930500	931500	But you know what?
931500	932500	Damn it.
932500	936220	I knew there were people that were going to the show that I wanted to see, and one of
936220	940700	our listeners, Hitstun Awesome, came through for us because I was getting ready to cancel
940700	941700	the flight.
941700	942700	And he said, you know what?
942700	946660	I have these extra passes and I'm more than happy to sell them to you at face value and
946660	947780	you can go to the show.
947780	952680	I wouldn't play in that scalping game, but our listeners are good enough to not be scalpers.
952680	957300	So I decided, you know what, fine, I will pay the money to get these tickets and I'll
957300	958300	go to the show.
958300	960900	I flew out there on my own dollar and all this stuff.
960900	962780	You know, it is an independent pilot.
962780	970180	There's no first class jet or expense, you know, it's my money I used to fly out there
970180	975580	and I'm telling you, I don't see a reason ever again to spend that kind of money to
975580	977500	go to a show like that.
977500	981540	The lone exception being that I could see my friends again.
981540	986700	However, I have a pretty good suspicion that if I go to some different cons out on the
986700	990900	East Coast, such as Dragon Con, which I will continue to support.
990900	995020	Dragon Con is kind of its own thing because Dragon Con isn't an expo so much as it is
995020	999180	a convention and it's like 20 small conventions all taking place at the same time.
999180	1002420	And Dragon Con replies to their emails, so that's one thing.
1002420	1004500	You know, I'll continue to do stuff with that.
1004500	1006700	I'm very interested in doing MAGFest next year.
1006700	1010260	I love the Rockage event out here on the West Coast, so I'm looking forward very much to
1010260	1011540	doing MAGFest on the East Coast.
1011540	1015700	I want to do that next time and I think I'll get to see a lot of the OLR and VOG people
1015700	1016700	out there, so that's fine.
1016700	1020180	But as far as PAX goes, kind of done.
1020180	1024720	And I just, again, while we're spilling tea, can I just say one more thing here?
1024720	1030000	There's a lot of perception out there that, well, what does that media access get you,
1030000	1031160	Rob Roberts?
1031160	1033240	Why do you even care about the media access?
1033240	1038220	Because PAX is the show where media is treated no differently than the general public, save
1038220	1041960	maybe they get to go on the expo floor one hour sooner.
1041960	1043780	Wrong!
1043780	1045840	That is wrong!
1045840	1049000	That changed quietly a few years ago.
1049000	1050000	Y'all didn't notice.
1050000	1051000	Oh, when did that change?
1051000	1056640	Well, about the time that Penny Arcade outsourced that expo to that new vendor who runs it on
1056640	1063480	their behalf and has expanded it into a brand that runs PAX South and now PAX Australia,
1063480	1071160	the brand that cannot be bothered to reply to emails.
1071160	1076360	There are appointments to be made at Boos to see games that are not out on the floor
1076360	1077600	for the general public.
1077600	1081880	There are things being shown in hotel rooms, much like they are at E3, that, again, cannot
1081880	1083520	be seen with the general public.
1083520	1089020	If you think that PAX is this open, I get to see everything there, sorry, that changed
1089020	1090620	a few years ago.
1090620	1094740	But I do think it's still cool that PAX has a lot of board games and card games and bring
1094740	1098120	your own computer and other stuff that kind of mixes it up a little bit.
1098120	1104760	But as far as the bang for my buck, I'm spending it elsewhere in the future.
1104760	1106720	Did you want to ask me anything about PAX East, Loki?
1106720	1109040	Did you get to play Rock Band?
1109040	1110360	No, they didn't bring it.
1110360	1111360	They didn't have it.
1111360	1112360	How's Amplitude?
1112360	1113680	Amplitude was fun.
1113680	1114680	I liked it.
1114680	1115680	It was good.
1115680	1116680	It was a good time.
1116680	1120960	I played a lot of music games because there was Thumper, Kyle Ward was there showing off
1120960	1124960	what he's doing on the Android tablets with DittoBeat and Rerave Plus.
1124960	1126600	He's going to come on the show next month, by the way.
1126600	1127800	I'm very excited to have him.
1127800	1133580	He's a longtime music game community guy, and we got to talk and dish a little bit about
1133620	1137660	some of the things going on, and he is going to absolutely come on the show and promote
1137660	1139020	that stuff in the future.
1139020	1140020	So looking forward to that.
1140020	1141020	Cool.
1141020	1142020	Yep.
1142020	1144540	So anyway, that's my little story about PAX East.
1144540	1148340	Otherwise, there are some other little things that were kind of fun, like I enjoyed going
1148340	1153380	to the classic game room and getting Bobby Blackwolf to play the guardian legend for
1153380	1154380	the first time.
1154380	1155380	That was a lot of fun.
1155380	1160140	And just getting to play Kid Icarus on a Nintendo with an NES controller.
1160140	1163860	I haven't done that in a very long time because I don't have a working Nintendo.
1163860	1168020	So yeah, it was awesome to get to do that all over again.
1168020	1169020	And again, see people.
1169020	1172620	You know, we got to go to dinner one night with a couple people from VoG, and that was
1172620	1173620	really cool.
1173620	1178820	SSG100Matt, whose girlfriend lives out in the area, knows Boston very well, took us
1178820	1182620	out to Harvard, and we went to a brewery over there, and that was a lot of fun.
1182620	1188220	In fact, SSG100Matt is in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com saying, the first PAX
1188220	1189420	East wasn't bad.
1189420	1191980	I still like that more than the previous ones.
1191980	1197060	Me too, I had a great time at the first PAX East, but again, that was before they outsourced
1197060	1200100	it, but anyway.
1200100	1204340	Let's see, over at live.vognetwork.com, YYR says, Magfest will definitely get the bad
1204340	1206060	taste out of your mouth.
1206060	1208460	And SSG100Matt saying, Magfest is where it's at.
1208460	1210460	I can't praise it enough.
1210460	1213300	So yeah, it seems like people are loving that.
1213300	1217220	And Kaijuto saying, Dragon Con has real dragon transportation.
1217220	1222180	Yeah, well Dragon Con's a lot easier to get around because they hold it downtown at all
1222180	1225540	these different hotels, they're all interconnected, and even if they're not, there's a lot of
1225540	1226540	shuttle service.
1226540	1229740	I don't hear about a lot of these same problems at Dragon Con.
1229740	1235380	So Dragon Con will be like the one big show that I do here, but from now on, I totally
1235380	1242820	plan to focus on more like small and mid-level gaming expos, where there's more to do.
1242900	1248300	Just to put this in perspective, I played more games, actual games.
1248300	1254180	I got my hands on more games at Rockage in San Jose, which was one, actually, I was there
1254180	1255220	for only one day.
1255220	1256220	That event was multiple days.
1256220	1260900	I was there for one day and played more games than I did the three days at PAX East.
1260900	1262980	Just food for thought.
1262980	1268060	Anyhow, I'm not just here to bitch and complain, but a lot of you guys have been asking me
1268060	1272460	questions about what's going on, why have you been subtly side-eyeing this whole thing?
1272460	1273460	So there it is.
1273460	1274900	I've laid it all out on the table.
1274900	1276900	Take what you will from it.
1276900	1282900	I will, to turn this into a positive, though, before the show tonight, getting into housekeeping
1282900	1288120	a little bit here as well, before the show tonight, Bobby and I and Loki made some announcements
1288120	1289660	about what's going on with VOG Network.
1289660	1294860	So first off, great news, we'd like to welcome the Geek Card to VOG Network, yay, hosted
1294860	1302060	by Razorbug, Rob, and Sil over in the UK about various things in geek culture, video games,
1302060	1305660	television and so forth, so get your Geek Card stamped with them every week, so welcome
1305660	1306780	then to the network.
1306780	1311340	And we also talked about how we're not doing E3 this year, for very similar reasons that
1311340	1316820	I've just vented to you about with PAX, E3's also going down this whole of, why am I going
1316820	1322800	to spend all this money to go to E3 just to maybe have appointments, maybe, if I'm lucky
1322800	1329220	and I beg, and we can make people understand what a podcast is, even though cereal is huge
1329220	1330220	right now.
1330220	1335300	If we can get an appointment to see the exact same thing that they're streaming on Twitch
1335300	1341780	TV at 3 o'clock, you know, I just, I'm not sure the money is justified to spend to go
1341780	1349060	to something like E3 when that is money that we could spend to get table space at a medium
1349060	1356420	or small convention like GamerX, like Magfest, like, you know, something else.
1356420	1358900	California Stream I get to go to this year, I don't know if we're doing anything with
1358900	1362820	that yet, but maybe, I hope to, I'm going to ask that question.
1362820	1366860	One other exciting announcement, I'm very excited about this because this is a local
1366860	1371140	organization, but they're doing things on an international scale, and that is the Sacramento
1371140	1376260	branch of the International Game Developers Association, and the Sac IGDA is actually
1376260	1384300	hosting an event here locally on April 11th, and we are going to be broadcasting from that
1384300	1390140	event live all day from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., actually going to be broadcasting from that,
1390140	1392660	and you guys will be able to ask questions with some of the developers that we'll be
1392660	1397260	sitting down with, and you might think, well, oh, if it's Sacramento, then I don't live
1397260	1403420	there, am I, well, these games are all games that are trying to get noticed more on a national
1403420	1407500	scale so they can be distributed on things like DeSoura, as some of them are actually
1407500	1413580	getting exposure on, and, you know, other national platforms, so it's not like, you
1413580	1416900	know, in this day and age of the internet, you won't be able to check out a lot of these
1416900	1421340	games for yourself that we're actually going to be talking about on the show, on that live
1421340	1422340	broadcast.
1422340	1429860	So VOG Network with us from OLR will be broadcasting from the Sacramento Indie Arcade Gaming Expo
1429860	1434220	at the Colonial Cafe in the colony next door on Saturday, April 11th.
1434220	1438380	If you happen to be local in the area, you should probably come on down and say hello.
1438380	1441100	So that was, that's something very exciting to announce.
1441100	1448660	You see, see, and I, I bet, I bet we'll talk to 10 times as many developers at that than
1448660	1456940	I have at any other show, and I have to spend $5 on gas to get over there.
1456940	1457940	If that.
1457940	1459780	Isn't that a better use of money?
1459780	1460780	I think so.
1460780	1462620	So I'm excited about that.
1462620	1465660	Loki, you were already talking about going to this and then all of a sudden it's, hey,
1465660	1466660	guess what?
1466660	1468260	We're going to be, we're going to be broadcasting from it.
1468260	1470340	Uh, hopefully I can still go to it.
1470380	1471380	I'm hoping I can.
1471380	1472380	No, I'm hoping you can too.
1472380	1473700	It won't be the same without you.
1473700	1475220	So, all right.
1475220	1476220	Anyhow.
1476220	1477220	Uh, there you go.
1477220	1480780	That's, that's our housekeeping and, and everything we're going to talk about at the top of the
1480780	1484620	show, except of course, how we always start off the show here at Orange Launch Radio,
1484620	1487140	talking out a little bit about our gaming weeks.
1487140	1488340	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1488340	1490940	Uh, my gaming week was, I didn't play really anything.
1490940	1492060	I was just been working on my game.
1492060	1493060	In fact, it's weird.
1493060	1498820	I had a bug creep up on me that I've already had fixed, so I'm not sure how it came back
1498820	1502820	and even looking at the code, it doesn't make any sense because it should work and
1502820	1505140	yet it's not working.
1505140	1507660	So I'm trying to figure out why that is.
1507660	1512620	Well, if you can ever finish a darn game that you work on, Loki, maybe you can join the
1512620	1516020	SAC IJCA and maybe show at the show.
1516020	1517020	Wouldn't that be something?
1517020	1520500	Uh, you might miss the deadline for the submissions, but maybe next year.
1520500	1521500	Nope.
1521500	1522740	Figured it out what it is just now.
1522740	1525620	We just now, wait, you just, you squashed a bug in your head as you were complaining
1525620	1526620	about it?
1526620	1531380	I'm hitting the collider that's on the car that I put there because I replaced the colliders
1531380	1537460	on there and so I don't have it on a masking layer and so it's hitting the car's own collider
1537460	1539740	and that's why it thinks it's still on the ground.
1539740	1541740	Ah, I'm so stupid.
1541740	1544180	Anyways, but that'll be fixed today.
1544180	1548380	No, but really the whole thing I was working on this week was getting the car model they
1548380	1553420	had was originally this kind of stand-in thing and now I have an actual car model on there
1553420	1555860	and it looks fancy and everything.
1556540	1560340	It matches the style of the game and what else did I do?
1560340	1561820	That was pretty much it.
1561820	1563220	I was just really tired this week.
1563220	1567380	A lot of it was trying to catch up on sleep and I got really distracted by CinemaSins
1567380	1568380	this week.
1568380	1574740	I watched way too many of those videos, but mostly because I was so tired I couldn't concentrate
1574740	1580660	to work on stuff and so I just, I don't know, I just kind of slacked off a little bit.
1580660	1587220	I played a little bit of LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, but less than a minute, just very
1587220	1588220	little.
1588220	1591140	And I really meant to play DJ Hero this week.
1591140	1596260	I just, once again, too lazy to go dig out the turntables in the other room and set up
1596260	1601620	my Xbox 360 because it's not currently set up and finding the disc, wherever the hell
1601620	1603860	that is.
1603860	1607500	So yeah, but I want to.
1607500	1611860	I still want to play that and maybe something on my Steam library, I've been kind of digging
1611860	1612860	through that a little bit.
1612860	1613860	I don't know.
1613860	1615500	It's just been kind of slacking off a week.
1615500	1616980	Hopefully it'll be a little more productive.
1616980	1621020	Well, if you've been working on the game, you know, working on a game is likely.
1621020	1625460	My goal was trying to have, you know, the game at least another level built and I still
1625460	1627260	very well can have another level built.
1627260	1631740	I'm just kind of tweaking the car a bit just to make sure that it works fine because in
1631740	1636180	order to make the other levels, I have to basically duplicate this start level that
1636180	1638300	I have and then change stuff in it.
1638300	1642520	And if I make a change to something outside of that, then I've got to change it in every
1642520	1644260	single level that I make afterwards.
1644260	1650300	And it's just better to get all of those things fixed first and then do, you know, do the
1650300	1651300	car stuff.
1651300	1653460	But I don't know.
1653460	1655660	That's it.
1655660	1658500	Anything that you think you might get to play in the next week?
1658500	1660760	Well, the game's quite playable.
1660760	1663400	My son played it for a good 20 minutes today.
1663400	1668160	I just, you know, I have to jump on past, you know, one of the checkpoints, basically
1668160	1670060	a game breaking bug.
1670060	1675200	And so I get him past that little ring and he can drive around with however he wants
1675200	1677320	and it works just fine.
1677320	1678780	So that was the thing.
1678780	1680960	So he's been playing with that and it works.
1680960	1682960	I don't know.
1682960	1684380	All right.
1684380	1686320	So I'll just work on a little more.
1686320	1690400	I'm, since I didn't get a level done this week, that means I got to get two done next
1690400	1691400	week.
1691400	1692400	All right.
1692400	1695200	Well, my gaming week, you know, I talked about some of the stuff I played at PAX already.
1695200	1701620	So outside of the expo, of course, I did a little playing of like Theatrhythm and Fantasy
1701620	1706360	Life on the flight and those good old standby 3DS games, right?
1706360	1709560	And then when I got home, I've been playing some of the usual stuff, Diablo 3, because
1709560	1711720	Alan is still super into Diablo 3.
1711720	1714120	He's like Paragon 350 plus at this point, I think.
1714120	1715120	I don't know.
1715120	1716120	I'd have to ask him.
1716120	1718680	But I know that doesn't mean anything to you, Loki, but that's a lot.
1718680	1720960	That's like 350 levels in a game.
1720960	1721960	That's a lot.
1721960	1722960	That's a lot.
1722960	1724540	But, you know, it's what he loves doing right now.
1724540	1725540	So that's cool.
1725540	1728640	I'm up to Paragon 140, I think at this point.
1728640	1733120	So I'm lagging behind a little bit, but I'm able to run Torment 6's with him and stay
1733120	1734120	alive with my move.
1734120	1737760	So are they like, does the difficulty ramp up as you level up or you just become all
1737760	1740440	godlike and just be able to like squash anything?
1740440	1745040	Well, the set difficulties in the game are like, you know, like normal, master, hard,
1745040	1747360	like all the way up through Torment 6.
1747360	1751480	And you do get to a point where even in Torment 6, you're pretty much face rolling a lot of
1751480	1752480	the rifts and all this.
1752480	1753840	But here's what happened.
1753840	1759960	Here's what happens is that when you beat a rift, most of the time you'll get what's
1759960	1760960	called a keystone.
1760960	1764220	And that keystone allows you to enter a greater rift.
1764220	1768480	And the greater rift starts with a trial where you just fight these mobs over and over again.
1768480	1772480	They get harder and harder and harder and they respawn in these different waves.
1772480	1779000	And if you get to about wave 25, you're running the equivalent of a Torment 6.
1779000	1780800	But the numbers go higher than 25.
1780800	1783600	In fact, I believe they go all the way up to 50, maybe 60.
1783600	1784600	I don't know.
1784600	1786120	This is probably more of an Alan question.
1786120	1788880	Maybe he's listening and can run out here and tell me.
1788880	1793520	So once you get the keystone, then you actually run a rift at that level.
1793520	1797280	So let me tell you, even though like Alan is that level I told you he's at, he's still
1797280	1800160	banging his head on, I think Torment 37 right now.
1800160	1804000	So there's still a lot of room for him to grow beyond what he's doing.
1804000	1806160	So that's kind of what the end game ends up being.
1806160	1808680	But I mean, it is still Diablo.
1808680	1809740	It's a dungeon crawler.
1809740	1811160	It's a click loot fest.
1811160	1813360	But there's something very zen about it.
1813360	1814360	Just sitting down and playing.
1814360	1816720	And then, you know, you get to play with friends and you get more experience when you play
1816720	1817860	with friends and so forth.
1817860	1818860	So that's exciting.
1818860	1823720	I tried playing Clicker Heroes this week just to see because I haven't looked at it in months
1823720	1825960	and it won't even open anymore.
1825960	1826960	What?
1826960	1828400	Yeah, it won't even open on my computer.
1828400	1829400	Oh no.
1829640	1833640	I was like, okay, well I guess I'm done with that.
1833640	1837920	Um, let's see, anyway, um, what was I going to say?
1837920	1843120	Outside of Diablo 3, also a little more Final Fantasy XIV, because I didn't even mention
1843120	1844860	we did this at Penny Arcade Expo.
1844860	1849560	The one panel we did stand in a line to get in a line, even though you're not supposed
1849560	1853400	to do that, everyone does it anyway, but we stood in a line to get into the line to get
1853400	1858440	into the Final Fantasy XIV panel where they showed all the information about the expansion,
1858480	1863720	all the new outfits for the different jobs, and announced the release date of June 23rd.
1863720	1866520	Our birthday, here at OLR, so how appropriate, right?
1866520	1869840	So Heavens War, the expansion's coming out June 23rd.
1869840	1872840	So we actually did that panel.
1872840	1876280	So of course it kind of got me a little more enthused for Final Fantasy XIV, so I came
1876280	1878160	home and I played a lot of that as well.
1878160	1882980	But I did play new stuff, guys, in fact I played a game that I really should have played
1882980	1887920	three months ago, four months ago, when it was first free on PlayStation Plus, and I
1887920	1890120	downloaded it, and I really should have played it then.
1890120	1894160	I don't know why I didn't, I just, probably game overload, or I was sucked into my MMOs
1894160	1895160	or something.
1895160	1899440	But Flaco Jones had told me about four or five different times, Rob, you need to play
1899440	1901800	Velocity 2X, you need to play this game.
1901800	1905040	So finally, I decided to sit down and play it this week.
1905040	1910020	I think his most recent tweet yelling at me about this finally resonated in my head.
1910020	1913920	So I went in and I played the game, and I love it.
1913920	1915400	It's so, it's great.
1915400	1919880	It's like, you know, and Flaco was saying that I would really like it because every
1919880	1923320	time I talk about the Guardian Legend and how it's like half a shooter game, half like
1923320	1927780	a Zelda adventure exploration game, he's like, that's Velocity, you need to play Velocity.
1927780	1932480	And it kind of is, I mean, Velocity definitely has the shooter, and more like a side-scrolling
1932480	1939700	platformer, whereas, whereas Guardian Legend is more like a Zelda slash shooter, I would
1939700	1944960	say Velocity is more like a Rayman slash shooter type of thing, but definitely encourages and
1945000	1950000	embraces speedrunning because, you know, it's, at the end of each level, of which I think
1950000	1953360	there's 50 levels in the game, at the end of each level, you're evaluated and you get
1953360	1958360	a medal on how fast did you do it, how many of the possible survivor capsules did you
1958360	1962920	pick up, how many of the possible crystals did you pick up, and how much out of the total
1962920	1966960	possible score did you get by killing every monster that's in the level and so forth.
1966960	1973220	So you get evaluated on all that, and if you want a perfect, which of course, if you obsess
1973220	1978620	over not missing anything in your games like I do, then you obsess about getting a perfect,
1978620	1981980	but if you want a perfect medal, you gotta do all those things at the same time in one
1981980	1987820	run-through. Get a very fast time and collect everything. So it really, like, presents a
1987820	1993740	challenge, and, you know, it's a good-looking game, even though the graphics don't exactly
1993740	1996900	push the envelope of the PlayStation 4, it's probably the type of game that could have
1996900	1999980	been on PlayStation 3, in fact, I believe it is, and there's probably not much of a
1999980	2004380	difference between PS3 and PS4 versions. Still, at the end of the day, it's about
2004380	2009460	fun, and the graphic style suits the game, and it's a lot of fun. I go back and I play
2009460	2015140	levels over and over to try to better my score, and the soundtrack is so good. The soundtrack
2015140	2021860	is, like, Commodore 64-influenced. So, like, again, credit to you, Flaco Jones, because
2021860	2025220	like three or four months ago, you were telling me, Rob, this is like a perfect game for you,
2025220	2029300	why are you not playing this game? And he was right. He was right. I don't know why
2029300	2033180	I didn't. Just sometimes, sometimes you're like, oh, but no new games right now, because
2033180	2037820	I got to get my palette into max level and 14. But I'm so happy I checked out Velocity
2037820	2041460	2X. That's a lot of fun, and I'll probably be playing that more in the coming weeks.
2041460	2045620	So, if you didn't pick up that game on PlayStation Plus, I would say it's still worth your money
2045620	2051740	to check it out. So, that was my gaming week. Since we already went through our housekeeping
2051740	2056140	notes for the night, I will mention we are on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R. We're
2056140	2060340	on Facebook and Google Plus as well. Facebook dot com slash Orange Lounge Radio. Google
2060340	2066380	dot com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio. Let's get into some gaming news. Usually, we would
2066380	2072140	do like a last week's news set to Holic, but there was kind of a few big stories that require
2072140	2075900	a little more attention. So, let's get into some highlights from last week, Loki.
2075900	2079580	So, the big one, which we kind of knew was going to happen, or at least thought it would
2079580	2084260	happen was Rock Band 4 was announced, and they announced it for PlayStation 4 and Xbox
2084260	2092820	One. Haven't really slated exactly when it's going to be coming out, but looks pretty awesome.
2092820	2098060	It's got a new set of instruments, which honestly look just like the old set of instruments,
2098060	2106940	but I don't know. Apparently, though, they are looking at trying to take the support
2106940	2111740	that you had, because a lot of people really were into Rock Band on Xbox 360 and PlayStation
2111740	2117700	3, and so they're having ways that you can import your songs that you bought on PlayStation
2117700	2126300	3 or Xbox 360 to your consoles. I'm hoping that that's cross platform, but I don't think
2126300	2130860	so. I think it's Xbox 360 to Xbox One. No, I think they even said in an FAQ, it's
2130860	2135260	not cross platform because of the rules of the different stores, which, yeah, I think
2135260	2141460	you, me, a lot of people are sitting out there going, Rock Band 4 might have just sold me
2141460	2147740	an Xbox One. I know that's where I'm at. Not that I didn't want one anyway. I already
2147740	2152400	wanted an Xbox One for other reasons, but now I'm sitting here going, yeah, by the time
2152400	2157180	Rock Band 4 comes out, I'm going to need an Xbox One, because I'm not losing that library
2157180	2162140	of songs. Yeah, exactly. And the other thing, too, is that there's supposed to be maybe
2162140	2168780	support for the old instruments as well. I hope so, because damn, I have a full set of
2168780	2172720	instruments on the Xbox 360, and that's kind of the thing with me. It's like, I don't play
2172720	2179820	a ton of Rock Band right now, or pretty much at all anymore, and I am not buying another
2179820	2184920	set of instruments for Rock Band 4. So, I hope that that's the case, because otherwise
2184920	2188860	I probably just won't pick it up. I think they said that they're trying solutions right
2188860	2191180	now. They don't have a definitive answer, but they're working on it. I would be fine
2191180	2195380	with like a third party mod type situation where, you know, you have some sort of devices
2195380	2199060	that allow it to run on other consoles or something like that. Yeah, YYR summarizes
2199060	2203380	it in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com, saying, controller compatibility is not guaranteed,
2203380	2207700	but they said they're looking into it. ActDeft was some very strong words here, saying, Rock
2207700	2213500	Band 4 defined what next gen console I'm getting. Xbox One for me now. So, very interesting
2213500	2220140	that this is the game that is going to cement the next gen for a lot of people. Yeah. Microsoft
2220140	2225300	should be like, not only has Harmonix really been supporting the Kinect, when like, literally
2225300	2230540	nobody else has, like, Microsoft should be sending Harmonix a dozen roses every day.
2230540	2236220	I mean, really. And chocolates. And like, whatever they want. A pony. And then fortunately
2236220	2243180	there will not be an Xbox, or a Wii U version of that game, because EA, I'm assuming is
2243180	2248620	publishing it again, and EA fucking hates the Wii U, so, sorry. No Rock Band on the
2248620	2254540	Wii U. Well, are they necessarily publishing it? There's no... I don't think anything's
2254540	2257620	been said on that. I don't think anything's been said, but... There's also no MTV Games
2257620	2260820	in the picture anymore, so a lot could be different. I would be willing to bet that
2260820	2265380	EA is probably publishing that. Alright. That'd be interesting to see. I mean, I'm guessing.
2265380	2271740	I don't know who else would be. Maybe Self. Who knows? They could do it. No. I doubt it.
2271740	2277280	Well, we'll see. We'll see. But, well, I think also just the mere fact is, if they're developing
2277280	2285480	it for next gen, Wii U runs on current gen, right? Or are they doing Rock Band 4 on Playstation
2285480	2291840	3 and Xbox 360 as well? Well, the question was, you know, why not on Wii or Wii U or
2291840	2296640	PC? It says due to shifting production priorities and capabilities of studios, we don't currently
2296640	2301200	have any plans to release Rock Band 4 on the Wii or Wii U or PC simultaneously with Xbox
2301200	2309240	1 and Playstation 4. Bobby in our chat room is clarifying that EA doesn't publish Rock
2309240	2314120	Band 3 anymore. Mad Catz publishes it now. There's no EA splash screen anymore. And act
2314120	2318120	deaf to jumping in saying Mad Catz is doing it as well. Oh, that's right. They make the
2318120	2322280	instruments, so. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. They had that whole thing. I am a little sad
2322280	2327040	that they eliminated keyboards. I, you know, I think we all saw it coming, so I can't like
2327040	2332360	be upset, and I don't want to be one of those gamershateeverything.com types of people,
2332360	2337600	but yeah, I'm still a little sad. Especially if the old tracks are gonna work. Like, it'd
2337600	2342400	be nice. It'd be nice. It'd be nice just to have that support there, not necessarily new
2342400	2346480	songs supporting it, but like the old songs would be nice. Yeah, that's, I would like
2346480	2351320	to see that as well, but. But why put it in if you're not gonna support it in new songs?
2351320	2356320	Keyboards clearly did not do too well, but this, I just, I am expressing my grievance.
2356320	2361040	I would like it to be aired, and that's that. So, we'll move on and just hope there are
2361040	2364160	other exciting things. I think it's cool that it's coming out. Just, you know, once again,
2364160	2369280	I'm kind of, I'm a little over the whole like, ooh, it's a music game, gotta pick it up and
2369280	2374200	support it. Now it's like, yeah, I've supported it enough with all the crap that's in my garage
2374200	2378880	and on my, you know, Xbox 360. Well, I mean, they really, I mean, besides the fact that
2378880	2382840	they've said it's coming, we really haven't seen anything about it. We don't have a screenshot
2382840	2386360	at all. We don't really have anything else to go off of. So, but I mean, that's, that's
2386360	2389720	also a good thing because that means there might be new play modes and new things in
2389720	2394000	the game. And I've, I've talked about on the show before how I think social and this new
2394000	2397440	day and age of social gaming we live in is gonna really drive Rock Band 4. We don't know
2397440	2401000	any of that stuff. And I imagine that's what they're keeping in their hat until E3 that
2401000	2406100	they can put out there on the Twitch stream or by appointment, you know. We will see more
2406100	2411640	information about what's happening with that. Yeah. So I'm sure it'll be at E3. I'm sure
2411640	2416600	it will too. And Bobby Blackwell in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com saying, I want
2416600	2421880	stage kit compatibility. I agree. I still want one of those stage kits, even though
2421880	2424600	that'd be a complete waste of money at this point. You could probably get them really
2424600	2431160	cheap now. All right. Also in last week's news, speaking of EA, I'm sure many of you
2431160	2436520	caught wind of this, even though this happened during GDC. And I don't know if that was an
2436520	2441280	attempt to not have this show up on the radar, but in this day and age of the internet, when
2441280	2447480	you try really hard to have something not show up on the radar, guess what? It elevates
2447480	2453460	it to people's radar that much more. And that's what happened when news came out that EA has
2453460	2463040	closed Maxis. Maxis behind the Sims 4 and of course the ill-fated SimCity reboot that
2463040	2468960	happened a couple years ago that, you know, didn't, it wasn't received too well because
2468960	2473040	of the always online component that not everybody was on board for. Well, and even like SimCity
2473040	2478280	or the Sims 4, like with all the removed features and stuff in there, it's like, come on. You
2478280	2483880	know, I mean, I have a hard time believing it was just Maxis going, you know, this is
2483880	2488800	going to be a good idea. I can't, I can't help but think that EA kind of pushed them
2488800	2493140	to do certain things that they did in that. That's, that's the other thing that's kind
2493140	2499700	of interesting or crazy to me and all this is that, you know, Maxis, you know, ate a
2499700	2504460	lot of controversy with the SimCity thing. And I don't know, when I still think of Maxis,
2504460	2508620	I have a very soft space in my heart because I think of all those amazing Sim games from
2508620	2513380	the nineties, like the original SimCity, even SimCity 2000, even though I didn't like that
2513380	2519100	one as much, but I know a lot of people did, but I think of things like SimAnt, SimEarth,
2519100	2524460	SimTower. I loved all those games and man, that was the heyday. And unfortunately, you
2524460	2529660	know, now they started going in this direction with the, the SimCity and I wasn't a big fan
2529660	2534040	of the whole always online thing because I think a lot of us, why did we love SimCity
2534040	2538820	the original? Cheat codes and making Godzilla appear whenever you want by typing certain
2538820	2543300	things in the keyboard. But in this day and age, and the way EA's model has been as of
2543300	2549400	late is now you can pay money to unlock all that. And people were not having that, but
2549400	2557640	I feel like that is part of EA's culture, not Maxis' culture. So there's something very
2557640	2565060	odd to me about the reason that that game flopped was probably more EA's influence than
2565060	2571500	anybody else. And so that's, what's very frustrating about this news, you know, and again, I'm
2571500	2576460	just sitting here in my spare room in Sacramento commentating on what I see. I don't know how
2576460	2581140	it works on the inside, but I still can't help but feel like every issue with these
2581140	2584260	games was something that was decided in a boardroom, not by a developer.
2584260	2589060	To me, that's kind of the same situation I think with Activision and Bazaar was, you
2589060	2593180	know, kind of that, oh, hey, we have an idea, you do this. And then like, it didn't work
2593180	2597860	out. And so they punished, they punished the developer instead, you know, even though it
2597860	2600100	was their terrible idea.
2600100	2605740	Kossin in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, no shout out for Sim Farm. Look, I didn't
2605740	2611100	shout out Simcopter either. Okay, look, I just, I can't, can't name them all. Anyhow,
2611100	2616700	EA saying that today we're consolidating Maxis IP development to our studios in Redwood Shores,
2616700	2622300	Salt Lake City, Helsinki, and Melbourne as we close our Emeryville locations. Maxis continues
2622300	2626740	to support and develop new experiences for current Sims and SimCity players while expanding
2626740	2632260	our franchises to new platforms and developing new cross-platform IP. In other words, SimCity
2632260	2636660	isn't dead, the Sims isn't dead, but they're probably going to show up on mobiles.
2636660	2640580	Well, they already have. I think it's more of they're going to have different teams developing
2640580	2644700	it. And you know what, maybe that's better for that series. Maybe it'll end up being...
2644700	2649540	I still feel like if some of the same decisions are still made, it's not going to change a
2649540	2654300	goddamn thing. And you know that. So EA is going to have to take a different approach
2654340	2657860	with if they're going to move it to a different development studio, they need to let that
2657860	2662220	studio make the decisions. Well, whose idea was it for like Sim... I mean, I'm assuming
2662220	2667860	it started with like kind of Sims 2 and stuff, maybe even Sims 1 where they have like $400
2667860	2673100	worth of expansions and shit for like the Sims. Well, here's the other thing to keep
2673100	2679940	in mind though, is that the Sims at the time, and I think maybe still possibly eclipsed
2679940	2683260	by one of the Blizzard games like World of Warcraft, but I'm pretty confident in saying
2683260	2690180	the Sims is the biggest PC game of all time, or at least was for a very long period of
2690180	2694180	time unless something's eclipsed it recently that I'm not aware of. But I mean, when you
2694180	2699620	have the most popular game of all time, multiple expansions to that I think are justifiable
2699620	2704900	and fine, you know, whatever. Yeah, but when you have like a new expansion... It's not
2704900	2708500	that different from DLC today. It's not that different from DLC today. It's not that different
2708500	2713980	from EA DLC today. I mean, it's the same thing. It's just, you know, they supported
2713980	2720340	it with discs and that kind of nonsense. Yeah. So, I don't know. I just... This news hits
2720340	2725180	hard a little bit just because, again, I remember Maxis from the 90s and I used to love them,
2725180	2728460	but then, you know... It kind of went downhill with support, didn't it? Yeah, I just... I
2728460	2734500	hate to say it, but they haven't... Unfortunately, they haven't knocked one out of the park probably
2734500	2739860	since maybe what? Sims 2. Even Dark Sakura, that girl in the earlier years of the show,
2739860	2744380	she used to play the Sims all the time, right? Have you heard her talk about Sims 4? Maybe
2744380	2749500	once? She's kind of moved on. So, I think, unfortunately, that kind of says a lot about
2749500	2754060	what's going on. You're right. Spore... And it's so hard to say this because I think Will
2754060	2758900	Wright is a genius. I do, but Spore... We all know Spore missed the mark in several
2758900	2761500	places where it was just too disjointed. That's fine. I'm fine with Will Wright kickstarting
2761500	2767980	something if you... Yeah! Hey, why don't you, like, you know, come out with another
2767980	2774580	city simulator or something like that. Simulator City. Every musician has their not-so-great
2774580	2780140	album, so you know what? Every designer is allowed their not-so-great game as well, so...
2780140	2786380	It happens. It happens. Anyway, also, it's funny you should say that. Why doesn't he
2786380	2790220	go back? It sounds like somebody else might have actually put out the game that people
2790220	2794980	wanted. Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com saying, apparently, Cities
2794980	2800820	Skylines, or whatever, is today a SimCity. A lot of people love it, and it just launched
2800820	2805320	last week. And TigerClaw says, yeah, one of the reasons is the Steam Workshop support.
2805320	2809460	People can mod it. And yeah, I'm... Somebody even tweeted me like, Rob, are you gonna play
2809460	2813580	this game? And I'm like, yeah, if I can look away from the MMOs for like two minutes, I'll
2813580	2818980	play this game. But I am very interested in the Cities Skyline, which sounds like opportunistic
2819020	2824860	as hell in a way, but hey, good on ya. You heard that all the people wanted this game
2824860	2829340	instead, so you went and made that game. Good for you. And it's getting very good reviews
2829340	2832540	from what I'm hearing as well. So maybe Cities Skylines is where it's at.
2832540	2839540	Yeah. So, anyhow, never... Bad decisions or not, it's never easy to talk about people
2839580	2844700	losing their jobs, so I hope all those people can find footing somewhere else, and again,
2844700	2848740	I know I realize, and I think a little bit realizes, it's probably not your fault if
2848740	2851680	you're a programmer or an artist or somebody on the front lines, it's probably not your
2851680	2855500	fault that SimCity went online, and I'm sure many of you internally often wanted to do
2855500	2859980	these questions as well. So, sorry to see that that happened. I hope you can find other
2859980	2864180	employment somewhere very soon, or venture out and open up a new studio, as we've seen
2864180	2867540	a lot of people doing, and a lot of those indie developers that were at PAX East were
2867540	2870740	part of that. Anyhow, let's move on to something else.
2870740	2873900	This is gonna be something a little different for the show. We haven't really done anything
2873900	2878900	like this before, but some big news came up during that week that I was at PAX East,
2878900	2882860	and this was so big that I was getting plenty of Facebook messages about it, like, Rob,
2882860	2885820	you gonna talk about this on OLR? You gonna talk about this? I was getting tweets about
2885820	2891500	it and so forth. So yes, we're gonna talk about it on OLR. And I think this news is
2891500	2897700	not on a lot of people's radars, and I actually got a tweet from our buddy YYR that said,
2897700	2902700	hey, Rob, can I do a special piece on this or something? Because I really wanna have
2902700	2906440	my say on this and explain this to everybody. And I was like, yes, we can have a foreign
2906440	2913180	correspondent now. We made it. We do. We have a foreign correspondent from New York. Is
2913180	2916560	that foreign? Well, foreign enough here for us here. It's a little outside the People's
2916560	2921640	Republic of Davis, but you know. So we are gonna go to our foreign correspondent to talk
2921640	2926580	a little bit about what is going on with Programmed World. And I'm gonna reiterate, I don't think
2926580	2932680	a lot of people are talking about this because this is very deeply rooted in our deep roots
2932680	2937240	of being a music gaming program, which is really where we started. So I don't think
2937240	2942080	this is popping up on a lot of people's radars, but I'm gonna ping it right now. So let's
2942080	2946400	go to our foreign correspondent, YYR, with more information.
2946400	2951960	The end of an era, Nostal Mix. This is an Orange Lounge Radio special report. I'm Aaron
2951960	2959020	Toplitsky. How far would you go to play a video game or to share it with the world?
2959020	2964260	Germany ceased production of Beatmania 2DX home versions in 2009. They continued yearly
2964260	2970060	updates to the game, each bringing lots of new songs and challenges. But outside of Japan,
2970060	2976800	they were impossible to find. A small group calling themselves DJ Hackers began to crack
2976800	2982580	these newer versions of 2DX, which were running on fairly ordinary PCs running Windows XP
2982580	2988020	embedded. They did release the cracked data for download on a private BitTorrent tracker,
2988020	2994260	but their true goal was to bring the full 2DX experience to arcades outside of Japan.
2994260	2999100	So while they soon had cracked versions of the game running on legitimate 2DX cabinets,
2999100	3001940	their efforts did not end there.
3001940	3007820	In Japan, Konami runs a network called eAmusement. At first, it simply tracked scores and clear
3007820	3013860	status for each song, but the online features were greatly expanded in later versions. Today's
3013860	3020340	Bimani games are continuously updated, each having dozens of unlockable songs, plus customization
3020340	3025900	features, in-game score comparisons with rival players, and even the ability to pay for your
3025900	3028980	games using virtual currency.
3028980	3034180	Konami's current business model actually revolves around the eAmusement network. Arcades no
3034180	3039820	longer pay for new versions of Bimani games. Instead, they pay Konami monthly for network
3039820	3046260	access, and also pay approximately 30% of each machine's revenue. Further, the latest
3046260	3050660	games need to be connected to the network just to function. If they can't connect at
3050660	3057020	boot time, they can't be played. In fact, arcades must have a current eAmusement subscription
3057020	3061700	and agree to these terms in order to receive the newest game versions at all. They can't
3061700	3064260	be obtained in any other way.
3064260	3069200	Several independent arcades in America have tried contacting Konami in an effort to sign
3069200	3073840	up for eAmusement, but none to date have received a reply.
3073840	3079120	Following many months of work, DJ Hackers successfully reverse engineered the eAmusement
3079120	3085080	network, and then set up their own, which they of course named after a song in 2DX,
3085080	3090760	Programmed World. They also found a source in Japan who could provide access to current
3090760	3096760	Bimani games. By late 2011, Programmed World had reached out to known locations outside
3096760	3102360	of Japan with 2DX machines, informing them that they could now run the latest, current
3102360	3107960	version. All they needed was their machine, a pair of card readers, a broadband internet
3107960	3113460	connection, a Linksys router, and a bit of cooperation. Programmed World offered the
3113460	3120460	service free of charge, and just as Beatmania 2DX 19, Linkle, was released in Japan, arcades
3120980	3127540	in America received it mere days later. This effort grew, and over time, Programmed World
3127540	3134540	added support for Popin' Music, DDR, Ubeat, SoundVoltex, GuitarFreaks, and Drummania,
3135420	3140460	delivering new versions of most games as they were released. Programmed World even added
3140460	3145820	some features Konami never offered, such as transfer of player song scores from one game
3145820	3147660	version to the next.
3147740	3153380	Then, seemingly suddenly, just over a week ago, the administrator of Programmed World
3153380	3158900	received a cease and desist letter from Konami Digital Entertainment Incorporated. Several
3158900	3163820	arcades serviced by Programmed World also received letters asking them to stop running
3163820	3170100	current versions of Bimani games or face potential legal action. Two days later, on the evening
3170100	3176820	of Sunday, March 8th, Programmed World permanently shut down. Devoted players convened online
3176820	3182940	asking why. It had become clear over time that as Programmed World expanded, and as
3182940	3187820	our communications became increasingly social, it was impossible to keep it a secret from
3187820	3193460	Konami. However, according to sources, Konami had been aware of the network's existence
3193460	3198700	for at least several years. Why did they wait to take action until now?
3198700	3204860	One possibility comes in the form of a Japanese chain of amusement centers named Round 1,
3204900	3210900	which in recent years decided to expand into the United States beginning in California.
3210900	3217380	These centers feature karaoke, bowling, billiards, darts, ping pong, and a large arcade packed
3217380	3223620	with Japanese games including the latest Bimani games. But through a special deal with Konami,
3223620	3230460	Round 1's Bimani games are all connected to the official Japanese e-amusement network.
3230460	3235940	As Programmed World continued to grow worldwide, reaching Europe, South America, and even parts
3235940	3241300	of Asia, Round 1 continued their expansion in the United States. They've already opened
3241300	3248300	locations in Texas and Illinois, and are coming soon to Washington, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania.
3248420	3255420	They list Beatmania 2DX as a Round 1 exclusive game on their website. So, some players believe
3255420	3260340	that they may have seen Programmed World as unfair competition and asked Konami to
3260340	3262140	shut it down.
3262140	3266860	Another possibility comes in the form of an announcement quietly posted to Konami's website
3266860	3273540	less than two weeks ago, the opening of what they call e-Amusement Global Service. Further
3273540	3278780	details have been promised later this month, but what players are hoping for is that Konami
3278780	3284140	recognizes a global demand for their games and will begin to provide the service directly
3284140	3289540	to arcades around the world. However, whether they'll actually provide the service to locations
3289540	3294580	other than Round 1 remains to be seen. And even if they do offer the service to other
3294580	3300300	locations, there's no guarantee that the cost will be affordable enough for struggling independent
3300300	3301580	arcades.
3301580	3307880	Ultimately, these arcades, and their owners, stand to lose even more than the players.
3307880	3312460	At the very least, until we learn more about Konami's plans, all of the machines that were
3312460	3318620	connected to Programmed World must be manually downgraded to versions that will run offline.
3318620	3325540	The newest of these is over three years old. The situation for some venues is even worse.
3325540	3333060	The newly opened Nanuet Arcade in New York recently purchased DDR2014 and SoundVoltex3
3333060	3339260	machines. Both are still on their way from overseas, and without a network connection,
3339260	3341980	they can't be played at all.
3341980	3345260	For Orange Lounge Radio, I'm Aaron Toplitsky.
3401980	3405500	Do they have one in California? Because I'd like to go, it sounds awesome.
3405500	3411260	But anyway, I think that whole theory about Round 1 and the fact that, okay, if they are
3411260	3415660	embracing having these machines there, and they've made these deals with Konami, because
3415660	3419660	they know that, you know, Bomani games are still huge in Japan, and they want to be like
3419660	3425300	a Japanese center or whatever, maybe they've agreed to pay the proceeds to Konami, or what
3425300	3429940	have you, then if they're going to go to these other arcades and see, wait a minute, these
3429980	3434580	pirated versions of the game where they're not paying anything at all is running rampant,
3434580	3439780	then, you know, it's, or I shouldn't say pirated, because some of them are purchased legitimately
3439780	3445860	and on the network or whatever, but they're not paying that percentage to Konami, clearly,
3445860	3450780	so there is a different type of money exchange going on there. If they're all doing that,
3450780	3453740	then, you know, Round 1 probably did complain about a problem there.
3453740	3455860	It's a bowling alley, by the way.
3455860	3460820	But it says they have a multitude, probably like our bowling alley here has Laser X and
3460820	3463860	a big arcade and all this other stuff, so it's probably like a similar type of thing.
3463860	3469860	So, let's see, the closest place that they have one, which I'm wondering now that I see
3469860	3474660	this, if they've taken over a different location there, but apparently they do have them in
3474660	3480420	California. They've got one, I'd say probably the closest one would be in the East Ridge
3480420	3482220	Shopping Center in San Jose.
3482220	3485820	Yeah, they're all mentioning in chat that there's a bunch in California. Well, gee,
3485820	3486820	somehow slipped off my radar.
3486820	3488420	That's five. I wouldn't say it's a lot.
3488420	3489820	That's five's a lot.
3489820	3495580	Most are in Southern California. There's one in Santa Ana, one in Lakewood, Moreno Valley,
3495580	3496580	and City of Independence.
3496580	3498500	Fine, OLR Road Trip. We'll make this happen.
3498500	3504380	And actually, the one that's in East Ridge is coming soon. It's not even out there yet.
3504380	3509540	It's a slippery slope, though, because, like, I know when I went to Scandia back when they
3509540	3514100	actually still had the newer 2DX machines, I had a lot of fun playing it, and I really
3514100	3519860	enjoyed that. And, you know, I'm glad that they were able to provide that where Konami
3519860	3524820	would not put that out officially in the U.S. and was kind of holding that back from the
3524820	3529840	fans. So, in a way, you know, the fans are to thank for putting that together and having
3529840	3534620	it out there. But I think now that somebody's stepping in saying, I want to do it legitimately,
3534620	3536380	that's probably why it's taken away.
3536380	3540100	But it is lame, though, that we have these round one exclusive arcade game titles, and
3540100	3547960	here's what they have. Initial D8, Purikura, which is a photo booth, BeatMania 2DX, Pump
3547960	3554580	It Up Pro 50-inch Prime 2015, Transformers, and Pac-Man Smash.
3554580	3560420	Hmm. Well, I mean, when you consider that a lot of other arcades are really, like, you
3560420	3565100	know, kind of going downhill, unfortunately, I mean, it's not too, I mean, what, you have
3565100	3571020	Dave and Busters? I still think it's absolutely, it's, like, kind of a kick in the face of
3571020	3574660	all the people that have supported Konami all this time. It's like, oh, hey, fuck you
3574660	3578500	guys, you know. Oh, you still want to support us? Oh, fuck you. You know, we'll just go
3578500	3581620	ahead and give money to, because they're going to give us money to have this game exclusive
3581620	3586380	to this arcade. So, screw you guys. There's no answer to this that isn't going to piss
3586380	3591220	somebody off. Like, I, and I can honestly, I can honestly truly sit here and say, I see
3591220	3594980	both sides of it. And I think a lot of you out there, as much as maybe you don't want
3594980	3600660	to admit that, you know, you can see Konami's side of it, if they, the way Aaron put it
3600660	3604020	there with the whole agreement with round one, and that maybe round one's going to give
3604020	3607900	them that cut, and once it's exclusive detail, so for, in order for that to happen, the rest
3607900	3614380	has to get shut down. I mean, money talks, and I can see that. At the same time, you
3614380	3620980	know what we always say here on OLR? Hackers gonna hack. And so, where program world goes
3620980	3627700	away, there'll probably be another solution that's out there. But if this round one arcade
3627700	3633100	catches wind of this mom and pop arcade that suddenly is running a BeatMania 2DX, you know,
3633100	3637860	much newer version that is connected online on EMUs, they'll, the arcade will probably
3637860	3643660	get season assisted. I mean, if that's, if, it depends on how big of a draw and how important
3643660	3652060	that is to round one, but if this arcade chain knows there is a cult of music game
3652060	3657720	fans, and I say cult in a loving type of way, not in a, we're all gonna, like, you know,
3657720	3662820	take drugs and die kind of way, I mean, if there is this cult of people who love this
3662820	3669260	music games that will travel a great distance to come to our place, if we are the exclusive,
3669260	3674500	then there's perhaps a certain allure with that, where they want people to have to do
3674500	3675500	that a little bit.
3675500	3677700	They also apparently have Project Diva.
3677700	3684740	Oh, hell, I'm sold on that. I love Project, alright, anyway. Over in our chat room over
3684740	3689980	at live.vognetwork.com, YYR of course providing comments in the chat room there saying, the
3689980	3696700	people really screwed are the ones in countries not serviced by either EMUsment or round one.
3696700	3699900	That's a very good point, is that you might have places in other companies, which, which
3699900	3707160	is why it might be a good thing if this particular EMUsment global service ends up being a thing
3707160	3710860	and maybe in other countries where they don't have round one, maybe there will be another
3710860	3715300	option, or maybe, you know, if the mom and pop arcade wants to get on the 2DX, they can
3715300	3717300	join this EMUs global thing.
3717300	3720800	But here's what I do really like to happen.
3720800	3726660	If Konami's suddenly realizing that this shit is recognized on a global scale, and if music
3726740	3734100	games are experiencing a bit of a renaissance right now, is it too much to ask for a proper
3734100	3740700	goddamn Beatmania release on PlayStation 4 where, wait for it, I know this might be hard
3740700	3746060	to believe, but would it be too much to ask that we just get the same thing that Japan
3746060	3749780	gets? Would it just, I know this might blow people's minds.
3749780	3754640	This is something that might blow minds too, but couldn't you maybe do a digital only release
3754640	3755640	or something like that?
3755640	3758000	Hey, hey, the arcades are upgrading.
3758000	3764520	Let's send, let's push out upgrades that you can too by, you know, maybe it will be slightly
3764520	3767800	limited because, you know, they still got to have some sort of draw for the arcades
3767800	3770000	or maybe it's going to be a year behind or something like that.
3770000	3773960	But I, I don't understand why they couldn't do that.
3773960	3776320	What, what the hell 2DX are they on anymore anyway?
3776320	3780000	I'm really sorry to all the longtime Monty fans, but was Trichorros the latest one?
3780000	3781000	23?
3781000	3782000	Is that where they're at?
3782000	3783000	I don't know.
3783000	3784000	Somebody in chat will correct me if I'm wrong.
3784360	3786520	When was the last one they put out properly on consoles?
3786520	3787520	Princess, right?
3787520	3788520	Six or no, sorry.
3788520	3789520	Empress.
3789520	3790520	Princess.
3790520	3791520	Close enough.
3791520	3793600	Uh, 16 was the last one they put out on PlayStation 2, right?
3793600	3800160	So why not, why not release the new one digitally or even got physical release cause you want
3800160	3801160	to have a controller, right?
3801160	3802160	Or whatever.
3802160	3803560	Maybe you can even use the touch pad.
3803560	3804560	I don't know.
3804560	3805560	Whatever.
3805560	3811880	Figure something out where you can release that and then all those older ones we missed,
3811880	3813960	there's your DLC library.
3813960	3814960	Oh my God.
3814960	3815960	Oh my God.
3815960	3816960	Come on.
3816960	3817960	How many Konami originals do you have?
3817960	3818960	It costs you literally nothing.
3818960	3822080	Why do you need Konami originals?
3822080	3823080	Nevermind in joke.
3823080	3824080	Forget it.
3824080	3826920	Uh, 22 Penn Jewel I'm being told is the recent one.
3826920	3827920	Sorry guys.
3827920	3832720	Uh, Bonds 006 in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, yes, Rob, it's too much to ask.
3832720	3834360	Konami doesn't like making money.
3834360	3841800	Well, you know, to be fair, to be fair, did Beatmania sell as well as something like Rock
3841800	3842800	Band did?
3842800	3843800	No.
3843800	3849240	Did, was it supported by America as well as something like Rock Band was?
3849240	3850240	Nope.
3850240	3851240	Why?
3851240	3855120	Because they didn't, well, they didn't really advertise it and do anything they may.
3855120	3858160	I think didn't they have like a Britney Spears song in there or something like that and that
3858160	3859160	was about it.
3859160	3864240	Two reasons, and these are the two things that must be fixed if the Konami is ever going
3864240	3867280	to succeed with something like this here in America, if they're going to reboot.
3867280	3869880	These are the two things that must be fixed.
3869880	3874960	Problem number one, the songs that were in the game as well as the songs that were in
3874960	3879720	Rock Revolution and so forth, dah, dah, dah, dah, were not really the songs that the general
3879720	3885840	population, not the Colt Bimani fans, I'll get to you in a minute, that was not the group
3885840	3888020	of songs that people wanted to play.
3888020	3890360	Why did Guitar Hero do so stinking well?
3890360	3894680	Because you could actually play like fucking Aerosmith, ACDC, Metallica, and it wasn't
3894680	3897280	just covers, it was the actual songs.
3897320	3903680	They took a huge risk in licensing original songs and it paid off for a few years very,
3903680	3905400	very well, the Guitar Hero and Rock Band thing.
3905400	3909440	Well, it would continue to still pay off if they didn't melt that into the ground, but
3909440	3912480	yeah, that's, it worked for Rock Band.
3912480	3918360	Now item number two, and this one is for those Colt Bimani and music game fans.
3918360	3921160	Item number two that must be fixed.
3921160	3924240	Stop pretending we don't fucking know what's happening in Japan.
3924240	3926340	This is the day and the age of the internet.
3926340	3931300	So stop assuming that your bread and butter Colt fan base doesn't know damn well what's
3931300	3932580	happening in Japan.
3932580	3937740	If you have to cut a few licenses here and there because of legality reasons, then whatever.
3937740	3938940	People will forgive it.
3938940	3943820	But as far as, you know, the vast library of Konami originals in house, there is no
3943820	3947940	reason why the release we get here should not mirror what comes out in Japan.
3947940	3950020	And I would still love a new DDR game.
3950020	3951020	I would.
3951020	3953480	I mean, come on, look at this shit.
3953480	3957320	Look at like what people pay for fucking collector's editions on games and shit.
3957320	3962280	You can't tell me that you can't put on a decent dance pad for a couple hundred dollars.
3962280	3965840	I mean, it's ridiculous.
3965840	3969560	Anyway, there you go.
3969560	3974880	We've given some attention to this topic and I don't, I think E3 may have some answers
3974880	3976280	if Konami is going to unveil.
3976280	3979360	It's all going to be the Melger Solid 5 show and that's about it.
3979360	3981560	Oh, maybe Silent Hills, which would be kind of cool.
3981560	3983680	But of course that.
3983680	3986840	But it's going to be that because that's where their money is going to be made.
3986840	3991080	They're not going to, there's not going to be any sort of dance masters, which I think
3991080	3992760	that was kind of a mistake anyways.
3992760	4000240	But yeah, YYR in chat saying problem is they tailored their American releases to new players
4000240	4002240	exclusively.
4002240	4007240	Act F saying Beatmania was 99% originals and remixes of originals.
4007240	4011080	Let's see Akuma JP saying developers, developers, developers.
4011080	4015040	Akuma just needs to say that, wow, that's an old, I'm sure we get some licensed songs
4015040	4016880	from Vincent de Mora means shit.
4016880	4017880	What's he done lately?
4017880	4021560	I mean, I still, Hey, those are still some of my favorite songs.
4021560	4022560	Exactly.
4022560	4026240	I'm that, I'm not seeing it like being sarcastically, seriously, what has he done lately?
4026240	4030640	Cause I want to listen to more of his stuff and there were other people like UltraMix
4030640	4032840	brought in some very talented people into the family, right?
4032840	4036560	Like Midi Head who did the intro to our show in case you forgot that little riff you heard
4036560	4037560	at the beginning.
4037560	4038560	That was Midi Head who is from UltraMix.
4038560	4043560	And I think he had like one 2DX song, you know, maybe get, get some of his newer stuff.
4043560	4045120	See what he's been up to in the past 10 years.
4045120	4046680	I think he's been doing a lot of scoring for TV.
4046680	4048360	There's a whole ton of indie guys out there.
4048360	4049800	Get Vert to do some music.
4049800	4050800	Fuck yes.
4050800	4051800	Fuck yes.
4051800	4052800	Oh my God.
4052800	4057880	There's all these like huge chiptune guys that are creating these soundtracks that people
4057880	4060160	jizz over that.
4060160	4061160	I do.
4061160	4066320	Do you think Vert would be happy to, for, for a couple hundred bucks or something, throw
4066320	4069920	down a couple tracks that can be in 2DX and would people be here for that?
4069920	4071500	I think they would.
4071500	4075360	And a lot of these other very talented people as well that, that write video game music.
4075360	4080560	That's a fucking great idea, but it's why they won't do it.
4080560	4082240	All right.
4082240	4084100	Anyhow, let's move on.
4084100	4086200	It is a three hour show, not a 30 hour show.
4086200	4088100	I really want to thank YYR for that though.
4088100	4092000	And I got to say, if you're interested in doing a report like that, like if you think
4092000	4095360	you're an expert on a particular subject and you see something happening throughout the
4095360	4099120	week where you're like, you know what, I want to do a report on that for OLR.
4099120	4103420	You can always email us, participate at orangelaundry.com or actually it might be even better.
4103420	4106040	You can always email me directly as long as you're not sending me crap.
4106040	4109540	I'll read it rob at vog network.com.
4109540	4112600	And if you're interested in contributing something to the show, you can also tweet at me.
4112600	4114360	That's what YYR did at SKIE.
4114360	4121160	And as long as you're not like tweeting me all this inane bullshit about ethics or whatever,
4121160	4126000	I will happily pay attention to whatever it is you might want to contribute to the
4126000	4127000	show.
4127000	4128000	So.
4128000	4129000	All right.
4129000	4130000	Let's move on though.
4130000	4131280	We got a lot more news to cover as well.
4131280	4132280	Right, Loki?
4132280	4133280	Moving into this week, finally.
4133280	4134280	So news from this week.
4134280	4135280	Absolutely.
4135280	4136280	And this is kind of cool.
4136280	4139800	It's more information about the new PlayStation 4 firmware update 2.5.
4139800	4143320	Some of the cool things that they're going to add to it is button remapping, which is
4143320	4147280	great if you happen to have like a controller that maybe like a certain button's kind of
4147280	4151620	not working correctly anymore and you want to fix that or maybe you just want to remap
4151620	4155160	your buttons because you like playing a certain way.
4155160	4156160	That's fantastic.
4156160	4158520	So you're able to do that now with the firmware.
4158520	4163760	Also with that, they're going to be adding suspend and resume to gameplay.
4163760	4167820	So normally you can suspend your system and that kind of stuff, but now you can literally
4167820	4172680	pause your game and then come back to right in the same spot that you were in your game
4172680	4174280	without having to worry about that.
4174280	4175280	So that's pretty awesome.
4175280	4179080	I think that's kind of how they were originally talking, you know, advertising that feature
4179080	4183040	when they were talking about PlayStation 4 initially.
4183040	4189480	The other thing which is kind of cool is they're going to be allowing you to upload 60 frames
4189480	4195800	per second video for share play and remote play to daily motion.
4195800	4196800	So that's pretty cool.
4196800	4204640	And I guess also that button remapping will be pretty nice for accessibility as well.
4204640	4207760	That is awesome that they're doing that on a system-wide level.
4207760	4212480	So the games that fail to remember to put something so easy into the game, not a problem
4212480	4213480	anymore.
4213480	4214480	Yeah.
4214480	4221380	Or say a game offers you certain button configurations and you just don't like it, you want something
4221380	4225600	of your own, then you can do that.
4225600	4230760	Moving on, talking about what's happening with Nintendo while we all wait for that PS4
4230760	4233240	firmware release because it isn't out yet, but soon.
4233240	4234800	I think in like April maybe.
4234800	4238340	Some people making a really big deal about that suspend resume thing because it was something
4238340	4240840	they announced at the beginning and then it never came out.
4240840	4244240	Am I the only one that like kind of forgot that that was supposed to be a thing on PlayStation
4244240	4245240	4?
4245240	4246240	Yeah.
4246240	4248240	But you know, some of the people, there's always those two camps of people and to be
4248240	4252920	fair, I know there's people that do this to Microsoft and as well, but man, there's some
4252920	4256460	people out there that just like every little thing Sony does, they just, they'll take the
4256460	4258820	opportunity to jump down their throat.
4258820	4261040	And I know people that do that with Nintendo too, like Loki.
4261040	4267080	Well, I am a bit bugged when they announce features and this is specifically for Sony
4267080	4272680	in this case, you know, they announce features and then they don't end up releasing with
4272680	4273680	those features.
4273680	4277560	I'd rather they just don't announce those features and then put it out and then, oh
4277560	4278560	hey, we did this.
4278560	4281320	I was talking with somebody about this at PAX East.
4281320	4285760	This is why our industry is so fucking secretive, by the way, the video game industry.
4285760	4289920	This is why there are so many secrets because any little thing that gets out becomes an
4289920	4295000	expectation and becomes, you know, this thing that is judged and put out there for, you
4295000	4297920	know, the cynical game reverse that's out there, of which there's a lot of.
4297920	4298920	Well, it's fine.
4298920	4301920	It's fine if like they could say, you know, initially when they're talking about, yeah,
4301920	4304920	we're these power saving features and what we're working on, we're trying to get this,
4304920	4307920	you know, resume suspend function to work.
4307920	4313180	It may be not necessarily as part of an announcement, maybe like, you know, talking with the hardware
4313180	4317380	developers type piece or something like that, but I'd be fine with that and wouldn't expect
4317380	4318380	them to do that.
4318380	4321340	Like, well, we're trying to get that to work, you know, we'll see, you know, it's probably
4321340	4324460	not something that's going to be at launch, you know, or even if they're announcing a
4324460	4328060	feature like, oh, the resume suspend thing, you know, all this is not going to be at launch.
4328060	4330860	This will be coming later on, you know, something we're working on.
4330860	4336460	I don't believe that was ever outlined, you know, it's more of like, ah, the console releases
4336460	4337460	in two weeks.
4337460	4339460	Oh, by the way, this is not going to be part of the launch thing.
4339460	4340460	All right.
4340460	4346020	Well, let's move on to Nintendo and Loki is going to try very hard to not find something
4346020	4347820	to complain about with these stories.
4347820	4354420	Hey, I am, I, I am very fair.
4354420	4355420	Sure you are.
4355420	4356420	Sure you are.
4356420	4357420	All right.
4357420	4360060	Uh, let's talk about Splatoon, which of course is coming out on the Wii U later this year,
4360060	4364580	which by the way, huge line to play that at PAX East, Splatoon, and I'm kind of thinking
4364580	4366660	like why the game's out next month.
4366660	4370180	And I just, I don't know, I just, it was the same demo that they had had at E3 and I was
4370180	4374420	kind of, I was happy just watching other people play it going, I get an idea what this probably
4374420	4375420	game is like.
4375820	4379420	I'll probably check it out when it comes out on the Wii U, but I'm sure this, this is not
4379420	4380420	a secret anyway.
4380420	4384020	Uh, this is, this is one of those very non surprising things.
4384020	4389220	However, a Splatoon eShop listing showed up and shows that Splatoon will be supporting
4389220	4390860	the amiibo.
4390860	4392820	I'm sure this is surprising nobody.
4392820	4398420	Uh, it is not an official confirmation, however, but come on, come on, amiibo and Splatoon.
4398420	4400020	This is Nintendo's huge thing now.
4400020	4403820	So of course I'm sure the amiibo are going to do something in Splatoon.
4403820	4407820	Uh, the pages were then quickly taken down after they were discovered, which, you know,
4407820	4411620	just means it was true, or else what would they have had to be afraid of?
4411620	4418020	Um, also apparently there was a, a retailer out there called Raru, uh, that had a Splatoon
4418020	4419020	amiibo pages.
4419020	4423420	There was a Splatoon squid girl and a boy that were going to be released at the end
4423420	4424420	of May.
4424420	4428220	So maybe Splatoon was actually going to get its own dedicated amiibo, or still is going
4428220	4429920	to get its own dedicated amiibo.
4429920	4435320	If they are, uh, A, I hope we can find them, and B, I'm sure more information will come
4435320	4437720	on that in a Nintendo Direct soon.
4437720	4440820	You know, though, for all the complaining I've done about amiibo here on the show, which
4440820	4446320	I still believe is, is justified, when Nintendo wants certain amiibo to be available, they're
4446320	4447320	not that hard to find.
4447320	4452220	Like, if you, you can go to Target and get Mario, Pikachu, Zelda, you know, you can get
4452220	4458160	a lot of those pretty easy, and I imagine, like, you know, some of the Mario Party characters
4458160	4462860	probably won't be so difficult either, uh, and if these Splatoon people are, are released,
4462860	4465420	then I'm sure they won't be too hard to find either.
4465420	4470660	It's all those niche characters that are the ones that, of course, the gaming fanboys and
4470660	4475660	fangirls just, they have to have in their collection, because I'm cool enough for school
4475660	4480660	to know, you know, when they were still making Mega Man games, and all these sorts of things,
4480660	4484460	that, that causes frenzy, and then Nintendo does, can't print enough of them, because
4484460	4487660	there's only so much shelf space or whatever, I don't know.
4488660	4491160	Random amiibo tangent, sorry for that.
4491160	4493160	And here I thought Loki would be the one complaining.
4493160	4494160	Sorry about that.
4494660	4497660	But hey, nothing to complain about with this, because this series is fantastic.
4497660	4502160	It's Mother, also known as Earthbound Zero, which is the first one.
4502160	4506660	Of course, the soundtrack to these Mother games, uh, are always really kind of trippy
4506660	4512160	and fun, and, uh, the official soundtrack to Earthbound Zero was never released outside
4512160	4513160	of Japan.
4513160	4520660	However, what's happening with this, a record label named Ship-to-Shore Fanoko has obtained
4520660	4527160	the licensing rights to this Mother soundtrack album, and they have taken to Kickstarter
4527160	4533660	to officially release the Mother official soundtrack outside of Japan and on vinyl.
4533660	4537660	So if the Kickstarter does well enough, they might consider releasing soundtracks for other
4537660	4541160	video games on vinyl as well, including the rest of the Mother series.
4541160	4543660	So you can check that out on Kickstarter if you want.
4543660	4546660	Uh, trying to get an update on where they're at right now.
4546660	4547660	Oh, they made it.
4547660	4548660	So it looks like this is happening.
4548660	4549660	Their goal was 42,000.
4549660	4552660	They're at 48,000 with 24 days to go.
4552660	4555660	So they're, they'll probably beat that goal by quite a bit.
4555660	4559660	That's pretty awesome that they're going to be releasing those on vinyl.
4559660	4564660	It's also pretty disappointing that Nintendo still doesn't give a shit about releasing
4564660	4565660	those titles.
4565660	4571160	They, isn't, isn't that something when you, when you actually see money being made on
4571160	4576160	the internet off this and yet, I don't know, I guess they just feel there's more bang for
4576160	4579160	the buck and focusing on Amiibo or something, which shouldn't, to be fair, they're probably
4579160	4581160	here's what I think that they need to do.
4581160	4586160	Then get a fucking B team develop development team or something like, you know, don't they
4586160	4589160	have like four or five R and D teams inside Nintendo.
4589160	4591660	I think here's an idea and I'm going to throw this out there.
4591660	4593160	It's going to sound a little, here it is.
4593160	4594160	Here it is, folks.
4594160	4595160	Here it is.
4595660	4599660	I thought instead of producing Miyamoto's fucking terrible ideas, like, and I'm not
4599660	4603660	saying like he has great ideas, but the two, wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
4603660	4607660	You just said a Miyamoto's terrible ideas.
4607660	4610660	The man behind Super Mario Brothers.
4610660	4612160	And yes, yes.
4612160	4616160	Let's give him a pass on every single idea that he comes up with because he made Super
4616160	4617160	Mario Brothers.
4617160	4621660	Oh, as I said at the beginning of the show, every developer has a couple of stinkers once
4621660	4622660	in a while.
4622660	4623660	I've got two couples.
4623660	4628160	I have his couple of stinkers right here that he showed off at E3 for an extended period
4628160	4629160	of time.
4629160	4630160	Oh, fuck you.
4630160	4631160	You don't want to know anything about Star Fox.
4631160	4632160	It'll be good though.
4632160	4636660	But let me show you this, these, my personal projects that I really care about.
4636660	4637660	They're fucking terrible.
4637660	4643660	Which was a direct response to everybody saying they wanted to see the Wii U game pad being
4643660	4644660	used more.
4644660	4648660	That wasn't to quell some type of Miyamoto ego issue.
4648660	4653660	That was to shut the fucking stock investors up because they were saying that they didn't
4653660	4655660	understand the point of the game pad.
4655660	4656660	All right.
4656660	4657660	Anyway, anyway.
4657660	4658660	Okay.
4658660	4659660	Anyways.
4659660	4660660	Project watch fucking piece of shit.
4660660	4661660	You don't need that.
4661660	4663660	It's going to be Five Nights at Freddy's already did.
4663660	4668660	And number two, whatever the fucking robot fighting game that he's doing is also garbage.
4668660	4672660	So take the people that are going to be making those games and put them on a new mother game.
4672660	4675660	You can't tell me that there's not anyone's command.
4675660	4676660	You know what?
4676660	4678660	Nobody wants to see those games instead of a new mother game.
4678660	4680660	No one is going to say that.
4680660	4681660	Nobody.
4681660	4683660	No one is going to say, I really want to play project watch.
4683660	4690660	I really want to defend some arbitrary building from Rob the robot.
4690660	4694660	I'm going to, I'm going to poke at this Loki, because I know there's many Nintendo fanboys
4694660	4697660	sitting out there with steamed faces right now at what you're saying.
4697660	4699660	And you need to consider this.
4699660	4706660	Nintendo is trying to broaden the audience than just cult gamers who want cult games.
4706660	4710660	And so by some of these Wii U projects, the thought is, and we don't really know until
4710660	4715660	they're out there and get to test the audience, will this bring more people to the Wii U that
4715660	4716660	don't already own one?
4716660	4717660	You're right.
4717660	4719660	Because that really worked well with Wii Music, didn't it?
4719660	4721660	They tried to broaden the audience with that.
4721660	4723660	No, no, no, no.
4723660	4724660	Apples and oranges.
4724660	4725660	Apples and oranges.
4725660	4727660	No, it wasn't apples and oranges.
4727660	4728660	They thought they could recapture the...
4728660	4731660	The Wii had already sold 11 billion copies.
4731660	4735660	They, oh, and it shouldn't have been a problem to have that game be a success then, because
4735660	4739660	even a mart, you know, a small fraction of the people that own the Wii U could have,
4739660	4742660	or the Wii, could have bought, you know, Wii Music.
4742660	4743660	But guess what?
4743660	4745660	Nobody fucking bought that game.
4745660	4746660	It was terrible.
4746660	4748660	And it didn't broaden any audiences.
4748660	4752660	It was just like, oh hey, we're going to recapture the fire that we had with Wii Sports, and
4752660	4753660	we're just going to apply it to this.
4753660	4756660	And people will buy it because it's like Wii Sports.
4756660	4761660	So, I just think if they save their time from producing those two games, hey, Star
4761660	4762660	Box is going to be amazing.
4762660	4767660	And I'm sure a lot of the things that Miyamoto does are amazing, but I wouldn't waste my
4767660	4768660	time on these tech demos.
4768660	4770660	It's just not going to work out.
4770660	4776660	All right, as expected, as usual, Loki's Rants getting a variety of responses in chat.
4776660	4780660	And, you know, some supporting you, Loki.
4780660	4784660	We've got Bonds006 saying thank you, Loki, for that rant.
4784660	4788660	And YYR saying this episode would not be complete without a Loki Nintendo rant.
4788660	4790660	I'm glad this is still a complete episode.
4790660	4796660	And then the other side of it, AkumaJP saying please play the game first before you slam
4796660	4797660	it.
4797660	4800660	What, Wii Music, or are we talking about this?
4800660	4802660	I'm assuming these Wii U prototypes.
4802660	4806660	Okay, I'll play Project Watch when it comes out.
4806660	4808660	Eventually, whenever that is.
4808660	4809660	All right, I'm holding you to that.
4809660	4810660	I'm holding you to that.
4810660	4813660	Okay, I'll play it, and I'm sure I will love it.
4813660	4815660	I'll be like, oh my god, Miyamoto made this?
4815660	4816660	I have to love it.
4816660	4819660	I have to love it.
4819660	4824660	Let's see, and Kaijuto saying I don't even know what the heck Mother is, so I'm not looking
4824660	4825660	for a remake of it.
4825660	4828660	They called Mother 2 Earthbound here in the US.
4828660	4829660	That's what that is.
4829660	4833660	And Akdeft saying Wii Music was a failed tech demo.
4833660	4835660	So, there you go.
4835660	4841660	But these two games that, I mean, projects he's working on, wouldn't those technically
4841660	4842660	be a tech demo?
4842660	4846660	Because it certainly looked like a tech demo to me.
4846660	4853660	I, I think it's, honestly, I think it's too soon to say, because sometimes, especially
4853660	4857660	Nintendo does this, they put out one tiny little part of their game that becomes a much
4857660	4858660	bigger thing.
4858660	4861660	But Nintendo has also listened to feedback, and sometimes they'll put out a tech demo
4861660	4863660	and then end up not doing anything with it.
4863660	4866660	Wii Vitality Sensor.
4866660	4870660	So, they must believe in these and that there's full games in there somewhere if they're
4870660	4872660	going to actually end up releasing the games.
4872660	4873660	So, we'll see.
4873660	4874660	We'll see, Loki.
4874660	4877660	I can't wait to see your beaming reaction to playing those.
4877660	4882660	I don't think we'll actually ever see Project Watch or this robot fighting game.
4882660	4884660	It will end up being whatever Nintendo Land 2 is.
4884660	4887660	What about, what about, are you going to hate on everything Nintendo?
4887660	4889660	What about Zelda, Wii U?
4889660	4891660	No, I didn't say I hated everything in Nintendo.
4891660	4894660	I'm just saying these specific two projects are fine.
4894660	4899660	I love Miyamoto and his stuff, but I'm just saying, maybe not Pikmin, but I love everything
4899660	4900660	else.
4900660	4906660	I'm just saying that these two projects in particular are a waste of time.
4906660	4908660	All right.
4908660	4909660	Moving on.
4909660	4913660	Again, it's only a three-hour show, not a 30-hour show.
4913660	4914660	Let's move on with some more stories.
4914660	4917660	Loki, what is coming out that a lot of people are going to be playing, probably?
4917660	4920660	Well, there's actually some decent stuff coming out.
4920660	4921660	Soccer moms everywhere.
4921660	4923660	Going to check this game, I'm not sure.
4923660	4928660	I'd say it's kind of up my alley, but Battlefield Hardline is going to be coming
4928660	4935660	out this week on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.
4935660	4945660	Also, Resident Evil Revelations 2 on PlayStation 3, and I believe PlayStation, or Xbox 360,
4945660	4949660	Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.
4949660	4952660	Those will be the disc versions of the game, because I want to say that they've already
4952660	4953660	been out digitally.
4953660	4956660	What else?
4956660	4960660	I think that might have actually been it.
4960660	4965660	I want to see if I'm missing any other releases here, but I think that's it.
4965660	4970660	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio at vognetwork.com,
4970660	4973660	use the passphrase, save.
4973660	4976660	Before I get to the Japanese release...
4976660	4977660	I did miss one.
4977660	4981660	And I'm sorry, it is ironic that it is also Nintendo, but Mario Party 10 will be coming
4981660	4982660	out this week.
4982660	4983660	Oh, is that this week?
4983660	4984660	That is on the 20th.
4984660	4985660	That would be Friday.
4986660	4989660	I need to, it looks like we might have some guests coming to the show here, spur of the
4989660	4992660	moment here, so while I get that worked out, do you want to maybe talk a little bit about
4992660	4996660	Mortal Kombat X, and then I'll come back and talk about the Japanese releases.
4996660	4997660	Absolutely.
4997660	5003660	So, Mortal Kombat X is pretty awesome, and we've been kind of waiting, you know, especially
5003660	5007660	with the last Mortal Kombat game, they had all these guest characters that were coming
5007660	5010660	in there, and kind of speculation is, who's going to be the next guest character?
5010660	5012660	We had Freddy Krueger last time.
5012660	5015660	You know, wouldn't it be awesome if we had, you know, Jason Voorhees or something like
5015660	5016660	that?
5016660	5021660	And sure enough, you know, they picked the perfect day to release it, you know, the information
5021660	5026660	on Friday the 13th, they announced that Jason Voorhees will be the first guest character
5026660	5031660	that will appear in Mortal Kombat X, and they had a nice little trailer that went with that.
5031660	5039660	It's going to be part of the Kombat Pack that will include Jason as well as two other classic
5039660	5044660	Kombatans, and they're going to have another guest character, and that seems like kind
5044660	5047660	of a waste of money now that I look at that.
5047660	5049660	But $30 for that.
5049660	5051660	$30 for four characters.
5051660	5054660	That seems awfully expensive.
5054660	5055660	That's dumb.
5055660	5056660	Oh, hey!
5056660	5058660	Where did that voice come from?
5058660	5060660	We have some guests here in studio.
5060660	5061660	What voice?
5061660	5062660	What voice?
5062660	5063660	Hey, how you doing?
5063660	5064660	It's Princess Irene joining us tonight.
5064660	5065660	Hi.
5065660	5066660	How are you doing?
5066660	5067660	Doing pretty well.
5067660	5068660	How are you?
5068660	5069660	Just texting me like, hey, I was in the neighborhood.
5069660	5070660	Want me to stop by?
5070660	5071660	Yeah.
5071660	5072660	That's exactly what happened.
5072660	5073660	That's exactly what happened.
5073660	5074660	Well, how are you doing?
5074660	5076660	What brings you to the neighborhood tonight?
5076660	5081660	Oh, we were at the Marvel Universe Live, and then I was trying to leave our mutual friend
5081660	5082660	Jim's house, and we went the wrong way.
5082660	5083660	We went the wrong way.
5083660	5086660	And so we're like, you know, Rob lives over here.
5086660	5087660	Go there.
5087660	5088660	Why not?
5088660	5089660	Wait a minute.
5089660	5090660	You mean Flacco?
5090660	5091660	No, other Jim.
5091660	5092660	Oh, oh, oh.
5092660	5093660	Oh, oh, oh, yeah.
5093660	5095660	Oh, he's not far from here at all.
5095660	5096660	No, no, no.
5096660	5097660	You're kind of in the right area.
5097660	5098660	Yeah.
5098660	5099660	We were just going in the wrong direction.
5099660	5102660	Hey, and also joining us, all these random voices.
5102660	5103660	Whoa.
5103660	5104660	A wild Mystique approaches.
5104660	5105660	How you doing, Mystique?
5105660	5110660	We haven't had you on the show ever since we were, I think, at the studio that was at
5110660	5111660	Jamie's house years ago.
5111660	5112660	Yep.
5112660	5114660	I'm usually traveling with a wild Dan.
5114660	5115660	Yes, you are.
5115660	5116660	Her husband.
5116660	5117660	How are you?
5117660	5118660	Pretty good.
5118660	5119660	Yeah?
5119660	5120660	How was Marvel Live?
5120660	5121660	It was pretty cool.
5121660	5122660	Yeah.
5122660	5123660	What do they do with those things?
5123660	5124660	Yeah, the first five minutes were awesome.
5124660	5125660	Oh, no.
5125660	5126660	Oh, God, you went too, huh?
5126660	5127660	We'll get to that later.
5127660	5128660	Uh-oh.
5128660	5129660	Uh-oh.
5129660	5130660	All right.
5130660	5131660	It's nothing.
5131660	5132660	It's no fault.
5132660	5133660	It's a fault of my own genetics, unfortunately.
5133660	5139340	Let's just say that I pissed away over $200.
5139340	5140340	Meaning that after-
5140340	5141340	You bought everything there.
5141340	5142340	No.
5142340	5143340	No, no, no.
5143340	5144340	No, no, no.
5144340	5145660	The kid had to go to the bathroom five minutes into the show.
5145660	5148580	No, the kid got scared five minutes into the show.
5148580	5151500	We had to leave, and I had nice ass seats.
5151500	5154620	There were five rows from the floor.
5154620	5155620	That's your bad.
5155620	5156620	It was fantastic.
5156620	5157620	It was so fun.
5157620	5158620	It was lots of fun.
5158620	5159620	It was fun.
5159620	5161820	The first five minutes sucked, but the rest was so good.
5161820	5163180	No, no, it was awesome.
5163180	5165620	It was just too loud and too scary for-
5165620	5167420	What do they do at Marvel Live?
5167420	5168420	They play fight.
5168420	5169420	They have stuntmen.
5169420	5170420	So it's like wrestling?
5170420	5171420	It's like a stunt show.
5171420	5172420	Well, don't they do-
5172420	5177220	It's more as I like to say, it's like Disney on ice, but it's Marvel, but it's not on ice.
5177220	5179140	But Marvel's owned by Disney now, so it's-
5179140	5180140	Kind of technically.
5180140	5181140	So it's Disney on ice without the ice.
5181140	5182140	There you go.
5182140	5183140	So Disney on.
5183900	5187180	It's like one of those stunt shows that you see at Universal Studios or something like
5187180	5188180	that.
5188180	5189180	Oh, with monster trucks?
5189180	5190180	Yeah.
5190180	5191180	They didn't have trucks in-
5191180	5192180	Actually, motorcycles.
5192180	5193180	Dirt bikes.
5193180	5194180	Oh, it was so cool.
5194180	5195180	Cool.
5195180	5196180	Yeah, I wanted to see it, but-
5196180	5197180	I went to a hockey game over the weekend.
5197180	5198180	I had fun with that.
5198180	5199180	That's really cool, Rob.
5199180	5201180	Actually, it wasn't that cool because our team got fucking clobbered.
5201180	5202180	They choked.
5202180	5203180	I felt like I was watching a Kings game.
5203180	5204180	It was so awful.
5204180	5206420	Wait, are you saying that a hockey game's not cool?
5206420	5207420	Wow.
5207420	5208420	No, hockey's fun.
5208420	5209420	You're not cool.
5209420	5210420	All right.
5210700	5213140	You should already be used to a Kings game not sucking.
5213140	5214140	All right, look.
5214140	5217540	By the way, I'm talking about the Sacramento Kings, not the LA Kings, but the LA Kings
5217540	5218540	suck too.
5218540	5219540	All right, anyway.
5219540	5220540	Who are the LA Kings?
5220540	5221540	Hockey.
5221540	5222540	You've never heard of hockey?
5222540	5223540	Oh, what's hockey?
5223540	5224540	I don't know what hockey is.
5224540	5227620	Did you ever play Blades of Steel, one of the greatest NES games ever?
5227620	5229340	Oh my God, did I ever.
5229340	5230340	There you go.
5230340	5231340	Oh, that hockey.
5231340	5232340	Duh.
5232340	5234340	Why didn't you just say Blades of Steel?
5234340	5235340	Jeez.
5235340	5239100	Okay, so I don't know if you know this, but Blades of Steel is based on something that
5239100	5240100	people do.
5240780	5244180	Now, I know you're in California, so this is a hard concept for you to believe, but
5244180	5251620	having just got back from fucking Boston a week ago, sometimes the water freezes over
5251620	5253780	and people skate on it.
5253780	5254780	Is it magic?
5254780	5255780	It's like Disney on Ice.
5255780	5262280	Yeah, it's like, okay, it's like Disney on Ice, except the princesses punch each other
5262280	5264100	and the blood bounces on the ice.
5264100	5265100	Oh my gosh.
5265100	5266100	That's hockey.
5266100	5271540	I would pay money to see the Disney princesses in an all out brutal hockey game.
5271540	5272540	I wouldn't.
5272540	5274940	That does not sound like fun at all.
5274940	5275940	It could be.
5275940	5276940	All right.
5276940	5282940	Anyway, our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, let's see, SJ100Matt saying Rob has gone to
5282940	5285860	more NHL games this year than I have.
5285860	5289720	Some folks in chat, DarkTests2us saying shots fired.
5289720	5291980	And let's see, YYR saying, so it's like roller games.
5291980	5292980	You ever been to roller games?
5292980	5294980	Oh my God.
5294980	5295980	Roller games.
5296860	5297860	It was an NES game.
5297860	5298860	Right?
5298860	5299860	Where you could be that fat guy.
5299860	5300860	Maybe.
5300860	5301860	I don't know.
5301860	5302860	Shut up.
5302860	5303860	It's a game.
5303860	5304860	Look it up.
5304860	5305860	Chat room.
5305860	5306860	Roller games is an NES game.
5306860	5307860	Hashtag look it up.
5307860	5308860	All right.
5308860	5311020	But that was a fantastic game too.
5311020	5312020	All right.
5312020	5314460	Let's get you ladies caught up on everything we've talked about on OLR tonight.
5314460	5318860	I would like you to quickly in one sentence or less, give your reaction to the following
5318860	5319860	stories.
5319860	5320860	All right.
5320860	5321860	Here we go.
5321860	5322860	Yes.
5322860	5323860	What kind of video games have you played this week?
5323860	5324860	Irene?
5324940	5329940	I've played Luminous Electronic Symphony and other things that I can't remember.
5329940	5330940	Mystique?
5330940	5331940	Words.
5331940	5332940	Words.
5332940	5333940	All right.
5333940	5338740	So Mavis Beacon teaches typing or typing of the dead or...
5338740	5339740	Words with friends.
5339740	5340740	Words with friends.
5340740	5343340	I have not had time to play games because I'm too busy doing homework.
5343340	5346260	Why are you even on the show?
5346260	5347860	Because you made me get on the show.
5347860	5348860	That's true.
5348860	5349860	Sorry.
5349860	5350860	Cause she's fun.
5350860	5351860	All right.
5351860	5353860	Rock band four has been confirmed.
5353860	5354860	What?
5357860	5358860	Okay.
5358860	5359860	All right.
5359860	5360860	Let's see.
5360860	5363860	EA closed Maxis, the developers of SimCity.
5363860	5364860	Oh no.
5364860	5365860	God no.
5365860	5367860	What are we going to do now?
5367860	5368860	I guess play something else.
5368860	5369860	You can't be serious.
5369860	5370860	Let's see.
5370860	5376580	Konami has shut down the service Programmed World that allowed BeatMania 2DX machines
5376580	5378860	past Linkle to work here in the US.
5378860	5379860	Okay.
5379860	5380860	What?
5381860	5384860	Do you not have any opinions on anything going on in games?
5384860	5385860	No.
5385860	5386860	Let's see.
5386860	5388860	What did you think of Marvel Universe Live then?
5388860	5389860	Oh my God.
5389860	5390860	It was so good.
5390860	5391860	You guys.
5391860	5393860	Like it was, I didn't know what to expect.
5393860	5394860	It was off the hook.
5394860	5395860	It was off the hook.
5395860	5396860	It was off the chain.
5396860	5397860	It really was.
5397860	5398860	It was.
5398860	5400360	Like I thought it was going to be like for kids like, okay, this is going to be stupid,
5400360	5404500	but it was so action packed and exciting and like it was, you know, a riot.
5404500	5405500	It was awesome.
5405500	5408620	It was like watching your cartoon come to life.
5408620	5409620	Right.
5409620	5413340	It was full of puns and clever one liners and just, it was so good.
5413340	5415740	You know what else is action packed and exciting?
5415740	5420740	Mortal Kombat X. Jason Voorhees is going to be a character in Mortal Kombat X.
5420740	5422740	Is it going to be space Jason?
5422740	5423740	No.
5423740	5424740	I don't think it's because Freddy.
5424740	5425740	That's the Jason X.
5425740	5429060	It could be one of the, uh, the, uh, costumes because they're supposed to have different
5429060	5430060	costumes.
5430060	5431340	Freddy Krueger was in the last Mortal Kombat game.
5431340	5434100	Well that would make sense because Jason X was space Jason.
5434100	5435100	So it's Mortal Kombat X.
5435100	5436660	So they should have like, duh.
5436660	5437660	All right.
5437660	5438660	Makes sense.
5438700	5439940	That movie was not very good.
5439940	5441940	Look, let's not talk about that.
5441940	5442940	Okay.
5442940	5443940	Cause I will scream.
5443940	5444940	All right.
5444940	5447460	Picking up where we left off with release dates for Japan.
5447460	5450020	We'll check in with these ladies throughout the show with the other news.
5450020	5451940	Maybe I'll let Irene promote her own show.
5451940	5453420	Mystique, do you have a podcast too?
5453420	5454420	Everybody's got a podcast these days.
5454420	5455420	Shut up.
5455420	5456420	Um, no.
5456420	5457420	Okay.
5457420	5458420	Well maybe.
5458420	5459420	I forgot to mention.
5459420	5460420	She's stuck on one.
5460420	5461420	What?
5461420	5462420	Since I didn't quite get done there.
5462420	5464760	Um, Mortal Kombat X has been delayed on Xbox 360 and PlayStation three.
5464760	5469920	So uh, you'll have to wait longer than April 14th, unfortunately.
5469920	5474220	Well I mean, I think a lot of people are really focusing, especially the audience that would
5474220	5477840	be really into Mortal Kombat and buying these games the day and date they come out.
5477840	5480600	A lot of them are probably already on PlayStation four or Xbox one.
5480600	5485320	So I don't imagine there's a huge audience for the 360 and PlayStation three versions,
5485320	5490040	but I'm sure some people are feeling a little shafted by that, but Hey, as long as it works,
5490040	5491040	that's the most important thing.
5491040	5492480	It's got to work.
5492480	5496180	Time Buster in our chat room over at live.vog network.com talking about Jason saying he
5496180	5502240	should be any S Jason with a purple jumpsuit and a blue mask that, okay, that was a frightening
5502240	5504240	ass Jason.
5504240	5505240	That game.
5505240	5506240	Okay.
5506240	5507240	Look, I know that game gets a lot of shit.
5507240	5508320	I know that game gets a lot of shit.
5508320	5514460	I don't like that game fucking terrified me when I was a kid, it was kind of glitchy and
5514460	5516920	like kind of impossible to win.
5516920	5521060	But like when you are going in that house and it's the quote unquote first person mode
5521060	5524900	in the NES and you turn a corner and Jason is there.
5524900	5525900	You shit your pants.
5525900	5526900	Yes.
5526900	5527900	It is.
5527900	5528900	That's what it sounds like.
5528900	5529900	Yeah.
5529900	5533500	Or when you encounter him on the road, like, fuck, you know, I was looking at a bird one
5533500	5540060	minute and then like, I didn't even cool man, Jason.
5540060	5541060	I agree.
5541060	5542060	I'm in agreeance with you, Rob.
5542060	5543060	So it was scary.
5543060	5544580	It was very scary.
5544580	5545580	Yes.
5545580	5547340	Nothing in Mortal Kombat X would be scarier than purple jumpsuit.
5547340	5548340	Jason.
5548340	5549340	Right.
5549340	5550340	Just jumping out of the forest.
5550740	5551740	Right.
5551740	5552740	And you shitting your pants.
5552740	5553740	Probably.
5553740	5554740	Probably.
5554740	5559860	Hey, Japanese release dates coming out in Japan on the PlayStation 4 on March 19th.
5559860	5563460	Final Fantasy Type 0 HD gets its release in Japan as well.
5563460	5568180	Biohazard Revelations 2, that's what they call Resident Evil over there.
5568180	5572580	As well as Battlefield Hardline all on the PlayStation 4 this week in Japan.
5572580	5577160	On the Xbox 360, Battlefield Hardline there as well and Biohazard Revelations Final Fantasy
5577160	5582640	Type 0 HD and Azito Cross Tatsunoko Legends comes out over there.
5582640	5586160	I did not know that was even something they were making, so that's pretty cool.
5586160	5591280	On the PlayStation 3, Battlefield Hardline and Biohazard Revelations 2.
5591280	5595120	And on the Wii U this week in Japan, I think we finally have some releases over there.
5595120	5599560	We have Mario versus Donkey Kong, Mina de Mini Land comes out in Japan.
5599560	5601260	I imagine that's...
5601260	5604560	They have the Mario versus Donkey Kong, it's like the puzzle series.
5604560	5607600	I imagine that's like an entry in that on the Wii U.
5607600	5611280	And that's the big release on the Wii U this week in Japan.
5611280	5615280	And lastly, looking at the handhelds here, we've got on the PlayStation Vita this week,
5615280	5623680	Norn 9, Norn plus Nonet Last Era, Phantasy Star Online 2 Episode 3 Deluxe Package, pardon
5623680	5627840	me while I fume that Phantasy Star Online Episode 2 is still not out over here.
5627840	5628840	Phantasy...
5628840	5631640	Excuse me, Phantasy Star Online 2 is still not out over here.
5631640	5635760	That was you shitting your pants.
5635760	5636760	Very upset.
5636760	5642760	Minecraft PlayStation Vita comes out in Japan, and Iro Toridori no Sekai Worlds End Rebirth
5642760	5645360	comes out on the Vita this week as well.
5645360	5651000	Lastly, checking the 3DS, the 3DS this week gets Devil Summoner Soul Hackers, gets a price
5651000	5656080	reduction going into the best collection from Atlus, Mario versus Donkey Kong, Mina de Mini
5656080	5657080	Land.
5657080	5660680	I think that's the game with the cross-buy on Nintendo, I think that's what Japan's getting
5660680	5664800	this week, because it's on 3DS and it's on the Wii U.
5664800	5672040	Prepara and Pretty Rhythm, Prepara de Sukairu Oshare Item 1450.
5672040	5676000	I don't know what Item 1450 is, but my god is this game pink.
5676000	5677680	I kind of want it.
5677680	5678680	You should get it.
5678680	5679680	It looks like a rhythm game.
5679680	5682440	It kind of looks like a rhythm game, like a Leap Eat Agents, but all the little icons
5682440	5686520	are hearts, and she sparkles, and like a Leap Eat Agents, there's like a dude in a little
5686520	5689100	beret, like he's dancing, like, hey, I'm dancing.
5689100	5690200	So you're totally getting it.
5690240	5693480	I totally want this, actually, Prepara and Pretty Rhythm.
5693480	5695800	Akuma JP, is this something I want?
5695800	5699680	I have to ask our Japanese correspondent, because he's actually, he would know.
5699680	5702080	Hai, sou desu ne.
5702080	5706560	Thank you, Akuma.
5706560	5711200	Moving on, that was it for releases, but I do want to talk about the UK, I know Dark
5711200	5716960	Sakura's not here tonight, but she will usually talk about what is coming out in the UK, and
5716960	5724240	for March the 19th, Worlds of Magic on the Mac and the PC, and on the 20th of March,
5724240	5730600	Battlefield Hardline on everything, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One PC, Blade Storm Nightmare,
5730600	5736520	Final Fantasy Type 0 HD, Mario Party 10, and Mario vs. Donkey Kong Tipping Stars, which
5736520	5740840	is that same game as the Japanese one I was talking about, and Akuma JP has answered my
5740840	5744640	question as to is this game worth my time, and he says no.
5744640	5745640	Whatever.
5745640	5747920	You can't listen anymore.
5747920	5750480	You do know I love Hatsune Miku, right?
5750480	5753720	And I like some real bad games, I'm just saying.
5753720	5754720	I think you should just...
5754720	5756400	I did just sit here and talk about how much I love Friday the 13th.
5756400	5760080	Did you not even pick up that Sanrio game that was on the 3DS?
5760080	5761080	I wanted to.
5761080	5764600	I kind of want that more than I want Project Steam right now, but...
5764600	5765600	What game is this?
5765600	5766600	Is it the racing game?
5766600	5767600	The Sanrio racing game.
5767600	5769080	Oh my god, it looks so bad.
5769080	5772240	It looks like an eight year old programmed it.
5772240	5773240	It looks so bad.
5773240	5774440	So that means he wants it.
5774440	5775440	Exactly.
5775440	5776440	I get it.
5776440	5777440	I should.
5777440	5778440	So I can play it.
5778440	5779440	Exactly.
5779440	5780440	Aha!
5780440	5783800	Alright, let's do one more story here and then we'll get to the classic game of the
5783800	5784800	week.
5784800	5790920	So, unfortunately, one of the first games that Kenji Inafune had mentioned that they
5790920	5800920	were working on with his new studio, after he left Konami, Capcom, was Kao King of Pirates.
5800920	5803520	That title has been cancelled.
5803520	5809360	So apparently Marvelous had announced that they are scrapping that title.
5809360	5810360	That's unfortunate.
5810360	5811360	Yes.
5811360	5814140	Especially for all the fans of him.
5814140	5815140	That's too bad.
5815140	5816140	It looks pretty cool.
5816140	5818720	Well, you'll never get to play it.
5818720	5822160	Until ten years from now somebody finds it in a vault somewhere and releases it on the
5822160	5823160	internet.
5823160	5824160	Yeah.
5824160	5825160	Oh well.
5825160	5826160	There's always that to look forward to, right?
5826160	5831680	Alright, well let's travel down memory lane and talk about a time that was a little simpler
5831680	5834120	in gaming.
5834120	5836400	The classic game of the week.
5836400	5840120	Back when games came out, even if they were horrible and they weren't scrapped, whatever,
5840120	5843240	no actually a lot of games were scrapped back in the day, but this game wasn't scrapped
5843240	5847240	and it was great and I'm taking over tonight because usually Dark Sakura would step into
5847240	5850200	the vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you should be playing this game this
5850200	5851200	week.
5851200	5857500	But since she isn't here, I'm stealing her segment, wahaha, with a game that I remember
5857700	5861860	And now I'm really regretting this because Irene is going to taunt me endlessly for this
5861860	5862860	pick.
5862860	5863860	Yay!
5863860	5868660	Although, I honestly don't think you know this game whatsoever, but this game was rad.
5868660	5869660	God.
5869660	5870780	Alright, this game was rad.
5870780	5871780	I love this game.
5871780	5875820	I played a lot of it when I was growing up.
5875820	5878020	It is a PC game I've picked tonight.
5878020	5880180	It is a Sierra game that I've picked.
5880180	5882660	You're making a face there.
5882660	5887300	The classic game of the week this week is...
5887300	5888300	Jones in the Fastlane.
5888300	5889300	Oh, God.
5889300	5892700	Have you ever played Jones in the Fastlane?
5892700	5894860	No, I don't play crap.
5894860	5896340	You don't even know what this game is.
5896340	5897340	This game is amazing.
5897340	5898340	Exactly.
5898340	5899340	Shut up.
5899340	5900340	You don't know what you're talking about.
5900340	5901340	Alright.
5901340	5902340	You don't know me.
5902340	5903340	Are we going to get dysentery?
5903340	5904340	You might, from this game.
5904340	5905340	Okay, here it is.
5905340	5910520	Jones in the Fastlane was a game that was created by Sierra in 1990 and it was kind
5910520	5913440	of like a board game-ish type of game.
5913440	5915680	Is it because the people who played it were really bored?
5915680	5919320	No, like a Monopoly type of board game.
5919320	5923620	This game also was notable because there was a floppy disk version that would allow people
5923620	5925900	to have the little speech bubbles when they talked to me.
5925900	5927960	What's a floppy disk?
5927960	5930120	It's... you stick it in.
5930120	5934640	It's a little disk and you stick it in and it's full of data.
5934640	5939060	So like, you know when you save in Word or something and there's that little symbol that
5939060	5940760	nobody knows what it is.
5940760	5941760	Nobody knows what that is.
5941760	5943340	That's totally a floppy disk.
5943340	5944340	What?
5944340	5945340	Right.
5945340	5946900	You mean that same thing?
5946900	5949420	How the fuck do you not know what a floppy disk is?
5949420	5951240	You're older than me.
5951240	5952500	Not to like put you on blast or something.
5952500	5954260	She's only interested in hard drives.
5954260	5955260	Yeah.
5955260	5956260	Hard drives.
5956260	5957260	I see what you did there.
5957260	5958260	Alright, look.
5958260	5960500	Can I talk about Jones in the Fastlane, please?
5960500	5964940	Not only was it a game that you could get on floppy disk, but it was on CD-ROM.
5964940	5968420	And if you got it on CD, it was completely voice acted.
5968420	5972780	All the little employees of the little places you would go on the board, such as Monolith
5972780	5977340	Burger and Socket City, would actually talk to you.
5977340	5980300	Oh, this does not sound good at all.
5980300	5982780	No, this game was amazing.
5982780	5983780	Was it?
5983780	5990980	Stop making fun of this game with, you know, Monolith Burger and Z-Mart and QT clothing.
5990980	5994540	Oh god, it's hurting so bad.
5994540	5998300	So what you did is you moved your little marble because that's what represented you
5998300	5999340	like a real board game.
5999340	6003460	You would move it around the board and as you went to these different places on the
6003460	6005140	board, you were a marble.
6005140	6009860	Yeah, you were represented by a marble, but you actually had a little dude on the screen
6009860	6014820	or doodad if you wanted to play, would walk like as the marbles going, the little dude
6014820	6015820	would walk.
6015820	6020220	It was on CD-ROM and it had voice acting and you were represented by a marble.
6020220	6027820	Because that was supposed to give it the board game feel also because we didn't want
6027820	6035380	to animate anything, but what board game has a fucking marble?
6035380	6037860	Your pieces will just roll off the game.
6037860	6040460	Mouse trap doesn't have a packman board game.
6040460	6043620	It's like a hundred marbles, but it's not your piece.
6043620	6045980	What activated the goddamn mouse trap?
6045980	6047460	It was a fucking marble, Irene.
6047460	6049940	But did it have one that you moved around?
6049940	6050940	I don't know.
6050940	6051940	I don't know.
6051940	6052940	Okay.
6052940	6053940	I fucking own the mouse trap.
6053940	6054940	Rob.
6054940	6057340	Don't fucking try to school me on my own games.
6057340	6058340	Okay.
6058340	6059340	Okay.
6059340	6062420	That is the least logical piece.
6062420	6063420	I feel like for a board game.
6063420	6064700	I'm going to put this on a board.
6064700	6066580	Thank God my board is completely level.
6066580	6067580	Oh, wait.
6067580	6068820	It just rolled off the board.
6068820	6071020	Oh, there I go down the hill.
6071020	6072020	Right.
6072020	6078180	That just would not be my first or second or like ten thousandth choice for a piece.
6078180	6080660	Anyway, monolith burger or something.
6080660	6081660	Yeah.
6081660	6082660	Burger time.
6082660	6087940	So look, you move around the board with your marble with and you're only limited by whatever
6087940	6090180	time is left in the week in a turn.
6090180	6093620	And when you move to a new location, you lose a little bit of time and you do things that
6093620	6095740	you would do like IRL.
6095740	6101180	You would work or you would try to get an education or you would just sleep all day.
6101180	6102180	You can also.
6102180	6103180	That's what I would do.
6103180	6104180	I know.
6104180	6105180	I know that.
6105180	6106180	So your marble wouldn't go anywhere.
6106180	6110020	Your marble would be calling the cable company going, I want my HBO.
6110020	6116060	I can't afford cable.
6116060	6120100	And then at the end of every turn, you would be going through the oh, what a weekend event
6120100	6124420	where you would lose money usually or you might gain money depending on what you did
6124420	6125420	that week.
6125420	6128180	What if you're sleeping and then how would you lose money?
6128180	6129420	It's like a monopoly.
6129420	6132980	You draw a card and you can win ten dollars in a beauty contest, even if you wouldn't
6132980	6133980	actually.
6133980	6135940	It's weird because I never left my house.
6135940	6140460	It's like, did they come into my house and see me on my bed and they're like, man, you're
6140460	6141460	so beautiful.
6141460	6142460	Here's ten dollars.
6142460	6143980	That seems kind of creepy.
6143980	6148220	Well, you would get little humorous anecdotes that was very common for Sierra at the time.
6148220	6152940	For example, you went to Las Vegas in a twenty thousand dollar car and then you came back
6152940	6155940	in a two hundred thousand dollar Greyhound bus.
6155940	6157460	That's huh.
6157460	6158460	Get it?
6158460	6159460	Clever.
6159460	6160460	You lost the car because you went to.
6160460	6161460	Yeah.
6161460	6162460	No, I get it.
6162460	6163460	I'm on board.
6163940	6165940	Dude, where's your car?
6165940	6169740	The object of the game is to be the first player to achieve one hundred percent success.
6169740	6176020	You reach four goals, wealth, happiness, education and career by having a certain amount of money
6176020	6182320	in the bank, happiness by getting other goals like acquiring goods and taking time off work,
6182320	6187420	education by going through all the university things and then career by climbing the career
6187420	6193780	ladder into management participation or whatever at the job.
6193780	6196180	So it sounds like the game of life.
6196180	6197180	It kind of is.
6197180	6199100	Monopoly and marbles.
6199100	6204500	It's like it's like life, monopoly and marbles all together without the pink peg and the
6204500	6206140	blue peg that you put in your car.
6206140	6207140	That's the only thing.
6207140	6208140	You have a marble instead.
6208140	6209140	No deal then.
6209140	6210140	All right.
6210140	6213020	Anyway, sometimes you can lose the game as well.
6213020	6218160	For example, you can get your money stolen by Wild Willy and Wild Willy may actually
6218160	6226340	rip off Wild Willy may actually rip you off at the low cost housing apartments and might
6226340	6228260	steal your TV and your VCR.
6228260	6229260	I'm sorry.
6229260	6230260	This is horrible.
6230260	6232880	I stole the TV.
6232880	6234980	This is no.
6234980	6238840	But Wild Willy can never get into the security apartments.
6238840	6242020	So there you go.
6242020	6246260	The game was notable for having a voice actors that were actually like they were actually
6246260	6249980	like motion captured and they actually would talk through some of the silly little jokes
6249980	6252140	in the game and so forth.
6252140	6256500	But if you were too poor for a CD-ROM drive, which a lot of us were at the time, you could
6256500	6258820	get the version that was on floppy disk.
6258820	6260420	Why did you look at me when you said that?
6260420	6261420	I'm just saying.
6261420	6262420	Fuck Rob.
6262420	6263420	Just wanted you to know.
6263420	6264860	Because you're a poor college student.
6264860	6268020	Just because someone lives in Section 8 housing doesn't mean they're a criminal.
6268020	6269020	Okay.
6269020	6270020	I'm just going to put that out there.
6270020	6272220	What a terrible game.
6272220	6273940	All right.
6273940	6277580	Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
6277580	6281460	Bobby is saying this is the first classic game of the week where the host bashed a choice
6281460	6282460	frown.
6282460	6286820	Hey, first off, those two aren't hosts.
6286820	6288060	And now you know why.
6288060	6290660	It just sounds terrible.
6290660	6292180	And B, you need to play it.
6292180	6296780	And Bobby is actually going on to say, really sucks that people on the show are bashing
6296780	6298140	it and calling it horrible.
6298140	6299660	This game was actually really awesome.
6299660	6301420	And I actually agree.
6301420	6304620	It's you never, you weren't even around to play this game.
6304620	6306860	That's why you never got a chance to get obsessed with it.
6306860	6308540	Well, yeah, because I was poor growing up.
6308540	6310860	I had like a cardboard box for a computer.
6310860	6313900	So don't be mad at the people that can play Jones in the fast lane.
6313900	6320020	Just because to your description of the game, Rob, that's the only experience I have.
6320020	6322100	And it sounds preposterous.
6322100	6323100	It's not preposterous.
6323100	6324980	Do you want a handful of ketchup packets with that?
6324980	6328420	I read off the screen just now.
6328420	6331980	You lost me at marble is what I'm saying.
6331980	6334820	But do you not see the little animated characters that walk on the screen as well?
6334820	6338740	I do, but I also see the marble very clearly and it's kind of just clouding.
6338740	6340340	The marble's just distracting.
6340340	6342260	You are really bothered by that damn marble, aren't you?
6342260	6343260	I'm so fucking bothered by it.
6343260	6345540	You've lost your marbles.
6345540	6348340	You have a degree in junior college.
6348340	6349780	That's going to do a lot for you.
6349780	6350780	The junior college.
6350780	6355060	Oh, this was like in the what, 90s or something or late 80s?
6355060	6357540	Anyway, 1990 is when this game came out.
6357540	6359740	Yeah, so that would have actually had some value.
6359740	6362340	And he didn't get the job because he didn't have enough education.
6362340	6363340	Dumbass.
6363340	6365060	All right.
6365060	6366060	There it is.
6366060	6367060	Your classic game of the week.
6367060	6370260	Jones and the fast lane, which don't listen to these three.
6370260	6373060	This game is actually a lot of fun.
6373060	6375060	It's on YouTube, but you can also check out.
6375060	6378020	Apparently they did like a flash remake of it.
6378020	6381260	Not that long ago in 2006, I guess it was a little while ago.
6381260	6383980	They actually ported this like a version of it over to flash.
6383980	6384980	So you can check this out.
6384980	6389580	Although I don't believe that is something that is officially endorsed, but you can draw
6389580	6394060	your own conclusions by looking it up on like YouTube or I'm just checking out, you know,
6394060	6395540	it makes this game better.
6395540	6396540	Hmm.
6396540	6398100	It had amiibo support.
6398100	6400900	No, no amiibo support in this game.
6400900	6401900	And there you go.
6401900	6403820	That's why I just can't play it then.
6403820	6404820	All right.
6404820	6405820	Sorry to hear that.
6405820	6408660	I also probably can't play because my computer is probably way too fast for that now.
6408660	6412060	And you know, I want me to say, you know, those old games, you try to play them now.
6412060	6414300	It's just like, sorry, your computer's too good to play this.
6414300	6419060	I'm not, I don't think this particular game is available on like good old games, but one
6419060	6422940	of those ones that was archive, didn't they have like that big internet game archive thing
6422940	6425300	that, uh, oh, good question.
6425300	6429780	Uh, I w there were other Sierra games from that timeframe on it, so I don't see why Jones
6429780	6430780	wouldn't be on there.
6430780	6431780	We'll check it out there.
6431780	6435260	Lobby desk version, not the CD version, cause that would be too much space.
6435260	6436420	All right.
6436420	6438180	Not that much space nowadays on the internet.
6438180	6439740	So all right.
6439740	6440740	Well stay tuned guys.
6440740	6441900	We've got plenty more show to come.
6441900	6446380	We have some rapid fire news, the Fuqua question of the week and some more news mailbag a few
6446380	6447380	of the weeks.
6447380	6451020	And yes, a chance for you to call in when we come back after this with more of orange
6451020	6459640	lounge radio live the Boise geeks network.
6459640	6465780	Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live on this March the 15th of 2015 with episode
6465780	6469460	number 590 of our show in progress.
6469460	6473980	Uh, Loki here with me tonight, not here tonight, dark Sakura.
6473980	6479260	Um, but here joining us in studio, um, Irene and mystique who have for the first time in
6479260	6486720	our 590 a year history, uh, ruined the classic game of the week segment here on orange lounge
6486720	6487720	radio.
6487720	6488720	You're gonna have to get used to it.
6488720	6489720	That's all right.
6489720	6493180	Actually, we were talking off air a little bit about like, you know, I was kinda like,
6493180	6497420	now, now seriously now this is why people love this game with the whole like Sierra
6497420	6498420	era and all that.
6498460	6500660	But you were mentioning you play King's quest.
6500660	6501940	So you know that era a little bit.
6501940	6502940	I do.
6502940	6503940	I do.
6503940	6504940	Yeah.
6504940	6507460	I mean, who hates King quest King's quest for now I might let you get away with that
6507460	6511820	sass with Jones and the fast lane, but if this was King's quest for I talked about tonight,
6511820	6513340	I would not be having that sass.
6513340	6517700	There was one that I remember where like you start off in the town and blah, blah, blah.
6517700	6520920	And then there was this pier that you could walk to see that you could go on the ship
6520920	6523100	and then sail to another Island or something.
6523100	6527340	And then there was like this one part where this kid like tempts you to take a swim.
6527340	6528340	I'm almost positive.
6529260	6530260	I think it is five.
6530260	6534420	And then like you just jump in and you die and it's like, I'm pretty sure it's five.
6534420	6535420	Like I was so mad.
6535420	6539460	I was a lot of King's quest games though, but I just, I guess that was my first experience
6539460	6540460	and I was just so mad.
6540460	6544260	I was like, I was not expecting that cause it was just stupid.
6544260	6547460	There was a certain level of dark humor in a lot of those old Sierra games.
6547460	6551700	You know, it just, I didn't know what triggered it or anything.
6551700	6555100	It was just, I came out of the boat and he's like, Oh, it looks like a really nice day
6555100	6556100	for a swim.
6556100	6559620	I think I'm going to go commit suicide now.
6559620	6561540	You don't notice the little shark fan in the background.
6561540	6562540	Anyway.
6562540	6563540	No, no, I guess I'm stupid.
6563540	6564540	All right.
6564540	6568500	Uh, anyhow, I know you, you gals can't stay a whole lot longer, but I do want to make
6568500	6571060	sure Irene, you have a chance to plug cause you do your own podcast.
6571060	6573260	I want to make sure you have a chance to plug it.
6573260	6577220	Um, I just saw Piper not that long ago and I know he's on the show as well.
6577220	6578900	So tell us about, uh, multi-tap.
6578900	6579980	Oh, okay.
6579980	6582160	So it's like a video game podcast.
6582160	6584580	It's kind of retro, but kind of not.
6584580	6587620	Let me just kind of talk about whatever we want cause we're like that.
6587620	6593380	Um, so it's at ffop.net, which is short for fistful of potions.
6593380	6596220	You could also do fistfulofpotions.net, I guess.
6596220	6597220	I don't know.
6597220	6602780	Um, so come and listen to us cause we're cool and fun and interesting.
6602780	6607300	Now, now when do I get to come on your show and sass all the games that you like?
6607300	6608740	When the fuck ever you want.
6608740	6609740	Awesome.
6609740	6610740	I can't wait.
6610740	6614380	You won't because all of our games are perfect and beautiful.
6614380	6618220	Unless you're having the Super Metroid special when I'm there, I'll find something.
6618220	6619220	We might.
6619220	6621700	We love Super Metroid in the house.
6621700	6622700	I'd be okay with that.
6622700	6623700	I'd be okay with that.
6623700	6624700	All right.
6624700	6627860	Uh, anyhow, tonight, uh, we do not actually have a forum followup segment tonight since
6627860	6629420	we had last week's show off.
6629420	6632420	We're going to table that to next week, but don't forget that you can participate in our
6632420	6636560	forums over at vog network.com slash forums, and we will definitely post some followup
6636560	6639100	topics for us to expand the conversation on.
6639100	6643020	I'm really anticipating we're going to talk a little more on the forums about this whole
6643020	6647500	Konami and programmed world thing because, uh, just the fact that even I admitted there
6647500	6649280	really is not an easy answer to this.
6649280	6653220	I can really truly see like both sides of it where it's like on one hand, I understand
6653220	6657260	how, you know, Konami wants to protect, you know, some of the revenue that they get in
6657260	6661740	Japan and these other agreements, but at the same time, gamers desperate to play these
6661740	6664700	games that get their only option really cut off.
6664700	6666180	So I want to talk and dive deeper into that.
6666180	6669300	So we'll do that on the forums and we'll talk about some of that follow up next week.
6669300	6672380	Uh, but for now we have some rapid fire news.
6672380	6674340	So some quick news stories starting with Loki.
6674340	6675340	All right.
6675340	6679140	Um, so let's start off with, I'm pretty excited about this.
6679140	6683820	Goat Simulator is coming to Xbox one and Xbox 360 cause it runs like shit on my PC.
6683820	6689460	So I'm, I'm down with that and that's going to be sometime in April and they're promising
6689460	6692820	it'll be just as buggy as it is on PC.
6692820	6694980	Will it have all the extra stuff that they put in like the MMO?
6694980	6695980	I think it will, yeah.
6695980	6696980	Oh God, that's great.
6696980	6699100	So I will definitely be picking that up.
6699180	6704300	I think you would like, uh, Goat Simulator, Irene, it's a stupid, stupid game.
6704300	6705300	Yeah.
6705300	6706300	You like stupid stuff.
6706300	6707300	I do.
6707300	6708300	That's why I'm friends with you.
6708300	6712940	You fucking set that up Rob, that was your own fault.
6712940	6713940	I don't think you're stupid.
6713940	6714940	You're cool Rob.
6714940	6721260	And in fan service game news, uh, Oni Chambara Z2 is going to be headed, um, to North America
6721260	6722260	this summer.
6722260	6726960	Um, Europe, it's going to be out in the fall and if you're not familiar with Oni Chambara,
6726960	6732240	it's basically some chick wearing a really skimpy lingerie and a cowboy hat fighting
6732240	6734800	monsters with a samurai sword.
6734800	6735800	All right.
6735800	6736800	I'm in.
6736800	6737800	How's that different from Oni Chambara?
6737800	6739800	No, I know Oni Chambara.
6739800	6746200	They even have DLC outfits that include like one that's two strawberries and a banana.
6746200	6747840	That is all that's covering them up.
6747840	6748840	Two strawberries and banana.
6748840	6749840	Alrighty.
6749840	6760160	Um, and then on the 3DS, uh, Senren Kagura 2 is coming, um, this summer to the 3DS and
6760160	6763720	they're also having some special editions coming out with that as well.
6763720	6769180	Uh, the Double D and Happy Boobs edition will be coming out.
6769180	6771320	So it's about me?
6771320	6776560	It's about, yeah, it's about, uh, chicks that fight each other in their clothes.
6776560	6780640	All you single fellas, um, they're talking about me.
6780640	6788040	I don't know what you're talking about because I'm gay and I play this game, so it sounds
6788040	6789040	like fun.
6789040	6790040	All right.
6790040	6793320	But I'm also for equal opportunity, so I believe we should have men and the clothes fly off
6793320	6794320	as well.
6794320	6795320	I agree.
6795320	6796320	I'm all for that.
6796320	6797320	I would play that game.
6797320	6803920	That would be, um, uh, Akiba, Akibahara, um, or Akiba's Trip.
6803920	6804920	That's what it was.
6804920	6807080	Sexual Close Tossing Part 3.
6807080	6808080	I don't know.
6808080	6809080	Akiba's Trip.
6809080	6810080	That would be the one you'd want to play.
6810080	6811080	That's what it translates to.
6811080	6812080	Anyways.
6812080	6815400	Um, and then of course they have, uh, Chroma Squad that's going to be coming out April
6815400	6816400	30th.
6816400	6822600	This was the Kickstarter game that was kind of like a, uh, Super Sentai sim, if you will.
6822600	6829440	Um, and that's going to be coming out on PC, Mac, and Linux April 30th, so, um, Shane will
6829440	6830440	be happy about that.
6830440	6831440	I'm sure he will.
6831440	6835760	Um, talking about 3DS, uh, and the SpotPass.
6835760	6837380	There is a SpotPass exploit.
6837380	6841840	This actually pisses me off, kinda, because, and I know the old saying hackers gonna hack
6841840	6842840	and I get it.
6842840	6846480	And I also know it wasn't even a hack, it's just a glitch.
6846480	6847480	I know.
6847480	6848480	Well, it still sucks.
6848480	6853160	And I know this sucks for, uh, you know, people who might live in areas where they hardly ever
6853160	6857960	street pass with people, but look, one of my crowning achievements of PAX East is that
6857960	6863760	I finished all those fucking puzzles, finally, 1,502 pieces, mine.
6863760	6868400	I have every puzzle finished, including the one that those jerks at Nintendo dropped on
6868400	6873360	us Sunday morning, the day of the show, the new Monster Hunter puzzle, finished them all.
6873360	6877840	And now to hear that, oh, thanks to this exploit, people will just be able to do that.
6877840	6879560	Well, alright, alright, here's the deal.
6879560	6884280	Uh, you use your special Mii character, like, uh, the Abraham Lincoln Mii that's sent to
6884280	6888560	promote codename Steam in all the StreetPass minigames you own.
6888560	6895320	You turn off StreetPass and SpotPass, delete the Mii, close Mii Plaza, open it again and
6895320	6899400	reactivate, and the Mii character will come right back.
6899400	6903360	So you basically tricked the system into thinking you never got the character in the first place
6903360	6905840	by deleting all traces of it.
6905840	6910320	And, uh, there's, uh, more information on the glitch if you wanna see it on YouTube,
6910320	6913480	and I realize you might be thinking, well, then why are you sharing it here, Rob, on
6913480	6915120	how to do it if it makes you mad?
6915120	6919040	Because it's not like y'all don't know how to use Google, you'd find it anyway, but that's
6919040	6921080	essentially how you do it.
6921080	6922560	But, uh, you know what?
6922560	6926900	My achievement is better than yours if you do this to get all your puzzle pieces.
6926900	6928240	My achievement's better than yours.
6928240	6929240	Uh, nuh-huh.
6929240	6930240	How many puzzle pieces do you have?
6930240	6932240	Well, I'm gonna get them all now.
6932240	6933800	Yeah, thank you, Rob.
6933800	6934800	Ditto.
6934800	6935800	Cheating cheaters.
6935800	6936800	Alright.
6936800	6937800	Anyhow, well, you know what?
6937800	6940320	My 3DS has a dead battery right now, so you won't be getting any from me.
6940320	6941720	Did you even bring your 3DS?
6941720	6942720	No.
6942960	6944960	Mine played that for, like, five months.
6944960	6945960	Jeez.
6945960	6946960	Yeah.
6946960	6947960	Anyway.
6947960	6948960	Aw, you played longer than me.
6948960	6949960	I think this is really cool.
6949960	6955000	Um, this is an innovation in the arcade and, uh, in the arcade industry, and it has to
6955000	6960680	do with, uh, more, um, I guess, I don't wanna say, like, cross-play, but more, like, I guess,
6960680	6966320	synergy between your phone or smart device and the arcade game itself.
6966320	6970320	And who knew it's being brought to us from the music game world and an indie in the music
6970320	6973600	game world that we hear about all the time, Neon FM.
6973600	6977200	I mean, we were hearing about this game, like, 10 years ago, and it seems like now we've
6977200	6979920	got this arcade prototype that's going with it.
6979920	6983960	And the cool thing about Neon FM and what they're showing, and I gotta admit, I really
6983960	6989160	enjoyed this, was that, um, Unit E Technologies, who's, uh, making this game, they're going
6989160	6994040	to be linking the arcade version of the game and a smartphone version of the game.
6994040	6997640	So what you do is, I guess, you, like, you scan a QR code and you can get your avatar
6997640	7000440	and all your information in the game that it imports from your app.
7000440	7004880	But this is really cool as well, is that if the smartphone app recognizes that you're
7004880	7010480	near the machine, I guess, through a Wi-Fi connection or something that it would identify,
7010480	7015680	you can actually play the songs on your phone that the person is playing on the machine
7015680	7017160	at the same time.
7017160	7020320	And then the score that you get on your phone is displayed on the screen.
7020320	7025120	So like, remember back in the day when Para Para Paradise was the, Paradise, Para Para
7025120	7027520	Paradise was the big game that everybody was playing.
7027520	7028520	And like, what would happen?
7028520	7032440	One person would be dancing on the machine and everybody else behind them doing the same
7032440	7033440	thing.
7033440	7037600	Now it's kind of like that, but with your smartphone, you're playing the game and then
7037600	7039440	all the scores display on the screen.
7039440	7043600	So I think that's kind of, kind of neat, kind of a different way to do it.
7043600	7044600	Yeah.
7044600	7047720	So something kind of new and, you know, props to these guys for being the ones to bring
7047720	7048720	it to.
7048720	7053000	I'm glad they're doing it, but at the same time, I think it also kind of, I mean, not
7053000	7057640	that it really needs to have them do it, but it kind of promotes that, oh, let's put
7057640	7062000	more smartphone games in the arcade, like, you know, the fucking Fruit Ninja and Doodle
7062000	7064400	Jump and that nonsense.
7064400	7066680	Now it's like, have it at the same time.
7066680	7070980	It's really exciting to kind of hear about all these initiatives to kind of bring the
7070980	7072240	arcade back.
7072240	7077120	You know, despite however you feel about the Konami situation, the deal is that you have
7077120	7081400	this company, Round One, that's trying to bring that arcade thing back, you know, to
7081400	7084960	all these different places around the country, and that's cool.
7084960	7087960	And then you have this, where you talk about, like, this is a new innovation to try and
7087960	7091400	energize, you know, participation at the arcade.
7091400	7095580	And I think these are ideas that are going to push things forward as opposed to falling
7095580	7100260	further down this hole of ticket redemption games and nothing but, you know, Las Vegas
7100260	7102120	for children, apparently.
7102120	7107900	Anyway, Bonds006 in the chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com saying, Neon FM is the shit.
7107900	7111160	You get the QR code, QR code, excuse me, and when you make an account, you can track your
7111160	7112160	progress.
7112160	7115680	Neon FM is a damn great game, too bad Konami tried to kill it.
7115680	7118880	And Dark Tetsuya saying, I thought this was a great idea.
7118880	7124920	So some people are really liking that idea, I'd like to play this someday, we'll see.
7124920	7132080	Also, this week, a game called Roundabout, which is available on Xbox One, Steam, and
7132080	7137640	the Humble Store, the ESRB changed Roundabout's rating.
7137640	7143400	Roundabout is no longer T for teen, it is now M for mature, and this is due to the volume
7143400	7146200	of blood in the game.
7146200	7153720	Roundabout having more blood than Dark Souls 2, but not as much as Bloodborne, and also
7153720	7155520	less bloody than Manhunt 2.
7155520	7159560	This is all, by the way, these comparisons being made by the developer in a statement
7159560	7162400	on their website, roundaboutgame.tumblr.com.
7162400	7167280	I'm sorry, can you scroll back up, I need to see their banner or whatever.
7167320	7170840	I don't know if this is like cosplays, but it's a Tumblr page, I don't know.
7170840	7172160	No, it's actually in the game.
7172160	7173160	Is it?
7173160	7174160	I haven't played this game.
7174160	7180040	The whole premise of the game is that you're driving the world's first revolving limo.
7180040	7183360	So the limo spins, and it runs over things.
7183360	7188720	But it's kind of like a, like almost a public game, but the whole thing has full motion
7188720	7193880	video cinematics in it that are really cheesy, like from the 70s and stuff like that.
7193880	7195880	I need to see this, I'm gonna check this one out.
7195880	7197680	Now you have really piqued my interest.
7197680	7198680	I know, right?
7198680	7203320	When I hear this news about a game, like it was too violent, I'm like, ooh, maybe I should
7203320	7204320	be playing it.
7204320	7205320	I don't know.
7205320	7206320	Yeah, like, okay, here's the premise right here.
7206320	7211280	Okay, so it's, it's, you know, roundabout is a 70s B-movie game where you drive a constantly
7211280	7216040	revolving limousine, pick up passengers, find secret collectibles, take on dangerous missions,
7216040	7219960	fall in love in an open world puzzle adventure.
7219960	7221960	Sounds right up my alley.
7221960	7223640	That sounds like it's calling my name.
7223640	7224640	Yeah.
7225520	7228200	It's the company that made that game Gun Stringer.
7228200	7229200	Remember that one?
7229200	7230200	The one that was a Kinect game?
7230200	7231200	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
7231200	7237040	Well, as if violence wasn't enough, the game was also slapped with a use of drugs descriptor
7237040	7241320	because there are apparently some jokes in the game where one of the characters eats
7241320	7246920	candy dots in order to make a skeleton appear and the candy dot supplier turns out that
7246920	7248400	he's not a narc.
7248400	7252260	And then there's another scene later on where one character describes another as really
7252260	7253600	strung out.
7254160	7259600	This sounds very incongruous with the rest of the description of the video game, so what
7259600	7260600	the hell, guys?
7260600	7263800	So not only is there blood, there's a little bit of drugs, too.
7263800	7264800	Little bit of drugs.
7264800	7265800	Just a little bit.
7265800	7266800	Yeah, just a smattering.
7266800	7267800	Just enough to get a warning label.
7267800	7268800	Not safe for kids.
7268800	7269800	Right.
7269800	7270800	Right.
7270800	7271800	Because the blood wasn't a big-
7271800	7274160	They have a dedicated esports speedrun mode.
7274160	7278960	They claim it's roundabout as the only official esport endorsed by a talking skeleton.
7278960	7279960	Wow.
7279960	7282000	That's a distinction right there.
7282000	7285320	So we're going to get to the Fugu question of the week here, but I believe you gals are
7285320	7286320	on your way out.
7286320	7287320	We've got to head out.
7287320	7291600	I know you've got to get your tickets now for when the Marvel show returns to town.
7291600	7292600	Right.
7292600	7293600	Definitely.
7293600	7295720	Now would you go see DC Universe live?
7295720	7296720	No.
7296720	7300000	And I can say that because I'm a big DC fan.
7300000	7301560	They just mess it up.
7301560	7302560	They just mess it up.
7302560	7303760	They just fuck everything up basically.
7303760	7305280	I'd go for free.
7305280	7306280	You'd go for free.
7306280	7307920	I wouldn't even go for free.
7307920	7309560	Maybe if you won the tickets on the radio.
7309560	7310560	Right.
7310560	7311560	Not me.
7312120	7314680	I certainly wouldn't sit as close as I did.
7314680	7317240	What if there was violence and the use of drugs?
7317240	7318240	Well then yes.
7318240	7319240	Absolutely.
7319240	7320240	Wouldn't there be?
7320240	7321240	Maybe.
7321240	7322240	No.
7322240	7323240	All right.
7323240	7327440	I always ask our guests at the end of every episode your final thought for the night.
7327440	7329240	So I will extend the same courtesy to you ladies.
7329240	7333400	Thank you for being here tonight even if you decided to hate on my classic game.
7333400	7335200	Mystique, your final thought for the night?
7335200	7338920	I am waiting for Batman Arkham Knight.
7338920	7341040	I think we all are.
7341040	7345360	I won it really bad and they just said it went to M rating and I'm like awesome.
7345360	7347480	It was always going to be M rating.
7347480	7348480	Oh.
7348480	7349480	Awesome.
7349480	7350480	Yeah I knew that.
7350480	7351480	Awesome.
7351480	7355040	And you know maybe it's because of violence and the use of drugs maybe.
7355040	7356040	I hope so.
7356040	7357040	I really do.
7357040	7358040	Yes.
7358040	7360160	I want to be the goddamn Batman.
7360160	7361160	Don't we all.
7361160	7362160	Don't we all.
7362160	7363160	Irene.
7363160	7364160	Princess Irene.
7364160	7365160	Your final thought tonight?
7365160	7368200	I am rated M for violence and use of drugs.
7368200	7369200	There you go.
7369200	7370200	There you go.
7370360	7371360	Alright.
7371360	7374280	Alright well have a safe journey home you guys while we hold down the fort here and
7374280	7375280	finish the show.
7375280	7376280	Thanks.
7376280	7377280	Good luck with Multitap Podcast.
7377280	7378280	Thank you.
7378280	7379280	Thank you.
7379280	7380280	And I'll see you guys soon.
7380280	7381280	Yes.
7381280	7382280	Alright.
7382280	7383280	Hopefully that event I was talking about before that we're going to be broadcasting
7383280	7384280	live at you guys will stop by.
7384280	7385280	I'll be there.
7385280	7386280	Remind me.
7386280	7387280	Alright.
7387280	7388280	Sounds good.
7388280	7389280	Okay.
7389280	7390280	Bye.
7390280	7391280	Okie dokie.
7391280	7392280	Bye.
7392280	7393280	Some of our folks in the chat room agreeing with Mystique's assessment about DC.
7393280	7397200	Brad from Pod Culture saying DC has fucked things up for the past few years now.
7398200	7400200	And Dungeon Buster saying I can't wait for Arkham Knight either.
7400200	7404200	But I'm sure Ben Affleck will do a fine job playing Batman.
7404200	7406200	I don't know.
7406200	7407700	I don't know what to think about all that.
7407700	7410200	Maybe Matt Damon could be the Joker in that universe.
7410200	7413200	No now they have, what's his name, Jared Leto is playing the Joker.
7413200	7415200	Okay Matt Damon could play someone else.
7415200	7417200	Maybe Man Bat.
7417200	7418200	Robin.
7418200	7419200	He would be Robin of course.
7419200	7421200	Oh my god that would be perfect.
7421200	7422200	There would be that gay subtext.
7422200	7423200	That would be perfect.
7423200	7424200	That there was a 60's show.
7424200	7425200	That would be hilarious.
7425200	7427200	Oh they need to do that.
7427200	7428200	Alright.
7428200	7439200	We're going to move on to the foogle question of the week.
7439200	7442760	Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities and we read some
7442760	7445360	of our favorite answers here on the show.
7445360	7448480	And this week we wanted to ask our communities, you know, something that happened the week
7448480	7451960	we were out was that the Playstation 2 celebrated a birthday.
7451960	7455520	It is now 15 years old if you can believe it.
7455520	7460440	So we asked our listeners how important was the Playstation to you as a gamer or did you
7460440	7462180	skip the console?
7462180	7466480	What was the most memorable Playstation 2 game in your opinion?
7466480	7469400	So we're going to get to some of those answers here.
7469400	7472880	Let's start over on Google Plus because Facebook is irritating me right now.
7472880	7478160	So act deaf starting us off on Google Plus saying the PS2 is probably next to the Super
7478160	7479160	Nintendo.
7479160	7480160	It's one of the best consoles of all time.
7480160	7483040	It was a really great system and had a huge library of games.
7483040	7484280	Really good ones too.
7484280	7488120	A lot of new series started on the system and old ones were brought back to life too.
7488120	7490400	Which also makes it hard to just pick one game out of the bunch.
7490400	7494900	But if I have to pick just one, the most memorable of them all would be Katamari Damacy.
7494900	7500120	The simplest of games, the weirdest of games, one of the most unique experiences out there.
7500120	7504680	Our pal Critical Myth from the Critical Myth show, Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, 4 o'clock
7504680	7510540	Pacific 7 Eastern here on VOG, says the Playstation 2 was my first console after the 2600.
7510540	7515280	Not kidding, before that I played in the arcade, Commodore 64, PC games during high school
7515280	7516280	or college.
7516280	7521080	It wasn't until late in the PS2 era that we got one, the Slim Bundle, and have been console
7521080	7522840	gamers since.
7522840	7527360	As for the most memorable game, hard to pin down but I'll go with Final Fantasy XII because
7527360	7532920	it was the last game for the console that I dropped over 100 hours into.
7532960	7536560	Retertainment says for me the Playstation 2 was the video game console I bought with
7536560	7539480	money that I earned from my first job as an adult.
7539480	7543960	I'm not sure, or I'm sure I'm not alone in saying that the Playstation 2 not only served
7543960	7549260	as a video game but also as my first DVD player and for a long time my only DVD player.
7549260	7554120	As far as the most memorable game, Grand Theft Auto Vice City.
7554120	7558600	And Josh Wye replied and said PS2 compared to its predecessor didn't have a wide range
7558600	7559600	of game types.
7559600	7562560	A lot of the games got quite derivative and tired after a while.
7562600	7568080	My most memorable PS2 game was probably EverQuest Online Adventures.
7568080	7572240	Nothing beated the feeling of seeing the sunrise over Freeport for the first time after making
7572240	7575200	the perilous journey from the west of Tunaria.
7575200	7577520	So a lot of answers there over on Google Plus.
7577520	7582520	Let's check out our Facebook answers, except again this page not cooperating with me here
7582520	7584080	on Facebook.
7584080	7587340	Facebook does not want me to read your answers, okay here we go finally got all your comments
7587340	7589040	to load.
7589040	7592520	Bread the Hayes says the Playstation 2 was important to me at the time when I first got
7592520	7593520	it.
7593520	7596080	I think I was trying to get over a break up at the time and playing Castlevania Lament
7596080	7599200	of Innocence for dozens of hours was helpful.
7599200	7602560	Fabrice A says never bought any Playstation because I was into Sega.
7602560	7608280	To this day I still refuse to buy any Playstation because of their advertisement campaign against
7608280	7609720	Dreamcast.
7609720	7613720	Still it would be stupid to deny that Playstation 2 didn't have amazing games and Sony having
7613720	7615720	a huge influence on the gaming world.
7615720	7620720	You know something else to consider Fabrice, Sega puts out games on Playstation now occasionally
7620720	7624520	so I think those rifts from back in the day have passed a little bit.
7624520	7628260	It might be time to let it go.
7628260	7629960	The snow never bothered you anyway.
7629960	7634540	Elliot B says I was a die hard GameCube supporter at the start of the generation but eventually
7634540	7638080	gave in and bought a PS2 and I'm glad since otherwise I wouldn't have been able to play
7638080	7640920	its wonderful selection of rhythm action games.
7640920	7644560	Fifth Dream says I never had much money so I didn't get a PS2 until late in the cycle
7644560	7646760	when a friend sold his to me really cheap.
7646760	7650720	I immediately played the Final Fantasy games from 7 to 10 too all in a row.
7650720	7654320	This was huge for me because I loved Final Fantasy and had missed out on the Playstation
7654320	7655640	1's to that point.
7655640	7660440	I also loved Katamari Damacy and the .hack and GU trilogy on the system.
7660440	7661440	That's a good point.
7661440	7664360	Remember how the Playstation 2 would play Playstation 1 games?
7664360	7666560	It was just totally backwards compatible.
7666560	7670440	Remember when our systems were totally backwards compatible?
7670440	7672320	Now only Nintendo does that.
7672320	7673320	Sorta.
7673320	7676400	Still the old old games but at least hey the Wii games work on the Wii U.
7676400	7678760	We don't have that anywhere else.
7678760	7679880	Anyway let's see.
7679880	7684400	Tiger Caw says I still have an original launch PS2 which still works 100%.
7684400	7687580	The Bouncer was a pretty memorable game because it was one of the launch titles.
7687580	7689800	It was a game that pushed the PS2's hardware with the graphics.
7689800	7692200	It was a fighting game but also cinematics.
7692200	7694360	Enter the Matrix was another game I enjoyed playing.
7694360	7696640	It was the game that was official canon to the Matrix movies.
7696640	7700240	I remember when that came out, Loki and I lived together and you were huge into that
7700240	7701240	game.
7701240	7702240	I had it in GameCube.
7702240	7703240	Yeah.
7703240	7705360	And it was on all the platforms really.
7705360	7706360	Yeah.
7706360	7707360	Let's see.
7707360	7712400	Let's not forget that the PS2 was the first console to bring online multiplayer online
7712400	7714360	via an add-on ethernet adapter.
7714360	7718520	You have to own the PS2 a lot for bringing online multiplayer to consoles for the first
7718520	7719520	time.
7719520	7725480	I usually think Xbox got a little more credit with that just because of Xbox Live.
7725480	7729080	But to be fair, didn't the Dreamcast have Phantasy Star Online?
7729080	7731340	And I think we might have had a little bit of it.
7731340	7736600	But not to discredit Tiger Cost Point because definitely the PS2 started moving that forward
7736600	7743980	and you had a lot more of it than you really did in other places at the time on the PS2.
7743980	7747020	Andy R. says, it was pretty big for me.
7747020	7749260	PlayStation 1 was the first home console I owned.
7749260	7753020	By PlayStation 2, I was middle or high school so it was the first system I spent my own
7753020	7754660	money on to get games.
7754660	7757260	Favorite PlayStation 2 game is probably Valkyrie Profile 2.
7757820	7762620	SSJ100Matt says the PS2 was my entry point into the PlayStation since I skipped the PS1
7762620	7764220	in favor of the N64.
7764220	7768140	I was blown away with the games and the ability to play PS1 games that I couldn't play up
7768140	7769140	till then.
7769140	7771820	My most memorable games were SSX3 and Final Fantasy X.
7771820	7777060	I logged for probably over 100 hours in both games and I still play SSX3 on occasion.
7777060	7780900	Burr replied and said I hated PS2 because I was a Dreamcast fanboy.
7780900	7783980	I think it's a shame so many overlooked the Dreamcast because they were busy waiting on
7783980	7785440	Sony's false hype.
7785440	7787800	That infamous Final Fantasy VII demo took the cake.
7787800	7790800	I'm over it now but it was difficult to stomach at the time.
7790800	7793640	Degenerate Johnny says, all hail Kingdom Hearts.
7793640	7797480	Regretted skipping PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2 surpassed all.
7797480	7801480	Mike C. replied and said I bought the PlayStation 2 because it came with a built-in DVD player.
7801480	7804640	I think a lot of people did that.
7804640	7809340	One of our people on Google Plus kind of made that point that a lot of people were buying
7809340	7813680	the PlayStation 2 because it was a DVD player and that really is probably what passed it
7813680	7816440	despite all the negativity with Sega and so forth.
7816440	7822120	That is what really pushed the PlayStation 2 ahead of the competition.
7822120	7825960	Mike C. continued on saying the one game for PlayStation 2 that blew my mind was Grand
7825960	7826960	Theft Auto 3.
7826960	7829320	It was the first open world game that I ever played.
7829320	7833120	I could go wherever I want, kill whoever I want, steal any car I want.
7833120	7834840	It was dope.
7834840	7839240	Cial replied and said I didn't get a PS2 until the system's price dropped below 50 bucks.
7839240	7841240	So it was a partial pass on the system.
7841240	7842480	Just a few more here.
7842480	7844080	I love this diversity of answers.
7844080	7846200	That's why I'm reading so many here.
7846200	7848800	Hitstun says the PlayStation 2 got me into online gaming.
7848800	7853000	I spent hundreds of hours in Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 making new levels in the Create-A-Park
7853000	7855560	tool and playing them online with my new friends.
7855560	7859560	And Misty says I got a PlayStation 2 about the same time DDR's American Home releases
7859560	7862800	came out and that's what convinced me to get the system at all.
7862800	7866360	While the .hack series of games did a much better job than average of grabbing and holding
7866360	7870800	my attention, if not for DDR, I likely would have never purchased the system at all.
7870800	7874600	I never had the original system and haven't had a PlayStation console since.
7874600	7878480	Most memorable game, the .hack series, because I'm still of the opinion that DDR isn't quite
7878480	7882120	as pure when it isn't played on an arcade machine.
7882120	7886140	And last but not least, Dark Tetsuya says while I don't still have the first PS2 I ever
7886140	7889440	had originally, my current one is still working like a charm.
7889440	7893120	I do still fire up mine on occasion for a round of BeatMania 2DX.
7893120	7898040	Sickstyle is probably my all-time favorite, so my system gets some use still 15 years
7898040	7899040	later.
7899160	7902960	There, whew, that was a lot of answers, but so diverse I had to read them all.
7902960	7905760	Quickly, PlayStation 2 memories, Loki?
7905760	7911280	Um, I guess, granted, if I was San Andreas, I can't, no, there's a lot of really good
7911280	7917220	games that I played on PS2, I mean, the first game I had was Armored Core, so, it was like
7917220	7923400	Armored Core 4, I think, I don't remember which one it was that they launched it with.
7923400	7927520	I don't know, I mean, I think that was it.
7927520	7938560	It was Driver, no, Driver 3 was on PlayStation 2, yes it was, and Katamari, of course.
7938560	7942680	I think some quick ones I would name, since it's the Final Fantasy game no one else named,
7942680	7947480	Final Fantasy XI, for sucking me into MMOs, I mean, granted, yeah, but, you know, it was
7947480	7951320	really cool to see it on the PlayStation as well, and you know, it was kind of a trip,
7951320	7955080	seeing that interconnectivity there, and you know, I'm just such an MMO fan, I have to
7955080	7956300	give that a shoutout.
7956300	7960820	But otherwise, I would also say, you know, I bought a Japanese PlayStation 2 just so
7960820	7965540	I could play Beat Mania 2DX, so I'm kind of with Dark Tetsuya on that one.
7965540	7972660	I would also say, though, for serious reasons, Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy X, both phenomenal
7972660	7976460	games, and for lolsy inside joke reasons, Magic Pen Gel.
7976460	7978660	I love Magic Pen Gel.
7978660	7979660	Right?
7979660	7980660	Right?
7980660	7981660	That's a game they should bring back.
7981660	7982660	Right?
7982660	7984460	Alright, let's get to some more news.
7984460	7987780	We'll try to run through this so we have some time to get to your calls as well.
7987780	7988780	Loki.
7988780	7993780	Okay, this is really disappointing, but apparently Sony is now getting rid of PlayStation Mobile
7993780	7994780	altogether.
7994780	7999180	Now, originally it was that they were dropping support on Android for it, which I could live
7999180	8007420	with, you know, but now they're actually going to be ending the program on, not only Android,
8007420	8008700	but on the Vita.
8008700	8011380	And here's the best part about it.
8011380	8016700	Apparently the content distribution will stop on July 15th, 2015.
8016700	8022260	After September 10th, you will not be able to re-download your purchases.
8022260	8025040	So that kind of sucks.
8025040	8029180	You apparently need to manually authenticate your device for the Vita.
8029180	8035240	You can do that under, I guess, your PlayStation Network System Activation settings.
8035240	8040260	And then on PlayStation Mobile, it says you apparently need to open up the app and launch
8040260	8047260	any purchases after April 10th and before September 10th so that you can still access
8047260	8048780	them after that time.
8048780	8053640	Here's the thing that's really annoying about that as well is that's one of the things Unity
8053640	8058540	had where you can output to PlayStation Mobile and like right now, if I wanted to publish
8058540	8062420	a game or even publish the game that I'm working on, I could do that and, you know, I just
8062420	8067620	have to sign up on their website if I could push to PlayStation Mobile.
8067620	8069500	But now I won't be able to do that.
8069500	8071540	So that kind of sucks.
8071540	8072540	Yeah.
8072540	8076960	And one of the dangers of digital distribution is that, you know, even though a lot of companies
8076960	8080760	have talked about their exit strategy, such as Steam, you know, says if they ever had
8080760	8084900	to close down, they have a button they can push that would unlock the DRM on every game
8084900	8086060	you've bought.
8086060	8088820	But I mean, would you be able to re-download games again?
8088820	8089820	No.
8089820	8090820	And according to this, they're saying no.
8090820	8091820	Yeah.
8091820	8092820	Unless you can't.
8092820	8097340	So that's kind of messed up that they're saying, sorry, you can't do that.
8097340	8100820	I don't understand why they can't do that.
8100820	8102140	I don't understand why they're getting rid of it.
8102140	8104780	Cost too much money for the servers, I guess, to justify the cost.
8104780	8105780	I don't know.
8105780	8106780	I mean, that's not much content on there.
8106780	8108020	I mean, I can't imagine that.
8108020	8109220	I'm just kind of disappointed.
8109220	8114080	The fact that it's not easy now to push to PlayStation that way is if they make it easy
8114080	8118180	enough to push content to PlayStation, because this was something that you didn't have to
8118180	8123660	like go through PlayStation and work out a deal with them to get it on their service.
8123660	8129740	It was tucked away in a corner, but ideally I was thinking about this for releasing something
8129740	8137020	on PlayStation TV, where it's a title that runs on the Vita, but it's on the console
8137020	8138020	now.
8138020	8139580	That's an easiest way to get to a console.
8139580	8144580	But now we have to go about all these roundabout ways to get to publish on there.
8144580	8148260	So I just hope that they open up something similar.
8148260	8152240	I know that they're going to have that whole ID at Xbox thing, and eventually those systems
8152240	8154360	are going to act as dev units.
8154360	8160360	I hope they do something similar for PlayStation, because that kind of sucks.
8160360	8164600	Bonds006 in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, it was doomed to fail.
8164600	8168680	They could not fight with Google Play and iOS Market.
8168680	8172400	Okay, I'll give them that.
8172400	8178580	And they did drop the support on Android, but why not just leave it there for Vita?
8178580	8179580	Or why not?
8179580	8180740	There's a crazy idea.
8180740	8187500	Why not leave it open for Vita and open it up for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4?
8187500	8191140	I mean, I don't understand why they couldn't do that.
8191140	8199100	Well, this news is going to disappoint some, but I think others will understand why there
8199100	8200460	was big news this week.
8200460	8208420	Uncharted 4, A Thief's End, pushed back to Spring 2016, revealed on the PlayStation blog.
8208420	8212780	Since we showed you our first gameplay reveal of Uncharted 4, A Thief's End, more of the
8212780	8215600	game and story have come together, and it's become clear to us that this game is much
8215600	8218460	more ambitious than we originally envisioned.
8218460	8221820	After spending so many years with Nathan Drake, he means a lot to the team, and telling the
8221820	8225240	climatic chapter of his adventures is a task we don't take lightly.
8225240	8229180	This game deserves every bit of the attention to detail, precise pacing, and nuanced storytelling
8229180	8230720	Naughty Dog is known for.
8230720	8233800	So we've made the difficult choice of pushing the game's release date.
8233800	8238600	All that statement on the PlayStation blog from director Neil Druckmann, which, as you
8238600	8244960	can imagine, the people that love to see Sony fail were coming out in droves saying, hahaha,
8244960	8248920	whereas I think there's other people of the mindset that are like, you know, well, if
8248920	8253420	it takes the system, or I mean, if it takes the game a little longer so that it's not
8253420	8256380	all buggy and screwed up, then, you know, so be it.
8256380	8262240	But I think that does leave quite a few people wondering, what's Sony going to do this holiday?
8262280	8264920	This was supposed to be the tent pole for their holiday.
8264920	8265920	So now what?
8265920	8266920	Now what?
8266920	8267920	What they got?
8267920	8273920	Did something have to get put on a fast track to make the holiday to make up for this one
8273920	8275360	getting pushed back?
8275360	8277800	Are they going to try to rely on third parties?
8277800	8278800	Who knows?
8278800	8279800	I don't think they would.
8279800	8280800	I think they've got to have something.
8280800	8282040	I've got to have something.
8282040	8288280	But I mean, to be fair, Sony had, I don't want to say Sony had a weak Christmas last
8288280	8291860	year because it's not like they didn't say it was a week PS4s, but they did get out sold
8291860	8295340	by Xbox one over the first party releases is pretty weak.
8295340	8296340	Yeah.
8296340	8300620	So it wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't as strong as Nintendo's to be honest.
8300620	8303840	So well, Nintendo, all they have is first party.
8303840	8309120	So I mean, that's, well, it has to be strong, but Loki, you have to admit what, what Nintendo
8309120	8313580	put out over the three months was probably stronger than what, you know, Sony had coming
8313580	8316160	out for their system over the three months, all day period.
8316160	8319600	I love my PlayStation four and there's a lot of great games for, yeah, it was broken drive
8319600	8321760	club and a little big planet three.
8321760	8324440	I mean, it's not hard to compete against that.
8324440	8327080	So what do you think happens now, Loki?
8327080	8330520	I think we wait until E3 and find out what game they have coming out and there's still
8330520	8331520	plenty of things.
8331520	8333320	And I think it probably is no man's sky.
8333320	8335880	Oh, you think they're investing everything in that?
8335880	8340440	I would say, and I think the game that probably could be fast tracked, I would think God of
8340440	8345800	War is going to be the game that they're going to push to this holiday and make it happen.
8345800	8347200	That's just my gut.
8347200	8349120	I have nothing to base that off of.
8349120	8352720	I just would think that that would be the game that maybe they were looking at for next
8352720	8354760	year that maybe they could bump up to this year.
8354760	8355760	I don't know.
8355760	8356760	We'll see.
8356760	8357760	We'll see.
8357760	8358760	Nothing's that easy.
8358760	8359820	It's just, you know, Oh, let's dial up the graphics.
8359820	8364280	Maybe it's a sequel to the order 18, 80, whatever, seven.
8364280	8365280	Maybe it's a sequel.
8365280	8366280	I don't think so.
8366280	8367280	I don't think so.
8367280	8368280	All right.
8368280	8369280	Well, yeah, we'll see at E3.
8369280	8370280	Knack two.
8370280	8371280	What?
8371280	8372280	Knack two.
8372280	8373280	I don't think so.
8373280	8374280	I think Knack is more likely to be on PlayStation plus.
8374280	8375280	It's a free game.
8375280	8376280	Very soon.
8376280	8377280	We'll see.
8377280	8378280	Okay.
8378280	8379280	Cool.
8379280	8380280	Um, yeah.
8380280	8383800	Uh, you know, but here's the thing, even though I am also here saying, boy, I wonder what
8383800	8384800	they're going to have for the holiday.
8384800	8386680	Wasn't there supposed to be a new Ratchet and Clank game?
8386680	8388840	Like, cause they know there's supposed to be the movie too.
8388840	8389840	There could be that.
8389840	8396200	Um, but I just want to say, um, if you bought a PlayStation four now in anticipation of
8396200	8401720	Uncharted and that was the only thing you were going for, then that's kind of on you.
8401720	8404040	Stop buying systems for games that aren't out yet.
8404040	8409120	I mean, you can use those games to kind of justify the purchase of the system.
8409120	8414200	Like, you know, if you already have a few strong games out that you want to buy, but
8414200	8418520	you know, I think it's very important for these games to take their time in the incubator
8418520	8422160	and come out right because no one likes a rushed project.
8422160	8424360	Take Assassin's Creed Unity, for example.
8424360	8428320	Uh, John from Critical Myth wrote a review over at vognetwork.com this week that was
8428320	8432920	like, kind of like, let's revisit this game, you know, now that we're six months, you know,
8432920	8436000	past when it was, maybe not that far, but like four months, five months past when it
8436000	8439680	was first released and he kind of touches on everything they've changed since then.
8439680	8443560	And you know, this seems like the game they wanted to release and they never should have
8443560	8444880	released it over the holiday period.
8444880	8448720	That maybe was a game that should have been pushed back or else it wouldn't have gotten,
8448720	8449840	you know, half the crap it did.
8449840	8452320	Do you want your Uncharted four turning out like Assassin's Creed?
8452320	8454880	No, I don't think anybody does.
8454880	8458760	So if they have to take the extra time, then they have to take the extra time.
8458760	8463840	Um, SSJ100Matt saying, I thought Street Fighter 5 was their big thing for the holidays, but
8463840	8466960	I see it's coming out quarter one, 2016.
8466960	8471400	Uh, Dungeon Buster saying Witcher 3 was delayed several times.
8471400	8473640	I think some people are talking about that in the chat room.
8473640	8475480	Uh, so there you go.
8475480	8478000	You know, Witcher 3 is multi-platform, so I...
8478000	8479000	That's true too.
8479000	8480680	I don't think that really matters.
8480680	8481680	Yeah.
8481680	8483640	All right, Loki, what do you have for us?
8483640	8486040	Um, so this is kind of cool.
8486040	8492280	There's a group of modders that are remaking Warcraft 3, I believe in Starcraft 2, because
8492280	8497920	they did release the assets for World of Warcraft, not World of Warcraft, for Warcraft 3 to allow
8497920	8500720	people to make stuff in Starcraft 2 using that.
8500720	8507160	And so now we have Warcraft, the armies of Azeroth.
8507160	8508160	It looks pretty cool.
8508160	8510920	I'm just not sure when it's coming out.
8510920	8514720	Blizzard is surprisingly supportive of these types of projects usually too.
8514720	8518680	Yeah, probably because they have no interest in doing it, and if it works out, they can...
8518680	8523520	Well, I remember there were rumors around last BlizzCon of a Warcraft 3 HD remake was
8523520	8527520	like the big buzz that they were going to announce, but it ended up being Overwatch
8527520	8531400	instead because there was a whole misdirect with the cancellation of Titan.
8531400	8536080	But yeah, it's interesting that a Warcraft 3 newer version of sorts is going to happen
8536080	8537080	anyway.
8537080	8538080	Yeah, it looks pretty cool.
8538080	8542480	But I think we saw this coming too when Starcraft 2 put the Warcraft assets in it.
8543000	8546320	So anyway, let's go to the mailbag.
8546320	8551040	Every week you guys send us emails to participate at orangelaungeradio.com.
8551040	8553200	If you want to participate, email us.
8553200	8555200	Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.
8555200	8561160	Typically, DarkSakura would dive into the mailbag and read the emails for you, but as
8561160	8563680	we mentioned before, she's not here this week.
8563680	8568480	She'll be back next week, but I will fill in in her steed this week.
8568480	8571800	We just have two quick emails for you guys tonight.
8571800	8575720	And again, if you want to have DarkSakura read your email next week, you can participate
8575720	8577520	at orangelaungeradio.com.
8577520	8579720	First email coming to us from EA Skizie.
8579720	8583160	I haven't seen this name in a little while, but EA Skizie writes us and says, hey Orange
8583160	8587440	Lounge, did I hear you say episode 589?
8587440	8588440	That's crazy.
8588440	8591360	I just want to email in and say that I think that's amazing.
8591360	8594360	And I hope you go for 589 more.
8594360	8597480	Anybody want to start Starbound for the first time with me?
8597480	8598480	LOL.
8598480	8599480	Yes.
8599480	8600480	508.
8600480	8602480	Oh, and that's EA Skizie from Milwaukee.
8602480	8603480	Yes.
8603480	8605320	589 is a long time.
8605320	8609760	We're actually going to be celebrating our 13th birthday in June.
8609760	8612720	And so for us to go for, you know, now it's 590 tonight.
8612720	8617340	For us to go for another 590 episodes, we would have to go for 13 more years.
8617340	8623800	I would be 50 years old at that point about, I'm only 36 now, but I'm getting there.
8623800	8632720	So you know, obviously we're very fortunate and lucky that we have your guys' support
8632720	8636520	as we've had over the years that really motivate us to keep going.
8636520	8642760	But you know, DarkSakura, Loki, myself, we've really just made this our Sunday night habit.
8642760	8646520	And you know, we are fortunate enough that through all this hard work, we're able to
8646520	8649840	say, we're the longest running video game podcast out there.
8649840	8655920	You know, granted, some may want to take some radio show, the fact that podcasting wasn't
8655920	8659720	around for 2005, whatever, whatever technicalities you want to get it on.
8659720	8665640	The point is we've been here since 2002, still doing our thing with you guys.
8665640	8668360	And I know I don't want to lose that anytime soon.
8668360	8672800	And I doubt Loki does and I doubt DarkSakura does, because I have fun doing this on Sunday
8672800	8677120	and you guys, you know, despite all the drama, and I talked about some of it earlier tonight,
8677120	8681440	despite all the drama, that's just, that's just that, you know, it wouldn't matter if
8681440	8684640	I never went to a single show ever again or ever did.
8684640	8688840	The fact that even one person shows up and listens for this is truly, and I know people
8688840	8692080	say this, but it's truly like just reward enough and getting to hang out with Loki and
8692080	8697760	Jamie because Lord knows if I'd see them otherwise without busy Loki is and so forth.
8697760	8700400	So we're going to be here as long as possible.
8700400	8706520	I mean, nothing lasts forever, but it will take, it's going to take something big, like,
8706520	8710520	you know, and I think we've talked about this openly on the show a few years ago.
8710520	8715880	If I haven't talked about this on the show before, then oops, I guess tonight is the
8715880	8718240	night where I'm spilling all the tea, isn't it?
8718240	8723120	But we had a scare a couple of years ago that Jamie was going to move to Washington and
8723120	8724600	she damn near did.
8724600	8729320	And there was kind of talks that about, well, if you move away, I mean, there was the talk,
8729320	8732880	oh, we could Skype and so forth, but would it really be the same type of show?
8732880	8733880	I don't know.
8733880	8738640	We had talked about, well, if this happens, this is maybe that it's maybe time to still
8738640	8739640	be able to carry on.
8739640	8740640	I don't know.
8740640	8741640	I don't know.
8741640	8742640	Would it really be the same?
8742640	8745560	I really think part of what makes this show special is the fact that we're all in the
8745560	8746560	same room.
8746560	8750760	Like a lot, a lot of podcasts aren't able to do that, which, you know, I know I do,
8750760	8752000	I do another podcast.
8752000	8755000	I do two other podcasts where we're not all in the same room and there are a lot of fun.
8755000	8758620	I know, but I feel like part of what makes this show special is that we are all here
8758620	8759620	in the same room.
8759620	8760840	So if we lost that, I don't know.
8760840	8765600	I mean, I know we did it for a few months after, you know, your son was born low key,
8765600	8768240	but that it's something different when there's a time on it.
8768240	8771520	And the fact that some of us were still here in studio, it's just, you were remote, you
8771520	8776040	know, I don't know how I'd feel about that being a permanent thing though.
8776040	8782440	So anyway, just throwing that out there, uh, over at our chat room, over at live.vognetwork.com
8782440	8787640	SSG100 Matt says, from what I know of Rob, whether it's OLR or not, I can see him podcasting
8787640	8789080	into his fifties.
8789120	8791240	Yeah, probably.
8791240	8795640	Bonds006 says, I started with OLR on the podcast about 2005.
8795640	8799080	Back in my day, when you had the only mic in an online game, it meant your word was
8799080	8800640	the law.
8800640	8803320	Some folks talking about microphones in online games.
8803320	8804320	All right.
8804320	8809400	So anyhow, um, and I kind of tend to agree with SSG100 Matt.
8809400	8812920	I probably will be podcasting well into my fifties.
8812920	8816480	It might not be about this topic, but, uh, probably be something going on.
8816480	8818960	It'll probably be about RuPaul's Drag Race, right?
8818960	8821520	I'll still be doing that, right?
8821520	8823360	Anyway, uh, moving on.
8823360	8828760	One more email here from Martin in Belgium, uh, emails us and says, I was interested to
8828760	8832320	hear Sky and Loki talk about Ingress last episode.
8832320	8834620	Remember that discussion, Loki?
8834620	8838340	One thing that did not come up was the fact that Google might be using this game for location
8838340	8840080	data mining purposes.
8840080	8843840	Google in the past has been doing all kinds of creepy stuff, such as logging all the wifi
8843840	8846160	networks and range of their street view cars.
8846160	8849040	They now use that data to more accurately determine locations.
8849040	8853320	It is hard to believe that Google is not using this app for something similar, given the
8853320	8855320	fact that they are pushing it so hard.
8855320	8859260	They could use this GPS enabled app to get all kinds of location data, including the
8859260	8863660	most popular landmarks in an area, routes you take to get there, or even personal location
8863660	8865760	data tied to your Google account, et cetera.
8865760	8870000	I think the app claims that no data is being sent back, but in the past, companies like
8870000	8873520	Google and Apple have been known to send back data without alerting the user.
8873520	8875720	How would you feel about the game if this would be the case?
8875720	8876960	Would you keep playing it?
8876960	8880520	Personally, I'm very aware of trying not to give these companies too much of my data.
8880520	8883720	I always disable location history and things like that on my phone.
8883720	8886320	This may be tinfoil hat of me, but I don't trust this app.
8886320	8887920	It just seems fishy.
8887920	8888920	Keep up the great show.
8888920	8890560	All the best, Martin from Belgium."
8890560	8897320	Sure, that thought's crossed my mind that they might be mining the location data, but
8897320	8899520	there's two things to keep in mind with that.
8899520	8903880	One, if Google wants to know where I live, they already figured it out.
8903880	8906480	They could just look at where I log into my Gmail account from.
8906480	8908680	They could probably find a lot out about my habits from that.
8908680	8910760	Yeah, I was going to say, they probably don't need a game.
8910760	8911760	They don't need a game to do it.
8911760	8912760	Yeah, exactly.
8912760	8914760	They will just build it into their fucking operating system.
8914760	8919720	As far as to know what landmarks are visited frequently and so forth, although that's a
8919720	8924680	good thought as well, and I'm not trying to discredit that, I would challenge this, is
8924680	8931540	that Ingress, part of the challenge is going to places I wouldn't usually go to.
8931540	8935740	If they're trying to track what landmarks people go to, it's going to be artificial
8935740	8940140	because some of these places I would never have gone to if it wasn't for Ingress, which
8940140	8945740	is both a positive and a negative because the positive is, I also get out of my car,
8945740	8949060	get up off my butt, and walk through some of these parks.
8949060	8956220	The other night, Thursday night, the Enlightened, the Green Team had a medium-sized event where
8956220	8960920	10 people showed up at this predetermined location where we walked around the circumference
8960920	8966360	of a park for a couple hours and did all the nodes and then farmed gear off of them.
8966360	8969560	So I wouldn't have gotten that exercise if it wasn't for Ingress.
8969560	8973420	So that's part of the reason why I'm still into the game.
8973420	8976820	But as far as like, is Google spying on me and so forth?
8976820	8979100	What is the real intention of Ingress?
8979100	8985180	I kind of think even Google doesn't know what the fuck Ingress is, and I think that's part
8985180	8986740	of what Google does sometimes.
8986740	8991000	And we have heard of the fact that they're supposed to be using that technology in some
8991000	8997120	other games that they're making, like there's this whole thing, that guy who got into trouble
8997120	9001740	with Oprah, what was his name, James Frey, is now writing some novel that is going to
9001740	9007060	be teaming up with the people who made Ingress for some other type of ARG.
9007060	9014220	And Google with the Ingress, it allows them to get pictures of things from people on foot
9014220	9019260	in places that cars can't get into, like parks, like trails.
9019260	9023500	And that is information about like, where are all these landmarks that people might
9023500	9024500	want to see?
9024500	9026900	That is information that they could turn around and market as well.
9026900	9032260	So I do think there's data in that regard that they can get from Ingress, but I highly
9032260	9035120	doubt Google's making a lot of money off Ingress, if at all.
9035120	9037820	They occasionally have their commercial sponsor, but that's really it.
9037820	9040140	But am I worried that Google's tracking that?
9040140	9043820	I kind of feel like if they wanted to track it, they'd already be doing it.
9043820	9045940	They wouldn't need Ingress for me to do it.
9045940	9050980	I mean, hell, Apple would find my friends in that location thing.
9050980	9054740	I mean, Apple knows where I'm at all the time.
9054740	9058140	And it's one of those double-edged swords because it's like, I want that because if
9058140	9062660	my phone ever gets stolen, excuse me, I want to be able to find it.
9062660	9066100	I want to know who has my phone and tell the police, go here, it's in this shed.
9066100	9067100	You know?
9067100	9069100	So it's a double-edged sword.
9069100	9074260	Kaijuto in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com says, Google doesn't give a shit where you're
9074260	9075260	at.
9075260	9076260	They just want to make that paper.
9076260	9080100	Raginator says, what are the odds that Google's feeding the government any and all data they
9080100	9081740	gather from your Ingress use?
9081740	9088140	See, I just, again, I just feel like you're starting to get a little tinfoil hat.
9088140	9092020	And I'm not saying you shouldn't question things.
9092020	9093020	That's fine.
9093020	9096800	But I also, I'm just, the reality is if the government wants to know where you're at,
9096800	9100320	they don't need Ingress to do it, and they don't need a lot of other stuff to do it.
9100320	9101800	They'll find it.
9101800	9106560	Just kind of what I believe to be the case, but maybe I'm wrong.
9106560	9108920	Anyhow, I still welcome all your opinions.
9108920	9113660	Participate at orangelaungeradio.com if you wish to send us an email for next week.
9113660	9118960	In the meantime, this is the point of the show where we get into the FUs of the week.
9118960	9119960	Why?
9119960	9120880	Because FU, that's why.
9126800	9137800	Loki.
9137800	9139840	I love my kids.
9139840	9141520	I love my son Josh.
9141520	9150440	But at the same time, I am fucking pissed off at him for, he's very sensitive, I guess.
9150440	9153200	And he was super excited to go to the Marvel show and everything.
9153200	9157800	So you know, I figured, it's only here once this year, so if I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna
9157800	9158800	do it right.
9158800	9161840	I'm gonna get some seats so we can actually see everything, we're not gonna be way up
9161840	9165720	in the bleachers and stuff like that.
9165720	9167800	And he fucking got scared five minutes in.
9167800	9170860	And that shit was fucking expensive.
9170860	9173640	That's like throwing away $200.
9173640	9179520	And I was just fucking pissed at him and just yelling at him when I really shouldn't be
9179520	9180520	doing that.
9180520	9187480	Seriously though, what's up with kids not appreciating what you're doing for them?
9187480	9188480	Someday he will.
9188480	9193360	Be sure to tell him about how scared he got when he's 18, he'll really appreciate that.
9193360	9194640	I will be sure to do that.
9194640	9198480	Maybe we can save this recording for him when he turns 18.
9198480	9199480	Sure.
9199480	9200480	All right.
9200480	9203280	Uh oh, Alan wants to share a story with us, why don't you grab that yellow mic on the
9203280	9205000	table over there Alan.
9205000	9206360	Hi Alan, welcome to the studio.
9206360	9207360	Hello.
9207360	9208360	It's not like you live here or anything.
9208360	9209360	Yeah.
9209360	9210360	How's Diablo 3 going for you?
9211200	9213200	What paragon level are you now?
9213200	9214200	385.
9214200	9215200	Oh my God.
9215200	9216200	All right.
9216200	9220440	When I was five or six, my mom took me to Sesame Street Live where they do the stage
9220440	9225800	show and Big Bird is there and I was so happy and I got like second or third row seats and
9225800	9230240	they were having at the end, they were giving like t-shirts and balloons to certain kids.
9230240	9233480	They were picking people out of the audience to come up and hug Big Bird.
9233480	9237660	And of course five or six year old's dream is to hug Big Bird.
9238260	9241940	I know some people that are 35 that would love to hug Big Bird.
9241940	9243820	I would now because I'm six four, a fucker's tall.
9243820	9244820	So I'm like, here's a big hug.
9244820	9249620	I'm not having to hug a midget, a little person, sorry.
9249620	9252580	And they didn't pick me and they're like, that's it, good night.
9252580	9255060	I was devastated.
9255060	9261500	I cried, like threw up, like I was crying that hard for hours after.
9261500	9266780	My mom was like, if they can't give every single kid a thing, because that was like
9266780	9271780	a waste of money because I was enjoying it up until the very end and I didn't get picked
9271780	9273260	to go up on stage and hug Big Bird.
9273260	9275100	So I cry.
9275100	9277300	So basically my point is that kids suck.
9277300	9278300	They're shitty.
9278300	9280100	Well, I just say like, at least you got to sit there.
9280100	9283260	I would be fine if like they did the same thing, you know, if that was what happened,
9283260	9285900	but like, well, you know, listen, they can't possibly get that.
9285900	9286900	Look how many kids are here.
9286900	9287900	They can't give something out there.
9287900	9289500	At least we got to see the show.
9289500	9292560	But it was like, I didn't get to see shit.
9292560	9295340	What I saw of the show, I already watched on YouTube.
9295340	9300340	So I could have saved myself $200 by fucking watching.
9300340	9303140	You have several people in the chat room that are going, but he's just a kid, Loki.
9303140	9304140	I understand that.
9304140	9305400	But there's other kids.
9305400	9308260	There was a ton of other kids in his age group, OK?
9308260	9309260	This is a kid.
9309260	9312300	He is super like sensitive to like loud noises and stuff like that.
9312300	9314300	And you still love your kid, which is reiterated at the beginning.
9314300	9317220	I still love him, but like it's frustrating sometimes because I want to take him to do
9317220	9321460	all these fun things and he gets fucking scared over everything.
9321460	9324540	And he'll make up stuff to be scared about.
9325060	9327340	The nephew of the week is to vent.
9327340	9328340	But I will say this.
9328340	9331300	You know what's going to happen, Loki, is that, and this happens with a lot of kids,
9331300	9334500	around age like six or seven, he's just going to transform.
9334500	9338060	And suddenly it's going to be like, now the kid will be like a little brat.
9338060	9339060	And you won't be...
9339060	9340060	He already is!
9340060	9341060	It doesn't matter.
9341060	9342060	It doesn't...
9342060	9343060	I don't get the any of...
9343060	9344300	There is no upside.
9344300	9347020	He is a brat and fucking...
9347020	9348020	Just like daddy.
9348020	9350820	It's like, there is no upside.
9350820	9353260	All right.
9353260	9354260	I like that story.
9354980	9355980	Thank you.
9355980	9358740	I'm so glad you could talk about how Big Bird made you throw up here on the show.
9358740	9359740	Yeah.
9359740	9360740	Well, he didn't hug me.
9360740	9361740	If he hugged me, I would have been fine.
9361740	9364700	But I wailed for hours.
9364700	9368620	Now I feel like for your birthday, I should put on a Big Bird costume and come out and
9368620	9369620	give you a hug.
9369620	9370620	Don't take it there.
9370620	9371620	No.
9371620	9374100	So here's what I'll do differently.
9374100	9376860	Next time, if I were to do something differently, I wouldn't sit as close because I think if
9376860	9381360	we were sitting up like at the top of the, you know, the lower section or something,
9381360	9383140	it wouldn't have been so bad.
9383140	9385700	It's just that they're doing live pyrotechnics in the front.
9385700	9389020	He's never seen a show with live pyrotechnics and stuff.
9389020	9391700	And so it's a little bit, you know, frightening for him.
9391700	9392700	All right.
9392700	9393700	So at least you have a lesson learned out of this.
9393700	9394700	I understand that.
9394700	9398260	But yeah, and also the lesson is I'm not going to waste $200 on fucking tickets too.
9398260	9400500	They wanted $12 fucking dollars for popcorn.
9400500	9401500	I bought that popcorn.
9401500	9404740	I damn well am going to eat every single piece of that popcorn.
9404740	9405740	It's not gone yet.
9405740	9410700	But they seriously wanted like $15 for a fucking snow cone.
9410700	9412940	I mean, come on.
9412940	9416620	Speaking of stadium events and paying too much money, I want to give an FU this week
9416620	9419140	to the San Jose Sharks.
9419140	9420140	You're my team, guys.
9420140	9421140	You're my team.
9421140	9422620	You're my hometown team.
9422620	9426740	You got to break Alan's hockey cherry as well, going to his first Sharks game.
9426740	9429220	Did you have fun at the Sharks game, Alan?
9429220	9433140	I did, but I have to give a shout out to those seats we got.
9433140	9434140	Oh, yeah.
9434140	9439380	It would have been nice if they had won with those seats, but we were eight rows from rink.
9439380	9440380	Yeah.
9440380	9441380	No, that was awesome.
9441380	9442380	That was my buddy, Neil.
9442380	9444580	He's been playing in the zone since high school that helped hook us up with that.
9444580	9446620	So thank you.
9446620	9447900	Very appreciative about that.
9447900	9452560	But yeah, FU San Jose Sharks for just choking in the third period.
9452560	9455980	It was tied 2-2 at the end of the second period.
9455980	9462940	And then period three started and the Black Hawks were like, you know what, we're tired
9462940	9463940	of this.
9463940	9465500	We're just going to win now.
9465500	9466500	Yep.
9466500	9467500	Man.
9467500	9472320	But at the very least, the very least, because before the show, the Kill Time, because he
9472360	9475800	had a Batman shirt on that I just wasn't going to do.
9475800	9479560	So we went and bought Marvel shirts and so he got an Avenger shirt and I got a Deadpool
9479560	9480560	shirt.
9480560	9481560	So at least I have a Deadpool shirt.
9481560	9482560	At least you have a Deadpool shirt.
9482560	9485320	At least I have a Deadpool shirt and some popcorn that I'm going to eat no matter how
9485320	9486320	stale it gets.
9486320	9488960	Because I paid $12 for that fucking popcorn.
9488960	9493200	I am eating every piece of that popcorn.
9493200	9497040	Tigerclaw in chat says, what if your presence at the game is the reason why the team lost,
9497040	9498040	Rob?
9498040	9499040	Just saying.
9499040	9500040	Yeah, because that's two losses in a row now.
9500040	9502040	They saying you're a cooler?
9502260	9503260	You know what?
9503260	9504260	Don't go there.
9504260	9505260	I am.
9505260	9509760	I'm sorry if my radiant beauty and presence just throws the team off their game.
9509760	9510760	I can't.
9510760	9511760	I can't.
9511760	9515120	My friends are already suggesting that I'm the cause of the losses, but I'm telling you
9515120	9520320	four goals in one period and removing the goalie from the net so they could score on
9520320	9521320	an empty net.
9521320	9523320	These were not my decisions, people.
9523320	9524320	Not my decisions.
9524320	9528320	Anyhow, just a few more stories for you guys and we're going to open up the Skyline quickly
9528320	9529320	to get your calls.
9529320	9533160	I'm a little late here tonight because of the announcements we did live on VoG before
9533160	9537200	the show tonight, but I do want to at least try to get one or two calls in, especially
9537200	9541200	people might want to talk about GDC, South by Southwest, PAX, or one of the many things
9541200	9543200	that have been going on over the past couple weeks.
9543200	9546200	1-877-GAMO-LR or a username on Skype, Orange Law and Tradeo.
9546200	9550080	But first, before I get to those calls, a few more stories for you guys.
9550080	9551080	Loki.
9551080	9559240	So, Marvelous has just acquired G-mode and with that they've also acquired most of
9559240	9567240	Data East's intellectual properties, including Magical Drop, Joe and Mac, which, shit, when's
9567240	9573080	there been, when's the last time we had a Joe and Mac game, SNES?
9573080	9578560	Let's see, Fighter's History, Caveman Ninja, and BurgerTime, among others.
9578560	9579560	Yes!
9579560	9582040	So maybe we'll get another BurgerTime game.
9582040	9583040	Yes!
9583040	9585400	That'd be pretty sweet.
9585400	9586400	What else do they have?
9586400	9591480	They also have, I guess, Metal Max, I still remember that, and Vapor Trail.
9591480	9595120	So I wonder if we'll see some more games from that, hopefully, hopefully they do something
9595120	9596120	with it.
9596120	9597280	I mean, obviously they would do something with it.
9597280	9598280	Why would you purchase it?
9598280	9600200	Why would they buy it if they're not going to do anything with it, right?
9600200	9603720	Data East, so, uh, does that mean we're going to get a new Bad Dudes game?
9603720	9605320	Are we going to get a new Bad Dudes game?
9605320	9607080	Are they a bad enough dude to put out Bad Dudes?
9607080	9610000	Can we get a new Bad Dudes game, because that'd be pretty sweet.
9610000	9612760	I don't know, Bad Dudes is kind of one of the games, it actually wasn't very good.
9612760	9615000	Like I don't know if you ever played Bad Dudes on the NES, it really wasn't good.
9615000	9619880	I played Bad Dudes all the time, and I could never do a fucking Roundhouse game with it.
9619880	9620880	Never.
9620880	9623840	It was... it was too hard.
9623840	9630560	Alright, uh, this is interesting, something, it's a peripheral for the Oculus Rift, you
9630560	9632880	know, VR, it's where everything's going.
9632880	9634440	That looks like a creepy face.
9634440	9636440	Lots of people talking about the Oculus Rift.
9636440	9640840	Well that creepy face that Loki is referring to is Feel Real.
9640840	9647400	It is a Bluetooth add-on for the Oculus Rift that straps over your mouth and nose.
9647400	9651600	It looks like a creepy face that you'd be making out with.
9651600	9654480	It looks like a creepy like face that you would make out with or something.
9654480	9659120	Yeah, it does kind of look like something you would make out with, but uh, anyway, this
9659120	9665080	battery powered device will produce seven different scents.
9665080	9668440	Like smelly scents, not like money, but scents.
9668440	9674120	So it's smell-o-vision with this thing, with unique scents that you can smell.
9674120	9680640	So this mask will allow you to smell things like the ocean, a waterfall, or fire.
9680640	9687920	Also I guess this will produce temperature controlled air, mist, and vibrations.
9687920	9696120	So um, that's uh, that's something every game just gets one step closer to the holodeck,
9696120	9697120	doesn't it?
9697120	9701560	But now the holodeck will smell like fire and spray you with water and other temperature
9701560	9702560	controlled elements.
9702560	9706160	So you got to admit though, I mean, as much as we're kind of sitting here and making fun
9706160	9710360	of the way it looks and so forth, it does seem like a logical step.
9710360	9715000	If you're going to put this thing over your eyes and be immersed in this world with all
9715000	9720720	your vision, wouldn't it make sense that, you know, the temp, the other feelings besides
9720720	9724500	just your vision, your other senses are stimulated as well and it makes sense.
9724500	9728540	That would be cool except, you know, when I'm smelling fire in game and I just don't
9728540	9733340	realize that my house is burning down because I have a giant VR headset over me.
9733340	9738760	What if you're playing a very violent game on Oculus Rift and you're smelling blood?
9738760	9742700	Or people, you know, relieving themselves as you murder them, so.
9742700	9744220	That might be a bit much actually.
9744220	9748180	I don't, I think smell-o-vision, everyone tries to do smell-o-vision, I just don't think
9748180	9752420	it's going to work until you can get it to where you can simulate any smell.
9752420	9756700	And even then it's just, I think it's just too hard of a sense to do.
9756700	9759060	We don't understand enough about how it works.
9759060	9763460	Yeah, usually the smell-o-vision stuff is very limited but, you know, I think about
9763460	9767740	like some of the Disney stuff where they kind of like, you know, people love Soarin', right?
9767740	9770980	At Disney World they have Soarin' or Soarin' over California or whatever it's called and
9770980	9773160	they have it here at California Adventure as well.
9773160	9776720	Like a lot of people really like that ride because, again, a lot of your senses are being
9776720	9780780	stimulated because you have the vision, which isn't quite the same as Oculus Rift.
9780780	9782740	They need a better screen for that nowadays.
9782740	9785780	They're actually, they're refurbing it right now as we speak, it's down and the screen
9785780	9789980	is getting an HD refurbishment so, your wish is Disney's command, right?
9789980	9790980	The magic never ends.
9790980	9791980	It better be.
9791980	9797940	So, but then not only that but you have that sensation of flying which simulates your senses
9797940	9802260	as well and then, yes, even though it's limited, you know, you smell the oranges when you go
9802260	9805860	over the orange field and you smell the pine trees and you go over the pine field and I
9805860	9809980	think that's really why people love that ride because it's so many different senses all
9809980	9810980	being hit at once.
9810980	9812660	It's a nice air-conditioned building.
9812660	9814580	Yes, that is true.
9814580	9815580	That is very true.
9815580	9818260	No, or hardly ever a line.
9818260	9820740	Kaijuto is wondering, what if I'm playing The Binding of Isaac?
9820740	9821740	Well, you know.
9821740	9824780	Well, you're gonna smell a lot of blood and feces, I guess.
9824780	9826900	Here's the thing, too.
9826900	9827900	A lot of game.
9827900	9833180	He didn't mention what those other smells were, so it's ocean, fire, and vomit and shit.
9833180	9838740	Yeah, and a nerd expo, but no, here's the thing.
9838740	9843260	Keep in mind that the goal of the Rift is to not just port all the old games into the
9843260	9844260	Rift.
9844260	9846340	That's kind of doing it wrong, I think, in many ways.
9846340	9851260	Like, you know, we had that 8-bit Zelda experience in the Rift.
9851260	9855660	Look, Zelda was not designed to be a Rift game, but there are some pretty cool experiences,
9855660	9856660	you know, on the Rift.
9856660	9861940	I would love an 8-bit style game that would look like Zelda in the Rift.
9861940	9864900	Yeah, but it would have to be something that's kind of developed by that.
9864900	9868900	But I mean, like, for example, Bobby let me check out his Gear VR, which is the thing
9868900	9873260	that the Note 4 mobile device, you just pop it right in the headset and do it.
9873260	9874260	You know what I want?
9874260	9875260	What?
9875260	9876260	Like, super bad.
9876260	9877260	Stop interrupting my story.
9877260	9878260	Oh, sorry.
9878260	9882540	But I saw this Paul McCartney concert in it, and this Cirque du Soleil thing.
9882540	9887020	These weren't games, but they were experiences that, like Soarin' Over California, might
9887020	9890620	be kind of cool with the smell, but I just don't see where you could get that at a consumer
9890620	9891620	level.
9891620	9892620	And it would be very limited.
9892620	9894180	All right, yes, your Tangent Loki.
9894180	9895620	I want Zelda Maker.
9895620	9898500	Oh, if Mario Maker does really well, you want Zelda Maker?
9898500	9900340	I don't even give a shit if Mario Maker does really well.
9900340	9902160	I want Zelda Maker.
9902160	9903160	And then Metroid Maker.
9903160	9904980	Let's do all of those.
9904980	9908580	You know, if Nintendo was- Or Mario Kart Maker, they'd never do that,
9908580	9909580	though.
9909580	9913740	If Nintendo was listening to you on this program right now, Loki, they probably turned it off
9913740	9915300	about 90 minutes ago.
9915300	9917900	I'm sorry, they're throwing away money, okay?
9917900	9921660	You know, I understand that you really want to keep him happy, and that's fine.
9921660	9926020	He'll make his Mario games later on in Star Fox and all that fun stuff, but I'm sorry.
9926020	9934300	It's just not gonna- I love the guy, but it's just- I don't see those being successful.
9934300	9935300	I just don't.
9935300	9936300	But you know what?
9936300	9938100	Prove me wrong, please.
9938100	9939700	I hope that I'm wrong.
9939700	9943980	I just think it's gonna flop, and it's gonna suck, or it's just nothing's gonna ever happen
9943980	9944980	with it.
9944980	9945980	It's more of an experiment, and that's it.
9945980	9949380	Yeah, Dartitsuya is saying, are you sure you're not gonna dog on Zelda Maker if they do it?
9950100	9952940	All right, Nsj100Matt says, or Mega Man Maker?
9952940	9953940	Oh, wait.
9953940	9954940	Womp, womp, womp.
9954940	9959140	Well, hey, we could have had that at one time, you know, but that never-
9959140	9960140	That's the joke.
9960140	9963580	Well, technically they had that on PSP, but you know.
9963580	9967480	Back on the Smellovision real quick, Kaijuto is saying, didn't TGIF do smell stuff?
9967480	9968480	It was whack.
9968480	9969620	TV Guide.
9969620	9970620	I remember.
9970620	9974260	I wasn't alive then, but I remember the DVD release of this, where they kind of brought
9974260	9976700	it back for a little bit, and I remember reading about it.
9976700	9978660	Wait, how are you- oh, okay.
9978660	9984500	In the 70s, Pink Flamingos, the cult John Waters movie that's really explicit, right?
9984500	9987440	They had a whole smell- no, wait, no, it wasn't Pink Flamingos, it was one of the other John
9987440	9988540	Waters movies.
9988540	9990400	Was it Polyester?
9990400	9993540	One of them had like a Smellovision card, and when the DVD came out, you could actually
9993540	9996980	get the Smellovision card, came with it, and you could kind of experience it all over again,
9996980	10000400	and that was like John Waters' thing, was it was- and of course, some of them were like
10000400	10005880	roses and nice things, and some of them were like poop and offensive things that I would
10005880	10007900	advise you don't scratch and sniff.
10007900	10012080	But like, that was kind of a fad in the 70s and 80s.
10012080	10015380	So anyway, moving on.
10015380	10017140	Loki, one more story.
10017140	10022620	So hey, Rob, I hope you're happy we finally got a new F-Zero game.
10022620	10023620	What?
10023620	10025900	Why did we wait till the end of the show to talk about this?
10025900	10033420	Because it's actually, it's an unofficial port of F-Zero to the, what was it, the MegaDrive.
10033420	10035620	So G-Zero is what it's called now.
10035620	10036620	Oh, okay.
10036620	10041100	It doesn't have Mode 7, but it looks nice.
10041100	10042700	I wonder how that runs.
10042700	10045060	It's got to look kind of funky on a Genesis.
10045060	10046060	I heard it sounds good though.
10046060	10051580	I don't know, they don't have any video of it, but they were saying, you know, this is
10051580	10055880	cool, doesn't look bad either, colorful, fits the spirit of the original, and it says this
10055880	10059220	is beyond excellent, just the music alone brings tears to my eyes.
10059220	10061700	So you know what's kind of cool?
10061700	10068900	On the subject of this too, I watched a video of someone that had ported Street Fighter
10068900	10077740	2 Turbo Edition to the Virtual Boy, and it actually looked kind of cool.
10077740	10084780	So man, Virtual Boy, in some ways that thing was just ahead of its time, right?
10084780	10085780	I don't know.
10085780	10087780	I think they should try it again.
10087780	10092300	All right, well we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username
10092300	10095460	on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
10095460	10099300	We are the show where every gamer has a voice, so call in and lend yours to the conversation,
10099300	10102820	anything we talked about this week, or maybe something that we missed.
10102820	10104980	The Skype line is open now.
10104980	10109180	Meanwhile, Loki, I don't know if you have any last minute stories, I think we touched
10109180	10113860	on, it was kind of a quiet this week, quiet week this week, because last week was kind
10113860	10117260	of busy, the week we were gone unfortunately, but we tried to hit on some of the big stuff.
10117740	10120020	I don't know if you have any other last minute stories, Loki.
10120020	10121540	I don't think so.
10121540	10122540	No?
10122540	10123540	Yeah.
10123540	10124540	No, that's all right.
10124540	10125540	It happens.
10125540	10128860	We actually are getting some calls coming in, so we can get to the Skype line.
10128860	10130060	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10130060	10131060	Who's this?
10131060	10133060	Yes, this is Azur Man.
10133060	10134060	Hey, what's up?
10134060	10135060	Azur Man.
10135060	10136060	What's on your mind, buddy?
10136060	10137060	Too much.
10137060	10138060	Two things.
10138060	10145380	You guys were just basically speaking earlier with the program world and the 2DX issues.
10145380	10149500	Yes, our special correspondent, YYR, bringing us the info on that.
10149500	10158700	Yeah, I kind of play on the East Coast at Chinatown Fair, and we kind of had that issue.
10158700	10164260	We had basically the machine for a pendulum for about a few months, and it was kind of
10164260	10170300	a big damper when everything was going down, but what I basically wanted to talk about
10170300	10181940	was that radio shows like this and other communities like Bimani style kind of keeps
10181940	10188780	people like me who like 2DX playing games like that and keeping ... I'm sorry, I'm trying
10188780	10189780	to get my thoughts together.
10189780	10199820	What I'm trying to say is that Konami really knew about this whole issue with the people
10199820	10205300	in America playing the game, but it seems that you might be right that round one might
10205300	10210860	want to try to have some sort of monopoly over it and maybe bring it over here, but
10210860	10216180	it's kind of depressing to kind of find out like you can't play it at all in the store
10216180	10217180	anymore.
10217180	10219340	Yeah, and you know what?
10219340	10224940	You bring a very difficult but logical point up that people have to consider whether they
10224940	10231020	want to hear it or not, and that is that Konami turned a blind eye to this for a very,
10231020	10232580	very long time.
10232580	10236780	I mean, even back when we talked about nothing but DDR, I mean, think about it.
10236780	10241580	DDR Extreme Machines weren't even supposed to be here in the US, and everybody had them
10241580	10247700	anyway, so Konami's turned a very blind eye to this for a very long time, and so for it
10247700	10252780	just now to have the rug pulled out kind of stings a little bit for a lot of people, I
10252780	10253780	get.
10253780	10256220	But on the other hand, I can also see why.
10256220	10260060	I don't want to villainize round one in this either because I could also see it from their
10260060	10264380	perspective where if round one is like, hey, if we're going to play by the rules, then
10264380	10266700	everyone else needs to play by the rules.
10266700	10271180	What I would love to see happen in this scenario, I think, I think, you know, what kind of has
10271180	10275780	to happen in some ways or else somebody's going to get pissed off is that we really
10275780	10281580	need to start tearing down these arbitrary region walls.
10281580	10285520	And we've been bitching about this on the 3DS and PlayStation and so forth about region
10285520	10288100	locking for the longest time, have we not?
10288100	10291020	And isn't this whole thing that we're talking about, isn't this just another form of region
10291020	10292020	locking?
10292020	10296200	I mean, isn't it time that Konami, I mean, and if the reason, if the real reason they
10296200	10300540	shut it all down was to launch E-Amusement Global and now great, everybody can have the
10300540	10306540	latest 2DX and everybody can play by the rules, then I think that is, in my opinion,
10306540	10307540	a happy ending.
10307540	10311140	Although some people may not like the fact that they have to do the 30% of the proceeds
10311140	10314900	and it may make it a little tougher for private owners.
10314900	10319580	I'm not sure I see a scenario where they can really win, but I think at least all the arcades
10319580	10321700	that want to run the machines can do that.
10321700	10322700	Yeah.
10322700	10324820	I mean, that's one of the issues.
10324820	10330860	I mean, it's really hard to get people outside of this small community to play, and I say
10330860	10335700	small because compared to the people who play other games like the Street Fighter community,
10335700	10340700	the Konami, Bimani's community is rather small.
10340700	10344540	And it makes it very difficult for them to kind of like come out with a system, like
10344540	10346380	I'm an arcade and played here.
10346380	10352100	I had a few friends who had their own arcades and they kind of brought them to big, like
10352100	10354900	flea markets and stuff to kind of like have people play.
10354900	10357860	And even though it wasn't, they were losing money on it, it wasn't making any money.
10357860	10362320	They still tried to keep up with the latest, you know, because the hardware wasn't really
10362320	10363320	the problem.
10363320	10370940	Once they bought the cabinet, buying the upgrades every single from overseas was rather cheap.
10370940	10378300	It was this new network, the EMU's network, where you can't basically play the latest
10378300	10383540	mixes without being connected to it, really makes it very difficult for them to keep up
10383540	10384540	with it.
10384540	10387580	And like, you know, I'm a big fan of all the Bimani music.
10387580	10391060	It kind of draws in, we even, I don't know if you're familiar with, we had something
10391060	10394220	over here called Ballmani.
10394220	10400980	There was actually one of the vendors here in, I think in Massachusetts, Ashley was able
10400980	10408140	to get Konami to send over Course K. And he also, he was one of the like DJs for a lot
10408140	10409140	of Bimani music.
10409140	10417100	He does Hippin' Above, he did, what do you call it again, Rising to the Sky, Rising in
10417100	10418600	the Sun.
10418600	10421980	And he was actually, he came here, he played a few of his mixes.
10421980	10423460	I took a few pictures with him.
10423460	10425020	He was really cool.
10425020	10429260	And they were trying to like see how people were, you know, they didn't like two years
10429260	10430260	of that.
10430260	10432540	The other year, I think, REU was supposed to come.
10432540	10435820	And it was really cool because they were trying to like see if, you know, if America would
10435820	10437940	like it, even though it was a very small group.
10437940	10441780	But after that, it kind of just fell apart and we didn't see much about that after that.
10441780	10445180	I think the store closed down and somebody else took over the store.
10445180	10451820	But you know, out of those 10 years, it was a big part of my like gaming, you know, life.
10451820	10455540	I mean, it was either that and Final Fantasy XI, you know, back and forth.
10455540	10459100	So this show wouldn't exist without that community.
10459100	10460100	It really wouldn't.
10460100	10464660	So, I mean, it pains us all to kind of see that Konami doesn't really want anything to
10464660	10465660	do with it.
10465660	10470700	But at the same time, you know, some of their games were a little half-assed.
10470700	10472780	Some of them were very half-assed.
10472780	10477140	That pop and music abhoration that is on the Xbox 360, whatever that thing was called,
10477140	10479020	Beat and Groovy, that is an insult.
10479020	10480020	You know what I mean?
10480020	10481020	Yeah, exactly.
10481020	10482020	Isn't it?
10482020	10483020	That's the word.
10483020	10486220	It is an insult because they even, when they bring it to America, they're catering to like
10486220	10490280	new players and they're just trying to make sure that it can make their money back.
10490280	10494340	And it's not, I mean, like the game is great with the, you know, the actual music they
10494340	10495900	have for it right now.
10495900	10501220	Changing it and bringing in people who have nothing to do with the genre just makes it
10501220	10502220	very difficult.
10502220	10504900	I mean, I didn't even touch DJ Hero just because of that, you know?
10504900	10506500	Well, but DJ Hero is worth a look.
10506500	10507500	It is a different game.
10507500	10508780	But anyway, I understand.
10508780	10511920	But that's another game that we're not going to get another one of because people, I guess,
10511920	10512920	didn't get it or whatever.
10512920	10513920	Anyway, my friend, I'm so sorry.
10513920	10515640	I got to let you go so we can get some more calls.
10515640	10518060	But thank you for calling in and sharing your voice with us.
10518060	10519060	No problem.
10519060	10520060	All right.
10520060	10521060	Take care, my friend.
10521060	10522060	Bye-bye.
10522060	10523060	All right.
10523060	10524060	We're going to get some more calls here.
10524060	10527700	I always find it, don't worry if you get a little nervous when you're on air, you forget
10527700	10528700	what you're going to say.
10528700	10531500	It happens to me every week.
10531500	10533620	I always forget what I'm going to say.
10533620	10535300	And that is not helping with age.
10535300	10539140	That's going to be the problem when I'm a 50-year-old podcaster is I'll be probably
10539140	10541660	suffering from even worse memory loss than I do now.
10541660	10543300	Anyway, we do have another call on the line.
10543300	10544300	We're going to get to it.
10544300	10545300	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
10545300	10546300	Who's this?
10546300	10547300	Hey, what's up?
10547300	10548300	This guy's Judo.
10548300	10549300	Hey, guys, Judo.
10549300	10550300	How you doing?
10550300	10551300	I'm doing good, man.
10551300	10552300	How are you?
10552300	10553300	I'm good.
10553400	10554900	How are you?
10554900	10555900	I'm very good.
10555900	10557380	How was theovid when you said that you were doing?
10557380	10558380	I have a week off.
10558380	10562500	I was literally in the air when OLR should have been on and it's always a weird feeling,
10562500	10565180	but nice to be back home.
10565180	10566180	What's on your mind?
10566180	10567180	You need to do a show from the air.
10567180	10568180	That'd be cool.
10568180	10570140	I don't think many people are doing that.
10570140	10571700	Oh, do a show from the air?
10571700	10572980	Yeah, I can.
10572980	10573980	I'm pretty sure.
10573980	10575980	You can dab Wi-Fi up in a plane now.
10575980	10577260	I haven't played a phone in years.
10577260	10578260	They do, actually.
10578260	10582860	I was able to chat on Google Chat with Allen from the air, but I don't know if I could
10582860	10583860	do that.
10583860	10584860	It's a virtual audio cable, man.
10584860	10585860	It does wonders.
10585860	10586860	Let me put it this way.
10586860	10590020	Anyway, I wanted to tell you about Code Name, what is it?
10590020	10591020	Code Name Steam.
10591020	10592020	That's a great game.
10592020	10593860	You need to pick it up as soon as possible.
10593860	10594860	Really?
10594860	10601020	I'm hearing very mixed reviews on Code Name Steam, or excuse me, Project Steam.
10601020	10603500	What are you enjoying about it?
10603500	10606380	Just the fact that at first I didn't think I was going to like it because I'm not a fan
10606380	10607380	of steampunk.
10607380	10610180	I mean, it pretty much has a lot of elements that I don't like.
10610180	10611180	I don't like steampunk.
10611620	10616460	I don't like American folk culture or folk tales or whatever.
10616460	10618340	I definitely don't like MGM.
10618340	10623220	I felt like, looking at that game, I felt like it was like if MGM made a game.
10623220	10625060	I just don't like that style.
10625060	10626540	I don't like that time period.
10626540	10627540	Right.
10627540	10628540	Yeah.
10628540	10629540	It made me want to puke.
10629540	10635260	But I got the game anyway, just because I love when a game is being innovative.
10635260	10639300	I also like the developer of the game, so I said, let me try it.
10639300	10640300	I turned out liking it.
10640500	10641940	I like the art style.
10641940	10644260	I like pretty much everything about it.
10644260	10650340	I like the fact that you move around the board in a third-person view.
10650340	10656460	You can't zoom out and look at what's around you, which I think really helps to make the
10656460	10659780	game feel suspenseful.
10659780	10661420	You don't know where the aliens are, really.
10661420	10668700	You got to sneak around corners and look around, and I find that fun.
10668700	10672140	So it's the fun factor more than anything else for you, even though the story you're
10672140	10674340	kind of a little bit on.
10674340	10676820	That's interesting you say that, because I thought the battle system was one of the things
10676820	10678940	that people were really resonant on.
10678940	10679940	Yeah.
10679940	10682060	Well, I like the battle system.
10682060	10686140	I think I know why people don't like the battle system, and that's just because it's a new
10686140	10688380	system and it just takes getting used to.
10688380	10692940	But once you find your groove, once you really get into it, you can do a lot of cool stuff
10692940	10694180	with the battle system.
10694180	10698740	I think you can do stuff that the game doesn't even intend for you to do.
10698740	10700420	Real quickly, I was playing one game.
10700420	10702420	Right now, I'm not that far in the game.
10702420	10704460	I'm still at the part where I'm only using two characters.
10704460	10709900	I'm using John Henry and whoever the heck the main character is.
10709900	10715600	There was a part where John Henry, he has this grenade launcher gun, and my other teammate,
10715600	10716600	he was in trouble.
10716600	10717600	There was an alien next to him.
10717600	10723020	I didn't have any steam to move, and pretty much if I stayed there, he was going to die.
10723020	10728860	I didn't intend for this to happen, but I tried to shoot the alien with my grenade launcher,
10728860	10732940	and I hit the guy and he went flying, which put him in another position away from the
10732940	10735960	alien, which was a complete accident.
10735960	10739280	It wasn't something intended to happen in the game.
10739280	10742620	You know, I gotta say, I'm curious about this game.
10742620	10745300	I want to check it out, but I'm just like, ah, there's so much going on.
10745300	10747780	Maybe I'll wait for a sale, if there ever will be one.
10747780	10749700	Nintendo doesn't do sales very often.
10749700	10750700	We'll see though.
10750860	10754820	With a game like that, I think you want to get it as soon as possible, because it may
10754820	10756820	not be around too long.
10756820	10761860	It'll still be on the eShop store, but you actually want a physical copy of this game,
10761860	10767620	because you want to be out there saying, hey, I own a copy of this game when it disappears.
10767620	10773060	I'm pretty sure it's not going to do that well, just based off of what you've been using.
10773060	10776420	Kaijuto, I will give you this, if nothing else.
10776420	10779300	You were absolutely right on Fantasy Life.
10779300	10784980	I am leaning towards, trust this man, because you were right last time.
10784980	10788060	Actually, Kaijuto, you're two for two.
10788060	10793060	I didn't even talk about this at all, but with all the traveling I was doing this week,
10793060	10795740	I was in need for a mobile phone game, right?
10795740	10798260	I've been playing the crap out of King of Thieves.
10798260	10799260	You were right on that.
10799260	10801180	That game is fun.
10801180	10804740	I even finally got first place in the wooden cup or whatever it is, so I could get into
10804740	10809380	the next cup, and I get really pissed off when people raid my dungeons, and yeah, you
10809380	10810380	were right.
10810380	10812620	You know what, Kaijuto?
10812620	10814460	You have a good batting record right now, so maybe.
10814460	10819020	Yeah, but both of those games, I'm going to hang up in two seconds.
10819020	10824380	Both of those games, Codename Steam and King of Thieves, they have a great game mechanic
10824380	10830700	that I hope, even if the games don't last, I hope that type of game mechanic can last
10830700	10831700	through other games.
10831700	10835060	I know there's a ton of games that are like King of Thieves, that will compare it to Clash
10835060	10840820	of Clans and other stuff, but I would love to see something like King of Thieves, a hacking
10840820	10845020	game where instead of you breaking into people's dungeons, you're hacking people's systems,
10845020	10847260	and you get in there and stuff.
10847260	10851860	Whenever I do a run, I feel like I'm doing a hack run when I'm playing that game.
10851860	10857060	I always try to size up the level like, okay, can I do this, or am I just asking for disaster?
10857060	10860660	I'm always blown away by what people had to, because you have to beat the level yourself
10860660	10863380	or you can't have it as your fortress, so anyway.
10863380	10865980	OLR has a Facebook, right?
10865980	10866980	It sure does.
10866980	10869980	Yeah, did you connect your game to the OLR?
10869980	10873060	Because if you did, you can always send me out to steal your stuff back.
10873060	10874060	It's on my-
10874060	10875260	I can connect you on Facebook.
10875260	10878260	It's on my personal Facebook, because OLR is a group Facebook.
10878260	10879260	You can switch it out, though.
10879260	10880660	You can actually use multiple Facebooks.
10880660	10881660	Oh, okay.
10881660	10882660	I'll check that out.
10882660	10883660	All right, my friend.
10883660	10884660	All right, thank you.
10884660	10886540	All right, Melinda, let you go, but thanks for the recommendation.
10886540	10887540	Take care.
10887540	10892220	All right, Kaijuto, who I must admit has a very good batting record when it comes to
10892220	10894580	games, with that recommendation there.
10894580	10896500	We'll try to squeeze in one more quick call.
10896500	10897500	I know we're going very late.
10897500	10898500	You okay, Loki?
10898500	10899500	Still, or-
10899500	10900500	Yeah, I fixed my problem.
10900500	10904300	Oh, you've been fixing your game, the coding issues that you were having.
10904300	10907140	Yeah, it wasn't a coding issue, it was I had a wrong tag on something.
10907140	10908140	Bug, excuse me.
10908140	10909140	Bug.
10909140	10911100	Yes, but I got it fixed, so now I can't jump infinitely.
10911100	10914980	Although I will add that for Josh's free play mode, because he thought it was hilarious
10914980	10915980	today, so.
10916420	10917940	Oh, have you been having the kid testing the game?
10917940	10919340	Oh yeah, I played it for 20 minutes today.
10919340	10921340	I get a lot of good feedback from that.
10921340	10922340	All right, awesome.
10922340	10926020	If I don't hear him get super frustrated and whine about it, then I know that I'm doing
10926020	10927020	something right.
10927020	10937140	All right, well, 1877 game OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, and I just
10937140	10940700	want to say again, real quick, just recapping some housekeeping tonight, I want to say a
10940700	10948060	big welcome to The Geek Card, and Razorbug, Rob Face, and Sil, going to be joining the
10948060	10951140	network with their show, Thursdays on the network.
10951140	10954980	And for those of you listening live, you'll get to hear the first episode after OLR tonight,
10954980	10959380	which I know is very late for some of you, but I also know some of you never go to bed.
10959380	10962340	All right, phone is ringing, so let's try to get one more call in here tonight.
10962340	10963820	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
10963820	10965180	Hey, hey, it's Rama.
10965180	10967060	Hey Rama, buddy, how you doing?
10967060	10969180	I'm doing good, man.
10969180	10974740	It's so weird when I'm not here for a week, I strangely miss you people, but at least
10974740	10980380	I had like SSJ100 Matt was out there, and he hit stun, and some of the people that I
10980380	10984100	remember back in the day, we were at all games and all that, so it was good to at least see
10984100	10985100	some familiar faces.
10985100	10989380	Well, we're going to have to round the crew up, we're going to have to do MAGFest 2015,
10989380	10991900	we're going to have to get the suite and do it up.
10991900	10992900	2016, my friend, but yes.
10992900	10993900	That's what I said, 2016.
10993900	10994900	Oh, I thought you said 15, my bad.
10994900	10995900	Oh, no, no, 2016.
10995900	10996900	It's getting late.
10996900	11005980	Yeah, no, again, I don't want to say 100% yes, I am coming, because again, money is
11005980	11010260	always a thing, and there's things going on in my personal life where I just have to make
11010260	11012180	sure everything will be fine.
11012180	11015500	I don't want to get too far into that, because I don't like talking about the day life during
11015500	11019260	my night life, but as long as everything is cool there, then yeah, I definitely want to
11019260	11020260	do MAGFest again.
11020260	11024860	Let me put it this way, if I go to any East Coast show at all next year, it'll be MAGFest.
11024860	11027980	Oh, yeah, we're going to have a grand old time.
11027980	11028980	Yeah.
11028980	11035100	All right, now, I was with you about the whole thing with PAX and the press thing.
11035100	11040260	Now, before I get into that, I just want to know, why are you hating on bad dudes?
11040260	11041260	Come on, man.
11041260	11042260	Why?
11042260	11043260	Why?
11043260	11047260	I just think it's one of those rose-colored glasses games, but to be fair, I don't think
11047260	11050460	Loki let me finish my thought, he sometimes cuts me off.
11050460	11054660	On the NES, it wasn't very good, but I always thought the arcade version was fun, and I
11054660	11058300	did lose a lot of quarters on the arcade version, so to be fair.
11058300	11063700	Because I remember back in the day, there were advertisers for bad dudes in EGM and
11063700	11067820	other magazines, and what they would do was, they would just take cheap shots at Double
11067820	11068820	Dragon.
11068820	11072000	They would just basically say that with bad dudes, no matter what version you bought,
11072000	11077060	it was practically the same to the arcade, whereas Double Dragon, not so much.
11077060	11079780	And I was like, that's low, but you know what?
11079780	11083580	I think that's the thing people loved about bad dudes, it wasn't even the game, it was
11083580	11085100	everything else around the game.
11085100	11086100	You know what I mean?
11086100	11087100	Yeah.
11087100	11088100	But anyway.
11088100	11089100	Mm-hmm.
11089100	11090100	So you were gonna ask me something about PAX?
11090100	11093060	Not actually about PAX, but I agree with you, what you said at the top of the show about
11093060	11101340	covering the big shows and trying to get media coverage, because on the end of covering anime
11101340	11106820	conventions and so forth, a lot of these constant, we're just going in, taking pictures, and
11106820	11107860	that's it.
11107860	11111620	We go in, we take pictures, reviews, interviews, the whole nine yards.
11111660	11119340	I could pull up my applications for New York Comic-Con, say people that run PAX, duplicate
11119340	11120340	everything.
11120340	11127060	There is even a section that says, please give a vial of your blood, and I submit it.
11127060	11130080	I went with a crew out of the three of us.
11130080	11136020	I was the only one that got pressed, and we all sent in practically identical things.
11136060	11142140	Meanwhile, I find out later that somebody that I knew whose ratings and all that were
11142140	11148140	lower than mine, but he got in because he BS'd his way in because of the number of hits
11148140	11149140	and likes on his Facebook.
11149140	11150660	I'm just like, you know what?
11150660	11151660	Table flip.
11151660	11155540	Here's the thing, and I wanna be very clear on this, and I know you understand this, but
11155540	11159900	before, because in my head, I'm fearing the tweets and the emails I'm gonna get where
11159900	11164700	Rob was just a big baby and threw a fit, and if he wants to get in his media, then maybe
11164700	11167660	he should do more or whatever, blah, blah, blah, blah.
11167660	11171220	My issue is not the fact that I didn't get in his media.
11171220	11172800	That is not my problem.
11172800	11178060	My issue is the fact that I did not see those rules enforced consistently.
11178060	11184140	I did not know what those rules even really were, and the fact that I couldn't seem to
11184140	11188780	talk to anybody about it, and I found the fact that when I'm not getting any responses
11188780	11192900	and Bobby's not getting any responses and the other people are, I just kind of find
11192900	11198420	that rude, and that's, it's the lack of consistency that's really ticking me off, and the fact
11198420	11203180	that we're kind of taking a dump on podcasts when everybody's about YouTube and Twitch
11203180	11204180	TV.
11204180	11205180	Well, guess what?
11205180	11210180	I know of quite a few people that like to listen to podcasts, not just OLR, but podcasts
11210180	11216560	during their workday while they do data entry or something that doesn't require them to
11216560	11217560	be listening.
11217560	11220020	They just need their ears and their fingers or whatever.
11220020	11222820	There's still a driving, hello?
11222820	11227060	There's still a huge market for all of that with podcasts, and even though I can't show
11227060	11233060	game footage, I can talk to people about the hobby they love, and that's what I want to
11233060	11239180	do more, and that's what I like to do with the press access is network, network, network,
11239180	11240960	and try to get more people on the show.
11240960	11244260	Try to ask the questions people really want to know the answers to and not just regurgitate
11244260	11249940	the press releases and share those stories and a lot of the positive that happens in
11249940	11255580	games because there's so much fucking negativity, and sometimes we need to ask the negative
11255580	11259100	questions, like, you know, as we did earlier with EA and Maxis and that whole thing, but
11259100	11260100	there's a lot of positive.
11260100	11261100	Don't get me started on that.
11261100	11264420	Anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to go on a rant, but you got me wrapped up.
11264420	11269140	No, it's okay, because not the fact that it's your show, but I agree with you 100%, like,
11269140	11273860	I have one person already, he writes my reviews, and, you know, we got people who like to read
11273860	11279860	the reviews, but when you sit down in that chair with your friends that covered the convention
11279980	11284380	and you just go, you start talking about it, it gets much more entertaining.
11284380	11291220	If you ask me personally, reviewing a trade show, convention or whatever, on an audio
11291220	11297940	video platform, it gets more people, more people get it, they feel your enthusiasm,
11297940	11299580	they feel how you feel.
11299580	11306700	I tell people when I go to shows, these conventions, that I do my absolute best with my crew to
11306700	11308900	get as much coverage as we can.
11308940	11313980	So when we sit down and give you this coverage, we want you to live vicariously through us.
11313980	11317580	We want you to feel that, you know what, even though I missed it, I was still glad I was
11317580	11320540	kind of able to be there through these people.
11320540	11322460	That's what it comes down to.
11322460	11326700	That's bringing the voice of geeks and the diversity everywhere.
11326700	11331980	Anyhow, sorry, I guess we're all getting on a little bit of a rant right now, but I guess
11331980	11336020	that was just kind of a personally frustrating thing, especially having come from, dude,
11336020	11340260	we broadcast on the show floor in recent memory to that.
11340260	11343940	And I think, and that's why, again, I think it's important, and then I promise I'll stop
11343940	11344940	talking about it.
11344940	11346180	I think it's just important to get out there.
11346180	11351020	I think people have the perception that PAX is still that, oh, hey, it's those guys that
11351020	11356020	do that funny comic about games and they put this whole thing on themselves and they really
11356020	11358900	have these rules where nobody's treated differently and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.
11358900	11362220	I'm just telling you guys, that fucking changed five years ago.
11362220	11367660	And of course, the bigger people aren't talking about it, but I'm here to tell you it changed
11367660	11369500	and it is not that show anymore.
11369500	11370500	Yeah.
11370500	11377780	And like, you know, when, when there are people who are willingly taking personal days to
11377780	11383620	sit at their computer, just to fight for a badge, at that point, I'm like, no, what?
11383620	11384620	It's not, no.
11384620	11390980	I will start doing the smaller and the mid range conventions because they love and appreciate
11390980	11396500	everything, you know, because, well, sorry, I just address something real quick in chat
11396500	11398180	because I just, I have to address it.
11398180	11402380	Zaku is saying that a VOG needs to get their assets to Delaware to incorporate.
11402380	11405020	Once you're an LLC, your media penis will grow tenfold.
11405020	11411420	Actually, it's not in Delaware, but a VOG actually is an LLC out of Georgia, which we
11411420	11414160	picked, you know, cause obviously Bobby's based there.
11414160	11420220	So Georgia, you know, and has a lot of, there's a lot of Atlanta game stuff in that area too.
11420220	11423940	So yeah, we actually are an LLC and we have a business license.
11423940	11428460	We have all that stuff that I don't necessarily need to talk about on the air, but yeah, yeah,
11428460	11429460	we're covered.
11429460	11430460	We're, we're legit.
11430460	11434460	I'd like to, I'd like to think we're legit, but you know, Zaku's right, but one thing
11434460	11439380	I discovered with the big conventions, they're like, okay, how many hits do you have?
11439380	11440380	What can you do?
11440380	11441380	What can you do?
11441380	11448460	And we're like, you know, the sad part is it's coming down to quantity over quality.
11448460	11450700	And then, well, and then how do they measure those hits?
11450700	11455220	They use things like Alexa, seriously, who has that toolbar still installed?
11455220	11456340	What, what?
11456340	11460460	And especially like my bread and butter is not necessarily web content.
11460460	11463800	So I don't believe that I can be measured in the same way, which is why it's extremely
11463800	11469520	frustrating when I see other people that know of no tea, no shade, I'm getting more hits
11469520	11475280	than as far as the podcast and the, I have third party stats to prove that that aren't
11475280	11476280	having the problem.
11476280	11477280	It's just, yeah.
11477280	11478280	Yeah.
11478280	11479280	Anyway.
11479280	11480280	Yeah.
11480280	11481280	Cause we had a discussion about this on my Facebook a couple of years ago.
11481280	11482480	After this, I'm getting out of here.
11482480	11485600	One convention said your Alexa rating had to be at a certain number.
11485600	11491840	We're, Bunch was having a pow wow on my Facebook saying an anime, manga field, there's like
11491840	11495320	maybe five of the big name sites that will do coverage.
11495320	11498540	And then it's all of us little independent guys and we're looking together.
11498540	11503360	We come to a realization because that one rule, there's only going to be like five press
11503360	11509400	sites at this convention compared to maybe 10, 15, 20 doing complete coverage that will
11509400	11511560	do a lot more than what others will get.
11511560	11515440	I think, and this is important too, is that, you know, I appreciate all the advice you
11515440	11518480	guys are giving in chat and so forth, but you have to realize, and part of the announcements
11518480	11522760	Bobby and I, you know, made earlier kind of go in line with this is that we kind of made
11522760	11528240	peace with the fact that E3 and PAX don't want us because we were able to sit back and
11528240	11533480	ask the question, do we really need them or are we able to accomplish more spending
11533480	11535060	our money other places?
11535060	11540180	And I think we kind of came to the consensus that, you know what, we really need to focus
11540180	11542880	on where people don't seem to be focusing on.
11542880	11546440	And that is the small to mid-level cons and that, and there's nothing wrong with being
11546440	11547440	small to mid-level.
11547440	11549280	Again, I think you can have a lot of fun.
11549280	11553700	We'll do our one big con a year dragon con because you know, it's, it's local for our
11553700	11557400	co-owner and it's like 20 small cons all happening at once.
11557400	11559920	And they actually respond to emails.
11559920	11563520	And even though their media rule, I'll, I'll say this, I love dragon con.
11563520	11564760	We never get in this media.
11564760	11566240	We're probably never going to get in this media.
11566240	11571320	Their media rules are extremely stringent, but at least they're consistent and at least
11571320	11573440	you can contact them to talk about it.
11573440	11574440	Exactly.
11574440	11575440	Anyway.
11575440	11576440	Big sites cover everything else.
11576440	11578520	We cover everything else for the people.
11578520	11579520	That's all it is.
11579520	11580520	That's right.
11580520	11581520	That's right.
11581520	11584480	I think if we can bring coverage to some things you otherwise might not know about, then I
11584480	11585480	think we've done our job.
11585480	11586480	Anyway.
11586480	11587480	Uh, Ron, Mike, I gotta let you go.
11587480	11588480	My friend.
11588480	11589480	Take care of everybody.
11589480	11590480	Stay fabulous.
11590480	11591480	Bye.
11591480	11592480	Anime Jam session.
11592480	11593480	Everybody's check that out.
11593480	11594480	Uh, Tuesday nights here at the voice geeks network.
11594480	11597240	I'm so sorry to those of you guys that didn't get through, uh, we actually should have ended
11597240	11598240	a while ago.
11598240	11600360	Uh, and here we are still going.
11600360	11606440	Um, so, uh, we got to wrap up, um, thank you guys for listening.
11606440	11609300	If you have an email for us, participate at orange on twitter.com.
11609300	11614920	You can also tweet us twitter.com slash O L R. Uh, and uh, you know, we appreciate you
11614920	11617600	guys being here every week and supporting the show.
11617600	11622440	We, you know, the, the E3 media and the packs me that that would be cool.
11622440	11626160	We'd love to do that, but honestly, you guys being here, that's, that's the, that's the
11626160	11627160	real reward.
11627160	11629080	And all we ask here, we're not asking for your money.
11629080	11632200	I'm not going to direct you to some place to go send us money.
11632200	11637480	Uh, but we would appreciate any positive feedback that you would have in spreading the word
11637480	11638480	about our show.
11638480	11641180	Uh, if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange on radio, please tell a friend or two
11641180	11642180	about this show.
11642180	11643180	Help spread the word.
11643500	11648020	If you really can't think of anybody to tell a five star review on iTunes or, um, a five
11648020	11651420	star review on a stitcher, those things go a long way.
11651420	11657180	Trust me, uh, in helping, um, helping us get out there and grow our family so that we can
11657180	11663500	diversify and have even more voices here at, um, the voice of geeks network and orange
11663500	11664500	lounge radio.
11664500	11665500	Anyway.
11665500	11667300	Um, again, dark soccer.
11667300	11671520	I doubt she's listening this week and a totally understandably why, but we are all thinking
11671520	11676320	about you dark soccer and looking forward to seeing her again next week.
11676320	11677320	Um, Loki.
11677320	11678320	Sorry.
11678320	11679600	It was late tonight.
11679600	11680920	Hopefully the misses will understand.
11680920	11681920	Whatever.
11681920	11682920	It's fine.
11682920	11683920	He'll be all right.
11683920	11684920	Thanks for the pizza.
11684920	11685920	No problem.
11685920	11686920	Good times.
11686920	11687920	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
11687920	11688920	I forgot.
11688920	11690560	The final fantasy type zero is also releasing this week.
11690560	11691560	Did you not say that?
11691560	11692560	I did.
11692560	11693560	Yeah, whatever.
11693560	11694560	It's no big deal.
11694560	11695560	Little behind the scenes.
11695560	11699440	Look since, since I'm spilling all this tea tonight, I ran out of the room when he did
11699440	11703680	release dates because I was trying to get Irene and they, they were coming over.
11703680	11705400	So yeah, I didn't hear that you'd miss that.
11705400	11707560	Otherwise I would have corrected you on that.
11707560	11708560	I remembered.
11708560	11710200	Now I'm like, that just crept out of nowhere though.
11710200	11711200	Didn't it?
11711200	11712200	It did.
11712200	11714520	And uh, I, I do want to pick it up just because of the demo.
11714520	11718400	I mean, I guess final fantasy games are cool too, but I don't know anything about type
11718400	11719400	zero at all.
11719400	11722760	So, um, it looked pretty cool from what I was looking at on the packs monitors.
11722760	11727920	Uh, and then again, that's, that game has also been around since, uh, PSP granted it
11727920	11728920	was in Japan.
11728920	11731480	But I'm looking forward to playing it here for the first time.
11731480	11734600	So, uh, and of course that final fantasy 15 demo.
11734600	11735600	Yes.
11735600	11736600	All right.
11736600	11739600	Uh, my final thought tonight is, um, I'm going to say the same thing.
11739600	11743040	I'm, I'm very much looking forward to type zero, but I'm going to really try to play
11743040	11747480	some more games that aren't Diablo and final fantasy 14 this week, but I'm going to play
11747480	11749360	a lot of those too.
11749360	11750360	What can I say?
11750360	11751760	I love playing video games.
11751760	11753800	I know you guys all do too.
11753800	11756520	Thank you so much for being here and making it a great show tonight.
11756520	11758480	We'll be back in seven days to do it all again.
11758480	11759480	Have a good night.
