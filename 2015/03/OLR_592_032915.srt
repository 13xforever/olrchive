00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,080
This week, although the Smash Bros. series amiibos are not yet complete, Mario is getting

2
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,680
friendlier with a classic design, releasing imminently.

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,680
The collectibles keep coming along with this week in gaming news, and it all begins along

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:29,960
with your comments and more, right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,840
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

6
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,520
where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:45,120
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with our 592nd episode for March the 29th of 2015.

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,920
Here with you over the next few hours to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the

9
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,080
gamer lifestyle, style, style, style, style.

10
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:58,440
Here with me, Rob Roberts, and over there taunting me already, Wob Wobbits, a serious

11
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,840
interview with Wob Wobbits and DarkSakura.

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,680
How are you, Ms. Jamie Summers, or DarkSakura?

13
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,680
I have a sinus infection.

14
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,680
Do you?

15
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,680
I'm sorry to hear that.

16
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,900
You know what, I blame Alabama.

17
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,640
As long as you're not contagious?

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,480
You can't get sinus infections unless you dig your finger up my nose and pull some bacteria

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,480
and eat it.

20
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,140
And even then, highly unlikely.

21
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,140
Don't test me.

22
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,140
Ew!

23
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,140
I'm going home, bye.

24
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:27,200
I'll do a lot on a dare, no I'm kidding.

25
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,720
I thought it was funny because earlier this week you gave me a call and you were like,

26
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,800
Wob Wobbits, I don't know why you're Barbara Walters all of a sudden, Wob Wobbits, what

27
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,640
was the condition that Alan had when he got sick?

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,000
I started to feel like scratchy and sore on like Tuesday, but usually that's how my sinus

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
infection hit.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,200
Every time I come back from Alabama, sinus infection.

31
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
There it is.

32
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
And I didn't even think about it.

33
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,520
I thought, oh, Alan was sick maybe, but that was like a week and a half.

34
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,000
Something about traveling to Alabama just makes you sick.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I don't know.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,880
I don't know what it is.

37
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,880
The humidity.

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,880
The humidity.

39
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,880
That's it.

40
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,880
Magnolias, camellias, azaleas.

41
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,880
All right.

42
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,400
Also, here in studio, of course, as he is every week, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

43
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
Hi.

44
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
How are you, Loki?

45
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
I'm fine.

46
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,960
Now, Loki said earlier, I just want to quote for you guys, that he may have had too much

47
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
bacon.

48
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:23,880
No, I said there may have been too much bacon on the pizza because it was too salty.

49
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,880
I didn't have a...

50
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,680
See, the problem was...

51
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,400
How appropriate for you that it's a little too salty here on O.L.R.

52
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
Here is my dilemma.

53
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
Okay.

54
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,360
The gas station I went to is one of those grocery store gas stations.

55
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,920
They only had a fucking 16 ounce Red Bull.

56
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,120
That is not enough Red Bull for me to, you know, first off, be awake right now, and second

57
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,480
to have with that pizza.

58
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,560
So, you know, I have to make sure my sodium intake is good.

59
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,560
Be careful with those energy drinks.

60
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
I know.

61
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,560
Be careful with those energy drinks.

62
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,240
I have one a day.

63
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,240
I mean...

64
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,240
I guess so did my husband, and he ended up in the hospital for...

65
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
Most days I have one a day.

66
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,240
His heart.

67
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,240
So be careful.

68
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,240
Be careful.

69
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,240
It's just a little bit of caffeine.

70
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,240
All right.

71
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,240
Along with salt.

72
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,480
Make sure you get in your exercise.

73
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,480
Work out with the kids.

74
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,480
All right.

75
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,240
Of course, we are here in studio, but you guys are out there in the internet.

76
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,240
Hello everybody who is listening live to us at the Voice of Geeks Network, vog.network.com,

77
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,200
where we do tape our show live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern

78
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,560
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

79
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,740
And Bobby Black Wolf is actually live in our chat room there along with some of the other

80
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,740
folks saying...

81
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,800
Starting us off tonight, Bobby says, I'm hunting Wob Wobbits.

82
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,880
So a little bit of Elmer Fudd there, action.

83
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,880
How wonderful.

84
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:45,640
Anyhow, of course, if you are listening on the podcast, a big hello to you as well.

85
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,980
If for whatever reason it's your very first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio, we've

86
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,840
been doing this for a while.

87
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:57,340
We started this show back in June of 2002, myself, Dark Sakura, and Loki all met playing

88
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,760
Dance Dance Revolution at a local arcade here, Sun Splash.

89
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,400
And we wanted to make a show about the little community that we were building because it

90
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,800
was like Wednesday night worship, Wednesday night.

91
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,040
And I'm not talking about like false idols or anything like that, but it's just what

92
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,040
it was.

93
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,080
Wednesday nights, we all got together.

94
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,760
We would go to play DDR and we just stand around the machine like it was some cult with

95
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,880
a little flashing lights.

96
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,880
Play me.

97
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,880
Give me a dollar.

98
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,600
Give me a cute Eurobeat.

99
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,440
So that was, that was us.

100
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,480
And after we played DDR, we'd go to the diner right across the street and then we'd talk

101
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,480
a little bit of smack.

102
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,000
It was the old people diner on top of that.

103
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That's right.

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It was.

105
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,460
And we talk a little smack and good things and bad things about our favorite pastime.

106
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,920
And so we've extended that into the internet and with you guys at the world's largest dinner

107
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,720
table, diner table here.

108
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,480
Anyway, we have some very special guests here in studio.

109
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,680
And I'm so excited to welcome these guys to the show.

110
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,600
Speaking of Malwij, as I see talking about in our chat room, Wuv Twuwuv says a game guru

111
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,880
in our chat.

112
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,320
We met up a few weeks ago and it was literally one of those moments of where have you been

113
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,320
all my life?

114
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,960
And now here we are joining forces for you gamers out there.

115
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,680
I'm so excited to welcome from the Sacramento IGDA chapter tonight.

116
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,760
We have two representatives here in studio.

117
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,480
Say hello everybody to Gabriel.

118
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,000
And go ahead and pick up the mic there and say hello.

119
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And Brianna.

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Hi.

121
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Hi.

122
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
How are you?

123
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Ladies first.

124
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Ladies first.

125
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm great.

126
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And I'm so happy to be here.

127
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,680
And oh boy, I can't believe you had me in here.

128
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,080
Wait, what does that mean?

129
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,080
Wait a minute.

130
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,800
Does that mean she's a loose cannon?

131
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
I don't know.

132
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
I can't confirm or deny that.

133
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Sorry.

134
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,280
How are you doing Gabriel?

135
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
Never better.

136
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,280
We're here.

137
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,440
This is like I'm five minutes from home and it's like I'm in a whole other world right

138
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,440
now.

139
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,440
Beautiful.

140
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,960
You were mentioning that beforehand that when I gave you the address to our top secret location

141
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,000
where we tape in the Sacramento area, you found out that's five minutes from my house.

142
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes.

143
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You've been doing that crap for years.

144
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Seriously.

145
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,360
I've been here three years and only now.

146
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,360
Only now.

147
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,360
And like, yeah.

148
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,360
Yeah.

149
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,360
Seriously.

150
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
Way too long to have connected.

151
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
Well, you know what?

152
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,960
It goes both ways because now I'm realizing, holy crap, somebody's developing a Wii U game

153
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,280
five minutes from my house.

154
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,280
Damn straight.

155
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,320
Tell us a little bit about your company Gabriel.

156
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,000
You actually have like a little startup indie company and you're making games as well.

157
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Tell us a little bit about that.

158
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah.

159
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So we've got, so the idea behind Nascent Games was, I needed a definition for the studio.

160
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,080
You know, like where were we, what were the games that we're making going to do?

161
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,720
What were we trying to achieve with our games?

162
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:44,040
And the idea was we wanted to, I hate to say the phrase take it to the next level because

163
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,520
it's so cliche, it's so overused and I try not to do that.

164
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,360
So I tried to approach it a little differently just, you know, for me it was leave a good

165
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,360
experience for every player that tries our stuff.

166
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:02,480
Whether it's the player by definition of actually physically playing the game or by actually

167
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,800
watching the game and saying, ooh, I want to see what happens next.

168
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:13,200
So you know, so for me it was all about, you know, that ascent of the experience.

169
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,040
You know, ascending and wanting to find out more, take it higher.

170
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:21,080
So just without getting all cliche about it all.

171
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,000
You know what, sometimes the answer is a little simpler than some might think.

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You know what I mean?

173
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,780
Like some people want to know, where did the name Orange Lounge Radio come from?

174
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,320
Because Orange Lounge was on a DDR machine and we thought like, you know, oh, we're all

175
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,320
sitting, we're lounging around talking about games.

176
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,320
It's a great name.

177
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,240
So it's really that simple, people.

178
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,240
That's all right.

179
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,360
Also in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com we have Blakeman, who actually renamed his

180
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
nickname there.

181
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
Wow.

182
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,520
Blakeman in our chat room says, excuse my ignorance, but what does IGDA mean?

183
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,320
That is the International Game Developers Association, right?

184
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,320
I should have said that, right?

185
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,320
Yes, that's quite okay.

186
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,280
Yeah, International Game Developers Association and what that is, they're a worldwide non-profit

187
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,280
organization.

188
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,600
They represent, I mean, all the countries possible, I mean, especially here.

189
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:16,380
And it's a connection of game developers and gamers who just want to get involved more

190
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,800
in the community, in the industry.

191
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,680
And without, you know, without the, what's the best way to put this?

192
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,000
I mean, I think it's just really, it's just a huge resource.

193
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:38,200
IGDA is just a massive resource for people to learn more about how they can become, you

194
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,760
know, how they can put their talents to use, or learn to put talents to use, or even just

195
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,760
learn a talent.

196
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:49,320
You know, just from the idea guy, which is me, to the programmer who can't draw.

197
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,520
They want to find somebody, you know, who does art.

198
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:59,100
Or the community outreach folks who want to bring folks together to do more.

199
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:04,860
You know, to do more and, you know, really for the love of it all.

200
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,680
I kind of hashtagged for the love of the game quite a bit.

201
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,540
And there's kind of a core reason behind that.

202
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,740
We maybe get to that later.

203
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,820
But yeah, I mean, it's really for that.

204
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,820
It's for the love of the game.

205
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,900
And then hopefully we make a few bucks out of it.

206
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:20,100
But otherwise, otherwise, yeah, we just, we love what we do.

207
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,980
I think, you know, a lot of people out there, I would think not so much the listeners to

208
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,980
this show.

209
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,420
But you go on Twitter, you go on any message forum, and you see sometimes a lot, and there's

210
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:35,340
a running joke here on OLR about GamersHateEverything.com, right, where, you know, where anything is

211
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,660
announced and there's always like instant snark that goes with that, right?

212
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,980
And we try to be...

213
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,700
Are you talking about someone in particular?

214
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,020
There is no salty individual I can think of.

215
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,340
But, you know, all joking aside, I mean, we have fun with it.

216
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,660
And there are some games sometimes that for whatever reason don't turn out as well as

217
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,660
they could be.

218
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,860
And usually that reason is middle management, but we won't go there.

219
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:01,740
But I think some people don't really realize what goes into making a game.

220
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,020
There's so much that goes into making a game, even a tiny little indie game, there's a lot

221
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,020
that goes with it, right?

222
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,900
So when you talk about resource sharing, I mean, we've even had, you know, Loki and he's

223
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,820
been talking about some of the various projects he's been working on for a long time here

224
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,900
on the show.

225
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,860
Maybe he needs to sign up for your organization, I don't know.

226
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,820
He really should, because I'm looking at what he's doing right now and then I didn't realize

227
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,820
you were...

228
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,500
You're seeing something like nobody else is getting to see, by the way, that whole, his

229
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,020
mysterious VoG Jam game that ended in January.

230
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,020
Yeah.

231
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,020
Make it happen, man.

232
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,020
We're right here.

233
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,020
So...

234
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,060
Just wasn't on time, unfortunately.

235
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:39,460
Bobby is taking so much pleasure right now in the fact that Loki is being lectured by

236
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,460
the IGDA here in the studio.

237
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:48,660
Listen, if it's okay, if Zelda can be delayed, then I can delay my game.

238
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,660
It's perfectly fine.

239
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,660
I mean, I don't want to compare it to it.

240
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,020
Is this the agony in the SSC featuring Loki?

241
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,660
I'm not going to be the one that's going to make those comparisons, but I mean, if

242
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,660
you want to draw those, that's fine.

243
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,660
When will it be finished?

244
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,660
When it's finished.

245
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,660
Okay.

246
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:06,060
But all this joking about deadlines aside, you have talked about how finding music for

247
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:11,860
your game was like your big issue, and it took you a while to find that right resource,

248
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,860
right?

249
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,860
Yes.

250
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:21,500
Just listening to everything that's CC by 3.0 or whatever on SoundCloud and browsing

251
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,540
by genres.

252
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,580
You know what, you and I could have just connected much sooner because I actually make

253
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,620
my own music for my games.

254
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:35,100
So yeah, double whammy, man.

255
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,580
The music he did end up finding is actually really awesome.

256
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,580
Oh, good.

257
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,060
And if by awesome you mean really annoying because it was on purpose that I picked a

258
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,620
really annoying dubstep song for the game.

259
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,620
All right.

260
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,340
Anyway, this isn't about you, Loki.

261
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,860
This is about our guests here in the studio this week.

262
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,460
And I do want to talk to Brianna in a minute as well, but since Gabriel, you have the mic

263
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:59,540
right now, I want to talk about specifically the game that you're working on here.

264
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,960
Because I know there's a lot of people, it's no secret right now, we've talked about on

265
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,780
previous episodes of the show, we're going to be doing this event where we're live streaming

266
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,940
on April 11th and y'all can check it out.

267
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:14,380
It's the Sacramento in the Arcade event, which is presented by you guys in April 11th from

268
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,540
10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

269
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,780
You can tune in at vognetwork.com.

270
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:22,500
Or if you're like that 3% of our listener base that lives in Sacramento, or even the

271
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,900
Bay Area, heck, come on out to the show, check it out, we'll be there live in person.

272
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,320
But I'm sure there's a lot of people out there that might, you know, because we have listeners

273
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:37,220
in Mexico, we have listeners in Australia, Japan, Sweden, whatever happened to that man?

274
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:42,500
I see him on Tumblr, but anyway, they might be wondering, why do I care about some event

275
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,820
happening in Sacramento?

276
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,820
But you guys are making games that everybody's going to play, right?

277
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,820
Yes sir.

278
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,820
That's the high goal.

279
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:57,580
Well, it's more, it goes, see that's on the surface, yes, but it goes beyond that.

280
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:05,740
For me, you know, there's a parallel going on with my startup as Nascent Games and, you

281
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:11,780
know, founding that and then being the founder and chair for the chapter for IG Day Sacramento.

282
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:18,340
For me, it was when I started my games, you know, even just having the confidence to say

283
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,420
I'm going to make a game.

284
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,680
Because that's the first biggest step, it's just having the confidence to make it.

285
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:30,820
But then it became, becomes a thing of who else is out there that's struggling for that

286
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,820
direction?

287
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:37,260
And, you know, long story short, you know, it's, we are now, we are now in a position

288
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:43,300
where my main goal, one of my biggest goals for this chapter is happening now.

289
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,740
We are creating talent here in Sacramento.

290
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,300
We are not outsourcing it anywhere, you know, unless we really, really need to, because

291
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,240
I mean, you know, times are tough, you know, we just sometimes we need to.

292
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,560
But there's so much talent here in Sacramento and so much of this talent have been very

293
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:04,260
hesitant, you know, because they don't know where to go, they don't know who to connect

294
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:10,020
with, they don't know who to talk to, or they have connected with people and they have

295
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:14,820
lost, you know, they have been screwed over, you know, their trust has been tainted.

296
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,340
And they're like, what do we do now?

297
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,580
And you mentioned, you know, briefly mentioned the Bay Area, a lot of them, how many people

298
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:26,140
we've met from LA, from the Bay, they were from here, but they left Sacramento because

299
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,500
they wanted, you know, they wanted something better and they ended up in some way, shape

300
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,820
or form got screwed over.

301
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,920
So now they're back.

302
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,900
And now, so now it's not just games that everyone's going to be able to play.

303
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:40,460
It's the games are being made by Sacramento folks.

304
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:46,100
And now, you know, the person trying these games is not going to be just a commenter

305
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:52,420
on an app, you know, it's going to be in your face, like, this is what I think, you know,

306
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,580
or, you know, and so on and so forth.

307
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:59,460
And there's that in your face interaction, how old school yet how new it seems today

308
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,460
in 2015.

309
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,100
Yeah.

310
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,740
Oh, my gosh.

311
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,260
So much I can ask you guys about.

312
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,260
It's only a three hour show, however.

313
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:13,420
But let me let me just guys seriously don't even we met up for dinner a couple weeks ago.

314
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,420
We could have been there all night.

315
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,700
But anyway, let me ask you about this specifically the game you're working on.

316
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:23,000
You're working on a game with your with nascent games, you are creating a game.

317
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,780
You just had a big demo go out to DeSoura, right?

318
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,540
And this is something that people should be keeping their eye on is going to come to the

319
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,620
Wii U eventually, right?

320
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,620
Yes, they will.

321
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,620
Tell us a little bit about Crumple.

322
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:40,260
So Crumple, our very, very first game demo ever on anything, just which was extremely

323
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:46,460
unexpected, like we I really didn't like we in the back of our head, we thought, yeah,

324
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,460
we can make it happen.

325
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,820
But you didn't you don't really believe completely it's going to actually happen.

326
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,100
But now it has.

327
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,700
And I've been very, very fortunate to connect with the right people, you know, just taking

328
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,620
that initiative to connect with folks.

329
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,580
And now we're at this place, our demos out there on DeSoura.

330
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,540
We are at a probably around two thousand two thousand two thousand visits and tries for

331
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,340
just the demo in a week.

332
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,580
And that's insane because I don't know who the hell they are.

333
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,580
I don't know who they are.

334
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:19,260
I mean, and I know I know we have, you know, I think I think five different countries.

335
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:26,060
I mean, I've seen people trying our game from Ukraine, Italy, Germany, Finland.

336
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,620
I don't know who these people are.

337
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:33,140
You know, you and I have the exact same reactions, but for you it's a game, for me it's a podcast.

338
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,140
It's the same thing.

339
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:39,340
You sit there and you go, somebody in Belgium's listening to my show and sending me an email.

340
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,340
That's so cool.

341
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,340
Yeah, it's insane.

342
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:46,020
And the and the and the reviews have been we've actually we actually got our first review

343
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,020
from some person.

344
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,660
I have no idea who they are, but they reviewed our game.

345
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,680
They're very, very in-depth with it.

346
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,420
The commentary, you know, especially from my own dear Brianna as well.

347
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,780
She left some fantastic commentary, especially the Twitter was nuts that day.

348
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,220
But anyway, so Crumple, back to Crumple.

349
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:07,260
So Crumple is, yes, it is going to be out for PC first, then for the Wii U.

350
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,220
Crumple is about this little envelope that comes to life and it wakes up in this burning

351
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,220
paper factory.

352
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,380
I kind of wanted to go with the similar approach of Limbo, you know, where this little boy

353
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,140
wakes up in Limbo.

354
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,740
We have no idea how the hell it got there, but, you know, it just has to keep going.

355
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,080
So I kind of wanted to approach it that way with with Crumple.

356
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,480
But obviously, you know, it's not it's not in like the first circle of hell or anything

357
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,480
like that.

358
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,980
You know, it's just it's just in the burning paper factory.

359
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,900
Just wanted to keep it simple and then proceed from there.

360
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,080
The game is going to be released in episodes.

361
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:43,580
So the first full episode for Crumple should hopefully be out sometime in May and then

362
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:48,980
episode two and three, hopefully about three or four months apart from each one.

363
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,340
And then the idea will be, once we get all those episodes out, get it ported over to

364
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,340
the Wii U.

365
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,420
I would need to find a new programmer for it, though, because Wii U doesn't play Flash

366
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,420
games.

367
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,700
So I have to use either HTML5 or JavaScript, but anyway, technical stuff.

368
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,740
So now I'm sorry.

369
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,620
So our other game tripping my own my own partner.

370
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:14,400
So our other game is Kinship and Kinship was actually the first game we started on.

371
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,580
But it is admittedly a bit of an ambitious game.

372
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,580
But that's what I want.

373
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,260
I like, you know, you need that ambition, but then you need your simple stuff.

374
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:28,420
So Kinship is essentially an action story implemented shmup.

375
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,620
And you know, shmups are, you know, a dime a dozen, one of the oldest genres out there

376
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,620
in video gaming.

377
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:38,340
But very few of them have ever implemented any sort of story, let alone any sort of decent

378
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,340
story.

379
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,340
And I said, you know what?

380
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:50,060
I want to take the things I loved about Gradius 3, Axlae, R-Type, games like that, but have

381
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:56,060
some sort of deeper-ish, not Mass Effect deeper-ish, but I mean, you know, just deeper narrative

382
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:01,940
to it where, as I mentioned before, where people were maybe like Brianna, who may not

383
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:08,180
be into shmups, can just watch it and be like, wow, that's great, that's cool, what happens

384
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,180
next?

385
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,220
I know who you might need to talk to.

386
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,020
And I would be remiss if I did not mention, because we just had them on the show like

387
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:18,660
six weeks ago, but the guys behind Starmazer, which is a game that's on Kickstarter, that's

388
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,900
a shooter meets a point and click adventure game.

389
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,540
I don't know if you've seen that, but when you kind of talk about that, I mean, I'm sure

390
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,380
you're not thinking like the same direction or whatever, but like that, I couldn't help

391
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,020
it have that pop in my mind.

392
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,540
But that's so funny that all these like different ideas, and I think it was, I was hearing a

393
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,980
lot of that same thing from them is that this is the game we wanted to make.

394
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:41,100
This is our vision, and we've got these two genres, and we wanted a game that had both.

395
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,100
So that's awesome.

396
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,980
Yeah, that's actually good, I would love to actually connect with them.

397
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:52,460
And now that, you know, now with the first game being on Desura for a demo, and learning

398
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:58,460
that Desura actually accepts demos for Unity, because Kinship's being made in Unity, we're

399
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:04,580
going to get a demo for Kinship on Unity, hopefully in the next couple of months, hopefully

400
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:09,420
within May as well, and finally tease that more as well.

401
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:12,180
So yeah, there's some great, great stuff happening.

402
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,260
You're going to be a busy guy in these coming months between this event in April and then

403
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,300
these releases in May.

404
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,780
By the way, since you mentioned you've got about 2,000 people that have checked out Crumple

405
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:25,740
so far, I'm sure our dozens and dozens of listeners can help out a little bit and at

406
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,100
least get that number up maybe 10 more.

407
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:37,220
So let's go and give you guys the link www.desura.com slash games slash crumple, that's C-R-U-M-P-L-E

408
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,220
if you want to check that out.

409
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:43,460
And it's a very, the biggest important thing that I ask for, and I cannot stress this enough,

410
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:47,740
please leave feedback in the comments, even if it means sending me a private message to

411
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,740
let me know what you think.

412
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,260
You know, if you're following me on Twitter, shoot me a direct message, whatever the case

413
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,260
may be.

414
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:57,020
I want to know what you guys think because it's very vital to the development, you know,

415
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,500
the further development of this game, you know, but don't, you know, don't be an ass

416
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,500
about it.

417
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,580
You know, just talk to me, be constructive, you know, be constructive about what you're

418
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,580
saying.

419
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,580
Tell me why.

420
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,020
You know, I'm not going to cry about it.

421
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:12,020
I've got a very thick skin, I'm from Jersey, so we can, I can handle this.

422
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,020
We good.

423
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,020
You know what I'm saying?

424
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:16,540
I just want constructive criticism because if I hear BS, all I'm going to say is plus

425
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,540
one out of spite and move forward and I'm not going to do, and they're going to be like,

426
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,540
what is he doing that for?

427
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,960
Because I'm not going to feed to that.

428
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,460
So that's all I ask.

429
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,820
So since you brought up, you are from Jersey that led a spark in my head that I have to

430
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,420
ask you about this because I will say the Northeast folks that I do know that listen

431
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,700
to this show would kick my butt if they knew, I knew you were involved with this and didn't

432
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:39,540
ask you about it, but you used to do a lot of stuff with Magfest right out back East,

433
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,540
right?

434
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,540
I did.

435
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,540
Yes.

436
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,540
Yes.

437
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:47,620
I was, um, I, I w I just did volunteer work, um, at, at I think Mac Fest, not eight or

438
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,020
nine, I think Mac Fest eight.

439
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:53,500
And then a couple of years later I had moved here to, to, to Sacramento and reconnected

440
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,860
with, with, uh, the team there and had asked them a couple of, this was a couple of years

441
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,860
ago.

442
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,160
I had asked them, Hey, look, what is it?

443
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,900
What would it cost to get me a table?

444
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,300
Cause I'm working on games now.

445
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,700
I'm w this was when I only had kinship.

446
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,500
I said, well, what would it cost to get a table?

447
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,860
They're like, well, wait a minute, you know, w wait a minute, we're doing something for

448
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,860
indie for Mac Fest.

449
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,660
They're like, do you want to run the department?

450
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:16,260
I'm like, we remember how you helped us so greatly with volunteering.

451
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,820
I'm like, wait, wait, wait, wait, you know, I'm in California.

452
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,940
I just want to show off my game.

453
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:24,780
You're asking me to help run this new department.

454
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,780
And yeah.

455
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:31,060
And it turned out, yeah, my, myself and my partner Tronster, we, uh, we formed what is

456
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:36,580
now Mac Fest independent, uh, video game showcase, I think M I V S I think that's what it stands

457
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,580
for.

458
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,580
But yeah, yeah.

459
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,580
We've done it for a few years now.

460
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:44,660
And, uh, and now there's talk for something more here, but you know, I'll leave that.

461
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,300
I'll leave that for later.

462
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,540
This was literally just like yesterday, but I, it's becoming more and more apparent.

463
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,180
I have no choice, but to go to Mac Fest 2016.

464
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:59,500
You have no reason to miss Mac Fest, I swear to God, man, because Mac Fest will destroy

465
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,500
you.

466
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,540
Mac Fest is four days of madness.

467
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,780
It's just four days of nonsense.

468
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,780
They don't shut down.

469
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,780
My body is ready.

470
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,780
No, seriously.

471
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,340
Your body better be ready because it's like, it doesn't shut down.

472
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,380
Like it doesn't shut.

473
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:16,580
That's the thing about Mac Fest, unlike these other conventions where, you know, okay, we're

474
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,740
closed at six or we're closed at seven.

475
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:24,380
You know, Mac Fest does literally starts at 12 noon on a Thursday and does not end

476
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:28,880
until Sunday or Monday, three, four, five o'clock in the afternoon.

477
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,480
So you're literally, you have open access 24 hours to that four day weekend.

478
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,620
That sounds like our beloved Dragon Con, which isn't games, you know, it's a different type

479
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,620
of thing.

480
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,620
But I love that.

481
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,620
Like just 24 seven beer in hand.

482
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,620
Let's do this.

483
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,620
Good times.

484
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,620
Good times.

485
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,620
Uh, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

486
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:49,300
SSJ100Matt saying the Indie Showcase was really impressive last year.

487
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,380
He's out in that area.

488
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,100
And Breakman with a question about your game here.

489
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,780
How did you come up with the name Crumple?

490
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,780
Funny enough.

491
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:03,740
So Crumple, um, it is funny cause I was kind of debating what, yeah, when I was figuring

492
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:10,180
out a name for this game, um, cause my biggest struggle was I know what I want the character

493
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,180
to be.

494
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,080
You know, that was one challenging part.

495
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:17,680
You know, I stood the envelope up and as I looked at the envelope, I said that, you

496
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:22,760
know, some envelopes have windows, but there was just one, I said, what if I add another

497
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,760
one?

498
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,760
There are the eyes.

499
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:28,300
And then I'm like, now I've got an identifying character.

500
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,280
Now comes the next steps.

501
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,080
What, what can it do?

502
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,600
What will it be able to do?

503
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,240
And one of the biggest, biggest things was Crumpling.

504
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,280
Um, and funny enough, this is kind of a, no one knows this, not even you, but, um, when

505
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,080
we were in the process of when my pro, cause it's just a two man team for, for Crumple.

506
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,920
Um, when Alex, uh, big, big shout out to my man, Alex, my, he's the programmer artist,

507
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,520
the whole nine yards, the animator for all of this.

508
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,240
Um, he, uh, when we were talking, I actually kept calling it Crumble and he had to correct

509
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,240
me like a month later.

510
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,760
He's like, Gabriel, can I just tell you something?

511
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,760
I'm like, what?

512
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,760
He was like, it's Crumple.

513
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,260
It's not Crumble.

514
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,000
You're confusing your envelope with coffee cake.

515
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,680
He's like, please stop doing that.

516
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,080
And I'm like, oh, I want coffee cake.

517
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,240
But then I was embarrassed after that and I was like, holy crap.

518
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,240
Yes.

519
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,520
And when he did that, when he said that to me, I said, yes, that's what we're going to

520
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,600
call it.

521
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,240
We're going to call it Crumple.

522
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,320
So essentially the title is at the cost of my dignity.

523
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:32,400
The calling it something else entirely different, but it caught on and that, and then I said,

524
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,320
now we have to emphasize Crumple.

525
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,320
What is it?

526
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,320
How are we defining this?

527
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,480
So yeah, that's kind of where it happened.

528
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,880
I do feel like you're, you're, you're pitching ideas for a sequel though, because you can

529
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,200
have a coffee cake in Crumple 2, the Crumbling.

530
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,200
You can have that.

531
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,200
So just, just throwing that out there.

532
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,600
Hey, it's video games, man.

533
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,000
You can do whatever the hell you want, man.

534
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,040
You can do whatever the hell you want.

535
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,880
Dungeon Buster in chat over at live.vognetware.com says your body better be ready.

536
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,560
That's the bagfest byline right there.

537
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,320
Put that on the poster.

538
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,320
All right.

539
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,520
More information where we can check out nascent games and Crumple.

540
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,480
Literally you've got a website, a Twitter plug away.

541
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,480
Absolutely.

542
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,480
Yeah.

543
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,640
Funny enough, the website admittedly has been tough to keep up with because it's just me,

544
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,680
myself and I for the time being, but nascentgames.com.

545
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,900
You can see our stuff there.

546
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,920
I haven't updated it in a while, so forgive me and don't hold it against me, but I am

547
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,080
phenomenal on Twitter.

548
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,080
I am amazing on there.

549
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,960
So my Twitter handle is at nascentgames.

550
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,540
So just hit us up there.

551
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,880
And again, I mean, the good thing is at least, even though I don't update the website too,

552
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,680
too often, there's a live Twitter feed connected to the website.

553
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,220
So at least you'll see things going on actively on there.

554
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,440
So yeah.

555
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,080
And also, actually, matter of fact, if you want to see gameplay videos of both games,

556
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:51,800
we have our most recent trailer for Kinship and our most recent game, well, I shouldn't

557
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,300
most recent, our only gameplay video for Crumple on YouTube.

558
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:59,120
We have a channel on YouTube, youtube.com slash nascent games.

559
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,120
Yeah.

560
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,600
You can check stuff out there as well.

561
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
So.

562
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600
Awesome.

563
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
Great.

564
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,320
So I just wanted to check out that demo for Crumple and I will be checking that out too,

565
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,320
for sure.

566
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:14,700
I was meant to play it last week when I saw you guys at the event that you guys do every

567
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,240
Tuesday, which I'll talk more about with Brie in a minute.

568
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,280
I wanted to see that, but it's timing, I wasn't able to have the time to see it.

569
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,280
So soon, soon.

570
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,280
I brought it with me.

571
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,160
We can plug it up to the TV later.

572
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,160
We might have to do that during break.

573
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,160
We'll make that happen.

574
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,160
Might have that happen.

575
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,160
I do want to spend a little time.

576
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,680
I know we got to get to our gaming weeks and the news and everything, but I can't just...

577
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,680
Brie's been so patient.

578
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,760
Yes, no, definitely.

579
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,560
I want to talk to Brie a little bit here about what she does with the IGDA.

580
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:44,120
Now Brie, I know you're not necessarily creating games, but like, you know, as Gabriel was

581
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,320
saying before, sometimes game developers need help.

582
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,520
And I know a lot of that help, and I need it with running a podcast, is the business

583
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,520
end of things.

584
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,520
Right?

585
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,260
Yes, that's true.

586
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:58,040
So my background is in performing arts.

587
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:03,160
And I grew up loving games and it wasn't until I met with Gabriel that everything was kind

588
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:08,360
of put together for me as far as it's not just the programming, it's not just the art,

589
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,640
there's also the music component, and then the business aspect as well, especially for

590
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,720
our local developers here.

591
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,240
Many of them are startup companies or getting ready to become a startup company.

592
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,760
And we, as part of the IGDA, we want to help encourage them to build a strong foundation

593
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,460
because we want them to be long lasting.

594
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,520
That's very important.

595
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:33,240
And especially with Gabriel kind of leading the charge with that, as well as a few of

596
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,400
the other established studios here, we're all kind of growing together.

597
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:43,180
And so yeah, my whole role in this wonderful world of game development here in Sacramento

598
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,720
is I'm kind of the storyteller.

599
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,240
I like to be the voice for our chapter and for our developers.

600
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,280
Again, we are in Sacramento, California.

601
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,280
We're a lot different than the Bay Area.

602
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,160
But we're the capital of California, and there was no presence here at all.

603
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,640
So now we have the attention of the United Kingdom.

604
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,600
We have IGDA Australia that's a little jealous of our networking and mingle events.

605
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:14,400
Yeah, you know, before I really knew you guys, I would try to explain like game development

606
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,760
in Sacramento, and I'd be like, well, there's that building downtown.

607
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
It's BioWare.

608
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,120
Oh, wait, no, no, no, it's EA.

609
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,400
Wait, no, no, no, you know, but that's all, you know, I could really think about.

610
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:29,940
But there's tons that I'm not, I haven't been seeing until you guys have been getting bigger.

611
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,940
There are.

612
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:35,440
So when I was speaking with Gabriel yesterday during our last progressive game jam, you

613
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,880
know, we've had people come through and we kind of made sense where we have all these

614
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,960
different components.

615
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:46,400
We have the established studios, the AAA studios, and then our scene, the indie scene.

616
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:51,040
And now as IGDA, I think we're all just trying to put that together so that we all start

617
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,960
working together to help grow together.

618
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,960
It's all about togetherness.

619
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,960
That's great.

620
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,960
That's great.

621
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,960
Tell me a little bit.

622
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,480
Here on the show a couple weeks ago, I focused a lot on PAX East because I was out at Penny

623
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,080
Arcade Expo in Boston, so I talked a little bit about my experiences there.

624
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,200
But meanwhile, at the same time, GDC was going on.

625
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,340
So when you're talking about togetherness, my mind goes, well, that's the time when they're

626
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,160
all together is GDC.

627
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,640
Tell me a little bit about your experiences at GDC this year.

628
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:22,640
So at the top of the show, I said, haha, I'm so glad to be here because I'm a casual gamer.

629
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,560
I hope your chat room is blowing up right now.

630
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:31,640
Because once you guys start getting into details, it's not that like it goes over my head.

631
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,880
I'm just not there yet.

632
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,120
I am in my Renaissance.

633
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,920
So GDC for me was mind blowing.

634
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:41,800
I mean, you're hearing it here first.

635
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,240
I get so anxious playing games in front of other people.

636
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:51,440
So to be at a conference with 24,000 developers from around the world freaked me out.

637
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,840
But I loved it because the workshops were incredible, very informative.

638
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,320
They had a whole retro section.

639
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,200
I kind of, you know, I had my business workshops that I went to, but then I just kind of walked

640
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,200
around and played games.

641
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:10,280
And I thought that was the coolest thing because none of my other boring conferences had that.

642
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,480
But you will not be here to promote a Twitch channel tonight if you don't.

643
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:21,300
So I'm trying to figure out how to get myself on Twitch because I think I'd be pretty entertaining.

644
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,360
So even though you just said, I don't like to play games in front of other people, you're

645
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,880
like, but you know what, I'm just going to throw caution.

646
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,400
I know what you should play.

647
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,440
You need to play Hatoful Boyfriend on Twitch.

648
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,440
That would be hilarious.

649
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,440
I'm unaware of this.

650
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,440
It's a pigeon dating simulator.

651
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:41,880
Oh, but it's got like a, once you've dated all the pigeons, then it has like this really

652
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,660
like morbid, whole full storyline.

653
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,400
It's really wrong and hilarious.

654
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:52,140
See, there's a whole world that I have yet to explore and you guys need to help open

655
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,140
my perspective.

656
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,140
All right.

657
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,140
You got it.

658
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,140
We got your back.

659
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,140
We got your back.

660
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,140
Just don't, don't listen to them.

661
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,320
Don't listen to the games that my chatters say you should play because then you'll be

662
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,880
doing nothing but Five Nights at Freddy's, Amnesia, and scary games.

663
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,120
Mister, I haven't played Five Nights at Freddy's 2 after Jamie bought it for him.

664
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,120
Anyway.

665
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,120
I'm open.

666
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,360
All right.

667
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,360
All right.

668
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,280
Let's talk a little bit about the event we're going to be broadcasting from on April 11th.

669
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,560
What can folks look forward to seeing?

670
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:23,520
I mean, again, a very small portion of our audience is actually in Sacramento, so I have

671
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:27,000
to kind of look at the bigger picture about what everybody's going to hear nationwide.

672
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,880
But what can folks kind of look forward to coming out of this event?

673
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,960
So Gabriel, would you like to chime in?

674
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,960
Love it.

675
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,960
Love it.

676
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,960
You're adorable.

677
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:45,920
The, you know, we, the main thing is, you know, we're, we're, it's a professional developers

678
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:53,920
event where we open access to all gamers to try out these professional upcoming startup

679
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,920
indie studios.

680
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,320
And like I mentioned earlier, you know, it's, it's going to be in your face and there's

681
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:06,320
going to be, you know, at least 15 game developers, a couple, I think at least one, at least one

682
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:11,400
maybe two is, is an indie studio bringing the Oculus Rift.

683
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,600
They brought it last year and it was huge.

684
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,560
It was a huge, it was, it was a huge response.

685
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:21,280
I mean, but fortunately it was a huge response for all the teams, all the studios.

686
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,560
You know, so we're going to have more of that this year.

687
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:30,080
I think it's, there's a greater, there's a greater scale now because, and I want to say

688
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:36,280
a huge achievement, which is so Xbox language talk, but anyway, it's, you know, but it's

689
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:43,280
like, it's real stuff here because this year Kate Edwards, she's the director, the executive

690
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,020
director for all of IGDA.

691
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:52,560
She's going to be here to, as the keynote speaker for our little local chapter event.

692
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:57,520
So the president of the IGDA, the top, the top dog, she will be here, is going to be

693
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:02,580
here and we're going to, we're going to, if, if hopefully I'm 99% sure we're going to bring

694
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,240
her to you on, on VOG and you can check it out.

695
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,440
You guys are.

696
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:11,060
And that's a huge, huge step for us because that means they see what we're doing.

697
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,640
She sees it, she values it.

698
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:17,340
She saw it at GDC because we made our chapter known at GDC.

699
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,740
It wasn't just a social gathering.

700
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:25,740
I said, we're turning this into a demo night and we, that's what we did.

701
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:28,240
So we, you know, so it was great to have that.

702
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,340
So she saw that other people that we're going to have speaking, we have Jeff Louie from

703
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:38,740
Capsity, which is where we host a lot of our IGDA events and even my own startup studio

704
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:42,180
where I meet with my team and we, we work on there.

705
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,940
And you know, so Jeff Louie, you know, big, you know, founder of Capsity, he's going to

706
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,340
be there speaking as well.

707
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:51,420
We, you know, we have Deborah Mirimoto from California Capital.

708
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:57,260
She's all about minority owned women, owned businesses, startups, providing resources,

709
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:00,240
business resources, legal resources, all these things.

710
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,320
She attended one of our events and spoke for a little while, you know, so we're getting

711
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:10,380
this recognition, you know, you know, from these real, real deal people and, you know,

712
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:16,080
and then finally our, our educational advisor for the chapter, his name is Patrick Cranley.

713
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,580
He's a professor at Sac City College.

714
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:23,880
He's going to soon be running the entire game developer program for Sac City College.

715
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,460
He's going to be speaking as well and it's just a huge deal.

716
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:31,860
So we're going to have a lot of, there's going to be a lot of guidance and education, you

717
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,000
know, you know, advice.

718
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,820
So I was just going to say, we've had like kind of a running theme on VOG Network practically

719
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:41,220
this year about like, you know, yes, you can make a game, you know, and sometimes it's

720
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,180
going to, it's going to be very difficult and it can be very time consuming, but you

721
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:48,060
know, yes, you can make a game and there's a lot of people out there that may not even

722
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:52,820
know like where I want to make a game and I, I'm starting to get that technical know

723
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,820
how and just, but now what do I do with it?

724
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,820
How do I get noticed?

725
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,820
How do I get bigger?

726
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:02,700
I love how you said that you're going to let all the gamers get access to this information.

727
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:06,820
Like we can all see how the sausage is made type of thing and I, no, I think that's excellent.

728
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,820
I think that's great.

729
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:08,820
I, I'm still looking forward to that myself.

730
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,820
You said sausage.

731
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:10,820
It's what it is.

732
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:15,420
It's not a, it's not a, why y'all got to take it to a nasty place?

733
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,820
It's not a nasty thing.

734
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,820
All right.

735
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,820
Anyway.

736
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,620
And now I'm going to get all serious again.

737
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:26,780
And that's what I found at least in my promoting of the event with people around the area is

738
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:30,580
you know, I'm talking to parents who have younger kids that very passionate about their

739
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,980
video games, but you know, they don't have the experience that we do with some of the

740
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:36,780
retro games and to see where it's at now.

741
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,620
So they, their kids are like, I want to make a game.

742
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,820
I want to learn how to make game.

743
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,580
I don't know where to go.

744
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,880
Please come to our event.

745
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:48,740
Because what we found in our own chapter is we're working with gentlemen and a few ladies

746
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:53,380
that are, you know, in their late thirties that are just now getting to do what they

747
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,980
love to do.

748
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,140
And we don't want kids to wait that long.

749
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:02,380
So there's really a bigger picture going on here and we want the entire community, the

750
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:07,820
whole region to come and see, and who knows what's going to be ignited within that.

751
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,820
That is so powerful.

752
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:12,940
That really, I mean, truly just that, that really just lays it out right there that like,

753
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:17,540
you know, you don't want some kid thinking they can't do it and wait until they're, you

754
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,900
know, my age to do it.

755
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,900
Yeah.

756
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:24,020
And, and I was, I was one of those, actually what she just said.

757
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,060
I was one of those kids.

758
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,660
I wanted to start, I had game ideas and I didn't know they were game ideas.

759
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,220
I just wrote things on paper.

760
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:35,500
I was nine, 10 years old drawing out highways and, and city, crappy looking city skylines.

761
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,500
Did we all do that?

762
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,500
Yeah.

763
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,500
That was like the big thing in grade school.

764
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,700
You draw the dungeon and I'm drawing out the store, store.

765
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,420
Okay now, so you're going to have to buy a rope from the store to get over the pit or

766
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,180
you're going to get eaten by this little alligator I drew.

767
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:49,980
I will say that the one my friend Ashley and I made in ninth grade in high school turned

768
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,700
out to be a tabletop game I ran in college.

769
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,700
Nice.

770
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,380
That's awesome.

771
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,380
There you go.

772
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,380
Anything is possible, kids.

773
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,780
You see anything is possible.

774
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,980
And that's, that's just it.

775
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:05,460
I do have to say though, I hope no kids are listening to this show, that whole salty thing

776
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,460
we talked about before.

777
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,460
Yeah.

778
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,460
It's purely educational.

779
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,460
It's so sorry.

780
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,460
Not sorry.

781
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,460
Yeah.

782
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,460
The following commentary.

783
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,980
We're not responsible on VOG network and its affiliates.

784
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:20,380
But yeah, I mean, and that, and I think that's where our, our arcade event is going to stand

785
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:23,660
out from other types of events.

786
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,340
It, you know, other types of events.

787
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,340
It's just entertainment.

788
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,740
Oh, look at your famous celebrity.

789
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,740
Oh good.

790
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,940
I've seen you for the third year in a row.

791
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,320
But no, here you're going to learn.

792
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,340
You're going to have fun.

793
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,340
You're going to learn.

794
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,340
But we get to play too.

795
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,340
Yeah.

796
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,340
You're, yeah.

797
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,340
And that's it.

798
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,340
Once you play, you're going to interact.

799
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,460
And it'll be nice to actually play with an Oculus Rift for once.

800
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,460
Yeah.

801
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,460
And Bree, here you go.

802
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,340
I want to ask Bree, I want to ask Bree a little more and then I got to start to wrap things

803
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,340
up so we can move on.

804
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:51,580
I want to ask Bree a little more about the play end of this, because it's not just like

805
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,940
lectures and things and motivation, but there's, there's play as well.

806
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,980
But I do have to get some comments from her chat room.

807
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:01,980
Dark Tetsuya over at live.vognetwork.com says, sausage is good.

808
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,980
I love sausage.

809
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,980
Thank you.

810
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,980
Me too.

811
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,980
All right.

812
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,740
And Bobby Blackwell says, to be fair, we had to wait that long because we didn't have triple

813
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:13,100
A level game engines available for low cost or free when we were in college.

814
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:17,460
If Unity or UE4 existed when I was in college, I would have made games in college.

815
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,460
Precisely.

816
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,460
That's true.

817
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,940
We had what, the incredible machine and you got to make your little machines in there.

818
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,940
ZZT, right?

819
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,900
Hey, don't be knocking, click and play, okay?

820
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,900
No, no, no.

821
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,420
It was all about muds.

822
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,420
All right.

823
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:32,820
Bree, tell us a little bit quickly about the play end of things.

824
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:36,380
So it's not just this educational, but we get to play too.

825
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,380
Right.

826
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,380
Indie Arcade is going to be fun.

827
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:44,140
We've partnered with Retro Gen 916 and every Tuesday they host a throwback down the street

828
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:48,940
from us and they're going to set up a bunch of consoles, everything from the NES to the

829
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:55,660
Super NES to PlayStation, the first one, and you'll have a diverse array of games to play.

830
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,660
They have a virtual boy.

831
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,660
And that impressed me.

832
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,660
They have a virtual boy?

833
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,660
That impressed me.

834
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,660
Holy cow.

835
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,660
Yes.

836
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,740
We're going to have some Guitar Hero up.

837
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:07,180
Bill from Davis Atari Party is going to set up a mini Atari party.

838
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,180
Yes.

839
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,060
Dan was mentioning that because we go to Atari party every year.

840
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,060
My husband.

841
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,060
He's coming up.

842
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,060
Cool.

843
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,240
We're going to have a preview of that.

844
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,300
You guys are going to be there.

845
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,900
So that's a party in itself.

846
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,780
Oh, shucks.

847
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:24,520
We're going to have video game tournaments, Smash Brothers, Super Smash Brothers, Killer

848
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,220
Instinct and what was the, oh, Mario Kart 8.

849
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,720
And there's going to be documentaries and live video game music.

850
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,220
It's going to be a really great party.

851
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:37,440
So it's not all boring.

852
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,140
But the boring stuff is important.

853
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,140
Yes.

854
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,140
Yes.

855
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,660
Which means Gabriel, stop talking about boring stuff.

856
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:43,660
I got you.

857
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,660
I got you.

858
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:45,660
No, no.

859
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:46,660
I got you.

860
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,660
You guys are laughing.

861
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,660
We can hear you guys actually talk even more.

862
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,660
You can hear more of this chemistry, right?

863
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,660
You guys have your own podcast?

864
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,660
We do.

865
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,660
We actually have our next...

866
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,660
God help us.

867
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,660
Yeah.

868
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,660
Yeah.

869
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,660
We have our next show actually on Wednesday.

870
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,660
Don't sell yourselves.

871
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,660
Sort now.

872
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,660
Oh, no.

873
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:00,660
Oh, God.

874
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:01,660
Don't remind me about the podcast.

875
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,460
Oh, shit.

876
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:11,620
We have on the first Wednesday of every month, we do our own video game community type of

877
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:17,780
news discussion and talk and ranting and so on and so forth.

878
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,780
He rants.

879
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:23,060
I just tweet because he doesn't share the microphone, kind of like right now.

880
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:29,700
Oh, there's your preview, SacGamersUnite, at SacGamersUnite on Twitter.

881
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,660
Tune in for more drama on Wednesday nights, 7 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.

882
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,540
Why are you doing a three hour show?

883
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:42,900
Can I say, I love that she has to interrupt you to actually plug the actual podcast, because

884
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:47,060
you're not mentioning this is where you go to listen to it.

885
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,060
It's on purpose.

886
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,060
Oh, my God.

887
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,060
You guys are hilarious.

888
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,060
It's all scripted.

889
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,060
Stay forever.

890
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,060
You guys are great.

891
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,060
All right.

892
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,060
Okay.

893
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:58,860
So again, so just one more time, the Sac Indie Arcade event is happening April 11th.

894
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:02,840
That's 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Pacific on VOG.

895
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,240
My understanding is it might go a little later if you're there in person, but on VOG, it'll

896
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,000
be 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Pacific, and we're so excited to bring it to you guys.

897
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,600
And I'm just excited to go and meet all this talent.

898
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,880
You guys are helping to...

899
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,520
It's kind of like we're watering the lawn, and soon it's going to look like my backyard.

900
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,520
Absolutely.

901
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,520
Yeah.

902
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,520
Absolutely.

903
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,520
Absolutely.

904
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,520
And that's exactly it.

905
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,200
Just the community, because we're all in this together here, and that's why I say I'm in

906
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,200
it.

907
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,200
I'm still learning it all.

908
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:35,360
At this point, it's like, whatever I learn, I want to share with others, because we're

909
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,740
all in this together.

910
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,720
That's essentially what this event is about.

911
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,720
It's a celebration of this talent here.

912
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,720
Awesome.

913
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,720
Awesome.

914
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:50,120
And I hope folks worldwide will tune in to hear it, and not only check out some of these,

915
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:54,680
what gamers or what game makers go through and what they learn about, but also some of

916
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:58,520
these games that you might be playing yourself someday or shouldn't be playing, really.

917
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,400
You can play right now on Desura or wherever.

918
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,160
All these other different companies have their games hosted.

919
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,940
I do want to ask one more very important question, and then we'll move into our gaming weeks

920
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,600
and the news and everything.

921
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:17,480
But I always ask every guest that comes on OLR, I got to know, favorite video game of

922
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,240
all time, and defend your choice.

923
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,240
Oh, no.

924
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,240
Oh, no.

925
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:27,120
And you can only pick one, one, one, one.

926
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,120
Okay.

927
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,720
I'm going to let Brianna answer first.

928
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,680
Do you know why he's going to let me answer first?

929
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,680
Because he's going to take forever.

930
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,680
All right.

931
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,840
I like Galaga, and I'm proud to say that.

932
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,840
Okay.

933
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:42,360
I've come a long way because I was very hesitant to say that before.

934
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,360
But here I am.

935
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,360
I'm saying it.

936
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,360
Where's the Galaga hate?

937
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:46,360
Is there a Galaga hate club out there?

938
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,440
The Galaga's important.

939
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:52,440
Maybe there was no hate, but I was still very intimidated to say it.

940
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,440
I don't.

941
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,440
Galaga's awesome.

942
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,440
Yeah.

943
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,440
When she said that to me, I was like, Galaga's phenomenal.

944
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,440
What do you mean?

945
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,440
Don't ever be ashamed of that.

946
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,480
And yeah, we became real close after that as it was awesome.

947
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,640
Especially considering Galaga's a shooter, and you were talking about shooters earlier.

948
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,000
It kind of makes sense.

949
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
That was unplanned.

950
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I promise you.

951
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,960
So with me, oh my goodness.

952
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,960
There's so many.

953
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:19,200
But yes, if there's one that really, really hits home for me, and really life itself is

954
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,200
Journey.

955
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,200
Yup.

956
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,200
No, wait a minute though.

957
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,200
Wait a minute though.

958
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,200
Let me be clear.

959
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,200
Jamie's probably thinking about the 1981 game.

960
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,320
No, I'm just kidding.

961
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,760
You're not talking about Journey, the band, although that was an awesome game too.

962
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,960
I was talking about the new one that I honestly have only watched people play because it's

963
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:38,960
funny.

964
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:39,960
Yes.

965
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:44,640
Made by that game company who I had the pleasure of meeting both founders, Jenova Chen and

966
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,840
Kelly Santiago.

967
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:50,360
Kelly Santiago was a guest on our show recently, and I had the pleasure of meeting Jenova twice.

968
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,840
Yes, Journey is definitely the life-changing game for me.

969
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,400
There's so, so, so many, but Journey's it.

970
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,400
Definitely.

971
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,400
Interesting.

972
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,120
You don't hear a lot of people picking a contemporary choice when presented with that question.

973
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:08,360
Most answers I hear are either 80s arcade classics, like we got there, or Nintendo or

974
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,360
Super Nintendo.

975
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,360
If you asked me, I'd say Super Metroid.

976
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,360
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

977
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,360
See, there's just so many.

978
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,360
Yeah.

979
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,120
If you talk about the ending of Super Metroid, we can go on for it.

980
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,800
See, Rob's wrong because actually the best game ever is the Guardian Legend.

981
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,800
All right.

982
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,800
Anyway, anyway.

983
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,360
But you don't hear contemporary choices.

984
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,360
Awesome.

985
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:28,240
What was it about Journey that just made you go, this is it?

986
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,160
This is the experience I've been waiting for?

987
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:37,620
Because Journey took two characters, well, a character that had no identity, and the

988
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:43,160
entire game it was all about it finding itself and its purpose for being there and why.

989
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:52,120
And for me, it took me so long to find myself and have my identity, which I did not have

990
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,240
until I got here to Sacramento.

991
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,240
I didn't have that period.

992
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:06,500
So the timing of the game's release was impeccable because I had just started on kinship.

993
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:11,440
We actually started having an actual tiny prototype, and then I see this game, and then

994
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:19,440
I see the story of that game company, and it just, yeah.

995
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,480
It hits at the deepest core of me.

996
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,480
So yeah.

997
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,480
No, I hear you.

998
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,720
I remember my first experience with that game, and I can mention this now.

999
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,720
It's not really spoilers.

1000
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:32,280
The game's been out for years, but the big twist in that game was that you're not alone

1001
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,420
when you play Journey.

1002
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:39,880
You will be put in, I mean, it's online, and so another random person will be in your game.

1003
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:44,280
And with all the venom that's out there sometimes in the gaming world, and I know we've all

1004
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:48,480
seen the YouTubes of people that do really nasty things when they play Halo and so forth,

1005
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,200
Journey strips that out.

1006
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:56,040
You cannot verbally communicate with the other person that's there, but you can non-verbally

1007
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,880
communicate and you have other ways of making cues with that person.

1008
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:07,200
And seeing the way that people essentially invented language in a game like Journey was

1009
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,820
phenomenal.

1010
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:13,440
And I think for me, that game is definitely probably, I would agree, is in the top 10

1011
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,680
for me of all time.

1012
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:19,520
And I think the way that people, it was a game that made you invent language, or you

1013
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,720
could also choose to just abandon the person.

1014
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:28,480
And that says a lot about how people react in different situations as well.

1015
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:33,180
And I just, I remember not knowing that twist going in and playing it, and when I figured

1016
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:38,880
it out that the person that was with me was another person, was an actual person playing,

1017
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,240
I was like, mind exploded.

1018
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,240
Mind exploded.

1019
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,240
Absolutely.

1020
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,960
And it's so simple, it's so simple.

1021
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:50,320
But my god, what a powerful message.

1022
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,680
And that's just it, that's exactly it.

1023
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,840
So yeah, I would definitely say that.

1024
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,840
Amazing.

1025
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,840
Amazing stuff.

1026
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,080
All right, good answers you guys, good answers.

1027
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:02,560
And Dungeon Buster in chat, showing some love for Galaga, it's a big arcade classic.

1028
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,560
No shame.

1029
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,560
Yup.

1030
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,560
Absolutely.

1031
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:10,720
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Onge Radio at vognetwork.com,

1032
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,680
use the passphrase, smash.

1033
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,760
All right, let's get into our gaming weeks, the types of video games we've been playing

1034
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:17,760
this week.

1035
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,760
And of course I'm going to invite our guests to stay as long as they can tonight and chime

1036
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,720
in on our regular segments as well as the news.

1037
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,000
But let's quickly go over our gaming weeks, we'll try to make this a little quick tonight

1038
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
for time.

1039
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Dark Sakura.

1040
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,680
Um, I feel really sad because the game that IkumaJP sent to me and Dan, I haven't had

1041
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:38,560
a chance to play yet, because either he's been busy watching stuff or hasn't been home

1042
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,000
for us to play it together.

1043
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,440
So you have to do it together, yeah.

1044
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:46,320
It's the Kunio-kun, you know, sports game series.

1045
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:52,080
So like Super Dodgeball and all those, which is super fun.

1046
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:56,800
I did play some Final Fantasy XIV today, long enough to check out the Gold Saucer, which

1047
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,800
is...

1048
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:04,880
I still maintain that I hate Uldah, because it's worse to navigate than Orgrimmar was.

1049
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,480
And wow.

1050
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:11,360
And then, um, I, uh, what else did I do?

1051
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:15,480
Yeah, I did the first quest at the Gold Saucer, I'm kind of like, I played like a game of

1052
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,360
Triple Triad, I'm like, this is stupid.

1053
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,360
What?

1054
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,360
I love Triple Triad!

1055
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:23,080
Well, you can play Triple Triad for me.

1056
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,640
And I took Hot Wings out and tried to get him some levels.

1057
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,800
My chocobo is a red chocobo named Hot Wings.

1058
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,800
Nice.

1059
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,800
Yeah.

1060
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,400
Kentucky fayagra chocobo or whatever, that old joke.

1061
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,400
Faragga chocobo.

1062
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,400
Yeah.

1063
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,400
I bow to you in that.

1064
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,400
Oh my god.

1065
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:42,040
So, um, and I did play, um, I've been playing Dragon Age Inquisition, the DLC came out,

1066
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:47,180
so uh, been playing through Jaws of Hakkon, it's pretty okay, I'm just mad that it nixed

1067
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:52,520
all of my mods, because, and the modding community is plenty pissed too, but of course they understand.

1068
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:57,040
There's actually, a dude from BioWare went on Reddit, one of the programmers, and said,

1069
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:03,080
hey, we didn't do this on purpose, but we cannot accommodate for mods when we put out

1070
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,080
the DLC.

1071
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,080
Exactly.

1072
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,760
We have to bug check our own shit, we can't bug check yours.

1073
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:08,760
Exactly.

1074
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:09,760
I get it.

1075
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,920
Some of the differences, I was going to actually put that in on show roll, just reading from

1076
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:18,760
the forum on there, but I didn't, but he was going in saying that, yeah, Frostbite is a

1077
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:25,040
completely different creature than what they used before in Real Engine, you know, saying

1078
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:31,800
that it doesn't allow you, and let me start over, it doesn't allow for that type of maintenance

1079
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:35,680
of the mods to keep them working like it did in the previous iterations.

1080
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:41,320
So another guy on one of the mod forums, on the official BioWare forum, they actually

1081
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:48,320
got another guy in to pick up where warranty voider left off from the version of the modules,

1082
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:52,080
and they're saying that there's like, there were, you know, the code was pretty much open

1083
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:58,040
for Frostbite in the full release, but in the DLC there's like 72 lines of encrypted

1084
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:04,160
code that basically are what's preventing it from being just open source for everybody.

1085
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:10,960
So that's where they're getting into, do we break this or do we just stop the mods here

1086
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,760
or do we find another way to get it to work?

1087
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,760
Fair enough.

1088
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,980
So you've been pretty busy with the Dragon Age then.

1089
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:16,980
And writing fan fiction.

1090
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:17,980
All right.

1091
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:18,980
Fair enough.

1092
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:19,980
Fair enough.

1093
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:20,980
Loki.

1094
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:22,280
Loki, how was your gaming week?

1095
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,280
I didn't play anything.

1096
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,280
You didn't play anything?

1097
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,280
Yeah, unfortunately.

1098
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,840
But you're still working on your own game, that's...

1099
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:30,600
Yeah, I've been working on mine, and then, what else did I do?

1100
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:38,240
Oh, I also went through, because I had noticed I had some message from Indie Gala or whatever

1101
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,160
about some upcoming bundle that they had, and I was like, you know, I should really

1102
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:44,640
check these sites that I've been buying these bundles for to see if I've actually redeemed

1103
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,760
all my games on Steam, and no, I hadn't.

1104
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,240
So now up to like over 350 games.

1105
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,560
Ah, the Steam problem.

1106
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:51,560
The Steam problem.

1107
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,560
I haven't played.

1108
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,560
He's over 9000.

1109
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,560
I don't even know what they are anymore.

1110
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,560
I'm like, what is this thing that I bought?

1111
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,840
No, they had that sale this week, it was on PlayStation Network.

1112
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:00,840
I bought it.

1113
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:01,840
Was that the 10% discount?

1114
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,840
Or...

1115
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:03,840
No, it was the games under a dollar.

1116
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:04,840
Oh, the dollar!

1117
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:05,840
The games under a dollar.

1118
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:06,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1119
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:07,840
So I had to buy like, like, oh, Katamari.

1120
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:08,840
Yes.

1121
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:09,840
Toes of Metal Black.

1122
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,840
Yes.

1123
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,840
And then you played none of them.

1124
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:12,840
Right.

1125
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:16,280
Because I didn't play any of them.

1126
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:17,280
That's okay, though.

1127
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,280
So...

1128
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:22,600
But no, I spent most of my week actually trying to get some confetti launchers to work correctly

1129
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,080
in my game, and they look nice now.

1130
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,080
You have to get the perfect confetti cannon.

1131
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:30,280
I did, I did have to get the perfect confetti cannon, and so now my confetti looks nice.

1132
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,280
I love it.

1133
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,200
Let me, I'm gonna go to Gabriel next for his gaming week, because, you know, we're hearing

1134
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:39,800
from Loki that the development of games is keeping him from playing a lot of games.

1135
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,800
Are you having the same experience?

1136
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:42,800
No.

1137
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:43,800
So...

1138
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,800
No.

1139
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,800
Well, instruct Loki on how it's done.

1140
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,040
What have you been playing?

1141
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:51,560
It's just time management, and maybe losing some sleep or whatever, sacrificing time to

1142
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,000
call your family, whatever.

1143
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
It's fine.

1144
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:00,960
Yeah, I, the games for this week have been Ori and the Blind Forest, Xbox One, stunning,

1145
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:05,560
stunning, stunning, gorgeous, but painfully difficult game.

1146
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:10,480
Should not be as difficult as it is, for as gorgeous as it is, because I think it's taken

1147
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,960
away from my, some of my experiences with it so far, but it's still a gorgeous game.

1148
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,720
Resident Evil Revelations 2, I was rocking that, I've been rocking that out this week,

1149
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:23,080
the full game, been loving that so far.

1150
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:27,640
And DuckTales for the Nintendo just came in for me a couple, yesterday, so I was rocking

1151
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:28,860
that out yesterday.

1152
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:31,160
So yeah, DuckTales for the NES, yep.

1153
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:36,480
Wait, like, you said it came in for you, so somebody out there is hunting old NES games

1154
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,320
and putting some aside for you, huh?

1155
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,520
Well, yeah, and then I got a really good deal for it.

1156
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:43,160
Yeah, I'm gonna need some contact information.

1157
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:46,640
We will, yeah, the retro gen people, I have surprised them with the games that they just

1158
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,120
couldn't find, but that I did, so yeah.

1159
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:54,000
And then I think the last game that I've been messing around with, Shantae and the

1160
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,240
Pirates something something on the Wii U, because they put it on discount.

1161
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,240
So yeah.

1162
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,240
I had that on Steam.

1163
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,240
Yes!

1164
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,240
Great game.

1165
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,240
Loving the hell out of that game.

1166
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,240
So yeah, that's been mainly my games this week.

1167
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,240
Awesome.

1168
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,240
Brianna, what about you?

1169
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,440
What kind of video games have you been playing this week?

1170
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,920
Just remember, new gamer here.

1171
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:11,920
It's alright.

1172
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:17,680
So my whole week encompassed two games, one of which was the Crumple demo, because my

1173
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:24,320
laptop is so slow, and I can't, I keep dying, I keep burning, and I keep dying.

1174
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,920
Do you hear the aggressiveness in my voice?

1175
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:31,420
That is what you would see on a Twitch video, because I think it's so frustrated.

1176
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:32,640
But you're giving all that feedback.

1177
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,520
Oh, heck yes, I gave all that feedback.

1178
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:43,180
And then the second game, I started playing just Friday night, the Fast and Furious free

1179
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,920
play from Xbox One.

1180
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,360
Oh, I want to check that out.

1181
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:47,520
I don't even have an Xbox One.

1182
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:51,760
Yeah, I downloaded that today, or I meant to download, or I just beat it today.

1183
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:52,760
Is it on Xbox 360?

1184
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:53,760
Oh, yes.

1185
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,760
It is.

1186
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,520
Oh, Gabriel's telling me yes it is.

1187
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,520
Yes it is.

1188
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:58,520
There it is.

1189
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,520
Sorry, just remember, sir, if you're not on a mic, they can't hear you.

1190
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:01,520
Yeah, that's true, sorry.

1191
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,520
No, that's alright.

1192
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:05,680
I yell out random things at a whim as well, it's just that this one's permanently attached

1193
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,680
to my face.

1194
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:11,080
So how are you liking the Fast and the Furious expansion, or I guess standalone side story

1195
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,540
for Forza?

1196
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:14,360
So I really like driving games.

1197
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,360
Me too.

1198
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,360
And I love Forza.

1199
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,480
I have the Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 2, and I forgot how much I enjoy it, because

1200
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:26,280
I was playing Rise for a little bit, and I have 3% left, and then I'm done with my first

1201
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,640
game ever, like all the way through.

1202
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,720
Do you hear the excitement in my voice?

1203
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,320
I'm so proud.

1204
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:35,440
I won't tell you how long it's taken me, because that's embarrassing.

1205
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,760
I can't remember the last time I got 100% on a game, because I have what we call here

1206
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,760
at OLR, Gamer ADD.

1207
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,760
People don't finish games?

1208
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:43,760
No, oh.

1209
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:51,120
It depends on who you are, see now Dark Sakura, you know, she'll talk about the same game

1210
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:56,240
for 50 weeks on this show, but she has explored every nook and cranny of the Hinterlands like

1211
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,240
you wouldn't believe.

1212
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,400
No, I did that on purpose, because I actually wanted to fill up the whole map and see if

1213
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,400
I could break the map.

1214
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,400
That's me!

1215
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,280
I have to hit every XP board, I need to drive every single race, and then if I don't come

1216
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,600
in the top 3, I need to do that race again.

1217
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:13,320
Y'all don't want to know what I did with Mass Effect.

1218
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:20,080
I have modded my Mass Effect to where it's all high-res mods, and custom hair, and everything.

1219
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:23,080
You're not alone.

1220
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:27,120
She's trying to push beyond, the Castlevania Symphony of the Night has ruined her, because

1221
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:30,080
she feels she can push beyond 100% exploration in Mass Effect.

1222
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,880
No, you can't do it on the Xbox version.

1223
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,640
Oh, that's right, I heard about that.

1224
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,480
The trick doesn't work on the Xbox version.

1225
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:36,480
I heard about that.

1226
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,480
The, what was it, 211%?

1227
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,480
Yeah, 211.

1228
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,480
You can't do that.

1229
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,480
You can get 206, I think, but not 211.

1230
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:46,160
Yeah, because you can't do the wolf trick where you do the wolf turn into the gas and

1231
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,520
then the bats fly outside.

1232
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,520
For goodness sake.

1233
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,520
I know.

1234
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,520
Yeah.

1235
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,200
Okay, my gaming week, I'll talk about real quick.

1236
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:58,640
I got to play a little bit of Bloodborne today, because my friend Shane brought that over,

1237
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:02,160
and I got killed a lot, and I had no idea what the hell I was doing, because you know,

1238
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:05,240
that's one of those games that just kind of throws you in, it's like, have fun, you're

1239
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,240
gonna die.

1240
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,240
A lot.

1241
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:11,160
No, literally, it's set at, you will die in the first five minutes of the game, you have

1242
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,520
to, there's no way around it, and I was like, what the hell, I'm getting killed by the

1243
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:15,520
first mob?

1244
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,160
What kind of sadistic fuck plays this game?

1245
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,480
And I knew.

1246
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:24,080
But it was, I gotta say, it is a gorgeous game.

1247
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:29,080
As much as I was getting frustrated by, how am I supposed to play a 3D game with my old

1248
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:31,360
brain, how am I gonna play a 3D game with no map?

1249
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,720
You mean to tell me there's no map in Bloodborne, what am I supposed to do?

1250
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,680
Use visual cues and landmarks?

1251
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:37,680
What is this?

1252
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,680
So.

1253
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:39,960
Dudes don't need maps.

1254
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:40,960
This one does.

1255
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,280
I will defy that stereotype.

1256
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:48,840
I need, I would love to put Siri in the game to say, you know, go left, up ahead, and look

1257
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,520
out for the werewolf behind the rock.

1258
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:55,680
That's what I would love to have, but not gonna happen, because, you know, then they

1259
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:01,600
would be, then they would be dumbing it down for filthy casuals like me, and heaven forbid

1260
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,600
a game like Bloodborne.

1261
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,680
So are you suggesting like a Bobby Blackwolf?

1262
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,760
Yes, I need, I need Bobby.

1263
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:07,760
Best friend.

1264
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,880
Bobby Blackwolf Bloodborne.

1265
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,880
Say that four times fast.

1266
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,400
Bobby Blackwolf Bloodborne.

1267
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,400
That's what I need.

1268
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,400
All right.

1269
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,600
Anyway, so I played a little bit of that.

1270
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,600
Just a little bit.

1271
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,760
I didn't buy the game, but a friend of mine brought it over so I could check it out.

1272
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,540
But I did play a little bit of, and I gotta give a shout out to this, I don't talk about

1273
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:27,960
mobile games an awful lot on the show, but there's one that came out this week, and I,

1274
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:32,080
a lot of you that are into this series probably are aware of it, but if you're not, I'm gonna

1275
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:38,320
mention Final Fantasy Record Keeper that just came out on iOS and I believe Android.

1276
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:43,680
And the last Final Fantasy original game that they did, the ATB game or whatever that game

1277
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:44,960
was called, I hated that game.

1278
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:45,960
I was not a fan of that game.

1279
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:46,960
It was awful.

1280
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:47,960
I did not, right?

1281
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,600
It was, it was just, it was finger swipey the game.

1282
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,280
It was just clean the window of the game.

1283
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,720
Like you just swipe your finger back and forth as fast as you can.

1284
00:58:54,720 --> 00:59:00,440
The good news is Final Fantasy Record Keeper, I think is a lot more the type of Final Fantasy

1285
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,640
game we frickin' wanted out of a mobile.

1286
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:06,520
And this game is going to tickle your nostalgia bone.

1287
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:13,240
It's going to do a lot to your nostalgia bone because this game is filled with nostalgia.

1288
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:18,240
Meaning that you travel back and forth into different Final Fantasy worlds.

1289
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:22,480
And so you'll maybe play a little bit of the Final Fantasy X story, but you're not playing

1290
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,480
the game itself.

1291
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:29,640
You're just fighting monsters in classic Final Fantasy fashion and old bosses.

1292
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:34,900
But the party that you use can be made up of characters that you acquired playing Final

1293
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:38,360
Fantasy VII memories or Final Fantasy IV memories.

1294
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:42,620
So you can mix and match the party in these classic Final Fantasy fights.

1295
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:45,620
And, and here's the part that y'all wanted.

1296
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:50,740
They made Final Fantasy VII and X, and I don't know, I think XII's in there too.

1297
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:57,240
They made them all pixel sprites from the characters to the monsters and bosses, right?

1298
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,580
But you get all the classic music and all that.

1299
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:02,260
So I thought, now it is a free to play game.

1300
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:07,060
So they do have some, you know, money elements in it where you can get like better equipment

1301
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:09,900
and you can get some other things with a premium currency.

1302
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:13,860
But I was pretty impressed with what they give you for the free baseline experience.

1303
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:14,860
Oh my Lord.

1304
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:17,180
Damn me for having a Windows phone.

1305
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:18,180
That sucks.

1306
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:21,260
Oh, they'll never come out for that.

1307
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:27,060
So yeah, I gotta say, Record Keepers for a Final Fantasy mobile game is pretty cool.

1308
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:28,980
It's worth checking out for free.

1309
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:30,860
Brianna can download it at least.

1310
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,180
Let me borrow your phone.

1311
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:33,180
Yes.

1312
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:34,180
Let me borrow your phone, please.

1313
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:35,180
Love it.

1314
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:36,180
All right.

1315
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:37,180
So that was my gaming week.

1316
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:38,180
So quickly, some housekeeping here in studio.

1317
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:43,980
Of course, follow us on Twitter, please, twitter.com slash O L R. We're also on Facebook, facebook.com

All one word.

1321
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:53,780
We will get to the frugal question of the week a little later on.

1322
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:59,100
And as I'm mentioning every week until it gets here, we will be broadcasting live April

11th.

We'll be broadcasting from the Sacramento Indie Arcade event brought to you by the Sacramento

1325

IGDA, whom are here in the studio tonight.

01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:13,300
Some of the folks from that and yeah, we'll be there live from 10 AM to 5 PM and you can

1327
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:15,080
check that out on Saturday.

1328
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:18,700
And I'm hoping if for whatever reason you miss it, I don't want you to miss it, but

1329
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:22,700
if you have to miss it, cause like, you know, I don't know, WrestleMania is next Saturday

1330
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:24,580
as well, or two Saturdays now as well.

1331
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:25,580
It's today.

1332
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:26,580
It's tonight.

1333
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:27,580
That's my joke.

1334
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:28,580
That's my joke.

1335
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:34,700
Uh, we're hoping that you'll be able to later after the fact, go back and like, listen to

1336
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:35,700
it.

1337
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,620
We're going to try to archive it and all that good stuff so you can hear it, but please

1338
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:38,620
be there Saturday.

1339
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:39,620
Be there live.

1340
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:40,620
Darn it.

1341
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:43,720
Because just like we interact with you guys during the show, there may be opportunities

1342
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:47,900
where you can ask questions in chat and we'll ask who happens to be sitting with us at the

1343
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:48,900
moment, those questions.

1344
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,260
So if you're not here live, you will miss out on that.

1345
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:52,420
Will there be loot?

1346
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:53,420
Check that out.

1347
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:54,420
Will there be loot?

1348
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:55,420
Probably.

1349
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:56,420
Probably.

1350
01:01:56,420 --> 01:02:01,060
I'll talk to Bobby about that on a vognetwork.com special loot, uh, available, um, loot in person

1351
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:02,060
as well.

1352
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:05,740
Right now through vognetwork.com, you can do the whole digital loot.

1353
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:09,140
Uh, if you're a member of the site, which is free, we don't charge for that.

1354
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:10,140
That's not cool.

1355
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:15,060
So you can go there and you get, we're not going to, you can actually get like loot just

1356
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:17,780
for participating with the site and checking into shows.

1357
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:21,420
If you're listening live, you check in, you get, you know, a little something, something,

1358
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:22,420
some points.

1359
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:27,500
Uh, and then, um, uh, if you listen to the podcast, there's a word hidden somewhere in

1360
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:28,500
the podcast.

1361
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,620
You can use that on the front page.

1362
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:33,860
You can check in and get, uh, points and that often leads to loot.

1363
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:37,340
Uh, so yeah, I'm pretty sure we're going to have some type of special loot for the Sac

1364
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:38,340
IGDA event.

1365
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:41,860
I don't know why we wouldn't, uh, Bobby and I just have to work out the specifics of that

1366
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:42,860
for sure.

1367
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:46,340
But IRL loot, are there going to be, are there going to be giveaways at the event, the Sac

1368
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:47,340
Arcade event?

1369
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:48,340
We are.

1370
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:49,340
Yeah.

1371
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:50,340
Yes.

1372
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:51,340
Yes.

1373
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:55,660
We are planning that we do have a few, um, we did get a few, uh, uh, price, uh, sponsors.

1374
01:02:55,660 --> 01:03:00,340
Um, and we are still working on a few more things that I can't just say yet because if

1375
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:02,820
it doesn't happen, then I'm going to upset a lot of people.

1376
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:06,140
But if it happens, then everyone's going to love us even more than they do now.

1377
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:10,260
But yes, we are going to have some giveaways, um, that we're aiming for.

1378
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:15,420
And uh, yeah, that's, I mean, I know, I know for sure there may be a couple, there may

1379
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:20,740
be for the tournaments, uh, amiibo, uh, yeah, Nintendo amiibo stuff, um, a couple, there's,

1380
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:26,620
I think, um, we have, uh, did we receive codes for, um, uh, construct, I think so.

1381
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:27,620
Yeah.

1382
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:31,980
So, uh, construct was the game, the games of development software, uh, very popular,

1383
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:32,980
very popular.

1384
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:36,660
So yeah, so there, so we're going to have those as well, but there's still more stuff

1385
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:37,660
incoming.

1386
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:38,660
So we're good.

1387
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:39,660
It's going to be last late minute stuff.

1388
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:40,660
I already know it.

1389
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:41,660
It's very cool.

1390
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:42,660
You know what?

1391
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:44,660
Sometimes the best ideas happen that way.

1392
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:45,900
All right.

1393
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:46,900
Uh, there you go with housekeeping.

1394
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:51,380
Let's get into some news and talk about what is going on in the universe of video gaming

1395
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:52,540
this week.

1396
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:53,540
There's been quite a bit, right?

1397
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:54,540
Logie?

1398
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:58,420
Color me not surprised, but, um, they made the announcement that Zelda isn't going to

1399
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:00,820
make it for 2015.

1400
01:04:00,820 --> 01:04:04,220
I know I'm totally shocked that they delayed the game.

1401
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:06,380
I'm relieved as a game developer.

1402
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:10,980
My schedule was around, it was going to be around that between that and star Fox.

1403
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:11,980
Forget it.

1404
01:04:11,980 --> 01:04:13,580
I'm glad because like, good.

1405
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:19,220
Now you've given us a reprieve technically, but anyway, I digress basically just reiterating

1406
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:23,620
that, um, they're not making it a priority to release it in 2015 and so they're making

1407
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:28,380
it a priority to have a quality game, which I don't think anyone's going to argue against

1408
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:29,380
that.

1409
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:33,200
Um, and then also going on to further say that, you know, at E3 this year, they're going

1410
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:35,900
to be showing off games for 2015 only.

1411
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:39,820
Well, it's supposedly, we'll see.

1412
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:42,620
Well, I am all for Zelda getting delayed.

1413
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:46,060
If that's what they have to do to make the game they want to do, then yes, delay it.

1414
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:48,140
And we all know you've, you've seen it all around Twitter.

1415
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:53,140
The Miyamoto quote about, you know, a bad game is going to be a bad game forever, but

1416
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:54,780
a good game, you know, is always going to be a good game.

1417
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:55,780
I'm totally paraphrasing.

1418
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:59,020
I don't have the exact quote in front of me, but you know, delay it and make a good game

1419
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,180
that people will remember.

1420
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:01,540
That's fine.

1421
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:06,520
But the reality is, and as much of a Nintendo fan boys, you might be, you have to realize

1422
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:10,120
that was a huge tent pole for Nintendo's 2015 holiday.

1423
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:13,440
That was something that was sold me a Wii U.

1424
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,960
Now I'm not buying a Wii U until that comes out.

1425
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:16,960
Right.

1426
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:18,720
So what's going to fill in that gap now?

1427
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,160
And that I imagine is what we'll hear about at E3.

1428
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:22,160
Star Fox.

1429
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,280
I mean, you think maybe they'll bump Star Fox?

1430
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:26,360
I thought Star Fox was supposed to be a little sooner than that.

1431
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,360
Interesting.

1432
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:31,820
It was supposed to be a few months before, um, Zelda, but yeah, I mean, but again, I'm

1433
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:33,000
completely okay with it.

1434
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,480
I mean, I, I mean, I foresee definitely Star Fox, but I think they're going to be fine.

1435
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,800
They're going to come up with another surprise.

1436
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:38,800
I just don't know.

1437
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:42,880
I, I, my gut tells me it's going to be a mainline Mario game.

1438
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,240
And I don't know if that means they're going to try to crank out like a 3d land to real

1439
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,240
quick.

1440
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:52,560
I fingers and toes crossed galaxy three, I think is what a lot of us would like to see.

1441
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:53,560
Yeah.

1442
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:58,760
That's or even, and I'm even willing to go far enough and say, if they want to do a new

1443
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:04,720
Mario series, you know, cause the game cube had sunshine, the, we had galaxy, if they

1444
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:07,320
were to do a brand new Mario, I think that's fine too.

1445
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:08,720
There is Mario maker.

1446
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,480
That's supposed to be coming this year as well.

1447
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:11,480
There's systems.

1448
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:12,480
Yeah.

1449
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,320
I kind of, I kind of put that as a, I mean, that's, I, I'm like that I want to pick that

1450
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:17,320
up.

1451
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:20,240
I want to buy that, but that's, that's kind of like a more like the kind of something

1452
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,360
that should be out long before holiday.

1453
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:23,360
You know?

1454
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,360
Yeah, that's true.

1455
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:25,360
That's true.

1456
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:29,000
So I'm very curious to see, Hey, I'll take an F zero remaster for the Wii U.

1457
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Thank you.

1458
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Nintendo.

1459
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,400
Amen to that.

1460
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,400
Amen.

1461
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:37,000
A remaster like Pikmin two or something dumb like that.

1462
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I don't know.

1463
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
We'll see.

1464
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,640
It's what you wanted.

1465
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:41,640
You get Pikmin two.

1466
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:42,640
No, no.

1467
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:43,640
Well, we'll see.

1468
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:44,640
We'll see what happens there.

1469
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:50,240
Uh, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com dark Tetsuya says, I remember watching the

1470
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,240
video.

1471
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:54,720
I could just sense that they would announce a delay to 2016, but I agree with Miyamoto's

1472
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,380
philosophy on delayed games.

1473
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:00,640
Tiger claw says you think they would make a new super Mario brothers three.

1474
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,480
I would like to see another in that series.

1475
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:06,640
See, I kind of think that's the gap that Mario maker fills.

1476
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:10,280
I think something, you know, you know, cause Mario is a huge universe.

1477
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,280
Obviously.

1478
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:15,000
I think something in the 3d Mario space would be great, but we'll, we'll see.

1479
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,960
Well, Mario 3d world was spectacular.

1480
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:22,840
It definitely falls into prob, probably my top 10 of all time for sure.

1481
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:29,160
Because, because that, because I mean, not since Mario world and Mario 64 has a Mario

1482
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,160
game blown me away.

1483
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,920
Like, like, yeah, I love galaxy.

1484
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:32,920
They'll give me one.

1485
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:36,040
I can, I just have to say, I can tell you're from Jersey cause you say Mario and I don't

1486
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:38,480
hear that outside of east coast.

1487
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:44,680
I apologize to the English language for my vowel misrepresentation, but yeah, I mean,

1488
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:48,200
but yeah, Mario sunshine galaxy, not to discredit those games.

1489
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:55,360
Those games were beautiful, wonderful games, but Marrow 3d world literally brought back

1490
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:58,800
what was missing completely from a Mario game.

1491
01:07:58,800 --> 01:07:59,800
Not then.

1492
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:00,800
So yeah.

1493
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:03,800
You know, so I can see that I can definitely see it, but if they're going to do a new super

1494
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:09,600
Mario brothers game, they need to really change it up because that Wii U one, yeah, it was

1495
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:12,960
pretty, but it was really just a remake of the Wii version.

1496
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,600
So again, I think Mario maker is going to fill that gap.

1497
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:19,280
I don't think we need to have two of those in a year, but I mean, I, I wouldn't complain.

1498
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,040
I'm not going to talk bad about it.

1499
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:26,000
Does that mean we'll get a third Mario amiibo that everyone's going to like cream themselves

1500
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,000
over?

1501
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,760
I mean, seriously, be careful what you wish for.

1502
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:30,840
Well, technically there are three already.

1503
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:31,840
Don't forget.

1504
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:32,840
There's the gold one.

1505
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:35,680
Oh, well that's totally different than the other one.

1506
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:40,680
I mean, they didn't just slap paint on it or here's, here's what hasn't happened yet.

1507
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:46,120
And you know, it's going to happen is good use for those amiibos pipe down salty man.

1508
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:49,680
I'm talking about pixelated amiibo.

1509
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:52,740
There's pixel Mario and pixel Luigi.

1510
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:54,240
You know that it'll happen.

1511
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:55,240
Oh, no.

1512
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,800
It, you know, it shake your head all you want.

1513
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:57,800
You know, it's coming.

1514
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:58,800
Bring it.

1515
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:03,920
They're going to, if they're, they're taking a page out of the Activision playbook, milk

1516
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,440
that shit till it's dry.

1517
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:08,120
All right.

1518
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:14,600
I'm moving on some other information coming out of Nintendo and that is a splatoon splatoon.

1519
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:15,600
Let's not forget.

1520
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,960
That's a game that's coming out before the holiday over the summer.

1521
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:22,920
I think if some of the Facebook posts are to be listened to, but they're talking about

1522
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:28,400
that splatoon is going to do for action shooters, what Mario Kart did for racing.

1523
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:32,480
At least that's what Reggie Fils-Aime said, saying, quote, it's aiming to do for action

1524
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:35,440
shooters, what Mario Kart did for racing.

1525
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:38,360
Also saying it's a major new IP for Nintendo.

1526
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:40,360
The game is not just about kills.

1527
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:43,600
It's supposed to be fun no matter what your skill level is.

1528
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,480
So we'll see more about, you know, the fun factor when the game is released.

1529
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:53,720
That's going to be a fun game period because I've seen so many videos of that and yeah.

1530
01:09:53,720 --> 01:10:00,080
It's very refreshing to see Nintendo finally bring us something new, new, new.

1531
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,040
It just looks insanely fun though.

1532
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:07,240
I kind of love the idea of, you know, Nintendo kind of realized, oh yeah, like shit loads

1533
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:10,120
of people are playing Halo and Destiny.

1534
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:12,920
How can, how can we kind of put our own spin on that?

1535
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:15,200
And I think that's what you're seeing with this.

1536
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:19,320
And I think more importantly with something like Splatoon, I think we talked about on

1537
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:24,440
a previous episode, Splatoon is being developed by like a younger team, you know, a greener

1538
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:26,240
team at Nintendo.

1539
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:30,280
And so this is really a chance for them to say, you know, we're going to do our own thing

1540
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:31,280
and here it is.

1541
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,840
And I think wasn't it the same team that did Animal Crossing, which ended up being huge?

1542
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:38,520
I want, I want to say, I want to say yes, but yeah, I'm not sure.

1543
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:42,440
So anyway, I'm just excited to see, you know, what they put together, fourth quarter game

1544
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:43,440
right there.

1545
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,600
You know, Splatoon is supposed to be out sooner than that.

1546
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:47,040
No, no, no, no, no.

1547
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,600
Animal Crossing.

1548
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:49,800
I fucking hope so.

1549
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:50,800
I'm sorry.

1550
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:55,400
I know some of y'all are over it, but if they, especially if they can kind of do something

1551
01:10:55,400 --> 01:11:00,200
new with it, like that's my one wish for Animal Crossing is I really need to see them do something

1552
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:01,200
new.

1553
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:03,200
I want Isabelle the rampage.

1554
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:06,080
You want to see a Splatoon crossover.

1555
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,540
I want Isabelle to go postal.

1556
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:12,120
So you want Isabelle as a character in Splatoon, except her paint gun is replaced with an actual

1557
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:13,120
gun.

1558
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:22,600
As long as Tom Nook does not get her revenge through public works.

1559
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,360
She'll just build a bench on you.

1560
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:28,800
One thing that might be a bummer for some people is that Splatoon will not have voice

1561
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:29,800
chat.

1562
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:32,720
It has been confirmed and you know, rumors are going around about this, but it was confirmed

1563
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:33,720
this week.

1564
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,480
Splatoon will not have voice chat.

1565
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:39,680
So you cannot communicate with your teammates online unless, I don't know, you do a Skype

1566
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:40,680
thing.

1567
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:43,520
I know a lot of people that when they play the Nintendo stuff, they just have Skype on

1568
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:47,880
their mobile phone and so I don't know, but for whatever reason they've decided not to

1569
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:48,880
implement that.

1570
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:53,640
It's too bad they couldn't tie like voice chat to, I don't know, some sort of parental

1571
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,640
settings or something that are on the console.

1572
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:57,360
I mean, they have that, right?

1573
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:58,360
They can do that.

1574
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:00,080
That would be very forward thinking.

1575
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:05,080
Yeah, it's not, it's not heavily utilized and I, and I honestly, I don't blame Nintendo

1576
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:09,080
for the voice chat thing because let's face it, look at what happened with Microsoft when

1577
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:12,620
they, when they created the party chat idea.

1578
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:16,160
Everyone went bonkers over, oh my God, we could chat with our own people and not have

1579
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:18,000
to worry about talking with others.

1580
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,800
But unfortunately that's exactly what happened.

1581
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:25,720
And now no one hears anybody at all anymore when they play multiplayer because they're

1582
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:26,720
in a party.

1583
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:27,720
They're in a party chat.

1584
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:30,360
That actually raises a good point.

1585
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:34,040
Like when I played Destiny, when I played Destiny, it was all about party chat.

1586
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:37,320
You didn't, I mean, I think that's part of why they didn't even put voice chat.

1587
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:41,720
And remember voice chat isn't in Destiny if you randomly connect with people.

1588
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:45,840
And I think that was probably half the whole, you know, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck

1589
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,560
you factor for some people.

1590
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:48,560
Right.

1591
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:53,520
And much more colorful language coming out of those mouths and half the factor of people

1592
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,440
are playing in party mode anyway.

1593
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,440
Yup.

1594
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:57,440
That's true.

1595
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:01,040
And I, and I, and with this being on Nintendo, yeah, the last thing you need is a, is a 10

1596
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,040
year old on Nintendo.

1597
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:07,160
You hear it on Halo, Call of Duty, that's fine, but you don't hear parents getting all

1598
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:08,200
upset about it.

1599
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,520
But if they hear it on a Nintendo game, it'll be on the phone.

1600
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:11,520
It'll be on the nightly news.

1601
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:15,000
It'll be on Fox 40 tonight.

1602
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,160
Little kid hears fuck while playing Splatoon, film at 11.

1603
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,160
First time ever.

1604
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:20,160
Who cares?

1605
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:25,160
That, that's why, why bother paying attention to your news channel if that's the kind of

1606
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:26,160
news that they're reporting.

1607
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:30,640
I mean, it's like, Bob took a shit today, you know, news at six.

1608
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:31,640
It's like, who gives a fuck?

1609
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:34,600
Did he flush find out tonight at seven?

1610
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,640
People do this stuff all the time.

1611
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,400
It's like, I don't understand why any of this is news.

1612
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:40,400
It's America.

1613
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,140
That's why people watch it.

1614
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:43,140
That's America.

1615
01:13:43,140 --> 01:13:45,760
That's why Jamie just has this look of disgust.

1616
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:50,200
It was, no, it wasn't that it was just a line from Arthur popped in my head.

1617
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,520
I think I'll take a bath.

1618
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:55,480
I'll alert the media.

1619
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:57,440
You all remember that movie, right?

1620
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:58,440
You went there.

1621
01:13:58,440 --> 01:13:59,440
Talk about old school.

1622
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:00,440
Talk about old school.

1623
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,440
All right.

1624
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:02,520
My mom's favorite movie next to Fiddler on the Roof.

1625
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:06,920
Uh, I was going to say, I was going to say, she's surprised her daughter's a Jew now.

1626
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:07,920
Okay.

1627
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:10,320
I was going to say, aren't they going to remake Arthur?

1628
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,560
And then I remembered they did remake Arthur.

1629
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,280
It's just, it was awful.

1630
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:15,280
Anyway.

1631
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:16,280
All right.

1632
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:17,280
Yeah.

1633
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:18,280
Moving on.

1634
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:19,280
Speaking of watching movies, dark soccer.

1635
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:26,360
Well, I do have something for fans of, of the walking dead, I guess.

1636
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:29,740
Um, and who have PlayStations.

1637
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:35,580
If you are a PlayStation view subscriber, you get AMC, which didn't they play all the

1638
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:38,460
black and white movies and then they decided that they were going to be relevant?

1639
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:39,460
Yup.

1640
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:40,460
Yes they did.

1641
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:41,460
Yeah, they did actually.

1642
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:42,980
This is supposed to be American movie classics.

1643
01:14:42,980 --> 01:14:47,140
This is where I used to watch Orson Welles presenting War of the Worlds.

1644
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:51,940
Actually what happened, Jamie, we got older and then suddenly movies like Pretty Woman

1645
01:14:51,940 --> 01:14:56,180
are a classic and it's like, shit, when did I get old?

1646
01:14:56,180 --> 01:15:00,620
Or like, you know, you listen to classic rock and it's like that song by Aerosmith

1647
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:02,380
that everybody's sung in high school.

1648
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:04,780
Living on the edge, you can't.

1649
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:05,780
It's like, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1650
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:06,860
This is classic rock now.

1651
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:07,860
Hold up, hold up.

1652
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:08,860
I ain't that old.

1653
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:09,860
Oops.

1654
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:10,860
Yes I am.

1655
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:11,860
Yes we are.

1656
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:15,540
I wanted to cry when I was in Alabama listening to one of the classic rock stations and they

1657
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:18,540
played gorillas.

1658
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:24,260
I wanted, I wanted to find a possum cause it's the south.

1659
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:28,220
I wanted to find a possum and kick it.

1660
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:31,740
Take this possum, that's for gorillas.

1661
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:37,020
So anyway, they've got different access packages that are going to come up.

1662
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:44,500
It also includes IFC, Sundance, WeTV, and it's, right now it's only available in New

1663
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:47,060
York, Philadelphia, and Chicago.

1664
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:50,740
So you get the three ones, which is Access Core and Elite.

1665
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:55,340
Access has 50 different channels, I'm not naming them all, except they have food networks.

1666
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:56,340
That's pretty awesome.

1667
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:58,340
For 50 bucks a month and then you get access.

1668
01:15:58,340 --> 01:15:59,980
You can never watch enough Chopped.

1669
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:01,980
You can never watch enough Chopped.

1670
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:02,980
Okay.

1671
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:05,140
Do you want to know what my porn crack is?

1672
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:06,140
What?

1673
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:09,340
Watching a cooking show while eating.

1674
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:13,820
That's kind of like me, except I like to watch NBC's The Biggest Loser while eating Ben and

1675
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:16,660
Jerry's and then I cry and I don't know why.

1676
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:19,860
I can't watch that show because I found out what they do to those poor people.

1677
01:16:19,860 --> 01:16:20,860
It's pretty bad.

1678
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:21,860
I can't support that show.

1679
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:22,860
I choose to be ignorant.

1680
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:24,860
Do they turn them into meat at the end?

1681
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:26,860
No, that's not how the sausage is made.

1682
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:27,860
Okay.

1683
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:33,220
Anyway, the last package is going to be like 70 bucks a month and there's actually a thing

1684
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:38,260
about it on Wired if people want to find out the plus and minuses, but AMC will be involved

1685
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:39,460
in all of the channels.

1686
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:42,820
PlayStation Vue is on PS3 and PS4.

1687
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:43,820
You know what?

1688
01:16:43,820 --> 01:16:44,820
I've never watched Walking Dead.

1689
01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:45,820
I have a story about Walking Dead.

1690
01:16:45,820 --> 01:16:49,220
Could that be because Walking Dead is on Sunday nights and we kind of do something else on

1691
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:50,220
Sunday nights?

1692
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:51,220
I have a story about that though.

1693
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:52,220
What?

1694
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:53,220
About my mother.

1695
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:54,220
Okay.

1696
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:56,500
I'm going to do my mom voice.

1697
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:59,340
You know, I thought that Walking Dead show was going to be kind of stupid, so I said

1698
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:00,980
I wasn't going to watch it.

1699
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:05,780
And then I was watching something with Michael, her husband, and I was like, hey, this is

1700
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:06,780
pretty good.

1701
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:07,780
What is it?

1702
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:08,780
He's like, Walking Dead.

1703
01:17:08,780 --> 01:17:12,180
Well, shit.

1704
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:14,740
And that's my story that my mom told me while I was in Alabama.

1705
01:17:14,740 --> 01:17:15,740
Bravo.

1706
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:16,740
Here's my thing though.

1707
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:17,740
AMC kind of needs a new show.

1708
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:22,420
Look, I'm not trying to insult the Walking Dead fans out there, but how much time does

1709
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:23,420
your show have left?

1710
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:26,260
Because pretty soon everybody's going to be dead.

1711
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:27,660
But they're still going to be walking.

1712
01:17:27,660 --> 01:17:32,260
No, it's just going to be What's His Face.

1713
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:34,060
Looking all angry and rednecky.

1714
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:35,060
Awesome.

1715
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:38,060
With a gun, sitting on top of a pile of zombies.

1716
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:39,060
Go ahead.

1717
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:40,060
Bring it.

1718
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:43,500
No, because now you'll be able to play him in Silent Hills, assuming that is still happening.

1719
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,500
And I want E3 to clarify.

1720
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:45,500
Silent Hills.

1721
01:17:46,260 --> 01:17:50,260
I need Konami to clarify some things, please.

1722
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:51,260
All right.

1723
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:53,260
Anyway, it'll be on the gambling machine.

1724
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:54,260
Sorry.

1725
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:56,700
I don't think I talked about that yet.

1726
01:17:56,700 --> 01:17:57,700
I talked about it on Bobby's show.

1727
01:17:57,700 --> 01:17:58,700
I talked about it here.

1728
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:02,020
I was in Reno over the weekend, just on an impromptu trip.

1729
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:03,020
Trip.

1730
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:04,020
Trick.

1731
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:05,020
Oh, shit.

1732
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:06,020
Uh oh.

1733
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:07,020
No.

1734
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:08,020
Trip.

1735
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:09,020
That's how he got his gambling money.

1736
01:18:09,020 --> 01:18:12,020
Guess who's paid for dinner tonight, y'all?

1737
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:13,020
Anyway.

1738
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:14,020
Wow.

1739
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:21,380
So I went up there on an impromptu trip, and I was playing some nerdy machines, because

1740
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:25,740
I saw a Jenga machine, and I was like, that reminds me of Gamer X. I'm playing Jenga.

1741
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:30,900
But then I saw a Dungeons & Dragons slot machine, and I was like, oh my god, they're coming

1742
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:31,900
after nerds.

1743
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:32,900
They're trying to get nerds to get old people.

1744
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:33,900
Oh my god.

1745
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:34,900
Old people don't know what this is.

1746
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:35,900
Yeah.

1747
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:36,900
They're gonna think it's the devil.

1748
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:38,740
Except here's the problem, Loki.

1749
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:42,620
Dungeons & Dragons was in the 70s, and so there's a lot of people who you would call

1750
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:47,340
quote unquote old people that were our age when Dungeons & Dragons came out, so...

1751
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:48,340
Mm-hmm.

1752
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:49,860
I'm talking about really old people.

1753
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:54,540
I'm talking about people that would have been, you know, playing Dungeons & Dragons.

1754
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:55,540
People older than that.

1755
01:18:55,540 --> 01:18:56,540
Oh, okay.

1756
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:58,500
Like people that voted for the governor of Indiana.

1757
01:18:58,500 --> 01:18:59,500
Like that type of thing.

1758
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,500
Oh boy.

1759
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:02,900
Gotta throw a little shade while I can.

1760
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:03,900
All right, anyway.

1761
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:07,740
I didn't say misinformed, I said older.

1762
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:08,740
Buzzing.

1763
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:15,700
All right, anyway, so the Dungeons & Dragons machine made by Konami, I didn't even notice

1764
01:19:15,700 --> 01:19:16,700
that.

1765
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:20,300
I tweeted about it, and somebody replied to my tweet saying, Konami frown.

1766
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:22,940
And I was like, oh my god, it is a Konami game.

1767
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:28,340
So this is, they've let Kojima go to make Dungeons & Dragons slot machines.

1768
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:29,340
Yep.

1769
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:30,340
I guess there's money to be made there.

1770
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:31,340
All right, anyway.

1771
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:32,340
I digress.

1772
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:33,540
Loki, what else is in the news tonight?

1773
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:36,340
I've gone from walking dead to gambling.

1774
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:41,020
So hey look, Twitch had a security breach, and passwords and stuff came out, so they

1775
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:45,260
reset your password, and is anyone shocked by this?

1776
01:19:45,260 --> 01:19:48,340
Major website has a security breach.

1777
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:50,540
Loki, it's the internet.

1778
01:19:50,540 --> 01:19:55,420
Things I put in the internet should be safe, because it's interneted.

1779
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:58,500
Yes, that's correct.

1780
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:00,700
That's how the internet works.

1781
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:05,620
The good thing though is they basically said, hey, you know what, well I don't know if it's

1782
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:06,900
good.

1783
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:13,260
Their quote was, there may have been a little bit of an unauthorized access to some of your

1784
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:17,260
Twitch user account information, including the possibility of your Twitch username, associated

1785
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:21,740
email address, your password, the last IP you logged in from, maybe some limited credit

1786
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:28,820
card information, card type, card number expiration, and some of the following, first, last name,

1787
01:20:28,820 --> 01:20:32,580
phone number, address, date of birth, if you put that stuff in there.

1788
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:37,700
But hey, it's a good thing we don't store the full credit card number.

1789
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:42,820
But your passwords were protected.

1790
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:47,420
In the cloud probably, because Amazon owns it now, so it's in their cloud technology.

1791
01:20:47,420 --> 01:20:51,020
That's a good point.

1792
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:55,340
But your credit card number's all safe in the cloud, everything's in the cloud.

1793
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:57,780
Nobody bad will get in the cloud.

1794
01:20:57,780 --> 01:21:01,220
But they reset it, so you have to go do that.

1795
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:06,020
My thing is, I forget what my Twitch name is on there anyways, because I use it so frequently.

1796
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:13,780
Well, I'm Rob Roberts on Twitch, that's easy enough to find, but I was going to say, yeah,

1797
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:19,220
they made you reset your password, so there's that whole thing, but this is just your weekly

1798
01:21:19,220 --> 01:21:22,340
reminder at this point, because it seems like we have one of these stories every week these

1799
01:21:22,340 --> 01:21:26,920
days, but this is your weekly reminder, use different passwords on different websites.

1800
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:34,480
Use an app like what was 1Password or some of those, if that helps you out at all.

1801
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:37,520
And two-step authentication would be nice.

1802
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,200
Two-step authentication, always smart.

1803
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:40,760
Which I don't think they have.

1804
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:42,480
No, I don't think they do.

1805
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:46,360
Not yet, but maybe that'll come soon, who knows, so you might need it.

1806
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:53,240
All right, well, moving on, talking a little something different here about region locking.

1807
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:57,640
We talk a lot about region locking on OLR, and basically it all boils down to, why do

1808
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:59,120
they still do this shit?

1809
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:03,720
It is on the internet, I can download it from anywhere, I want people from Finland to download

1810
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:05,600
my demo.

1811
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,480
Is there a reason to region lock Crumple?

1812
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:10,480
Hey, bro, is there a reason you might want to region lock that?

1813
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:11,480
No.

1814
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:12,480
Yeah.

1815
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:17,520
It's not like there's any text or anything like that other than the title, where it's

1816
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:18,680
like, what is it saying?

1817
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:20,200
I don't know what it's saying.

1818
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:26,880
Or complex and antiquated rights, music, laws that would maybe prevent that.

1819
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:27,880
You don't have any of that.

1820
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:29,720
I wrote the music for it.

1821
01:22:29,720 --> 01:22:32,560
Let it go around the world, I beg it to.

1822
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:36,960
That someone's not going to copyright strike that for some reason.

1823
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:41,480
My thought, though, is that they do have a lot of different, especially when you get

1824
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:46,840
on a console or something, where you have to submit your game to these different organizations

1825
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:48,280
that do the ratings and stuff like that.

1826
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:50,000
It costs money to do that.

1827
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,800
I don't know how that works as far as if we just made it region-free, because obviously

1828
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:59,120
it's worked for Sony for the last few generations.

1829
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:06,020
Well, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PSP, and Vita.

1830
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:09,800
So they haven't really had any problems there, so I don't know how to get around it.

1831
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:11,720
This could be something that could affect Nacho.

1832
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:15,240
We're talking about games, but it goes even beyond that.

1833
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:17,800
And this could be very interesting if this pans out.

1834
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:22,700
The European Commission, apparently, this week said they want to remove regional limits

1835
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,400
on digital goods.

1836
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:29,240
And one of the things they're looking at that's specifically cited is watching US Netflix

1837
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:34,540
from the United Kingdom, because you know a lot of other countries want the US Netflix

1838
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:36,800
because we have more stuff.

1839
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,640
Granted, I want to say sometimes, though, it's the other way around, too.

1840
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,000
They have things we don't have.

1841
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:46,480
Some of the BBC shows, I know, though, the BBC website used to have a lot of their content

1842
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,480
region-locked.

1843
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:53,120
And they unlocked all of it, so for TV shows that are on, you know, TV over there.

1844
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,120
Yeah.

1845
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:58,480
It's just sad that it takes Europeans, once again, not Americans, Europeans, it takes

1846
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,080
them to start this.

1847
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:02,200
I don't care where it starts, as long as it...

1848
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:04,200
But it's like, we should be doing this.

1849
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:09,400
It's like, we talk all this smack about ourselves, you know, our egotistical ways, you know,

1850
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:13,720
the country's egotistical ways, and yet we, you know, hear the Europeans beating us again.

1851
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:17,440
I actually had someone I went to high school with unfriend me because I sent her the link

1852
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:19,600
about how many things we are no longer number one in.

1853
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:20,600
Oh!

1854
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:21,600
Well...

1855
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:24,920
But I have my big foam finger, this is we're number one.

1856
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:31,520
But is there such a thing as, like, Japanese television, Netflix, because I want that.

1857
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:32,520
There isn't.

1858
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:33,520
I think Korea does, though.

1859
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:34,720
I think Korea has something like that.

1860
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:37,920
I want, like, Tekashi's Castle, all the episodes.

1861
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:39,840
I just want the Jdrama channel.

1862
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:42,880
Well, anyway, it might start in Europe.

1863
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:46,680
And again, this is maybe, this is just a new strategy that's being outlined called the

1864
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:48,720
Digital Single Market.

1865
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:53,800
This will prevent companies from geo-blocking online services when it's not truly necessary.

1866
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:57,560
Now see, that's a gray term to me, and that's what's going to take a while to figure out

1867
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:59,400
what is necessary.

1868
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:03,360
But the type of arbitrary limit would not be able to exist in a single European Union-wide

1869
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,080
digital marketplace.

1870
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:11,160
So more information supposedly coming in May when the full strategy is due.

1871
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:14,920
But yeah, you would not have to, you would not get locked out.

1872
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:18,760
You could watch French Netflix while you're in Germany, whatever.

1873
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:20,320
That is all going to be the European Union.

1874
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:24,100
Now, keep in mind, because it's the European Union, that isn't necessarily going to have

1875
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:26,200
an impact on us in America.

1876
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:30,000
But again, if we start hearing about all the good shit they have over there, one thing

1877
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,920
Americans are really good at is complaining.

1878
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:37,960
So we're going to start complaining to Netflix in droves, well, I can't hear you.

1879
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:38,960
You raised my prices.

1880
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,040
There's a fly in my soup.

1881
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:42,040
You raised my prices.

1882
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:43,880
Give me European content.

1883
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:46,920
So that is one, but we are number one in complaining.

1884
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:48,960
I don't think anybody's going to dispute me there.

1885
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:49,960
Nope.

1886
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:50,960
All right.

1887
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:56,040
Anyhow, just an interesting statistic that goes along with that, that might explain why

1888
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:58,200
this is happening, by the way.

1889
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:09,200
9% of console games sold digitally in 2014, 58% of PC games sold digitally in 2014.

1890
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:16,800
Now that's Germany, and that's the second biggest video game market after the UK.

1891
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:21,800
But you've got to think, those numbers probably aren't drastically different here in the U.S.

1892
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,400
I don't imagine so.

1893
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:28,320
Especially when you see how the PC shelf space is shrinking at a place like GameStop.

1894
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,440
I wonder if it's higher here.

1895
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:36,680
And how many people, like Loki over here, with how many games on his Steam account alone.

1896
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:39,860
So I saw that yesterday when we were doing a game jam.

1897
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:45,320
One of my guys, Nicholas, he pulled up his Steam account, and I swore I saw probably

1898
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:46,320
200 plus games.

1899
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,040
I'm like, have you played all of these?

1900
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:49,040
Like, nope.

1901
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:51,520
I'm embarrassed to bring mine up.

1902
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:52,680
I would not want to show.

1903
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:53,680
I'm not going to show you.

1904
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:56,400
If you ask me, I'm going to say, no, some things are private, and you shouldn't be asked

1905
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:57,400
about it.

1906
01:26:57,400 --> 01:26:58,400
My Steam library is one of them.

1907
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:01,780
My PlayStation Network account's starting to get like that too now.

1908
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:05,120
It's getting pretty, with the crazy sales they're doing too.

1909
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:06,120
It's something else.

1910
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:10,560
Anyhow, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1911
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:16,240
Well, we haven't really given our friends in the UK, except for just now, of course.

1912
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:20,120
You know, in the past, normally the UK was sort of my big thing.

1913
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:26,800
There is a study out now about UK children and what they're doing that makes them pretty

1914
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:27,800
lazy.

1915
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:34,360
UK children are spending six hours a day in front of a screen, on average.

1916
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:40,640
And this isn't necessarily just like TV, but it includes TV, playing video games, using

1917
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:43,780
a mobile device, a personal computer, or a tablet.

1918
01:27:43,780 --> 01:27:50,960
And this was based off of a survey of 2,000 children between 5 and 16.

1919
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:54,600
It's called the Connected Kids Report.

1920
01:27:54,600 --> 01:28:01,060
So basically, it's actually, teenage girls are spending about seven and a half hours

1921
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:06,060
watching the screens, compared with 3.5 hours of TV viewing in 1995.

1922
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:12,180
And boys spend longer times, up to eight hours, in front of screens.

1923
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:16,820
So they clearly don't work in a call center.

1924
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:23,580
And then, love video games, where we spend 12 hours in front of the screen, but...

1925
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:24,580
Only?

1926
01:28:24,580 --> 01:28:25,580
Only.

1927
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:26,580
Jeez.

1928
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:27,580
No, seriously.

1929
01:28:27,580 --> 01:28:30,020
But basically, the big thing...

1930
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:33,740
One of these days, Dark Soccer, if somebody's gonna do something crazy, like create this

1931
01:28:33,740 --> 01:28:38,180
headset where you just strap the screen right in front of your space, and the screen moves

1932
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:39,180
with you everywhere you go.

1933
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:41,100
Fox News at 6.

1934
01:28:41,100 --> 01:28:45,180
VR headsets will make you blind, because the screen's in front of you.

1935
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:47,340
No, it's gonna be the game in Star Trek, The Next Generation.

1936
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:52,340
They're gonna play a clip of some old woman, or whatever, from a long time ago.

1937
01:28:52,340 --> 01:28:55,620
If you sit so close to the screen, you'll go blind!

1938
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:56,740
There's my proof right there.

1939
01:28:56,740 --> 01:28:58,220
It's gonna make people blind.

1940
01:28:58,220 --> 01:28:59,220
Then it's gonna end.

1941
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:00,220
Thanks, Obama.

1942
01:29:00,220 --> 01:29:01,860
But we digress.

1943
01:29:01,860 --> 01:29:06,540
Anyway, the big thing is that they're saying that TV is actually less important to children

1944
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:11,740
who are using their DVR services more, and they pay for Netflix and YouTube.

1945
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:17,900
They watch that much more than actual television, than broadcast television.

1946
01:29:17,900 --> 01:29:23,300
And another thing that was reported to the BBC is that the internet has become, basically,

1947
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:25,980
their biggest source of information.

1948
01:29:26,740 --> 01:29:34,540
Now I will pause this in saying that I went over to my friend Becky's house last night

1949
01:29:34,540 --> 01:29:44,460
to find that Julian plays an MMORPG, made for kids, called Pirate101.

1950
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:48,660
And he's talking about, yeah, I need to do this or else my damage will decrease, and

1951
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:54,500
I'm like, blink blink, you're gonna be playing WoW before too long.

1952
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:57,460
But I mean, it's the same thing.

1953
01:29:57,460 --> 01:30:03,060
When I was seven, I was playing games in the 80s on my Nintendo.

1954
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:04,060
Same diff.

1955
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:05,060
Same thing.

1956
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:07,780
As you know, when I was seven, I was playing the ColecoVision.

1957
01:30:07,780 --> 01:30:12,100
And I was getting yelled at by my mother, Rab, you're sitting too close to the TV, Rab.

1958
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:15,780
But I'm like, that's the only way I'm gonna actually be able to shoot the ducks, is to

1959
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:17,460
get right in front of the damn TV.

1960
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:18,460
Oh, no no no no.

1961
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:22,380
My mom was like, you're too close to the TV, what, can you not see it?

1962
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:24,420
And then, you know, three years later I get glasses.

1963
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:29,260
Because I'm nearsighted, I was like, well gee, mom, maybe that should have been your

1964
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:30,260
first clue.

1965
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:33,800
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games

1966
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:35,900
ruining vision near you.

1967
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:36,900
First in America, Loki.

1968
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:45,460
Yeah, so now we have one of the first expansions for Sims 4, Sims 4, get back to work!

1969
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:46,460
I don't want to.

1970
01:30:46,460 --> 01:30:47,460
On PC.

1971
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:50,540
Story of Seasons on 3DS.

1972
01:30:50,540 --> 01:30:54,340
On PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, they're kind of doing a bundle from Square Enix, they've

1973
01:30:54,340 --> 01:30:59,980
got Just Cause, Sleeping Dogs, and Tomb Raider bundled together for $29.99, and that's the

1974
01:30:59,980 --> 01:31:04,660
ultimate action triple pack, because, you know, they've got to race off some of those

1975
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:07,460
old discs.

1976
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:16,460
Toa Kidin, Kowami on Vita, and we've got MLB 15 the Show on Vita, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation

1977
01:31:16,460 --> 01:31:23,380
4, as well as the MLB The Show 10th Anniversary Edition on PlayStation 4 as well.

1978
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:31,300
Also the Ultimate Stealth Pack, which is another compilation by Square Enix, including Thief,

1979
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:35,260
Hitman, and Deus Ex.

1980
01:31:35,260 --> 01:31:39,300
And then we've got RBI Baseball 15 on PC.

1981
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:43,060
What else do we have here?

1982
01:31:43,060 --> 01:31:44,060
Lots of baseball.

1983
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:46,300
It's all being released at the same time.

1984
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:48,140
Let's see.

1985
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:50,020
Oh, that'll be it, actually.

1986
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:51,020
We end with baseball.

1987
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:52,020
Alright, fair enough.

1988
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:55,420
Well, let's travel over to Japan, and I'm going to start off with a whopper here, because

1989
01:31:55,420 --> 01:32:02,560
on April 2nd, Loki, listen up, Earth Defense Force is 4.1, the Shadow of New Despair comes

1990
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:05,780
out of Japan on April 2nd on the PlayStation 4.

1991
01:32:05,780 --> 01:32:06,780
Do not say that.

1992
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:08,460
That is one of my...

1993
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:14,980
Oh, you two should be besties, because he talks about that all the time, Earth Defense

1994
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:15,980
Force.

1995
01:32:16,660 --> 01:32:17,740
I even got Brianna into that game.

1996
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:22,940
She was, you know, yeah, ee-dee, yeah, ee-dee, yeah, ee-dee, text message, yeah, yeah, just

1997
01:32:22,940 --> 01:32:23,940
incredible.

1998
01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:24,940
Oh, my God.

1999
01:32:24,940 --> 01:32:27,340
I saw the trailer for, wait, is that only for PlayStation?

2000
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:30,020
That is on PlayStation 4, at least in Japan.

2001
01:32:30,020 --> 01:32:34,900
Remember, I'm reading Japanese release dates, so that's coming out of Japan, but PS4 region

2002
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:35,900
free, right?

2003
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:36,900
Or no?

2004
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:37,900
Yes.

2005
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:38,900
Uh-oh.

2006
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:39,900
Uh-oh.

2007
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:40,900
Well.

2008
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:41,900
Oh, boy.

2009
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:45,460
I was going to get a PS4 today, and I didn't, and I had to change my mind.

2010
01:32:45,940 --> 01:32:47,540
They'll eventually release it over here, just...

2011
01:32:47,540 --> 01:32:48,540
No, no, no, I can't wait.

2012
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:50,260
No, it's Earth Defense Force.

2013
01:32:50,260 --> 01:32:51,260
I will import that game.

2014
01:32:51,260 --> 01:32:52,260
I understand.

2015
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:53,260
I understand.

2016
01:32:53,260 --> 01:32:56,780
Lego Batman 3, also seeing a release in Japan this week.

2017
01:32:56,780 --> 01:32:59,980
I'm going to check the Xbox One for you, but I don't see...

2018
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:01,460
No, it was only on PlayStation 4.

2019
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:03,100
Yeah, I don't see Earth Defense Force there.

2020
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:06,940
I do see Dark Souls 2 on April 9th, but that's on the Xbox One.

2021
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:10,580
But that Earth Defense Force game is just an upgrade of, you know, 2048 or whatever

2022
01:33:10,580 --> 01:33:12,460
the last one was that they had come out.

2023
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:13,460
Yep, 2025.

2024
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:14,460
2025.

2025
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:15,460
That's close enough.

2026
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:21,980
So, I mean, that's good, but I really wanted just a new Earth Defense Force game.

2027
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:23,580
Well, maybe you will.

2028
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:24,580
Maybe you will.

2029
01:33:24,580 --> 01:33:30,300
On the PlayStation 3 in Japan this week, Dai 3G Super Robot Taisen Z Tengoku Hen comes

2030
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:32,740
out this week from Bandai Namco, who makes...

2031
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:34,220
That's a series that will never die.

2032
01:33:34,220 --> 01:33:35,220
I was going to say, yeah.

2033
01:33:35,220 --> 01:33:36,620
Makes those games all the time.

2034
01:33:36,620 --> 01:33:37,620
All the time.

2035
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:43,540
On the Wii U this week, we have Lego Batman 3 on the Wii U, as well as Rodea the Sky Soldier

2036
01:33:43,620 --> 01:33:45,860
comes out on the Wii U this week.

2037
01:33:45,860 --> 01:33:50,620
And on the handheld systems this week, on the Vita, we have that same Dai 3G Super Robot

2038
01:33:50,620 --> 01:33:57,020
Taisen, and we also have Norn 9, Norn plus Nonet Last Era comes out on the Vita this

2039
01:33:57,020 --> 01:33:58,020
week.

2040
01:33:58,020 --> 01:34:01,860
And lastly, but not leastly, on the 3DS this week, that Lego Batman game is out there as

2041
01:34:01,860 --> 01:34:02,860
well.

2042
01:34:02,860 --> 01:34:06,340
Some new cover plates, just to rub it in a little bit, which you will not be seeing ever

2043
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:09,420
in the States, because they won't release that little 3DS here.

2044
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:13,340
But if you're in Japan, you can get some Zelda and Xenoblade face plates for your new

2045
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:14,340
3DS.

2046
01:34:14,340 --> 01:34:15,340
Oh, God.

2047
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:18,980
Xenoblade also getting its Japanese release this week on April the 2nd.

2048
01:34:18,980 --> 01:34:20,860
That's kind of a big deal.

2049
01:34:20,860 --> 01:34:30,020
Also Terra Formars, Akaki Hoshi no Gekitou comes out, and one more from Capcom here.

2050
01:34:30,020 --> 01:34:31,620
That was impressive, by the way, dude.

2051
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:32,620
What's that?

2052
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:33,620
That was impressive.

2053
01:34:33,620 --> 01:34:34,620
I was like...

2054
01:34:34,620 --> 01:34:35,620
How you read that?

2055
01:34:35,620 --> 01:34:36,620
That was good.

2056
01:34:36,620 --> 01:34:37,620
Bless your hearts.

2057
01:34:37,620 --> 01:34:40,940
After all these years, it's finally happened.

2058
01:34:40,940 --> 01:34:43,260
Somebody has complimented my Japanese.

2059
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:44,260
I never...

2060
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:45,260
I just need a moment.

2061
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:46,260
I'd like to make all...

2062
01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:47,700
How you fill in the klempt?

2063
01:34:47,700 --> 01:34:48,700
A little bit.

2064
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:49,700
A little bit.

2065
01:34:49,700 --> 01:34:55,100
Gaya Kuten Saiben 5 also gets a price reduction.

2066
01:34:55,100 --> 01:34:56,100
You know that is, right?

2067
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:57,100
Actually, I don't.

2068
01:34:57,100 --> 01:34:58,100
Ace Attorney.

2069
01:34:58,100 --> 01:34:59,100
Is it?

2070
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:00,100
Oh, it is.

2071
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:01,100
No kidding.

2072
01:35:01,100 --> 01:35:02,100
Phoenix Wright.

2073
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:03,100
There it is.

2074
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:05,100
So that gets a little price reduction if you need to catch up on that in Japan this week.

2075
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:06,100
There you go.

2076
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:07,100
That's it for Japan.

2077
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:08,100
How about the UK, DarkSakura?

2078
01:35:08,100 --> 01:35:14,980
On the 30th, as I mentioned last week, Bloodsportz.tv on PC, 31st Neverwinter for Xbone.

2079
01:35:14,980 --> 01:35:16,420
I'm sorry, Xbox One.

2080
01:35:16,420 --> 01:35:19,780
April 1st, Pool Nation FX.

2081
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:24,620
Let me go to actually official April now.

2082
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:27,900
On the 2nd, we have Xenoblade Chronicles for 3DS.

2083
01:35:27,900 --> 01:35:33,060
On the 3rd, Dark Souls II, Scholar of the First Sin on Damn Near Everything.

2084
01:35:33,060 --> 01:35:34,060
And that's it.

2085
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:35,060
All right.

2086
01:35:35,060 --> 01:35:38,420
Just a couple more stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

2087
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:40,740
We're gonna run through these quickly for time, Loki.

2088
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:42,100
I wasn't looking up.

2089
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:43,620
Oh, there it is.

2090
01:35:43,620 --> 01:35:44,860
Ooh, $59.99.

2091
01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:45,860
That's not too bad.

2092
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:46,860
Loki, news, news.

2093
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:47,860
Sorry.

2094
01:35:47,860 --> 01:35:48,860
Distracted.

2095
01:35:48,860 --> 01:35:53,900
So anyways, this is pretty cool if you live in Russia.

2096
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:58,520
You can actually play Halo Online, much like they did Call of Duty Online.

2097
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:04,060
Now they have an online-only version of Halo where you can play multiplayer games and it's

2098
01:36:04,060 --> 01:36:05,100
free to play.

2099
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:08,420
That's pretty awesome.

2100
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:12,100
It is running on a modified version of the Halo 3 engine.

2101
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:15,700
And I guess it's supposed to take place on the secret UNSC space installation called

2102
01:36:15,700 --> 01:36:18,180
Anvil.

2103
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:19,180
Looks pretty awesome.

2104
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:20,500
Too bad they'll never ever come over here.

2105
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:24,380
Uh, I would hope maybe it's being tested and maybe we could see it here.

2106
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:25,860
Why did they pick Russia though?

2107
01:36:25,860 --> 01:36:27,860
That's what I don't understand.

2108
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:29,660
Same thing happened with Call of Duty Online.

2109
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:31,620
It never came out over here either and that's in China.

2110
01:36:31,620 --> 01:36:32,620
That's true.

2111
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:34,140
And Civilization Online is in China only.

2112
01:36:34,140 --> 01:36:35,780
I tried playing Call of Duty Online.

2113
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:36,780
Did you?

2114
01:36:36,780 --> 01:36:41,860
It's awesome because it was all the Call of Duty 1 and 2 maps with the Call of Duty Modern

2115
01:36:41,860 --> 01:36:42,860
Warfare 3.

2116
01:36:42,860 --> 01:36:47,860
Or I'm sorry, the Modern Warfare 1 and 2 maps with the Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 engine

2117
01:36:47,860 --> 01:36:49,860
and weapons.

2118
01:36:49,860 --> 01:36:52,300
So is Halo a super big deal in Russia?

2119
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:53,300
We're just not aware?

2120
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:54,300
I don't know.

2121
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:57,860
Yeah, I mean because we know Starcraft and Korea.

2122
01:36:57,860 --> 01:36:59,060
We know how they roll.

2123
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:02,060
They release Dynasty Warriors Online everywhere.

2124
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:04,020
Why the hell couldn't they do Halo Online?

2125
01:37:04,020 --> 01:37:08,460
I'm sure if it's free to play someone will find a way to be able to get around it where

2126
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:09,460
you can play it.

2127
01:37:09,460 --> 01:37:10,460
Patch it.

2128
01:37:10,460 --> 01:37:11,460
Yeah.

2129
01:37:11,460 --> 01:37:12,460
Maybe it won't be Apache.

2130
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:13,460
You'll just play it in Russian.

2131
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:16,460
I mean that's how it worked with Fantasy Star Online 2.

2132
01:37:16,460 --> 01:37:19,340
A lot of people did that because you weren't supposed to play that outside Japan.

2133
01:37:19,340 --> 01:37:20,340
True that.

2134
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:21,620
Hey, wouldn't it be awesome if they brought that to the Wii U?

2135
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:22,700
That might be pretty nice.

2136
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:24,540
You know why you gotta fucking tease me?

2137
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:26,060
Like why do you gotta do that?

2138
01:37:26,060 --> 01:37:27,740
You know that's a soft spot for me.

2139
01:37:27,740 --> 01:37:28,740
Why are you doing that?

2140
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:32,420
Alright, because I know they'll never do it.

2141
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:33,420
Maybe.

2142
01:37:33,420 --> 01:37:36,260
I know I have some Russian people on Twitter at least.

2143
01:37:36,260 --> 01:37:40,580
I don't know if they still listen to OLR actively, but if you're out there and you're in Russia,

2144
01:37:40,580 --> 01:37:42,940
how's the Halo scene out there?

2145
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:47,300
Any insight as to why you're getting this and the rest of us aren't?

2146
01:37:47,300 --> 01:37:48,300
Sniff.

2147
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:54,300
Anyhow, speaking of Xbox related things, the April system update, you can actually check

2148
01:37:54,300 --> 01:37:56,180
that out right now.

2149
01:37:56,180 --> 01:37:59,900
Some of the previews going on for that if you're in the preview program including voice

2150
01:37:59,900 --> 01:38:02,660
messages finally on the Xbox One.

2151
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:07,060
We talked a little bit about that last week, but voice messages making their way in the

2152
01:38:07,060 --> 01:38:08,940
April update.

2153
01:38:08,940 --> 01:38:10,980
Dedicated servers for party chat.

2154
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:14,180
So to kind of follow up earlier that more and more people are using nothing but party

2155
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:15,180
chat.

2156
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:18,740
Yeah, there are going to be some dedicated chat relay servers that will kind of make

2157
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:24,660
them run more reliably and the what's on area which highlights videos, movies, TV shows

2158
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:26,260
and game broadcasts.

2159
01:38:26,260 --> 01:38:29,700
They are doing some enhancements and just generally trying to make the algorithm and

2160
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:31,140
that work a little better.

2161
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:33,940
So that's all what you have to look forward to in the April update.

2162
01:38:33,940 --> 01:38:38,380
An answer of sorts to the 2.5 update that hit the PlayStation this past week.

2163
01:38:38,380 --> 01:38:43,700
All right, but you know what, let's go back to a much more classic time in gaming.

2164
01:38:43,700 --> 01:38:44,700
We didn't have face plates.

2165
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:46,500
Yeah, you didn't have face plates.

2166
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:49,560
You didn't have updates to your console.

2167
01:38:49,560 --> 01:38:50,560
What is that?

2168
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:53,120
They just kept shrinking.

2169
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:56,560
Or maybe you would get like a top loader NES that you'd never be able to find.

2170
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:58,200
Or your Genesis would shrink.

2171
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:00,800
It's the classic game of the week.

2172
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:04,480
And every week Dark Soccer is going to step into the vault and find a game that she thinks,

2173
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:11,960
hey, you kids and your halos on lines and your Earth Defense Force 41s and all this

2174
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:12,960
stuff.

2175
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:14,680
Don't mock that game dude.

2176
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:16,680
That's EDF dude.

2177
01:39:16,680 --> 01:39:19,200
We got to pay our respects to a classic game first.

2178
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:22,400
So Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week this week?

2179
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:27,960
I will preface this saying that I went specifically looking for a treasure game because you cannot

2180
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:30,620
go wrong with a treasure game.

2181
01:39:30,620 --> 01:39:35,880
So today's classic game of the week came out on the Genesis slash Mega Drive and it is

2182
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:37,640
called Dynamite Heady.

2183
01:39:37,640 --> 01:39:40,640
Oh my goodness.

2184
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:41,920
Wow.

2185
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:49,960
It came out in 1994 when I was a senior in high school and it was on Mega Drive and Genesis

2186
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,720
Game Gear and there was a Master System version.

2187
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:56,320
I'm not sure if it was just one of those Brazilian releases because they still love the Master

2188
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,240
System in Brazil.

2189
01:39:58,240 --> 01:40:02,780
There was a 32X port planned but who likes the 32X?

2190
01:40:02,780 --> 01:40:03,780
Nobody who owned Winded.

2191
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:04,780
I do.

2192
01:40:04,780 --> 01:40:05,780
Oh wait.

2193
01:40:05,780 --> 01:40:09,480
Well, I've got a couple of 32Xs and I pretty much just play Calibri on it.

2194
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:10,480
Or Space Harrier.

2195
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:11,480
Nice.

2196
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:15,040
Because Space Harrier is my third favorite game.

2197
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:16,480
Good choice.

2198
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:22,480
Anyway, it has been ported onto the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007 and was included in

2199
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:27,480
the Gunstar Heroes treasure box collection for PS2 and the Sonic's Ultimate Genesis collection

2200
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:30,720
for Xbox 360 and PS3.

2201
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:36,520
So this is a game where you basically play a puppet who can take off his head and beat

2202
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:39,000
people with it.

2203
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,600
I'll read the official thing.

2204
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:47,480
Eddie arrives in a place called Northtown to see that this evil puppet king has been

2205
01:40:47,480 --> 01:40:52,120
attacking people and turning all the peaceful toys into evil minions.

2206
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:57,440
And so he got captured, got rejected, and he's like, well screw you, I'm going to stop

2207
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:58,440
this.

2208
01:40:58,440 --> 01:40:59,520
And so he did.

2209
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:03,960
So basically he's a puppet with a detachable head and his head can be fired in eight different

2210
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:10,960
directions and he can use it to smack obstacles as well as reach items.

2211
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:14,760
He can hold onto a thing called a hangman, lets him pull himself up platforms.

2212
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:19,280
So he's sort of like Bionic Commando with his head.

2213
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:25,120
You also can find a case walking around called Head Case that can give his head special damage.

2214
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:28,080
So basically this is a game where you get head.

2215
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:34,000
Anyway, so he basically can get like homing stars or he can suck things off the screen

2216
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:41,520
and he has different heads that have invulnerability or shrinking and all kinds of other special

2217
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:43,960
things can go on.

2218
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:49,560
It even has a side scrolling shooter stage so that heady can charge and use his different

2219
01:41:49,560 --> 01:41:51,760
head types.

2220
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:58,920
You know, I have to pause for a second because every time I think of head, I think of the

2221
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:06,840
monkeys movie head and they were quoted saying that if ever they did a sequel, they wanted

2222
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:11,920
it to be from the people who gave you head.

2223
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:13,920
I love the monkeys.

2224
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:19,440
Anyway, so basically you have all kinds of different scenes, different locations, you

2225
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:23,840
find a different boss, and then you have to collect all these different pieces from

2226
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:26,120
defeating keymasters.

2227
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:27,480
Are you the keymaster?

2228
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:29,480
Are you the gatekeeper?

2229
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:33,080
Anyway, and you know basically just make it through the game.

2230
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:39,800
You also get the liberty head, ho head, where you enter a bonus stage with your head and

2231
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:41,920
shoot basketballs into hoops.

2232
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:46,920
So you get different codes and when you compile the code at the end you get a bonus stage.

2233
01:42:46,920 --> 01:42:50,800
So you've got different characters in the games.

2234
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:56,560
You have heady, you have a girl with floating hands called heather, although her other name

2235
01:42:56,560 --> 01:43:01,840
is fangie.

2236
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:03,400
Does she throw her fingers around?

2237
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:07,960
No, she just uses her fingers for the keymaster.

2238
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:10,800
You have dark demon or king dark demon.

2239
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:13,680
You have trouble bruin or mariyama.

2240
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:20,320
You have head case, also known as mokun, I'm sure you can figure out what the Japanese

2241
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,320
ones are by now.

2242
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:23,320
You have hangman or hukun.

2243
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:25,080
You have bow or yakun.

2244
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:26,080
You have bino.

2245
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:28,900
You have mad dog slash bounty bounty.

2246
01:43:28,900 --> 01:43:30,440
That's actually a cooler name.

2247
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:33,880
Wooden dresser or Jacqueline dressy, as she's called.

2248
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:41,760
Spinderella, who wasn't she the DJ for Salt-N-Pepa?

2249
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:44,160
Spinderella was in this game?

2250
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:45,160
Awesome.

2251
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:46,840
The other name is motor hand.

2252
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:50,160
It would be funny if it was motor head.

2253
01:43:50,160 --> 01:43:53,880
I just gotta say in our chat room real quick over at live.vognetwork.com AkumaJP is saying

2254
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:55,600
is this a horror game?

2255
01:43:55,600 --> 01:44:01,440
You know and I'm like no cause when you're running around giving random people head that's

2256
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:03,440
not horror.

2257
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:06,840
Unless it's from someone you didn't want to give that you had.

2258
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:11,200
Well AkumaJP says oh so this is a horror porn game.

2259
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:16,200
And I'm like and that caused me to think about what are some horror porn games that I've

2260
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:17,200
played.

2261
01:44:17,200 --> 01:44:18,200
This is the horrifying one.

2262
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:21,240
It's the character named baby face also known as mitsuru.

2263
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:24,960
It was the fourth keymaster which is a baby head on a pole.

2264
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:25,960
Wow.

2265
01:44:25,960 --> 01:44:30,720
And he gets older every time he goes to his treasure.

2266
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:34,000
Gatekeeper you have nasty gatekeeper, nasty.

2267
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:39,400
You have twin freak slash reaver face and smiley.

2268
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:44,160
So dynamite heady it was a really good game.

2269
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:49,840
I mean it's just treasure can hardly do anything wrong pretty much.

2270
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:53,480
When it came out it got EGM gave it a seven point six out of ten.

2271
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:59,080
Famitsu gave it an eight out of ten which is not bad for Famitsu back in the day.

2272
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:04,500
It's just it was a really good game and that's all I have to say.

2273
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:07,720
Treasure or as my friend says it treasure.

2274
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:08,720
Treasure.

2275
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:13,960
There it is your classic game of the week dynamite heady.

2276
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:15,640
The prequel to dynamite rave.

2277
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:16,640
Just kidding.

2278
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:17,640
What?

2279
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:18,640
Thingy.

2280
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:25,760
Going to our chat room where they're talking about horror porn.

2281
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,000
Bobby Blackwell saying phantasmagoria.

2282
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:32,840
I was the first one I thought about but that night trap.

2283
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:34,760
I thought it was a night trap.

2284
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:38,680
That's if we're gonna take it there with full FMV night trap.

2285
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:43,240
That was more than anything else but oh god bless phantasmagoria good call that was a

2286
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:44,240
great game.

2287
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:45,240
Alright.

2288
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:48,600
I named that last week as a game I thought had been really dated though.

2289
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:49,600
Yeah.

2290
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:50,600
Phantasmagoria.

2291
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:51,600
Yeah.

2292
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:52,600
Alright.

2293
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:53,600
Good game though.

2294
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:54,600
We're gonna take a break though.

2295
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:56,720
There's plenty more Orange Laundry to come believe it or not.

2296
01:45:56,720 --> 01:46:00,280
We're gonna really run through part B when you guys come back with some rapid fire news.

2297
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:02,000
The FUCL Question of the Week.

2298
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:07,240
Some news about one of something Loki has raved about on this show time and time again.

2299
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:08,840
Going to the next level.

2300
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:09,840
Pun intended.

2301
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:14,680
And we're gonna talk about that when we come back with part B of Orange Lounge Radio.

2302
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:18,960
Also your emails, the FUs of the Week, and your phone calls if you wanna give us a call

We'll get to all that when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.

2305
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:34,440
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

2306
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:40,000
We are live on this March the 29th of 2015 with the 592nd episode of our show already

2307
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,240

2308
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:46,920
I will say though here Gabriel and Brianna are friends from the Sacramento IGDA.

2309
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:50,200
They're actually about ready to head out, take care of some other business before it's

2310
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:51,800

2311
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:52,800
Oh God.

2312
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:55,040
But I wanted to thank you guys so much for coming to the show tonight.

2313
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:56,040
Thank you.

2314
01:46:56,040 --> 01:46:57,040
Seriously.

2315
01:46:57,040 --> 01:47:00,840
You guys have been so great in like promoting us and VOG and I am glad we can do the same

2316
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:03,600
for you guys and we so look forward to the event.

2317
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:06,920
Saturday after this coming one's coming right around the corner.

2318
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:07,920
Very excited.

2319
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:08,920
Yep.

2320
01:47:08,920 --> 01:47:09,920
Yep.

2321
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:10,920
And it's a pleasure.

2322
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:11,920
It's a pleasure to have this happen.

2323
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:12,920
So thank you.

2324
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:16,560
Thank you for broadcasting live at our event too because everybody put a lot of heart into

2325
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:20,840
this and we just wanna share that with your listeners.

2326
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:21,840
So thank you.

2327
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:22,840
We're happy to do it.

2328
01:47:22,840 --> 01:47:23,840
We're happy to.

2329
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:24,840
We wanna share.

2330
01:47:24,840 --> 01:47:27,040
We wanna get more indie stuff out there and people, you know, you don't know about it

2331
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:28,040
unless you hear about it.

2332
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:29,720
So we're happy to do that.

2333
01:47:29,720 --> 01:47:33,560
Real quick though before you guys take off any like last plugs to give before we get

2334
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:35,800
into our forum feedback this week.

2335
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:38,200
Anything you guys wanna plug on your way out of here?

2336
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:43,060
Well I mean again like we talked about earlier just check the Crumple demo game out.

2337
01:47:43,060 --> 01:47:44,060
Check it out.

2338
01:47:44,060 --> 01:47:45,060
Hit us up.

2339
01:47:45,060 --> 01:47:49,280
You know, let me know what you think and yeah I mean right now that's it and the indie arcade

2340
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:50,280
event.

2341
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:51,280
Yeah.

2342
01:47:51,280 --> 01:47:52,280
Indiearcade.org.

2343
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:53,280
If you wanna know the website.

2344
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:55,440
If you haven't bought tickets yet go there.

2345
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:57,640
That's where all the information is at.

2346
01:47:57,640 --> 01:48:01,080
So indiearcade.org is where you can go.

2347
01:48:01,080 --> 01:48:04,540
You can buy your tickets, get more information on who's gonna be talking, playing, all that

2348
01:48:04,540 --> 01:48:05,540
good stuff.

2349
01:48:05,540 --> 01:48:06,540
Awesome.

2350
01:48:06,540 --> 01:48:09,600
Cause we didn't even talk about like the symphony and the other music performers you got showing

2351
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,600
up.

2352
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:11,600
I know.

2353
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:12,600
Yeah.

2354
01:48:12,600 --> 01:48:13,600
I mean we've got, yeah the performers.

2355
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:14,600
Yeah.

2356
01:48:14,600 --> 01:48:15,600
We talked about the speakers but the performers.

2357
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:18,520
Reno Video Game Symphony returning for their second time and then Petraform who performed

2358
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:21,960
at Rockage will be performing at our event as well.

2359
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:25,920
Brie, do I, anything, okay.

2360
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:30,720
Anything that we didn't mention on the show can be found on Twitter also at Sac Indie

2361
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:31,720
Arcade.

2362
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:32,720
Awesome.

2363
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:36,280
And again, you know, we wanna encourage people beyond Sacramento to check out what's brewing

2364
01:48:36,280 --> 01:48:41,240
here in the Bay Area's neighbor, Silicon Valley's neighbor, we're making a name for ourselves

2365
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:42,240
as well here.

2366
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:43,880
We welcome everybody with open arms.

2367
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:44,880
Awesome.

2368
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:45,880
Awesome.

2369
01:48:45,880 --> 01:48:49,520
Well, best of luck to you guys in this final crunch time before your event and I still

2370
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:50,560
look forward to it.

2371
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:54,940
So thanks again for being on the show tonight and it sounds like this will be the first

2372
01:48:54,980 --> 01:48:56,900
of many appearances by these guys on our show.

2373
01:48:56,900 --> 01:48:59,020
I'm looking forward to it.

2374
01:48:59,020 --> 01:49:00,020
I'm looking forward to it.

2375
01:49:00,020 --> 01:49:01,020
Awesome.

2376
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:02,020
I want that review of Earth Defense Force, Gabriel.

2377
01:49:02,020 --> 01:49:03,020
Yes.

2378
01:49:03,020 --> 01:49:04,020
Gotta hear it.

2379
01:49:04,020 --> 01:49:05,020
I may buy that.

2380
01:49:05,020 --> 01:49:06,020
Be careful what you wish for.

2381
01:49:06,020 --> 01:49:08,020
I wish, I wish, I wish.

2382
01:49:08,020 --> 01:49:09,020
All right.

2383
01:49:09,020 --> 01:49:10,780
Thank you guys so much for being here and especially live.

2384
01:49:10,780 --> 01:49:14,780
Not many people get to be here live in studio but only in Sacramento or where we're at.

2385
01:49:14,780 --> 01:49:16,860
We're not in San Jose or LA.

2386
01:49:16,860 --> 01:49:17,860
All right.

2387
01:49:17,860 --> 01:49:23,820
Well, I'm gonna get into some foreign feedback tonight and get into that segment here and

2388
01:49:23,820 --> 01:49:28,540
of course, you guys can participate in our forums over at vognetwork.com.

2389
01:49:28,540 --> 01:49:36,340
You just click on forums and I do have one topic to talk about tonight that popped up

2390
01:49:36,340 --> 01:49:41,220
on the forums this week and it's one of those that was user-created.

2391
01:49:41,220 --> 01:49:47,100
I didn't even do this but good old SSJ100Matt actually made this topic on our forums this

2392
01:49:47,100 --> 01:49:54,660
week and it's about the topic we got into last week of Nintendo mobile games.

2393
01:49:54,660 --> 01:49:59,340
So SSJ100Matt last week had mentioned going off the big news last week that Nintendo is

2394
01:49:59,340 --> 01:50:04,280
going to be making games out of their popular franchises for mobile smartphone tablet smart

2395
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:05,280
device.

2396
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:08,900
This was a big move by Nintendo since they've been very reluctant to allow their franchises

2397
01:50:08,900 --> 01:50:11,280
to be on platforms other than their own.

2398
01:50:11,280 --> 01:50:14,500
Many people including investors felt it was about time for the company to venture into

2399
01:50:14,500 --> 01:50:16,940
the mobile market while some were hesitant.

2400
01:50:16,940 --> 01:50:20,460
Regardless, Nintendo's franchises will be reaching a far broader audience than it has

2401
01:50:20,460 --> 01:50:21,460
before.

2402
01:50:21,460 --> 01:50:26,060
But this made me wonder, what type of games and what Nintendo franchises could we see

2403
01:50:26,060 --> 01:50:28,920
ourselves playing on these devices?

2404
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:34,020
So SSJ100Matt goes over some of his picks including Pokemon Shuffle, which we've talked

2405
01:50:34,020 --> 01:50:38,980
about, you know, before would make a good mobile game most likely, Advance Wars, which

2406
01:50:38,980 --> 01:50:43,460
I brought up on the show last week but certainly, as SSJ100Matt says, I've been waiting a long

2407
01:50:43,460 --> 01:50:47,020
time for this franchise to make a comeback and I think the mobile platform is a perfect

2408
01:50:47,020 --> 01:50:48,140
place for it.

2409
01:50:48,140 --> 01:50:52,820
This game just screams a very fun tablet experience and even allows some possible multiplayer

2410
01:50:52,820 --> 01:50:54,140
aspects.

2411
01:50:54,140 --> 01:50:59,020
And then WarioWare, I thought that was a really good suggestion, WarioWare.

2412
01:50:59,020 --> 01:51:02,780
While it may be a little gimmicky, I think WarioWare would be great on the mobile platform

2413
01:51:02,780 --> 01:51:04,460
utilizing the gyroscopics.

2414
01:51:04,460 --> 01:51:08,100
I think this could be a very fun and probably public embarrassing experience.

2415
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:11,540
I can also see some fun pass and play multiplayer mechanics.

2416
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:13,340
I think WarioWare is a great suggestion.

2417
01:51:13,340 --> 01:51:17,840
Well, considering that it was at one time on the Game Boy Advance, I could see them

2418
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:18,840
doing that.

2419
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:19,840
Yeah, absolutely.

2420
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:20,840
So we'll see what happens.

2421
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:24,980
And then with the touch screens and all that, it could really play into that a lot.

2422
01:51:24,980 --> 01:51:27,460
Tigerclaw say, excellent mobile games.

2423
01:51:27,460 --> 01:51:31,500
Mobile games don't really give you the AAA experience you get from the Wii U or the 3DS.

2424
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:34,620
I could see them more as companion games to the bigger ones.

2425
01:51:34,620 --> 01:51:38,440
Flaco Jones suggested, since Hearthstone is a mobile game that I think is amazing and

2426
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:42,560
does mobile gaming right by not forcing players to nickel and dine themselves to death in

2427
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:47,100
order to have fun, I sort of hope they do a Hearthstone style trading card game with

2428
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:52,000
Nintendo's All-Stars and their famous abilities featured on the cards.

2429
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,600
You know, isn't there a Pokemon trading card game?

2430
01:51:55,600 --> 01:52:00,360
I mean, that would be prime to convert over, but maybe, you know, I can also see maybe

2431
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:05,560
they don't want to do that because, you know, that makes their bread and butter in the old

2432
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:06,560
fashioned way.

2433
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:07,760
And maybe they don't want to get into that.

2434
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:08,920
I don't know.

2435
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:13,540
But anyway, that topic on our forums, that was some of the responses there.

2436
01:52:13,540 --> 01:52:17,860
So check that out over at vognetwork.com slash forums.

2437
01:52:17,860 --> 01:52:22,480
And if you have a topic, especially follow up that you want us to talk about on the show

2438
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:25,660
with your perspective, be sure to post it.

2439
01:52:25,660 --> 01:52:27,600
We like to read that stuff here on the show.

2440
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:28,600
All right.

2441
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:33,280
Well, we're going to move on with some rapid fire news and travel around the world of gaming

2442
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:36,720
quickly and see what else is going on that we just don't have time to fit in anywhere

2443
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:37,720
else.

2444
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:38,720
Loki.

2445
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:41,660
So Microsoft is upping the amount of free games they're going to give you with their

2446
01:52:41,660 --> 01:52:44,960
Games with Gold program starting in April.

2447
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:50,120
Hopefully this is going to continue on beyond April, but for April, they're going to start

2448
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:55,560
off with, I guess, for Xbox One, you'll be able to download Pool Nation FX and Child

2449
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:56,680
of Light.

2450
01:52:56,680 --> 01:53:01,960
On the Xbox 360, you can get two games for the first half of the month and two games

2451
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:03,200
for the second half.

2452
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:07,120
So for the first half, between April 1st and the 15th, you can get Gears of War Judgment

2453
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:09,260
and Terraria.

2454
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:14,160
And during the latter half of the month, you get Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag and Army

2455
01:53:14,160 --> 01:53:16,840
II The Devil's Cartel.

2456
01:53:16,840 --> 01:53:22,840
That's a pretty good offering, I'd say, and those are all really recent games.

2457
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:27,600
And then, let's see here, unfortunately, there's yet another delay.

2458
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:29,000
Another big AAA game.

2459
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:33,080
Batman Arkham Knight has been delayed now.

2460
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:38,880
The word is that the new date that's supposed to be released is June 23rd, 2015.

2461
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:39,880
And no word.

2462
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:40,880
Hey, it's our show's birthday!

2463
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:41,880
Yay!

2464
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:44,840
Same date as Heaven's Word for Final Fantasy XIV.

2465
01:53:44,840 --> 01:53:47,200
I am screwed that week.

2466
01:53:47,200 --> 01:53:53,440
So obviously, it's to polish up the game a little bit more, but it seems to be a trend

2467
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:57,040
nowadays, with a lot of AAA games getting pushed back.

2468
01:53:57,080 --> 01:54:04,000
Thankfully, this isn't into 2016 yet, so I'm kinda glad to see that they're at least giving

2469
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:08,160
themselves more time, as opposed to putting out a game that's really buggy.

2470
01:54:08,160 --> 01:54:11,440
What'll really suck is if they give themselves more time and put out a game that's really

2471
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:12,720
buggy.

2472
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:15,440
So hopefully that's not the case.

2473
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:21,360
Last but not least, there's a brand new video out there for Mortal Kombat X that's confirming

2474
01:54:21,360 --> 01:54:24,920
Liu Kang as a playable character in the game.

2475
01:54:24,920 --> 01:54:31,680
And there was another player I want to say that they showed off to, like some sort of

2476
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:34,000
cowboy-looking guy as well.

2477
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:38,640
And of course, Mortal Kombat X is only a few weeks away, actually.

2478
01:54:38,640 --> 01:54:40,400
Yeah, it's really close.

2479
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:45,400
So at least on PlayStation 4 and PC and Xbox One.

2480
01:54:45,400 --> 01:54:46,400
Awesome.

2481
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:50,760
Alright, I just want to say quickly, in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, I was

2482
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:56,600
getting some feedback there on the Nintendo mobile that I was talking about with the forum.

2483
01:54:56,600 --> 01:55:02,800
And Fifth Dream in our chat poking out and saying, Pokemon card game is mobile already.

2484
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:03,800
I didn't realize that.

2485
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:08,000
And gives the link to where the Pokemon trading card game online is on the App Store and iTunes.

2486
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:09,000
I did not realize that.

2487
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:10,000
I stand corrected.

2488
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Well, there you go.

2489
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:15,120
Akuma JP suggesting, I don't think you'll see existing titles to mobile yet, but you'll

2490
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:18,800
see new ideas and titles from Nintendo to mobile.

2491
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:24,960
See, I'm sort of with you there, but I sort of feel like we'll see franchises move in

2492
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:26,700
a new mobile direction.

2493
01:55:26,700 --> 01:55:29,120
Like you know they're going to put Mario's face on a mobile game somewhere.

2494
01:55:29,120 --> 01:55:30,120
They have to.

2495
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:33,440
What about like all those mini games that they had for like Mario Kart or Mario 64 on

2496
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:34,440
the DS?

2497
01:55:34,440 --> 01:55:37,160
Remember how they used to have all those like, was it Yoshi mini games or whatever?

2498
01:55:37,160 --> 01:55:38,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2499
01:55:38,160 --> 01:55:39,160
Yeah, you never know.

2500
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:40,160
You never know.

2501
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:41,160
Something like that.

2502
01:55:41,160 --> 01:55:42,160
Maybe expanding on some of these other ideas.

2503
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:43,160
Who knows?

2504
01:55:43,160 --> 01:55:44,160
Alright, anyhow.

2505
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:46,440
Moving on to some other, I just want to get those comments out there.

2506
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:47,960
I thought they were all really good.

2507
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:54,640
Anyway, some interesting updates this week on VR and, you know, as this is an expanding

2508
01:55:54,640 --> 01:55:59,160
thing, as more and more people are trying out things like Gear VR and Oculus Rift and

2509
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:06,280
so forth, you know, the reality sets in that some people don't respond too well in terms

2510
01:56:06,280 --> 01:56:10,020
of getting sick from playing these devices.

2511
01:56:10,020 --> 01:56:13,380
So of course, you know, they're trying to figure out how can we make it so that people,

2512
01:56:13,380 --> 01:56:18,860
you know, who are very sensitive to this sort of stuff don't get sick with this.

2513
01:56:18,860 --> 01:56:26,220
So apparently one idea to help is creating a virtual nose.

2514
01:56:26,220 --> 01:56:30,660
This is from a study that was done at Purdue University.

2515
01:56:30,660 --> 01:56:36,220
Assistant professor Dave Whittinghill studied simulator sickness and one of the research

2516
01:56:36,220 --> 01:56:39,020
assistants suggested putting in a nose.

2517
01:56:39,020 --> 01:56:44,020
And so by putting in the nose and participants who were given this virtual nose, they didn't

2518
01:56:44,020 --> 01:56:47,120
even report noticing it until it was pointed out.

2519
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:51,740
So apparently having like that nose in there, because you kind of see it, I guess, I don't

2520
01:56:51,740 --> 01:56:55,520
know how often I really look at my nose, but I guess you're kind of aware it's there.

2521
01:56:55,520 --> 01:57:02,020
So kind of having that in the simulator vision makes people a little less sick.

2522
01:57:02,020 --> 01:57:04,020
Follow your nose!

2523
01:57:04,020 --> 01:57:05,520
Follow your nose!

2524
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:10,240
Anyway, obviously, you know, everybody responds differently to different situations.

2525
01:57:10,240 --> 01:57:13,660
And you know, ultimately, people are gonna have to find what works best for them.

2526
01:57:13,660 --> 01:57:18,640
But I thought that was a pretty creative solution to trying and help people deal with some of

2527
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:20,960
the motion sickness that can come with that.

2528
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:22,880
Have that with like the character creators in the game.

2529
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:26,240
So if you give a character like a giant nose, it just takes up a large portion.

2530
01:57:26,240 --> 01:57:27,760
Are you trying to say something about my nose, Loki?

2531
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:30,480
No, I'm trying to say if you're making characters with large noses.

2532
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:31,480
Oh, okay.

2533
01:57:31,480 --> 01:57:32,480
All right.

2534
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:33,480
Fair enough.

2535
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:39,440
Anyhow, Facebook is going to be bringing 360 degree videos to Oculus and the newsfeed.

2536
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:40,440
That's awesome.

2537
01:57:40,440 --> 01:57:42,720
I'm sure they'll autoplay without any sort of way to stop that.

2538
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:45,840
I knew you'd have something smart ass to say.

2539
01:57:45,840 --> 01:57:48,880
Facebook had a big update meeting this week, and of course, you know, now that Facebook

2540
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:51,440
owns Oculus, they talked a little bit about that.

2541
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:55,480
And yes, they do plan to bring spherical video content to its VR headset.

2542
01:57:55,480 --> 01:58:00,660
Now, I think a lot of people, at least I do, I look at this and go, okay, that's the direction

2543
01:58:00,660 --> 01:58:05,020
I expected Facebook to move in is that it's not going to just be about games.

2544
01:58:05,020 --> 01:58:08,460
And even some of the demos I've talked about that I've seen on Oculus before have nothing

2545
01:58:08,460 --> 01:58:10,540
to do necessarily with games.

2546
01:58:10,540 --> 01:58:15,180
Like when Bobby was showing me that Gear VR when I was at PAX East, I didn't play a single

2547
01:58:15,180 --> 01:58:16,180
game on it.

2548
01:58:16,180 --> 01:58:19,860
It had games, but the stuff I just happened to look at was, you know, like a Paul McCartney

2549
01:58:19,860 --> 01:58:21,380
concert where I was there.

2550
01:58:21,380 --> 01:58:26,220
Like, it's like I'm on stage with Paul McCartney and a Cirque du Soleil type experience.

2551
01:58:26,220 --> 01:58:32,580
And I could, I could really see that too, putting those types of experiences on Facebook.

2552
01:58:32,580 --> 01:58:34,380
So yeah, so that's, that's pretty neat.

2553
01:58:34,380 --> 01:58:37,940
And then they were actually showing off some of these 360 degree video viewing experiences

2554
01:58:37,940 --> 01:58:38,940
at the Facebook Dev Conference.

2555
01:58:38,940 --> 01:58:42,840
Are you going to be able to do lines and like say a Scarface type game with your virtual

2556
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:45,180
nose?

2557
01:58:45,180 --> 01:58:46,180
Stop it.

2558
01:58:46,180 --> 01:58:50,300
Actually, Bobby in our chat room over at live.hognetwork.com says it's less about having a nose and more

2559
01:58:50,300 --> 01:58:54,780
about having a frame of reference that your eyes can focus on that doesn't move.

2560
01:58:54,780 --> 01:58:55,780
Yeah.

2561
01:58:56,340 --> 01:59:00,180
It's just in real life, your nose happens to be there.

2562
01:59:00,180 --> 01:59:05,100
So you kind of have that in real life where you may not have that when you're playing

2563
01:59:05,100 --> 01:59:08,820
the Oculus or whatever VR headset you're using.

2564
01:59:08,820 --> 01:59:10,660
And maybe that's the trick for some people.

2565
01:59:10,660 --> 01:59:11,920
I don't know.

2566
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:14,900
But anyhow, so yeah, that could be very interesting.

2567
01:59:14,900 --> 01:59:18,460
I mean, you think about, think about what we're doing today.

2568
01:59:18,460 --> 01:59:24,260
You know, it's all about what, like Snapchat and pictures on Twitter and little videos

2569
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:25,300
on Facebook.

2570
01:59:25,300 --> 01:59:30,540
Imagine that you're going to one day strap on the Gear VR, the Oculus Rift, and you're

2571
01:59:30,540 --> 01:59:35,460
going to look at, here's some highlights that your friends took from around the world.

2572
01:59:35,460 --> 01:59:38,060
And you're going to experience that right now in full 3D motion.

2573
01:59:38,060 --> 01:59:42,020
I kind of feel like that's what we're going to start to see.

2574
01:59:42,020 --> 01:59:43,020
But I don't know.

2575
01:59:43,020 --> 01:59:44,020
We'll see.

2576
01:59:44,020 --> 01:59:45,020
We'll see.

2577
01:59:45,020 --> 01:59:49,460
By the way, also some little hints being dropped that the Oculus Rift could be available this

2578
01:59:49,460 --> 01:59:50,460
year.

2579
01:59:50,460 --> 01:59:55,180
However, Facebook quickly clarifying the comments, saying that they're not trying to announce

2580
01:59:55,180 --> 01:59:57,720
any shipping date regarding the Oculus Rift.

2581
01:59:57,720 --> 02:00:02,400
They were just intending to say that PC hardware will be available this year that can create

2582
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:05,300
the VR experiences that they were speaking about.

2583
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:10,060
But I, you know, whether it's this year or next year, it's really starting to heat up

2584
02:00:10,060 --> 02:00:11,060
a little bit.

2585
02:00:11,060 --> 02:00:14,140
And I think, I kind of think it still will be a little quiet this year.

2586
02:00:14,140 --> 02:00:16,180
I mean, VR is already out there.

2587
02:00:16,180 --> 02:00:19,640
You know, the Gear VR you can get at Best Buy, right?

2588
02:00:19,640 --> 02:00:21,820
So the VR experience is starting to get out there.

2589
02:00:21,820 --> 02:00:25,560
I think it's just going to really start to ramp up, I feel like, you know, next year

2590
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:29,880
between what we're going to see on PlayStation 4, probably more and more of this Oculus ramping

2591
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:30,880
up.

2592
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:33,520
I really think 2016 is going to be a big year for all this.

2593
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:37,560
Anyway, lastly, let's throw it back with some talk about EverQuest.

2594
02:00:37,560 --> 02:00:39,960
And I didn't realize EverQuest did this.

2595
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:43,480
But you know, EverQuest has been around for a long time.

2596
02:00:43,480 --> 02:00:47,120
And EverQuest has been, you know, to kind of keep people interested in what's going

2597
02:00:47,120 --> 02:00:48,120
on over there.

2598
02:00:48,600 --> 02:00:53,000
And a lot of people have been playing an MMO for a very long time, because I saw this all

2599
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:58,440
the time in World of Warcraft, was, man, what if we could play this game vanilla?

2600
02:00:58,440 --> 02:01:01,760
What if we could play this game the way it was intended, the way it was meant to be in

2601
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:04,160
the beginning before all this other stuff?

2602
02:01:04,160 --> 02:01:09,080
Well, EverQuest doing some polls and bringing their users exactly something like that.

2603
02:01:09,080 --> 02:01:13,880
And they're actually looking at and polling the users right now about doing a new progression

2604
02:01:13,880 --> 02:01:14,880
server.

2605
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:19,200
So they're going to start the server as normal, but at a specific point, all progression would

2606
02:01:19,200 --> 02:01:22,480
cease and the server would just stay at that point.

2607
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:26,520
And so, you know, it'll talk about, they go on to talk about like how long some of the

2608
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:28,420
stuff will be locked.

2609
02:01:28,420 --> 02:01:35,120
So like Kunark would be the thing, the Ruins of Kunark would be open for 6.75 months.

2610
02:01:35,120 --> 02:01:38,600
And then Velius for 3.75 months, and so on and so on.

2611
02:01:38,600 --> 02:01:43,120
All these expansions would slowly unlock, which would allow people to kind of appreciate,

2612
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:45,000
I guess, the earlier days.

2613
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:50,240
So they're doing voting on more of like specifically the time frames and when the expansion should

2614
02:01:50,240 --> 02:01:52,200
be unlocked and so forth.

2615
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:55,040
And this, again, just has me kind of thinking about World of Warcraft, which is a game I

2616
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:57,120
have a little more experience with.

2617
02:01:57,120 --> 02:02:00,600
You know, I hear people saying in WoW all the time, oh, I want to see that vanilla server.

2618
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:02,020
I want to see what that was like.

2619
02:02:02,020 --> 02:02:05,160
And then sure enough, when they did that Molten Core raid recently, where you could actually

2620
02:02:05,160 --> 02:02:09,920
have a 40-man team in Molten Raid, everybody was like, this is fucking terrible, trying

2621
02:02:09,920 --> 02:02:11,340
to run through with 40 people.

2622
02:02:11,340 --> 02:02:12,340
This is awful.

2623
02:02:12,540 --> 02:02:15,140
Yet there's still some people clamoring for that vanilla experience.

2624
02:02:15,140 --> 02:02:18,020
So that's something they're doing over in EverQuest, at least.

2625
02:02:18,020 --> 02:02:19,020
Kind of interesting.

2626
02:02:19,020 --> 02:02:20,020
Anyway, Dark Soccer.

2627
02:02:20,020 --> 02:02:21,020
What do you have for us?

2628
02:02:21,020 --> 02:02:24,780
I'm trying not to get tangled over here.

2629
02:02:24,780 --> 02:02:30,860
Well, there is a, this is funny, the folks that are behind Lords of the Fallen, they

2630
02:02:30,860 --> 02:02:35,980
offered Hideo Kojima a job over Twitter.

2631
02:02:35,980 --> 02:02:41,900
It goes, Dear Mr. At Hideo Underscore Kojima Underscore Ian, in case you are currently

2632
02:02:41,900 --> 02:02:45,700
searching, we have an open position as Head of Game Design at Deck 13.

2633
02:02:45,700 --> 02:02:46,700
Please get in touch.

2634
02:02:46,700 --> 02:02:50,460
Yeah, he's probably not going to go for that.

2635
02:02:50,460 --> 02:02:52,740
So let's move forward to Tekken News.

2636
02:02:52,740 --> 02:02:56,420
I love Tekken, all the things practically.

2637
02:02:56,420 --> 02:02:59,500
So coming up in Tekken 7, we are getting Jin.

2638
02:02:59,500 --> 02:03:01,500
Yay, I love Jin.

2639
02:03:01,500 --> 02:03:02,500
Devil Jin.

2640
02:03:02,500 --> 02:03:04,120
Yay, I love Devil Jin, too.

2641
02:03:04,120 --> 02:03:11,020
And a new character named Josie, who is a Philippines-born model and martial artist

2642
02:03:11,020 --> 02:03:14,820
who is pretty, pretty cheerful.

2643
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:20,180
It's also designed by the same person who gave us Bayonetta.

2644
02:03:20,180 --> 02:03:22,420
So that's good.

2645
02:03:22,420 --> 02:03:32,220
And then last but not least, this is actually kind of old.

2646
02:03:32,220 --> 02:03:35,440
Okay.

2647
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:40,620
So yes, Jaws of Hakkon was already been released on Xbox One and PC.

2648
02:03:41,220 --> 02:03:45,660
But the other versions are going to be released much later.

2649
02:03:45,660 --> 02:03:54,940
Those are going to be coming out for PS4 and Xbox on, I think, later this week.

2650
02:03:54,940 --> 02:03:59,060
The Xbox One, I think, came out this week, but yeah, PS4.

2651
02:03:59,060 --> 02:04:07,860
It came out days ago, but I don't know if they put the date for the PS4 one yet.

2652
02:04:07,860 --> 02:04:12,100
I want to say I read somewhere that they couldn't tell us what it is because of some

2653
02:04:12,100 --> 02:04:14,140
type of contractual agreement.

2654
02:04:14,140 --> 02:04:15,140
What the release date is?

2655
02:04:15,140 --> 02:04:16,140
Yeah.

2656
02:04:16,140 --> 02:04:17,140
What the release date is for the PS4.

2657
02:04:17,140 --> 02:04:18,140
Like, they can't tell us what it is.

2658
02:04:18,140 --> 02:04:21,440
Well, I'm going to tell you all right now.

2659
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:23,140
It's pretty and doesn't do much.

2660
02:04:23,140 --> 02:04:26,300
You get a little bit of lore, but it's just pretty.

2661
02:04:26,300 --> 02:04:27,300
Hmm.

2662
02:04:27,300 --> 02:04:28,300
Interesting.

2663
02:04:28,300 --> 02:04:29,300
All right.

2664
02:04:29,300 --> 02:04:30,300
Well, then I guess I'm not missing out so much because I was kind of pissed at first.

2665
02:04:30,300 --> 02:04:33,180
Oh, you get a lot of Scott Harding.

2666
02:04:33,180 --> 02:04:34,180
I love Scott Harding.

2667
02:04:34,180 --> 02:04:35,180
Oh, there you go.

2668
02:04:35,180 --> 02:04:36,180
I wish she was romanceable.

2669
02:04:36,180 --> 02:04:39,140
All right.

2670
02:04:39,140 --> 02:04:41,660
Let's go to the FUGL question of the week.

2671
02:04:41,660 --> 02:04:45,340
Every week here on the show, we go to Facebook and Google Plus, and we ask a question of

2672
02:04:45,340 --> 02:04:51,220
our communities, and when you slam Facebook and Google Plus together, you get FUGL.

2673
02:04:51,220 --> 02:05:02,460
Well, this week in the FUGL question of the week, we asked a little bit about clubs and

2674
02:05:02,460 --> 02:05:07,140
organizations because since our guests tonight were from the Sacramento IGDA, I don't expect

2675
02:05:07,140 --> 02:05:13,300
that everybody that listens to this show is a member of the IGDA, but I figure maybe a

2676
02:05:13,300 --> 02:05:18,340
few of you have belonged to some type of club or association at some point, so we wanted

2677
02:05:18,340 --> 02:05:19,820
to get more information about that.

2678
02:05:19,820 --> 02:05:20,820
Tell us about it.

2679
02:05:20,820 --> 02:05:24,060
Have you ever been the member of a club or association that relates to gaming, like an

2680
02:05:24,060 --> 02:05:30,180
official fan club or an unofficial group dedicated to playing, creating one, or multiple games?

2681
02:05:30,180 --> 02:05:31,260
Tell us about it.

2682
02:05:31,260 --> 02:05:35,780
So over on Facebook, we got RageNator, who said, sort of.

2683
02:05:35,780 --> 02:05:39,620
During my senior year of high school, a few people, including myself, regularly got together

2684
02:05:39,620 --> 02:05:43,140
before school during lunch periods and after to play Magic the Gathering.

2685
02:05:43,140 --> 02:05:44,140
Nerd.

2686
02:05:44,140 --> 02:05:45,140
Just kidding.

2687
02:05:45,140 --> 02:05:46,140
I did the same thing.

2688
02:05:46,140 --> 02:05:50,420
Granted, at the time, it wasn't a club officially sanctioned by the school and didn't have a

2689
02:05:50,420 --> 02:05:54,740
name, but it was the seed that eventually became an official club based on what I was

2690
02:05:54,740 --> 02:05:57,540
told by others that graduated after me.

2691
02:05:57,540 --> 02:05:59,200
Oh, wow.

2692
02:05:59,200 --> 02:06:04,000
It's always weird to me to hear about that something really awesome existed at your high

2693
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,280
school after you left.

2694
02:06:06,280 --> 02:06:10,640
My high school finally started offering Japanese after I left.

2695
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:13,840
Anyway, I guess that always happens.

2696
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:14,840
Princess Ireni.

2697
02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:18,960
Our good pal Princess Ireni actually answered the question here on Facebook this week and

2698
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:25,520
said, I used to run with a crew called the Sacramentals back in the early 2000s.

2699
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:29,680
We played a bunch of Imani games at Roosevelt Golf Land and ate at Brookfield's a lot.

2700
02:06:29,680 --> 02:06:30,680
Maybe you've heard of them.

2701
02:06:30,680 --> 02:06:32,840
They're pretty legendary in these parts.

2702
02:06:32,840 --> 02:06:35,640
I heard they were big fucking nerds.

2703
02:06:35,640 --> 02:06:36,640
You know what?

2704
02:06:36,640 --> 02:06:41,440
I remember trying to actually register that domain to find that some Catholic group already

2705
02:06:41,440 --> 02:06:42,440
had it.

2706
02:06:42,440 --> 02:06:43,440
I was so mad.

2707
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:44,440
All right.

2708
02:06:44,440 --> 02:06:45,440
Anyhow.

2709
02:06:45,440 --> 02:06:51,920
Surping Slurpee responded and said, occasionally I attend board game get togethers every week

2710
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:57,080
between 20 to 30 people get together at Panera, then Denny's after Panera closes, and game

2711
02:06:57,080 --> 02:06:58,080
out.

2712
02:06:58,080 --> 02:07:01,280
Most attendees are in their late 20s to early 30s, though some are older and predominantly

2713
02:07:01,280 --> 02:07:02,280
female.

2714
02:07:02,280 --> 02:07:03,280
It's great fun.

2715
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:05,160
Andy R said, nope.

2716
02:07:05,160 --> 02:07:08,640
Was part of an anime club in college, though, and a lot of our meetings consisted of playing

2717
02:07:08,640 --> 02:07:09,640
games.

2718
02:07:09,640 --> 02:07:12,700
I did hang out with the remnants of our college's Bamani Club a lot when they were basically

2719
02:07:12,700 --> 02:07:15,480
disbanded by the time I met them due to bullshittery.

2720
02:07:15,480 --> 02:07:21,580
I have to remember to use that term more often in my life, bullshittery.

2721
02:07:21,580 --> 02:07:24,440
We completely dominated the school's rock band tournament both years.

2722
02:07:24,440 --> 02:07:25,940
They held it.

2723
02:07:25,940 --> 02:07:30,660
Bryce replied and simply said, no, crying face.

2724
02:07:30,660 --> 02:07:31,660
Start one.

2725
02:07:31,660 --> 02:07:33,140
Bryce needed to start one.

2726
02:07:33,140 --> 02:07:36,340
Deakman replied and said, does Club Nintendo count?

2727
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:39,940
Well, if you helped to run it, maybe.

2728
02:07:39,940 --> 02:07:40,940
No.

2729
02:07:40,940 --> 02:07:41,940
Club Nintendo, I guess.

2730
02:07:41,940 --> 02:07:42,940
Of course Club Nintendo counts.

2731
02:07:42,940 --> 02:07:44,060
Somebody has to say that.

2732
02:07:44,060 --> 02:07:48,060
Dark Tetsuya said, Irene stole my answer, but Wednesdays back in the day with the Sac

2733
02:07:48,060 --> 02:07:53,580
Bamani crew were fucking epic, trying to get all the content unlocked on Max 2 by playing

2734
02:07:53,580 --> 02:07:55,220
the crap out of it.

2735
02:07:55,220 --> 02:07:56,700
Good times.

2736
02:07:56,700 --> 02:07:57,700
That was good times.

2737
02:07:57,700 --> 02:08:01,520
Remember when the whole community had to come together to get stuff in the games?

2738
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:03,180
That was always a good time.

2739
02:08:03,180 --> 02:08:10,740
Anyway, last but not least, and I love this answer over on Google Plus from Prince Peachfuzz.

2740
02:08:10,740 --> 02:08:12,380
One of my other favorite names here.

2741
02:08:12,380 --> 02:08:16,880
Prince Peachfuzz responded and said, does the OL Army count?

2742
02:08:16,880 --> 02:08:17,880
If so, yes.

2743
02:08:17,880 --> 02:08:20,760
Gold star for you, sir.

2744
02:08:20,760 --> 02:08:21,920
Yes, it counts.

2745
02:08:21,920 --> 02:08:23,620
You're all a part of the club now.

2746
02:08:23,620 --> 02:08:28,120
So even the poor guy on Facebook who felt left out, you could be a part of the OL Army.

2747
02:08:28,120 --> 02:08:34,160
We're a club and I'm the president and Jamie is the overlord because she has to outrank

2748
02:08:34,160 --> 02:08:35,560
me.

2749
02:08:35,560 --> 02:08:40,480
I was just going to say I am the queen bee.

2750
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:45,040
And Loki, clearly the court jester.

2751
02:08:45,040 --> 02:08:46,040
Prince of Bacon.

2752
02:08:46,040 --> 02:08:47,840
No, no, no, no, no.

2753
02:08:47,840 --> 02:08:51,680
Loki is our, he's our Cullen.

2754
02:08:51,680 --> 02:08:52,680
Cullen?

2755
02:08:52,680 --> 02:08:53,680
Oh yeah.

2756
02:08:53,680 --> 02:08:55,080
He's our Cullen.

2757
02:08:55,080 --> 02:08:56,840
What does Cullen do?

2758
02:08:56,840 --> 02:08:59,080
He's the commander of the Inquisition's forces.

2759
02:08:59,080 --> 02:09:00,080
I see.

2760
02:09:00,080 --> 02:09:03,360
Do you really want to put him in charge of the actual army?

2761
02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:04,360
No.

2762
02:09:04,360 --> 02:09:06,200
Loki, what would you...

2763
02:09:06,200 --> 02:09:08,280
We could put a big hat on him.

2764
02:09:08,280 --> 02:09:09,720
Fair enough.

2765
02:09:09,720 --> 02:09:10,720
He's the Pope.

2766
02:09:10,720 --> 02:09:11,720
He's the Pope.

2767
02:09:11,720 --> 02:09:14,560
He's the Pope of the OL Army.

2768
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:15,560
He's the OL Army Pope.

2769
02:09:15,560 --> 02:09:16,560
He's the spiritual figurehead.

2770
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:17,560
No, no, no.

2771
02:09:17,560 --> 02:09:19,360
A big hat.

2772
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:20,360
He can be the admiral.

2773
02:09:20,360 --> 02:09:21,360
There you go.

2774
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:22,360
You're the admiral.

2775
02:09:22,360 --> 02:09:23,360
I like that.

2776
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:24,360
Admiral Loki.

2777
02:09:24,360 --> 02:09:27,120
Loki just has this look on his face of like, I don't know what the fuck you two are talking

2778
02:09:27,120 --> 02:09:28,120
about.

2779
02:09:28,120 --> 02:09:29,120
Exactly.

2780
02:09:29,120 --> 02:09:30,120
That's exactly what I was thinking.

2781
02:09:30,120 --> 02:09:33,560
Alright, then Loki, let's get back to some news because I know this first one.

2782
02:09:33,560 --> 02:09:35,400
You've got to have something to say about this, Loki.

2783
02:09:35,400 --> 02:09:36,720
I think it's pretty awesome.

2784
02:09:36,720 --> 02:09:41,800
I mean, they've had the rights sold already to Warner Brothers for Ready Player One for,

2785
02:09:42,040 --> 02:09:48,560
God, I don't even know how long now, but they have a director and I guess I could have picked

2786
02:09:48,560 --> 02:09:49,560
just anybody.

2787
02:09:49,560 --> 02:09:54,240
I mean, they've got this guy named Steven Spielberg, I mean, like, what's he done?

2788
02:09:54,240 --> 02:09:59,340
But he's going to be directing the movie, which hopefully will be coming out sooner

2789
02:09:59,340 --> 02:10:03,280
than it actually takes place in 2044.

2790
02:10:03,280 --> 02:10:05,440
But I am psyched for this movie when it comes out.

2791
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:09,840
I'm going to be psyched anyways, it's just a bunch of like, it's just an orgy of 80s

2792
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:10,840
stuff.

2793
02:10:10,880 --> 02:10:16,000
You have fucking mecha and shit fighting each other and it's like, how is this not going

2794
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,000
to be awesome?

2795
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:22,240
Of course my wife's like, I'm just reciting things and it's like, she complains about

2796
02:10:22,240 --> 02:10:23,240
the book all the time.

2797
02:10:23,240 --> 02:10:24,240
Have you read the book yet?

2798
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:28,080
I still have not read the book, but I'm glad to know there's a movie coming out so I don't

2799
02:10:28,080 --> 02:10:29,080
have to read.

2800
02:10:29,080 --> 02:10:30,080
Do you want to borrow the book?

2801
02:10:30,080 --> 02:10:31,080
Maybe.

2802
02:10:31,080 --> 02:10:32,080
You should read the book.

2803
02:10:32,080 --> 02:10:33,080
It's awesome.

2804
02:10:33,080 --> 02:10:34,080
It's just garbage, but it's, it's...

2805
02:10:34,080 --> 02:10:37,240
My partner has a Kindle that neither one of us ever use, so maybe I could get a digital,

2806
02:10:37,240 --> 02:10:39,080
I don't even know where the fucking Kindle is, but...

2807
02:10:39,320 --> 02:10:41,360
You have an iPad with a Kindle app.

2808
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:42,360
You don't need a digital version.

2809
02:10:42,360 --> 02:10:43,360
I have a hard...

2810
02:10:43,360 --> 02:10:48,160
Wait, how am I supposed to use paper?

2811
02:10:48,160 --> 02:10:49,160
A book?

2812
02:10:49,160 --> 02:10:50,160
What are we going to do with that?

2813
02:10:50,160 --> 02:10:53,160
Are they going to hold down another book?

2814
02:10:53,160 --> 02:10:54,160
It's a quick read.

2815
02:10:54,160 --> 02:10:55,160
All right.

2816
02:10:55,160 --> 02:10:57,160
They played Joust in it at one point.

2817
02:10:57,160 --> 02:11:00,640
Books are the things that Rob used to hold up his monitor.

2818
02:11:00,640 --> 02:11:02,320
But I don't know.

2819
02:11:02,320 --> 02:11:05,320
I'm very excited about it.

2820
02:11:05,320 --> 02:11:10,880
It should hopefully turn out better than, say, I don't know, Pixels or something.

2821
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:12,840
I am excited to see this.

2822
02:11:12,840 --> 02:11:17,920
Even though I don't always love Spielberg, I think some of his stuff is overrated, I

2823
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:23,600
think that's really cool that somebody of his caliber is attached to this.

2824
02:11:23,600 --> 02:11:29,080
And I know it's considered one of his worst movies, but I will always stick up for Hook.

2825
02:11:29,080 --> 02:11:30,080
I love that movie.

2826
02:11:30,080 --> 02:11:31,080
I'm sorry.

2827
02:11:31,080 --> 02:11:32,080
I love that movie as a kid.

2828
02:11:32,080 --> 02:11:33,560
It was so good.

2829
02:11:34,120 --> 02:11:36,600
You know that's considered one of his worst movies.

2830
02:11:36,600 --> 02:11:39,360
If that's his worst movie, then he can't do too bad.

2831
02:11:39,360 --> 02:11:41,360
I mean, that's not bad.

2832
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:45,760
I mean, damn, you've got a pretty entertaining movie as your worst movie.

2833
02:11:45,760 --> 02:11:48,520
Okay, well that's terrible of you, I guess.

2834
02:11:48,520 --> 02:11:49,520
All right.

2835
02:11:49,520 --> 02:11:55,220
Well, anyhow, from movies to television, and you're really into Ready Player One, I really

2836
02:11:55,220 --> 02:11:57,200
like this mobile phone game.

2837
02:11:57,200 --> 02:11:58,440
Maybe this should be the thing.

2838
02:11:58,480 --> 02:12:03,880
I will read Ready Player One when you sign up to play Ingress, which is a game that I've

2839
02:12:03,880 --> 02:12:04,880
talked about on this show.

2840
02:12:04,880 --> 02:12:07,000
Dude, my phone would not run that if I even...

2841
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:08,000
Oh, that's true.

2842
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,000
I'm guessing.

2843
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:10,000
It's a Samsung Galaxy S2.

2844
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,560
It hardly runs a fucking web page.

2845
02:12:12,560 --> 02:12:17,200
Yeah, I think Alan had a three, and it was pretty slow on that, so I don't know.

2846
02:12:17,200 --> 02:12:18,200
So, sorry.

2847
02:12:18,200 --> 02:12:19,200
That's all right.

2848
02:12:19,200 --> 02:12:20,200
I can't do that yet.

2849
02:12:20,200 --> 02:12:21,200
Maybe on the next one.

2850
02:12:21,200 --> 02:12:22,200
I can't play anything on this.

2851
02:12:22,200 --> 02:12:23,200
Maybe on the next one.

2852
02:12:23,200 --> 02:12:25,760
But anyway, Ingress apparently going to be coming to television.

2853
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:32,680
Now, of course, I've talked about this game on the show before, but it gets you out and

2854
02:12:32,680 --> 02:12:35,280
going around to places of public interest to capture...

2855
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:38,520
Imagine if Foursquare met Capture the Flag.

2856
02:12:38,520 --> 02:12:42,920
That's kind of what Ingress is, is you battle out in these factions to then capture these

2857
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:45,920
nodes and connect them to create control fields.

2858
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:46,920
And so that's what Ingress is all about.

2859
02:12:46,920 --> 02:12:54,600
But of course, there's this whole YouTube and a viral alternate augmented reality game

2860
02:12:54,600 --> 02:12:57,040
type of stuff that goes on behind it.

2861
02:12:57,040 --> 02:13:00,020
There's an actual reporter that goes out to all these events.

2862
02:13:00,020 --> 02:13:04,660
Some of the local folks I know that play here in Sacramento all went down to Pasadena this

2863
02:13:04,660 --> 02:13:10,200
weekend for what they call an anomaly, which is just basically a big event where it actually

2864
02:13:10,200 --> 02:13:11,800
drives the game's lore.

2865
02:13:11,800 --> 02:13:15,600
So one of these events, when people go to it, is it just a bunch of people on their

2866
02:13:15,600 --> 02:13:16,600
phones going...

2867
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:17,600
Yes!

2868
02:13:17,600 --> 02:13:18,600
It's so stupid.

2869
02:13:18,600 --> 02:13:24,560
If you're watching this, it happened in Sacramento and it's thousands of people on the street

2870
02:13:24,560 --> 02:13:25,800
all staring at their phones.

2871
02:13:25,800 --> 02:13:29,000
It looks like some frickin' flash mob hit where people can't be bothered to pay attention.

2872
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:33,400
Or just regular life with people on the street with their phones.

2873
02:13:33,400 --> 02:13:35,440
It's like no one actually understands their...

2874
02:13:35,440 --> 02:13:36,440
What?

2875
02:13:36,440 --> 02:13:37,440
There's an anomaly going on?

2876
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:38,440
I was just playing on my phone.

2877
02:13:38,440 --> 02:13:41,800
Now little did you know, they're all sitting there going, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew,

2878
02:13:41,800 --> 02:13:42,800
pew, pew, pew.

2879
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:45,280
Yes, it doesn't make it any less stupid.

2880
02:13:45,280 --> 02:13:46,280
No.

2881
02:13:46,280 --> 02:13:48,560
Ah, you're such an asshole.

2882
02:13:48,560 --> 02:13:51,480
Anyway, now more people can learn about it because apparently...

2883
02:13:51,480 --> 02:13:56,080
At least they're not running around pretending their guns and stuff and going pew, pew, pew,

2884
02:13:56,080 --> 02:14:00,360
and hiding behind bushes and shit like that.

2885
02:14:00,360 --> 02:14:03,560
Anyway, Google Niantic apparently working with Sean...

2886
02:14:03,560 --> 02:14:04,840
Do they have costumes?

2887
02:14:04,840 --> 02:14:07,120
Do you wear costumes to these events?

2888
02:14:07,120 --> 02:14:12,840
Well, because the factions are blue and green, people will wear blue and green.

2889
02:14:12,840 --> 02:14:15,240
Some people will wear the green wigs.

2890
02:14:15,240 --> 02:14:18,720
So they're gonna think it's a gang war going on.

2891
02:14:19,240 --> 02:14:21,520
Yes, somebody's gonna think it's a gang war.

2892
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:23,880
But they're all staring at their phones.

2893
02:14:23,880 --> 02:14:25,400
I'm glad to be coming after you, man.

2894
02:14:25,400 --> 02:14:26,400
Alright, shut up.

2895
02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:30,920
Anyway, Google Niantic Labs, who created the game, working with Sean Daniel Company.

2896
02:14:30,920 --> 02:14:35,320
This is the production company responsible for the Mummy film franchise and The Expanse,

2897
02:14:35,320 --> 02:14:36,880
which is coming to Syfy.

2898
02:14:36,880 --> 02:14:38,840
Nothing pitched to networks yet.

2899
02:14:38,840 --> 02:14:40,680
No showrunner attached.

2900
02:14:40,680 --> 02:14:43,040
So this is still very early on in development.

2901
02:14:43,040 --> 02:14:47,960
Some folks thinking that this might actually not be about Ingress, but Niantic working

2902
02:14:47,960 --> 02:14:52,280
on a follow-up of sorts, which is also going to be taking place.

2903
02:14:52,280 --> 02:14:56,560
So this could be that the TV agreement's actually for what's to come next.

2904
02:14:56,560 --> 02:15:00,400
And what cracks me up is that, and I forget the name of it, maybe somebody in chat remembers

2905
02:15:00,400 --> 02:15:08,440
it, but Niantic's working with author James Frey to create the book that will kind of

2906
02:15:08,440 --> 02:15:09,440
be part of the lore.

2907
02:15:09,440 --> 02:15:12,680
Well, if you don't recognize that name, do you know who James Frey was?

2908
02:15:12,680 --> 02:15:17,920
He's the guy that got read to filth by Oprah because he lied on the show about his memoir.

2909
02:15:17,920 --> 02:15:21,360
Remember that whole thing, the million broken pieces or whatever it was called?

2910
02:15:21,360 --> 02:15:25,760
He fricking lied, I guess, about the experiences or embellished a lot and Oprah had them on

2911
02:15:25,760 --> 02:15:31,280
the show and like, you don't ever see Oprah get mad, but when she gets mad, heaven help

2912
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:32,280
you.

2913
02:15:32,280 --> 02:15:33,280
Right?

2914
02:15:33,280 --> 02:15:34,280
So that was that guy.

2915
02:15:34,280 --> 02:15:37,280
And I'm like, wow, he's back and he's going to write Game War.

2916
02:15:37,280 --> 02:15:38,760
Apparently he's good at fabrication.

2917
02:15:38,760 --> 02:15:39,760
Right?

2918
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:45,120
Why not the guy's good at lying and making stories up.

2919
02:15:45,120 --> 02:15:46,120
Oh Lord.

2920
02:15:46,120 --> 02:15:47,120
All right.

2921
02:15:47,120 --> 02:15:48,120
Anyway.

2922
02:15:48,120 --> 02:15:49,120
Uh, let's move on.

2923
02:15:49,120 --> 02:15:50,120
Dark Sakura.

2924
02:15:50,120 --> 02:15:57,800
Well, um, there is a UK, uh, charity event that went on.

2925
02:15:57,800 --> 02:16:02,440
It was run by, uh, a group called, uh, special effect.

2926
02:16:02,440 --> 02:16:09,120
They had a charity, uh, event called game blast that they managed to pull in over 120,000

2927
02:16:09,160 --> 02:16:15,240
pounds in donations and they surpassed last year's goal by 50,000 pounds.

2928
02:16:15,240 --> 02:16:21,400
So, uh, they, uh, basically have, uh, just been pulling this in, trying to help, you

2929
02:16:21,400 --> 02:16:23,640
know, poor kids that need the help.

2930
02:16:23,640 --> 02:16:26,800
Um, their donation page is still up and active.

2931
02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:33,800
Uh, the, uh, next game blast is going to be tentatively February 26th through 28th, 2016.

2932
02:16:33,800 --> 02:16:37,640
And you can go to their donation page at just giving.com.

2933
02:16:40,120 --> 02:16:41,120
Awesome.

2934
02:16:41,120 --> 02:16:42,120
Yep.

2935
02:16:42,120 --> 02:16:43,120
I like it.

2936
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:44,120
We like people doing nice stuff.

2937
02:16:44,120 --> 02:16:45,120
That's right.

2938
02:16:45,120 --> 02:16:50,000
It's nice to hear about gamers doing good as opposed to, you know, gang warfare created

2939
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:51,000
by video games.

2940
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:52,200
Don't be a Dick.

2941
02:16:52,200 --> 02:16:53,200
That's right.

2942
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:56,200
Uh, moving on Loki.

2943
02:16:56,200 --> 02:16:59,000
Hey, I don't know.

2944
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:04,280
I can't believe they're using that author quote unquote to, uh, make the storyline for

2945
02:17:04,280 --> 02:17:05,280
this thing.

2946
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:06,280
I can't remember that.

2947
02:17:06,280 --> 02:17:07,280
Does he actually write anything?

2948
02:17:07,440 --> 02:17:12,480
I mean that he hasn't, you know, plagiarized, uh, I will do what anyone would do in this

2949
02:17:12,480 --> 02:17:18,860
situation and I'm going to look it up on Wikipedia right now and try to find out, um, what else

2950
02:17:18,860 --> 02:17:21,280
that he's written since then.

2951
02:17:21,280 --> 02:17:28,480
Um, he has a young adult novel publishing company, uh, that was trying to gracely create

2952
02:17:28,480 --> 02:17:29,480
Twilight knockoffs.

2953
02:17:29,480 --> 02:17:31,320
It sounds like, wow.

2954
02:17:31,320 --> 02:17:32,320
So there you go.

2955
02:17:32,320 --> 02:17:33,320
All right.

2956
02:17:33,320 --> 02:17:35,360
And game is the name of the game I was trying to think of.

2957
02:17:35,440 --> 02:17:36,440
End game.

2958
02:17:36,440 --> 02:17:37,440
End game.

2959
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:38,440
End game.

2960
02:17:38,440 --> 02:17:39,440
Okay.

2961
02:17:39,440 --> 02:17:44,400
Anyways, um, so remember that cool rumor that we had that Netflix was going to be getting

2962
02:17:44,400 --> 02:17:47,440
some Zelda series or something?

2963
02:17:47,440 --> 02:17:53,960
Yeah, that's unfortunately not, not going to happen.

2964
02:17:53,960 --> 02:18:01,360
Nintendo basically said, Hey, that, uh, talk of the show is not based on correct information.

2965
02:18:01,360 --> 02:18:03,360
There's nothing new to share.

2966
02:18:03,360 --> 02:18:04,360
Sorry.

2967
02:18:05,360 --> 02:18:06,360
That was all the show.

2968
02:18:06,360 --> 02:18:12,120
Well, to be fair and maybe a little tinfoil haddish, Nintendo could be lying.

2969
02:18:12,120 --> 02:18:14,360
It wouldn't be the first time they've done it.

2970
02:18:14,360 --> 02:18:15,360
Right.

2971
02:18:18,360 --> 02:18:25,860
Um, I mean, you're opening up to, you're opening me up to like so many jokes, but yes, I won't

2972
02:18:25,860 --> 02:18:26,860
take those.

2973
02:18:26,860 --> 02:18:32,240
Um, I, yeah, I guess they could be lying, but it's kind of stupid.

2974
02:18:33,120 --> 02:18:35,120
Like, ha, we're not going to talk about it.

2975
02:18:35,120 --> 02:18:38,120
And we're never going to talk about it.

2976
02:18:38,120 --> 02:18:39,120
All right.

2977
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:43,160
Uh, looking at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, Tigerclaw wants to know why did it take Nintendo

2978
02:18:43,160 --> 02:18:45,120
this long to respond to it?

2979
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:49,120
You know, I'm getting this weird feeling that nobody asked.

2980
02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:54,760
I mean, granted, they probably contacted the Nintendo PR department or whatever and got

2981
02:18:54,760 --> 02:18:59,040
the whole line of we don't comment on rumors or speculation, but this was the first time

2982
02:18:59,040 --> 02:19:02,920
that, you know, it was a wata that put the kibosh on this, right?

2983
02:19:02,920 --> 02:19:06,520
That somebody sat him down and asked him point blank.

2984
02:19:06,520 --> 02:19:07,640
So what about this rumor?

2985
02:19:07,640 --> 02:19:12,400
So I think that's part of the reason why it took this long to hear about it is it took

2986
02:19:12,400 --> 02:19:16,740
this long for somebody to ask him point blank in a situation where he couldn't necessarily

2987
02:19:16,740 --> 02:19:18,640
PR speak his way out of it.

2988
02:19:18,640 --> 02:19:20,640
So we'll see.

2989
02:19:20,640 --> 02:19:26,760
Uh, yeah, and SSG100 Matt says, uh, they're not going to talk about it until E3.

2990
02:19:26,760 --> 02:19:30,400
Dungeon Buster says not correct isn't really a flat out denial.

2991
02:19:30,400 --> 02:19:37,240
So we'll see anyhow, moving on to Minecraft, which still gets a lot of press even to this

2992
02:19:37,240 --> 02:19:38,240
day.

2993
02:19:38,240 --> 02:19:43,200
And, uh, this is, I find this story fascinating because what's happening with Minecraft, they're

2994
02:19:43,200 --> 02:19:48,880
going to be giving it for free in every Northern Ireland secondary school.

2995
02:19:48,880 --> 02:19:54,440
Uh, this is, uh, Culture Tech, which is a festival of technology and creative industries.

2996
02:19:54,440 --> 02:19:58,880
They've gotten funding from the department of culture, arts and leisure to supply 200

2997
02:19:58,880 --> 02:20:01,280
schools with download codes.

2998
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:05,240
Each license is for a version of the game called Minecraft edu.

2999
02:20:05,240 --> 02:20:09,280
I didn't even know this was a thing, but you can look it up at Minecraft edu.com and it's

3000
02:20:09,280 --> 02:20:12,120
designed specifically for the classroom.

3001
02:20:12,120 --> 02:20:16,880
So this is going to be distributed thanks to this funding across all of Northern Ireland.

3002
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:21,360
And I couldn't help but think about, you know, when I'm reading about this, I'm like, geez,

3003
02:20:21,360 --> 02:20:25,960
when I grew up, we were playing Oregon trail and number munchers, and now kids today they're

3004
02:20:25,960 --> 02:20:28,600
playing Minecraft in school.

3005
02:20:28,600 --> 02:20:29,960
That's kind of neat.

3006
02:20:29,960 --> 02:20:30,960
I love that idea.

3007
02:20:30,960 --> 02:20:31,960
I mean, I don't know.

3008
02:20:31,960 --> 02:20:37,640
I mean, I guess Minecraft certainly teaches them design and it's art and you know, that

3009
02:20:37,640 --> 02:20:38,640
all of that.

3010
02:20:38,640 --> 02:20:44,080
But, uh, you know, it's not, I guess it's in your face as eat all the multiples of three

3011
02:20:44,080 --> 02:20:45,680
or get eaten by a traggle.

3012
02:20:45,680 --> 02:20:50,860
You know, it's not quite as in your face as that, but I think that's pretty awesome.

3013
02:20:50,860 --> 02:20:54,500
So who knew that Netflix was what the kids were playing in schools these days?

3014
02:20:54,500 --> 02:20:55,500
I should Minecraft.

3015
02:20:55,500 --> 02:20:57,180
You mean what'd I say?

3016
02:20:57,180 --> 02:20:58,180
Netflix.

3017
02:20:58,180 --> 02:20:59,180
Oh, Rob.

3018
02:20:59,180 --> 02:21:01,940
I was looking at another story.

3019
02:21:01,940 --> 02:21:02,940
Minecraft.

3020
02:21:02,940 --> 02:21:08,320
Well, you know, one kid's got Minecraft open and the other kid buying them as Netflix open

3021
02:21:08,320 --> 02:21:09,320
or something.

3022
02:21:09,320 --> 02:21:10,320
That's what they do.

3023
02:21:10,320 --> 02:21:11,320
Anyway.

3024
02:21:11,320 --> 02:21:12,320
Uh, let's move on.

3025
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:13,660
We're going to go to our mailbag every week.

3026
02:21:13,660 --> 02:21:17,860
You guys send us emails to participate at orange lounge radio.com, which is our email

3027
02:21:17,860 --> 02:21:24,080
address and dark Sakura dives into the mailbag and find some emails that she deems worthy

3028
02:21:24,080 --> 02:21:26,220
of reading on the program.

3029
02:21:26,220 --> 02:21:27,220
Dark Sakura.

3030
02:21:27,220 --> 02:21:29,300
How many do we have in the mailbag tonight?

3031
02:21:29,300 --> 02:21:30,300
Four four.

3032
02:21:30,300 --> 02:21:32,620
There was only one and I looked in there earlier.

3033
02:21:32,620 --> 02:21:33,620
Holy crap.

3034
02:21:33,620 --> 02:21:34,620
Four emails tonight.

3035
02:21:34,620 --> 02:21:35,620
All right.

3036
02:21:35,620 --> 02:21:36,620
Yes.

3037
02:21:36,620 --> 02:21:37,620
What's up orange lounge.

3038
02:21:37,620 --> 02:21:39,260
I'm sure you guys have noticed this trend.

3039
02:21:39,260 --> 02:21:40,700
Indiana Jones was brought back.

3040
02:21:40,700 --> 02:21:42,660
Pirates of the Caribbean is getting a fifth movie.

3041
02:21:42,660 --> 02:21:43,860
The Marvel movies keep coming.

3042
02:21:43,860 --> 02:21:46,240
The Hobbit was built from a book.

3043
02:21:46,240 --> 02:21:50,640
Uncharted for a new mass effect, new gears of war, more halo to become to stop hiring

3044
02:21:50,640 --> 02:21:52,400
good writers.

3045
02:21:52,400 --> 02:21:56,760
Do people stop going to school for writing and instead we have too many CG animators.

3046
02:21:56,760 --> 02:21:57,760
I'm confused.

3047
02:21:57,760 --> 02:22:01,960
The entertainment industry for mainly movies and games has literally been flooded with

3048
02:22:01,960 --> 02:22:03,680
prequel sequels, remakes.

3049
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:05,040
What happened to creativity?

3050
02:22:05,040 --> 02:22:08,760
I'm going to stop and say there's nothing wrong with any mass effect game.

3051
02:22:08,760 --> 02:22:10,120
Okay.

3052
02:22:10,120 --> 02:22:12,360
I thought you guys might, you need to watch your step.

3053
02:22:12,360 --> 02:22:15,160
You need to watch it.

3054
02:22:15,160 --> 02:22:18,920
I thought you guys might enjoy this topic since lately so many of our AAA games are

3055
02:22:18,920 --> 02:22:22,480
broken, a remake or just another chapter in an already established IP.

3056
02:22:22,480 --> 02:22:23,600
Where did originality go?

3057
02:22:23,600 --> 02:22:25,840
Is indie all we have left for creative genius?

3058
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:27,880
All the best is easy.

3059
02:22:27,880 --> 02:22:34,020
For the record, I see, I actually kind of see nothing wrong with having different stories

3060
02:22:34,020 --> 02:22:37,320
that we've come to love expanded on.

3061
02:22:37,320 --> 02:22:39,520
I don't want to see mass effect go away.

3062
02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:40,520
I'd like to see more.

3063
02:22:40,520 --> 02:22:45,760
I don't want it to end up, you know, getting Lucas sized, you know, like star Wars did.

3064
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:50,760
Well it's funny you make that reference because I would honestly say to the emailer, it's

3065
02:22:50,760 --> 02:22:55,640
nothing really different from other forms of entertainment, specifically movies.

3066
02:22:55,640 --> 02:22:57,520
Don't movies have the same problem?

3067
02:22:57,520 --> 02:23:00,960
We just talked earlier in the show, they remade Arthur of all fricking movies.

3068
02:23:00,960 --> 02:23:04,000
I think that's what he was pointing out though when he mentioned all the Marvel movies and

3069
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:05,000
stuff.

3070
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:06,000
I guess that's true.

3071
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:12,280
And keep in mind, the Marvel movies are part of a larger story, right?

3072
02:23:12,280 --> 02:23:15,600
It's like how many different issues of the comic books do we buy?

3073
02:23:15,600 --> 02:23:19,320
If you really want to, you know, see what's going on in the Marvel universe, they're making

3074
02:23:19,320 --> 02:23:22,640
a Deadpool movie and it looks awesome.

3075
02:23:22,640 --> 02:23:23,800
Did you see that costume picture?

3076
02:23:23,800 --> 02:23:24,880
Oh, that was the best.

3077
02:23:24,880 --> 02:23:28,560
I love and dark to see a point of this or somebody, no, somebody, no, it wasn't hard

3078
02:23:28,560 --> 02:23:29,560
to see it.

3079
02:23:29,560 --> 02:23:30,560
Sorry.

3080
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:31,560
I missed tribute to some of you.

3081
02:23:31,560 --> 02:23:35,360
It was saying my buddy sake that did this on Twitter actually pointed out that Deadpool

3082
02:23:35,360 --> 02:23:37,960
on Twitter only follows Hello Kitty.

3083
02:23:37,960 --> 02:23:38,960
And that's it.

3084
02:23:38,960 --> 02:23:40,920
And he's like, how perfect is that?

3085
02:23:40,920 --> 02:23:42,040
That's amazing.

3086
02:23:42,040 --> 02:23:43,040
You know what though?

3087
02:23:43,040 --> 02:23:47,960
I thought I'd bet anything if I made a B Arthur account, it'd get followed.

3088
02:23:47,960 --> 02:23:48,960
Here you go.

3089
02:23:48,960 --> 02:23:49,960
I might have to do that.

3090
02:23:49,960 --> 02:23:50,960
Here you go.

3091
02:23:50,960 --> 02:23:54,040
Um, I'm going to do, I'm going to do RIP B Arthur.

3092
02:23:54,040 --> 02:23:58,840
But I do want us to actually, I knew a podcaster around here called spanking B Arthur.

3093
02:23:58,840 --> 02:24:04,080
So that's, that's the thing, but anyway, um, let me point out, uh, the whole, uh, again,

3094
02:24:04,080 --> 02:24:09,760
the whole ideas and everything, I really think that we're seeing in games really nothing

3095
02:24:09,760 --> 02:24:13,800
different from what you see in movies or even in books, you know?

3096
02:24:13,800 --> 02:24:17,440
And I wouldn't even say Indy's going to be a way to get around that because all you have,

3097
02:24:17,440 --> 02:24:22,400
a lot of indie guys are making games that are spiritual successors to things, you know,

3098
02:24:22,400 --> 02:24:26,320
it's like, well, we can't license the rights to make a sequel to this game, but we're going

3099
02:24:26,320 --> 02:24:28,080
to make one that's very similar to that.

3100
02:24:28,080 --> 02:24:29,080
Yeah.

3101
02:24:29,080 --> 02:24:33,600
So I don't know, but there's, there's original stuff and who cares sometimes going back to

3102
02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:35,520
like a franchise is pretty awesome.

3103
02:24:35,520 --> 02:24:38,320
Like, look, they rebooted Tomb Raider for like the eighth time.

3104
02:24:38,320 --> 02:24:40,880
So, and I, this time it was actually good.

3105
02:24:40,880 --> 02:24:46,920
I see a lot of indie games kind of saying like, we're really inspired by Metroidvania

3106
02:24:46,920 --> 02:24:48,980
and I don't see that as a bad thing whatsoever.

3107
02:24:48,980 --> 02:24:51,400
And I don't say, Oh, this means the Indies are running out of ideas.

3108
02:24:51,400 --> 02:24:54,580
I think this just says, Hey, the Indies are taking something they love and putting their

3109
02:24:54,580 --> 02:24:55,600
own spin on it.

3110
02:24:55,600 --> 02:25:00,480
So you know, I wonder if we'll ever see a metric cross Castlevania game.

3111
02:25:00,480 --> 02:25:01,480
Yeah.

3112
02:25:01,480 --> 02:25:09,240
I just want to see a game called Metroidvania, Samus finds herself in a haunted castle from

3113
02:25:09,240 --> 02:25:10,240
years ago.

3114
02:25:10,240 --> 02:25:11,240
Anyway.

3115
02:25:11,240 --> 02:25:12,240
Yeah.

3116
02:25:12,240 --> 02:25:16,480
I seriously, if I was going to sit down and do an indie game, I would totally do something

3117
02:25:16,480 --> 02:25:18,360
in the style of the guardian legend.

3118
02:25:18,360 --> 02:25:19,520
Awesome.

3119
02:25:19,520 --> 02:25:21,080
I need people to help me make this happen.

3120
02:25:21,080 --> 02:25:25,160
I'm telling you though, don't, don't, don't make the mistake I've made for this long.

3121
02:25:25,160 --> 02:25:28,440
Flacco said you need to check out velocity and I finally did and I was like, he was right.

3122
02:25:28,440 --> 02:25:29,440
I do.

3123
02:25:29,440 --> 02:25:30,440
I'm going to check that out.

3124
02:25:30,440 --> 02:25:31,440
Anyway.

3125
02:25:31,440 --> 02:25:32,440
Next email.

3126
02:25:32,440 --> 02:25:33,440
Yes.

3127
02:25:33,440 --> 02:25:34,440
Uh, greetings.

3128
02:25:34,440 --> 02:25:35,440
OLR.

3129
02:25:35,440 --> 02:25:36,440
It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.

3130
02:25:36,440 --> 02:25:37,440
Serious turtle.

3131
02:25:37,440 --> 02:25:39,560
Rob, based on what you've been playing every week for some time now, I picked up reaper

3132
02:25:39,560 --> 02:25:40,560
of souls on sale.

3133
02:25:40,560 --> 02:25:44,560
I'm loving it and I'm definitely having a lonely turtle in need of friends.

3134
02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:49,640
Does OLR, does OLR or VOG have a clan or anything that I can join?

3135
02:25:49,640 --> 02:25:53,080
I'd love to play with members of the show or VOG community.

3136
02:25:53,080 --> 02:25:54,080
Nope.

3137
02:25:54,080 --> 02:25:58,600
Um, then, uh, no actually, horde house has one.

3138
02:25:58,600 --> 02:25:59,820
So I've got that.

3139
02:25:59,820 --> 02:26:03,320
So if you want to join the horde house, my other show, horde house, if you want to join

3140
02:26:03,320 --> 02:26:07,680
the horde house hotties, uh, we, I'm going to, I forgot to do it after the show this

3141
02:26:07,680 --> 02:26:09,920
week cause I still need to post to horde house.

3142
02:26:09,920 --> 02:26:10,920
I'm way behind.

3143
02:26:10,920 --> 02:26:14,960
Um, but, uh, on the forums I'll post more information, including battle tags of who

3144
02:26:14,960 --> 02:26:17,880
you can contact if you want to join the horde house hotties.

3145
02:26:17,880 --> 02:26:19,360
So we do have that.

3146
02:26:19,360 --> 02:26:22,880
And then, uh, he said, sends me condolences about grandma.

3147
02:26:22,880 --> 02:26:23,880
So thank you.

3148
02:26:23,880 --> 02:26:27,320
Um, Loki finish your game already so I can play it.

3149
02:26:27,320 --> 02:26:30,760
I'm looking forward to what you've come up with and I hope you're smart enough to sell

3150
02:26:30,760 --> 02:26:33,080
an amiibo for the game, especially separately.

3151
02:26:33,080 --> 02:26:34,080
Of course.

3152
02:26:34,080 --> 02:26:35,080
Of course.

3153
02:26:35,080 --> 02:26:36,920
And it won't do anything like regular amiibos.

3154
02:26:36,920 --> 02:26:37,920
Stop it.

3155
02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:41,200
I'll say it like I do in every email your show gets me through my Mondays, your loyal

3156
02:26:41,200 --> 02:26:42,200
turtle in Philly.

3157
02:26:42,200 --> 02:26:43,200
Serious turtle.

3158
02:26:43,200 --> 02:26:44,200
Thank you.

3159
02:26:44,200 --> 02:26:45,960
That, that means a lot that we can help you out with your Monday.

3160
02:26:45,960 --> 02:26:46,960
Really appreciate that.

3161
02:26:46,960 --> 02:26:48,960
I'm pulling up the next one.

3162
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:49,960
Sure.

3163
02:26:49,960 --> 02:26:50,960
Sorry.

3164
02:26:50,960 --> 02:26:51,960
My voice is going out.

3165
02:26:51,960 --> 02:26:52,960
That's all right.

3166
02:26:52,960 --> 02:26:53,960
Look.

3167
02:26:53,960 --> 02:26:54,960
Oh, sorry.

3168
02:26:54,960 --> 02:26:55,960
I was going to read some comments in chat to help do the time here.

3169
02:26:55,960 --> 02:27:00,160
Uh, bonds, double a six saying I want a new, I've never ending story movie.

3170
02:27:00,160 --> 02:27:01,160
Mm hmm.

3171
02:27:01,160 --> 02:27:05,120
Uh, Bobby black will says, I hear there's a Hobbit remake coming soon and then a hunger

3172
02:27:05,120 --> 02:27:06,120
games remake.

3173
02:27:06,120 --> 02:27:07,120
Oh, who knows?

3174
02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:08,120
Who knows?

3175
02:27:08,120 --> 02:27:09,640
Uh, probably just a matter of time.

3176
02:27:09,640 --> 02:27:13,760
Black will says a never ending story remake with only females.

3177
02:27:13,760 --> 02:27:14,760
You never know.

3178
02:27:14,760 --> 02:27:20,120
Uh, if it's SGA 100, Matt says a mean girls remake with guys, uh, and you know, bonds

3179
02:27:20,120 --> 02:27:23,760
double a six says still, unless all the guys are gay.

3180
02:27:23,760 --> 02:27:26,680
That's actually on YouTube.

3181
02:27:26,680 --> 02:27:27,680
It's mean gays.

3182
02:27:27,680 --> 02:27:28,680
Look it up on YouTube.

3183
02:27:28,680 --> 02:27:29,680
Okay.

3184
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:31,800
But I'd rather it be called bitchy boys.

3185
02:27:31,800 --> 02:27:36,880
Uh, and bonds double a six says still no unit racers meet remake.

3186
02:27:36,880 --> 02:27:41,080
Maybe that could be the game Nintendo announces to save the Wii U this holiday.

3187
02:27:41,080 --> 02:27:43,560
Uniracers you can I read the next email?

3188
02:27:43,560 --> 02:27:44,560
All right.

3189
02:27:44,560 --> 02:27:46,440
I think they're going to try to see peoples.

3190
02:27:46,440 --> 02:27:52,920
Um, and then the article about the final fantasy 15 director saying about the all male cast.

3191
02:27:53,080 --> 02:27:56,600
Um, at this point in the show, you probably covered the comments by final fantasy five

3192
02:27:56,600 --> 02:28:03,120
director Hajime Tabata about making the cast and final fantasy 15 all male to make the

3193
02:28:03,120 --> 02:28:04,560
game more approachable quotes.

3194
02:28:04,560 --> 02:28:05,840
No, we haven't.

3195
02:28:05,840 --> 02:28:10,960
I thought I would add in my thoughts because honestly it's bullshit.

3196
02:28:10,960 --> 02:28:13,200
And funny enough, it's not on our show tonight.

3197
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:15,200
So here's our opportunity to bring it up.

3198
02:28:15,200 --> 02:28:20,140
Why, why couldn't he just say the decision to go the all male cast was part of the plot.

3199
02:28:20,140 --> 02:28:24,100
People who are aware that the final fantasy series of games are plot driven would have

3200
02:28:24,100 --> 02:28:26,260
bought that as an excuse, at least for a little while.

3201
02:28:26,260 --> 02:28:30,660
And some people are either of two different conclusions about this move.

3202
02:28:30,660 --> 02:28:36,620
One, this move is driven by a misinterpretation of the market for these games to squirt index

3203
02:28:36,620 --> 02:28:41,340
has joined Spanky and Alfalfa in the He-Man Woman Haters Club.

3204
02:28:41,340 --> 02:28:46,860
Stay care entertainment trainer sent from my iPad, which was in the email.

3205
02:28:46,860 --> 02:28:47,860
I know.

3206
02:28:47,860 --> 02:28:48,860
I know.

3207
02:28:48,860 --> 02:28:55,820
I, I get, I, I, it's not so much the fact that the story is about four guys that bothers

3208
02:28:55,820 --> 02:28:56,820
me.

3209
02:28:56,820 --> 02:29:01,700
Cause you know, I've seen enough movie, stand by me, stand by me is about four guys.

3210
02:29:01,700 --> 02:29:02,700
Right.

3211
02:29:02,700 --> 02:29:04,620
And that's just part of the story and the plot device.

3212
02:29:04,620 --> 02:29:08,540
But at the same time, I do understand you have this separate conversation about, you

3213
02:29:08,540 --> 02:29:10,260
know, diversity and games and dah, dah, dah.

3214
02:29:10,260 --> 02:29:11,260
And I get that.

3215
02:29:11,260 --> 02:29:17,260
And y'all know I'm for that, but I, do you want to elaborate on your thoughts real quick

3216
02:29:17,260 --> 02:29:18,260
here?

3217
02:29:18,260 --> 02:29:19,340
Who cares about diversity in games?

3218
02:29:19,340 --> 02:29:20,340
I do.

3219
02:29:20,340 --> 02:29:21,340
Yeah.

3220
02:29:21,340 --> 02:29:24,340
Who cares about there being four guys in this game that are the leads in the game.

3221
02:29:24,340 --> 02:29:26,380
This is what they decided that they want to do with it.

3222
02:29:26,380 --> 02:29:27,380
That's it.

3223
02:29:27,380 --> 02:29:28,380
If you don't like the game, don't play it.

3224
02:29:28,380 --> 02:29:33,780
I understand why should there be fucking females and males in every single goddamn game.

3225
02:29:33,780 --> 02:29:35,360
You can have all female cast.

3226
02:29:35,360 --> 02:29:36,500
You can have all male cast.

3227
02:29:36,500 --> 02:29:38,180
You can have a mix of both.

3228
02:29:38,180 --> 02:29:39,180
You can have cats and dogs.

3229
02:29:39,180 --> 02:29:40,660
Who gives a shit?

3230
02:29:40,660 --> 02:29:42,180
Here's here's what it boils down to.

3231
02:29:42,180 --> 02:29:43,420
Here's what it boils down to.

3232
02:29:43,420 --> 02:29:48,940
I'm fine with them wanting to do the game about four, four bros or whatever, you know,

3233
02:29:48,940 --> 02:29:55,180
and I'm sure there'll be supporting characters, but here's the thing is that clearly the industry

3234
02:29:55,180 --> 02:29:57,820
as a whole has an issue.

3235
02:29:57,820 --> 02:30:04,620
And I think if Square Enix can show that they can address the bigger issue, then fine.

3236
02:30:04,620 --> 02:30:07,500
They can make whatever these games are that they want to make, but the industry as a whole

3237
02:30:07,500 --> 02:30:09,540
kind of has to answer for the other issue.

3238
02:30:10,540 --> 02:30:15,740
This is literally like the only Final Fantasy game that they've had that's had all males

3239
02:30:15,740 --> 02:30:18,500
as like the party in the game.

3240
02:30:18,500 --> 02:30:21,820
Everything else has been like diversified, if you want to put it that way.

3241
02:30:21,820 --> 02:30:26,440
I mean, we've had fucking Yetis in there and stuff, but who cares?

3242
02:30:26,440 --> 02:30:27,440
That's what I'm saying.

3243
02:30:27,440 --> 02:30:28,440
Who gives a shit?

3244
02:30:28,440 --> 02:30:30,380
I mean, your rest of your games are all like that.

3245
02:30:30,380 --> 02:30:32,620
They want to make a game that has all guys in it.

3246
02:30:32,620 --> 02:30:33,620
Then fine.

3247
02:30:33,620 --> 02:30:37,780
They had a game already that had a female lead and she was the only playable character.

3248
02:30:37,780 --> 02:30:40,120
I think that's fucking even enough.

3249
02:30:40,120 --> 02:30:42,300
Why does it have to be like, oh, well, we don't like that?

3250
02:30:42,300 --> 02:30:43,780
Well, too bad you don't like it.

3251
02:30:43,780 --> 02:30:44,780
Don't play it.

3252
02:30:44,780 --> 02:30:45,780
I don't like sports games.

3253
02:30:45,780 --> 02:30:48,580
I'm not saying stop making sports games.

3254
02:30:48,580 --> 02:30:49,580
That's my thing.

3255
02:30:49,580 --> 02:30:50,580
It's like, who gives a shit?

3256
02:30:50,580 --> 02:30:54,300
It's their story that they want to tell if they feel that it needs four male characters

3257
02:30:54,300 --> 02:30:57,300
in the lead roles, then that's fine.

3258
02:30:57,300 --> 02:31:01,260
Once again, because of our industry and because it's diversified, we have a lot of people

3259
02:31:01,260 --> 02:31:07,700
out there creating games that have a bunch of different mixes of groups, race, gender,

3260
02:31:07,700 --> 02:31:12,500
you know, sexual orientation, species in their games.

3261
02:31:12,500 --> 02:31:16,980
I don't understand why we have to force other games to kind of go by that.

3262
02:31:16,980 --> 02:31:20,100
I mean, it's not like Final Fantasy is all male, all of your games.

3263
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:25,400
For the record, we only have one confirmed asexual character in any game ever that actually

3264
02:31:25,400 --> 02:31:27,940
is flesh and blood, just saying.

3265
02:31:27,940 --> 02:31:32,220
Maya from Borderlands 2.

3266
02:31:32,220 --> 02:31:36,660
So I, again, I think we have to kind of, I don't think it's so much about the decision

3267
02:31:36,660 --> 02:31:41,300
to put the four, again, there's plenty of movies out there that do it too, but it's

3268
02:31:41,300 --> 02:31:47,940
about can the games industry as a whole show that level of maturity that the movies industry

3269
02:31:47,940 --> 02:31:48,940
had to show?

3270
02:31:48,940 --> 02:31:51,420
I just, I don't know.

3271
02:31:51,420 --> 02:31:58,460
I think the problem is much larger than one game, and you know, to Loki's credit, Square

3272
02:31:58,460 --> 02:32:04,740
Enix has brought us an amazing female protagonist in the form of Lara Croft, so in the Square

3273
02:32:04,740 --> 02:32:07,700
Enix games themselves, they tend to show a little bit of diversity.

3274
02:32:07,700 --> 02:32:09,820
Even Lightning, if you want to stick with Final Fantasy.

3275
02:32:09,820 --> 02:32:10,820
Sure.

3276
02:32:10,820 --> 02:32:11,820
So, you know, anyway.

3277
02:32:11,820 --> 02:32:16,620
Or fuck, Final Fantasy X-2 or whatever.

3278
02:32:16,620 --> 02:32:17,620
There you go.

3279
02:32:17,620 --> 02:32:19,020
All female cast right there.

3280
02:32:19,020 --> 02:32:21,180
I don't understand what the problem is.

3281
02:32:21,180 --> 02:32:23,260
Like, they've done it both ways.

3282
02:32:23,260 --> 02:32:24,440
I think that's pretty even.

3283
02:32:24,440 --> 02:32:28,660
I really don't think that they have, people have a say in, I guess, I mean, you can say

3284
02:32:28,660 --> 02:32:32,060
whatever you want, but I don't think they should do anything about it, because I think

3285
02:32:32,060 --> 02:32:34,900
they've fairly represented the whole gamut.

3286
02:32:34,900 --> 02:32:35,900
All right.

3287
02:32:35,900 --> 02:32:41,060
Looking at our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

3288
02:32:41,060 --> 02:32:42,060
Let's see.

3289
02:32:42,060 --> 02:32:45,660
SSU100Matt suggesting Sid is a brilliant inventor and mechanic, and they made the character

3290
02:32:45,660 --> 02:32:48,940
as a woman in Final Fantasy XV.

3291
02:32:48,940 --> 02:32:53,500
Fifth Dream in chat says, I'm saying stop making sports games.

3292
02:32:53,500 --> 02:32:59,380
Brad from Pod Culture says, equal opportunity, a DOA game where you can adjust the junk jangle.

3293
02:32:59,380 --> 02:33:01,220
All right.

3294
02:33:01,220 --> 02:33:02,220
Anyhow.

3295
02:33:02,220 --> 02:33:03,220
I would play that.

3296
02:33:03,220 --> 02:33:07,220
I just want a game called junk jangle.

3297
02:33:07,220 --> 02:33:10,460
Anyhow.

3298
02:33:10,460 --> 02:33:11,460
Any more to email?

3299
02:33:11,460 --> 02:33:12,460
Yes.

3300
02:33:12,460 --> 02:33:13,460
We have another email.

3301
02:33:13,460 --> 02:33:14,460
Okay.

3302
02:33:14,460 --> 02:33:15,460
Cheese Rob.

3303
02:33:15,460 --> 02:33:16,460
Hello, LR.

3304
02:33:16,460 --> 02:33:20,020
I have to be at work early tomorrow, so I wasn't able to join you all live tonight,

3305
02:33:20,020 --> 02:33:22,940
but I need to say something.

3306
02:33:22,940 --> 02:33:25,860
Who was it that recommended the mobile game King of Thieves?

3307
02:33:25,860 --> 02:33:26,860
Was it Kaijuto?

3308
02:33:26,860 --> 02:33:28,860
Well, there's something I need to say to that person.

3309
02:33:28,860 --> 02:33:31,060
Are you happy with what you've done?

3310
02:33:31,060 --> 02:33:32,880
I'm now a hopeless addict.

3311
02:33:32,880 --> 02:33:35,580
My life is in tattered ruins, or maybe that's my dungeon.

3312
02:33:35,580 --> 02:33:39,100
Anyway, thank you very much for ruining my life, you jerk.

3313
02:33:39,100 --> 02:33:42,220
Now, excuse me while I steal someone's gems.

3314
02:33:42,220 --> 02:33:46,900
The stone league has only 24 hours left, and I'm 6,000 points behind.

3315
02:33:46,900 --> 02:33:49,660
Exploding ferrets upon your family, Aaron YYR.

3316
02:33:49,660 --> 02:33:54,460
PS, you should at least give this game a look if you don't mind having your life ruined.

3317
02:33:54,460 --> 02:33:57,820
Yes, that was Kaijuto that recommended that game to me.

3318
02:33:58,700 --> 02:34:01,580
He brought it up on the show, and then I brought it up on the show that, yes, I checked it

3319
02:34:01,580 --> 02:34:03,500
out, and yes, I had fun with it.

3320
02:34:03,500 --> 02:34:04,500
And so there you go.

3321
02:34:04,500 --> 02:34:08,060
So maybe in our little OL army, we all have our titles, right?

3322
02:34:08,060 --> 02:34:09,060
I'm the president.

3323
02:34:09,060 --> 02:34:10,580
Darth Vader is the overlord.

3324
02:34:10,580 --> 02:34:11,580
Loki's the pope.

3325
02:34:11,580 --> 02:34:13,340
Kaijuto can be the life ruiner.

3326
02:34:13,340 --> 02:34:15,220
There you go.

3327
02:34:15,220 --> 02:34:16,220
Ruiner of lives.

3328
02:34:16,220 --> 02:34:18,220
Is that it for emails tonight?

3329
02:34:18,220 --> 02:34:19,220
Yes.

3330
02:34:19,220 --> 02:34:21,500
By the way, do you have any pizza left?

3331
02:34:21,500 --> 02:34:22,500
Yes, I do.

3332
02:34:22,500 --> 02:34:24,300
May I have a slice?

3333
02:34:24,300 --> 02:34:25,300
You may.

3334
02:34:25,300 --> 02:34:26,500
It's terribly greasy, though.

3335
02:34:26,500 --> 02:34:27,500
I don't care.

3336
02:34:27,500 --> 02:34:30,380
I'm sitting here, my stomach rumbling.

3337
02:34:30,380 --> 02:34:35,420
Participate at, very important updates, participate at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send

3338
02:34:35,420 --> 02:34:40,220
us an email for next week, or the week after, or whenever you feel like you have something

3339
02:34:40,220 --> 02:34:41,220
to say.

3340
02:34:41,220 --> 02:34:42,220
You aren't shitting.

3341
02:34:42,220 --> 02:34:45,500
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

3342
02:34:45,500 --> 02:34:48,700
Every week on the show, we, are you okay, are you going to be okay over there, Dark

3343
02:34:48,700 --> 02:34:49,700
Sakura?

3344
02:34:49,700 --> 02:34:50,700
Oh my God, it's the whole week.

3345
02:34:50,700 --> 02:34:54,060
Okay, Dark Sakura is about ready to barf live in studio.

3346
02:34:54,060 --> 02:34:55,060
That's awkward.

3347
02:34:56,060 --> 02:34:58,060
But we're going to do the FUs of the week right now.

3348
02:35:14,060 --> 02:35:15,060
Dark Sakura.

3349
02:35:15,060 --> 02:35:16,060
Number one, fuck this pizza.

3350
02:35:16,060 --> 02:35:17,060
It's delicious.

3351
02:35:17,060 --> 02:35:18,060
And salty.

3352
02:35:18,060 --> 02:35:19,060
You weren't kidding.

3353
02:35:19,060 --> 02:35:23,060
Yeah, I told you there could be possibly too much bacon on that pizza.

3354
02:35:23,060 --> 02:35:24,060
It's pretty good.

3355
02:35:24,060 --> 02:35:25,060
I don't even care.

3356
02:35:25,060 --> 02:35:26,060
I'm so hungry right now.

3357
02:35:26,060 --> 02:35:29,060
I've had a pita today.

3358
02:35:29,060 --> 02:35:39,060
So, also FU to the guy driving the Corvette who decided it was a good idea to leave in

3359
02:35:39,060 --> 02:35:42,060
and out of traffic on single lane roads.

3360
02:35:42,060 --> 02:35:45,060
Yeah, fuck you.

3361
02:35:45,060 --> 02:35:51,060
And, fuck you to my sinus infection.

3362
02:35:51,060 --> 02:35:52,060
Loki?

3363
02:35:52,060 --> 02:35:57,060
I guess FU to having to still tweak my game.

3364
02:35:57,060 --> 02:36:01,060
I'm still making more levels and stuff, but like this other level I'm making that is supposed

3365
02:36:01,060 --> 02:36:06,060
to be focused on kind of teaching you that you can jump in your car.

3366
02:36:06,060 --> 02:36:09,060
I still have to figure out how I'm going to break it yet.

3367
02:36:09,060 --> 02:36:11,060
And it's kind of annoying.

3368
02:36:11,060 --> 02:36:12,060
Invisible ceilings.

3369
02:36:12,060 --> 02:36:18,060
No, no, no, not invisible ceilings, but I need something else like obstacles in a way

3370
02:36:18,060 --> 02:36:19,060
or something.

3371
02:36:19,060 --> 02:36:20,060
I just haven't figured out what.

3372
02:36:21,060 --> 02:36:22,060
I don't know.

3373
02:36:22,060 --> 02:36:23,060
It's just something ridiculous.

3374
02:36:23,060 --> 02:36:26,060
I haven't quite gotten there yet.

3375
02:36:26,060 --> 02:36:27,060
Is that it?

3376
02:36:27,060 --> 02:36:28,060
Yeah.

3377
02:36:28,060 --> 02:36:31,060
I just don't know what I'm going to do with that.

3378
02:36:31,060 --> 02:36:32,060
Oh, God.

3379
02:36:32,060 --> 02:36:35,060
I kind of have a lot I want to say in this FU segment, but I don't really have the words

3380
02:36:35,060 --> 02:36:36,060
for them right now.

3381
02:36:36,060 --> 02:36:43,060
So I'm just going to say FU to complicated things that happen.

3382
02:36:43,060 --> 02:36:48,060
I'm being vague for a reason, but there's just some complicated things that happened

3383
02:36:48,060 --> 02:36:49,060
recently.

3384
02:36:50,060 --> 02:36:51,060
Is it that thing?

3385
02:36:51,060 --> 02:36:53,060
I've been thinking about a lot.

3386
02:36:53,060 --> 02:36:55,060
Yes, we talked about it briefly before the show tonight.

3387
02:36:55,060 --> 02:36:59,060
And so you know, I'm kind of like I have a lot I want to say and yet I don't want to

3388
02:36:59,060 --> 02:37:00,060
say it.

3389
02:37:00,060 --> 02:37:04,060
So I will add in equal amounts of FU attention.

3390
02:37:04,060 --> 02:37:09,060
So I apologize for being vague, but at the same time, this is just like where I've fucking

3391
02:37:09,060 --> 02:37:10,060
been at for like 48 hours.

3392
02:37:10,060 --> 02:37:15,060
So FU to being vague.

3393
02:37:15,060 --> 02:37:18,060
Sorry, that's all I got.

3394
02:37:18,060 --> 02:37:21,060
All right, let's move on with a couple more stories.

3395
02:37:21,060 --> 02:37:26,060
And then we're going to get to the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype,

3396
02:37:26,060 --> 02:37:28,060
Orange Lounge Radio.

3397
02:37:28,060 --> 02:37:29,060
Loki.

3398
02:37:29,060 --> 02:37:34,060
So this is kind of disappointing, but I guess it makes sense considering, you know, the

3399
02:37:34,060 --> 02:37:36,060
events that have transpired.

3400
02:37:36,060 --> 02:37:44,060
But apparently Gen Con is looking to relocate from their location in Indiana.

3401
02:37:44,060 --> 02:37:50,060
They're basically saying that, you know, they for a decade more than a decade Indianapolis

3402
02:37:50,060 --> 02:37:55,060
has provided tremendous hospitality and accommodation to our attendees culminating in an estimated

3403
02:37:55,060 --> 02:37:59,060
economic impact of more than 50 million dollars to the city.

3404
02:37:59,060 --> 02:38:04,060
Gen Con and its attendees look forward to receiving the same warm Hoosier hospitality

3405
02:38:04,060 --> 02:38:06,060
throughout the term of our contract.

3406
02:38:06,060 --> 02:38:12,060
It says legislation that could allow for refusal of services or discrimination against our

3407
02:38:12,060 --> 02:38:13,060
attendees.

3408
02:38:13,060 --> 02:38:17,060
We'll have a direct negative impact on the state's economy and we'll factor in our decision

3409
02:38:17,060 --> 02:38:22,060
in making on hosting the convention in the state of Indiana in future years.

3410
02:38:22,060 --> 02:38:27,060
So basically because of SB 101, they're thinking of moving it.

3411
02:38:27,060 --> 02:38:31,060
I do want to say I have to jump in here with a follow up because I was following this pretty

3412
02:38:31,060 --> 02:38:34,060
closely because obviously, you know, when I heard the news about what happened in Indiana,

3413
02:38:34,060 --> 02:38:36,060
I was just like, what the fuck?

3414
02:38:36,060 --> 02:38:38,060
You know, like I think many people were.

3415
02:38:38,060 --> 02:38:42,060
Gen Con actually came out since that first came out and actually did reiterate that they're

3416
02:38:42,060 --> 02:38:46,060
kind of stuck there for, uh, until 2020 because of contractual obligations.

3417
02:38:46,060 --> 02:38:50,060
So they will actually not be relocating next year despite the threat.

3418
02:38:50,060 --> 02:38:56,060
However, they really bent over backwards to say, you know, the local businesses that we're

3419
02:38:56,060 --> 02:39:00,060
going to work with here in Indianapolis are not signing up for the, and they're not going

3420
02:39:00,060 --> 02:39:01,060
to discriminate.

3421
02:39:01,060 --> 02:39:04,060
We want to welcome all our attendees, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

3422
02:39:04,060 --> 02:39:06,060
Uh, it leaves, I don't know.

3423
02:39:06,060 --> 02:39:11,060
I'm, I'm very, I'm very torn on this because I do feel like there's probably a lot of people

3424
02:39:11,060 --> 02:39:16,060
in Indianapolis and Gen Con that want nothing to do with this fucking law.

3425
02:39:16,060 --> 02:39:22,060
Like they want nothing to do with this back at S word Z and, or excuse me, bullshittery

3426
02:39:22,060 --> 02:39:25,060
since I learned that word tonight and what happened in Indiana is bullshittery.

3427
02:39:25,060 --> 02:39:26,060
Let's be real.

3428
02:39:26,060 --> 02:39:28,060
Uh, so.

3429
02:39:28,060 --> 02:39:35,060
I kind of understand from that perspective, but I also understand the need to take an

3430
02:39:35,060 --> 02:39:40,060
iron fist and have an iron stance because the reality of the situation and delivering

3431
02:39:40,060 --> 02:39:45,060
that message to the governor that this is not okay, doesn't get delivered otherwise.

3432
02:39:45,060 --> 02:39:50,060
But I think what's happening, not to get too political here on OLR, but obviously I have

3433
02:39:50,060 --> 02:39:57,060
somewhat of an interest in this story here because the reality is I, with Alan, could

3434
02:39:57,060 --> 02:40:00,060
one day decide, I don't know why we would do this, but we, well, we might decide we

3435
02:40:00,060 --> 02:40:01,060
want to go to Gen Con.

3436
02:40:01,060 --> 02:40:03,060
I do have friends that go to Gen Con and have a good time.

3437
02:40:03,060 --> 02:40:10,060
We might go there to Indiana and somebody could legally choose to discriminate against

3438
02:40:10,060 --> 02:40:11,060
me.

3439
02:40:11,060 --> 02:40:14,060
And so I'm kind of like, that's fucking fucked.

3440
02:40:14,060 --> 02:40:18,060
So, I mean, I appreciate that the organizers of Gen Con are making sure that's not going

3441
02:40:18,060 --> 02:40:21,060
to happen, any business near them or any of that stuff.

3442
02:40:21,060 --> 02:40:25,060
But obviously a lot of stuff is happening with other companies.

3443
02:40:25,060 --> 02:40:29,060
Like I got to give massive props to like Salesforce and what is that?

3444
02:40:29,060 --> 02:40:30,060
Angie's List.

3445
02:40:30,060 --> 02:40:31,060
Is that what that site's called?

3446
02:40:32,060 --> 02:40:33,060
Yeah, Angie's List.

3447
02:40:33,060 --> 02:40:39,060
Who have come out big time to like say, not okay, and we're not going to do business in

3448
02:40:39,060 --> 02:40:40,060
a state.

3449
02:40:40,060 --> 02:40:41,060
And the guy acts so confused.

3450
02:40:41,060 --> 02:40:44,060
Well, why is everybody being mean to me?

3451
02:40:44,060 --> 02:40:45,060
Right?

3452
02:40:45,060 --> 02:40:48,060
Because you're a shit?

3453
02:40:48,060 --> 02:40:53,060
I would hope that the people of Indiana who do not believe in this bullshittery, and I

3454
02:40:53,060 --> 02:40:55,060
know there's decent people in Indiana.

3455
02:40:55,060 --> 02:41:00,060
I know some of y'all listen to this show, hi, act against this.

3456
02:41:01,060 --> 02:41:02,060
It blows my mind.

3457
02:41:02,060 --> 02:41:09,060
Here in the state of California in 2003, we recalled our governor over rolling blackouts

3458
02:41:09,060 --> 02:41:10,060
and power issues.

3459
02:41:12,060 --> 02:41:15,060
But the governor of Indiana is going to be allowed to stay after this.

3460
02:41:15,060 --> 02:41:18,060
Did you see what the mayor of San Francisco is doing?

3461
02:41:18,060 --> 02:41:21,060
Oh, they stopped all traveled Indiana.

3462
02:41:21,060 --> 02:41:23,060
Oh, officially sanctioned travel.

3463
02:41:23,060 --> 02:41:27,060
And I was reading about other places refusing to do trade business.

3464
02:41:28,060 --> 02:41:31,060
I just, it blows my mind people.

3465
02:41:31,060 --> 02:41:32,060
It blows my mind anyway.

3466
02:41:32,060 --> 02:41:38,060
So, uh, I'm, I'm a little sad to hear that Gen Con couldn't put its iron fist down, but

3467
02:41:38,060 --> 02:41:44,060
I also, I'm also trying to be fair and realize that a lot of these businesses in Indianapolis

3468
02:41:44,060 --> 02:41:47,060
probably want nothing to do with this fucking law and they're probably pissed about it.

3469
02:41:47,060 --> 02:41:53,060
So again, to sum it up, my voice is if you're pissed about it, you need to let your lawmakers

3470
02:41:53,060 --> 02:41:59,060
know, don't be passive about this shit because there's other people that aren't going to

3471
02:41:59,060 --> 02:42:00,060
react so passively.

3472
02:42:01,060 --> 02:42:02,060
Just saying.

3473
02:42:02,060 --> 02:42:03,060
All right.

3474
02:42:03,060 --> 02:42:04,060
Um, let's see.

3475
02:42:04,060 --> 02:42:08,060
Um, and Brad from pod culture saying I'm from Indiana and I'm kind of ashamed of that fact

3476
02:42:08,060 --> 02:42:09,060
right now.

3477
02:42:09,060 --> 02:42:10,060
Watch what you say.

3478
02:42:10,060 --> 02:42:14,060
I got that statement, got the Dixie chicks and a whole lot of trouble of my, you know,

3479
02:42:14,060 --> 02:42:15,060
my friend Susan.

3480
02:42:15,060 --> 02:42:16,060
Yeah.

3481
02:42:16,060 --> 02:42:17,060
She moves in Susan.

3482
02:42:17,060 --> 02:42:18,060
Yeah.

3483
02:42:18,060 --> 02:42:19,060
Yeah.

3484
02:42:19,060 --> 02:42:20,060
She's from Indiana.

3485
02:42:20,060 --> 02:42:21,060
She said the same thing.

3486
02:42:21,060 --> 02:42:25,220
There are tons of awesome people from Indiana of which these are two people I would put

3487
02:42:25,220 --> 02:42:29,500
near the top of the list, but I will come out and say that when the Alabama Supreme

3488
02:42:29,500 --> 02:42:34,060
Court was pulling the bullshit, I was really ashamed to be from there.

3489
02:42:34,060 --> 02:42:38,180
And I'm going to say it on radio, I love where I'm from.

3490
02:42:38,180 --> 02:42:41,780
I am super disappointed in my home state.

3491
02:42:41,780 --> 02:42:45,820
I think because you all know, I volunteered for the no on eight campaign when that whole

3492
02:42:45,820 --> 02:42:50,620
thing went down and yeah, no, I know, but when, when it, when it ended up passing, I

3493
02:42:50,620 --> 02:42:52,140
don't know if I would say I was in shame.

3494
02:42:52,140 --> 02:42:55,940
I was ashamed, but I was just embarrassed.

3495
02:42:55,940 --> 02:42:58,820
I was just embarrassed.

3496
02:42:58,820 --> 02:43:01,060
I'm still embarrassed that there's like that black mark.

3497
02:43:01,060 --> 02:43:04,940
I mean, I realized it all got fixed up since then, but I'm still kind of like, that was

3498
02:43:04,940 --> 02:43:07,220
just embarrassing.

3499
02:43:07,220 --> 02:43:13,260
But you know, even in that short time, I have actually talked to people one on one that

3500
02:43:13,260 --> 02:43:16,800
said, I voted yes on eight and I was wrong.

3501
02:43:16,800 --> 02:43:18,140
I've changed my mind.

3502
02:43:18,140 --> 02:43:19,440
I've thought differently.

3503
02:43:19,440 --> 02:43:23,200
And so you have to kind of look at that and go, okay, progress.

3504
02:43:23,200 --> 02:43:24,200
We're making progress.

3505
02:43:24,200 --> 02:43:25,200
It's happening.

3506
02:43:25,200 --> 02:43:28,880
I've talked to people who voted on it and said they would vote on it again.

3507
02:43:28,880 --> 02:43:30,640
And I was like, why am I talking to you?

3508
02:43:30,640 --> 02:43:35,960
That would be my reaction by Felicia.

3509
02:43:35,960 --> 02:43:41,040
And the thing is, is that I really, it's, it's, I'm so disgusted with it.

3510
02:43:41,040 --> 02:43:45,300
I'm literally disgusted to think that there are still people in this world who think that

3511
02:43:45,300 --> 02:43:47,520
having that kind of attitude is right.

3512
02:43:47,520 --> 02:43:48,520
Yeah.

3513
02:43:48,600 --> 02:43:52,840
If you didn't know, if you didn't catch on to it already, I'm a gay guy who's here doing

3514
02:43:52,840 --> 02:43:57,960
the show and I live with my partner and we're in a, we're in a relationship and we've been

3515
02:43:57,960 --> 02:44:02,680
a long-term five years and, and you know, we're, we're, we're pretty decent people and

3516
02:44:02,680 --> 02:44:10,240
I'm not really looking to corrupt people or I'm not, I don't have a fucking agenda.

3517
02:44:10,240 --> 02:44:15,880
My agenda is to make sure the cat gets fed, uh, go to work every day so I can, you know,

3518
02:44:15,920 --> 02:44:18,760
afford to have a place for me and my partner to live.

3519
02:44:18,760 --> 02:44:21,400
I don't, I, I like to play video games too.

3520
02:44:21,400 --> 02:44:22,400
Like a lot of you do.

3521
02:44:22,400 --> 02:44:26,760
We're just, we're, we're not fucking like crazy people.

3522
02:44:26,760 --> 02:44:29,320
Crazy people are in all sorts of, sure.

3523
02:44:29,320 --> 02:44:30,560
There's gay, crazy people out there.

3524
02:44:30,560 --> 02:44:32,360
There's a lot of straight, crazy people too.

3525
02:44:32,360 --> 02:44:34,640
There's a lot of white, crazy people, a lot of black, crazy people.

3526
02:44:34,640 --> 02:44:37,320
There are crazy people everywhere.

3527
02:44:37,320 --> 02:44:45,840
As I told my mother, don't judge the entire LBGTQA et cetera community based on the praise

3528
02:44:45,840 --> 02:44:49,000
it's a little crazy.

3529
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:54,120
Now the one thing I was going to say is that I, now I grew up Southern Baptist.

3530
02:44:54,120 --> 02:45:00,320
The attitudes that have formed this had a hand in my raising and I will say this, if

3531
02:45:00,320 --> 02:45:09,320
y'all want to know what the hell the commandment is, it's one love God to love your neighbor.

3532
02:45:09,320 --> 02:45:10,320
That's it.

3533
02:45:10,320 --> 02:45:11,320
There's nothing on there.

3534
02:45:11,320 --> 02:45:14,240
There's no except in that part of scripture at all.

3535
02:45:14,240 --> 02:45:17,820
So the moment I hear this shit, I say, what does it say that in scripture you pointed

3536
02:45:17,820 --> 02:45:18,820
out to me?

3537
02:45:18,820 --> 02:45:19,820
Yeah.

3538
02:45:19,820 --> 02:45:23,220
No, I, and I got to watch how far down the political religious route we go because we

3539
02:45:23,220 --> 02:45:24,220
are a video game show.

3540
02:45:24,220 --> 02:45:28,020
But at the same time, these are, these are issues that like fucking impact me.

3541
02:45:28,020 --> 02:45:29,760
This is, this is my life.

3542
02:45:29,760 --> 02:45:34,520
You know, when, when people are saying that, you know, there might be a business or a restaurant

3543
02:45:34,520 --> 02:45:40,960
that you might go into that doesn't serve you because you know, of some agenda they

3544
02:45:40,960 --> 02:45:41,960
made up.

3545
02:45:41,960 --> 02:45:44,600
And that speech also gives people the right to pick at that place.

3546
02:45:44,600 --> 02:45:45,600
Yeah.

3547
02:45:45,600 --> 02:45:51,280
Anyway, moving on, uh, let's talk about, let's end on some positivity and charity and good

3548
02:45:51,280 --> 02:45:52,280
things.

3549
02:45:52,280 --> 02:45:57,620
And we're going to talk about a guy who you may not have knew was gay, just from my hometown

3550
02:45:57,620 --> 02:46:04,240
and just, just happens to be a gay guy running like the biggest funky, funky, get down in

3551
02:46:04,240 --> 02:46:05,240
funk.

3552
02:46:05,240 --> 02:46:10,200
Uh, the biggest funky company in the world, Apple, uh, Apple CEO, Tim Cook has mentioned

3553
02:46:10,200 --> 02:46:15,960
that he's going to donate his fortune to charity, uh, and that he's been quietly donating to

3554
02:46:15,960 --> 02:46:17,880
causes for quite some time now.

3555
02:46:17,880 --> 02:46:24,240
Uh, he looks forward to when he can actually just, uh, you know, engage in meaningful philanthropy

3556
02:46:24,240 --> 02:46:26,080
on a greater scale later on in life.

3557
02:46:26,080 --> 02:46:29,400
So I'm imagining talking about retirement and those sorts of things.

3558
02:46:29,400 --> 02:46:33,680
Um, so I mean, in some of these other interviews, in some of the interviews and so forth, he

3559
02:46:33,680 --> 02:46:38,600
said that he has enough set aside for like the nephew to get his nephew through college

3560
02:46:38,600 --> 02:46:39,920
and all this stuff.

3561
02:46:39,920 --> 02:46:44,480
But the vast majority of his fortune, he plans to turn around and donate to charity.

3562
02:46:44,480 --> 02:46:48,560
Now I'm not saying everybody out there has to donate all of their money to charity.

3563
02:46:48,560 --> 02:46:50,360
And what does this have to do with gaming?

3564
02:46:50,360 --> 02:46:53,200
Well, Apple's getting a bigger and bigger presence.

3565
02:46:53,200 --> 02:46:59,240
You know, 30% of whatever you buy on iTunes, uh, goes to Apple and some of that money goes

3566
02:46:59,240 --> 02:47:00,240
to Tim Cook.

3567
02:47:00,240 --> 02:47:05,640
So, you know, it's nice to know at least that some people want to turn it around and put

3568
02:47:05,640 --> 02:47:08,900
that money back into their community in one way or another.

3569
02:47:08,900 --> 02:47:12,040
But at the same time, if Tim Cook had come out and said, you know, I want to make sure

3570
02:47:12,040 --> 02:47:16,980
that all my relatives are being provided for and so forth, I would, I would have been cool

3571
02:47:16,980 --> 02:47:17,980
with that too.

3572
02:47:17,980 --> 02:47:22,860
But I think it's really cool when you can say, I'm going to provide for this person,

3573
02:47:22,860 --> 02:47:26,020
but to a point, you know, and then they're going to have to go out and make their own

3574
02:47:26,020 --> 02:47:28,220
riches between providing and enabling.

3575
02:47:28,220 --> 02:47:29,220
Yeah.

3576
02:47:29,220 --> 02:47:32,500
I think that's, that's a good way of putting it just makes me super, super happy because

3577
02:47:32,500 --> 02:47:33,500
he's from my hometown.

3578
02:47:33,500 --> 02:47:34,500
Yeah.

3579
02:47:34,500 --> 02:47:35,500
So, all right.

3580
02:47:35,500 --> 02:47:36,500
There you go.

3581
02:47:36,500 --> 02:47:41,500
So, uh, good to know that some of that money you're putting into iTunes today, uh, might

3582
02:47:41,500 --> 02:47:44,300
go around and end up in charitable things in the future.

3583
02:47:44,300 --> 02:47:48,820
But to be fair and, you know, to, to make sure everybody gets their praises, obviously

3584
02:47:48,820 --> 02:47:52,940
Bill Gates, Microsoft, Bill Gates may not be as intimately involved in Microsoft as

3585
02:47:52,940 --> 02:47:57,180
he once was, but certainly super charitable guy himself does a lot of great things and

3586
02:47:57,180 --> 02:47:58,380
brings awareness to that stuff.

3587
02:47:58,380 --> 02:48:02,260
So there's a lot of awesome charitable people in the tech industry and, uh, you know, we

3588
02:48:02,260 --> 02:48:03,500
should tip our hat to him.

3589
02:48:03,500 --> 02:48:04,500
All right.

3590
02:48:04,500 --> 02:48:09,540
Uh, we're going to get to the phone lines right now, 1-877-GAME-OLR and your username

3591
02:48:09,540 --> 02:48:10,540
on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

3592
02:48:10,540 --> 02:48:15,260
Uh, if you want to give us a call, we're going to get to some calls here live on the show

3593
02:48:15,260 --> 02:48:19,860
and then I'll also check in with Loki and see if he has any last minute topics.

3594
02:48:19,860 --> 02:48:24,340
Uh, let's go to the phones, however, right now, cause I think we have the phones lighting

3595
02:48:24,340 --> 02:48:25,340
up.

3596
02:48:25,340 --> 02:48:26,340
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

3597
02:48:26,340 --> 02:48:27,340
Who's this?

3598
02:48:27,340 --> 02:48:28,340
Hi, this is Ragingator.

3599
02:48:28,340 --> 02:48:29,340
Hey, Ragingator.

3600
02:48:29,340 --> 02:48:30,340
How you doing?

3601
02:48:30,340 --> 02:48:31,340
How about yourself?

3602
02:48:31,340 --> 02:48:32,340
Good.

3603
02:48:32,340 --> 02:48:33,340
Good.

3604
02:48:33,340 --> 02:48:36,420
Ragingator, as you were calling yourself earlier in the show with a new haircut.

3605
02:48:36,420 --> 02:48:37,420
I see.

3606
02:48:37,420 --> 02:48:38,420
It looks like you buzzed your hair there.

3607
02:48:38,420 --> 02:48:39,420
How you doing?

3608
02:48:39,420 --> 02:48:44,300
Uh, yeah, I was in dire need of a haircut, you know, so I can't figure what the hell.

3609
02:48:44,300 --> 02:48:45,780
It is sure as possible.

3610
02:48:45,780 --> 02:48:47,180
Well, it looks good, my friend.

3611
02:48:47,180 --> 02:48:48,180
How you doing?

3612
02:48:48,180 --> 02:48:49,180
What's on your mind tonight?

3613
02:48:49,180 --> 02:48:50,180
Uh, yeah.

3614
02:48:50,180 --> 02:48:52,180
A couple of things to note.

3615
02:48:52,180 --> 02:48:57,700
Um, I, you know, if you personally have noticed or not, uh, I would imagine you being kind

3616
02:48:57,700 --> 02:49:05,780
of busy and whatnot, but, um, right now, if you look on Steam, there's, um, uh, this

3617
02:49:05,780 --> 02:49:14,620
weekend, there's a sale on, uh, all of, uh, Sega's, uh, titles, uh, you know, if I remember

3618
02:49:14,620 --> 02:49:15,620
right there.

3619
02:49:15,620 --> 02:49:17,180
You want me to bring you up?

3620
02:49:17,180 --> 02:49:19,580
I did see the sale itself on Steam.

3621
02:49:19,580 --> 02:49:23,020
I did log into Steam this weekend because I looked at it and I went, ooh, Sega stuff's

3622
02:49:23,020 --> 02:49:24,020
on sale.

3623
02:49:24,020 --> 02:49:25,900
I need to make sure I have everything I want.

3624
02:49:25,900 --> 02:49:29,340
And sure enough, things like Space Channel 5, I have them in my library.

3625
02:49:29,340 --> 02:49:32,140
I just haven't played them since I bought them.

3626
02:49:32,140 --> 02:49:34,020
And I brought, that's how I brought Deep Shame.

3627
02:49:34,020 --> 02:49:39,340
I'm jumping out of a club, ugh, God, I, you know, not to sound like I'm bragging on, uh,

3628
02:49:39,340 --> 02:49:45,620
that's not my intention, but I got shit ton of games myself and, uh, I only played a handful

3629
02:49:45,620 --> 02:49:51,020
of them and I, of all my games, I haven't beaten a single one yet.

3630
02:49:51,020 --> 02:49:57,380
Uh, but anyway, you know, getting back to my point, I can't figure, you know, this

3631
02:49:57,380 --> 02:50:01,980
would probably be something that Sky would be interested in, uh, I already know that

3632
02:50:01,980 --> 02:50:10,980
Dr. Sakura noticed because I seen, uh, she bought themself, but, um, but anyway, there

3633
02:50:10,980 --> 02:50:17,620
was a second point to my, uh, call, but, uh, I'm starting to go, you know, get, uh, I'm

3634
02:50:17,620 --> 02:50:18,620
brain farting.

3635
02:50:18,620 --> 02:50:28,020
I forget what I was going to mention, uh, ooh, sorry, brain fart, um, you know, oh yeah,

3636
02:50:28,020 --> 02:50:34,700
you know, uh, you know, well, since I'm brain farting on my second point, I'm going to make

3637
02:50:34,700 --> 02:50:37,700
something up on the, uh, on the fly.

3638
02:50:37,700 --> 02:50:47,380
Um, now, you know, if, uh, since, uh, uh, Sega's, uh, you know, put a lot of the Sega

3639
02:50:47,380 --> 02:50:55,180
Genesis stuff, uh, on Steam, uh, you know, is there any, like, older console games that

3640
02:50:55,180 --> 02:51:05,180
you would love to, uh, see on, uh, Steam or, uh, there's also some, uh, no, just, uh, console

3641
02:51:05,180 --> 02:51:11,020
games, but arcade games, like, uh, I've seen Ikaruga on there, there was arcade game and

3642
02:51:11,020 --> 02:51:16,100
of course there's the Pac-Man games, so on and so forth, other, you know, older arcade

3643
02:51:16,100 --> 02:51:20,020
games as well that you would like to see on Steam.

3644
02:51:20,020 --> 02:51:21,020
That's a really good question.

3645
02:51:21,020 --> 02:51:24,940
What kind of, like, old arcade or old console games would you like to see on Steam?

3646
02:51:24,940 --> 02:51:29,620
I think things that I remember from my youth with a strong co-op angle from it, um, and,

3647
02:51:29,620 --> 02:51:33,460
you know, things come to mind, like the Ninja Turtles game and the Simpsons arcade game,

3648
02:51:33,460 --> 02:51:37,100
but I thought the Simpsons arcade game was on, I don't know if it's on Steam, but I thought

3649
02:51:37,100 --> 02:51:41,540
that was something they put on PC when they ported to all the other consoles some time

3650
02:51:41,540 --> 02:51:42,540
ago.

3651
02:51:42,540 --> 02:51:45,340
It was on PC a long time ago, too, because I had an old floppy version of it.

3652
02:51:45,340 --> 02:51:46,880
Oh, god, that's right!

3653
02:51:46,880 --> 02:51:50,420
There was, like, the whole, like, you could play on EGA and CGA and all, oh my god, that's

3654
02:51:50,420 --> 02:51:51,420
right!

3655
02:51:51,420 --> 02:51:54,420
Well, it was CGA, but yeah, it was, it was, it was, it was a version.

3656
02:51:54,420 --> 02:51:58,980
Oh yeah, no, I remember, that's right, that's old school, but, um, yeah, I, I mean, I think

3657
02:51:58,980 --> 02:52:02,480
about, like, arcade experiences like that and those are the types of things I would

3658
02:52:02,520 --> 02:52:03,720
like to see on Steam.

3659
02:52:03,720 --> 02:52:06,040
Is The Grid on Steam?

3660
02:52:06,040 --> 02:52:08,880
Because I know we used to play a lot of that at, uh, Golf Land.

3661
02:52:08,880 --> 02:52:13,360
Uh, maybe, uh, I don't know if this is old school, but maybe, like, Initial D. I don't

3662
02:52:13,360 --> 02:52:15,160
know, you guys have any answers for this?

3663
02:52:15,160 --> 02:52:17,360
What kind of, like, old school, either arcade or PC?

3664
02:52:17,360 --> 02:52:19,640
The Grid's probably emulated through MAME now.

3665
02:52:19,640 --> 02:52:21,120
I guess that's true.

3666
02:52:21,120 --> 02:52:22,120
I don't know how well it would work.

3667
02:52:22,120 --> 02:52:24,400
I wish Planet Harrier actually worked.

3668
02:52:24,400 --> 02:52:26,400
I haven't been able to get it to work yet.

3669
02:52:26,400 --> 02:52:27,400
Mm-hmm.

3670
02:52:27,400 --> 02:52:29,080
There you go.

3671
02:52:29,080 --> 02:52:30,080
Some of our answers here.

3672
02:52:30,080 --> 02:52:31,080
What about you, buddy?

3673
02:52:31,680 --> 02:52:38,600
Oh, there's so many, uh, unless it's, uh, hard to give a short, concise answer, uh,

3674
02:52:38,600 --> 02:52:47,280
just off the top of my head, maybe some old, uh, you know, virtually, you know, the entire

3675
02:52:47,280 --> 02:52:54,480
back catalog of, uh, Konami, you know, arcade games, uh, and miracle games like Galaga,

3676
02:52:55,480 --> 02:53:04,280
you know, the 1980-19, like you mentioned, the Simpsons game, uh, so on and so forth.

3677
02:53:04,280 --> 02:53:14,480
Um, and, ooh, I mean, there's so many games, it's hard to, uh, give a short answer.

3678
02:53:14,480 --> 02:53:20,480
I mean, I can go on all nights and, you know, rallying them off as they occur to me, so,

3679
02:53:20,480 --> 02:53:30,480
um, you know, I, I love retro stuff, and, uh, you know, even, and, uh, you know, when,

3680
02:53:30,480 --> 02:53:37,480
uh, whatchamacallit, uh, you know, Game Room was out for, uh, you know, uh, you know, Xbox

3681
02:53:37,480 --> 02:53:38,480
360, and, uh,

3682
02:53:38,480 --> 02:53:41,480
God, you're gonna taunt me with memories of this again, aren't you?

3683
02:53:41,480 --> 02:53:44,480
You're gonna taunt me with all the things that Game Room could have and should have

3684
02:53:44,480 --> 02:53:47,480
been until the plug was prematurely pulled.

3685
02:53:47,480 --> 02:53:49,480
Are we really gonna do this again?

3686
02:53:50,480 --> 02:53:51,480
You're right.

3687
02:53:51,480 --> 02:53:58,480
Yeah, oh, oh, yeah, um, not to quickly, you know, uh, switch tracks up before I forget

3688
02:53:58,480 --> 02:54:06,480
again, um, if you recall, just at the end of, uh, Bobby's show, when he was taking calls,

3689
02:54:06,480 --> 02:54:15,480
I called in, and, uh, I mentioned, uh, the arcade stick that I had recently, uh, bought,

3690
02:54:15,480 --> 02:54:22,480
uh, you know, and I, I was seriously thinking, uh, thinking of doing a review, uh, for the

3691
02:54:22,480 --> 02:54:28,480
site, because I, you know, to the best of my knowledge, I hardly ever see, uh, you know,

3692
02:54:28,480 --> 02:54:32,480
a hardware review for, uh, the sites, unless I'm overlooking something.

3693
02:54:32,480 --> 02:54:34,480
No, I, uh, why not?

3694
02:54:34,480 --> 02:54:43,480
Which, uh, now, uh, Bobby mentioned, uh, emailing, uh, emailing, uh, a review, uh, which email,

3695
02:54:43,480 --> 02:54:50,480
you know, address do I, uh, send, uh, send out the review to, or do I send it to, uh,

3696
02:54:50,480 --> 02:54:53,480
participate OLR, or?

3697
02:54:53,480 --> 02:54:58,480
No, send it, send it to me directly at vognetwork, rob at vognetwork.com, and, uh, I'll look it

3698
02:54:58,480 --> 02:55:01,480
over, and if I have any feedback, I'll let you know, and, you know, yeah, we're always

3699
02:55:01,480 --> 02:55:04,480
looking for more people that want to contribute to VOG Network.

3700
02:55:04,480 --> 02:55:06,480
Um, I have to be very careful sometimes.

3701
02:55:06,480 --> 02:55:07,480
It's a slippery slope.

3702
02:55:07,480 --> 02:55:12,480
I don't want to go out and quote-unquote recruit writers, because we're an all-volunteer organization,

3703
02:55:12,480 --> 02:55:16,480
and I realize there's writers out there that do great work and deserve to get paid for

3704
02:55:16,480 --> 02:55:20,480
that work, and, but the reality is, you know, we're pretty much, you know, I don't get paid

3705
02:55:20,480 --> 02:55:21,480
for this podcast.

3706
02:55:21,480 --> 02:55:26,480
We actually pay out of pocket to do the site, so as it is right now, we're pretty much an

3707
02:55:26,480 --> 02:55:30,480
all-volunteer, you know, group, but if somebody wants to contribute something, I've got a

3708
02:55:30,480 --> 02:55:32,480
platform to run that contribution on.

3709
02:55:32,480 --> 02:55:36,480
Let's do it, you know, so this is why I don't like to tell people what to write about.

3710
02:55:36,480 --> 02:55:41,480
I want to just say, hey, voice of geeks, geeks, lend me your voices.

3711
02:55:41,480 --> 02:55:42,480
What do you want to say?

3712
02:55:42,480 --> 02:55:43,480
And see what happens.

3713
02:55:43,480 --> 02:55:46,480
So, I think if I were to start bossing people around, then I'd have failed.

3714
02:55:46,480 --> 02:55:47,480
Yeah, I've definitely seen your point.

3715
02:55:47,480 --> 02:55:57,480
Uh, you know, honestly, I just felt like contributing something, you know, aside from the quote-unquote

3716
02:55:57,480 --> 02:56:03,480
unofficial reviews I posted into the forums, uh, you know, regarding the two magic, uh,

3717
02:56:03,480 --> 02:56:08,480
recent Magic the Gallery games that came out, uh, for the past few years, I thought I would

3718
02:56:08,480 --> 02:56:14,480
do something more official that would be on the main site rather than just the forums.

3719
02:56:14,480 --> 02:56:18,480
Well, send me an email, and that goes for anybody out there, just, just not to make

3720
02:56:18,480 --> 02:56:21,480
this show just about you, Rage Nator, so this goes about for everybody out there.

3721
02:56:21,480 --> 02:56:23,480
If you're interested, uh, send me an email.

3722
02:56:23,480 --> 02:56:26,480
So, uh, I will look forward to reading your review soon.

3723
02:56:26,480 --> 02:56:30,480
Uh, actually, I didn't hear the very end of Bobby's, uh, show, uh, when you called in

3724
02:56:30,480 --> 02:56:34,480
because our guest had just showed up, so, um, I will, I will look for that when you

3725
02:56:34,480 --> 02:56:35,480
email it.

3726
02:56:35,480 --> 02:56:36,480
All right?

3727
02:56:36,480 --> 02:56:40,480
Uh, sure, yeah, you know, in fact, I'll, you know, get started on the, the, you know,

3728
02:56:40,480 --> 02:56:43,480
writing the review, uh, you know, first thing tomorrow.

3729
02:56:43,480 --> 02:56:44,480
Sounds good.

3730
02:56:44,480 --> 02:56:46,480
All right, my friend, I gotta let you know just so we can get more calls.

3731
02:56:46,480 --> 02:56:47,480
Take care, my friend.

3732
02:56:47,480 --> 02:56:48,480
All right.

3733
02:56:48,480 --> 02:56:49,480
Good night.

3734
02:56:49,480 --> 02:56:50,480
Bye.

3735
02:56:50,480 --> 02:56:51,480
Later.

3736
02:56:51,480 --> 02:56:54,480
All right, 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, but it's lighting

3737
02:56:54,480 --> 02:56:55,480
up tonight.

3738
02:56:55,480 --> 02:56:57,480
Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

3739
02:56:57,480 --> 02:57:02,480
Hello, if you can hear me, I can't hear you, so make sure you're talking into your microphone

3740
02:57:02,480 --> 02:57:03,480
or you...

3741
02:57:03,480 --> 02:57:04,480
Whoa, Legend of Zaku here.

3742
02:57:04,480 --> 02:57:05,480
Hey, Zaku, how you doing, buddy?

3743
02:57:05,480 --> 02:57:06,480
Fine, as usual.

3744
02:57:06,480 --> 02:57:08,480
What's on your mind?

3745
02:57:08,480 --> 02:57:14,480
Oh, nothing much the usual of, uh, trying to get through seeing you and Paxis a few

3746
02:57:14,480 --> 02:57:15,480
weeks back.

3747
02:57:15,480 --> 02:57:18,480
I know, it was literally for, like, two seconds that I saw you.

3748
02:57:18,480 --> 02:57:22,480
Yeah, well, I mean, it was, yeah, we were at that party that Friday night.

3749
02:57:22,480 --> 02:57:24,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3750
02:57:24,480 --> 02:57:28,480
The, the, the, and I forget the name of it, 16-bit Boston or something like that, I know

3751
02:57:28,480 --> 02:57:32,480
the gals from Electric Sisterhood were co-sponsoring it, but yeah, good times.

3752
02:57:32,480 --> 02:57:39,480
Yup, I mean, yeah, I haven't been, well, let's just say aside from, like, whoring out FSX

3753
02:57:39,480 --> 02:57:44,480
for the past few weeks as usual, spending godly amounts of money on planes, such as

3754
02:57:44,480 --> 02:57:52,480
60 bucks, almost $60 on a 747, but aside from that, like, GTA 5's coming out on PC, and

3755
02:57:52,480 --> 02:57:57,480
I guess, you know, because obviously I'm probably gonna get suckered into getting that one,

3756
02:57:57,480 --> 02:58:01,480
I'm wondering whether or not it's, like, too late at this point, because, you know,

3757
02:58:01,480 --> 02:58:06,480
I've, I've had to, like, plunk down money for the PS3 version, and after a few months

3758
02:58:06,480 --> 02:58:11,480
of beating the game, there was nothing really other than to try GTA Online, and then now

3759
02:58:11,480 --> 02:58:15,480
it's whether or not I should, you know, whether or not it's even worth getting back into it,

3760
02:58:15,480 --> 02:58:20,480
even with the new Heist patch and everything.

3761
02:58:21,480 --> 02:58:27,480
I know, it's kind of, like, because of the fact that I, I've already, I've already, like,

3762
02:58:27,480 --> 02:58:32,480
already sailed that ship, and whether or not I should go back on board with the PC version

3763
02:58:32,480 --> 02:58:36,480
because of the new graphics and the fact that I have a card that can actually handle it.

3764
02:58:36,480 --> 02:58:39,480
Is that tough to want to buy the same game multiple times? Because maybe I'm the wrong

3765
02:58:39,480 --> 02:58:44,480
person to ask about that, because can we talk about how many times I bought Mass Effect 3?

3766
02:58:44,480 --> 02:58:49,480
Yeah, and the fact, and the fact of the matter that I haven't even bought that one yet,

3767
02:58:49,480 --> 02:58:55,480
but I guess, yeah, whether or not that justifies, you know, the fact that I bought a GTX 970

3768
02:58:55,480 --> 02:58:56,480
over the holidays.

3769
02:58:56,480 --> 02:59:01,480
Really? Isn't that the fancy one? Isn't that the fancy pants graphic card?

3770
02:59:01,480 --> 02:59:06,480
Yeah, and that was, and that's the thing, it's like, I had to pull together not just

3771
02:59:06,480 --> 02:59:10,480
birthday and Christmas money to, you know, soften the blow, and then I had to take out

3772
02:59:10,480 --> 02:59:15,480
a little bit of extra savings just to make, you know, just to get it through.

3773
02:59:15,480 --> 02:59:20,480
But it's micro center, so it's not, that purchase has not gone in vain.

3774
02:59:20,480 --> 02:59:26,480
Because at least, you know, with the two-year warranty, I could just hand it in, no questions

3775
02:59:26,480 --> 02:59:30,480
asked, and, you know, get store credit for it for another card.

3776
02:59:30,480 --> 02:59:34,480
Let me ask you about this, because I don't think we've had you on the show since this

3777
02:59:34,480 --> 02:59:39,480
news kind of broke, and I think, I want to say you were actually the first person to

3778
02:59:39,480 --> 02:59:42,480
kind of tell me this was going on, and then I started to get messages from everywhere,

3779
02:59:42,480 --> 02:59:45,480
but this is, of course, I'm going to ask you, because I know you're a long time supporter

3780
02:59:45,480 --> 02:59:48,480
of Konami and music games and so forth, I want to ask you about the whole, you know,

3781
02:59:48,480 --> 02:59:56,480
shutdown and the EMUs global. As a Bomani fan, what do you think about where all this is going?

3782
02:59:56,480 --> 03:00:02,480
Probably nowhere, just because of that company's disappointment.

3783
03:00:02,480 --> 03:00:08,480
I mean, let's be honest here, the only time they really have taken risks was back in the

3784
03:00:09,480 --> 03:00:12,480
days when this whole, you know, when music games were really starting to take off.

3785
03:00:12,480 --> 03:00:18,480
Like, if it wasn't for them, like, taking the risk of bringing DDR worldwide, then yeah,

3786
03:00:18,480 --> 03:00:23,480
I would have stayed in Japan. But then once they take the risk, then they become too comfortable

3787
03:00:23,480 --> 03:00:31,480
with their position. And once they feel threatened as a result of competing forces,

3788
03:00:31,480 --> 03:00:36,480
like, you know, for Pump It Up and, you know, back in the day with ITG,

3789
03:00:36,480 --> 03:00:43,480
they resort to using the, you know, the courts in order to seek remedies for that.

3790
03:00:43,480 --> 03:00:49,480
That is a really, I gotta say, that's a really succinct and good way of kind of summing it all up,

3791
03:00:49,480 --> 03:00:55,480
and I think it's similar to something I've definitely said on the show before,

3792
03:00:55,480 --> 03:00:59,480
is that they were too afraid to take risks, and then when other people took the risks and it paid off,

3793
03:00:59,480 --> 03:01:05,480
they were like, how did we get left in the dust? Shouldn't this have been our idea?

3794
03:01:05,480 --> 03:01:08,480
Was it our idea? Do we have a patent?

3795
03:01:08,480 --> 03:01:14,480
It's not even like them being completely, you know, risk takers in that sense.

3796
03:01:14,480 --> 03:01:19,480
It's more them being risk adverse and being reactive instead of being proactive.

3797
03:01:19,480 --> 03:01:27,480
Supernova was a reaction to ITG. And then, you know, everything else like,

3798
03:01:27,480 --> 03:01:37,480
and then further iterations of DER were essentially a reaction to Pump It Up, like, you know, early on.

3799
03:01:37,480 --> 03:01:44,480
But I'm not holding my breath just because, as I said, even with the shakeup in leadership of that company,

3800
03:01:44,480 --> 03:01:50,480
a lot of sources, from what I'm hearing, are still very wary of bringing EMU stateside,

3801
03:01:50,480 --> 03:01:53,480
short of like round one taking care of that.

3802
03:01:53,480 --> 03:02:00,480
And that really is yet to be seen whether or not round one has a viable chance expanding.

3803
03:02:00,480 --> 03:02:03,480
I mean, sure, they're definitely hitting up the East Coast right now.

3804
03:02:03,480 --> 03:02:07,480
From what I've seen on their site, they're trying to build one near Massachusetts.

3805
03:02:07,480 --> 03:02:16,480
But as I said, this whole arcade scene here, to be honest, it's kind of like it's dying.

3806
03:02:16,480 --> 03:02:20,480
And this is what Kyle Ward alluded to when I was talking to him at PAX East.

3807
03:02:20,480 --> 03:02:26,480
He pretty much said that the front, I mean, the front right now is pretty much mobile.

3808
03:02:26,480 --> 03:02:34,480
Getting re-raved to mobile was, you know, was probably one of the early, the initial goals aside from the arcade version.

3809
03:02:34,480 --> 03:02:41,480
But even the new game that he had out, the one that we have to follow the actual notes for each measure.

3810
03:02:41,480 --> 03:02:42,480
I believe it's called Ditto Beat.

3811
03:02:42,480 --> 03:02:43,480
Yeah, something like that.

3812
03:02:43,480 --> 03:02:50,480
And he basically targeted mobile first because that's the one with the lowest amount of overhead and risk.

3813
03:02:50,480 --> 03:02:51,480
Sure.

3814
03:02:51,480 --> 03:02:56,480
Anybody, just about any couple of devs, a small dev team could easily turn out a mobile app.

3815
03:02:56,480 --> 03:03:00,480
Yeah, you're still taking a risk with time, but yeah, as far as the financial risk, yeah.

3816
03:03:00,480 --> 03:03:10,480
But the financial, the fiscal overhead is so low that you definitely don't need massive, you know, you don't need multimillion dollar budgets to pull it off.

3817
03:03:10,480 --> 03:03:14,480
You can do it with a simple bank loan or a small Kickstarter.

3818
03:03:14,480 --> 03:03:15,480
Right.

3819
03:03:15,480 --> 03:03:19,480
I mean, obviously you don't pay yourself, but you wait until you actually turn a profit.

3820
03:03:19,480 --> 03:03:20,480
Right, right.

3821
03:03:20,480 --> 03:03:22,480
In order to insure it.

3822
03:03:22,480 --> 03:03:26,480
But yeah, it's unfortunate. We kind of knew this was going to happen.

3823
03:03:26,480 --> 03:03:34,480
I remember talking to the guy who actually ran Program World back, you know, like many Otakons ago, you know, almost four years ago.

3824
03:03:34,480 --> 03:03:40,480
And he pretty much said that the day when he got to C and D from them is the day that they start winding down.

3825
03:03:40,480 --> 03:03:48,480
Because he kind of knew that once round one started expanding here that it was only a matter of time before they would find out.

3826
03:03:48,480 --> 03:03:49,480
Yeah.

3827
03:03:49,480 --> 03:03:52,480
All right. Well, my friend, I got to let you go so we can try to squeeze in one more call.

3828
03:03:52,480 --> 03:03:54,480
But thanks for the call, for lending your voice.

3829
03:03:54,480 --> 03:03:55,480
Yup.

3830
03:03:55,480 --> 03:03:56,480
All right.

3831
03:03:56,480 --> 03:03:57,480
Have a good night.

3832
03:03:57,480 --> 03:03:58,480
Take care.

3833
03:03:58,480 --> 03:03:59,480
Night.

3834
03:03:59,480 --> 03:04:16,480
All right.

3835
03:04:16,480 --> 03:04:17,480
Twat.

3836
03:04:17,480 --> 03:04:19,480
Loki, any last minute stories?

3837
03:04:19,480 --> 03:04:23,480
Yeah, they announced that Halo 5 is coming out October 27th.

3838
03:04:23,480 --> 03:04:25,480
Oh, wow. Was that just announced?

3839
03:04:25,480 --> 03:04:26,480
Yeah.

3840
03:04:26,480 --> 03:04:27,480
We somehow missed that.

3841
03:04:27,480 --> 03:04:28,480
All right. Well, there you go. Now we know.

3842
03:04:28,480 --> 03:04:31,480
We do have one more call here. Let's get to it. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

3843
03:04:31,480 --> 03:04:35,480
Hey, hey. It's a tired and exhausted Ranma.

3844
03:04:35,480 --> 03:04:38,480
Why are you tired and exhausted? Was there a con this weekend?

3845
03:04:38,480 --> 03:04:42,480
Yeah, that and I was stuck in Jersey for 30 minutes more than I should have been.

3846
03:04:42,480 --> 03:04:47,480
Oh, you poor thing. I wish our guest Gabriel from Jersey was still here to hear that.

3847
03:04:47,480 --> 03:04:49,480
Yeah.

3848
03:04:49,480 --> 03:04:51,480
Well, what con did you go to this week?

3849
03:04:52,480 --> 03:04:59,480
Zenkai Con. It's out in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. It's a nice hybrid of anime, fantasy, sci-fi, and all that cool stuff.

3850
03:04:59,480 --> 03:05:04,480
Isn't Lancaster, like, right in the heart of Dutch country? Or, no, I'm sorry. Amish Dutch country?

3851
03:05:04,480 --> 03:05:09,480
Yeah, you passed the giant Dutch wonderland going to the convention center.

3852
03:05:09,480 --> 03:05:10,480
That's awesome.

3853
03:05:10,480 --> 03:05:11,480
Yes.

3854
03:05:11,480 --> 03:05:17,480
So, you were out there with the Amish in your cosplays.

3855
03:05:17,480 --> 03:05:23,480
Well, no, actually, I saw them when we were in Walmart picking up stuff for The Room, but, you know.

3856
03:05:23,480 --> 03:05:27,480
Now, did somebody actually cosplay as the Amish to go to the con?

3857
03:05:27,480 --> 03:05:29,480
No, not to my knowledge.

3858
03:05:29,480 --> 03:05:33,480
God, people, do I have to do all the thinking for you? I'm just kidding.

3859
03:05:33,480 --> 03:05:37,480
All right, all those silliness aside, how was the con?

3860
03:05:37,480 --> 03:05:47,480
It was fun overall, despite, you know, the issues I had to deal with in The Room, you know, but other than that, made some great friends, had some good times.

3861
03:05:47,480 --> 03:05:56,480
One thing I love about this con, it's like a cool down convention for me. In between all the cons that I go to, this is where I can just go and relax and have a good time.

3862
03:05:56,480 --> 03:06:03,480
Nice. Good. Even though you're still worn out, but I know how that goes. You need a vacation from the vacation. I know exactly how that goes.

3863
03:06:03,480 --> 03:06:06,480
Even when I got home from Boston, I was like, I need another week off work to recover.

3864
03:06:06,480 --> 03:06:13,480
I know, right, but I didn't call in to talk about the con. There's a couple of things I wanted to cover real quick, then get the heck up and out of here.

3865
03:06:13,480 --> 03:06:14,480
Go for it.

3866
03:06:14,480 --> 03:06:21,480
Now, your guest I was on earlier, I was listening on the way in, and he was talking about the conventions and how they close early.

3867
03:06:21,480 --> 03:06:25,480
If I was able to call in right into the day, I would have called in, because here's the thing.

3868
03:06:25,480 --> 03:06:34,480
Conventions go, if there are conventions in the hotel, they will go all night long. Video rooms will either go to 3, 4 o'clock in the morning or all night.

3869
03:06:34,480 --> 03:06:45,480
The reason why some cons shut down at 2, 2.30, because they're in a convention center, and union contract says at 2 or 2.30, the convention center closes down.

3870
03:06:45,480 --> 03:06:47,480
There's no ifs, ands, or buts about that.

3871
03:06:47,480 --> 03:06:57,480
That's usually a hotel versus convention center thing, right? Because even Dragon Con, like the quote-unquote convention center, which I guess is America Mart or whatever, you know, is kind of that.

3872
03:06:57,480 --> 03:07:03,480
And that does close at like probably, I don't know, 10 o'clock or something, but the hotels, you know, go all night long.

3873
03:07:03,480 --> 03:07:12,480
So I think, and if I'm not mistaken, MAGFest is at a hotel, Dragon Con's at hotels, you know, so if you have a convention that's at a hotel, it's more likely to go all day, all night.

3874
03:07:12,480 --> 03:07:13,480
Whereas...

3875
03:07:13,480 --> 03:07:15,480
That's why AX was a combination of the two.

3876
03:07:15,480 --> 03:07:23,480
And what probably he was thinking about, because I told him, you know, we were making some difficult decisions at VOG, you know, are we going to do PAX East next year, are we going to do MAGFest next year?

3877
03:07:23,480 --> 03:07:30,480
And right now, we're pretty much at this point all in for MAGFest 2016 and not doing PAX East.

3878
03:07:30,480 --> 03:07:34,480
And I think that's probably where he was kind of noting, you know, PAX, they have to shut down.

3879
03:07:34,480 --> 03:07:43,480
You know, to be fair, though, PAX is in a convention center, but, you know, looking at that comparison, I don't know, PAX does not go all day, all night.

3880
03:07:44,480 --> 03:07:53,480
True, true, true. But then again, I do remember that one time I went to Fauna May and I stayed up till like 3 o'clock in the morning just to go to a, just to see a video presentation I wanted to see, so, you know.

3881
03:07:53,480 --> 03:08:01,480
Well, who needs sleep at a convention, says the 20-year-olds, and then the 30-year-olds are like, me.

3882
03:08:01,480 --> 03:08:06,480
See, at that point, that's when I'm like, you know what, I'm calling it a night at 4 AM.

3883
03:08:06,480 --> 03:08:12,480
I'm only having like five people in the room because I need, I like to stretch out, you know, get my sleep on.

3884
03:08:12,480 --> 03:08:16,480
The days of packing 8, 9, 10 people to a room are long gone.

3885
03:08:16,480 --> 03:08:26,480
That's even my, yeah, that's my thing is like I can't do that anymore, like all those people in a hotel room, like I'm like two people in the room, that's about it.

3886
03:08:26,480 --> 03:08:32,480
Or I will say GamerX, it was me, Alan, and Jamie in the room, and that was plenty.

3887
03:08:32,480 --> 03:08:37,480
Three people, three's a crowd, okay? That was, it was a good crowd, but that was it.

3888
03:08:38,480 --> 03:08:46,480
And DarkSakura, by the way, since you did have to sleep with two gay men, did we push an agenda on you? I'm just curious, did we push our agenda on you?

3889
03:08:46,480 --> 03:08:50,480
Well, I'm not interested in cock or anything, so.

3890
03:08:51,480 --> 03:09:05,480
Nope. Rob, seriously, and I've said this to people, if I ever had a problem with the gay agenda, I would not be able to do half the stuff I do at conventions.

3891
03:09:05,480 --> 03:09:10,480
I'd probably be a hunted person. I would not be able to go to cons, do the part, a lot of stuff, you know?

3892
03:09:10,480 --> 03:09:15,480
Because I look at this, I've hung out with gay people, I hang out with lesbians, it doesn't matter to me.

3893
03:09:15,480 --> 03:09:19,480
They get part, it's just as hard as straight people. It doesn't matter to me.

3894
03:09:19,480 --> 03:09:23,480
Yeah, I just, I like people. I just like people. That's it.

3895
03:09:23,480 --> 03:09:25,480
If you're a dick, you're just a dick, you know?

3896
03:09:25,480 --> 03:09:27,480
Alright, you said you had one other quick thing?

3897
03:09:27,480 --> 03:09:34,480
Yeah, I believe Bobby talked about this last PAX, and we talked about it on OLR.

3898
03:09:34,480 --> 03:09:40,480
That multi-function game, Artemis, where you're doing the spaceship simulation.

3899
03:09:40,480 --> 03:09:42,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3900
03:09:42,480 --> 03:09:48,480
I meant to say about this before, but Zekai Khan had a full room dedicated to Artemis running the whole weekend.

3901
03:09:48,480 --> 03:09:50,480
Oh, nice. Did you check that out? Did you play it?

3902
03:09:50,480 --> 03:09:56,480
I think it's just to play it, but I was gonna get some pictures, but let's just say it was a bit of a wait to get in there to play.

3903
03:09:56,480 --> 03:10:02,480
So I was like, I really couldn't wait around to get a chance to play, so you know.

3904
03:10:02,480 --> 03:10:06,480
Oh, I bet. Wow. Well, that sounds like fun. I gotta check that out.

3905
03:10:06,480 --> 03:10:09,480
It hasn't shown up at a con near me yet, but I'm hoping soon.

3906
03:10:09,480 --> 03:10:11,480
Well, I'll keep an eye out, you know.

3907
03:10:11,480 --> 03:10:14,480
Sounds good. Rama, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, alright?

3908
03:10:14,480 --> 03:10:15,480
No problem, bro.

3909
03:10:15,480 --> 03:10:16,480
Alright, take care my friend.

3910
03:10:16,480 --> 03:10:17,480
You too.

3911
03:10:17,480 --> 03:10:18,480
Alright, bye.

3912
03:10:18,480 --> 03:10:21,480
Well, that is about gonna do it for another episode of OLR.

3913
03:10:21,480 --> 03:10:25,480
Let me check in with Loki real quick for one other chance for last minute stories here.

3914
03:10:25,480 --> 03:10:26,480
No, that's it.

3915
03:10:26,480 --> 03:10:27,480
Alright, if you have a-

3916
03:10:27,480 --> 03:10:31,480
Those screenshots from Grand Theft Auto on the PC version look awesome.

3917
03:10:31,480 --> 03:10:32,480
Yeah, I know.

3918
03:10:32,480 --> 03:10:33,480
My PC can't run it.

3919
03:10:34,480 --> 03:10:36,480
Don't, you have to convince the guy to do one.

3920
03:10:36,480 --> 03:10:41,480
I'll just have to live it on, you know, just play it on one or four systems, I don't know.

3921
03:10:41,480 --> 03:10:42,480
There you go.

3922
03:10:42,480 --> 03:10:48,480
Alright, well, if you have something you want to say about tonight's show or any other show or something in general you want us to bring up,

3923
03:10:48,480 --> 03:10:54,480
like, you know, we had a topic in the mailbag tonight that wasn't on the agenda, just, you know, for whatever stories get slotted,

3924
03:10:54,480 --> 03:10:59,480
you can always email us, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

3925
03:10:59,480 --> 03:11:01,480
I do try to read the tweets throughout the week.

3926
03:11:01,480 --> 03:11:05,480
I know I've been really bad about addressing those on the show, but I do read all the tweets.

3927
03:11:05,480 --> 03:11:12,480
So, you know, you can always get my attention at OLR on Twitter or my personal Twitter as well, at SKIE.

3928
03:11:12,480 --> 03:11:16,480
Anyhow, that is the end of another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

3929
03:11:16,480 --> 03:11:18,480
We're running pretty long tonight, but what a great show.

3930
03:11:18,480 --> 03:11:25,480
I want to thank once again our friends from the Sacramento IGDA for joining us in studio tonight, Gabriel and Brianna.

3931
03:11:25,480 --> 03:11:28,480
Be sure to check us out on April 11th when we're broadcasting live.

3932
03:11:28,480 --> 03:11:38,480
And check out Gabriel's company, Crumple, the demo, which is available right now on Desura and soon, trademark.

3933
03:11:38,480 --> 03:11:42,480
I mean, not like next month, soon, but soon in the future on the Wii U as well.

3934
03:11:42,480 --> 03:11:43,480
So check that out.

3935
03:11:43,480 --> 03:11:52,480
As I say at the end of every episode of Orange Lounge Radio, you know, we're not some mega, huge, multi-million dollar company or website.

3936
03:11:52,480 --> 03:11:55,480
We're just a bunch of people doing this for fun because we like to do this for y'all.

3937
03:11:55,480 --> 03:11:57,480
We like to hang out with each other and talk to each other.

3938
03:11:57,480 --> 03:12:00,480
We like to hang out with you guys who show up for it every Sunday night.

3939
03:12:00,480 --> 03:12:04,480
So, you know, if you liked what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, I'm not going to ask for your money.

3940
03:12:04,480 --> 03:12:06,480
I just ask, spread the word.

3941
03:12:06,480 --> 03:12:11,480
Tell a friend or two about the show and help spread the word here about where every gamer has a voice.

3942
03:12:11,480 --> 03:12:15,480
Because if we don't know your voices out there, we can't put them out there.

3943
03:12:15,480 --> 03:12:20,480
I mean, how long did it take for me to meet this guy five blocks from my house that was making games?

3944
03:12:20,480 --> 03:12:29,480
Anyway, but, you know, spread the word and we can show up and get more indie developers and more game enthusiasts and everybody here on the show.

3945
03:12:29,480 --> 03:12:30,480
So help spread the word.

3946
03:12:30,480 --> 03:12:36,480
And if for whatever reason you can't think, you know, you can't think of five people to tell or you can't even think of one person to tell off the top of your head,

3947
03:12:36,480 --> 03:12:40,480
it would be great to leave us a five-star review on iTunes or Stitcher Radio.

3948
03:12:40,480 --> 03:12:45,480
Those reviews go a long way and we really appreciate that type of visibility as well.

3949
03:12:45,480 --> 03:12:48,480
For now, it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

3950
03:12:48,480 --> 03:12:50,480
DarkSakura, I see you're packing up and getting ready to go.

3951
03:12:50,480 --> 03:12:52,480
DarkSakura, your final thought tonight?

3952
03:12:52,480 --> 03:12:54,480
I'm tired of my nose.

3953
03:12:54,480 --> 03:12:55,480
Feel better.

3954
03:12:55,480 --> 03:12:57,480
Loki, your final thought tonight?

3955
03:12:57,480 --> 03:13:05,480
I'm just tired, but, you know, I have another game concept that my wife really wants me to work on.

3956
03:13:05,480 --> 03:13:09,480
I'm not doing it yet until I finish what I'm working on now.

3957
03:13:09,480 --> 03:13:11,480
You'll never hear the end of it if you start another one.

3958
03:13:11,480 --> 03:13:12,480
Alright.

3959
03:13:12,480 --> 03:13:13,480
I'm not going to.

3960
03:13:13,480 --> 03:13:14,480
Fair enough.

3961
03:13:14,480 --> 03:13:19,480
My final thought for the day is I almost bought a 60-inch television today

3962
03:13:19,480 --> 03:13:24,480
and I was just about to walk out the door at Sears until they told me,

3963
03:13:24,480 --> 03:13:29,480
oh, gee, you know that TV that's on display, we actually don't have any in stock at any store nearby,

3964
03:13:29,480 --> 03:13:32,480
nor can we do delivery when you do it online.

3965
03:13:32,480 --> 03:13:35,480
And they wouldn't sell you the display bottle?

3966
03:13:35,480 --> 03:13:41,480
And that is how Amazon got my purchase on a television that would have gone to Sears otherwise today,

3967
03:13:41,480 --> 03:13:43,480
so just some food for thought.

3968
03:13:45,480 --> 03:13:46,480
Just saying.

3969
03:13:46,480 --> 03:13:49,480
Anyway, but there's a 60-inch TV in my future.

3970
03:13:49,480 --> 03:13:50,480
Yes.

3971
03:13:50,480 --> 03:13:51,480
Finally.

3972
03:13:51,480 --> 03:13:55,480
I've been using that other TV way too long, so excited about that.

3973
03:13:55,480 --> 03:13:57,480
Anyway, have a great night, everybody.

3974
03:13:57,480 --> 03:14:01,480
We'll see you next week here on Orange Lounge Radio to do it all over again.

3975
03:14:01,480 --> 03:14:04,480
Thank you, everybody, for listening, whether it be live or on the podcast feed.

3976
03:14:04,480 --> 03:14:06,480
Thank you for sitting down at the table with us tonight.

3977
03:14:06,480 --> 03:14:07,480
