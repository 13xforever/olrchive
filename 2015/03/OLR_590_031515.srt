00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,400
This week, music gaming is bustled with news of an arcade upstart, giving waiting players

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,840
something to do, and the return of Rock Band coming to most of this generation's consoles

3
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,840
and more.

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,040
Join us for this, stories from PAX, as well as your comments, calls and more right now

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:31,560
on the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,960
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,480
where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:46,980
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with this episode 590 for Sunday, March 15th of 2015.

9
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,680
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me live in studio is Techmaster Loki.

10
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,680
How are you doing, Loki?

11
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,680
I'm doing okay.

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,840
I bought too much pizza.

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,640
But you brought a lot of pizza.

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,240
You actually had to unload pizza on me.

15
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,240
It doesn't always happen.

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:07,000
But it's Little Caesars and five bucks for a large pizza, so it's like, eh, why not?

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,200
Is there such a thing as too much pizza?

18
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,200
Almost.

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,720
I don't think they had them.

20
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,160
You know they have those hot and ready pizzas, so you just go ahead and pay money and they

21
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,940
just throw you a pizza instead of having to wait for them to cook it.

22
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,680
I don't know if they have those bacon-wrapped pizzas because they have their new, was it

23
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,600
bacon crust?

24
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,280
There might actually be a thing as too much bacon and that pizza sounds like it.

25
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,440
It's just wrapped in bacon.

26
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,600
I think it's just too much hype, to be honest, but I was going to try that.

27
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,600
Wait, food?

28
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,760
Too much hype?

29
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,760
In fast food?

30
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,360
I didn't actually want pizza, to be honest, but my first choice, despite their website

31
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,300
and their door hours saying that they should be open, they were closed, and so I had to

32
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,300
improvise.

33
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,100
Alright, it wouldn't be an episode of Orange Lounge Radio if we didn't talk about food

34
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,900
at the top of the show, but believe it or not, it is a show about video games.

35
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,980
But I do have to mention something on a serious note.

36
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:03,860
You'll notice I did not introduce Dark Sakura in the introductions tonight.

37
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,860
She's fine.

38
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,060
She'll be back on the show next week.

39
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,060
I had to ask her if I could get permission to share this because she did have a bit of

40
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,620
a personal crisis this week and I did get permission to share with you all what's going

41
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,420
on with Dark Sakura.

42
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:22,020
Dark Sakura was mentioned previously on the program about her upbringing in Mobile and

43
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,460
she shared a lot of stories with us about her family and so forth, and one of the people

44
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,700
I know that was very close to her in her upbringing that she talks about a lot on the show is

45
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,940
her grandma.

46
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:39,620
She's spoken very fondly about her grandma and has mentioned some medical issues that

47
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,700
her grandma was facing over the past few weeks here on the program.

48
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,660
Unfortunately last week, Dark Sakura's grandma did pass away.

49
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,740
So she had to go to Alabama at the drop of a hat to go be with her family.

50
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:57,260
So she left town, I think, on Thursday or Friday night and she won't be back until Thursday.

51
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,180
So I just want to pass that along to all you guys.

52
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,740
I know here at Orange and Ontario, we've been going for so long.

53
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:09,220
There's so many of you that show up week after week and support us, not just for the laughs,

54
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,980
but for all the things that we go personally deal with in our lives as well.

55
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,360
And if you have a minute to let Dark Sakura know you're sending some hugs, I know she

56
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,860
would really, really appreciate it.

57
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,880
So I just want to let you all know that's what was going on with Dark Sakura and she's

58
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,580
a Mobile, but she will be back on the show next week and we will move on with the show

59
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,260
as we always do.

60
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:34,300
That all being said, let's try to get into some video games and gaming, of course with

61
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:39,380
you guys live in the chat room as you are every week with us at live.vognetwork.com

62
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,660
where we do tape live at the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, every Sunday

63
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:49,380
night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show, which

64
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,340
we actually did some announcements in between the show tonight, but I will get back to that

65
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,020
in a little bit.

66
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,020
First off tonight, after welcoming all you guys in chat, and thank you, I see a lot of

67
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,580
kind words for Jamie's grandmother in chat, I will pass that along to her.

68
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,500
But those of you that follow her on Tumblr, Twitter, or even Facebook, I know she's got

69
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,340
a Facebook page, you might want to stop by there if you have a chance because I don't

70
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,980
think she'll be in the chat tonight considering they're three hours ahead and her schedule

71
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,900
is adjusted a little bit with her family, she's going to bed a little earlier when she's

72
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,900
out there.

73
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:24,300
Anyhow, let's bring the focus back to games a little bit.

74
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,420
We were not here last week because I was at PAX.

75
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:33,980
I went to Penny Arcade Expo, PAX East, which is the first time I've been to the show in

76
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,740
probably five years.

77
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,860
I went to the very first PAX East.

78
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,820
We all went to PAX, myself, Loki, and Dark Sakura all went to PAX in 2008.

79
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,700
That was a fun year because we actually got to broadcast live from the show floor, right?

80
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,700
That was fun.

81
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,700
That was a lot of fun.

82
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,460
And then 2010, we got to go to the show and had a lot of fun.

83
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:59,900
And this year, I went to the show as well, but it was a tough show this year.

84
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,140
The good news is, loved getting to see people.

85
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:07,620
Loved getting to see people I hardly ever get to see, but maybe once every five years

86
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,340
at these sorts of things.

87
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,020
The gals from Electric Sistahood, which shout out to their show because they had Bobby and

88
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:19,820
I on their show during PAX East, which we got to tape out in one of the hallways connecting

89
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,980
some of the rooms.

90
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,500
So that was really cool.

91
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,900
And just getting to meet up with some listeners and people that I know have been listening

92
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,900
to the show for a very long time.

93
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,220
I thought that was really cool.

94
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,420
But I got to say, there's a lot of frustrations as well that I've kind of been going through

95
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,940
with PAX East.

96
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:41,340
The fact that the show is very crowded and there was a line for everything did not exactly

97
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,900
help the situation.

98
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,900
And I get it.

99
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,580
Yeah, it's a big con.

100
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,180
It's a huge thing that happens.

101
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:52,020
But I mean, you would have these huge four-hour lines, I'm not even kidding, four-hour line

102
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,180
to do the Oculus Rift.

103
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,180
And they kept the line.

104
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,840
So it's like, you can't even really stand around to get in the line.

105
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,160
You have to kind of walk around the booth and maybe when you come back, you'll happen

106
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,800
to catch that 60-second window where you can jump in the line.

107
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,320
Bobby and I got to do this with Final Fantasy XIV.

108
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,320
We lucked out.

109
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,080
The line was capped, but we had actually turned around to go look at something else real quick.

110
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,600
And then we noticed that the guy wasn't standing there.

111
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,900
So we jumped in the line and immediately that Enforcer got back in the line behind us and

112
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,900
capped it again.

113
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:25,280
So we lucked out getting to do that Final Fantasy XIV thing where all I wanted was the

114
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,280
t-shirt.

115
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,520
All I wanted was the t-shirt that says, I beat Shiva.

116
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,420
So phew, we got the shirt and I didn't have to worry about that anymore, but that was

117
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,400
an hour wait just to play a game that I've already played online.

118
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,220
But I think part of the problem that a lot of the demos on the show floor are having

119
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:47,240
is that either A, they don't bring enough of it or B, the demos are a bit long.

120
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,180
I think a lot of companies are bringing demos that might be a bit long and it's not really

121
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,720
moving things along very quickly.

122
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,840
I will give a shout out to Harmonix though, the Amplitude demo, they kept people moving

123
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,840
pretty good.

124
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,120
And that was one of the better demos I actually played at the show was the Amplitude demo,

125
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,360
which I love me some music games, right?

126
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,520
So I got to play the Amplitude demo and that was a lot of fun and they can move four players

127
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:14,160
through every two minutes and that's a really good ratio compared to some of the boosts.

128
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,520
I will say though, to Paxi's credit, there really was a focus on indie this year and

129
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,880
that's always exciting to see and especially when the indie games themselves are getting

130
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,960
a huge line of people to play even those games.

131
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,120
I think we stood around for about 20, 30 minutes to play a game called Thumper, again because

132
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,120
it was kind of a game that had a really long demo.

133
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:38,440
It was by some former Harmonix devs, but I enjoyed the game and it was worth the wait

134
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,720
so I don't have anything negative to say about that.

135
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,720
But there was a lot of love for indie, although this could also be the fact that because GDC

136
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:56,760
was going on the exact same week that we could not get more of a AAA presence at Penny

137
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,760
Arcade Expo.

138
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:03,560
I sort of like the shows where it's like a little of the AAA's, a little of the like

139
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,880
A- and the Bs, and a little of the indies.

140
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:14,200
It's a great harmonious mix of all of them and Pax East, Pax East I think was missing

141
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,960
probably a few key players, probably because of the GDC thing.

142
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:24,360
Now they've moved it out a month next year, which Pax East really needs to do.

143
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,460
The snow thing and the weather, you know, I'm a West Coast guy and I get that a lot

144
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,040
of you think I'm a big wimp and so forth, but that was pretty brutal, some of the weather

145
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,960
while I was out there.

146
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,480
And it doesn't really help for the travel, getting around, just all the snow on the side

147
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,000
of the road and look out where you're walking because you might slip and fall in a puddle.

148
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,240
So they're moving it back a month next year, probably to get out of GDC's way and so that

149
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,680
snowmageddon can't happen to them again, which is good.

150
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,600
Really good because yeah, the weather doesn't help that situation.

151
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,240
And another thing that I have to admit kind of bothered me about Pax East and apologies

152
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,440
to my friends who are out there in the Northeast and who live in Boston, but that convention

153
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,860
center where they host Pax East at, man, that thing is a pain in the butt to get to travel-wise.

154
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,000
And especially considering that Boston is a city that doesn't really have the greatest

155
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,580
traffic to begin with, with all its streets that weren't really built for cars, right?

156
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,980
It already is a mess to begin with.

157
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:26,140
I mean, when you're waiting on the shuttle for an hour to get from your hotel to Pax,

158
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,900
which honestly we probably should have just walked faster, but we didn't think it would

159
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,140
be such a huge mess.

160
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,420
I mean, it just kind of says something about what a cluster that whole thing was out there.

161
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,980
So I actually liked it better when it was at the Heinz the first year that I went, even

162
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,740
though I realized it was a smaller show.

163
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,200
Here's the other thing that kind of, just to give you an idea where my mindset is at

164
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,860
with Pax.

165
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,220
I'm going to spill the tea on a little something and I'm going to be very honest and open about

166
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,860
something that frustrated me greatly and I know frustrated Bobby greatly.

167
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,160
And we've been dropping hints about this a little bit, but I'm going to tell you exactly

168
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,960
what went down with Pax East and why we've been a little bit frustrated and the fact

169
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,320
that the show was kind of a mess, for lack of a better term, doesn't exactly instill

170
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,980
confidence that I want to go back next year.

171
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:24,040
We were contacted about four months ago, Bobby and myself, to reprise a panel that we had

172
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:29,940
done at Dragon Con on starting a network with some other independent broadcasters.

173
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:35,600
So the point of this was to try and reprise this panel at Pax East, that this group was

174
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,980
going to submit to actually do this panel at Pax East.

175
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,060
Of course we were on board.

176
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,620
It sounded very exciting.

177
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:46,500
We love to enable more people to do independent broadcasting and start their own network and

178
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,500
so on.

179
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,820
So we said, sure, we'll do the panel.

180
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:56,140
And Bobby and I were talking a little bit off this email conversation and, well, what

181
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:57,780
if they don't pick up the panel?

182
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,900
Because we don't have any, and I'm using my quotey fingers here, star power on this

183
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,900
panel.

184
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:08,600
So the realization is the odds are that the panel will get picked up is pretty low.

185
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,700
But then we realized, well, okay, if we don't get into the show with this panel, then we

186
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,700
can certainly get in as media because we broadcast from the show floor in 2008.

187
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,700
We had that.

188
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,140
We did our thing in 2010 and had fun at the show there.

189
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,980
So we know that other podcasters that have got in as media and it's not a problem.

190
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,820
We won't have a problem with that.

191
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:33,100
So I booked my flight to Boston, Bobby got the hotel, and we're all ready to do Pax East.

192
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,820
And of course, this is long after the general admission tickets had already sold out because

193
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,820
you know, Pax sells out in 15 minutes, right?

194
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:47,540
So Bobby and I find out that we didn't get the panel, which we kind of saw that coming

195
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,540
unfortunately.

196
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,540
We would love to do it again.

197
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,540
But all right, it is what it is.

198
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:55,840
They want to focus on these big AAA developers hosting their panels, even ones that don't

199
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,260
have a booth on the show floor, at least they're showing up to do a panel so they give

200
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:02,600
this panel space to these AAA developers, whatever, fine.

201
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:08,960
So we decide to apply as media and we send them everything that they requested and we

202
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,720
get a form letter denial that we do not meet the criteria to get in as media.

203
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,200
What's interesting about this, Bobby and I submit our credentials together.

204
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,760
Bobby gets the denial for media and then I get at the exact same time, even though my

205
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:28,120
information was on page two, I get the exact same time, please submit your credentials.

206
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,320
So I send them the exact same thing that had been sent before a week later, get denied.

207
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:39,160
Both Bobby and I independently write to this email box to say, could we get more insight

208
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,480
as to why we were denied?

209
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,640
We meet the criteria.

210
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,080
We're fortunate enough that, you know, if you look at Stitcher Top 100, we're one of

211
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,640
the podcasts in there, very competitive with some offerings from like IGN and so forth.

212
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,640
And that's all thanks to you guys.

213
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,640
Thank you so much.

214
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:00,160
But, you know, we feel like we have enough of a listenership to kind of justify that

215
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,880
sort of access and keep this in mind because I don't want you guys to think, oh, this is

216
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,220
Rob just bitching that, you know, he's on a podcast and podcasts aren't media anyway,

217
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,800
because here's the other side to this.

218
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:19,460
We have peers that we know are getting into the show as media and we know other people

219
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:23,500
that have comparable listener bases and comparable, you know, stuff to us that are getting in

220
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,500
as media.

221
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,900
So we figure, well, if they're all getting in, then we shouldn't have a problem either.

222
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:32,420
We'll just pick up the phone and call them like we do with E3 and explain it and that

223
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,700
won't be a problem because that's exactly what happened with E3 last year.

224
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:42,000
Unfortunately, no telephone number, no response to our email, nothing.

225
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,780
We're not given a reason.

226
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,600
We're not given an explanation.

227
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,620
We're not given a chance to appeal.

228
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,660
We're not given a live person to contact for this.

229
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,980
Meanwhile, again, we talked to other podcasters.

230
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,860
We know our peers are getting in.

231
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,420
Our peers are getting emails answered.

232
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:08,220
Our peers are finding a way to, I guess, get a live human being to respond to something.

233
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,700
Again, Bobby and I had contacted independently.

234
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,700
Are we being ignored?

235
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,980
Yo, Pax, did I hurt your feelings?

236
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,980
It would be nice to know.

237
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,900
I mean, tell me, let's have a chat over coffee.

238
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,820
Let's see if we can hug it out a little bit.

239
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:28,460
I'd like to know because when you don't answer emails and you don't provide customer service,

240
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,460
that comes off as unprofessional.

241
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:34,360
Again, I want to reiterate this.

242
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,020
This is very important.

243
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,900
I am not complaining that I didn't get a media pass.

244
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:45,620
I am totally fine with that if the rules are consistent.

245
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:51,420
I believe I've presented enough examples here where I'm showing that it was not consistent.

246
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,640
That's what frustrates me greatly is that it was not consistent.

247
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:00,980
We weren't even given the cordial reply of, if they had replied back and said, sorry,

248
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,920
we were looking for X, you have Y, then you know what?

249
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,500
As long as I had my chance to kind of make my case and so forth that they were going

250
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,940
to stick with it, then fine, it is what it is.

251
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:15,380
Even though this is the same show where we were broadcasting from the show floor in 2008,

252
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,900
apparently it was media then.

253
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:22,180
With a much smaller listenership at that time, I'm assuming as well.

254
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,580
Right?

255
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:28,980
So anyway, that left a sour taste in my mouth, which you probably could tell over the past

256
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,500
couple of weeks in the show.

257
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,500
But you know what?

258
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,500
Damn it.

259
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,220
I knew there were people that were going to the show that I wanted to see, and one of

260
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,700
our listeners, Hitstun Awesome, came through for us because I was getting ready to cancel

261
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,700
the flight.

262
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,700
And he said, you know what?

263
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,660
I have these extra passes and I'm more than happy to sell them to you at face value and

264
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,780
you can go to the show.

265
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:52,680
I wouldn't play in that scalping game, but our listeners are good enough to not be scalpers.

266
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,300
So I decided, you know what, fine, I will pay the money to get these tickets and I'll

267
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,300
go to the show.

268
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,900
I flew out there on my own dollar and all this stuff.

269
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,780
You know, it is an independent pilot.

270
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:10,180
There's no first class jet or expense, you know, it's my money I used to fly out there

271
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:15,580
and I'm telling you, I don't see a reason ever again to spend that kind of money to

272
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,500
go to a show like that.

273
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,540
The lone exception being that I could see my friends again.

274
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:26,700
However, I have a pretty good suspicion that if I go to some different cons out on the

275
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,900
East Coast, such as Dragon Con, which I will continue to support.

276
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,020
Dragon Con is kind of its own thing because Dragon Con isn't an expo so much as it is

277
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:39,180
a convention and it's like 20 small conventions all taking place at the same time.

278
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,420
And Dragon Con replies to their emails, so that's one thing.

279
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,500
You know, I'll continue to do stuff with that.

280
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,700
I'm very interested in doing MAGFest next year.

281
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,260
I love the Rockage event out here on the West Coast, so I'm looking forward very much to

282
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,540
doing MAGFest on the East Coast.

283
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,700
I want to do that next time and I think I'll get to see a lot of the OLR and VOG people

284
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,700
out there, so that's fine.

285
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,180
But as far as PAX goes, kind of done.

286
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,720
And I just, again, while we're spilling tea, can I just say one more thing here?

287
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,000
There's a lot of perception out there that, well, what does that media access get you,

288
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,160
Rob Roberts?

289
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,240
Why do you even care about the media access?

290
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,220
Because PAX is the show where media is treated no differently than the general public, save

291
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:21,960
maybe they get to go on the expo floor one hour sooner.

292
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,780
Wrong!

293
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,840
That is wrong!

294
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:29,000
That changed quietly a few years ago.

295
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Y'all didn't notice.

296
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Oh, when did that change?

297
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,640
Well, about the time that Penny Arcade outsourced that expo to that new vendor who runs it on

298
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:43,480
their behalf and has expanded it into a brand that runs PAX South and now PAX Australia,

299
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:51,160
the brand that cannot be bothered to reply to emails.

300
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,360
There are appointments to be made at Boos to see games that are not out on the floor

301
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,600
for the general public.

302
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,880
There are things being shown in hotel rooms, much like they are at E3, that, again, cannot

303
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,520
be seen with the general public.

304
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:09,020
If you think that PAX is this open, I get to see everything there, sorry, that changed

305
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,620
a few years ago.

306
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,740
But I do think it's still cool that PAX has a lot of board games and card games and bring

307
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,120
your own computer and other stuff that kind of mixes it up a little bit.

308
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:24,760
But as far as the bang for my buck, I'm spending it elsewhere in the future.

309
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,720
Did you want to ask me anything about PAX East, Loki?

310
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,040
Did you get to play Rock Band?

311
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,360
No, they didn't bring it.

312
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,360
They didn't have it.

313
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,360
How's Amplitude?

314
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,680
Amplitude was fun.

315
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,680
I liked it.

316
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,680
It was good.

317
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,680
It was a good time.

318
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,960
I played a lot of music games because there was Thumper, Kyle Ward was there showing off

319
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,960
what he's doing on the Android tablets with DittoBeat and Rerave Plus.

320
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,600
He's going to come on the show next month, by the way.

321
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,800
I'm very excited to have him.

322
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:53,580
He's a longtime music game community guy, and we got to talk and dish a little bit about

323
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:57,660
some of the things going on, and he is going to absolutely come on the show and promote

324
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,020
that stuff in the future.

325
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,020
So looking forward to that.

326
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,020
Cool.

327
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,020
Yep.

328
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,540
So anyway, that's my little story about PAX East.

329
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:08,340
Otherwise, there are some other little things that were kind of fun, like I enjoyed going

330
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:13,380
to the classic game room and getting Bobby Blackwolf to play the guardian legend for

331
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,380
the first time.

332
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,380
That was a lot of fun.

333
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:20,140
And just getting to play Kid Icarus on a Nintendo with an NES controller.

334
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:23,860
I haven't done that in a very long time because I don't have a working Nintendo.

335
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:28,020
So yeah, it was awesome to get to do that all over again.

336
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,020
And again, see people.

337
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,620
You know, we got to go to dinner one night with a couple people from VoG, and that was

338
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,620
really cool.

339
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:38,820
SSG100Matt, whose girlfriend lives out in the area, knows Boston very well, took us

340
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,620
out to Harvard, and we went to a brewery over there, and that was a lot of fun.

341
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:48,220
In fact, SSG100Matt is in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com saying, the first PAX

342
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,420
East wasn't bad.

343
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,980
I still like that more than the previous ones.

344
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:57,060
Me too, I had a great time at the first PAX East, but again, that was before they outsourced

345
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,100
it, but anyway.

346
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:04,340
Let's see, over at live.vognetwork.com, YYR says, Magfest will definitely get the bad

347
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,060
taste out of your mouth.

348
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,460
And SSG100Matt saying, Magfest is where it's at.

349
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,460
I can't praise it enough.

350
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,300
So yeah, it seems like people are loving that.

351
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,220
And Kaijuto saying, Dragon Con has real dragon transportation.

352
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:22,180
Yeah, well Dragon Con's a lot easier to get around because they hold it downtown at all

353
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,540
these different hotels, they're all interconnected, and even if they're not, there's a lot of

354
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,540
shuttle service.

355
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,740
I don't hear about a lot of these same problems at Dragon Con.

356
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:35,380
So Dragon Con will be like the one big show that I do here, but from now on, I totally

357
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:42,820
plan to focus on more like small and mid-level gaming expos, where there's more to do.

358
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:48,300
Just to put this in perspective, I played more games, actual games.

359
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:54,180
I got my hands on more games at Rockage in San Jose, which was one, actually, I was there

360
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,220
for only one day.

361
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,220
That event was multiple days.

362
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,900
I was there for one day and played more games than I did the three days at PAX East.

363
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,980
Just food for thought.

364
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:08,060
Anyhow, I'm not just here to bitch and complain, but a lot of you guys have been asking me

365
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:12,460
questions about what's going on, why have you been subtly side-eyeing this whole thing?

366
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,460
So there it is.

367
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,900
I've laid it all out on the table.

368
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,900
Take what you will from it.

369
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:22,900
I will, to turn this into a positive, though, before the show tonight, getting into housekeeping

370
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:28,120
a little bit here as well, before the show tonight, Bobby and I and Loki made some announcements

371
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,660
about what's going on with VOG Network.

372
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:34,860
So first off, great news, we'd like to welcome the Geek Card to VOG Network, yay, hosted

373
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:42,060
by Razorbug, Rob, and Sil over in the UK about various things in geek culture, video games,

374
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:45,660
television and so forth, so get your Geek Card stamped with them every week, so welcome

375
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,780
then to the network.

376
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:51,340
And we also talked about how we're not doing E3 this year, for very similar reasons that

377
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:56,820
I've just vented to you about with PAX, E3's also going down this whole of, why am I going

378
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:02,800
to spend all this money to go to E3 just to maybe have appointments, maybe, if I'm lucky

379
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:09,220
and I beg, and we can make people understand what a podcast is, even though cereal is huge

380
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,220
right now.

381
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:15,300
If we can get an appointment to see the exact same thing that they're streaming on Twitch

382
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:21,780
TV at 3 o'clock, you know, I just, I'm not sure the money is justified to spend to go

383
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:29,060
to something like E3 when that is money that we could spend to get table space at a medium

384
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:36,420
or small convention like GamerX, like Magfest, like, you know, something else.

385
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,900
California Stream I get to go to this year, I don't know if we're doing anything with

386
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,820
that yet, but maybe, I hope to, I'm going to ask that question.

387
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,860
One other exciting announcement, I'm very excited about this because this is a local

388
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:51,140
organization, but they're doing things on an international scale, and that is the Sacramento

389
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:56,260
branch of the International Game Developers Association, and the Sac IGDA is actually

390
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:04,300
hosting an event here locally on April 11th, and we are going to be broadcasting from that

391
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:10,140
event live all day from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., actually going to be broadcasting from that,

392
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,660
and you guys will be able to ask questions with some of the developers that we'll be

393
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:17,260
sitting down with, and you might think, well, oh, if it's Sacramento, then I don't live

394
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:23,420
there, am I, well, these games are all games that are trying to get noticed more on a national

395
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:27,500
scale so they can be distributed on things like DeSoura, as some of them are actually

396
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:33,580
getting exposure on, and, you know, other national platforms, so it's not like, you

397
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,900
know, in this day and age of the internet, you won't be able to check out a lot of these

398
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,340
games for yourself that we're actually going to be talking about on the show, on that live

399
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,340
broadcast.

400
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:49,860
So VOG Network with us from OLR will be broadcasting from the Sacramento Indie Arcade Gaming Expo

401
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:54,220
at the Colonial Cafe in the colony next door on Saturday, April 11th.

402
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:58,380
If you happen to be local in the area, you should probably come on down and say hello.

403
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,100
So that was, that's something very exciting to announce.

404
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:08,660
You see, see, and I, I bet, I bet we'll talk to 10 times as many developers at that than

405
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:16,940
I have at any other show, and I have to spend $5 on gas to get over there.

406
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,940
If that.

407
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,780
Isn't that a better use of money?

408
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,780
I think so.

409
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,620
So I'm excited about that.

410
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,660
Loki, you were already talking about going to this and then all of a sudden it's, hey,

411
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,660
guess what?

412
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,260
We're going to be, we're going to be broadcasting from it.

413
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,340
Uh, hopefully I can still go to it.

414
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,380
I'm hoping I can.

415
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,380
No, I'm hoping you can too.

416
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,700
It won't be the same without you.

417
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,220
So, all right.

418
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,220
Anyhow.

419
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,220
Uh, there you go.

420
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,780
That's, that's our housekeeping and, and everything we're going to talk about at the top of the

421
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,620
show, except of course, how we always start off the show here at Orange Launch Radio,

422
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,140
talking out a little bit about our gaming weeks.

423
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,340
Loki, how was your gaming week?

424
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,940
Uh, my gaming week was, I didn't play really anything.

425
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,060
I was just been working on my game.

426
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,060
In fact, it's weird.

427
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:58,820
I had a bug creep up on me that I've already had fixed, so I'm not sure how it came back

428
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:02,820
and even looking at the code, it doesn't make any sense because it should work and

429
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,140
yet it's not working.

430
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,660
So I'm trying to figure out why that is.

431
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:12,620
Well, if you can ever finish a darn game that you work on, Loki, maybe you can join the

432
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:16,020
SAC IJCA and maybe show at the show.

433
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,020
Wouldn't that be something?

434
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:20,500
Uh, you might miss the deadline for the submissions, but maybe next year.

435
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,500
Nope.

436
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,740
Figured it out what it is just now.

437
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,620
We just now, wait, you just, you squashed a bug in your head as you were complaining

438
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,620
about it?

439
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:31,380
I'm hitting the collider that's on the car that I put there because I replaced the colliders

440
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:37,460
on there and so I don't have it on a masking layer and so it's hitting the car's own collider

441
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,740
and that's why it thinks it's still on the ground.

442
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,740
Ah, I'm so stupid.

443
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,180
Anyways, but that'll be fixed today.

444
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:48,380
No, but really the whole thing I was working on this week was getting the car model they

445
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:53,420
had was originally this kind of stand-in thing and now I have an actual car model on there

446
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,860
and it looks fancy and everything.

447
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:00,340
It matches the style of the game and what else did I do?

448
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,820
That was pretty much it.

449
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,220
I was just really tired this week.

450
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,380
A lot of it was trying to catch up on sleep and I got really distracted by CinemaSins

451
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,380
this week.

452
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:14,740
I watched way too many of those videos, but mostly because I was so tired I couldn't concentrate

453
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:20,660
to work on stuff and so I just, I don't know, I just kind of slacked off a little bit.

454
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:27,220
I played a little bit of LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, but less than a minute, just very

455
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,220
little.

456
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,140
And I really meant to play DJ Hero this week.

457
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:36,260
I just, once again, too lazy to go dig out the turntables in the other room and set up

458
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:41,620
my Xbox 360 because it's not currently set up and finding the disc, wherever the hell

459
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,860
that is.

460
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,500
So yeah, but I want to.

461
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:51,860
I still want to play that and maybe something on my Steam library, I've been kind of digging

462
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,860
through that a little bit.

463
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,860
I don't know.

464
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,500
It's just been kind of slacking off a week.

465
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,980
Hopefully it'll be a little more productive.

466
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,020
Well, if you've been working on the game, you know, working on a game is likely.

467
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:05,460
My goal was trying to have, you know, the game at least another level built and I still

468
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,260
very well can have another level built.

469
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:11,740
I'm just kind of tweaking the car a bit just to make sure that it works fine because in

470
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:16,180
order to make the other levels, I have to basically duplicate this start level that

471
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,300
I have and then change stuff in it.

472
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:22,520
And if I make a change to something outside of that, then I've got to change it in every

473
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,260
single level that I make afterwards.

474
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:30,300
And it's just better to get all of those things fixed first and then do, you know, do the

475
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,300
car stuff.

476
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,460
But I don't know.

477
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,660
That's it.

478
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,500
Anything that you think you might get to play in the next week?

479
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,760
Well, the game's quite playable.

480
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,400
My son played it for a good 20 minutes today.

481
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,160
I just, you know, I have to jump on past, you know, one of the checkpoints, basically

482
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,060
a game breaking bug.

483
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:55,200
And so I get him past that little ring and he can drive around with however he wants

484
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,320
and it works just fine.

485
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,780
So that was the thing.

486
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,960
So he's been playing with that and it works.

487
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
I don't know.

488
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,380
All right.

489
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,320
So I'll just work on a little more.

490
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,400
I'm, since I didn't get a level done this week, that means I got to get two done next

491
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,400
week.

492
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,400
All right.

493
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,200
Well, my gaming week, you know, I talked about some of the stuff I played at PAX already.

494
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,620
So outside of the expo, of course, I did a little playing of like Theatrhythm and Fantasy

495
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:26,360
Life on the flight and those good old standby 3DS games, right?

496
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,560
And then when I got home, I've been playing some of the usual stuff, Diablo 3, because

497
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,720
Alan is still super into Diablo 3.

498
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,120
He's like Paragon 350 plus at this point, I think.

499
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,120
I don't know.

500
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,120
I'd have to ask him.

501
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,680
But I know that doesn't mean anything to you, Loki, but that's a lot.

502
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,960
That's like 350 levels in a game.

503
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,960
That's a lot.

504
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,960
That's a lot.

505
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,540
But, you know, it's what he loves doing right now.

506
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,540
So that's cool.

507
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,640
I'm up to Paragon 140, I think at this point.

508
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,120
So I'm lagging behind a little bit, but I'm able to run Torment 6's with him and stay

509
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,120
alive with my move.

510
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,760
So are they like, does the difficulty ramp up as you level up or you just become all

511
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,440
godlike and just be able to like squash anything?

512
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:05,040
Well, the set difficulties in the game are like, you know, like normal, master, hard,

513
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,360
like all the way up through Torment 6.

514
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,480
And you do get to a point where even in Torment 6, you're pretty much face rolling a lot of

515
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,480
the rifts and all this.

516
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,840
But here's what happened.

517
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,960
Here's what happens is that when you beat a rift, most of the time you'll get what's

518
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,960
called a keystone.

519
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,220
And that keystone allows you to enter a greater rift.

520
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:28,480
And the greater rift starts with a trial where you just fight these mobs over and over again.

521
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,480
They get harder and harder and harder and they respawn in these different waves.

522
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:39,000
And if you get to about wave 25, you're running the equivalent of a Torment 6.

523
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,800
But the numbers go higher than 25.

524
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,600
In fact, I believe they go all the way up to 50, maybe 60.

525
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,600
I don't know.

526
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,120
This is probably more of an Alan question.

527
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,880
Maybe he's listening and can run out here and tell me.

528
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,520
So once you get the keystone, then you actually run a rift at that level.

529
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,280
So let me tell you, even though like Alan is that level I told you he's at, he's still

530
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,160
banging his head on, I think Torment 37 right now.

531
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,000
So there's still a lot of room for him to grow beyond what he's doing.

532
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,160
So that's kind of what the end game ends up being.

533
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,680
But I mean, it is still Diablo.

534
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,740
It's a dungeon crawler.

535
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,160
It's a click loot fest.

536
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,360
But there's something very zen about it.

537
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,360
Just sitting down and playing.

538
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,720
And then, you know, you get to play with friends and you get more experience when you play

539
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,860
with friends and so forth.

540
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,860
So that's exciting.

541
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:23,720
I tried playing Clicker Heroes this week just to see because I haven't looked at it in months

542
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,960
and it won't even open anymore.

543
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,960
What?

544
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,400
Yeah, it won't even open on my computer.

545
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,400
Oh no.

546
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,640
I was like, okay, well I guess I'm done with that.

547
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,920
Um, let's see, anyway, um, what was I going to say?

548
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:43,120
Outside of Diablo 3, also a little more Final Fantasy XIV, because I didn't even mention

549
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,860
we did this at Penny Arcade Expo.

550
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:49,560
The one panel we did stand in a line to get in a line, even though you're not supposed

551
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,400
to do that, everyone does it anyway, but we stood in a line to get into the line to get

552
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:58,440
into the Final Fantasy XIV panel where they showed all the information about the expansion,

553
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,720
all the new outfits for the different jobs, and announced the release date of June 23rd.

554
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,520
Our birthday, here at OLR, so how appropriate, right?

555
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,840
So Heavens War, the expansion's coming out June 23rd.

556
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,840
So we actually did that panel.

557
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,280
So of course it kind of got me a little more enthused for Final Fantasy XIV, so I came

558
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,160
home and I played a lot of that as well.

559
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,980
But I did play new stuff, guys, in fact I played a game that I really should have played

560
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:27,920
three months ago, four months ago, when it was first free on PlayStation Plus, and I

561
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,120
downloaded it, and I really should have played it then.

562
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:34,160
I don't know why I didn't, I just, probably game overload, or I was sucked into my MMOs

563
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,160
or something.

564
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,440
But Flaco Jones had told me about four or five different times, Rob, you need to play

565
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,800
Velocity 2X, you need to play this game.

566
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,040
So finally, I decided to sit down and play it this week.

567
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:50,020
I think his most recent tweet yelling at me about this finally resonated in my head.

568
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,920
So I went in and I played the game, and I love it.

569
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,400
It's so, it's great.

570
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:59,880
It's like, you know, and Flaco was saying that I would really like it because every

571
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,320
time I talk about the Guardian Legend and how it's like half a shooter game, half like

572
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,780
a Zelda adventure exploration game, he's like, that's Velocity, you need to play Velocity.

573
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:12,480
And it kind of is, I mean, Velocity definitely has the shooter, and more like a side-scrolling

574
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:19,700
platformer, whereas, whereas Guardian Legend is more like a Zelda slash shooter, I would

575
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:24,960
say Velocity is more like a Rayman slash shooter type of thing, but definitely encourages and

576
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:30,000
embraces speedrunning because, you know, it's, at the end of each level, of which I think

577
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,360
there's 50 levels in the game, at the end of each level, you're evaluated and you get

578
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,360
a medal on how fast did you do it, how many of the possible survivor capsules did you

579
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:42,920
pick up, how many of the possible crystals did you pick up, and how much out of the total

580
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:46,960
possible score did you get by killing every monster that's in the level and so forth.

581
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:53,220
So you get evaluated on all that, and if you want a perfect, which of course, if you obsess

582
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:58,620
over not missing anything in your games like I do, then you obsess about getting a perfect,

583
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,980
but if you want a perfect medal, you gotta do all those things at the same time in one

584
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:07,820
run-through. Get a very fast time and collect everything. So it really, like, presents a

585
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:13,740
challenge, and, you know, it's a good-looking game, even though the graphics don't exactly

586
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,900
push the envelope of the PlayStation 4, it's probably the type of game that could have

587
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,980
been on PlayStation 3, in fact, I believe it is, and there's probably not much of a

588
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:24,380
difference between PS3 and PS4 versions. Still, at the end of the day, it's about

589
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:29,460
fun, and the graphic style suits the game, and it's a lot of fun. I go back and I play

590
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:35,140
levels over and over to try to better my score, and the soundtrack is so good. The soundtrack

591
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:41,860
is, like, Commodore 64-influenced. So, like, again, credit to you, Flaco Jones, because

592
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:45,220
like three or four months ago, you were telling me, Rob, this is like a perfect game for you,

593
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:49,300
why are you not playing this game? And he was right. He was right. I don't know why

594
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:53,180
I didn't. Just sometimes, sometimes you're like, oh, but no new games right now, because

595
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:57,820
I got to get my palette into max level and 14. But I'm so happy I checked out Velocity

596
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:01,460
2X. That's a lot of fun, and I'll probably be playing that more in the coming weeks.

597
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:05,620
So, if you didn't pick up that game on PlayStation Plus, I would say it's still worth your money

598
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:11,740
to check it out. So, that was my gaming week. Since we already went through our housekeeping

599
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:16,140
notes for the night, I will mention we are on Twitter, twitter.com slash O-L-R. We're

600
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:20,340
on Facebook and Google Plus as well. Facebook dot com slash Orange Lounge Radio. Google

601
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:26,380
dot com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio. Let's get into some gaming news. Usually, we would

602
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:32,140
do like a last week's news set to Holic, but there was kind of a few big stories that require

603
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:35,900
a little more attention. So, let's get into some highlights from last week, Loki.

604
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,580
So, the big one, which we kind of knew was going to happen, or at least thought it would

605
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:44,260
happen was Rock Band 4 was announced, and they announced it for PlayStation 4 and Xbox

606
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:52,820
One. Haven't really slated exactly when it's going to be coming out, but looks pretty awesome.

607
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:58,060
It's got a new set of instruments, which honestly look just like the old set of instruments,

608
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:06,940
but I don't know. Apparently, though, they are looking at trying to take the support

609
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:11,740
that you had, because a lot of people really were into Rock Band on Xbox 360 and PlayStation

610
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:17,700
3, and so they're having ways that you can import your songs that you bought on PlayStation

611
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:26,300
3 or Xbox 360 to your consoles. I'm hoping that that's cross platform, but I don't think

612
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,860
so. I think it's Xbox 360 to Xbox One. No, I think they even said in an FAQ, it's

613
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:35,260
not cross platform because of the rules of the different stores, which, yeah, I think

614
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:41,460
you, me, a lot of people are sitting out there going, Rock Band 4 might have just sold me

615
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:47,740
an Xbox One. I know that's where I'm at. Not that I didn't want one anyway. I already

616
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:52,400
wanted an Xbox One for other reasons, but now I'm sitting here going, yeah, by the time

617
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,180
Rock Band 4 comes out, I'm going to need an Xbox One, because I'm not losing that library

618
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:02,140
of songs. Yeah, exactly. And the other thing, too, is that there's supposed to be maybe

619
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:08,780
support for the old instruments as well. I hope so, because damn, I have a full set of

620
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:12,720
instruments on the Xbox 360, and that's kind of the thing with me. It's like, I don't play

621
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:19,820
a ton of Rock Band right now, or pretty much at all anymore, and I am not buying another

622
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:24,920
set of instruments for Rock Band 4. So, I hope that that's the case, because otherwise

623
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,860
I probably just won't pick it up. I think they said that they're trying solutions right

624
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:31,180
now. They don't have a definitive answer, but they're working on it. I would be fine

625
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:35,380
with like a third party mod type situation where, you know, you have some sort of devices

626
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:39,060
that allow it to run on other consoles or something like that. Yeah, YYR summarizes

627
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:43,380
it in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com, saying, controller compatibility is not guaranteed,

628
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:47,700
but they said they're looking into it. ActDeft was some very strong words here, saying, Rock

629
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:53,500
Band 4 defined what next gen console I'm getting. Xbox One for me now. So, very interesting

630
00:36:53,500 --> 00:37:00,140
that this is the game that is going to cement the next gen for a lot of people. Yeah. Microsoft

631
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:05,300
should be like, not only has Harmonix really been supporting the Kinect, when like, literally

632
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:10,540
nobody else has, like, Microsoft should be sending Harmonix a dozen roses every day.

633
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:16,220
I mean, really. And chocolates. And like, whatever they want. A pony. And then fortunately

634
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:23,180
there will not be an Xbox, or a Wii U version of that game, because EA, I'm assuming is

635
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:28,620
publishing it again, and EA fucking hates the Wii U, so, sorry. No Rock Band on the

636
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:34,540
Wii U. Well, are they necessarily publishing it? There's no... I don't think anything's

637
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:37,620
been said on that. I don't think anything's been said, but... There's also no MTV Games

638
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,820
in the picture anymore, so a lot could be different. I would be willing to bet that

639
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:45,380
EA is probably publishing that. Alright. That'd be interesting to see. I mean, I'm guessing.

640
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:51,740
I don't know who else would be. Maybe Self. Who knows? They could do it. No. I doubt it.

641
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:57,280
Well, we'll see. We'll see. But, well, I think also just the mere fact is, if they're developing

642
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:05,480
it for next gen, Wii U runs on current gen, right? Or are they doing Rock Band 4 on Playstation

643
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:11,840
3 and Xbox 360 as well? Well, the question was, you know, why not on Wii or Wii U or

644
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:16,640
PC? It says due to shifting production priorities and capabilities of studios, we don't currently

645
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:21,200
have any plans to release Rock Band 4 on the Wii or Wii U or PC simultaneously with Xbox

646
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:29,240
1 and Playstation 4. Bobby in our chat room is clarifying that EA doesn't publish Rock

647
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:34,120
Band 3 anymore. Mad Catz publishes it now. There's no EA splash screen anymore. And act

648
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:38,120
deaf to jumping in saying Mad Catz is doing it as well. Oh, that's right. They make the

649
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:42,280
instruments, so. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. They had that whole thing. I am a little sad

650
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:47,040
that they eliminated keyboards. I, you know, I think we all saw it coming, so I can't like

651
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,360
be upset, and I don't want to be one of those gamershateeverything.com types of people,

652
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:57,600
but yeah, I'm still a little sad. Especially if the old tracks are gonna work. Like, it'd

653
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:02,400
be nice. It'd be nice. It'd be nice just to have that support there, not necessarily new

654
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,480
songs supporting it, but like the old songs would be nice. Yeah, that's, I would like

655
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,320
to see that as well, but. But why put it in if you're not gonna support it in new songs?

656
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:16,320
Keyboards clearly did not do too well, but this, I just, I am expressing my grievance.

657
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,040
I would like it to be aired, and that's that. So, we'll move on and just hope there are

658
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,160
other exciting things. I think it's cool that it's coming out. Just, you know, once again,

659
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,280
I'm kind of, I'm a little over the whole like, ooh, it's a music game, gotta pick it up and

660
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,200
support it. Now it's like, yeah, I've supported it enough with all the crap that's in my garage

661
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,880
and on my, you know, Xbox 360. Well, I mean, they really, I mean, besides the fact that

662
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,840
they've said it's coming, we really haven't seen anything about it. We don't have a screenshot

663
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:46,360
at all. We don't really have anything else to go off of. So, but I mean, that's, that's

664
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,720
also a good thing because that means there might be new play modes and new things in

665
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:54,000
the game. And I've, I've talked about on the show before how I think social and this new

666
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,440
day and age of social gaming we live in is gonna really drive Rock Band 4. We don't know

667
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,000
any of that stuff. And I imagine that's what they're keeping in their hat until E3 that

668
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,100
they can put out there on the Twitch stream or by appointment, you know. We will see more

669
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:11,640
information about what's happening with that. Yeah. So I'm sure it'll be at E3. I'm sure

670
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:16,600
it will too. And Bobby Blackwell in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com saying, I want

671
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,880
stage kit compatibility. I agree. I still want one of those stage kits, even though

672
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,600
that'd be a complete waste of money at this point. You could probably get them really

673
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:31,160
cheap now. All right. Also in last week's news, speaking of EA, I'm sure many of you

674
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:36,520
caught wind of this, even though this happened during GDC. And I don't know if that was an

675
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:41,280
attempt to not have this show up on the radar, but in this day and age of the internet, when

676
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:47,480
you try really hard to have something not show up on the radar, guess what? It elevates

677
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:53,460
it to people's radar that much more. And that's what happened when news came out that EA has

678
00:40:53,460 --> 00:41:03,040
closed Maxis. Maxis behind the Sims 4 and of course the ill-fated SimCity reboot that

679
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:08,960
happened a couple years ago that, you know, didn't, it wasn't received too well because

680
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,040
of the always online component that not everybody was on board for. Well, and even like SimCity

681
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:18,280
or the Sims 4, like with all the removed features and stuff in there, it's like, come on. You

682
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:23,880
know, I mean, I have a hard time believing it was just Maxis going, you know, this is

683
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,800
going to be a good idea. I can't, I can't help but think that EA kind of pushed them

684
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:33,140
to do certain things that they did in that. That's, that's the other thing that's kind

685
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:39,700
of interesting or crazy to me and all this is that, you know, Maxis, you know, ate a

686
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:44,460
lot of controversy with the SimCity thing. And I don't know, when I still think of Maxis,

687
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,620
I have a very soft space in my heart because I think of all those amazing Sim games from

688
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:53,380
the nineties, like the original SimCity, even SimCity 2000, even though I didn't like that

689
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:59,100
one as much, but I know a lot of people did, but I think of things like SimAnt, SimEarth,

690
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:04,460
SimTower. I loved all those games and man, that was the heyday. And unfortunately, you

691
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:09,660
know, now they started going in this direction with the, the SimCity and I wasn't a big fan

692
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:14,040
of the whole always online thing because I think a lot of us, why did we love SimCity

693
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:18,820
the original? Cheat codes and making Godzilla appear whenever you want by typing certain

694
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:23,300
things in the keyboard. But in this day and age, and the way EA's model has been as of

695
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:29,400
late is now you can pay money to unlock all that. And people were not having that, but

696
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:37,640
I feel like that is part of EA's culture, not Maxis' culture. So there's something very

697
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:45,060
odd to me about the reason that that game flopped was probably more EA's influence than

698
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:51,500
anybody else. And so that's, what's very frustrating about this news, you know, and again, I'm

699
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:56,460
just sitting here in my spare room in Sacramento commentating on what I see. I don't know how

700
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:01,140
it works on the inside, but I still can't help but feel like every issue with these

701
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:04,260
games was something that was decided in a boardroom, not by a developer.

702
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:09,060
To me, that's kind of the same situation I think with Activision and Bazaar was, you

703
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:13,180
know, kind of that, oh, hey, we have an idea, you do this. And then like, it didn't work

704
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:17,860
out. And so they punished, they punished the developer instead, you know, even though it

705
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,100
was their terrible idea.

706
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:25,740
Kossin in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, no shout out for Sim Farm. Look, I didn't

707
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:31,100
shout out Simcopter either. Okay, look, I just, I can't, can't name them all. Anyhow,

708
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:36,700
EA saying that today we're consolidating Maxis IP development to our studios in Redwood Shores,

709
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:42,300
Salt Lake City, Helsinki, and Melbourne as we close our Emeryville locations. Maxis continues

710
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:46,740
to support and develop new experiences for current Sims and SimCity players while expanding

711
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:52,260
our franchises to new platforms and developing new cross-platform IP. In other words, SimCity

712
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:56,660
isn't dead, the Sims isn't dead, but they're probably going to show up on mobiles.

713
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:00,580
Well, they already have. I think it's more of they're going to have different teams developing

714
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:04,700
it. And you know what, maybe that's better for that series. Maybe it'll end up being...

715
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:09,540
I still feel like if some of the same decisions are still made, it's not going to change a

716
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:14,300
goddamn thing. And you know that. So EA is going to have to take a different approach

717
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,860
with if they're going to move it to a different development studio, they need to let that

718
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:22,220
studio make the decisions. Well, whose idea was it for like Sim... I mean, I'm assuming

719
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:27,860
it started with like kind of Sims 2 and stuff, maybe even Sims 1 where they have like $400

720
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:33,100
worth of expansions and shit for like the Sims. Well, here's the other thing to keep

721
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:39,940
in mind though, is that the Sims at the time, and I think maybe still possibly eclipsed

722
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:43,260
by one of the Blizzard games like World of Warcraft, but I'm pretty confident in saying

723
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:50,180
the Sims is the biggest PC game of all time, or at least was for a very long period of

724
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:54,180
time unless something's eclipsed it recently that I'm not aware of. But I mean, when you

725
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:59,620
have the most popular game of all time, multiple expansions to that I think are justifiable

726
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:04,900
and fine, you know, whatever. Yeah, but when you have like a new expansion... It's not

727
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,500
that different from DLC today. It's not that different from DLC today. It's not that different

728
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:13,980
from EA DLC today. I mean, it's the same thing. It's just, you know, they supported

729
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:20,340
it with discs and that kind of nonsense. Yeah. So, I don't know. I just... This news hits

730
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:25,180
hard a little bit just because, again, I remember Maxis from the 90s and I used to love them,

731
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,460
but then, you know... It kind of went downhill with support, didn't it? Yeah, I just... I

732
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:34,500
hate to say it, but they haven't... Unfortunately, they haven't knocked one out of the park probably

733
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:39,860
since maybe what? Sims 2. Even Dark Sakura, that girl in the earlier years of the show,

734
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:44,380
she used to play the Sims all the time, right? Have you heard her talk about Sims 4? Maybe

735
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:49,500
once? She's kind of moved on. So, I think, unfortunately, that kind of says a lot about

736
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:54,060
what's going on. You're right. Spore... And it's so hard to say this because I think Will

737
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:58,900
Wright is a genius. I do, but Spore... We all know Spore missed the mark in several

738
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,500
places where it was just too disjointed. That's fine. I'm fine with Will Wright kickstarting

739
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:07,980
something if you... Yeah! Hey, why don't you, like, you know, come out with another

740
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:14,580
city simulator or something like that. Simulator City. Every musician has their not-so-great

741
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:20,140
album, so you know what? Every designer is allowed their not-so-great game as well, so...

742
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:26,380
It happens. It happens. Anyway, also, it's funny you should say that. Why doesn't he

743
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:30,220
go back? It sounds like somebody else might have actually put out the game that people

744
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:34,980
wanted. Bobby Blackwolf in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com saying, apparently, Cities

745
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:40,820
Skylines, or whatever, is today a SimCity. A lot of people love it, and it just launched

746
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:45,320
last week. And TigerClaw says, yeah, one of the reasons is the Steam Workshop support.

747
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:49,460
People can mod it. And yeah, I'm... Somebody even tweeted me like, Rob, are you gonna play

748
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:53,580
this game? And I'm like, yeah, if I can look away from the MMOs for like two minutes, I'll

749
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:58,980
play this game. But I am very interested in the Cities Skyline, which sounds like opportunistic

750
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:04,860
as hell in a way, but hey, good on ya. You heard that all the people wanted this game

751
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:09,340
instead, so you went and made that game. Good for you. And it's getting very good reviews

752
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:12,540
from what I'm hearing as well. So maybe Cities Skylines is where it's at.

753
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:19,540
Yeah. So, anyhow, never... Bad decisions or not, it's never easy to talk about people

754
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:24,700
losing their jobs, so I hope all those people can find footing somewhere else, and again,

755
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:28,740
I know I realize, and I think a little bit realizes, it's probably not your fault if

756
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:31,680
you're a programmer or an artist or somebody on the front lines, it's probably not your

757
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,500
fault that SimCity went online, and I'm sure many of you internally often wanted to do

758
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:39,980
these questions as well. So, sorry to see that that happened. I hope you can find other

759
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:44,180
employment somewhere very soon, or venture out and open up a new studio, as we've seen

760
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:47,540
a lot of people doing, and a lot of those indie developers that were at PAX East were

761
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:50,740
part of that. Anyhow, let's move on to something else.

762
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,900
This is gonna be something a little different for the show. We haven't really done anything

763
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:58,900
like this before, but some big news came up during that week that I was at PAX East,

764
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:02,860
and this was so big that I was getting plenty of Facebook messages about it, like, Rob,

765
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:05,820
you gonna talk about this on OLR? You gonna talk about this? I was getting tweets about

766
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:11,500
it and so forth. So yes, we're gonna talk about it on OLR. And I think this news is

767
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:17,700
not on a lot of people's radars, and I actually got a tweet from our buddy YYR that said,

768
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:22,700
hey, Rob, can I do a special piece on this or something? Because I really wanna have

769
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:26,440
my say on this and explain this to everybody. And I was like, yes, we can have a foreign

770
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:33,180
correspondent now. We made it. We do. We have a foreign correspondent from New York. Is

771
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:36,560
that foreign? Well, foreign enough here for us here. It's a little outside the People's

772
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:41,640
Republic of Davis, but you know. So we are gonna go to our foreign correspondent to talk

773
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:46,580
a little bit about what is going on with Programmed World. And I'm gonna reiterate, I don't think

774
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:52,680
a lot of people are talking about this because this is very deeply rooted in our deep roots

775
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:57,240
of being a music gaming program, which is really where we started. So I don't think

776
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:02,080
this is popping up on a lot of people's radars, but I'm gonna ping it right now. So let's

777
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:06,400
go to our foreign correspondent, YYR, with more information.

778
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,960
The end of an era, Nostal Mix. This is an Orange Lounge Radio special report. I'm Aaron

779
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:19,020
Toplitsky. How far would you go to play a video game or to share it with the world?

780
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:24,260
Germany ceased production of Beatmania 2DX home versions in 2009. They continued yearly

781
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:30,060
updates to the game, each bringing lots of new songs and challenges. But outside of Japan,

782
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:36,800
they were impossible to find. A small group calling themselves DJ Hackers began to crack

783
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:42,580
these newer versions of 2DX, which were running on fairly ordinary PCs running Windows XP

784
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:48,020
embedded. They did release the cracked data for download on a private BitTorrent tracker,

785
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:54,260
but their true goal was to bring the full 2DX experience to arcades outside of Japan.

786
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:59,100
So while they soon had cracked versions of the game running on legitimate 2DX cabinets,

787
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:01,940
their efforts did not end there.

788
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:07,820
In Japan, Konami runs a network called eAmusement. At first, it simply tracked scores and clear

789
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:13,860
status for each song, but the online features were greatly expanded in later versions. Today's

790
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:20,340
Bimani games are continuously updated, each having dozens of unlockable songs, plus customization

791
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:25,900
features, in-game score comparisons with rival players, and even the ability to pay for your

792
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,980
games using virtual currency.

793
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:34,180
Konami's current business model actually revolves around the eAmusement network. Arcades no

794
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:39,820
longer pay for new versions of Bimani games. Instead, they pay Konami monthly for network

795
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:46,260
access, and also pay approximately 30% of each machine's revenue. Further, the latest

796
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:50,660
games need to be connected to the network just to function. If they can't connect at

797
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:57,020
boot time, they can't be played. In fact, arcades must have a current eAmusement subscription

798
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:01,700
and agree to these terms in order to receive the newest game versions at all. They can't

799
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,260
be obtained in any other way.

800
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:09,200
Several independent arcades in America have tried contacting Konami in an effort to sign

801
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,840
up for eAmusement, but none to date have received a reply.

802
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:19,120
Following many months of work, DJ Hackers successfully reverse engineered the eAmusement

803
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:25,080
network, and then set up their own, which they of course named after a song in 2DX,

804
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:30,760
Programmed World. They also found a source in Japan who could provide access to current

805
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:36,760
Bimani games. By late 2011, Programmed World had reached out to known locations outside

806
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:42,360
of Japan with 2DX machines, informing them that they could now run the latest, current

807
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:47,960
version. All they needed was their machine, a pair of card readers, a broadband internet

808
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:53,460
connection, a Linksys router, and a bit of cooperation. Programmed World offered the

809
00:51:53,460 --> 00:52:00,460
service free of charge, and just as Beatmania 2DX 19, Linkle, was released in Japan, arcades

810
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:07,540
in America received it mere days later. This effort grew, and over time, Programmed World

811
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:14,540
added support for Popin' Music, DDR, Ubeat, SoundVoltex, GuitarFreaks, and Drummania,

812
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:20,460
delivering new versions of most games as they were released. Programmed World even added

813
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:25,820
some features Konami never offered, such as transfer of player song scores from one game

814
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,660
version to the next.

815
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:33,380
Then, seemingly suddenly, just over a week ago, the administrator of Programmed World

816
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:38,900
received a cease and desist letter from Konami Digital Entertainment Incorporated. Several

817
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:43,820
arcades serviced by Programmed World also received letters asking them to stop running

818
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:50,100
current versions of Bimani games or face potential legal action. Two days later, on the evening

819
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:56,820
of Sunday, March 8th, Programmed World permanently shut down. Devoted players convened online

820
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:02,940
asking why. It had become clear over time that as Programmed World expanded, and as

821
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:07,820
our communications became increasingly social, it was impossible to keep it a secret from

822
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:13,460
Konami. However, according to sources, Konami had been aware of the network's existence

823
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:18,700
for at least several years. Why did they wait to take action until now?

824
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:24,860
One possibility comes in the form of a Japanese chain of amusement centers named Round 1,

825
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:30,900
which in recent years decided to expand into the United States beginning in California.

826
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:37,380
These centers feature karaoke, bowling, billiards, darts, ping pong, and a large arcade packed

827
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:43,620
with Japanese games including the latest Bimani games. But through a special deal with Konami,

828
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:50,460
Round 1's Bimani games are all connected to the official Japanese e-amusement network.

829
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:55,940
As Programmed World continued to grow worldwide, reaching Europe, South America, and even parts

830
00:53:55,940 --> 00:54:01,300
of Asia, Round 1 continued their expansion in the United States. They've already opened

831
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:08,300
locations in Texas and Illinois, and are coming soon to Washington, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania.

832
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:15,420
They list Beatmania 2DX as a Round 1 exclusive game on their website. So, some players believe

833
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:20,340
that they may have seen Programmed World as unfair competition and asked Konami to

834
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,140
shut it down.

835
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:26,860
Another possibility comes in the form of an announcement quietly posted to Konami's website

836
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:33,540
less than two weeks ago, the opening of what they call e-Amusement Global Service. Further

837
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:38,780
details have been promised later this month, but what players are hoping for is that Konami

838
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:44,140
recognizes a global demand for their games and will begin to provide the service directly

839
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:49,540
to arcades around the world. However, whether they'll actually provide the service to locations

840
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:54,580
other than Round 1 remains to be seen. And even if they do offer the service to other

841
00:54:54,580 --> 00:55:00,300
locations, there's no guarantee that the cost will be affordable enough for struggling independent

842
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,580
arcades.

843
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:07,880
Ultimately, these arcades, and their owners, stand to lose even more than the players.

844
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:12,460
At the very least, until we learn more about Konami's plans, all of the machines that were

845
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:18,620
connected to Programmed World must be manually downgraded to versions that will run offline.

846
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:25,540
The newest of these is over three years old. The situation for some venues is even worse.

847
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:33,060
The newly opened Nanuet Arcade in New York recently purchased DDR2014 and SoundVoltex3

848
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:39,260
machines. Both are still on their way from overseas, and without a network connection,

849
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:41,980
they can't be played at all.

850
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:45,260
For Orange Lounge Radio, I'm Aaron Toplitsky.

851
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:45,500
Do they have one in California? Because I'd like to go, it sounds awesome.

852
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:51,260
But anyway, I think that whole theory about Round 1 and the fact that, okay, if they are

853
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:55,660
embracing having these machines there, and they've made these deals with Konami, because

854
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:59,660
they know that, you know, Bomani games are still huge in Japan, and they want to be like

855
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:05,300
a Japanese center or whatever, maybe they've agreed to pay the proceeds to Konami, or what

856
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:09,940
have you, then if they're going to go to these other arcades and see, wait a minute, these

857
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:14,580
pirated versions of the game where they're not paying anything at all is running rampant,

858
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:19,780
then, you know, it's, or I shouldn't say pirated, because some of them are purchased legitimately

859
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:25,860
and on the network or whatever, but they're not paying that percentage to Konami, clearly,

860
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:30,780
so there is a different type of money exchange going on there. If they're all doing that,

861
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,740
then, you know, Round 1 probably did complain about a problem there.

862
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:35,860
It's a bowling alley, by the way.

863
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:40,820
But it says they have a multitude, probably like our bowling alley here has Laser X and

864
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:43,860
a big arcade and all this other stuff, so it's probably like a similar type of thing.

865
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:49,860
So, let's see, the closest place that they have one, which I'm wondering now that I see

866
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:54,660
this, if they've taken over a different location there, but apparently they do have them in

867
00:57:54,660 --> 00:58:00,420
California. They've got one, I'd say probably the closest one would be in the East Ridge

868
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:02,220
Shopping Center in San Jose.

869
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:05,820
Yeah, they're all mentioning in chat that there's a bunch in California. Well, gee,

870
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:06,820
somehow slipped off my radar.

871
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:08,420
That's five. I wouldn't say it's a lot.

872
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:09,820
That's five's a lot.

873
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:15,580
Most are in Southern California. There's one in Santa Ana, one in Lakewood, Moreno Valley,

874
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:16,580
and City of Independence.

875
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,500
Fine, OLR Road Trip. We'll make this happen.

876
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:24,380
And actually, the one that's in East Ridge is coming soon. It's not even out there yet.

877
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:29,540
It's a slippery slope, though, because, like, I know when I went to Scandia back when they

878
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:34,100
actually still had the newer 2DX machines, I had a lot of fun playing it, and I really

879
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:39,860
enjoyed that. And, you know, I'm glad that they were able to provide that where Konami

880
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:44,820
would not put that out officially in the U.S. and was kind of holding that back from the

881
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:49,840
fans. So, in a way, you know, the fans are to thank for putting that together and having

882
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:54,620
it out there. But I think now that somebody's stepping in saying, I want to do it legitimately,

883
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:56,380
that's probably why it's taken away.

884
00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:00,100
But it is lame, though, that we have these round one exclusive arcade game titles, and

885
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:07,960
here's what they have. Initial D8, Purikura, which is a photo booth, BeatMania 2DX, Pump

886
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:14,580
It Up Pro 50-inch Prime 2015, Transformers, and Pac-Man Smash.

887
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:20,420
Hmm. Well, I mean, when you consider that a lot of other arcades are really, like, you

888
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:25,100
know, kind of going downhill, unfortunately, I mean, it's not too, I mean, what, you have

889
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:31,020
Dave and Busters? I still think it's absolutely, it's, like, kind of a kick in the face of

890
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:34,660
all the people that have supported Konami all this time. It's like, oh, hey, fuck you

891
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:38,500
guys, you know. Oh, you still want to support us? Oh, fuck you. You know, we'll just go

892
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,620
ahead and give money to, because they're going to give us money to have this game exclusive

893
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:46,380
to this arcade. So, screw you guys. There's no answer to this that isn't going to piss

894
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:51,220
somebody off. Like, I, and I can honestly, I can honestly truly sit here and say, I see

895
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:54,980
both sides of it. And I think a lot of you out there, as much as maybe you don't want

896
00:59:54,980 --> 01:00:00,660
to admit that, you know, you can see Konami's side of it, if they, the way Aaron put it

897
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:04,020
there with the whole agreement with round one, and that maybe round one's going to give

898
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:07,900
them that cut, and once it's exclusive detail, so for, in order for that to happen, the rest

899
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:14,380
has to get shut down. I mean, money talks, and I can see that. At the same time, you

900
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:20,980
know what we always say here on OLR? Hackers gonna hack. And so, where program world goes

901
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:27,700
away, there'll probably be another solution that's out there. But if this round one arcade

902
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:33,100
catches wind of this mom and pop arcade that suddenly is running a BeatMania 2DX, you know,

903
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:37,860
much newer version that is connected online on EMUs, they'll, the arcade will probably

904
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:43,660
get season assisted. I mean, if that's, if, it depends on how big of a draw and how important

905
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:52,060
that is to round one, but if this arcade chain knows there is a cult of music game

906
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:57,720
fans, and I say cult in a loving type of way, not in a, we're all gonna, like, you know,

907
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:02,820
take drugs and die kind of way, I mean, if there is this cult of people who love this

908
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:09,260
music games that will travel a great distance to come to our place, if we are the exclusive,

909
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:14,500
then there's perhaps a certain allure with that, where they want people to have to do

910
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:15,500
that a little bit.

911
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,700
They also apparently have Project Diva.

912
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:24,740
Oh, hell, I'm sold on that. I love Project, alright, anyway. Over in our chat room over

913
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:29,980
at live.vognetwork.com, YYR of course providing comments in the chat room there saying, the

914
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:36,700
people really screwed are the ones in countries not serviced by either EMUsment or round one.

915
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:39,900
That's a very good point, is that you might have places in other companies, which, which

916
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:47,160
is why it might be a good thing if this particular EMUsment global service ends up being a thing

917
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:50,860
and maybe in other countries where they don't have round one, maybe there will be another

918
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:55,300
option, or maybe, you know, if the mom and pop arcade wants to get on the 2DX, they can

919
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,300
join this EMUs global thing.

920
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:00,800
But here's what I do really like to happen.

921
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:06,660
If Konami's suddenly realizing that this shit is recognized on a global scale, and if music

922
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:14,100
games are experiencing a bit of a renaissance right now, is it too much to ask for a proper

923
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:20,700
goddamn Beatmania release on PlayStation 4 where, wait for it, I know this might be hard

924
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:26,060
to believe, but would it be too much to ask that we just get the same thing that Japan

925
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:29,780
gets? Would it just, I know this might blow people's minds.

926
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:34,640
This is something that might blow minds too, but couldn't you maybe do a digital only release

927
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:35,640
or something like that?

928
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:38,000
Hey, hey, the arcades are upgrading.

929
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:44,520
Let's send, let's push out upgrades that you can too by, you know, maybe it will be slightly

930
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:47,800
limited because, you know, they still got to have some sort of draw for the arcades

931
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,000
or maybe it's going to be a year behind or something like that.

932
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,960
But I, I don't understand why they couldn't do that.

933
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:56,320
What, what the hell 2DX are they on anymore anyway?

934
01:02:56,320 --> 01:03:00,000
I'm really sorry to all the longtime Monty fans, but was Trichorros the latest one?

935
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
23?

936
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Is that where they're at?

937
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I don't know.

938
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Somebody in chat will correct me if I'm wrong.

939
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,520
When was the last one they put out properly on consoles?

940
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:07,520
Princess, right?

941
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:08,520
Six or no, sorry.

942
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:09,520
Empress.

943
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:10,520
Princess.

944
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,520
Close enough.

945
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,600
Uh, 16 was the last one they put out on PlayStation 2, right?

946
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:20,160
So why not, why not release the new one digitally or even got physical release cause you want

947
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,160
to have a controller, right?

948
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:22,160
Or whatever.

949
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,560
Maybe you can even use the touch pad.

950
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:24,560
I don't know.

951
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:25,560
Whatever.

952
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:31,880
Figure something out where you can release that and then all those older ones we missed,

953
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,960
there's your DLC library.

954
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:34,960
Oh my God.

955
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:35,960
Oh my God.

956
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:36,960
Come on.

957
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:37,960
How many Konami originals do you have?

958
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:38,960
It costs you literally nothing.

959
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,080
Why do you need Konami originals?

960
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,080
Nevermind in joke.

961
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,080
Forget it.

962
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,920
Uh, 22 Penn Jewel I'm being told is the recent one.

963
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:47,920
Sorry guys.

964
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:52,720
Uh, Bonds 006 in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, yes, Rob, it's too much to ask.

965
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,360
Konami doesn't like making money.

966
01:03:54,360 --> 01:04:01,800
Well, you know, to be fair, to be fair, did Beatmania sell as well as something like Rock

967
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,800
Band did?

968
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:03,800
No.

969
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:09,240
Did, was it supported by America as well as something like Rock Band was?

970
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:10,240
Nope.

971
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,240
Why?

972
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:15,120
Because they didn't, well, they didn't really advertise it and do anything they may.

973
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:18,160
I think didn't they have like a Britney Spears song in there or something like that and that

974
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,160
was about it.

975
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:24,240
Two reasons, and these are the two things that must be fixed if the Konami is ever going

976
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:27,280
to succeed with something like this here in America, if they're going to reboot.

977
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,880
These are the two things that must be fixed.

978
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:34,960
Problem number one, the songs that were in the game as well as the songs that were in

979
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:39,720
Rock Revolution and so forth, dah, dah, dah, dah, were not really the songs that the general

980
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:45,840
population, not the Colt Bimani fans, I'll get to you in a minute, that was not the group

981
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,020
of songs that people wanted to play.

982
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:50,360
Why did Guitar Hero do so stinking well?

983
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:54,680
Because you could actually play like fucking Aerosmith, ACDC, Metallica, and it wasn't

984
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:57,280
just covers, it was the actual songs.

985
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:03,680
They took a huge risk in licensing original songs and it paid off for a few years very,

986
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,400
very well, the Guitar Hero and Rock Band thing.

987
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:09,440
Well, it would continue to still pay off if they didn't melt that into the ground, but

988
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,480
yeah, that's, it worked for Rock Band.

989
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:18,360
Now item number two, and this one is for those Colt Bimani and music game fans.

990
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:21,160
Item number two that must be fixed.

991
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:24,240
Stop pretending we don't fucking know what's happening in Japan.

992
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,340
This is the day and the age of the internet.

993
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:31,300
So stop assuming that your bread and butter Colt fan base doesn't know damn well what's

994
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:32,580
happening in Japan.

995
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:37,740
If you have to cut a few licenses here and there because of legality reasons, then whatever.

996
01:05:37,740 --> 01:05:38,940
People will forgive it.

997
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:43,820
But as far as, you know, the vast library of Konami originals in house, there is no

998
01:05:43,820 --> 01:05:47,940
reason why the release we get here should not mirror what comes out in Japan.

999
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:50,020
And I would still love a new DDR game.

1000
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:51,020
I would.

1001
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:53,480
I mean, come on, look at this shit.

1002
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:57,320
Look at like what people pay for fucking collector's editions on games and shit.

1003
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:02,280
You can't tell me that you can't put on a decent dance pad for a couple hundred dollars.

1004
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:05,840
I mean, it's ridiculous.

1005
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:09,560
Anyway, there you go.

1006
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:14,880
We've given some attention to this topic and I don't, I think E3 may have some answers

1007
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,280
if Konami is going to unveil.

1008
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:19,360
It's all going to be the Melger Solid 5 show and that's about it.

1009
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:21,560
Oh, maybe Silent Hills, which would be kind of cool.

1010
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,680
But of course that.

1011
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,840
But it's going to be that because that's where their money is going to be made.

1012
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:31,080
They're not going to, there's not going to be any sort of dance masters, which I think

1013
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,760
that was kind of a mistake anyways.

1014
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:40,240
But yeah, YYR in chat saying problem is they tailored their American releases to new players

1015
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,240
exclusively.

1016
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:47,240
Act F saying Beatmania was 99% originals and remixes of originals.

1017
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:51,080
Let's see Akuma JP saying developers, developers, developers.

1018
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:55,040
Akuma just needs to say that, wow, that's an old, I'm sure we get some licensed songs

1019
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,880
from Vincent de Mora means shit.

1020
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:57,880
What's he done lately?

1021
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:01,560
I mean, I still, Hey, those are still some of my favorite songs.

1022
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:02,560
Exactly.

1023
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:06,240
I'm that, I'm not seeing it like being sarcastically, seriously, what has he done lately?

1024
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:10,640
Cause I want to listen to more of his stuff and there were other people like UltraMix

1025
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,840
brought in some very talented people into the family, right?

1026
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:16,560
Like Midi Head who did the intro to our show in case you forgot that little riff you heard

1027
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:17,560
at the beginning.

1028
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:18,560
That was Midi Head who is from UltraMix.

1029
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:23,560
And I think he had like one 2DX song, you know, maybe get, get some of his newer stuff.

1030
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:25,120
See what he's been up to in the past 10 years.

1031
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:26,680
I think he's been doing a lot of scoring for TV.

1032
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,360
There's a whole ton of indie guys out there.

1033
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:29,800
Get Vert to do some music.

1034
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:30,800
Fuck yes.

1035
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:31,800
Fuck yes.

1036
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:32,800
Oh my God.

1037
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:37,880
There's all these like huge chiptune guys that are creating these soundtracks that people

1038
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:40,160
jizz over that.

1039
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,160
I do.

1040
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:46,320
Do you think Vert would be happy to, for, for a couple hundred bucks or something, throw

1041
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:49,920
down a couple tracks that can be in 2DX and would people be here for that?

1042
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,500
I think they would.

1043
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:55,360
And a lot of these other very talented people as well that, that write video game music.

1044
01:07:55,360 --> 01:08:00,560
That's a fucking great idea, but it's why they won't do it.

1045
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,240
All right.

1046
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:04,100
Anyhow, let's move on.

1047
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:06,200
It is a three hour show, not a 30 hour show.

1048
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,100
I really want to thank YYR for that though.

1049
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:12,000
And I got to say, if you're interested in doing a report like that, like if you think

1050
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,360
you're an expert on a particular subject and you see something happening throughout the

1051
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:19,120
week where you're like, you know what, I want to do a report on that for OLR.

1052
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:23,420
You can always email us, participate at orangelaundry.com or actually it might be even better.

1053
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:26,040
You can always email me directly as long as you're not sending me crap.

1054
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:29,540
I'll read it rob at vog network.com.

1055
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:32,600
And if you're interested in contributing something to the show, you can also tweet at me.

1056
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,360
That's what YYR did at SKIE.

1057
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:41,160
And as long as you're not like tweeting me all this inane bullshit about ethics or whatever,

1058
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:46,000
I will happily pay attention to whatever it is you might want to contribute to the

1059
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
show.

1060
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
So.

1061
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
All right.

1062
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Let's move on though.

1063
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,280
We got a lot more news to cover as well.

1064
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:52,280
Right, Loki?

1065
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:53,280
Moving into this week, finally.

1066
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:54,280
So news from this week.

1067
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:55,280
Absolutely.

1068
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:56,280
And this is kind of cool.

1069
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:59,800
It's more information about the new PlayStation 4 firmware update 2.5.

1070
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:03,320
Some of the cool things that they're going to add to it is button remapping, which is

1071
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:07,280
great if you happen to have like a controller that maybe like a certain button's kind of

1072
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:11,620
not working correctly anymore and you want to fix that or maybe you just want to remap

1073
01:09:11,620 --> 01:09:15,160
your buttons because you like playing a certain way.

1074
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:16,160
That's fantastic.

1075
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:18,520
So you're able to do that now with the firmware.

1076
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:23,760
Also with that, they're going to be adding suspend and resume to gameplay.

1077
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:27,820
So normally you can suspend your system and that kind of stuff, but now you can literally

1078
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:32,680
pause your game and then come back to right in the same spot that you were in your game

1079
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,280
without having to worry about that.

1080
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:35,280
So that's pretty awesome.

1081
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:39,080
I think that's kind of how they were originally talking, you know, advertising that feature

1082
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:43,040
when they were talking about PlayStation 4 initially.

1083
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:49,480
The other thing which is kind of cool is they're going to be allowing you to upload 60 frames

1084
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:55,800
per second video for share play and remote play to daily motion.

1085
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:56,800
So that's pretty cool.

1086
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:04,640
And I guess also that button remapping will be pretty nice for accessibility as well.

1087
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:07,760
That is awesome that they're doing that on a system-wide level.

1088
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:12,480
So the games that fail to remember to put something so easy into the game, not a problem

1089
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:13,480
anymore.

1090
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:14,480
Yeah.

1091
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:21,380
Or say a game offers you certain button configurations and you just don't like it, you want something

1092
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:25,600
of your own, then you can do that.

1093
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:30,760
Moving on, talking about what's happening with Nintendo while we all wait for that PS4

1094
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:33,240
firmware release because it isn't out yet, but soon.

1095
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:34,800
I think in like April maybe.

1096
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:38,340
Some people making a really big deal about that suspend resume thing because it was something

1097
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:40,840
they announced at the beginning and then it never came out.

1098
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:44,240
Am I the only one that like kind of forgot that that was supposed to be a thing on PlayStation

1099
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,240
4?

1100
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,240
Yeah.

1101
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:48,240
But you know, some of the people, there's always those two camps of people and to be

1102
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:52,920
fair, I know there's people that do this to Microsoft and as well, but man, there's some

1103
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:56,460
people out there that just like every little thing Sony does, they just, they'll take the

1104
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:58,820
opportunity to jump down their throat.

1105
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:01,040
And I know people that do that with Nintendo too, like Loki.

1106
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:07,080
Well, I am a bit bugged when they announce features and this is specifically for Sony

1107
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:12,680
in this case, you know, they announce features and then they don't end up releasing with

1108
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:13,680
those features.

1109
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:17,560
I'd rather they just don't announce those features and then put it out and then, oh

1110
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:18,560
hey, we did this.

1111
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,320
I was talking with somebody about this at PAX East.

1112
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:25,760
This is why our industry is so fucking secretive, by the way, the video game industry.

1113
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:29,920
This is why there are so many secrets because any little thing that gets out becomes an

1114
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:35,000
expectation and becomes, you know, this thing that is judged and put out there for, you

1115
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,920
know, the cynical game reverse that's out there, of which there's a lot of.

1116
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:38,920
Well, it's fine.

1117
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,920
It's fine if like they could say, you know, initially when they're talking about, yeah,

1118
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:44,920
we're these power saving features and what we're working on, we're trying to get this,

1119
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:47,920
you know, resume suspend function to work.

1120
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:53,180
It may be not necessarily as part of an announcement, maybe like, you know, talking with the hardware

1121
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:57,380
developers type piece or something like that, but I'd be fine with that and wouldn't expect

1122
01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:58,380
them to do that.

1123
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:01,340
Like, well, we're trying to get that to work, you know, we'll see, you know, it's probably

1124
01:12:01,340 --> 01:12:04,460
not something that's going to be at launch, you know, or even if they're announcing a

1125
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:08,060
feature like, oh, the resume suspend thing, you know, all this is not going to be at launch.

1126
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:10,860
This will be coming later on, you know, something we're working on.

1127
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:16,460
I don't believe that was ever outlined, you know, it's more of like, ah, the console releases

1128
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:17,460
in two weeks.

1129
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:19,460
Oh, by the way, this is not going to be part of the launch thing.

1130
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:20,460
All right.

1131
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:26,020
Well, let's move on to Nintendo and Loki is going to try very hard to not find something

1132
01:12:26,020 --> 01:12:27,820
to complain about with these stories.

1133
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:34,420
Hey, I am, I, I am very fair.

1134
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:35,420
Sure you are.

1135
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:36,420
Sure you are.

1136
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:37,420
All right.

1137
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:40,060
Uh, let's talk about Splatoon, which of course is coming out on the Wii U later this year,

1138
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:44,580
which by the way, huge line to play that at PAX East, Splatoon, and I'm kind of thinking

1139
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:46,660
like why the game's out next month.

1140
01:12:46,660 --> 01:12:50,180
And I just, I don't know, I just, it was the same demo that they had had at E3 and I was

1141
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:54,420
kind of, I was happy just watching other people play it going, I get an idea what this probably

1142
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:55,420
game is like.

1143
01:12:55,820 --> 01:12:59,420
I'll probably check it out when it comes out on the Wii U, but I'm sure this, this is not

1144
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:00,420
a secret anyway.

1145
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:04,020
Uh, this is, this is one of those very non surprising things.

1146
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:09,220
However, a Splatoon eShop listing showed up and shows that Splatoon will be supporting

1147
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:10,860
the amiibo.

1148
01:13:10,860 --> 01:13:12,820
I'm sure this is surprising nobody.

1149
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:18,420
Uh, it is not an official confirmation, however, but come on, come on, amiibo and Splatoon.

1150
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:20,020
This is Nintendo's huge thing now.

1151
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:23,820
So of course I'm sure the amiibo are going to do something in Splatoon.

1152
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:27,820
Uh, the pages were then quickly taken down after they were discovered, which, you know,

1153
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:31,620
just means it was true, or else what would they have had to be afraid of?

1154
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:38,020
Um, also apparently there was a, a retailer out there called Raru, uh, that had a Splatoon

1155
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:39,020
amiibo pages.

1156
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:43,420
There was a Splatoon squid girl and a boy that were going to be released at the end

1157
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:44,420
of May.

1158
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:48,220
So maybe Splatoon was actually going to get its own dedicated amiibo, or still is going

1159
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:49,920
to get its own dedicated amiibo.

1160
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:55,320
If they are, uh, A, I hope we can find them, and B, I'm sure more information will come

1161
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,720
on that in a Nintendo Direct soon.

1162
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:00,820
You know, though, for all the complaining I've done about amiibo here on the show, which

1163
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:06,320
I still believe is, is justified, when Nintendo wants certain amiibo to be available, they're

1164
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,320
not that hard to find.

1165
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:12,220
Like, if you, you can go to Target and get Mario, Pikachu, Zelda, you know, you can get

1166
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:18,160
a lot of those pretty easy, and I imagine, like, you know, some of the Mario Party characters

1167
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:22,860
probably won't be so difficult either, uh, and if these Splatoon people are, are released,

1168
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:25,420
then I'm sure they won't be too hard to find either.

1169
01:14:25,420 --> 01:14:30,660
It's all those niche characters that are the ones that, of course, the gaming fanboys and

1170
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:35,660
fangirls just, they have to have in their collection, because I'm cool enough for school

1171
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:40,660
to know, you know, when they were still making Mega Man games, and all these sorts of things,

1172
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:44,460
that, that causes frenzy, and then Nintendo does, can't print enough of them, because

1173
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:47,660
there's only so much shelf space or whatever, I don't know.

1174
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:51,160
Random amiibo tangent, sorry for that.

1175
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:53,160
And here I thought Loki would be the one complaining.

1176
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,160
Sorry about that.

1177
01:14:54,660 --> 01:14:57,660
But hey, nothing to complain about with this, because this series is fantastic.

1178
01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:02,160
It's Mother, also known as Earthbound Zero, which is the first one.

1179
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:06,660
Of course, the soundtrack to these Mother games, uh, are always really kind of trippy

1180
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:12,160
and fun, and, uh, the official soundtrack to Earthbound Zero was never released outside

1181
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:13,160
of Japan.

1182
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:20,660
However, what's happening with this, a record label named Ship-to-Shore Fanoko has obtained

1183
01:15:20,660 --> 01:15:27,160
the licensing rights to this Mother soundtrack album, and they have taken to Kickstarter

1184
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:33,660
to officially release the Mother official soundtrack outside of Japan and on vinyl.

1185
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:37,660
So if the Kickstarter does well enough, they might consider releasing soundtracks for other

1186
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:41,160
video games on vinyl as well, including the rest of the Mother series.

1187
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:43,660
So you can check that out on Kickstarter if you want.

1188
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:46,660
Uh, trying to get an update on where they're at right now.

1189
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:47,660
Oh, they made it.

1190
01:15:47,660 --> 01:15:48,660
So it looks like this is happening.

1191
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:49,660
Their goal was 42,000.

1192
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:52,660
They're at 48,000 with 24 days to go.

1193
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:55,660
So they're, they'll probably beat that goal by quite a bit.

1194
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:59,660
That's pretty awesome that they're going to be releasing those on vinyl.

1195
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:04,660
It's also pretty disappointing that Nintendo still doesn't give a shit about releasing

1196
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:05,660
those titles.

1197
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:11,160
They, isn't, isn't that something when you, when you actually see money being made on

1198
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:16,160
the internet off this and yet, I don't know, I guess they just feel there's more bang for

1199
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:19,160
the buck and focusing on Amiibo or something, which shouldn't, to be fair, they're probably

1200
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:21,160
here's what I think that they need to do.

1201
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:26,160
Then get a fucking B team develop development team or something like, you know, don't they

1202
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:29,160
have like four or five R and D teams inside Nintendo.

1203
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:31,660
I think here's an idea and I'm going to throw this out there.

1204
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:33,160
It's going to sound a little, here it is.

1205
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,160
Here it is, folks.

1206
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,160
Here it is.

1207
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:39,660
I thought instead of producing Miyamoto's fucking terrible ideas, like, and I'm not

1208
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:43,660
saying like he has great ideas, but the two, wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1209
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:47,660
You just said a Miyamoto's terrible ideas.

1210
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:50,660
The man behind Super Mario Brothers.

1211
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:52,160
And yes, yes.

1212
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:56,160
Let's give him a pass on every single idea that he comes up with because he made Super

1213
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:57,160
Mario Brothers.

1214
01:16:57,160 --> 01:17:01,660
Oh, as I said at the beginning of the show, every developer has a couple of stinkers once

1215
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:02,660
in a while.

1216
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:03,660
I've got two couples.

1217
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:08,160
I have his couple of stinkers right here that he showed off at E3 for an extended period

1218
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,160
of time.

1219
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:10,160
Oh, fuck you.

1220
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,160
You don't want to know anything about Star Fox.

1221
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:12,160
It'll be good though.

1222
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:16,660
But let me show you this, these, my personal projects that I really care about.

1223
01:17:16,660 --> 01:17:17,660
They're fucking terrible.

1224
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:23,660
Which was a direct response to everybody saying they wanted to see the Wii U game pad being

1225
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:24,660
used more.

1226
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:28,660
That wasn't to quell some type of Miyamoto ego issue.

1227
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:33,660
That was to shut the fucking stock investors up because they were saying that they didn't

1228
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:35,660
understand the point of the game pad.

1229
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:36,660
All right.

1230
01:17:36,660 --> 01:17:37,660
Anyway, anyway.

1231
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:38,660
Okay.

1232
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:39,660
Anyways.

1233
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:40,660
Project watch fucking piece of shit.

1234
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:41,660
You don't need that.

1235
01:17:41,660 --> 01:17:43,660
It's going to be Five Nights at Freddy's already did.

1236
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:48,660
And number two, whatever the fucking robot fighting game that he's doing is also garbage.

1237
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:52,660
So take the people that are going to be making those games and put them on a new mother game.

1238
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:55,660
You can't tell me that there's not anyone's command.

1239
01:17:55,660 --> 01:17:56,660
You know what?

1240
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:58,660
Nobody wants to see those games instead of a new mother game.

1241
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:00,660
No one is going to say that.

1242
01:18:00,660 --> 01:18:01,660
Nobody.

1243
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:03,660
No one is going to say, I really want to play project watch.

1244
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:10,660
I really want to defend some arbitrary building from Rob the robot.

1245
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:14,660
I'm going to, I'm going to poke at this Loki, because I know there's many Nintendo fanboys

1246
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:17,660
sitting out there with steamed faces right now at what you're saying.

1247
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:19,660
And you need to consider this.

1248
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:26,660
Nintendo is trying to broaden the audience than just cult gamers who want cult games.

1249
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:30,660
And so by some of these Wii U projects, the thought is, and we don't really know until

1250
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:35,660
they're out there and get to test the audience, will this bring more people to the Wii U that

1251
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:36,660
don't already own one?

1252
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:37,660
You're right.

1253
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:39,660
Because that really worked well with Wii Music, didn't it?

1254
01:18:39,660 --> 01:18:41,660
They tried to broaden the audience with that.

1255
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:43,660
No, no, no, no.

1256
01:18:43,660 --> 01:18:44,660
Apples and oranges.

1257
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:45,660
Apples and oranges.

1258
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:47,660
No, it wasn't apples and oranges.

1259
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:48,660
They thought they could recapture the...

1260
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:51,660
The Wii had already sold 11 billion copies.

1261
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:55,660
They, oh, and it shouldn't have been a problem to have that game be a success then, because

1262
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:59,660
even a mart, you know, a small fraction of the people that own the Wii U could have,

1263
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:02,660
or the Wii, could have bought, you know, Wii Music.

1264
01:19:02,660 --> 01:19:03,660
But guess what?

1265
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:05,660
Nobody fucking bought that game.

1266
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:06,660
It was terrible.

1267
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:08,660
And it didn't broaden any audiences.

1268
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:12,660
It was just like, oh hey, we're going to recapture the fire that we had with Wii Sports, and

1269
01:19:12,660 --> 01:19:13,660
we're just going to apply it to this.

1270
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:16,660
And people will buy it because it's like Wii Sports.

1271
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:21,660
So, I just think if they save their time from producing those two games, hey, Star

1272
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:22,660
Box is going to be amazing.

1273
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:27,660
And I'm sure a lot of the things that Miyamoto does are amazing, but I wouldn't waste my

1274
01:19:27,660 --> 01:19:28,660
time on these tech demos.

1275
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:30,660
It's just not going to work out.

1276
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:36,660
All right, as expected, as usual, Loki's Rants getting a variety of responses in chat.

1277
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:40,660
And, you know, some supporting you, Loki.

1278
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:44,660
We've got Bonds006 saying thank you, Loki, for that rant.

1279
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:48,660
And YYR saying this episode would not be complete without a Loki Nintendo rant.

1280
01:19:48,660 --> 01:19:50,660
I'm glad this is still a complete episode.

1281
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:56,660
And then the other side of it, AkumaJP saying please play the game first before you slam

1282
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:57,660
it.

1283
01:19:57,660 --> 01:20:00,660
What, Wii Music, or are we talking about this?

1284
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:02,660
I'm assuming these Wii U prototypes.

1285
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:06,660
Okay, I'll play Project Watch when it comes out.

1286
01:20:06,660 --> 01:20:08,660
Eventually, whenever that is.

1287
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:09,660
All right, I'm holding you to that.

1288
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:10,660
I'm holding you to that.

1289
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:13,660
Okay, I'll play it, and I'm sure I will love it.

1290
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:15,660
I'll be like, oh my god, Miyamoto made this?

1291
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:16,660
I have to love it.

1292
01:20:16,660 --> 01:20:19,660
I have to love it.

1293
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:24,660
Let's see, and Kaijuto saying I don't even know what the heck Mother is, so I'm not looking

1294
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:25,660
for a remake of it.

1295
01:20:25,660 --> 01:20:28,660
They called Mother 2 Earthbound here in the US.

1296
01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:29,660
That's what that is.

1297
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:33,660
And Akdeft saying Wii Music was a failed tech demo.

1298
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:35,660
So, there you go.

1299
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:41,660
But these two games that, I mean, projects he's working on, wouldn't those technically

1300
01:20:41,660 --> 01:20:42,660
be a tech demo?

1301
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:46,660
Because it certainly looked like a tech demo to me.

1302
01:20:46,660 --> 01:20:53,660
I, I think it's, honestly, I think it's too soon to say, because sometimes, especially

1303
01:20:53,660 --> 01:20:57,660
Nintendo does this, they put out one tiny little part of their game that becomes a much

1304
01:20:57,660 --> 01:20:58,660
bigger thing.

1305
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:01,660
But Nintendo has also listened to feedback, and sometimes they'll put out a tech demo

1306
01:21:01,660 --> 01:21:03,660
and then end up not doing anything with it.

1307
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:06,660
Wii Vitality Sensor.

1308
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:10,660
So, they must believe in these and that there's full games in there somewhere if they're

1309
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:12,660
going to actually end up releasing the games.

1310
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:13,660
So, we'll see.

1311
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:14,660
We'll see, Loki.

1312
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:17,660
I can't wait to see your beaming reaction to playing those.

1313
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:22,660
I don't think we'll actually ever see Project Watch or this robot fighting game.

1314
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:24,660
It will end up being whatever Nintendo Land 2 is.

1315
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:27,660
What about, what about, are you going to hate on everything Nintendo?

1316
01:21:27,660 --> 01:21:29,660
What about Zelda, Wii U?

1317
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:31,660
No, I didn't say I hated everything in Nintendo.

1318
01:21:31,660 --> 01:21:34,660
I'm just saying these specific two projects are fine.

1319
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:39,660
I love Miyamoto and his stuff, but I'm just saying, maybe not Pikmin, but I love everything

1320
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:40,660
else.

1321
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:46,660
I'm just saying that these two projects in particular are a waste of time.

1322
01:21:46,660 --> 01:21:48,660
All right.

1323
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:49,660
Moving on.

1324
01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:53,660
Again, it's only a three-hour show, not a 30-hour show.

1325
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:54,660
Let's move on with some more stories.

1326
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:57,660
Loki, what is coming out that a lot of people are going to be playing, probably?

1327
01:21:57,660 --> 01:22:00,660
Well, there's actually some decent stuff coming out.

1328
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:01,660
Soccer moms everywhere.

1329
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:03,660
Going to check this game, I'm not sure.

1330
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:08,660
I'd say it's kind of up my alley, but Battlefield Hardline is going to be coming

1331
01:22:08,660 --> 01:22:15,660
out this week on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.

1332
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:25,660
Also, Resident Evil Revelations 2 on PlayStation 3, and I believe PlayStation, or Xbox 360,

1333
01:22:25,660 --> 01:22:29,660
Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.

1334
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:32,660
Those will be the disc versions of the game, because I want to say that they've already

1335
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:33,660
been out digitally.

1336
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:36,660
What else?

1337
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:40,660
I think that might have actually been it.

1338
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:45,660
I want to see if I'm missing any other releases here, but I think that's it.

1339
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:50,660
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio at vognetwork.com,

1340
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:53,660
use the passphrase, save.

1341
01:22:53,660 --> 01:22:56,660
Before I get to the Japanese release...

1342
01:22:56,660 --> 01:22:57,660
I did miss one.

1343
01:22:57,660 --> 01:23:01,660
And I'm sorry, it is ironic that it is also Nintendo, but Mario Party 10 will be coming

1344
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:02,660
out this week.

1345
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:03,660
Oh, is that this week?

1346
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:04,660
That is on the 20th.

1347
01:23:04,660 --> 01:23:05,660
That would be Friday.

1348
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:09,660
I need to, it looks like we might have some guests coming to the show here, spur of the

1349
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:12,660
moment here, so while I get that worked out, do you want to maybe talk a little bit about

1350
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:16,660
Mortal Kombat X, and then I'll come back and talk about the Japanese releases.

1351
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:17,660
Absolutely.

1352
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:23,660
So, Mortal Kombat X is pretty awesome, and we've been kind of waiting, you know, especially

1353
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:27,660
with the last Mortal Kombat game, they had all these guest characters that were coming

1354
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:30,660
in there, and kind of speculation is, who's going to be the next guest character?

1355
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:32,660
We had Freddy Krueger last time.

1356
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:35,660
You know, wouldn't it be awesome if we had, you know, Jason Voorhees or something like

1357
01:23:35,660 --> 01:23:36,660
that?

1358
01:23:36,660 --> 01:23:41,660
And sure enough, you know, they picked the perfect day to release it, you know, the information

1359
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:46,660
on Friday the 13th, they announced that Jason Voorhees will be the first guest character

1360
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:51,660
that will appear in Mortal Kombat X, and they had a nice little trailer that went with that.

1361
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:59,660
It's going to be part of the Kombat Pack that will include Jason as well as two other classic

1362
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:04,660
Kombatans, and they're going to have another guest character, and that seems like kind

1363
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:07,660
of a waste of money now that I look at that.

1364
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:09,660
But $30 for that.

1365
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:11,660
$30 for four characters.

1366
01:24:11,660 --> 01:24:14,660
That seems awfully expensive.

1367
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:15,660
That's dumb.

1368
01:24:15,660 --> 01:24:16,660
Oh, hey!

1369
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:18,660
Where did that voice come from?

1370
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:20,660
We have some guests here in studio.

1371
01:24:20,660 --> 01:24:21,660
What voice?

1372
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:22,660
What voice?

1373
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:23,660
Hey, how you doing?

1374
01:24:23,660 --> 01:24:24,660
It's Princess Irene joining us tonight.

1375
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:25,660
Hi.

1376
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:26,660
How are you doing?

1377
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:27,660
Doing pretty well.

1378
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:28,660
How are you?

1379
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:29,660
Just texting me like, hey, I was in the neighborhood.

1380
01:24:29,660 --> 01:24:30,660
Want me to stop by?

1381
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:31,660
Yeah.

1382
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:32,660
That's exactly what happened.

1383
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:33,660
That's exactly what happened.

1384
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:34,660
Well, how are you doing?

1385
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:36,660
What brings you to the neighborhood tonight?

1386
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:41,660
Oh, we were at the Marvel Universe Live, and then I was trying to leave our mutual friend

1387
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:42,660
Jim's house, and we went the wrong way.

1388
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:43,660
We went the wrong way.

1389
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:46,660
And so we're like, you know, Rob lives over here.

1390
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:47,660
Go there.

1391
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:48,660
Why not?

1392
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:49,660
Wait a minute.

1393
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:50,660
You mean Flacco?

1394
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:51,660
No, other Jim.

1395
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:52,660
Oh, oh, oh.

1396
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:53,660
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

1397
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:55,660
Oh, he's not far from here at all.

1398
01:24:55,660 --> 01:24:56,660
No, no, no.

1399
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:57,660
You're kind of in the right area.

1400
01:24:57,660 --> 01:24:58,660
Yeah.

1401
01:24:58,660 --> 01:24:59,660
We were just going in the wrong direction.

1402
01:24:59,660 --> 01:25:02,660
Hey, and also joining us, all these random voices.

1403
01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:03,660
Whoa.

1404
01:25:03,660 --> 01:25:04,660
A wild Mystique approaches.

1405
01:25:04,660 --> 01:25:05,660
How you doing, Mystique?

1406
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:10,660
We haven't had you on the show ever since we were, I think, at the studio that was at

1407
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:11,660
Jamie's house years ago.

1408
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:12,660
Yep.

1409
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:14,660
I'm usually traveling with a wild Dan.

1410
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:15,660
Yes, you are.

1411
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:16,660
Her husband.

1412
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:17,660
How are you?

1413
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:18,660
Pretty good.

1414
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:19,660
Yeah?

1415
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:20,660
How was Marvel Live?

1416
01:25:20,660 --> 01:25:21,660
It was pretty cool.

1417
01:25:21,660 --> 01:25:22,660
Yeah.

1418
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:23,660
What do they do with those things?

1419
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:24,660
Yeah, the first five minutes were awesome.

1420
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:25,660
Oh, no.

1421
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:26,660
Oh, God, you went too, huh?

1422
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:27,660
We'll get to that later.

1423
01:25:27,660 --> 01:25:28,660
Uh-oh.

1424
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:29,660
Uh-oh.

1425
01:25:29,660 --> 01:25:30,660
All right.

1426
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:31,660
It's nothing.

1427
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:32,660
It's no fault.

1428
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:33,660
It's a fault of my own genetics, unfortunately.

1429
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:39,340
Let's just say that I pissed away over $200.

1430
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:40,340
Meaning that after-

1431
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:41,340
You bought everything there.

1432
01:25:41,340 --> 01:25:42,340
No.

1433
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:43,340
No, no, no.

1434
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:44,340
No, no, no.

1435
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:45,660
The kid had to go to the bathroom five minutes into the show.

1436
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:48,580
No, the kid got scared five minutes into the show.

1437
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:51,500
We had to leave, and I had nice ass seats.

1438
01:25:51,500 --> 01:25:54,620
There were five rows from the floor.

1439
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:55,620
That's your bad.

1440
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:56,620
It was fantastic.

1441
01:25:56,620 --> 01:25:57,620
It was so fun.

1442
01:25:57,620 --> 01:25:58,620
It was lots of fun.

1443
01:25:58,620 --> 01:25:59,620
It was fun.

1444
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:01,820
The first five minutes sucked, but the rest was so good.

1445
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:03,180
No, no, it was awesome.

1446
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:05,620
It was just too loud and too scary for-

1447
01:26:05,620 --> 01:26:07,420
What do they do at Marvel Live?

1448
01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:08,420
They play fight.

1449
01:26:08,420 --> 01:26:09,420
They have stuntmen.

1450
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:10,420
So it's like wrestling?

1451
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:11,420
It's like a stunt show.

1452
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:12,420
Well, don't they do-

1453
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:17,220
It's more as I like to say, it's like Disney on ice, but it's Marvel, but it's not on ice.

1454
01:26:17,220 --> 01:26:19,140
But Marvel's owned by Disney now, so it's-

1455
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:20,140
Kind of technically.

1456
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:21,140
So it's Disney on ice without the ice.

1457
01:26:21,140 --> 01:26:22,140
There you go.

1458
01:26:22,140 --> 01:26:23,140
So Disney on.

1459
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:27,180
It's like one of those stunt shows that you see at Universal Studios or something like

1460
01:26:27,180 --> 01:26:28,180
that.

1461
01:26:28,180 --> 01:26:29,180
Oh, with monster trucks?

1462
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:30,180
Yeah.

1463
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:31,180
They didn't have trucks in-

1464
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:32,180
Actually, motorcycles.

1465
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:33,180
Dirt bikes.

1466
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:34,180
Oh, it was so cool.

1467
01:26:34,180 --> 01:26:35,180
Cool.

1468
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:36,180
Yeah, I wanted to see it, but-

1469
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:37,180
I went to a hockey game over the weekend.

1470
01:26:37,180 --> 01:26:38,180
I had fun with that.

1471
01:26:38,180 --> 01:26:39,180
That's really cool, Rob.

1472
01:26:39,180 --> 01:26:41,180
Actually, it wasn't that cool because our team got fucking clobbered.

1473
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:42,180
They choked.

1474
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:43,180
I felt like I was watching a Kings game.

1475
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:44,180
It was so awful.

1476
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:46,420
Wait, are you saying that a hockey game's not cool?

1477
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:47,420
Wow.

1478
01:26:47,420 --> 01:26:48,420
No, hockey's fun.

1479
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:49,420
You're not cool.

1480
01:26:49,420 --> 01:26:50,420
All right.

1481
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:53,140
You should already be used to a Kings game not sucking.

1482
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:54,140
All right, look.

1483
01:26:54,140 --> 01:26:57,540
By the way, I'm talking about the Sacramento Kings, not the LA Kings, but the LA Kings

1484
01:26:57,540 --> 01:26:58,540
suck too.

1485
01:26:58,540 --> 01:26:59,540
All right, anyway.

1486
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:00,540
Who are the LA Kings?

1487
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:01,540
Hockey.

1488
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:02,540
You've never heard of hockey?

1489
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:03,540
Oh, what's hockey?

1490
01:27:03,540 --> 01:27:04,540
I don't know what hockey is.

1491
01:27:04,540 --> 01:27:07,620
Did you ever play Blades of Steel, one of the greatest NES games ever?

1492
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:09,340
Oh my God, did I ever.

1493
01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:10,340
There you go.

1494
01:27:10,340 --> 01:27:11,340
Oh, that hockey.

1495
01:27:11,340 --> 01:27:12,340
Duh.

1496
01:27:12,340 --> 01:27:14,340
Why didn't you just say Blades of Steel?

1497
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:15,340
Jeez.

1498
01:27:15,340 --> 01:27:19,100
Okay, so I don't know if you know this, but Blades of Steel is based on something that

1499
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:20,100
people do.

1500
01:27:20,780 --> 01:27:24,180
Now, I know you're in California, so this is a hard concept for you to believe, but

1501
01:27:24,180 --> 01:27:31,620
having just got back from fucking Boston a week ago, sometimes the water freezes over

1502
01:27:31,620 --> 01:27:33,780
and people skate on it.

1503
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:34,780
Is it magic?

1504
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:35,780
It's like Disney on Ice.

1505
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:42,280
Yeah, it's like, okay, it's like Disney on Ice, except the princesses punch each other

1506
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:44,100
and the blood bounces on the ice.

1507
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:45,100
Oh my gosh.

1508
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:46,100
That's hockey.

1509
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:51,540
I would pay money to see the Disney princesses in an all out brutal hockey game.

1510
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:52,540
I wouldn't.

1511
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:54,940
That does not sound like fun at all.

1512
01:27:54,940 --> 01:27:55,940
It could be.

1513
01:27:55,940 --> 01:27:56,940
All right.

1514
01:27:56,940 --> 01:28:02,940
Anyway, our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, let's see, SJ100Matt saying Rob has gone to

1515
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:05,860
more NHL games this year than I have.

1516
01:28:05,860 --> 01:28:09,720
Some folks in chat, DarkTests2us saying shots fired.

1517
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:11,980
And let's see, YYR saying, so it's like roller games.

1518
01:28:11,980 --> 01:28:12,980
You ever been to roller games?

1519
01:28:12,980 --> 01:28:14,980
Oh my God.

1520
01:28:14,980 --> 01:28:15,980
Roller games.

1521
01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:17,860
It was an NES game.

1522
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:18,860
Right?

1523
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:19,860
Where you could be that fat guy.

1524
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:20,860
Maybe.

1525
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:21,860
I don't know.

1526
01:28:21,860 --> 01:28:22,860
Shut up.

1527
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:23,860
It's a game.

1528
01:28:23,860 --> 01:28:24,860
Look it up.

1529
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:25,860
Chat room.

1530
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:26,860
Roller games is an NES game.

1531
01:28:26,860 --> 01:28:27,860
Hashtag look it up.

1532
01:28:27,860 --> 01:28:28,860
All right.

1533
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:31,020
But that was a fantastic game too.

1534
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:32,020
All right.

1535
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:34,460
Let's get you ladies caught up on everything we've talked about on OLR tonight.

1536
01:28:34,460 --> 01:28:38,860
I would like you to quickly in one sentence or less, give your reaction to the following

1537
01:28:38,860 --> 01:28:39,860
stories.

1538
01:28:39,860 --> 01:28:40,860
All right.

1539
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:41,860
Here we go.

1540
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:42,860
Yes.

1541
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:43,860
What kind of video games have you played this week?

1542
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:44,860
Irene?

1543
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:49,940
I've played Luminous Electronic Symphony and other things that I can't remember.

1544
01:28:49,940 --> 01:28:50,940
Mystique?

1545
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:51,940
Words.

1546
01:28:51,940 --> 01:28:52,940
Words.

1547
01:28:52,940 --> 01:28:53,940
All right.

1548
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:58,740
So Mavis Beacon teaches typing or typing of the dead or...

1549
01:28:58,740 --> 01:28:59,740
Words with friends.

1550
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:00,740
Words with friends.

1551
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:03,340
I have not had time to play games because I'm too busy doing homework.

1552
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:06,260
Why are you even on the show?

1553
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:07,860
Because you made me get on the show.

1554
01:29:07,860 --> 01:29:08,860
That's true.

1555
01:29:08,860 --> 01:29:09,860
Sorry.

1556
01:29:09,860 --> 01:29:10,860
Cause she's fun.

1557
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:11,860
All right.

1558
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:13,860
Rock band four has been confirmed.

1559
01:29:13,860 --> 01:29:14,860
What?

1560
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:18,860
Okay.

1561
01:29:18,860 --> 01:29:19,860
All right.

1562
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:20,860
Let's see.

1563
01:29:20,860 --> 01:29:23,860
EA closed Maxis, the developers of SimCity.

1564
01:29:23,860 --> 01:29:24,860
Oh no.

1565
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:25,860
God no.

1566
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:27,860
What are we going to do now?

1567
01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:28,860
I guess play something else.

1568
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:29,860
You can't be serious.

1569
01:29:29,860 --> 01:29:30,860
Let's see.

1570
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:36,580
Konami has shut down the service Programmed World that allowed BeatMania 2DX machines

1571
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:38,860
past Linkle to work here in the US.

1572
01:29:38,860 --> 01:29:39,860
Okay.

1573
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:40,860
What?

1574
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:44,860
Do you not have any opinions on anything going on in games?

1575
01:29:44,860 --> 01:29:45,860
No.

1576
01:29:45,860 --> 01:29:46,860
Let's see.

1577
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:48,860
What did you think of Marvel Universe Live then?

1578
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:49,860
Oh my God.

1579
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:50,860
It was so good.

1580
01:29:50,860 --> 01:29:51,860
You guys.

1581
01:29:51,860 --> 01:29:53,860
Like it was, I didn't know what to expect.

1582
01:29:53,860 --> 01:29:54,860
It was off the hook.

1583
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:55,860
It was off the hook.

1584
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:56,860
It was off the chain.

1585
01:29:56,860 --> 01:29:57,860
It really was.

1586
01:29:57,860 --> 01:29:58,860
It was.

1587
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:00,360
Like I thought it was going to be like for kids like, okay, this is going to be stupid,

1588
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:04,500
but it was so action packed and exciting and like it was, you know, a riot.

1589
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:05,500
It was awesome.

1590
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:08,620
It was like watching your cartoon come to life.

1591
01:30:08,620 --> 01:30:09,620
Right.

1592
01:30:09,620 --> 01:30:13,340
It was full of puns and clever one liners and just, it was so good.

1593
01:30:13,340 --> 01:30:15,740
You know what else is action packed and exciting?

1594
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:20,740
Mortal Kombat X. Jason Voorhees is going to be a character in Mortal Kombat X.

1595
01:30:20,740 --> 01:30:22,740
Is it going to be space Jason?

1596
01:30:22,740 --> 01:30:23,740
No.

1597
01:30:23,740 --> 01:30:24,740
I don't think it's because Freddy.

1598
01:30:24,740 --> 01:30:25,740
That's the Jason X.

1599
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:29,060
It could be one of the, uh, the, uh, costumes because they're supposed to have different

1600
01:30:29,060 --> 01:30:30,060
costumes.

1601
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:31,340
Freddy Krueger was in the last Mortal Kombat game.

1602
01:30:31,340 --> 01:30:34,100
Well that would make sense because Jason X was space Jason.

1603
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:35,100
So it's Mortal Kombat X.

1604
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:36,660
So they should have like, duh.

1605
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:37,660
All right.

1606
01:30:37,660 --> 01:30:38,660
Makes sense.

1607
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:39,940
That movie was not very good.

1608
01:30:39,940 --> 01:30:41,940
Look, let's not talk about that.

1609
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:42,940
Okay.

1610
01:30:42,940 --> 01:30:43,940
Cause I will scream.

1611
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:44,940
All right.

1612
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:47,460
Picking up where we left off with release dates for Japan.

1613
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:50,020
We'll check in with these ladies throughout the show with the other news.

1614
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:51,940
Maybe I'll let Irene promote her own show.

1615
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:53,420
Mystique, do you have a podcast too?

1616
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:54,420
Everybody's got a podcast these days.

1617
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:55,420
Shut up.

1618
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:56,420
Um, no.

1619
01:30:56,420 --> 01:30:57,420
Okay.

1620
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:58,420
Well maybe.

1621
01:30:58,420 --> 01:30:59,420
I forgot to mention.

1622
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:00,420
She's stuck on one.

1623
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:01,420
What?

1624
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:02,420
Since I didn't quite get done there.

1625
01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:04,760
Um, Mortal Kombat X has been delayed on Xbox 360 and PlayStation three.

1626
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:09,920
So uh, you'll have to wait longer than April 14th, unfortunately.

1627
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:14,220
Well I mean, I think a lot of people are really focusing, especially the audience that would

1628
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:17,840
be really into Mortal Kombat and buying these games the day and date they come out.

1629
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:20,600
A lot of them are probably already on PlayStation four or Xbox one.

1630
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:25,320
So I don't imagine there's a huge audience for the 360 and PlayStation three versions,

1631
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:30,040
but I'm sure some people are feeling a little shafted by that, but Hey, as long as it works,

1632
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:31,040
that's the most important thing.

1633
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:32,480
It's got to work.

1634
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:36,180
Time Buster in our chat room over at live.vog network.com talking about Jason saying he

1635
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:42,240
should be any S Jason with a purple jumpsuit and a blue mask that, okay, that was a frightening

1636
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:44,240
ass Jason.

1637
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:45,240
That game.

1638
01:31:45,240 --> 01:31:46,240
Okay.

1639
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:47,240
Look, I know that game gets a lot of shit.

1640
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:48,320
I know that game gets a lot of shit.

1641
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:54,460
I don't like that game fucking terrified me when I was a kid, it was kind of glitchy and

1642
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:56,920
like kind of impossible to win.

1643
01:31:56,920 --> 01:32:01,060
But like when you are going in that house and it's the quote unquote first person mode

1644
01:32:01,060 --> 01:32:04,900
in the NES and you turn a corner and Jason is there.

1645
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:05,900
You shit your pants.

1646
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:06,900
Yes.

1647
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:07,900
It is.

1648
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:08,900
That's what it sounds like.

1649
01:32:08,900 --> 01:32:09,900
Yeah.

1650
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:13,500
Or when you encounter him on the road, like, fuck, you know, I was looking at a bird one

1651
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:20,060
minute and then like, I didn't even cool man, Jason.

1652
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:21,060
I agree.

1653
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:22,060
I'm in agreeance with you, Rob.

1654
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:23,060
So it was scary.

1655
01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:24,580
It was very scary.

1656
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:25,580
Yes.

1657
01:32:25,580 --> 01:32:27,340
Nothing in Mortal Kombat X would be scarier than purple jumpsuit.

1658
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:28,340
Jason.

1659
01:32:28,340 --> 01:32:29,340
Right.

1660
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:30,340
Just jumping out of the forest.

1661
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:31,740
Right.

1662
01:32:31,740 --> 01:32:32,740
And you shitting your pants.

1663
01:32:32,740 --> 01:32:33,740
Probably.

1664
01:32:33,740 --> 01:32:34,740
Probably.

1665
01:32:34,740 --> 01:32:39,860
Hey, Japanese release dates coming out in Japan on the PlayStation 4 on March 19th.

1666
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:43,460
Final Fantasy Type 0 HD gets its release in Japan as well.

1667
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:48,180
Biohazard Revelations 2, that's what they call Resident Evil over there.

1668
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:52,580
As well as Battlefield Hardline all on the PlayStation 4 this week in Japan.

1669
01:32:52,580 --> 01:32:57,160
On the Xbox 360, Battlefield Hardline there as well and Biohazard Revelations Final Fantasy

1670
01:32:57,160 --> 01:33:02,640
Type 0 HD and Azito Cross Tatsunoko Legends comes out over there.

1671
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:06,160
I did not know that was even something they were making, so that's pretty cool.

1672
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:11,280
On the PlayStation 3, Battlefield Hardline and Biohazard Revelations 2.

1673
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:15,120
And on the Wii U this week in Japan, I think we finally have some releases over there.

1674
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:19,560
We have Mario versus Donkey Kong, Mina de Mini Land comes out in Japan.

1675
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:21,260
I imagine that's...

1676
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:24,560
They have the Mario versus Donkey Kong, it's like the puzzle series.

1677
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:27,600
I imagine that's like an entry in that on the Wii U.

1678
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:31,280
And that's the big release on the Wii U this week in Japan.

1679
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:35,280
And lastly, looking at the handhelds here, we've got on the PlayStation Vita this week,

1680
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:43,680
Norn 9, Norn plus Nonet Last Era, Phantasy Star Online 2 Episode 3 Deluxe Package, pardon

1681
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:47,840
me while I fume that Phantasy Star Online Episode 2 is still not out over here.

1682
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:48,840
Phantasy...

1683
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:51,640
Excuse me, Phantasy Star Online 2 is still not out over here.

1684
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:55,760
That was you shitting your pants.

1685
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:56,760
Very upset.

1686
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:02,760
Minecraft PlayStation Vita comes out in Japan, and Iro Toridori no Sekai Worlds End Rebirth

1687
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:05,360
comes out on the Vita this week as well.

1688
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:11,000
Lastly, checking the 3DS, the 3DS this week gets Devil Summoner Soul Hackers, gets a price

1689
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:16,080
reduction going into the best collection from Atlus, Mario versus Donkey Kong, Mina de Mini

1690
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:17,080
Land.

1691
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:20,680
I think that's the game with the cross-buy on Nintendo, I think that's what Japan's getting

1692
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:24,800
this week, because it's on 3DS and it's on the Wii U.

1693
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:32,040
Prepara and Pretty Rhythm, Prepara de Sukairu Oshare Item 1450.

1694
01:34:32,040 --> 01:34:36,000
I don't know what Item 1450 is, but my god is this game pink.

1695
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,680
I kind of want it.

1696
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:38,680
You should get it.

1697
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:39,680
It looks like a rhythm game.

1698
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:42,440
It kind of looks like a rhythm game, like a Leap Eat Agents, but all the little icons

1699
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:46,520
are hearts, and she sparkles, and like a Leap Eat Agents, there's like a dude in a little

1700
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:49,100
beret, like he's dancing, like, hey, I'm dancing.

1701
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:50,200
So you're totally getting it.

1702
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:53,480
I totally want this, actually, Prepara and Pretty Rhythm.

1703
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:55,800
Akuma JP, is this something I want?

1704
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:59,680
I have to ask our Japanese correspondent, because he's actually, he would know.

1705
01:34:59,680 --> 01:35:02,080
Hai, sou desu ne.

1706
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:06,560
Thank you, Akuma.

1707
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:11,200
Moving on, that was it for releases, but I do want to talk about the UK, I know Dark

1708
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:16,960
Sakura's not here tonight, but she will usually talk about what is coming out in the UK, and

1709
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:24,240
for March the 19th, Worlds of Magic on the Mac and the PC, and on the 20th of March,

1710
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:30,600
Battlefield Hardline on everything, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One PC, Blade Storm Nightmare,

1711
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:36,520
Final Fantasy Type 0 HD, Mario Party 10, and Mario vs. Donkey Kong Tipping Stars, which

1712
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:40,840
is that same game as the Japanese one I was talking about, and Akuma JP has answered my

1713
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:44,640
question as to is this game worth my time, and he says no.

1714
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,640
Whatever.

1715
01:35:45,640 --> 01:35:47,920
You can't listen anymore.

1716
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:50,480
You do know I love Hatsune Miku, right?

1717
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:53,720
And I like some real bad games, I'm just saying.

1718
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:54,720
I think you should just...

1719
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:56,400
I did just sit here and talk about how much I love Friday the 13th.

1720
01:35:56,400 --> 01:36:00,080
Did you not even pick up that Sanrio game that was on the 3DS?

1721
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:01,080
I wanted to.

1722
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:04,600
I kind of want that more than I want Project Steam right now, but...

1723
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:05,600
What game is this?

1724
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:06,600
Is it the racing game?

1725
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:07,600
The Sanrio racing game.

1726
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:09,080
Oh my god, it looks so bad.

1727
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:12,240
It looks like an eight year old programmed it.

1728
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:13,240
It looks so bad.

1729
01:36:13,240 --> 01:36:14,440
So that means he wants it.

1730
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:15,440
Exactly.

1731
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:16,440
I get it.

1732
01:36:16,440 --> 01:36:17,440
I should.

1733
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:18,440
So I can play it.

1734
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:19,440
Exactly.

1735
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:20,440
Aha!

1736
01:36:20,440 --> 01:36:23,800
Alright, let's do one more story here and then we'll get to the classic game of the

1737
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:24,800
week.

1738
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:30,920
So, unfortunately, one of the first games that Kenji Inafune had mentioned that they

1739
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:40,920
were working on with his new studio, after he left Konami, Capcom, was Kao King of Pirates.

1740
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:43,520
That title has been cancelled.

1741
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:49,360
So apparently Marvelous had announced that they are scrapping that title.

1742
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:50,360
That's unfortunate.

1743
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:51,360
Yes.

1744
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:54,140
Especially for all the fans of him.

1745
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:55,140
That's too bad.

1746
01:36:55,140 --> 01:36:56,140
It looks pretty cool.

1747
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:58,720
Well, you'll never get to play it.

1748
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:02,160
Until ten years from now somebody finds it in a vault somewhere and releases it on the

1749
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:03,160
internet.

1750
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:04,160
Yeah.

1751
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:05,160
Oh well.

1752
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:06,160
There's always that to look forward to, right?

1753
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:11,680
Alright, well let's travel down memory lane and talk about a time that was a little simpler

1754
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:14,120
in gaming.

1755
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:16,400
The classic game of the week.

1756
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:20,120
Back when games came out, even if they were horrible and they weren't scrapped, whatever,

1757
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:23,240
no actually a lot of games were scrapped back in the day, but this game wasn't scrapped

1758
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:27,240
and it was great and I'm taking over tonight because usually Dark Sakura would step into

1759
01:37:27,240 --> 01:37:30,200
the vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you should be playing this game this

1760
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:31,200
week.

1761
01:37:31,200 --> 01:37:37,500
But since she isn't here, I'm stealing her segment, wahaha, with a game that I remember

1762
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:41,860
And now I'm really regretting this because Irene is going to taunt me endlessly for this

1763
01:37:41,860 --> 01:37:42,860
pick.

1764
01:37:42,860 --> 01:37:43,860
Yay!

1765
01:37:43,860 --> 01:37:48,660
Although, I honestly don't think you know this game whatsoever, but this game was rad.

1766
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:49,660
God.

1767
01:37:49,660 --> 01:37:50,780
Alright, this game was rad.

1768
01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:51,780
I love this game.

1769
01:37:51,780 --> 01:37:55,820
I played a lot of it when I was growing up.

1770
01:37:55,820 --> 01:37:58,020
It is a PC game I've picked tonight.

1771
01:37:58,020 --> 01:38:00,180
It is a Sierra game that I've picked.

1772
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:02,660
You're making a face there.

1773
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:07,300
The classic game of the week this week is...

1774
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:08,300
Jones in the Fastlane.

1775
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:09,300
Oh, God.

1776
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:12,700
Have you ever played Jones in the Fastlane?

1777
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:14,860
No, I don't play crap.

1778
01:38:14,860 --> 01:38:16,340
You don't even know what this game is.

1779
01:38:16,340 --> 01:38:17,340
This game is amazing.

1780
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:18,340
Exactly.

1781
01:38:18,340 --> 01:38:19,340
Shut up.

1782
01:38:19,340 --> 01:38:20,340
You don't know what you're talking about.

1783
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:21,340
Alright.

1784
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:22,340
You don't know me.

1785
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:23,340
Are we going to get dysentery?

1786
01:38:23,340 --> 01:38:24,340
You might, from this game.

1787
01:38:24,340 --> 01:38:25,340
Okay, here it is.

1788
01:38:25,340 --> 01:38:30,520
Jones in the Fastlane was a game that was created by Sierra in 1990 and it was kind

1789
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:33,440
of like a board game-ish type of game.

1790
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:35,680
Is it because the people who played it were really bored?

1791
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:39,320
No, like a Monopoly type of board game.

1792
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:43,620
This game also was notable because there was a floppy disk version that would allow people

1793
01:38:43,620 --> 01:38:45,900
to have the little speech bubbles when they talked to me.

1794
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:47,960
What's a floppy disk?

1795
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:50,120
It's... you stick it in.

1796
01:38:50,120 --> 01:38:54,640
It's a little disk and you stick it in and it's full of data.

1797
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:59,060
So like, you know when you save in Word or something and there's that little symbol that

1798
01:38:59,060 --> 01:39:00,760
nobody knows what it is.

1799
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:01,760
Nobody knows what that is.

1800
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:03,340
That's totally a floppy disk.

1801
01:39:03,340 --> 01:39:04,340
What?

1802
01:39:04,340 --> 01:39:05,340
Right.

1803
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:06,900
You mean that same thing?

1804
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:09,420
How the fuck do you not know what a floppy disk is?

1805
01:39:09,420 --> 01:39:11,240
You're older than me.

1806
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:12,500
Not to like put you on blast or something.

1807
01:39:12,500 --> 01:39:14,260
She's only interested in hard drives.

1808
01:39:14,260 --> 01:39:15,260
Yeah.

1809
01:39:15,260 --> 01:39:16,260
Hard drives.

1810
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:17,260
I see what you did there.

1811
01:39:17,260 --> 01:39:18,260
Alright, look.

1812
01:39:18,260 --> 01:39:20,500
Can I talk about Jones in the Fastlane, please?

1813
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:24,940
Not only was it a game that you could get on floppy disk, but it was on CD-ROM.

1814
01:39:24,940 --> 01:39:28,420
And if you got it on CD, it was completely voice acted.

1815
01:39:28,420 --> 01:39:32,780
All the little employees of the little places you would go on the board, such as Monolith

1816
01:39:32,780 --> 01:39:37,340
Burger and Socket City, would actually talk to you.

1817
01:39:37,340 --> 01:39:40,300
Oh, this does not sound good at all.

1818
01:39:40,300 --> 01:39:42,780
No, this game was amazing.

1819
01:39:42,780 --> 01:39:43,780
Was it?

1820
01:39:43,780 --> 01:39:50,980
Stop making fun of this game with, you know, Monolith Burger and Z-Mart and QT clothing.

1821
01:39:50,980 --> 01:39:54,540
Oh god, it's hurting so bad.

1822
01:39:54,540 --> 01:39:58,300
So what you did is you moved your little marble because that's what represented you

1823
01:39:58,300 --> 01:39:59,340
like a real board game.

1824
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:03,460
You would move it around the board and as you went to these different places on the

1825
01:40:03,460 --> 01:40:05,140
board, you were a marble.

1826
01:40:05,140 --> 01:40:09,860
Yeah, you were represented by a marble, but you actually had a little dude on the screen

1827
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:14,820
or doodad if you wanted to play, would walk like as the marbles going, the little dude

1828
01:40:14,820 --> 01:40:15,820
would walk.

1829
01:40:15,820 --> 01:40:20,220
It was on CD-ROM and it had voice acting and you were represented by a marble.

1830
01:40:20,220 --> 01:40:27,820
Because that was supposed to give it the board game feel also because we didn't want

1831
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:35,380
to animate anything, but what board game has a fucking marble?

1832
01:40:35,380 --> 01:40:37,860
Your pieces will just roll off the game.

1833
01:40:37,860 --> 01:40:40,460
Mouse trap doesn't have a packman board game.

1834
01:40:40,460 --> 01:40:43,620
It's like a hundred marbles, but it's not your piece.

1835
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:45,980
What activated the goddamn mouse trap?

1836
01:40:45,980 --> 01:40:47,460
It was a fucking marble, Irene.

1837
01:40:47,460 --> 01:40:49,940
But did it have one that you moved around?

1838
01:40:49,940 --> 01:40:50,940
I don't know.

1839
01:40:50,940 --> 01:40:51,940
I don't know.

1840
01:40:51,940 --> 01:40:52,940
Okay.

1841
01:40:52,940 --> 01:40:53,940
I fucking own the mouse trap.

1842
01:40:53,940 --> 01:40:54,940
Rob.

1843
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:57,340
Don't fucking try to school me on my own games.

1844
01:40:57,340 --> 01:40:58,340
Okay.

1845
01:40:58,340 --> 01:40:59,340
Okay.

1846
01:40:59,340 --> 01:41:02,420
That is the least logical piece.

1847
01:41:02,420 --> 01:41:03,420
I feel like for a board game.

1848
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:04,700
I'm going to put this on a board.

1849
01:41:04,700 --> 01:41:06,580
Thank God my board is completely level.

1850
01:41:06,580 --> 01:41:07,580
Oh, wait.

1851
01:41:07,580 --> 01:41:08,820
It just rolled off the board.

1852
01:41:08,820 --> 01:41:11,020
Oh, there I go down the hill.

1853
01:41:11,020 --> 01:41:12,020
Right.

1854
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:18,180
That just would not be my first or second or like ten thousandth choice for a piece.

1855
01:41:18,180 --> 01:41:20,660
Anyway, monolith burger or something.

1856
01:41:20,660 --> 01:41:21,660
Yeah.

1857
01:41:21,660 --> 01:41:22,660
Burger time.

1858
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:27,940
So look, you move around the board with your marble with and you're only limited by whatever

1859
01:41:27,940 --> 01:41:30,180
time is left in the week in a turn.

1860
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:33,620
And when you move to a new location, you lose a little bit of time and you do things that

1861
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:35,740
you would do like IRL.

1862
01:41:35,740 --> 01:41:41,180
You would work or you would try to get an education or you would just sleep all day.

1863
01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:42,180
You can also.

1864
01:41:42,180 --> 01:41:43,180
That's what I would do.

1865
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:44,180
I know.

1866
01:41:44,180 --> 01:41:45,180
I know that.

1867
01:41:45,180 --> 01:41:46,180
So your marble wouldn't go anywhere.

1868
01:41:46,180 --> 01:41:50,020
Your marble would be calling the cable company going, I want my HBO.

1869
01:41:50,020 --> 01:41:56,060
I can't afford cable.

1870
01:41:56,060 --> 01:42:00,100
And then at the end of every turn, you would be going through the oh, what a weekend event

1871
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:04,420
where you would lose money usually or you might gain money depending on what you did

1872
01:42:04,420 --> 01:42:05,420
that week.

1873
01:42:05,420 --> 01:42:08,180
What if you're sleeping and then how would you lose money?

1874
01:42:08,180 --> 01:42:09,420
It's like a monopoly.

1875
01:42:09,420 --> 01:42:12,980
You draw a card and you can win ten dollars in a beauty contest, even if you wouldn't

1876
01:42:12,980 --> 01:42:13,980
actually.

1877
01:42:13,980 --> 01:42:15,940
It's weird because I never left my house.

1878
01:42:15,940 --> 01:42:20,460
It's like, did they come into my house and see me on my bed and they're like, man, you're

1879
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:21,460
so beautiful.

1880
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:22,460
Here's ten dollars.

1881
01:42:22,460 --> 01:42:23,980
That seems kind of creepy.

1882
01:42:23,980 --> 01:42:28,220
Well, you would get little humorous anecdotes that was very common for Sierra at the time.

1883
01:42:28,220 --> 01:42:32,940
For example, you went to Las Vegas in a twenty thousand dollar car and then you came back

1884
01:42:32,940 --> 01:42:35,940
in a two hundred thousand dollar Greyhound bus.

1885
01:42:35,940 --> 01:42:37,460
That's huh.

1886
01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:38,460
Get it?

1887
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:39,460
Clever.

1888
01:42:39,460 --> 01:42:40,460
You lost the car because you went to.

1889
01:42:40,460 --> 01:42:41,460
Yeah.

1890
01:42:41,460 --> 01:42:42,460
No, I get it.

1891
01:42:42,460 --> 01:42:43,460
I'm on board.

1892
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:45,940
Dude, where's your car?

1893
01:42:45,940 --> 01:42:49,740
The object of the game is to be the first player to achieve one hundred percent success.

1894
01:42:49,740 --> 01:42:56,020
You reach four goals, wealth, happiness, education and career by having a certain amount of money

1895
01:42:56,020 --> 01:43:02,320
in the bank, happiness by getting other goals like acquiring goods and taking time off work,

1896
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:07,420
education by going through all the university things and then career by climbing the career

1897
01:43:07,420 --> 01:43:13,780
ladder into management participation or whatever at the job.

1898
01:43:13,780 --> 01:43:16,180
So it sounds like the game of life.

1899
01:43:16,180 --> 01:43:17,180
It kind of is.

1900
01:43:17,180 --> 01:43:19,100
Monopoly and marbles.

1901
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:24,500
It's like it's like life, monopoly and marbles all together without the pink peg and the

1902
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:26,140
blue peg that you put in your car.

1903
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:27,140
That's the only thing.

1904
01:43:27,140 --> 01:43:28,140
You have a marble instead.

1905
01:43:28,140 --> 01:43:29,140
No deal then.

1906
01:43:29,140 --> 01:43:30,140
All right.

1907
01:43:30,140 --> 01:43:33,020
Anyway, sometimes you can lose the game as well.

1908
01:43:33,020 --> 01:43:38,160
For example, you can get your money stolen by Wild Willy and Wild Willy may actually

1909
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:46,340
rip off Wild Willy may actually rip you off at the low cost housing apartments and might

1910
01:43:46,340 --> 01:43:48,260
steal your TV and your VCR.

1911
01:43:48,260 --> 01:43:49,260
I'm sorry.

1912
01:43:49,260 --> 01:43:50,260
This is horrible.

1913
01:43:50,260 --> 01:43:52,880
I stole the TV.

1914
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:54,980
This is no.

1915
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:58,840
But Wild Willy can never get into the security apartments.

1916
01:43:58,840 --> 01:44:02,020
So there you go.

1917
01:44:02,020 --> 01:44:06,260
The game was notable for having a voice actors that were actually like they were actually

1918
01:44:06,260 --> 01:44:09,980
like motion captured and they actually would talk through some of the silly little jokes

1919
01:44:09,980 --> 01:44:12,140
in the game and so forth.

1920
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:16,500
But if you were too poor for a CD-ROM drive, which a lot of us were at the time, you could

1921
01:44:16,500 --> 01:44:18,820
get the version that was on floppy disk.

1922
01:44:18,820 --> 01:44:20,420
Why did you look at me when you said that?

1923
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:21,420
I'm just saying.

1924
01:44:21,420 --> 01:44:22,420
Fuck Rob.

1925
01:44:22,420 --> 01:44:23,420
Just wanted you to know.

1926
01:44:23,420 --> 01:44:24,860
Because you're a poor college student.

1927
01:44:24,860 --> 01:44:28,020
Just because someone lives in Section 8 housing doesn't mean they're a criminal.

1928
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:29,020
Okay.

1929
01:44:29,020 --> 01:44:30,020
I'm just going to put that out there.

1930
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:32,220
What a terrible game.

1931
01:44:32,220 --> 01:44:33,940
All right.

1932
01:44:33,940 --> 01:44:37,580
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

1933
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:41,460
Bobby is saying this is the first classic game of the week where the host bashed a choice

1934
01:44:41,460 --> 01:44:42,460
frown.

1935
01:44:42,460 --> 01:44:46,820
Hey, first off, those two aren't hosts.

1936
01:44:46,820 --> 01:44:48,060
And now you know why.

1937
01:44:48,060 --> 01:44:50,660
It just sounds terrible.

1938
01:44:50,660 --> 01:44:52,180
And B, you need to play it.

1939
01:44:52,180 --> 01:44:56,780
And Bobby is actually going on to say, really sucks that people on the show are bashing

1940
01:44:56,780 --> 01:44:58,140
it and calling it horrible.

1941
01:44:58,140 --> 01:44:59,660
This game was actually really awesome.

1942
01:44:59,660 --> 01:45:01,420
And I actually agree.

1943
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:04,620
It's you never, you weren't even around to play this game.

1944
01:45:04,620 --> 01:45:06,860
That's why you never got a chance to get obsessed with it.

1945
01:45:06,860 --> 01:45:08,540
Well, yeah, because I was poor growing up.

1946
01:45:08,540 --> 01:45:10,860
I had like a cardboard box for a computer.

1947
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:13,900
So don't be mad at the people that can play Jones in the fast lane.

1948
01:45:13,900 --> 01:45:20,020
Just because to your description of the game, Rob, that's the only experience I have.

1949
01:45:20,020 --> 01:45:22,100
And it sounds preposterous.

1950
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:23,100
It's not preposterous.

1951
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:24,980
Do you want a handful of ketchup packets with that?

1952
01:45:24,980 --> 01:45:28,420
I read off the screen just now.

1953
01:45:28,420 --> 01:45:31,980
You lost me at marble is what I'm saying.

1954
01:45:31,980 --> 01:45:34,820
But do you not see the little animated characters that walk on the screen as well?

1955
01:45:34,820 --> 01:45:38,740
I do, but I also see the marble very clearly and it's kind of just clouding.

1956
01:45:38,740 --> 01:45:40,340
The marble's just distracting.

1957
01:45:40,340 --> 01:45:42,260
You are really bothered by that damn marble, aren't you?

1958
01:45:42,260 --> 01:45:43,260
I'm so fucking bothered by it.

1959
01:45:43,260 --> 01:45:45,540
You've lost your marbles.

1960
01:45:45,540 --> 01:45:48,340
You have a degree in junior college.

1961
01:45:48,340 --> 01:45:49,780
That's going to do a lot for you.

1962
01:45:49,780 --> 01:45:50,780
The junior college.

1963
01:45:50,780 --> 01:45:55,060
Oh, this was like in the what, 90s or something or late 80s?

1964
01:45:55,060 --> 01:45:57,540
Anyway, 1990 is when this game came out.

1965
01:45:57,540 --> 01:45:59,740
Yeah, so that would have actually had some value.

1966
01:45:59,740 --> 01:46:02,340
And he didn't get the job because he didn't have enough education.

1967
01:46:02,340 --> 01:46:03,340
Dumbass.

1968
01:46:03,340 --> 01:46:05,060
All right.

1969
01:46:05,060 --> 01:46:06,060
There it is.

1970
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:07,060
Your classic game of the week.

1971
01:46:07,060 --> 01:46:10,260
Jones and the fast lane, which don't listen to these three.

1972
01:46:10,260 --> 01:46:13,060
This game is actually a lot of fun.

1973
01:46:13,060 --> 01:46:15,060
It's on YouTube, but you can also check out.

1974
01:46:15,060 --> 01:46:18,020
Apparently they did like a flash remake of it.

1975
01:46:18,020 --> 01:46:21,260
Not that long ago in 2006, I guess it was a little while ago.

1976
01:46:21,260 --> 01:46:23,980
They actually ported this like a version of it over to flash.

1977
01:46:23,980 --> 01:46:24,980
So you can check this out.

1978
01:46:24,980 --> 01:46:29,580
Although I don't believe that is something that is officially endorsed, but you can draw

1979
01:46:29,580 --> 01:46:34,060
your own conclusions by looking it up on like YouTube or I'm just checking out, you know,

1980
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:35,540
it makes this game better.

1981
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:36,540
Hmm.

1982
01:46:36,540 --> 01:46:38,100
It had amiibo support.

1983
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:40,900
No, no amiibo support in this game.

1984
01:46:40,900 --> 01:46:41,900
And there you go.

1985
01:46:41,900 --> 01:46:43,820
That's why I just can't play it then.

1986
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:44,820
All right.

1987
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:45,820
Sorry to hear that.

1988
01:46:45,820 --> 01:46:48,660
I also probably can't play because my computer is probably way too fast for that now.

1989
01:46:48,660 --> 01:46:52,060
And you know, I want me to say, you know, those old games, you try to play them now.

1990
01:46:52,060 --> 01:46:54,300
It's just like, sorry, your computer's too good to play this.

1991
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:59,060
I'm not, I don't think this particular game is available on like good old games, but one

1992
01:46:59,060 --> 01:47:02,940
of those ones that was archive, didn't they have like that big internet game archive thing

1993
01:47:02,940 --> 01:47:05,300
that, uh, oh, good question.

1994
01:47:05,300 --> 01:47:09,780
Uh, I w there were other Sierra games from that timeframe on it, so I don't see why Jones

1995
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:10,780
wouldn't be on there.

1996
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:11,780
We'll check it out there.

1997
01:47:11,780 --> 01:47:15,260
Lobby desk version, not the CD version, cause that would be too much space.

1998
01:47:15,260 --> 01:47:16,420
All right.

1999
01:47:16,420 --> 01:47:18,180
Not that much space nowadays on the internet.

2000
01:47:18,180 --> 01:47:19,740
So all right.

2001
01:47:19,740 --> 01:47:20,740
Well stay tuned guys.

2002
01:47:20,740 --> 01:47:21,900
We've got plenty more show to come.

2003
01:47:21,900 --> 01:47:26,380
We have some rapid fire news, the Fuqua question of the week and some more news mailbag a few

2004
01:47:26,380 --> 01:47:27,380

And yes, a chance for you to call in when we come back after this with more of orange

2007
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:45,780
Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio live on this March the 15th of 2015 with episode

2008
01:47:45,780 --> 01:47:49,460
number 590 of our show in progress.

2009
01:47:49,460 --> 01:47:53,980
Uh, Loki here with me tonight, not here tonight, dark Sakura.

2010
01:47:53,980 --> 01:47:59,260
Um, but here joining us in studio, um, Irene and mystique who have for the first time in

2011
01:47:59,260 --> 01:48:06,720
our 590 a year history, uh, ruined the classic game of the week segment here on orange lounge

2012
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:07,720
radio.

2013
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:08,720
You're gonna have to get used to it.

2014
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:09,720
That's all right.

2015
01:48:09,720 --> 01:48:13,180
Actually, we were talking off air a little bit about like, you know, I was kinda like,

2016
01:48:13,180 --> 01:48:17,420
now, now seriously now this is why people love this game with the whole like Sierra

2017
01:48:17,420 --> 01:48:18,420
era and all that.

2018
01:48:18,460 --> 01:48:20,660
But you were mentioning you play King's quest.

2019
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:21,940
So you know that era a little bit.

2020
01:48:21,940 --> 01:48:22,940
I do.

2021
01:48:22,940 --> 01:48:23,940
I do.

2022
01:48:23,940 --> 01:48:24,940
Yeah.

2023
01:48:24,940 --> 01:48:27,460
I mean, who hates King quest King's quest for now I might let you get away with that

2024
01:48:27,460 --> 01:48:31,820
sass with Jones and the fast lane, but if this was King's quest for I talked about tonight,

2025
01:48:31,820 --> 01:48:33,340
I would not be having that sass.

2026
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:37,700
There was one that I remember where like you start off in the town and blah, blah, blah.

2027
01:48:37,700 --> 01:48:40,920
And then there was this pier that you could walk to see that you could go on the ship

2028
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:43,100
and then sail to another Island or something.

2029
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:47,340
And then there was like this one part where this kid like tempts you to take a swim.

2030
01:48:47,340 --> 01:48:48,340
I'm almost positive.

2031
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:50,260
I think it is five.

2032
01:48:50,260 --> 01:48:54,420
And then like you just jump in and you die and it's like, I'm pretty sure it's five.

2033
01:48:54,420 --> 01:48:55,420
Like I was so mad.

2034
01:48:55,420 --> 01:48:59,460
I was a lot of King's quest games though, but I just, I guess that was my first experience

2035
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:00,460
and I was just so mad.

2036
01:49:00,460 --> 01:49:04,260
I was like, I was not expecting that cause it was just stupid.

2037
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:07,460
There was a certain level of dark humor in a lot of those old Sierra games.

2038
01:49:07,460 --> 01:49:11,700
You know, it just, I didn't know what triggered it or anything.

2039
01:49:11,700 --> 01:49:15,100
It was just, I came out of the boat and he's like, Oh, it looks like a really nice day

2040
01:49:15,100 --> 01:49:16,100
for a swim.

2041
01:49:16,100 --> 01:49:19,620
I think I'm going to go commit suicide now.

2042
01:49:19,620 --> 01:49:21,540
You don't notice the little shark fan in the background.

2043
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:22,540
Anyway.

2044
01:49:22,540 --> 01:49:23,540
No, no, I guess I'm stupid.

2045
01:49:23,540 --> 01:49:24,540
All right.

2046
01:49:24,540 --> 01:49:28,500
Uh, anyhow, I know you, you gals can't stay a whole lot longer, but I do want to make

2047
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:31,060
sure Irene, you have a chance to plug cause you do your own podcast.

2048
01:49:31,060 --> 01:49:33,260
I want to make sure you have a chance to plug it.

2049
01:49:33,260 --> 01:49:37,220
Um, I just saw Piper not that long ago and I know he's on the show as well.

2050
01:49:37,220 --> 01:49:38,900
So tell us about, uh, multi-tap.

2051
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:39,980
Oh, okay.

2052
01:49:39,980 --> 01:49:42,160
So it's like a video game podcast.

2053
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:44,580
It's kind of retro, but kind of not.

2054
01:49:44,580 --> 01:49:47,620
Let me just kind of talk about whatever we want cause we're like that.

2055
01:49:47,620 --> 01:49:53,380
Um, so it's at ffop.net, which is short for fistful of potions.

2056
01:49:53,380 --> 01:49:56,220
You could also do fistfulofpotions.net, I guess.

2057
01:49:56,220 --> 01:49:57,220
I don't know.

2058
01:49:57,220 --> 01:50:02,780
Um, so come and listen to us cause we're cool and fun and interesting.

2059
01:50:02,780 --> 01:50:07,300
Now, now when do I get to come on your show and sass all the games that you like?

2060
01:50:07,300 --> 01:50:08,740
When the fuck ever you want.

2061
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:09,740
Awesome.

2062
01:50:09,740 --> 01:50:10,740
I can't wait.

2063
01:50:10,740 --> 01:50:14,380
You won't because all of our games are perfect and beautiful.

2064
01:50:14,380 --> 01:50:18,220
Unless you're having the Super Metroid special when I'm there, I'll find something.

2065
01:50:18,220 --> 01:50:19,220
We might.

2066
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:21,700
We love Super Metroid in the house.

2067
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:22,700
I'd be okay with that.

2068
01:50:22,700 --> 01:50:23,700
I'd be okay with that.

2069
01:50:23,700 --> 01:50:24,700
All right.

2070
01:50:24,700 --> 01:50:27,860
Uh, anyhow, tonight, uh, we do not actually have a forum followup segment tonight since

2071
01:50:27,860 --> 01:50:29,420
we had last week's show off.

2072
01:50:29,420 --> 01:50:32,420
We're going to table that to next week, but don't forget that you can participate in our

2073
01:50:32,420 --> 01:50:36,560
forums over at vog network.com slash forums, and we will definitely post some followup

2074
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:39,100
topics for us to expand the conversation on.

2075
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:43,020
I'm really anticipating we're going to talk a little more on the forums about this whole

2076
01:50:43,020 --> 01:50:47,500
Konami and programmed world thing because, uh, just the fact that even I admitted there

2077
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:49,280
really is not an easy answer to this.

2078
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:53,220
I can really truly see like both sides of it where it's like on one hand, I understand

2079
01:50:53,220 --> 01:50:57,260
how, you know, Konami wants to protect, you know, some of the revenue that they get in

2080
01:50:57,260 --> 01:51:01,740
Japan and these other agreements, but at the same time, gamers desperate to play these

2081
01:51:01,740 --> 01:51:04,700
games that get their only option really cut off.

2082
01:51:04,700 --> 01:51:06,180
So I want to talk and dive deeper into that.

2083
01:51:06,180 --> 01:51:09,300
So we'll do that on the forums and we'll talk about some of that follow up next week.

2084
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:12,380
Uh, but for now we have some rapid fire news.

2085
01:51:12,380 --> 01:51:14,340
So some quick news stories starting with Loki.

2086
01:51:14,340 --> 01:51:15,340
All right.

2087
01:51:15,340 --> 01:51:19,140
Um, so let's start off with, I'm pretty excited about this.

2088
01:51:19,140 --> 01:51:23,820
Goat Simulator is coming to Xbox one and Xbox 360 cause it runs like shit on my PC.

2089
01:51:23,820 --> 01:51:29,460
So I'm, I'm down with that and that's going to be sometime in April and they're promising

2090
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:32,820
it'll be just as buggy as it is on PC.

2091
01:51:32,820 --> 01:51:34,980
Will it have all the extra stuff that they put in like the MMO?

2092
01:51:34,980 --> 01:51:35,980
I think it will, yeah.

2093
01:51:35,980 --> 01:51:36,980
Oh God, that's great.

2094
01:51:36,980 --> 01:51:39,100
So I will definitely be picking that up.

2095
01:51:39,180 --> 01:51:44,300
I think you would like, uh, Goat Simulator, Irene, it's a stupid, stupid game.

2096
01:51:44,300 --> 01:51:45,300
Yeah.

2097
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:46,300
You like stupid stuff.

2098
01:51:46,300 --> 01:51:47,300
I do.

2099
01:51:47,300 --> 01:51:48,300
That's why I'm friends with you.

2100
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:52,940
You fucking set that up Rob, that was your own fault.

2101
01:51:52,940 --> 01:51:53,940
I don't think you're stupid.

2102
01:51:53,940 --> 01:51:54,940
You're cool Rob.

2103
01:51:54,940 --> 01:52:01,260
And in fan service game news, uh, Oni Chambara Z2 is going to be headed, um, to North America

2104
01:52:01,260 --> 01:52:02,260
this summer.

2105
01:52:02,260 --> 01:52:06,960
Um, Europe, it's going to be out in the fall and if you're not familiar with Oni Chambara,

2106
01:52:06,960 --> 01:52:12,240
it's basically some chick wearing a really skimpy lingerie and a cowboy hat fighting

2107
01:52:12,240 --> 01:52:14,800
monsters with a samurai sword.

2108
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:15,800
All right.

2109
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:16,800
I'm in.

2110
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:17,800
How's that different from Oni Chambara?

2111
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:19,800
No, I know Oni Chambara.

2112
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:26,200
They even have DLC outfits that include like one that's two strawberries and a banana.

2113
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:27,840
That is all that's covering them up.

2114
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:28,840
Two strawberries and banana.

2115
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:29,840
Alrighty.

2116
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:40,160
Um, and then on the 3DS, uh, Senren Kagura 2 is coming, um, this summer to the 3DS and

2117
01:52:40,160 --> 01:52:43,720
they're also having some special editions coming out with that as well.

2118
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:49,180
Uh, the Double D and Happy Boobs edition will be coming out.

2119
01:52:49,180 --> 01:52:51,320
So it's about me?

2120
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:56,560
It's about, yeah, it's about, uh, chicks that fight each other in their clothes.

2121
01:52:56,560 --> 01:53:00,640
All you single fellas, um, they're talking about me.

2122
01:53:00,640 --> 01:53:08,040
I don't know what you're talking about because I'm gay and I play this game, so it sounds

2123
01:53:08,040 --> 01:53:09,040
like fun.

2124
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:10,040
All right.

2125
01:53:10,040 --> 01:53:13,320
But I'm also for equal opportunity, so I believe we should have men and the clothes fly off

2126
01:53:13,320 --> 01:53:14,320
as well.

2127
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:15,320
I agree.

2128
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:16,320
I'm all for that.

2129
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:17,320
I would play that game.

2130
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:23,920
That would be, um, uh, Akiba, Akibahara, um, or Akiba's Trip.

2131
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:24,920
That's what it was.

2132
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:27,080
Sexual Close Tossing Part 3.

2133
01:53:27,080 --> 01:53:28,080
I don't know.

2134
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:29,080
Akiba's Trip.

2135
01:53:29,080 --> 01:53:30,080
That would be the one you'd want to play.

2136
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:31,080
That's what it translates to.

2137
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:32,080
Anyways.

2138
01:53:32,080 --> 01:53:35,400
Um, and then of course they have, uh, Chroma Squad that's going to be coming out April

2139
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:36,400
30th.

2140
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:42,600
This was the Kickstarter game that was kind of like a, uh, Super Sentai sim, if you will.

2141
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:49,440
Um, and that's going to be coming out on PC, Mac, and Linux April 30th, so, um, Shane will

2142
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:50,440
be happy about that.

2143
01:53:50,440 --> 01:53:51,440
I'm sure he will.

2144
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:55,760
Um, talking about 3DS, uh, and the SpotPass.

2145
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:57,380
There is a SpotPass exploit.

2146
01:53:57,380 --> 01:54:01,840
This actually pisses me off, kinda, because, and I know the old saying hackers gonna hack

2147
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:02,840
and I get it.

2148
01:54:02,840 --> 01:54:06,480
And I also know it wasn't even a hack, it's just a glitch.

2149
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:07,480
I know.

2150
01:54:07,480 --> 01:54:08,480
Well, it still sucks.

2151
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:13,160
And I know this sucks for, uh, you know, people who might live in areas where they hardly ever

2152
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:17,960
street pass with people, but look, one of my crowning achievements of PAX East is that

2153
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:23,760
I finished all those fucking puzzles, finally, 1,502 pieces, mine.

2154
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:28,400
I have every puzzle finished, including the one that those jerks at Nintendo dropped on

2155
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:33,360
us Sunday morning, the day of the show, the new Monster Hunter puzzle, finished them all.

2156
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:37,840
And now to hear that, oh, thanks to this exploit, people will just be able to do that.

2157
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:39,560
Well, alright, alright, here's the deal.

2158
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:44,280
Uh, you use your special Mii character, like, uh, the Abraham Lincoln Mii that's sent to

2159
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:48,560
promote codename Steam in all the StreetPass minigames you own.

2160
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:55,320
You turn off StreetPass and SpotPass, delete the Mii, close Mii Plaza, open it again and

2161
01:54:55,320 --> 01:54:59,400
reactivate, and the Mii character will come right back.

2162
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:03,360
So you basically tricked the system into thinking you never got the character in the first place

2163
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:05,840
by deleting all traces of it.

2164
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:10,320
And, uh, there's, uh, more information on the glitch if you wanna see it on YouTube,

2165
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:13,480
and I realize you might be thinking, well, then why are you sharing it here, Rob, on

2166
01:55:13,480 --> 01:55:15,120
how to do it if it makes you mad?

2167
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:19,040
Because it's not like y'all don't know how to use Google, you'd find it anyway, but that's

2168
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:21,080
essentially how you do it.

2169
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:22,560
But, uh, you know what?

2170
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:26,900
My achievement is better than yours if you do this to get all your puzzle pieces.

2171
01:55:26,900 --> 01:55:28,240
My achievement's better than yours.

2172
01:55:28,240 --> 01:55:29,240
Uh, nuh-huh.

2173
01:55:29,240 --> 01:55:30,240
How many puzzle pieces do you have?

2174
01:55:30,240 --> 01:55:32,240
Well, I'm gonna get them all now.

2175
01:55:32,240 --> 01:55:33,800
Yeah, thank you, Rob.

2176
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:34,800
Ditto.

2177
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:35,800
Cheating cheaters.

2178
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:36,800
Alright.

2179
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:37,800
Anyhow, well, you know what?

2180
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:40,320
My 3DS has a dead battery right now, so you won't be getting any from me.

2181
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:41,720
Did you even bring your 3DS?

2182
01:55:41,720 --> 01:55:42,720
No.

2183
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:44,960
Mine played that for, like, five months.

2184
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:45,960
Jeez.

2185
01:55:45,960 --> 01:55:46,960
Yeah.

2186
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:47,960
Anyway.

2187
01:55:47,960 --> 01:55:48,960
Aw, you played longer than me.

2188
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:49,960
I think this is really cool.

2189
01:55:49,960 --> 01:55:55,000
Um, this is an innovation in the arcade and, uh, in the arcade industry, and it has to

2190
01:55:55,000 --> 01:56:00,680
do with, uh, more, um, I guess, I don't wanna say, like, cross-play, but more, like, I guess,

2191
01:56:00,680 --> 01:56:06,320
synergy between your phone or smart device and the arcade game itself.

2192
01:56:06,320 --> 01:56:10,320
And who knew it's being brought to us from the music game world and an indie in the music

2193
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:13,600
game world that we hear about all the time, Neon FM.

2194
01:56:13,600 --> 01:56:17,200
I mean, we were hearing about this game, like, 10 years ago, and it seems like now we've

2195
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:19,920
got this arcade prototype that's going with it.

2196
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:23,960
And the cool thing about Neon FM and what they're showing, and I gotta admit, I really

2197
01:56:23,960 --> 01:56:29,160
enjoyed this, was that, um, Unit E Technologies, who's, uh, making this game, they're going

2198
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:34,040
to be linking the arcade version of the game and a smartphone version of the game.

2199
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:37,640
So what you do is, I guess, you, like, you scan a QR code and you can get your avatar

2200
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:40,440
and all your information in the game that it imports from your app.

2201
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:44,880
But this is really cool as well, is that if the smartphone app recognizes that you're

2202
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:50,480
near the machine, I guess, through a Wi-Fi connection or something that it would identify,

2203
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:55,680
you can actually play the songs on your phone that the person is playing on the machine

2204
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:57,160
at the same time.

2205
01:56:57,160 --> 01:57:00,320
And then the score that you get on your phone is displayed on the screen.

2206
01:57:00,320 --> 01:57:05,120
So like, remember back in the day when Para Para Paradise was the, Paradise, Para Para

2207
01:57:05,120 --> 01:57:07,520
Paradise was the big game that everybody was playing.

2208
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:08,520
And like, what would happen?

2209
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:12,440
One person would be dancing on the machine and everybody else behind them doing the same

2210
01:57:12,440 --> 01:57:13,440
thing.

2211
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:17,600
Now it's kind of like that, but with your smartphone, you're playing the game and then

2212
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:19,440
all the scores display on the screen.

2213
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:23,600
So I think that's kind of, kind of neat, kind of a different way to do it.

2214
01:57:23,600 --> 01:57:24,600
Yeah.

2215
01:57:24,600 --> 01:57:27,720
So something kind of new and, you know, props to these guys for being the ones to bring

2216
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:28,720
it to.

2217
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:33,000
I'm glad they're doing it, but at the same time, I think it also kind of, I mean, not

2218
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:37,640
that it really needs to have them do it, but it kind of promotes that, oh, let's put

2219
01:57:37,640 --> 01:57:42,000
more smartphone games in the arcade, like, you know, the fucking Fruit Ninja and Doodle

2220
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,400
Jump and that nonsense.

2221
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:46,680
Now it's like, have it at the same time.

2222
01:57:46,680 --> 01:57:50,980
It's really exciting to kind of hear about all these initiatives to kind of bring the

2223
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:52,240
arcade back.

2224
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:57,120
You know, despite however you feel about the Konami situation, the deal is that you have

2225
01:57:57,120 --> 01:58:01,400
this company, Round One, that's trying to bring that arcade thing back, you know, to

2226
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:04,960
all these different places around the country, and that's cool.

2227
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:07,960
And then you have this, where you talk about, like, this is a new innovation to try and

2228
01:58:07,960 --> 01:58:11,400
energize, you know, participation at the arcade.

2229
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:15,580
And I think these are ideas that are going to push things forward as opposed to falling

2230
01:58:15,580 --> 01:58:20,260
further down this hole of ticket redemption games and nothing but, you know, Las Vegas

2231
01:58:20,260 --> 01:58:22,120
for children, apparently.

2232
01:58:22,120 --> 01:58:27,900
Anyway, Bonds006 in the chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com saying, Neon FM is the shit.

2233
01:58:27,900 --> 01:58:31,160
You get the QR code, QR code, excuse me, and when you make an account, you can track your

2234
01:58:31,160 --> 01:58:32,160
progress.

2235
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:35,680
Neon FM is a damn great game, too bad Konami tried to kill it.

2236
01:58:35,680 --> 01:58:38,880
And Dark Tetsuya saying, I thought this was a great idea.

2237
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:44,920
So some people are really liking that idea, I'd like to play this someday, we'll see.

2238
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:52,080
Also, this week, a game called Roundabout, which is available on Xbox One, Steam, and

2239
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:57,640
the Humble Store, the ESRB changed Roundabout's rating.

2240
01:58:57,640 --> 01:59:03,400
Roundabout is no longer T for teen, it is now M for mature, and this is due to the volume

2241
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:06,200
of blood in the game.

2242
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:13,720
Roundabout having more blood than Dark Souls 2, but not as much as Bloodborne, and also

2243
01:59:13,720 --> 01:59:15,520
less bloody than Manhunt 2.

2244
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:19,560
This is all, by the way, these comparisons being made by the developer in a statement

2245
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:22,400
on their website, roundaboutgame.tumblr.com.

2246
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:27,280
I'm sorry, can you scroll back up, I need to see their banner or whatever.

2247
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:30,840
I don't know if this is like cosplays, but it's a Tumblr page, I don't know.

2248
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:32,160
No, it's actually in the game.

2249
01:59:32,160 --> 01:59:33,160
Is it?

2250
01:59:33,160 --> 01:59:34,160
I haven't played this game.

2251
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:40,040
The whole premise of the game is that you're driving the world's first revolving limo.

2252
01:59:40,040 --> 01:59:43,360
So the limo spins, and it runs over things.

2253
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:48,720
But it's kind of like a, like almost a public game, but the whole thing has full motion

2254
01:59:48,720 --> 01:59:53,880
video cinematics in it that are really cheesy, like from the 70s and stuff like that.

2255
01:59:53,880 --> 01:59:55,880
I need to see this, I'm gonna check this one out.

2256
01:59:55,880 --> 01:59:57,680
Now you have really piqued my interest.

2257
01:59:57,680 --> 01:59:58,680
I know, right?

2258
01:59:58,680 --> 02:00:03,320
When I hear this news about a game, like it was too violent, I'm like, ooh, maybe I should

2259
02:00:03,320 --> 02:00:04,320
be playing it.

2260
02:00:04,320 --> 02:00:05,320
I don't know.

2261
02:00:05,320 --> 02:00:06,320
Yeah, like, okay, here's the premise right here.

2262
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:11,280
Okay, so it's, it's, you know, roundabout is a 70s B-movie game where you drive a constantly

2263
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:16,040
revolving limousine, pick up passengers, find secret collectibles, take on dangerous missions,

2264
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:19,960
fall in love in an open world puzzle adventure.

2265
02:00:19,960 --> 02:00:21,960
Sounds right up my alley.

2266
02:00:21,960 --> 02:00:23,640
That sounds like it's calling my name.

2267
02:00:23,640 --> 02:00:24,640
Yeah.

2268
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:28,200
It's the company that made that game Gun Stringer.

2269
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:29,200
Remember that one?

2270
02:00:29,200 --> 02:00:30,200
The one that was a Kinect game?

2271
02:00:30,200 --> 02:00:31,200
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2272
02:00:31,200 --> 02:00:37,040
Well, as if violence wasn't enough, the game was also slapped with a use of drugs descriptor

2273
02:00:37,040 --> 02:00:41,320
because there are apparently some jokes in the game where one of the characters eats

2274
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:46,920
candy dots in order to make a skeleton appear and the candy dot supplier turns out that

2275
02:00:46,920 --> 02:00:48,400
he's not a narc.

2276
02:00:48,400 --> 02:00:52,260
And then there's another scene later on where one character describes another as really

2277
02:00:52,260 --> 02:00:53,600
strung out.

2278
02:00:54,160 --> 02:00:59,600
This sounds very incongruous with the rest of the description of the video game, so what

2279
02:00:59,600 --> 02:01:00,600
the hell, guys?

2280
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:03,800
So not only is there blood, there's a little bit of drugs, too.

2281
02:01:03,800 --> 02:01:04,800
Little bit of drugs.

2282
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:05,800
Just a little bit.

2283
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:06,800
Yeah, just a smattering.

2284
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:07,800
Just enough to get a warning label.

2285
02:01:07,800 --> 02:01:08,800
Not safe for kids.

2286
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:09,800
Right.

2287
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:10,800
Right.

2288
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:11,800
Because the blood wasn't a big-

2289
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:14,160
They have a dedicated esports speedrun mode.

2290
02:01:14,160 --> 02:01:18,960
They claim it's roundabout as the only official esport endorsed by a talking skeleton.

2291
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:19,960
Wow.

2292
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:22,000
That's a distinction right there.

2293
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:25,320
So we're going to get to the Fugu question of the week here, but I believe you gals are

2294
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:26,320
on your way out.

2295
02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:27,320
We've got to head out.

2296
02:01:27,320 --> 02:01:31,600
I know you've got to get your tickets now for when the Marvel show returns to town.

2297
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:32,600
Right.

2298
02:01:32,600 --> 02:01:33,600
Definitely.

2299
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:35,720
Now would you go see DC Universe live?

2300
02:01:35,720 --> 02:01:36,720
No.

2301
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:40,000
And I can say that because I'm a big DC fan.

2302
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,560
They just mess it up.

2303
02:01:41,560 --> 02:01:42,560
They just mess it up.

2304
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:43,760
They just fuck everything up basically.

2305
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:45,280
I'd go for free.

2306
02:01:45,280 --> 02:01:46,280
You'd go for free.

2307
02:01:46,280 --> 02:01:47,920
I wouldn't even go for free.

2308
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:49,560
Maybe if you won the tickets on the radio.

2309
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:50,560
Right.

2310
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:51,560
Not me.

2311
02:01:52,120 --> 02:01:54,680
I certainly wouldn't sit as close as I did.

2312
02:01:54,680 --> 02:01:57,240
What if there was violence and the use of drugs?

2313
02:01:57,240 --> 02:01:58,240
Well then yes.

2314
02:01:58,240 --> 02:01:59,240
Absolutely.

2315
02:01:59,240 --> 02:02:00,240
Wouldn't there be?

2316
02:02:00,240 --> 02:02:01,240
Maybe.

2317
02:02:01,240 --> 02:02:02,240
No.

2318
02:02:02,240 --> 02:02:03,240
All right.

2319
02:02:03,240 --> 02:02:07,440
I always ask our guests at the end of every episode your final thought for the night.

2320
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:09,240
So I will extend the same courtesy to you ladies.

2321
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:13,400
Thank you for being here tonight even if you decided to hate on my classic game.

2322
02:02:13,400 --> 02:02:15,200
Mystique, your final thought for the night?

2323
02:02:15,200 --> 02:02:18,920
I am waiting for Batman Arkham Knight.

2324
02:02:18,920 --> 02:02:21,040
I think we all are.

2325
02:02:21,040 --> 02:02:25,360
I won it really bad and they just said it went to M rating and I'm like awesome.

2326
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:27,480
It was always going to be M rating.

2327
02:02:27,480 --> 02:02:28,480
Oh.

2328
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:29,480
Awesome.

2329
02:02:29,480 --> 02:02:30,480
Yeah I knew that.

2330
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:31,480
Awesome.

2331
02:02:31,480 --> 02:02:35,040
And you know maybe it's because of violence and the use of drugs maybe.

2332
02:02:35,040 --> 02:02:36,040
I hope so.

2333
02:02:36,040 --> 02:02:37,040
I really do.

2334
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:38,040
Yes.

2335
02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:40,160
I want to be the goddamn Batman.

2336
02:02:40,160 --> 02:02:41,160
Don't we all.

2337
02:02:41,160 --> 02:02:42,160
Don't we all.

2338
02:02:42,160 --> 02:02:43,160
Irene.

2339
02:02:43,160 --> 02:02:44,160
Princess Irene.

2340
02:02:44,160 --> 02:02:45,160
Your final thought tonight?

2341
02:02:45,160 --> 02:02:48,200
I am rated M for violence and use of drugs.

2342
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:49,200
There you go.

2343
02:02:49,200 --> 02:02:50,200
There you go.

2344
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:51,360
Alright.

2345
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:54,280
Alright well have a safe journey home you guys while we hold down the fort here and

2346
02:02:54,280 --> 02:02:55,280
finish the show.

2347
02:02:55,280 --> 02:02:56,280
Thanks.

2348
02:02:56,280 --> 02:02:57,280
Good luck with Multitap Podcast.

2349
02:02:57,280 --> 02:02:58,280
Thank you.

2350
02:02:58,280 --> 02:02:59,280
Thank you.

2351
02:02:59,280 --> 02:03:00,280
And I'll see you guys soon.

2352
02:03:00,280 --> 02:03:01,280
Yes.

2353
02:03:01,280 --> 02:03:02,280
Alright.

2354
02:03:02,280 --> 02:03:03,280
Hopefully that event I was talking about before that we're going to be broadcasting

2355
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:04,280
live at you guys will stop by.

2356
02:03:04,280 --> 02:03:05,280
I'll be there.

2357
02:03:05,280 --> 02:03:06,280
Remind me.

2358
02:03:06,280 --> 02:03:07,280
Alright.

2359
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:08,280
Sounds good.

2360
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:09,280
Okay.

2361
02:03:09,280 --> 02:03:10,280
Bye.

2362
02:03:10,280 --> 02:03:11,280
Okie dokie.

2363
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:12,280
Bye.

2364
02:03:12,280 --> 02:03:13,280
Some of our folks in the chat room agreeing with Mystique's assessment about DC.

2365
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:17,200
Brad from Pod Culture saying DC has fucked things up for the past few years now.

2366
02:03:18,200 --> 02:03:20,200
And Dungeon Buster saying I can't wait for Arkham Knight either.

2367
02:03:20,200 --> 02:03:24,200
But I'm sure Ben Affleck will do a fine job playing Batman.

2368
02:03:24,200 --> 02:03:26,200
I don't know.

2369
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:27,700
I don't know what to think about all that.

2370
02:03:27,700 --> 02:03:30,200
Maybe Matt Damon could be the Joker in that universe.

2371
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:33,200
No now they have, what's his name, Jared Leto is playing the Joker.

2372
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:35,200
Okay Matt Damon could play someone else.

2373
02:03:35,200 --> 02:03:37,200
Maybe Man Bat.

2374
02:03:37,200 --> 02:03:38,200
Robin.

2375
02:03:38,200 --> 02:03:39,200
He would be Robin of course.

2376
02:03:39,200 --> 02:03:41,200
Oh my god that would be perfect.

2377
02:03:41,200 --> 02:03:42,200
There would be that gay subtext.

2378
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:43,200
That would be perfect.

2379
02:03:43,200 --> 02:03:44,200
That there was a 60's show.

2380
02:03:44,200 --> 02:03:45,200
That would be hilarious.

2381
02:03:45,200 --> 02:03:47,200
Oh they need to do that.

2382
02:03:47,200 --> 02:03:48,200
Alright.

2383
02:03:48,200 --> 02:03:59,200
We're going to move on to the foogle question of the week.

2384
02:03:59,200 --> 02:04:02,760
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities and we read some

2385
02:04:02,760 --> 02:04:05,360
of our favorite answers here on the show.

2386
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:08,480
And this week we wanted to ask our communities, you know, something that happened the week

2387
02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:11,960
we were out was that the Playstation 2 celebrated a birthday.

2388
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:15,520
It is now 15 years old if you can believe it.

2389
02:04:15,520 --> 02:04:20,440
So we asked our listeners how important was the Playstation to you as a gamer or did you

2390
02:04:20,440 --> 02:04:22,180
skip the console?

2391
02:04:22,180 --> 02:04:26,480
What was the most memorable Playstation 2 game in your opinion?

2392
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:29,400
So we're going to get to some of those answers here.

2393
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:32,880
Let's start over on Google Plus because Facebook is irritating me right now.

2394
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:38,160
So act deaf starting us off on Google Plus saying the PS2 is probably next to the Super

2395
02:04:38,160 --> 02:04:39,160
Nintendo.

2396
02:04:39,160 --> 02:04:40,160
It's one of the best consoles of all time.

2397
02:04:40,160 --> 02:04:43,040
It was a really great system and had a huge library of games.

2398
02:04:43,040 --> 02:04:44,280
Really good ones too.

2399
02:04:44,280 --> 02:04:48,120
A lot of new series started on the system and old ones were brought back to life too.

2400
02:04:48,120 --> 02:04:50,400
Which also makes it hard to just pick one game out of the bunch.

2401
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:54,900
But if I have to pick just one, the most memorable of them all would be Katamari Damacy.

2402
02:04:54,900 --> 02:05:00,120
The simplest of games, the weirdest of games, one of the most unique experiences out there.

2403
02:05:00,120 --> 02:05:04,680
Our pal Critical Myth from the Critical Myth show, Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays, 4 o'clock

2404
02:05:04,680 --> 02:05:10,540
Pacific 7 Eastern here on VOG, says the Playstation 2 was my first console after the 2600.

2405
02:05:10,540 --> 02:05:15,280
Not kidding, before that I played in the arcade, Commodore 64, PC games during high school

2406
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:16,280
or college.

2407
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:21,080
It wasn't until late in the PS2 era that we got one, the Slim Bundle, and have been console

2408
02:05:21,080 --> 02:05:22,840
gamers since.

2409
02:05:22,840 --> 02:05:27,360
As for the most memorable game, hard to pin down but I'll go with Final Fantasy XII because

2410
02:05:27,360 --> 02:05:32,920
it was the last game for the console that I dropped over 100 hours into.

2411
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:36,560
Retertainment says for me the Playstation 2 was the video game console I bought with

2412
02:05:36,560 --> 02:05:39,480
money that I earned from my first job as an adult.

2413
02:05:39,480 --> 02:05:43,960
I'm not sure, or I'm sure I'm not alone in saying that the Playstation 2 not only served

2414
02:05:43,960 --> 02:05:49,260
as a video game but also as my first DVD player and for a long time my only DVD player.

2415
02:05:49,260 --> 02:05:54,120
As far as the most memorable game, Grand Theft Auto Vice City.

2416
02:05:54,120 --> 02:05:58,600
And Josh Wye replied and said PS2 compared to its predecessor didn't have a wide range

2417
02:05:58,600 --> 02:05:59,600
of game types.

2418
02:05:59,600 --> 02:06:02,560
A lot of the games got quite derivative and tired after a while.

2419
02:06:02,600 --> 02:06:08,080
My most memorable PS2 game was probably EverQuest Online Adventures.

2420
02:06:08,080 --> 02:06:12,240
Nothing beated the feeling of seeing the sunrise over Freeport for the first time after making

2421
02:06:12,240 --> 02:06:15,200
the perilous journey from the west of Tunaria.

2422
02:06:15,200 --> 02:06:17,520
So a lot of answers there over on Google Plus.

2423
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:22,520
Let's check out our Facebook answers, except again this page not cooperating with me here

2424
02:06:22,520 --> 02:06:24,080
on Facebook.

2425
02:06:24,080 --> 02:06:27,340
Facebook does not want me to read your answers, okay here we go finally got all your comments

2426
02:06:27,340 --> 02:06:29,040
to load.

2427
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:32,520
Bread the Hayes says the Playstation 2 was important to me at the time when I first got

2428
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:33,520
it.

2429
02:06:33,520 --> 02:06:36,080
I think I was trying to get over a break up at the time and playing Castlevania Lament

2430
02:06:36,080 --> 02:06:39,200
of Innocence for dozens of hours was helpful.

2431
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:42,560
Fabrice A says never bought any Playstation because I was into Sega.

2432
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:48,280
To this day I still refuse to buy any Playstation because of their advertisement campaign against

2433
02:06:48,280 --> 02:06:49,720
Dreamcast.

2434
02:06:49,720 --> 02:06:53,720
Still it would be stupid to deny that Playstation 2 didn't have amazing games and Sony having

2435
02:06:53,720 --> 02:06:55,720
a huge influence on the gaming world.

2436
02:06:55,720 --> 02:07:00,720
You know something else to consider Fabrice, Sega puts out games on Playstation now occasionally

2437
02:07:00,720 --> 02:07:04,520
so I think those rifts from back in the day have passed a little bit.

2438
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:08,260
It might be time to let it go.

2439
02:07:08,260 --> 02:07:09,960
The snow never bothered you anyway.

2440
02:07:09,960 --> 02:07:14,540
Elliot B says I was a die hard GameCube supporter at the start of the generation but eventually

2441
02:07:14,540 --> 02:07:18,080
gave in and bought a PS2 and I'm glad since otherwise I wouldn't have been able to play

2442
02:07:18,080 --> 02:07:20,920
its wonderful selection of rhythm action games.

2443
02:07:20,920 --> 02:07:24,560
Fifth Dream says I never had much money so I didn't get a PS2 until late in the cycle

2444
02:07:24,560 --> 02:07:26,760
when a friend sold his to me really cheap.

2445
02:07:26,760 --> 02:07:30,720
I immediately played the Final Fantasy games from 7 to 10 too all in a row.

2446
02:07:30,720 --> 02:07:34,320
This was huge for me because I loved Final Fantasy and had missed out on the Playstation

2447
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:35,640
1's to that point.

2448
02:07:35,640 --> 02:07:40,440
I also loved Katamari Damacy and the .hack and GU trilogy on the system.

2449
02:07:40,440 --> 02:07:41,440
That's a good point.

2450
02:07:41,440 --> 02:07:44,360
Remember how the Playstation 2 would play Playstation 1 games?

2451
02:07:44,360 --> 02:07:46,560
It was just totally backwards compatible.

2452
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:50,440
Remember when our systems were totally backwards compatible?

2453
02:07:50,440 --> 02:07:52,320
Now only Nintendo does that.

2454
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:53,320
Sorta.

2455
02:07:53,320 --> 02:07:56,400
Still the old old games but at least hey the Wii games work on the Wii U.

2456
02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:58,760
We don't have that anywhere else.

2457
02:07:58,760 --> 02:07:59,880
Anyway let's see.

2458
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:04,400
Tiger Caw says I still have an original launch PS2 which still works 100%.

2459
02:08:04,400 --> 02:08:07,580
The Bouncer was a pretty memorable game because it was one of the launch titles.

2460
02:08:07,580 --> 02:08:09,800
It was a game that pushed the PS2's hardware with the graphics.

2461
02:08:09,800 --> 02:08:12,200
It was a fighting game but also cinematics.

2462
02:08:12,200 --> 02:08:14,360
Enter the Matrix was another game I enjoyed playing.

2463
02:08:14,360 --> 02:08:16,640
It was the game that was official canon to the Matrix movies.

2464
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:20,240
I remember when that came out, Loki and I lived together and you were huge into that

2465
02:08:20,240 --> 02:08:21,240
game.

2466
02:08:21,240 --> 02:08:22,240
I had it in GameCube.

2467
02:08:22,240 --> 02:08:23,240
Yeah.

2468
02:08:23,240 --> 02:08:25,360
And it was on all the platforms really.

2469
02:08:25,360 --> 02:08:26,360
Yeah.

2470
02:08:26,360 --> 02:08:27,360
Let's see.

2471
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:32,400
Let's not forget that the PS2 was the first console to bring online multiplayer online

2472
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:34,360
via an add-on ethernet adapter.

2473
02:08:34,360 --> 02:08:38,520
You have to own the PS2 a lot for bringing online multiplayer to consoles for the first

2474
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:39,520
time.

2475
02:08:39,520 --> 02:08:45,480
I usually think Xbox got a little more credit with that just because of Xbox Live.

2476
02:08:45,480 --> 02:08:49,080
But to be fair, didn't the Dreamcast have Phantasy Star Online?

2477
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:51,340
And I think we might have had a little bit of it.

2478
02:08:51,340 --> 02:08:56,600
But not to discredit Tiger Cost Point because definitely the PS2 started moving that forward

2479
02:08:56,600 --> 02:09:03,980
and you had a lot more of it than you really did in other places at the time on the PS2.

2480
02:09:03,980 --> 02:09:07,020
Andy R. says, it was pretty big for me.

2481
02:09:07,020 --> 02:09:09,260
PlayStation 1 was the first home console I owned.

2482
02:09:09,260 --> 02:09:13,020
By PlayStation 2, I was middle or high school so it was the first system I spent my own

2483
02:09:13,020 --> 02:09:14,660
money on to get games.

2484
02:09:14,660 --> 02:09:17,260
Favorite PlayStation 2 game is probably Valkyrie Profile 2.

2485
02:09:17,820 --> 02:09:22,620
SSJ100Matt says the PS2 was my entry point into the PlayStation since I skipped the PS1

2486
02:09:22,620 --> 02:09:24,220
in favor of the N64.

2487
02:09:24,220 --> 02:09:28,140
I was blown away with the games and the ability to play PS1 games that I couldn't play up

2488
02:09:28,140 --> 02:09:29,140
till then.

2489
02:09:29,140 --> 02:09:31,820
My most memorable games were SSX3 and Final Fantasy X.

2490
02:09:31,820 --> 02:09:37,060
I logged for probably over 100 hours in both games and I still play SSX3 on occasion.

2491
02:09:37,060 --> 02:09:40,900
Burr replied and said I hated PS2 because I was a Dreamcast fanboy.

2492
02:09:40,900 --> 02:09:43,980
I think it's a shame so many overlooked the Dreamcast because they were busy waiting on

2493
02:09:43,980 --> 02:09:45,440
Sony's false hype.

2494
02:09:45,440 --> 02:09:47,800
That infamous Final Fantasy VII demo took the cake.

2495
02:09:47,800 --> 02:09:50,800
I'm over it now but it was difficult to stomach at the time.

2496
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:53,640
Degenerate Johnny says, all hail Kingdom Hearts.

2497
02:09:53,640 --> 02:09:57,480
Regretted skipping PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2 surpassed all.

2498
02:09:57,480 --> 02:10:01,480
Mike C. replied and said I bought the PlayStation 2 because it came with a built-in DVD player.

2499
02:10:01,480 --> 02:10:04,640
I think a lot of people did that.

2500
02:10:04,640 --> 02:10:09,340
One of our people on Google Plus kind of made that point that a lot of people were buying

2501
02:10:09,340 --> 02:10:13,680
the PlayStation 2 because it was a DVD player and that really is probably what passed it

2502
02:10:13,680 --> 02:10:16,440
despite all the negativity with Sega and so forth.

2503
02:10:16,440 --> 02:10:22,120
That is what really pushed the PlayStation 2 ahead of the competition.

2504
02:10:22,120 --> 02:10:25,960
Mike C. continued on saying the one game for PlayStation 2 that blew my mind was Grand

2505
02:10:25,960 --> 02:10:26,960
Theft Auto 3.

2506
02:10:26,960 --> 02:10:29,320
It was the first open world game that I ever played.

2507
02:10:29,320 --> 02:10:33,120
I could go wherever I want, kill whoever I want, steal any car I want.

2508
02:10:33,120 --> 02:10:34,840
It was dope.

2509
02:10:34,840 --> 02:10:39,240
Cial replied and said I didn't get a PS2 until the system's price dropped below 50 bucks.

2510
02:10:39,240 --> 02:10:41,240
So it was a partial pass on the system.

2511
02:10:41,240 --> 02:10:42,480
Just a few more here.

2512
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:44,080
I love this diversity of answers.

2513
02:10:44,080 --> 02:10:46,200
That's why I'm reading so many here.

2514
02:10:46,200 --> 02:10:48,800
Hitstun says the PlayStation 2 got me into online gaming.

2515
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:53,000
I spent hundreds of hours in Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 making new levels in the Create-A-Park

2516
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,560
tool and playing them online with my new friends.

2517
02:10:55,560 --> 02:10:59,560
And Misty says I got a PlayStation 2 about the same time DDR's American Home releases

2518
02:10:59,560 --> 02:11:02,800
came out and that's what convinced me to get the system at all.

2519
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:06,360
While the .hack series of games did a much better job than average of grabbing and holding

2520
02:11:06,360 --> 02:11:10,800
my attention, if not for DDR, I likely would have never purchased the system at all.

2521
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:14,600
I never had the original system and haven't had a PlayStation console since.

2522
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:18,480
Most memorable game, the .hack series, because I'm still of the opinion that DDR isn't quite

2523
02:11:18,480 --> 02:11:22,120
as pure when it isn't played on an arcade machine.

2524
02:11:22,120 --> 02:11:26,140
And last but not least, Dark Tetsuya says while I don't still have the first PS2 I ever

2525
02:11:26,140 --> 02:11:29,440
had originally, my current one is still working like a charm.

2526
02:11:29,440 --> 02:11:33,120
I do still fire up mine on occasion for a round of BeatMania 2DX.

2527
02:11:33,120 --> 02:11:38,040
Sickstyle is probably my all-time favorite, so my system gets some use still 15 years

2528
02:11:38,040 --> 02:11:39,040
later.

2529
02:11:39,160 --> 02:11:42,960
There, whew, that was a lot of answers, but so diverse I had to read them all.

2530
02:11:42,960 --> 02:11:45,760
Quickly, PlayStation 2 memories, Loki?

2531
02:11:45,760 --> 02:11:51,280
Um, I guess, granted, if I was San Andreas, I can't, no, there's a lot of really good

2532
02:11:51,280 --> 02:11:57,220
games that I played on PS2, I mean, the first game I had was Armored Core, so, it was like

2533
02:11:57,220 --> 02:12:03,400
Armored Core 4, I think, I don't remember which one it was that they launched it with.

2534
02:12:03,400 --> 02:12:07,520
I don't know, I mean, I think that was it.

2535
02:12:07,520 --> 02:12:18,560
It was Driver, no, Driver 3 was on PlayStation 2, yes it was, and Katamari, of course.

2536
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:22,680
I think some quick ones I would name, since it's the Final Fantasy game no one else named,

2537
02:12:22,680 --> 02:12:27,480
Final Fantasy XI, for sucking me into MMOs, I mean, granted, yeah, but, you know, it was

2538
02:12:27,480 --> 02:12:31,320
really cool to see it on the PlayStation as well, and you know, it was kind of a trip,

2539
02:12:31,320 --> 02:12:35,080
seeing that interconnectivity there, and you know, I'm just such an MMO fan, I have to

2540
02:12:35,080 --> 02:12:36,300
give that a shoutout.

2541
02:12:36,300 --> 02:12:40,820
But otherwise, I would also say, you know, I bought a Japanese PlayStation 2 just so

2542
02:12:40,820 --> 02:12:45,540
I could play Beat Mania 2DX, so I'm kind of with Dark Tetsuya on that one.

2543
02:12:45,540 --> 02:12:52,660
I would also say, though, for serious reasons, Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy X, both phenomenal

2544
02:12:52,660 --> 02:12:56,460
games, and for lolsy inside joke reasons, Magic Pen Gel.

2545
02:12:56,460 --> 02:12:58,660
I love Magic Pen Gel.

2546
02:12:58,660 --> 02:12:59,660
Right?

2547
02:12:59,660 --> 02:13:00,660
Right?

2548
02:13:00,660 --> 02:13:01,660
That's a game they should bring back.

2549
02:13:01,660 --> 02:13:02,660
Right?

2550
02:13:02,660 --> 02:13:04,460
Alright, let's get to some more news.

2551
02:13:04,460 --> 02:13:07,780
We'll try to run through this so we have some time to get to your calls as well.

2552
02:13:07,780 --> 02:13:08,780
Loki.

2553
02:13:08,780 --> 02:13:13,780
Okay, this is really disappointing, but apparently Sony is now getting rid of PlayStation Mobile

2554
02:13:13,780 --> 02:13:14,780
altogether.

2555
02:13:14,780 --> 02:13:19,180
Now, originally it was that they were dropping support on Android for it, which I could live

2556
02:13:19,180 --> 02:13:27,420
with, you know, but now they're actually going to be ending the program on, not only Android,

2557
02:13:27,420 --> 02:13:28,700
but on the Vita.

2558
02:13:28,700 --> 02:13:31,380
And here's the best part about it.

2559
02:13:31,380 --> 02:13:36,700
Apparently the content distribution will stop on July 15th, 2015.

2560
02:13:36,700 --> 02:13:42,260
After September 10th, you will not be able to re-download your purchases.

2561
02:13:42,260 --> 02:13:45,040
So that kind of sucks.

2562
02:13:45,040 --> 02:13:49,180
You apparently need to manually authenticate your device for the Vita.

2563
02:13:49,180 --> 02:13:55,240
You can do that under, I guess, your PlayStation Network System Activation settings.

2564
02:13:55,240 --> 02:14:00,260
And then on PlayStation Mobile, it says you apparently need to open up the app and launch

2565
02:14:00,260 --> 02:14:07,260
any purchases after April 10th and before September 10th so that you can still access

2566
02:14:07,260 --> 02:14:08,780
them after that time.

2567
02:14:08,780 --> 02:14:13,640
Here's the thing that's really annoying about that as well is that's one of the things Unity

2568
02:14:13,640 --> 02:14:18,540
had where you can output to PlayStation Mobile and like right now, if I wanted to publish

2569
02:14:18,540 --> 02:14:22,420
a game or even publish the game that I'm working on, I could do that and, you know, I just

2570
02:14:22,420 --> 02:14:27,620
have to sign up on their website if I could push to PlayStation Mobile.

2571
02:14:27,620 --> 02:14:29,500
But now I won't be able to do that.

2572
02:14:29,500 --> 02:14:31,540
So that kind of sucks.

2573
02:14:31,540 --> 02:14:32,540
Yeah.

2574
02:14:32,540 --> 02:14:36,960
And one of the dangers of digital distribution is that, you know, even though a lot of companies

2575
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:40,760
have talked about their exit strategy, such as Steam, you know, says if they ever had

2576
02:14:40,760 --> 02:14:44,900
to close down, they have a button they can push that would unlock the DRM on every game

2577
02:14:44,900 --> 02:14:46,060
you've bought.

2578
02:14:46,060 --> 02:14:48,820
But I mean, would you be able to re-download games again?

2579
02:14:48,820 --> 02:14:49,820
No.

2580
02:14:49,820 --> 02:14:50,820
And according to this, they're saying no.

2581
02:14:50,820 --> 02:14:51,820
Yeah.

2582
02:14:51,820 --> 02:14:52,820
Unless you can't.

2583
02:14:52,820 --> 02:14:57,340
So that's kind of messed up that they're saying, sorry, you can't do that.

2584
02:14:57,340 --> 02:15:00,820
I don't understand why they can't do that.

2585
02:15:00,820 --> 02:15:02,140
I don't understand why they're getting rid of it.

2586
02:15:02,140 --> 02:15:04,780
Cost too much money for the servers, I guess, to justify the cost.

2587
02:15:04,780 --> 02:15:05,780
I don't know.

2588
02:15:05,780 --> 02:15:06,780
I mean, that's not much content on there.

2589
02:15:06,780 --> 02:15:08,020
I mean, I can't imagine that.

2590
02:15:08,020 --> 02:15:09,220
I'm just kind of disappointed.

2591
02:15:09,220 --> 02:15:14,080
The fact that it's not easy now to push to PlayStation that way is if they make it easy

2592
02:15:14,080 --> 02:15:18,180
enough to push content to PlayStation, because this was something that you didn't have to

2593
02:15:18,180 --> 02:15:23,660
like go through PlayStation and work out a deal with them to get it on their service.

2594
02:15:23,660 --> 02:15:29,740
It was tucked away in a corner, but ideally I was thinking about this for releasing something

2595
02:15:29,740 --> 02:15:37,020
on PlayStation TV, where it's a title that runs on the Vita, but it's on the console

2596
02:15:37,020 --> 02:15:38,020
now.

2597
02:15:38,020 --> 02:15:39,580
That's an easiest way to get to a console.

2598
02:15:39,580 --> 02:15:44,580
But now we have to go about all these roundabout ways to get to publish on there.

2599
02:15:44,580 --> 02:15:48,260
So I just hope that they open up something similar.

2600
02:15:48,260 --> 02:15:52,240
I know that they're going to have that whole ID at Xbox thing, and eventually those systems

2601
02:15:52,240 --> 02:15:54,360
are going to act as dev units.

2602
02:15:54,360 --> 02:16:00,360
I hope they do something similar for PlayStation, because that kind of sucks.

2603
02:16:00,360 --> 02:16:04,600
Bonds006 in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com says, it was doomed to fail.

2604
02:16:04,600 --> 02:16:08,680
They could not fight with Google Play and iOS Market.

2605
02:16:08,680 --> 02:16:12,400
Okay, I'll give them that.

2606
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:18,580
And they did drop the support on Android, but why not just leave it there for Vita?

2607
02:16:18,580 --> 02:16:19,580
Or why not?

2608
02:16:19,580 --> 02:16:20,740
There's a crazy idea.

2609
02:16:20,740 --> 02:16:27,500
Why not leave it open for Vita and open it up for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4?

2610
02:16:27,500 --> 02:16:31,140
I mean, I don't understand why they couldn't do that.

2611
02:16:31,140 --> 02:16:39,100
Well, this news is going to disappoint some, but I think others will understand why there

2612
02:16:39,100 --> 02:16:40,460
was big news this week.

2613
02:16:40,460 --> 02:16:48,420
Uncharted 4, A Thief's End, pushed back to Spring 2016, revealed on the PlayStation blog.

2614
02:16:48,420 --> 02:16:52,780
Since we showed you our first gameplay reveal of Uncharted 4, A Thief's End, more of the

2615
02:16:52,780 --> 02:16:55,600
game and story have come together, and it's become clear to us that this game is much

2616
02:16:55,600 --> 02:16:58,460
more ambitious than we originally envisioned.

2617
02:16:58,460 --> 02:17:01,820
After spending so many years with Nathan Drake, he means a lot to the team, and telling the

2618
02:17:01,820 --> 02:17:05,240
climatic chapter of his adventures is a task we don't take lightly.

2619
02:17:05,240 --> 02:17:09,180
This game deserves every bit of the attention to detail, precise pacing, and nuanced storytelling

2620
02:17:09,180 --> 02:17:10,720
Naughty Dog is known for.

2621
02:17:10,720 --> 02:17:13,800
So we've made the difficult choice of pushing the game's release date.

2622
02:17:13,800 --> 02:17:18,600
All that statement on the PlayStation blog from director Neil Druckmann, which, as you

2623
02:17:18,600 --> 02:17:24,960
can imagine, the people that love to see Sony fail were coming out in droves saying, hahaha,

2624
02:17:24,960 --> 02:17:28,920
whereas I think there's other people of the mindset that are like, you know, well, if

2625
02:17:28,920 --> 02:17:33,420
it takes the system, or I mean, if it takes the game a little longer so that it's not

2626
02:17:33,420 --> 02:17:36,380
all buggy and screwed up, then, you know, so be it.

2627
02:17:36,380 --> 02:17:42,240
But I think that does leave quite a few people wondering, what's Sony going to do this holiday?

2628
02:17:42,280 --> 02:17:44,920
This was supposed to be the tent pole for their holiday.

2629
02:17:44,920 --> 02:17:45,920
So now what?

2630
02:17:45,920 --> 02:17:46,920
Now what?

2631
02:17:46,920 --> 02:17:47,920
What they got?

2632
02:17:47,920 --> 02:17:53,920
Did something have to get put on a fast track to make the holiday to make up for this one

2633
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:55,360
getting pushed back?

2634
02:17:55,360 --> 02:17:57,800
Are they going to try to rely on third parties?

2635
02:17:57,800 --> 02:17:58,800
Who knows?

2636
02:17:58,800 --> 02:17:59,800
I don't think they would.

2637
02:17:59,800 --> 02:18:00,800
I think they've got to have something.

2638
02:18:00,800 --> 02:18:02,040
I've got to have something.

2639
02:18:02,040 --> 02:18:08,280
But I mean, to be fair, Sony had, I don't want to say Sony had a weak Christmas last

2640
02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:11,860
year because it's not like they didn't say it was a week PS4s, but they did get out sold

2641
02:18:11,860 --> 02:18:15,340
by Xbox one over the first party releases is pretty weak.

2642
02:18:15,340 --> 02:18:16,340
Yeah.

2643
02:18:16,340 --> 02:18:20,620
So it wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't as strong as Nintendo's to be honest.

2644
02:18:20,620 --> 02:18:23,840
So well, Nintendo, all they have is first party.

2645
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:29,120
So I mean, that's, well, it has to be strong, but Loki, you have to admit what, what Nintendo

2646
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:33,580
put out over the three months was probably stronger than what, you know, Sony had coming

2647
02:18:33,580 --> 02:18:36,160
out for their system over the three months, all day period.

2648
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:39,600
I love my PlayStation four and there's a lot of great games for, yeah, it was broken drive

2649
02:18:39,600 --> 02:18:41,760
club and a little big planet three.

2650
02:18:41,760 --> 02:18:44,440
I mean, it's not hard to compete against that.

2651
02:18:44,440 --> 02:18:47,080
So what do you think happens now, Loki?

2652
02:18:47,080 --> 02:18:50,520
I think we wait until E3 and find out what game they have coming out and there's still

2653
02:18:50,520 --> 02:18:51,520
plenty of things.

2654
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:53,320
And I think it probably is no man's sky.

2655
02:18:53,320 --> 02:18:55,880
Oh, you think they're investing everything in that?

2656
02:18:55,880 --> 02:19:00,440
I would say, and I think the game that probably could be fast tracked, I would think God of

2657
02:19:00,440 --> 02:19:05,800
War is going to be the game that they're going to push to this holiday and make it happen.

2658
02:19:05,800 --> 02:19:07,200
That's just my gut.

2659
02:19:07,200 --> 02:19:09,120
I have nothing to base that off of.

2660
02:19:09,120 --> 02:19:12,720
I just would think that that would be the game that maybe they were looking at for next

2661
02:19:12,720 --> 02:19:14,760
year that maybe they could bump up to this year.

2662
02:19:14,760 --> 02:19:15,760
I don't know.

2663
02:19:15,760 --> 02:19:16,760
We'll see.

2664
02:19:16,760 --> 02:19:17,760
We'll see.

2665
02:19:17,760 --> 02:19:18,760
Nothing's that easy.

2666
02:19:18,760 --> 02:19:19,820
It's just, you know, Oh, let's dial up the graphics.

2667
02:19:19,820 --> 02:19:24,280
Maybe it's a sequel to the order 18, 80, whatever, seven.

2668
02:19:24,280 --> 02:19:25,280
Maybe it's a sequel.

2669
02:19:25,280 --> 02:19:26,280
I don't think so.

2670
02:19:26,280 --> 02:19:27,280
I don't think so.

2671
02:19:27,280 --> 02:19:28,280
All right.

2672
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:29,280
Well, yeah, we'll see at E3.

2673
02:19:29,280 --> 02:19:30,280
Knack two.

2674
02:19:30,280 --> 02:19:31,280
What?

2675
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:32,280
Knack two.

2676
02:19:32,280 --> 02:19:33,280
I don't think so.

2677
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:34,280
I think Knack is more likely to be on PlayStation plus.

2678
02:19:34,280 --> 02:19:35,280
It's a free game.

2679
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:36,280
Very soon.

2680
02:19:36,280 --> 02:19:37,280
We'll see.

2681
02:19:37,280 --> 02:19:38,280
Okay.

2682
02:19:38,280 --> 02:19:39,280
Cool.

2683
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:40,280
Um, yeah.

2684
02:19:40,280 --> 02:19:43,800
Uh, you know, but here's the thing, even though I am also here saying, boy, I wonder what

2685
02:19:43,800 --> 02:19:44,800
they're going to have for the holiday.

2686
02:19:44,800 --> 02:19:46,680
Wasn't there supposed to be a new Ratchet and Clank game?

2687
02:19:46,680 --> 02:19:48,840
Like, cause they know there's supposed to be the movie too.

2688
02:19:48,840 --> 02:19:49,840
There could be that.

2689
02:19:49,840 --> 02:19:56,200
Um, but I just want to say, um, if you bought a PlayStation four now in anticipation of

2690
02:19:56,200 --> 02:20:01,720
Uncharted and that was the only thing you were going for, then that's kind of on you.

2691
02:20:01,720 --> 02:20:04,040
Stop buying systems for games that aren't out yet.

2692
02:20:04,040 --> 02:20:09,120
I mean, you can use those games to kind of justify the purchase of the system.

2693
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:14,200
Like, you know, if you already have a few strong games out that you want to buy, but

2694
02:20:14,200 --> 02:20:18,520
you know, I think it's very important for these games to take their time in the incubator

2695
02:20:18,520 --> 02:20:22,160
and come out right because no one likes a rushed project.

2696
02:20:22,160 --> 02:20:24,360
Take Assassin's Creed Unity, for example.

2697
02:20:24,360 --> 02:20:28,320
Uh, John from Critical Myth wrote a review over at vognetwork.com this week that was

2698
02:20:28,320 --> 02:20:32,920
like, kind of like, let's revisit this game, you know, now that we're six months, you know,

2699
02:20:32,920 --> 02:20:36,000
past when it was, maybe not that far, but like four months, five months past when it

2700
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:39,680
was first released and he kind of touches on everything they've changed since then.

2701
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:43,560
And you know, this seems like the game they wanted to release and they never should have

2702
02:20:43,560 --> 02:20:44,880
released it over the holiday period.

2703
02:20:44,880 --> 02:20:48,720
That maybe was a game that should have been pushed back or else it wouldn't have gotten,

2704
02:20:48,720 --> 02:20:49,840
you know, half the crap it did.

2705
02:20:49,840 --> 02:20:52,320
Do you want your Uncharted four turning out like Assassin's Creed?

2706
02:20:52,320 --> 02:20:54,880
No, I don't think anybody does.

2707
02:20:54,880 --> 02:20:58,760
So if they have to take the extra time, then they have to take the extra time.

2708
02:20:58,760 --> 02:21:03,840
Um, SSJ100Matt saying, I thought Street Fighter 5 was their big thing for the holidays, but

2709
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:06,960
I see it's coming out quarter one, 2016.

2710
02:21:06,960 --> 02:21:11,400
Uh, Dungeon Buster saying Witcher 3 was delayed several times.

2711
02:21:11,400 --> 02:21:13,640
I think some people are talking about that in the chat room.

2712
02:21:13,640 --> 02:21:15,480
Uh, so there you go.

2713
02:21:15,480 --> 02:21:18,000
You know, Witcher 3 is multi-platform, so I...

2714
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:19,000
That's true too.

2715
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:20,680
I don't think that really matters.

2716
02:21:20,680 --> 02:21:21,680
Yeah.

2717
02:21:21,680 --> 02:21:23,640
All right, Loki, what do you have for us?

2718
02:21:23,640 --> 02:21:26,040
Um, so this is kind of cool.

2719
02:21:26,040 --> 02:21:32,280
There's a group of modders that are remaking Warcraft 3, I believe in Starcraft 2, because

2720
02:21:32,280 --> 02:21:37,920
they did release the assets for World of Warcraft, not World of Warcraft, for Warcraft 3 to allow

2721
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:40,720
people to make stuff in Starcraft 2 using that.

2722
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:47,160
And so now we have Warcraft, the armies of Azeroth.

2723
02:21:47,160 --> 02:21:48,160
It looks pretty cool.

2724
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:50,920
I'm just not sure when it's coming out.

2725
02:21:50,920 --> 02:21:54,720
Blizzard is surprisingly supportive of these types of projects usually too.

2726
02:21:54,720 --> 02:21:58,680
Yeah, probably because they have no interest in doing it, and if it works out, they can...

2727
02:21:58,680 --> 02:22:03,520
Well, I remember there were rumors around last BlizzCon of a Warcraft 3 HD remake was

2728
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:07,520
like the big buzz that they were going to announce, but it ended up being Overwatch

2729
02:22:07,520 --> 02:22:11,400
instead because there was a whole misdirect with the cancellation of Titan.

2730
02:22:11,400 --> 02:22:16,080
But yeah, it's interesting that a Warcraft 3 newer version of sorts is going to happen

2731
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:17,080
anyway.

2732
02:22:17,080 --> 02:22:18,080
Yeah, it looks pretty cool.

2733
02:22:18,080 --> 02:22:22,480
But I think we saw this coming too when Starcraft 2 put the Warcraft assets in it.

2734
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:26,320
So anyway, let's go to the mailbag.

2735
02:22:26,320 --> 02:22:31,040
Every week you guys send us emails to participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

2736
02:22:31,040 --> 02:22:33,200
If you want to participate, email us.

2737
02:22:33,200 --> 02:22:35,200
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

2738
02:22:35,200 --> 02:22:41,160
Typically, DarkSakura would dive into the mailbag and read the emails for you, but as

2739
02:22:41,160 --> 02:22:43,680
we mentioned before, she's not here this week.

2740
02:22:43,680 --> 02:22:48,480
She'll be back next week, but I will fill in in her steed this week.

2741
02:22:48,480 --> 02:22:51,800
We just have two quick emails for you guys tonight.

2742
02:22:51,800 --> 02:22:55,720
And again, if you want to have DarkSakura read your email next week, you can participate

2743
02:22:55,720 --> 02:22:57,520
at orangelaungeradio.com.

2744
02:22:57,520 --> 02:22:59,720
First email coming to us from EA Skizie.

2745
02:22:59,720 --> 02:23:03,160
I haven't seen this name in a little while, but EA Skizie writes us and says, hey Orange

2746
02:23:03,160 --> 02:23:07,440
Lounge, did I hear you say episode 589?

2747
02:23:07,440 --> 02:23:08,440
That's crazy.

2748
02:23:08,440 --> 02:23:11,360
I just want to email in and say that I think that's amazing.

2749
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:14,360
And I hope you go for 589 more.

2750
02:23:14,360 --> 02:23:17,480
Anybody want to start Starbound for the first time with me?

2751
02:23:17,480 --> 02:23:18,480
LOL.

2752
02:23:18,480 --> 02:23:19,480
Yes.

2753
02:23:19,480 --> 02:23:20,480
508.

2754
02:23:20,480 --> 02:23:22,480
Oh, and that's EA Skizie from Milwaukee.

2755
02:23:22,480 --> 02:23:23,480
Yes.

2756
02:23:23,480 --> 02:23:25,320
589 is a long time.

2757
02:23:25,320 --> 02:23:29,760
We're actually going to be celebrating our 13th birthday in June.

2758
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:32,720
And so for us to go for, you know, now it's 590 tonight.

2759
02:23:32,720 --> 02:23:37,340
For us to go for another 590 episodes, we would have to go for 13 more years.

2760
02:23:37,340 --> 02:23:43,800
I would be 50 years old at that point about, I'm only 36 now, but I'm getting there.

2761
02:23:43,800 --> 02:23:52,720
So you know, obviously we're very fortunate and lucky that we have your guys' support

2762
02:23:52,720 --> 02:23:56,520
as we've had over the years that really motivate us to keep going.

2763
02:23:56,520 --> 02:24:02,760
But you know, DarkSakura, Loki, myself, we've really just made this our Sunday night habit.

2764
02:24:02,760 --> 02:24:06,520
And you know, we are fortunate enough that through all this hard work, we're able to

2765
02:24:06,520 --> 02:24:09,840
say, we're the longest running video game podcast out there.

2766
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:15,920
You know, granted, some may want to take some radio show, the fact that podcasting wasn't

2767
02:24:15,920 --> 02:24:19,720
around for 2005, whatever, whatever technicalities you want to get it on.

2768
02:24:19,720 --> 02:24:25,640
The point is we've been here since 2002, still doing our thing with you guys.

2769
02:24:25,640 --> 02:24:28,360
And I know I don't want to lose that anytime soon.

2770
02:24:28,360 --> 02:24:32,800
And I doubt Loki does and I doubt DarkSakura does, because I have fun doing this on Sunday

2771
02:24:32,800 --> 02:24:37,120
and you guys, you know, despite all the drama, and I talked about some of it earlier tonight,

2772
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:41,440
despite all the drama, that's just, that's just that, you know, it wouldn't matter if

2773
02:24:41,440 --> 02:24:44,640
I never went to a single show ever again or ever did.

2774
02:24:44,640 --> 02:24:48,840
The fact that even one person shows up and listens for this is truly, and I know people

2775
02:24:48,840 --> 02:24:52,080
say this, but it's truly like just reward enough and getting to hang out with Loki and

2776
02:24:52,080 --> 02:24:57,760
Jamie because Lord knows if I'd see them otherwise without busy Loki is and so forth.

2777
02:24:57,760 --> 02:25:00,400
So we're going to be here as long as possible.

2778
02:25:00,400 --> 02:25:06,520
I mean, nothing lasts forever, but it will take, it's going to take something big, like,

2779
02:25:06,520 --> 02:25:10,520
you know, and I think we've talked about this openly on the show a few years ago.

2780
02:25:10,520 --> 02:25:15,880
If I haven't talked about this on the show before, then oops, I guess tonight is the

2781
02:25:15,880 --> 02:25:18,240
night where I'm spilling all the tea, isn't it?

2782
02:25:18,240 --> 02:25:23,120
But we had a scare a couple of years ago that Jamie was going to move to Washington and

2783
02:25:23,120 --> 02:25:24,600
she damn near did.

2784
02:25:24,600 --> 02:25:29,320
And there was kind of talks that about, well, if you move away, I mean, there was the talk,

2785
02:25:29,320 --> 02:25:32,880
oh, we could Skype and so forth, but would it really be the same type of show?

2786
02:25:32,880 --> 02:25:33,880
I don't know.

2787
02:25:33,880 --> 02:25:38,640
We had talked about, well, if this happens, this is maybe that it's maybe time to still

2788
02:25:38,640 --> 02:25:39,640
be able to carry on.

2789
02:25:39,640 --> 02:25:40,640
I don't know.

2790
02:25:40,640 --> 02:25:41,640
I don't know.

2791
02:25:41,640 --> 02:25:42,640
Would it really be the same?

2792
02:25:42,640 --> 02:25:45,560
I really think part of what makes this show special is the fact that we're all in the

2793
02:25:45,560 --> 02:25:46,560
same room.

2794
02:25:46,560 --> 02:25:50,760
Like a lot, a lot of podcasts aren't able to do that, which, you know, I know I do,

2795
02:25:50,760 --> 02:25:52,000
I do another podcast.

2796
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:55,000
I do two other podcasts where we're not all in the same room and there are a lot of fun.

2797
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:58,620
I know, but I feel like part of what makes this show special is that we are all here

2798
02:25:58,620 --> 02:25:59,620
in the same room.

2799
02:25:59,620 --> 02:26:00,840
So if we lost that, I don't know.

2800
02:26:00,840 --> 02:26:05,600
I mean, I know we did it for a few months after, you know, your son was born low key,

2801
02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:08,240
but that it's something different when there's a time on it.

2802
02:26:08,240 --> 02:26:11,520
And the fact that some of us were still here in studio, it's just, you were remote, you

2803
02:26:11,520 --> 02:26:16,040
know, I don't know how I'd feel about that being a permanent thing though.

2804
02:26:16,040 --> 02:26:22,440
So anyway, just throwing that out there, uh, over at our chat room, over at live.vognetwork.com

2805
02:26:22,440 --> 02:26:27,640
SSG100 Matt says, from what I know of Rob, whether it's OLR or not, I can see him podcasting

2806
02:26:27,640 --> 02:26:29,080
into his fifties.

2807
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:31,240
Yeah, probably.

2808
02:26:31,240 --> 02:26:35,640
Bonds006 says, I started with OLR on the podcast about 2005.

2809
02:26:35,640 --> 02:26:39,080
Back in my day, when you had the only mic in an online game, it meant your word was

2810
02:26:39,080 --> 02:26:40,640
the law.

2811
02:26:40,640 --> 02:26:43,320
Some folks talking about microphones in online games.

2812
02:26:43,320 --> 02:26:44,320
All right.

2813
02:26:44,320 --> 02:26:49,400
So anyhow, um, and I kind of tend to agree with SSG100 Matt.

2814
02:26:49,400 --> 02:26:52,920
I probably will be podcasting well into my fifties.

2815
02:26:52,920 --> 02:26:56,480
It might not be about this topic, but, uh, probably be something going on.

2816
02:26:56,480 --> 02:26:58,960
It'll probably be about RuPaul's Drag Race, right?

2817
02:26:58,960 --> 02:27:01,520
I'll still be doing that, right?

2818
02:27:01,520 --> 02:27:03,360
Anyway, uh, moving on.

2819
02:27:03,360 --> 02:27:08,760
One more email here from Martin in Belgium, uh, emails us and says, I was interested to

2820
02:27:08,760 --> 02:27:12,320
hear Sky and Loki talk about Ingress last episode.

2821
02:27:12,320 --> 02:27:14,620
Remember that discussion, Loki?

2822
02:27:14,620 --> 02:27:18,340
One thing that did not come up was the fact that Google might be using this game for location

2823
02:27:18,340 --> 02:27:20,080
data mining purposes.

2824
02:27:20,080 --> 02:27:23,840
Google in the past has been doing all kinds of creepy stuff, such as logging all the wifi

2825
02:27:23,840 --> 02:27:26,160
networks and range of their street view cars.

2826
02:27:26,160 --> 02:27:29,040
They now use that data to more accurately determine locations.

2827
02:27:29,040 --> 02:27:33,320
It is hard to believe that Google is not using this app for something similar, given the

2828
02:27:33,320 --> 02:27:35,320
fact that they are pushing it so hard.

2829
02:27:35,320 --> 02:27:39,260
They could use this GPS enabled app to get all kinds of location data, including the

2830
02:27:39,260 --> 02:27:43,660
most popular landmarks in an area, routes you take to get there, or even personal location

2831
02:27:43,660 --> 02:27:45,760
data tied to your Google account, et cetera.

2832
02:27:45,760 --> 02:27:50,000
I think the app claims that no data is being sent back, but in the past, companies like

2833
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:53,520
Google and Apple have been known to send back data without alerting the user.

2834
02:27:53,520 --> 02:27:55,720
How would you feel about the game if this would be the case?

2835
02:27:55,720 --> 02:27:56,960
Would you keep playing it?

2836
02:27:56,960 --> 02:28:00,520
Personally, I'm very aware of trying not to give these companies too much of my data.

2837
02:28:00,520 --> 02:28:03,720
I always disable location history and things like that on my phone.

2838
02:28:03,720 --> 02:28:06,320
This may be tinfoil hat of me, but I don't trust this app.

2839
02:28:06,320 --> 02:28:07,920
It just seems fishy.

2840
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:08,920
Keep up the great show.

2841
02:28:08,920 --> 02:28:10,560
All the best, Martin from Belgium."

2842
02:28:10,560 --> 02:28:17,320
Sure, that thought's crossed my mind that they might be mining the location data, but

2843
02:28:17,320 --> 02:28:19,520
there's two things to keep in mind with that.

2844
02:28:19,520 --> 02:28:23,880
One, if Google wants to know where I live, they already figured it out.

2845
02:28:23,880 --> 02:28:26,480
They could just look at where I log into my Gmail account from.

2846
02:28:26,480 --> 02:28:28,680
They could probably find a lot out about my habits from that.

2847
02:28:28,680 --> 02:28:30,760
Yeah, I was going to say, they probably don't need a game.

2848
02:28:30,760 --> 02:28:31,760
They don't need a game to do it.

2849
02:28:31,760 --> 02:28:32,760
Yeah, exactly.

2850
02:28:32,760 --> 02:28:34,760
They will just build it into their fucking operating system.

2851
02:28:34,760 --> 02:28:39,720
As far as to know what landmarks are visited frequently and so forth, although that's a

2852
02:28:39,720 --> 02:28:44,680
good thought as well, and I'm not trying to discredit that, I would challenge this, is

2853
02:28:44,680 --> 02:28:51,540
that Ingress, part of the challenge is going to places I wouldn't usually go to.

2854
02:28:51,540 --> 02:28:55,740
If they're trying to track what landmarks people go to, it's going to be artificial

2855
02:28:55,740 --> 02:29:00,140
because some of these places I would never have gone to if it wasn't for Ingress, which

2856
02:29:00,140 --> 02:29:05,740
is both a positive and a negative because the positive is, I also get out of my car,

2857
02:29:05,740 --> 02:29:09,060
get up off my butt, and walk through some of these parks.

2858
02:29:09,060 --> 02:29:16,220
The other night, Thursday night, the Enlightened, the Green Team had a medium-sized event where

2859
02:29:16,220 --> 02:29:20,920
10 people showed up at this predetermined location where we walked around the circumference

2860
02:29:20,920 --> 02:29:26,360
of a park for a couple hours and did all the nodes and then farmed gear off of them.

2861
02:29:26,360 --> 02:29:29,560
So I wouldn't have gotten that exercise if it wasn't for Ingress.

2862
02:29:29,560 --> 02:29:33,420
So that's part of the reason why I'm still into the game.

2863
02:29:33,420 --> 02:29:36,820
But as far as like, is Google spying on me and so forth?

2864
02:29:36,820 --> 02:29:39,100
What is the real intention of Ingress?

2865
02:29:39,100 --> 02:29:45,180
I kind of think even Google doesn't know what the fuck Ingress is, and I think that's part

2866
02:29:45,180 --> 02:29:46,740
of what Google does sometimes.

2867
02:29:46,740 --> 02:29:51,000
And we have heard of the fact that they're supposed to be using that technology in some

2868
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:57,120
other games that they're making, like there's this whole thing, that guy who got into trouble

2869
02:29:57,120 --> 02:30:01,740
with Oprah, what was his name, James Frey, is now writing some novel that is going to

2870
02:30:01,740 --> 02:30:07,060
be teaming up with the people who made Ingress for some other type of ARG.

2871
02:30:07,060 --> 02:30:14,220
And Google with the Ingress, it allows them to get pictures of things from people on foot

2872
02:30:14,220 --> 02:30:19,260
in places that cars can't get into, like parks, like trails.

2873
02:30:19,260 --> 02:30:23,500
And that is information about like, where are all these landmarks that people might

2874
02:30:23,500 --> 02:30:24,500
want to see?

2875
02:30:24,500 --> 02:30:26,900
That is information that they could turn around and market as well.

2876
02:30:26,900 --> 02:30:32,260
So I do think there's data in that regard that they can get from Ingress, but I highly

2877
02:30:32,260 --> 02:30:35,120
doubt Google's making a lot of money off Ingress, if at all.

2878
02:30:35,120 --> 02:30:37,820
They occasionally have their commercial sponsor, but that's really it.

2879
02:30:37,820 --> 02:30:40,140
But am I worried that Google's tracking that?

2880
02:30:40,140 --> 02:30:43,820
I kind of feel like if they wanted to track it, they'd already be doing it.

2881
02:30:43,820 --> 02:30:45,940
They wouldn't need Ingress for me to do it.

2882
02:30:45,940 --> 02:30:50,980
I mean, hell, Apple would find my friends in that location thing.

2883
02:30:50,980 --> 02:30:54,740
I mean, Apple knows where I'm at all the time.

2884
02:30:54,740 --> 02:30:58,140
And it's one of those double-edged swords because it's like, I want that because if

2885
02:30:58,140 --> 02:31:02,660
my phone ever gets stolen, excuse me, I want to be able to find it.

2886
02:31:02,660 --> 02:31:06,100
I want to know who has my phone and tell the police, go here, it's in this shed.

2887
02:31:06,100 --> 02:31:07,100
You know?

2888
02:31:07,100 --> 02:31:09,100
So it's a double-edged sword.

2889
02:31:09,100 --> 02:31:14,260
Kaijuto in our chat room over at live.vognetware.com says, Google doesn't give a shit where you're

2890
02:31:14,260 --> 02:31:15,260
at.

2891
02:31:15,260 --> 02:31:16,260
They just want to make that paper.

2892
02:31:16,260 --> 02:31:20,100
Raginator says, what are the odds that Google's feeding the government any and all data they

2893
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:21,740
gather from your Ingress use?

2894
02:31:21,740 --> 02:31:28,140
See, I just, again, I just feel like you're starting to get a little tinfoil hat.

2895
02:31:28,140 --> 02:31:32,020
And I'm not saying you shouldn't question things.

2896
02:31:32,020 --> 02:31:33,020
That's fine.

2897
02:31:33,020 --> 02:31:36,800
But I also, I'm just, the reality is if the government wants to know where you're at,

2898
02:31:36,800 --> 02:31:40,320
they don't need Ingress to do it, and they don't need a lot of other stuff to do it.

2899
02:31:40,320 --> 02:31:41,800
They'll find it.

2900
02:31:41,800 --> 02:31:46,560
Just kind of what I believe to be the case, but maybe I'm wrong.

2901
02:31:46,560 --> 02:31:48,920
Anyhow, I still welcome all your opinions.

2902
02:31:48,920 --> 02:31:53,660
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com if you wish to send us an email for next week.

2903
02:31:53,660 --> 02:31:58,960
In the meantime, this is the point of the show where we get into the FUs of the week.

2904
02:31:58,960 --> 02:31:59,960
Why?

2905
02:31:59,960 --> 02:32:00,880
Because FU, that's why.

2906
02:32:06,800 --> 02:32:17,800
Loki.

2907
02:32:17,800 --> 02:32:19,840
I love my kids.

2908
02:32:19,840 --> 02:32:21,520
I love my son Josh.

2909
02:32:21,520 --> 02:32:30,440
But at the same time, I am fucking pissed off at him for, he's very sensitive, I guess.

2910
02:32:30,440 --> 02:32:33,200
And he was super excited to go to the Marvel show and everything.

2911
02:32:33,200 --> 02:32:37,800
So you know, I figured, it's only here once this year, so if I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna

2912
02:32:37,800 --> 02:32:38,800
do it right.

2913
02:32:38,800 --> 02:32:41,840
I'm gonna get some seats so we can actually see everything, we're not gonna be way up

2914
02:32:41,840 --> 02:32:45,720
in the bleachers and stuff like that.

2915
02:32:45,720 --> 02:32:47,800
And he fucking got scared five minutes in.

2916
02:32:47,800 --> 02:32:50,860
And that shit was fucking expensive.

2917
02:32:50,860 --> 02:32:53,640
That's like throwing away $200.

2918
02:32:53,640 --> 02:32:59,520
And I was just fucking pissed at him and just yelling at him when I really shouldn't be

2919
02:32:59,520 --> 02:33:00,520
doing that.

2920
02:33:00,520 --> 02:33:07,480
Seriously though, what's up with kids not appreciating what you're doing for them?

2921
02:33:07,480 --> 02:33:08,480
Someday he will.

2922
02:33:08,480 --> 02:33:13,360
Be sure to tell him about how scared he got when he's 18, he'll really appreciate that.

2923
02:33:13,360 --> 02:33:14,640
I will be sure to do that.

2924
02:33:14,640 --> 02:33:18,480
Maybe we can save this recording for him when he turns 18.

2925
02:33:18,480 --> 02:33:19,480
Sure.

2926
02:33:19,480 --> 02:33:20,480
All right.

2927
02:33:20,480 --> 02:33:23,280
Uh oh, Alan wants to share a story with us, why don't you grab that yellow mic on the

2928
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:25,000
table over there Alan.

2929
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:26,360
Hi Alan, welcome to the studio.

2930
02:33:26,360 --> 02:33:27,360
Hello.

2931
02:33:27,360 --> 02:33:28,360
It's not like you live here or anything.

2932
02:33:28,360 --> 02:33:29,360
Yeah.

2933
02:33:29,360 --> 02:33:30,360
How's Diablo 3 going for you?

2934
02:33:31,200 --> 02:33:33,200
What paragon level are you now?

2935
02:33:33,200 --> 02:33:34,200
385.

2936
02:33:34,200 --> 02:33:35,200
Oh my God.

2937
02:33:35,200 --> 02:33:36,200
All right.

2938
02:33:36,200 --> 02:33:40,440
When I was five or six, my mom took me to Sesame Street Live where they do the stage

2939
02:33:40,440 --> 02:33:45,800
show and Big Bird is there and I was so happy and I got like second or third row seats and

2940
02:33:45,800 --> 02:33:50,240
they were having at the end, they were giving like t-shirts and balloons to certain kids.

2941
02:33:50,240 --> 02:33:53,480
They were picking people out of the audience to come up and hug Big Bird.

2942
02:33:53,480 --> 02:33:57,660
And of course five or six year old's dream is to hug Big Bird.

2943
02:33:58,260 --> 02:34:01,940
I know some people that are 35 that would love to hug Big Bird.

2944
02:34:01,940 --> 02:34:03,820
I would now because I'm six four, a fucker's tall.

2945
02:34:03,820 --> 02:34:04,820
So I'm like, here's a big hug.

2946
02:34:04,820 --> 02:34:09,620
I'm not having to hug a midget, a little person, sorry.

2947
02:34:09,620 --> 02:34:12,580
And they didn't pick me and they're like, that's it, good night.

2948
02:34:12,580 --> 02:34:15,060
I was devastated.

2949
02:34:15,060 --> 02:34:21,500
I cried, like threw up, like I was crying that hard for hours after.

2950
02:34:21,500 --> 02:34:26,780
My mom was like, if they can't give every single kid a thing, because that was like

2951
02:34:26,780 --> 02:34:31,780
a waste of money because I was enjoying it up until the very end and I didn't get picked

2952
02:34:31,780 --> 02:34:33,260
to go up on stage and hug Big Bird.

2953
02:34:33,260 --> 02:34:35,100
So I cry.

2954
02:34:35,100 --> 02:34:37,300
So basically my point is that kids suck.

2955
02:34:37,300 --> 02:34:38,300
They're shitty.

2956
02:34:38,300 --> 02:34:40,100
Well, I just say like, at least you got to sit there.

2957
02:34:40,100 --> 02:34:43,260
I would be fine if like they did the same thing, you know, if that was what happened,

2958
02:34:43,260 --> 02:34:45,900
but like, well, you know, listen, they can't possibly get that.

2959
02:34:45,900 --> 02:34:46,900
Look how many kids are here.

2960
02:34:46,900 --> 02:34:47,900
They can't give something out there.

2961
02:34:47,900 --> 02:34:49,500
At least we got to see the show.

2962
02:34:49,500 --> 02:34:52,560
But it was like, I didn't get to see shit.

2963
02:34:52,560 --> 02:34:55,340
What I saw of the show, I already watched on YouTube.

2964
02:34:55,340 --> 02:35:00,340
So I could have saved myself $200 by fucking watching.

2965
02:35:00,340 --> 02:35:03,140
You have several people in the chat room that are going, but he's just a kid, Loki.

2966
02:35:03,140 --> 02:35:04,140
I understand that.

2967
02:35:04,140 --> 02:35:05,400
But there's other kids.

2968
02:35:05,400 --> 02:35:08,260
There was a ton of other kids in his age group, OK?

2969
02:35:08,260 --> 02:35:09,260
This is a kid.

2970
02:35:09,260 --> 02:35:12,300
He is super like sensitive to like loud noises and stuff like that.

2971
02:35:12,300 --> 02:35:14,300
And you still love your kid, which is reiterated at the beginning.

2972
02:35:14,300 --> 02:35:17,220
I still love him, but like it's frustrating sometimes because I want to take him to do

2973
02:35:17,220 --> 02:35:21,460
all these fun things and he gets fucking scared over everything.

2974
02:35:21,460 --> 02:35:24,540
And he'll make up stuff to be scared about.

2975
02:35:25,060 --> 02:35:27,340
The nephew of the week is to vent.

2976
02:35:27,340 --> 02:35:28,340
But I will say this.

2977
02:35:28,340 --> 02:35:31,300
You know what's going to happen, Loki, is that, and this happens with a lot of kids,

2978
02:35:31,300 --> 02:35:34,500
around age like six or seven, he's just going to transform.

2979
02:35:34,500 --> 02:35:38,060
And suddenly it's going to be like, now the kid will be like a little brat.

2980
02:35:38,060 --> 02:35:39,060
And you won't be...

2981
02:35:39,060 --> 02:35:40,060
He already is!

2982
02:35:40,060 --> 02:35:41,060
It doesn't matter.

2983
02:35:41,060 --> 02:35:42,060
It doesn't...

2984
02:35:42,060 --> 02:35:43,060
I don't get the any of...

2985
02:35:43,060 --> 02:35:44,300
There is no upside.

2986
02:35:44,300 --> 02:35:47,020
He is a brat and fucking...

2987
02:35:47,020 --> 02:35:48,020
Just like daddy.

2988
02:35:48,020 --> 02:35:50,820
It's like, there is no upside.

2989
02:35:50,820 --> 02:35:53,260
All right.

2990
02:35:53,260 --> 02:35:54,260
I like that story.

2991
02:35:54,980 --> 02:35:55,980
Thank you.

2992
02:35:55,980 --> 02:35:58,740
I'm so glad you could talk about how Big Bird made you throw up here on the show.

2993
02:35:58,740 --> 02:35:59,740
Yeah.

2994
02:35:59,740 --> 02:36:00,740
Well, he didn't hug me.

2995
02:36:00,740 --> 02:36:01,740
If he hugged me, I would have been fine.

2996
02:36:01,740 --> 02:36:04,700
But I wailed for hours.

2997
02:36:04,700 --> 02:36:08,620
Now I feel like for your birthday, I should put on a Big Bird costume and come out and

2998
02:36:08,620 --> 02:36:09,620
give you a hug.

2999
02:36:09,620 --> 02:36:10,620
Don't take it there.

3000
02:36:10,620 --> 02:36:11,620
No.

3001
02:36:11,620 --> 02:36:14,100
So here's what I'll do differently.

3002
02:36:14,100 --> 02:36:16,860
Next time, if I were to do something differently, I wouldn't sit as close because I think if

3003
02:36:16,860 --> 02:36:21,360
we were sitting up like at the top of the, you know, the lower section or something,

3004
02:36:21,360 --> 02:36:23,140
it wouldn't have been so bad.

3005
02:36:23,140 --> 02:36:25,700
It's just that they're doing live pyrotechnics in the front.

3006
02:36:25,700 --> 02:36:29,020
He's never seen a show with live pyrotechnics and stuff.

3007
02:36:29,020 --> 02:36:31,700
And so it's a little bit, you know, frightening for him.

3008
02:36:31,700 --> 02:36:32,700
All right.

3009
02:36:32,700 --> 02:36:33,700
So at least you have a lesson learned out of this.

3010
02:36:33,700 --> 02:36:34,700
I understand that.

3011
02:36:34,700 --> 02:36:38,260
But yeah, and also the lesson is I'm not going to waste $200 on fucking tickets too.

3012
02:36:38,260 --> 02:36:40,500
They wanted $12 fucking dollars for popcorn.

3013
02:36:40,500 --> 02:36:41,500
I bought that popcorn.

3014
02:36:41,500 --> 02:36:44,740
I damn well am going to eat every single piece of that popcorn.

3015
02:36:44,740 --> 02:36:45,740
It's not gone yet.

3016
02:36:45,740 --> 02:36:50,700
But they seriously wanted like $15 for a fucking snow cone.

3017
02:36:50,700 --> 02:36:52,940
I mean, come on.

3018
02:36:52,940 --> 02:36:56,620
Speaking of stadium events and paying too much money, I want to give an FU this week

3019
02:36:56,620 --> 02:36:59,140
to the San Jose Sharks.

3020
02:36:59,140 --> 02:37:00,140
You're my team, guys.

3021
02:37:00,140 --> 02:37:01,140
You're my team.

3022
02:37:01,140 --> 02:37:02,620
You're my hometown team.

3023
02:37:02,620 --> 02:37:06,740
You got to break Alan's hockey cherry as well, going to his first Sharks game.

3024
02:37:06,740 --> 02:37:09,220
Did you have fun at the Sharks game, Alan?

3025
02:37:09,220 --> 02:37:13,140
I did, but I have to give a shout out to those seats we got.

3026
02:37:13,140 --> 02:37:14,140
Oh, yeah.

3027
02:37:14,140 --> 02:37:19,380
It would have been nice if they had won with those seats, but we were eight rows from rink.

3028
02:37:19,380 --> 02:37:20,380
Yeah.

3029
02:37:20,380 --> 02:37:21,380
No, that was awesome.

3030
02:37:21,380 --> 02:37:22,380
That was my buddy, Neil.

3031
02:37:22,380 --> 02:37:24,580
He's been playing in the zone since high school that helped hook us up with that.

3032
02:37:24,580 --> 02:37:26,620
So thank you.

3033
02:37:26,620 --> 02:37:27,900
Very appreciative about that.

3034
02:37:27,900 --> 02:37:32,560
But yeah, FU San Jose Sharks for just choking in the third period.

3035
02:37:32,560 --> 02:37:35,980
It was tied 2-2 at the end of the second period.

3036
02:37:35,980 --> 02:37:42,940
And then period three started and the Black Hawks were like, you know what, we're tired

3037
02:37:42,940 --> 02:37:43,940
of this.

3038
02:37:43,940 --> 02:37:45,500
We're just going to win now.

3039
02:37:45,500 --> 02:37:46,500
Yep.

3040
02:37:46,500 --> 02:37:47,500
Man.

3041
02:37:47,500 --> 02:37:52,320
But at the very least, the very least, because before the show, the Kill Time, because he

3042
02:37:52,360 --> 02:37:55,800
had a Batman shirt on that I just wasn't going to do.

3043
02:37:55,800 --> 02:37:59,560
So we went and bought Marvel shirts and so he got an Avenger shirt and I got a Deadpool

3044
02:37:59,560 --> 02:38:00,560
shirt.

3045
02:38:00,560 --> 02:38:01,560
So at least I have a Deadpool shirt.

3046
02:38:01,560 --> 02:38:02,560
At least you have a Deadpool shirt.

3047
02:38:02,560 --> 02:38:05,320
At least I have a Deadpool shirt and some popcorn that I'm going to eat no matter how

3048
02:38:05,320 --> 02:38:06,320
stale it gets.

3049
02:38:06,320 --> 02:38:08,960
Because I paid $12 for that fucking popcorn.

3050
02:38:08,960 --> 02:38:13,200
I am eating every piece of that popcorn.

3051
02:38:13,200 --> 02:38:17,040
Tigerclaw in chat says, what if your presence at the game is the reason why the team lost,

3052
02:38:17,040 --> 02:38:18,040
Rob?

3053
02:38:18,040 --> 02:38:19,040
Just saying.

3054
02:38:19,040 --> 02:38:20,040
Yeah, because that's two losses in a row now.

3055
02:38:20,040 --> 02:38:22,040
They saying you're a cooler?

3056
02:38:22,260 --> 02:38:23,260
You know what?

3057
02:38:23,260 --> 02:38:24,260
Don't go there.

3058
02:38:24,260 --> 02:38:25,260
I am.

3059
02:38:25,260 --> 02:38:29,760
I'm sorry if my radiant beauty and presence just throws the team off their game.

3060
02:38:29,760 --> 02:38:30,760
I can't.

3061
02:38:30,760 --> 02:38:31,760
I can't.

3062
02:38:31,760 --> 02:38:35,120
My friends are already suggesting that I'm the cause of the losses, but I'm telling you

3063
02:38:35,120 --> 02:38:40,320
four goals in one period and removing the goalie from the net so they could score on

3064
02:38:40,320 --> 02:38:41,320
an empty net.

3065
02:38:41,320 --> 02:38:43,320
These were not my decisions, people.

3066
02:38:43,320 --> 02:38:44,320
Not my decisions.

3067
02:38:44,320 --> 02:38:48,320
Anyhow, just a few more stories for you guys and we're going to open up the Skyline quickly

3068
02:38:48,320 --> 02:38:49,320
to get your calls.

3069
02:38:49,320 --> 02:38:53,160
I'm a little late here tonight because of the announcements we did live on VoG before

3070
02:38:53,160 --> 02:38:57,200
the show tonight, but I do want to at least try to get one or two calls in, especially

3071
02:38:57,200 --> 02:39:01,200
people might want to talk about GDC, South by Southwest, PAX, or one of the many things

3072
02:39:01,200 --> 02:39:03,200
that have been going on over the past couple weeks.

3073
02:39:03,200 --> 02:39:06,200
1-877-GAMO-LR or a username on Skype, Orange Law and Tradeo.

3074
02:39:06,200 --> 02:39:10,080
But first, before I get to those calls, a few more stories for you guys.

3075
02:39:10,080 --> 02:39:11,080
Loki.

3076
02:39:11,080 --> 02:39:19,240
So, Marvelous has just acquired G-mode and with that they've also acquired most of

3077
02:39:19,240 --> 02:39:27,240
Data East's intellectual properties, including Magical Drop, Joe and Mac, which, shit, when's

3078
02:39:27,240 --> 02:39:33,080
there been, when's the last time we had a Joe and Mac game, SNES?

3079
02:39:33,080 --> 02:39:38,560
Let's see, Fighter's History, Caveman Ninja, and BurgerTime, among others.

3080
02:39:38,560 --> 02:39:39,560
Yes!

3081
02:39:39,560 --> 02:39:42,040
So maybe we'll get another BurgerTime game.

3082
02:39:42,040 --> 02:39:43,040
Yes!

3083
02:39:43,040 --> 02:39:45,400
That'd be pretty sweet.

3084
02:39:45,400 --> 02:39:46,400
What else do they have?

3085
02:39:46,400 --> 02:39:51,480
They also have, I guess, Metal Max, I still remember that, and Vapor Trail.

3086
02:39:51,480 --> 02:39:55,120
So I wonder if we'll see some more games from that, hopefully, hopefully they do something

3087
02:39:55,120 --> 02:39:56,120
with it.

3088
02:39:56,120 --> 02:39:57,280
I mean, obviously they would do something with it.

3089
02:39:57,280 --> 02:39:58,280
Why would you purchase it?

3090
02:39:58,280 --> 02:40:00,200
Why would they buy it if they're not going to do anything with it, right?

3091
02:40:00,200 --> 02:40:03,720
Data East, so, uh, does that mean we're going to get a new Bad Dudes game?

3092
02:40:03,720 --> 02:40:05,320
Are we going to get a new Bad Dudes game?

3093
02:40:05,320 --> 02:40:07,080
Are they a bad enough dude to put out Bad Dudes?

3094
02:40:07,080 --> 02:40:10,000
Can we get a new Bad Dudes game, because that'd be pretty sweet.

3095
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,760
I don't know, Bad Dudes is kind of one of the games, it actually wasn't very good.

3096
02:40:12,760 --> 02:40:15,000
Like I don't know if you ever played Bad Dudes on the NES, it really wasn't good.

3097
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:19,880
I played Bad Dudes all the time, and I could never do a fucking Roundhouse game with it.

3098
02:40:19,880 --> 02:40:20,880
Never.

3099
02:40:20,880 --> 02:40:23,840
It was... it was too hard.

3100
02:40:23,840 --> 02:40:30,560
Alright, uh, this is interesting, something, it's a peripheral for the Oculus Rift, you

3101
02:40:30,560 --> 02:40:32,880
know, VR, it's where everything's going.

3102
02:40:32,880 --> 02:40:34,440
That looks like a creepy face.

3103
02:40:34,440 --> 02:40:36,440
Lots of people talking about the Oculus Rift.

3104
02:40:36,440 --> 02:40:40,840
Well that creepy face that Loki is referring to is Feel Real.

3105
02:40:40,840 --> 02:40:47,400
It is a Bluetooth add-on for the Oculus Rift that straps over your mouth and nose.

3106
02:40:47,400 --> 02:40:51,600
It looks like a creepy face that you'd be making out with.

3107
02:40:51,600 --> 02:40:54,480
It looks like a creepy like face that you would make out with or something.

3108
02:40:54,480 --> 02:40:59,120
Yeah, it does kind of look like something you would make out with, but uh, anyway, this

3109
02:40:59,120 --> 02:41:05,080
battery powered device will produce seven different scents.

3110
02:41:05,080 --> 02:41:08,440
Like smelly scents, not like money, but scents.

3111
02:41:08,440 --> 02:41:14,120
So it's smell-o-vision with this thing, with unique scents that you can smell.

3112
02:41:14,120 --> 02:41:20,640
So this mask will allow you to smell things like the ocean, a waterfall, or fire.

3113
02:41:20,640 --> 02:41:27,920
Also I guess this will produce temperature controlled air, mist, and vibrations.

3114
02:41:27,920 --> 02:41:36,120
So um, that's uh, that's something every game just gets one step closer to the holodeck,

3115
02:41:36,120 --> 02:41:37,120
doesn't it?

3116
02:41:37,120 --> 02:41:41,560
But now the holodeck will smell like fire and spray you with water and other temperature

3117
02:41:41,560 --> 02:41:42,560
controlled elements.

3118
02:41:42,560 --> 02:41:46,160
So you got to admit though, I mean, as much as we're kind of sitting here and making fun

3119
02:41:46,160 --> 02:41:50,360
of the way it looks and so forth, it does seem like a logical step.

3120
02:41:50,360 --> 02:41:55,000
If you're going to put this thing over your eyes and be immersed in this world with all

3121
02:41:55,000 --> 02:42:00,720
your vision, wouldn't it make sense that, you know, the temp, the other feelings besides

3122
02:42:00,720 --> 02:42:04,500
just your vision, your other senses are stimulated as well and it makes sense.

3123
02:42:04,500 --> 02:42:08,540
That would be cool except, you know, when I'm smelling fire in game and I just don't

3124
02:42:08,540 --> 02:42:13,340
realize that my house is burning down because I have a giant VR headset over me.

3125
02:42:13,340 --> 02:42:18,760
What if you're playing a very violent game on Oculus Rift and you're smelling blood?

3126
02:42:18,760 --> 02:42:22,700
Or people, you know, relieving themselves as you murder them, so.

3127
02:42:22,700 --> 02:42:24,220
That might be a bit much actually.

3128
02:42:24,220 --> 02:42:28,180
I don't, I think smell-o-vision, everyone tries to do smell-o-vision, I just don't think

3129
02:42:28,180 --> 02:42:32,420
it's going to work until you can get it to where you can simulate any smell.

3130
02:42:32,420 --> 02:42:36,700
And even then it's just, I think it's just too hard of a sense to do.

3131
02:42:36,700 --> 02:42:39,060
We don't understand enough about how it works.

3132
02:42:39,060 --> 02:42:43,460
Yeah, usually the smell-o-vision stuff is very limited but, you know, I think about

3133
02:42:43,460 --> 02:42:47,740
like some of the Disney stuff where they kind of like, you know, people love Soarin', right?

3134
02:42:47,740 --> 02:42:50,980
At Disney World they have Soarin' or Soarin' over California or whatever it's called and

3135
02:42:50,980 --> 02:42:53,160
they have it here at California Adventure as well.

3136
02:42:53,160 --> 02:42:56,720
Like a lot of people really like that ride because, again, a lot of your senses are being

3137
02:42:56,720 --> 02:43:00,780
stimulated because you have the vision, which isn't quite the same as Oculus Rift.

3138
02:43:00,780 --> 02:43:02,740
They need a better screen for that nowadays.

3139
02:43:02,740 --> 02:43:05,780
They're actually, they're refurbing it right now as we speak, it's down and the screen

3140
02:43:05,780 --> 02:43:09,980
is getting an HD refurbishment so, your wish is Disney's command, right?

3141
02:43:09,980 --> 02:43:10,980
The magic never ends.

3142
02:43:10,980 --> 02:43:11,980
It better be.

3143
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:17,940
So, but then not only that but you have that sensation of flying which simulates your senses

3144
02:43:17,940 --> 02:43:22,260
as well and then, yes, even though it's limited, you know, you smell the oranges when you go

3145
02:43:22,260 --> 02:43:25,860
over the orange field and you smell the pine trees and you go over the pine field and I

3146
02:43:25,860 --> 02:43:29,980
think that's really why people love that ride because it's so many different senses all

3147
02:43:29,980 --> 02:43:30,980
being hit at once.

3148
02:43:30,980 --> 02:43:32,660
It's a nice air-conditioned building.

3149
02:43:32,660 --> 02:43:34,580
Yes, that is true.

3150
02:43:34,580 --> 02:43:35,580
That is very true.

3151
02:43:35,580 --> 02:43:38,260
No, or hardly ever a line.

3152
02:43:38,260 --> 02:43:40,740
Kaijuto is wondering, what if I'm playing The Binding of Isaac?

3153
02:43:40,740 --> 02:43:41,740
Well, you know.

3154
02:43:41,740 --> 02:43:44,780
Well, you're gonna smell a lot of blood and feces, I guess.

3155
02:43:44,780 --> 02:43:46,900
Here's the thing, too.

3156
02:43:46,900 --> 02:43:47,900
A lot of game.

3157
02:43:47,900 --> 02:43:53,180
He didn't mention what those other smells were, so it's ocean, fire, and vomit and shit.

3158
02:43:53,180 --> 02:43:58,740
Yeah, and a nerd expo, but no, here's the thing.

3159
02:43:58,740 --> 02:44:03,260
Keep in mind that the goal of the Rift is to not just port all the old games into the

3160
02:44:03,260 --> 02:44:04,260
Rift.

3161
02:44:04,260 --> 02:44:06,340
That's kind of doing it wrong, I think, in many ways.

3162
02:44:06,340 --> 02:44:11,260
Like, you know, we had that 8-bit Zelda experience in the Rift.

3163
02:44:11,260 --> 02:44:15,660
Look, Zelda was not designed to be a Rift game, but there are some pretty cool experiences,

3164
02:44:15,660 --> 02:44:16,660
you know, on the Rift.

3165
02:44:16,660 --> 02:44:21,940
I would love an 8-bit style game that would look like Zelda in the Rift.

3166
02:44:21,940 --> 02:44:24,900
Yeah, but it would have to be something that's kind of developed by that.

3167
02:44:24,900 --> 02:44:28,900
But I mean, like, for example, Bobby let me check out his Gear VR, which is the thing

3168
02:44:28,900 --> 02:44:33,260
that the Note 4 mobile device, you just pop it right in the headset and do it.

3169
02:44:33,260 --> 02:44:34,260
You know what I want?

3170
02:44:34,260 --> 02:44:35,260
What?

3171
02:44:35,260 --> 02:44:36,260
Like, super bad.

3172
02:44:36,260 --> 02:44:37,260
Stop interrupting my story.

3173
02:44:37,260 --> 02:44:38,260
Oh, sorry.

3174
02:44:38,260 --> 02:44:42,540
But I saw this Paul McCartney concert in it, and this Cirque du Soleil thing.

3175
02:44:42,540 --> 02:44:47,020
These weren't games, but they were experiences that, like Soarin' Over California, might

3176
02:44:47,020 --> 02:44:50,620
be kind of cool with the smell, but I just don't see where you could get that at a consumer

3177
02:44:50,620 --> 02:44:51,620
level.

3178
02:44:51,620 --> 02:44:52,620
And it would be very limited.

3179
02:44:52,620 --> 02:44:54,180
All right, yes, your Tangent Loki.

3180
02:44:54,180 --> 02:44:55,620
I want Zelda Maker.

3181
02:44:55,620 --> 02:44:58,500
Oh, if Mario Maker does really well, you want Zelda Maker?

3182
02:44:58,500 --> 02:45:00,340
I don't even give a shit if Mario Maker does really well.

3183
02:45:00,340 --> 02:45:02,160
I want Zelda Maker.

3184
02:45:02,160 --> 02:45:03,160
And then Metroid Maker.

3185
02:45:03,160 --> 02:45:04,980
Let's do all of those.

3186
02:45:04,980 --> 02:45:08,580
You know, if Nintendo was- Or Mario Kart Maker, they'd never do that,

3187
02:45:08,580 --> 02:45:09,580
though.

3188
02:45:09,580 --> 02:45:13,740
If Nintendo was listening to you on this program right now, Loki, they probably turned it off

3189
02:45:13,740 --> 02:45:15,300
about 90 minutes ago.

3190
02:45:15,300 --> 02:45:17,900
I'm sorry, they're throwing away money, okay?

3191
02:45:17,900 --> 02:45:21,660
You know, I understand that you really want to keep him happy, and that's fine.

3192
02:45:21,660 --> 02:45:26,020
He'll make his Mario games later on in Star Fox and all that fun stuff, but I'm sorry.

3193
02:45:26,020 --> 02:45:34,300
It's just not gonna- I love the guy, but it's just- I don't see those being successful.

3194
02:45:34,300 --> 02:45:35,300
I just don't.

3195
02:45:35,300 --> 02:45:36,300
But you know what?

3196
02:45:36,300 --> 02:45:38,100
Prove me wrong, please.

3197
02:45:38,100 --> 02:45:39,700
I hope that I'm wrong.

3198
02:45:39,700 --> 02:45:43,980
I just think it's gonna flop, and it's gonna suck, or it's just nothing's gonna ever happen

3199
02:45:43,980 --> 02:45:44,980
with it.

3200
02:45:44,980 --> 02:45:45,980
It's more of an experiment, and that's it.

3201
02:45:45,980 --> 02:45:49,380
Yeah, Dartitsuya is saying, are you sure you're not gonna dog on Zelda Maker if they do it?

3202
02:45:50,100 --> 02:45:52,940
All right, Nsj100Matt says, or Mega Man Maker?

3203
02:45:52,940 --> 02:45:53,940
Oh, wait.

3204
02:45:53,940 --> 02:45:54,940
Womp, womp, womp.

3205
02:45:54,940 --> 02:45:59,140
Well, hey, we could have had that at one time, you know, but that never-

3206
02:45:59,140 --> 02:46:00,140
That's the joke.

3207
02:46:00,140 --> 02:46:03,580
Well, technically they had that on PSP, but you know.

3208
02:46:03,580 --> 02:46:07,480
Back on the Smellovision real quick, Kaijuto is saying, didn't TGIF do smell stuff?

3209
02:46:07,480 --> 02:46:08,480
It was whack.

3210
02:46:08,480 --> 02:46:09,620
TV Guide.

3211
02:46:09,620 --> 02:46:10,620
I remember.

3212
02:46:10,620 --> 02:46:14,260
I wasn't alive then, but I remember the DVD release of this, where they kind of brought

3213
02:46:14,260 --> 02:46:16,700
it back for a little bit, and I remember reading about it.

3214
02:46:16,700 --> 02:46:18,660
Wait, how are you- oh, okay.

3215
02:46:18,660 --> 02:46:24,500
In the 70s, Pink Flamingos, the cult John Waters movie that's really explicit, right?

3216
02:46:24,500 --> 02:46:27,440
They had a whole smell- no, wait, no, it wasn't Pink Flamingos, it was one of the other John

3217
02:46:27,440 --> 02:46:28,540
Waters movies.

3218
02:46:28,540 --> 02:46:30,400
Was it Polyester?

3219
02:46:30,400 --> 02:46:33,540
One of them had like a Smellovision card, and when the DVD came out, you could actually

3220
02:46:33,540 --> 02:46:36,980
get the Smellovision card, came with it, and you could kind of experience it all over again,

3221
02:46:36,980 --> 02:46:40,400
and that was like John Waters' thing, was it was- and of course, some of them were like

3222
02:46:40,400 --> 02:46:45,880
roses and nice things, and some of them were like poop and offensive things that I would

3223
02:46:45,880 --> 02:46:47,900
advise you don't scratch and sniff.

3224
02:46:47,900 --> 02:46:52,080
But like, that was kind of a fad in the 70s and 80s.

3225
02:46:52,080 --> 02:46:55,380
So anyway, moving on.

3226
02:46:55,380 --> 02:46:57,140
Loki, one more story.

3227
02:46:57,140 --> 02:47:02,620
So hey, Rob, I hope you're happy we finally got a new F-Zero game.

3228
02:47:02,620 --> 02:47:03,620
What?

3229
02:47:03,620 --> 02:47:05,900
Why did we wait till the end of the show to talk about this?

3230
02:47:05,900 --> 02:47:13,420
Because it's actually, it's an unofficial port of F-Zero to the, what was it, the MegaDrive.

3231
02:47:13,420 --> 02:47:15,620
So G-Zero is what it's called now.

3232
02:47:15,620 --> 02:47:16,620
Oh, okay.

3233
02:47:16,620 --> 02:47:21,100
It doesn't have Mode 7, but it looks nice.

3234
02:47:21,100 --> 02:47:22,700
I wonder how that runs.

3235
02:47:22,700 --> 02:47:25,060
It's got to look kind of funky on a Genesis.

3236
02:47:25,060 --> 02:47:26,060
I heard it sounds good though.

3237
02:47:26,060 --> 02:47:31,580
I don't know, they don't have any video of it, but they were saying, you know, this is

3238
02:47:31,580 --> 02:47:35,880
cool, doesn't look bad either, colorful, fits the spirit of the original, and it says this

3239
02:47:35,880 --> 02:47:39,220
is beyond excellent, just the music alone brings tears to my eyes.

3240
02:47:39,220 --> 02:47:41,700
So you know what's kind of cool?

3241
02:47:41,700 --> 02:47:48,900
On the subject of this too, I watched a video of someone that had ported Street Fighter

3242
02:47:48,900 --> 02:47:57,740
2 Turbo Edition to the Virtual Boy, and it actually looked kind of cool.

3243
02:47:57,740 --> 02:48:04,780
So man, Virtual Boy, in some ways that thing was just ahead of its time, right?

3244
02:48:04,780 --> 02:48:05,780
I don't know.

3245
02:48:05,780 --> 02:48:07,780
I think they should try it again.

3246
02:48:07,780 --> 02:48:12,300
All right, well we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username

3247
02:48:12,300 --> 02:48:15,460
on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

3248
02:48:15,460 --> 02:48:19,300
We are the show where every gamer has a voice, so call in and lend yours to the conversation,

3249
02:48:19,300 --> 02:48:22,820
anything we talked about this week, or maybe something that we missed.

3250
02:48:22,820 --> 02:48:24,980
The Skype line is open now.

3251
02:48:24,980 --> 02:48:29,180
Meanwhile, Loki, I don't know if you have any last minute stories, I think we touched

3252
02:48:29,180 --> 02:48:33,860
on, it was kind of a quiet this week, quiet week this week, because last week was kind

3253
02:48:33,860 --> 02:48:37,260
of busy, the week we were gone unfortunately, but we tried to hit on some of the big stuff.

3254
02:48:37,740 --> 02:48:40,020
I don't know if you have any other last minute stories, Loki.

3255
02:48:40,020 --> 02:48:41,540
I don't think so.

3256
02:48:41,540 --> 02:48:42,540
No?

3257
02:48:42,540 --> 02:48:43,540
Yeah.

3258
02:48:43,540 --> 02:48:44,540
No, that's all right.

3259
02:48:44,540 --> 02:48:45,540
It happens.

3260
02:48:45,540 --> 02:48:48,860
We actually are getting some calls coming in, so we can get to the Skype line.

3261
02:48:48,860 --> 02:48:50,060
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

3262
02:48:50,060 --> 02:48:51,060
Who's this?

3263
02:48:51,060 --> 02:48:53,060
Yes, this is Azur Man.

3264
02:48:53,060 --> 02:48:54,060
Hey, what's up?

3265
02:48:54,060 --> 02:48:55,060
Azur Man.

3266
02:48:55,060 --> 02:48:56,060
What's on your mind, buddy?

3267
02:48:56,060 --> 02:48:57,060
Too much.

3268
02:48:57,060 --> 02:48:58,060
Two things.

3269
02:48:58,060 --> 02:49:05,380
You guys were just basically speaking earlier with the program world and the 2DX issues.

3270
02:49:05,380 --> 02:49:09,500
Yes, our special correspondent, YYR, bringing us the info on that.

3271
02:49:09,500 --> 02:49:18,700
Yeah, I kind of play on the East Coast at Chinatown Fair, and we kind of had that issue.

3272
02:49:18,700 --> 02:49:24,260
We had basically the machine for a pendulum for about a few months, and it was kind of

3273
02:49:24,260 --> 02:49:30,300
a big damper when everything was going down, but what I basically wanted to talk about

3274
02:49:30,300 --> 02:49:41,940
was that radio shows like this and other communities like Bimani style kind of keeps

3275
02:49:41,940 --> 02:49:48,780
people like me who like 2DX playing games like that and keeping ... I'm sorry, I'm trying

3276
02:49:48,780 --> 02:49:49,780
to get my thoughts together.

3277
02:49:49,780 --> 02:49:59,820
What I'm trying to say is that Konami really knew about this whole issue with the people

3278
02:49:59,820 --> 02:50:05,300
in America playing the game, but it seems that you might be right that round one might

3279
02:50:05,300 --> 02:50:10,860
want to try to have some sort of monopoly over it and maybe bring it over here, but

3280
02:50:10,860 --> 02:50:16,180
it's kind of depressing to kind of find out like you can't play it at all in the store

3281
02:50:16,180 --> 02:50:17,180
anymore.

3282
02:50:17,180 --> 02:50:19,340
Yeah, and you know what?

3283
02:50:19,340 --> 02:50:24,940
You bring a very difficult but logical point up that people have to consider whether they

3284
02:50:24,940 --> 02:50:31,020
want to hear it or not, and that is that Konami turned a blind eye to this for a very,

3285
02:50:31,020 --> 02:50:32,580
very long time.

3286
02:50:32,580 --> 02:50:36,780
I mean, even back when we talked about nothing but DDR, I mean, think about it.

3287
02:50:36,780 --> 02:50:41,580
DDR Extreme Machines weren't even supposed to be here in the US, and everybody had them

3288
02:50:41,580 --> 02:50:47,700
anyway, so Konami's turned a very blind eye to this for a very long time, and so for it

3289
02:50:47,700 --> 02:50:52,780
just now to have the rug pulled out kind of stings a little bit for a lot of people, I

3290
02:50:52,780 --> 02:50:53,780
get.

3291
02:50:53,780 --> 02:50:56,220
But on the other hand, I can also see why.

3292
02:50:56,220 --> 02:51:00,060
I don't want to villainize round one in this either because I could also see it from their

3293
02:51:00,060 --> 02:51:04,380
perspective where if round one is like, hey, if we're going to play by the rules, then

3294
02:51:04,380 --> 02:51:06,700
everyone else needs to play by the rules.

3295
02:51:06,700 --> 02:51:11,180
What I would love to see happen in this scenario, I think, I think, you know, what kind of has

3296
02:51:11,180 --> 02:51:15,780
to happen in some ways or else somebody's going to get pissed off is that we really

3297
02:51:15,780 --> 02:51:21,580
need to start tearing down these arbitrary region walls.

3298
02:51:21,580 --> 02:51:25,520
And we've been bitching about this on the 3DS and PlayStation and so forth about region

3299
02:51:25,520 --> 02:51:28,100
locking for the longest time, have we not?

3300
02:51:28,100 --> 02:51:31,020
And isn't this whole thing that we're talking about, isn't this just another form of region

3301
02:51:31,020 --> 02:51:32,020
locking?

3302
02:51:32,020 --> 02:51:36,200
I mean, isn't it time that Konami, I mean, and if the reason, if the real reason they

3303
02:51:36,200 --> 02:51:40,540
shut it all down was to launch E-Amusement Global and now great, everybody can have the

3304
02:51:40,540 --> 02:51:46,540
latest 2DX and everybody can play by the rules, then I think that is, in my opinion,

3305
02:51:46,540 --> 02:51:47,540
a happy ending.

3306
02:51:47,540 --> 02:51:51,140
Although some people may not like the fact that they have to do the 30% of the proceeds

3307
02:51:51,140 --> 02:51:54,900
and it may make it a little tougher for private owners.

3308
02:51:54,900 --> 02:51:59,580
I'm not sure I see a scenario where they can really win, but I think at least all the arcades

3309
02:51:59,580 --> 02:52:01,700
that want to run the machines can do that.

3310
02:52:01,700 --> 02:52:02,700
Yeah.

3311
02:52:02,700 --> 02:52:04,820
I mean, that's one of the issues.

3312
02:52:04,820 --> 02:52:10,860
I mean, it's really hard to get people outside of this small community to play, and I say

3313
02:52:10,860 --> 02:52:15,700
small because compared to the people who play other games like the Street Fighter community,

3314
02:52:15,700 --> 02:52:20,700
the Konami, Bimani's community is rather small.

3315
02:52:20,700 --> 02:52:24,540
And it makes it very difficult for them to kind of like come out with a system, like

3316
02:52:24,540 --> 02:52:26,380
I'm an arcade and played here.

3317
02:52:26,380 --> 02:52:32,100
I had a few friends who had their own arcades and they kind of brought them to big, like

3318
02:52:32,100 --> 02:52:34,900
flea markets and stuff to kind of like have people play.

3319
02:52:34,900 --> 02:52:37,860
And even though it wasn't, they were losing money on it, it wasn't making any money.

3320
02:52:37,860 --> 02:52:42,320
They still tried to keep up with the latest, you know, because the hardware wasn't really

3321
02:52:42,320 --> 02:52:43,320
the problem.

3322
02:52:43,320 --> 02:52:50,940
Once they bought the cabinet, buying the upgrades every single from overseas was rather cheap.

3323
02:52:50,940 --> 02:52:58,300
It was this new network, the EMU's network, where you can't basically play the latest

3324
02:52:58,300 --> 02:53:03,540
mixes without being connected to it, really makes it very difficult for them to keep up

3325
02:53:03,540 --> 02:53:04,540
with it.

3326
02:53:04,540 --> 02:53:07,580
And like, you know, I'm a big fan of all the Bimani music.

3327
02:53:07,580 --> 02:53:11,060
It kind of draws in, we even, I don't know if you're familiar with, we had something

3328
02:53:11,060 --> 02:53:14,220
over here called Ballmani.

3329
02:53:14,220 --> 02:53:20,980
There was actually one of the vendors here in, I think in Massachusetts, Ashley was able

3330
02:53:20,980 --> 02:53:28,140
to get Konami to send over Course K. And he also, he was one of the like DJs for a lot

3331
02:53:28,140 --> 02:53:29,140
of Bimani music.

3332
02:53:29,140 --> 02:53:37,100
He does Hippin' Above, he did, what do you call it again, Rising to the Sky, Rising in

3333
02:53:37,100 --> 02:53:38,600
the Sun.

3334
02:53:38,600 --> 02:53:41,980
And he was actually, he came here, he played a few of his mixes.

3335
02:53:41,980 --> 02:53:43,460
I took a few pictures with him.

3336
02:53:43,460 --> 02:53:45,020
He was really cool.

3337
02:53:45,020 --> 02:53:49,260
And they were trying to like see how people were, you know, they didn't like two years

3338
02:53:49,260 --> 02:53:50,260
of that.

3339
02:53:50,260 --> 02:53:52,540
The other year, I think, REU was supposed to come.

3340
02:53:52,540 --> 02:53:55,820
And it was really cool because they were trying to like see if, you know, if America would

3341
02:53:55,820 --> 02:53:57,940
like it, even though it was a very small group.

3342
02:53:57,940 --> 02:54:01,780
But after that, it kind of just fell apart and we didn't see much about that after that.

3343
02:54:01,780 --> 02:54:05,180
I think the store closed down and somebody else took over the store.

3344
02:54:05,180 --> 02:54:11,820
But you know, out of those 10 years, it was a big part of my like gaming, you know, life.

3345
02:54:11,820 --> 02:54:15,540
I mean, it was either that and Final Fantasy XI, you know, back and forth.

3346
02:54:15,540 --> 02:54:19,100
So this show wouldn't exist without that community.

3347
02:54:19,100 --> 02:54:20,100
It really wouldn't.

3348
02:54:20,100 --> 02:54:24,660
So, I mean, it pains us all to kind of see that Konami doesn't really want anything to

3349
02:54:24,660 --> 02:54:25,660
do with it.

3350
02:54:25,660 --> 02:54:30,700
But at the same time, you know, some of their games were a little half-assed.

3351
02:54:30,700 --> 02:54:32,780
Some of them were very half-assed.

3352
02:54:32,780 --> 02:54:37,140
That pop and music abhoration that is on the Xbox 360, whatever that thing was called,

3353
02:54:37,140 --> 02:54:39,020
Beat and Groovy, that is an insult.

3354
02:54:39,020 --> 02:54:40,020
You know what I mean?

3355
02:54:40,020 --> 02:54:41,020
Yeah, exactly.

3356
02:54:41,020 --> 02:54:42,020
Isn't it?

3357
02:54:42,020 --> 02:54:43,020
That's the word.

3358
02:54:43,020 --> 02:54:46,220
It is an insult because they even, when they bring it to America, they're catering to like

3359
02:54:46,220 --> 02:54:50,280
new players and they're just trying to make sure that it can make their money back.

3360
02:54:50,280 --> 02:54:54,340
And it's not, I mean, like the game is great with the, you know, the actual music they

3361
02:54:54,340 --> 02:54:55,900
have for it right now.

3362
02:54:55,900 --> 02:55:01,220
Changing it and bringing in people who have nothing to do with the genre just makes it

3363
02:55:01,220 --> 02:55:02,220
very difficult.

3364
02:55:02,220 --> 02:55:04,900
I mean, I didn't even touch DJ Hero just because of that, you know?

3365
02:55:04,900 --> 02:55:06,500
Well, but DJ Hero is worth a look.

3366
02:55:06,500 --> 02:55:07,500
It is a different game.

3367
02:55:07,500 --> 02:55:08,780
But anyway, I understand.

3368
02:55:08,780 --> 02:55:11,920
But that's another game that we're not going to get another one of because people, I guess,

3369
02:55:11,920 --> 02:55:12,920
didn't get it or whatever.

3370
02:55:12,920 --> 02:55:13,920
Anyway, my friend, I'm so sorry.

3371
02:55:13,920 --> 02:55:15,640
I got to let you go so we can get some more calls.

3372
02:55:15,640 --> 02:55:18,060
But thank you for calling in and sharing your voice with us.

3373
02:55:18,060 --> 02:55:19,060
No problem.

3374
02:55:19,060 --> 02:55:20,060
All right.

3375
02:55:20,060 --> 02:55:21,060
Take care, my friend.

3376
02:55:21,060 --> 02:55:22,060
Bye-bye.

3377
02:55:22,060 --> 02:55:23,060
All right.

3378
02:55:23,060 --> 02:55:24,060
We're going to get some more calls here.

3379
02:55:24,060 --> 02:55:27,700
I always find it, don't worry if you get a little nervous when you're on air, you forget

3380
02:55:27,700 --> 02:55:28,700
what you're going to say.

3381
02:55:28,700 --> 02:55:31,500
It happens to me every week.

3382
02:55:31,500 --> 02:55:33,620
I always forget what I'm going to say.

3383
02:55:33,620 --> 02:55:35,300
And that is not helping with age.

3384
02:55:35,300 --> 02:55:39,140
That's going to be the problem when I'm a 50-year-old podcaster is I'll be probably

3385
02:55:39,140 --> 02:55:41,660
suffering from even worse memory loss than I do now.

3386
02:55:41,660 --> 02:55:43,300
Anyway, we do have another call on the line.

3387
02:55:43,300 --> 02:55:44,300
We're going to get to it.

3388
02:55:44,300 --> 02:55:45,300
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

3389
02:55:45,300 --> 02:55:46,300
Who's this?

3390
02:55:46,300 --> 02:55:47,300
Hey, what's up?

3391
02:55:47,300 --> 02:55:48,300
This guy's Judo.

3392
02:55:48,300 --> 02:55:49,300
Hey, guys, Judo.

3393
02:55:49,300 --> 02:55:50,300
How you doing?

3394
02:55:50,300 --> 02:55:51,300
I'm doing good, man.

3395
02:55:51,300 --> 02:55:52,300
How are you?

3396
02:55:52,300 --> 02:55:53,300
I'm good.

3397
02:55:53,400 --> 02:55:54,900
How are you?

3398
02:55:54,900 --> 02:55:55,900
I'm very good.

3399
02:55:55,900 --> 02:55:57,380
How was theovid when you said that you were doing?

3400
02:55:57,380 --> 02:55:58,380
I have a week off.

3401
02:55:58,380 --> 02:56:02,500
I was literally in the air when OLR should have been on and it's always a weird feeling,

3402
02:56:02,500 --> 02:56:05,180
but nice to be back home.

3403
02:56:05,180 --> 02:56:06,180
What's on your mind?

3404
02:56:06,180 --> 02:56:07,180
You need to do a show from the air.

3405
02:56:07,180 --> 02:56:08,180
That'd be cool.

3406
02:56:08,180 --> 02:56:10,140
I don't think many people are doing that.

3407
02:56:10,140 --> 02:56:11,700
Oh, do a show from the air?

3408
02:56:11,700 --> 02:56:12,980
Yeah, I can.

3409
02:56:12,980 --> 02:56:13,980
I'm pretty sure.

3410
02:56:13,980 --> 02:56:15,980
You can dab Wi-Fi up in a plane now.

3411
02:56:15,980 --> 02:56:17,260
I haven't played a phone in years.

3412
02:56:17,260 --> 02:56:18,260
They do, actually.

3413
02:56:18,260 --> 02:56:22,860
I was able to chat on Google Chat with Allen from the air, but I don't know if I could

3414
02:56:22,860 --> 02:56:23,860
do that.

3415
02:56:23,860 --> 02:56:24,860
It's a virtual audio cable, man.

3416
02:56:24,860 --> 02:56:25,860
It does wonders.

3417
02:56:25,860 --> 02:56:26,860
Let me put it this way.

3418
02:56:26,860 --> 02:56:30,020
Anyway, I wanted to tell you about Code Name, what is it?

3419
02:56:30,020 --> 02:56:31,020
Code Name Steam.

3420
02:56:31,020 --> 02:56:32,020
That's a great game.

3421
02:56:32,020 --> 02:56:33,860
You need to pick it up as soon as possible.

3422
02:56:33,860 --> 02:56:34,860
Really?

3423
02:56:34,860 --> 02:56:41,020
I'm hearing very mixed reviews on Code Name Steam, or excuse me, Project Steam.

3424
02:56:41,020 --> 02:56:43,500
What are you enjoying about it?

3425
02:56:43,500 --> 02:56:46,380
Just the fact that at first I didn't think I was going to like it because I'm not a fan

3426
02:56:46,380 --> 02:56:47,380
of steampunk.

3427
02:56:47,380 --> 02:56:50,180
I mean, it pretty much has a lot of elements that I don't like.

3428
02:56:50,180 --> 02:56:51,180
I don't like steampunk.

3429
02:56:51,620 --> 02:56:56,460
I don't like American folk culture or folk tales or whatever.

3430
02:56:56,460 --> 02:56:58,340
I definitely don't like MGM.

3431
02:56:58,340 --> 02:57:03,220
I felt like, looking at that game, I felt like it was like if MGM made a game.

3432
02:57:03,220 --> 02:57:05,060
I just don't like that style.

3433
02:57:05,060 --> 02:57:06,540
I don't like that time period.

3434
02:57:06,540 --> 02:57:07,540
Right.

3435
02:57:07,540 --> 02:57:08,540
Yeah.

3436
02:57:08,540 --> 02:57:09,540
It made me want to puke.

3437
02:57:09,540 --> 02:57:15,260
But I got the game anyway, just because I love when a game is being innovative.

3438
02:57:15,260 --> 02:57:19,300
I also like the developer of the game, so I said, let me try it.

3439
02:57:19,300 --> 02:57:20,300
I turned out liking it.

3440
02:57:20,500 --> 02:57:21,940
I like the art style.

3441
02:57:21,940 --> 02:57:24,260
I like pretty much everything about it.

3442
02:57:24,260 --> 02:57:30,340
I like the fact that you move around the board in a third-person view.

3443
02:57:30,340 --> 02:57:36,460
You can't zoom out and look at what's around you, which I think really helps to make the

3444
02:57:36,460 --> 02:57:39,780
game feel suspenseful.

3445
02:57:39,780 --> 02:57:41,420
You don't know where the aliens are, really.

3446
02:57:41,420 --> 02:57:48,700
You got to sneak around corners and look around, and I find that fun.

3447
02:57:48,700 --> 02:57:52,140
So it's the fun factor more than anything else for you, even though the story you're

3448
02:57:52,140 --> 02:57:54,340
kind of a little bit on.

3449
02:57:54,340 --> 02:57:56,820
That's interesting you say that, because I thought the battle system was one of the things

3450
02:57:56,820 --> 02:57:58,940
that people were really resonant on.

3451
02:57:58,940 --> 02:57:59,940
Yeah.

3452
02:57:59,940 --> 02:58:02,060
Well, I like the battle system.

3453
02:58:02,060 --> 02:58:06,140
I think I know why people don't like the battle system, and that's just because it's a new

3454
02:58:06,140 --> 02:58:08,380
system and it just takes getting used to.

3455
02:58:08,380 --> 02:58:12,940
But once you find your groove, once you really get into it, you can do a lot of cool stuff

3456
02:58:12,940 --> 02:58:14,180
with the battle system.

3457
02:58:14,180 --> 02:58:18,740
I think you can do stuff that the game doesn't even intend for you to do.

3458
02:58:18,740 --> 02:58:20,420
Real quickly, I was playing one game.

3459
02:58:20,420 --> 02:58:22,420
Right now, I'm not that far in the game.

3460
02:58:22,420 --> 02:58:24,460
I'm still at the part where I'm only using two characters.

3461
02:58:24,460 --> 02:58:29,900
I'm using John Henry and whoever the heck the main character is.

3462
02:58:29,900 --> 02:58:35,600
There was a part where John Henry, he has this grenade launcher gun, and my other teammate,

3463
02:58:35,600 --> 02:58:36,600
he was in trouble.

3464
02:58:36,600 --> 02:58:37,600
There was an alien next to him.

3465
02:58:37,600 --> 02:58:43,020
I didn't have any steam to move, and pretty much if I stayed there, he was going to die.

3466
02:58:43,020 --> 02:58:48,860
I didn't intend for this to happen, but I tried to shoot the alien with my grenade launcher,

3467
02:58:48,860 --> 02:58:52,940
and I hit the guy and he went flying, which put him in another position away from the

3468
02:58:52,940 --> 02:58:55,960
alien, which was a complete accident.

3469
02:58:55,960 --> 02:58:59,280
It wasn't something intended to happen in the game.

3470
02:58:59,280 --> 02:59:02,620
You know, I gotta say, I'm curious about this game.

3471
02:59:02,620 --> 02:59:05,300
I want to check it out, but I'm just like, ah, there's so much going on.

3472
02:59:05,300 --> 02:59:07,780
Maybe I'll wait for a sale, if there ever will be one.

3473
02:59:07,780 --> 02:59:09,700
Nintendo doesn't do sales very often.

3474
02:59:09,700 --> 02:59:10,700
We'll see though.

3475
02:59:10,860 --> 02:59:14,820
With a game like that, I think you want to get it as soon as possible, because it may

3476
02:59:14,820 --> 02:59:16,820
not be around too long.

3477
02:59:16,820 --> 02:59:21,860
It'll still be on the eShop store, but you actually want a physical copy of this game,

3478
02:59:21,860 --> 02:59:27,620
because you want to be out there saying, hey, I own a copy of this game when it disappears.

3479
02:59:27,620 --> 02:59:33,060
I'm pretty sure it's not going to do that well, just based off of what you've been using.

3480
02:59:33,060 --> 02:59:36,420
Kaijuto, I will give you this, if nothing else.

3481
02:59:36,420 --> 02:59:39,300
You were absolutely right on Fantasy Life.

3482
02:59:39,300 --> 02:59:44,980
I am leaning towards, trust this man, because you were right last time.

3483
02:59:44,980 --> 02:59:48,060
Actually, Kaijuto, you're two for two.

3484
02:59:48,060 --> 02:59:53,060
I didn't even talk about this at all, but with all the traveling I was doing this week,

3485
02:59:53,060 --> 02:59:55,740
I was in need for a mobile phone game, right?

3486
02:59:55,740 --> 02:59:58,260
I've been playing the crap out of King of Thieves.

3487
02:59:58,260 --> 02:59:59,260
You were right on that.

3488
02:59:59,260 --> 03:00:01,180
That game is fun.

3489
03:00:01,180 --> 03:00:04,740
I even finally got first place in the wooden cup or whatever it is, so I could get into

3490
03:00:04,740 --> 03:00:09,380
the next cup, and I get really pissed off when people raid my dungeons, and yeah, you

3491
03:00:09,380 --> 03:00:10,380
were right.

3492
03:00:10,380 --> 03:00:12,620
You know what, Kaijuto?

3493
03:00:12,620 --> 03:00:14,460
You have a good batting record right now, so maybe.

3494
03:00:14,460 --> 03:00:19,020
Yeah, but both of those games, I'm going to hang up in two seconds.

3495
03:00:19,020 --> 03:00:24,380
Both of those games, Codename Steam and King of Thieves, they have a great game mechanic

3496
03:00:24,380 --> 03:00:30,700
that I hope, even if the games don't last, I hope that type of game mechanic can last

3497
03:00:30,700 --> 03:00:31,700
through other games.

3498
03:00:31,700 --> 03:00:35,060
I know there's a ton of games that are like King of Thieves, that will compare it to Clash

3499
03:00:35,060 --> 03:00:40,820
of Clans and other stuff, but I would love to see something like King of Thieves, a hacking

3500
03:00:40,820 --> 03:00:45,020
game where instead of you breaking into people's dungeons, you're hacking people's systems,

3501
03:00:45,020 --> 03:00:47,260
and you get in there and stuff.

3502
03:00:47,260 --> 03:00:51,860
Whenever I do a run, I feel like I'm doing a hack run when I'm playing that game.

3503
03:00:51,860 --> 03:00:57,060
I always try to size up the level like, okay, can I do this, or am I just asking for disaster?

3504
03:00:57,060 --> 03:01:00,660
I'm always blown away by what people had to, because you have to beat the level yourself

3505
03:01:00,660 --> 03:01:03,380
or you can't have it as your fortress, so anyway.

3506
03:01:03,380 --> 03:01:05,980
OLR has a Facebook, right?

3507
03:01:05,980 --> 03:01:06,980
It sure does.

3508
03:01:06,980 --> 03:01:09,980
Yeah, did you connect your game to the OLR?

3509
03:01:09,980 --> 03:01:13,060
Because if you did, you can always send me out to steal your stuff back.

3510
03:01:13,060 --> 03:01:14,060
It's on my-

3511
03:01:14,060 --> 03:01:15,260
I can connect you on Facebook.

3512
03:01:15,260 --> 03:01:18,260
It's on my personal Facebook, because OLR is a group Facebook.

3513
03:01:18,260 --> 03:01:19,260
You can switch it out, though.

3514
03:01:19,260 --> 03:01:20,660
You can actually use multiple Facebooks.

3515
03:01:20,660 --> 03:01:21,660
Oh, okay.

3516
03:01:21,660 --> 03:01:22,660
I'll check that out.

3517
03:01:22,660 --> 03:01:23,660
All right, my friend.

3518
03:01:23,660 --> 03:01:24,660
All right, thank you.

3519
03:01:24,660 --> 03:01:26,540
All right, Melinda, let you go, but thanks for the recommendation.

3520
03:01:26,540 --> 03:01:27,540
Take care.

3521
03:01:27,540 --> 03:01:32,220
All right, Kaijuto, who I must admit has a very good batting record when it comes to

3522
03:01:32,220 --> 03:01:34,580
games, with that recommendation there.

3523
03:01:34,580 --> 03:01:36,500
We'll try to squeeze in one more quick call.

3524
03:01:36,500 --> 03:01:37,500
I know we're going very late.

3525
03:01:37,500 --> 03:01:38,500
You okay, Loki?

3526
03:01:38,500 --> 03:01:39,500
Still, or-

3527
03:01:39,500 --> 03:01:40,500
Yeah, I fixed my problem.

3528
03:01:40,500 --> 03:01:44,300
Oh, you've been fixing your game, the coding issues that you were having.

3529
03:01:44,300 --> 03:01:47,140
Yeah, it wasn't a coding issue, it was I had a wrong tag on something.

3530
03:01:47,140 --> 03:01:48,140
Bug, excuse me.

3531
03:01:48,140 --> 03:01:49,140
Bug.

3532
03:01:49,140 --> 03:01:51,100
Yes, but I got it fixed, so now I can't jump infinitely.

3533
03:01:51,100 --> 03:01:54,980
Although I will add that for Josh's free play mode, because he thought it was hilarious

3534
03:01:54,980 --> 03:01:55,980
today, so.

3535
03:01:56,420 --> 03:01:57,940
Oh, have you been having the kid testing the game?

3536
03:01:57,940 --> 03:01:59,340
Oh yeah, I played it for 20 minutes today.

3537
03:01:59,340 --> 03:02:01,340
I get a lot of good feedback from that.

3538
03:02:01,340 --> 03:02:02,340
All right, awesome.

3539
03:02:02,340 --> 03:02:06,020
If I don't hear him get super frustrated and whine about it, then I know that I'm doing

3540
03:02:06,020 --> 03:02:07,020
something right.

3541
03:02:07,020 --> 03:02:17,140
All right, well, 1877 game OLR, or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio, and I just

3542
03:02:17,140 --> 03:02:20,700
want to say again, real quick, just recapping some housekeeping tonight, I want to say a

3543
03:02:20,700 --> 03:02:28,060
big welcome to The Geek Card, and Razorbug, Rob Face, and Sil, going to be joining the

3544
03:02:28,060 --> 03:02:31,140
network with their show, Thursdays on the network.

3545
03:02:31,140 --> 03:02:34,980
And for those of you listening live, you'll get to hear the first episode after OLR tonight,

3546
03:02:34,980 --> 03:02:39,380
which I know is very late for some of you, but I also know some of you never go to bed.

3547
03:02:39,380 --> 03:02:42,340
All right, phone is ringing, so let's try to get one more call in here tonight.

3548
03:02:42,340 --> 03:02:43,820
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

3549
03:02:43,820 --> 03:02:45,180
Hey, hey, it's Rama.

3550
03:02:45,180 --> 03:02:47,060
Hey Rama, buddy, how you doing?

3551
03:02:47,060 --> 03:02:49,180
I'm doing good, man.

3552
03:02:49,180 --> 03:02:54,740
It's so weird when I'm not here for a week, I strangely miss you people, but at least

3553
03:02:54,740 --> 03:03:00,380
I had like SSJ100 Matt was out there, and he hit stun, and some of the people that I

3554
03:03:00,380 --> 03:03:04,100
remember back in the day, we were at all games and all that, so it was good to at least see

3555
03:03:04,100 --> 03:03:05,100
some familiar faces.

3556
03:03:05,100 --> 03:03:09,380
Well, we're going to have to round the crew up, we're going to have to do MAGFest 2015,

3557
03:03:09,380 --> 03:03:11,900
we're going to have to get the suite and do it up.

3558
03:03:11,900 --> 03:03:12,900
2016, my friend, but yes.

3559
03:03:12,900 --> 03:03:13,900
That's what I said, 2016.

3560
03:03:13,900 --> 03:03:14,900
Oh, I thought you said 15, my bad.

3561
03:03:14,900 --> 03:03:15,900
Oh, no, no, 2016.

3562
03:03:15,900 --> 03:03:16,900
It's getting late.

3563
03:03:16,900 --> 03:03:25,980
Yeah, no, again, I don't want to say 100% yes, I am coming, because again, money is

3564
03:03:25,980 --> 03:03:30,260
always a thing, and there's things going on in my personal life where I just have to make

3565
03:03:30,260 --> 03:03:32,180
sure everything will be fine.

3566
03:03:32,180 --> 03:03:35,500
I don't want to get too far into that, because I don't like talking about the day life during

3567
03:03:35,500 --> 03:03:39,260
my night life, but as long as everything is cool there, then yeah, I definitely want to

3568
03:03:39,260 --> 03:03:40,260
do MAGFest again.

3569
03:03:40,260 --> 03:03:44,860
Let me put it this way, if I go to any East Coast show at all next year, it'll be MAGFest.

3570
03:03:44,860 --> 03:03:47,980
Oh, yeah, we're going to have a grand old time.

3571
03:03:47,980 --> 03:03:48,980
Yeah.

3572
03:03:48,980 --> 03:03:55,100
All right, now, I was with you about the whole thing with PAX and the press thing.

3573
03:03:55,100 --> 03:04:00,260
Now, before I get into that, I just want to know, why are you hating on bad dudes?

3574
03:04:00,260 --> 03:04:01,260
Come on, man.

3575
03:04:01,260 --> 03:04:02,260
Why?

3576
03:04:02,260 --> 03:04:03,260
Why?

3577
03:04:03,260 --> 03:04:07,260
I just think it's one of those rose-colored glasses games, but to be fair, I don't think

3578
03:04:07,260 --> 03:04:10,460
Loki let me finish my thought, he sometimes cuts me off.

3579
03:04:10,460 --> 03:04:14,660
On the NES, it wasn't very good, but I always thought the arcade version was fun, and I

3580
03:04:14,660 --> 03:04:18,300
did lose a lot of quarters on the arcade version, so to be fair.

3581
03:04:18,300 --> 03:04:23,700
Because I remember back in the day, there were advertisers for bad dudes in EGM and

3582
03:04:23,700 --> 03:04:27,820
other magazines, and what they would do was, they would just take cheap shots at Double

3583
03:04:27,820 --> 03:04:28,820
Dragon.

3584
03:04:28,820 --> 03:04:32,000
They would just basically say that with bad dudes, no matter what version you bought,

3585
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:37,060
it was practically the same to the arcade, whereas Double Dragon, not so much.

3586
03:04:37,060 --> 03:04:39,780
And I was like, that's low, but you know what?

3587
03:04:39,780 --> 03:04:43,580
I think that's the thing people loved about bad dudes, it wasn't even the game, it was

3588
03:04:43,580 --> 03:04:45,100
everything else around the game.

3589
03:04:45,100 --> 03:04:46,100
You know what I mean?

3590
03:04:46,100 --> 03:04:47,100
Yeah.

3591
03:04:47,100 --> 03:04:48,100
But anyway.

3592
03:04:48,100 --> 03:04:49,100
Mm-hmm.

3593
03:04:49,100 --> 03:04:50,100
So you were gonna ask me something about PAX?

3594
03:04:50,100 --> 03:04:53,060
Not actually about PAX, but I agree with you, what you said at the top of the show about

3595
03:04:53,060 --> 03:05:01,340
covering the big shows and trying to get media coverage, because on the end of covering anime

3596
03:05:01,340 --> 03:05:06,820
conventions and so forth, a lot of these constant, we're just going in, taking pictures, and

3597
03:05:06,820 --> 03:05:07,860
that's it.

3598
03:05:07,860 --> 03:05:11,620
We go in, we take pictures, reviews, interviews, the whole nine yards.

3599
03:05:11,660 --> 03:05:19,340
I could pull up my applications for New York Comic-Con, say people that run PAX, duplicate

3600
03:05:19,340 --> 03:05:20,340
everything.

3601
03:05:20,340 --> 03:05:27,060
There is even a section that says, please give a vial of your blood, and I submit it.

3602
03:05:27,060 --> 03:05:30,080
I went with a crew out of the three of us.

3603
03:05:30,080 --> 03:05:36,020
I was the only one that got pressed, and we all sent in practically identical things.

3604
03:05:36,060 --> 03:05:42,140
Meanwhile, I find out later that somebody that I knew whose ratings and all that were

3605
03:05:42,140 --> 03:05:48,140
lower than mine, but he got in because he BS'd his way in because of the number of hits

3606
03:05:48,140 --> 03:05:49,140
and likes on his Facebook.

3607
03:05:49,140 --> 03:05:50,660
I'm just like, you know what?

3608
03:05:50,660 --> 03:05:51,660
Table flip.

3609
03:05:51,660 --> 03:05:55,540
Here's the thing, and I wanna be very clear on this, and I know you understand this, but

3610
03:05:55,540 --> 03:05:59,900
before, because in my head, I'm fearing the tweets and the emails I'm gonna get where

3611
03:05:59,900 --> 03:06:04,700
Rob was just a big baby and threw a fit, and if he wants to get in his media, then maybe

3612
03:06:04,700 --> 03:06:07,660
he should do more or whatever, blah, blah, blah, blah.

3613
03:06:07,660 --> 03:06:11,220
My issue is not the fact that I didn't get in his media.

3614
03:06:11,220 --> 03:06:12,800
That is not my problem.

3615
03:06:12,800 --> 03:06:18,060
My issue is the fact that I did not see those rules enforced consistently.

3616
03:06:18,060 --> 03:06:24,140
I did not know what those rules even really were, and the fact that I couldn't seem to

3617
03:06:24,140 --> 03:06:28,780
talk to anybody about it, and I found the fact that when I'm not getting any responses

3618
03:06:28,780 --> 03:06:32,900
and Bobby's not getting any responses and the other people are, I just kind of find

3619
03:06:32,900 --> 03:06:38,420
that rude, and that's, it's the lack of consistency that's really ticking me off, and the fact

3620
03:06:38,420 --> 03:06:43,180
that we're kind of taking a dump on podcasts when everybody's about YouTube and Twitch

3621
03:06:43,180 --> 03:06:44,180
TV.

3622
03:06:44,180 --> 03:06:45,180
Well, guess what?

3623
03:06:45,180 --> 03:06:50,180
I know of quite a few people that like to listen to podcasts, not just OLR, but podcasts

3624
03:06:50,180 --> 03:06:56,560
during their workday while they do data entry or something that doesn't require them to

3625
03:06:56,560 --> 03:06:57,560
be listening.

3626
03:06:57,560 --> 03:07:00,020
They just need their ears and their fingers or whatever.

3627
03:07:00,020 --> 03:07:02,820
There's still a driving, hello?

3628
03:07:02,820 --> 03:07:07,060
There's still a huge market for all of that with podcasts, and even though I can't show

3629
03:07:07,060 --> 03:07:13,060
game footage, I can talk to people about the hobby they love, and that's what I want to

3630
03:07:13,060 --> 03:07:19,180
do more, and that's what I like to do with the press access is network, network, network,

3631
03:07:19,180 --> 03:07:20,960
and try to get more people on the show.

3632
03:07:20,960 --> 03:07:24,260
Try to ask the questions people really want to know the answers to and not just regurgitate

3633
03:07:24,260 --> 03:07:29,940
the press releases and share those stories and a lot of the positive that happens in

3634
03:07:29,940 --> 03:07:35,580
games because there's so much fucking negativity, and sometimes we need to ask the negative

3635
03:07:35,580 --> 03:07:39,100
questions, like, you know, as we did earlier with EA and Maxis and that whole thing, but

3636
03:07:39,100 --> 03:07:40,100
there's a lot of positive.

3637
03:07:40,100 --> 03:07:41,100
Don't get me started on that.

3638
03:07:41,100 --> 03:07:44,420
Anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to go on a rant, but you got me wrapped up.

3639
03:07:44,420 --> 03:07:49,140
No, it's okay, because not the fact that it's your show, but I agree with you 100%, like,

3640
03:07:49,140 --> 03:07:53,860
I have one person already, he writes my reviews, and, you know, we got people who like to read

3641
03:07:53,860 --> 03:07:59,860
the reviews, but when you sit down in that chair with your friends that covered the convention

3642
03:07:59,980 --> 03:08:04,380
and you just go, you start talking about it, it gets much more entertaining.

3643
03:08:04,380 --> 03:08:11,220
If you ask me personally, reviewing a trade show, convention or whatever, on an audio

3644
03:08:11,220 --> 03:08:17,940
video platform, it gets more people, more people get it, they feel your enthusiasm,

3645
03:08:17,940 --> 03:08:19,580
they feel how you feel.

3646
03:08:19,580 --> 03:08:26,700
I tell people when I go to shows, these conventions, that I do my absolute best with my crew to

3647
03:08:26,700 --> 03:08:28,900
get as much coverage as we can.

3648
03:08:28,940 --> 03:08:33,980
So when we sit down and give you this coverage, we want you to live vicariously through us.

3649
03:08:33,980 --> 03:08:37,580
We want you to feel that, you know what, even though I missed it, I was still glad I was

3650
03:08:37,580 --> 03:08:40,540
kind of able to be there through these people.

3651
03:08:40,540 --> 03:08:42,460
That's what it comes down to.

3652
03:08:42,460 --> 03:08:46,700
That's bringing the voice of geeks and the diversity everywhere.

3653
03:08:46,700 --> 03:08:51,980
Anyhow, sorry, I guess we're all getting on a little bit of a rant right now, but I guess

3654
03:08:51,980 --> 03:08:56,020
that was just kind of a personally frustrating thing, especially having come from, dude,

3655
03:08:56,020 --> 03:09:00,260
we broadcast on the show floor in recent memory to that.

3656
03:09:00,260 --> 03:09:03,940
And I think, and that's why, again, I think it's important, and then I promise I'll stop

3657
03:09:03,940 --> 03:09:04,940
talking about it.

3658
03:09:04,940 --> 03:09:06,180
I think it's just important to get out there.

3659
03:09:06,180 --> 03:09:11,020
I think people have the perception that PAX is still that, oh, hey, it's those guys that

3660
03:09:11,020 --> 03:09:16,020
do that funny comic about games and they put this whole thing on themselves and they really

3661
03:09:16,020 --> 03:09:18,900
have these rules where nobody's treated differently and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

3662
03:09:18,900 --> 03:09:22,220
I'm just telling you guys, that fucking changed five years ago.

3663
03:09:22,220 --> 03:09:27,660
And of course, the bigger people aren't talking about it, but I'm here to tell you it changed

3664
03:09:27,660 --> 03:09:29,500
and it is not that show anymore.

3665
03:09:29,500 --> 03:09:30,500
Yeah.

3666
03:09:30,500 --> 03:09:37,780
And like, you know, when, when there are people who are willingly taking personal days to

3667
03:09:37,780 --> 03:09:43,620
sit at their computer, just to fight for a badge, at that point, I'm like, no, what?

3668
03:09:43,620 --> 03:09:44,620
It's not, no.

3669
03:09:44,620 --> 03:09:50,980
I will start doing the smaller and the mid range conventions because they love and appreciate

3670
03:09:50,980 --> 03:09:56,500
everything, you know, because, well, sorry, I just address something real quick in chat

3671
03:09:56,500 --> 03:09:58,180
because I just, I have to address it.

3672
03:09:58,180 --> 03:10:02,380
Zaku is saying that a VOG needs to get their assets to Delaware to incorporate.

3673
03:10:02,380 --> 03:10:05,020
Once you're an LLC, your media penis will grow tenfold.

3674
03:10:05,020 --> 03:10:11,420
Actually, it's not in Delaware, but a VOG actually is an LLC out of Georgia, which we

3675
03:10:11,420 --> 03:10:14,160
picked, you know, cause obviously Bobby's based there.

3676
03:10:14,160 --> 03:10:20,220
So Georgia, you know, and has a lot of, there's a lot of Atlanta game stuff in that area too.

3677
03:10:20,220 --> 03:10:23,940
So yeah, we actually are an LLC and we have a business license.

3678
03:10:23,940 --> 03:10:28,460
We have all that stuff that I don't necessarily need to talk about on the air, but yeah, yeah,

3679
03:10:28,460 --> 03:10:29,460
we're covered.

3680
03:10:29,460 --> 03:10:30,460
We're, we're legit.

3681
03:10:30,460 --> 03:10:34,460
I'd like to, I'd like to think we're legit, but you know, Zaku's right, but one thing

3682
03:10:34,460 --> 03:10:39,380
I discovered with the big conventions, they're like, okay, how many hits do you have?

3683
03:10:39,380 --> 03:10:40,380
What can you do?

3684
03:10:40,380 --> 03:10:41,380
What can you do?

3685
03:10:41,380 --> 03:10:48,460
And we're like, you know, the sad part is it's coming down to quantity over quality.

3686
03:10:48,460 --> 03:10:50,700
And then, well, and then how do they measure those hits?

3687
03:10:50,700 --> 03:10:55,220
They use things like Alexa, seriously, who has that toolbar still installed?

3688
03:10:55,220 --> 03:10:56,340
What, what?

3689
03:10:56,340 --> 03:11:00,460
And especially like my bread and butter is not necessarily web content.

3690
03:11:00,460 --> 03:11:03,800
So I don't believe that I can be measured in the same way, which is why it's extremely

3691
03:11:03,800 --> 03:11:09,520
frustrating when I see other people that know of no tea, no shade, I'm getting more hits

3692
03:11:09,520 --> 03:11:15,280
than as far as the podcast and the, I have third party stats to prove that that aren't

3693
03:11:15,280 --> 03:11:16,280
having the problem.

3694
03:11:16,280 --> 03:11:17,280
It's just, yeah.

3695
03:11:17,280 --> 03:11:18,280
Yeah.

3696
03:11:18,280 --> 03:11:19,280
Anyway.

3697
03:11:19,280 --> 03:11:20,280
Yeah.

3698
03:11:20,280 --> 03:11:21,280
Cause we had a discussion about this on my Facebook a couple of years ago.

3699
03:11:21,280 --> 03:11:22,480
After this, I'm getting out of here.

3700
03:11:22,480 --> 03:11:25,600
One convention said your Alexa rating had to be at a certain number.

3701
03:11:25,600 --> 03:11:31,840
We're, Bunch was having a pow wow on my Facebook saying an anime, manga field, there's like

3702
03:11:31,840 --> 03:11:35,320
maybe five of the big name sites that will do coverage.

3703
03:11:35,320 --> 03:11:38,540
And then it's all of us little independent guys and we're looking together.

3704
03:11:38,540 --> 03:11:43,360
We come to a realization because that one rule, there's only going to be like five press

3705
03:11:43,360 --> 03:11:49,400
sites at this convention compared to maybe 10, 15, 20 doing complete coverage that will

3706
03:11:49,400 --> 03:11:51,560
do a lot more than what others will get.

3707
03:11:51,560 --> 03:11:55,440
I think, and this is important too, is that, you know, I appreciate all the advice you

3708
03:11:55,440 --> 03:11:58,480
guys are giving in chat and so forth, but you have to realize, and part of the announcements

3709
03:11:58,480 --> 03:12:02,760
Bobby and I, you know, made earlier kind of go in line with this is that we kind of made

3710
03:12:02,760 --> 03:12:08,240
peace with the fact that E3 and PAX don't want us because we were able to sit back and

3711
03:12:08,240 --> 03:12:13,480
ask the question, do we really need them or are we able to accomplish more spending

3712
03:12:13,480 --> 03:12:15,060
our money other places?

3713
03:12:15,060 --> 03:12:20,180
And I think we kind of came to the consensus that, you know what, we really need to focus

3714
03:12:20,180 --> 03:12:22,880
on where people don't seem to be focusing on.

3715
03:12:22,880 --> 03:12:26,440
And that is the small to mid-level cons and that, and there's nothing wrong with being

3716
03:12:26,440 --> 03:12:27,440
small to mid-level.

3717
03:12:27,440 --> 03:12:29,280
Again, I think you can have a lot of fun.

3718
03:12:29,280 --> 03:12:33,700
We'll do our one big con a year dragon con because you know, it's, it's local for our

3719
03:12:33,700 --> 03:12:37,400
co-owner and it's like 20 small cons all happening at once.

3720
03:12:37,400 --> 03:12:39,920
And they actually respond to emails.

3721
03:12:39,920 --> 03:12:43,520
And even though their media rule, I'll, I'll say this, I love dragon con.

3722
03:12:43,520 --> 03:12:44,760
We never get in this media.

3723
03:12:44,760 --> 03:12:46,240
We're probably never going to get in this media.

3724
03:12:46,240 --> 03:12:51,320
Their media rules are extremely stringent, but at least they're consistent and at least

3725
03:12:51,320 --> 03:12:53,440
you can contact them to talk about it.

3726
03:12:53,440 --> 03:12:54,440
Exactly.

3727
03:12:54,440 --> 03:12:55,440
Anyway.

3728
03:12:55,440 --> 03:12:56,440
Big sites cover everything else.

3729
03:12:56,440 --> 03:12:58,520
We cover everything else for the people.

3730
03:12:58,520 --> 03:12:59,520
That's all it is.

3731
03:12:59,520 --> 03:13:00,520
That's right.

3732
03:13:00,520 --> 03:13:01,520
That's right.

3733
03:13:01,520 --> 03:13:04,480
I think if we can bring coverage to some things you otherwise might not know about, then I

3734
03:13:04,480 --> 03:13:05,480
think we've done our job.

3735
03:13:05,480 --> 03:13:06,480
Anyway.

3736
03:13:06,480 --> 03:13:07,480
Uh, Ron, Mike, I gotta let you go.

3737
03:13:07,480 --> 03:13:08,480
My friend.

3738
03:13:08,480 --> 03:13:09,480
Take care of everybody.

3739
03:13:09,480 --> 03:13:10,480
Stay fabulous.

3740
03:13:10,480 --> 03:13:11,480
Bye.

3741
03:13:11,480 --> 03:13:12,480
Anime Jam session.

3742
03:13:12,480 --> 03:13:13,480
Everybody's check that out.

3743
03:13:13,480 --> 03:13:14,480
Uh, Tuesday nights here at the voice geeks network.

3744
03:13:14,480 --> 03:13:17,240
I'm so sorry to those of you guys that didn't get through, uh, we actually should have ended

3745
03:13:17,240 --> 03:13:18,240
a while ago.

3746
03:13:18,240 --> 03:13:20,360
Uh, and here we are still going.

3747
03:13:20,360 --> 03:13:26,440
Um, so, uh, we got to wrap up, um, thank you guys for listening.

3748
03:13:26,440 --> 03:13:29,300
If you have an email for us, participate at orange on twitter.com.

3749
03:13:29,300 --> 03:13:34,920

3750
03:13:34,920 --> 03:13:37,600
guys being here every week and supporting the show.

3751
03:13:37,600 --> 03:13:42,440
We, you know, the, the E3 media and the packs me that that would be cool.

3752
03:13:42,440 --> 03:13:46,160
We'd love to do that, but honestly, you guys being here, that's, that's the, that's the

3753
03:13:46,160 --> 03:13:47,160
real reward.

3754
03:13:47,160 --> 03:13:49,080
And all we ask here, we're not asking for your money.

3755
03:13:49,080 --> 03:13:52,200
I'm not going to direct you to some place to go send us money.

3756
03:13:52,200 --> 03:13:57,480
Uh, but we would appreciate any positive feedback that you would have in spreading the word

3757
03:13:57,480 --> 03:13:58,480
about our show.

3758
03:13:58,480 --> 03:14:01,180
Uh, if you enjoyed what you heard here at orange on radio, please tell a friend or two

3759
03:14:01,180 --> 03:14:02,180
about this show.

3760
03:14:02,180 --> 03:14:03,180
Help spread the word.

3761
03:14:03,500 --> 03:14:08,020
If you really can't think of anybody to tell a five star review on iTunes or, um, a five

3762
03:14:08,020 --> 03:14:11,420
star review on a stitcher, those things go a long way.

3763
03:14:11,420 --> 03:14:17,180
Trust me, uh, in helping, um, helping us get out there and grow our family so that we can

3764
03:14:17,180 --> 03:14:23,500
diversify and have even more voices here at, um, the voice of geeks network and orange

3765
03:14:23,500 --> 03:14:24,500
lounge radio.

3766
03:14:24,500 --> 03:14:25,500
Anyway.

3767
03:14:25,500 --> 03:14:27,300
Um, again, dark soccer.

3768
03:14:27,300 --> 03:14:31,520
I doubt she's listening this week and a totally understandably why, but we are all thinking

3769
03:14:31,520 --> 03:14:36,320
about you dark soccer and looking forward to seeing her again next week.

3770
03:14:36,320 --> 03:14:37,320
Um, Loki.

3771
03:14:37,320 --> 03:14:38,320
Sorry.

3772
03:14:38,320 --> 03:14:39,600
It was late tonight.

3773
03:14:39,600 --> 03:14:40,920
Hopefully the misses will understand.

3774
03:14:40,920 --> 03:14:41,920
Whatever.

3775
03:14:41,920 --> 03:14:42,920
It's fine.

3776
03:14:42,920 --> 03:14:43,920
He'll be all right.

3777
03:14:43,920 --> 03:14:44,920
Thanks for the pizza.

3778
03:14:44,920 --> 03:14:45,920
No problem.

3779
03:14:45,920 --> 03:14:46,920
Good times.

3780
03:14:46,920 --> 03:14:47,920
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

3781
03:14:47,920 --> 03:14:48,920
I forgot.

3782
03:14:48,920 --> 03:14:50,560
The final fantasy type zero is also releasing this week.

3783
03:14:50,560 --> 03:14:51,560
Did you not say that?

3784
03:14:51,560 --> 03:14:52,560
I did.

3785
03:14:52,560 --> 03:14:53,560
Yeah, whatever.

3786
03:14:53,560 --> 03:14:54,560
It's no big deal.

3787
03:14:54,560 --> 03:14:55,560
Little behind the scenes.

3788
03:14:55,560 --> 03:14:59,440
Look since, since I'm spilling all this tea tonight, I ran out of the room when he did

3789
03:14:59,440 --> 03:15:03,680
release dates because I was trying to get Irene and they, they were coming over.

3790
03:15:03,680 --> 03:15:05,400
So yeah, I didn't hear that you'd miss that.

3791
03:15:05,400 --> 03:15:07,560
Otherwise I would have corrected you on that.

3792
03:15:07,560 --> 03:15:08,560
I remembered.

3793
03:15:08,560 --> 03:15:10,200
Now I'm like, that just crept out of nowhere though.

3794
03:15:10,200 --> 03:15:11,200
Didn't it?

3795
03:15:11,200 --> 03:15:12,200
It did.

3796
03:15:12,200 --> 03:15:14,520
And uh, I, I do want to pick it up just because of the demo.

3797
03:15:14,520 --> 03:15:18,400
I mean, I guess final fantasy games are cool too, but I don't know anything about type

3798
03:15:18,400 --> 03:15:19,400
zero at all.

3799
03:15:19,400 --> 03:15:22,760
So, um, it looked pretty cool from what I was looking at on the packs monitors.

3800
03:15:22,760 --> 03:15:27,920
Uh, and then again, that's, that game has also been around since, uh, PSP granted it

3801
03:15:27,920 --> 03:15:28,920
was in Japan.

3802
03:15:28,920 --> 03:15:31,480
But I'm looking forward to playing it here for the first time.

3803
03:15:31,480 --> 03:15:34,600
So, uh, and of course that final fantasy 15 demo.

3804
03:15:34,600 --> 03:15:35,600
Yes.

3805
03:15:35,600 --> 03:15:36,600
All right.

3806
03:15:36,600 --> 03:15:39,600
Uh, my final thought tonight is, um, I'm going to say the same thing.

3807
03:15:39,600 --> 03:15:43,040
I'm, I'm very much looking forward to type zero, but I'm going to really try to play

3808
03:15:43,040 --> 03:15:47,480
some more games that aren't Diablo and final fantasy 14 this week, but I'm going to play

3809
03:15:47,480 --> 03:15:49,360
a lot of those too.

3810
03:15:49,360 --> 03:15:50,360
What can I say?

3811
03:15:50,360 --> 03:15:51,760
I love playing video games.

3812
03:15:51,760 --> 03:15:53,800
I know you guys all do too.

3813
03:15:53,800 --> 03:15:56,520
Thank you so much for being here and making it a great show tonight.

3814
03:15:56,520 --> 03:15:58,480
We'll be back in seven days to do it all again.

3815
03:15:58,480 --> 03:15:59,480
Have a good night.

3816
03:15:59,480 --> 03:16:03,320
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.

3817
03:16:03,320 --> 03:16:09,800
Orange lounge radio is a production of OLR studios to join us for a live show tune into
