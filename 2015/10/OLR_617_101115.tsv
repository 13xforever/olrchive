7000	13000	Who's the host? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
13000	22000	Tonight October 11th, 2015, it looks like the marketplace of downloadable content may be evolving, from streaming content in Guitar Hero to insurance in Metal Gear Solid.
22000	27000	We discuss these new directions with our participants next, live on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36000	44000	It is Orange Lounge Radio. Tonight with episode number 617 for this October the 11th of 2015.
44000	54000	We are here assembled in Sacramento, California, Studio N7 to talk about the latest and greatest in gaming along with you guys in our chat room.
54000	65000	My name is Rob Roberts, also known as Skie on Twitter, S-K-I-E, and joining me at my side as she often is, except for those times she's not, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
65000	68000	Murgle, Murgle.
68000	72000	What was that, the character in Bravely Default? Oh, I said Murg-er-gerger.
72000	77000	I don't know, I was just thinking of the Murlocs and, wow.
77000	81000	I've been going around just saying that randomly because it sounds funny.
81000	89000	Yeah, it's great. So, before the show we were doing a little bit of snack time, which we usually do.
89000	90000	Oh my god.
90000	96000	It's 6 o'clock on the west coast, right? It's a little bit snack time. It depends on if we decide to eat dinner before or after the show.
96000	103000	Usually Loki is before DarkSakura, or during really, let's be real. DarkSakura and I are after, so we'll have a little snack to hold us over.
103000	108000	And, because I was at Trader Joe's yesterday, not to give them a free plug, but I guess I did.
108000	114000	They have pumpkin everything this time of year. Everything pumpkin this time of year.
114000	119000	And so I had Jamie try, she didn't know what it was, and I said, here Jamie, eat this.
119000	123000	And she's like, okay. And it was a pumpkin flavored tortilla chip.
123000	129000	And the first, the reaction she made when she was eating it was very strange, and I showed her the bag, she's like, give it to me now.
129000	131000	It took like a whole handful.
131000	132000	It was really good.
132000	133000	They are good, aren't they?
133000	140000	Well, I wanted something, it's a little salty, and I like sweet and salty things. I mean, hence me eating up almost all of your kettle corn.
140000	142000	But, it's so good.
142000	143000	Yeah.
143000	146000	Yeah, actdef said sky is so white, he turns orange in October.
146000	147000	It's true.
147000	148000	Yeah, Rob turns into Bob Barker.
148000	149000	That is true.
149000	155000	Acknowledging our chat room, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.
155000	159000	6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
159000	162000	And yeah, actdef saying that I turn orange in October.
162000	169000	You know, true story, my parents had to take me to the hospital when I was two years old because my face turned orange.
169000	170000	How many carrots were you eating?
170000	174000	And that's exactly what it was, it was because my favorite thing to eat when I was a kid was carrots.
174000	178000	And of course, my parents are like, carrots aren't what, letting me eat carrots is better than sugar, right?
178000	180000	Did you know that that happened to Susan Day?
180000	181000	Really?
181000	182000	From the Partridge family?
182000	183000	I did not.
183000	187000	Wasn't she the ginger? Is it a thing about being ginger and eating that? I don't know.
187000	190000	No, she had gone on like some anorexic kick.
190000	191000	Oh.
191000	193000	And was eating nothing but carrots and turned orange.
193000	194000	Wow.
194000	196000	Yeah. How's that for your bit of trivia?
196000	199000	There you go. So maybe that ties into the pumpkin thing, I don't know.
199000	201000	Okay, I need to-
201000	204000	Alan says that you have pumpkin cranberry pita chips.
204000	205000	I do have pumpkin-
205000	207000	And you need to give them to me now.
207000	209000	Alright, well after-
209000	211000	I want it now!
211000	214000	I'm gonna play the cruelest joke ever on Dark Soccer.
214000	219000	They're in that cabinet on the very top shelf just out of reach for you.
220000	223000	Dark Soccer. Oh, this is the one time I wish we had video.
223000	225000	Dark Soccer is getting on her tippy toes and-
225000	228000	Oh my god! What'd you break in there?
233000	238000	Oh my god, I wish you guys could have seen that. She literally jumped to grab the bag of pumpkin-
238000	241000	Never underestimate the resourcefulness of a short person.
242000	243000	Alright.
243000	246000	Listen to this. I'm having the- Rob, I'm stealing your food.
246000	249000	Thanks. Thank you, Alan. Love you. Mean it.
249000	251000	Alright. Look.
251000	256000	Could you guys hear when, like, she just knocked the toaster pan over or something? I don't know. Anyway.
256000	260000	Alright. Also, make sure you're not crinkling the bag near the mic, though.
260000	263000	Okay. Also joining us tonight, of course, say hello-
263000	266000	And he's running in and out of here, too. I got people running around the house crazy.
266000	267000	Sorry.
267000	268000	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
268000	269000	You have a ton of amiibo.
269000	270000	Yes.
270000	275000	A ton of them I had to scan into Mario Maker, so I don't have to unlock the stupid costumes.
275000	279000	So, yes. My amiibo collection has gotten disgusting. It has gotten absolu-
279000	280000	It's a little large.
280000	287000	Now that they're easy to find, or easier, let's say much easier to find, and I mentioned this before,
287000	291000	Shane has that kind of unhealthy obsession right now with searching for toys.
291000	295000	Like, he's helped me in getting all these different amiibo.
295000	300000	So, yeah. Just today, I bought a Charizard and a Pikachu so I could have every Pokemon,
300000	305000	because I have Jigglypuff on order, shipping to a local target, and I'll have every Pokemon.
305000	307000	Well, I've got them all scanned now.
307000	309000	Did you? You scanned them all into Mario Maker?
309000	310000	I scanned them all into Mario Maker.
310000	311000	How many was that?
311000	314000	I don't even know. A lot.
314000	319000	I went from, like, having almost- Well, I had quite a few. I finished, you know, playing the easy mode.
319000	324000	They won't give me any more unlocks, so I have at least 30 there, and then I have to play normal mode now.
324000	329000	But, yeah. That was at least 30 more, probably.
329000	333000	Nice. Yeah, I have a lot of amiibo. I'm a little embarrassed.
333000	338000	And then, of course, I gotta fire up Splatoon to unlock the costumes and that, too.
338000	339000	Oh, there you go.
339000	344000	Wish they would do that with other characters. I mean, like a hat or a t-shirt or something, but no.
344000	346000	It's just that game.
346000	351000	All right. Let's see. We're gonna kick off with a kickoff topic tonight.
351000	355000	I do wanna, again, welcome everybody to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
355000	357000	I'm just reading through some of the comments.
357000	362000	Dark Tetsuya is saying, Rob should rent out his collection for people like me that need them for Mario Maker.
362000	365000	Just bring your Wii U over. Do what Loki's doing.
365000	370000	He doesn't even have the Wii U running, except on the gamepad, because you don't need to for Mario Maker.
370000	373000	So he's just tapping them all on the gamepad. You're welcome.
373000	374000	You know, I actually played more games this week.
374000	377000	Did you? Well, get to gaming weeks very soon. I promise.
377000	378000	I'm just very proud of myself.
378000	380000	For playing a lot of games this week?
380000	381000	For playing other stuff.
381000	382000	I played a lot as well this week.
382000	383000	Outside of the usual.
383000	386000	You're really enjoying those pumpkin cranberry things, aren't you?
386000	389000	I might have to leave and change.
393000	397000	Bobby Blackwolf says, I'm gonna fly to Sacramento and put my Wii U and my carry on.
397000	399000	You should, Bobby. You should.
399000	403000	And I'll let you borrow the collection for free in celebration of your 500th episode.
403000	409000	And that gives me an excuse to let our listeners know, if you weren't already aware of our pal Bobby Blackwolf,
409000	413000	who does the show before us here at VOG, he hit 500 episodes this evening.
413000	415000	That is quite a milestone.
415000	420000	And we've been on a neighboring time slot for, what, like 400 of those episodes?
420000	425000	Easy. So, for a very long time we've been working with Bobby Blackwolf.
425000	427000	And it just wouldn't be Sunday nights without him.
427000	429000	So, congratulations on 500 episodes.
429000	434000	And we'll see how far we're gonna take this block of programming.
434000	437000	Anyhow, let's get to our kickoff topic tonight.
437000	441000	So, shifting topics here. I want to talk about music games.
441000	444000	I want to talk about Rock Band 4 came out this week.
444000	447000	And usually I would get into this in my gaming week.
447000	451000	But I feel like this kind of necessitates a little bit of top of the show discussion.
451000	456000	Because I'm gonna talk about Guitar Hero Live as well and some of the things they're doing with DLC.
456000	458000	If you aren't already aware of it.
458000	464000	So, this is the big year that music games that have been gone for a long time are making their comeback.
464000	467000	And so, like many of you, I've picked up Rock Band 4.
467000	470000	And I picked up Rock Band 4 on the Xbox One.
470000	477000	And the reason why I chose Xbox One is because my disgusting amount of rock band songs were on the Xbox 360.
477000	481000	And Harmonix has been advertising that those songs are going to import over.
481000	484000	They're gonna come over from the 360 to the One.
484000	490000	Well, as to be expected with a lot of launch type situations.
490000	496000	The Xbox One and Xbox 360 transfer situation is a little bit borked right now.
496000	501000	Meaning that when I go into Rock Band 4 and look at the library of songs to purchase.
501000	506000	There's some songs that I've purchased already that show available for free.
506000	508000	But there's others that aren't recognized.
508000	512000	And it can even, there seems to be no rhyme or reason.
512000	516000	Like I was like, is it the oldest stuff I've bought? Or what is coming in and what's not?
516000	521000	And like for example, I bought the Best of No Doubt album when it was available in Rock Band.
521000	525000	And like half the songs will come in and half won't.
525000	530000	And you guys have probably already heard that Rock Band 4 is having issues with...
530000	536000	They do not yet have the export available for Rock Band, Rock Band 2 or Rock Band 3.
536000	539000	Or I'm assuming Lego Rock Band will be a part of that at some point.
539000	541000	Remember that was a thing that had its own soundtrack.
541000	545000	Yeah, I remember just getting that just to download the songs.
545000	549000	These are all songs I was expecting to play on my Xbox One and I can't.
549000	553000	So I have to admit, I'm a little bit disappointed.
553000	557000	I assume that they're rushing to meet some type of deadline, which I get it.
557000	561000	The holidays are coming up, especially with the plastic instruments and everything.
561000	569000	But I do feel like something big was promised to me that motivate my purchase on the Xbox One that hasn't been delivered.
569000	574000	And I have to call Harmonics out on that. That's not really acceptable to me.
574000	579000	And I really hope this situation gets fixed pretty quickly in the coming month or so.
579000	583000	As for the game itself, Rock Band is a phenomenal game.
583000	588000	Rock Band has always been one of the greatest music game franchises.
588000	592000	And is the reason why we have a ton of plastic instruments in our house.
592000	594000	I mean obviously Guitar Hero is a huge part of that too.
594000	599000	But you guys all know Harmonics did Guitar Hero 1 and 2 and then they went on to make Rock Band.
600000	605000	So in many ways, Rock Band is kind of the spiritual successor to the original Guitar Hero games, right?
610000	613000	So I was really excited about Rock Band 4 going into next gen.
613000	616000	Because it's like, okay, this series has been gone for a few years.
616000	620000	Let's see what's going to happen with this game.
620000	624000	Yeah, we were like imagining, oh man, when they bring it back it's going to be something amazing.
624000	628000	Yeah, with the new graphics and everything.
628000	635000	So I have to admit, I'm kind of disappointed that Rock Band 4 is a step backwards for the series.
635000	641000	Rock Band 4 is not a bad game, but it's not as good as Rock Band 3.
641000	644000	It's about the same level as Rock Band 2.
644000	652000	And you would expect that when a game is moving on to a new console like that, that you would not lose a lot of features.
652000	660000	And this isn't just about the keyboard thing, although I truly have a hard time understanding why they couldn't put the keyboards in the game.
660000	670000	I don't understand if they're having the whole compatibility switch thing and the note charts are already in for these songs you supposedly already own.
670000	677000	I'm having a little bit of a hard time understanding that struggle, but I'm going to let the game have a pass on that,
677000	680000	as disappointed as I am personally about the lack of keyboards.
680000	686000	But I'm just talking about customization options blow compared to what was there in 3.
686000	688000	You have very limited customization options.
688000	695000	I think the harmony parts for singing are gone. I think it's just the singular stuff.
695000	699000	It just feels scaled back.
699000	704000	And I have to admit, then it makes me go, is this game kind of a cash-in?
705000	713000	Was this to pay the light bills so that they can finish making Amplitude and some of these other pet projects that they have going on right now?
713000	722000	I'm sorry to be so, I don't know, pointed or cynical gamer in what I'm saying, but this was my honest reaction when I started playing Rock Band 4.
722000	726000	I was like, this really doesn't feel like it was worth a five year wait.
726000	734000	Now, if you've never owned a Rock Band game before, maybe you were 17 when the first series came out.
734000	738000	Now you're in your early 20s and you have the disposable income for it.
738000	745000	Rock Band 4 is a fine first purchase to get into the franchise. There's nothing super wrong with it.
745000	752000	I'm just saying, Rock Band 3 is honestly a better game, with the exception of the fact that whatever these new songs are in 4,
752000	757000	you wouldn't be able to pull into 3, but it's not that big of a loss all things considered.
757000	763000	Bobby Black Wolf is saying that the harmonies are still there, so he doesn't want me to get corrected there.
763000	768000	I made the same assumption but was proven wrong. I apologize, I didn't see that in the whole...
768000	777000	And I think part of that, here's why I kind of made that assumption, is that I think I've been spoiled by Sing Star a little bit.
777000	785000	Because I don't know if you guys know this, Sing Star ditched the microphones completely, and now you can actually do your singing through a cell phone app.
785000	797000	Sing Star is a completely free thing now on PlayStation. You download the shell, you download the app to your phone, and you just pay for whatever songs you want to have.
797000	804000	And I just kind of thought, after a five or six year wait, I kind of thought Rock Band would kind of get on that as well.
804000	808000	Remember, they tried that with the PSP version. They had the free demo version that you could download.
808000	816000	That's right. And that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the cell phone microphone and the fact that you don't even need one anymore.
816000	820000	And then that way, how easy would it be to have three people on their smartphones?
820000	830000	I mean, just last week on the show, we had Jackbox on, and they've made this their thing, is creating these games that many people play with their smartphones.
830000	838000	And that's kind of where things are going now, is that interaction. I was surprised that in that sense, the technology didn't take a step forward in Rock Band.
838000	840000	So, I don't know.
840000	846000	ActDeft in chat says, Sky, they should be available for free, even if they appear not bought.
846000	852000	I tried selecting a few of them, and it still wanted me to purchase them. So, I don't, you know.
852000	864000	And plus, the whole thing is a little clunky. Especially if being able to import your old songs was a selling point of the game, shouldn't there be a section of the store that's just view purchased items?
864000	871000	Is that really hard? Why did we have to not have that in there? I don't understand.
871000	880000	Again, I know I sound like I'm being really, really critical of Rock Band, but just as somebody who is expecting to be blown away, I wasn't.
880000	887000	I was just like, oh, this is a very status quo game. In fact, it's actually a little bit of a step backwards from Rock Band 3.
887000	898000	So, sorry, that's just kind of how I felt. But, you know, again, if you've never owned a Rock Band game, there's nothing wrong with starting with Rock Band 4, especially if you happen to have an Xbox One or PlayStation 4.
898000	908000	But don't buy a console just for the game. Buy a console because there's many other great games to play as well, and Rock Band will be one of those games.
909000	917000	Kaijuto in chat says, why sorry for how you feel? I don't know because sometimes I don't like to be that cynical gamer that's kind of hating on things.
917000	924000	I want to make sure it's understood that when I'm critical, especially music games, I have a soft spot for music games.
924000	935000	I think because this show started with DDR and the music-based games, maybe I feel some sort of loyalty to music games or what have you.
935000	944000	So, you know, when I am critical of a game, I almost kind of feel bad because I want to see music games succeed and I want to see them be successful.
944000	950000	So it's a little frustrating to me when Rock Band takes a step backwards because I go, this is going to kill the franchise.
950000	955000	Surely I can't be the only one that's noticing this about the game. This is going to kill the franchise for good.
955000	959000	And this is very disappointing because you want to see it do better. So I don't know.
959000	967000	That's kind of why I apologize a little bit because I don't want to say negative things about it because I want the series to do well, but that's what it is.
967000	976000	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, same here about the music game loyalty. That's why whenever there's like a new 2DX on test, I make sure you guys all know about it.
976000	982000	One other thing I want to talk about in our kickoff topic tonight was the DLC in Guitar Hero.
982000	987000	I don't know if you guys have heard about this. Guitar Hero is doing something a little different with their DLC.
987000	995000	Guitar Hero, you've heard about these streaming channels, right? That you're going to be able to like, it's like playing Guitar Hero to MTV.
995000	1007000	Well, you can play that all fine and dandy, but there will be a currency that you earn as you play through these streaming channels and you can use that currency to play songs on demand.
1007000	1015000	But you're never actually purchasing the song, you're just purchasing it on demand to play whatever song it is you want.
1015000	1019000	This is very similar to how some mobile-based music games work.
1019000	1026000	Now, this means you're not downloading the song and owning it on your console anymore. That's not happening.
1026000	1035000	So, you know, and that's a little weird at first when we talk about DLC. It's like, shouldn't I own everything that I'm kind of paying the money for?
1035000	1042000	But then I think about, how many songs in Rock Band did I buy to just play one or two times and I never went back and played them again?
1042000	1048000	And I think you guys have all done this at some point, right? So, in a way, I'm kind of like, well, maybe the token thing makes sense.
1048000	1058000	And they talked about in the open letter about how, you know, it's, well, you know, we get a lot of our music through Spotify and Apple Music now, so we wanted to try something that seemed a little more subscription-based.
1058000	1065000	And I guess there's like a party pack thing you can buy, where like for 48 hours or something, you basically have unlimited access to the on-demand.
1065000	1070000	So if you're going to have people come over, you can basically just own every song in the game for a certain amount of time.
1070000	1076000	I have to admit, I don't want to like this idea, but I'm kind of open to it to see how it works.
1076000	1083000	You know, again, the way we hear about things isn't always the way it plays out, as I just described with the Rock Band music and importing.
1083000	1089000	But if it's going to work on, you know, in practice the way they're describing it, I'm open to it. I don't know.
1089000	1096000	But I know it's controversial, because Kaijuto in chat says, over at live.vognetwork.com, fuck that idea, I don't like it.
1096000	1102000	And I don't think he's alone in what he's saying with that. What do you guys think about what you're hearing about the Guitar Hero change there? Loki?
1102000	1110000	I don't know. I mean, I like the idea of like the single-player game, but the DLC thing is just... I don't know.
1110000	1115000	I don't know if I'd pay for that, because I'm not really on board with the whole Spotify thing. I mean, I just don't do that.
1115000	1122000	I listen to the music I want to listen to, and that's it. If I want to discover something, I will find other means to do that.
1123000	1126000	So, it just doesn't seem like it would appeal to me.
1128000	1133000	I see, and maybe I'm just different, because I am a Spotify person that I'm open to with the idea.
1133000	1137000	Well, I'd have to see what kind of music is on there. I mean, that's the other thing, too.
1137000	1142000	And here's the thing, though, but I totally understand. This is a very slippery slope.
1142000	1150000	But, with that being said, if they had a DJ Hero game with this, then that would be a different story. I would probably be on board with that.
1150000	1154000	I think I'm actually in complete agreement for once with Mookie.
1154000	1159000	Well, actually, if they just had a DJ Hero game, I'd be totally on board with that.
1159000	1170000	But just don't let the people that touch, you know, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 5, they can't go in the same building with that game.
1170000	1176000	Tigerclaw in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com points out, plus you have to be online to play this music.
1176000	1180000	What if you don't want to be online to play a song? I mean, you have to be online to download it.
1180000	1192000	But I have totally seen that case where you download the songs, then you take your thing to a convention or something where you may not have reliable internet, but you still have all your songs you can play.
1192000	1195000	So that's certainly another downside to this tactic as well.
1195000	1200000	I want to welcome to the show, joining us a little late tonight, he's tardy, but that's okay.
1200000	1204000	Welcome everybody, a friend of the show who comes on quite frequently, say hello to Shane.
1204000	1205000	Hi.
1205000	1206000	Hi.
1206000	1207000	Hi.
1207000	1208000	How are you?
1208000	1209000	Tired.
1209000	1211000	Tired? Did you wake up from a nap and that's why you're late?
1211000	1212000	Like, three hour nap.
1212000	1213000	I got you.
1213000	1214000	Naps are the best.
1214000	1216000	You missed Loki running back and forth.
1216000	1225000	No, I heard about it on the way here. I was like, if I would have known, I would have brought my different amiibo that you don't have, like my Fire Emblem guys and stuff like that.
1225000	1231000	Yeah, I don't have everything that Shane has. He has some extra ones, but we'll get that next time. Sound good? Alright.
1231000	1236000	Shane, what do you think of all that? You're a long time music game fan. What do you think of where Guitar Hero is going with the DLC?
1236000	1242000	If you can liken it to something like Apple Music, then I'm fine with it because I love that service.
1242000	1250000	So, whatever, but again, just to reiterate what's been said here, I just want DJ Hero. I don't care about Guitar Hero.
1250000	1251000	Amen.
1251000	1258000	Very interesting. It seems like we're all united. I would agree. I would be much more excited about a new DJ Hero game than Guitar Hero game.
1258000	1261000	We saw DJ Hero today. Was that today? I think it was.
1261000	1270000	Yeah, it was. It was in the Xbox 360 section of Toys R Us. Because, you know, I'm thinking like, oh, backwards compatibility. Maybe there's some 360 games I want to pick up again.
1270000	1278000	And then I saw DJ Hero and obviously that's not, you know, with the peripheral and everything, I'm not expecting that to be backwards compatible, but I was like, oh, look, Shane.
1278000	1280000	I know, it was sad.
1280000	1287000	I was like, here's a great Xbox 360 game and then I saw Mass Effect 2 and I'm like, here's the best Xbox 360 game. So, anyway.
1287000	1288000	I didn't say anything.
1288000	1289000	You mean PC game.
1289000	1300000	Whatever. Alright, before we get into our gaming weeks, since Shane is here and I don't have any place to talk about this on the show rule otherwise, well, first off, how have you been since the last time we had you on the show, Shane?
1300000	1301000	I've been.
1301000	1306000	You've been, I was talking about this on last week's show. I don't know if you heard it or not, but I was talking about your toy obsession.
1306000	1310000	Yeah, you make it sound like a bad thing. You made it sound like a bad thing today, too.
1310000	1315000	Do you wish to state, would you like to clarify what your thing is?
1315000	1324000	I just like Power Ranger toys and I want to finish this series before the new ones come out in November. I'm three away.
1324000	1326000	And toy collecting is a pretty big thing.
1326000	1328000	Yeah, it's fun. It's like hunting.
1328000	1331000	You said you're always running into Star Wars people.
1331000	1334000	Yeah, but I don't understand what they're doing.
1335000	1340000	No, I'm not saying in a bad way. I just don't understand Star Wars. Like, they wouldn't understand Power Rangers.
1340000	1342000	You don't know the characters they're looking for and all that stuff.
1342000	1343000	No.
1343000	1345000	But it's kind of similar to amiibo hunting, what you're doing, right?
1345000	1350000	Yes, and that's what I fall back on. If I don't find a Power Ranger, well, maybe I'll find an amiibo.
1350000	1357000	Now, I know there's like three characters you're desperately looking for. Do you want to put a shout out here for people to tweet you if they find them?
1357000	1364000	As long as they don't pay, or as long as they're not scalping them for $25 to $30 a pop.
1364000	1366000	Because you don't support scalpers.
1366000	1367000	No, I don't support scalpers.
1367000	1368000	What is it you're looking for?
1368000	1372000	I'm looking for Sting Rage, Spellbinder, and Vivizord.
1372000	1374000	So they're like villains, right?
1374000	1375000	Yeah, they're just villains.
1375000	1376000	Okay.
1376000	1380000	That's it, and then I'm done until November when it all starts up again.
1380000	1383000	But you're going to go to Power Morphicon and probably spend a lot more money, right?
1383000	1385000	Yes. Oh my god, I can't wait for Power Morphicon.
1385000	1386000	Are you excited for the movie?
1386000	1390000	Now I am, since it sounds like it's not a reboot of the original series.
1390000	1392000	William Murderface in chat says,
1392000	1394000	Shane, what do you think about Dino Charge? I know where this is going.
1394000	1397000	Oh my god, it's the best. I love it.
1397000	1401000	I have so many good feelings towards that series.
1401000	1402000	Is it your favorite series?
1402000	1404000	Yes, right now it is.
1404000	1411000	It beats SPD, it's on par with RPM, but I think it's going to surpass RPM because RPM didn't have Riley and Chase.
1411000	1418000	Until you started talking more about your Power Rangers obsession and doing this toy hunting thing,
1418000	1422000	I really never realized that there were all different seasons.
1422000	1425000	I thought they just kept recasting the original Rangers.
1425000	1426000	No, that's terrible.
1426000	1428000	I thought Rita Repulsa was still the villain.
1428000	1429000	No.
1430000	1431000	Rob.
1431000	1433000	I had no idea about any of this stuff.
1433000	1436000	Well, you knew the Japanese series were all individual series, right?
1437000	1440000	I know the Japanese, yeah, it's all from Japan.
1440000	1444000	But they were different series every season. They're from the get-go.
1444000	1445000	I know that now.
1445000	1450000	But also, nothing is better than the Mega Ranger vs. Car Ranger movie.
1450000	1455000	He made me watch the trains from Japan, which they'll probably never have here.
1455000	1458000	I thought it was a cute thing, what I was watching.
1458000	1461000	I can't get obsessed with it like Shane does, but whatever.
1461000	1463000	I also super love Maji Ranger.
1464000	1465000	Okay.
1465000	1466000	That's Harry Potter.
1466000	1467000	AKA Harry Potter Rangers.
1468000	1472000	Alright, I'm gonna entertain one more Power Rangers question here for Shane.
1472000	1473000	Why, let's just talk about this for an hour.
1473000	1475000	What about Time Force, Shane?
1475000	1476000	Shane, we should do a podcast.
1476000	1477000	Time Force is really good.
1477000	1478000	I want to do a podcast.
1478000	1480000	Let's do one about Power Rangers.
1480000	1485000	But Time Force is really good. Time Rangers even better.
1485000	1490000	But again, Riley and Chase aren't on that season, so I don't know what to tell you.
1490000	1493000	Alright, another thing you've been obsessed with as of late.
1493000	1497000	You want to talk about a particular PlayStation 4 game that you are in love with, right Shane?
1497000	1499000	Is it not on the show roll?
1499000	1500000	No, I forgot to put it on there.
1500000	1501000	We'll put it on there so I don't...
1501000	1502000	Oh, here it is.
1502000	1503000	We're talking about it right on top of the show.
1503000	1505000	Oh my gosh, but it had a story.
1505000	1506000	I know.
1506000	1508000	What game do you love on PlayStation 4?
1508000	1509000	Until Dawn.
1509000	1510000	Yeah?
1510000	1511000	It's the best.
1511000	1512000	It's gonna be my number one.
1512000	1515000	It beat out... everybody's gone to the rapture.
1515000	1516000	Until Dawn.
1516000	1519000	Like, I watched so many Twitch streams of it.
1519000	1521000	I just... I love that game.
1521000	1523000	What is it about the game that you love?
1523000	1529000	It's like a choose your own adventure book, but with killing and monsters.
1529000	1532000	And sometimes there may be a hook that goes through your jaw.
1532000	1534000	Or maybe your eyes get gouged out.
1534000	1535000	That's why I can't play it.
1535000	1537000	It's so good.
1537000	1541000	And now that there's gonna be a second one, I'm even more excited.
1541000	1543000	Well, and that is the news, is that...
1543000	1546000	Well, they didn't confirm a second one is happening.
1546000	1549000	It sold better than expectations, which I'm sure they expected four copies.
1549000	1552000	They said this week it sold better than expectations.
1552000	1557000	And even, you know, Yoshida had said a few months, or a couple weeks ago, I think it was,
1557000	1561000	that he said that, you know, they didn't really advertise it a lot and it's been selling well.
1561000	1562000	No, they didn't.
1562000	1569000	And so, over at the developers, they're talking about what they could do for a sequel.
1569000	1575000	I mean, if they can make it canon that everybody lives, and I mean everybody without spoiling it,
1575000	1580000	you could easily set it up for a sequel with a couple of the same characters, at least.
1580000	1583000	Well, could they do something, though, where it's just, you know,
1583000	1586000	and again, I'm trying to be very delicate with spoilers here,
1586000	1590000	so could they take the mythology of the game, we'll just say that,
1590000	1592000	and maybe with a new cast?
1592000	1596000	I don't think that would be as good, because, I mean, well, technically,
1596000	1601000	I don't even, I guess, want a real sequel, because the payoff for the game,
1601000	1607000	besides it being just amazing overall, is finding out, like, the big twist about what's going on,
1607000	1612000	and so you're going into the game with a new cast where they don't know what's going on,
1612000	1615000	but you would already know at the start what's going on, so that's not as fun.
1615000	1619000	Well, with horror movies, though, the cast rarely come back for the sequel.
1619000	1623000	I mean, you might have one or two, like, you know, Jamie Lee Curtis was in the first couple Halloween movies.
1623000	1627000	Besides, they had to have a survivor that ends up becoming the new villain, or so.
1627000	1628000	Yeah.
1628000	1630000	I won't say anything about that.
1630000	1632000	I mean, it's just a trope.
1632000	1633000	All right.
1633000	1635000	Well, let's talk more about Power Rangers.
1635000	1638000	Well, I will say, William Murderface in chat is saying,
1638000	1644000	I would totally be up for a Sentai Power Rangers podcast, even add in Common Rider, which is also wrapped.
1644000	1649000	Yes, they just started a new one, and I started watching it, and it's pretty...
1649000	1654000	I don't know, it's only been one episode that I've seen so far, and I don't know how I feel about it,
1654000	1658000	but I'm going to start it from the start and finish it, because it's a neat motif.
1658000	1662000	All right. Well, if people want to tweet you support to start a Power Rangers podcast,
1662000	1666000	which, you know, just saying, would actually be a pretty cool addition to VOG, wink, wink,
1666000	1669000	tweet Shane at Shane Alinko.
1669000	1675000	You know, but I have to warn you, it's mostly going to be me talking about Chase and Riley and how much I love that.
1675000	1678000	There's probably people that would be just fine with that, to be honest.
1678000	1679000	Yeah, there would be.
1679000	1680000	All right.
1680000	1681000	All right.
1681000	1685000	And Dark Soccer maybe wants to get in on that podcast as well.
1685000	1689000	I'd have to catch up on stuff, because honestly, my favorite ever is Mega Ranger.
1689000	1690000	Yeah.
1690000	1692000	And there will be nothing better than Mega Ranger.
1692000	1696000	Well, maybe, okay, just to help you see, this is what I do. I produce shows, right?
1696000	1698000	Is this your hero's power?
1698000	1703000	Yes, maybe a little bit. I would love that. If my power were to get people to start podcasts, I would love that.
1703000	1707000	Here's the thing. What you could do is you could go back through Power Rangers episodes,
1707000	1711000	and you're like the expert. You know them inside out. She likes Power Rangers, but she hasn't seen them.
1711000	1720000	So it could be like you guys having just watched an episode together, talking about seeing it for the first time and seeing it, you know, like, like a veteran.
1720000	1725000	Yeah, there's a lot of things I could say about that, but I won't discuss plans like that.
1725000	1728000	All right. You don't want to have a meeting live on air. That's fine.
1728000	1732000	No, unless we're just talking about Power Rangers in general.
1732000	1737000	Well, back to Until Dawn real quick, not to be all like back and forth, but you mentioned you watch a lot of Twitch streams.
1737000	1738000	Yes.
1738000	1743000	And you know, you've, you've actually kind of like become a fan of some streamers through that.
1743000	1748000	What is it about the Until Dawn streams that are really appealing to you?
1748000	1753000	I don't even think it's necessarily the streamers themselves. So some are like really personable and awesome.
1753000	1758000	But with Until Dawn, I like seeing the different choices people made versus what I did.
1758000	1759000	I had a feeling.
1759000	1767000	And I also like seeing, well, it kind of goes hand in hand. Like there are a lot of ways you can die in that game I didn't think you could, and it's pretty funny.
1767000	1775000	Do you think that Until Dawn's success is going to cause in two years time to be a lot of choose your own adventure type games?
1775000	1776000	No.
1776000	1777000	Like we're going to see more games like this?
1777000	1778000	No, I don't think so.
1778000	1779000	You don't think so?
1779000	1788000	Because I don't think it's that successful, but I think for a game that had no marketing and clearly they just didn't really end up caring about in the end that it's successful in that regard.
1788000	1790000	All right. Fair enough.
1790000	1794000	Okay. Well, on that note, let's get into our gaming weeks.
1794000	1799000	We, after our kickoff topic, like to talk about what we have been playing this week, the types of video games we've been playing.
1799000	1803000	Darsakra, at the top of the show, you mentioned you were pretty proud of what you've accomplished this week.
1803000	1805000	Why don't you kick us off with how was your gaming week?
1805000	1807000	Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer.
1807000	1810000	I haven't gotten any more Amiibo cards yet.
1810000	1816000	And that game is really just like sitting down and designing people's homes and watching everyone get completely happy.
1816000	1819000	And then you get like backstory from some of the characters, too.
1819000	1821000	So it's pretty neat.
1821000	1824000	You get to work with Digby and that's also awesome because I like Digby.
1824000	1827000	And I'm back to playing Dragon Age Inquisition.
1827000	1830000	I thought I was going to put it aside and finish Origins again.
1830000	1832000	And no, that didn't happen.
1832000	1835000	I'm also playing Dragon Age Origins at the same time.
1835000	1846000	I haven't played any Final Fantasy 14 this week, but I am hoping to enlist aid in just running nothing but a bunch of dungeons and instances.
1847000	1852000	And then Dan and I were...
1852000	1860000	He's been going through a real bout of playing the Rebirth games on the Wii U.
1860000	1862000	And we also picked up...
1862000	1867000	Have not started yet, but we picked up Earthbound Zero, aka Mother.
1867000	1870000	Do you have your Happy Home Designer with you right now?
1870000	1871000	Yes, I do.
1871000	1873000	I would like to see that game, please.
1873000	1874000	Okay, sure.
1874000	1876000	But not right now. I mean, we can't do that later.
1876000	1877000	Okay.
1877000	1879000	There's other things going on, like a show.
1879000	1881000	Like we do anything on the show.
1881000	1882000	Hey!
1882000	1885000	Except talk about food and I raid Rob's Pantry.
1885000	1888000	I heard that. I heard that the crash is pretty funny.
1888000	1890000	Those were so good!
1890000	1892000	Rob, I'm just going to have to buy you another bag of those things.
1892000	1895000	I think when I try to offer those to Shane, Shane's like, mmm, pumpkin.
1895000	1896000	What?
1896000	1898000	No, not the pumpkin ones, the cranberry.
1898000	1900000	What are you trying to offer me?
1900000	1901000	Food.
1901000	1902000	I have food.
1902000	1903000	Shane gave me donuts this morning.
1903000	1906000	Oh, I have a sad story in the FUs of the week about that.
1906000	1908000	Did the mint donut fall over?
1908000	1910000	You just have to wait.
1910000	1912000	Oh, you bastard.
1912000	1915000	Anyhow, if that's it for Dark Soccer, it's gaming week.
1915000	1916000	Whatevs.
1916000	1919000	Then let's get to Loki. How was your gaming week?
1919000	1924000	I played a little bit of Super Mario Maker because I was trying to unlock more costumes.
1924000	1929000	And so now I've hit the point where I can't play the easy mode anymore, which is super easy.
1929000	1934000	So now I had to play normal mode, which is basically easy mode but longer.
1934000	1939000	So I did that last night and played one, and that was about it.
1939000	1944000	And then I've been playing Ingress because I have a lot of free time in the morning apparently.
1944000	1947000	And I've leveled up to level four now.
1947000	1950000	You guys don't understand how bizarro this is to me.
1950000	1951000	It is bizarro.
1951000	1952000	Not just Loki.
1952000	1955000	Shane, too, is now playing Ingress a little bit.
1955000	1957000	You want to talk about bizarro.
1957000	1958000	Why?
1958000	1961000	Does this mean I have to start playing again so I don't feel left out?
1961000	1965000	We could raid. We could raid Roseville. It needs it.
1965000	1966000	Holy balls.
1966000	1969000	As we could go Toys R Us 2, suddenly preparing your toys.
1969000	1970000	You saw how blue...
1970000	1971000	I'm not downloading it again.
1971000	1972000	Yes.
1972000	1974000	Bastard.
1974000	1980000	Anyway, we're going to have a whole Orange Lounge radio team, and they're not even going to know what the hell is happening.
1980000	1982000	We just need to have the orange color show up.
1982000	1984000	I know. If we had an orange faction, that would be great.
1984000	1985000	No.
1985000	1987000	So here's how I finally got Shane to play.
1987000	1991000	Because the first time, Shane was like, Ingress is so stupid, and he downloaded it.
1991000	1993000	He's like, what color are you? Green?
1993000	1994000	He's like, I'm going to go blue.
1994000	1997000	And so he went blue just to fuck with me, right?
1997000	1999000	And I think Shane truly does love the color blue.
1999000	2001000	It is the best thing in the world.
2001000	2003000	And I was like, Shane, you don't understand.
2003000	2005000	If you play blue, you're cut off.
2005000	2007000	And I can't help you at all in that game.
2007000	2010000	And you'll just have to rely on strangers to help you out.
2010000	2012000	Because some people take this shit very seriously.
2012000	2013000	You don't understand.
2013000	2018000	So finally the other day, I was like, Shane, you have that thing for the Power Rangers, right?
2018000	2020000	Like Chase and Riley, right? What color are they?
2020000	2022000	Because I was like, I don't think it was the Blue Ranger.
2022000	2024000	And he goes, they were green and black.
2024000	2027000	I said, did you know in Ingress, when you make fields, they're kind of green and black.
2027000	2030000	And you can name yourself after a Power Ranger.
2030000	2033000	And then Shane's eyes kind of like, you make a good argument.
2035000	2040000	It was that and the fact that I go look for the toys, so I'm driving to these places anyway.
2040000	2041000	Yeah.
2041000	2043000	So I finally got Shane to roll for the correct team.
2043000	2046000	And I said, the blue is the wrong shade anyway.
2046000	2048000	It is kind of a light color.
2048000	2053000	Well, I mean, and I've been just walking in the morning going to random parks.
2053000	2057000	There's some Resistance players that probably listen to this show that are like, whatever, Rob, you're an idiot.
2057000	2062000	I'm sorry about it. Of course I'm going to recruit my friends for the same faction. Deal with it.
2063000	2067000	Rob, you're totally not at all remotely sorry about anything ever.
2067000	2069000	Nope. Not at all.
2069000	2074000	So, but yeah, I mean, uh, so I've been walking around in the mornings and doing that.
2074000	2077000	Yeah, but you want to talk with Zorro World. I've been fucking eating salad every night.
2077000	2082000	So that's, you know, yeah, I know like a pod person or something.
2082000	2084000	I don't know what's going on.
2085000	2086000	That's weird.
2086000	2087000	All right.
2087000	2092000	Uh, but anyways, yeah, so Ingress and then, um, level four and I don't know.
2092000	2096000	It's hard to level over here because there's like too much blue.
2096000	2097000	There's a lot of blue.
2097000	2102000	Well, again, we have to do that thing where you go, we find like a bunch of portals in a park or something that are blue.
2102000	2106000	I smash them, you cap them and link them and then that's, that's the best way to level up.
2106000	2107000	Yeah.
2107000	2109000	That's what I do. That's how he got to level three in like a day.
2109000	2111000	So anyway.
2111000	2115000	By the way, all those portals that you smashed or whatever, they're all back to blue again.
2115000	2117000	Of course they are. Of course they are.
2117000	2120000	Except for one. Which they link to mine.
2120000	2125000	All right. Uh, let's get to Shane. How was your gaming week? What are you up to?
2125000	2130000	I've been playing Ingress a little bit, not as much as everybody else, but just a little bit.
2130000	2138000	And, um, I, the game I completely wrote off on the 3DS, started playing on my phone, Pokemon shuffle.
2138000	2141000	I can't quit playing it. Um.
2141000	2143000	The microtransactions in that game don't bother you though?
2143000	2150000	I don't use them. I just wait the, I can't do math, but the time to get more hearts and then I play.
2150000	2152000	And then if I don't have hearts and I don't play.
2153000	2158000	And then, um, I have been playing on my Japanese 3DS.
2158000	2162000	Uh, they put out a Ninja game, which again, back to Power Rangers.
2162000	2166000	It's not very good. Don't get it. It's pretty, pretty crappy.
2166000	2175000	Um, and then me and Flaco Jones and his wife, we played Soma last night and that was fun because Soma is pretty scary.
2175000	2176000	Oh yeah. You've been really into that.
2176000	2183000	It's not scary, I guess, but the atmosphere is really good and it makes you feel awkward when you play it. I like it.
2183000	2184000	How so?
2184000	2188000	Well, there's this one part near the beginning, so I don't think it's really a spoiler.
2188000	2196000	Um, it's when you are underwater in like this lab and there's this robot in the wall that's calling out for help.
2196000	2201000	And you go over to him and he thinks he's human and you try to kind of argue with him about it.
2201000	2208000	And the only way to get by him is to shut this power down, but he thinks he's hurt and when you shut the power down, he screams in pain.
2208000	2216000	And it's the only way he can get by, but again, he thinks he's human, so it's like you're torturing him to get by and it just makes you unsettled.
2216000	2222000	This sounds like one of those sadistic Mario Maker levels where the only way to clear the level is to kill Yoshi.
2222000	2238000	No, it's not that sad. But it's a really interesting game so far and the one enemy we ran into just looks like a big blue robot chicken thing and it wasn't very scary.
2238000	2240000	But I'm sure there's more later.
2240000	2242000	Alright, fair enough.
2243000	2249000	Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. SSG100Matt talking about Ingress here for Loki saying,
2249000	2253000	I wonder if Nellie is pissed at Rob that now her husband is wandering around raiding portals.
2253000	2255000	She doesn't care. I mean, I just told her-
2255000	2260000	I would actually think she'd be happy that Matt's probably volunteering to change Kid's Park.
2260000	2264000	I tried explaining the game to her, she just doesn't give a shit what I'm doing. She's like,
2264000	2266000	I don't know what you're talking about.
2266000	2268000	But he's walking more-
2268000	2270000	I'm just saying, I go for walks in the morning.
2270000	2272000	And she's like, why don't you go to our park?
2272000	2276000	I'm like, because these parks are closer and more convenient for me.
2276000	2278000	And also I'm playing this game.
2281000	2284000	Just waiting to get to level 8, then you're going to be places you never thought you'd ever go.
2284000	2291000	I had to go to a dog park and walk into the park where the actual dogs are running around and just sit there playing on my phone and these people look like,
2291000	2293000	what the hell is he doing?
2293000	2296000	I am hacking this portal.
2296000	2299000	Wait until there's a group of like 10 of you at the park all staring at your fuckers.
2299000	2303000	And then I'm like, hey, look at this cemetery has a ton of portals I can hack.
2303000	2307000	I'm going to go walk around in a cemetery. That's going to look strange.
2309000	2312000	Just put on the goth makeup and no one will care.
2312000	2317000	Actually, I find there's a lot of people that go walking in cemeteries because it's quiet and calm.
2317000	2321000	Like, you know, it creeps some people out, but for others it's like-
2321000	2324000	Well, it doesn't creep me out at all. It's just like, you know-
2325000	2326000	When I lived in Alabama-
2326000	2330000	Are you here to visit somebody? No? Just kicking it? Okay, cool.
2330000	2334000	If you watched this week's Scream Queens, there's other things you can do in a cemetery too.
2337000	2340000	That's after dark and you have to be a weird person to do that.
2340000	2341000	It was so good.
2342000	2349000	Okay, so my gaming week. Well, I always play Ingress. I just don't talk about it here on OLR, but I play other games too.
2349000	2354000	I've been playing more Diablo 3. Alan and I have been running our season characters.
2354000	2356000	Here's the hilarious thing.
2356000	2366000	So, my non-seasonal character, which, keep in mind, has the experience dump from season 1, 2, and 3, is Paragon 281.
2366000	2369000	My seasonal character is now Paragon 274.
2369000	2375000	I'm about to pass, experience-wise, all of the experience I've gained until the season started, which is a pretty big deal.
2375000	2377000	So, that is Diablo 3.
2377000	2379000	I have breaking news for you, I forgot.
2379000	2380000	Oh god, alright.
2380000	2385000	No, so earlier today we were talking about PlayStation TVs, because this is gaming related.
2385000	2386000	Yeah.
2387000	2393000	Because they're on sale right now at a retailer, and you were like, I don't want one unless it can play Luminous.
2393000	2398000	And we saw that it said it couldn't, but I don't believe the internet most of the time.
2398000	2404000	So, I put in Luminous, you can start it, and that's it. You can't do anything. You can't get beyond the start screen.
2404000	2405000	That is so dumb.
2405000	2406000	That is very dumb.
2406000	2409000	Unless you have the hack, which you can do and it can play most games.
2409000	2411000	Oh, you know about that. Oh, there you go, you can hack it.
2411000	2413000	I can hack it. Alright, yeah, I know we talked about the hack.
2413000	2414000	You have to send yourself an email.
2414000	2415000	Go with me too.
2415000	2416000	Yeah.
2416000	2417000	Weird.
2417000	2420000	Alright, anyway, other games I've been playing this week besides Diablo.
2420000	2429000	Some new stuff. I played Super Meat Boy on PlayStation 4, because you guys might have heard that Super Meat Boy was finally released on the PlayStation platforms,
2429000	2433000	and they did the release on PlayStation 4, as well as the Vita.
2433000	2436000	I haven't played the Vita version, just the PlayStation 4 version.
2436000	2445000	Very interesting twist, because due to, I guess, some types of arrangement disagreements with the original soundtrack creator,
2445000	2450000	there's a brand new soundtrack for Super Meat Boy for the PlayStation version.
2450000	2455000	And I'm going to be honest, I love a lot of the composers that are in the new soundtrack.
2455000	2457000	Not as good as the old soundtrack.
2457000	2461000	And maybe if I'd never heard the old soundtrack, I wouldn't feel that way.
2461000	2468000	But I just feel like, I don't know, like having played Super Meat Boy all these years on 360 and Steam and so forth,
2468000	2479000	with that, you know, kind of chiptune soundtrack, to kind of go from that to like a music in level one that sounds like this rodeo twang thing just doesn't really work for me.
2479000	2480000	Like, I'm weird.
2480000	2486000	It's really interesting how important a soundtrack can kind of be to a game.
2486000	2491000	And I didn't like the way the soundtrack scaled in the retro levels and some of that either.
2491000	2499000	The game itself is still good, but I also caught some like shadowing effects and some weird frame rate things on PlayStation.
2499000	2503000	I don't know if that has to do with the refresh rate on my TV or what, but I'm going to be honest,
2503000	2509000	I still think the 360 version or maybe even the Steam version is probably the definitive version of that game.
2509000	2514000	It's nice that it's on the PlayStation platform, especially free for PlayStation Plus people,
2514000	2517000	which if you have a PlayStation, you got to be PlayStation Plus.
2517000	2520000	So, I mean, that's cool if you've never had a chance to play it before.
2520000	2523000	It's, you know, still a good game and the soundtrack's not really going to change that.
2523000	2528000	But I don't think it's the definitive experience for Super Meat Boy.
2528000	2530000	And that's my honest opinion.
2530000	2538000	Also played a game on Steam called Read Only Memories, which you might have heard came out this week, which you also played.
2538000	2540000	Which I bought, but I haven't played yet. I forgot to mention.
2540000	2543000	Oh, I bought that, but I never got a key for it.
2543000	2547000	Check your email, because the keys didn't come out until the day the game came out.
2547000	2548000	And so, yeah.
2548000	2549000	I hope I didn't delete it.
2549000	2552000	You know, I kickstarted the game. So, there you go.
2552000	2558000	So, I got my code and played, like, the first little bit of it.
2558000	2565000	Okay, so I'm going to be very honest in saying something that might sound really cold, but it's just like,
2565000	2568000	I'm just, tonight is honesty night, everybody.
2568000	2569000	Here's the thing.
2569000	2573000	I actually wasn't expecting the game to be very good.
2573000	2579000	And only because I know that these guys are very busy with the convention and all this stuff,
2579000	2583000	and, you know, when I saw that they went the retro route, I was like,
2583000	2587000	oh, they're probably doing that, you know, because it's, like, easier or whatever.
2587000	2588000	Never mind, I didn't back it, unfortunately.
2588000	2589000	Oh, you didn't back it?
2589000	2591000	No, I was thinking Electronic Opus.
2591000	2592000	Oh, no, no, no.
2592000	2598000	And I thought, you know, oh, it's probably, they're stretched too thin,
2598000	2601000	and they're not really going to have the time to make the game.
2601000	2606000	But I'm happy to say, as cold as that sounds, the game actually turned out pretty good.
2606000	2611000	And it really does feel like a throwback to, like, the older PC games.
2611000	2615000	Like, I'm playing, like, I don't know, King's Quest or Space Quest,
2615000	2618000	or one of those, like, old school games on the PC.
2618000	2620000	And so, I like that aesthetic.
2620000	2624000	It's heavily, heavily inspired by Snatcher, which I don't have as much experience with,
2624000	2629000	but from what I understand about the game, that influence is definitely there as well.
2629000	2634000	So, as mean as what I said is, I'm happy to say the game is actually better
2634000	2636000	than I expected in that regard.
2636000	2637000	But, yeah.
2637000	2638000	So, there you go.
2638000	2641000	I only played through the prologue in the first little bit of Chapter 1,
2641000	2645000	so I still have a long way to go, but my early impressions are,
2645000	2646000	okay, this is, like, retro, kind of cool.
2646000	2649000	I like it.
2649000	2653000	I know a lot of people have heard about, you know, because it was the Kickstarter,
2653000	2659000	because it was the same team that does GamerX, which is now GX,
2659000	2662000	some people are wondering about, is there a huge, like,
2662000	2665000	social justice warrior agenda in the game.
2665000	2671000	And to be honest, like, I think a lot of people are talking about the pronoun thing,
2671000	2676000	which, to me, like, don't most games that are a little bit first person,
2676000	2678000	don't they, like, ask you in the beginning,
2678000	2680000	like, oh, are you boy or girl?
2680000	2682000	Like, you get asked that question in the beginning of the game.
2682000	2687000	Okay, so the difference here is that it's just, so, what do you prefer to be called?
2687000	2690000	And it's, like, a list of five things, or you can even put in your own thing.
2690000	2692000	And I don't see the big issue with that.
2692000	2698000	Like, whatever makes you happy and what you prefer to be addressed by, go for it.
2698000	2701000	I could even change it, and I thought about doing this,
2701000	2704000	so instead of having, like, he or him, I was going to do, like,
2704000	2707000	the whole, like, Peppermint Patty and Marcy thing and be addressed as sir.
2707000	2709000	And the game would have let me do that.
2709000	2711000	So, you know, I think it's, you can do whatever you want.
2711000	2712000	That's cool.
2712000	2718000	Yeah. So, and, but, I mean, the story, like, it isn't like it's this huge, like,
2718000	2722000	oh, we have to start this campaign and get signatures
2722000	2725000	to get such and such TV show off the air because it's problematic.
2725000	2727000	Like, that's not what the game is about at all.
2727000	2730000	Your friend gets kidnapped and you're trying to put together the clues
2730000	2736000	about where your friend has gone off to because the little robot servant dude
2736000	2738000	escaped and came to you for help.
2738000	2743000	So, I mean, it's like, so the story itself has nothing to do with any of that.
2743000	2745000	So, there you go.
2745000	2748000	So, that was my thought on Read Only Memories.
2748000	2750000	So, that was my gaming week.
2750000	2752000	My early thoughts, I should say.
2752000	2753000	Quick housekeeping.
2753000	2759000	Not a lot to say, but I will say, speaking of GX and all that,
2759000	2765000	we are going to be there at GX3, which is the weekend December 11th and 12th
2765000	2768000	and 13th, I think it's Friday, Saturday, Sunday, that whole weekend.
2768000	2772000	Dark Soccer and myself will be there, as well as,
2772000	2774000	I don't know if anybody else from VoG is going,
2774000	2777000	but I know some other friendly podcasters and some people
2777000	2780000	that have been here on OLR are going to be there with us.
2780000	2783000	And VoG will actually have a table at the show,
2783000	2785000	and I still don't know what we're doing with said table,
2785000	2786000	but we'll figure it out.
2786000	2787000	You know, now that I have the-
2787000	2789000	I'll arm wrestle people.
2789000	2793000	Now that I have the Retron and this, we actually have a spare TV,
2793000	2796000	maybe what we'll do is we'll set up like a classic gaming thing.
2796000	2799000	If you want to bring some of your games, we can figure something out.
2799000	2803000	Which reminds me, did you still want to borrow a Neo Geo Pocket Color?
2803000	2804000	Because we have several.
2804000	2807000	I might, but I don't want to keep it, but I'll borrow it.
2807000	2808000	Okay.
2808000	2810000	Yeah, to play it and check it out, but I don't want to keep it, yeah.
2810000	2811000	Okay.
2811000	2813000	Yeah, that'll work. Cool.
2813000	2818000	Alright, let's get into some gaming news then, now that all that's done.
2818000	2821000	Oh, Twitter.com slash OLR, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio,
2822000	2824000	Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.
2824000	2825000	All that good stuff.
2825000	2827000	Okay, let's get into some gaming news.
2827000	2828000	Loki's starting us off this week.
2828000	2832000	Well, a good way to kick off the holiday season is a price drop,
2832000	2833000	and that's what Sony has.
2833000	2837000	They announced effective October 9th that the base PlayStation 4 will drop
2837000	2843000	from $399 to $349 in the US, and in Canada it would be $449 to $429.
2843000	2848000	And the holiday bundles are going to be dropping as well.
2848000	2854000	So take a look out for that if you're in the market for PlayStation 4.
2854000	2862000	Also, to go along with that, if you're in the UK, you can now utilize PlayStation Now,
2862000	2868000	and you can stream over 100 games, and that is a thing, I guess, now.
2868000	2873000	They have an unlimited subscription for, looks like, 13 pounds.
2873000	2874000	Nice.
2874000	2877000	That price drop, though, totally not shocking.
2877000	2879000	We all knew it was coming, right?
2879000	2882000	Yeah, I mean, it's been a couple years already.
2882000	2885000	This is about that time where people are going to start thinking about the holidays.
2885000	2887000	I mean, Black Friday is when it really kicks into gear,
2887000	2889000	but since there will be some game releases throughout October and November,
2889000	2890000	now is the time to do it.
2890000	2895000	Yeah, like a Fallout 4 or Call of Duty or Just Cause 3.
2895000	2900000	Or that Star Wars Battlefront thing that happened this weekend, I know, for the beta.
2900000	2902000	Just a few games coming out.
2902000	2904000	Yeah, so it was the right time.
2904000	2911000	So, yeah, that keeps the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One neck and neck with the price, competitive.
2911000	2913000	You're moved, Nintendo.
2913000	2917000	Seriously, or just, I don't know.
2917000	2920000	Have to sweeten that bundle or something.
2920000	2921000	Do something.
2921000	2927000	Well, it's almost kind of like, it seems like kind of an idle state, you know, until the NX stuff comes out.
2927000	2930000	It's like, oh, hey, we're saving all the sweet stuff for the NX,
2930000	2933000	and they better not fucking pull Twilight Princess on us with the fucking,
2933000	2936000	oh, hey, remember that cool Zelda game?
2936000	2938000	Yeah, about that.
2938000	2942000	I know, a lot of people seem to think that's where it's going to go. We'll see.
2942000	2945000	That's not going to be on the Wii. That's going to piss people off.
2945000	2949000	Some people thought Twilight Princess on GameCube was a better experience than the Wii.
2949000	2952000	So, I don't know, just putting it out there.
2952000	2954000	I guess we have to really know what NX is.
2954000	2958000	Maybe NX doesn't really lend itself well to this Zelda game, so it can't do it.
2958000	2960000	We don't know.
2960000	2963000	It would be cool if it was something, well, I don't know.
2963000	2967000	NX is also a version of Pump It Up.
2967000	2970000	It'll just be the Nintendo dance console.
2970000	2972000	I'd be down with that, actually.
2972000	2976000	All right, well, speaking of Nintendo, and a game that I did play this week, but I forgot to talk about,
2976000	2978000	I played a little bit of Splatoon.
2978000	2979000	Oh, yeah, me too.
2979000	2982000	Yeah, Splatfest happened. Were you Team Planes or Cars?
2982000	2984000	I said maybe be Team Planes.
2984000	2986000	Well, we lost.
2986000	2989000	I can't play ranked matches anyway, so it's not ranked.
2989000	2991000	It's not ranked. You just go into the regular matches.
2991000	2994000	Well, I won a couple and lost one, so woo!
2994000	2996000	You might get some snails when you load up the game again.
2996000	2998000	Ew.
2998000	3003000	I will not play it if there are any type of land-based mollusks involved.
3003000	3005000	They're a currency. You just sell them.
3005000	3006000	Yeah, they're a currency.
3006000	3009000	No, I won't play it now.
3009000	3012000	Interesting. All right.
3012000	3018000	But, yeah, so Planes lost. Even though it was like 64 to 36 percent popularity,
3018000	3024000	it seems like every Splatfest, the least popular team, does better in the wins.
3024000	3028000	Except last time. Art won, and it was more popular, and it had more wins.
3028000	3032000	Oh, but wasn't it like really neck and neck? Like it was like 51-49 or something?
3032000	3034000	Yeah, both of them were.
3034000	3039000	It was really neck and neck. No, the only Splatfest I've won is the friggin' Decepticon one.
3039000	3041000	I've never won one still.
3041000	3045000	Jeez, what is up with that? So anyway, that wasn't the news I wanted to get to,
3045000	3051000	but just throwing it out there. But with Splatoon, they have actually just launched Splatnet.
3051000	3056000	So if you go to splatoon.nintendo.net, you can log in with your Nintendo Network ID,
3056000	3062000	and you can actually, I mean, there's not a lot there, but you can see your friends list online,
3062000	3065000	which that's something I don't remember Nintendo doing before.
3065000	3070000	Can we please have it so every time I log into that game, I don't get the stupid news update
3070000	3072000	that's really annoying.
3072000	3076000	They do that so you know the stages, but that's what the app or the site does.
3076000	3081000	I don't care what the stages are, or have it so I can skip that shit, because I don't care.
3081000	3084000	And the app will tell you what the stages are if you need to know.
3084000	3088000	It'll tell you the next three sets, which is great, because that's also for ranked.
3088000	3091000	It'll tell you what ranked styles are coming up.
3091000	3095000	And then it shows you if your friends are on, so without having to turn the Wii U on,
3095000	3098000	you know if your friends are online or not. And then I guess you can set times,
3098000	3102000	but that just sends out a tweet or does it through the sidebar, right?
3102000	3109000	Yeah, it sends out a tweet, and it also sends it out in Japanese, because Jim did it,
3109000	3114000	and it was like, tweet English, and then two minutes later it was in Japanese.
3114000	3117000	I was like, when did you type that?
3117000	3122000	Speaking of Japanese, I know this is really random, but before the show tonight,
3122000	3125000	we were doing Mario Maker, because Loki brought his amiibo that I don't have,
3125000	3130000	because I don't have a Bowser. So he brought his Bowser, and he brought that other Mario,
3130000	3135000	which I did not realize it is the blue Mario and the brown Mario, the pixelated ones,
3135000	3137000	they are different.
3137000	3138000	Didn't I tell you that?
3138000	3140000	You did, but it's not what you said it was.
3140000	3142000	Did you still go big?
3142000	3147000	You go big, but you're the classic colors, and it doesn't do the television effect.
3147000	3150000	I'm sorry, you're the modern colors, and it doesn't do the TV effect.
3150000	3151000	Oh, that's weird.
3151000	3153000	Yeah, it's weird. So the two amiibo do different things.
3153000	3156000	But anyway, I unlocked Bowser, but the reason why I bring that up,
3156000	3159000	I also got the notification that says you have messages,
3159000	3163000	and I noticed a Japanese player commented on my Bowser man level,
3163000	3167000	and I was like, oh, that's kind of, okay, cool, international, I got something there.
3167000	3172000	Well, I pulled up the comments, and the Japanese player had just posted,
3172000	3176000	they drew a pile of poop as a comment to my level.
3176000	3180000	Now, are they actually trying to say that my level was shit?
3180000	3182000	Is that what they're trying to say, that it was a shitty level?
3182000	3185000	Because I'm like, sorry, you couldn't handle it.
3185000	3190000	Or did they just draw poop because they could?
3190000	3192000	Did they shit themselves playing the level?
3192000	3194000	Maybe it's not poop. Maybe it's ice cream.
3194000	3197000	Maybe it's ice cream without a cone. I don't know.
3197000	3201000	Soft serve ice cream. Here's some soft serve ice cream for you.
3201000	3204000	That was soft serve ice cream from a magical unicorn's butt.
3204000	3205000	That's what it was.
3205000	3211000	That would be amazing if soft serve ice cream came out of a unicorn's ass.
3211000	3215000	I might like unicorns a little bit more for that.
3215000	3221000	But it'd actually have to be ice cream. I will not accept, you know, trick ice cream.
3221000	3226000	Let's see, Tiger Clonchette says, Sky, probably, because you know that old saying,
3226000	3228000	a picture is worth a thousand words.
3228000	3232000	S2100Matt says, was it Irene posing as a Japanese player?
3232000	3235000	That would actually make a lot of sense.
3235000	3237000	That would.
3237000	3240000	That would make a lot of sense.
3240000	3243000	All right. Let's see.
3245000	3248000	Let's go on, I guess, to our next story, except our soccer ran out of the room.
3248000	3250000	So I guess we'll loop back to her here in a minute.
3250000	3252000	So, Loki, why don't you take what's next?
3252000	3255000	All right. So, Konami.
3255000	3260000	We used to love you, but now you're just kind of like, what the hell?
3260000	3266000	So now, Konami, as part of their microtransaction fest in Metal Gear Solid V,
3266000	3269000	they have the whole FOBs that you can have,
3269000	3273000	and you can have people attack them and stuff like that in their little multiplayer mode.
3273000	3279000	Well, now you can insure your FOB for real money.
3279000	3285000	That way, if someone attacks your base and destroys stuff, you get paid for it.
3285000	3291000	And so you can pay with it for MB coins or real money.
3292000	3294000	Yeah. So that's nice.
3294000	3302000	And then, along with that, they have some cosmetic DLC for 99 cents each.
3302000	3308000	And they even went as far as to add horse armor.
3310000	3312000	Like, this is one of those things you can't even make up.
3312000	3316000	Like, it's just, you know, it's so meta, what's happening there.
3316000	3321000	Yeah, so, I mean, it's like, I don't know, it's like different tack.
3321000	3324000	Like, you have western tack and parade tack.
3324000	3328000	But it's basically costumes for your horse, so...
3330000	3332000	Alright, I mean, sure.
3332000	3336000	It's like, let's just make this even more of a joke now.
3336000	3341000	But, oh my god, the whole DLC for a freaking insurance against other players?
3341000	3343000	You know, let's be honest, so...
3343000	3347000	I used to play, okay, I used to play a Facebook game called Sorority Life.
3347000	3353000	And the whole thing in Sorority Life was that I guess you could attack other bitches' sororities and steal their money and stuff.
3353000	3355000	Like, that was the whole thing in the game.
3355000	3359000	And it's like, if you don't check in every day, you're gonna get attacked by all these high level players.
3359000	3360000	They're gonna take all your shit.
3360000	3363000	And it gets really frustrating. That's why I don't play it anymore.
3363000	3365000	And I was like, that's in Metal Gear Solid 5?
3365000	3368000	And I have to pay to protect myself?
3368000	3370000	Get fucked. I don't care.
3370000	3373000	Like, I don't know, is that just one mode of the game?
3373000	3375000	Yeah, it's like their little multiplayer mode that they have in there.
3375000	3377000	I don't know, I guess fine, I won't be playing that.
3377000	3382000	The unnecessary multiplayer mode that they added in so they can unnecessarily charge you for insurance.
3382000	3389000	Wait till they add an update where the computer can attack your base so they make you get that insurance and not just other players attacking you.
3389000	3394000	I mean, Grand Theft Auto Online has insurance for your cars that they get destroyed, but it's with in-game money.
3394000	3401000	You don't have the, I mean, you could buy real money, or in-game money with real money, but you don't have to.
3401000	3405000	And, I don't know, it's just dumb.
3405000	3411000	Dungeon Buster in chat says, I don't care about my FOB, I just used it to expand my staffing levels, you can totally ignore it.
3411000	3417000	And William Murderface in chat says, well at this point Konami has burned most of its bridges with game fans, so why not all of them?
3417000	3419000	Why not?
3419000	3421000	Just light it on fire.
3421000	3423000	Hey, they're still making games though, console games.
3423000	3425000	Is anyone gonna give a shit when it comes out?
3425000	3430000	I mean, seriously, is anyone gonna give a shit of whatever they have coming out that's aside from Pro Evo?
3431000	3434000	If it's Dance Sense Revolution, I may give a little bit of a shit.
3434000	3435000	A little bit of a shit, yeah.
3435000	3438000	A little bit of a shit, but, you know, most likely no.
3438000	3443000	Since Rock Band and Guitar Hero are all having this resurgence, we're gonna try Beatmania again in the US?
3443000	3445000	Yeah, right. I'm not gonna hold my breath all night.
3445000	3448000	No, they'll do, um, what was their other game?
3448000	3449000	Rock Revolution.
3449000	3450000	That one, yeah, that's what they'll revive.
3450000	3452000	Ugh, alright.
3452000	3456000	Let's go back to Dark Sakura, because we jumped over one of your-
3456000	3458000	But their drum set was so unique!
3459000	3461000	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
3461000	3466000	Well, we've been talking for a little bit about the voice acting strike.
3466000	3474000	It's, uh, I suppose it's just pronounced SAGAFTRA, or S-A-G-A-F-T-R-A.
3474000	3484000	Had put out the request for votes to see if they want to authorize a strike in response to an impasse in negotiations with the game industry.
3484000	3491000	And 96.52% of its members voted and authorized a strike.
3491000	3497000	They have to have the 75% yes vote to give the national board the authority for it.
3497000	3503000	So, now this doesn't mean there's a strike right now and there's no more voice acting, good voice acting in games ever.
3503000	3511000	It just means that they now have the ability to have a strike, and so they're opening things up for negotiations.
3512000	3514000	It looks like, uh-
3514000	3521000	They've drawn the strike card and put it into their deck for possible future play, but they don't necessarily have to play it.
3521000	3524000	Exactly, it's recycled back into their library.
3524000	3525000	Yes.
3525000	3529000	So, it could be on, it couldn't be on, who knows.
3529000	3536000	It's just, it's now a tactic that's available and endorsed by the majority of its members.
3537000	3543000	And it probably wouldn't affect games right away because most of your voice acting is done a long time in advance.
3543000	3547000	But still, not to lessen the impact that a strike like this would have.
3547000	3549000	And we talked about it on a previous episode of the show.
3549000	3554000	You know, it's a pretty, pretty big deal and could, you know, majorly impact some games down the line.
3554000	3558000	Especially games that have sequels that you get used to.
3558000	3560000	Like, you know, like BioWare games, right?
3560000	3563000	You know, we all know they won't stop with Mass Effect Andromeda.
3563000	3565000	They'll be in Andromeda 2 or something.
3565000	3567000	That could be impacted by a strike like this.
3567000	3570000	You know, the same voice talent may not be available or they'd have to schedule it differently.
3570000	3573000	It could delay the game or what have you.
3573000	3580000	On the flip side, there's some more amateur level voice actors who are a part of SAG-AFTRA who are excited!
3580000	3581000	Yay, work!
3581000	3588000	But it's kind of like, well, you know, and then you get into those tricky situations where you're crossing a picket line, essentially.
3588000	3594000	But aren't they striking in the first place for better conditions for everybody?
3594000	3596000	Like the whole yelling and stuff.
3596000	3599000	We talked about this, you know, I know Marisa called in last week. We talked a little bit about it.
3599000	3602000	I'd actually like for Marisa to call in again.
3602000	3603000	Yeah, but anyway.
3603000	3604000	If she's out there.
3604000	3605000	Yeah.
3605000	3606000	Hopefully we'll get to her later in the show.
3606000	3610000	Because I know she had, I saw a Facebook post of hers that addressed this whole thing.
3610000	3611000	So it'll be interesting.
3611000	3619000	Again, they have not actually gone on strike, but they've drawn the card and they can choose to play it or discard it on a later turn.
3619000	3620000	So we'll see what happens.
3623000	3627000	And well, actually, they could bring it up and then, like I said, recycle it back into their library.
3627000	3628000	That's true.
3628000	3630000	And cast it for five red mana.
3632000	3633000	We'll see what happens. We'll see.
3633000	3637000	Alright, moving on. Talking about DLC, more DLC.
3637000	3642000	You know, Loki was just talking about Metal Gear Solid.
3642000	3646000	And earlier in the show we were talking about Guitar Hero.
3646000	3650000	Well, let's talk about Rise of the Tomb Raider.
3650000	3656000	Because Rise of the Tomb Raider also going to be having microtransactions, if you can believe it.
3656000	3661000	Rise of the Tomb Raider, you'll be able to get expedition card packs.
3661000	3668000	The cards will have modifiers that you can use on custom missions, which you then share with your friends.
3668000	3675000	So things like Big Head Mode or things that increase the challenge or give you special advantages.
3675000	3680000	You can get these card packs with credits in the game or real money.
3680000	3683000	Sounds very similar to the BioWare setup in multiplayer.
3683000	3691000	But it looks like it's just for this custom mission mode, which is not part of the main story game.
3691000	3695000	There's also two types of cards in the game, foil and common.
3695000	3699000	Foil gets to be used an unlimited number of times, but commons are a one-time use.
3699000	3705000	There will be about 300 cards to start with, more to come after that.
3705000	3712000	So there you go, another $60 game with the DLC in there.
3712000	3714000	And this one, again, another random element in there.
3714000	3718000	But I don't know, because again, I kind of say it sounds like Mass Effect.
3718000	3725000	But I was fine with the way Mass Effect did it and the way that Dragon Age multiplayer does it.
3725000	3730000	Because you can earn the stuff at a relatively decent pace yourself.
3730000	3734000	You don't have to spend money, it's just you spend money to rush it along.
3734000	3737000	So I think it all depends on how it's weighed in the game.
3737000	3741000	It may not be as bad as it sounds on paper, but we'll see.
3741000	3743000	We'll see when the game comes out.
3743000	3746000	Let's go back over to Dark Sakura for another story.
3746000	3750000	More from me. Why do you want to talk to me so much tonight?
3750000	3752000	Because you ate all my food, you gotta work.
3752000	3758000	Oh, fine, fine. Well, at any rate, we all love Shovel Knight, don't we?
3758000	3759000	Yay!
3759000	3760000	Yes.
3760000	3762000	Thanks, Shane.
3762000	3765000	I never played it. I thought it was going to be Mega Man, but it wasn't.
3765000	3768000	It's Duck Tales. It's not really that either.
3768000	3775000	You gotta just check it out. It's like a Capcom game of that era, but it's not really like any of the others.
3775000	3787000	Well, they have announced, with extremely heavy hearts in the quote, that the Xbox One physical version of Shovel Knight is not happening.
3787000	3794000	Basically, they said that because of publishing policies on that platform, things that are beyond their control, it's not happening.
3794000	3798000	The pre-orders were really good, and they thank everyone for their support, but it just can't happen.
3798000	3810000	So, they agreed to a $19.99 price point, and then ran into other retail issues as well, so yeah, it's just not happening.
3810000	3816000	That Microsoft. What are you going to do?
3816000	3820000	You can calm your ex-boners now, because it's not happening.
3820000	3826000	Well, there's also a part of me that's like, is there a really big loss to not have a retail release?
3826000	3832000	What market really is there when the game's downloadable and so many people are connected now?
3832000	3834000	But then I think maybe...
3834000	3836000	Some people like a physical release of it.
3836000	3843000	Well, there is that, and maybe other countries too, where it might not be as easy to get online.
3843000	3845000	It's much easier to get the physical copy.
3845000	3849000	I don't know. That's just kind of the thought that goes through my head, is that maybe it's like, it actually is a huge deal.
3849000	3851000	Stocking stuffers?
3851000	3855000	I don't know. I don't know about that. Maybe.
3855000	3861000	ActDeft in chat over at live.vognetwork.com has some feelings on this, saying I had that one pre-ordered. I'm really sad.
3861000	3869000	And that it's DuckTales, Castlevania, Metroid, and all the really good platformers of the NES era, and putting a lot of frowny faces at what Shane is saying.
3869000	3874000	I didn't even say anything. All I said was I thought it was Mega Man, but apparently it's not.
3874000	3876000	That's all I said.
3876000	3879000	What if it's better? I mean, it probably is better than some of the later Mega Man games.
3879000	3883000	I like the proper number series just fine.
3883000	3892000	But I do want the Amiibo, probably, because it's an Amiibo, and if I can't find a Power Ranger toy that day and I can find him, I'm sure that's what I'll want.
3892000	3894000	I definitely want the Shovel Knight Amiibo, that's for sure.
3894000	3900000	But anyway, alright. We're going to travel around the world and check out some release dates of games that will be coming out.
3901000	3907000	Yes. And this week, actually, there's the Back to the Future game by Telltale Games.
3907000	3913000	They're doing a 30th anniversary edition because, hey, the 30th anniversary of the movie!
3913000	3920000	Well, not really the movie, but like the... Isn't this like the same, now the Back to the Future 2 date or something coming up?
3920000	3922000	Isn't it like the 15th or something?
3922000	3925000	Is someone going crazy about that?
3925000	3934000	Anyway, so that date is coming up, and that'll be coming out on Xbox 360 and, I believe, PlayStation 4.
3934000	3940000	Along with that, there's going to be Grand Ages Medieval, Wasteland 2.
3940000	3944000	Oh, and Grand Ages Medieval is going to be coming out on PlayStation 4.
3944000	3949000	Wasteland 2 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, the Director's Cut.
3949000	3955000	Dragon Quest Heroes Slime, Collector's Edition on PlayStation 4.
3955000	3961000	And on PlayStation 3, Arland Atelier Trilogy.
3961000	3967000	And then it looks like they're doing a re-release of the Smurfs on 3DS.
3967000	3969000	Thank you, Ubisoft, you really needed that.
3969000	3978000	And also the non-Collector's Edition Dragon Quest Heroes, the World Trees Woe and the Blight Blow.
3978000	3981000	That's one hell of a subtitle.
3981000	3983000	That's also PlayStation 4.
3983000	3986000	The Legend of Legacy on 3DS.
3986000	3989000	That's an exciting game. I kind of want to play that.
3989000	3994000	Corpse Party Blood Drive, Evening After Edition on Vita.
3994000	4001000	And the Talos Principle, getting a physical release on PlayStation 4.
4001000	4002000	Oh, wow.
4002000	4007000	Also, later in the week, they're doing a Goosebumps game, I guess in tying with the movie.
4007000	4011000	And Nintendo, hey, look, they have a game coming out. Yoshi's Woolly World.
4011000	4015000	Both the game by itself and the Amiibo bundle.
4015000	4018000	Those are going to be coming out on Friday.
4018000	4024000	And along with that, they're doing a re-release of Super Mario Bros. U, plus New Super Luigi.
4024000	4027000	And it's in a bundle for $60.
4027000	4031000	I saw that at Toys R Us today. I wonder if it wasn't supposed to be on the shelves.
4031000	4034000	It may be a re-release. I thought they even had that out already.
4034000	4036000	That's not a big deal. That's more of a re-release.
4036000	4039000	That's probably not a big deal to break street on that.
4039000	4041000	Alright, well, traveling over to Japan.
4041000	4044000	Actually, it's kind of a slow week in Japan. Not a lot coming out.
4044000	4053000	Geki Jigen Tag Blank Plus Neptune vs. Zombie Gundam comes out on the Vita this week in regular and limited edition.
4053000	4061000	And then over on the 3DS this week, we have, and I lost it here, sorry, but there's actually on PlayStation 4,
4061000	4067000	there's really nothing this week and nothing on Wii U that I saw anyway.
4067000	4075000	Yeah, and on the 3DS this week, we have Dragon Ball Z.
4075000	4085000	I'm sorry, no, Dragon Ball, that's different, 7th Dragon 3 code VFD is out on the 3DS in Japan this week.
4085000	4089000	Next week, though, on the 3DS is Legend of Zelda Triforce Heroes.
4089000	4094000	So, you know, things will be picking up again when the release is there, but pretty slow week in Japan otherwise.
4094000	4095000	Dark Sakura.
4095000	4105000	Well, in other news, we have a release on the 13th, in 13th October, is the Talos Principle for PS4 in the UK.
4105000	4112000	On the 16th, we have Back to the Future 30th Anniversary Edition on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Xbox 360.
4113000	4123000	Dragon Quest Heroes for PS4, Tales of Zestiria for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3, and WRC 5 on pretty much everything else.
4123000	4124000	That's it.
4124000	4129000	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week, Loki.
4129000	4135000	So after reading a little bit about this, I'm kind of excited about Minecraft Story Mode, but they're going to be doing a Let's Play,
4135000	4139000	or they're claiming to be the world's largest Let's Play.
4139000	4145000	It's basically going to be held at the ArcLight Cinemarama Dome in Hollywood, California.
4145000	4155000	They're going to be doing that on October 12th, and they're supposed to have, well, it can hold up to 800 guests, and that's what they're trying to do there.
4155000	4169000	They're going to be basically playing through the first episode, Order of the Stone, and it's going to be streamed on the YouTube gaming channel, I guess at 7pm Eastern Time.
4169000	4172000	But the voice cast is what kind of has me excited about the game.
4172000	4184000	They have, was it, Patton Oswalt, Ashley Johnson from The Last of Us, Brian Pushing, Billy West, Corey Feldman, and Paul Reubens.
4184000	4186000	That's pretty cool.
4186000	4190000	Yeah, so I actually will have to check that out. That looks pretty awesome.
4190000	4201000	Which, by the way, I don't watch the show, but Paul Reubens is going to be on Gotham as Penguin's dad, as he was in Batman Returns.
4202000	4209000	Do they have the, oh yeah, they do have the Penguin on that show. I watch like half the first season and then gave up.
4209000	4211000	It's like Batman without Paul Reubens.
4211000	4216000	I would watch it for Paul Reubens. Well, that and I don't like DC very much, but I would watch it with Paul Reubens.
4216000	4220000	You know, so...
4220000	4226000	Could he be like a villain in one of these, like, comic book movies? I mean, I know he was in Mystery Men, but...
4226000	4229000	I always thought he'd make a good Riddler.
4230000	4231000	I can see that.
4231000	4233000	He's probably, he's got to be about 60 years old now.
4233000	4234000	So?
4234000	4235000	Well, I mean, I'm just saying, you know, he's...
4235000	4238000	He can, he still looks, he still does the full Bewe thing.
4238000	4239000	That's true, that's true.
4239000	4240000	He looks fine.
4240000	4241000	I want to see the new movie.
4241000	4242000	Does it matter?
4242000	4247000	SSG-100 Matt in chat says the second season is better. Maybe I'll have to check that out. We'll see.
4247000	4260000	Alright, moving on to another story here about possibly playing Xbox 360 and original Xbox games through the Xbox One.
4260000	4262000	360 games maybe on the PC.
4262000	4275000	This was in an interview with Gizmodo Brazil, where the Xbox head Phil Spencer was talking about that original Xbox games being backward compatible on Xbox One would be great.
4275000	4279000	But he did reiterate that Xbox 360 functionality is the priority right now.
4279000	4285000	He said also he wants Windows 10 users to be able to play the Xbox 360 games on PC.
4285000	4287000	Quote, it's something I want to do.
4287000	4295000	I would love to have the ability to play Xbox 360 on PC at some point, but it would be great to have support for original Xbox games too.
4295000	4304000	To be clear, he's hinted at the 360 things on PC before, but, you know, the fact he's bringing it up again, I wonder if this is something they may be working on.
4304000	4314000	Especially, you would think, I mean, you could easily do the streaming anyway, but if you could take the Xbox One out of the equation for some people, that would be really awesome.
4314000	4319000	He says, quote, so yes, I want to do, but have many other things we want to do as well.
4319000	4324000	People fight with me for not having background music, so we have much work to do.
4324000	4328000	You know, the more and more I hear from Phil Spencer, the more I like his perspective on things.
4329000	4339000	Because there was another interview I was reading with him this week where he talked about how, you know, they are still trying to regain confidence over the bridges they burned about the Xbox One's initial reveal.
4339000	4345000	That there are still people that are confused and will ask, does the Xbox One play used games?
4345000	4348000	Because they don't know because of that mixed message in the very beginning.
4348000	4356000	So, I really like the guy's, like, upfrontness and I feel like he's pretty transparent, especially, like, compared to Nintendo.
4356000	4360000	You know, I kind of feel like he's really upfront about a lot of things. So, I like the guy.
4360000	4364000	He's a good fit on, like, who he was in before.
4364000	4366000	Let's have him run Nintendo.
4366000	4368000	You never know. You never know.
4368000	4370000	All right. Well, let's travel.
4370000	4372000	Or Konami. Let's have him run Konami.
4372000	4377000	Let's travel back in time when, you know, these heads of companies were just pictures we saw in magazines.
4377000	4383000	We didn't hear interviews on the internet. We just would see them in comics and magazines.
4384000	4387000	The classic game of the week.
4387000	4392000	Every week, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds one game that she thinks, hey, you un-
4392000	4394000	I just broke my hair clip.
4394000	4395000	Are you okay?
4395000	4397000	Yeah, but it's expensive. Shit.
4397000	4400000	Aww. Well, at least it's just a hair clip and not a finger.
4400000	4401000	All right.
4401000	4404000	Yeah, but now I don't have anything to pull my substantial hair back with, Rob. Thank you.
4404000	4407000	You can just let it all hang down.
4408000	4413000	Well, if I had a spare hair clip, I'd loan you one, but I don't have a mani tail.
4413000	4415000	Hold my hair while I throw up.
4415000	4417000	Hold my hair back.
4417000	4419000	All right. Let's go to the classic game of the week.
4419000	4425000	Dark Soccer's gonna let her hair down and share with you guys what game she thinks you should be playing this week.
4425000	4426000	Dark Soccer.
4426000	4427000	Oh, girl.
4427000	4433000	So, the game this week is Castlevania the Adventure.
4433000	4440000	And in Japan it was called Dracula Densetsu, also known as the Legend of Dracula.
4440000	4447000	It was a platformer for the Game Boy that came out in 1989, and it was re-released- well, kind of re-released.
4447000	4453000	It was remade as Castlevania the Adventure Rebirth, which is a WiiWare game for the Wii.
4453000	4461000	Dan's been actually playing quite a bit of that, so I was really inspired, I should say, by watching him play through this.
4461000	4464000	God, the last two bosses are really easy in this, by the way.
4464000	4466000	I actually have the Wii game as well.
4466000	4467000	Yeah.
4467000	4472000	It's pretty good. A lot of those WiiWare games got really overlooked, but there was some good stuff on there.
4472000	4478000	Well, we were doing like the, what game did this song come from? What game did this one come from? You know.
4478000	4487000	So, anyway, it was said about a century before the original Castlevania, so you play Christopher Belmont, who is an ancestor of Simon.
4487000	4493000	And he goes through all the different stages to beat Dracula and do the stuff that those Belmonts do.
4493000	4501000	You can, you start off with three lives, and then when, if you die, then you have to restart the level after your three are gone.
4501000	4505000	You can upgrade your weapons. You can get a chain whip and flame whip.
4505000	4510000	You can, anytime you get hit, it will downgrade the weapon.
4510000	4515000	There's no stairs in this one, unlike the other Castlevania games.
4515000	4522000	The new one actually has stuff like that, has stairs and things.
4522000	4525000	You also have to beat your primary evil every level.
4525000	4534000	You get crystals, hearts, and crosses of gold, and a point counter, and every 10,000 points you get an extra life.
4534000	4543000	Each stage also has a time limit, which was funny because Dan was beating death and then he was kind of screwing around at the end of the fight and actually died due to the time limit.
4543000	4546000	But this was in the new one.
4546000	4560000	So anyway, it was called pretty difficult and had really long levels, but it's pretty simple, it's basic, and it goes back to the Castlevania roots, so it was pretty good.
4560000	4569000	IDW also did a series of comic books about Christopher Belmont in 2005. It's called Castlevania the Belmont Legacy.
4569000	4572000	And there you go, just simple as that.
4600000	4603000	There it is, your classic game of the week, Castlevania Adventure.
4603000	4609000	Well we're going to take a quick break, but when we come back there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come, so don't go anywhere.
4609000	4618000	We're going to get to rapid fire news, the FUGU Question of the Week, and your calls when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
4624000	4627000	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
4627000	4633000	Live tonight, October the 11th of 2015 with episode number 617 of our show.
4633000	4641000	DarkSakura, Loki, and myself all here in the studio joined by our pal Shane Alinko, who is enabling me during the break, who pointed out,
4641000	4643000	Hey Rob, look!
4643000	4644000	Heroes power.
4644000	4648000	Look at Amazon, there's a Toon Link, and you don't have one in your collection.
4648000	4650000	And it was for a regular price with free shipping.
4650000	4654000	Toon Link's only $13.99, available on Prime, and I'm like, it's a Japanese one.
4654000	4657000	So, it's the same. Alright, fine, bought it.
4659000	4661000	Rob, why didn't you get me a Sheik while you were at it?
4661000	4667000	Because, the addiction is bad enough for myself, I don't need to involve other people as well.
4667000	4673000	I look at that shelf and I think each one of those cost X amount of dollars and I just feel deep shame.
4673000	4675000	But I could use a Sheik.
4675000	4677000	Well I could use a pony, are you going to buy me a pony?
4677000	4678000	You can't use a pony.
4678000	4681000	Sure, everybody could use a pony.
4681000	4683000	What you need is a goat for your backyard.
4684000	4685000	To eat all that.
4685000	4688000	I would love to have a goat, actually. That would be amazing.
4689000	4690000	That would be great.
4690000	4694000	I wonder if I can find another Amiibo that's regular priced by the time the show's over.
4694000	4696000	The thing that I need for my collection?
4696000	4697000	Yeah.
4697000	4699000	I don't really need everything though, like I even said-
4699000	4703000	I don't either, but you say that, but then look at that and you're like, well now I do, because look how far I've come.
4703000	4705000	I know, but I don't really want, like you've been pushing-
4705000	4706000	You don't want the Fire Emblem.
4706000	4709000	The Fire Emblem people, and I know I'm weird with that.
4709000	4711000	Like, because I know a lot of people really love the Fire Emblem.
4711000	4714000	But I'm like, eh, eh, I don't really need them.
4714000	4717000	But it's the old school characters that really do it.
4717000	4720000	Like the old, you know, Nintendo and Super Nintendo.
4720000	4722000	I think the reason why I don't really care about Fire Emblem is because of the newer.
4722000	4724000	Well technically he's not Marth old school.
4724000	4725000	He's one.
4725000	4726000	Whatever.
4726000	4728000	He's the one you can find right now too in the store.
4728000	4729000	Whatever.
4730000	4731000	I'm not listening to you.
4731000	4732000	Alright.
4734000	4737000	Let's move on, we're going to do some rapid fire news.
4738000	4741000	Loki, why don't you start us off with some quick news here.
4741000	4744000	Alright, I'll stop making Mario Maker levels.
4744000	4749000	Alright, so Far Cry has a new game coming out.
4749000	4754000	Far Cry Primal, it's going to be medieval, or not medieval, Stone Age.
4754000	4756000	That would have been cool if it was medieval.
4756000	4757000	Medieval Far Cry.
4757000	4758000	Yeah, I'd like that even better.
4758000	4759000	I would get that.
4759000	4765000	Stone Age Far Cry, not sure if I'm really feeling that, but that's what's going to happen.
4765000	4766000	That's what's going to happen.
4766000	4775000	And it's set to release now on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, as well as PC on February 23,
4775000	4779000	at least on the console versions, and then March for PC.
4779000	4783000	They're not bringing it out to last gen platforms though.
4783000	4787000	And I got to be honest, I'm pretty excited usually about Far Cry games.
4787000	4789000	Not feeling anything for this one.
4789000	4791000	It should have been Blood Dragon 2.
4791000	4793000	Then I might have given it a shit.
4793000	4794000	But it's not.
4794000	4798000	Well, let's see here.
4798000	4807000	American Dad is now being turned into a pinball table in Zen Pinball 2's Balls of Glory pack.
4807000	4814000	That's going to be also joining, I guess, other Fox shows, including Family Guy and Bob's Burgers.
4814000	4817000	And yeah, so that would be pretty cool.
4817000	4822000	And then finally, Star Wars Battlefront.
4822000	4825000	The beta is going to be extended through Tuesday.
4825000	4826000	A whole day.
4826000	4830000	So now you have until the 13th to play the game.
4830000	4831000	I don't know.
4831000	4833000	I played a little bit of Battlefront.
4833000	4835000	The old one, kind of liked it.
4835000	4841000	This I'm not hearing is, it basically seems like it's reskinned Battlefield.
4841000	4846000	That's what I'm hearing on Facebook is that it's like, and Twitter, it's just Battlefield with Star Wars.
4846000	4847000	I'm fine with that.
4847000	4849000	But I would think that's what some people want.
4849000	4851000	Yeah, I'm fine with that, but I don't know.
4851000	4856000	I don't like the fact that it doesn't really have a single player portion of it, but whatever.
4856000	4857000	Alright.
4857000	4863000	Well, do you guys remember that interesting Nintendo PlayStation prototype?
4863000	4865000	No, remember when Sony and Nintendo were working together?
4865000	4871000	And just a couple months ago, some guy found it like in an old storage thing somewhere.
4871000	4873000	And he found this and was making YouTubes of it.
4873000	4875000	Well, there's an interesting follow up to this.
4875000	4880000	Is that he's actually going to go public and bring this console out for public viewing.
4880000	4883000	But what's interesting is where it's going to be.
4883000	4885000	It's going to be at a Hong Kong gaming event.
4885000	4888000	Retro.HK.
4888000	4893000	But this part's really cool and this must be how the people convinced him to come out.
4893000	4897000	So, what's going to happen is that the console is going to go to Retro.HK.
4897000	4906000	Professionals are going to look at it to see what's inside and if any functionality possibly remains with the device.
4907000	4911000	Because remember, I think he was kind of paranoid to use it because it might short circuit.
4911000	4912000	I'm soon to remember.
4912000	4915000	So, he's going to have some experts actually take a look at it.
4915000	4924000	This feels to me like an episode of Pawn Shop or something where the experts are going to look at it to see if it really is valuable or if it's, you know.
4924000	4925000	Pawn Stars.
4925000	4926000	That's it, Pawn Stars.
4926000	4928000	Which that show was pretty cool.
4928000	4929000	Yeah, I have to admit.
4929000	4933000	Now when I see a Pawn Shop in Reno or something, I'm always like,
4933000	4934000	You never know what you're going to find.
4934000	4936000	You find some gaming stuff at some of those places.
4936000	4937000	Also completely off topic.
4937000	4938000	Sure.
4938000	4940000	You know how they called the one guy, Chumlee?
4940000	4942000	I forget, but sure.
4942000	4947000	Well, I was from Tennessee Tuxedo and that always made me like the show, so whatever.
4947000	4948000	There you go, alright.
4948000	4950000	Obscure reference.
4950000	4953000	Alright, moving on.
4953000	4955000	Half Life 3.
4955000	4959000	Now that I have your attention, no Half Life 3 was not announced.
4959000	4969000	But Valve, apparently trolling people at this point, there was a file update to Dota 2 called HL3.txt.
4969000	4978000	And HL3.txt is just some miscellaneous codes, but there's some references to virtual reality, procedural generation, and co-op NPCs.
4978000	4984000	But for all we know, this is just Valve being dicks and putting a file in here so that people go crazy.
4984000	4989000	Or could it be the beginnings of an ARG for Half Life 3?
4989000	4990000	Let's be honest though.
4990000	4992000	They are fans of that though.
4992000	4998000	I hope it's either something that accidentally got in there, which I doubt it, or like an ARG thing.
4998000	5001000	But if it's just them being dicks, that's kind of fucked up.
5001000	5003000	I mean, if you ask me, it's like, okay, listen.
5003000	5007000	People are fans about your shit and you're going to troll people with this.
5007000	5009000	How do you get off on this shit?
5009000	5015000	I mean, it's like, seriously, people are entrusting you to come out with something really cool.
5015000	5018000	And fuck, you haven't really released anything in quite a while.
5018000	5022000	I don't know, that's kind of a fucked up thing to do.
5022000	5026000	But sure, if it's just a joke, then fuck you.
5030000	5031000	I don't know though.
5031000	5035000	They seem to be pretty happy with doing those ARGs and everything.
5035000	5040000	I mean, they did a couple of really crazy ones with Portal, remember?
5041000	5044000	Yeah, there were some pretty cool Portal ARGs, so who knows?
5044000	5051000	Or it could just be that there's something else that's HL3 that has nothing to do with Half Life 3.
5051000	5052000	Like, you know, it isn't that huge.
5052000	5057000	Really, they should have just named it HL3 underscore not Half Life 3.
5059000	5060000	Sorry.
5061000	5066000	Alright, well, moving on to, hey, DDR-related news, if you can believe it.
5066000	5071000	No, there's not a new game or anything, but people playing DDR for charity.
5071000	5078000	And they did this event last year, it was called DDR4LLS, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.
5078000	5086000	They're going to do it again October the 17th, starting at 9am Pacific Time, raising some money for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.
5086000	5090000	It looks like they're going to be doing a DDR X3 marathon featuring requests.
5090000	5095000	And there'll be folks emceeing the stream, and they say they're going to run it Desert Bus style,
5095000	5098000	where donations will keep the stream going longer.
5098000	5101000	So the more they raise, the longer they're going to dance.
5101000	5105000	I only have seen this on Facebook, and it doesn't have a short URL.
5105000	5111000	So you'll have to try to find this DDR charity stream, the 2.015.
5111000	5115000	Or I'm sure Dark Tetsuya, if he's listening, he'll post the link there in the chatroom.
5115000	5120000	So you guys can check that out and make a bookmark and a note to check that out for a good cause.
5120000	5123000	So there you go, Dark Sakura.
5123000	5128000	Well, we like our SEGA stuff, and apparently Nintendo knows we like our SEGA stuff.
5128000	5138000	For the 25th anniversary of the SEGA Game Gear in Japan, it looks like there's going to be a Game Gear themed Nintendo 3DS.
5138000	5144000	They don't have a release date on it yet, but they did tease pictures of it on this SEGA Twitter.
5144000	5151000	So, hooray! It looks alright, you know, but I have a Game Gear, so why do I need that?
5151000	5155000	Also, there's another game, and I actually own this game.
5155000	5159000	The Revolutionary Girl Utena game that came out on SEGA Saturn.
5159000	5167000	It was pretty fun, and it had the full motion video and some fun stuff and the full intro and everything.
5167000	5172000	But people apparently really, really like it.
5172000	5177000	And so they are starting to do a fan translation.
5177000	5180000	You can download the translation online.
5180000	5187000	They've done 100% of the script text and some of the graphic interface as well.
5187000	5190000	So I'm kind of curious.
5190000	5196000	I mean, I own this game. I've played through it in Japanese, so who knows?
5196000	5199000	And also, Stephen Colbert.
5199000	5205000	Now, he is, you know, a pretty decent, I'd say, video game fan.
5205000	5207000	You know, he does stuff for us.
5207000	5212000	We talked last week about the contrast between what he said and what Jimmy Kimmel said about it,
5212000	5215000	because he had PewDiePie on, and he was actually kind of respectful about it,
5215000	5218000	whereas, you know, Jimmy Kimmel had made some pretty controversial statements.
5218000	5221000	I just love Stephen Colbert. Good lord, that man's great.
5221000	5223000	He's pretty cool.
5223000	5234000	So anyway, he is actually going to be playing some of the music on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on October 13th.
5234000	5239000	He's supposed to be playing some of the music from The Legend of Zelda, Symphony of the Goddesses.
5239000	5245000	So I definitely want to tune in and listen to that. So very cool.
5245000	5250000	Yeah, I'm even more impressed with Stephen Colbert for getting something like that on the show.
5250000	5252000	That's a heck of a music guest.
5252000	5257000	My friend Dave Letterman had Hatsune Miku, and that was, like, such a big deal.
5257000	5261000	Like, it's interesting that now we're getting more, like, video game-based guests on shows.
5261000	5264000	That's really rad, though. I'm looking forward to seeing that.
5264000	5267000	You know Stephen Colbert has probably played a game or two of Zelda in his time.
5267000	5269000	So very cool.
5269000	5273000	All right. Well, let's get to the foogle question of the week.
5273000	5277000	You take Facebook and Google Plus and slam them together, and you get foogle.
5277000	5280000	It's right here.
5283000	5292000	This week for our foogle question of the week, we wanted to expand on what we talked about at the beginning of the show tonight with Guitar Hero's new DLC.
5292000	5296000	Guitar Hero Live this week announced an interesting new plan for DLC.
5296000	5306000	Taking a cue from Spotify, you will no longer download DLC to own permanently, but stream songs using currency in-game or with real money to purchase the right to play songs on demand.
5306000	5310000	It's a little hard to explain, so we linked the official post for people.
5310000	5313000	We wanted to know, what did you guys think about the new method of DLC?
5313000	5319000	Do you like the idea of discoverability behind it and the idea that we usually download these songs to play them just a couple times?
5319000	5322000	Or is this a dangerous direction for DLC to head?
5322000	5329000	So over on Facebook, William Murderface said, this is an interesting idea for this genre, but I don't think it could translate well to other genres.
5329000	5335000	The idea that you could have a Pandora of Guitar Hero and earn credits to be able to gain streaming rights is kind of cool.
5335000	5337000	And likely will encourage discovery.
5337000	5344000	That being said, translating this onto other genres without testing and adjustment would be a very, very bad idea.
5344000	5354000	Silent Tom said, I think it would be okay if you just pay a monthly rate for all songs to access songs like Spotify, as long as it's a very long song list.
5354000	5361000	Just so you know, Silent Tom, I think they are going to have something like that for maybe not for a month, but for a couple days, like for people having parties and stuff.
5362000	5373000	Justin or Master Claw replied and said, when I was playing a lot of Rock Band, I used to wish that there was a subscription that allowed access to the entire music library for a monthly fee.
5373000	5378000	If you got to choose what songs you can play, it would have been a good move for them, but not a limited selection.
5378000	5390000	I'm still not getting Guitar Hero, I've always preferred Rock Band and I already have hundreds of dollars in songs and instruments and several years of experience invested in the harmonics franchise.
5390000	5394000	Of course, I don't have an Xbox One or a Playstation 4, so it's a moot point.
5394000	5403000	Fifth Dream says, I had Guitar Hero preordered for a long time. I changed my mind at the last minute and bought Rock Band 4 instead this week, and this was part of the reason.
5403000	5412000	It seems Guitar Hero Live is only having a temporary set of random songs that changes over time, and not a dependable set of songs that you know, like, and will enjoy playing.
5412000	5419000	There is a reason I don't listen to the radio anymore. I rarely like what other people decide I'm supposed to listen to.
5419000	5431000	I guess I'm that guy or I'm just old, but I got Rock Band 4, the first Rock Band game I've ever played, and spent a lot of money on past DLC to get a set of 60 or so songs I already know I love and had a blast playing them.
5431000	5441000	In other words, this subscription DLC for songs I can't predict I'll even like really sounds like a bad idea and turned me off of the game completely, and I cancelled my Guitar Hero Live preorder.
5441000	5444000	Wow, that's voting with your wallet, that's for sure.
5445000	5455000	Andy R. replied and said, a new plan for DLC. Is it new? Based on what they're saying, it sounds similar to the system in Tap Sonic on mobile, which was free, not $90.
5455000	5464000	Yeah, and I think we talked about that a little bit at the beginning of the show is that this is more of something that you would see in mobile games, but yes, very fair point.
5464000	5469000	Mobile games are also oftentimes free, and this is not free.
5469000	5482000	A couple answers over on Google+, including Rettertainment, who says, I just tried searching around for a price on Guitar Hero TV, including looking at the game's official site, and was unable to find one.
5482000	5493000	This isn't right. For the DLC, we are told the price up front. For Spotify, we're told the price up front. For most any other product available through a legitimate company or person, we're told the price up front.
5493000	5496000	Why am I not able to find the price for GHTV?
5496000	5506000	That's a very excellent point, and I guess the easy answer to that is, well, I mean, on the day the game releases, the news will be everywhere about how much it costs.
5506000	5514000	But, I totally understand the point that, well, everybody wants you to pre-order the game. Pre-order the bundle. Guarantee that you're going to get a copy of the game.
5514000	5519000	And I think it's fair to say, well, what's the true cost of the game, because you're not being up front about it.
5519000	5523000	So, I think that's a very fair point Rettertainment raises there.
5524000	5530000	ActDeaf, last but not least, says, this idea sounds neat in concept. We'll have to see how it works in practice.
5530000	5539000	I do think it's a great idea, especially since you don't have to actually pay real money to play them just for a few sessions, or just want to see if a song is actually worth buying or not.
5539000	5543000	But hopefully the prices aren't too high, and the in-game currency isn't really hard to obtain.
5543000	5553000	I do also think that this should be a choice. If someone wants to buy and own the song, so you can play it whenever you want, instead of paying each time, you want to play it.
5553000	5567000	And yeah, with a lot of music, I don't think Spotify lets you buy songs, but Apple Music certainly would link you over to iTunes and let you buy the song for $1.29 or whatever it is that you are going to pay for the song.
5567000	5572000	So, yeah. It would be interesting if you could actually do it both ways.
5572000	5577000	Anyway, some really good answers there. Thank you guys for participating with our FUGL Question of the Week.
5577000	5588000	And if you want to answer for next week, I usually post those on Sunday afternoon over on Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio and Google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio.
5588000	5595000	We've got some more news. Let's get right back into it. Loki's got to put down Mario Maker and read the next story for us.
5595000	5602000	Alright, so the next thing we've got, let's talk a little bit about HoloLens.
5602000	5609000	I swear, it's kind of like the whole Elder Scrolls Online thing. The more I hear about, the less excited I am.
5609000	5620000	So now they were talking about the dev kits that are coming out, and unlike the Oculus Rift, where I was like, ooh, I've got to get me a piece of that dev kit, I'm not going to do that with this.
5620000	5627000	That's because the dev kits, first off, start at $3,000. And they're going to be shipping, I guess, the first quarter of 2016.
5627000	5632000	So if you're interested in making something for HoloLens, that's what it's going to cost you.
5632000	5641000	And, yeah, I don't know. And I'm still kind of pissed off that they're not really upfront with the field of view on that.
5641000	5648000	Because all these demonstrations that they showed, they're just kind of, we have a special camera that we're filming everything with.
5648000	5657000	And it's allowing you to see what's going on. It doesn't represent what you can see actually with the device.
5657000	5664000	And it's like, how long are you going to keep this charade up? I guess until it comes out.
5664000	5669000	I just hope it improves. I hope they are able to make that device something pretty nice.
5669000	5678000	Originally I'm pretty excited about it, but until that field of view is adequate, then I'm not really jumping on board with it.
5678000	5683000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, HoloLens will suck for games.
5683000	5688000	That's a pretty strong statement from someone who's been following a lot of this VR stuff.
5688000	5693000	And yes, I realize HoloLens is not VR, but it's adjacent in my mind.
5693000	5702000	It would be cool for just PC stuff, but yeah, it's just not, I don't know. What they're showing is not exciting.
5702000	5707000	I'm wondering if it's one of those things, and this happens a lot with Kinect and so forth.
5707000	5712000	The first version will not be that great, but the second version, and to be fair, this isn't just Microsoft.
5712000	5717000	Yeah, the first version will be that great, and they'll say, oh, but the second version will do everything that you want it to do.
5717000	5721000	And the second version won't be that great, and then they'll just drop it. Like it never happened.
5721000	5723000	We'll see what happens.
5723000	5732000	Alright, well this week, some folks were surprised to see that Destiny suddenly appeared on their PlayStation 4.
5732000	5737000	But here's the deal. It's not that you just suddenly were given a free copy of Destiny.
5737000	5743000	Destiny was inserted into your bar like any other game because it's basically Sony advertising to you.
5743000	5746000	That's what they call featured content.
5747000	5756000	And if you didn't turn it off, PlayStation 4 will put things that it thinks you're going to like, which I don't, it sounds like everybody got Destiny.
5756000	5759000	I don't know. It's going to put it right there on the bar.
5759000	5763000	Now, remember, if you don't like this stuff, you can turn it off.
5763000	5769000	In the settings menu, you go to system, automatic downloads, and uncheck the box that says featured content.
5769000	5773000	So this kind of stuff will not happen in the future if that pissed you off this week.
5773000	5775000	Or maybe you liked it. I don't know.
5775000	5777000	It didn't piss me off, but it's just like, what the fuck is this?
5777000	5780000	You know, I hope I didn't download anything to go along with it.
5780000	5781000	Right.
5781000	5786000	Because, you know, it said featured content. Does that mean it downloaded that shit to my fucking system?
5786000	5788000	Isn't it just a link to the store?
5788000	5789000	I think it's just a link.
5789000	5791000	Yeah, because I turned that off a long time ago.
5791000	5796000	Well, because I clicked on it and I'm like, what is this? Are they offering this for free or something? Is this like a demo? What the fuck is this?
5796000	5798000	And then I was like, oh, link to buy it. Nope.
5799000	5804000	So a lot of people were surprised at kind of the positioning of that this week. I think it's the first time.
5804000	5813000	Alan Alchemy in chat says, is this like when U2 forced their album onto people's iPhones and everyone was like, get your geriatric Irish bullshit off my shit. What the fuck?
5815000	5818000	Hey now, U2's an okay band.
5818000	5827000	No, because that was different. The U2 thing actually downloaded that album completely, which didn't happen.
5828000	5838000	With Destiny. The whole Destiny game was not downloaded and it certainly wasn't free. That was just a, it was more of a clever ad, I suppose, for lack of a better term.
5838000	5840000	All right, let's move on. Dark Sakura.
5840000	5851000	Well, for people who have been waiting for this, there is kind of sorta support for Cortana in Xbox One.
5851000	5861000	It's not actually, the voice assistant isn't supposed to be available until 2016. However, some people have figured out how to kinda get her working.
5861000	5870000	You can go into the settings menu and going up and mashing the A button multiple times.
5870000	5877000	It doesn't give you the full number of commands, but it gives you some of them, like accessing your calendar.
5878000	5892000	It's really just a minor thing, but it's there. So they've got the beginning hints of it installed, so I guess that's a pretty good thing if you're interested in stuff like that.
5895000	5896000	Loki.
5896000	5904000	I'm not interested in that thing. Like I said, I have that on my Windows 10 PC or laptop and it doesn't do anything.
5904000	5911000	I called Siri, Cortana, just to see what would happen. It was pretty funny. I got a thing that said, haha, very funny, but not funny.
5912000	5915000	Not funny. Note to self, murder you in your sleep.
5915000	5922000	No, I'm actually kinda curious. Now hold on. Hey, Cortana, tell me something.
5924000	5925000	Hello.
5925000	5928000	Okay, she answered to it. Never mind.
5929000	5930000	Ah, Siri.
5930000	5934000	Oh, Siri. Why so Siri-ous? Haha.
5934000	5946000	So apparently according to the publisher of Harvest Moon, Natsume, they're saying that Game Boy games are not being converted to Virtual Console.
5947000	5962000	There, Nintendo has gone and moved beyond that system because this was in regards to someone inquiring about one of their older games, Tailgater, whether that was going to be coming to Virtual Console, and they said, sorry, not going to happen.
5963000	5970000	So if you're looking for some Game Boy games that didn't quite make it there, you're going to have to look to buy a Game Boy.
5971000	5979000	Why would you just stop that? I mean, were they not selling well at all or something? Like, I just, I don't understand where all the money...
5979000	5980000	I don't either, because if...
5980000	5983000	...cost is for this stuff. It doesn't make sense.
5983000	5991000	Yeah, seriously, because it's an emulator. Last I checked, emulators ran that game, so...
5991000	6001000	I mean, I know they do this, they do a manual, and they have to put together on the store, but I would seriously think it would be, like, one person's job.
6001000	6012000	And are they not even making that much money to pay that one person? I mean, I don't know. Maybe I'm a little ignorant to this, but it just seems like the cost should not be that big for Virtual Console. It doesn't make sense at all.
6012000	6016000	And you're making just tons of money off of this stuff. I mean, I don't know.
6017000	6018000	Bobby Blackwolf...
6018000	6027000	Or put the cost... Here's an idea. If the publisher wants to go through all that process and make those, why can't you let the publisher do that?
6027000	6040000	Good point. And Bobby Blackwolf in chat has a counterpoint here. I can answer your question, Skye, with one acronym, ESRB. That costs a lot to get that rating, and they have to get Virtual Console games rated by the ESRB.
6040000	6051000	A fair point that I didn't consider is that they do get all those games rated, and because back in the day, the ESRB didn't exist for most of these games, so they can't, you know, they have to go back and, I guess, get them re-rated.
6051000	6059000	Well, technically, do they have to? Because you can release an unrelated movie, but I guess there's probably some type of agreement.
6059000	6062000	Well, you have to, because it's their company policy not to release NR Games.
6062000	6067000	But, okay, but you still bring up a point. What if Nintendo didn't pay for this, but the publishers did?
6067000	6068000	Exactly.
6068000	6081000	Hmm. Interesting, though. S2100Matt says, it's just like movie ratings. Sometimes studios fight hard to get an under R rating. Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure. Interesting.
6081000	6093000	Well, still, I mean, I would think they're making, but I guess obscure Game Boy games may not sell a whole lot of copies, so maybe that's why they decide not to do it.
6093000	6100000	Maybe they should discount, you know, certain things like that, you know, when they're doing ratings for these old-ass games. I don't know.
6100000	6109000	Yeah, but then are they really going to get that money back? I don't know. Because, you know, then they're making less money off each sale, so they really get the money back.
6109000	6111000	No, I meant the ESRB should charge less.
6111000	6121000	Oh, well, but the ESRB, and Bobby Blackwell says the ESRB needs their money to put on E3, and especially as E3 is getting less and less relevant. I just added that part.
6121000	6132000	Anyway, Jim Sallee in chat over at live.vognetware.com. So good to hear from him. Jim Sallee says, I can rate all virtual console games right now. They suck.
6132000	6136000	Hey, now. Earthbound doesn't suck.
6136000	6138000	Is that S for suck?
6138000	6140000	Rated S for suck.
6140000	6150000	Alright. Let's see. Somebody brought up Sonic earlier. It was one of the Frugal Question of the Week comments.
6150000	6163000	Well, Sonic actually had a Wii U exclusive version, Sonic Lost World. Well, guess what? It is no longer Wii U exclusive, but it didn't hop over to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6163000	6176000	It's going to Steam. That's right. November 2nd, we'll see the Steam release of Sega Sonic Lost World. The game apparently will run at 60 frames a second with full PC gamepad support.
6176000	6184000	Also, it's going to come with a free copy of Sonic Racing Transformed, because why not? They just give that game away now. I think, didn't they do that in a Humble Bundle anyway?
6184000	6198000	But anyway, the game launches on Steam on November 2nd. It will be 20 pounds. I'm assuming that is also like $19.99 in dollars here locally, but we'll see when it actually hits Steam.
6200000	6208000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetware.com, use the passphrase, face.
6209000	6217000	Jim Sally in chat says, more like Sonic Suck World. Tiger Claw says, I have Sonic Lost World, haven't yet got to play it, the Wii U version.
6217000	6224000	Well, you better play it or you might end up falling in that Steam pit where you end up buying a game just because you can.
6224000	6231000	Did me saying the words Humble Bundle cause you to go to the site, Loki, to see if you needed to drop more money on something?
6231000	6238000	No, I just wanted to see what the new games were in 15 that they were just... I didn't buy it because I think I have most of these already.
6238000	6245000	Yeah, I have a lot of the games in that pack. I mean, yay, it's for charity and all that, but yeah, I don't know if I could...
6245000	6253000	That's also why I'm not jumping on the Humble Monthly, because it's like, dude, I probably have most of those.
6254000	6260000	Dungeon Buster in chat, speaking of Sonic, says the Sonic Boom cartoon series was also renewed for a second season.
6260000	6262000	Well, how about that?
6262000	6265000	That just proves kids will watch anything.
6265000	6276000	Alright, let's get to the mailbag. Every week, Dark Sakura dives into the mailbag headfirst and pulls out emails that she thinks are rad and worth sharing, if there are any.
6276000	6279000	I thought there was at least one in there. I don't know, Dark Sakura, do we have an email tonight to read?
6279000	6280000	There's one.
6280000	6286000	Just one. Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to fill up the mailbox for a future week.
6286000	6289000	Hello, LR, which means this is from YYR.
6289000	6303000	Last week, there was a brief discussion on the possibility of Japanese shoot-'em-up or SHMUP developer CAVE turning to crowdfunding to bring more games to Steam and or PS4, or perhaps even developing something new, but not for cheap.
6303000	6309000	SHMUPs, unfortunately, with regard to gameplay depth, do not look like much to the average or casual player.
6309000	6315000	But in reality, it takes cat-like reflexes, nerves of steel- by the way, cat-like, not my cat.
6315000	6328000	Anyway, um, nerves of steel and the ability to discern and memorize patterns and several dozen hours to be able to actually complete a well-designed SHMUP in one credit, the way it was meant to be played.
6328000	6333000	To be able to design a game of this sort takes many, many times longer and a lot of experience.
6333000	6342000	Anyone can throw together a shooting game with random enemy placement to actually make a game of this type that plays well as something not just anyone can do.
6342000	6357000	The music is usually created by composers outside the company, the sound effects are created to perfectly match the action, and the graphics usually consist of hand-drawn, hand-animated sprites from the player characters all the way down to the tiniest popcorn enemies.
6357000	6361000	All of this takes a ton of work and, therefore, money.
6361000	6371000	So this is why I don't believe three million dollars is an unreasonable amount of money to conceive, design, develop, and release an original SHMUP for consoles.
6371000	6378000	Unfortunately, this genre is not as popular as it once was, even in Japan, so CAVE has had some money troubles over the last couple of years.
6378000	6383000	Therefore, crowdfunding might be the only way we'll ever see another original game from them.
6383000	6393000	If you enjoy this sort of game, even a little, I'd encourage you to toss a few bucks their way, and a few bucks their way if they ask for it. I know I will.
6393000	6395000	Keep on shooting, AaronYYR.
6395000	6401000	Okay. We made the point. That's totally what I was, you know, thinking.
6401000	6405000	No, it's a fair point. You know, games aren't cheap to make, that's for sure.
6406000	6416000	You know, I guess it's tricky though, because I do feel like some people have made some pretty competent shooters on a lower budget, just being a team of like one or two people.
6416000	6423000	But I also understand there's a difference, you know, especially the bullet hell SHMUP stuff that really goes to the cult status.
6423000	6428000	Yeah, it definitely has all those things that you're talking about, you know, and especially things like composers and so forth.
6428000	6436000	And hey, voice actors might get really expensive here pretty soon, if, you know, that's even a possibility with what DarkestHacker was talking about earlier.
6436000	6446000	So, you know, yeah, games aren't free to make for big companies that, you know, want to pay their people so they can, you know, feed their families and stuff.
6446000	6453000	So, makes sense. So yeah, if you enjoy that genre and want to see a new game, I can see where the crowdfunding comes in.
6453000	6462000	Just hopefully, you know, the slippery slope with crowdfunding, just because, you know, it's the same company with the same reputation, doesn't mean it's necessarily going to be good.
6462000	6468000	And that's what we're hearing with Mighty No. 9, some people not into it based off the demo, like a little let down.
6468000	6473000	I'm going to say this, slippery slope arguments are by their nature fallacious.
6473000	6482000	I would say, look, the only way that we're going to know if it's going to be successful or not for them to just do it.
6482000	6489000	And if it opens, yeah, someone's always going to be out there to take advantage of an idea or try to cash in on it.
6489000	6499000	But you have to also think that if this is the only way to get it out, if there's no other possible way, then they should, we should encourage them.
6499000	6507000	Yeah, but in Ifune's Mighty No. 9, I mean, I don't think he was ever out to rip anybody off or anything, but maybe learned a lot of hard lessons along the way.
6507000	6514000	And I think it has caused people who donated to that game, even though it's not, the game isn't even out yet, for one, it's not a shooter.
6514000	6522000	I feel like you're seeing this on Facebook and Twitter, you can already feel the repercussions that the game being delivered is not what people expected.
6522000	6525000	And that's going to have an impact on all video game Kickstarters.
6525000	6529000	It, I think it is and it will and won't be.
6529000	6536000	It's just a matter of, I mean, for example, how many games have you bought that just didn't turn out to be what you thought they'd be?
6536000	6538000	I bought one this week.
6538000	6545000	Okay, so this really isn't anything that different, you know.
6545000	6546000	True.
6546000	6551000	Yeah, and there were always beta releases out for the game for Mighty No. 9.
6551000	6555000	People had ideas of what they were getting into if they had the beta access.
6555000	6565000	And then for the other releases coming out, I mean, if you had just gone out and found it on the shelf and bought it, would it have been what you thought it was going to be?
6565000	6567000	There's really no difference.
6567000	6570000	I'm going to our chat over at live.vog.network.com.
6570000	6574000	Dungeonbuster says, Caves shmups are pretty legendary production-wise.
6574000	6577000	They lavish a ton of art, sound, and action in their game.
6577000	6578000	And bullets.
6578000	6580000	So many bullets.
6580000	6586000	Sg100matt says, I just hope all Kickstarters and people thinking of video game crowdfunding learn from these mistakes.
6586000	6587000	That's all I ask.
6587000	6590000	I was happy with Espa-galuda that I could never quite say right.
6590000	6592000	Espa-galuda?
6592000	6593000	Espa-galuda.
6593000	6594000	Espa-galuda.
6594000	6595000	Espa-galuda.
6595000	6598000	I played a crap ton of Espa-galuda.
6598000	6601000	Beluga Whale 2.
6601000	6603000	I can't say it.
6603000	6604000	Alright.
6604000	6608000	If you have some further comments on this or what have you, you can always email us.
6608000	6612000	Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.
6612000	6613000	And that's it for emails.
6613000	6614000	We didn't get a lot this week.
6614000	6617000	Participate at orangelaungeradio.com if you want to send us another one.
6617000	6619000	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
6619000	6623000	Every week we get angsty on the show because reasons.
6649000	6657000	A big FU to people who expect that if you see two characters in a movie or book or anything,
6657000	6662000	that the moment that they show any kind of real affection for each other, it means they're fucking.
6662000	6663000	No.
6663000	6665000	It doesn't mean they're fucking.
6665000	6667000	It means they have a close relationship.
6667000	6669000	Why ruin it?
6669000	6670000	The end.
6670000	6673000	You can do whatever you want with your head cannon.
6673000	6679000	But it says a pretty awful thing about society to say.
6679000	6681000	Alright, Loki.
6681000	6682000	Effie to bad drivers.
6682000	6686000	Especially people that, okay, you maybe missed your turn or something like that.
6686000	6690000	Don't fucking cut over all the lanes to make your turn.
6690000	6694000	Oh shit, I'm going in the off-ramp and I'm in the rightmost lane.
6694000	6698000	Let me cut across all those lanes to get out of the off-ramp.
6698000	6700000	I hate you people.
6700000	6703000	And I was behind all you people today.
6703000	6705000	You suck.
6705000	6709000	Alright Shane, I have to hear this FU that you have tonight.
6709000	6717000	Okay, so FU to whatever head problems I'm having right now because today we went out toy hunting
6717000	6720000	and I bought some donuts and we had some donuts but I had two left over.
6720000	6724000	I had a maple one and this weird mint Oreo one.
6724000	6726000	Both looked really good.
6726000	6734000	So when I got back, I got out of the car and I got dizzy and oops, they fell all over the driveway.
6734000	6736000	I was so sad.
6736000	6738000	You dropped the donuts.
6738000	6743000	Yes, I really wanted the maple one and I was just kind of interested in the mint one.
6743000	6745000	Well, you know what this means.
6745000	6747000	You have to go back and get more donuts.
6747000	6748000	Where was this at?
6748000	6750000	Java time over Maguna.
6750000	6752000	I'm gonna have to go.
6752000	6754000	They have all sorts of crazy donuts.
6754000	6759000	The Oreo one looked like, I just gained a pound looking at it.
6759000	6761000	Well, I could eat half a donut.
6761000	6763000	You could lick some of it off of the driveway.
6763000	6765000	I kind of wanted to do that.
6765000	6769000	I wanted to be like, Shane, I just want to do this bat with the rest of the donuts.
6769000	6772000	Shane, we should go and I'd have half a donut.
6772000	6774000	We could go tomorrow.
6774000	6777000	Okay, I may have to meet someone at lunch but let's go tomorrow.
6777000	6778000	Okay.
6778000	6779000	We'll have breakfast of donuts.
6779000	6780000	Okay.
6780000	6781000	Alright.
6781000	6783000	Sorry, Rob.
6783000	6785000	I didn't even finish.
6785000	6786000	Sorry, G.
6786000	6788000	So FU to Rob for turning off the music before I was done.
6788000	6790000	I didn't even give mine yet but go ahead.
6790000	6792000	Yeah, but you still turned the music off.
6792000	6794000	And FU to Toys R Us for not getting their act together
6794000	6797000	and getting me the Power Ranger toys I deserve
6797000	6800000	because one of the stores had them one day
6800000	6803000	and I missed out and got two instead of all five
6803000	6805000	and now nobody's getting them
6805000	6811000	and I just want to be very mad and yell at them.
6811000	6812000	Alright.
6812000	6814000	My FU of the Week goes to Shane for being an enabler.
6814000	6815000	Heroes Power.
6815000	6817000	Both with donuts and amiibo.
6817000	6819000	Heroes Power.
6819000	6821000	Not something you can control.
6821000	6822000	That's really it.
6822000	6823000	Things are awesome otherwise.
6823000	6825000	I guess FU to my voice this morning
6825000	6827000	because I did Rocky last night and I actually sound okay now
6827000	6830000	because I had some hot coffee and all that.
6830000	6832000	But yeah, boy oh boy.
6832000	6833000	But it was a great show.
6833000	6835000	I can't say anything FU about that
6835000	6838000	and I'm very excited about Sinister Creature Con here in Sacramento
6838000	6839000	here locally if you're a local listener.
6839000	6841000	I will be there at Sinister Creature Con this weekend
6841000	6843000	in Sacramento at Scottish Rite
6843000	6847000	and also hosting Rocky Horror again on Halloween.
6847000	6849000	So there's my cheap plug.
6849000	6850000	FU to cheap plug.
6850000	6851000	Steal with it.
6851000	6852000	Alright.
6852000	6855000	Let's get to a couple more stories here
6855000	6858000	before we take your calls at 1877 Game OLR
6858000	6859000	or username on Skype.
6859000	6861000	Orange Lounge Radio.
6861000	6862000	All one word.
6862000	6865000	First we'll go over to Loki.
6865000	6869000	Yes, since we were talking about Mario Maker a little bit.
6869000	6874000	There has been an individual that remade all of the e-reader levels
6874000	6876000	from the Game Boy Advance version of the game
6876000	6878000	and you can check them out now.
6878000	6882000	So these are all the levels from Super Mario Advance 4
6882000	6886000	and they're available to check out.
6886000	6891000	There's a Reddit post in the Wii U thread
6891000	6894000	that's got a Super Mario 3 e-card.
6894000	6896000	It's all levels redone.
6896000	6900000	And you can download or jot down all the different codes
6900000	6903000	to download those levels to play them.
6903000	6904000	That's pretty cool.
6904000	6905000	I have to be honest.
6905000	6907000	I totally forgot about the e-reader levels
6907000	6910000	until this story and I was like, oh yeah.
6910000	6913000	I've seen a lot of people remaking Super Mario Land levels too
6913000	6915000	even though they can't really
6915000	6917000	because there was different mechanics in Super Mario Land
6917000	6921000	but it's interesting to see people doing that I think.
6922000	6924000	All right.
6924000	6927000	Well, speaking of Mario Maker,
6927000	6930000	is the creator mad at you for all the hard levels
6930000	6932000	that you're making in Mario Maker?
6932000	6933000	I hope so.
6933000	6940000	Lead producer Takashi Tezuka has stated some opinions in Edge Magazine
6940000	6941000	saying, quote,
6941000	6943000	There is a tendency for the courses people make
6943000	6946000	to be a little harder than they think they are.
6946000	6948000	The creator already knows the design,
6948000	6951000	where they've placed their traps, and the best route to take.
6951000	6954000	So it would generally be easier for them to play through
6954000	6956000	than someone trying it for the first time.
6956000	6959000	As a result, the course ends up being more difficult
6959000	6961000	than the creator meant it to be.
6961000	6963000	You know, I think that's exactly what happened with my Bowser Man level.
6963000	6966000	I didn't set out for it to be so hard
6966000	6970000	but because I designed it, I kind of knew the easy way through it
6970000	6974000	and I got poop drawn on my level by Japanese players because of it.
6974000	6975000	So I guess I learned my lesson.
6975000	6977000	Yeah, but we learned it from you
6977000	6979000	because you made Super Mario Brothers 2
6979000	6981000	which we call the lost levels here.
6981000	6983000	We learned it from you!
6983000	6985000	Yeah, that's right. We learned it from you, Japan,
6985000	6986000	so stop pooping on my levels.
6986000	6988000	Like, actually pooping on my levels.
6988000	6993000	I just heard the tale end when you were looking at it.
6993000	6995000	Oh, look! A Japanese comment!
6995000	6997000	It's poop!
6997000	6999000	Poop is universal, Rob.
6999000	7001000	Should I report that comment or should I favorite it?
7001000	7003000	You should favorite it.
7003000	7004000	I'm going to favorite it.
7004000	7005000	Alright.
7005000	7006000	That would be great.
7006000	7008000	Try with more poop.
7008000	7011000	Like, we can have a conversation in poop.
7011000	7016000	Anyway, somebody's listening to OLR for the first time
7016000	7020000	going, what the fuck podcast did I subscribe to?
7020000	7023000	I'm probably going to have some splainin' to do at work.
7023000	7026000	It's like pissing into an ocean of piss.
7026000	7027000	Oh, I'm sorry. That's right.
7027000	7030000	You said you might have friends listening tonight.
7030000	7031000	Hi, Travis!
7031000	7032000	Whoops!
7032000	7033000	Hi, Travis.
7033000	7034000	Alright.
7034000	7036000	Anyhow, oh, I do want to point out, though,
7036000	7038000	Tezuka did not finish his thought with that,
7038000	7040000	so let's hear the other half, because it's important.
7040000	7043000	I've been watching lots of different courses on YouTube.
7043000	7046000	It was quite a surprise how much fun it was to watch the videos
7046000	7048000	without even playing myself.
7048000	7051000	There are so many intriguing and inventive courses,
7051000	7054000	like one which you couldn't beat if you picked up a mushroom.
7054000	7057000	It's been a huge motivation for us developers to do better.
7057000	7059000	That's so amazing that you watch videos on YouTube
7059000	7061000	of other people playing levels,
7061000	7065000	and you thought that was amazing and inspired people to play the game.
7065000	7066000	Oh, my God!
7066000	7070000	You mean that there's some merit to these fucking levels?
7070000	7071000	You fucking idiot!
7071000	7074000	You fuck, fuck, fucking idiots!
7074000	7076000	And I know it's not you in particular,
7076000	7081000	but fuck the people that are in the fucking higher-up chain of Nintendo for...
7081000	7082000	Yeah.
7082000	7084000	Dark Sakura, sigh all you want,
7084000	7086000	but that was a pretty fucking good zing.
7086000	7087000	That was.
7087000	7089000	You're going to need some ointment for that burn.
7089000	7091000	I hope you know that, you know,
7091000	7093000	Nintendo's making money off of that ad revenue.
7093000	7095000	Thanks a lot, you know.
7098000	7099000	I love it.
7099000	7102000	Some folks in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.
7102000	7104000	Orange Wright says,
7104000	7108000	You mean it would be beneficial to let people make YouTube videos of your games?
7108000	7109000	Necessary100Matt says,
7109000	7110000	Keep going, Loki.
7110000	7114000	And Act F has sounded the Loki O.L.R. rant alarm.
7116000	7117000	There you go.
7117000	7119000	Hey, you know what?
7119000	7121000	I'm sorry if you blew your eardrums out,
7121000	7123000	but the man has a very good point,
7123000	7126000	and that was a good time to bring that up, so...
7126000	7128000	It's just a little hypocritical of them.
7128000	7131000	I mean, to be honest, this is the developer.
7131000	7132000	It's not him personally.
7132000	7134000	No, it's not him. It's not him.
7134000	7136000	And let's be honest, this guy,
7136000	7139000	he's probably a little bit more open-minded to everything than some of the management.
7139000	7142000	But seriously, the management needs to kind of get on board with that.
7142000	7143000	That's ridiculous.
7143000	7144000	That's a really good call-out.
7144000	7146000	I'm surprised more journalists didn't pick up on that.
7146000	7147000	All right.
7147000	7149000	Anyhow, that's it.
7149000	7152000	That actually brings us to our last story, appropriately.
7152000	7154000	But we are going to open up the Skype line.
7154000	7157000	We're actually to the last part of the show a little early tonight.
7157000	7158000	We're going in pretty quick.
7158000	7159000	We're starting late, too.
7159000	7160000	Yeah, we started late, too,
7160000	7162000	because Bobby had his 500th episode, so it's worse.
7162000	7165000	Because you didn't let me talk about Power Rangers for an hour.
7165000	7166000	Well, here's your chance.
7166000	7167000	We're waiting for a call, so...
7167000	7169000	You remember when we were going to do a podcast about Mass Effect,
7169000	7171000	and then that, like, didn't happen?
7171000	7173000	Yeah, I remember the pilot episode I actually guested on,
7173000	7174000	and I was like, wow.
7174000	7175000	It was because Rob was so bad on it.
7175000	7176000	He was so bad on it.
7176000	7177000	You guys really...
7177000	7180000	You know, and some people I knew were like,
7180000	7182000	how can you do a podcast about a game
7182000	7185000	that is essentially going to be dormant for like five years?
7185000	7186000	Don't judge us.
7186000	7189000	But after doing that first episode, I was like, wow.
7189000	7192000	You could make a podcast out of this pretty regularly,
7192000	7193000	and then you didn't.
7193000	7196000	Okay, but let's talk about something else real quick.
7196000	7197000	Where is that episode?
7197000	7199000	Can we put it up somewhere so people can hear it?
7199000	7201000	I think I have it somewhere on my computer.
7201000	7202000	I don't think I have it.
7202000	7204000	I found our show role from it, though.
7204000	7205000	That's funny.
7205000	7207000	Can we do, like, a long-lost Mass Effect?
7207000	7208000	But what the hell was the show called?
7208000	7209000	I forget.
7209000	7210000	We called it.
7210000	7211000	This is the best podcast on the Citadel.
7211000	7212000	Oh, we just had the best podcast on the Citadel.
7212000	7214000	My favorite podcast on the Citadel.
7214000	7216000	And I did the Corian voice, remember?
7216000	7219000	I had the filter for the Corian voice.
7219000	7220000	So I actually have news.
7220000	7221000	What?
7221000	7224000	Because I forgot to say this earlier.
7224000	7228000	The super awesome pre-orders for Super Beat Zonic
7228000	7231000	went up a couple days ago,
7231000	7234000	and that is made by the people that make DJ Max,
7234000	7237000	since DJ Max is now something that doesn't exist anymore.
7237000	7239000	Was that that livestream you were watching the other night?
7239000	7242000	Yeah, they livestreamed it so we could kind of see what it's about,
7242000	7247000	even though it still doesn't have, like, a release date beyond fall of this year.
7247000	7250000	But they put up two versions beyond the regular.
7250000	7254000	There's one that's $50 called the exclusive limited edition.
7254000	7256000	It comes with the game and the soundtrack.
7256000	7260000	And there's one that's $100 that comes with the game,
7260000	7265000	the soundtrack, and then the soundtrack on vinyl and a very fancy box.
7265000	7268000	And the vinyl, it's two vinyls.
7268000	7271000	And there's only 450 of those, 500 of the other.
7271000	7276000	And there's also a golden ticket that they're putting into two of them.
7276000	7280000	And if you get one of those tickets, you get the Corian limited edition,
7280000	7283000	which I'm trying to pull up right now, because this is a Corian game
7283000	7285000	because it's DJ Max people.
7285000	7288000	The Corian limited edition makes all of us cry
7288000	7291000	because we don't get these cool things.
7291000	7293000	The Corian limited edition.
7293000	7297000	You get the game in a huge box.
7297000	7302000	You get either a blue Vita that we're getting from GameStop
7302000	7304000	or an orange one, it looks like.
7304000	7306000	They said red, but it looks orange.
7306000	7310000	The soundtrack, no vinyl, all these little postcard things.
7310000	7313000	It looks like a memory card as well, and it's very pretty.
7313000	7317000	And I hope I get one of those golden tickets.
7317000	7320000	Act Efton Chat says, do you get to go to the Willy Wonka factory with that golden ticket?
7320000	7322000	I wouldn't want to.
7322000	7325000	All the kids died. Well, they didn't die, they cartoon died.
7325000	7327000	I never saw that movie, so I just don't want to go there.
7327000	7329000	I read the book when I was a kid.
7329000	7331000	The book was pretty good. I've read the book after that too.
7331000	7335000	I just know the Futurama version of it.
7335000	7341000	1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
7341000	7343000	I thought there were all these people that wanted to call in tonight,
7343000	7345000	and it's dead on the line tonight.
7345000	7350000	This is the part where I go, is the phone line working?
7350000	7353000	And so I actually put in the number to call to make sure.
7353000	7355000	Oh, we have a call coming in.
7355000	7357000	Is that you calling us?
7357000	7359000	No, it's not me. It says the name of the caller, so I'm going to get to it right now.
7359000	7361000	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
7361000	7363000	Hey, this is Act Eft.
7363000	7366000	It's clearly Kirby. I'm looking at the picture.
7366000	7369000	Yeah, it's Act Eft wearing a Kirby disguise.
7369000	7371000	Oh.
7371000	7376000	Kirby swallowed Act Eft and now has Act Eft's voice and powers.
7376000	7378000	We'll leave it to your imagination.
7378000	7380000	Act Eft, what are your powers?
7380000	7387000	Buying an amiibo, speaking Spanish, playing taiko, no tatsujin.
7387000	7389000	Yeah, all that stuff.
7389000	7395000	His specialty is bartering for amiibo at the market in Spanish.
7395000	7396000	Yeah.
7396000	7398000	There you go. I'm combining all those things into one thing.
7398000	7400000	What's on your mind tonight, my friend?
7400000	7403000	Well, first, welcome to the amiibo club.
7403000	7405000	Gee.
7405000	7409000	I swear, somebody's going to produce the audio clip of me a year ago going,
7409000	7415000	Fuck amiibo, fuck me, if I ever get into that amiibo thing, I want you to hit me upside the head with a baseball bat,
7415000	7417000	or whatever I probably said a year ago, and now here I am.
7417000	7419000	It took me longer than you.
7419000	7426000	Well, now that I can walk into a store and there's a selection, it doesn't seem so irritating.
7426000	7428000	You all right?
7428000	7430000	I was going to say something.
7430000	7431000	What were you going to say? What?
7431000	7434000	I was going to say, but how many times have you walked into a store and found something,
7434000	7437000	versus me looking for Power Rangers, texting, like, do you need this one?
7437000	7439000	You know what? That's okay.
7439000	7444000	If Shane wants to be my personal shopping assistant, I'm actually okay with that.
7444000	7446000	That would be so fun to do.
7446000	7450000	He may think it's his hero's power, but I'm making him do all the legwork for me.
7450000	7452000	Who's really better than me?
7452000	7454000	It's not legwork for you when I'm looking for myself.
7454000	7457000	And then, oh, no Power Rangers toys, let me look at the amiibos.
7457000	7460000	Okay, let me spread the amiibo around.
7460000	7464000	Now, he didn't talk about this on the show, but since we're stretching for time tonight,
7464000	7467000	because we didn't fill three hours, I will point this out.
7467000	7472000	Shane also did me a favor, because I did Rocky Horror this weekend,
7472000	7478000	and one of my cast members actually said, I'm looking for the Brad pop doll.
7478000	7481000	You know those pop doll things? I have some of them here in studio,
7481000	7485000	but they're the little pop culture things. They have the big heads and all that.
7485000	7491000	Well, they put out a Rocky Horror set, and this girl on cast, she's a big black girl,
7491000	7492000	and she's amazing.
7492000	7493000	Is it from Monet?
7493000	7494000	It's Monet, yeah.
7494000	7501000	And she played Brad, which is, if you picture it, is kind of humorous, but she sold it.
7501000	7505000	She's one of my favorite Brad's I've ever seen in the role.
7505000	7509000	So anyway, she wanted a Brad pop figure, and she couldn't find it.
7509000	7511000	They had a bunch of them at Toys R Us.
7511000	7515000	And that's why I said, wait a minute, Shane texted me a picture the other day.
7515000	7520000	He saw those figures in a Toys R Us, and I thought it was very nice that Shane saw something Rocky Horror,
7520000	7524000	and actually acknowledged it and sent it to me, because usually he's embarrassed on my behalf.
7524000	7525000	It had some GameStop.
7525000	7530000	But I said, Shane, hey, while you're out on your next toy run, I'm looking for this pop doll.
7530000	7535000	If you find it, let me know. First store he goes to, he's like, I got you that Brad doll.
7535000	7540000	And I gave it to her last night, and she was so, so, so happy. So there you go.
7540000	7541000	Hooray, story.
7541000	7544000	There you go. Anyway.
7544000	7548000	So where were we? Did we ever get the question you were going to ask here?
7548000	7550000	I don't even remember my question.
7550000	7552000	He was just rubbing it in that you buy amiibos.
7552000	7554000	Oh yeah, that's right.
7554000	7560000	I was going to talk about this recent amiibo restock. It was pretty, pretty good.
7560000	7562000	It's how it should always be, right?
7562000	7568000	Doesn't it seem, though, I mean, not to be that jaded gamer, but oh fucking well,
7568000	7572000	I guess I'm doing, I'm filling that role tonight.
7572000	7574000	Doesn't Nintendo always fucking do this?
7574000	7581000	The first year is a shit show for trying to get the merchandise, like the Nintendo Wii itself,
7581000	7586000	and then we're a year out, and oh, it's like there was never a problem in the first place.
7586000	7591000	I mean, granted, you can't get every figure you want, but it's a lot more reasonable now
7591000	7595000	than it was when these figures first came out. You know what I mean?
7595000	7599000	Like, if you put a little effort into it, you can get just about anything you want,
7599000	7603000	save some of the original pressings from a while ago, you know what I mean?
7603000	7607000	Or the ones you thought were going to be around for forever and somehow aren't anymore, Samus and Link.
7607000	7610000	Yeah, but Samus and Link weren't hard to find in the beginning.
7610000	7612000	No, they weren't, and now it's like...
7612000	7613000	Oops.
7613000	7614000	Yeah.
7614000	7617000	It's curious that Kirby is now one of the rarest ones to find.
7617000	7618000	Yep.
7618000	7622000	You cannot find a Kirby right now, at least for a retail price.
7622000	7626000	But they'll probably restock, you know, early next year. Amiibo aren't going to go away anytime soon,
7626000	7628000	and Smash Brothers is by far the biggest line.
7628000	7631000	The only thing is that I just worry Nintendo's like,
7631000	7635000	oh, you know, we're not always going to have these out, we're going to offer cards instead.
7635000	7639000	Well, if they can just do what they did this time with restocks and just do that for all of them,
7639000	7643000	like, on a cycle, that would be fine too. I don't see a problem with that.
7643000	7645000	I don't want cards. I want the figures.
7645000	7646000	I don't want cards either.
7646000	7652000	I mean, I get that the cards are a good way for people that want the functionality to be able to have,
7652000	7653000	which is fine and dandy, but...
7653000	7657000	I didn't even have a game that worked with Amiibo until just recently, but I've had Amiibo for forever, so...
7657000	7660000	Do they work in Woolly World? I mean, I know the Yoshi's do.
7660000	7661000	Yeah, they unlock costumes.
7661000	7666000	I need to try my cards, because I have the card reader for my DS.
7666000	7670000	But they work, the Yoshi gets costumes.
7670000	7671000	Oh, this is like Mario Maker.
7671000	7673000	Some of them are cute, some of them are frightening.
7673000	7674000	Yeah.
7675000	7679000	I need to still go back to Mario Kart 8, because now I have all these Amiibo I didn't have before,
7679000	7683000	and go unlock all the costumes I have yet to do. Anyway...
7683000	7689000	Yeah, unlocking all the Amiibo costumes on Super Mario Maker, especially with all the ones I have,
7689000	7691000	it was, like, kind of tedious.
7691000	7692000	Yeah, yeah.
7692000	7694000	Because, yeah, but...
7694000	7701000	But, even though with the restock, hopefully, yeah, at least it's not gonna be hard to find,
7701000	7707000	or at least some of the really hard to find will be easier.
7707000	7713000	Hopefully it will get better, but we don't know. Hopefully it will, but who knows?
7713000	7716000	Or more games that come out centered around those hard-to-find ones,
7716000	7723000	like with the supposed villager restock coming on the 8th of next month in time for the Animal Crossing Wii U game.
7723000	7724000	Yeah.
7724000	7730000	Or, like, maybe the Fire Emblem 4 will all come back when the Fates game comes out next year.
7730000	7734000	I'm really curious to see, though, how this translates going into NX,
7734000	7736000	because this has been so huge for Nintendo.
7736000	7737000	They'll use it, for sure.
7737000	7743000	They'll have Amiibo, but what scary thing are they gonna think of next for this, you know?
7743000	7746000	As long as, I mean, at least the figures...
7746000	7750000	$12 is really not a lot of money for those figures, when you think about it.
7750000	7751000	I don't think so, anyway.
7751000	7754000	I mean, that, okay, you remember that little, today at Toys R Us,
7754000	7757000	they had that little 8-bit pillow that was, like, the link sprite?
7757000	7758000	It was super cute, yeah.
7758000	7762000	And, yeah, it looks cute, but then up close, I was like, it's a tiny pillow,
7762000	7764000	and you kind of squeeze it, and it's not very soft.
7764000	7768000	It's kind of a, I don't know what the hell it is, just something that would sit on a bookshelf or something.
7768000	7770000	You know, it was $16.
7770000	7771000	Yeah.
7771000	7774000	And I kind of think Amiibo are a better value than that pillow.
7774000	7777000	It's one of those World of Nintendo ones, right?
7777000	7778000	Yeah, it was.
7778000	7784000	Yeah, I'm kind of surprised there's, like, a following for those,
7784000	7787000	because some of them are really hard to find.
7787000	7789000	Have you seen the Metroid one, the actual Metroid one?
7789000	7792000	Yes, that you can't find anywhere now.
7792000	7794000	Yeah, those are really hard to find.
7794000	7796000	Yeah, that Metroid was so cute.
7796000	7799000	I saw it once, I didn't think anything of it, and now I've never seen it again.
7799000	7801000	Brad from Pod Culture says,
7801000	7805000	I want the Power A Amiibo N-level display, but 30 bucks?
7805000	7806000	Is that the one I own?
7806000	7807000	That's the one, yeah.
7807000	7809000	I gotta say, I like that thing a lot, though.
7809000	7810000	It is cool.
7810000	7811000	It is really cute.
7811000	7812000	I wish they'd make more things like it.
7812000	7813000	I need more.
7813000	7816000	I saw at Best Buy, they have warp pipes now that you can buy.
7816000	7817000	What?
7817000	7821000	Yeah, you can put warp pipes on, I'm not sure you can put them on those,
7821000	7823000	but you can place them and put the Amiibo in them.
7823000	7825000	Okay, you might need to go to Best Buy for me tomorrow.
7825000	7827000	I probably was going to go the best way.
7827000	7828000	See what I mean?
7828000	7832000	There's supposed to be more Amiibo displays like that one.
7832000	7836000	There's one for Zelda, and I think there's one for Kirby.
7836000	7841000	I remember seeing them, or at least reported on when it was the 3 this year.
7841000	7848000	So yeah, there's going to be more of them, but they haven't been released other than the Mario one.
7848000	7852000	Yeah, I don't know if you've seen the shelf that I'm now keeping my Amiibo on.
7852000	7856000	I had to switch out from a table, now it's a shelf, and it's kind of like a weak shelf.
7856000	7862000	It's like one of these really pick up, I need to get a legit better way to display my Amiibo, and it's kind of, I don't know.
7862000	7864000	You think you have problems?
7864000	7868000	Alan has to be rolling his eyes to the back of his head at this whole thing.
7868000	7869000	I can hear it.
7869000	7877000	Like I was saying, if you have problems, you should ask me, because I don't even have a really big space to handle all my Amiibo.
7877000	7882000	I have them all over my room, so yeah.
7882000	7887000	Brad from Pod Culture and Chat says, can anyone find a Mega Man Amiibo for me?
7887000	7889000	I'm not paying scalper prices.
7889000	7898000	I think Amazon has Mega Man for a decent price, if you don't care if it's American or Japanese.
7898000	7908000	I see Mega Man in the wild occasionally still, so it might be a little hard to find, but I'll keep an eye out.
7908000	7912000	Alright, you gotta connect with Shane on Twitter, Brad.
7912000	7915000	I wanted one until I scanned it in, and then I'm done, so I don't need one.
7915000	7918000	Aw, it's so cute. That was my second Amiibo I've ever had.
7918000	7923000	And by the way, in Mario Maker, don't forget to push up, because the sprites all do different things when you push up.
7923000	7924000	I didn't realize that until-
7924000	7925000	Up and down.
7925000	7926000	Oh, and down?
7926000	7927000	Yeah, and down as well.
7927000	7930000	They do squatty things sometimes, depending on what it is.
7930000	7931000	Alright.
7931000	7938000	SJ100Matt in Chat says, if you have problems, Rob, I feel bad for you, son. I got 99 problems and having an Amiibo ain't one.
7938000	7939000	Well, thank you.
7939000	7941000	Because you can't stop at one Amiibo.
7941000	7944000	Brad from Pod Culture says, Shane, grab one. I'll pay you back.
7944000	7952000	You know, if you found one of these Power Ranger toys Shane is looking for, he'll buy you more than a Mega Man Amiibo, I'm sure.
7952000	7954000	That sounded vaguely sexual.
7955000	7957000	Not anything freaky. Alright.
7957000	7960000	ActDeaf, I'm gonna let you go so we can try to get some more calls, but thanks for calling in.
7960000	7962000	Hey, thanks for having me.
7962000	7963000	Yeah, take care, buddy.
7965000	7971000	Alright. 1877GameOLR, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you want to give the show a call.
7971000	7976000	Super jealous of the Korean box art for Super Beat Zonic. It looks so much better than ours.
7976000	7981000	You know, some people are talking about Zonic in Chat, MXC saying, I preordered the Zonic edition, I'm bad.
7982000	7986000	ActDeaf in Chat saying, it does look nice, I kind of want it.
7986000	7987000	So, there you go.
7987000	7988000	It's exciting.
7988000	7989000	It is exciting.
7989000	7991000	Hey, we got another call on the line coming in, let's get to it.
7991000	7993000	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
7997000	8002000	Oh, I feel blessed. Blessed, I hear a train pulling up to the station.
8004000	8007000	Oh, we even have video here in studio. Amazing.
8011000	8012000	I'm Sally!
8012000	8016000	Jim Sally! What is so good? Where the hell have you been?
8017000	8019000	Dude, I've been on a journey.
8020000	8021000	A spiritual journey?
8021000	8024000	I went places I never thought I would go before.
8024000	8026000	Oh, so you're playing Ingress 2?
8026000	8027000	What?
8027000	8028000	Never mind.
8030000	8032000	What kind of journey did you go on?
8035000	8036000	A sentimental journey.
8036000	8038000	A sense of something journey.
8039000	8041000	Was it a sexy journey?
8041000	8042000	It was a little bit.
8044000	8045000	I had a fucking...
8045000	8047000	Do you want to know it's gross?
8047000	8049000	Do you want to know how gross you want to get?
8049000	8050000	Why not?
8050000	8052000	It's after dark right now.
8052000	8054000	It probably gets pretty gross.
8054000	8056000	I'm going to tell you though, because I love you.
8056000	8057000	Alright.
8059000	8063000	You know how your body is full of like, you know, arteries and shit?
8063000	8064000	Yeah.
8064000	8065000	Yeah?
8065000	8068000	Well, I had one of my arteries get a little fucking full.
8068000	8069000	Uh oh.
8069000	8073000	It got kind of big and then it stopped things from happening.
8073000	8074000	Uh oh.
8075000	8079000	Dude, it was in my, my, my, my, my taint.
8079000	8081000	Oh my gosh. Oh no.
8082000	8086000	And I had it for like months and I didn't know I had it. It was just in there.
8086000	8087000	And it stopped.
8088000	8092000	It's embarrassing to talk about, but it stopped my testosterone for a little bit, dude.
8092000	8094000	And I didn't know what was going on.
8095000	8096000	Wow.
8096000	8102000	Well, thank God you got to, I mean, you look great and you are out around and moving and doing your train dance and everything.
8102000	8103000	So thank God you found it.
8103000	8112000	And the doctors, you know, and yes, the human bodies are crazy things and some of it's a little embarrassing to talk about, but shit happens, literally.
8112000	8114000	Dude, I was getting strange.
8114000	8118000	My wife was pregnant and shit and I thought I was having like sympathy pregnancies or something.
8118000	8120000	I don't know what was happening.
8121000	8132000	It was one of those things where it's like you, you were, I've heard about this before where, where women get pregnant and then the husbands have like this really like deep connection to it where they feel like they're pregnant too.
8132000	8133000	Yeah.
8134000	8136000	Hey, and look at that over in chat.
8137000	8139000	There's nobody that's ewing you out in chat.
8139000	8142000	We have, I'm glad you're okay, Jim Sally.
8142000	8145000	Right on. Me too, man. It was scary.
8145000	8146000	All right. Well, you're all better now.
8146000	8148000	So what's on your mind tonight, buddy?
8148000	8149000	Okay. Boom.
8149000	8151000	Yeah. Boom. Muscles. Muscles.
8151000	8152000	I get fucking excited.
8152000	8154000	Listen, what's up today?
8154000	8157000	We're going to have a, we're going to have some bad fucking Bobby trivia.
8157000	8158000	Whoa. Whoa.
8158000	8162000	Cause, cause Bobby Black Wolf just celebrated 500 episodes, right?
8162000	8163000	That's right, buddy.
8163000	8165000	He had a great show tonight.
8165000	8166000	He did.
8166000	8168000	So yes, some Bobby Black Wolf trivia.
8168000	8172000	So you've brought some Black Wolf trivia tonight to the show to celebrate?
8172000	8175000	I got some delicious Bobby Black Wolf trivia.
8175000	8176000	All right.
8176000	8177000	So how are we going to do this?
8177000	8178000	You going to ask questions?
8178000	8180000	We're going to see who here in studio gets it right?
8180000	8186000	Yeah, but you guys like give it a little bit for the chatters to try to catch up to see if they can answer the questions.
8186000	8187000	Never.
8187000	8188000	First question. First question.
8188000	8189000	All right.
8189000	8191000	What is the name of, this is the easy round.
8191000	8198000	What is the name of the instrument Bobby Black Wolf plays and what sports team does he play it for?
8198000	8199000	Hmm.
8199000	8200000	I know. I know.
8200000	8202000	Oh, does Shane know?
8202000	8204000	Does Shane know?
8204000	8207000	By the way, I also would like to know if Travis knows.
8207000	8212000	Travis, if you're out there, go on Skype and tell us if you know the answer.
8212000	8215000	Travis Donovan would never admit he listens to OLR.
8215000	8218000	Is that the Travis that's listening?
8218000	8223000	If Travis Donovan's out there listening, he would never admit that he's listening to OLR.
8223000	8224000	Travis, you've changed, man.
8224000	8227000	Just let people know you listen to OLR.
8227000	8229000	I tell lots of people that.
8229000	8230000	I put it on my resume.
8230000	8233000	Like, don't worry about it, Travis.
8233000	8234000	All right.
8234000	8237000	The instrument Bobby plays and what team he plays for.
8237000	8238000	Anybody want to?
8238000	8240000	I know this, but what do you guys want to say?
8240000	8242000	He plays the zither for Manchester United.
8242000	8244000	That is not true and you know it.
8244000	8245000	I know what he plays.
8245000	8246000	What does he play?
8246000	8248000	He plays drums for the Atlanta Falcons.
8248000	8249000	That's right.
8249000	8251000	He plays percussion for the Atlanta Falcons.
8251000	8253000	Beautiful answer.
8253000	8254000	Let's get a little more obscure there.
8254000	8256000	This is the medium round.
8256000	8257000	All right.
8257000	8260000	Bobby started his show 10 years ago almost.
8260000	8261000	It's a long time ago.
8261000	8262000	It is.
8262000	8265000	The world was a different place.
8265000	8269000	Gas was fucking like $3 a liter or some shit.
8269000	8270000	Or what was it?
8270000	8271000	A gallon?
8271000	8272000	$2 a gallon?
8272000	8274000	Yeah, we don't have that liter stuff here.
8274000	8276000	It was like $2 a gallon.
8276000	8278000	Yeah, it was cheap.
8278000	8280000	Bobby was fresh out of college.
8280000	8281000	He was good looking.
8281000	8282000	His beard was just little.
8282000	8284000	It wasn't quite Doug Bynum yet.
8284000	8286000	He's still good looking.
8286000	8287000	You know what I mean?
8287000	8288000	He's 29 still.
8288000	8291000	What kind of car did Bobby Blockwolf drive?
8292000	8296000	If you listen to the show back then, you wouldn't know it because he talked about it a few times.
8296000	8297000	I know because I rode in it.
8297000	8299000	I think it was the same car.
8299000	8303000	I always think of Bobby Blackwolf in that car when I think of Bobby Blackwolf.
8303000	8304000	Nobody drives now.
8304000	8306000	When Bobby started the show, what was he driving?
8308000	8309000	I know what it is.
8309000	8310000	A whambulance.
8310000	8312000	A whambulance?
8314000	8316000	This is why you get fired from shows by Bobby.
8316000	8318000	I was trying to think of a funny car.
8319000	8321000	That was a pretty good car.
8321000	8323000	Brad from Pod Culture is right in the chat.
8323000	8324000	It was a Mustang.
8324000	8325000	I know that.
8325000	8326000	Oh, that's right.
8326000	8327000	Mustang convertible.
8327000	8328000	It was.
8328000	8329000	Alright.
8330000	8333000	Do you want the super ultra hard question now?
8333000	8334000	Sure.
8336000	8340000	What is Bobby Blackwolf's social insurance number?
8342000	8344000	No, that's not a super hard question.
8345000	8347000	212 fuck you.
8347000	8349000	That's the social security number.
8350000	8356000	The super hard question today is what game is Jim Salley talking about when Jim Salley
8356000	8359000	is in Bobby Blackwolf's intro?
8361000	8363000	Oh, shit.
8363000	8364000	See what I mean?
8364000	8365000	This one's good.
8365000	8366000	You've heard it.
8366000	8367000	Is that the one that's Halo?
8367000	8369000	Is Jim Salley the one talking about Halo?
8369000	8370000	I'm going to say Halo.
8370000	8371000	It's Halo.
8373000	8375000	That's what Actif says.
8375000	8376000	Halo.
8376000	8377000	Halo.
8378000	8380000	Halo is the answer.
8380000	8381000	That is correct.
8381000	8382000	That is correct.
8382000	8384000	Rob, three for three, buddy.
8384000	8386000	Bobby and I are tight.
8386000	8387000	We started a network together.
8387000	8388000	What can I say?
8389000	8392000	I did not think you would get that last one, buddy.
8392000	8393000	Oh, my God.
8394000	8398000	No, well, I've heard that intro an awful lot.
8398000	8399000	What can I say?
8399000	8400000	That is true.
8400000	8403000	That intro has stood the test of time.
8403000	8406000	That's the kind of influence Jim Salley can have on a show.
8406000	8407000	It has.
8407000	8412000	I always laugh at Bobby's new intro because instead of streaming all the good calls together,
8412000	8417000	he's, I don't want to say you had a bad call, Jim, but he's, no, he's, but he's streamed
8417000	8420000	like, okay, he's got like the person who cuts out.
8420000	8422000	He's got the person he's like, he doesn't agree with.
8422000	8423000	I scared Jim Salley off.
8423000	8431000	I didn't, I didn't mean that he put a lot of like, I don't know, like not so great,
8431000	8432000	great moments together.
8433000	8434000	Like that.
8434000	8435000	That makes sense.
8436000	8438000	Oh, Jim Salley's crying.
8438000	8440000	I didn't mean it like that.
8441000	8442000	Come back, Jim Salley.
8442000	8443000	I miss you.
8443000	8444000	I'm back.
8444000	8445000	All right.
8447000	8449000	Fuck, it's tight in here, man.
8450000	8452000	The webcam is a very, very tiny space.
8452000	8453000	What can I say?
8454000	8455000	I'm working out a lot, man.
8455000	8456000	I can't fit in here anymore.
8456000	8457000	Okay.
8457000	8458000	I'm in.
8458000	8459000	Okay.
8459000	8460000	I'm okay now.
8461000	8466000	So yeah, dude, I fucking, it was a crazy little, little turn of events I had to go through
8466000	8474000	for a little while, but I've always, I've always been listening and I, I'm finally putting
8474000	8475000	it together.
8477000	8480000	Well, I, I'm glad you're here tonight, Jim.
8480000	8485000	I'm, I, uh, I hope you continue to, uh, listen and grace us with your presence once in a
8485000	8488000	while to play random trivia games or what have you.
8488000	8491000	And, uh, you know, I still want you to start a podcast someday.
8491000	8492000	I really do.
8493000	8495000	My sister came down from Toronto.
8495000	8496000	She's a standup comedian.
8496000	8498000	Is she, is she, get out, really?
8498000	8499000	I'm being serious.
8499000	8501000	She talked me through, her name is Susie Marks.
8501000	8502000	You can check her out online.
8502000	8503000	M A R K S.
8503000	8506000	Susanna Marks, M A R K S.
8506000	8507000	Okay.
8507000	8509000	On the internet and stuff, because everyone wants to give her some likes.
8509000	8510000	She likes that shit.
8510000	8514000	But she talked me through it on, on today and we put some good ideas together and we
8514000	8516000	recorded a couple of little demos.
8518000	8521000	It might be, it's going to be a manly podcast.
8521000	8522000	A manly podcast.
8522000	8523000	That's okay.
8523000	8528000	It's time for men to be men.
8528000	8529000	Don't break something, Jim.
8529000	8531000	It's time for men to be men, Rob.
8531000	8533000	You know what I'm saying?
8533000	8534000	I understand.
8534000	8536000	You know what I'm saying?
8536000	8537000	I, Jim, Jim, Jim.
8537000	8539000	When Shane dropped those fucking donuts, he was a man.
8539000	8544000	Shane dropped those donuts and he came up to you and he said, lover, I dropped the donut.
8544000	8548000	And then you said, you said you'd be a man and you get the fuck back outside and you
8548000	8549000	get the more donuts.
8549000	8552000	And Shane said, yes, sir.
8552000	8553000	I said, no.
8553000	8555000	Shane, get the fucking donuts, man.
8555000	8558000	You can't tell a guy you're going to give him a motherfucking donut.
8558000	8561000	Ah, he had, he had a donut, Jim Sally.
8561000	8562000	He had two of them.
8562000	8565000	I ate two donuts because I'm a big boy.
8565000	8566000	Yeah.
8566000	8568000	But those were my donuts that I dropped for myself.
8568000	8570000	Rob, you were going to eat both the fucking donuts.
8570000	8573000	Jim, I am, I am all for a manly men's show.
8573000	8575000	Believe me, Jim, I like men.
8582000	8583000	Well, good.
8583000	8584000	We're going to do it, buddy.
8584000	8585000	All right.
8585000	8586000	That sounds awesome.
8586000	8587000	I can't wait.
8587000	8590000	All right, Jim Sally, I got to let you go so we can try to get another call, wrap up
8590000	8593000	the show, but thank you so much for gracing us with your presence tonight and playing
8593000	8594000	Bobby Blackwell trivia.
8594000	8595000	Love you, man.
8595000	8596000	It was good.
8596000	8598000	Shane, don't give him fucking two donuts, man.
8598000	8599000	You got to be with him.
8599000	8602000	The one looked like the one in the introduction to the Simpsons.
8602000	8603000	I had to eat it.
8603000	8605000	It was like purple and springy.
8605000	8606000	Shouldn't eat two donuts, guys.
8606000	8608000	Just eat fucking one donut.
8608000	8609000	I couldn't help myself.
8609000	8610000	All right.
8610000	8611000	Now I feel guilty.
8611000	8612000	All right.
8612000	8613000	Bye, Jim Sally.
8613000	8614000	Thanks for calling in.
8614000	8615000	Choo choo.
8615000	8616000	Bye, Jim.
8616000	8617000	Goodbye.
8617000	8618000	For now, we'll talk to you maybe next week.
8618000	8619000	All right.
8619000	8620000	I'll see you later.
8620000	8621000	Bye, Jim.
8623000	8624000	I'll be down here.
8624000	8625000	Okay.
8625000	8632000	Brad from Pod Culture says he just needs to submit a ton of random clips and put them
8632000	8634000	in random rotation.
8634000	8635000	I would be totally okay with that.
8635000	8638000	More people would probably listen to that than the music feed.
8638000	8639000	Let's be real.
8639000	8644000	You just have Jim Sally going on rants 24-7 when there's no other live program on the
8644000	8649000	network, and I think people would be totally down for that.
8649000	8651000	So great to hear from Jim Sally.
8651000	8654000	Well, we will try to squeeze in one more call here.
8654000	8655000	1-877-GAME-OLR.
8655000	8660000	Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.
8660000	8661000	Yeah.
8661000	8664000	Try to squeeze you in if you want to get in on the show.
8664000	8667000	Are you looking up any more last minute stories over there?
8667000	8668000	Low-key, Darzara?
8668000	8670000	Arrowhead says they're not doing Gauntlet anymore.
8670000	8671000	Oh, really?
8671000	8672000	No more Gauntlet games?
8672000	8673000	Yeah.
8673000	8674000	That was on Game Politics.
8674000	8675000	Hold on.
8675000	8676000	Why?
8676000	8677000	I have to find it again.
8677000	8678000	The new Gauntlet wasn't bad at all.
8678000	8679000	That's kind of sad.
8679000	8681000	I didn't play it, but I have it.
8681000	8682000	I just haven't played it yet.
8682000	8683000	It's not bad at all.
8683000	8687000	It's Diablo inspired, but it's a little different.
8687000	8688000	You don't go for the gear grind.
8688000	8690000	It's just straight up the gold.
8690000	8694000	Yeah, you have last minute stories.
8694000	8697000	Smile Basic is coming to 3DS.
8697000	8707000	If you remember, Smile Basic was on the regular DS and DSi a while back.
8707000	8711000	You can actually program games in it, and now you can do that as well.
8711000	8714000	It allows for more complex games to be made.
8714000	8718000	It's only $10 in the US, coming out on the 15th of October.
8718000	8722000	Check it out.
8722000	8724000	One I missed a little bit earlier.
8724000	8726000	Minecraft got an update recently.
8726000	8731000	With that, you can actually get some sort of special magical wings to be able to fly around,
8731000	8735000	or I should say glide around in the game.
8735000	8738000	They are not necessarily wings.
8738000	8741000	It seems like it's a hang glider or something.
8741000	8745000	Apparently, you can find it, but you can't actually craft those in the game.
8745000	8747000	That's kind of cool.
8747000	8754000	The deal with Arrowhead is that they're not going to be doing updates for Gauntlet Slayer Edition anymore.
8754000	8758000	They said that they were happy working with Warner Bros. Entertainment,
8758000	8761000	and now they're ready to bring it to an end.
8761000	8763000	They're not going to do any more patches.
8763000	8765000	They just likely said they're not going to do any more patches.
8765000	8767000	Nothing will be unfixed.
8767000	8773000	Anything that has a problem will remain unfixed, and they haven't really said why.
8773000	8776000	So, yeah, no more.
8776000	8779000	So that's it.
8779000	8781000	Maybe the game sales slowed down or something.
8781000	8784000	They've got to shift resources to another game or something.
8784000	8785000	They don't have the money anymore. I don't know.
8785000	8786000	Possibly.
8786000	8788000	Anything else, Loki?
8788000	8789000	That's it.
8789000	8791000	Shane, you got anything else there?
8791000	8792000	No.
8792000	8793000	I guess that's it then.
8793000	8796000	We're going to go ahead and wrap up for the evening because the phones aren't ringing either.
8796000	8799000	But those are some pretty great calls tonight.
8799000	8803000	So if you guys want to follow up, you can always send us an email.
8803000	8805000	Participate at orangelaunchradio.com.
8805000	8807000	You can also contact us on Twitter.
8807000	8809000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
8809000	8811000	All great places to get ahold of us.
8811000	8815000	We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts and wrap it up for the night.
8815000	8817000	But as I always say towards the end of the show,
8817000	8823000	if you did enjoy what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two or 15 or 60 about the show.
8823000	8826000	And help spread the word about the show where every gamer has a voice.
8826000	8831000	Because we don't have a big website or really big names backing up this show.
8831000	8833000	So we really appreciate the word of mouth.
8833000	8834000	It goes an awful long way.
8834000	8837000	And hey, participate with the show.
8837000	8838000	Come be a part of it.
8838000	8841000	Everybody's welcome here at Orange Lounge Radio.
8841000	8843000	Including Shane who joined us here in studio tonight.
8843000	8844000	Thanks for being here, Shane.
8844000	8845000	Even if you were a tardy.
8845000	8846000	It's all right.
8846000	8847000	It happens.
8847000	8848000	Thank you for the donuts earlier today.
8848000	8849000	You're welcome.
8849000	8850000	And for all the shopping.
8850000	8852000	Even if you encourage me to buy things, I probably should know.
8852000	8853000	Yeah.
8853000	8854000	Yeah.
8854000	8855000	Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
8855000	8861000	Everybody should go pre-order Super Beat Zonic so it does well enough to have DLC and stuff like that.
8861000	8864000	Do you want to plug your Twitter or anything for people to follow you?
8864000	8865000	No.
8865000	8866000	All right. Fair enough.
8866000	8867000	I think I gave it out already anyway.
8867000	8870000	Jamie, you're ready to say something.
8870000	8871000	So what's your final thought for tonight?
8871000	8873000	Thank you for letting me dance some at Shane.
8873000	8874000	You're welcome.
8874000	8877000	I have to now find the PS2 and hook it up.
8877000	8879000	Because we only have the PS4 and we hooked up.
8879000	8881000	That's such a good game too.
8881000	8882000	I know.
8882000	8883000	It's so underappreciated.
8883000	8885000	I wish though you had your controllers here.
8885000	8886000	I never had this.
8886000	8887000	I thought you did.
8887000	8888000	Nope.
8888000	8889000	Never had the clappy hand controllers.
8889000	8890000	Whose did I play it in?
8890000	8891000	I thought you did too.
8891000	8892000	No.
8892000	8896000	Because I tried playing it without the clappy hand controllers on the clappy hand mode.
8896000	8898000	And it's really hard.
8898000	8901000	I thought the first time I played it was with the clappy hand controller.
8901000	8902000	That wasn't me.
8902000	8907000	Which reminded me of the old ColecoVision button finger thing that you have the little joystick on.
8907000	8910000	I think we have one of those somewhere.
8910000	8915000	I bet that was our friend here locally who I've just lost touch with over the years.
8915000	8917000	That he also collected all his music game stars.
8917000	8920000	Remember he had the arcade style popping music and all that?
8920000	8921000	That's right.
8921000	8923000	I feel like he's the one that would have had that if anybody.
8923000	8925000	It was Ryan.
8925000	8928000	Oh that's not who I was thinking of.
8928000	8932000	No he didn't have those but he had the popping music.
8932000	8934000	The full one.
8934000	8936000	Whatever.
8936000	8938000	Shane brings out my inner whatever.
8938000	8940000	Sorry.
8940000	8941000	That's okay.
8941000	8943000	Logan your final thought tonight.
8943000	8946000	My final thought is...
8946000	8949000	I guess I'll play more Ingress this week.
8949000	8952000	One of us. One of us.
8952000	8954000	My phone didn't let me download it.
8954000	8955000	Why not?
8955000	8956000	Because I'm out of room.
8956000	8957000	Delete something.
8957000	8961000	No because I cannot go without my Bejeweled fix Rob.
8961000	8963000	Alright deleting Bejeweled.
8963000	8964000	No.
8964000	8968000	And my final thought tonight is we're finishing a little early.
8968000	8970000	Maybe I should try to livestream after this show.
8970000	8974000	I usually try to edit OLR right away but maybe I'll try to squeeze in a livestream before anything.
8974000	8978000	Or if you didn't watch Amy Schumer on SNL you should watch her monologue.
8978000	8979000	It's so good.
8979000	8980000	Was it good?
8980000	8981000	I died.
8981000	8982000	I'll try to find it on Uber or something.
8982000	8983000	She's like a more offensive Sarah Silverman.
8983000	8985000	Alright we'll see.
8985000	8986000	We'll see.
8986000	8987000	Stay tuned to my Twitter.
8987000	8990000	Twitter.com slash SKIE.
8990000	8993000	Everyone needs to stay for the fortune cookie this time because it's really good.
8993000	8994000	It makes me think of Pogo.
8994000	8998000	Well don't say that because then the people on the podcast are like what is she talking about?
8998000	8999000	I'm sorry.
8999000	9000000	And they don't realize there's more show to happen.
9000000	9001000	That means they have to listen to us live.
9001000	9002000	Alright that's right.
9002000	9004000	You gotta come out sometime and listen to us live.
9004000	9005000	Alright goodnight everybody.
9005000	9009000	Have a wonderful night and we will see you in 7 days to do this all over again.
9009000	9011000	Thanks for listening to OLR.
