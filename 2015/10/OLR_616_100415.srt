One year and one week later after Jackbox Games kickstart and release they're back to talk about doing it all over again with the Jackbox Party Pack 2

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio tonight with episode number 616 for October the 4th of 2015

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My name is Rob Roberts or on Twitter I'm at Skie and I am here with you every week in Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento, CA with my co-hosts

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Say hello over there to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hello, how are we fighting about? Is there a cookie that we're fighting over?

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No, I wish I had a cookie

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I wish I had a cookie too, sorry there are no cookies to be found here

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
There are pumpkin chocolate chip cookies at the grocery store

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yum

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I told Becky she needs to make us some

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Sorry DarkSakura, our cookie is in another castle

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Well fuck that cookie, I'll make a cookie

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Alright, also say hello to TechMasterLoki

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Hi, I'm here

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hi, you're here, how you doing?

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Doing alright

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Two weeks in a row of perfect attendance everybody

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Let's put it on the board

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Number of weeks without an absence too, there we go

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I feel like I should have one of those little white tote board thingies

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You know, with the changing numbers

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Anyway, myself, DarkSakura, and Loki here with you all of course to talk about

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You know what, no extra guests here in studio tonight

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But that's okay because we always are joined by you guys in our chat room

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Again that's live.vognetwork.com

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And SSG100Matt in our chat room saying everyone gets a star today

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
And I'm assuming that is a gold star there in the chat room

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Appreciate it

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't recognize any other type of star

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's right, you don't ever see people handing out silver stars

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's like

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Here's your bronze star

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You know what, what if I like the color green?

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Do I get a green star? Like how does that work?

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We're orange lounge radio, should we have orange stars?

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Come on people, think outside the gold box

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Alright, no I'm kidding

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
We appreciate all the gold stars

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Raginator in chat, I love this one

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Says, two, two weeks without absence

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Ah, ah, ah

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's a good quote

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Raginator made a funny joke

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Oh my god, this is going to be an amazing show tonight you guys

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm so excited

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Seattle chat says warp star

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I like that

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Although Starboard Power Coupling is on Thursday nights on the network

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Anyway

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We're here to talk about video games

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And we actually do have a guest that's going to be joining us via the Skype line

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
In about 15 minutes here live with us

62
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And we're really excited to welcome back to the show this week

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Jackbox Games

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And Steve-o is going to be joining us this week from Jackbox Games

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
To talk all about the Jackbox Party Pack Part 2

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And we are very excited to talk about this upcoming release

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Because I don't know if y'all played Part 1

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But that was a lot of fun

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And you know

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
In the interest of transparency

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We here at OLR

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We've made it no secret that we kind of

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Alright sometimes we're a little partial to Jackbox Games

74
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And it's not just because they'll come on the show

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But I grew up loving those things like You Don't Know Jack

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And you know the things that Berkley Systems used to do back in the day

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Which you know if you trace their history

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You know basically went from one company to another

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Acrophobia and all this stuff

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
So I'm really happy to have them on the show

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Talk about what they're doing these days

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Because I really feel like they've kind of had a renaissance of sorts

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
In the past couple years

84
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
With the relaunch of You Don't Know Jack

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And all these other things that they're doing online

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So we'll be talking to them live

87
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And if you want to join us in our chat room

88
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

89
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You can actually ask questions along with the interview

90
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's interactive like that

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Very excited about that

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Meanwhile though we are going to get to a kickoff topic here in studio

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Because we do of course talk about

94
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What's going on in gaming and gaming culture every week

95
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Here at Orange Launch Radio

96
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And tonight's kickoff topic

97
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I want to talk about

98
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
A little bit of a real life experience

99
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That I had today

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And I want to get Dark Soccer and Loki's opinion on this

101
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
As well as you guys in our chat room

102
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And today I went shopping

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Which you know

104
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Everybody goes shopping once in a while right

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But today I went shopping to a lot of different places

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Because my buddy Shane

107
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Who calls into the show quite often

108
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Who you know was a guest on Horde House

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm sure a lot of you know him by now

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Shane has this fascination

111
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Shall we say with Power Rangers dolls

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Which you know I get it

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Everybody's got their thing right

114
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You know what if you collect amiibo

115
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You have no right to talk

116
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
To talk down to Shane about what he's collecting

117
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So he loves his Power Rangers things

118
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And he actually like

119
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
He does that thing where he kind of tracks

120
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Like the different stores and what they're getting

121
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And I think there's like a forum that he's posting to

122
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
So long story short

123
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We had to go to like Target

124
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Over on this side of town

125
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And the Walmart over here

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And Best Buy

127
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
All to look for basically Power Rangers dolls

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And amiibo

129
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Which was something that I was looking for

130
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Because you know they've had the recent reprinting

131
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Of some of the hard to get amiibo

132
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So I was looking for some of that

133
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
At these different stores

134
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Well the reason why I bring up going shopping

135
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
To all these different stores is

136
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm really noticing

137
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And I feel like we've talked about this on the show

138
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
A couple years ago

139
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
When this was first starting to take place

140
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But now that we've had new games come out

141
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Like Lego Dimensions last week

142
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Shelf space being made for Guitar Hero

143
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Skylanders

144
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Amiibo

145
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I am really feeling the toy-splosion

146
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That's happening in the video game world

147
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And I mean

148
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
When I was at Toys R Us

149
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm telling you

150
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Like one whole wall

151
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Dedicated to the Lego Dimensions

152
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And because you know what the Lego Dimensions is

153
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's the starter pack

154
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But it's not just the starter

155
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's starter pack for Wii U

156
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Starter pack for Xbox 360

157
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
For the one

158
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
For the PlayStation 4

159
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And then it's level packs

160
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Like you know

161
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Portal 2

162
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Back to the Future

163
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Simpsons

164
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Fun packs

165
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Which is like more vehicles

166
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Fun packs which are like characters

167
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And then they have like

168
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Team packs

169
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Or something like that

170
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Which are a few characters

171
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah

172
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And then

173
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Okay so

174
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That's just Lego Dimensions

175
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Now add to that

176
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The fact that Skylanders has a new game this year

177
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Everybody's going fucking nuts over Amiibo

178
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Guitar Hero and Rock Band are now making a space

179
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Which I

180
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I know that isn't really toys

181
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But it's still that odd peripheral space

182
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That everybody said was dead

183
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Cause remember this show goes back to

184
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Dance Dance Revolution right

185
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
So when we started this show

186
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Cause if you didn't know

187
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Myself, Loki, Dark Sakura

188
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
We all met playing Dance Dance Revolution

189
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
And look at me now

190
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You would never have noticed that

191
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You would know that Loki has a strange affinity

192
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
For Eurodance music but

193
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It is true

194
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But anyway

195
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Some of it I mean

196
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Some of it

197
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But anyway

198
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You know at that point

199
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I remember we would have conversations about

200
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
DDR saved peripherals

201
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Peripherals were a joke

202
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
In gaming for the longest time in the 90s right

203
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Because

204
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What do we love to quote from the wizard

205
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The power glove

206
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's so bad right

207
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Cause it really was bad

208
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Did you guys play with the power glove?

209
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It was bad

210
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And smelled funny

211
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yeah it did kind of smell funny

212
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And then the U-Force

213
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It didn't

214
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Remember the magazine ads for the U-Force

215
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Making it look like you would actually be playing pun

216
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It didn't fucking work like that

217
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It did not

218
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Work like that whatsoever

219
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The power pad

220
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
They made what like two games for the power pad

221
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And that was okay

222
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So it's like

223
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Peripherals were kind of in this weird dead place

224
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Where they didn't really make them

225
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
During the Super Nintendo era

226
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes

227
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I love the Super Scope

228
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I know the Super Scope

229
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
But like what there was like one Super Scope game

230
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Maybe I think there was a second more obscure one

231
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I mean like there were not a lot of games

232
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Well Super Scope 6 and then of course

233
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The robot game

234
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Cause really those are the only two games that you needed

235
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Still what a weird ass

236
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I mean think about it

237
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Battle Clash

238
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What a weird ass concept

239
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
That the Super Scope was to begin with

240
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Who had the idea to put a fucking bazooka

241
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Like

242
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Hey we need a zapper gun

243
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But that's too small

244
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Let's have a bazooka

245
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm not knocking

246
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That peripheral

247
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Because it was awesome

248
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But I'm just saying

249
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It was really weird

250
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
When you kind of go back and think about it

251
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Why couldn't we just do the zapper again?

252
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
No?

253
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Bazooka?

254
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I don't know

255
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But anyway

256
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
So all these peripherals come and go

257
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But now it seems like

258
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I don't even know if it's a renaissance

259
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Or if it's just the fact that

260
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Disney and Lego

261
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Which are huge entertainment companies

262
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And toy makers are now seeing these big dollar signs

263
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Thanks to what Activision did with Skylanders

264
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So now they're flooding with all this

265
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But what is up with the toy splosion?

266
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And how does this make you feel

267
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
When you go to the video game section

268
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
At let's say Toys R Us or Target

269
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And over half

270
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Excuse me

271
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Over half of it

272
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I mean

273
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And that's not

274
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Look at the square footage

275
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Video games themselves

276
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Don't take up much space

277
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And a lot of that is shifting digital

278
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And that might be part of this as well

279
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
But over half that shelf space

280
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Are the toys

281
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And the peripherals

282
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And things that we

283
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Like ten years ago

284
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You could not have guessed that this was going to happen

285
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You could not have guessed

286
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And that's pretty nice for

287
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Companies like GameStop

288
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
That are fearing that it's going to go all digital

289
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Because it's not

290
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
There's no way they can

291
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
If they have all this crap that they have to sell

292
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So

293
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I don't know

294
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So far

295
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Prior to this year

296
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It was pretty easy for me to avoid all that stuff

297
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Because I'm like

298
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Fuck that

299
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm not really going to invest in Disney Infinity

300
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Or

301
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Skylars

302
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Because just Skylars

303
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I don't really give a shit about that

304
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Disney Infinity

305
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It was expensive

306
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I tried it a little bit

307
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And then just kind of like

308
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's not my age demographic

309
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But then again

310
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
There's the Lego game

311
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And I

312
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That might be my Achilles heel right there

313
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The thing about that Lego game for me

314
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And I finally took the plunge

315
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And I bought that Lego Dimensions

316
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It is the tie-ins that they're tying in with

317
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Are so random

318
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But awesome

319
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Like Portal 2

320
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Simpsons

321
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That Midway arcade thing

322
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Ghostbusters

323
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Back to the Future

324
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That's the thing

325
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Doctor Who

326
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That's what finally sold me on it

327
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Is that it wasn't just Disney movies

328
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Or this made up universe

329
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Which Skylanders is

330
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But it was like

331
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Really awesome things

332
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Like all in kind of a giant blender

333
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What do you think of all this

334
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Dark Soccer?

335
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I mean

336
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You kind of used to collect this stuff

337
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I mean

338
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The Dreamcast game with a dish

339
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Hello?

340
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Well

341
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
But I was also

342
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I was super into Cardcaptor Sakura

343
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
When I got that

344
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And I came really close to getting the Sakura Taisen one as well

345
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
But you know

346
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I had this big thing for collector's editions

347
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Like back when we had a bunch more disposable income

348
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Now we've got the income for it

349
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But it's not so disposable

350
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
If that makes sense

351
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Sure

352
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And Dan and I were looking at it

353
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And we're like

354
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Well you know what

355
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
We could get this

356
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And spend

357
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
$150

358
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Or I could get Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer

359
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
For $50

360
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And you ended up with Animal Crossing

361
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Well there was that

362
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
We were actually going to get the Wii U Pro Controller

363
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And then we looked at Lego Dimensions

364
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And then did the math on it

365
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And I ended up getting a game

366
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
With the Amiibo reader

367
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The Amiibo card reader

368
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Because I need all of the Animal Crossing cards

369
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And that's more important

370
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Which is funny

371
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
For me personally

372
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
And I'm not slamming your decision

373
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But for me personally

374
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I have zero interest in that Happy Home Designer thing

375
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yeah

376
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I have no interest in it

377
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But that's cool

378
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
How much of the last Animal Crossing game did I play?

379
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yeah I know

380
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You played a lot of it

381
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You played a lot more than I did

382
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That's for sure

383
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And now I get to design everyone's freaking homes

384
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And they better love me for it

385
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Let me go to the chat room

386
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Which is lighten up over at live.vognetwork.com

387
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Kaijuto in chat says suckers

388
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And they mash all that stuff in

389
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
To sucker you to buy a cheap mediocre game

390
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And Bobby Blackwolf defending his actions

391
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Saying I'm a sucker

392
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But I am having too much fun being a sucker

393
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You know I gotta say though

394
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And I really truly feel this way

395
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Like I enjoy Legos anyway

396
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So the fact that they kind of made a game around it

397
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Their games are pretty good though

398
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Like I wasn't like Lego Marvel

399
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I was like yeah Lego games are pretty good

400
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You know and they're pretty good

401
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
But I

402
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's just they're good I don't know

403
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I really truly love the Amiibo figures themselves

404
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Like and I know I've gone on rants about Amiibo

405
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And that's all about the distribution

406
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And now that that's finally calming its tits a little bit

407
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And it's getting a little easier to find

408
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You know some of the things you want

409
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Especially if you're willing to pay just like

410
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Four or five more bucks to get it from a Japanese import

411
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Which is totally easy

412
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You know I'm getting those figures a lot easier

413
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And I gotta say I really just as a nerd

414
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Who was raised on the Legend of Zelda and Mario Brothers

415
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I just love those little figures

416
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And if they didn't do anything with the game

417
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I would be kind of okay with that

418
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Because let's be real they don't do that much

419
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Like Amiibos aren't

420
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I mean it's cool that they have a little extra

421
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And it's usually just something

422
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Just a little extra something like a Mario Maker

423
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And one extra little costume

424
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Mario Kart and an extra costume

425
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm not buying those figures for the costume

426
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I thought that for Splatoon I'm like

427
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Oh maybe I've got this you know Bowser

428
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm gonna try using this

429
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Oh sorry that only works with the Splatoon Amiibos

430
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm like well then why would I buy those?

431
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
That's stupid

432
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Wat meme in our chat room

433
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Wat says

434
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm holding out for the Montgomery Ward exclusive

435
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
One could only hope

436
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That a store like Montgomery Ward

437
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Where I believe

438
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What was it we bought at Montgomery Ward

439
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I think my Super Nintendo came from Montgomery Ward

440
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I bought Killer Instinct there

441
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Did you?

442
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I believe that is where my mom bought my Super Nintendo

443
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
For Christmas was at a Montgomery Ward

444
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Which has been leveled many years ago

445
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
And became a target

446
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I believe the sales person said

447
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Oh yeah our biggest selling game

448
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
On Super Nintendo right now is Drakken

449
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And then my mom bought Drakken

450
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Which I was like

451
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What the hell is this game

452
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
When I played it

453
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Well I mean luckily that was the packing game

454
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And I played that like ten times more

455
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
But then

456
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Wasn't it nice to have packing games all the time

457
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Yeah remember those days

458
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Then I went back to Drakken like a year after I had the Super Nintendo

459
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And I was like what the fuck was I missing

460
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
This game was awesome

461
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Then they did a sequel, Dragon's View

462
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That game was tight

463
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
That game was awesome

464
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So thank you Montgomery Ward salesman

465
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
For introducing me to a game I probably would have

466
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Never figured out otherwise

467
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Cialan Chat says

468
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I want the Samus amiibos

469
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Just to let Nintendo know

470
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
That the series still needs love

471
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Raginator in chat over at

472
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Live.vognetwork.com says

473
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Seeing as I am a diehard

474
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Magic player, the actual collectible card game

475
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Back in the day, I can't say

476
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Shit about Skylanders, amiibo

477
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And so forth, you know that's a good comparison

478
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Is that there's always

479
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Been a space for collectibles

480
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Even in the gaming world

481
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Right, I mean board game

482
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
People right, aren't there usually like

483
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Several editions of a game

484
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Or even a game like

485
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What Dominion has all these

486
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Like it seems like there's like fifty different

487
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Probably I'm exaggerating but like

488
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
All these different booster packs and things like that

489
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
For that game, or hell Cards Against Humanity

490
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Right, how many people

491
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Are like oh, if you go to PAX East

492
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You gotta get me the exclusive cards

493
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
For my Cards Against Humanity game

494
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Because they add something to the game

495
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Whereas amiibos just add like a

496
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Costume to the game and it doesn't really matter

497
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It's just kind of an excuse

498
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
To sell DLC

499
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But more expensive and it's

500
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Less valuable

501
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So like if someone tried to say hey

502
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'll tell you what

503
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You know Mario Kart, do you want a really cool

504
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Koopa hat, that's gonna be

505
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Twelve dollars

506
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You'd probably say fuck you, I am not buying that

507
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
But since they're selling it with a statue

508
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Sure

509
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
We'll do that

510
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And maybe I'll get to use it

511
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
In another game someday

512
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Maybe, maybe

513
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Alright, well we're

514
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Going to get to our interview here shortly but

515
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Before we get into our gaming weeks real quick

516
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
We'll at least probably get Dark Soccer's out here

517
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And then we'll move into

518
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Our interview tonight, so

519
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

520
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
We always like to start off the show after our kickoff topic

521
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Talking about our gaming weeks

522
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Kinda busy, yeah

523
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I of course played Dragon Age Inquisition

524
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I

525
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
What else, I got

526
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer

527
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Although I haven't had a chance to start it yet

528
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
What else

529
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Oh yeah, we got our Wii U

530
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Which you know we

531
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Like a whole lot and we borrowed

532
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Super Mario 3D World

533
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And Dan and I started that together

534
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Cause you know we can play co-op and

535
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You know we fussed each other for you know

536
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Knocking each other

537
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Into enemies and what not, it was still pretty fun

538
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And

539
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Something else but I don't remember so

540
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'll just say that's it

541
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Alright, Loki

542
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
How was your gaming week?

543
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I did play a lot of stuff

544
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I started off trying out Ingress

545
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
So I've been playing that

546
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm so proud

547
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm so happy

548
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
So I'm level 3 now in Ingress cause I captured

549
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Two portals today and

550
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's basically just kind of

551
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's kind of gaming in that

552
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Space between other things

553
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I guess if that makes sense

554
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Just taking my kids to the park

555
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Instead of just sitting there

556
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Bored while I'm pushing them on the swing

557
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I can hack a portal and push them

558
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
On the swing, it's multitasking

559
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's like foursquare really

560
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That's why I always kind of like you know we always

561
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Just check in, we go places, it's kind of like that

562
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Except now you can kind of, you can literally like

563
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Piss on something for your team

564
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And be like it's mine

565
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I claim this in the name of Spain

566
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I don't know if like I'd be going down like to

567
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Oh I gotta go to some event or something in San Francisco

568
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Or something, I don't know if I'd do that but you know

569
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I don't know, it's something to do

570
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
While I'm waiting for things

571
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I guess if that makes sense

572
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
So I don't know

573
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And then let's see what other

574
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Brief thing can I get into

575
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Played a little bit of Lego Marvel Super Heroes

576
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Because my son is still playing that

577
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I think he's like 220 hours now

578
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
In that game

579
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's like you were with Minecraft at one point

580
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I think he spent

581
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
More time in that game

582
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So I'm looking forward to getting whatever the next

583
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Lego Avengers

584
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I love this comment from Bobby Blackwolf in chat

585
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Loki gets a Wii U and then starts playing Ingress

586
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
That's great

587
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I can't play Ingress at home

588
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
So it's just when I'm out

589
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Ingress is an outdoor game

590
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It is

591
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
And it got me to go walking one lunch

592
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
See that's what the game does to you

593
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's crazy

594
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But anyway, I don't want to turn this into an Ingress show

595
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Somebody suggested that I do one

596
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm still thinking about it

597
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Super Mario Maker

598
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I made a level called

599
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Jigsaw's Castle of Carnage

600
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And no one has passed it

601
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Except for me

602
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's incredibly hard

603
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I know Bobby was talking about this on his show

604
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Earlier tonight

605
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
All the levels are just torture porn

606
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And I don't mean that

607
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
In a Jigsaw movie kind of way

608
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's all just

609
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Everybody wanting to be asshole Mario

610
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's not asshole Mario

611
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I have hidden blocks

612
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's not trolling you

613
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's just genuinely difficult

614
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I guess

615
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's not incredible

616
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I passed it after about 50 tries

617
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's just torture

618
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
There's a mistake in it too

619
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I accidentally missed one of the pits

620
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It has a block covering

621
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm like ah shit

622
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I gotta fix this and pass the game again

623
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
If I want to edit it

624
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
That's staying there

625
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I played Splatoon

626
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
And I actually figured out how to play that finally

627
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And enjoying it now that I have the paint roller

628
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
At this point though I can't use my other Amiibo stuff

629
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
For unlocking costumes

630
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Still trying to figure out what I'm using that for

631
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I think that's about it

632
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
That's about it for your gaming week huh?

633
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
We are actually going to go to

634
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Our interview because it's about 6.30

635
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So we are going to actually give

636
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Steve-O a call

637
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
With Jackbox Games

638
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And he is actually the editorial director

639
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Over at Jackbox and tonight

640
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
We are going to be talking about the Jackbox Party Pack

641
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Part 2 and I'm really excited

642
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
To welcome to the show Steve-O

643
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Are you there Steve?

644
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I am can you hear me?

645
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
We can hear you just fine welcome to Orange Launch Radio

646
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Thank you for having me on

647
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Thank you so much for being here

648
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I don't know if you heard earlier in the show

649
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
We admit that we are a little partial

650
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
To Jackbox Games

651
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Just because you guys come on the show

652
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Just because I love

653
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Game Show Games

654
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I was talking about this with Mike last time we were here

655
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
When he was here

656
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I don't want to necessarily repeat the conversation

657
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I was so bummed when 1 vs 100

658
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Went off of Xbox Live

659
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I feel like you guys are making games

660
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
That help fill that gap if that makes sense

661
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Oh yeah definitely

662
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
In fact as we

663
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
We are constantly trying to come up with

664
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
New ideas for games

665
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
The 1 vs 100 idea

666
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Something that really keeps coming up with us

667
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Something like that

668
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
That we might try to do someday

669
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That is very similar to that but not that obviously

670
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
We wouldn't steal the idea

671
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
No you would never steal it

672
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
No no

673
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Because you can play our games

674
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
On streams and there are hundreds of people watching

675
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Since your phone is your controller

676
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You can have a lot of people playing

677
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I wouldn't be surprised

678
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
If we make something like the 1 vs 100

679
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Kind of style of game sometimes

680
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Inspired by

681
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
We'll say inspired

682
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
How has that streaming

683
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Thing been going

684
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Because I noticed

685
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You guys noticed early on

686
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
With some of your earlier fibage

687
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And some of the games you put out

688
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
During this renaissance period

689
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Ever since the newer You Don't Know Jack games

690
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
You guys are putting out more things

691
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
On the networks

692
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I noticed that the streaming

693
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Has really been a big part

694
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
For you guys

695
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
So much so that I noticed in Quiplash

696
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It seemed like you made some decisions

697
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
In the game such as enabling streaming mode

698
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And doing these things that

699
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Kind of catered towards live streamers

700
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Have you been surprised that that has been

701
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Such a huge part of the games?

702
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Absolutely, in fact

703
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
We knew it was the thing

704
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
But we didn't realize with our games

705
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
How popular it would become

706
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
When we first did the first fibage

707
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
That's when we noticed

708
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
We saw people playing

709
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
They were giving comments

710
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It would be great if the host had

711
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
A little bit more control over certain things

712
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Such as

713
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Well

714
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
There were things like time issues

715
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
People are playing on a stream

716
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
And they're not really live

717
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
15 seconds delayed because of the stream

718
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
How does that work?

719
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Are they still seeing all the information they need

720
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
On their phone or on their controller

721
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
In case they can't see

722
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
They're not synced up with what's on the screen

723
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
We had an issue

724
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
At the beginning where

725
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Any of the people

726
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Who had logged in to play the game

727
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Could actually hit the start button and start the game

728
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
So people

729
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Out in the world were pressing

730
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Start and not everybody had gotten in yet

731
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So we sort of tailored that to be

732
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Only the first person to log in

733
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
That would be the host or whoever is running the stream

734
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Only the person who is running the stream

735
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Can push the start button now

736
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Stuff like that that we heard feedback on

737
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
And now we're really starting to integrate

738
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Damn those trolls

739
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It made the game even better

740
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Even trolls can teach you a thing or two sometimes

741
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Even though we shouldn't admit that

742
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I noticed some of your games

743
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Are tailored now to more and more people

744
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
For example

745
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
A lice water went up to 100 people

746
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
And I'm noticing in one of these games

747
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
That's in the Jackbox Party Pack

748
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Bomb Corps

749
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
How many people can participate

750
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Not necessarily play but participate

751
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
In Bomb Corps, tell us about that

752
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Because that seems like it has to be done

753
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
With a streaming audience in mind

754
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Because I know I can't hold 10,000 people in my living room

755
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Well actually

756
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
There's a couple of games

757
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
In the Party Pack

758
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
The Party Pack 2

759
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
That we've integrated this

760
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Audience feature

761
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
And so what the audience feature is

762
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Is sort of like

763
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
You're not actually a player in the game

764
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
But you are participating in some way

765
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
So for instance in Quiplash

766
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
The audience

767
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
There's 8 core players

768
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Up to 8 core players

769
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
But as many as 10,000 people can join

770
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Because they can vote on their favorite answers

771
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
And actually affect the outcome of the game

772
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
So

773
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
We have games

774
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Like lice water

775
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Goes up to actually 100 players

776
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
That could actually play it

777
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
As a player

778
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
But now we're starting to find

779
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
This other little area which is called the audience

780
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Where it's sort of like a

781
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
It's like partial participation in the game

782
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
While you're viewing it

783
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
And when you're

784
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
When you're not like a full time player in the game

785
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
You know our servers

786
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
The way our architecture is sort of set up

787
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
We can sort of support more of a

788
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Semi player if you will

789
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
So the people who are watching on streams

790
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Aren't just passively watching our games now

791
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
We can get 10,000 people in

792
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
And actually have some sort of effect on the game

793
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
It is this really fascinating

794
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Trend I'm seeing with games

795
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Not just from you guys

796
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
But I was at TwitchCon for a little bit

797
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
And I was talking about that on the show last week

798
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
And I know you guys were there too

799
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I noticed there were actually games being made

800
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
With Twitch in mind

801
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
And there was this one game being shown

802
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Where they could add obstacles and things

803
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
And I remember in the Tomb Raider collection

804
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
That was one of the earliest ones I remember

805
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
That would really affect things

806
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
It sounds like you guys are kind of taking that as well

807
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Where you're playing with the world

808
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
And they can impact the game

809
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I mean how is

810
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
How was TwitchCon for you guys

811
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
And all that?

812
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I wasn't out there

813
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
We were out there

814
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
My coworkers were out there

815
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
And yeah it's definitely

816
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And the Twitch folks

817
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Are very interested in what we're doing too

818
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So they're being very

819
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Open to sort of

820
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Helping us get our stuff

821
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Optimized for

822
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Twitch

823
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
So I think we have a good working relationship

824
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
With them that's kind of building right now

825
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
But I was out at PAX Prime

826
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Not too long ago

827
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
And we actually did a

828
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Talk with the folks

829
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Who do iDAR

830
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I don't know if you're familiar with that

831
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
It's a game where audience participation is there

832
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
People are

833
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Sending hashtags through Twitter

834
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
And they're sort of

835
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Adding bombs and all sorts of things

836
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
To the game

837
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
The way we do it is a little bit different

838
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
You're either voting on a winner

839
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Or you're playing along with the questions

840
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
The trivia questions

841
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
There's a lot of different ways

842
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Integrating this sort of concept

843
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Of like hey people are

844
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Enjoying just watching games

845
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Wouldn't it be cool if we could actually give them

846
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
A little bit of participation too

847
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Let's talk a little more about some of the games

848
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
That are going to be in the Jackbox Party Pack

849
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
In case you guys have missed it

850
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Or out there listening

851
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I know on your blog and through your various

852
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Social media streams which also includes

853
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
A live stream, you guys do your own live streams

854
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
On Fridays right?

855
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
2 o'clock central on Fridays, tune in

856
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
There you go, you can play along with people

857
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Who make the games

858
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You have 5 games that you've announced on your blog

859
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
That are going to be included in this game

860
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Fibbage 2, Earwax,

861
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Idiots, which I love that name

862
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Quiplash XL and

863
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Bomb Core

864
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Now I got to ask a tough question

865
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
That I think a lot of folks are going to be thinking

866
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And I got to ask it

867
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Why did you pass on a You Don't Know Jack game

868
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
For this collection? I was a little surprised to see that

869
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Well, you know

870
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
We're not killing

871
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
You Don't Know Jack

872
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Oh yeah

873
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I just noticed

874
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It was passed on for this

875
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
So I was just kind of surprised

876
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Because I was expecting that to be a game

877
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Not that I'm disappointed

878
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
One of the things

879
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
What we learned when we were watching

880
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
People play the Jackbox

881
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Party Pack 1, the original

882
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Was that the games like

883
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Fibbage and Drawfold

884
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Were super streamable

885
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
And that's what we were

886
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Kind of, a lot of the games that we were trying

887
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
To make for this version were

888
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Sort of tailored a little bit more toward that

889
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And while You Don't Know Jack is streamable

890
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
For sure

891
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
It's limited to four players

892
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
And it's really hard

893
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
With the timing of the questions

894
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
The way the game is kind of set up now

895
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
To really get an audience that's on a 15 second

896
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Delay kind of involved in it

897
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
So the games that we saw

898
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
That were really big hits from the

899
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Jackbox Party Pack 1

900
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Like Fibbage, like Drawfold

901
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
We saw that those were games that people were

902
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
You know, they were able to

903
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Create their own sort of content

904
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
On their phone slash controller device

905
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And Fibbage, it's your entering

906
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Lies, in Drawfold

907
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
You're drawing things that are funny

908
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
So we kind of tried to go

909
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
A little bit more in that direction with this

910
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Party Pack 2

911
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And so, you know, like I said

912
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
You Don't Know Jack is not dead

913
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
The five games in this pack

914
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I think people are going to enjoy

915
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
From the perspective of

916
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
They're great party games

917
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
They're great for your controller

918
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
They're great for streams, or your phone is a controller

919
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
They're great for streams

920
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
And I think when we do You Don't Know Jack again

921
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
We'll definitely try to

922
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Make some changes that make it a little bit more

923
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Fitting with the kind of way we're doing things now

924
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Okay, you know what, now I'm glad I asked

925
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
That question because what you're saying is making a lot of sense

926
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
See, I thought you might be being that

927
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Band coming out on stage not wanting to play

928
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Their hit single, I thought maybe that was what was

929
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Going on, but no, I'm glad I asked that because what you say

930
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
There makes a lot of sense, you're right

931
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
The streams are more of that party

932
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Streaming thing, whereas You Don't Know Jack, the timing is so important

933
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
That makes a lot of sense

934
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Although if you throw your bras and panties

935
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Up on stage, we might

936
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Go ahead and make one

937
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Well, if you insist

938
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Alright, anyway

939
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Loki, get on that

940
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Alright, anyway

941
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I hope you take like, you know

942
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
X-Men Underoos or something

943
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Take? That would

944
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
That would complete my collection

945
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Awesome

946
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
See why we like having them on the show

947
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Alright, let's talk about some of these games that are in the Party Pack

948
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I want to start with Bomb Corps

949
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Because to me, when I looked at Bomb Corps

950
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I was like, alright, this looks really different

951
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
For Jackbox, but I'm like

952
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I'm here for this, this is the kind of retro

953
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Looking thing, tell us a little more about

954
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Bomb Corps and where this idea came from

955
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
And how it fits into the pack

956
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Yeah, so, you know, what we wanted to do

957
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Was like, since you use

958
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Your phones as controllers

959
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Or your tablet or your laptop

960
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
We have this ability to send secret information

961
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
So that's something that doesn't

962
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
You know, you don't get on a

963
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
When you're using just a standard game controller

964
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
So everybody, the fact that everybody could get

965
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
You know, sort of secret information that not everybody else had

966
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
We tried to

967
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
We were coming up with ideas that would

968
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
You know, really play to that

969
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So with Bomb Corps

970
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
It's funny that you say Bomb Corps

971
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Because we went back and forth on this

972
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Is it, like, when it's

973
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
C-O-R-P period, is it corp?

974
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Or corp, Bomb Corp?

975
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
We don't even know, we're going with corp

976
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
But you can call it corp if you want

977
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I don't know, but then I also think

978
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
An actual, like, core of the bomb

979
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I don't know, I thought maybe it was a double entendre

980
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Because I notice you guys like puns

981
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
No, I thought that might

982
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I thought that might have been the thing, but alright

983
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Yeah, no, but anyway

984
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I got, yes, so

985
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
The idea kind of came from this idea of

986
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
You know, how can we

987
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Leverage this idea of, like, everybody

988
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Has different information, so in Bomb Corp

989
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
You get, each

990
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Player gets a little bit of information as to how

991
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
To diffuse a bomb

992
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
If the timer's ticking down

993
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And you kind of have to do a co-op

994
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Work together to diffuse the bomb

995
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So, you know, I might say

996
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
You might say, oh, I've got rule number one

997
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
You know, don't cut any red wires

998
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Unless they're next to white wires

999
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
And then the second person has a different rule and says

1000
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Don't cut anything about red wire, you know

1001
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
So, or, only player three

1002
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Can cut wires, so it's

1003
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
It starts off a little simple

1004
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
And then it gets really, really complicated

1005
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Or really not complicated, it gets more challenging

1006
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
There you go

1007
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Now, I'm just thinking, though, if I were the

1008
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I mean, you're gonna have those Lokis

1009
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Or the assholes of the party who lie about the direction

1010
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I don't do that

1011
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Well, you know what

1012
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Fine, we all know it's Jamie that does that

1013
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Who would say, oh, I made a mistake

1014
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
It's Irene that would do that

1015
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
That's true, Irene

1016
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Oh, come on, I'm the person in Maniac Mansion

1017
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Who just gets sick of the game, goes and blows up everything

1018
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Yeah, maybe

1019
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
I pushed the red button in the pool

1020
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
It's always Irene that's drawing the penis

1021
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
In those games, it's all

1022
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
It's like, okay, hmm, yeah, I wonder who did that

1023
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
It's always Irene

1024
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Well, some of our games actually call for drawing up penises

1025
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
So that's good

1026
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I think I actually saw on your Twitter account

1027
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Somebody lucked out and got the room code

1028
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
D-N-I-S or something like that

1029
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
It cracked me up

1030
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Yeah, you know, we actually go through

1031
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
We actually go through an exhaustive process

1032
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Every time, it's like, what do we need to add

1033
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
To this list that's not gonna get us in trouble

1034
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
You know, and so

1035
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
There's like an hour every time

1036
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
We put out a game, it's like, alright, here's the

1037
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Existing list, is there anything else we've missed

1038
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
You know, there's always something

1039
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
You know, V-U-V-A

1040
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Bulba or something, I don't know

1041
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
There's always something that we're like, well

1042
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
That's okay, we'll leave it or we take it out

1043
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Are you telling me that Jackbox Games

1044
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Has a list of four letter words that goes around

1045
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
The office, hey, if anybody can think of

1046
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Another four letter word that's not on the list

1047
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
It's an hour long brainstorm

1048
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Every product, yeah

1049
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Let Steve and HR know by five o'clock Friday

1050
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Yeah

1051
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I mean, you know, mostly you're trying to get

1052
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
The sort of, the really bad, like racist stuff

1053
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Anything that could be a derogatory term

1054
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Out of there, but then there's always one

1055
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
That comes up and you're like, how did we

1056
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Miss that, like the penis one you just said

1057
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
So

1058
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Alright, anyway

1059
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
But the point, I was gonna say about BombCorp

1060
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
If you, you know

1061
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
The thing is, if you decide to blow everything up

1062
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
And you decide not to play along, we think that

1063
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
The moment where everyone blows up is pretty

1064
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Funny anyway and never gets old, so there you go

1065
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
It's the Magroober experience

1066
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
It is the Magroober kind of thing, yeah

1067
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
And I'm gonna say that from now on

1068
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
When I say the BombCorp

1069
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm gonna just say it that way when I'm plugging it

1070
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Right here on this show

1071
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Let's talk about some of the other newer games

1072
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I'm familiar with Fibbage and Quiplash

1073
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Although I'm sure there's lots of new features

1074
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
We'll go back to those if we have time

1075
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
By the way, if you guys have questions for Steve

1076
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Please, by all means, ask away in our chatroom over at

1077
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Live.vognetwork.com

1078
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I wanna talk about some of these other newer games that are in it

1079
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Earwax, we were joking around

1080
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
On the show last week because we thought this was a pretty

1081
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Funny concept, so this is a game all around

1082
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Sound effects

1083
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And you just string sound effects

1084
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
It's like charades but with sound effects

1085
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Tell us more about Earwax

1086
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Okay, yeah, so that was one of the things

1087
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
When we started with Party Pack 2

1088
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
We really wanted to get a game with sound effects

1089
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Because we had

1090
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Fibbage where you're typing in answers

1091
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
And Quiplash 2 and we had Drawful where you were drawing

1092
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Things and we were like, what else can we do?

1093
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Well, we could submit sounds

1094
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
And so we

1095
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Tried a whole bunch of different ways of

1096
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Doing it and what ended up being really the funniest

1097
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
To us was this idea of

1098
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You get a prompt and it's

1099
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
The prompt could be like

1100
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Retirement home

1101
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Love affair or something like that

1102
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Please God no

1103
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
And then you have a car

1104
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
A handful of sound effects

1105
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
When I say a handful of sound effects on your phone

1106
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Or your tablet, you'll have a list

1107
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Of sound effects that are kind of like the cards in your hand

1108
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And you don't hear them

1109
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Necessarily, you just see the description of them

1110
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
And you kind of are trying to put

1111
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Together a one-two punch

1112
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Two sound effects back to back

1113
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
That best fit

1114
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
That prompt that you got

1115
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
So everyone submits their two sounds

1116
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
And then you go through

1117
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
A reveal to hear everyone's sounds

1118
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Back to back and it's usually pretty funny

1119
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
And then there's a judge for each round

1120
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
The judge is actually the person

1121
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Who picks the card in the first place

1122
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Old folks, retirement home, love affair, whatever

1123
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
And then the person who's the judge

1124
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Gets to pick which one they like the best

1125
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
That sounds

1126
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
What's most interesting

1127
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
About that to me is

1128
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Who's the person at the office that had to compile

1129
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
All those sound effects

1130
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
They've got a dream job, I'm telling you

1131
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Right, well Andy Poland is our

1132
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
You know, our audio music guru

1133
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
And I will say

1134
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
That many, many of those sound effects

1135
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Obviously, we already had in our big giant

1136
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Database of sound effects that we use for all our games

1137
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
But with the help of

1138
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Some interns

1139
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
By the way, in BombCorp

1140
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
You are an intern

1141
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Working at BombCorp

1142
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
So we got to have a lot of fun with our interns

1143
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Our actual interns

1144
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
During the summer

1145
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
But anyway, I'm going off on a tangent

1146
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
We had interns help us organize

1147
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
The sound effects, but it's all Andy

1148
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
When you hear a nice long fart sound effect

1149
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Andy Poland made that at some point

1150
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
In his bathroom or near his bathroom

1151
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Oh my god

1152
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
That's amazing, I love that

1153
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
You passed it on to the interns too

1154
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Fantastic

1155
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Let's talk a little bit about Bidiots

1156
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Which is my favorite name of any game there

1157
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
And I'm sure you guys must all have to

1158
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Brainstorm these names for the games as well

1159
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
And somehow

1160
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Some genius comes up with this

1161
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
But let's talk about Bidiots

1162
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
So actually what you're drawing on your phone

1163
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And then the other players bid

1164
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
On the art, like what is valuable

1165
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Or funniest, or how does that work?

1166
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Yeah, so

1167
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
You're given

1168
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Kind of like our game Drawful

1169
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
You're given a prompt

1170
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
And you draw

1171
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
This thing as best you can

1172
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
And it's probably not going to be that

1173
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Your drawing's not going to be that great

1174
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
But you get two drawings

1175
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
And you draw two drawings within a minute and a half or so

1176
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
And then you submit them

1177
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
And they become pieces of art in this art auction

1178
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
And then once you've submitted all your art

1179
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And everyone's submitted all their drawings

1180
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Everyone becomes a bidder at this auction

1181
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
So it becomes much more

1182
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Of a fast paced

1183
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
You know, just like you're at a real auction

1184
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And you get some secret information

1185
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
On your phone

1186
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Or on your device, whatever controller you're using

1187
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
That tells you

1188
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Certain things are worth a certain amount of money

1189
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
There's a little bit of vagary there

1190
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
So you kind of

1191
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Have an idea of what some things might be worth

1192
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
And what they might not

1193
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
And the other thing is

1194
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It might say, well, the drawing of

1195
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Bananas

1196
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Bananas playing volleyball

1197
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Or whatever

1198
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Might be worth a lot

1199
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Or might be worth

1200
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
$3,200

1201
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
And then you see an image up on screen

1202
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
And it looks like it might be bananas

1203
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
And it looks like there might be a ball

1204
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
And the thing is

1205
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Obviously, for the purposes of the game

1206
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
We've given everybody very similar drawings

1207
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
So, you know

1208
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
You may be thinking that this is a very valuable

1209
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Bananas playing volleyball

1210
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
When in fact it's bananas

1211
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Doing the limbo or something like that

1212
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
And it was only worth $900

1213
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
So the idea is that you're bidding

1214
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
You're trying to guess what each thing's worth

1215
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
And then at the end of the game

1216
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
However much money you have left

1217
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Plus the profit you've made on

1218
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Basically what the art pieces

1219
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Were valued at

1220
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Minus what you paid for them

1221
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
That's the profit you make off of

1222
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
And so at the end of the game you're trying to have the most profit

1223
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Awesome. Well, these games sound like a lot of fun

1224
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I love that, you know, it could have been tempting

1225
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
To probably just make

1226
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Sequels to everything

1227
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
In Party Pack 1

1228
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
And I'm sure that would have been a lot of fun too

1229
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
And you do have sequels, essentially, to fun games

1230
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
But you have a little bit of that but mixed with these new ideas

1231
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
And I think that sounds like it's going to be

1232
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
A lot of fun. I'm looking forward to playing it myself

1233
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I want to get to some of the questions

1234
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
In our chatroom over at

1235
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
live.vognetwork.com

1236
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
You know, we're a little bit delayed here

1237
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
So we're just now getting a question on the sound effect thing

1238
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And we have a question from Matt in our chatroom

1239
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So when someone actually farts in the office

1240
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Do you all just blame it on Andy?

1241
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Like the dog, since Andy's the sound guy

1242
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
We actually

1243
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Well, no, I'll tell you why

1244
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Because Andy, we're in Chicago

1245
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
And Andy is actually in Michigan

1246
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
So we have him

1247
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
On an iPad

1248
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
On a robotic

1249
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
You might have seen

1250
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
These things, but it's like

1251
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
A stand with a wheel

1252
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
And it's got his face on it

1253
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
So he comes to meetings

1254
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
And he moves around the office

1255
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
It's like a robot

1256
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
So to answer that specific question

1257
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
No, we would not expect

1258
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
It would have been Andy that farted

1259
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Because he's a state away

1260
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
He's on his segue

1261
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
But we do have

1262
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
A lot of us have sound effects

1263
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
At the ready at our desks

1264
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
To play at any moment during the day

1265
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
That's amazing

1266
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Of course, I know actually a lot of companies

1267
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
The working remotely

1268
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And all that is being more and more a thing

1269
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
So I'm not surprised to hear that at all

1270
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Let's see, Tigerclaw in our chatroom

1271
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Over at live.vognetwork.com saying

1272
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
It must be a challenge to come up with all

1273
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
The trivia in the game

1274
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Considering those questions get outdated

1275
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Faster after people play through it

1276
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Multiple times

1277
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Sure, that's a risk

1278
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
That just means people are enjoying your game too much

1279
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
That they wore out all the questions

1280
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
So let's come up with new questions

1281
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
For these games

1282
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Quiplash, the first version

1283
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Was out just a few months ago

1284
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
And now here we are coming up on

1285
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Quiplash XL

1286
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Where do all these prompts come from?

1287
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
How do you do it?

1288
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Well, thank you

1289
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
We have a great staff

1290
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Of writers that we have on staff

1291
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
It's a little bit different for each game

1292
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Quiplash

1293
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
The prompts are

1294
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
The challenge with those is not

1295
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Having too many that are similar

1296
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
To each other

1297
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Because in Quiplash XL we have a thousand

1298
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Prompts

1299
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
You're going to be hard pressed

1300
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
To get through all of them

1301
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
And some of those are from the original

1302
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Quiplash

1303
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
We've added on to the original

1304
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
So the challenge there is

1305
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Man, we've already

1306
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Asked about

1307
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
What

1308
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Pat Sajak's

1309
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
Breath smells like

1310
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Before

1311
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
So we can't do what

1312
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Alex Trebek's breath smells like

1313
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
So you get a lot of that kind of thing

1314
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
So that's the challenge there

1315
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Those are a little bit easier to come up with

1316
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Because they're not based on facts

1317
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
Now if you talk about something like Fibbage

1318
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Those are all sort of wacky

1319
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
News of the weird

1320
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Kind of things

1321
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
So you're kind of beholden to

1322
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Criminals and people out there

1323
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Just continuing to do stupid things

1324
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
And getting in the news

1325
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Which luckily they do

1326
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
So that's kind of

1327
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
With Fibbage it's sort of like you're constantly

1328
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Scouring the daily news

1329
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Updates to see what

1330
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Stupid person has done another stupid thing

1331
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Or has created some

1332
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Completely useless

1333
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
House made out of whatever

1334
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Florida Man

1335
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Yeah, Florida Man

1336
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Was everywhere on Facebook this week

1337
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Of the guy who lit his gas tank on fire

1338
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Trying to kill a spider

1339
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Oh yes, exactly

1340
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
And in fact those things go around the office

1341
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
And they're sent out and they're like

1342
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Fibbage 3, here's stuff

1343
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
For Fibbage 3

1344
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
You guys must have so much fun

1345
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
At the office passing all this stuff around

1346
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I mean, it must be just kind of like

1347
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Being a part of the game all day

1348
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
That's amazing

1349
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Yeah it's interesting and the thing is

1350
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
When you're doing something like a party pack

1351
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
You've got

1352
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Five mini teams

1353
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Out of a small group of people

1354
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
So some people aren't

1355
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Even working on certain games

1356
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
So you might be working on

1357
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Two or three and somebody else might be working on

1358
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Two or three, you might overlap on one

1359
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
But we keep a constant

1360
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Slack thread going at work

1361
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
So everybody kind of

1362
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Gets a little bit of insight into what's going on

1363
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
In all the other games, even if they're not on the team

1364
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
You kind of still feel a part of it

1365
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
So I think that's a really cool thing about where we work

1366
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Alright, let me get one more question here and then we'll

1367
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Wrap up because I know we've had you on for

1368
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Way longer than we usually say

1369
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
It's going to be 15, 20

1370
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Watmeme is in our chat

1371
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
And I have a feeling he might know this is a loaded question

1372
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
So this might be a good one to ask here

1373
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Watmeme in chat says, ask Steve-O

1374
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
What would be his dream version of

1375
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
You Don't Know Jack?

1376
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
I think I know who that is, but I'm not going to out him

1377
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I have a feeling I know who it is too

1378
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
But that's okay, I know this is a loaded question

1379
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
So please answer

1380
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Well the fact that he called me Steve-O

1381
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
The only people who call me Steve-O

1382
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Are the people who work at Jackbox

1383
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Because when I first started

1384
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
At the company back when it was Jellyvision

1385
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
There were like five Steves

1386
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
So they had to give every Steve a little slightly different thing

1387
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
And I got lucky, I got Steve-O

1388
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
There were some really weird ones

1389
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
So everywhere else I'm just Steve

1390
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
At Jackbox, I'm Steve-O

1391
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
So I know this is somebody who either

1392
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Been watching our streams or works anyway

1393
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I'm also going to say

1394
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Without telling people your full name

1395
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Your last name is not O

1396
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
So it's not like they just used the last initial

1397
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Right, there's not even an O in it

1398
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Yeah, exactly

1399
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Yeah, no

1400
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
My dream version of You Don't Know Jack

1401
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
You know, it's kind of hard to

1402
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Put my, you know, we did the TV show

1403
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Did you know we did a TV show of You Don't Know Jack?

1404
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Yeah, I did, I was probably, I think I was the one guy

1405
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
That watched it

1406
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Oh, you were him?

1407
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Oh, thank you

1408
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I was it with Paul Reubens, how could you not?

1409
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Because that was, was that before or after

1410
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
The infamous, I think that was after

1411
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
It was after, he was like resurrecting

1412
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
His career, he was doing that movie

1413
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Blow with Johnny Depp at the time

1414
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
That's right, that's right

1415
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I remember getting a Christmas card from him

1416
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
And it had him and Johnny Depp and a bunch of

1417
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Women from the show

1418
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
It was strange

1419
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
And there's supposed to be a new Peewee movie, but anyway

1420
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Yeah, so my point is

1421
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
We tried it as a TV show, we thought it'd be great

1422
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Because it's kind of like a TV show that you play

1423
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
But it, you know, it didn't work out that well

1424
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
It was, it had its, it didn't have its

1425
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
It had its qualities, but

1426
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
But like, as far as like the ideal

1427
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Version of You Don't Know Jack

1428
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I think if we could get it so that

1429
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
You could play with more than four people

1430
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
That you could stream it and that

1431
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
The great thing is

1432
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
That we still have Cookie, you know, our

1433
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Tom Gottlieb who plays Cookie Masterson

1434
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
You know, it just would not be

1435
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
The same without him, so thankfully

1436
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
We still have him, he's been around

1437
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Ever since, you know, You Don't Know Jack volume 3

1438
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Even before that, but he was

1439
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
The host of that, so it would have to have

1440
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Cookie Masterson, it would have to have

1441
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Support for more than four players

1442
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
And I already have ideas

1443
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
For the next version, but I don't want to

1444
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Give them all away here, plus I'll probably

1445
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Bring it all to work and people will be like, no

1446
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
So, hahaha

1447
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Act Deft in chat is suggesting a one versus

1448
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
100 You Don't Know Jack hybrid would be

1449
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
The best thing ever

1450
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
That's a direct quote, best thing ever

1451
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Oh, ever? Ever

1452
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
In that case we'll get right on it

1453
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Apparently better than this program

1454
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Or pornography even, who knew

1455
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
But there you go, Steve-o

1456
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I want to thank you so much for being on the show

1457
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Let's talk one more time everything

1458
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
People need to know about Jackbox Party Back

1459
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Jackbox Party Back 2 is out

1460
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
What, it's out this, like next week

1461
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Right, it's like ten days away, nine, right?

1462
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Yes, October 13th, so that's Tuesday

1463
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Tuesday, October 13th

1464
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Xbox One, PlayStation 3

1465
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
4, Steam

1466
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Amazon Fire TV, Google Play

1467
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
There you go, but

1468
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
No Wii U, Steve-o?

1469
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
No Wii U?

1470
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
You're speaking the language of Ben Jacobs

1471
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Our beloved programmer

1472
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Who is in love

1473
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
With all things Nintendo

1474
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
We all love Nintendo, but

1475
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Right now it's not the right platform for us

1476
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I understand, I understand, I'm just being

1477
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Twitter, because I know you guys have got to get those tweets

1478
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Once in a while, what about Wii U?

1479
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
But anyway, I understand, no, you guys are

1480
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Obviously supporting an awful lot there between all these different systems

1481
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
And uh,

1482
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
$24.99 local currency, right?

1483
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
$24.99 American

1484
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
And yeah, it's

1485
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I mean, I don't

1486
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I try not to sound like too sales pitchy

1487
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
When I say this, but like, the work that we put

1488
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Into each of these games, we feel like we could

1489
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Sell each one of these five games for like

1490
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
You know, $15 a piece

1491
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
So the fact that you get five of them for $24.99

1492
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I mean, you can't afford not to buy

1493
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Okay, there, I did it, I went

1494
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I went all file, I went all sales pitch

1495
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
It's $5 a game, $5 a game

1496
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Yeah, $5 a game, there you go

1497
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Alright, well Steve-o, best of luck to all you guys at Jackbox Games

1498
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
And you guys are welcome back anytime

1499
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
To announce whatever it is you might be working

1500
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
On next, I assume inevitably

1501
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Someday this will be so successful

1502
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
We might be here in a few months

1503
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Talking about Jackbox Party Pack 3

1504
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
We will call you from our yacht

1505
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Sounds good, I look forward to it

1506
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Alright, thanks for having me on guys

1507
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Alright, take care, thanks so much for being here

1508
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Alright, bye

1509
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Alright, that was Steve from Jackbox Games

1510
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Of course, as they call him around the office

1511
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Steve-o, and if you want to read more about what Jackbox is up to

1512
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Jackboxgames.com

1513
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
They're on Twitter as well

1514
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Over at Jackbox Games

1515
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
And they're on Facebook

1516
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Hey, you know where? Jackbox Games, there it is

1517
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
And I know I'll be picking up Jackbox Party Pack 2

1518
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
On next day, I can't promise that I'm going to live stream

1519
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Because I don't need you all messing with my game

1520
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
But no, maybe I will

1521
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Maybe I will do something

1522
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I think that bomb game with everybody involved

1523
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Will be a lot of fun

1524
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Bomb Corp, will be a lot of fun to play with everybody

1525
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
To register participation

1526
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
For this week's episode of Orange On Radio

1527
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
At vognetwork.com

1528
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Use the passphrase, bacon

1529
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Alright, we're going to move right back

1530
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Into the show

1531
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
And start to get into some news

1532
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I'm going to talk about my own gaming week though

1533
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I didn't really get a chance to get to my gaming week

1534
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
But I don't have a whole lot to add

1535
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Because I bought stuff, I bought Lego dimensions

1536
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
But I haven't played it yet

1537
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
So this week, what I've actually been playing

1538
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I've been playing an awful lot of Diablo 3

1539
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I finally passed Paragon level 200

1540
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
For the season

1541
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
That'll tell you how much I've been playing Diablo 3

1542
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
But once I finish the set bonus

1543
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
For my Demon Hunter, oh my gosh

1544
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I just mow things down

1545
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
I've been having a lot of fun with that

1546
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I finally got around to playing

1547
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
And if Cody is out there listening, or even Extover

1548
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
They're going to be both so proud of me that I finally got around to this game

1549
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
On the Xbox One

1550
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I finally played Ori and the Blind Forest

1551
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I picked that up in a sale

1552
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
A couple months ago

1553
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Finally decided to sit down and play this game

1554
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
And I've got to say

1555
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
It's got a really moving intro

1556
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Just in the beginning

1557
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Just in the first 10 minutes of the game

1558
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
I was like, oh god, it's going to be one of those types of games

1559
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
That really kind of moves you with the story

1560
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Even though the narrator kept reminding me

1561
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Of one of the dragons in Final Fantasy 14

1562
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
If you've played Heaven's Word

1563
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
You'll know what I'm talking about

1564
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
If you haven't, don't worry about it

1565
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
It sounds like the narrator in Ori and the Blind Forest

1566
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Ori and the Blind Forest is a Metroidvania

1567
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
To use that term

1568
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
It's one of those types of games

1569
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
It's obviously a different type of setting

1570
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And the character is very different

1571
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
And the fact that you have this ability

1572
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Where you can kind of consistently jump up a wall

1573
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
In the very beginning of the game

1574
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
It's like one of the first abilities you get

1575
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Causes the level design to be very different

1576
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Because you have a lot of curvatures

1577
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
And branches and nature

1578
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
And other ways that kind of prevent you from just jumping

1579
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Up all the walls

1580
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
So in that way it kind of makes the design of the game

1581
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
A lot different from games I've seen before

1582
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
And the art direction of the game

1583
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Is great

1584
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
It's a beautiful game

1585
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
And so yeah, I've got to say

1586
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I am really enjoying Ori and the Blind Forest

1587
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
The one little drawback

1588
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Where I'm at so far

1589
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Is that the difficulty of the game goes up really fast

1590
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
And you start getting into

1591
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
If you think

1592
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Loki makes asshole Mario Maker levels

1593
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Wait until you play some of these things

1594
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
In Ori and the Blind Forest

1595
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
There's some really tough parts of the game

1596
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Granted, you can save your game

1597
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Essentially at any time

1598
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And I thought that was also an interesting mechanic

1599
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
If you have enough energy

1600
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Which you collect from exploding plants

1601
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
And inanimate objects

1602
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
And monsters as you kill them as well

1603
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
You get a little bit of energy

1604
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
You can create a save point anywhere

1605
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
So that makes getting through some of these excruciatingly difficult parts

1606
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
A little bit easier

1607
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Unless of course you create your save portal

1608
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
At a horrible place

1609
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
But I really enjoyed

1610
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Ori and the Blind Forest

1611
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
And I want to play more of it in this coming week

1612
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
So that was pretty much my gaming week

1613
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Diablo 3 and Ori and the Blind Forest

1614
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Housekeeping tonight

1615
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
We do not have any shows off planned

1616
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
But remember

1617
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
DarkSakura and I

1618
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Will be, we should start promoting this

1619
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
DarkSakura and I will be at

1620
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
GamerX or GX3 is what they're calling it

1621
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Because they want to make sure the message is out there

1622
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
That everybody games

1623
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
You don't have to be gay to enjoy GamerX

1624
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
But it helps, no I'm just kidding

1625
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Everybody will enjoy it

1626
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
No matter what

1627
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
If you're a part of the quilt bag or you're not

1628
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
You're going to have a good time there

1629
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
We will be there

1630
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
We have a panel that DarkSakura and I will be on

1631
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I'm actually moderating it

1632
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Podcast Cross Zone 3

1633
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Really excited about that

1634
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
And I totally forget the time and the moment

1635
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I can't remember if it's Friday or Saturday night

1636
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
But we are actually going to be there

1637
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
And DarkSakura and I still have to figure out how this is even going to work

1638
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
VOG Network, if you haven't heard

1639
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Is a sponsor of GX3

1640
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
We helped pitch in for the Kickstarter

1641
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
I've always been a fan

1642
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Of this concept

1643
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
So we pitched in

1644
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
For people somewhere at the convention

1645
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
So this is, I believe

1646
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
The first time

1647
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Maybe because Bobby has done some of those Atlanta meetups

1648
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
But this is going to be the first time

1649
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
We've actually had a table at a show

1650
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
And you can come by and say hi

1651
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
And we're going to figure out

1652
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
I don't know if we're going to have a classic game available

1653
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Or if we're actually going to be recording bits

1654
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
For use on air

1655
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Which I think is going to be a big part of what we're doing

1656
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
We're working on a top secret project behind the scenes

1657
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
So we're going to be doing a lot of interviews

1658
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
And nerds alike

1659
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Getting their viewpoints

1660
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
So we'll be there at GX3

1661
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
That's in San Jose December 11th and 12th

1662
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
That weekend

1663
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
I also take bribery in the form of fan art of my characters

1664
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
In Dragon Age

1665
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
There you go

1666
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Bobby Blackwell says

1667
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
We've never had a table

1668
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
And using that in quotes

1669
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
We've actually had to turn down tables out there

1670
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
Because I'm only one person and don't want to be tied to a table

1671
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
The good news is

1672
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
We're going to have more people

1673
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
I know myself and DarkSoccer are going to be there for sure

1674
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
And we might enlist the help of some of our friends

1675
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
To help us man the table

1676
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Or we'll man the table

1677
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Or whatever the table when we're not there

1678
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
So we'll work on it

1679
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Anyhow, that's all I have to announce

1680
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
We are ready to get into some news

1681
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
So let's start it off

1682
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
With what's going on in the gaming world this week

1683
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Loki

1684
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
So Microsoft has purchased Havoc Physics

1685
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
The middleware

1686
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
For calculating physics and animation

1687
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
From Intel and they've used it on a bunch of their games

1688
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
So what's this mean?

1689
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Don't know yet

1690
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
But I know that one of the big games that uses that

1691
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
That's coming up soon will be Crackdown 3

1692
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
And of course they've used it recently

1693
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
In Destiny, Dragon Age

1694
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Inquisition, Call of Duty, Advanced Warfare

1695
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
A lot of the major games end up using that

1696
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
And

1697
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Basically they've

1698
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Asserted that they're going to continue to innovate

1699
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
For the benefit of the

1700
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Development partners and part of this innovation

1701
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Will include building more complex

1702
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
More complete

1703
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Cloud service

1704
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Which they're kind of demonstrating

1705
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
With Crackdown 3

1706
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Having everything fully destructible

1707
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
So

1708
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Is this going to create interesting scenarios

1709
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Where the Havoc Engine might be used

1710
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
On a Playstation game and I know I've seen that happen

1711
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Before

1712
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
I don't know if they're going to lock it down to just one

1713
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Platform and stuff, I think it's just another revenue

1714
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Source for them

1715
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Maybe more of a thing to kind of

1716
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Sell their servers

1717
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
And stuff like that

1718
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I don't know

1719
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I hope not

1720
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
That would be kind of dickish

1721
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Tigerclaw in chat says

1722
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Havoc has been in a lot of games

1723
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
That we played

1724
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Havoc is out there a lot

1725
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
I think if they did lock it down that there would probably

1726
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Be an alternative that would come about

1727
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Gotcha

1728
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
That's true

1729
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Somebody will inevitably

1730
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Copy it I suppose

1731
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Just like all those Minecraft clones

1732
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Except Minecraft still exists on so many platforms

1733
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
And they're still supporting it

1734
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Just because Microsoft owns it

1735
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Doesn't mean they'll cut off support completely

1736
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
They know where the money is

1737
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
As many platforms as possible

1738
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
What meme in our chat is saying

1739
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Gotta say Xbox is killing it

1740
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Since Phil Spencer took over

1741
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
You know I agree

1742
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I totally do

1743
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I don't know if I would go so far as to say killing it

1744
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
But definitely like

1745
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Turn that shit around

1746
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Would be maybe the phrase I would use

1747
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Because I'm sorry

1748
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
But it was not going well under

1749
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Don Mattrick and I'm sure he's a fine person

1750
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
And I hope I don't miss out on a potential

1751
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Coffee date someday because of my big mouth

1752
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
But I'm just saying

1753
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
All that razz on the

1754
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
Xbox one

1755
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Was under his leadership

1756
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
But yeah when Phil Spencer took over

1757
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Focusing on the positive

1758
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
You know you really sense that turn around

1759
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
And one thing I really enjoy about Phil Spencer

1760
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Is that he kind of admits

1761
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
About the competition, you get the sense

1762
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
From Phil Spencer that he plays games

1763
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Like he is a gamer

1764
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
He plays games, okay yeah he's a business guy too

1765
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
But like he'll acknowledge like yeah

1766
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Sony, Nintendo, doing good stuff

1767
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
You know we're trying to offer our own stuff

1768
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Over here that we think is really good

1769
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Each generation has their kind of fails

1770
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I mean there's PlayStation 3 kind of

1771
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Botched the launch

1772
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
You know Xbox One

1773
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
Sort of botched the launch at first

1774
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
But so did PlayStation 3

1775
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
PlayStation 3 as I mentioned

1776
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
And then Wii U

1777
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
That's true

1778
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
Everybody gets their turn at the fuck up table

1779
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
But everybody

1780
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Does awesome things too

1781
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
As much as we razz the companies

1782
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
When they do things not so well

1783
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Things should get called out when they're done well too

1784
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Even with Wii U

1785
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I know a lot of Nintendo fanboys would fight me

1786
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
And with good reasons because there are

1787
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
A lot of great

1788
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Exclusive experiences on Wii U

1789
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
And in fact I was just asked the other day

1790
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
About what console should I get

1791
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
And I said did you consider Wii U

1792
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Did you give it some serious consideration

1793
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Because you know there's some great games on it

1794
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
And maybe you'll decide well it doesn't have Call of Duty

1795
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
So I don't really want it

1796
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
But you know you gotta at least consider it at this point

1797
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
So anyway sorry we went on a tangent

1798
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Here over at live.vognetwork.com

1799
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Anyhow let's move on to another story

1800
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Speaking of Wii U I swear this was not all set up

1801
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
For a transition but

1802
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Splatoon of course being one of those games

1803
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
That are really swinging the people over to the Wii U

1804
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
And apparently Splatoon has been hacked

1805
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Because you know what they say

1806
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Because the hacker's gonna hack

1807
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Hack hack hack

1808
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Well apparently a Splatoon hacker

1809
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Was online and can like

1810
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Screw up your save file

1811
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
If your character won't load up when you're going

1812
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
In the main plaza

1813
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
And I guess it's like an

1814
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Octoling that will carry

1815
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
The Hydra Splatling

1816
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
So obviously it's a hacker because the thing hasn't released

1817
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Yet and what happens to get

1818
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Around this don't leave the room until

1819
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
They're gone because returning

1820
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Back to the base is what screws up the save

1821
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
File and there's a character in the game

1822
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Whose name is K and it has numbers in it

1823
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
But nobody's gotten the full name

1824
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
But you worry that something like this is

1825
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Probably spread around

1826
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Pretty quickly so

1827
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Be careful

1828
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Some folks actually found out that it's kinda

1829
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Easy to play as an Octoling in

1830
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Online matches

1831
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
There's a whole YouTube video that walks you through

1832
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
It that you do a text modification to the player

1833
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
ID in the save file

1834
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I'm obviously not gonna get into the details here

1835
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I'm just gonna say it's out there

1836
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
But I guess this is all gonna be

1837
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Patched by the time the next Splatfest

1838
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Comes out because that's when they'll do an update to the game

1839
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
And certainly this is gonna get

1840
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
This is gonna get sewed right up

1841
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
So that doesn't happen anymore

1842
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
By the way the theme has been announced for the next Splatfest

1843
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Friday October 9th

1844
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
At 9pm for 24 hours

1845
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
It will be

1846
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Planes versus

1847
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Cars

1848
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Do you prefer to travel by plane

1849
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Or do you prefer to travel by car

1850
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
I think it should be three teams

1851
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Planes, trains and automobiles

1852
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
There you go there's no team train

1853
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Japan always does things differently

1854
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Maybe they'll have team train

1855
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Or Europe will get something else

1856
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
But anyway I'm gonna be team plane

1857
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Just because

1858
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
I like car trips too but you know

1859
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Planes take me to places like Hawaii

1860
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
That the car doesn't get me to so

1861
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I'm gonna be team plane for that one

1862
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Just in case you wanna be playing with me

1863
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
But keep in mind Rob you have to take the car to get to the plane

1864
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
That is true

1865
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Well you could take transit you could take a train to get to the plane

1866
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
But you could also take a bus

1867
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
You could

1868
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Or a van

1869
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
You could take the train to the plane that will take you to the rain in Spain

1870
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
The automobile is more versatile

1871
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I would go with the automobile

1872
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Yes but they don't serve you alcoholic

1873
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Beverages in the automobile

1874
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
In fact it's against the law

1875
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
They don't know what I'm doing in the backseat

1876
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
That's not true though

1877
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
In limos they do serve you

1878
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Hell yeah

1879
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Yeah but it's not team limo

1880
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Limo is a type of car so

1881
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Whatever whatever alright

1882
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Let's move on Dark Soccer what do you have for us

1883
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I have some crap

1884
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Anyway

1885
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
We all like our humble bundles don't we

1886
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
And now we have the

1887
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Humble Monthly Bundle

1888
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Woo

1889
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
So they are doing a

1890
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
And I'm quoting a highly curated bundle

1891
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Of favorite games once a month

1892
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
It's gonna be

1893
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
The Humble Monthly Bundle costs 12 bucks a month

1894
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
And it will show games

1895
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
That have been in the various weekly ones

1896
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
And some that haven't been featured

1897
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
And of course 5% of the subscription

1898
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Goes to charity

1899
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
So like right now

1900
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
We have Legend of Grimrock 2

1901
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
In there right now

1902
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
You can just go to

1903
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
HumbleBundle.com

1904
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
monthly and have a look at it

1905
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I guess it shouldn't be too surprising

1906
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
That you know with the Loot Crate

1907
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
What the Dollar Shave

1908
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Club There's a Pusheen one now

1909
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Oh for Loot Crate

1910
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
No not well Loot Crate

1911
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
But it's a Pusheen

1912
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Oh like a Pusheen of the Month Club

1913
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
I remember when the Blank of the Month Club

1914
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Was something that you would read about

1915
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Speaking of planes like in SkyMall Magazine

1916
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Or like just something they would

1917
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Advertise on TV or the

1918
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Columbia House get 12 CDs

1919
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
For a dollar and then they're gonna send

1920
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
You the CDs of the month and if you don't like them

1921
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Send it back like it seems like that whole thing is

1922
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Back like big time like it

1923
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
If I could send the games back

1924
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
You'd get different games because a lot of them I probably already have

1925
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Yeah that's the one problem with Humble Bundle

1926
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
But when you consider your charity

1927
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
There's always a good element of it too

1928
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
To throw in there

1929
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Feel like you're doing a little bit of good with the games

1930
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I don't know I'll have to look into it

1931
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I might actually jump on this

1932
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Might be a good way to force myself to play some games

1933
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
That I wouldn't usually play

1934
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Let's travel around the world and check out some

1935
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Release dates some things that we'll be playing

1936
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
A little sooner than

1937
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
Perhaps what is coming up in the Humble Bundle next month

1938
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Starting in the US

1939
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Loki

1940
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Alright so starting off we've got

1941
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Dragon Age Inquisition Game of the Year edition

1942
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Yes the one on the DLC

1943
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I'll get another one

1944
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
That's on Playstation 4 and Xbox One

1945
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Here's your chance to get it on another platform

1946
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
That could be that's what I do

1947
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
No because I can't mod other platforms

1948
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Disgaea 5

1949
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Alliance of Vengeance on Playstation 4

1950
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Dengeki

1951
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Bunko Fighting Climax

1952
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
On Playstation 3 and Vita

1953
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Did you say Bunko Fighting Climax

1954
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Yeah Dengeki Bunko

1955
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Bunk that's the game my mom would play

1956
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
That's with a C not a K

1957
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,000
I'm like how do you do Bunko Fighting?

1958
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Do the dice get up and attack each other?

1959
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
That's what I saw in my mind

1960
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Bunko Fighters

1961
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Grandma's gonna throw down

1962
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Cause she didn't get the roll she wanted

1963
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Sorry Loki

1964
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
There's a little known game called Rock Band 4

1965
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
That's coming out this week as well

1966
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
On Playstation 4 and Xbox One

1967
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
And if you want to get it with some instruments

1968
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
They have all those available for you as well

1969
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Transformers Devastation

1970
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
The Platinum Games

1971
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Transformers

1972
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
That's coming out on Playstation 4

1973
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
And Xbox One as well

1974
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Ride on Playstation 4

1975
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:26,000
I guess Devastation is also on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

1976
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Farming Simulator 16 on Vita

1977
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
I thought I've seen that before but I guess

1978
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
It's been delayed again

1979
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Gotta wait for that

1980
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Man

1981
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
As if we're not in the fourth quarter already

1982
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Alright

1983
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
And then the next thing I've got

1984
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Let's see

1985
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Brace yourself winter is coming

1986
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
And then finally on

1987
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I guess this is Sunday or Friday

1988
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Chibi Robo Ziplash on 3DS

1989
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
I think it's the one with the amiibo

1990
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Oh yes they have one with an amiibo

1991
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:00,000
And then Uncharted the Nathan Drake collection on Playstation 4 is coming

1992
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,000
And Sid Meier's Civilization Beyond Earth Rising Tide

1993
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
So that's an expansion for an expansion

1994
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Oh no it's an expansion for the new game

1995
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
That's right

1996
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
And that's it

1997
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Alright

1998
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
By the way in chat over at live.vognetware.com

1999
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Dark Tetsuya says Bunko Fighters

2000
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Is that another dream game?

2001
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Nah I don't think we could

2002
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Officially put it on the dream game list

2003
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
But if like YYR hears this

2004
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
And like that's my next game

2005
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I'm not gonna complain

2006
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
So I'm just saying

2007
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Alright anyway

2008
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Let's travel to Japan and look at the Playstation 4

2009
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Where this week FIFA 16

2010
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Gets its release in regular and deluxe edition

2011
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
On October the 8th

2012
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Also Grand Theft Auto 5 gets a price reduction

2013
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
It moves into the best hit series

2014
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
And the Uncharted collection is out this week

2015
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
In Japan as well

2016
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Moving over to the Wii U

2017
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Nada

2018
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
In fact their next release

2019
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I don't think they have anything until November actually

2020
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
In Japan

2021
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
For the Wii U so you might not be reading those dates

2022
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
For a while

2023
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
But on the Playstation Vita

2024
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Actually this is the first week in a while we don't have anything on the Vita

2025
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
We have a

2026
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Neptune vs. Zombie Gundam

2027
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Gekkei Jigen Tag Blank

2028
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
comes out next week

2029
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
But that's on the 15th

2030
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
So this is finally a quiet week on the Vita in Japan

2031
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Could that be because

2032
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
They're expecting a big reception to

2033
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Guru Guru Chibi Robo

2034
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
In regular and amiibo set over in Japan

2035
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
That is releasing on October the 8th as well

2036
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
I hear this is gonna be the last Chibi Robo game they do

2037
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Well if it sells well

2038
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Then of course they'll do another one

2039
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I think they kind of made that

2040
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
I don't wanna say a threat but it was a threat

2041
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Like on Twitter like you know

2042
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Well if it doesn't sell well

2043
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
I'm kind of fine with that

2044
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Anyway also on the 3DS

2045
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
A price reduction for Simogami Tensei 4

2046
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
As it moves into the Atlas Best collection

2047
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
So that is what you have to look forward to

2048
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
In Japan this week

2049
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Let's go over to the UK

2050
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
With Dark Sakura

2051
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
On October 6th we have Prison Architect

2052
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
For Mac and for PC

2053
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Blackband 4 comes out on

2054
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
Xbox One and Playstation 4

2055
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Skyhill comes out on Mac and PC

2056
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
And then on October 8th

2057
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
We have Bridge Constructor Stunts

2058
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
For Android

2059
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
That's it

2060
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Alright just a few more stories for you guys

2061
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
And then the classic game of the week

2062
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Loki?

2063
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Alright I'm surprised well

2064
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Bridge Constructor that's kind of what people do in that

2065
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Anyways it just makes stunts so I'm surprised it took them this long

2066
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
To actually release something like that

2067
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Criterion

2068
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
They're working on

2069
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Possibly a successor to Burnout

2070
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
And that makes me happy

2071
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Because I want more Burnout

2072
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
And this is coming from a Twitter conversation

2073
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
They're saying you know

2074
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
What they're working on

2075
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Two things first the game is a multiplayer sports game

2076
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Coming spring of 2016

2077
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Which I remember that's that like

2078
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
I think there's like an off-road

2079
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Racing sports thing

2080
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
That they've got coming

2081
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
And then the other one

2082
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
It says then we make a driving game

2083
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
What sort of driving game you ask?

2084
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
A spiritual successor

2085
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Speed traffic and crashing lots and lots

2086
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Of crashing

2087
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Yes please

2088
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
That's what I need in my Burnout

2089
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Game is just big fiery

2090
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Car crashes

2091
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
I don't understand why no one would fund

2092
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Or like

2093
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Put money towards another Burnout game

2094
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I mean come on

2095
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
How well of these Need for Speed games have done

2096
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Not very good

2097
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I bet if they went to Kickstarter they'd get it

2098
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
If it was like fucking Burnout and said Need for Speed

2099
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Way better

2100
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Alright

2101
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Speaking of crowdfunding

2102
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Maybe Criterion

2103
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
And those employees aren't doing this

2104
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
But Cave is thinking about it

2105
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
You want some shooters on the Playstation 4

2106
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Some more shooters

2107
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Cave is thinking about

2108
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Getting some crowdfunding

2109
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
They're asking on Facebook

2110
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Could we get $300,000 to $500,000

2111
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
To do

2112
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Actually that's the Steam port

2113
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
But a million would allow them to do a Playstation 4 port

2114
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
And they're saying for 3 million

2115
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
They'll do a new game as well

2116
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
To a console

2117
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
So I don't know

2118
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
That seems like an awful lot of money

2119
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
But then again

2120
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
If they're selling it for $20 a pop

2121
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
They would have to get what

2122
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
15,000 people

2123
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
To get on board

2124
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
That's a lot of money for

2125
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I don't know

2126
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I can't imagine an arcade game

2127
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Having that kind of budget

2128
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
It would depend

2129
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
On

2130
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
It's also like how into

2131
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
These types of games are you

2132
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Maybe we say that we dismiss it

2133
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Because we're not super into shooters

2134
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
But you know some people really love their bullet hell games

2135
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I'm not even thinking necessarily the genre

2136
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I'm just thinking of how complex of a game it is

2137
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
I mean yeah I understand there's bullet patterns

2138
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
And all that stuff but really how much

2139
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
How many art assets are you talking there

2140
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
I mean the level design

2141
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
I just don't see that as being a very in depth

2142
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Game that would require 3 million

2143
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Dollars to

2144
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Make another one of

2145
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I mean I just don't know

2146
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Well that's fair

2147
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Well we are going to take a trip down memory lane

2148
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
With Dark Sakura

2149
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
And Dark Sakura is going to step into the gaming vault

2150
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
And find a game that she thinks

2151
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
You kids should check out this game this week

2152
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
It is the classic game

2153
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Of the week with Dark

2154
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
Sakura

2155
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I think this is kind of an

2156
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Obscure pick this week but I don't know that's just me

2157
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
It was one of my favorites that I had

2158
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Alright so what is the classic

2159
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Game of the week this week?

2160
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
The game is SNK Gals Fighter

2161
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
It was a one on one

2162
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Fighting game that

2163
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Came out on the Neo Geo Pocket Color

2164
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
In 2000

2165
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
I played the stew out of this game

2166
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Just because I really liked it and it was really funny

2167
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
So this was for the

2168
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
Queen of Fighters tournament

2169
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
That was organized by a Miss X

2170
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Who is really

2171
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Yori Yagami dressed up in drag

2172
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
So that they could

2173
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Win the K talisman that grants any

2174
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Wish so

2175
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
It's really just like a little

2176
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Sd fighter it's really cute

2177
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
And it's very similar to how

2178
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
The King of Fighters

2179
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
R1 and R2 played but a little bit faster

2180
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
So it was

2181
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Honestly like I said one of my

2182
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Favorite games ever that came out on

2183
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
The Neo Geo Pocket Color

2184
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
You could play as

2185
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Mai Shiranui from

2186
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Fatal Fury 2

2187
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
You had Athena from Psycho Soldier

2188
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Yuri from Art of Fighting 2

2189
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Leona from King of Fighters 96

2190
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Shirmi from King of Fighters 97

2191
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Also the namesake of my cat

2192
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Nakoru from Samurai

2193
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Shiki from

2194
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Samurai Shodown 64

2195
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
And Akari from The Last Blade

2196
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
You also had hidden characters

2197
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
You had Whip and you had

2198
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Yuki Kushinata who was

2199
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Kyo's girlfriend

2200
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
In King of Fighters 97 and it's the only fighting

2201
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Game she's actually been playable in

2202
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
And of course your boss is Miss X

2203
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Who is Yori from

2204
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
King of Fighters

2205
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
So it was

2206
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
I mean

2207
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
There's not really so much to say about it

2208
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
It is really just a

2209
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
A little fighting game

2210
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
But a lot of the little stuff

2211
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
The you know attacks

2212
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
In it were really just made comical

2213
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
You uh

2214
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
For a chibi pocket version

2215
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Of the game cause you know a lot of the pocket

2216
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Versions of fighting games were straight up

2217
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Bad like if you played Mortal Kombat

2218
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
On the original Game Boy it's really

2219
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Bad but this

2220
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
You know again I haven't played this

2221
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
But this looks like okay

2222
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
It's a chibi cartoony like you know

2223
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Amped up silly I guess

2224
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Version of the game but it looks

2225
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Surprisingly fluid for a pocket game

2226
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
Oh yeah it was really good

2227
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
I mean it was surprisingly good

2228
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
And you know

2229
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Even with the limitations

2230
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Of the system at the time it was

2231
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Very solid I played

2232
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
I probably played through this game for

2233
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Until I beat it with everybody

2234
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
And I always forget that

2235
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Athena in this game is the same Athena

2236
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
From the NES game

2237
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
It's like a soldier

2238
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Crazy

2239
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
There it is

2240
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
And that's actually the outfit

2241
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
That she's wearing in that one

2242
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Is her King of Fighters 99 outfit

2243
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
So there you go

2244
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
That's all I have to say

2245
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
This is the only version of this game ever that's been out

2246
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
And it's just

2247
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Really cute and very funny

2248
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
So you get

2249
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
You know little cameos

2250
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
From some of the other characters of course

2251
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
From the various SNK series

2252
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
In endings and backgrounds

2253
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
And whatnot

2254
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Well you know sometimes she picks

2255
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
A mainstream game but sometimes she picks

2256
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
A more obscure game that hey maybe you hadn't

2257
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Heard of this and considering it was only on the Neo Geo Pocket

2258
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Color I'm going to assume a lot of people

2259
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Probably never heard of this so there it is

2260
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
SNK Gals Fighters

2261
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I didn't even know about this game

2262
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I love that she just drew a picture and now she's singing

2263
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Karaoke as one of her moves

2264
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Yeah if you want to borrow it

2265
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Did Leona just strap dynamite to her?

2266
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Wow

2267
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
She has the earring bomb but they changed it for the game

2268
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
For this one

2269
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
So it's just really cute

2270
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
It's kind of fun

2271
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
If you're interested in borrowing it I would be more than happy

2272
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
To lend you a Neo Geo Pocket Color in the game

2273
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Sweet

2274
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Bring your own batteries

2275
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
I like dark soccer she gives me stuff

2276
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Which I still need to bring over some of my

2277
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Super Famicom, not my Super but my

2278
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Actually I do have a few Super Famicom cartridges

2279
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
And my Famicom cartridges

2280
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
I don't even think I talked yet on the show

2281
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
About what I bought, no that's okay

2282
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Because we'll talk about that at the start of part B

2283
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Let that be our teaser

2284
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
I have a few

2285
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
We are going to take a break and we'll talk about that

2286
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
We're going to talk about the FUGL Question of the Week

2287
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Which has to do with multiplayer games

2288
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Since we had Jackbox on tonight and they really

2289
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Excel at doing those multiplayer games

2290
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Thought we would have a question about that tonight

2291
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
So we're going to talk that with you guys

2292
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Your phone calls and 1877 game OLR

2293
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
And emails which I think

2294
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
There's quite a few emails tonight

2295
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Dark soccer is going to be busy during the email segment

2296
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Yay! So we'll get to all that

2297
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
When we come back after this break with more

2298
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Of Orange Lounge Radio right after this

2299
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Welcome back everybody

2300
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
To Orange Lounge Radio

2301
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
We are live tonight with our

2302
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
616th episode, it's the second half

2303
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
For this October the 4th

2304
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Of 2015 and I

2305
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Can't believe it's already October

2306
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Where's this year gone? And 616?

2307
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Didn't we just celebrate episode 600?

2308
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Oh my gosh where'd this year go

2309
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
At least the good news is now that it's

2310
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
October it is officially time

2311
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
For Pumpkin All the Things

2312
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
And I'm very excited about the Pumpkin All the Things

2313
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Time of year

2314
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
You know I got my pumpkin spice latte

2315
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
I love all of them actually

2316
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
I had those pumpkin latte M&M's they were great

2317
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
You know what else is also a good season for?

2318
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
If you happen to like that kind of thing

2319
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Root vegetables

2320
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Oh because this is the time of year where a lot of those

2321
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Are in season and so forth

2322
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Which pumpkin kind of is

2323
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Well we have an amazing cafe at work

2324
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
And I'll just leave it here

2325
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
I've been having some stomach problems so I haven't been able to

2326
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Eat a lot of heavy crazy foods

2327
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
They had one that was like rutabaga

2328
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
And beets and parsnips and carrots

2329
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
And everything and I am enjoying

2330
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Carrot ginger soup

2331
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Yeah ginger is amazing

2332
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
It's a great spice

2333
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
I feel weird calling it a spice but you know it's a great flavor

2334
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Well it's also really good if you

2335
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Have stomach problems

2336
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
I love ginger beer and you can't get it

2337
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
At every store but like

2338
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Bathmo

2339
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Oh my god I have to tell you

2340
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
This is completely off topic

2341
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
That's okay we do that here at OLR and you the most

2342
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
They're opening a total wine by my house

2343
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Total wine gets frivolous

2344
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Oh so you're going to be a total lush

2345
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
Yep and I will get you ginger beer

2346
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
When I go get my frivolous

2347
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
My favorite is that there is a total wine

2348
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
It's over by for you SAC people which is I know

2349
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
A very small percentage of our audience

2350
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
There's a big mall there's a total wine

2351
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Not far from there but the hilarious

2352
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Thing on the back side of

2353
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
The plaza the side that's by Chick-fil-A

2354
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
For those that happen to know the area

2355
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
No it says

2356
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
On the sign still circuit city

2357
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
How long

2358
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Has circuit city been gone

2359
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
And it's still on the sign

2360
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Where total wine is

2361
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
That's the building they converted

2362
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Oh my gosh drives me crazy

2363
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
It's still in the shape of the big plug

2364
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Who remembers the commercials

2365
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
That was always the cool part of the store

2366
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
But that one is the one they use for the Halloween

2367
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Store right they rent out that building once in a while

2368
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
I think so and it was also like stupid

2369
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Prices or something I don't know

2370
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
It's called stupid prices

2371
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
It's a recent history

2372
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
We're local there it is

2373
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Once in a while I'll get those tweets

2374
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
That are like it's so weird to hear about

2375
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
Local things on OLR I forget they're in my neighborhood

2376
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
That actually happened to me on Tumblr by the way

2377
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
I was posting I was like

2378
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Yeah we got like 10 minutes of rain

2379
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
You know it was a few days ago and

2380
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
I was like I wish we had more and then I tagged

2381
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
At Sacramento and one of

2382
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
The people who follows me is like oh my god

2383
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
I live in Santa Clara

2384
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Yeah and I can speak Bay Area too

2385
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
That's the good news there's a lot of people there

2386
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I met my friend Brian the pagan

2387
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Jew on

2388
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Hi Free Looking Brian

2389
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
But you know that's how I met my friend that way

2390
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
And he and his husband

2391
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Razi

2392
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
But I feel fortunate through OLR

2393
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
If we can have a cheesy moment for a minute

2394
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
I feel fortunate through OLR that I do feel like

2395
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
I know people

2396
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
And I have acquaintances if not friends

2397
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
Like in almost every major

2398
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
City in America because

2399
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Of you know Twitter

2400
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Podcasting and things that have happened

2401
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
Because of this show and I'm so thankful for that

2402
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Anyway not to get too warm and fuzzy

2403
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
But it's just a reality it's how I feel

2404
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
I can't help the feels

2405
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Let's land back into reality for a minute

2406
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Here though because at the end of part A

2407
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Dark Soccer was teasing this about Loaning Me

2408
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Games so I suppose it's time we talk

2409
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
About another big purchase I made today

2410
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
I was really I needed retail

2411
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
I didn't need retail therapy but it's one of those things that you don't

2412
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Realize you need it until you're doing it

2413
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I bought a Retron 5 today

2414
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
And I've been talking about doing that

2415
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
For a while

2416
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
But I finally did it today

2417
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
And I did it because

2418
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Well the Retron 5 will play the NES

2419
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
The Super Nintendo, the GBA

2420
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Famicom and

2421
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Genesis, did I say Genesis?

2422
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
But those are the five

2423
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Systems it does, sadly it will not do Neo Geo

2424
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Pocket Color

2425
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
It also will not do like

2426
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Super Game Boy and add on games

2427
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
So because I do recall reading a review

2428
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
Where it won't do Sonic and Knuckles

2429
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Interesting

2430
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Like any of the add on type games

2431
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
Well that's okay and part of the reason I did it

2432
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
And I know there's mixed reviews on

2433
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Retron I know I'm going into it with that

2434
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
But the HDMI support

2435
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
I think is pretty cool and

2436
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Will help me a lot in streaming

2437
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Wink wink nudge nudge

2438
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
So that was you know and the price is actually

2439
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Cheaper where I got it than it was on Amazon

2440
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
And how often do you see that so

2441
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Yeah and Tigerclaw on chat

2442
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Even saying you need to do some games

2443
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
For the Retron 5 on Twitch and that's the plan

2444
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
And SSJ with that same comment

2445
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
About the add on games

2446
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
So yeah

2447
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
There you go

2448
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
And AkumaJP is reminding me

2449
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Not to mention international in regards to

2450
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Our audience, that's true

2451
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Like I actually

2452
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
AkumaJP I feel fortunate that if I went to

2453
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Japan some day

2454
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
He could help me out in some of the culture shock

2455
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
And getting to different places I needed to go

2456
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Same thing if I were to ever

2457
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Go overseas into what we've

2458
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Affectionately called on the other show

2459
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Hoard House, Londonland or not

2460
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Londonland

2461
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
With Raven and EJ

2462
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
On Girls Gone Wow

2463
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
And Syl from the Geek Card

2464
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
And Razorbug and Robface and all the

2465
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
People I know over there it's like

2466
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
And Pika Uno could totally take me to Disneyland

2467
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Although I hope they didn't

2468
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Up the prices at Disney Paris

2469
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Like they did here in the US

2470
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Recently because that sucked

2471
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
The prices at Disneyland went up today

2472
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Did you hear about that Dark Sakura?

2473
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
There is no longer a premium pass at Disneyland

2474
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Well Dan and I actually had a

2475
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Conversation about it

2476
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Well prepare to pay a lot more money

2477
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
If you're gonna get the passes

2478
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Well part of the reason though is that the passes are probably cheap

2479
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
When the parks weren't getting a lot of attention

2480
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Now that you know the Disney parks

2481
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Are crazy popular

2482
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
They can

2483
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
I've heard that this is a move to

2484
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Weed out the crowds

2485
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
That's what we were saying

2486
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
You would think wouldn't Disney want the crowds

2487
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
But yes of course they do

2488
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
But to a certain limit

2489
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
And I think Disney has kind of hit that limit

2490
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
When they have to turn people away

2491
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
They've kind of hit the limit

2492
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
I think that could be a big part of it

2493
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
But anyway

2494
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
We're getting a little bit off base

2495
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
We're getting a little bit off base

2496
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
But yeah

2497
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
We will

2498
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
I'm sure have to start a Disney podcast someday

2499
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
When I can afford to go to Disneyland again

2500
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Yet I say I can't afford Disneyland

2501
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
And I'm like ooh I just bought a Red Tron 5

2502
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
But Disneyland gets a lot more expensive than that

2503
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
That won't even buy

2504
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
That won't even buy

2505
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Like a two day park hopper anymore

2506
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
When I spend on that Red Tron 5

2507
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
I didn't see if they still have the SoCal discount

2508
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
I didn't see anything about that

2509
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
So we just need to talk to Marissa

2510
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
I just want to be clear

2511
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
I do love Disneyland

2512
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
I love it and I miss it

2513
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
I haven't been in over a year

2514
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
But it's getting expensive yo

2515
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
To do Disney

2516
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
I really want to go before Big Thunder is gone

2517
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
But still

2518
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
I'm not going to be able to help it when they open Star Wars Land

2519
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I do want to see that

2520
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
I'm not even that big of a Star Wars fan

2521
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
But I just want to see how Disneyland does Star Wars

2522
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
I want them to migrate the bucket of meat

2523
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Hopefully

2524
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
I would think that would be a great fit at California Adventure

2525
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
If they could do the bucket of meat

2526
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
At some Wall-E themed place

2527
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
So if they open Star Wars Land

2528
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Does that mean they're going to move Star Tours

2529
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
I don't know

2530
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
I would think logically

2531
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Yes you move Star Tours over there

2532
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Have a new Star Tour and then you close the old one

2533
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
And use it for something else

2534
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
But a lot of Star Wars is already injected into Tomorrowland

2535
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Because they're Star Tours

2536
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
I believe I heard Space Mountain

2537
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Is going to have a Star Wars type theme

2538
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
No they can't

2539
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
It's a rock and roller coaster

2540
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
If it's a temporary thing

2541
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
It's not permanent

2542
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Remember the rock and roller coaster

2543
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
It's going to be like that

2544
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Dan and I were actually talking about

2545
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Maybe sometime in the next year or so

2546
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Going to Disney World

2547
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
So we can do Mission 1

2548
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Or Mission 2, whatever it's called

2549
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
But then the Captain EO Theater

2550
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
So how's Ingress in Disneyland?

2551
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Insane

2552
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
There's like 500 portals in one park

2553
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
And it's always constantly flipped

2554
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
That's a great place to just AP farm

2555
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
I am loving this you guys

2556
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Loki, within the scope of a week

2557
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Within the scope of a week has gone from

2558
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
I hate Ingress, you're dumb for playing it

2559
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,000
I just didn't get it

2560
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,000
And I still don't really get it

2561
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
But it's kind of something to kill time

2562
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
So how many portals do you think there are at Disneyland?

2563
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
I love it

2564
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
If I'm going to have to

2565
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
I don't normally go on the roller coaster

2566
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
So I have to have something to do while I'm sitting there

2567
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Alright, I'm going to curb all the Disney chat

2568
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Although Bobby Black Wolf is screaming in chat

2569
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
And I say screaming because it's all in caps

2570
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Come to Disney World instead

2571
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
I've been giving that some serious thought

2572
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
And if I could get the time away from work

2573
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
I would love, love, love

2574
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
To go to Dragon Con

2575
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
I'm using my quotey fingers like really early

2576
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
And go to Disney World on like Monday, Tuesday

2577
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
And then go to Dragon Con

2578
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I would love to do that

2579
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
What I would like to do is fly into Orlando

2580
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Or close to it

2581
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Go to Disney World and then rent a car

2582
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
And drive up the Florida coast

2583
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:03,000
And spend like another week in Mobile with my family

2584
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:05,000
And then come home from Mobile

2585
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
That would be perfect

2586
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Bobby Black Wolf is saying two days isn't enough for Disney World though

2587
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Good point, good point

2588
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Alright, anyway

2589
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
We'll get into travel talk later

2590
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
We got to get into some rapid fire news

2591
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
So let's get to it

2592
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Traveling around quickly looking at what happened in the gaming world this week

2593
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
With these quick stories, Loki

2594
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I'm not surprised but Super Mario Maker has already sold a million copies

2595
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,000
I mean it makes sense because it looked awesome

2596
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:37,000
And they said already over 2 million courses have been made

2597
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:40,000
And it's been played 75 million times

2598
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
And I want DLC

2599
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:47,000
I'm wondering if they do like a DLC pack that's like Zelda 2 Adventures of Link

2600
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Because it is kind of side scroller

2601
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,000
It would be kind of nice to have like non-Mario themes

2602
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
I don't know

2603
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Hopefully

2604
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,000
I just have a feeling we've only seen the beginning of what they're going to do with Mario Maker

2605
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Oh I think we have

2606
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
If Splatoon and Mario Kart 8 are any example

2607
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,000
I'm loving this Nintendo that understands DLC

2608
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
I never thought I'd say that but I really am

2609
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Yeah

2610
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
And then along with that

2611
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Speaking of community created things

2612
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Battlefield 4 they have a new outbreak map that's coming out

2613
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,000
That's being designed I guess by the community

2614
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
They've got

2615
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
It looks kind of cool

2616
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,000
It's like a jungle type environment

2617
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,000
And you can drive boats on the river and stuff like that

2618
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
So that's kind of cool

2619
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Maybe a free update that will be coming out soon

2620
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
And then

2621
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Amiibos

2622
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Nintendo is bringing back some of the more rare Amiibos

2623
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Apparently the Captain Falcon, Fox, Greninja, Little Mac

2624
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Lucario and Shulk are going to be coming back

2625
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,000
I may have picked up a Captain Falcon and a Little Mac

2626
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
We found the Fox by the way

2627
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
The Fox McCloud

2628
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Nice yeah

2629
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
They are out there

2630
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
So those will be coming back

2631
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:11,000
Select retailers soon

2632
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
And then along with that there's going to be some new

2633
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Animal Crossing Amiibos

2634
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Including they've got

2635
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Celeste

2636
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Mr. Rosetti, Kix and Blathers

2637
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
And I'm assuming those are going to be for

2638
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer

2639
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
I don't know

2640
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
Rosetti is kind of fun

2641
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Yeah some of those Amiibo I would have to have

2642
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
What about Tom? Do they have Tom Nook?

2643
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
I know they have his kids

2644
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Timmy and Tommy

2645
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
But I don't know if they have

2646
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
They were annoying

2647
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Here's the thing

2648
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
I'm kind of not feeling the

2649
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer

2650
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
All the Amiibo stuff

2651
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
That's cool that Jamie likes it

2652
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
It seems like that would be more something like

2653
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
For like

2654
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
I don't know

2655
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Animal Crossing

2656
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Like

2657
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
Imagine if you will

2658
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Instead of having random animals in your town

2659
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
You buy the Amiibos for the animals

2660
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,000
You want to live in your town

2661
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Alright

2662
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Anyhow we'll

2663
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Keep on moving with some more stories here

2664
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Because we can probably debate these Animal Crossing

2665
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Amiibo for some time

2666
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
I say this now that I'm not going to get any

2667
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
And then watch my shelf will suddenly

2668
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Where did you get the Blathers from?

2669
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
I bought it because I could

2670
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
They're out

2671
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
No I meant for non-Animal Crossing

2672
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
I don't know when that is planned

2673
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
For non-Animal Crossing characters

2674
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
I'd rather pick up a bunch of those

2675
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Than just buying a bunch of the figures

2676
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Alright

2677
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Moving on, speaking of Mario Maker

2678
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Japan getting another piece

2679
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Of DLC announced

2680
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
We have yet to have one announced

2681
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
But another character in Japan

2682
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
It's Game Center CX's Arino

2683
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Who will have the suit and tie

2684
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
So again this is one of those

2685
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Amiibo suits

2686
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
That's used in the 8-bit version of the game

2687
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
You can't really use it in the other levels

2688
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
But that's still kind of cool

2689
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
That's going to be some DLC

2690
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Can't wait to see what's coming out here

2691
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Do you think we'll get that here? Because I don't think we will

2692
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Well I'm kind of wondering if we will get that here

2693
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Or at least some sort of update because

2694
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Aren't we going to be playing those levels

2695
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Since we do play levels from Japanese players

2696
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
I guess that's true

2697
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
So wouldn't we have those suits?

2698
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
That's a good thought I didn't think about

2699
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
That we could essentially play a Japanese level

2700
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
That would have those suits whether they're out here or not

2701
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
That's a very good point

2702
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Unless they're just going to filter those out for us

2703
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Oh yeah like maybe what is

2704
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
The Game Center person for us

2705
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
Or for them will become a different personality for us

2706
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Well no I'm not

2707
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Oh maybe I don't know I just thought maybe

2708
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Everybody with DLC here

2709
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Maybe Jeff Keighley is going to be a suit in Mario Maker

2710
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Reggie Fils-Aime

2711
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I would love that

2712
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
My buddy is ready

2713
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
I'm seriously

2714
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
Why didn't they put him in Smash

2715
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
I mean come on that would have been so perfect

2716
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
I missed out

2717
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
You never know

2718
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
They make the Mii

2719
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
With Reggie a lot in the

2720
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
I don't want the Mii I want actually

2721
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Reggie and the Mii is cool

2722
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
You can make whoever you want but like I want

2723
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Actually to have officially

2724
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Supported Reggie in there

2725
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Mii Fighters aren't good enough

2726
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
No it's not good enough

2727
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Moving on

2728
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
What used to be the Best Buy

2729
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Theater in Times Square

2730
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
Which was also once the Nokia

2731
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Theater it is now a Sony

2732
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Sponsored theater and so now

2733
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,000
It is the PlayStation Theater

2734
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Not to be confused with a place

2735
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
That will actually like have PlayStation

2736
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Experiences and so forth but being in

2737
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Times Square isn't that it's a theater

2738
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
It will be live performances and

2739
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
It will occasionally though have events that

2740
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Will showcase Sony PlayStation

2741
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Type events and you can bet that if

2742
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Sony has big announcements to make they may consider

2743
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Using this in New York City

2744
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
So we'll see

2745
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
You can also see that the official PlayStation

2746
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Twitter account actually tweeted some pictures of the

2747
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Inside of the theater looks very

2748
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Nice in there let's hope this branding sticks

2749
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
They have a guy from

2750
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Doing No Man's Sky you know kind of the spokes works in there

2751
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
On

2752
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Colbert's show and

2753
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
He had a PewDiePie

2754
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
On his show

2755
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
One of the things that he was saying though

2756
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
He's all

2757
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Is this game coming out soon?

2758
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Because it's got to be coming out soon if you're on my

2759
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
Show so I'm wondering like

2760
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
If they're going to be announcing something soon

2761
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Because it is true they've been doing

2762
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,000
The whole

2763
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
They've been doing that ever since

2764
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
E3 and stuff but they've been doing talk show

2765
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Circuit where they're showing off the game

2766
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
It's kind of usually

2767
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Yeah I thought it was supposed to be this holiday

2768
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
That that game was out

2769
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Maybe surprise would be

2770
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
I'd like a surprise please

2771
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Speaking of not to be too tangenty

2772
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
But apparently Colbert

2773
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Had PewDiePie on

2774
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
And very respectful

2775
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Sort of interview but in the Colbert way

2776
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Colbert still took his digs

2777
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
In the way only he can do

2778
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
But a lot of people comparing and contrasting

2779
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
To how Jimmy Kimmel kind of came off

2780
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Like an uninformed ass

2781
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Which is also his shtick

2782
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
I mean being an ass

2783
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Is kind of how he got famous from the man show

2784
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
I mean right because that was his first

2785
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Big show was the one he did with Adam Carolla the man show

2786
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
And they were kind of asses on that show

2787
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
And that was what it was

2788
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
But anyway people really

2789
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Giving kudos to Colbert and I got to say

2790
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I haven't watched a lot of episodes of his show

2791
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
But I've always loved Stephen Colbert

2792
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
And you know my love of Stephen Colbert

2793
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
I watch a lot of the highlights thankfully

2794
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
To the internet because I don't stay up to watch

2795
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Those shows but like I watch a lot of the highlights

2796
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
And yeah I mean he's doing a great job

2797
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
There's yeah and

2798
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
I might be partial because I've loved him ever since

2799
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Strangers with Candy and even a little bit of

2800
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Exit 57 so I think it's cool that

2801
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
They really do need to have Strangers with Candy come back

2802
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
I don't think it can now

2803
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Why?

2804
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
I don't know oh Bobby Blackwolf correcting me

2805
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Kimmel's first big show is

2806
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Win Ben Stein's Money I forgot about that

2807
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
That's right

2808
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Oh yeah

2809
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
That was before the Man Show I think it was

2810
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Was he the first host though?

2811
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
I thought they had a woman on but maybe she was later

2812
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Because he wasn't always

2813
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
The host of Win Ben Stein's Money

2814
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
That came later wasn't it?

2815
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
That show was awesome Yeah that show was a good show

2816
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
I gotta say I need more Ben Stein

2817
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Where is Ben Stein?

2818
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
He started going really political

2819
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
He kind of went down that Margaret Cho route

2820
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Where she got less funny and more political

2821
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
And I think that's kind of what happened with Ben Stein

2822
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
So I don't know

2823
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Bobby Blackwolf says

2824
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
That Ben's doing Clear Eyes ads

2825
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
And Mega Man X400 says

2826
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
The best game show host

2827
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Was the mean British lady

2828
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
On weakest link

2829
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Anne Robinson

2830
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Yes

2831
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Which village is missing their idiot?

2832
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
It's time to find out

2833
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Who is the weakest link?

2834
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Goodbye

2835
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
That show is so fucking rad

2836
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Why is that gone?

2837
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
Have you seen

2838
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Because we have basic cable

2839
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
And occasionally I turn it on TV

2840
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Because I don't actually watch TV I just get it

2841
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Because it's $10 cheaper with cable for some stupid reason

2842
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
So we have basic cable

2843
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
And occasionally I'll turn it on and see what shows

2844
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Are on and there's like this game show

2845
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
With a bomb and so you have to

2846
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Answer these questions and the answer is

2847
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Whatever when you cut and if they get it wrong

2848
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
They get sprayed with some sort of

2849
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
It's yogurt

2850
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
It's dog urine

2851
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
It's like really disgusting

2852
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Stuff

2853
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
It was on Fox and I think it did so horribly

2854
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
They moved it to one of the off brand

2855
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
FX or something

2856
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
It wasn't even that it was on one of the local channels

2857
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Because that's all I get

2858
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Maybe Fox kept it

2859
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
I haven't watched TV in a while

2860
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
What happened to TV?

2861
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Fox cancels Firefly

2862
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
But keeps the bomb blowing up

2863
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Rabbit poop in people's faces

2864
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Firefly is too intelligent

2865
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
For the audience that is Fox

2866
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
So that's why

2867
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
They have to

2868
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Put that crap on there

2869
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Hey rapid fire news

2870
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Where we talk about this news rapidly

2871
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
And don't go on tansions

2872
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Hey Google and Microsoft

2873
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
I'm sorry Rob have you met us?

2874
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
No

2875
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Who are you people and what are you doing in my house?

2876
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Google and Microsoft

2877
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Hey they used to be going

2878
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Head to head to each other over different patents

2879
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Because you know everybody loves to fight about patents

2880
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
But Google and Microsoft

2881
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Agreeing to a truce

2882
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
There were 20 lawsuits

2883
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Between the two companies

2884
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
They have all been

2885
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Settled essentially

2886
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Ending the five year dispute

2887
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
This has to do with phones

2888
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Xbox video playback

2889
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Now they're going to actually come together

2890
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
And on certain patent matters

2891
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
They will actually brand together

2892
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Building a royalty free video format

2893
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
That prevents these legal skirmishes

2894
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
In the future

2895
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
So that's always nice to see people resolve their differences

2896
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
And all this patent

2897
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Crap get weeded out

2898
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
That's nice

2899
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
How about you Dark Soccer what do you have?

2900
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Eh nothing I give up

2901
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
No I'm kidding

2902
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Stop

2903
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
So Nvidia has decided to rebrand

2904
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Grid

2905
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
All in capitals as Geforce now

2906
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
So basically it's their version of cloud gaming

2907
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
To give you 1080p

2908
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
60 frames per second

2909
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
60 frames per second gaming

2910
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Over the internet blah blah blah

2911
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
So yeah rebranding that's all

2912
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
If you see a change that's why

2913
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Also the game

2914
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
That pretty much started it all when it comes to fighting games

2915
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Is

2916
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Now on Playstation Network

2917
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
It's karate champ

2918
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
So I mean how's that

2919
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
For a slice of 1984 right?

2920
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
That takes me back to Straw Hat Pizza

2921
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Straw Hat Pizza

2922
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Which is still around I guess

2923
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Which I've never been to

2924
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Really? Yeah

2925
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
It's not bad but they used to be everywhere and then they just kind of fizzled

2926
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Do you think there's good pizza in Alabama?

2927
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
No

2928
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
I bet you'd be surprised

2929
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Didn't you say there was like a sushi place you loved in Alabama?

2930
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
I thought there was

2931
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Yeah but they opened it like well after I moved

2932
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Did you know there's a place

2933
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Sorry to do tangents but that's what we do here at OLR

2934
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Since I've been informed

2935
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Did you know that there's a sushi place

2936
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Near here called Nemo Sushi

2937
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
And the little logo

2938
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Is actually an orange fish

2939
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
That has white stripes on it

2940
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
And I'm like

2941
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
I could go there and eat little Nemo

2942
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Why would you call your restaurant

2943
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Why would you call your restaurant

2944
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Nemo Sushi

2945
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
You're gonna eat Nemo

2946
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
See I would've if I was gonna do one called Nemo Sushi

2947
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
It would be a little boy in pajamas

2948
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
And you could sit on beds and eat sushi

2949
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Fair enough, alright sorry

2950
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
I still want to go to that Ninja Sushi

2951
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
I apologize for the tangent

2952
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
But it was important

2953
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
This tangent was brought to you by fish

2954
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
I'll never forget we went to a place called Taka's Sushi

2955
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Just because we were like

2956
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Because of the name BeatMania2DX LOL

2957
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
I don't even know if that place is still there

2958
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
They have the sakura roll which I had to eat

2959
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
You had a sakura roll at Taka's Sushi

2960
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
A sakura roll

2961
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
So anyway

2962
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
There's been leaks

2963
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Of new Street Fighter 5 characters

2964
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
There's one called Lara

2965
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
And I'm trying to

2966
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
It was actually shared by

2967
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Famitsu

2968
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
But I'm trying to see exactly what her style is

2969
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
It looks like she's a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu

2970
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
And then

2971
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
There was also announced

2972
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Nekali and Rashid

2973
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
And then they also confirmed

2974
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Zangief

2975
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Yay, Street Fighter 5

2976
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Excellent

2977
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Done

2978
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Alright well then let's go to our

2979
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
FOOGLE question of the week

2980
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Each week we take Facebook

2981
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
And Google Plus and we slam those

2982
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Words together and you get FOOGLE

2983
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Of course you can follow us

2984
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
At Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio

2985
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Or Google.com slash

2986
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Plus OrangeLoungeRadio

2987
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
And tonight we thought we would ask

2988
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
About multiplayer games

2989
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Since you know Jackbox Games

2990
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Was on the show tonight

2991
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
And they specialize really in multiplayer party games

2992
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
We thought we'd ask about your favorite

2993
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Multiplayer game to have people

2994
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
All in one place to play

2995
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
And we were really looking for

2996
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
In one room type of stories

2997
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
Because yeah you can play everything online today

2998
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Including you know the Jackbox games

2999
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
But I think it's

3000
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Kind of fun to talk about having people

3001
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Over and getting the party on that way

3002
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
So let's go to Facebook

3003
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Where Master Claw starts us off tonight

3004
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Saying Super Smash Brothers Melee

3005
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Mario Kart 64 and GoldenEye 007

3006
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Saw the most couch multiplayer

3007
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
In my house

3008
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
I haven't had many friends IRL since then

3009
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Aww that's sad though

3010
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
You always answer our questions

3011
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
If you listen to this show you must be a good guy

3012
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
You should have lots of friends IRL

3013
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Maybe you just don't have friends that play video games

3014
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
But you'd be surprised

3015
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
I'm sometimes talking to play Mario Kart with you

3016
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Bryce H. replies

3017
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
And says Mario Kart 8

3018
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
And Just Dance

3019
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
See I don't, so people

3020
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Really do the Just Dance with lots of people around

3021
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
I would think I'd be a little scared to do that

3022
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Oh come on you did the Abba Dance

3023
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
With me and Tiara

3024
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
That was a private moment

3025
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Tiara was here wasn't she?

3026
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
That was a private moment

3027
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
I was a private dancer

3028
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
You weren't dancing for money

3029
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I didn't know that was anything except a laugh

3030
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Didn't I get sushi? I don't know

3031
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
I don't know

3032
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Degenerate Johnny says

3033
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Although I would have loved to say We Dare for the Wii

3034
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
I couldn't find good swinger couples

3035
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
To play with me, Sy

3036
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
So I guess I'll have to stick with Super Smash Brothers

3037
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Oh Degenerate Johnny

3038
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Ragenator says

3039
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
When I was in college

3040
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
My college campus had a 4 slot Neo Geo MVS

3041
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
A few of us really got into playing the crap

3042
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Out of Samurai Shodown 4

3043
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Amakusa's Revenge

3044
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Granted only 2 people could play at a time

3045
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
In terms of non-video gaming

3046
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
I used to love Magic the Gathering the actual card game

3047
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Sadly I can't afford to constantly get new cards

3048
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Nowadays plus card shops are a pain to get to

3049
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
For my neighborhood anyway

3050
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
So I have to settle for the Steam incarnations of Magic

3051
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
You know I was wondering if somebody would reply with an arcade game

3052
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Because you know

3053
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Arcade games were definitely a multiplayer experience

3054
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
All in the same place many years ago

3055
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Hence how Dark Sakura, Loki, and myself met

3056
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Actually was playing DDR

3057
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
I wonder if anybody said DDR

3058
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
So I guess maybe dance games would be included

3059
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Didn't I just say just dance?

3060
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
That must be a thing with age

3061
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
In my 20s I must not have been as inhibited as I am now

3062
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Alright Silent Tom

3063
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Says my favorite multiplayer game

3064
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
Is the best of the Rock Band games

3065
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
I get

3066
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Excuse me Rock Band games

3067
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
A game my wife, her and her best friend and her hubby have

3068
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Get together and have some drinks

3069
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
And have a great time

3070
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
And ER also saying Rock Band

3071
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Back in college we played that game a ton

3072
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
We also played a lot of fighting games

3073
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Which just aren't the same online

3074
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
SSG100Matt says my friends and I

3075
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
During my middle and high school years

3076
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Would always play the Mario Party games together

3077
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Primarily Mario Party 2

3078
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
We played the hell out of that game

3079
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
And would always get into playful arguments

3080
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
About setting off Bowser parades

3081
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Star stealing and coin stealing

3082
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
We also had developed calluses on the palms of our hands

3083
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
And had several broken N60 games

3084
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
To be fair those things are really easy to break

3085
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Hitstun says nothing beats a big game of Bomberman

3086
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
It's easy to pick up and play

3087
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
So it's great for parties

3088
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
It's about time we get a Bomberman game on current consoles

3089
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Who owns that IP now?

3090
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Oh yeah

3091
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
It's Konami

3092
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Nevermind

3093
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
What you weren't a fan of Bomberman Zero

3094
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Or whatever that was on the

3095
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Oh god

3096
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Anyway

3097
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Dark Tetsuya says

3098
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
I'm gonna say Para Para Paradise

3099
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
Because even though it wasn't technically multiplayer

3100
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
If you get a bunch of nerds in a room

3101
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
That know the routine to a given song

3102
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
They're all probably gonna do it

3103
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
In blatant disregard to the sign

3104
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Forbidding such activity

3105
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Okay you're right I was totally wrong on what I said about dancing

3106
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Yeah it's hilarious when they

3107
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Forbid that type of thing it's like what is this

3108
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Footloose or something?

3109
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Dancing is foreboden

3110
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Here at Golfland

3111
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
Lastly on Facebook

3112
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
MegamanX400

3113
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Our pal from Video Game Realness

3114
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Podcast says

3115
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Hands down the game my friends and I have played the most

3116
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Even since high school has been Smash Brothers

3117
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
Each iteration has provided

3118
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Hours of replayable fun

3119
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
As everyone's skill levels improved

3120
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
We all shifted over time and performance

3121
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
So it kept things interesting and competitive

3122
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
For us

3123
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Those are the answers from Facebook

3124
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
But let us not forget Google Plus

3125
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Where we have ActDeft saying Super Smash Brothers

3126
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
They never failed to deliver

3127
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
On the local multiplayer department

3128
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Retertainment says

3129
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Seen it since all you really needed to play it

3130
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Was a DVD player

3131
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Oh god they really drilled that series

3132
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Into the ground though with all the scenes

3133
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Have you seen the Twilight seen it?

3134
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
That's nothing but trivia questions

3135
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
On the Twilight games oh lord

3136
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Sent it on fire

3137
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
And lastly

3138
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
MartinD replies and says

3139
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Maybe a weird answer here but probably

3140
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
Tekken 3 is still the game I played

3141
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
The most with my friends back in the day

3142
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
A lot of fun

3143
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Also any FIFA game is a lot of fun to play

3144
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Against friends not really into the party games

3145
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
I don't think Tekken 3 is a weird answer

3146
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Irene and I used to play the shit out of that game

3147
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
And it was all about Panda

3148
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
I worked in an Amco arcade when that was out

3149
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
I still am proud of the day

3150
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
That I went in and the guys had been there

3151
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Like almost all day practicing King

3152
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
And I decided to just take

3153
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
You know go back and forth with Jen and Julia

3154
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
On the left

3155
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
AkumaJP giving an old school answer

3156
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
In our chat room saying

3157
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
If it doesn't have to be multiplayer my friend and I

3158
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Played the shit out of Shinobi on the Genesis

3159
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
4 person turn by turn

3160
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Yeah I mean

3161
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Sometimes a multiplayer gaming experience

3162
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Was passing that controller around

3163
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
And everybody kind of doing the part of the game

3164
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
That they're best at or you suck

3165
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
And can't get past this part let me take care of it

3166
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Bomberman 2 with the multitap

3167
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
On the SNES

3168
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
That was pretty awesome

3169
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Yeah they really haven't had a new one in a while

3170
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
The last one I can think of was that

3171
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
They had one on the Xbox 360

3172
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
And I think it was on PlayStation 3 as well

3173
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
But not zero

3174
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Not zero there was like on the network

3175
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Nintendo network

3176
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
The online download

3177
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Yeah there was Bomberman live

3178
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Alright

3179
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Anyhow that does it for the Fugu question of the week

3180
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
But we've got some more news and your phone calls

3181
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Here in a little while

3182
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
In the meantime Loki

3183
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Yeah so it kind of makes me wonder you know with

3184
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
You know the decision for

3185
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Konami going into this whole

3186
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
More so into the Pachinko

3187
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
And you know on mobile games

3188
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Division maybe it's not the greatest thing

3189
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Sega, Sammy for example

3190
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
They're cutting 200 jobs

3191
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
In its Pachinko division

3192
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Based on poor sales

3193
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
So

3194
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
They're putting, soliciting voluntary retirement

3195
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
For 200 jobs

3196
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
And I guess they're saying that there was

3197
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
An extraordinary loss

3198
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
And that basically

3199
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
The poor sales of

3200
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Pachinko machines like

3201
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Pachinko slot

3202
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Hokuto no Ken Tomo

3203
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Or Fist of the North Star

3204
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
And Bayonetta's Pachinko slot

3205
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
Not even hitting half the sales

3206
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
They were expected to

3207
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
I hope Bayonetta isn't

3208
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Like gone forever

3209
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
I have this really bad feeling it is

3210
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
I'm going to try not to think negative thoughts

3211
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
And just hope that she shows up in Smash Brothers

3212
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
And gets an amiibo

3213
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
But I just feel like it's not going to happen

3214
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
So I guess there isn't

3215
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Tons and tons of money

3216
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Could it be over saturation of the market?

3217
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
I mean because I can't imagine

3218
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
Well I don't know

3219
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
There's probably a ton of Pachinko slot

3220
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
Parlors or arcades or whatever

3221
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
In Japan so

3222
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
Do they maybe have too many?

3223
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
I mean I don't know

3224
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Why it wouldn't perform as well

3225
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Alan Alchemy in chat over at

3226
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Live.FogNetwork.com says

3227
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
They need to port Bayonetta to PC

3228
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
God damn it

3229
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Maybe the first one

3230
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
But the second one they can't

3231
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
That game would not have happened if not for Nintendo

3232
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
And I don't see Nintendo

3233
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
I mean unless there's something in the contract

3234
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Where like after five years they can do it

3235
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
Like maybe what happened was Zombie U

3236
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
And I still believe we can

3237
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Yeah so anyway

3238
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Moving on

3239
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
Let's get to another story here

3240
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Although a masked bishop joined our chat room

3241
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
Apparently just to say Bomberman 64 was amazing

3242
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Oh yeah the old school Bomberman's were all awesome

3243
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
But then Bomberman 0 happened

3244
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
And we all wondered what the hell happened

3245
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
Alright anyhow

3246
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
Let's move on to some updates on the

3247
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Xbox One console

3248
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
You know PlayStation 4 got its big update

3249
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
And I know Xbox One's right around the corner

3250
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
It's supposed to be the big backwards compatibility one right

3251
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
But also some other features that are

3252
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
Supposed to be in the Xbox One update

3253
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Cortana was originally

3254
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Going to I believe be a part of this

3255
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
However will not

3256
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Be making a debut until

3257
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Early next year

3258
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
According to Major Nelson

3259
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Unfortunately that is not going to be a part of this

3260
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
Roll out however

3261
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Folks in the dashboard preview program later

3262
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
This fall will be able to actually use

3263
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Cortana but I gotta be honest

3264
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
I don't ever use this voice search

3265
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Stuff it doesn't seem to work

3266
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
And I can't get the microphone to work on my laptop

3267
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
So it's just like normally I do that

3268
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
If I don't want to find Photoshop

3269
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
Digging through the menus I just type Photoshop

3270
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Really I've never had any problem

3271
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
With Siri

3272
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
I wasn't going to use it anyway

3273
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Siri's a little different because you know that's in the palm of your hand

3274
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
And that is I will say that's convenient

3275
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
For Siri's going to be on the Apple TV

3276
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Remind me in 20 minutes I don't think

3277
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
I would ever use it on Apple TV to be honest

3278
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
But I do use Siri for

3279
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Remind me in 20 minutes to check the oven

3280
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
I use Siri to text you from my watch

3281
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Do you really? Yeah I do

3282
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
When I'm on my way to the show I'll just tell Rob

3283
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
This and then I even have my punctuation

3284
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
But see those are all portable

3285
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Things and just on something

3286
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
That's on your like set top

3287
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Box I don't see a lot of use for it

3288
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
I will say the thing that Apple

3289
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
Is doing and maybe Microsoft's doing this

3290
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
With Xbox One I don't realize it

3291
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Is that the Apple thing will

3292
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Tell you this movie's on Hulu

3293
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
Or this movie's on Netflix and so on

3294
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
That's useful because there's so many freaking services

3295
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Now I don't know what movie is where

3296
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
Like where do I get to watch old

3297
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Episodes of Strangers with Candy with Stephen Colbert

3298
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Because it's not on Netflix but it is on Hulu

3299
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
That type of search is really useful

3300
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
That's actually going to be on Apple TV

3301
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Right that's what I'm saying that's one thing that I think will be

3302
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Good on Apple TV but I don't

3303
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
Think it's planned for Microsoft's

3304
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Thing if it is then I guess that's something

3305
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
I might use I like I just turned on

3306
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
The microphone just for the fuck of it to see if

3307
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
You know what would happen with

3308
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
Cortana and he said there is

3309
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
An eclipse try to open something

3310
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
I'm like I don't know what you

3311
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Cortana just told you there's an eclipse

3312
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Yeah so there's an eclipse period and it's like

3313
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Trying to open something I'm like okay

3314
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Thank you for that information tell her to divide by

3315
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Zero and see if she makes funny like Siri does

3316
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Alright anyhow also

3317
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
Some things that have been added to

3318
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
The Xbox beta app in

3319
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Windows 10

3320
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
So this is kind of related

3321
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Party text chat available for the

3322
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Xbox beta app members

3323
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Reading and replying to messages directly from

3324
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Notifications

3325
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Alert activity alert notifications

3326
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Like if somebody else is on Xbox

3327
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Add you as a friend or whatever

3328
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
And then activity feed sharing you can share within

3329
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
The activity feed so

3330
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Cool

3331
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Some additions there to Xbox

3332
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
And I'm sure the

3333
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Big software update for everybody

3334
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
I think that was supposed to go live in October right?

3335
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
With the big backwards compatibility and all that

3336
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
I think that was coming up very soon

3337
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
Alright meanwhile Dark Soccer what do you have for us?

3338
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Actually I was talking to

3339
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Ikuma JP real quick

3340
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
And I had like a total brain translation error

3341
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
But

3342
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
But

3343
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Siri would be Shiri

3344
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
In Japan which means butt

3345
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
So I wonder if you'd be like

3346
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Hey butt

3347
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Hey butt you're a butt

3348
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
I'm just

3349
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Trying to help

3350
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
You can friend my butt

3351
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Anyway

3352
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
So Twisted Pixel

3353
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
We know them right?

3354
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Splosion Man

3355
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Well you know that they

3356
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Were acquired by Microsoft in

3357
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
2011 well they're going solo

3358
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
They have

3359
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Had an amicable split

3360
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
And they are going

3361
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
On to expand their relationships

3362
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
They're going to see other companies

3363
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
They're going to

3364
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Be a poly

3365
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Poly gaming

3366
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
They want to live the life of a single company for a while

3367
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
They're gonna be swinging

3368
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Do those things they didn't get to experience five years ago

3369
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Exactly so they've had an

3370
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Enrollment

3371
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Of sorts I guess

3372
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
They still had to work with the prenup

3373
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
But you know

3374
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
That means Splosion Man on Playstation 4 soon enough right?

3375
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Maybe

3376
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Could be

3377
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
But

3378
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
The Microsoft General Manager

3379
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
John Needham said

3380
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
I can't wait to see what this talented team creates next

3381
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
And that's it

3382
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
We'll see

3383
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Alright

3384
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Logie

3385
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Alright so in October

3386
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
We're going to be getting some

3387
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
New Playstation Plus games

3388
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Including Broken Age

3389
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Super Meat Boy

3390
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
On Playstation 4

3391
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
Playstation 3 Beginning Chariot

3392
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
Kickbeat, Kung Fu Rabbit

3393
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
And also Unmechanical Extended

3394
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
And Vita, Broken Age

3395
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Kickbeat, Kung Fu Rabbit

3396
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
And Super Meat Boy

3397
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Also in October

3398
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
The Drive Club

3399
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
Demo or whatever that was

3400
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Will be leaving as well

3401
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
So be sure to download it

3402
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Before October 6

3403
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
And then

3404
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
Along with that

3405
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Wait why are they getting rid of it?

3406
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
That seems so weird

3407
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
There was this big hype up about the

3408
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Release of Drive Club on Playstation Plus

3409
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
It was something they had launched

3410
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Took forever to get

3411
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
And now they're going to pull it?

3412
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Was it that bad?

3413
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
I thought

3414
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Some people really enjoyed it

3415
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
But I found it hard to play that

3416
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
After playing Forza Horizon 2

3417
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
No thank you

3418
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
And then along with that

3419
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Of course Super Meat Boy is going to have

3420
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Different music though on Playstation 4

3421
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
And the Vita release

3422
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
That's just because

3423
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
The original

3424
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Audio designer has decided

3425
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Not to license the music for the new versions

3426
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Of the game so they're going to be getting other

3427
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Music

3428
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
For the game

3429
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
There sounds like some very interesting

3430
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Drama there because you know they're not

3431
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
In specifics but it's very much

3432
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Like a I'm not going to work with them

3433
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Again type of thing

3434
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Very interesting drama there

3435
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
They're basically replacing the soundtrack

3436
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
They have different musicians

3437
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
Including

3438
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Some of the artists that worked on

3439
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
The Binding of Isaac, Rebirth

3440
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Hotline Miami and Plants vs. Zombies

3441
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Hotline Miami

3442
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Had a sick soundtrack though

3443
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
It would be kind of cool to hear how it

3444
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
It's going to be weird

3445
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
I kind of thought some of the best

3446
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Stuff in Super Meat Boy was the music

3447
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
The music was so good and fit the game

3448
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Not to say that the new soundtrack

3449
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
Will be bad it's just

3450
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
It's going to have big shoes to fill

3451
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
It's going to almost feel like a different game

3452
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
It's going to be a very interesting kind of

3453
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
I don't know

3454
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Experiment

3455
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
I guess for lack of a better word

3456
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
In how important is the soundtrack

3457
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
To a game

3458
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
We'll see

3459
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
The games will be up for download

3460
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
On October 6th

3461
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
I could also see

3462
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
That maybe the whole social aspect

3463
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
And the fact that the game will be shared everywhere

3464
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Maybe the guy

3465
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
I don't know maybe it's just more of a personal thing

3466
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Between him and the other makers

3467
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
I don't necessarily want to make stuff up

3468
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
The fact that that music is going to be streamed everywhere

3469
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
It has been streamed everywhere for a long time

3470
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
I guess that's true

3471
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
There's a lot of YouTube videos with all that

3472
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Alright

3473
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Well moving on it's a little bit of a slower news week

3474
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
So we're having to dig deep a little bit here

3475
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
So we're talking about website launches tonight

3476
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
But I think this is interesting

3477
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
It's about a topic I think a lot of people

3478
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
Have an opinion about certainly

3479
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
And that is game reviews

3480
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
And you guys know Metacritic

3481
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
And Metacritic is often controversial

3482
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Well there's a new site

3483
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
That's been launched this week

3484
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
That's picking up some exposure on some gaming blogs

3485
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
Called Open Critic

3486
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
And Open Critic is

3487
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
Trying to focus on video games

3488
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
But they're doing some different things with it

3489
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Such as they'll be just a simple score average

3490
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Not weighted differently from different websites

3491
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
And apparently you can actually

3492
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Go in there as a user and whitelist

3493
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Different outlets

3494
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
To only see reviews from

3495
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
So that way if you think a particular

3496
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Website is shit

3497
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
And you don't like their reviews

3498
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
You can just basically

3499
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Blacklist them and they don't actually show up in the scores

3500
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
That you see

3501
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
And that's a very interesting concept

3502
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
Because even with movies it's like

3503
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,000
Well maybe you agree with Cisco but you don't agree with Ebert

3504
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Type of thing you know

3505
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Or whoever the, who do they have these days

3506
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
There's nobody that compares to Cisco and Ebert now

3507
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Is it Roper and some other dude

3508
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,000
But anyway you know there tends to be

3509
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Probably certain outlets that you agree with more than others

3510
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,000
You know like vognetwork.com

3511
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Wink wink

3512
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,000
Anyhow

3513
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,000
It's going to be interesting to see how that goes

3514
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Also apparently one other big twist

3515
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Is going to be displaying non-numerical scores

3516
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Because

3517
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
You know some websites have said

3518
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
We're no longer giving games a score

3519
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
And so open critic is still somehow

3520
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Going to rate that

3521
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
I don't know if that's using words

3522
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Or how they're going to do that or if they're just

3523
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Assigning a score based on how the review reads

3524
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
That could be very interesting and controversial

3525
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
But anyway I thought that was just

3526
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Worth bringing up

3527
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Not that I usually will give these websites

3528
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Free plugs but

3529
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
I do often times have conversations about

3530
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
You know the importance of video game reviews

3531
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Is Metacritic helping or harming

3532
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
The developing of games because we've heard about

3533
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
The whole bonuses tied to Metacritic scores and all that

3534
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
So it's interesting that somebody wants to

3535
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Come in and shake that up a little bit

3536
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
So

3537
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Very interesting

3538
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
Alright

3539
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Let's move on with the mailbag

3540
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Tonight Dark Soccer

3541
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
Going to dive into the mailbag

3542
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Head first and pull out some emails

3543
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
That she believes are worthy of reading

3544
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
On the show, there's actually quite a bit

3545
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
So I should shut up and let her get to it but I will say

3546
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
If you want to email us for a future week

3547
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com

3548
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
You know I was just told today

3549
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
That on the Facebook

3550
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
The email address has been wrong for like

3551
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
How long ago did we switch the email address?

3552
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
I don't know

3553
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
I totally forgot to change Facebook, it has now changed

3554
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com

3555
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
If you see the wrong email floating around out there

3556
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Please let me know, I'll fix it

3557
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Whatever the

3558
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
I've got an email

3559
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
That I think is in

3560
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
Braille?

3561
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Oh yes, I saw

3562
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
That one, there's like a bunch of coded

3563
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Text or whatever

3564
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
We don't, do we

3565
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Do we have a cipher or something

3566
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
To crack the code?

3567
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
Nope, moving on

3568
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
I guess unintelligible

3569
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
Garball is what we got for an email this week

3570
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
I'll

3571
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
See if I can look at it later this week and translate it

3572
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
But it better be good, I swear to god

3573
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
If I translate it, it's like

3574
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Oh my god, Becky, stop sending me pictures of cookies

3575
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Is she listening?

3576
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
No, I just messaged

3577
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
I just put on Facebook, Becky cookies

3578
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
And she's like, well I'm actually making some right now

3579
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
And I'm like, I'm coming over after the show

3580
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
If I translate that message and it's butt butt fart

3581
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
I'm going to be very upset, I'm just saying

3582
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
I will be

3583
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
But if it's butt fart fart

3584
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Then we're fine

3585
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
I just wanted to say hey butts

3586
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Hello LR

3587
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
It's your friendly neighborhood alleged

3588
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Word murderer with an opinion and a serious

3589
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Question, god this is a long email

3590
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
Stop it, YYR

3591
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
I personally believe that the Vita's commercial

3592
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Failure in the US is almost entirely due to

3593
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
The rise of smartphone gaming and

3594
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
The resulting change in market

3595
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Conditions, heck the 3DS

3596
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
Was almost a failure for the same reason

3597
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
Have we forgotten that it sold

3598
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Miserably during its first year or so

3599
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
It wasn't until Nintendo dropped the price

3600
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
And a steady stream of high quality games

3601
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
Released that it began to sell well

3602
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
Without both of those things it would have flopped

3603
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Just as hard, the casual games that kept

3604
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
The Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS popular

3605
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
Even when Nintendo wasn't

3606
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
Releasing the gold

3607
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Gold the movie adaptations

3608
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
The games featuring

3609
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Popular toys or kids characters

3610
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
And so on

3611
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
Have almost all moved to phones and tablets

3612
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
Today's market has

3613
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Changed without both a low price tag

3614
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
And a continuous stream of quality games

3615
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
The market is done with you and therefore

3616
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
It was done with the Vita very quickly

3617
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Speaking of continuous what's left in the

3618
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
Pipeline for the 3DS

3619
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Most of my friends already seem to have abandoned theirs

3620
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
If and when Nintendo releases a new portable

3621
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
The market for them will be even tougher

3622
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Than it was this time

3623
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
I wish them good luck, I really do and for the record

3624
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
I love my Vita

3625
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
Which, by the way

3626
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
I picked up

3627
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
My Vita again for like the first time

3628
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
In ages when Happy Home Designer came out

3629
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Not my Vita, my DS

3630
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
I haven't played my American one

3631
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
Since Pixel Poops

3632
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
You should lend it to us

3633
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
I also got that Japanese one and then

3634
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
Akuma sent me that game from Japan

3635
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
And I have some other stuff to play on that

3636
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
But I haven't played the American one since Pixel Poops

3637
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
You should lend it to us

3638
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
I might be talked into that

3639
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
I'll lend you a Neo Geo Pocket Color

3640
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Alright, now I'd like to pose a question

3641
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
To the panel, the chatters and really

3642
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
Everyone listening

3643
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
I thought of this when talking with Amy

3644
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
This week about pop music

3645
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
According to statistics

3646
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
Everybody eventually ages out of pop music

3647
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
They're no longer interested in new stuff

3648
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
They're perfectly content to go back

3649
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
And listen to the years with the music they

3650
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Already enjoyed for the rest of their lives

3651
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
And never look forward again

3652
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
On average this happens in their early to mid 30's

3653
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
Though for women it happens a bit later

3654
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Than it does for men

3655
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
Do you think this will also happen with all of us

3656
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
In video games?

3657
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
I asked this question because I'm starting to think

3658
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
That this process has already begun for me

3659
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
I managed to get a PS4 about a month ago

3660
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
With The Last of Us for $275

3661
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Figured I'd need it eventually for Shenmue 3

3662
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
So why not?

3663
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
I hooked it up and downloaded the cross buy games

3664
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
I already owned

3665
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Since that weekend it has never been turned on

3666
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Not even once

3667
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
While this is likely partially due to

3668
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
My current most played console

3669
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
It feels odd to me

3670
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
I haven't yet purchased Super Mario Maker

3671
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
In fact I feel absolutely zero need to buy it

3672
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Any time soon even though 12 year old me

3673
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Would have put in 100 hours already

3674
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:23,000
My Xbox 360, Xbox One, 3DS and Wii U

3675
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Backlogs have gotten so long that I feel like

3676
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
I just don't need it

3677
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
So what am I playing right now?

3678
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
Sonic Adventure 2 on 360

3679
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
I'm having more fun with it than I've had

3680
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
With anything else I've played this year so far

3681
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
Despite the fact that I 100% destroyed it

3682
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
When it came out almost 15 years ago

3683
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
Now I have access to over 35 years

3684
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
Of video games on demand

3685
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
At my fingertips

3686
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
And sometimes I feel like I'd be perfectly content

3687
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Just playing what's come out already

3688
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
Never looking forward again

3689
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
What are your thoughts on this?

3690
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
And do you think you'll personally reach this point?

3691
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
I'd also love to know what the listeners think

3692
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
And if this doesn't become a future foogle question

3693
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
I hope they'll respond via email or in some other way

3694
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
Looking to spare Rob

3695
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
From the year old jokes

3696
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
YYR

3697
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
You know what? I actually think this is a great question

3698
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
But I'm gonna say that

3699
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
And I would pose this to our chatters

3700
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
If we do have any quick responses

3701
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
I'll read those out on air

3702
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
But are video games gonna go the way

3703
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
Where as you get older you're not gonna be able to appreciate

3704
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
The new stuff like you appreciate the old stuff

3705
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
But see I would actually say that I'm not sure

3706
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
What you said at the very beginning

3707
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Is even accurate

3708
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
That we don't understand pop music today

3709
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
I mean for me personally

3710
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
And everybody's different

3711
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
And that's the first thing to remember

3712
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
But for me personally

3713
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
There is some newer music that I actually really enjoy

3714
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Some of it I don't understand

3715
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
At all

3716
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
Like One Direction

3717
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
That's not music

3718
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
But you know

3719
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Younger girls would disagree with you

3720
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
There's a difference between

3721
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Cookie cutter pop

3722
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
And actual pop music

3723
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
I do but I also think a lot of it's relative

3724
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
Music is music

3725
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
But like the new Church's album

3726
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Is what I've been listening to

3727
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Like non-stop

3728
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
It's so fucking good that just came out like last week

3729
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Or me and Mystery Skulls

3730
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
But is Church's really pop music?

3731
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
I don't know

3732
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
The new Carly Rae Jepsen album

3733
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
And I feel so embarrassed saying that

3734
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Because I know how tacky

3735
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
That Call Me Maybe got

3736
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
But her new album with new stuff is actually really cool

3737
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
I really like it

3738
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
But I am also

3739
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
So looking forward to

3740
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
The 20 year anniversary

3741
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
And if you know me you know why

3742
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Of Jagged Little Pill

3743
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
With demos from the 90's that have been unreleased until now

3744
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
Like I cannot wait for that

3745
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
And I listen to ABBA all the time

3746
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
So I kind of get both sides of it

3747
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
So for video games it's actually

3748
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
Kind of similar

3749
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
Like there's some new stuff

3750
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
I don't really understand and I'm not sure

3751
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
I'm ever going to and for me that would be stuff like

3752
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
A lot of sports games

3753
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Madden, that's just a train

3754
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
I'm never going to be able to get on

3755
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Call of Duty for me

3756
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
But I understand for Loki

3757
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
He's got to play them all and that's cool

3758
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
And I only play them for a little bit now

3759
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
I really need to go back to Advanced Warfare

3760
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Why did I buy the season pass if I'm not going to play online?

3761
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
But

3762
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
There's some games

3763
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
That take me a while to understand

3764
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
And appreciate later

3765
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
I think Minecraft is the quintessential example

3766
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
I didn't get Minecraft at first

3767
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
What so ever

3768
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
And it wasn't until the 360 version

3769
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Came out that framed the game a little differently

3770
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Where I was totally on board

3771
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
And I was like okay I understand Minecraft

3772
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
This game is an awful lot of fun

3773
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
But Minecraft was always bigger with I think a younger

3774
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
Generation before I got it

3775
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
And this isn't even unique to video games

3776
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Because Snapchat

3777
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Do you know how popular Snapchat is?

3778
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
And I didn't understand it

3779
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
At all

3780
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Until Alan finally sat me down and was like

3781
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
This is why people use it

3782
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
And you can create stories

3783
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
And it's just a fun way for you to look

3784
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
And you can send people messages and all this stuff

3785
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
I just thought it was a way to send people dick pics

3786
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
I thought it was just for dick pics and nothing else

3787
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
But no apparently there's this whole other

3788
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Like it's huge

3789
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
People use Snapchat to communicate like a lot

3790
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
But

3791
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
But anyway

3792
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
I kind of think that analogy

3793
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Kind of works

3794
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
For a lot of different things

3795
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
But I also don't necessarily

3796
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Think it's accurate to say that for

3797
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
All people you're not going to be

3798
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Into necessarily newer pop music

3799
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
And newer things

3800
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
It can also be that like a lot of pop music nowadays is cookie cutter

3801
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
I mean granted a lot of pop music back in

3802
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
The 80's was cookie cutter too but for some reason

3803
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
It's just I don't know

3804
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
Because it's age!

3805
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Well now also you have like at least back then

3806
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
It was more like

3807
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
You actually had to sing it nowadays

3808
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
So you can sample and just

3809
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Throw your voice through a computer

3810
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
And

3811
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
I know I might be weird

3812
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
And you guys are going to disagree with me

3813
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
I see that in some ways as another instrument

3814
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Like you know

3815
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
We kind of laugh at some of the people

3816
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
Who overuse it

3817
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
But like with like Cher's Believe

3818
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
That is a great pop song

3819
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
And it just would not be the same without the

3820
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Do you believe in like

3821
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
The way it sounds like a computer

3822
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
The major autotune

3823
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
The obvious autotune

3824
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
Ok but here's the thing

3825
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
You can make fun of that but then on the other hand

3826
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
Ok I'm going to watch this

3827
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
You can go to Kate Bush

3828
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
And what she did

3829
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
She did like this whole like reimagining

3830
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Of some of her pop songs and in some of it

3831
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
She uses that whole like

3832
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Autotune stuff as art

3833
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
I need to get that

3834
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
And you can't fucking tell me that Kate Bush

3835
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
It's not

3836
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Kate Bush is like progressive rock

3837
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Imogen Heap with

3838
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Hide and Seek

3839
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
Everybody knows that song from the Dear Sisters

3840
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
See that was like

3841
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
Autotune as an instrument in a way

3842
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
So it's like

3843
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
Church's does the same thing

3844
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
So I'm not necessarily

3845
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
I don't necessarily subscribe to the fact that autotune is always bad

3846
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
Do some people abuse it? Sure

3847
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Or Lord

3848
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Well all the background singing and

3849
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
Instrumentation was her

3850
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
So my favorite Lord meme

3851
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Will always be the whole like where she posted

3852
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
The thing on her Instagram that says

3853
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
It was graffiti that says Lord help me

3854
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
And it was spelled L-O-R-D-E

3855
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
And she just put as the caption I'm on my way

3856
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
That's cute

3857
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
Anyway

3858
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Darktitsuyu in chat says

3859
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
I do kind of miss the stuff we listened to

3860
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Back in the early 2000's when we did the original

3861
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Show. You know it doesn't seem

3862
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
I've been trying to see if they make Eurodance

3863
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
Kind of like that and I feel like it's more

3864
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
Evolved into like that

3865
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
The trance and the Euro vocal trance

3866
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
Which isn't bad by any means

3867
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
I love that stuff and I listen to a lot of stuff

3868
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
On Spotify

3869
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
Is there any more from what's that artist

3870
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
That kind of partnered up with Paul Terry there for a little bit

3871
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
Orbitribe?

3872
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
Oh I have no idea I have to check

3873
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
Spotify. I just know Armin Van Buren

3874
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
I swear to God is putting out a compilation every week

3875
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
And a podcast

3876
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
He's got a great ear

3877
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
I could listen to any of those mixes he does

3878
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
It's great

3879
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
On a tangent I guess I got away a little bit

3880
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
From the original question

3881
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
I don't even remember what the original question was

3882
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
Okay the original question was

3883
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Pop music we tend to not

3884
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Listen to the new stuff and focus on the stuff we

3885
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Enjoyed as kids. Is that going to be the same situation

3886
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
With video games?

3887
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
I am just saying

3888
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
To be honest although I completely see your point

3889
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Your analogy is not always true

3890
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
So therefore no

3891
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
I think I'm pretty interested in

3892
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
Games coming out now

3893
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
Just there's only certain games I want

3894
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
I think now it's like

3895
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
I don't have Blockbuster and stuff where I could rent

3896
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
Games for five bucks and just play everything

3897
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
Now it's just kind of more selective

3898
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
About it

3899
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
I kind of have a better idea what my tastes are

3900
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
And also you know it used to be that

3901
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
The only exposure on

3902
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
What a game is was from looking at the box

3903
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
Hmm does this look interesting?

3904
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
I guess we'll rent it

3905
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
I don't have like now where the internet

3906
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
You see trailers, you watch the impressions of it

3907
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
You hear people talk about it, read the reviews

3908
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
I mean there's a lot to it

3909
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
You know what's interesting though?

3910
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
And to give YYR the benefit of the doubt

3911
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
I just saw this comment in chat

3912
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
And I'm sorry

3913
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
You're going to think I'm yelling at you and I swear I'm not

3914
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
I respect your opinion. Kasan in our chat room

3915
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
Says I can't think of

3916
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
Three good music videos from the 90s

3917
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
And I'm sitting here about to flip a table

3918
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
I'm like what? What are you talking about?

3919
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
There wasn't three good videos from the 1990s

3920
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
Oh my god like some of the greatest music

3921
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Videos were from the 1990s

3922
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
Like you know

3923
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
I for one think Alanis

3924
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Ironic was a fantastic

3925
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Video at the time. Madonna did

3926
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
So many great videos in the 90s like Ray of Light

3927
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
That Jamiroquai

3928
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
Virtual Insanity was so cool

3929
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
All Gorillaz videos?

3930
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
That was...

3931
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
I mean my god there's a ton of good stuff

3932
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
How many other Michael Jackson videos?

3933
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
So I kind of look at that comment and go

3934
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
What the fuck are you?

3935
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
Again you're welcome to your opinion

3936
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
And that goes to show that YYR to your point

3937
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
I think the opposite might be true

3938
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
Most of the time

3939
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
Not all the time

3940
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
But I think the opposite

3941
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
And what I mean by that is I think people today

3942
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
Who grew up on PlayStation 2

3943
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
Like don't know a world

3944
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
With anything older than a PlayStation 2 or 3

3945
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
I think those people

3946
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
Have a much harder time

3947
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
Going back to NES

3948
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
Atari 2600

3949
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
And appreciating the value of those games

3950
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
The way that we can

3951
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
Most of the time

3952
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
Not saying all the time because certainly there's gonna be

3953
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Like that 18 year old that listens to OLR

3954
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
That says whoa you're wrong

3955
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
My son refers to anything that

3956
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Is 8-bit as Minecraft

3957
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
So he's just like

3958
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
So that game looks like Minecraft

3959
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
So that comment kind of made me think

3960
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
Because I'm sitting here going what are you talking about

3961
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
And I'm thinking well maybe

3962
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
He doesn't have that same perspective

3963
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
That I do because I lived it

3964
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
You know and if you're younger

3965
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
You didn't have the emotional attachment to those videos

3966
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
The way maybe that I do

3967
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
And so I think with video games

3968
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
To YYR's point that's very true

3969
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
So YYR I actually think

3970
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
The complete opposite of what you said is what's true

3971
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
If that makes sense

3972
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Anyway

3973
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
There you go and now everybody in chat is like

3974
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Naming off great 90s music videos

3975
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
Smashing pumpkins oh my god

3976
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
So many amazing 90s music videos

3977
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
Sabotage by Beastie Boys

3978
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Smack My Bitch Up by Prodigy

3979
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
Remember the big twist in that video

3980
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
And that was a controversial one I got banned from MTV

3981
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
Anyway I just want to say

3982
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
I'm not yelling at you

3983
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Your point just kind of made me go

3984
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
What? For a minute

3985
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
So anyway

3986
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Let's move on next email

3987
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
There are still a few

3988
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
So next email comes

3989
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
From Robert M

3990
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
Do any of you yet know whether

3991
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
The bases of Lego Dimensions

3992
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Figures slash builds are able

3993
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
To store data such as studs collected

3994
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
Alternate builds, experience levels

3995
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
And so on nope

3996
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
I do not know the answer I will in a week

3997
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
But I'm sure we have some people in our chat

3998
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Who have played the game who know that

3999
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Do the Lego Dimensions characters save

4000
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Information

4001
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Cause Amiibos can do that right

4002
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
Amiibos do it Skylanders do it

4003
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
I'll give some information cause you can take them to different

4004
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
Does it? Okay

4005
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Maybe somebody in chat can

4006
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Fill us in with a little more information on how that works

4007
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Cause even though I bought it today I haven't played it yet

4008
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
So Brad from Pop Culture

4009
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
Jumping in to say the vehicles do

4010
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
There you go

4011
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
Alright

4012
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
There's the best answer I can get for now

4013
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
Alright next email

4014
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
Eating's Grey and Way Allutation

4015
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Says sorry Jamie it's been a while since I've

4016
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
Messed with Grandpa by using Pig Ladin

4017
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Oh I already know who this is

4018
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
I couldn't help myself by the way I just

4019
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
Caught up on all OLR episodes and I'm

4020
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
Happy to hear Rob is thinking about bringing back

4021
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
That Wednesday show out from

4022
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Hiatus

4023
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
Quickly it's not just my decision

4024
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
To make that clear

4025
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
It's something that Extra for myself

4026
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
And Grandpa are all talking about

4027
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
And even inviting

4028
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
If Shane wants to be a part of it he certainly can

4029
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Although if he doesn't then we respect that too

4030
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Not to get too

4031
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Tangeny sorry I'm interrupting

4032
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
Darkseiders email but I think people want to know

4033
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
Right now really for us

4034
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
We're all kind of burned out on online games

4035
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Like you know I don't even

4036
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Really play Final Fantasy 14 these days

4037
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
Just because there's a real lull

4038
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
Between content patches

4039
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
I don't think Grandpa's playing anything but maybe

4040
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Heroes of the Storm I'm playing Diablo 3 granted

4041
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
But we need to find a new focus

4042
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
And once that's

4043
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
What the three of us have to sit down and figure out

4044
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
So it's almost like starting a new podcast

4045
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
And we realize

4046
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
There's a lot of people out there

4047
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
Who really don't care what we talk about

4048
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Because they're tuning in to hear Grandpa and Extra for

4049
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Gang up on me which is fine

4050
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
But once we figure out what that

4051
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
Supposed topic of the show is going to be

4052
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
And how that format is going to work

4053
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
It'll be back in some form

4054
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Which reminds me I need to talk to you about something

4055
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
Okay

4056
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
Anyway

4057
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
I know you guys

4058
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
Have been wiping on that difficult boss

4059
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
Known as real life but I'm confident

4060
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
That you guys will pull through as you always do

4061
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
As long as Rob keeps up with his heels

4062
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
And Grandpa keeps his drink on

4063
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Because he's better at DPS when he's drunk

4064
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Extra is perfect the way he is tanking

4065
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
And spanking

4066
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
I will pass that message along

4067
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
And Grandpa is back from

4068
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
His big NBA trip

4069
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
He went over

4070
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
He gallivanted across Europe and had beer from all over

4071
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
And supposedly under the guise of education

4072
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Yeah

4073
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
So anyway

4074
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
A little bit of news came out

4075
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Last week on Digital Card Gaming front

4076
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
As some of you might have heard

4077
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
In Spring 2014

4078
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Wizards of the Coast slash Hasbro filed a lawsuit

4079
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Against Cryptozoic Entertainment

4080
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
The lawsuit stated that

4081
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Cryptozoic's digital card game released

4082
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
Hex Shards of Fate

4083
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Infringed on Wizards of the Coast

4084
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Hasbro's card game Magic the Gathering

4085
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
In regards to copyright, trade dress, and patent claims

4086
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
I remember this

4087
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Well I'm happy to say that the lawsuit has been settled

4088
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
As of Thursday of last week

4089
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Link below

4090
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
HexTCG.com slash press dash release dash settlement

4091
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
However

4092
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
Those who have read the press release

4093
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
May have noticed the word license

4094
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
Has shown up twice

4095
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Although details of the settlements are unknown

4096
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
The appearance of the word license

4097
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Make the story a little interesting

4098
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
For me at least

4099
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Regardless I'm glad to know that the matter has been settled

4100
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
And I hope that this

4101
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Bit news will ease

4102
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
The concerns of would be hex players

4103
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Who might have been put off by the lawsuit

4104
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
My question to you guys

4105
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
In chat is this

4106
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
We all know that copyright laws are extremely out of date

4107
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
I understand that we're all not lawyers and senators

4108
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
As far as I know

4109
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
But imagine if you could change those laws

4110
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
How would you change them in accordance

4111
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
To the technological age we live in today

4112
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
I'm not a lawyer

4113
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
It'd have to be revamped

4114
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
With all due respect

4115
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
That is such a deep question

4116
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
I'm not sure I can think of an answer on the spot

4117
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
About how to fix it

4118
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
I want a politician to tell me how they're going to do it

4119
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
And I'm going to nod and say that sounds good

4120
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
How would you do it?

4121
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
I would think it would be a lot harder

4122
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
To trademark

4123
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Very vague, broad

4124
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Things

4125
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
That seems to be a lot of the problem

4126
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Is just the broadness

4127
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
That people can actually patent

4128
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
And the fact that

4129
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
I don't want to say you can't patent ideas

4130
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
Because I realize that defeats the purpose

4131
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
But I gotta say

4132
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
Since you're listening to old episodes of OLR

4133
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
I really truly think

4134
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
We have what? 616 episodes of the show we've done

4135
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
If there's like 10 OLR episodes

4136
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
You must listen to before you die

4137
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
That episode that Kyle Ward was on

4138
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
A couple months ago

4139
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
And sorry I don't remember the number off the top of my head

4140
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
I need to crowd source that one for a minute

4141
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
Dark Tetsuya what number was that?

4142
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
That is one of the 10 episodes you need to hear of OLR

4143
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Because

4144
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
Kyle talking about

4145
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
What he went through with his game

4146
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
And what he realized about these various

4147
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Patents that Konami actually owned

4148
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
We were sitting here going

4149
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
Thank you 596

4150
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
I knew it was right before 600

4151
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
That is one of the 10 I truly feel

4152
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
I can't believe you can actually Google our episodes

4153
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Would you guys agree with me?

4154
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
I think that's really one of the 10 best episodes we ever did

4155
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
And just that insight

4156
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
That he really gave us into that

4157
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
And kind of how the sausage is made

4158
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Sort of thing

4159
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
I really think kind of plays into exactly why you're seeing the word license

4160
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
I think Wizards of the Coast

4161
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
Or whatever had some type of patent

4162
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
In this thing that had

4163
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
Hex by the balls that they couldn't get out of

4164
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
And so they had to license it

4165
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
And I don't think the fans

4166
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
Should lash out at Hex for this

4167
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
I think the fans should take their case to

4168
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Wanting this patent law reformed

4169
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
And how was a patent granted

4170
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
For this in the first place

4171
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
Question mark

4172
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
I think the rules about what we do

4173
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
And what we don't patent

4174
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Need to be more clearly defined

4175
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
I can see them with patenting the rules of the game

4176
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
Or something like that

4177
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
And if they're copying the exact rules of the game

4178
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
Then there could be issues

4179
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
But I think general

4180
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
Patents for just like

4181
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
Arrows scrolling up a screen

4182
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Or method to blah blah blah

4183
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
I think they should be granted

4184
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
For a couple years and then that's it

4185
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
Make your money off of it

4186
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
And then it goes public domain

4187
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Kind of like how medicine is

4188
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
When you find a drug that's patented for what

4189
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
7 years and you get to make it

4190
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
And then that's it

4191
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Then it can go generic after that

4192
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
Because that 7 years is long enough

4193
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Especially with an idea like arrows

4194
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
Scrolling up the screen

4195
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Look how long DDR lasted

4196
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
It's really not around anymore

4197
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:55,000
It is not the cultural thing it was

4198
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:57,000
When we first started doing OLR

4199
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:59,000
You know so I think these ideas

4200
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
Kind of have their cycle

4201
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:03,000
And then they kind of come and go

4202
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:05,000
And look what happened with the plastic instruments and all that

4203
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:07,000
Well you know who's pushing for all that

4204
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Copyright stuff to be extended out

4205
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Disney

4206
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:11,000
Absolutely

4207
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
Well because they're scared as hell what's going to happen

4208
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
When Mickey Mouse goes in the public domain

4209
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
I mean I could

4210
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
I could put a picture

4211
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:21,000
I mean I guess I could do this today under parody law

4212
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Technically but I could sell a shirt

4213
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Of me pooping on Mickey Mouse

4214
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
I could sell a shirt

4215
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,000
And there's nothing they could do to stop me

4216
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,000
Once Mickey Mouse is in the public domain

4217
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
That's what they're afraid of

4218
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
You want to charge like $200

4219
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:37,000
For me to go to Disneyland

4220
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,000
I'm going to make my own Disneyland

4221
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
I could have a picture of a shirt

4222
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:43,000
I could have a picture of a shirt with Mickey Mouse

4223
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
On it that says I love dick

4224
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
And there's nothing they could do about it

4225
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Now they can because I can't sell that shirt

4226
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
I mean I could do it under parody

4227
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:53,000
If I put it onto my Twitter account they can't do anything

4228
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
But if I sell a shirt with Mickey Mouse

4229
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
That says I love dick they could sue me

4230
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
But they won't once

4231
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
Mickey goes in the public domain so you're right

4232
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Disney is scared as hell of that stuff

4233
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:05,000
Banksy just did it with Dismaland

4234
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:07,000
Oh that's right

4235
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:09,000
But he didn't use the characters exactly

4236
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
And you could kind of say that's parody

4237
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
It was parody it was also a political statement

4238
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
But yeah

4239
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
Boy did we get on a tangent with that email

4240
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
We do that here at OLR don't we

4241
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:21,000
Alright

4242
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
P.S. Rob I'm happy to

4243
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
Know that you're starting to fulfill the first

4244
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
Part of your new years resolution

4245
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
In regards to streaming yes I did watch the

4246
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:31,000
Broadcasting of your stream from yesterday

4247
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:33,000
However I've yet to see

4248
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
That platinum that you were hoping

4249
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
To get on Diablo 3 PS4

4250
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:39,000
Which was the second part of your new years

4251
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:41,000
Resolution lol

4252
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
It's all good Rob not all of us are meant to achieve

4253
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
Platinum status in games

4254
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:47,000
Snuggles and huggles to you all

4255
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
Not so sincerely degenerate Johnny

4256
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:51,000
I've got three months left

4257
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:53,000
Here's what's going to do me in I'm not going to have

4258
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
The vacation time over the holidays like I had

4259
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:57,000
Last year because of the job switch so

4260
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
I don't know we'll see we'll see

4261
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
I'm also actually considering

4262
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
Doing like a weekly twitch again

4263
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:05,000
Because you know how I was

4264
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,000
Playing hot to full boyfriend

4265
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:09,000
I'm actually just thinking about doing just

4266
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
Jamie fucks around in Dragon Age

4267
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
And cheats

4268
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
As long as you kind of like give commentary and talk

4269
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Through it it could be very interesting

4270
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
I just like playing the game

4271
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:21,000
And like answering people

4272
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:23,000
We talked about this last week though where it's just different

4273
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
Depending on the stream you know I did a Diablo 3

4274
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:27,000
You guys have to tell me what you think of this I don't think

4275
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
Anybody saw it but it's on my archive

4276
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,000
Twitch TV slash Rob Roberts

4277
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
Maybe I'll do it again tonight if I have time

4278
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:35,000
I was playing some Diablo 3 yesterday because for me

4279
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
PC streaming is the easiest but

4280
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:39,000
Using that new game show software I actually

4281
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Set up different camera things

4282
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
So that like when I was in between stages

4283
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:45,000
It was my little cam you could see my cam

4284
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:47,000
And the Diablo screen I would kind of talk to the camera

4285
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:49,000
And then I could even click a button

4286
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:51,000
And it would make the screen even smaller and you would

4287
02:23:51,000 --> 02:23:53,000
See the chat room and I would respond to chat comments

4288
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
Although there weren't a lot yesterday because it was Saturday afternoon

4289
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:57,000
But then when I actually went into the Rift

4290
02:23:57,000 --> 02:23:59,000
And I was doing heavy game playing

4291
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:01,000
I clicked another button and made the game full screen

4292
02:24:01,000 --> 02:24:03,000
And I just talked over it and I thought that was

4293
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
Like I like being able to switch between

4294
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
Them I think is even better

4295
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:09,000
Than just a static image that's what I would like

4296
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
To do more of in the future but that game show right now

4297
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:13,000
Is kind of limiting on

4298
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:15,000
Some features but

4299
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
Anyway I'll get into that at a later time

4300
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:19,000
I gotta let Jamie finish the email

4301
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,000
Hey OLR Delvin here

4302
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,000
From Video Game Realness, long time listener

4303
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
First time emailer Delvin is

4304
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
Awesome and he's my podcasting buddy

4305
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
On a seasonal show, reading is fundamental

4306
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
Did you know I did a show on RuPaul's Drag Race?

4307
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
We do a podcast

4308
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
The listeners might not

4309
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:37,000
And knowing is half the battle

4310
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:39,000
This past weekend

4311
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
Was the start of a League of Legends

4312
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,000
World Championship and I have been watching

4313
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
A fair amount of it

4314
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
Despite being terrible at the game

4315
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
I have been playing League of Legends for a few years now

4316
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
Also have friends who have played it

4317
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
Since the game first came out

4318
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
To see where the game started

4319
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
And what it has become over the past few years

4320
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Is incredibly mind boggling in a good way

4321
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,000
As far as the esports scene

4322
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
For the game goes, it started out as friends

4323
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,000
Who were good at the game, made teams

4324
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:07,000
And competed at local or national events

4325
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:09,000
And now has grown into a full fledged sport

4326
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
Having managers, sponsors, drafts

4327
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:13,000
And large amounts of viewers and teams

4328
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:15,000
That have become full on brands

4329
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
And household names among the gaming community

4330
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
I'm curious to know

4331
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:21,000
What is OLR's thoughts on esports

4332
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:23,000
Mainly League of Legends has become

4333
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
And do you see it as good or bad for gaming?

4334
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
Your pal, Delvin, Video Game Realness

4335
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:29,000
P.S. For those who don't know

4336
02:25:29,000 --> 02:25:31,000
Rob has a long lost brother who plays League of Legends

4337
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
Professionally for Cloud9 Gaming

4338
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:35,000
Under the name LemonNation, look it up

4339
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
I'm not really good at them, therefore I don't really have much of an interest in them

4340
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:09,000
But it's not that I want to see these games tank

4341
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Because I don't

4342
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
I don't carry that negativity

4343
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
And I think the money that gets poured into this stuff

4344
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
I mean, A. It's exposure for gaming

4345
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
It's more of a positive image for gaming

4346
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
That it's not all necessarily

4347
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
Just like guns blazing

4348
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:25,000
And Doom and Mortal Kombat

4349
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:27,000
Ripping heads off of bodies and stuff

4350
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:29,000
It kind of gets a little more into that

4351
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
Strategical side of games

4352
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
So I like that that's kind of what's out there

4353
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
More and more in the populace

4354
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
And with TBS taking on some Counter-Strike

4355
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
Next year and so forth

4356
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
A little more of the

4357
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:43,000
Strategical and the actual game side of things

4358
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
But I personally

4359
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
It's hard

4360
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
I try to watch it and I'm just kind of like

4361
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
I don't understand what the fuck's going on

4362
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:53,000
But I did

4363
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:55,000
Shane and I watched on Twitch a little bit of the

4364
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
Heroes of the Storm stuff

4365
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:59,000
A lot of my co-workers play that

4366
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
Which is basically

4367
02:27:01,000 --> 02:27:03,000
League of Legends dumbed down

4368
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:05,000
For people like me

4369
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
Blizzard is A plus

4370
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
Pro at dumbing games down

4371
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
And making them accessible and that's not a bad thing at all

4372
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
That's just what they do

4373
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
And they're going to do it with the Team Fortress thing

4374
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
And the first person shooter with this game they're making now

4375
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
Overwatch

4376
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
Anyway

4377
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
Shane and I did watch some of that

4378
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:25,000
I was kind of into it

4379
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
Because at least I understand this game

4380
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:29,000
But do I get caught up in the celebrity

4381
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:31,000
Of it all and that end of it?

4382
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Not really

4383
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:35,000
That I'm not really so into

4384
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:37,000
And I'm not sure I understand

4385
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:39,000
That yet

4386
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
And that's what I struggled with a little bit at TwitchCon

4387
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
As well is that

4388
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:45,000
I guess I'm surrounded by a lot of famous people

4389
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:47,000
But they're just

4390
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,000
Other con-goers to me

4391
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:51,000
I'm not really caught up in that celebrity

4392
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
But at the same time

4393
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,000
They have no idea what the fuck I'm doing

4394
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:57,000
With a podcaster that I'm part of

4395
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
The longest running video game podcast on the internet

4396
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
They don't know that

4397
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:03,000
It's this interesting kind of like other side

4398
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
I don't know how to phrase it

4399
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:07,000
But yeah

4400
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
I guess that's my very long winded thoughts on that

4401
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:11,000
Overall I think it's a good thing

4402
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
It presents a good image

4403
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:15,000
For video gaming and gaming culture

4404
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:17,000
But I have a really hard time

4405
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
Getting wrapped up in the celebrity

4406
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,000
And especially over that particular game

4407
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
It's just not one I'm thrilled about

4408
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
But I don't want you to take that as like a negative

4409
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,000
That I hate it because I don't

4410
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:29,000
Okay cool

4411
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
It's just like football

4412
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:33,000
I don't hate football, it's just not for me

4413
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,000
I like hockey though

4414
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
And I bet SSJ100Matt's happy to hear that

4415
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
I like hockey, that I understand

4416
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:41,000
So there you go

4417
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
That's my thoughts on the email

4418
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
I don't know if you guys have something to add

4419
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
Or if anybody in chat is saying anything on that

4420
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:49,000
Seattle in chat says

4421
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
The only Blizzard game I really really want to play

4422
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
And maybe Starcraft 2

4423
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,000
I love Diablo 3

4424
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
But like I'm terrible at Starcraft 2

4425
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
I am terrible at it

4426
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:01,000
I will say when I've watched the professional Starcraft 2 stuff

4427
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
I'm just like how do they fucking know what to do so fast

4428
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:05,000
But then I think back to

4429
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
When you and I

4430
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:09,000
All of us here

4431
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:11,000
Used to play

4432
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:13,000
DDR back at Roseville Golfland

4433
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:15,000
And we were doing songs like Orion 7-8

4434
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,000
With the note chart that's just all the arrows

4435
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:19,000
Smashed together

4436
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
Like that's how fast your feet are moving right?

4437
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
And like when people would watch us

4438
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:25,000
Play that they were probably like

4439
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
How the hell do they move their feet that fast

4440
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:29,000
How do they read that

4441
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:31,000
I can't do that anymore

4442
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
But it was practice

4443
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
And a real love of the game

4444
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
And just playing it over and over and over again

4445
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:39,000
And so I get it

4446
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
That's what they're doing in Starcraft 2

4447
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
Is that they know all the keyboard shortcuts

4448
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
And that crazy shit because they really love the game

4449
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
And they learned it

4450
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
So anyway

4451
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
That's my thoughts

4452
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:53,000
My long winded thoughts as usual

4453
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
I don't know if you guys want to add anything

4454
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:57,000
And that was it for email

4455
02:29:57,000 --> 02:29:59,000
That's it for email that was a long email segment tonight

4456
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
But very good you guys did a very good job tonight

4457
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

4458
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:05,000
And now

4459
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:07,000
That that is over it is time

4460
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
To get a little bit angsty

4461
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
Here at OLR with a segment we call

4462
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
The FUs of the Week

4463
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
And why do we get so angry here at OLR?

4464
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
Well we have issues

4465
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:35,000
A major FU to my digestive system

4466
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:37,000
I'm sure people remember a couple weeks ago

4467
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:39,000
I was out sick

4468
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:41,000
Like sick sick

4469
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:43,000
Like quarantine sick

4470
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
And it turns out that I still have a problem

4471
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:47,000
They actually don't know that because I blamed it

4472
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
On the Jewish holiday that was going on at the time

4473
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
Well I mean that's originally why I was going to be out

4474
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,000
But it turned out that I ended up being told

4475
02:30:53,000 --> 02:30:55,000
Don't go out among people

4476
02:30:55,000 --> 02:30:57,000
Gotcha

4477
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
So I still have the problem

4478
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
For the last week or so

4479
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
I haven't been able to eat more than about

4480
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
600 calories worth of stuff a day

4481
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
Oh my gosh

4482
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
And I've had to go a few days without any coffee

4483
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
Which is difficult

4484
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
So I

4485
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
Yeah, screw it

4486
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
I hate it

4487
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
I like pie and I'm going to eat pie tonight and if it makes me sick

4488
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
Oh well

4489
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
Pie is awesome

4490
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
Loki, how about you?

4491
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
I guess my FU of the Week is going to be going

4492
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
To

4493
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
Just

4494
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
I don't know

4495
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
Not being able to find the right font for my stupid

4496
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
Games logo

4497
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:39,000
Because I know what it is

4498
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:41,000
Try Papyrus

4499
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:43,000
Or Comic Sans

4500
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
Don't you fucking dare

4501
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:47,000
Or the best thing I've ever seen called

4502
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:49,000
Comic Papyrus

4503
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,000
Actually I'll show you a funny one

4504
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:53,000
Is Comic Slab

4505
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:55,000
It's basically Comic Sans

4506
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:57,000
But done with a slab serif

4507
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:59,000
So it's kind of funny

4508
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:01,000
We'll see

4509
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:03,000
I will

4510
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:05,000
Check those out I guess

4511
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:07,000
So that's what I've been working on this week

4512
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
And wasting so much time doing so

4513
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,000
By the way I have like a million fonts now and none of them

4514
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
Seems to be good enough

4515
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:15,000
My FU of the Week

4516
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:17,000
Goes to Shane for being an enabler

4517
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
And just watching me spend all that money today

4518
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
And not trying to do anything

4519
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:23,000
To stop it

4520
02:32:23,000 --> 02:32:25,000
That's fair, right?

4521
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:27,000
Alright, there it is

4522
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:29,000
The FU of the Week segment

4523
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
By the way, Hitstun in chat over at

4524
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
Live.vognetwork.com saying

4525
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
That Hitstun has finished

4526
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
Loki's castle level and saying

4527
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
My FU of the Week goes to Jigsaw's Castle of Carnage

4528
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:41,000
So there you go Loki, somebody beat him

4529
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:43,000
There you go

4530
02:32:43,000 --> 02:32:45,000
How many tries did it take you Hitstun?

4531
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
I just want to know

4532
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
Alright, anyhow

4533
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,000
Let's get to a couple more news stories and then we'll get to the Skype line

4534
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:53,000
Which I'm only going to leave open for a little bit tonight

4535
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
So if you want to get through you better be fast

4536
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
And I'll let you know when that's open here in just a moment

4537
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
Now Hitstun says 20 tries

4538
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:01,000
That's still really good

4539
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:03,000
Yeah, it's better than I did

4540
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
So Jeremy's level is from Koopa Club

4541
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:07,000
He did some, I swear to god

4542
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:09,000
I died like 70 times on one of them

4543
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
I will have to try this

4544
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
And I was cursing his name in 7 different languages

4545
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:15,000
More news stories, Loki

4546
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
Alright, so beat Takashi

4547
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,000
Is going to be in the new Yakuza game

4548
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:21,000
That's pretty cool

4549
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:23,000
Let's see

4550
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
Apparently

4551
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:27,000
I'm not really sure who

4552
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,000
Is supposed to be in the actual game here

4553
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
Did you watch the little trailer thing?

4554
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
Nope, I did not

4555
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
Okay, so someone posted on Twitter

4556
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
Just the back of his head

4557
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:39,000
And said, guess who's going to be in the next Yakuza game

4558
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,000
And I was like, oh it's Kitano Takashi

4559
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
And I only knew it from the back of his head

4560
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
But I knew that he also did a bunch of Yakuza movies

4561
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:47,000
Like that was his thing

4562
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:49,000
And then I saw the little trailer and it's totally his voice

4563
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
So

4564
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
Neat

4565
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
Cool

4566
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:57,000
That's all I got

4567
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
I just thought you'd enjoy that because I know you were a big fan of Takashi's castle

4568
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:01,000
I was

4569
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:03,000
I really wish they'd bring

4570
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:05,000
I just

4571
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:07,000
That's what I want

4572
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:09,000
I want like a channel of just

4573
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:11,000
Subtitled

4574
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
Japanese game shows

4575
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:15,000
Is that like a thing that can happen?

4576
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:17,000
Because I know

4577
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:19,000
It's got to be out there

4578
02:34:19,000 --> 02:34:21,000
Because they used to record that stuff for our Japanese class

4579
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
So I think they have like a local channel

4580
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:25,000
In San Francisco or something

4581
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
They've got to have

4582
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:29,000
Because we used to watch

4583
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:31,000
Furuhata

4584
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,000
Oh god I love Furuhata

4585
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
There is a channel in the bay area

4586
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
That does all Japanese TV

4587
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:39,000
Mostly like dramas and game shows

4588
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:41,000
That's what I want

4589
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
Japanese game show channel

4590
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:45,000
And I need to watch

4591
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:47,000
More Silent Library because that was also funny

4592
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:49,000
That was the closest thing I had to a Japanese game

4593
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:51,000
Was that the MTV?

4594
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
It was

4595
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:55,000
It was so stupid

4596
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:57,000
It was like a Japanese game show

4597
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:59,000
It was really stupid

4598
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:01,000
That show kind of got it

4599
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
When they try to bring that stuff over here

4600
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
Like with the hole in the wall

4601
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:07,000
They lose it's charm

4602
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:09,000
They're like

4603
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:11,000
Oh that's what they did

4604
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:13,000
And they just make a really terrible knock off

4605
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:15,000
It doesn't have the same

4606
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:17,000
I don't know

4607
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:19,000
Like seriousness

4608
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:21,000
Perfect example

4609
02:35:21,000 --> 02:35:23,000
Like some of the cooking competition shows

4610
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
In Iron Chef Japan

4611
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
It was very serious

4612
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
And very artful

4613
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
Iron Chef America is like

4614
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
The pompousness

4615
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
And grandstanding of it all is what made that show

4616
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
Great and when they brought it to the US

4617
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
It was kind of like I'm his cousin

4618
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:41,000
I do things differently

4619
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:43,000
Woo

4620
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
It's sort of

4621
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:47,000
It's still good but it lost

4622
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:49,000
That charm to it

4623
02:35:49,000 --> 02:35:51,000
Agree

4624
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
She links us to

4625
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:55,000
Actually a pretty awesome movie called Outrage

4626
02:35:55,000 --> 02:35:57,000
That has

4627
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
Takeshi in it

4628
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,000
Very cool

4629
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:03,000
Alright well one more story for you guys

4630
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,000
About and some of you might have heard about this

4631
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
But did you know there was an unreleased

4632
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
And unfinished South Park game

4633
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:11,000
It was apparently cancelled

4634
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:13,000
It was on the Xbox

4635
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:15,000
The first Xbox

4636
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:17,000
I almost said the Xbox one

4637
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:19,000
But I made the first Xbox

4638
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
And yeah if you actually watch some of the video

4639
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:23,000
I mean this is a very early build

4640
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:25,000
I mean half the town is not even finished

4641
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:27,000
But it moves around in a 3D

4642
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:29,000
Environment which is very interesting to see

4643
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:31,000
And it's not at all like

4644
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,000
South Park 64

4645
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,000
Yeah it kind of looks a little more like South Park 64

4646
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,000
But with better polygons

4647
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
And so forth

4648
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
But it looks like they even had some cut scenes

4649
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:43,000
That were in there and some of the voice acting was done

4650
02:36:43,000 --> 02:36:45,000
There was a workable combat system in place

4651
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
Cartman can actually fight dogs

4652
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
In one part of it

4653
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
So that's kind of neat

4654
02:36:51,000 --> 02:36:53,000
Buzz Monkey was the studio that made

4655
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
The game and it was eventually snapped up

4656
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
By Zynga and became a part of that collective

4657
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,000
But the game never happened

4658
02:36:59,000 --> 02:37:01,000
And I don't know if that's because I think it was a little late

4659
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:03,000
In the Xbox's life that this was being put

4660
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:05,000
Together and maybe they decided not to do it

4661
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
But we still have the fractured

4662
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:09,000
Butthole which I

4663
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
I will never get over that title

4664
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:13,000
That is still coming

4665
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:15,000
I think I'm going to make that my goal this week

4666
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
To go back and play signature

4667
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:19,000
Because I never finished it on Xbox

4668
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:21,000
And I need to go play it

4669
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:23,000
And finish it before I get to the fractured

4670
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:25,000
Butthole

4671
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:27,000
Now when they release that are they going to include the first game

4672
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:29,000
With that too because I think that's coming out on PlayStation 4

4673
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
Because that would be pretty cool if they did

4674
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
I don't think that's part of the plan

4675
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
Because it's a different studio doing it too

4676
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
That's too bad

4677
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:39,000
I think the game itself will be different

4678
02:37:39,000 --> 02:37:41,000
But as long as, I mean if Trey and Matt are still involved

4679
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,000
They'll have that same humor

4680
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
Which is usually on point

4681
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:47,000
It depends what season it is

4682
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:49,000
Sometimes it's on point, sometimes it's

4683
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:51,000
I miss a lot of South Park

4684
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,000
It's one of those shows I forget is on

4685
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:55,000
Because it's so infrequent that there's new episodes

4686
02:37:55,000 --> 02:37:57,000
And then when you happen to see it on TV

4687
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,000
It's like oh god this episode is ages old

4688
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:01,000
But then when you remember

4689
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
Oh yeah there's a new South Park on you watch it

4690
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:05,000
Most of the time it's really

4691
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:07,000
Really funny and on point

4692
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
I just don't like the multi story arcs

4693
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
They do the four episode long

4694
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:13,000
God, one of them they did was awful

4695
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,000
It was Imaginationland

4696
02:38:15,000 --> 02:38:17,000
I didn't like that one at all

4697
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:19,000
I liked that, that was fine

4698
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:21,000
Some of the other ones are coming

4699
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:23,000
Exactly, anyway

4700
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
Phone lines are open

02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:31,000
If you want to give us a call

4704
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:33,000
We'll be happy to have you on the show

4705
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:35,000
We're only going to keep this open for a little bit

4706
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:37,000
So if you want to call

4707
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
Try to get in now

4708
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
It's almost 9 o'clock here on the west coast

4709
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
Which means midnight on the east coast

4710
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
And lucky us we have a call coming in already

4711
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
So let's get to it

4712
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

4713
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
Hey guys it's Jason

4714
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
Hey Jason, oh my gosh are you driving right now?

4715
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
I am hands free

4716
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
I have my headset in my phone

4717
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
I am in the high country of California

4718
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
Just about to hit Truckee here

4719
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
Probably about the time this call is going to be over

4720
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
No I know you're a good boy

4721
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
And you wouldn't drive

4722
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
And have the hands and all that

4723
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
But I can hear that rushing wind sound

4724
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
Of the car

4725
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
So sad you came right through Sacramento

4726
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
But couldn't stop by tonight because you're on a schedule

4727
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
I understand

4728
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
I'm already a little bit behind because I am

4729
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
A wonderful procrastinator

4730
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
And we'll just leave it at that

4731
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
As long as you waved when you went by Sacramento

4732
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
I absolutely did

4733
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
I saw all the buildings and I was like I think it's that way

4734
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
You

4735
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
You felt my presence

4736
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
As long as that's the case I'm happy

4737
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
What's on your mind tonight? You must be listening in the car

4738
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
What's up?

4739
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
I am here with your weekly

4740
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
Twitch report

4741
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
I think I mentioned

4742
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
Last week that I am

4743
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
Predominantly a variety

4744
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
I follow variety streams

4745
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
The

4746
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
Extent of esports and streaming for me

4747
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
Is I watched a couple of the internationals

4748
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
And then I follow a couple of

4749
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
Speedrunners which are definitely

4750
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
Kind of in the middle ground but they still have their personality

4751
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
That they put into it

4752
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
But I am predominantly a variety caster

4753
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
But I still kind of pay attention to

4754
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
Trends

4755
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
Twitch really likes putting the top games

4756
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
In your face especially on the mobile app

4757
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
That being the default view so you see this kind of stuff

4758
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
And the obvious

4759
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
Trends like variety casters still have

4760
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
Their

4761
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
Trope caliber expectations

4762
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
Everybody's breaking out the scary

4763
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
Games for October

4764
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
Have we covered

4765
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
Until dawn?

4766
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
Whoa what do you mean by covered

4767
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
Because sorry I just dropped my phone

4768
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
Literally while you were talking

4769
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
Was there anything

4770
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
I'm not actually sure how old the game is

4771
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
It's less than a year and a half

4772
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
Because it's modern consoles

4773
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
Was there

4774
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
With Five Nights at Freddy's

4775
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
Kind of

4776
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
Spearheading the fear

4777
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
Of the games and that kind of stuff

4778
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
And everybody trying to be into this space

4779
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
That series

4780
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
Until Dawn

4781
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
Stoma

4782
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
What are some of the newer ones I can't even think of

4783
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
Me personally I follow some stuff with Fatal Frame 5

4784
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
I'll tell you where we're at

4785
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
With Until Dawn is that

4786
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
That game actually only came out probably about six weeks ago

4787
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
It's not an incredibly old game

4788
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
It's been out for about a month

4789
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
And actually I think that was the last livestream

4790
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
I did for my Playstation 4

4791
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
It made me play it

4792
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
And yeah

4793
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
It is another one of those scary games

4794
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
And it's like I just knew

4795
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
Do you want to walk left or walk right

4796
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
And I'm like great

4797
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
Which direction is going to get my head chopped off

4798
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
And which one is going to get me to safety

4799
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
I kind of can't deal with that type of pressure

4800
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
It's scary

4801
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
But yeah

4802
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
You know what's interesting

4803
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
Is I really think Sony wrote that game off

4804
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
I really do

4805
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
They originally wrote that game off

4806
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
And I think it has to do with the performance

4807
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
Of The Order

4808
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
And I don't know what those games have in common

4809
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
Besides the fact that they were both early showcased games

4810
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
For Playstation

4811
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
But I don't think Sony has thrown a lot of oomph behind that game

4812
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
But I think

4813
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
Because of livestreaming

4814
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
In large part

4815
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
I think that game is doing a whole lot better

4816
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
And unfortunately we lost Jason

4817
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
And knowing where he is in California right now

4818
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
If he's coming through Truckee

4819
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
I'm in the mountain ranges of California right now

4820
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
And so I'm actually trying to call him back

4821
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
I don't usually do this

4822
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
But for Jason who does a lot of favors for OLR

4823
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
I will make phone

4824
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
I think we have him back

4825
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
Hi Jason are you back with us

4826
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
Maybe

4827
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
Jason I know you're in the high country in California right now

4828
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
So your signal probably sucks

4829
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
But I'm hoping you understand me

4830
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
So I was just saying that Until Dawn

4831
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
I actually think it's kind of gained that cult status

4832
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
In a way

4833
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
In a big way

4834
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
But I bet that game is doing better than they expected

4835
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
And I actually think livestreaming

4836
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
Absolutely plays into that

4837
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
Because that game does lend itself pretty well

4838
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
Because you know there's people out there going

4839
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
And it's like participating with a bad movie

4840
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
Don't go back there

4841
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
Don't go back there

4842
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
People in the live feed or whatever can scream

4843
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
Don't go left, don't go left

4844
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
And either the person is an idiot and goes left

4845
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
And gets their head chopped off or whatever

4846
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
So anyway

4847
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
Did you have some thoughts on that you wanted to try and get out

4848
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:25,000
I was mostly curious about how old it is

4849
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:28,000
Because of the variety rounds that it's making right now

4850
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:32,000
Like I said I didn't think it was too particularly old

4851
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:38,000
And it's strange to think that with the prime season

4852
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
That applies to the theme of the game

4853
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
That they would already kind of like set it aside

4854
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
But I really hope that they've seen successes with it

4855
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:47,000
Because the sheer amount of play time

4856
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:53,000
I think I saw it at number 25 on the top games on Twitch

4857
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
And you know that kind of stuff

4858
02:43:55,000 --> 02:44:00,000
It only takes one influential streamer to crack the top 20

4859
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:04,000
But certainly with the rotation

4860
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
People saving it closer to Halloween

4861
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
And all that kind of stuff

4862
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
That's a big deal to have that

4863
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:16,000
I'm not hearing anything about scary game lineups this year

4864
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
You're cutting out a little bit again

4865
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:21,000
But I think especially this really is that time of year for scary game streaming

4866
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:24,000
And yeah I think Until Dawn is going to be a part of that

4867
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
I don't know if you heard, not to shift things radically

4868
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:29,000
But I don't know if you heard the Jackbox interview earlier in the show

4869
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:32,000
But they were talking a little bit about how streaming is really kind of

4870
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:35,000
And almost I kind of feel like in that interview

4871
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:40,000
Is a part of the reason why You Don't Know Jack isn't a part of this second box

4872
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:44,000
Is that well we wanted to focus on games that were better for streaming

4873
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
And multiplayer and so forth

4874
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
And that was kind of a, like it made a lot of sense when he said it

4875
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:51,000
And I was like wow that's kind of neat

4876
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:54,000
So, anyway

4877
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
I think unfortunately Jason is cutting out again

4878
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
So I'm going to have to go ahead and end the call

4879
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
And just hope that he has a safe drive

4880
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
On his way back there

4881
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:05,000
And hopefully he'll be able to hear this on the podcast feed or something else later

4882
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
But I am going to go ahead and open up the Skype line again

4883
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
At 1877 Game OLR

4884
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
Or username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio

4885
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
You know we don't often get called from moving vehicles

4886
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
So that one was a little bit special

4887
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
But anyway it is lighting up again

4888
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
So let's get to the next call

4889
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

4890
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
Hello Rob

4891
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
Hey it's Marissa, how are you?

4892
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
I'm good, how are you?

4893
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
Good, great to hear from you, what's on your mind my friend?

4894
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
I feel very rude

4895
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
Because I only had the opportunity to tune in just now

4896
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
But I'm always happy to hear the show

4897
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
That's okay, it's a long show

4898
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
It's a long commitment to listen to the whole show, I understand

4899
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
That's true

4900
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
Yeah I was out and about also

4901
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
But you were talking about scary games

4902
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
And actually Chris and I have been playing

4903
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
The Walking Dead game together

4904
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
And slowly and surely we've been learning

4905
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
That I'm the more depraved one

4906
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
Based on our decisions

4907
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
So you let that person live

4908
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
You're an asshole

4909
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
We learn new things about each other

4910
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
So in other words

4911
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
With the difficult choices you make in that game

4912
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
For instance, there's some scenes

4913
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
In that game where it's like, do you want to save

4914
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
This person or this person

4915
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
And so you probably, you know, save a person

4916
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
And so Chris will probably

4917
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
You know, be like, why would you want to save that person?

4918
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
Right, you guys kind of get into those type of arguments

4919
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
I've learned that I am a cold ass

4920
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
Motherfucker

4921
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
And my boyfriend

4922
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
Is a sweet, thoughtful man

4923
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
That's what I have learned

4924
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
Like why would you let that person

4925
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
Live, he was an asshole anyway

4926
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
You know

4927
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
He was dead weight, you gotta keep moving honey

4928
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
Now I'm sure you are sweet and thoughtful

4929
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
Aplenty in real life

4930
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
But it's just the video games bring out

4931
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
The worst in you, which is fine

4932
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
It happens to me too

4933
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
Yeah, don't defend the media's position, right?

4934
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
Exactly

4935
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
Actually

4936
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
I did have some

4937
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
Some news too, it's not directly

4938
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
Game related, but for anybody that likes

4939
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
Sci-fi or on the video

4940
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
Game side, for anyone that

4941
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
Really enjoyed The Scarecrow

4942
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
Scarecrow

4943
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
I've had a long day

4944
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
Scarecrow

4945
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
Not the most recent

4946
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
But the previous Batman games

4947
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
Is played by Dino Andrade

4948
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
I'm part of an audio

4949
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
Podcast or radio drama

4950
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
With our friend Ben, who has called in a few times

4951
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
He also hosts the show Port Center

4952
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
On YouTube

4953
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
And we're releasing one a month

4954
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
It's called Jump Leads, it was based on a popular webcomic

4955
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
So I'm excited to announce

4956
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
That for anybody that likes Red Dwarf

4957
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
And Doctor Who

4958
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
And everything British and fun

4959
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
I feel like I've known Dino

4960
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
Online forever

4961
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
We've followed each other on Twitter

4962
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
Since the beginning

4963
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
I missed him at Dragon Con

4964
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
Because you never know what the schedule

4965
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
Is actually going to be

4966
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
I've got to message him offline

4967
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
Now that things have calmed down a bit

4968
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
Hopefully with convention season

4969
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
And try to get him on the show

4970
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
He's one of the best voice actors here

4971
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
At Orange Launch Radio

4972
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
Have you guys talked about the strike?

4973
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
We brought it up last week

4974
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
I wasn't sure if I wanted to go there with you

4975
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
But since you said it

4976
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
I'm going to go there

4977
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
I actually did repost

4978
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
The thing with the terms of the strike

4979
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
And the link to vote on it

4980
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
On my public Facebook

4981
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
My understanding is that

4982
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
They've gone radio silent on that

4983
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
We know it's a possibility

4984
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
We don't know if it's actually happening

4985
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
Or not yet, right?

4986
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
Yeah, it's been pretty quiet

4987
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
And you know

4988
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
It's funny because out of all the nuances

4989
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
Of the whole argument

4990
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
The only thing that I find the most interesting

4991
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
Were people talking about other sides of the industry

4992
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
Not perhaps being fairly compensated

4993
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
And why should you worry about the actors

4994
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
First, and I kind of thought

4995
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
So you're saying that everyone should just be equally

4996
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
Screwed?

4997
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
You know what?

4998
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
I think a lot of the concerns

4999
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
And I'm not going to be one to get into the money

5000
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
Because I don't know how that all works

5001
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
But as far as the whole

5002
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
Having certain rules

5003
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
Like going into the studio and screaming

5004
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
For four hours on end

5005
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
What's funny is that when you helped us out

5006
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
And we got Greg

5007
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
And those guys on the show

5008
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
The fact that they were talking about

5009
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
Oh, does your agent make sure that you only get the two

5010
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
It kind of dawned on me

5011
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
Oh yeah, not everybody gets that

5012
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
So kind of setting those sort of

5013
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
What are essentially safety

5014
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
Safe working conditions

5015
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
I think is more than fair

5016
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
So for that side of things

5017
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
And again, I'm not going to get into the money things

5018
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
I just don't know

5019
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
But as far as those safety conditions

5020
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
That seems awfully reasonable

5021
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
It is, you know I did

5022
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:50,000
I've done things where I've blown out my voice

5023
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
I didn't have certainly any protections like that

5024
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
People think that

5025
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
This is a problem that just doesn't affect just acting

5026
02:49:57,000 --> 02:50:00,000
But any career where there's some sort of artistic end to it

5027
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:03,000
They think because you get some sort of satisfaction out of it

5028
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
That it's okay

5029
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
Or it's not a big deal

5030
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
Well yeah, it's not okay if you scream once

5031
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
But if you scream for four hours

5032
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
You can ruin your instrument

5033
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
And video games

5034
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
For actors it can be

5035
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
One of the most rewarding

5036
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
Because of the amount of dialogue

5037
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:24,000
And story can also be one of the most grueling

5038
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
But you know

5039
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
On the money thing

5040
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
Regardless of the specifics

5041
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
People deserve to be compensated

5042
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
Fairly for their time

5043
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
No matter what their job is

5044
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
Of course

5045
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
This also goes out to all my friends

5046
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
That are graphic designers

5047
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
People that work in fields

5048
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
That involve computers

5049
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
Or musicians or photographers

5050
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
Where people go

5051
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
My nephew is good with computers

5052
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
So I'll just have them do it

5053
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
You want things done right

5054
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
You need skilled, hardworking people

5055
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
And I've heard most often

5056
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
The argument about how

5057
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
Certain sides of the video game industry

5058
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
Aren't fairly compensated

5059
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
Well everybody should be then

5060
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
I know what to tell you

5061
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
There's a lot of people

5062
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
There's a lot of people out there that say

5063
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
Well if the voice actors just go on strike

5064
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
And do it for free

5065
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000
But you are right in that regard

5066
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
That well you'll get what you pay for

5067
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
And we'll be back in the era of 90's CD-ROM games

5068
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
When the acting wasn't quite what it is today

5069
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
If that makes sense

5070
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
Well you know that's

5071
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000
That's kind of affected

5072
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,000
The industry as a whole

5073
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,000
I mean again it's not just voice acting

5074
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,000
That's been affected by this proliferation of

5075
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,000
Competition for jobs on the internet

5076
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
And driving down of prices

5077
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,000
But you know that aside

5078
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,000
It is interesting when I see people that say that

5079
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:48,000
Well I'll just do it for really cheap

5080
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:50,000
And then I'm going to get this great exposure

5081
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:52,000
And this great gig

5082
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
Well that's wonderful but

5083
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,000
That sustaining career that you want

5084
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:58,000
Isn't going to be there for you then

5085
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:00,000
At the end of the day

5086
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:02,000
So you're like

5087
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,000
Oh I'll do this thing really cheap right now

5088
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,000
And that's going to give me all the exposure I need

5089
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
And that's going to skyrocket me to the top

5090
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
When I'm going to do what I love for a living

5091
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
But if you do that then that career isn't going to exist

5092
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:14,000
Well I hope they can

5093
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,000
I hope they can all work it out

5094
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,000
I hope they can hug it out

5095
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:20,000
And figure this stuff out

5096
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,000
And you have some support in chat

5097
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
In our chatroom over at live.fognetwork.com

5098
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
I'm definitely with Marissa on this one

5099
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,000
And Dungeon Buster says that could be the future

5100
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,000
Without skilled voice actors

5101
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,000
Not even the 90's look up

5102
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:34,000
Chaos Wars voice acting on Google or YouTube

5103
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:36,000
Classic 90's bad acting

5104
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:38,000
Resident Evil nuff said says Raginator

5105
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:40,000
Anyway

5106
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:42,000
You know what? This is easy

5107
02:52:42,000 --> 02:52:44,000
So you deserve to be played less

5108
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:46,000
Yeah but I

5109
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:48,000
I mentioned this last week on the show

5110
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
When I've done Rocky Horror and emceed that show

5111
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
And I'm on stage for maybe 20-30 minutes

5112
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:54,000
And I'm kind of yelling

5113
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:56,000
Then I come in

5114
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,000
By the way I have a show I should plug this

5115
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:00,000
Because I didn't earlier

5116
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:02,000
But for those that do happen to be local here in Sacramento

5117
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:04,000
I am going to be hosting Rocky Horror at the Colonial

5118
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:06,000
On Saturday at I think 10.30 pm

5119
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:08,000
As part of the 9th annual Sacramento Horror Film Festival

5120
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,000
I've been fortunate enough to be asked back to do that

5121
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:12,000
But when I come in here next week

5122
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:14,000
You guys should fully expect

5123
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,000
Hi everybody this is Rob Roberts

5124
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:18,000
Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio

5125
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,000
I just smoked four packs and came on air

5126
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:22,000
That's what it's going to be

5127
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:24,000
Yeah and sometimes you know

5128
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,000
This can be complete BS

5129
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:28,000
But to me it always seems that

5130
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:30,000
When I run my voice ragged

5131
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:32,000
It makes me more vulnerable to sickness

5132
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:34,000
Yeah and I'm worried about that

5133
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,000
Because there's something going around

5134
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
Anytime you wear your body down

5135
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:40,000
You're making it more vulnerable to sickness

5136
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:42,000
Anyway Marissa I hate to do this

5137
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:44,000
But I got to wrap up so we can wrap up the show

5138
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:46,000
Because we're running a little long

5139
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,000
Thank you so much for the call

5140
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:50,000
It's always good to hear from you

5141
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:52,000
Alright take care

5142
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:54,000
Alright I think that is actually going to do it for the skype line tonight

5143
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:56,000
Because I know Jamie wants to go get pie

5144
02:53:56,000 --> 02:53:58,000
And I have some other things I want to take care of around here

5145
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:00,000
We are after midnight on the east coast

5146
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:02,000
So I want to go ahead and move to wrap things up

5147
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:04,000
But I do want to check in and make sure

5148
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:06,000
Are there any last minute stories or things we want to bring up here?

5149
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,000
Crowdfunding started for them's fighting herds

5150
02:54:08,000 --> 02:54:10,000
So if you want to back that

5151
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:12,000
You can check that out on Indiegogo

5152
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:14,000
That's right I remember hearing about that a couple weeks ago

5153
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:16,000
They're already at about

5154
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:18,000
Just over halfway

5155
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:20,000
About 200,000 from goal

5156
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:22,000
With 17 days left

5157
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:24,000
Nice

5158
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:26,000
Alright

5159
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:28,000
If that's it for last minute stories

5160
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:30,000
There was one other thing I saw

5161
02:54:30,000 --> 02:54:32,000
They have more

5162
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:34,000
They have more footage

5163
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:36,000
Of an unreleased Nintendo 64 game

5164
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:38,000
It was a sequel to the Neo Geo

5165
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:40,000
Shooter Viewpoint

5166
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:42,000
Called Viewpoint 2064

5167
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:44,000
Yeah

5168
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:46,000
It's kind of random

5169
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:48,000
I guess it was from a prototype

5170
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:50,000
Cartridge that someone bought on eBay

5171
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,000
I'm liking all these

5172
02:54:52,000 --> 02:54:54,000
Unreleased games

5173
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:56,000
Unearthed prototypes

5174
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:58,000
It's always kind of fun to see what we might have missed out on

5175
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:00,000
Alright

5176
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:02,000
Well we're going to wind down here for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio

5177
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:04,000
But hey I want to really thank you guys

5178
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:06,000
For tuning in and listening to our show

5179
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:08,000
Whether it be live or in the podcast forum

5180
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:10,000
We really appreciate it

5181
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:12,000
And thank you guys so much for participating

5182
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:14,000
If you liked what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio

5183
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:16,000
Please consider telling a friend or two

5184
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:18,000
About the show because word of mouth is really all we have

5185
02:55:18,000 --> 02:55:20,000
We'd appreciate a tweet

5186
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:22,000
You want to tweet? Hey guys listen to OLR

5187
02:55:22,000 --> 02:55:24,000
We would love that so much, thank you so much

5188
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:26,000
And a five star review

5189
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:28,000
On iTunes or Stitcher Radio

5190
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,000
I know all your favorite podcasts ask you

5191
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:32,000
But we're all asking you for a reason

5192
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:34,000
Because it goes a long way

5193
02:55:34,000 --> 02:55:36,000
So we really appreciate that

5194
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:38,000
And that is going to bring us to a close

5195
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:40,000
Here at another week of Orange Lounge Radio

5196
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,000
Great show tonight everybody

5197
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:44,000
Thank you Steve-O from Jackbox Games

5198
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:46,000
For coming on the show tonight

5199
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:48,000
And I want to thank Evan over at Jackbox Games

5200
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,000
For helping to arrange that

5201
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:52,000
So thank you very much

5202
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:54,000
Big thanks to Jackbox Games

5203
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:56,000
For supporting the show

5204
02:55:56,000 --> 02:55:58,000
Best of luck with Jackbox Party Pack 2

5205
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:00,000
I know I will be there checking that out

5206
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:02,000
As will I'm sure most of us here in studio

5207
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:04,000
And our listenership out there

5208
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:06,000
So it's time to go around

5209
02:56:06,000 --> 02:56:08,000
And get everybody's final thought

5210
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:10,000
Tonight here on the show

5211
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:12,000
Darce Agro we haven't heard from you in a little bit

5212
02:56:12,000 --> 02:56:14,000
We'll start with you, what's your final thought here tonight?

5213
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:16,000
I'm Mrs. Marissa

5214
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:18,000
Me too, I haven't been to Southern California

5215
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:20,000
In a long time

5216
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:22,000
Let's just go, except I feel depressed going down

5217
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:24,000
And also not going to Disneyland

5218
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
It's that whole new job time off thing

5219
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:28,000
I can't get time off until December

5220
02:56:30,000 --> 02:56:32,000
Let's all just meet up at the Bravo Cheese Farm

5221
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:34,000
There you go, meet halfway

5222
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:36,000
Alright

5223
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:38,000
Let's see, my final thought tonight

5224
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:40,000
I want to wish a happy early

5225
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:42,000
500th episode of Bobby Black Wolf

5226
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:44,000
Because next week is his 500th episode

5227
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:46,000
So tonight was $4.99

5228
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:48,000
And I just want to make sure I did not forget

5229
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:50,000
To give him his kudos where it's due

5230
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:52,000
Bobby Black Wolf is

5231
02:56:52,000 --> 02:56:54,000
A big reason why O.L.R. is still going

5232
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:56,000
After all these years because there was a period of time

5233
02:56:56,000 --> 02:56:58,000
Where we were going to

5234
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:00,000
Not be a live show anymore

5235
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:02,000
And Bobby helped save that

5236
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:04,000
So we were able to do live

5237
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:06,000
We were going to be a dead show

5238
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,000
I don't know if we were going to be dead

5239
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:10,000
But it would just be a very different show

5240
02:57:10,000 --> 02:57:12,000
So thank you Bobby for keeping it live

5241
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:14,000
Congrats to the discipline it's taken you

5242
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:16,000
To get all the way to 500 episodes

5243
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:18,000
Last but not least, Loki

5244
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:20,000
Your final thought tonight

5245
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:22,000
I don't know

5246
02:57:22,000 --> 02:57:24,000
I'm thinking

5247
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:26,000
I'm at that awkward point where you decide whether or not

5248
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:28,000
You're going to make a costume for Halloween

5249
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:30,000
And you know instead

5250
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:32,000
Much like my game project

5251
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:34,000
Instead of doing something simple

5252
02:57:34,000 --> 02:57:36,000
It's either extremely complicated or nothing

5253
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:38,000
In the wise words of one

5254
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:40,000
Shia LaBeouf

5255
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:42,000
Do it!

5256
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:44,000
Just do it!

5257
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:46,000
So I guess we're being

5258
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:48,000
Listened to by Becky and Julian

5259
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:50,000
Oh are we?

5260
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:52,000
If Mother approves

5261
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:54,000
Because sometimes we get a little R-rated

5262
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:56,000
But I guess we can watch our F and Mals

5263
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,000
While Julian's here

5264
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:00,000
We can try

5265
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:02,000
There you go, so we'll try

5266
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:04,000
Well I have to know, what game is Julian going to talk about?

5267
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:06,000
Probably Pirates 101 and Lego something

5268
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:08,000
That's fine, oh is he playing that new Lego game too?

5269
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:10,000
No I don't think Dimensions

5270
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:12,000
We should do a show

5271
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:14,000
Where we can bring the kids on

5272
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:16,000
My son would love to talk about Minecraft

5273
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:18,000
Or whatever it is, the Lego game

5274
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:20,000
Bring your kid to OLR

5275
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:22,000
It's just like, alright let's do it

5276
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:24,000
You know what, I just say

5277
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:26,000
Maybe for April Fools next year we'll just let them host

5278
02:58:28,000 --> 02:58:30,000
He gets kind of shy so

5279
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:32,000
I don't know, we'll see

5280
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:34,000
That would be funny

5281
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:36,000
I think the listeners would love that

5282
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:38,000
I think they would love that, so we'll have to make that happen

5283
02:58:38,000 --> 02:58:40,000
In a few weeks, so there you go

5284
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:42,000
S2100Matt says if we've done a drunk show

5285
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:44,000
We could do a kids show

5286
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:46,000
And ActDef says, OLR

5287
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:48,000
Kid tested, mother approved

5288
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:50,000
I think I just got another text

5289
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:52,000
Just open that up with the themes from Wonder Shows

5290
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:54,000
So we get

5291
02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:56,000
LOL Minecraft

5292
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:58,000
You know what, you can never talk enough Minecraft

5293
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:00,000
So now I have to go over to Becky's and have a cookie

5294
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:02,000
Alright sounds good, have two cookies

5295
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:04,000
One for me

5296
02:59:04,000 --> 02:59:06,000
That's going to do it, thank you guys so much

5297
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:08,000
For listening to Orange Lounge Radio

5298
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:10,000
And supporting independent broadcasting

5299
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:12,000
We'll be back to do it again in seven days

5300
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:14,000
We'll see you then, have a great week everybody

5301
02:59:14,000 --> 02:59:16,000
Good night

5302
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:44,000
See you next week

5303
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:14,000
Thanks for watching!
