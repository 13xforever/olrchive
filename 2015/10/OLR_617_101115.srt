Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Who's the host? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Tonight October 11th, 2015, it looks like the marketplace of downloadable content may be evolving, from streaming content in Guitar Hero to insurance in Metal Gear Solid.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We discuss these new directions with our participants next, live on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio. Tonight with episode number 617 for this October the 11th of 2015.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We are here assembled in Sacramento, California, Studio N7 to talk about the latest and greatest in gaming along with you guys in our chat room.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:05,000
My name is Rob Roberts, also known as Skie on Twitter, S-K-I-E, and joining me at my side as she often is, except for those times she's not, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Murgle, Murgle.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What was that, the character in Bravely Default? Oh, I said Murg-er-gerger.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I don't know, I was just thinking of the Murlocs and, wow.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I've been going around just saying that randomly because it sounds funny.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah, it's great. So, before the show we were doing a little bit of snack time, which we usually do.

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh my god.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's 6 o'clock on the west coast, right? It's a little bit snack time. It depends on if we decide to eat dinner before or after the show.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Usually Loki is before DarkSakura, or during really, let's be real. DarkSakura and I are after, so we'll have a little snack to hold us over.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And, because I was at Trader Joe's yesterday, not to give them a free plug, but I guess I did.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
They have pumpkin everything this time of year. Everything pumpkin this time of year.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And so I had Jamie try, she didn't know what it was, and I said, here Jamie, eat this.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
And she's like, okay. And it was a pumpkin flavored tortilla chip.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And the first, the reaction she made when she was eating it was very strange, and I showed her the bag, she's like, give it to me now.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It took like a whole handful.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It was really good.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
They are good, aren't they?

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Well, I wanted something, it's a little salty, and I like sweet and salty things. I mean, hence me eating up almost all of your kettle corn.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But, it's so good.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah.

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah, actdef said sky is so white, he turns orange in October.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's true.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yeah, Rob turns into Bob Barker.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That is true.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Acknowledging our chat room, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And yeah, actdef saying that I turn orange in October.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You know, true story, my parents had to take me to the hospital when I was two years old because my face turned orange.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
How many carrots were you eating?

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And that's exactly what it was, it was because my favorite thing to eat when I was a kid was carrots.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And of course, my parents are like, carrots aren't what, letting me eat carrots is better than sugar, right?

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Did you know that that happened to Susan Day?

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Really?

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
From the Partridge family?

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I did not.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Wasn't she the ginger? Is it a thing about being ginger and eating that? I don't know.

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
No, she had gone on like some anorexic kick.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And was eating nothing but carrots and turned orange.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Wow.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yeah. How's that for your bit of trivia?

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
There you go. So maybe that ties into the pumpkin thing, I don't know.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Okay, I need to-

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Alan says that you have pumpkin cranberry pita chips.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I do have pumpkin-

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And you need to give them to me now.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Alright, well after-

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I want it now!

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm gonna play the cruelest joke ever on Dark Soccer.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
They're in that cabinet on the very top shelf just out of reach for you.

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Dark Soccer. Oh, this is the one time I wish we had video.

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Dark Soccer is getting on her tippy toes and-

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh my god! What'd you break in there?

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh my god, I wish you guys could have seen that. She literally jumped to grab the bag of pumpkin-

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Never underestimate the resourcefulness of a short person.

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Alright.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Listen to this. I'm having the- Rob, I'm stealing your food.

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Thanks. Thank you, Alan. Love you. Mean it.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Alright. Look.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Could you guys hear when, like, she just knocked the toaster pan over or something? I don't know. Anyway.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Alright. Also, make sure you're not crinkling the bag near the mic, though.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Okay. Also joining us tonight, of course, say hello-

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And he's running in and out of here, too. I got people running around the house crazy.

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Sorry.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You have a ton of amiibo.

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes.

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
A ton of them I had to scan into Mario Maker, so I don't have to unlock the stupid costumes.

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So, yes. My amiibo collection has gotten disgusting. It has gotten absolu-

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's a little large.

79
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Now that they're easy to find, or easier, let's say much easier to find, and I mentioned this before,

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Shane has that kind of unhealthy obsession right now with searching for toys.

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Like, he's helped me in getting all these different amiibo.

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So, yeah. Just today, I bought a Charizard and a Pikachu so I could have every Pokemon,

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
because I have Jigglypuff on order, shipping to a local target, and I'll have every Pokemon.

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Well, I've got them all scanned now.

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Did you? You scanned them all into Mario Maker?

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I scanned them all into Mario Maker.

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
How many was that?

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I don't even know. A lot.

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I went from, like, having almost- Well, I had quite a few. I finished, you know, playing the easy mode.

90
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
They won't give me any more unlocks, so I have at least 30 there, and then I have to play normal mode now.

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But, yeah. That was at least 30 more, probably.

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Nice. Yeah, I have a lot of amiibo. I'm a little embarrassed.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And then, of course, I gotta fire up Splatoon to unlock the costumes and that, too.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Oh, there you go.

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Wish they would do that with other characters. I mean, like a hat or a t-shirt or something, but no.

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's just that game.

97
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
All right. Let's see. We're gonna kick off with a kickoff topic tonight.

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I do wanna, again, welcome everybody to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm just reading through some of the comments.

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Dark Tetsuya is saying, Rob should rent out his collection for people like me that need them for Mario Maker.

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Just bring your Wii U over. Do what Loki's doing.

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He doesn't even have the Wii U running, except on the gamepad, because you don't need to for Mario Maker.

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
So he's just tapping them all on the gamepad. You're welcome.

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You know, I actually played more games this week.

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Did you? Well, get to gaming weeks very soon. I promise.

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm just very proud of myself.

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
For playing a lot of games this week?

108
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
For playing other stuff.

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I played a lot as well this week.

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Outside of the usual.

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You're really enjoying those pumpkin cranberry things, aren't you?

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I might have to leave and change.

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Bobby Blackwolf says, I'm gonna fly to Sacramento and put my Wii U and my carry on.

114
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You should, Bobby. You should.

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And I'll let you borrow the collection for free in celebration of your 500th episode.

116
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And that gives me an excuse to let our listeners know, if you weren't already aware of our pal Bobby Blackwolf,

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
who does the show before us here at VOG, he hit 500 episodes this evening.

118
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That is quite a milestone.

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And we've been on a neighboring time slot for, what, like 400 of those episodes?

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Easy. So, for a very long time we've been working with Bobby Blackwolf.

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And it just wouldn't be Sunday nights without him.

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So, congratulations on 500 episodes.

123
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And we'll see how far we're gonna take this block of programming.

124
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Anyhow, let's get to our kickoff topic tonight.

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
So, shifting topics here. I want to talk about music games.

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I want to talk about Rock Band 4 came out this week.

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And usually I would get into this in my gaming week.

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But I feel like this kind of necessitates a little bit of top of the show discussion.

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Because I'm gonna talk about Guitar Hero Live as well and some of the things they're doing with DLC.

130
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
If you aren't already aware of it.

131
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So, this is the big year that music games that have been gone for a long time are making their comeback.

132
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And so, like many of you, I've picked up Rock Band 4.

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
And I picked up Rock Band 4 on the Xbox One.

134
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And the reason why I chose Xbox One is because my disgusting amount of rock band songs were on the Xbox 360.

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
And Harmonix has been advertising that those songs are going to import over.

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
They're gonna come over from the 360 to the One.

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Well, as to be expected with a lot of launch type situations.

138
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The Xbox One and Xbox 360 transfer situation is a little bit borked right now.

139
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Meaning that when I go into Rock Band 4 and look at the library of songs to purchase.

140
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
There's some songs that I've purchased already that show available for free.

141
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But there's others that aren't recognized.

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
And it can even, there seems to be no rhyme or reason.

143
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Like I was like, is it the oldest stuff I've bought? Or what is coming in and what's not?

144
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And like for example, I bought the Best of No Doubt album when it was available in Rock Band.

145
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And like half the songs will come in and half won't.

146
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And you guys have probably already heard that Rock Band 4 is having issues with...

147
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
They do not yet have the export available for Rock Band, Rock Band 2 or Rock Band 3.

148
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Or I'm assuming Lego Rock Band will be a part of that at some point.

149
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Remember that was a thing that had its own soundtrack.

150
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah, I remember just getting that just to download the songs.

151
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
These are all songs I was expecting to play on my Xbox One and I can't.

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
So I have to admit, I'm a little bit disappointed.

153
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I assume that they're rushing to meet some type of deadline, which I get it.

154
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The holidays are coming up, especially with the plastic instruments and everything.

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But I do feel like something big was promised to me that motivate my purchase on the Xbox One that hasn't been delivered.

156
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And I have to call Harmonics out on that. That's not really acceptable to me.

157
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And I really hope this situation gets fixed pretty quickly in the coming month or so.

158
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
As for the game itself, Rock Band is a phenomenal game.

159
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Rock Band has always been one of the greatest music game franchises.

160
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And is the reason why we have a ton of plastic instruments in our house.

161
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I mean obviously Guitar Hero is a huge part of that too.

162
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But you guys all know Harmonics did Guitar Hero 1 and 2 and then they went on to make Rock Band.

163
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So in many ways, Rock Band is kind of the spiritual successor to the original Guitar Hero games, right?

164
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So I was really excited about Rock Band 4 going into next gen.

165
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Because it's like, okay, this series has been gone for a few years.

166
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Let's see what's going to happen with this game.

167
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yeah, we were like imagining, oh man, when they bring it back it's going to be something amazing.

168
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yeah, with the new graphics and everything.

169
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So I have to admit, I'm kind of disappointed that Rock Band 4 is a step backwards for the series.

170
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Rock Band 4 is not a bad game, but it's not as good as Rock Band 3.

171
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's about the same level as Rock Band 2.

172
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And you would expect that when a game is moving on to a new console like that, that you would not lose a lot of features.

173
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And this isn't just about the keyboard thing, although I truly have a hard time understanding why they couldn't put the keyboards in the game.

174
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I don't understand if they're having the whole compatibility switch thing and the note charts are already in for these songs you supposedly already own.

175
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm having a little bit of a hard time understanding that struggle, but I'm going to let the game have a pass on that,

176
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
as disappointed as I am personally about the lack of keyboards.

177
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But I'm just talking about customization options blow compared to what was there in 3.

178
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You have very limited customization options.

179
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I think the harmony parts for singing are gone. I think it's just the singular stuff.

180
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It just feels scaled back.

181
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And I have to admit, then it makes me go, is this game kind of a cash-in?

182
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Was this to pay the light bills so that they can finish making Amplitude and some of these other pet projects that they have going on right now?

183
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm sorry to be so, I don't know, pointed or cynical gamer in what I'm saying, but this was my honest reaction when I started playing Rock Band 4.

184
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I was like, this really doesn't feel like it was worth a five year wait.

185
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Now, if you've never owned a Rock Band game before, maybe you were 17 when the first series came out.

186
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Now you're in your early 20s and you have the disposable income for it.

187
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Rock Band 4 is a fine first purchase to get into the franchise. There's nothing super wrong with it.

188
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm just saying, Rock Band 3 is honestly a better game, with the exception of the fact that whatever these new songs are in 4,

189
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
you wouldn't be able to pull into 3, but it's not that big of a loss all things considered.

190
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Bobby Black Wolf is saying that the harmonies are still there, so he doesn't want me to get corrected there.

191
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I made the same assumption but was proven wrong. I apologize, I didn't see that in the whole...

192
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And I think part of that, here's why I kind of made that assumption, is that I think I've been spoiled by Sing Star a little bit.

193
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Because I don't know if you guys know this, Sing Star ditched the microphones completely, and now you can actually do your singing through a cell phone app.

194
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Sing Star is a completely free thing now on PlayStation. You download the shell, you download the app to your phone, and you just pay for whatever songs you want to have.

195
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And I just kind of thought, after a five or six year wait, I kind of thought Rock Band would kind of get on that as well.

196
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Remember, they tried that with the PSP version. They had the free demo version that you could download.

197
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That's right. And that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the cell phone microphone and the fact that you don't even need one anymore.

198
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And then that way, how easy would it be to have three people on their smartphones?

199
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I mean, just last week on the show, we had Jackbox on, and they've made this their thing, is creating these games that many people play with their smartphones.

200
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And that's kind of where things are going now, is that interaction. I was surprised that in that sense, the technology didn't take a step forward in Rock Band.

201
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So, I don't know.

202
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
ActDeft in chat says, Sky, they should be available for free, even if they appear not bought.

203
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I tried selecting a few of them, and it still wanted me to purchase them. So, I don't, you know.

204
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And plus, the whole thing is a little clunky. Especially if being able to import your old songs was a selling point of the game, shouldn't there be a section of the store that's just view purchased items?

205
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Is that really hard? Why did we have to not have that in there? I don't understand.

206
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Again, I know I sound like I'm being really, really critical of Rock Band, but just as somebody who is expecting to be blown away, I wasn't.

207
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I was just like, oh, this is a very status quo game. In fact, it's actually a little bit of a step backwards from Rock Band 3.

208
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So, sorry, that's just kind of how I felt. But, you know, again, if you've never owned a Rock Band game, there's nothing wrong with starting with Rock Band 4, especially if you happen to have an Xbox One or PlayStation 4.

209
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:08,000
But don't buy a console just for the game. Buy a console because there's many other great games to play as well, and Rock Band will be one of those games.

210
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Kaijuto in chat says, why sorry for how you feel? I don't know because sometimes I don't like to be that cynical gamer that's kind of hating on things.

211
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I want to make sure it's understood that when I'm critical, especially music games, I have a soft spot for music games.

212
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I think because this show started with DDR and the music-based games, maybe I feel some sort of loyalty to music games or what have you.

213
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:44,000
So, you know, when I am critical of a game, I almost kind of feel bad because I want to see music games succeed and I want to see them be successful.

214
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
So it's a little frustrating to me when Rock Band takes a step backwards because I go, this is going to kill the franchise.

215
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Surely I can't be the only one that's noticing this about the game. This is going to kill the franchise for good.

216
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And this is very disappointing because you want to see it do better. So I don't know.

217
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:07,000
That's kind of why I apologize a little bit because I don't want to say negative things about it because I want the series to do well, but that's what it is.

218
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, same here about the music game loyalty. That's why whenever there's like a new 2DX on test, I make sure you guys all know about it.

219
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
One other thing I want to talk about in our kickoff topic tonight was the DLC in Guitar Hero.

220
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I don't know if you guys have heard about this. Guitar Hero is doing something a little different with their DLC.

221
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Guitar Hero, you've heard about these streaming channels, right? That you're going to be able to like, it's like playing Guitar Hero to MTV.

222
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Well, you can play that all fine and dandy, but there will be a currency that you earn as you play through these streaming channels and you can use that currency to play songs on demand.

223
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:55,000
But you're never actually purchasing the song, you're just purchasing it on demand to play whatever song it is you want.

224
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
This is very similar to how some mobile-based music games work.

225
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Now, this means you're not downloading the song and owning it on your console anymore. That's not happening.

226
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:15,000
So, you know, and that's a little weird at first when we talk about DLC. It's like, shouldn't I own everything that I'm kind of paying the money for?

227
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But then I think about, how many songs in Rock Band did I buy to just play one or two times and I never went back and played them again?

228
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
And I think you guys have all done this at some point, right? So, in a way, I'm kind of like, well, maybe the token thing makes sense.

229
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And they talked about in the open letter about how, you know, it's, well, you know, we get a lot of our music through Spotify and Apple Music now, so we wanted to try something that seemed a little more subscription-based.

230
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And I guess there's like a party pack thing you can buy, where like for 48 hours or something, you basically have unlimited access to the on-demand.

231
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So if you're going to have people come over, you can basically just own every song in the game for a certain amount of time.

232
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I have to admit, I don't want to like this idea, but I'm kind of open to it to see how it works.

233
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You know, again, the way we hear about things isn't always the way it plays out, as I just described with the Rock Band music and importing.

234
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
But if it's going to work on, you know, in practice the way they're describing it, I'm open to it. I don't know.

235
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But I know it's controversial, because Kaijuto in chat says, over at live.vognetwork.com, fuck that idea, I don't like it.

236
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And I don't think he's alone in what he's saying with that. What do you guys think about what you're hearing about the Guitar Hero change there? Loki?

237
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I don't know. I mean, I like the idea of like the single-player game, but the DLC thing is just... I don't know.

238
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I don't know if I'd pay for that, because I'm not really on board with the whole Spotify thing. I mean, I just don't do that.

239
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I listen to the music I want to listen to, and that's it. If I want to discover something, I will find other means to do that.

240
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
So, it just doesn't seem like it would appeal to me.

241
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I see, and maybe I'm just different, because I am a Spotify person that I'm open to with the idea.

242
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Well, I'd have to see what kind of music is on there. I mean, that's the other thing, too.

243
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
And here's the thing, though, but I totally understand. This is a very slippery slope.

244
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:10,000
But, with that being said, if they had a DJ Hero game with this, then that would be a different story. I would probably be on board with that.

245
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I think I'm actually in complete agreement for once with Mookie.

246
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Well, actually, if they just had a DJ Hero game, I'd be totally on board with that.

247
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But just don't let the people that touch, you know, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 5, they can't go in the same building with that game.

248
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Tigerclaw in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com points out, plus you have to be online to play this music.

249
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
What if you don't want to be online to play a song? I mean, you have to be online to download it.

250
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:52,000
But I have totally seen that case where you download the songs, then you take your thing to a convention or something where you may not have reliable internet, but you still have all your songs you can play.

251
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
So that's certainly another downside to this tactic as well.

252
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I want to welcome to the show, joining us a little late tonight, he's tardy, but that's okay.

253
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Welcome everybody, a friend of the show who comes on quite frequently, say hello to Shane.

254
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Hi.

255
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Hi.

256
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Hi.

257
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
How are you?

258
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Tired.

259
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Tired? Did you wake up from a nap and that's why you're late?

260
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Like, three hour nap.

261
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I got you.

262
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Naps are the best.

263
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You missed Loki running back and forth.

264
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:25,000
No, I heard about it on the way here. I was like, if I would have known, I would have brought my different amiibo that you don't have, like my Fire Emblem guys and stuff like that.

265
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yeah, I don't have everything that Shane has. He has some extra ones, but we'll get that next time. Sound good? Alright.

266
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Shane, what do you think of all that? You're a long time music game fan. What do you think of where Guitar Hero is going with the DLC?

267
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
If you can liken it to something like Apple Music, then I'm fine with it because I love that service.

268
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:50,000
So, whatever, but again, just to reiterate what's been said here, I just want DJ Hero. I don't care about Guitar Hero.

269
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Amen.

270
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Very interesting. It seems like we're all united. I would agree. I would be much more excited about a new DJ Hero game than Guitar Hero game.

271
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
We saw DJ Hero today. Was that today? I think it was.

272
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Yeah, it was. It was in the Xbox 360 section of Toys R Us. Because, you know, I'm thinking like, oh, backwards compatibility. Maybe there's some 360 games I want to pick up again.

273
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And then I saw DJ Hero and obviously that's not, you know, with the peripheral and everything, I'm not expecting that to be backwards compatible, but I was like, oh, look, Shane.

274
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I know, it was sad.

275
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I was like, here's a great Xbox 360 game and then I saw Mass Effect 2 and I'm like, here's the best Xbox 360 game. So, anyway.

276
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I didn't say anything.

277
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You mean PC game.

278
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Whatever. Alright, before we get into our gaming weeks, since Shane is here and I don't have any place to talk about this on the show rule otherwise, well, first off, how have you been since the last time we had you on the show, Shane?

279
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I've been.

280
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You've been, I was talking about this on last week's show. I don't know if you heard it or not, but I was talking about your toy obsession.

281
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Yeah, you make it sound like a bad thing. You made it sound like a bad thing today, too.

282
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Do you wish to state, would you like to clarify what your thing is?

283
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I just like Power Ranger toys and I want to finish this series before the new ones come out in November. I'm three away.

284
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
And toy collecting is a pretty big thing.

285
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Yeah, it's fun. It's like hunting.

286
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
You said you're always running into Star Wars people.

287
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Yeah, but I don't understand what they're doing.

288
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
No, I'm not saying in a bad way. I just don't understand Star Wars. Like, they wouldn't understand Power Rangers.

289
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You don't know the characters they're looking for and all that stuff.

290
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
No.

291
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
But it's kind of similar to amiibo hunting, what you're doing, right?

292
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yes, and that's what I fall back on. If I don't find a Power Ranger, well, maybe I'll find an amiibo.

293
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Now, I know there's like three characters you're desperately looking for. Do you want to put a shout out here for people to tweet you if they find them?

294
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:44,000
As long as they don't pay, or as long as they're not scalping them for $25 to $30 a pop.

295
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Because you don't support scalpers.

296
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
No, I don't support scalpers.

297
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
What is it you're looking for?

298
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'm looking for Sting Rage, Spellbinder, and Vivizord.

299
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
So they're like villains, right?

300
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Yeah, they're just villains.

301
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Okay.

302
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
That's it, and then I'm done until November when it all starts up again.

303
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
But you're going to go to Power Morphicon and probably spend a lot more money, right?

304
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yes. Oh my god, I can't wait for Power Morphicon.

305
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Are you excited for the movie?

306
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Now I am, since it sounds like it's not a reboot of the original series.

307
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
William Murderface in chat says,

308
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Shane, what do you think about Dino Charge? I know where this is going.

309
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Oh my god, it's the best. I love it.

310
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I have so many good feelings towards that series.

311
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Is it your favorite series?

312
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Yes, right now it is.

313
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It beats SPD, it's on par with RPM, but I think it's going to surpass RPM because RPM didn't have Riley and Chase.

314
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Until you started talking more about your Power Rangers obsession and doing this toy hunting thing,

315
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I really never realized that there were all different seasons.

316
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I thought they just kept recasting the original Rangers.

317
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
No, that's terrible.

318
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I thought Rita Repulsa was still the villain.

319
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
No.

320
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Rob.

321
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I had no idea about any of this stuff.

322
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Well, you knew the Japanese series were all individual series, right?

323
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I know the Japanese, yeah, it's all from Japan.

324
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
But they were different series every season. They're from the get-go.

325
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I know that now.

326
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
But also, nothing is better than the Mega Ranger vs. Car Ranger movie.

327
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
He made me watch the trains from Japan, which they'll probably never have here.

328
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I thought it was a cute thing, what I was watching.

329
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I can't get obsessed with it like Shane does, but whatever.

330
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I also super love Maji Ranger.

331
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Okay.

332
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
That's Harry Potter.

333
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
AKA Harry Potter Rangers.

334
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Alright, I'm gonna entertain one more Power Rangers question here for Shane.

335
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Why, let's just talk about this for an hour.

336
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
What about Time Force, Shane?

337
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Shane, we should do a podcast.

338
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Time Force is really good.

339
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I want to do a podcast.

340
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Let's do one about Power Rangers.

341
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
But Time Force is really good. Time Rangers even better.

342
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
But again, Riley and Chase aren't on that season, so I don't know what to tell you.

343
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Alright, another thing you've been obsessed with as of late.

344
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,000
You want to talk about a particular PlayStation 4 game that you are in love with, right Shane?

345
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Is it not on the show roll?

346
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
No, I forgot to put it on there.

347
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
We'll put it on there so I don't...

348
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Oh, here it is.

349
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
We're talking about it right on top of the show.

350
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Oh my gosh, but it had a story.

351
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I know.

352
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
What game do you love on PlayStation 4?

353
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Until Dawn.

354
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Yeah?

355
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
It's the best.

356
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
It's gonna be my number one.

357
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
It beat out... everybody's gone to the rapture.

358
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Until Dawn.

359
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Like, I watched so many Twitch streams of it.

360
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I just... I love that game.

361
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
What is it about the game that you love?

362
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
It's like a choose your own adventure book, but with killing and monsters.

363
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And sometimes there may be a hook that goes through your jaw.

364
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Or maybe your eyes get gouged out.

365
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
That's why I can't play it.

366
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
It's so good.

367
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
And now that there's gonna be a second one, I'm even more excited.

368
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Well, and that is the news, is that...

369
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Well, they didn't confirm a second one is happening.

370
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
It sold better than expectations, which I'm sure they expected four copies.

371
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
They said this week it sold better than expectations.

372
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And even, you know, Yoshida had said a few months, or a couple weeks ago, I think it was,

373
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
that he said that, you know, they didn't really advertise it a lot and it's been selling well.

374
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
No, they didn't.

375
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And so, over at the developers, they're talking about what they could do for a sequel.

376
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I mean, if they can make it canon that everybody lives, and I mean everybody without spoiling it,

377
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
you could easily set it up for a sequel with a couple of the same characters, at least.

378
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Well, could they do something, though, where it's just, you know,

379
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,000
and again, I'm trying to be very delicate with spoilers here,

380
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
so could they take the mythology of the game, we'll just say that,

381
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
and maybe with a new cast?

382
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I don't think that would be as good, because, I mean, well, technically,

383
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I don't even, I guess, want a real sequel, because the payoff for the game,

384
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,000
besides it being just amazing overall, is finding out, like, the big twist about what's going on,

385
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
and so you're going into the game with a new cast where they don't know what's going on,

386
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
but you would already know at the start what's going on, so that's not as fun.

387
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Well, with horror movies, though, the cast rarely come back for the sequel.

388
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I mean, you might have one or two, like, you know, Jamie Lee Curtis was in the first couple Halloween movies.

389
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Besides, they had to have a survivor that ends up becoming the new villain, or so.

390
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Yeah.

391
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I won't say anything about that.

392
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
I mean, it's just a trope.

393
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
All right.

394
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Well, let's talk more about Power Rangers.

395
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Well, I will say, William Murderface in chat is saying,

396
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I would totally be up for a Sentai Power Rangers podcast, even add in Common Rider, which is also wrapped.

397
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Yes, they just started a new one, and I started watching it, and it's pretty...

398
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I don't know, it's only been one episode that I've seen so far, and I don't know how I feel about it,

399
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
but I'm going to start it from the start and finish it, because it's a neat motif.

400
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
All right. Well, if people want to tweet you support to start a Power Rangers podcast,

401
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
which, you know, just saying, would actually be a pretty cool addition to VOG, wink, wink,

402
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
tweet Shane at Shane Alinko.

403
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,000
You know, but I have to warn you, it's mostly going to be me talking about Chase and Riley and how much I love that.

404
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
There's probably people that would be just fine with that, to be honest.

405
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Yeah, there would be.

406
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
All right.

407
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
All right.

408
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
And Dark Soccer maybe wants to get in on that podcast as well.

409
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I'd have to catch up on stuff, because honestly, my favorite ever is Mega Ranger.

410
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yeah.

411
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And there will be nothing better than Mega Ranger.

412
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Well, maybe, okay, just to help you see, this is what I do. I produce shows, right?

413
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Is this your hero's power?

414
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Yes, maybe a little bit. I would love that. If my power were to get people to start podcasts, I would love that.

415
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Here's the thing. What you could do is you could go back through Power Rangers episodes,

416
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
and you're like the expert. You know them inside out. She likes Power Rangers, but she hasn't seen them.

417
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So it could be like you guys having just watched an episode together, talking about seeing it for the first time and seeing it, you know, like, like a veteran.

418
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Yeah, there's a lot of things I could say about that, but I won't discuss plans like that.

419
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
All right. You don't want to have a meeting live on air. That's fine.

420
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
No, unless we're just talking about Power Rangers in general.

421
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Well, back to Until Dawn real quick, not to be all like back and forth, but you mentioned you watch a lot of Twitch streams.

422
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Yes.

423
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
And you know, you've, you've actually kind of like become a fan of some streamers through that.

424
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
What is it about the Until Dawn streams that are really appealing to you?

425
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I don't even think it's necessarily the streamers themselves. So some are like really personable and awesome.

426
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
But with Until Dawn, I like seeing the different choices people made versus what I did.

427
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I had a feeling.

428
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:27,000
And I also like seeing, well, it kind of goes hand in hand. Like there are a lot of ways you can die in that game I didn't think you could, and it's pretty funny.

429
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Do you think that Until Dawn's success is going to cause in two years time to be a lot of choose your own adventure type games?

430
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
No.

431
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Like we're going to see more games like this?

432
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
No, I don't think so.

433
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
You don't think so?

434
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Because I don't think it's that successful, but I think for a game that had no marketing and clearly they just didn't really end up caring about in the end that it's successful in that regard.

435
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
All right. Fair enough.

436
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Okay. Well, on that note, let's get into our gaming weeks.

437
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,000
We, after our kickoff topic, like to talk about what we have been playing this week, the types of video games we've been playing.

438
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Darsakra, at the top of the show, you mentioned you were pretty proud of what you've accomplished this week.

439
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Why don't you kick us off with how was your gaming week?

440
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer.

441
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I haven't gotten any more Amiibo cards yet.

442
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And that game is really just like sitting down and designing people's homes and watching everyone get completely happy.

443
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And then you get like backstory from some of the characters, too.

444
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
So it's pretty neat.

445
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
You get to work with Digby and that's also awesome because I like Digby.

446
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
And I'm back to playing Dragon Age Inquisition.

447
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I thought I was going to put it aside and finish Origins again.

448
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
And no, that didn't happen.

449
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I'm also playing Dragon Age Origins at the same time.

450
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I haven't played any Final Fantasy 14 this week, but I am hoping to enlist aid in just running nothing but a bunch of dungeons and instances.

451
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,000
And then Dan and I were...

452
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:00,000
He's been going through a real bout of playing the Rebirth games on the Wii U.

453
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And we also picked up...

454
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Have not started yet, but we picked up Earthbound Zero, aka Mother.

455
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Do you have your Happy Home Designer with you right now?

456
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Yes, I do.

457
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I would like to see that game, please.

458
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Okay, sure.

459
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
But not right now. I mean, we can't do that later.

460
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Okay.

461
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
There's other things going on, like a show.

462
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Like we do anything on the show.

463
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Hey!

464
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Except talk about food and I raid Rob's Pantry.

465
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I heard that. I heard that the crash is pretty funny.

466
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Those were so good!

467
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Rob, I'm just going to have to buy you another bag of those things.

468
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I think when I try to offer those to Shane, Shane's like, mmm, pumpkin.

469
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
What?

470
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
No, not the pumpkin ones, the cranberry.

471
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
What are you trying to offer me?

472
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Food.

473
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I have food.

474
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Shane gave me donuts this morning.

475
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Oh, I have a sad story in the FUs of the week about that.

476
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Did the mint donut fall over?

477
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
You just have to wait.

478
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Oh, you bastard.

479
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Anyhow, if that's it for Dark Soccer, it's gaming week.

480
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Whatevs.

481
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Then let's get to Loki. How was your gaming week?

482
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I played a little bit of Super Mario Maker because I was trying to unlock more costumes.

483
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
And so now I've hit the point where I can't play the easy mode anymore, which is super easy.

484
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,000
So now I had to play normal mode, which is basically easy mode but longer.

485
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,000
So I did that last night and played one, and that was about it.

486
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
And then I've been playing Ingress because I have a lot of free time in the morning apparently.

487
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
And I've leveled up to level four now.

488
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,000
You guys don't understand how bizarro this is to me.

489
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
It is bizarro.

490
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Not just Loki.

491
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Shane, too, is now playing Ingress a little bit.

492
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
You want to talk about bizarro.

493
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Why?

494
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Does this mean I have to start playing again so I don't feel left out?

495
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,000
We could raid. We could raid Roseville. It needs it.

496
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Holy balls.

497
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
As we could go Toys R Us 2, suddenly preparing your toys.

498
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
You saw how blue...

499
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I'm not downloading it again.

500
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Yes.

501
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Bastard.

502
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Anyway, we're going to have a whole Orange Lounge radio team, and they're not even going to know what the hell is happening.

503
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
We just need to have the orange color show up.

504
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I know. If we had an orange faction, that would be great.

505
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
No.

506
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
So here's how I finally got Shane to play.

507
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Because the first time, Shane was like, Ingress is so stupid, and he downloaded it.

508
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
He's like, what color are you? Green?

509
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
He's like, I'm going to go blue.

510
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And so he went blue just to fuck with me, right?

511
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
And I think Shane truly does love the color blue.

512
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
It is the best thing in the world.

513
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
And I was like, Shane, you don't understand.

514
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
If you play blue, you're cut off.

515
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
And I can't help you at all in that game.

516
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And you'll just have to rely on strangers to help you out.

517
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Because some people take this shit very seriously.

518
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
You don't understand.

519
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
So finally the other day, I was like, Shane, you have that thing for the Power Rangers, right?

520
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Like Chase and Riley, right? What color are they?

521
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Because I was like, I don't think it was the Blue Ranger.

522
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
And he goes, they were green and black.

523
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I said, did you know in Ingress, when you make fields, they're kind of green and black.

524
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And you can name yourself after a Power Ranger.

525
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
And then Shane's eyes kind of like, you make a good argument.

526
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
It was that and the fact that I go look for the toys, so I'm driving to these places anyway.

527
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Yeah.

528
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
So I finally got Shane to roll for the correct team.

529
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And I said, the blue is the wrong shade anyway.

530
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
It is kind of a light color.

531
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Well, I mean, and I've been just walking in the morning going to random parks.

532
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
There's some Resistance players that probably listen to this show that are like, whatever, Rob, you're an idiot.

533
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I'm sorry about it. Of course I'm going to recruit my friends for the same faction. Deal with it.

534
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Rob, you're totally not at all remotely sorry about anything ever.

535
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Nope. Not at all.

536
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:34,000
So, but yeah, I mean, uh, so I've been walking around in the mornings and doing that.

537
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Yeah, but you want to talk with Zorro World. I've been fucking eating salad every night.

538
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
So that's, you know, yeah, I know like a pod person or something.

539
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I don't know what's going on.

540
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
That's weird.

541
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
All right.

542
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,000
Uh, but anyways, yeah, so Ingress and then, um, level four and I don't know.

543
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
It's hard to level over here because there's like too much blue.

544
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
There's a lot of blue.

545
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Well, again, we have to do that thing where you go, we find like a bunch of portals in a park or something that are blue.

546
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I smash them, you cap them and link them and then that's, that's the best way to level up.

547
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Yeah.

548
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
That's what I do. That's how he got to level three in like a day.

549
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
So anyway.

550
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
By the way, all those portals that you smashed or whatever, they're all back to blue again.

551
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Of course they are. Of course they are.

552
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Except for one. Which they link to mine.

553
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
All right. Uh, let's get to Shane. How was your gaming week? What are you up to?

554
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I've been playing Ingress a little bit, not as much as everybody else, but just a little bit.

555
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:38,000
And, um, I, the game I completely wrote off on the 3DS, started playing on my phone, Pokemon shuffle.

556
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I can't quit playing it. Um.

557
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
The microtransactions in that game don't bother you though?

558
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I don't use them. I just wait the, I can't do math, but the time to get more hearts and then I play.

559
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And then if I don't have hearts and I don't play.

560
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,000
And then, um, I have been playing on my Japanese 3DS.

561
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Uh, they put out a Ninja game, which again, back to Power Rangers.

562
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It's not very good. Don't get it. It's pretty, pretty crappy.

563
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Um, and then me and Flaco Jones and his wife, we played Soma last night and that was fun because Soma is pretty scary.

564
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Oh yeah. You've been really into that.

565
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:23,000
It's not scary, I guess, but the atmosphere is really good and it makes you feel awkward when you play it. I like it.

566
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
How so?

567
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Well, there's this one part near the beginning, so I don't think it's really a spoiler.

568
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Um, it's when you are underwater in like this lab and there's this robot in the wall that's calling out for help.

569
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
And you go over to him and he thinks he's human and you try to kind of argue with him about it.

570
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:48,000
And the only way to get by him is to shut this power down, but he thinks he's hurt and when you shut the power down, he screams in pain.

571
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And it's the only way he can get by, but again, he thinks he's human, so it's like you're torturing him to get by and it just makes you unsettled.

572
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
This sounds like one of those sadistic Mario Maker levels where the only way to clear the level is to kill Yoshi.

573
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:18,000
No, it's not that sad. But it's a really interesting game so far and the one enemy we ran into just looks like a big blue robot chicken thing and it wasn't very scary.

574
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
But I'm sure there's more later.

575
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Alright, fair enough.

576
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. SSG100Matt talking about Ingress here for Loki saying,

577
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I wonder if Nellie is pissed at Rob that now her husband is wandering around raiding portals.

578
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
She doesn't care. I mean, I just told her-

579
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I would actually think she'd be happy that Matt's probably volunteering to change Kid's Park.

580
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I tried explaining the game to her, she just doesn't give a shit what I'm doing. She's like,

581
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

582
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
But he's walking more-

583
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I'm just saying, I go for walks in the morning.

584
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
And she's like, why don't you go to our park?

585
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I'm like, because these parks are closer and more convenient for me.

586
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And also I'm playing this game.

587
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Just waiting to get to level 8, then you're going to be places you never thought you'd ever go.

588
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I had to go to a dog park and walk into the park where the actual dogs are running around and just sit there playing on my phone and these people look like,

589
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
what the hell is he doing?

590
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I am hacking this portal.

591
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Wait until there's a group of like 10 of you at the park all staring at your fuckers.

592
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
And then I'm like, hey, look at this cemetery has a ton of portals I can hack.

593
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I'm going to go walk around in a cemetery. That's going to look strange.

594
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Just put on the goth makeup and no one will care.

595
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Actually, I find there's a lot of people that go walking in cemeteries because it's quiet and calm.

596
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Like, you know, it creeps some people out, but for others it's like-

597
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Well, it doesn't creep me out at all. It's just like, you know-

598
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
When I lived in Alabama-

599
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Are you here to visit somebody? No? Just kicking it? Okay, cool.

600
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
If you watched this week's Scream Queens, there's other things you can do in a cemetery too.

601
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
That's after dark and you have to be a weird person to do that.

602
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
It was so good.

603
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Okay, so my gaming week. Well, I always play Ingress. I just don't talk about it here on OLR, but I play other games too.

604
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I've been playing more Diablo 3. Alan and I have been running our season characters.

605
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Here's the hilarious thing.

606
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:26,000
So, my non-seasonal character, which, keep in mind, has the experience dump from season 1, 2, and 3, is Paragon 281.

607
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
My seasonal character is now Paragon 274.

608
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I'm about to pass, experience-wise, all of the experience I've gained until the season started, which is a pretty big deal.

609
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
So, that is Diablo 3.

610
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I have breaking news for you, I forgot.

611
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Oh god, alright.

612
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,000
No, so earlier today we were talking about PlayStation TVs, because this is gaming related.

613
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Yeah.

614
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Because they're on sale right now at a retailer, and you were like, I don't want one unless it can play Luminous.

615
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
And we saw that it said it couldn't, but I don't believe the internet most of the time.

616
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,000
So, I put in Luminous, you can start it, and that's it. You can't do anything. You can't get beyond the start screen.

617
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
That is so dumb.

618
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
That is very dumb.

619
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Unless you have the hack, which you can do and it can play most games.

620
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Oh, you know about that. Oh, there you go, you can hack it.

621
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I can hack it. Alright, yeah, I know we talked about the hack.

622
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
You have to send yourself an email.

623
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Go with me too.

624
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Yeah.

625
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Weird.

626
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Alright, anyway, other games I've been playing this week besides Diablo.

627
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Some new stuff. I played Super Meat Boy on PlayStation 4, because you guys might have heard that Super Meat Boy was finally released on the PlayStation platforms,

628
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
and they did the release on PlayStation 4, as well as the Vita.

629
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I haven't played the Vita version, just the PlayStation 4 version.

630
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Very interesting twist, because due to, I guess, some types of arrangement disagreements with the original soundtrack creator,

631
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
there's a brand new soundtrack for Super Meat Boy for the PlayStation version.

632
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
And I'm going to be honest, I love a lot of the composers that are in the new soundtrack.

633
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Not as good as the old soundtrack.

634
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
And maybe if I'd never heard the old soundtrack, I wouldn't feel that way.

635
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:08,000
But I just feel like, I don't know, like having played Super Meat Boy all these years on 360 and Steam and so forth,

636
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:19,000
with that, you know, kind of chiptune soundtrack, to kind of go from that to like a music in level one that sounds like this rodeo twang thing just doesn't really work for me.

637
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Like, I'm weird.

638
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It's really interesting how important a soundtrack can kind of be to a game.

639
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
And I didn't like the way the soundtrack scaled in the retro levels and some of that either.

640
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:39,000
The game itself is still good, but I also caught some like shadowing effects and some weird frame rate things on PlayStation.

641
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I don't know if that has to do with the refresh rate on my TV or what, but I'm going to be honest,

642
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I still think the 360 version or maybe even the Steam version is probably the definitive version of that game.

643
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
It's nice that it's on the PlayStation platform, especially free for PlayStation Plus people,

644
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
which if you have a PlayStation, you got to be PlayStation Plus.

645
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
So, I mean, that's cool if you've never had a chance to play it before.

646
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
It's, you know, still a good game and the soundtrack's not really going to change that.

647
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
But I don't think it's the definitive experience for Super Meat Boy.

648
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
And that's my honest opinion.

649
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Also played a game on Steam called Read Only Memories, which you might have heard came out this week, which you also played.

650
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Which I bought, but I haven't played yet. I forgot to mention.

651
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Oh, I bought that, but I never got a key for it.

652
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Check your email, because the keys didn't come out until the day the game came out.

653
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
And so, yeah.

654
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I hope I didn't delete it.

655
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,000
You know, I kickstarted the game. So, there you go.

656
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,000
So, I got my code and played, like, the first little bit of it.

657
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Okay, so I'm going to be very honest in saying something that might sound really cold, but it's just like,

658
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I'm just, tonight is honesty night, everybody.

659
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Here's the thing.

660
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I actually wasn't expecting the game to be very good.

661
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:59,000
And only because I know that these guys are very busy with the convention and all this stuff,

662
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
and, you know, when I saw that they went the retro route, I was like,

663
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,000
oh, they're probably doing that, you know, because it's, like, easier or whatever.

664
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Never mind, I didn't back it, unfortunately.

665
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Oh, you didn't back it?

666
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
No, I was thinking Electronic Opus.

667
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Oh, no, no, no.

668
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,000
And I thought, you know, oh, it's probably, they're stretched too thin,

669
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
and they're not really going to have the time to make the game.

670
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:26,000
But I'm happy to say, as cold as that sounds, the game actually turned out pretty good.

671
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,000
And it really does feel like a throwback to, like, the older PC games.

672
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Like, I'm playing, like, I don't know, King's Quest or Space Quest,

673
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
or one of those, like, old school games on the PC.

674
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
And so, I like that aesthetic.

675
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,000
It's heavily, heavily inspired by Snatcher, which I don't have as much experience with,

676
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
but from what I understand about the game, that influence is definitely there as well.

677
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
So, as mean as what I said is, I'm happy to say the game is actually better

678
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
than I expected in that regard.

679
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
But, yeah.

680
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
So, there you go.

681
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
I only played through the prologue in the first little bit of Chapter 1,

682
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
so I still have a long way to go, but my early impressions are,

683
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
okay, this is, like, retro, kind of cool.

684
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I like it.

685
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I know a lot of people have heard about, you know, because it was the Kickstarter,

686
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
because it was the same team that does GamerX, which is now GX,

687
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
some people are wondering about, is there a huge, like,

688
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
social justice warrior agenda in the game.

689
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:31,000
And to be honest, like, I think a lot of people are talking about the pronoun thing,

690
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,000
which, to me, like, don't most games that are a little bit first person,

691
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
don't they, like, ask you in the beginning,

692
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
like, oh, are you boy or girl?

693
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Like, you get asked that question in the beginning of the game.

694
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Okay, so the difference here is that it's just, so, what do you prefer to be called?

695
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
And it's, like, a list of five things, or you can even put in your own thing.

696
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
And I don't see the big issue with that.

697
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Like, whatever makes you happy and what you prefer to be addressed by, go for it.

698
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I could even change it, and I thought about doing this,

699
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
so instead of having, like, he or him, I was going to do, like,

700
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
the whole, like, Peppermint Patty and Marcy thing and be addressed as sir.

701
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
And the game would have let me do that.

702
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
So, you know, I think it's, you can do whatever you want.

703
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:12,000
That's cool.

704
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Yeah. So, and, but, I mean, the story, like, it isn't like it's this huge, like,

705
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,000
oh, we have to start this campaign and get signatures

706
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,000
to get such and such TV show off the air because it's problematic.

707
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Like, that's not what the game is about at all.

708
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Your friend gets kidnapped and you're trying to put together the clues

709
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:36,000
about where your friend has gone off to because the little robot servant dude

710
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
escaped and came to you for help.

711
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,000
So, I mean, it's like, so the story itself has nothing to do with any of that.

712
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
So, there you go.

713
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
So, that was my thought on Read Only Memories.

714
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
So, that was my gaming week.

715
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
My early thoughts, I should say.

716
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Quick housekeeping.

717
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Not a lot to say, but I will say, speaking of GX and all that,

718
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:05,000
we are going to be there at GX3, which is the weekend December 11th and 12th

719
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
and 13th, I think it's Friday, Saturday, Sunday, that whole weekend.

720
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Dark Soccer and myself will be there, as well as,

721
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
I don't know if anybody else from VoG is going,

722
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
but I know some other friendly podcasters and some people

723
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
that have been here on OLR are going to be there with us.

724
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
And VoG will actually have a table at the show,

725
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
and I still don't know what we're doing with said table,

726
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
but we'll figure it out.

727
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
You know, now that I have the-

728
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I'll arm wrestle people.

729
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Now that I have the Retron and this, we actually have a spare TV,

730
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
maybe what we'll do is we'll set up like a classic gaming thing.

731
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
If you want to bring some of your games, we can figure something out.

732
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Which reminds me, did you still want to borrow a Neo Geo Pocket Color?

733
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Because we have several.

734
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I might, but I don't want to keep it, but I'll borrow it.

735
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Okay.

736
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Yeah, to play it and check it out, but I don't want to keep it, yeah.

737
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Okay.

738
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Yeah, that'll work. Cool.

739
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news then, now that all that's done.

740
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Oh, Twitter.com slash OLR, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio,

741
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

742
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
All that good stuff.

743
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Okay, let's get into some gaming news.

744
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Loki's starting us off this week.

745
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Well, a good way to kick off the holiday season is a price drop,

746
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
and that's what Sony has.

747
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
They announced effective October 9th that the base PlayStation 4 will drop

748
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:23,000
from $399 to $349 in the US, and in Canada it would be $449 to $429.

749
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,000
And the holiday bundles are going to be dropping as well.

750
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,000
So take a look out for that if you're in the market for PlayStation 4.

751
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Also, to go along with that, if you're in the UK, you can now utilize PlayStation Now,

752
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,000
and you can stream over 100 games, and that is a thing, I guess, now.

753
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,000
They have an unlimited subscription for, looks like, 13 pounds.

754
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Nice.

755
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
That price drop, though, totally not shocking.

756
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
We all knew it was coming, right?

757
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Yeah, I mean, it's been a couple years already.

758
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,000
This is about that time where people are going to start thinking about the holidays.

759
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I mean, Black Friday is when it really kicks into gear,

760
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
but since there will be some game releases throughout October and November,

761
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,000
now is the time to do it.

762
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Yeah, like a Fallout 4 or Call of Duty or Just Cause 3.

763
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Or that Star Wars Battlefront thing that happened this weekend, I know, for the beta.

764
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Just a few games coming out.

765
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Yeah, so it was the right time.

766
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:31,000
So, yeah, that keeps the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One neck and neck with the price, competitive.

767
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
You're moved, Nintendo.

768
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Seriously, or just, I don't know.

769
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Have to sweeten that bundle or something.

770
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Do something.

771
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Well, it's almost kind of like, it seems like kind of an idle state, you know, until the NX stuff comes out.

772
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
It's like, oh, hey, we're saving all the sweet stuff for the NX,

773
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
and they better not fucking pull Twilight Princess on us with the fucking,

774
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
oh, hey, remember that cool Zelda game?

775
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Yeah, about that.

776
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I know, a lot of people seem to think that's where it's going to go. We'll see.

777
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,000
That's not going to be on the Wii. That's going to piss people off.

778
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Some people thought Twilight Princess on GameCube was a better experience than the Wii.

779
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
So, I don't know, just putting it out there.

780
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I guess we have to really know what NX is.

781
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Maybe NX doesn't really lend itself well to this Zelda game, so it can't do it.

782
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
We don't know.

783
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
It would be cool if it was something, well, I don't know.

784
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
NX is also a version of Pump It Up.

785
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
It'll just be the Nintendo dance console.

786
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
I'd be down with that, actually.

787
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
All right, well, speaking of Nintendo, and a game that I did play this week, but I forgot to talk about,

788
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I played a little bit of Splatoon.

789
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Oh, yeah, me too.

790
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Yeah, Splatfest happened. Were you Team Planes or Cars?

791
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I said maybe be Team Planes.

792
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Well, we lost.

793
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I can't play ranked matches anyway, so it's not ranked.

794
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
It's not ranked. You just go into the regular matches.

795
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Well, I won a couple and lost one, so woo!

796
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
You might get some snails when you load up the game again.

797
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Ew.

798
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I will not play it if there are any type of land-based mollusks involved.

799
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
They're a currency. You just sell them.

800
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Yeah, they're a currency.

801
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
No, I won't play it now.

802
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Interesting. All right.

803
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:18,000
But, yeah, so Planes lost. Even though it was like 64 to 36 percent popularity,

804
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:24,000
it seems like every Splatfest, the least popular team, does better in the wins.

805
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Except last time. Art won, and it was more popular, and it had more wins.

806
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Oh, but wasn't it like really neck and neck? Like it was like 51-49 or something?

807
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
Yeah, both of them were.

808
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,000
It was really neck and neck. No, the only Splatfest I've won is the friggin' Decepticon one.

809
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I've never won one still.

810
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Jeez, what is up with that? So anyway, that wasn't the news I wanted to get to,

811
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:51,000
but just throwing it out there. But with Splatoon, they have actually just launched Splatnet.

812
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,000
So if you go to splatoon.nintendo.net, you can log in with your Nintendo Network ID,

813
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:02,000
and you can actually, I mean, there's not a lot there, but you can see your friends list online,

814
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,000
which that's something I don't remember Nintendo doing before.

815
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Can we please have it so every time I log into that game, I don't get the stupid news update

816
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
that's really annoying.

817
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:16,000
They do that so you know the stages, but that's what the app or the site does.

818
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I don't care what the stages are, or have it so I can skip that shit, because I don't care.

819
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
And the app will tell you what the stages are if you need to know.

820
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
It'll tell you the next three sets, which is great, because that's also for ranked.

821
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
It'll tell you what ranked styles are coming up.

822
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
And then it shows you if your friends are on, so without having to turn the Wii U on,

823
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
you know if your friends are online or not. And then I guess you can set times,

824
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,000
but that just sends out a tweet or does it through the sidebar, right?

825
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Yeah, it sends out a tweet, and it also sends it out in Japanese, because Jim did it,

826
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:54,000
and it was like, tweet English, and then two minutes later it was in Japanese.

827
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
I was like, when did you type that?

828
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,000
Speaking of Japanese, I know this is really random, but before the show tonight,

829
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
we were doing Mario Maker, because Loki brought his amiibo that I don't have,

830
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,000
because I don't have a Bowser. So he brought his Bowser, and he brought that other Mario,

831
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
which I did not realize it is the blue Mario and the brown Mario, the pixelated ones,

832
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
they are different.

833
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Didn't I tell you that?

834
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
You did, but it's not what you said it was.

835
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Did you still go big?

836
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:27,000
You go big, but you're the classic colors, and it doesn't do the television effect.

837
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I'm sorry, you're the modern colors, and it doesn't do the TV effect.

838
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Oh, that's weird.

839
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Yeah, it's weird. So the two amiibo do different things.

840
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
But anyway, I unlocked Bowser, but the reason why I bring that up,

841
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I also got the notification that says you have messages,

842
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
and I noticed a Japanese player commented on my Bowser man level,

843
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:47,000
and I was like, oh, that's kind of, okay, cool, international, I got something there.

844
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Well, I pulled up the comments, and the Japanese player had just posted,

845
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:56,000
they drew a pile of poop as a comment to my level.

846
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Now, are they actually trying to say that my level was shit?

847
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Is that what they're trying to say, that it was a shitty level?

848
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Because I'm like, sorry, you couldn't handle it.

849
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Or did they just draw poop because they could?

850
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Did they shit themselves playing the level?

851
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Maybe it's not poop. Maybe it's ice cream.

852
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Maybe it's ice cream without a cone. I don't know.

853
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Soft serve ice cream. Here's some soft serve ice cream for you.

854
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
That was soft serve ice cream from a magical unicorn's butt.

855
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
That's what it was.

856
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:31,000
That would be amazing if soft serve ice cream came out of a unicorn's ass.

857
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
I might like unicorns a little bit more for that.

858
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:41,000
But it'd actually have to be ice cream. I will not accept, you know, trick ice cream.

859
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Let's see, Tiger Clonchette says, Sky, probably, because you know that old saying,

860
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
a picture is worth a thousand words.

861
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
S2100Matt says, was it Irene posing as a Japanese player?

862
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
That would actually make a lot of sense.

863
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
That would.

864
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,000
That would make a lot of sense.

865
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,000
All right. Let's see.

866
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Let's go on, I guess, to our next story, except our soccer ran out of the room.

867
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
So I guess we'll loop back to her here in a minute.

868
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
So, Loki, why don't you take what's next?

869
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,000
All right. So, Konami.

870
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,000
We used to love you, but now you're just kind of like, what the hell?

871
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:26,000
So now, Konami, as part of their microtransaction fest in Metal Gear Solid V,

872
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
they have the whole FOBs that you can have,

873
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
and you can have people attack them and stuff like that in their little multiplayer mode.

874
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Well, now you can insure your FOB for real money.

875
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:45,000
That way, if someone attacks your base and destroys stuff, you get paid for it.

876
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:51,000
And so you can pay with it for MB coins or real money.

877
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Yeah. So that's nice.

878
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:02,000
And then, along with that, they have some cosmetic DLC for 99 cents each.

879
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:08,000
And they even went as far as to add horse armor.

880
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Like, this is one of those things you can't even make up.

881
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Like, it's just, you know, it's so meta, what's happening there.

882
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Yeah, so, I mean, it's like, I don't know, it's like different tack.

883
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Like, you have western tack and parade tack.

884
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
But it's basically costumes for your horse, so...

885
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
Alright, I mean, sure.

886
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,000
It's like, let's just make this even more of a joke now.

887
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,000
But, oh my god, the whole DLC for a freaking insurance against other players?

888
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
You know, let's be honest, so...

889
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I used to play, okay, I used to play a Facebook game called Sorority Life.

890
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:53,000
And the whole thing in Sorority Life was that I guess you could attack other bitches' sororities and steal their money and stuff.

891
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Like, that was the whole thing in the game.

892
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,000
And it's like, if you don't check in every day, you're gonna get attacked by all these high level players.

893
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
They're gonna take all your shit.

894
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,000
And it gets really frustrating. That's why I don't play it anymore.

895
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
And I was like, that's in Metal Gear Solid 5?

896
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
And I have to pay to protect myself?

897
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Get fucked. I don't care.

898
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Like, I don't know, is that just one mode of the game?

899
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Yeah, it's like their little multiplayer mode that they have in there.

900
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
I don't know, I guess fine, I won't be playing that.

901
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,000
The unnecessary multiplayer mode that they added in so they can unnecessarily charge you for insurance.

902
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Wait till they add an update where the computer can attack your base so they make you get that insurance and not just other players attacking you.

903
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I mean, Grand Theft Auto Online has insurance for your cars that they get destroyed, but it's with in-game money.

904
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:41,000
You don't have the, I mean, you could buy real money, or in-game money with real money, but you don't have to.

905
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,000
And, I don't know, it's just dumb.

906
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Dungeon Buster in chat says, I don't care about my FOB, I just used it to expand my staffing levels, you can totally ignore it.

907
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:57,000
And William Murderface in chat says, well at this point Konami has burned most of its bridges with game fans, so why not all of them?

908
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Why not?

909
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Just light it on fire.

910
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Hey, they're still making games though, console games.

911
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Is anyone gonna give a shit when it comes out?

912
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I mean, seriously, is anyone gonna give a shit of whatever they have coming out that's aside from Pro Evo?

913
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
If it's Dance Sense Revolution, I may give a little bit of a shit.

914
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
A little bit of a shit, yeah.

915
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
A little bit of a shit, but, you know, most likely no.

916
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Since Rock Band and Guitar Hero are all having this resurgence, we're gonna try Beatmania again in the US?

917
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Yeah, right. I'm not gonna hold my breath all night.

918
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
No, they'll do, um, what was their other game?

919
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Rock Revolution.

920
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
That one, yeah, that's what they'll revive.

921
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Ugh, alright.

922
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Let's go back to Dark Sakura, because we jumped over one of your-

923
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
But their drum set was so unique!

924
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

925
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Well, we've been talking for a little bit about the voice acting strike.

926
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:54,000
It's, uh, I suppose it's just pronounced SAGAFTRA, or S-A-G-A-F-T-R-A.

927
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Had put out the request for votes to see if they want to authorize a strike in response to an impasse in negotiations with the game industry.

928
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:11,000
And 96.52% of its members voted and authorized a strike.

929
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:17,000
They have to have the 75% yes vote to give the national board the authority for it.

930
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:23,000
So, now this doesn't mean there's a strike right now and there's no more voice acting, good voice acting in games ever.

931
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:31,000
It just means that they now have the ability to have a strike, and so they're opening things up for negotiations.

932
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
It looks like, uh-

933
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:41,000
They've drawn the strike card and put it into their deck for possible future play, but they don't necessarily have to play it.

934
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Exactly, it's recycled back into their library.

935
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Yes.

936
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,000
So, it could be on, it couldn't be on, who knows.

937
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:56,000
It's just, it's now a tactic that's available and endorsed by the majority of its members.

938
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:03,000
And it probably wouldn't affect games right away because most of your voice acting is done a long time in advance.

939
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:07,000
But still, not to lessen the impact that a strike like this would have.

940
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
And we talked about it on a previous episode of the show.

941
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,000
You know, it's a pretty, pretty big deal and could, you know, majorly impact some games down the line.

942
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Especially games that have sequels that you get used to.

943
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Like, you know, like BioWare games, right?

944
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,000
You know, we all know they won't stop with Mass Effect Andromeda.

945
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
They'll be in Andromeda 2 or something.

946
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
That could be impacted by a strike like this.

947
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,000
You know, the same voice talent may not be available or they'd have to schedule it differently.

948
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
It could delay the game or what have you.

949
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:40,000
On the flip side, there's some more amateur level voice actors who are a part of SAG-AFTRA who are excited!

950
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Yay, work!

951
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:48,000
But it's kind of like, well, you know, and then you get into those tricky situations where you're crossing a picket line, essentially.

952
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:54,000
But aren't they striking in the first place for better conditions for everybody?

953
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Like the whole yelling and stuff.

954
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
We talked about this, you know, I know Marisa called in last week. We talked a little bit about it.

955
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I'd actually like for Marisa to call in again.

956
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Yeah, but anyway.

957
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
If she's out there.

958
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
Yeah.

959
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Hopefully we'll get to her later in the show.

960
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Because I know she had, I saw a Facebook post of hers that addressed this whole thing.

961
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
So it'll be interesting.

962
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Again, they have not actually gone on strike, but they've drawn the card and they can choose to play it or discard it on a later turn.

963
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
So we'll see what happens.

964
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,000
And well, actually, they could bring it up and then, like I said, recycle it back into their library.

965
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,000
That's true.

966
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
And cast it for five red mana.

967
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
We'll see what happens. We'll see.

968
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Alright, moving on. Talking about DLC, more DLC.

969
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,000
You know, Loki was just talking about Metal Gear Solid.

970
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
And earlier in the show we were talking about Guitar Hero.

971
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Well, let's talk about Rise of the Tomb Raider.

972
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Because Rise of the Tomb Raider also going to be having microtransactions, if you can believe it.

973
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:01,000
Rise of the Tomb Raider, you'll be able to get expedition card packs.

974
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:08,000
The cards will have modifiers that you can use on custom missions, which you then share with your friends.

975
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:15,000
So things like Big Head Mode or things that increase the challenge or give you special advantages.

976
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:20,000
You can get these card packs with credits in the game or real money.

977
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Sounds very similar to the BioWare setup in multiplayer.

978
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:31,000
But it looks like it's just for this custom mission mode, which is not part of the main story game.

979
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
There's also two types of cards in the game, foil and common.

980
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Foil gets to be used an unlimited number of times, but commons are a one-time use.

981
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:45,000
There will be about 300 cards to start with, more to come after that.

982
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:52,000
So there you go, another $60 game with the DLC in there.

983
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
And this one, again, another random element in there.

984
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,000
But I don't know, because again, I kind of say it sounds like Mass Effect.

985
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:05,000
But I was fine with the way Mass Effect did it and the way that Dragon Age multiplayer does it.

986
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Because you can earn the stuff at a relatively decent pace yourself.

987
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,000
You don't have to spend money, it's just you spend money to rush it along.

988
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
So I think it all depends on how it's weighed in the game.

989
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
It may not be as bad as it sounds on paper, but we'll see.

990
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
We'll see when the game comes out.

991
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Let's go back over to Dark Sakura for another story.

992
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
More from me. Why do you want to talk to me so much tonight?

993
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Because you ate all my food, you gotta work.

994
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Oh, fine, fine. Well, at any rate, we all love Shovel Knight, don't we?

995
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Yay!

996
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Yes.

997
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Thanks, Shane.

998
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I never played it. I thought it was going to be Mega Man, but it wasn't.

999
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
It's Duck Tales. It's not really that either.

1000
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:55,000
You gotta just check it out. It's like a Capcom game of that era, but it's not really like any of the others.

1001
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Well, they have announced, with extremely heavy hearts in the quote, that the Xbox One physical version of Shovel Knight is not happening.

1002
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Basically, they said that because of publishing policies on that platform, things that are beyond their control, it's not happening.

1003
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,000
The pre-orders were really good, and they thank everyone for their support, but it just can't happen.

1004
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:30,000
So, they agreed to a $19.99 price point, and then ran into other retail issues as well, so yeah, it's just not happening.

1005
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:36,000
That Microsoft. What are you going to do?

1006
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,000
You can calm your ex-boners now, because it's not happening.

1007
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Well, there's also a part of me that's like, is there a really big loss to not have a retail release?

1008
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:52,000
What market really is there when the game's downloadable and so many people are connected now?

1009
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
But then I think maybe...

1010
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Some people like a physical release of it.

1011
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Well, there is that, and maybe other countries too, where it might not be as easy to get online.

1012
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
It's much easier to get the physical copy.

1013
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I don't know. That's just kind of the thought that goes through my head, is that maybe it's like, it actually is a huge deal.

1014
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Stocking stuffers?

1015
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I don't know. I don't know about that. Maybe.

1016
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:21,000
ActDeft in chat over at live.vognetwork.com has some feelings on this, saying I had that one pre-ordered. I'm really sad.

1017
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:29,000
And that it's DuckTales, Castlevania, Metroid, and all the really good platformers of the NES era, and putting a lot of frowny faces at what Shane is saying.

1018
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:34,000
I didn't even say anything. All I said was I thought it was Mega Man, but apparently it's not.

1019
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
That's all I said.

1020
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
What if it's better? I mean, it probably is better than some of the later Mega Man games.

1021
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I like the proper number series just fine.

1022
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:52,000
But I do want the Amiibo, probably, because it's an Amiibo, and if I can't find a Power Ranger toy that day and I can find him, I'm sure that's what I'll want.

1023
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I definitely want the Shovel Knight Amiibo, that's for sure.

1024
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:00,000
But anyway, alright. We're going to travel around the world and check out some release dates of games that will be coming out.

1025
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Yes. And this week, actually, there's the Back to the Future game by Telltale Games.

1026
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:13,000
They're doing a 30th anniversary edition because, hey, the 30th anniversary of the movie!

1027
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Well, not really the movie, but like the... Isn't this like the same, now the Back to the Future 2 date or something coming up?

1028
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Isn't it like the 15th or something?

1029
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Is someone going crazy about that?

1030
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Anyway, so that date is coming up, and that'll be coming out on Xbox 360 and, I believe, PlayStation 4.

1031
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Along with that, there's going to be Grand Ages Medieval, Wasteland 2.

1032
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Oh, and Grand Ages Medieval is going to be coming out on PlayStation 4.

1033
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Wasteland 2 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, the Director's Cut.

1034
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Dragon Quest Heroes Slime, Collector's Edition on PlayStation 4.

1035
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:01,000
And on PlayStation 3, Arland Atelier Trilogy.

1036
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:07,000
And then it looks like they're doing a re-release of the Smurfs on 3DS.

1037
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Thank you, Ubisoft, you really needed that.

1038
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:18,000
And also the non-Collector's Edition Dragon Quest Heroes, the World Trees Woe and the Blight Blow.

1039
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
That's one hell of a subtitle.

1040
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
That's also PlayStation 4.

1041
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
The Legend of Legacy on 3DS.

1042
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
That's an exciting game. I kind of want to play that.

1043
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Corpse Party Blood Drive, Evening After Edition on Vita.

1044
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:41,000
And the Talos Principle, getting a physical release on PlayStation 4.

1045
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Oh, wow.

1046
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Also, later in the week, they're doing a Goosebumps game, I guess in tying with the movie.

1047
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,000
And Nintendo, hey, look, they have a game coming out. Yoshi's Woolly World.

1048
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Both the game by itself and the Amiibo bundle.

1049
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
Those are going to be coming out on Friday.

1050
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:04,000
And along with that, they're doing a re-release of Super Mario Bros. U, plus New Super Luigi.

1051
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
And it's in a bundle for $60.

1052
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,000
I saw that at Toys R Us today. I wonder if it wasn't supposed to be on the shelves.

1053
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
It may be a re-release. I thought they even had that out already.

1054
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
That's not a big deal. That's more of a re-release.

1055
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
That's probably not a big deal to break street on that.

1056
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Alright, well, traveling over to Japan.

1057
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Actually, it's kind of a slow week in Japan. Not a lot coming out.

1058
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Geki Jigen Tag Blank Plus Neptune vs. Zombie Gundam comes out on the Vita this week in regular and limited edition.

1059
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:41,000
And then over on the 3DS this week, we have, and I lost it here, sorry, but there's actually on PlayStation 4,

1060
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:47,000
there's really nothing this week and nothing on Wii U that I saw anyway.

1061
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Yeah, and on the 3DS this week, we have Dragon Ball Z.

1062
01:07:55,000 --> 01:08:05,000
I'm sorry, no, Dragon Ball, that's different, 7th Dragon 3 code VFD is out on the 3DS in Japan this week.

1063
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Next week, though, on the 3DS is Legend of Zelda Triforce Heroes.

1064
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:14,000
So, you know, things will be picking up again when the release is there, but pretty slow week in Japan otherwise.

1065
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Dark Sakura.

1066
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Well, in other news, we have a release on the 13th, in 13th October, is the Talos Principle for PS4 in the UK.

1067
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:32,000
On the 16th, we have Back to the Future 30th Anniversary Edition on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Xbox 360.

1068
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Dragon Quest Heroes for PS4, Tales of Zestiria for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3, and WRC 5 on pretty much everything else.

1069
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
That's it.

1070
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week, Loki.

1071
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:55,000
So after reading a little bit about this, I'm kind of excited about Minecraft Story Mode, but they're going to be doing a Let's Play,

1072
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,000
or they're claiming to be the world's largest Let's Play.

1073
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:05,000
It's basically going to be held at the ArcLight Cinemarama Dome in Hollywood, California.

1074
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:15,000
They're going to be doing that on October 12th, and they're supposed to have, well, it can hold up to 800 guests, and that's what they're trying to do there.

1075
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:29,000
They're going to be basically playing through the first episode, Order of the Stone, and it's going to be streamed on the YouTube gaming channel, I guess at 7pm Eastern Time.

1076
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,000
But the voice cast is what kind of has me excited about the game.

1077
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:44,000
They have, was it, Patton Oswalt, Ashley Johnson from The Last of Us, Brian Pushing, Billy West, Corey Feldman, and Paul Reubens.

1078
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
That's pretty cool.

1079
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Yeah, so I actually will have to check that out. That looks pretty awesome.

1080
01:09:50,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Which, by the way, I don't watch the show, but Paul Reubens is going to be on Gotham as Penguin's dad, as he was in Batman Returns.

1081
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Do they have the, oh yeah, they do have the Penguin on that show. I watch like half the first season and then gave up.

1082
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
It's like Batman without Paul Reubens.

1083
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I would watch it for Paul Reubens. Well, that and I don't like DC very much, but I would watch it with Paul Reubens.

1084
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
You know, so...

1085
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Could he be like a villain in one of these, like, comic book movies? I mean, I know he was in Mystery Men, but...

1086
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
I always thought he'd make a good Riddler.

1087
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
I can see that.

1088
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
He's probably, he's got to be about 60 years old now.

1089
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
So?

1090
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Well, I mean, I'm just saying, you know, he's...

1091
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,000
He can, he still looks, he still does the full Bewe thing.

1092
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
That's true, that's true.

1093
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
He looks fine.

1094
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I want to see the new movie.

1095
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Does it matter?

1096
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:47,000
SSG-100 Matt in chat says the second season is better. Maybe I'll have to check that out. We'll see.

1097
01:10:47,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Alright, moving on to another story here about possibly playing Xbox 360 and original Xbox games through the Xbox One.

1098
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
360 games maybe on the PC.

1099
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:15,000
This was in an interview with Gizmodo Brazil, where the Xbox head Phil Spencer was talking about that original Xbox games being backward compatible on Xbox One would be great.

1100
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,000
But he did reiterate that Xbox 360 functionality is the priority right now.

1101
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:25,000
He said also he wants Windows 10 users to be able to play the Xbox 360 games on PC.

1102
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Quote, it's something I want to do.

1103
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:35,000
I would love to have the ability to play Xbox 360 on PC at some point, but it would be great to have support for original Xbox games too.

1104
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:44,000
To be clear, he's hinted at the 360 things on PC before, but, you know, the fact he's bringing it up again, I wonder if this is something they may be working on.

1105
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Especially, you would think, I mean, you could easily do the streaming anyway, but if you could take the Xbox One out of the equation for some people, that would be really awesome.

1106
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:59,000
He says, quote, so yes, I want to do, but have many other things we want to do as well.

1107
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:04,000
People fight with me for not having background music, so we have much work to do.

1108
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,000
You know, the more and more I hear from Phil Spencer, the more I like his perspective on things.

1109
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Because there was another interview I was reading with him this week where he talked about how, you know, they are still trying to regain confidence over the bridges they burned about the Xbox One's initial reveal.

1110
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:25,000
That there are still people that are confused and will ask, does the Xbox One play used games?

1111
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Because they don't know because of that mixed message in the very beginning.

1112
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:36,000
So, I really like the guy's, like, upfrontness and I feel like he's pretty transparent, especially, like, compared to Nintendo.

1113
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
You know, I kind of feel like he's really upfront about a lot of things. So, I like the guy.

1114
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,000
He's a good fit on, like, who he was in before.

1115
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Let's have him run Nintendo.

1116
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
You never know. You never know.

1117
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
All right. Well, let's travel.

1118
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
Or Konami. Let's have him run Konami.

1119
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Let's travel back in time when, you know, these heads of companies were just pictures we saw in magazines.

1120
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:03,000
We didn't hear interviews on the internet. We just would see them in comics and magazines.

1121
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,000
The classic game of the week.

1122
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Every week, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds one game that she thinks, hey, you un-

1123
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
I just broke my hair clip.

1124
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Are you okay?

1125
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Yeah, but it's expensive. Shit.

1126
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Aww. Well, at least it's just a hair clip and not a finger.

1127
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,000
All right.

1128
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Yeah, but now I don't have anything to pull my substantial hair back with, Rob. Thank you.

1129
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:27,000
You can just let it all hang down.

1130
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Well, if I had a spare hair clip, I'd loan you one, but I don't have a mani tail.

1131
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Hold my hair while I throw up.

1132
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Hold my hair back.

1133
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
All right. Let's go to the classic game of the week.

1134
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Dark Soccer's gonna let her hair down and share with you guys what game she thinks you should be playing this week.

1135
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Dark Soccer.

1136
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Oh, girl.

1137
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:53,000
So, the game this week is Castlevania the Adventure.

1138
01:13:53,000 --> 01:14:00,000
And in Japan it was called Dracula Densetsu, also known as the Legend of Dracula.

1139
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:07,000
It was a platformer for the Game Boy that came out in 1989, and it was re-released- well, kind of re-released.

1140
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:13,000
It was remade as Castlevania the Adventure Rebirth, which is a WiiWare game for the Wii.

1141
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Dan's been actually playing quite a bit of that, so I was really inspired, I should say, by watching him play through this.

1142
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,000
God, the last two bosses are really easy in this, by the way.

1143
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
I actually have the Wii game as well.

1144
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Yeah.

1145
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:32,000
It's pretty good. A lot of those WiiWare games got really overlooked, but there was some good stuff on there.

1146
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Well, we were doing like the, what game did this song come from? What game did this one come from? You know.

1147
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:47,000
So, anyway, it was said about a century before the original Castlevania, so you play Christopher Belmont, who is an ancestor of Simon.

1148
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:53,000
And he goes through all the different stages to beat Dracula and do the stuff that those Belmonts do.

1149
01:14:53,000 --> 01:15:01,000
You can, you start off with three lives, and then when, if you die, then you have to restart the level after your three are gone.

1150
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:05,000
You can upgrade your weapons. You can get a chain whip and flame whip.

1151
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:10,000
You can, anytime you get hit, it will downgrade the weapon.

1152
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:15,000
There's no stairs in this one, unlike the other Castlevania games.

1153
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:22,000
The new one actually has stuff like that, has stairs and things.

1154
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,000
You also have to beat your primary evil every level.

1155
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:34,000
You get crystals, hearts, and crosses of gold, and a point counter, and every 10,000 points you get an extra life.

1156
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Each stage also has a time limit, which was funny because Dan was beating death and then he was kind of screwing around at the end of the fight and actually died due to the time limit.

1157
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
But this was in the new one.

1158
01:15:46,000 --> 01:16:00,000
So anyway, it was called pretty difficult and had really long levels, but it's pretty simple, it's basic, and it goes back to the Castlevania roots, so it was pretty good.

1159
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:09,000
IDW also did a series of comic books about Christopher Belmont in 2005. It's called Castlevania the Belmont Legacy.

1160
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
And there you go, just simple as that.

1161
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
There it is, your classic game of the week, Castlevania Adventure.

1162
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Well we're going to take a quick break, but when we come back there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come, so don't go anywhere.

1163
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:58,000
We're going to get to rapid fire news, the FUGU Question of the Week, and your calls when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1164
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1165
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Live tonight, October the 11th of 2015 with episode number 617 of our show.

1166
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:21,000
DarkSakura, Loki, and myself all here in the studio joined by our pal Shane Alinko, who is enabling me during the break, who pointed out,

1167
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Hey Rob, look!

1168
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Heroes power.

1169
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Look at Amazon, there's a Toon Link, and you don't have one in your collection.

1170
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
And it was for a regular price with free shipping.

1171
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Toon Link's only $13.99, available on Prime, and I'm like, it's a Japanese one.

1172
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
So, it's the same. Alright, fine, bought it.

1173
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Rob, why didn't you get me a Sheik while you were at it?

1174
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Because, the addiction is bad enough for myself, I don't need to involve other people as well.

1175
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:53,000
I look at that shelf and I think each one of those cost X amount of dollars and I just feel deep shame.

1176
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
But I could use a Sheik.

1177
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Well I could use a pony, are you going to buy me a pony?

1178
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,000
You can't use a pony.

1179
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Sure, everybody could use a pony.

1180
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
What you need is a goat for your backyard.

1181
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,000
To eat all that.

1182
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
I would love to have a goat, actually. That would be amazing.

1183
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
That would be great.

1184
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,000
I wonder if I can find another Amiibo that's regular priced by the time the show's over.

1185
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
The thing that I need for my collection?

1186
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Yeah.

1187
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
I don't really need everything though, like I even said-

1188
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,000
I don't either, but you say that, but then look at that and you're like, well now I do, because look how far I've come.

1189
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I know, but I don't really want, like you've been pushing-

1190
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
You don't want the Fire Emblem.

1191
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
The Fire Emblem people, and I know I'm weird with that.

1192
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Like, because I know a lot of people really love the Fire Emblem.

1193
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
But I'm like, eh, eh, I don't really need them.

1194
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,000
But it's the old school characters that really do it.

1195
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Like the old, you know, Nintendo and Super Nintendo.

1196
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
I think the reason why I don't really care about Fire Emblem is because of the newer.

1197
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Well technically he's not Marth old school.

1198
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,000
He's one.

1199
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Whatever.

1200
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
He's the one you can find right now too in the store.

1201
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Whatever.

1202
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
I'm not listening to you.

1203
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
Alright.

1204
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Let's move on, we're going to do some rapid fire news.

1205
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,000
Loki, why don't you start us off with some quick news here.

1206
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Alright, I'll stop making Mario Maker levels.

1207
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Alright, so Far Cry has a new game coming out.

1208
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Far Cry Primal, it's going to be medieval, or not medieval, Stone Age.

1209
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
That would have been cool if it was medieval.

1210
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Medieval Far Cry.

1211
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Yeah, I'd like that even better.

1212
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,000
I would get that.

1213
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Stone Age Far Cry, not sure if I'm really feeling that, but that's what's going to happen.

1214
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,000
That's what's going to happen.

1215
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:35,000
And it's set to release now on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, as well as PC on February 23,

1216
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:39,000
at least on the console versions, and then March for PC.

1217
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:43,000
They're not bringing it out to last gen platforms though.

1218
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,000
And I got to be honest, I'm pretty excited usually about Far Cry games.

1219
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Not feeling anything for this one.

1220
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
It should have been Blood Dragon 2.

1221
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Then I might have given it a shit.

1222
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
But it's not.

1223
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Well, let's see here.

1224
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:07,000
American Dad is now being turned into a pinball table in Zen Pinball 2's Balls of Glory pack.

1225
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:14,000
That's going to be also joining, I guess, other Fox shows, including Family Guy and Bob's Burgers.

1226
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
And yeah, so that would be pretty cool.

1227
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:22,000
And then finally, Star Wars Battlefront.

1228
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,000
The beta is going to be extended through Tuesday.

1229
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
A whole day.

1230
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,000
So now you have until the 13th to play the game.

1231
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
I don't know.

1232
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
I played a little bit of Battlefront.

1233
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
The old one, kind of liked it.

1234
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:41,000
This I'm not hearing is, it basically seems like it's reskinned Battlefield.

1235
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:46,000
That's what I'm hearing on Facebook is that it's like, and Twitter, it's just Battlefield with Star Wars.

1236
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
I'm fine with that.

1237
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
But I would think that's what some people want.

1238
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Yeah, I'm fine with that, but I don't know.

1239
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:56,000
I don't like the fact that it doesn't really have a single player portion of it, but whatever.

1240
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Alright.

1241
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Well, do you guys remember that interesting Nintendo PlayStation prototype?

1242
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
No, remember when Sony and Nintendo were working together?

1243
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:11,000
And just a couple months ago, some guy found it like in an old storage thing somewhere.

1244
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
And he found this and was making YouTubes of it.

1245
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Well, there's an interesting follow up to this.

1246
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Is that he's actually going to go public and bring this console out for public viewing.

1247
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
But what's interesting is where it's going to be.

1248
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
It's going to be at a Hong Kong gaming event.

1249
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Retro.HK.

1250
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:33,000
But this part's really cool and this must be how the people convinced him to come out.

1251
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,000
So, what's going to happen is that the console is going to go to Retro.HK.

1252
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Professionals are going to look at it to see what's inside and if any functionality possibly remains with the device.

1253
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Because remember, I think he was kind of paranoid to use it because it might short circuit.

1254
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
I'm soon to remember.

1255
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,000
So, he's going to have some experts actually take a look at it.

1256
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:04,000
This feels to me like an episode of Pawn Shop or something where the experts are going to look at it to see if it really is valuable or if it's, you know.

1257
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Pawn Stars.

1258
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,000
That's it, Pawn Stars.

1259
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
Which that show was pretty cool.

1260
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
Yeah, I have to admit.

1261
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Now when I see a Pawn Shop in Reno or something, I'm always like,

1262
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,000
You never know what you're going to find.

1263
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
You find some gaming stuff at some of those places.

1264
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Also completely off topic.

1265
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Sure.

1266
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
You know how they called the one guy, Chumlee?

1267
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
I forget, but sure.

1268
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Well, I was from Tennessee Tuxedo and that always made me like the show, so whatever.

1269
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
There you go, alright.

1270
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Obscure reference.

1271
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,000
Alright, moving on.

1272
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Half Life 3.

1273
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Now that I have your attention, no Half Life 3 was not announced.

1274
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:49,000
But Valve, apparently trolling people at this point, there was a file update to Dota 2 called HL3.txt.

1275
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:58,000
And HL3.txt is just some miscellaneous codes, but there's some references to virtual reality, procedural generation, and co-op NPCs.

1276
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:04,000
But for all we know, this is just Valve being dicks and putting a file in here so that people go crazy.

1277
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Or could it be the beginnings of an ARG for Half Life 3?

1278
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Let's be honest though.

1279
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
They are fans of that though.

1280
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:18,000
I hope it's either something that accidentally got in there, which I doubt it, or like an ARG thing.

1281
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,000
But if it's just them being dicks, that's kind of fucked up.

1282
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
I mean, if you ask me, it's like, okay, listen.

1283
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:27,000
People are fans about your shit and you're going to troll people with this.

1284
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
How do you get off on this shit?

1285
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:35,000
I mean, it's like, seriously, people are entrusting you to come out with something really cool.

1286
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:38,000
And fuck, you haven't really released anything in quite a while.

1287
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,000
I don't know, that's kind of a fucked up thing to do.

1288
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,000
But sure, if it's just a joke, then fuck you.

1289
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
I don't know though.

1290
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,000
They seem to be pretty happy with doing those ARGs and everything.

1291
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:00,000
I mean, they did a couple of really crazy ones with Portal, remember?

1292
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Yeah, there were some pretty cool Portal ARGs, so who knows?

1293
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Or it could just be that there's something else that's HL3 that has nothing to do with Half Life 3.

1294
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Like, you know, it isn't that huge.

1295
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Really, they should have just named it HL3 underscore not Half Life 3.

1296
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Sorry.

1297
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Alright, well, moving on to, hey, DDR-related news, if you can believe it.

1298
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:31,000
No, there's not a new game or anything, but people playing DDR for charity.

1299
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:38,000
And they did this event last year, it was called DDR4LLS, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.

1300
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:46,000
They're going to do it again October the 17th, starting at 9am Pacific Time, raising some money for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.

1301
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:50,000
It looks like they're going to be doing a DDR X3 marathon featuring requests.

1302
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:55,000
And there'll be folks emceeing the stream, and they say they're going to run it Desert Bus style,

1303
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,000
where donations will keep the stream going longer.

1304
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
So the more they raise, the longer they're going to dance.

1305
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:05,000
I only have seen this on Facebook, and it doesn't have a short URL.

1306
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:11,000
So you'll have to try to find this DDR charity stream, the 2.015.

1307
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Or I'm sure Dark Tetsuya, if he's listening, he'll post the link there in the chatroom.

1308
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:20,000
So you guys can check that out and make a bookmark and a note to check that out for a good cause.

1309
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,000
So there you go, Dark Sakura.

1310
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Well, we like our SEGA stuff, and apparently Nintendo knows we like our SEGA stuff.

1311
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:38,000
For the 25th anniversary of the SEGA Game Gear in Japan, it looks like there's going to be a Game Gear themed Nintendo 3DS.

1312
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:44,000
They don't have a release date on it yet, but they did tease pictures of it on this SEGA Twitter.

1313
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:51,000
So, hooray! It looks alright, you know, but I have a Game Gear, so why do I need that?

1314
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Also, there's another game, and I actually own this game.

1315
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:59,000
The Revolutionary Girl Utena game that came out on SEGA Saturn.

1316
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:07,000
It was pretty fun, and it had the full motion video and some fun stuff and the full intro and everything.

1317
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:12,000
But people apparently really, really like it.

1318
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:17,000
And so they are starting to do a fan translation.

1319
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,000
You can download the translation online.

1320
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:27,000
They've done 100% of the script text and some of the graphic interface as well.

1321
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,000
So I'm kind of curious.

1322
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:36,000
I mean, I own this game. I've played through it in Japanese, so who knows?

1323
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,000
And also, Stephen Colbert.

1324
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:45,000
Now, he is, you know, a pretty decent, I'd say, video game fan.

1325
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
You know, he does stuff for us.

1326
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:52,000
We talked last week about the contrast between what he said and what Jimmy Kimmel said about it,

1327
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,000
because he had PewDiePie on, and he was actually kind of respectful about it,

1328
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,000
whereas, you know, Jimmy Kimmel had made some pretty controversial statements.

1329
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,000
I just love Stephen Colbert. Good lord, that man's great.

1330
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
He's pretty cool.

1331
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:14,000
So anyway, he is actually going to be playing some of the music on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on October 13th.

1332
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:19,000
He's supposed to be playing some of the music from The Legend of Zelda, Symphony of the Goddesses.

1333
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:25,000
So I definitely want to tune in and listen to that. So very cool.

1334
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Yeah, I'm even more impressed with Stephen Colbert for getting something like that on the show.

1335
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
That's a heck of a music guest.

1336
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:37,000
My friend Dave Letterman had Hatsune Miku, and that was, like, such a big deal.

1337
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Like, it's interesting that now we're getting more, like, video game-based guests on shows.

1338
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,000
That's really rad, though. I'm looking forward to seeing that.

1339
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,000
You know Stephen Colbert has probably played a game or two of Zelda in his time.

1340
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
So very cool.

1341
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,000
All right. Well, let's get to the foogle question of the week.

1342
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:57,000
You take Facebook and Google Plus and slam them together, and you get foogle.

1343
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
It's right here.

1344
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:12,000
This week for our foogle question of the week, we wanted to expand on what we talked about at the beginning of the show tonight with Guitar Hero's new DLC.

1345
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Guitar Hero Live this week announced an interesting new plan for DLC.

1346
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Taking a cue from Spotify, you will no longer download DLC to own permanently, but stream songs using currency in-game or with real money to purchase the right to play songs on demand.

1347
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,000
It's a little hard to explain, so we linked the official post for people.

1348
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,000
We wanted to know, what did you guys think about the new method of DLC?

1349
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Do you like the idea of discoverability behind it and the idea that we usually download these songs to play them just a couple times?

1350
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Or is this a dangerous direction for DLC to head?

1351
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:49,000
So over on Facebook, William Murderface said, this is an interesting idea for this genre, but I don't think it could translate well to other genres.

1352
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:55,000
The idea that you could have a Pandora of Guitar Hero and earn credits to be able to gain streaming rights is kind of cool.

1353
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
And likely will encourage discovery.

1354
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:04,000
That being said, translating this onto other genres without testing and adjustment would be a very, very bad idea.

1355
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Silent Tom said, I think it would be okay if you just pay a monthly rate for all songs to access songs like Spotify, as long as it's a very long song list.

1356
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Just so you know, Silent Tom, I think they are going to have something like that for maybe not for a month, but for a couple days, like for people having parties and stuff.

1357
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Justin or Master Claw replied and said, when I was playing a lot of Rock Band, I used to wish that there was a subscription that allowed access to the entire music library for a monthly fee.

1358
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:38,000
If you got to choose what songs you can play, it would have been a good move for them, but not a limited selection.

1359
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:50,000
I'm still not getting Guitar Hero, I've always preferred Rock Band and I already have hundreds of dollars in songs and instruments and several years of experience invested in the harmonics franchise.

1360
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Of course, I don't have an Xbox One or a Playstation 4, so it's a moot point.

1361
01:29:54,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Fifth Dream says, I had Guitar Hero preordered for a long time. I changed my mind at the last minute and bought Rock Band 4 instead this week, and this was part of the reason.

1362
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:12,000
It seems Guitar Hero Live is only having a temporary set of random songs that changes over time, and not a dependable set of songs that you know, like, and will enjoy playing.

1363
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:19,000
There is a reason I don't listen to the radio anymore. I rarely like what other people decide I'm supposed to listen to.

1364
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:31,000
I guess I'm that guy or I'm just old, but I got Rock Band 4, the first Rock Band game I've ever played, and spent a lot of money on past DLC to get a set of 60 or so songs I already know I love and had a blast playing them.

1365
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:41,000
In other words, this subscription DLC for songs I can't predict I'll even like really sounds like a bad idea and turned me off of the game completely, and I cancelled my Guitar Hero Live preorder.

1366
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Wow, that's voting with your wallet, that's for sure.

1367
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Andy R. replied and said, a new plan for DLC. Is it new? Based on what they're saying, it sounds similar to the system in Tap Sonic on mobile, which was free, not $90.

1368
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:04,000
Yeah, and I think we talked about that a little bit at the beginning of the show is that this is more of something that you would see in mobile games, but yes, very fair point.

1369
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Mobile games are also oftentimes free, and this is not free.

1370
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:22,000
A couple answers over on Google+, including Rettertainment, who says, I just tried searching around for a price on Guitar Hero TV, including looking at the game's official site, and was unable to find one.

1371
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:33,000
This isn't right. For the DLC, we are told the price up front. For Spotify, we're told the price up front. For most any other product available through a legitimate company or person, we're told the price up front.

1372
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Why am I not able to find the price for GHTV?

1373
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:46,000
That's a very excellent point, and I guess the easy answer to that is, well, I mean, on the day the game releases, the news will be everywhere about how much it costs.

1374
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:54,000
But, I totally understand the point that, well, everybody wants you to pre-order the game. Pre-order the bundle. Guarantee that you're going to get a copy of the game.

1375
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:59,000
And I think it's fair to say, well, what's the true cost of the game, because you're not being up front about it.

1376
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:03,000
So, I think that's a very fair point Rettertainment raises there.

1377
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:10,000
ActDeaf, last but not least, says, this idea sounds neat in concept. We'll have to see how it works in practice.

1378
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:19,000
I do think it's a great idea, especially since you don't have to actually pay real money to play them just for a few sessions, or just want to see if a song is actually worth buying or not.

1379
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:23,000
But hopefully the prices aren't too high, and the in-game currency isn't really hard to obtain.

1380
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:33,000
I do also think that this should be a choice. If someone wants to buy and own the song, so you can play it whenever you want, instead of paying each time, you want to play it.

1381
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:47,000
And yeah, with a lot of music, I don't think Spotify lets you buy songs, but Apple Music certainly would link you over to iTunes and let you buy the song for $1.29 or whatever it is that you are going to pay for the song.

1382
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:52,000
So, yeah. It would be interesting if you could actually do it both ways.

1383
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Anyway, some really good answers there. Thank you guys for participating with our FUGL Question of the Week.

1384
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:08,000
And if you want to answer for next week, I usually post those on Sunday afternoon over on Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio and Google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio.

1385
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:15,000
We've got some more news. Let's get right back into it. Loki's got to put down Mario Maker and read the next story for us.

1386
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:22,000
Alright, so the next thing we've got, let's talk a little bit about HoloLens.

1387
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:29,000
I swear, it's kind of like the whole Elder Scrolls Online thing. The more I hear about, the less excited I am.

1388
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:40,000
So now they were talking about the dev kits that are coming out, and unlike the Oculus Rift, where I was like, ooh, I've got to get me a piece of that dev kit, I'm not going to do that with this.

1389
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:47,000
That's because the dev kits, first off, start at $3,000. And they're going to be shipping, I guess, the first quarter of 2016.

1390
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:52,000
So if you're interested in making something for HoloLens, that's what it's going to cost you.

1391
01:33:52,000 --> 01:34:01,000
And, yeah, I don't know. And I'm still kind of pissed off that they're not really upfront with the field of view on that.

1392
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Because all these demonstrations that they showed, they're just kind of, we have a special camera that we're filming everything with.

1393
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:17,000
And it's allowing you to see what's going on. It doesn't represent what you can see actually with the device.

1394
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:24,000
And it's like, how long are you going to keep this charade up? I guess until it comes out.

1395
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:29,000
I just hope it improves. I hope they are able to make that device something pretty nice.

1396
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Originally I'm pretty excited about it, but until that field of view is adequate, then I'm not really jumping on board with it.

1397
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, HoloLens will suck for games.

1398
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:48,000
That's a pretty strong statement from someone who's been following a lot of this VR stuff.

1399
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:53,000
And yes, I realize HoloLens is not VR, but it's adjacent in my mind.

1400
01:34:53,000 --> 01:35:02,000
It would be cool for just PC stuff, but yeah, it's just not, I don't know. What they're showing is not exciting.

1401
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:07,000
I'm wondering if it's one of those things, and this happens a lot with Kinect and so forth.

1402
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:12,000
The first version will not be that great, but the second version, and to be fair, this isn't just Microsoft.

1403
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Yeah, the first version will be that great, and they'll say, oh, but the second version will do everything that you want it to do.

1404
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:21,000
And the second version won't be that great, and then they'll just drop it. Like it never happened.

1405
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
We'll see what happens.

1406
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Alright, well this week, some folks were surprised to see that Destiny suddenly appeared on their PlayStation 4.

1407
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:37,000
But here's the deal. It's not that you just suddenly were given a free copy of Destiny.

1408
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Destiny was inserted into your bar like any other game because it's basically Sony advertising to you.

1409
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:46,000
That's what they call featured content.

1410
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:56,000
And if you didn't turn it off, PlayStation 4 will put things that it thinks you're going to like, which I don't, it sounds like everybody got Destiny.

1411
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,000
I don't know. It's going to put it right there on the bar.

1412
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:03,000
Now, remember, if you don't like this stuff, you can turn it off.

1413
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:09,000
In the settings menu, you go to system, automatic downloads, and uncheck the box that says featured content.

1414
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:13,000
So this kind of stuff will not happen in the future if that pissed you off this week.

1415
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Or maybe you liked it. I don't know.

1416
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,000
It didn't piss me off, but it's just like, what the fuck is this?

1417
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:20,000
You know, I hope I didn't download anything to go along with it.

1418
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Right.

1419
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Because, you know, it said featured content. Does that mean it downloaded that shit to my fucking system?

1420
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Isn't it just a link to the store?

1421
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:29,000
I think it's just a link.

1422
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Yeah, because I turned that off a long time ago.

1423
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Well, because I clicked on it and I'm like, what is this? Are they offering this for free or something? Is this like a demo? What the fuck is this?

1424
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
And then I was like, oh, link to buy it. Nope.

1425
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:44,000
So a lot of people were surprised at kind of the positioning of that this week. I think it's the first time.

1426
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Alan Alchemy in chat says, is this like when U2 forced their album onto people's iPhones and everyone was like, get your geriatric Irish bullshit off my shit. What the fuck?

1427
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Hey now, U2's an okay band.

1428
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:07,000
No, because that was different. The U2 thing actually downloaded that album completely, which didn't happen.

1429
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:18,000
With Destiny. The whole Destiny game was not downloaded and it certainly wasn't free. That was just a, it was more of a clever ad, I suppose, for lack of a better term.

1430
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
All right, let's move on. Dark Sakura.

1431
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Well, for people who have been waiting for this, there is kind of sorta support for Cortana in Xbox One.

1432
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:41,000
It's not actually, the voice assistant isn't supposed to be available until 2016. However, some people have figured out how to kinda get her working.

1433
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:50,000
You can go into the settings menu and going up and mashing the A button multiple times.

1434
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:57,000
It doesn't give you the full number of commands, but it gives you some of them, like accessing your calendar.

1435
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:12,000
It's really just a minor thing, but it's there. So they've got the beginning hints of it installed, so I guess that's a pretty good thing if you're interested in stuff like that.

1436
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Loki.

1437
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:24,000
I'm not interested in that thing. Like I said, I have that on my Windows 10 PC or laptop and it doesn't do anything.

1438
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:31,000
I called Siri, Cortana, just to see what would happen. It was pretty funny. I got a thing that said, haha, very funny, but not funny.

1439
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Not funny. Note to self, murder you in your sleep.

1440
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:42,000
No, I'm actually kinda curious. Now hold on. Hey, Cortana, tell me something.

1441
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,000
Hello.

1442
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,000
Okay, she answered to it. Never mind.

1443
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Ah, Siri.

1444
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Oh, Siri. Why so Siri-ous? Haha.

1445
01:38:54,000 --> 01:39:06,000
So apparently according to the publisher of Harvest Moon, Natsume, they're saying that Game Boy games are not being converted to Virtual Console.

1446
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:22,000
There, Nintendo has gone and moved beyond that system because this was in regards to someone inquiring about one of their older games, Tailgater, whether that was going to be coming to Virtual Console, and they said, sorry, not going to happen.

1447
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:30,000
So if you're looking for some Game Boy games that didn't quite make it there, you're going to have to look to buy a Game Boy.

1448
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Why would you just stop that? I mean, were they not selling well at all or something? Like, I just, I don't understand where all the money...

1449
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
I don't either, because if...

1450
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,000
...cost is for this stuff. It doesn't make sense.

1451
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Yeah, seriously, because it's an emulator. Last I checked, emulators ran that game, so...

1452
01:39:51,000 --> 01:40:01,000
I mean, I know they do this, they do a manual, and they have to put together on the store, but I would seriously think it would be, like, one person's job.

1453
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:12,000
And are they not even making that much money to pay that one person? I mean, I don't know. Maybe I'm a little ignorant to this, but it just seems like the cost should not be that big for Virtual Console. It doesn't make sense at all.

1454
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,000
And you're making just tons of money off of this stuff. I mean, I don't know.

1455
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Bobby Blackwolf...

1456
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Or put the cost... Here's an idea. If the publisher wants to go through all that process and make those, why can't you let the publisher do that?

1457
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Good point. And Bobby Blackwolf in chat has a counterpoint here. I can answer your question, Skye, with one acronym, ESRB. That costs a lot to get that rating, and they have to get Virtual Console games rated by the ESRB.

1458
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:51,000
A fair point that I didn't consider is that they do get all those games rated, and because back in the day, the ESRB didn't exist for most of these games, so they can't, you know, they have to go back and, I guess, get them re-rated.

1459
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:59,000
Well, technically, do they have to? Because you can release an unrelated movie, but I guess there's probably some type of agreement.

1460
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Well, you have to, because it's their company policy not to release NR Games.

1461
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:07,000
But, okay, but you still bring up a point. What if Nintendo didn't pay for this, but the publishers did?

1462
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Exactly.

1463
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:21,000
Hmm. Interesting, though. S2100Matt says, it's just like movie ratings. Sometimes studios fight hard to get an under R rating. Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure. Interesting.

1464
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:33,000
Well, still, I mean, I would think they're making, but I guess obscure Game Boy games may not sell a whole lot of copies, so maybe that's why they decide not to do it.

1465
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Maybe they should discount, you know, certain things like that, you know, when they're doing ratings for these old-ass games. I don't know.

1466
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Yeah, but then are they really going to get that money back? I don't know. Because, you know, then they're making less money off each sale, so they really get the money back.

1467
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
No, I meant the ESRB should charge less.

1468
01:41:51,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Oh, well, but the ESRB, and Bobby Blackwell says the ESRB needs their money to put on E3, and especially as E3 is getting less and less relevant. I just added that part.

1469
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:12,000
Anyway, Jim Sallee in chat over at live.vognetware.com. So good to hear from him. Jim Sallee says, I can rate all virtual console games right now. They suck.

1470
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,000
Hey, now. Earthbound doesn't suck.

1471
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Is that S for suck?

1472
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Rated S for suck.

1473
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Alright. Let's see. Somebody brought up Sonic earlier. It was one of the Frugal Question of the Week comments.

1474
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Well, Sonic actually had a Wii U exclusive version, Sonic Lost World. Well, guess what? It is no longer Wii U exclusive, but it didn't hop over to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1475
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:56,000
It's going to Steam. That's right. November 2nd, we'll see the Steam release of Sega Sonic Lost World. The game apparently will run at 60 frames a second with full PC gamepad support.

1476
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Also, it's going to come with a free copy of Sonic Racing Transformed, because why not? They just give that game away now. I think, didn't they do that in a Humble Bundle anyway?

1477
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:18,000
But anyway, the game launches on Steam on November 2nd. It will be 20 pounds. I'm assuming that is also like $19.99 in dollars here locally, but we'll see when it actually hits Steam.

1478
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:28,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetware.com, use the passphrase, face.

1479
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Jim Sally in chat says, more like Sonic Suck World. Tiger Claw says, I have Sonic Lost World, haven't yet got to play it, the Wii U version.

1480
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Well, you better play it or you might end up falling in that Steam pit where you end up buying a game just because you can.

1481
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Did me saying the words Humble Bundle cause you to go to the site, Loki, to see if you needed to drop more money on something?

1482
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:58,000
No, I just wanted to see what the new games were in 15 that they were just... I didn't buy it because I think I have most of these already.

1483
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Yeah, I have a lot of the games in that pack. I mean, yay, it's for charity and all that, but yeah, I don't know if I could...

1484
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:13,000
That's also why I'm not jumping on the Humble Monthly, because it's like, dude, I probably have most of those.

1485
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Dungeon Buster in chat, speaking of Sonic, says the Sonic Boom cartoon series was also renewed for a second season.

1486
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Well, how about that?

1487
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,000
That just proves kids will watch anything.

1488
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Alright, let's get to the mailbag. Every week, Dark Sakura dives into the mailbag headfirst and pulls out emails that she thinks are rad and worth sharing, if there are any.

1489
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,000
I thought there was at least one in there. I don't know, Dark Sakura, do we have an email tonight to read?

1490
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
There's one.

1491
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Just one. Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to fill up the mailbox for a future week.

1492
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,000
Hello, LR, which means this is from YYR.

1493
01:44:49,000 --> 01:45:03,000
Last week, there was a brief discussion on the possibility of Japanese shoot-'em-up or SHMUP developer CAVE turning to crowdfunding to bring more games to Steam and or PS4, or perhaps even developing something new, but not for cheap.

1494
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:09,000
SHMUPs, unfortunately, with regard to gameplay depth, do not look like much to the average or casual player.

1495
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:15,000
But in reality, it takes cat-like reflexes, nerves of steel- by the way, cat-like, not my cat.

1496
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Anyway, um, nerves of steel and the ability to discern and memorize patterns and several dozen hours to be able to actually complete a well-designed SHMUP in one credit, the way it was meant to be played.

1497
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:33,000
To be able to design a game of this sort takes many, many times longer and a lot of experience.

1498
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Anyone can throw together a shooting game with random enemy placement to actually make a game of this type that plays well as something not just anyone can do.

1499
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:57,000
The music is usually created by composers outside the company, the sound effects are created to perfectly match the action, and the graphics usually consist of hand-drawn, hand-animated sprites from the player characters all the way down to the tiniest popcorn enemies.

1500
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:01,000
All of this takes a ton of work and, therefore, money.

1501
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:11,000
So this is why I don't believe three million dollars is an unreasonable amount of money to conceive, design, develop, and release an original SHMUP for consoles.

1502
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Unfortunately, this genre is not as popular as it once was, even in Japan, so CAVE has had some money troubles over the last couple of years.

1503
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Therefore, crowdfunding might be the only way we'll ever see another original game from them.

1504
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:33,000
If you enjoy this sort of game, even a little, I'd encourage you to toss a few bucks their way, and a few bucks their way if they ask for it. I know I will.

1505
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Keep on shooting, AaronYYR.

1506
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Okay. We made the point. That's totally what I was, you know, thinking.

1507
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:45,000
No, it's a fair point. You know, games aren't cheap to make, that's for sure.

1508
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:56,000
You know, I guess it's tricky though, because I do feel like some people have made some pretty competent shooters on a lower budget, just being a team of like one or two people.

1509
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:03,000
But I also understand there's a difference, you know, especially the bullet hell SHMUP stuff that really goes to the cult status.

1510
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Yeah, it definitely has all those things that you're talking about, you know, and especially things like composers and so forth.

1511
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:16,000
And hey, voice actors might get really expensive here pretty soon, if, you know, that's even a possibility with what DarkestHacker was talking about earlier.

1512
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:26,000
So, you know, yeah, games aren't free to make for big companies that, you know, want to pay their people so they can, you know, feed their families and stuff.

1513
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:33,000
So, makes sense. So yeah, if you enjoy that genre and want to see a new game, I can see where the crowdfunding comes in.

1514
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Just hopefully, you know, the slippery slope with crowdfunding, just because, you know, it's the same company with the same reputation, doesn't mean it's necessarily going to be good.

1515
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:48,000
And that's what we're hearing with Mighty No. 9, some people not into it based off the demo, like a little let down.

1516
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:53,000
I'm going to say this, slippery slope arguments are by their nature fallacious.

1517
01:47:53,000 --> 01:48:02,000
I would say, look, the only way that we're going to know if it's going to be successful or not for them to just do it.

1518
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:09,000
And if it opens, yeah, someone's always going to be out there to take advantage of an idea or try to cash in on it.

1519
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:19,000
But you have to also think that if this is the only way to get it out, if there's no other possible way, then they should, we should encourage them.

1520
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Yeah, but in Ifune's Mighty No. 9, I mean, I don't think he was ever out to rip anybody off or anything, but maybe learned a lot of hard lessons along the way.

1521
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:34,000
And I think it has caused people who donated to that game, even though it's not, the game isn't even out yet, for one, it's not a shooter.

1522
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:42,000
I feel like you're seeing this on Facebook and Twitter, you can already feel the repercussions that the game being delivered is not what people expected.

1523
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,000
And that's going to have an impact on all video game Kickstarters.

1524
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:49,000
It, I think it is and it will and won't be.

1525
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:56,000
It's just a matter of, I mean, for example, how many games have you bought that just didn't turn out to be what you thought they'd be?

1526
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
I bought one this week.

1527
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:05,000
Okay, so this really isn't anything that different, you know.

1528
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,000
True.

1529
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:11,000
Yeah, and there were always beta releases out for the game for Mighty No. 9.

1530
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:15,000
People had ideas of what they were getting into if they had the beta access.

1531
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:25,000
And then for the other releases coming out, I mean, if you had just gone out and found it on the shelf and bought it, would it have been what you thought it was going to be?

1532
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
There's really no difference.

1533
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:30,000
I'm going to our chat over at live.vog.network.com.

1534
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Dungeonbuster says, Caves shmups are pretty legendary production-wise.

1535
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:37,000
They lavish a ton of art, sound, and action in their game.

1536
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,000
And bullets.

1537
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
So many bullets.

1538
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Sg100matt says, I just hope all Kickstarters and people thinking of video game crowdfunding learn from these mistakes.

1539
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,000
That's all I ask.

1540
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:50,000
I was happy with Espa-galuda that I could never quite say right.

1541
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Espa-galuda?

1542
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,000
Espa-galuda.

1543
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Espa-galuda.

1544
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Espa-galuda.

1545
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,000
I played a crap ton of Espa-galuda.

1546
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Beluga Whale 2.

1547
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
I can't say it.

1548
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Alright.

1549
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:08,000
If you have some further comments on this or what have you, you can always email us.

1550
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

1551
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,000
And that's it for emails.

1552
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:14,000
We didn't get a lot this week.

1553
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com if you want to send us another one.

1554
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

1555
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Every week we get angsty on the show because reasons.

1556
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:57,000
A big FU to people who expect that if you see two characters in a movie or book or anything,

1557
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:02,000
that the moment that they show any kind of real affection for each other, it means they're fucking.

1558
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:03,000
No.

1559
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
It doesn't mean they're fucking.

1560
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
It means they have a close relationship.

1561
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Why ruin it?

1562
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,000
The end.

1563
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:13,000
You can do whatever you want with your head cannon.

1564
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:19,000
But it says a pretty awful thing about society to say.

1565
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
Alright, Loki.

1566
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Effie to bad drivers.

1567
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:26,000
Especially people that, okay, you maybe missed your turn or something like that.

1568
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Don't fucking cut over all the lanes to make your turn.

1569
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Oh shit, I'm going in the off-ramp and I'm in the rightmost lane.

1570
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Let me cut across all those lanes to get out of the off-ramp.

1571
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
I hate you people.

1572
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:43,000
And I was behind all you people today.

1573
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
You suck.

1574
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Alright Shane, I have to hear this FU that you have tonight.

1575
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Okay, so FU to whatever head problems I'm having right now because today we went out toy hunting

1576
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:00,000
and I bought some donuts and we had some donuts but I had two left over.

1577
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:04,000
I had a maple one and this weird mint Oreo one.

1578
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Both looked really good.

1579
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:14,000
So when I got back, I got out of the car and I got dizzy and oops, they fell all over the driveway.

1580
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
I was so sad.

1581
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
You dropped the donuts.

1582
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Yes, I really wanted the maple one and I was just kind of interested in the mint one.

1583
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
Well, you know what this means.

1584
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
You have to go back and get more donuts.

1585
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Where was this at?

1586
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
Java time over Maguna.

1587
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I'm gonna have to go.

1588
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
They have all sorts of crazy donuts.

1589
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:39,000
The Oreo one looked like, I just gained a pound looking at it.

1590
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:41,000
Well, I could eat half a donut.

1591
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
You could lick some of it off of the driveway.

1592
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
I kind of wanted to do that.

1593
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:49,000
I wanted to be like, Shane, I just want to do this bat with the rest of the donuts.

1594
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Shane, we should go and I'd have half a donut.

1595
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
We could go tomorrow.

1596
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Okay, I may have to meet someone at lunch but let's go tomorrow.

1597
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Okay.

1598
01:52:58,000 --> 01:52:59,000
We'll have breakfast of donuts.

1599
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Okay.

1600
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Alright.

1601
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
Sorry, Rob.

1602
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
I didn't even finish.

1603
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,000
Sorry, G.

1604
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
So FU to Rob for turning off the music before I was done.

1605
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
I didn't even give mine yet but go ahead.

1606
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Yeah, but you still turned the music off.

1607
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
And FU to Toys R Us for not getting their act together

1608
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:17,000
and getting me the Power Ranger toys I deserve

1609
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:20,000
because one of the stores had them one day

1610
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:23,000
and I missed out and got two instead of all five

1611
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
and now nobody's getting them

1612
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:31,000
and I just want to be very mad and yell at them.

1613
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Alright.

1614
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
My FU of the Week goes to Shane for being an enabler.

1615
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Heroes Power.

1616
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Both with donuts and amiibo.

1617
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Heroes Power.

1618
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
Not something you can control.

1619
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,000
That's really it.

1620
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:43,000
Things are awesome otherwise.

1621
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
I guess FU to my voice this morning

1622
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
because I did Rocky last night and I actually sound okay now

1623
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:50,000
because I had some hot coffee and all that.

1624
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
But yeah, boy oh boy.

1625
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:53,000
But it was a great show.

1626
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
I can't say anything FU about that

1627
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:58,000
and I'm very excited about Sinister Creature Con here in Sacramento

1628
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,000
here locally if you're a local listener.

1629
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
I will be there at Sinister Creature Con this weekend

1630
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
in Sacramento at Scottish Rite

1631
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:07,000
and also hosting Rocky Horror again on Halloween.

1632
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
So there's my cheap plug.

1633
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,000
FU to cheap plug.

1634
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Steal with it.

1635
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Alright.

1636
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Let's get to a couple more stories here

1637
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:18,000
before we take your calls at 1877 Game OLR

1638
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:19,000
or username on Skype.

1639
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

1640
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:22,000
All one word.

1641
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:25,000
First we'll go over to Loki.

1642
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Yes, since we were talking about Mario Maker a little bit.

1643
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:34,000
There has been an individual that remade all of the e-reader levels

1644
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
from the Game Boy Advance version of the game

1645
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
and you can check them out now.

1646
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:42,000
So these are all the levels from Super Mario Advance 4

1647
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:46,000
and they're available to check out.

1648
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:51,000
There's a Reddit post in the Wii U thread

1649
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:54,000
that's got a Super Mario 3 e-card.

1650
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
It's all levels redone.

1651
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:00,000
And you can download or jot down all the different codes

1652
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,000
to download those levels to play them.

1653
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:04,000
That's pretty cool.

1654
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,000
I have to be honest.

1655
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
I totally forgot about the e-reader levels

1656
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:10,000
until this story and I was like, oh yeah.

1657
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:13,000
I've seen a lot of people remaking Super Mario Land levels too

1658
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
even though they can't really

1659
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
because there was different mechanics in Super Mario Land

1660
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:21,000
but it's interesting to see people doing that I think.

1661
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
All right.

1662
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:27,000
Well, speaking of Mario Maker,

1663
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:30,000
is the creator mad at you for all the hard levels

1664
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
that you're making in Mario Maker?

1665
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,000
I hope so.

1666
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Lead producer Takashi Tezuka has stated some opinions in Edge Magazine

1667
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,000
saying, quote,

1668
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
There is a tendency for the courses people make

1669
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:46,000
to be a little harder than they think they are.

1670
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
The creator already knows the design,

1671
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:51,000
where they've placed their traps, and the best route to take.

1672
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:54,000
So it would generally be easier for them to play through

1673
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
than someone trying it for the first time.

1674
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,000
As a result, the course ends up being more difficult

1675
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
than the creator meant it to be.

1676
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
You know, I think that's exactly what happened with my Bowser Man level.

1677
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:06,000
I didn't set out for it to be so hard

1678
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:10,000
but because I designed it, I kind of knew the easy way through it

1679
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:14,000
and I got poop drawn on my level by Japanese players because of it.

1680
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:15,000
So I guess I learned my lesson.

1681
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Yeah, but we learned it from you

1682
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
because you made Super Mario Brothers 2

1683
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
which we call the lost levels here.

1684
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
We learned it from you!

1685
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Yeah, that's right. We learned it from you, Japan,

1686
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:26,000
so stop pooping on my levels.

1687
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Like, actually pooping on my levels.

1688
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:33,000
I just heard the tale end when you were looking at it.

1689
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Oh, look! A Japanese comment!

1690
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
It's poop!

1691
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Poop is universal, Rob.

1692
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
Should I report that comment or should I favorite it?

1693
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
You should favorite it.

1694
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:44,000
I'm going to favorite it.

1695
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Alright.

1696
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:46,000
That would be great.

1697
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
Try with more poop.

1698
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Like, we can have a conversation in poop.

1699
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Anyway, somebody's listening to OLR for the first time

1700
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:00,000
going, what the fuck podcast did I subscribe to?

1701
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,000
I'm probably going to have some splainin' to do at work.

1702
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:06,000
It's like pissing into an ocean of piss.

1703
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Oh, I'm sorry. That's right.

1704
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:10,000
You said you might have friends listening tonight.

1705
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Hi, Travis!

1706
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Whoops!

1707
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,000
Hi, Travis.

1708
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Alright.

1709
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Anyhow, oh, I do want to point out, though,

1710
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Tezuka did not finish his thought with that,

1711
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
so let's hear the other half, because it's important.

1712
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,000
I've been watching lots of different courses on YouTube.

1713
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:26,000
It was quite a surprise how much fun it was to watch the videos

1714
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
without even playing myself.

1715
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:31,000
There are so many intriguing and inventive courses,

1716
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:34,000
like one which you couldn't beat if you picked up a mushroom.

1717
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,000
It's been a huge motivation for us developers to do better.

1718
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,000
That's so amazing that you watch videos on YouTube

1719
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
of other people playing levels,

1720
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:45,000
and you thought that was amazing and inspired people to play the game.

1721
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Oh, my God!

1722
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:50,000
You mean that there's some merit to these fucking levels?

1723
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,000
You fucking idiot!

1724
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:54,000
You fuck, fuck, fucking idiots!

1725
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
And I know it's not you in particular,

1726
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:01,000
but fuck the people that are in the fucking higher-up chain of Nintendo for...

1727
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Yeah.

1728
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Dark Sakura, sigh all you want,

1729
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
but that was a pretty fucking good zing.

1730
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:07,000
That was.

1731
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
You're going to need some ointment for that burn.

1732
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
I hope you know that, you know,

1733
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Nintendo's making money off of that ad revenue.

1734
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Thanks a lot, you know.

1735
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,000
I love it.

1736
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Some folks in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

1737
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Orange Wright says,

1738
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:28,000
You mean it would be beneficial to let people make YouTube videos of your games?

1739
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,000
Necessary100Matt says,

1740
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Keep going, Loki.

1741
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:34,000
And Act F has sounded the Loki O.L.R. rant alarm.

1742
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,000
There you go.

1743
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
Hey, you know what?

1744
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
I'm sorry if you blew your eardrums out,

1745
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
but the man has a very good point,

1746
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:46,000
and that was a good time to bring that up, so...

1747
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
It's just a little hypocritical of them.

1748
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:51,000
I mean, to be honest, this is the developer.

1749
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,000
It's not him personally.

1750
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
No, it's not him. It's not him.

1751
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
And let's be honest, this guy,

1752
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:59,000
he's probably a little bit more open-minded to everything than some of the management.

1753
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:02,000
But seriously, the management needs to kind of get on board with that.

1754
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:03,000
That's ridiculous.

1755
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:04,000
That's a really good call-out.

1756
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
I'm surprised more journalists didn't pick up on that.

1757
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:07,000
All right.

1758
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
Anyhow, that's it.

1759
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:12,000
That actually brings us to our last story, appropriately.

1760
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
But we are going to open up the Skype line.

1761
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:17,000
We're actually to the last part of the show a little early tonight.

1762
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:18,000
We're going in pretty quick.

1763
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,000
We're starting late, too.

1764
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Yeah, we started late, too,

1765
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
because Bobby had his 500th episode, so it's worse.

1766
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Because you didn't let me talk about Power Rangers for an hour.

1767
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Well, here's your chance.

1768
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,000
We're waiting for a call, so...

1769
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
You remember when we were going to do a podcast about Mass Effect,

1770
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
and then that, like, didn't happen?

1771
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Yeah, I remember the pilot episode I actually guested on,

1772
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:34,000
and I was like, wow.

1773
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,000
It was because Rob was so bad on it.

1774
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:36,000
He was so bad on it.

1775
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:37,000
You guys really...

1776
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:40,000
You know, and some people I knew were like,

1777
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
how can you do a podcast about a game

1778
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:45,000
that is essentially going to be dormant for like five years?

1779
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Don't judge us.

1780
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:49,000
But after doing that first episode, I was like, wow.

1781
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:52,000
You could make a podcast out of this pretty regularly,

1782
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:53,000
and then you didn't.

1783
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Okay, but let's talk about something else real quick.

1784
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:57,000
Where is that episode?

1785
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Can we put it up somewhere so people can hear it?

1786
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
I think I have it somewhere on my computer.

1787
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,000
I don't think I have it.

1788
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
I found our show role from it, though.

1789
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,000
That's funny.

1790
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
Can we do, like, a long-lost Mass Effect?

1791
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,000
But what the hell was the show called?

1792
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:09,000
I forget.

1793
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,000
We called it.

1794
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,000
This is the best podcast on the Citadel.

1795
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Oh, we just had the best podcast on the Citadel.

1796
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
My favorite podcast on the Citadel.

1797
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
And I did the Corian voice, remember?

1798
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:19,000
I had the filter for the Corian voice.

1799
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,000
So I actually have news.

1800
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:21,000
What?

1801
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Because I forgot to say this earlier.

1802
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:28,000
The super awesome pre-orders for Super Beat Zonic

1803
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:31,000
went up a couple days ago,

1804
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:34,000
and that is made by the people that make DJ Max,

1805
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:37,000
since DJ Max is now something that doesn't exist anymore.

1806
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Was that that livestream you were watching the other night?

1807
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Yeah, they livestreamed it so we could kind of see what it's about,

1808
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:47,000
even though it still doesn't have, like, a release date beyond fall of this year.

1809
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:50,000
But they put up two versions beyond the regular.

1810
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:54,000
There's one that's $50 called the exclusive limited edition.

1811
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
It comes with the game and the soundtrack.

1812
02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:00,000
And there's one that's $100 that comes with the game,

1813
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:05,000
the soundtrack, and then the soundtrack on vinyl and a very fancy box.

1814
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:08,000
And the vinyl, it's two vinyls.

1815
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:11,000
And there's only 450 of those, 500 of the other.

1816
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:16,000
And there's also a golden ticket that they're putting into two of them.

1817
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:20,000
And if you get one of those tickets, you get the Corian limited edition,

1818
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:23,000
which I'm trying to pull up right now, because this is a Corian game

1819
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
because it's DJ Max people.

1820
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:28,000
The Corian limited edition makes all of us cry

1821
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:31,000
because we don't get these cool things.

1822
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
The Corian limited edition.

1823
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:37,000
You get the game in a huge box.

1824
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:42,000
You get either a blue Vita that we're getting from GameStop

1825
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
or an orange one, it looks like.

1826
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
They said red, but it looks orange.

1827
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:50,000
The soundtrack, no vinyl, all these little postcard things.

1828
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:53,000
It looks like a memory card as well, and it's very pretty.

1829
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:57,000
And I hope I get one of those golden tickets.

1830
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:00,000
Act Efton Chat says, do you get to go to the Willy Wonka factory with that golden ticket?

1831
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
I wouldn't want to.

1832
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,000
All the kids died. Well, they didn't die, they cartoon died.

1833
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
I never saw that movie, so I just don't want to go there.

1834
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
I read the book when I was a kid.

1835
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
The book was pretty good. I've read the book after that too.

1836
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:15,000
I just know the Futurama version of it.

1837
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:21,000
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

1838
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
I thought there were all these people that wanted to call in tonight,

1839
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
and it's dead on the line tonight.

1840
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:30,000
This is the part where I go, is the phone line working?

1841
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:33,000
And so I actually put in the number to call to make sure.

1842
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Oh, we have a call coming in.

1843
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Is that you calling us?

1844
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
No, it's not me. It says the name of the caller, so I'm going to get to it right now.

1845
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

1846
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
Hey, this is Act Eft.

1847
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:46,000
It's clearly Kirby. I'm looking at the picture.

1848
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Yeah, it's Act Eft wearing a Kirby disguise.

1849
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Oh.

1850
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Kirby swallowed Act Eft and now has Act Eft's voice and powers.

1851
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
We'll leave it to your imagination.

1852
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Act Eft, what are your powers?

1853
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Buying an amiibo, speaking Spanish, playing taiko, no tatsujin.

1854
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Yeah, all that stuff.

1855
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:15,000
His specialty is bartering for amiibo at the market in Spanish.

1856
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Yeah.

1857
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
There you go. I'm combining all those things into one thing.

1858
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
What's on your mind tonight, my friend?

1859
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Well, first, welcome to the amiibo club.

1860
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Gee.

1861
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:29,000
I swear, somebody's going to produce the audio clip of me a year ago going,

1862
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Fuck amiibo, fuck me, if I ever get into that amiibo thing, I want you to hit me upside the head with a baseball bat,

1863
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
or whatever I probably said a year ago, and now here I am.

1864
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
It took me longer than you.

1865
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:46,000
Well, now that I can walk into a store and there's a selection, it doesn't seem so irritating.

1866
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
You all right?

1867
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
I was going to say something.

1868
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:51,000
What were you going to say? What?

1869
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:54,000
I was going to say, but how many times have you walked into a store and found something,

1870
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:57,000
versus me looking for Power Rangers, texting, like, do you need this one?

1871
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
You know what? That's okay.

1872
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:04,000
If Shane wants to be my personal shopping assistant, I'm actually okay with that.

1873
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
That would be so fun to do.

1874
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:10,000
He may think it's his hero's power, but I'm making him do all the legwork for me.

1875
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Who's really better than me?

1876
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
It's not legwork for you when I'm looking for myself.

1877
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:17,000
And then, oh, no Power Rangers toys, let me look at the amiibos.

1878
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Okay, let me spread the amiibo around.

1879
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Now, he didn't talk about this on the show, but since we're stretching for time tonight,

1880
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:27,000
because we didn't fill three hours, I will point this out.

1881
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Shane also did me a favor, because I did Rocky Horror this weekend,

1882
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:38,000
and one of my cast members actually said, I'm looking for the Brad pop doll.

1883
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:41,000
You know those pop doll things? I have some of them here in studio,

1884
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:45,000
but they're the little pop culture things. They have the big heads and all that.

1885
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Well, they put out a Rocky Horror set, and this girl on cast, she's a big black girl,

1886
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:52,000
and she's amazing.

1887
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Is it from Monet?

1888
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:54,000
It's Monet, yeah.

1889
02:04:54,000 --> 02:05:01,000
And she played Brad, which is, if you picture it, is kind of humorous, but she sold it.

1890
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:05,000
She's one of my favorite Brad's I've ever seen in the role.

1891
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:09,000
So anyway, she wanted a Brad pop figure, and she couldn't find it.

1892
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
They had a bunch of them at Toys R Us.

1893
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:15,000
And that's why I said, wait a minute, Shane texted me a picture the other day.

1894
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:20,000
He saw those figures in a Toys R Us, and I thought it was very nice that Shane saw something Rocky Horror,

1895
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:24,000
and actually acknowledged it and sent it to me, because usually he's embarrassed on my behalf.

1896
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,000
It had some GameStop.

1897
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:30,000
But I said, Shane, hey, while you're out on your next toy run, I'm looking for this pop doll.

1898
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:35,000
If you find it, let me know. First store he goes to, he's like, I got you that Brad doll.

1899
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:40,000
And I gave it to her last night, and she was so, so, so happy. So there you go.

1900
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:41,000
Hooray, story.

1901
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:44,000
There you go. Anyway.

1902
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:48,000
So where were we? Did we ever get the question you were going to ask here?

1903
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
I don't even remember my question.

1904
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
He was just rubbing it in that you buy amiibos.

1905
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Oh yeah, that's right.

1906
02:05:54,000 --> 02:06:00,000
I was going to talk about this recent amiibo restock. It was pretty, pretty good.

1907
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
It's how it should always be, right?

1908
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:08,000
Doesn't it seem, though, I mean, not to be that jaded gamer, but oh fucking well,

1909
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:12,000
I guess I'm doing, I'm filling that role tonight.

1910
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Doesn't Nintendo always fucking do this?

1911
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:21,000
The first year is a shit show for trying to get the merchandise, like the Nintendo Wii itself,

1912
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:26,000
and then we're a year out, and oh, it's like there was never a problem in the first place.

1913
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:31,000
I mean, granted, you can't get every figure you want, but it's a lot more reasonable now

1914
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:35,000
than it was when these figures first came out. You know what I mean?

1915
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:39,000
Like, if you put a little effort into it, you can get just about anything you want,

1916
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:43,000
save some of the original pressings from a while ago, you know what I mean?

1917
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Or the ones you thought were going to be around for forever and somehow aren't anymore, Samus and Link.

1918
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Yeah, but Samus and Link weren't hard to find in the beginning.

1919
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
No, they weren't, and now it's like...

1920
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,000
Oops.

1921
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:54,000
Yeah.

1922
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,000
It's curious that Kirby is now one of the rarest ones to find.

1923
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Yep.

1924
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:02,000
You cannot find a Kirby right now, at least for a retail price.

1925
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:06,000
But they'll probably restock, you know, early next year. Amiibo aren't going to go away anytime soon,

1926
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
and Smash Brothers is by far the biggest line.

1927
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:11,000
The only thing is that I just worry Nintendo's like,

1928
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:15,000
oh, you know, we're not always going to have these out, we're going to offer cards instead.

1929
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:19,000
Well, if they can just do what they did this time with restocks and just do that for all of them,

1930
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:23,000
like, on a cycle, that would be fine too. I don't see a problem with that.

1931
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
I don't want cards. I want the figures.

1932
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:26,000
I don't want cards either.

1933
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:32,000
I mean, I get that the cards are a good way for people that want the functionality to be able to have,

1934
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:33,000
which is fine and dandy, but...

1935
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:37,000
I didn't even have a game that worked with Amiibo until just recently, but I've had Amiibo for forever, so...

1936
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:40,000
Do they work in Woolly World? I mean, I know the Yoshi's do.

1937
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:41,000
Yeah, they unlock costumes.

1938
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:46,000
I need to try my cards, because I have the card reader for my DS.

1939
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:50,000
But they work, the Yoshi gets costumes.

1940
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Oh, this is like Mario Maker.

1941
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Some of them are cute, some of them are frightening.

1942
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Yeah.

1943
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:59,000
I need to still go back to Mario Kart 8, because now I have all these Amiibo I didn't have before,

1944
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:03,000
and go unlock all the costumes I have yet to do. Anyway...

1945
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:09,000
Yeah, unlocking all the Amiibo costumes on Super Mario Maker, especially with all the ones I have,

1946
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
it was, like, kind of tedious.

1947
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Yeah, yeah.

1948
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Because, yeah, but...

1949
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:21,000
But, even though with the restock, hopefully, yeah, at least it's not gonna be hard to find,

1950
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:27,000
or at least some of the really hard to find will be easier.

1951
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:33,000
Hopefully it will get better, but we don't know. Hopefully it will, but who knows?

1952
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:36,000
Or more games that come out centered around those hard-to-find ones,

1953
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:43,000
like with the supposed villager restock coming on the 8th of next month in time for the Animal Crossing Wii U game.

1954
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:44,000
Yeah.

1955
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Or, like, maybe the Fire Emblem 4 will all come back when the Fates game comes out next year.

1956
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:54,000
I'm really curious to see, though, how this translates going into NX,

1957
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
because this has been so huge for Nintendo.

1958
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:57,000
They'll use it, for sure.

1959
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:03,000
They'll have Amiibo, but what scary thing are they gonna think of next for this, you know?

1960
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:06,000
As long as, I mean, at least the figures...

1961
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:10,000
$12 is really not a lot of money for those figures, when you think about it.

1962
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:11,000
I don't think so, anyway.

1963
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:14,000
I mean, that, okay, you remember that little, today at Toys R Us,

1964
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:17,000
they had that little 8-bit pillow that was, like, the link sprite?

1965
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:18,000
It was super cute, yeah.

1966
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:22,000
And, yeah, it looks cute, but then up close, I was like, it's a tiny pillow,

1967
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
and you kind of squeeze it, and it's not very soft.

1968
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:28,000
It's kind of a, I don't know what the hell it is, just something that would sit on a bookshelf or something.

1969
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
You know, it was $16.

1970
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Yeah.

1971
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:34,000
And I kind of think Amiibo are a better value than that pillow.

1972
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:37,000
It's one of those World of Nintendo ones, right?

1973
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Yeah, it was.

1974
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Yeah, I'm kind of surprised there's, like, a following for those,

1975
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:47,000
because some of them are really hard to find.

1976
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
Have you seen the Metroid one, the actual Metroid one?

1977
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Yes, that you can't find anywhere now.

1978
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Yeah, those are really hard to find.

1979
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
Yeah, that Metroid was so cute.

1980
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:59,000
I saw it once, I didn't think anything of it, and now I've never seen it again.

1981
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
Brad from Pod Culture says,

1982
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:05,000
I want the Power A Amiibo N-level display, but 30 bucks?

1983
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Is that the one I own?

1984
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:07,000
That's the one, yeah.

1985
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
I gotta say, I like that thing a lot, though.

1986
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,000
It is cool.

1987
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:11,000
It is really cute.

1988
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:12,000
I wish they'd make more things like it.

1989
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:13,000
I need more.

1990
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:16,000
I saw at Best Buy, they have warp pipes now that you can buy.

1991
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,000
What?

1992
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:21,000
Yeah, you can put warp pipes on, I'm not sure you can put them on those,

1993
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
but you can place them and put the Amiibo in them.

1994
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Okay, you might need to go to Best Buy for me tomorrow.

1995
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
I probably was going to go the best way.

1996
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:28,000
See what I mean?

1997
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:32,000
There's supposed to be more Amiibo displays like that one.

1998
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:36,000
There's one for Zelda, and I think there's one for Kirby.

1999
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:41,000
I remember seeing them, or at least reported on when it was the 3 this year.

2000
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:48,000
So yeah, there's going to be more of them, but they haven't been released other than the Mario one.

2001
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:52,000
Yeah, I don't know if you've seen the shelf that I'm now keeping my Amiibo on.

2002
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:56,000
I had to switch out from a table, now it's a shelf, and it's kind of like a weak shelf.

2003
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:02,000
It's like one of these really pick up, I need to get a legit better way to display my Amiibo, and it's kind of, I don't know.

2004
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
You think you have problems?

2005
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:08,000
Alan has to be rolling his eyes to the back of his head at this whole thing.

2006
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:09,000
I can hear it.

2007
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:17,000
Like I was saying, if you have problems, you should ask me, because I don't even have a really big space to handle all my Amiibo.

2008
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:22,000
I have them all over my room, so yeah.

2009
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:27,000
Brad from Pod Culture and Chat says, can anyone find a Mega Man Amiibo for me?

2010
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
I'm not paying scalper prices.

2011
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:38,000
I think Amazon has Mega Man for a decent price, if you don't care if it's American or Japanese.

2012
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:48,000
I see Mega Man in the wild occasionally still, so it might be a little hard to find, but I'll keep an eye out.

2013
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Alright, you gotta connect with Shane on Twitter, Brad.

2014
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:55,000
I wanted one until I scanned it in, and then I'm done, so I don't need one.

2015
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Aw, it's so cute. That was my second Amiibo I've ever had.

2016
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:03,000
And by the way, in Mario Maker, don't forget to push up, because the sprites all do different things when you push up.

2017
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,000
I didn't realize that until-

2018
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:05,000
Up and down.

2019
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:06,000
Oh, and down?

2020
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Yeah, and down as well.

2021
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:10,000
They do squatty things sometimes, depending on what it is.

2022
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:11,000
Alright.

2023
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:18,000
SJ100Matt in Chat says, if you have problems, Rob, I feel bad for you, son. I got 99 problems and having an Amiibo ain't one.

2024
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:19,000
Well, thank you.

2025
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
Because you can't stop at one Amiibo.

2026
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:24,000
Brad from Pod Culture says, Shane, grab one. I'll pay you back.

2027
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:32,000
You know, if you found one of these Power Ranger toys Shane is looking for, he'll buy you more than a Mega Man Amiibo, I'm sure.

2028
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
That sounded vaguely sexual.

2029
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
Not anything freaky. Alright.

2030
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:40,000
ActDeaf, I'm gonna let you go so we can try to get some more calls, but thanks for calling in.

2031
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
Hey, thanks for having me.

2032
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Yeah, take care, buddy.

2033
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:51,000
Alright. 1877GameOLR, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you want to give the show a call.

2034
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:56,000
Super jealous of the Korean box art for Super Beat Zonic. It looks so much better than ours.

2035
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:01,000
You know, some people are talking about Zonic in Chat, MXC saying, I preordered the Zonic edition, I'm bad.

2036
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:06,000
ActDeaf in Chat saying, it does look nice, I kind of want it.

2037
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:07,000
So, there you go.

2038
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,000
It's exciting.

2039
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:09,000
It is exciting.

2040
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
Hey, we got another call on the line coming in, let's get to it.

2041
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

2042
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Oh, I feel blessed. Blessed, I hear a train pulling up to the station.

2043
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Oh, we even have video here in studio. Amazing.

2044
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:32,000
I'm Sally!

2045
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Jim Sally! What is so good? Where the hell have you been?

2046
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Dude, I've been on a journey.

2047
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:41,000
A spiritual journey?

2048
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:44,000
I went places I never thought I would go before.

2049
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Oh, so you're playing Ingress 2?

2050
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:47,000
What?

2051
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Never mind.

2052
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
What kind of journey did you go on?

2053
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:56,000
A sentimental journey.

2054
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
A sense of something journey.

2055
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Was it a sexy journey?

2056
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:02,000
It was a little bit.

2057
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:05,000
I had a fucking...

2058
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Do you want to know it's gross?

2059
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Do you want to know how gross you want to get?

2060
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Why not?

2061
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
It's after dark right now.

2062
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
It probably gets pretty gross.

2063
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
I'm going to tell you though, because I love you.

2064
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:17,000
Alright.

2065
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:23,000
You know how your body is full of like, you know, arteries and shit?

2066
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:24,000
Yeah.

2067
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:25,000
Yeah?

2068
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:28,000
Well, I had one of my arteries get a little fucking full.

2069
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:29,000
Uh oh.

2070
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:33,000
It got kind of big and then it stopped things from happening.

2071
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:34,000
Uh oh.

2072
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Dude, it was in my, my, my, my, my taint.

2073
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Oh my gosh. Oh no.

2074
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:46,000
And I had it for like months and I didn't know I had it. It was just in there.

2075
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:47,000
And it stopped.

2076
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:52,000
It's embarrassing to talk about, but it stopped my testosterone for a little bit, dude.

2077
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
And I didn't know what was going on.

2078
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:56,000
Wow.

2079
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Well, thank God you got to, I mean, you look great and you are out around and moving and doing your train dance and everything.

2080
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:03,000
So thank God you found it.

2081
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:12,000
And the doctors, you know, and yes, the human bodies are crazy things and some of it's a little embarrassing to talk about, but shit happens, literally.

2082
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
Dude, I was getting strange.

2083
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:18,000
My wife was pregnant and shit and I thought I was having like sympathy pregnancies or something.

2084
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
I don't know what was happening.

2085
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:32,000
It was one of those things where it's like you, you were, I've heard about this before where, where women get pregnant and then the husbands have like this really like deep connection to it where they feel like they're pregnant too.

2086
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:33,000
Yeah.

2087
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Hey, and look at that over in chat.

2088
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
There's nobody that's ewing you out in chat.

2089
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:42,000
We have, I'm glad you're okay, Jim Sally.

2090
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:45,000
Right on. Me too, man. It was scary.

2091
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:46,000
All right. Well, you're all better now.

2092
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
So what's on your mind tonight, buddy?

2093
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:49,000
Okay. Boom.

2094
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:51,000
Yeah. Boom. Muscles. Muscles.

2095
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:52,000
I get fucking excited.

2096
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Listen, what's up today?

2097
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:57,000
We're going to have a, we're going to have some bad fucking Bobby trivia.

2098
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:58,000
Whoa. Whoa.

2099
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:02,000
Cause, cause Bobby Black Wolf just celebrated 500 episodes, right?

2100
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:03,000
That's right, buddy.

2101
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:05,000
He had a great show tonight.

2102
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:06,000
He did.

2103
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
So yes, some Bobby Black Wolf trivia.

2104
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:12,000
So you've brought some Black Wolf trivia tonight to the show to celebrate?

2105
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:15,000
I got some delicious Bobby Black Wolf trivia.

2106
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:16,000
All right.

2107
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:17,000
So how are we going to do this?

2108
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:18,000
You going to ask questions?

2109
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
We're going to see who here in studio gets it right?

2110
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Yeah, but you guys like give it a little bit for the chatters to try to catch up to see if they can answer the questions.

2111
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Never.

2112
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:28,000
First question. First question.

2113
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:29,000
All right.

2114
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
What is the name of, this is the easy round.

2115
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:38,000
What is the name of the instrument Bobby Black Wolf plays and what sports team does he play it for?

2116
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:39,000
Hmm.

2117
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:40,000
I know. I know.

2118
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Oh, does Shane know?

2119
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
Does Shane know?

2120
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:47,000
By the way, I also would like to know if Travis knows.

2121
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Travis, if you're out there, go on Skype and tell us if you know the answer.

2122
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:55,000
Travis Donovan would never admit he listens to OLR.

2123
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Is that the Travis that's listening?

2124
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:03,000
If Travis Donovan's out there listening, he would never admit that he's listening to OLR.

2125
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Travis, you've changed, man.

2126
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Just let people know you listen to OLR.

2127
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
I tell lots of people that.

2128
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,000
I put it on my resume.

2129
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Like, don't worry about it, Travis.

2130
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:14,000
All right.

2131
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:17,000
The instrument Bobby plays and what team he plays for.

2132
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Anybody want to?

2133
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
I know this, but what do you guys want to say?

2134
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
He plays the zither for Manchester United.

2135
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
That is not true and you know it.

2136
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:25,000
I know what he plays.

2137
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:26,000
What does he play?

2138
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
He plays drums for the Atlanta Falcons.

2139
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:29,000
That's right.

2140
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,000
He plays percussion for the Atlanta Falcons.

2141
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Beautiful answer.

2142
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Let's get a little more obscure there.

2143
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
This is the medium round.

2144
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:37,000
All right.

2145
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Bobby started his show 10 years ago almost.

2146
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:41,000
It's a long time ago.

2147
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:42,000
It is.

2148
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:45,000
The world was a different place.

2149
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:49,000
Gas was fucking like $3 a liter or some shit.

2150
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:50,000
Or what was it?

2151
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:51,000
A gallon?

2152
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:52,000
$2 a gallon?

2153
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
Yeah, we don't have that liter stuff here.

2154
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
It was like $2 a gallon.

2155
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Yeah, it was cheap.

2156
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
Bobby was fresh out of college.

2157
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:01,000
He was good looking.

2158
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:02,000
His beard was just little.

2159
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
It wasn't quite Doug Bynum yet.

2160
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
He's still good looking.

2161
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,000
You know what I mean?

2162
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:08,000
He's 29 still.

2163
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:11,000
What kind of car did Bobby Blockwolf drive?

2164
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:16,000
If you listen to the show back then, you wouldn't know it because he talked about it a few times.

2165
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:17,000
I know because I rode in it.

2166
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:19,000
I think it was the same car.

2167
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:23,000
I always think of Bobby Blackwolf in that car when I think of Bobby Blackwolf.

2168
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:24,000
Nobody drives now.

2169
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
When Bobby started the show, what was he driving?

2170
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,000
I know what it is.

2171
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:30,000
A whambulance.

2172
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
A whambulance?

2173
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
This is why you get fired from shows by Bobby.

2174
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
I was trying to think of a funny car.

2175
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
That was a pretty good car.

2176
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
Brad from Pod Culture is right in the chat.

2177
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:44,000
It was a Mustang.

2178
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:45,000
I know that.

2179
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Oh, that's right.

2180
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:47,000
Mustang convertible.

2181
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:48,000
It was.

2182
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:49,000
Alright.

2183
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:53,000
Do you want the super ultra hard question now?

2184
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Sure.

2185
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:00,000
What is Bobby Blackwolf's social insurance number?

2186
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
No, that's not a super hard question.

2187
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
212 fuck you.

2188
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:09,000
That's the social security number.

2189
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:16,000
The super hard question today is what game is Jim Salley talking about when Jim Salley

2190
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:19,000
is in Bobby Blackwolf's intro?

2191
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
Oh, shit.

2192
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:24,000
See what I mean?

2193
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:25,000
This one's good.

2194
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:26,000
You've heard it.

2195
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:27,000
Is that the one that's Halo?

2196
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:29,000
Is Jim Salley the one talking about Halo?

2197
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:30,000
I'm going to say Halo.

2198
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:31,000
It's Halo.

2199
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:35,000
That's what Actif says.

2200
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Halo.

2201
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Halo.

2202
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Halo is the answer.

2203
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:41,000
That is correct.

2204
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:42,000
That is correct.

2205
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Rob, three for three, buddy.

2206
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
Bobby and I are tight.

2207
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:47,000
We started a network together.

2208
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:48,000
What can I say?

2209
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:52,000
I did not think you would get that last one, buddy.

2210
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Oh, my God.

2211
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:58,000
No, well, I've heard that intro an awful lot.

2212
02:19:58,000 --> 02:19:59,000
What can I say?

2213
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:00,000
That is true.

2214
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:03,000
That intro has stood the test of time.

2215
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:06,000
That's the kind of influence Jim Salley can have on a show.

2216
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:07,000
It has.

2217
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:12,000
I always laugh at Bobby's new intro because instead of streaming all the good calls together,

2218
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:17,000
he's, I don't want to say you had a bad call, Jim, but he's, no, he's, but he's streamed

2219
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:20,000
like, okay, he's got like the person who cuts out.

2220
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
He's got the person he's like, he doesn't agree with.

2221
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:23,000
I scared Jim Salley off.

2222
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:31,000
I didn't, I didn't mean that he put a lot of like, I don't know, like not so great,

2223
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:32,000
great moments together.

2224
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Like that.

2225
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:35,000
That makes sense.

2226
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Oh, Jim Salley's crying.

2227
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
I didn't mean it like that.

2228
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Come back, Jim Salley.

2229
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:43,000
I miss you.

2230
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:44,000
I'm back.

2231
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:45,000
All right.

2232
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
Fuck, it's tight in here, man.

2233
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
The webcam is a very, very tiny space.

2234
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:53,000
What can I say?

2235
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:55,000
I'm working out a lot, man.

2236
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:56,000
I can't fit in here anymore.

2237
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:57,000
Okay.

2238
02:20:57,000 --> 02:20:58,000
I'm in.

2239
02:20:58,000 --> 02:20:59,000
Okay.

2240
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:00,000
I'm okay now.

2241
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:06,000
So yeah, dude, I fucking, it was a crazy little, little turn of events I had to go through

2242
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:14,000
for a little while, but I've always, I've always been listening and I, I'm finally putting

2243
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:15,000
it together.

2244
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:20,000
Well, I, I'm glad you're here tonight, Jim.

2245
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:25,000
I'm, I, uh, I hope you continue to, uh, listen and grace us with your presence once in a

2246
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:28,000
while to play random trivia games or what have you.

2247
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:31,000
And, uh, you know, I still want you to start a podcast someday.

2248
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:32,000
I really do.

2249
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:35,000
My sister came down from Toronto.

2250
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:36,000
She's a standup comedian.

2251
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
Is she, is she, get out, really?

2252
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:39,000
I'm being serious.

2253
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
She talked me through, her name is Susie Marks.

2254
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:42,000
You can check her out online.

2255
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:43,000
M A R K S.

2256
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Susanna Marks, M A R K S.

2257
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:47,000
Okay.

2258
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
On the internet and stuff, because everyone wants to give her some likes.

2259
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:50,000
She likes that shit.

2260
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:54,000
But she talked me through it on, on today and we put some good ideas together and we

2261
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
recorded a couple of little demos.

2262
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:01,000
It might be, it's going to be a manly podcast.

2263
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:02,000
A manly podcast.

2264
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:03,000
That's okay.

2265
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:08,000
It's time for men to be men.

2266
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:09,000
Don't break something, Jim.

2267
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
It's time for men to be men, Rob.

2268
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,000
You know what I'm saying?

2269
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:14,000
I understand.

2270
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
You know what I'm saying?

2271
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:17,000
I, Jim, Jim, Jim.

2272
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:19,000
When Shane dropped those fucking donuts, he was a man.

2273
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:24,000
Shane dropped those donuts and he came up to you and he said, lover, I dropped the donut.

2274
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:28,000
And then you said, you said you'd be a man and you get the fuck back outside and you

2275
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:29,000
get the more donuts.

2276
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:32,000
And Shane said, yes, sir.

2277
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:33,000
I said, no.

2278
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,000
Shane, get the fucking donuts, man.

2279
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:38,000
You can't tell a guy you're going to give him a motherfucking donut.

2280
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:41,000
Ah, he had, he had a donut, Jim Sally.

2281
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:42,000
He had two of them.

2282
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:45,000
I ate two donuts because I'm a big boy.

2283
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:46,000
Yeah.

2284
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
But those were my donuts that I dropped for myself.

2285
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Rob, you were going to eat both the fucking donuts.

2286
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:53,000
Jim, I am, I am all for a manly men's show.

2287
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Believe me, Jim, I like men.

2288
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:03,000
Well, good.

2289
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:04,000
We're going to do it, buddy.

2290
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:05,000
All right.

2291
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:06,000
That sounds awesome.

2292
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:07,000
I can't wait.

2293
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:10,000
All right, Jim Sally, I got to let you go so we can try to get another call, wrap up

2294
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:13,000
the show, but thank you so much for gracing us with your presence tonight and playing

2295
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:14,000
Bobby Blackwell trivia.

2296
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:15,000
Love you, man.

2297
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:16,000
It was good.

2298
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
Shane, don't give him fucking two donuts, man.

2299
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:19,000
You got to be with him.

2300
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:22,000
The one looked like the one in the introduction to the Simpsons.

2301
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:23,000
I had to eat it.

2302
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:25,000
It was like purple and springy.

2303
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Shouldn't eat two donuts, guys.

2304
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Just eat fucking one donut.

2305
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:29,000
I couldn't help myself.

2306
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:30,000
All right.

2307
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:31,000
Now I feel guilty.

2308
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:32,000
All right.

2309
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:33,000
Bye, Jim Sally.

2310
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Thanks for calling in.

2311
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:35,000
Choo choo.

2312
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:36,000
Bye, Jim.

2313
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:37,000
Goodbye.

2314
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:38,000
For now, we'll talk to you maybe next week.

2315
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:39,000
All right.

2316
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:40,000
I'll see you later.

2317
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Bye, Jim.

2318
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:44,000
I'll be down here.

2319
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:45,000
Okay.

2320
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Brad from Pod Culture says he just needs to submit a ton of random clips and put them

2321
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
in random rotation.

2322
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:55,000
I would be totally okay with that.

2323
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:58,000
More people would probably listen to that than the music feed.

2324
02:23:58,000 --> 02:23:59,000
Let's be real.

2325
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:04,000
You just have Jim Sally going on rants 24-7 when there's no other live program on the

2326
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:09,000
network, and I think people would be totally down for that.

2327
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,000
So great to hear from Jim Sally.

2328
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:14,000
Well, we will try to squeeze in one more call here.

2329
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:15,000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

2330
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.

2331
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:21,000
Yeah.

2332
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:24,000
Try to squeeze you in if you want to get in on the show.

2333
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:27,000
Are you looking up any more last minute stories over there?

2334
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:28,000
Low-key, Darzara?

2335
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
Arrowhead says they're not doing Gauntlet anymore.

2336
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:31,000
Oh, really?

2337
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:32,000
No more Gauntlet games?

2338
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:33,000
Yeah.

2339
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:34,000
That was on Game Politics.

2340
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:35,000
Hold on.

2341
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:36,000
Why?

2342
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:37,000
I have to find it again.

2343
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:38,000
The new Gauntlet wasn't bad at all.

2344
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:39,000
That's kind of sad.

2345
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
I didn't play it, but I have it.

2346
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:42,000
I just haven't played it yet.

2347
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:43,000
It's not bad at all.

2348
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:47,000
It's Diablo inspired, but it's a little different.

2349
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:48,000
You don't go for the gear grind.

2350
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
It's just straight up the gold.

2351
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Yeah, you have last minute stories.

2352
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:57,000
Smile Basic is coming to 3DS.

2353
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:07,000
If you remember, Smile Basic was on the regular DS and DSi a while back.

2354
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:11,000
You can actually program games in it, and now you can do that as well.

2355
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:14,000
It allows for more complex games to be made.

2356
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:18,000
It's only $10 in the US, coming out on the 15th of October.

2357
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:22,000
Check it out.

2358
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
One I missed a little bit earlier.

2359
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Minecraft got an update recently.

2360
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:31,000
With that, you can actually get some sort of special magical wings to be able to fly around,

2361
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:35,000
or I should say glide around in the game.

2362
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:38,000
They are not necessarily wings.

2363
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:41,000
It seems like it's a hang glider or something.

2364
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:45,000
Apparently, you can find it, but you can't actually craft those in the game.

2365
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
That's kind of cool.

2366
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:54,000
The deal with Arrowhead is that they're not going to be doing updates for Gauntlet Slayer Edition anymore.

2367
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:58,000
They said that they were happy working with Warner Bros. Entertainment,

2368
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:01,000
and now they're ready to bring it to an end.

2369
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:03,000
They're not going to do any more patches.

2370
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:05,000
They just likely said they're not going to do any more patches.

2371
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
Nothing will be unfixed.

2372
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:13,000
Anything that has a problem will remain unfixed, and they haven't really said why.

2373
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:16,000
So, yeah, no more.

2374
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:19,000
So that's it.

2375
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:21,000
Maybe the game sales slowed down or something.

2376
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:24,000
They've got to shift resources to another game or something.

2377
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:25,000
They don't have the money anymore. I don't know.

2378
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:26,000
Possibly.

2379
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
Anything else, Loki?

2380
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:29,000
That's it.

2381
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,000
Shane, you got anything else there?

2382
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:32,000
No.

2383
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:33,000
I guess that's it then.

2384
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:36,000
We're going to go ahead and wrap up for the evening because the phones aren't ringing either.

2385
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:39,000
But those are some pretty great calls tonight.

2386
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:43,000
So if you guys want to follow up, you can always send us an email.

2387
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
Participate at orangelaunchradio.com.

2388
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:47,000
You can also contact us on Twitter.

2389
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

2390
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,000
All great places to get ahold of us.

2391
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:55,000
We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts and wrap it up for the night.

2392
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:57,000
But as I always say towards the end of the show,

2393
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:03,000
if you did enjoy what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two or 15 or 60 about the show.

2394
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:06,000
And help spread the word about the show where every gamer has a voice.

2395
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:11,000
Because we don't have a big website or really big names backing up this show.

2396
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
So we really appreciate the word of mouth.

2397
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:14,000
It goes an awful long way.

2398
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:17,000
And hey, participate with the show.

2399
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:18,000
Come be a part of it.

2400
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:21,000
Everybody's welcome here at Orange Lounge Radio.

2401
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,000
Including Shane who joined us here in studio tonight.

2402
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:24,000
Thanks for being here, Shane.

2403
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:25,000
Even if you were a tardy.

2404
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:26,000
It's all right.

2405
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:27,000
It happens.

2406
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:28,000
Thank you for the donuts earlier today.

2407
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:29,000
You're welcome.

2408
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:30,000
And for all the shopping.

2409
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
Even if you encourage me to buy things, I probably should know.

2410
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Yeah.

2411
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:34,000
Yeah.

2412
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:35,000
Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2413
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:41,000
Everybody should go pre-order Super Beat Zonic so it does well enough to have DLC and stuff like that.

2414
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:44,000
Do you want to plug your Twitter or anything for people to follow you?

2415
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:45,000
No.

2416
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:46,000
All right. Fair enough.

2417
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:47,000
I think I gave it out already anyway.

2418
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:50,000
Jamie, you're ready to say something.

2419
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:51,000
So what's your final thought for tonight?

2420
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:53,000
Thank you for letting me dance some at Shane.

2421
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:54,000
You're welcome.

2422
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:57,000
I have to now find the PS2 and hook it up.

2423
02:27:57,000 --> 02:27:59,000
Because we only have the PS4 and we hooked up.

2424
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:01,000
That's such a good game too.

2425
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:02,000
I know.

2426
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:03,000
It's so underappreciated.

2427
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
I wish though you had your controllers here.

2428
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:06,000
I never had this.

2429
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:07,000
I thought you did.

2430
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:08,000
Nope.

2431
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:09,000
Never had the clappy hand controllers.

2432
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Whose did I play it in?

2433
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:11,000
I thought you did too.

2434
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:12,000
No.

2435
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:16,000
Because I tried playing it without the clappy hand controllers on the clappy hand mode.

2436
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
And it's really hard.

2437
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:21,000
I thought the first time I played it was with the clappy hand controller.

2438
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:22,000
That wasn't me.

2439
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Which reminded me of the old ColecoVision button finger thing that you have the little joystick on.

2440
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:30,000
I think we have one of those somewhere.

2441
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:35,000
I bet that was our friend here locally who I've just lost touch with over the years.

2442
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
That he also collected all his music game stars.

2443
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:40,000
Remember he had the arcade style popping music and all that?

2444
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:41,000
That's right.

2445
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,000
I feel like he's the one that would have had that if anybody.

2446
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
It was Ryan.

2447
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:48,000
Oh that's not who I was thinking of.

2448
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:52,000
No he didn't have those but he had the popping music.

2449
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
The full one.

2450
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
Whatever.

2451
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
Shane brings out my inner whatever.

2452
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Sorry.

2453
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:01,000
That's okay.

2454
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,000
Logan your final thought tonight.

2455
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:06,000
My final thought is...

2456
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:09,000
I guess I'll play more Ingress this week.

2457
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:12,000
One of us. One of us.

2458
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
My phone didn't let me download it.

2459
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:15,000
Why not?

2460
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:16,000
Because I'm out of room.

2461
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:17,000
Delete something.

2462
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:21,000
No because I cannot go without my Bejeweled fix Rob.

2463
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,000
Alright deleting Bejeweled.

2464
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:24,000
No.

2465
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:28,000
And my final thought tonight is we're finishing a little early.

2466
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Maybe I should try to livestream after this show.

2467
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:34,000
I usually try to edit OLR right away but maybe I'll try to squeeze in a livestream before anything.

2468
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:38,000
Or if you didn't watch Amy Schumer on SNL you should watch her monologue.

2469
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:39,000
It's so good.

2470
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:40,000
Was it good?

2471
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:41,000
I died.

2472
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:42,000
I'll try to find it on Uber or something.

2473
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:43,000
She's like a more offensive Sarah Silverman.

2474
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
Alright we'll see.

2475
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:46,000
We'll see.

2476
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:47,000
Stay tuned to my Twitter.

2477
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:50,000
Twitter.com slash SKIE.

2478
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:53,000
Everyone needs to stay for the fortune cookie this time because it's really good.

2479
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:54,000
It makes me think of Pogo.

2480
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:58,000
Well don't say that because then the people on the podcast are like what is she talking about?

2481
02:29:58,000 --> 02:29:59,000
I'm sorry.

2482
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:00,000
And they don't realize there's more show to happen.

2483
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:01,000
That means they have to listen to us live.

2484
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:02,000
Alright that's right.

2485
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
You gotta come out sometime and listen to us live.

2486
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:05,000
Alright goodnight everybody.

2487
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:09,000
Have a wonderful night and we will see you in 7 days to do this all over again.

2488
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:11,000
