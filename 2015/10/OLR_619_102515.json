{"text": " Orange Lounge Radio Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki This week we go back to the future with a nod to Mattel's still unreleased hoverboard, the most stylish time machine, and even a classic video game. All this and the actual news of late October 2015 along with your calls, comments, and more starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio Great Scott Indeed, see that's my cue to throw the toilet paper for the movie's ice watch. Alright, anyway. Hi everybody, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 619 of our show, October the 25th of 2015. My name is Rob Roberts, you can follow me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, and joining me here in studio to talk about the latest and greatest in video games, video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle. Say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers. Hi. How are you? I'm alive. How does it feel to be in the future? Because you know that's what Jason was referencing in the intro, we have some news around that this week, and lots of people talking about that this week. Because that day, in case you hadn't heard, because it wasn't just like everywhere, that day that Marty McFly travels to the future actually happened this week. As opposed to all the Tumblr memes that have said that for the past four years, that every day is the day that Marty McFly arrives, that day actually happened this past week. It feels like a struggle. Every day is a struggle. Because of all the people who want to hold us back. You need your- Embrace the future. That's right, and will deny me my hoverboard, and my flying car, and so forth. Why is that that in every perception of the future, there's flying cars? Because traffic sucks. Traffic does. But imagine this. Traffic is worse. If you had flying cars that have to figure out a way to put lanes up there, just if you want your example of what shit would be with flying cars, look at the fifth element. Or like Star Wars. I think they sometimes show like on Course Con, they have like- Yeah. Yeah. No. But I know what you mean, the fifth element, because he was the taxi driver, and so they had a lot of traffic shots and that, so. Yeah. Or that episode of Doctor Who with all of the cars in the tunnel. Mm-hmm. And the cat people and the kittens. Yeah, that. Also welcome, everybody, to the future. Tech master, Loki! Hello. Hey, Loki, how are you doing? Good, multi-sasking. Good. Yes, I see. You were actually playing Minecraft during the show. Yeah. Are you trying to build something during the show? Is there something extremely important going on in Minecraft? No, this is basically what is the equivalent of gaming masturbation, just because there is no point to this game in survival mode, so. Yeah, but some would argue that there is a point to masturbation, Loki. True, but there's really no point to this, you know, game in survival mode. I mean, so I'm just basically down in my mind, hacking at the wall. So that would be more like a video game nap. It's just a video game nap. Maybe, yeah, nap. That works. It might feel good, and then you're gonna regret that you just wasted the whole day doing it. I think that would be a little more appropriate. All right, say hello as well to our chat room, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network. vog.network.com, and if you're listening live, you should participate with us and chat. live.vog.network.com, and where Tigerclaw is reminding us in our chat room, we still have four years till we get to the year of Blade Runner, which is 2019. So we have- Guess what? The cars won't still be flying. We are two years from the running man. They might not be flying, but they might be driving themselves. I feel like we're getting closer and closer to that whole thing. Google's doing one, supposedly Apple's doing one. I don't know, rumors. Of course, there's the whole Tesla thing this week where now it's not just cruise control, but now it's cruise drivable and things like that. I feel like in four years, it just might be the whole kit and caboodle where the cars are just driving themselves. I can't be the only one that's disappointed that there's not Tesla coil in every Tesla car. I'm just saying, I was promised giant Tesla coils for Command and Conquer Red Alert, and I expect giant Tesla coils being able to destroy my enemies with. You demand it. Brad from Pod Culture says, get back to me when kit is a reality. Yes, what year was that? But that was present day, right? Knight Rider? Wasn't that present day? Wasn't it in the future? That was the 80s. It was like a James Bond-esque kind of thing. That was the 80s. Yes, that was the 80s. But why couldn't we have combined Knight Rider and Magnum P.I. and have kit have been in a Ferrari Testarossa and the Hoth have a huge porn stash? Maybe there should have been a crossover. We're going to talk about an interesting video game crossover a little later on, just to shift it back to games a little bit, though. But I did want to say, with this whole fact that Knight Rider was the 80s, and everybody's celebrating Back to the Future this week, and the fact that we are living in the future. I think anybody that saw the Jem and the Holograms movie this week would rather be living in the past. Just saying. One of my friends actually liked it. Really? And I was like, no. Here's the thing. I think the Metacritic is what, not that I let Metacritic run my life, but I'm curious. So I think it was like a 29% on Metacritic. And it's like, okay, well, I've seen worse. There's worse movies. I feel like Mall Cop 2 probably had a lower Metacritic rating than Jem. And maybe that should be the tagline. Jem and the Holograms. Hey, Adam Sandler's not in it. But it's still just, it's a complete violation of my childhood. Believe me. Believe me. I loved the Jem 80s cartoon. And I feel like I heard, read this somewhere, that they took somebody else's script and was like, oh, we have this Jem license we're going to use, or we're going to lose if we don't use it. So we're just going to insert Jem into this existing script that has nothing to do with Jem. And I think that's, yeah, what they got didn't really work. I was hoping, when I heard they were making a movie out of Jem, I was hoping it was going to be more like the Josie and the Pussycats movie. Which, if you haven't seen it, is like, it's one of those like, it's so bad, cheesy, over the top, it's kind of great. I think that Josie and the Pussycats knows what it is. Yeah, come on, Josie and the Pussycats opens with a boy band singing their number one hit, Back Door Lover. That's funny. And it's one of those things that kids don't get. That's like 21 Jump Street stuff, you know, where that movie knows what it is. Exactly. It's a parody of, you know, it's its own movie, but it's also a parody of the genre. Parker Posey was in it. I mean, that's instant, like, that's an instant plus 15 on the Metacritic at least. Parker Posey's in it, therefore it lifts it up a little bit. Come on. Alan Alchemy in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says, Space Channel 5 is in Josie and the Pussycats. That's right, because there was, the whole like, brand insertion and commercialization was a big thing, and I seem to remember like, Sega and Dreamcast are some of those brands that show up, because that was, you know, about the time. Kaijuto in chat says, I was a huge Gem fan and I don't care. The minute I found out it was live action, I was always already out and didn't care. Yeah, and I think most people are just like, I do not consider this canon. It's just I'm turning my back on it. It's not what they say it is. And there's that. Anyway, how did we get on movies and TVs? We're supposed to be a video game show, but hey, you know what? I know a lot of you guys, when you're playing video games, you're probably watching movies on your second monitor. At least I'm told that's what a lot of people do. I can't do that. Do you guys, let me ask that a little bit here for part of our kickoff topic, because I feel like the kickoff topic I have is ground we've tread before, but let me ask this real quick is, do you guys multitask when you play games? Let me start with Loki, because I think the answer is going to be pretty obvious here. No, normally I don't. And that's the funny thing is, well, at least I don't intend to. But usually the wife is watching something stupid on TV, and so it's kind of hard to ignore it. So you multitask not by choice? Not by choice, yes. It's forced upon my eyes as I'm playing a game, usually like Mario Maker or something like that on a second screen. Unless, of course, I have the TV, in which case, no, there are no distractions. And how was Grey's Anatomy this week? We're already done with Grey's Anatomy, in fact, which she's done with her other stupid ABC family movie or show about some kid that was accused of murder of his aunt or some stupid thing like that. And now we're on to classic episodes from Roseanne, which isn't so bad. That's not so bad. I would watch that one. Roseanne, it's a good show. Yeah, there you go. At least you and the wife can compromise once in a while. I should be concerned that she aspires to be Roseanne, so that... But Jamie's the one that goes around going, Dan! Coffee! No, it's usually Dan playing in the front room and me playing on my computer. We don't do movies. God, that's like not normal. I was just gonna tell Loki real quick, though, I would be worried for when Fuller House comes out, because that's gonna be the one that I know your wife is gonna be there day one. I would watch that. I like Fuller House. I mean, it was okay. I just think it's gonna be, no, here's the one I'm fucking worried about, okay? It's the fact that they're announcing, hey, guess what? We're gonna do another Gilmore Girls series. I'm like, fuck no. Fuck no. I am not fucking listening to that shit. I don't understand how they talk like that. It's just they talk so quick. God, it's like how I hear the conversations. The way they talk in that show is not the way people really talk, and it bothers me a lot. Kinda like robots set to 1.5 speed or something like that. SSJ100Matt says, does listening to great podcasts from the VoG network, cheap plug, while playing games count as multitasking? Sort of, and that I can do, actually, especially during MMOs. I actually get a lot of my podcasts listening in while I'm grinding in an MMO, and I count Diablo as an MMO. Because in an MMO, even though the music can be amazing, like Final Fantasy XIV, one of the greatest soundtracks in all of games, let alone an MMO, once you've heard the song literally 5,000 times, you're kinda ready to turn it down and listen to something else. So yes, and I think that's a great plug for podcasts in general, is that they make a great kind of background music when you're doing gaming or what have you that doesn't take your visual attention away. Jamie, I know you started to kind of answer this question a little bit because you said Dan would be in the front room, you'd be in the back. Do you ever multitask while you're playing a game? Do you do the game on one monitor or something else on the second monitor? I'll chat with Becky sometimes. Chat. So I'll keep my chat stuff open, or I'll probably have an FAQ if it's a hard puzzle or something. But I pretty much give the game my attention and just chat on the side. What's interesting about the chat, I think I would say that's about as far as I go with it too, is that I'll either have Google Hangouts, which is what I use these days, I have Google Hangouts open on another window and I'll do the chat thing, kind of like that. But I find that with a lot of games, especially if it's an MMO and I happen to have people on, I can chat within the game. Or like Battle.net has several games that are all tied together that are all pretty popular that you can kind of chat in between the games. I was catching up with a few people from WoW last night. I just loaded up Battle.net just for the sake of it. Actually now that I have the full build of Hearthstone, not Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, so I was installing that in Diablo 3 the other day. Nice. And just chatting with folks from the guild. Yeah, because obviously I played WoW pretty hardcore for a few years. I was doing the podcast for a while that was about nothing but WoW. And I found that Battle.net, while I'm playing Diablo, or the rare occasion I'm playing Heroes of the Storm, a great way to talk to some of my old friends from WoW who are still playing. There's this couple we used to raid with who lives up in Canada, and I can still keep in touch with them. And then some of you guys know Gemet. I see him online once in a while and I'll talk to him or whoever else from those days. I kind of like, as much as I hated the real ID and all that stuff in Battle.net at first, the concept of the chat client that goes across multiple games, I really liked. Steam, I would be a fool to leave out. Steam obviously is another huge way that people can communicate across games. It's a lot easier than using Tails. Yeah, you've beeped me on Steam, DarkSagra. Certainly. There you go. I tend to, for folks in the free company, because I hate that you can't chat while you're in an instance, so I just use Steam for that. Oh, there you go. That works. Steam is a really good workaround for all that kind of stuff. I don't have to keep typing slash Tails slash Tails. I think you do slash T as a shortcut, just so you know. I still hate having to do slash anything. Quick side tangent before I get to our chat room, and this will be totally random, but tonight I made DarkSagra before the show try this pumpkin pie soda, which I couldn't stand. I had it last night, but Alan's dying to know. What did you think of it? It's like cream soda with pumpkin aftertaste. See, I didn't like it. But not good cream soda, and not good pumpkin. Okay, I think she's drinking it just because. It doesn't suck. Cream soda, yuck. I love all things pumpkin, but I do not like that. I love cream soda a lot, to the point that I'll drink almost any kind of cream soda, but it's novel. I've had it once, and I'm vaguely thirsty, but I think that what's about to come out of the oven is going to be infinitely better than this. Yes, DarkSagra's baking during OLR tonight. I didn't make it from scratch. Fuck that. Alright, Dartusuya is asking, let me guess, is it a Jones soda? No, it's some random store brand that they happen to have. I think it'd taste good if it was a Jones soda. Yeah, let's see, Zippo25 in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I can play games while I watch movies, but not watch movies while I play games. That's an interesting way to put it. I can't even do Netflix in games, because I'll keep wanting to watch whatever it is, and I can't focus on the game. I can't do both at the same time. I just can't. Let's see, Kaijuto in chat says, the new Diablo is Zelda Triforce Heroes. It's the shit. You know, I didn't pick that up this week, surprisingly, and I'll tell you why in a little bit. I've been playing something else, but I'm very curious about that, Triforce Heroes. I want to hear more feedback from my friends about that game. Let's see, Brad from Pod Culture says, the Jones soda pumpkin pie was kind of nasty, too, when they all drank it on Pod Culture. And Tigerclaw talking about Triforce Heroes says, the only thing is all three players share the hearts. If any one person dies, you restart the level. Ouch. I bet that doesn't get annoying whatsoever, I'm sure. Okay, so Halloween's this week. Happy Halloween to all of our OLR listeners, and I hope whatever it is you're doing this weekend will be safe for you. Halloween makes me miss Radiscoll and Devil Doll. Why is that? Just because the second episode that they did was a Halloween one. It was called Halloweeny. It was funny. Random. I know. So I'm going to ask you guys, how do you plan to celebrate Halloween, and is there any gaming involved? Will you be doing any special Halloween gaming? I'll start. I am absolutely going to, and I think a lot of people will be doing this, but I will be playing the PT demo on Halloween. Hopefully I'll be able to squeeze in between some other stuff I'm doing on Halloween, because I'm kind of busy. Rocky Horror, obviously, is also a really big Halloween thing, and I'm hosting that here in SAC on Halloween. So I've got to make sure I can kind of squeeze that in, but I do plan to do a stream, hopefully, of PT on Halloween, because you've got to. And I'm sure a lot of people are going to be doing it, those that haven't lost it from their PlayStation 4s. I've got to do PT. So what about you guys for Halloween? Going to the Bay Area. Yeah. See the mills. Any, well I guess, yeah I'll be going to that too, at least making a cameo, but any gaming at that? I'm sure there'll be some gaming. Because we all met playing music-based games, so. And then, I don't know, it depends on when we come back, what else we're going to do. But hey, it's a half day, so I'm sure I'll find something to do. Is there any? Maybe some, my favorite of the Silent Hills. Might have to happen. Which is? Three. Three is my favorite. So you can play with the Heather Beam? Heather Beam! Because it's funny for the Heather Beam, like, it's her Japanese voice. So it makes me laugh. Heather Beam! So. Alright. Loki, how about you for Halloween? No, I'm not doing anything. You're not doing anything? I thought you were going to go to this elaborate costume and all this stuff? Oh, well I'm making the costume, yeah, that's for work though, but that's not for Halloween, that's just for like the day before. That's just for work, I see. So, any gaming? If you're not going to do anything, are you going to do any gaming at all for Halloween? Scary game? No. Do you scare your kids? No, they'll probably go trick or treating. And then I'll eat their candy. That's like the advantage of being a parent. That's the trick. You know, I did just remember the other thing I'm probably going to have going on when I get back that night. Is working on my Grey Warden staff. Oh, yeah, for your cosplay you're doing for gamer acts. Yeah, I've got all of this stuff ready to put together. Nice. And Victoria is making the costume. Awesome. But I have to build- Who did my Joker costume, by the way, if you saw it on- I have to build my staff and that's going to be the fun part. Okay. And I've got to modify my boots. That'll be fun. It'll be a neat costume. Awesome. Well, I know you want to go tend to the little pumpkin rolls. Well, hold on, hold on before you go. Before you go. Okay, well good. They're cooling for a bit. Then while they cool, I want to get into our gaming weeks. Okay. Because of course we like to start off the show talking about the types of video games that we've been playing this week. So, Dark Soccer- Mind games. How was your gaming week? It was all right. I've been playing some more Happy Home Designer, Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer. Now I have to design Town Hall, so that's interesting. Do you need the amiibo cards for that? Because I saw a ton of them yesterday and I was like, maybe I should be buying these for Jamie. Because I don't think these are like super easy to find right now. I have a small pack of them that came with it, but I don't know. I haven't opened the cards. Oh, okay. So if you find any of the neat cards, like the kitty cats or any of them- Aren't they all blind reveals? Yeah, I guess they are. So just buy me a pack and I'll thank you for them. All right, well, BRB, I have to go back to Chico where I saw them. They have them at the Toys R Us near my house. Oh yeah, that's good. But I think I'm worth $6 in a trip to Chico. I downloaded Diablo 3 and Heroes of the Storm, so I'm going to be trying to get into that. Although a lot of my coworkers play Hearthstone 2. I'm like, no more Magic games, no more. We've been playing Super Mario 3D World. Dan's playing through Super Mario 2 Advance on the Wii U, playing the Virtual Console version. Oh, right. And we got Tank, Tank, Tank. So we're probably going to be playing that tonight. Really? I didn't like that game on the Wii U at all. Well, Dan just found it and got super excited and bought it. Oh, so they have that free, like the free to play version. It's just really a demo. We've got the game, the game game. Okay, wow. Oh yeah, Dragon Age Inquisition. I'm back to actually playing through two new side-by-side playthroughs. Because I'm comparing the Templar playthrough with the Mage playthrough. And I'm also trying to finish Origins, but it's kind of hard to go back and play Origins after playing Inquisition with how pretty it is. Yeah, same. And how much better the game plays, oh my god. That's why I was never able to beat Origins. Origins is like a clusterfuck for fighting. Yeah. I really like the combat in Dragon Age 2. I like the combat in Inquisition a whole lot better too. So I was playing that and I started Beginner's Guide. Which is really just a game dedicated to the games of this other person who I think stopped making games. So it's basically this person's old levels and everything and someone walking through and talking about game design. And it's by the folks that did the Stanley parable, so it's pretty neat. Nice. And I bought Elder Scrolls Online. But I haven't started it yet. It's 20 bucks on the Humble sale, I think it's over though. Oh wow, okay. I got the Capcom Humble bundle. And I played Final Fantasy XIV for a little bit, so it's kind of... You've been busy. Busier than usual, but I've got crap ton of other stuff I need to get done, so probably going to be slow. In the rush to Halloween. Loki, how was your gaming week besides the Minecraft you're playing right now? I did play Minecraft earlier this week as well, so there's that. What else did I play? Minecraft Story Mode. Not because I'm just obsessed with Minecraft or something, but because I wanted to check it out. See what exactly they're going to do for a story-based Minecraft game. And it was okay. I was asking Rob earlier how the other Telltale games are as far as, are they pretty linear? Do they have a lot of stuff that you have to do, like puzzle solving? Because I'm coming into it thinking, oh hey, I used to play these old PC adventure games and stuff from LucasArts a while back. Is this anything like this? And it seemed pretty linear. It's entertaining, I guess. It was short. I finished the first episode in about two hours, maybe. If that. And there wasn't really a whole lot of interaction other than just dialogue. And the rest is kind of just watching it and there's a few quick time events. That's about it, I mean. Yeah, I kind of found the Telltale games to not be, at least the ones I've played, like Walking Dead and Jurassic Park even I played. I didn't find those games to be super linear. I imagine Minecraft, because it's geared towards kids, might be a little more linear than the others. But I also didn't find it to be as rich as maybe like the King's Quest games and stuff used to be. It was very different than that, I think. Yeah, I don't know. It was okay. I mean, I was just kind of curious to see how they would kind of throw a story into that. And of course they have different characters, not Steve or anything. Right. My son kept going, like, you know, is Steve in that? I'm like, no, he's not in this game. And it's like, why isn't he in there? Why isn't Steve in there? Because Steve died. Because Steve's not in the game. Although he should make a cameo. I think that they should do that. I kind of got, I don't know. I was getting a little bit annoyed with Patton Oswalt's voice acting, though, in the game. But whatever. It was okay. Whether I'm going to pick up the rest of the episodes, I'm interested. But it's not something that I'm going to make a priority right now. Especially since they discount that stuff, like, all the time. So I may just wait for it to be discounted. But it was okay. I mean, I guess it's worth five bucks. Which is what I paid for it. And then you can play it through it again. And there's different, you know, dialogue things that can happen and stuff. Sure. I tried Super Time Force a little bit. I didn't really get past the demo or the tutorial portion. I just kind of got sick of it. It was mainly just killing time while Minecraft Story Mode was downloading. And then, what else? I... Let's see. I mentioned Minecraft already. I started playing Final Fantasy VI again. Just a little bit. Because I actually started Final Fantasy VII. And then it just did not look good anymore. I mean, it was awesome on PlayStation 1. But, oh my god. Now it just kind of... It did not hold up too well. Or maybe I just don't like it the way that they kind of up-rezzed everything for this update for the PC version. So maybe that's the thing that bothers me about it. But, other than that, I mean Final Fantasy VI is amazing. So, I started that. I don't know if I'll finish it or not. But, it's a fun game. And then Ingress. I played Ingress and got to level 6. I hit level 2. Did you really? Congrats. Yeah. I don't know if I need to finish all the tutorial stuff in that. No, you don't. I never did. Do you get a badge for that or something? No, I don't think so. They had to suspend the verify thing because they didn't have the resources for it. But, I was going to ask real quick about Final Fantasy VII. Whatever happened to the... Remember last year at the PlayStation experience? They announced Final Fantasy VII, but it was just the PC version on PlayStation 4. And everybody was like, fuck off. That's not what we asked for. And then, Sony finally delivered it at E3. It was like, okay, okay. We were just fucking with you. Here it is. But, I thought that PC thing was still coming. Like, is that not happening now because of the other remake? I hope not. I hope it's not coming. I don't like the PC version that well. I just don't think it looks that great. Put up just the regular version of the game. Have it play on the PlayStation 4. Done. You know what I mean? Because they have it out there already as a title. Hell, just make it so we can play PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 games. Hell, it'll all have itself for PlayStation 1 games. Because, shit. If a fucking PSP can play PlayStation 1 games, the fucking PlayStation 4 has the power to be able to emulate PlayStation 1 games. I really feel like that's an unlock we're gonna get at this PlayStation experience. I just really feel like, you know, the Christmas season's a good time to announce something like that. I just, I really hope that's the mic drop. Because, like, that would be great. Because, like, I have a few games from that that I got. You know, I purchased, like, some older PlayStation 1 games. I mean, it'd be nice. Or even PlayStation 2 games. Like, I've got, like, Katamari that's just sitting there that, you know, I had to boot up my PlayStation 3 to be able to play that stuff. It's stupid. I don't want to have to do that. But, um, alright. So, Ingress, though. I'm playing lots of Ingress. Not so much the last couple days. Because I've been really trying to focus on having to work on my costume. Which hasn't happened. Because I've been super tired. Like, today I was trying to even do the show role and I fell asleep. Because I was exhausted. I wonder why your stories went up later than usual. So, yeah. I was doing that while my kids were napping. And, like, I just passed out. Because I'm so tired. So, unfortunately, last night was going to be one of the times I had to work on that. And it just didn't happen. But, ideally, I'm going to be a Lego minifigure of Loki. Because that would be funny. Not yourself, but... But Loki from Marvel Superheroes. Or Lego Marvel Superheroes. Nice. And if I don't have enough time, then it'll have to be something else. I look forward to the pictures. Yeah. So, it'll be something Lego related. I'm going to work on it tonight. I'm going to try. Alright. As far as my gaming week goes. Mostly the same games. Diablo 3. I don't remember if I mentioned it last week. I've now hit Paragon, like, 330. In my adventures in Diablo 3 and playing with Alan. I have surpassed the Paragon level of my non-seasonal characters. Which would be all the previous seasons. And pre that seasonal stuff combined. Because your seasonal XP dumps into the main pool every time a season ends. So, I've now surpassed that point. So, that should tell you about how much Diablo I've been playing lately. However, also, you kind of get more experience now. Because the K'Nai's Cube, which gives you the power of three more legendaries. Allows you to do much harder content. And so you're getting more XP through that harder content. To be fair, this doesn't necessarily mean the hours I've spent have been more. But certainly my character's power is greater. So, that's been fun. Also, I've been playing a little bit of Final Fantasy XIV. But not a lot. I'm still kind of on a lull. I know they had some announcements today. We didn't really get them into the show role. But they talked a little bit about what they're going to be doing with Patch 3.1. And there's going to be a mini-game that involves the minions. That's pretty cool. And two new dungeons. So, that'll be nice. They're going to be updating Gold Saucer, I think, with some other games. So, that's cool. Let's see. I also, at a gathering of about eight people, actually got to play some Jackbox Party Pack 2. I'd already played it a little bit last week. But only with just a few people. So, I think I got to play it more the way it was intended. In a room full of people. And we only really had the time to just play a couple of the games. We didn't play everything. But we played Quiplash XL, which was hilarious. And we had a lot of fun with that. And when you have eight people, there's a lot of prompts. Because each prompt, I guess it's like, I don't know, Family Feud style. Where it matches up two people at a time. So, if you have eight people, and each person is answering two questions. I mean, it's something like fifteen prompts or something you're going through and voting on. But it's really funny. Especially with the right group of people that are all kind of on that same sense of humor where we're all going to hell. So, I had a good time playing that. We also played Earwax. Which was okay. I'm not sure the formula works totally compared to some of the other Jackbox games. Just because it's weird that you really have no control over the sound effects that you can have in your pool. Like, it would be a little more interesting if it was Cards Against Humanity style or something. Where you had a hand of sound effects. And then the ones you didn't use, you could use in the later round or something like that. I don't know. This thing might be a little more interesting with that. But it's weird. You can't really preview the sound effects too. But again, when you have so many people and everybody's in that same sense of humor. So, every single prompt is responded to as some sort of fart noise. There is still some humor to be found in that. So, I didn't think the game was bad or anything. It's not as strong as the other Jackbox games. Which, earlier last week, myself, Allen, and Shane were all playing Bomb Corp. That one is really cool. That one, I think, is the reason to check out the pack. Because it's something very, very different from a lot of the stuff you saw in Jackbox 1. And the sense of humor is really great. And the retro style graphics. It's a really fun game to play together. Bomb Corp, I think, is my favorite out of those that I've played. Anyhow, other games I've played this week. Dragon Quest Heroes on PlayStation 4. I actually bought that because I was on the fence about getting it. I wasn't sure if I wanted it. Because I thought, ah, but I really want a main Dragon Quest game. I'd rather play that. But then, I was watching some Twitch streams and I was like, oh, it's Dynasty Warriors or Hyrule Warriors, if you will, meets Dragon Quest. I'm like, what the hell. I'll do it. So I ended up buying it. And I've actually sunk quite a few hours in that game. It's fun. I'm having a good time with it. There's something very zen and fulfilling about just the utter button mashing where you're just taking out slime after slime and skeleton and cute little bat things and all the other creatures in Dragon Quest. It's really cool that in this game they've kind of blended some of the different Dragon Quest worlds together. Because there's characters that appear from like four, five, six, I think seven and eight, all show up. So I think that was kind of cool. So, yeah, I'm enjoying Dragon Quest Warriors more than I thought I would. Even though the game doesn't have a lot of depth to it. I mean, I guess you can set your controls two different ways. And I chose to do the easy way, which is like you just hit square over and over, mix in some triangle, and you're doing all these crazy-ass combos. So, you know, I chose to, I guess, make the game a little more simpler. But they do some other JRPG stuff in it. Like, use the item drops you get at the Alchemist to create this accessory that you can use. And then you can combine accessories to make the super accessory. And, you know, a lot of those JRPG grindy things you've come to expect. They're all there. JRPG grindiness is why I love Dragon Quest. So I'm having a good time. Just the character design is great, as it always is in Dragon Quest games. And the music, of course. Which is very interesting. And I know we talked about this a little bit last week. But I found it very interesting that right there on the title screen, there's a little, it says, press options for more info on streaming stuff. Or I don't know what's the streaming information. And it actually said, when you press start, it's this whole, like, legal thing that's like, you know, you do not have permission to stream just for the purposes of listening to the music. This is copyright. Such and such. Like, they don't want people to just stream the music only. And they, it's so weird. Like, all the weird copyright stuff that's in that game. I know we dipped into it a little bit last week. But to kind of see it firsthand in the game was kind of strange. So I have a feeling publishers are going to get more control over what you can and can't stream in, like, a future PlayStation 4 update. I wouldn't be surprised if maybe when streaming's on, they could disable the music somehow. I feel like Square would have wanted to do that on this. I don't know. So, anyhow, yeah, I've been playing a lot of fun games this week. That was my gaming week. So, some housekeeping before we get into some news. I don't have a lot, really, to announce here. I don't think we're going to be here Thanksgiving weekend. I think Dark Saga said she's going to be out of town. And I don't think we're going to be here Thanksgiving weekend because most of you guys probably won't be either. But otherwise, we're still here every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of the Geeks Network. voggenetwork.com. Although, Bobby was not on tonight. He had some other stuff to take care of tonight, so he was not able to be live. But he'll be back next week, as will we. So, let's get into some gaming news. Loki. So, Sony has confirmed that they don't have any first-party titles coming for the Vita. And I can't say that I'm surprised because they haven't had a lot of first-party titles since... God, what was the last one they had for that? Was it that Media Molecule game? I think the paper one. I don't remember what it's called now. Tearaway. Tearaway, yes. Which they ended up putting on the PlayStation 4. Yes, exactly. So, that was the last one I think that they did for that console. They're basically allowing the third parties to basically shine on that. And that's it. They're focusing on the PlayStation 4. Shine or do the work for our dying console? Uh... Yeah. And sorry to the Vita fans, because no one is going to ruffle some feathers with that comment, but at the same time, come on. If Sony themselves is like, eh, we're not really interested in developing for it, what does that tell you? It's on its way out. They're just not making the money back on it. You've seen the writing on the wall for a while with that console. They're not making the money back on it. And that's fine. I think that third parties should be able to do well on it. But this kind of pisses me off more that we don't have something like PlayStation Mobile again where you could easily publish to it and be able to put a lot of those indie titles out there. Because that'd be awesome to be able to... You want a PlayStation Ouya? I want a PlayStation that just has, you know, the same kind of app store like an Android or maybe not so much like Android or iOS because there's a lot of shit on there. But maybe like Steam. I mean, Steam has a lot of shit on there too, but it's a lot less, I think, because there's a little bit of a barrier of entry to that. But I'd like to see something like that, that at least has, there's a way to get your content out there. So I think that was a pretty cool idea. It's just it wasn't something that was promoted. It's like they have these programs where they're like, eh, we're just not gonna really do anything with it. Like they'll announce it and they'll get all excited about it and they're like, eh, oh, yeah, we do have that, don't we? Oh, well, fuck it. It's gone. I'd be really curious to see that post-mortem expose on the PlayStation Vita in like five years from all the insiders on what the fuck happened. But here's the other weird thing, though. You know, we say all this, but then every week here on the show, I'm reading Japanese release dates, and there's something on the Vita every week in Japan. Granted, it's not Sony, but maybe that whole third parties are gonna carry it thing is working overseas in a way it's not working here. I think it's just the difference in culture because you have a lot of people that are taking mass transit, you know, to places and they have time to kill and it's time to play these games. It's more of a portable, you know, it seems to be more conducive to like portable gaming. But people here seem to just use their phones. Yeah, they use their phones for that, but I just don't think it's like, I don't know, I don't think that you can get the same experience with it without the buttons and everything. I don't want to play, I have Minecraft on my phone, I bought it, I don't want to play it because it doesn't support a controller, which is stupid. So I don't want to play it that way. Akuma JP in chat who happens to be in Japan says, Bingo, Loki. I'm assuming what you're saying about why it's succeeding in Japan where it's not doing so well here in America. But it's not like we don't have mass transit. They tried like to make this console, it was way too expensive when it came out. They have like, oh, look, it's gonna have like mobile in it, you can get mobile data plans through AT&T, which it was like, ooh, 3G. Oh, by the way, it can't really do anything over that, other than just you can do the asynchronous, you know, game multiplayer or some shit like that, like Ghost Racing. It's like, no one wanted to do that. They wanted to have it where you can play like actual people over the internet and stuff like that. And maybe now that's something that they can do. I would love to see them put out another portable console that wasn't shit, I don't know. Well, Bonds006 in chat says, Dear Sony, the Vita just had to take away almost 30 years of Ninty handheld presence. That was a huge uphill battle. Yeah, but I don't think Nintendo is necessarily insurmountable either. I mean, when we get into some of the NX predictions about how Nintendo is really going to make an ecosystem out of their dominant handheld in their system, that's gonna be very interesting, you know, if those rumors pan out or whatever. But, I mean, Nintendo is not insurmountable because, let us not forget, the 3DS, there was a moment where people were questioning if the 3DS was gonna make it. And Nintendo really pushed out some of those first-party things that people were really hoping for. I think it was like when a Mario Kart game came out. Yeah, like Mario Kart and Animal Crossing and the new Super Mario Brothers. Yeah, it kind of all came out all at once to really pull that console up. Sony had an opportunity to strike, and they kind of did with the PSP, but I'm not sure they ever really supported the PSP in the same way. Well, Sony, that's the thing, the problem was they put it to like, oh, we're gonna have these other companies port over our games to that console, and that was the problem. They were like, oh yeah, we're gonna have Call of Duty, and we're gonna have Resistance, and I was like, fuck yes, mobile Call of Duty? That's gonna be amazing. And then the Resistance game came out by the same developer of the Call of Duty game, and it was terrible. It was fucking garbage. And I was like, uhhhh, I'm not sure if I want to play this Call of Duty game, and then the Call of Duty game comes out, oh, it's fucking terrible too. It's like, why did you do that? Why did you entrust your most popular franchises to garbage? And I have to do the research, but I think it might be the same company that put out the last Tony Hawk game too. Maybe, I don't know. I don't know about that, but yeah, you can't do that. You can't just have this first-party title that's gonna really carry the console, and just shuffle it off to some company that might be able to do it. DungeonBuster in chat says, nice hardware, but kind of hard to break Nintendo's vice-like grip without the kind of third-party title glut that have driven Nintendo's handhelds. So interesting when you compare that to the situation that Wii U's been in, though. It's so, I mean, like, I don't know, it's so crazy to me. Also, in chat, Oh, IkumaJP kind of clarifying what was said, or no, saying bingo again for Loki, saying, the Vita has bells and whistles, but most we don't need. And I can hear that, because, yeah, I have a 3G Vita. Why? Why do I fucking have a 3G Vita? I really, I mean, I only bought it because it was on sale on Amazon. It ended up being just as much as like a Wi-Fi one would and it had a game with it or whatever. But, like, there really was no fucking reason to have a 3G Vita. No, there wasn't. It didn't do anything. I was not going to pay for that data plan. Why didn't it do online gaming over 3G? I think that scared AT&T and all these, because, you know, as everything in voice is going unlimited minutes, unlimited minutes, we're seeing these mobile companies start to gouge the shit out of data, which we all know is not that expensive, but like fucking Verizon or somebody this week, didn't they just come out and say, well, we'll let you keep your grandfathered but now we're going to charge you, like, something like, it's up to like 40 bucks a month now for Verizon's unlimited data plan, if you want to stay on it. So it's like, these wireless companies know that data is their bread and butter, so I think they were afraid of all that multi-player gaming stuff. Well, here's the worst part about those companies. They'll have their advertised rates. Oh, but there's a line access fee that's like $20 that you have to pay in order to have access to all that high-speed data and everything. So that, yeah, that was the thing with Verizon. Like, I was like, hey, well, shit, that's 40 bucks a month, you know, or whatever. You know, that's like, you know, what I'm paying now, plus it's, you know, unlimited minutes, so hell, I'm going to do that. And they're, oh, yeah, but it's also got, there's this access fee that you have to pay. Like, well, that wasn't advertised here. Oh, yeah, but there's that small asterisk that you didn't see there. Geez. It's okay. It ended up with my employee discount. It's like 10 bucks more than I was paying before. Um, AkumaJP says, When he was in the dump at the time, remember the PlayStation 3 was not selling and people were letting go. That's why Allgame win third party. Tigerklonchat says, Those that are grandfathered in with unlimited data isn't really unlimited. The minute you reach a certain cap, they will throttle your connection even if it's still unlimited. Yeah, I know, because I have AT&T and it's the same thing where, you know, I'll get a nasty text like, I don't know if I should be admitting this, but like six or seven days into the month, I'll get my text that says you're almost at your bandwidth cap and you're gonna get throttled. And I guess they probably do throttle me, but I don't, I actually don't notice it. What I've read is that they throttle during peak times. But peak times are probably when I'm driving to and from work and I'm not really using much data outside of maybe Waze. You know what I mean? Uh, yeah, I don't use much, okay, well, I do use a lot of data now just because of stupid Ingress, but, um, aside from that, I'm not, because Ingress is the most expensive free game I've ever played. Why? What the fuck is it doing that's using so much data? Pinging where I'm at? I mean, uh, the portal pictures, the maps. The pictures are so fucking tiny. There's no way that that's like a big data thing that's like sucking, what, like a one megabyte picture? Whoo! I mean, there's no way that that shit is fucking taking up all that bandwidth. Cache that shit. I mean, come on. Whatever, but yeah, I use about a hundred, it's about a hundred megs, I think, an hour, maybe, that you play that for no reason. Yep, I know, I know. Anyway, uh, so we got on a bit of a tangent there, but, uh, no, I really hope the system does well. I mean, I think it's pretty nice. It's a little, ergonomically, it could use a little bit of help, but it was nice that they had the dual analog sticks and everything. The back touch thing was absolutely fucking not necessary at all. Um, it could have used maybe a second set of, um, rear trigger, or, you know, rear shoulder buttons. That would have been nice. Um, that's about it. The front facing camera, totally not fucking necessary. Actually, a camera at all on those fucking devices, not fucking necessary. Even the 3DS. Yeah. The 3D picture thing is kinda cool. Um, it was cool for a minute. For a minute, yeah, and then, like, I don't know, it was just kinda lame. What games use it? That people actually play? Don't give me that AR games and all that. The people don't use it. No, the AR cards too. Both systems. The AR cards. That was fucking stupid. No one needs that. Alright. Well, moving on. Maybe things should just go back to the way they used to be. At least that's where Square Enix might be headed. Uh, interesting because they released their annual report, which, you know, we're getting to the end of the financial year for various companies. So Square Enix put out their annual report about, you know, where the money's made and all that. And an interesting passage from their annual report, and this is a quote from that, says, Well, at the same time, have new customers enjoyed the IP as though it were brand new? By not only optimizing single pieces of IP for single platforms, but also rolling out IP in a multidimensional manner to meet the needs of the modern market, we believe we can deliver exciting new experiences. So, interesting because they basically say, they're gonna go back and reinvent stuff they did on old consoles for new technology. So, like Chrono Trigger on the Oculus Rift. Who's ready for it? Yeah. Obviously, I'm jumping into conclusion here. Come on, that's a franchise you haven't touched in a while. I could think that would do well. Hell yes. Oh my god, that's a great one. Good answer. Dark Sakura, is there a classic Square Enix franchise you'd like to see them reinvent for the newer technology that's out there? No. No. Actually, yes, I do have one. And I would... Day one. Day one. Ur-guys. Ur-guys would be good. No, no, not ur-guys. Super Mario fucking RPG. Super Mario RPG. Might be difficult. Why would it be difficult? Because of the whole Nintendo. Unless... Come on, Nintendo. Come on. You know. Let's get your tinfoil hats, everybody. Get the aluminum foil out of your kitchen drawer. You ready, everybody? Get them out. Get them out. Make your hat. Put it on. Here we go. Here we go. Here goes Rob justifying how Super Mario RPG could be in the remakes right now. Here's how it is. Do you remember a couple months ago, there was a rumor floating around that Nintendo for the NX was majorly in bed with a third-party publisher. And some people were speculating that publisher was Square Enix. What if... What if... Nintendo's letting them do a new Super Mario RPG as a launch title for NX? That'd be cool, but I don't think that's gonna happen. As quick as you were to fanboy about that, you should just miss that. I think they would do like a Dragon Quest game or something like that. Because they could kind of publish first-party stuff. 12's already been announced for 3DS and PlayStation 4, so unless... It would be cool. I would be down with that. But I don't think that would be something that most... It's not gonna get the casual audience to come over to the NX. It would get the hardcore fans of RPGs and stuff to come over. Unless they make it approachable enough for them. As fun as tinfoil hat moments are, I think in reality, that moved on to the Mario and Luigi series that you see on handhelds. I know it's not the same, but that's kind of you know, where things are at. Come on, you can do it all epic and shit like fucking Kingdom Hearts and stuff. ActDeft in chat says I'm surprised it hasn't appeared in the Wii U virtual console. You know, me too, although I'm sure it's rights. Again, agreements, sign-offs, things like that. Licenses that expired and so on. That's why it doesn't show up on virtual console. But anything is possible. Dare to dream, you guys. Dare to dream. Let's see, what else do I want to say on that whole thing about the remakes and so forth. So Dark Soccer, you're against it, right? I just don't care. You don't care, or you don't want them to do it? If they want to do it, they can do it. It doesn't mean we have to buy it. Well, they're going to want to make things that hopefully you buy, though, Dark Soccer. They don't want to just make something to make it, because making games costs a lot of money. If I don't want it, somebody else out there might want it, so it doesn't really matter what I think. Can someone like, I know this isn't Square Enix, but can someone like maybe get a hold of Namco Bandai and say, hey, you know what, can you guys just stop sucking for a second and actually just make a good new Ridge Racer game? I mean, it's kind of sad that we don't have a Ridge Racer game launching a new console platform. It's been a long time since like, what, the PlayStation, well, the PlayStation Vita had a Ridge Racer title. That's where it kind of went downhill. It was like, fucking, oh hey, yeah, it's like 30 bucks for this demo, and then you got to buy all the tracks and all the cars. Now, fuck that shit. I'm talking about just like, a good Ridge Racer game to launch a platform. Maybe they should upscale R4. I'd be down to that. Well, the chat room's here to correct me when I misspeak, and act-deft in chat says it is on the Wii Virtual Console. Mario RPG, I guess, is on the Wii, which you could launch into backwards compatibility mode on the Wii U, which I... That's a whole other thing. No wonder I forgot. How convoluted is that? That I have to launch into the Wii backwards compatibility to see the stuff that's on the Wii. It's so crazy that the Wii could run that, but the Wii U, I can't emulate that Super Nintendo game. Hold on, let me pull out my old ass cell phone that can emulate that game. Just perfectly fine. Well, back to what I was saying, is that I think that there are going to be people out there who want to get it. For me, I'm not their target audience when it comes to this. So, if they put out something and I want it badly enough, then yeah, I'll get it, but chances are, I already have it. This is going to be for the people who didn't hold on to their original consoles, or don't have some of these old games who are, you know, super nostalgic for them. Um... I don't think I'm their target audience for this, so... Sometimes, I like the idea of a remake, though. I'm okay with a remake outside of the original, you know what I mean? Like, it doesn't always have to play just like the pure original. Like, I'm okay with a remake once in a while. Now, if they updated and re-released Do Prism, or Threads of Fate, or The Guardian Legend. I'm talking about Squeenix. They couldn't redo The Guardian Legend and have it be the same thing. Square Enix could I don't know, give somebody a handy and get the rights to it somehow, come on. I want a sequel that plays the same, but the first game was perfect as it is. It's fair. Alright, well, by the way, trying something new now that Twitter has polling built into it, and I know we can do polls at VOG Network, too, with the live audience, but I thought, oh, I see this feature on Twitter, let's try this. Ask a question in advance, we can gather some responses. So, we asked our listeners over at Twitter.com slash OLR before tonight's show, Square Enix saying they plan to remake more old IPs. Is this good news or bad news? 82% says good news. This is good news. Only 18% saying it was bad news. Thanks to you guys for responding over there. That's a pretty big majority there saying that's good news. I'm fine with it. I understand why people say bad to that. I totally get it, because it takes the resources away from inventing on new stuff, but again, I think once in a while the reimaginings can be pretty good. I don't want them to be on mobile phones. A lot of the bad sentiment comes from that. There are new things though that Square Enix came up with that have been really good. Seriously. Well, don't forget that Square Enix has the IDOS stuff and the stuff that they make here in the States. The recent Tomb Raider reboot, for example, one could argue that's a reimagining of a classic IP that worked out very well. Rise of the Tomb Raider is something we're all looking forward to, right? Generally, the public is. I think that might be an example of where this could be exactly the type of thing they're talking about, right? Taking an old thing and making it relevant for the newer consoles. I don't know. Just a thought on that. To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Under Radio at bognetwork.com, use the passphrase coffee. Dungeon Buster says, also, Square Enix needs money to make new things too. Deus Ex and Tomb Raider can't do it alone. All right. Well, let's move on to some more news here, and we'll get more of your thoughts here later in the show. For now, Dark Soccer. We have some shady business going down at Harmonix. Ooh. What happened is that some of the Rock Band 4 developers went onto Amazon and gave their game five-star reviews without identifying themselves as having worked on the game. Three in question were Matthew Nordhaus, Jane Tan, and Chris Foster. Basically gave themselves five-star reviews and just, you know, pretty much said, oh, the game's great. We're doing this with our family. Well, Harmonix has come back out after they got, you know, outed on Reddit. They said, and this is the official statement, that they have clarified their internal policy about posting reviews on our own products on retail sites. And we've asked that existing reviews be edited to identify Harmonix employees or be removed entirely. Um, so they're like, ugh, they caught us. So, here's a smack done on it. And one of the people who did it, he went on and said, I added the review half in jest, as you might be able to tell from the tone of the original. In hindsight, it's probably important that I know that I worked on the game and worked for Harmonix. Um, so they've gone back and said, oops, we are bad. But still, they should have known better. Yeah, I think that's a dangerous thing to mess with. I worry because these people have been, like, individually identified, which kind of sucks for them because I just, I just think of all the crimes in the world you can commit, this is not, I mean, I don't know. And people would be like, Rob, ethics, dah, dah, dah, dah. And I'm like, okay, yeah, but we're talking about Amazon reviews, people. But it's about ethics in video games. Don't. But the thing is, we're not talking about some type of, like, payola thing where, you know, a reputable website published this huge review or whatever. Like, shouldn't you fucking take Amazon reviews with a big grain of salt anyway? Like, that's my whole thing, is I'm almost like, I wouldn't, I don't know, I wouldn't take them that seriously. So, I don't know. But I also, at the same time, I see, like, you get in this really dangerous place, you put your company in an odd place when you do something like this, and I worry for those guys, because I think they just did, like, a silly thing, and I would hate, like, now that this is all just being dragged out there, because there's no other gaming news going on, that something, you know, is going to happen to these guys. And I just really hope not, because I just think of all the crimes in the world, is leaving an Amazon review really the biggest breach of ethics you can think of? I don't know. Maybe I'm just, maybe I'm just naive, but I don't pay attention to any of that stuff anyway. It's like Yelp reviews. I, I take Yelp reviews with a huge grain of salt, because either people had a bad experience, and they raised the place all the time on Yelp, or they had a good experience, or know the owner, or a friend or family or whatever, and leave a five-star review. There's, like, nothing in the middle. I, you know, I don't know, you can't trust that stuff. You just can't. It's all extremes on one end or the other. I don't know. But also, to be fair to harmonics, I mean, is this really the first or the last time this stuff has happened? I don't think it is. I know it's not the first time, and it definitely won't be the last time. Because I know we had stuff, wasn't it actually with a Telltale game that came out? Like, there was some positive reviews on Metacritic or something in the user reviews, I want to say. It was one of the ones that was kind of, was it Jurassic Park? Or one of the ones that wasn't as well received to see others got some review. I don't remember. Don't quote me on that. But it was something out there I seem to remember. Going to our chat room over at live.vog.network.com Tigerhonchat says, it's especially bad if the game a developer worked on was bad from the beginning, and they try to put a positive review on it. Let's see. Bonds006 says, I was waiting for anti-Yelpers. Let's see. Cial says, oh sorry, that was a comment on the last story. Bonds006 also says, so is that a ban hammer or not for in-house workers? Well, you know Amazon's trying to take, because they want their reviews to be taken seriously, Amazon's trying to take steps kind of against that whole thing. Didn't they come out this week and say they were going to sue people that were leaving, like, they were being paid to leave five star reviews on products? I mean, another reason why you can't trust these reviews in the first place. I don't know. I mean, it's not a review, but I know that EA, I think, had told its employees to vote against, it was either EA or Comcast that tried to vote against, you know, them as the worst company in America. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, gosh. Uh, yeah. You know, I mean, and getting your employees to vote and your friends and stuff to vote, like, I think here locally, I'm sure every town does this. Don't you have some type of newspaper or TV station that does a best of the town type of competition? Because I know it happens here in Sacramento. There's some type of, like, best of Sacramento. I don't remember who does it. It's one of the local TV stations, I think. And, like, I've actually gotten a little thing with my receipt that says, vote for us in this competition, dah, dah, dah, dah, and go to this website and vote for us so we can win and all this stuff. So, I mean, it's not that different from the podcast awards, all things considered. Anyway. Uh, Brad from Pod Culture, and I think this is probably the right way to do it, says, I always throw out the top and the lowest scores, and I read the middle stuff. It's probably the way to do it. Or, you can really only trust your friends. I think that's another thing for me. We'll get into this topic again a little more later on in our FUGL Question of the Week, but for now, let's move on with some more stories. Loki. Alright. So, Microsoft is gonna focus now on, primarily, Xbox Live usership. And I think the reason for this is because not only do they not gonna be kinda struggling a little bit with console sales, but, hey, Xbox Live, that could be on, you know, Windows and on, you know, the Xbox consoles, maybe even Windows Phone. So, of course, they wanna, you know, strive to have more Xbox Live users, you know, maybe more spending that way, and they don't necessarily need to sell the brand new consoles, because, hey, you have got a lot of people who have Xbox 360s still. You know, I'm actually finding myself in kind of that predicament where it's like, you know, my Xbox Live membership is running up, I think, early next year, and I really haven't played anything on Live that justifies me continuing that, since I don't have an Xbox One, so, I'm probably not. But, yeah, apparently, they're saying that they're not using console shipments as their primary metric for success, but they've, they're focusing more on engagement, leading to choose Xbox Live usership as its statistic for that, and basically indicating that they have 39 million Xbox Live users right now. And they're trying to get it up. Usership, I guess, up is up 28%. Well, I suppose this is a nice way to put a spin on a situation that otherwise might not be all good news for Microsoft. I mean, maybe they're kind of, this sounds to me like, and you might disagree, but it just kind of sounds to me like they're just kind of, I don't want to say throwing in the towel, but they're kind of admitting that if they keep comparing themselves to Sony PlayStation numbers, that number is looking more and more insurmountable. Or maybe, like, maybe it's just like PR spin for investors type thing, like, oh, well we're not really, it's cool, we're not really competing against you, Nintendo, we're not really competing against you, we're on our own thing, we're just going to look at, you know, Xbox Live usership, which is way higher, because we've got way more people than PlayStation Plus, that's what they're probably looking at. Well, and to be fair, on the flip side, I mean, yeah, they still make quite a bit of money from Xbox Live, I mean, it's what, 50, 60 bucks a year? Well, yeah, and think about, you know, manufacturing consoles. Over five years, that's as much as a console. How much are you making per console? I mean, you're probably losing money on each console, so I mean, yeah, might as well have as much usership as you can. And the other thing, you know, is, I've been reading that they've been pretty shy on talking numbers of units sold, it's more difficult each time when those NPD numbers come out to see what are you guys selling? Interesting. Especially now that the new rules were that I don't think they have to even divulge that stuff. Yeah. An anonymous chat in our chat, 648 says, I'm sticking with the PlayStation 4 and the PC at this point. Maybe that's what Microsoft needs to do more of, is how to differentiate themselves more from the PlayStation 4, and I guess, I mean, to be fair, I do feel like that's been a big tone of theirs this year, is really pushing those exclusive games that are only going to be on Xbox One this holiday, like you know, the Rare Replay and Tomb Raider and Halo 5, I keep wanting to say Crackdown but that got pushed back, so not Crackdown, but you know, Gears of War, that whole thing. So, you know, that's what Microsoft's kind of trying to do, is how to differentiate themselves. To be fair, their lineup for first party titles is way better than Sony's right now. I mean, that's just, this holiday they've knocked it out of the park. Sony, nope, they have not. I mean, they have Uncharted, which that's not even coming out this year. The Uncharted Collection, sorry, a collection of old games does not make a blockbuster you know, first party lineup for the holiday. Oh, but you've got those exclusives with Destiny and fucking Call of Duty. I'm sorry, that doesn't sell consoles either. Bonds006 in chat says, so these companies who in the past shouted from the hills about MPD stats are now trying to hide underperforming products in a number maze. Let's see, some comments on the Wii U actually in chat, Dungeon Buster saying I haven't really felt compelled to get an Xbox One yet, but I'm actually leaning more towards a Wii U. Well, I don't, you know, again, I think, especially now that we're years into the Wii U's cycle, there's so many games now that you're missing out on. I honestly, if you're thinking about a Wii U, I might still hold off on that, just because, you know, you're going to invest into a Wii U right now, then all of a sudden, oh hey, NX, fuck the Wii U, we're done with that, you know, because I can see that totally happening, and just maybe give it a few more months until we start hearing the E3 news and kind of see what their plan is with that. Wait for a price drop or E3. Because, yeah, because I'm worried that if you jump in right now, eh, I mean, Zelda's going to be cool, and god, I hope it's still coming out in the Wii U, but like, eh, I don't know. They may try to pull that, you know, shit where they did that with, was it the GameCube and the Wii, you know, oh hey, Zelda, it's on the Wii now. Yeah, a lot of people think that could be where it's headed, we'll see. Well, anyhow, Xbox Live, you know, for better or for worse, is a place where, you know, you can get called nasty things by all sorts of strangers, and soon, this could be coming to PC. Okay, it's not really the same thing, it's actually a little bit different, but here's the deal. Blizzard has actually been shown that they are going to be testing some voice chat systems in their Battle.net client. So, right now, voice chat is going to be in beta when Overwatch goes into beta testing, which I believe is in days, I think that is on Tuesday, when the Overwatch beta starts, although really only the people in the super special secret Blizzard club are going to be in that at first, and then they'll start rolling that out to more and more people, I'm sure, as time goes on. So, Overwatch is going to get those betas, that'll start being streamed on Twitch, for sure. That'll be the big, the people that always pimp Blizzard products on Twitch will get those beta keys, so that they start streaming it, and it's all going to be positive, because they're already really into Blizzard stuff. So, that'll, you'll see that on Tuesday, probably. But, anyhow, as part of the Overwatch beta FAQ, Blizzard is calling this new system Battle.net voice chat. So, it's not Overwatch voice chat, it's Battle.net voice chat. And they say, with voice chat still in its early development and testing stages, it's too early to say which Blizzard games will be supported and when. So, that could be very interesting, because, you know, not only will you possibly be able to talk to each other in Overwatch, but you'll be able to, maybe, I would say if it's a Battle.net voice chat thing, maybe you'll be able to talk to somebody in World of Warcraft, while you're playing Diablo, or something like that. You could actually talk across those channels. Now, something to note, is that World of Warcraft did have voice chat in it, I think still does. Nobody used it right after it first came out. And everybody went back to using TeamSpeak and Ventrilo, or Skype even, than using the built-in. Why? Because the options on the built-in voice chat were extremely limiting to the point it was useless. Because you couldn't control volume very well at all. I remember it was very hard to hear. The quality was really bad. I don't know if it was trying to share processing with the game itself, or what, but it just had so many problems. So, I hope if they're building this voice chat into Battle.net, maybe it's running on a separate process, or a separate application. If I'm playing Diablo with say, Shane or somebody over Skype, and we're both on Skype, and playing Diablo, it's fine. It's a great experience. All Blizzard needs to do is to build that Skype-like thing into the Battle.net client, and they'll be fine. But that could be interesting. That could also be very doom-impending for TeamSpeak and Ventrilo type of stuff, if it takes off very well and is of good quality. We'll see. Let's see, going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com bonds006 says, and there goes the already fucked up PC chatrooms, adding voice. I know where that will go. I'm hoping that it's something where you have a lot of control over it, where it's limited to just your friends. Because I would not want to play an Overwatch match at all, and get voice chat. And I have a feeling Blizzard doesn't want to go there with it either, because they know what's going to happen if they just enable voice chat. Because people can be really mean in Heroes of the Storm, for god's sake. God, people are so rude in those types of games sometimes. I can't imagine they're just going to open up voice chat for everybody. But, if I'm in a party, like let's say Grandpa, myself, and Nextifer or something all want to play Heroes of the Storm together, we should be able to hit a button and open up a voice chat channel very easy. Be nice. Anyway. Cial from our chatroom says, third-party chat will never die. I suppose I could see where there's still always kind of a use for a third-party chat. When I'm playing Wii U, if I'm playing Splatoon on Wii U, I still have to use Skype. There's no voice chat there, so I guess that's true. But no, I don't think third-party voice chat will ever die. But it'll take a big hit, I think, if some of these games go to it. I don't know. That's what I think. Anyhow, let's move on. Dark Soccer. Well, this is probably the big reason why we've seen a lot of crackdown on ads for YouTube. You know, why they've really been trying to get rid of the ad blockers and whatnot. Google announced that YouTube Red is coming out, which is an ad-free subscription service for YouTube. It will start on the 28th of October for $9.99 a month, and will let you watch YouTube without ads. Meanwhile, some of us who remain unnamed are using the specific ad block for YouTube, and not getting ads either. But they're supposed to be doing a 30-day trial right after it launches, so you can see if you like it. Okay, I mean, you can also play videos in the background while using apps on your smartphone when you're running it through the smartphone app. I think that was a really stupid name to pick, because surely you all know about RedTube. You're pure and innocent. Have you heard about RedTube? No, but there's more cinnamon buns. There are definitely some buns on RedTube, let me tell you. I don't need to know about that, la la la la la. Among other body parts. So I just think that was a really clueless name to pick. But also kind of puts their branding in competition with Brand Red. Oh, I didn't even think about that. Interesting. Well, I've also found it very interesting. I don't know if you guys, either of you, have heard about this. The way they're kind of like strong-arming some of their biggest content creators to basically accept the deal, or if we're going to lock all your videos private and all this shit. I don't know how I feel about that. I feel like because YouTube doesn't have a lot of competition in that space, they can kind of get away with that shit. Because where else are those content creators going to go? Where else are they going to go to put up videos like that on a mass scale to be discovered and make the kind of money they do on YouTube now? And I feel like Google or YouTube kind of knows that and is why they can strong-arm them into this deal, but there's a part of me that feels like, is that totally legal, what they're doing? Aren't they kind of begging to be sued? But they probably can't be because I'm sure part of the agreement you make when you agree to cash the check from YouTube is you're not going to sue us over contract change. The other fun thing too is that they're blocking specific games from YouTube as well. So for example, because these companies, I guess, haven't taken the agreement yet in some Japanese companies, games like Attack on Titan, Hatsune Miku, Project Mirai 2, BlazBlue Chrono Phantasma, they are not able to be seen in the US. Any videos that get content ID matched for those, they are blocked in the US because the companies that make those games have not taken the deal for YouTube Red. I just, how can this be legal? I just still do what the fuck they want. But, you know, and now what's interesting is that, you know, Twitch is making more of a play for the on-demand gaming type of stuff. So, I mean, some of these games I'm sure you could find on Twitch, no problem. I just think it's, like, pretty ballsy of them to say, hey, we're going to offer ad-free, um, ad-free usage for 999 a month and people are like, I just, I've been using an ad block. I don't, maybe it's just me. I, I, would you guys pay for content that you look at on YouTube? Because there's a lot of, and I say, I've created YouTubes and I wouldn't want people to have to pay to watch what I've done. Nope. And, and, and, if they're going to try to do this shit where it's like, hey, this PewDiePie's got a fucking exclusive new video series that's behind this paywall of YouTube Red, I guess I'm just never going to see it because that's what's going to end up happening. Or is someone just going to fucking dump that shit and fucking re-upload it on their channel or, I'm just sorry, it's just, you, you've been giving this out for free for so long, it's going to get pretty hard to give, make people pay for it now. Imagine if Facebook started charging 999 a month for, you know, something. Don't start another copy paste post on everybody's wall. I'm just saying, you know, I'm not paying for this. Period. I'm not going to pay for it. If I don't want to watch ads, then I will just use ad block. I would pay for it if there was something worth paying for. I pay for Netflix because they've got some fucking great original series that you can watch very conveniently and easily. Orange is the New Black, I mean, the new season aside, the first two seasons were really good. I, Sense8 was fucking amazing. Gracie and Frankie or whatever that show is called with the broads from 9 to 5. I like that show a lot. And, you know, there's a lot of really good Netflix original stuff, so I don't mind paying for that stuff. But now this pool is getting really diluted because everybody wants money for their content, but it's like, you know, you've got to have really good exclusive content for me. Yeah, exactly. And that's the thing, too, is like... I would not fucking pay for PewDiePie and Tyler Oakley and The Drunk Chef. I'm not going to pay for that. I have no problem with them doing their thing. That's fine. But, like, I'm kind of, I'm not worried for them, but, like, they're literally making it difficult to do their thing on YouTube. Now they're making them sign these deals to be on this, you know, YouTube Red type stuff. Game companies are being blocked from having their content on the service. Other game companies are fucking blocking people from using it or taking their ad revenue because they want to do their shit. It's like, it's getting so fucking complicated. This is great for indies. I'm telling you that much because indie guys are like, what the fuck is going on? Just play my game. I would love it if you played my game. I'm not going to do anything. You play my game? Cool. We're done. That's it. You know what would have shut YouTube up is if these big creators, their bread and butter, the creators, had banded together and said, no, shove it. Like, we're going to go to this other site unless you give us a better deal type of thing or, you know, you give the user more freedom. They really should have, but unfortunately that didn't happen. We're going to go to this other site. Which site? Yeah, which site? Somebody in chat said Daily Motion, but it's just, I know that's a video site, but it's not, you know, I don't know, it's not the kind of thing, but now is the time for those types of sites to strike. Somebody could make, you know, these big creators an offer and possibly siphon some of the content. But the Content ID, though, it's just, it's greed by this publisher, by these publishers. I mean, and don't get me wrong, I think it's cool to protect artists' rights and stuff like that, but that's not what they're doing. They're just protecting publisher rights and wanting to be able to sell that content at a premium. Instead of like, hey, this song was licensed for this video game and it just happens to be in the background of this video of the video game because it's part of the video game. Oh, but let's copyright strike these because god damn it, you didn't license that song to be played on your channel. It's way too complicated. It shouldn't be this complicated. Bonds006 in chat says, the companies that once all supported CISPA are now getting forced to their knees by YouTube. YouTube will now be the new grandfather of online free media. So. Bonds006 says YouTube already has them by the balls. It's YouTube's way to get the fuck out. And I know I've called this out before, as I'm sure a lot of you guys have too, as part of the problem with YouTube is that there isn't, this is why competition, and I'm not usually the type to get up there and go like rah rah rah capitalism. But in this such of a narrow, and don't get me started on political stuff, don't read too much into what I just said. When we don't have any type of competitor for YouTube that competes with them on that level, this is what happens. You know what I mean? Like this is why there needs to be that type of competition and this is why and I've kind of said this about Twitch too, right? Twitch was so dominant that, you know, when their rules went into place, they needed some competition to get them worried. Enter YouTube, ironically enough, to kind of mix that up a little bit. And I think really, based on what we've been hearing out of TwitchCon TwitchCon and all this stuff, it's making Twitch better, because they're having to you know, make sure that they involve themselves to make themselves the better option. And I really want to see the same thing happen to YouTube. And from a gaming standpoint, maybe that will happen, is that these games that are blocked from YouTube, well shit on the PlayStation 4, you're one button press from going over to Twitch. Well it's just like the YouTube gaming stuff. I've never launched the YouTube gaming app. I don't fucking care. I can find gaming videos just fine on YouTube. Like, how could you not find gaming videos on YouTube? That's impossible. I don't understand how people are having such a difficult time in finding gaming videos that they need to create a separate app for that. It's just like, I don't get it. It's like, shit, I can't find any cat pictures on Reddit. If only we had a separate Reddit for cats. I think there is a separate Reddit for cats. I'm sure there is, but I'm just saying that it's impossible to not like, this was never, you came up with a solution for a problem that didn't exist, is what it is. Isn't that called capitalism? It's not capitalism. It's just, it's useless. It's just like, the whole thing was that they were trying to compete with Twitch. Just like capitalism. I would say that's more the other extreme end of it, right? When the corporations are people, right? We know what you want. How many times has that been nails on a chalkboard to you? When a gaming company gets up there and goes, this is what the gamers want. They want microtransactions and all this other stuff, and you're like, fuck a whole lot of you. Because that's so, like you're sitting there going, no, it is not what I want, actually. What gamers want is for you to get your head out of your ass and actually look around. The fucking end. It's not about what you want, it's about what we want. And if we don't want what you're doing, we're gonna go somewhere else. And you know what gamers want? Fuckery. Another fucking Super Mario RPG. That is what gamers want. So if that is not what you're bringing me, get off the stage. You know what we want? What? Zillion three. What do we want? Guardian Legends sequel. When do we want it? Now. Yesterday. SSG100 Matt says, someone needs the capital and the infrastructure to handle a massive amount of data like YouTube. On top of that, said business needs to find profit in that. Where is the immediate profit in a YouTube competitor? You know what though, guys? YouTube didn't start in a day and Facebook started somewhere. And MySpace looked like it was never gonna go away. You know who's evil enough to compete with Google? Facebook. They've got the capital, they've got the resources. Unfortunately it wouldn't be very good, but I'll take competitors as long as they're competing. Maybe that'll fix something. Alright. Anyhow, let's move on. Maybe they can come up with their own service and they'll be called F-Tube. Yeah? Yeah, F-Tube? Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and some video games that you may or may not be streaming to YouTube, but pretty soon. Release dates for games. Loki. Starting in the US. So this week we've got Divinity Original Sin Enhanced Edition coming out on Playstation 4 and Xbox One. A game called Halo 5 Guardians. That's coming out on Xbox One this week. Also the Limited Edition. Fuck, is that really this week? That is this week. That is Tuesday. I feel like I have to buy it, but I don't want to because I've got all these other games I need to be. Then don't buy it right now. But it's Halo. You can buy it, just not right now. I gotta... I need it. What kind of gamer am I if I don't own the newest thing? Rob. Can you eat Halo 5? Can you breathe it? How much barbecue sauce can you drink it? Technically, does it put a roof over your head? Technically, you can eat Halo 5. Oh wait, no, that's Call of Duty Black Ops 3, I'm thinking. Sorry. They're doing a promotion with Carl's Jr. apparently for that. If I duct tape a lot of the discs together, I could make a box to live in out of Halo 5. Don't fucking challenge me, woman. It's not needed for survival. You could hollow out an original Xbox and could have a family of four live in that, but you know, that's not... Anyways, so Minecraft Story Mode, the season pass disc is coming out as well. If you want to just jump into all of those episodes, that's on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One. WWE 2K6 coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One as well. Lords of the Fallen complete edition. That'll be the following week, actually. And that'll be it. OK, so Alan Alchemy in chat said I had to show Jamie what he bought this week. Speaking of, I want it. I need it. Look at this. Yeah. Mass Effect Monopoly something he bought this week. Although, doesn't that look like it's based on Mass Effect 2? Kind of. Yeah. But yet, it says copyright 2015, so I guess it's newer. I did miss one. Dark Ciders 2, the definitive edition coming on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Just in time for Halloween. Also, MX vs ATV Supercross Encore on PlayStation 4. And do you know why he bought Monopoly Mass Effect? Because it was there. Yeah, because he fucking wanted it. Cue the American flag and the theme. I honestly, I knew about it, and I hate playing Monopoly. I really hate playing Monopoly. I don't even play all the five other different collector's versions of Monopoly that we have. Yeah, but this has a space hamster as one of the tokens. You know what? IDGAF. I might have gotten the Mass Effect risk, but I'm not... That's kind of expensive. I didn't care. I'm actually really getting a lot more into Dragon Age than Mass Effect until Andromeda comes out. Until Andromeda's out, yeah. So, I'm content. Fair enough. Alright, let's go over to Japan and check out some of the releases in Japan this week. God Eater Resurrection on the PlayStation 4, a regular and a crossplay pack. Also, NBA 2K16 makes its way to Japan, getting its release on the 29th. Heading over to the Wii U, I think, is still kind of dry this week. They get Lego Jurassic World on November 5th, but that's still a couple weeks away. On the Vita this week, I would expect that we'll probably see God Eater over there, too. Yep, we sure do, because that's that crossplay. Alias Carnival, Sacrament is out this week. Heart no Kuni, no Alice Wonderful Twin World, a new version. Also, Love Revenge, regular and limited edition, Raishi, and Yomawari. Those are all Vita releases. More than any other system I'm going to read this week. Like, that was like, what, one, two, three, four, five, six releases on the Vita this week in Japan. It is such a different story. It just blows my mind. On the Nintendo 3DS this week over in Japan, looks like actually nothing on the 3DS this week. There's some new cases, but that's really it. Otherwise, Disney Magic Castles, which you have to look forward to in two weeks. But, you know, they love Disney in Japan almost as much as we love it here, so Disney releases are a pretty big deal over there, too. Alright, let's go to the UK, Dark Sakura. On the 27th, we have Darksiders which is attached to the Death Initive edition. I'm sorry, I'm full of pumpkin cinnamon roll. It's coming on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. We have Halo 5 Guardians for Xbox One and WWE 2K16 on everything else. On the 30th, Lands End comes out on Android and Shin Megami Tensei Devil Survivor 2 on 3DS. And I'll go ahead and say it on the 31st, we have Five Nights at Freddy's 4, the final chapter. On PC. In the UK. Oh, I was like, wait a minute. I was like, I had to look at it again, because I was like, didn't you guys get that too? I guess not. But don't we get that, isn't that RPG a Halloween thing in the US? I think it is. I felt like that was what was being targeted. Maybe. Alright. This looks like the same shit we got. Alright, well moving on, just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic game of the week. By the way, AkumaJP in chat says I am not kidding. You can get murdered if you say bad things about Disney here. I wish it was like that here. No, I'm just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. But, yeah, no, here, here we have to defend ourselves for being big kids when we're too into Disney a little bit. I don't know, I think actually it's a lot less. I think everybody in their 30s and 40s kind of grew up with all that, so it's kind of less than probably what it used to be. Fuck that, I didn't get to. It was still around you. It was on the gummy bears on TV and stuff. But I didn't get to go to Disneyland or Disney World even. And I think, honestly, neither did I. And I did watch Song of the South at least six times in a row as a kid. I think we made up for lost time. I think that's what happened with me in Disneyland. That's what I have a feeling of. And by the way, the reason why I bring that up is because it was in Alabama and we did have Song of the South on VHS. Now that you can't find it at all anywhere. So, of course, I also lived where the Black Cauldron was also banned. Oh jeez, Black Cauldron is like one of those like and it's butchered up anyway. If it had been like the full thing, that would have been badass. Well, it was most of the fairy tales are kind of butchered up. I mean, in Cinderella didn't they chop the superstitious foot off? Yeah, she cut off her toes. Yeah, they didn't do that in Cinderella. But in the Black Cauldron, they actually had more footage that they cut out to make it less dark. And it made the story not make sense. Because Island Wii was great. I thought of you today and I probably shouldn't be saying this now because you'll probably go, gee, thanks for telling me. But I heard that Don Bluth was at some convention here in Sac today. Yeah, I know about that. Okay, you knew. Yeah, it was like Sac Con or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I thought of you when I saw that because I was like what Don Bluth stans do I know? Oh, Jamie. Well, because Don Bluth before he had his major studio animated the Don't Walk Away scene in Xanadu. I should have had a copy of Dragon's Lair autographed. That would have been cool. I would have just taken my copy of Xanadu. Here, sign this. I'm the one that likes it. Legit. Me and three other people. Alright. Let's see. Loki. Alright, so oddly enough Vivendi has been investing quite a bit in Ubisoft. They made, I guess, 161 million dollar investment last week and now another 111 million dollars this week. And I guess because of that, the stock went up from 6.6% to 10.39%. But of course, it's kind of making them a little bit uneasy. Basically, the CEO Yiz Gamat basically said that the investment is unsolicited and unwelcome. And, you know, they're not sure what exactly their intention is on purchasing all this stock. It was like a hostile takeover, you know, what the case may be in that. But yeah, interesting to see. I know recently what Activision had to pay a bunch of money just to get rid of Vivendi off of their books, basically. So now the alien is looking for another creature to suck dry. Look out! Alright. One more story for you guys. It's about sports games, which I don't talk about a lot on this show. But, you know, it's an important part of what drives the industry and sells consoles and so forth. And if you weren't aware, there's some really interesting stuff going on in the basketball world. You know, 2K Games makes an NBA series. They have the NBA 2K series. And EA has their own NBA Live series. And if you weren't aware, NBA Live last year was not good. In fact, it was really bad. Well, NBA Live was like postponed for a few years because it originally leaked out even. They put it out and then pulled it back really fast. And someone had bought one of those versions and it was just shit. And then they took a couple years off to fix it and then released it and it was still shit. And then the following year, well, it's better this year. Still shit. Well, both these basketball games came out this past month and NBA 2K actually sold 1 million units. NBA 2K16 sold a million units. It came out in the middle of the month. Biggest selling sports game launch this generation. So, I mean, huge launch. Did very well. EA's NBA Live sold 8,000 units. Oh, shit. Compared to 1 million. Yeah, that ain't coming back. Only 8,000 people in the entire country. See, Square Enix, this right here is a disappointment in sales. Not 3 million from Tomb Raider. 8,000. You know which game sold more than 8,000 units? Earth Defense Force fucking sold more than 8,000 units. I think President Cat sold more units than this game did. That's something. And, you know, if you think about it, like, you know, either it's just that 2K has established themselves as this dominant franchise and people are like, I don't need two basketball games. I got this one. Or, it's just the EA's kind of what the series has done before this. The reputation just, it's ruined. It's absolutely ruined and people don't. And it's bad because NBA 2K, I think, has done some shit recently that's been kind of like, eh, you know. I don't follow too much. I know that they're live scanning. The face scanning thing's not working out, but it never has. I don't know. But, yeah, the point, you only have two options, really. I think they should just get, I don't know how long into that exclusive deal that NBA, or, I don't even know if NBA works that way if they have, like, an exclusive deal between those two companies or if other companies can make NBA games. I hope that they didn't pay for a long licensing period because, eh, it's not going to work out. Well, but, you know, they're swimming in buckets of money because of Madden, so. Well, yeah, but, I mean, they could be having more buckets of money if their game didn't suck. That is very true. Alright. Let's take a trip down memory lane, you guys. Dark Soccer's going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be playing this this week. We're going to go back to a time when the only basketball game that mattered was Double Dribble. And I had low standards. Remember when Konami fucking made games like Double Dribble? Maybe we'll get Double Dribble Pachinko someday. Alright. Moving on, Dark Soccer's going to step into the gaming vault and find a game she thinks, hey, you should play this this week. You, you dumb kid. Alright. What is the classic game of the week, Dark Soccer? Super high impact. Now, I have to say why I picked this game. I was like, did we go all sports ball this week? What happened? My brothers and I played the shit out of this game. And we we would, there's like this little guitar thing that plays after you pick your play. We used to make that sound like we were growling at each other. And we used to try to, like, tackle each other until the other person would explode. This game is so over the top. And it was actually one of the precursors to the NFL Blitz series. You remember how kind of oddball that one was. Anyway, super high impact. It was the sequel to High Impact. This one came out by Midway in 1991. And it was just a football game running on a JAMA harness. And it had one button and an 8-way joystick. Ooh. Um, so anyway, with this particular game, you had a, basically your button was like, your pass, your action, your, all of this, you know, it was the one way to decide what happened. Which I honestly didn't care for that so much on the arcade one. Which I did play that a few times. Um. But the thing about this one, it was just really over the top. Um. You could tackle somebody until they would explode into a mass of body parts. You had the hit meter or something. What was it called? It was the hit-o-meter, the whack-o-meter or something. And so you'd get, uh, like a thumbs up or a you know, a rank like awesome if you sacked somebody badly enough. It was just really over the top. And like, they'd say little insults at each other before each play and everything. It was just, just really a silly game. Um. But it was, actually for me, who's always hated football, it was a fun game. It was just really fun. It was easy to play. You could pick your, your plays and everything. And, now the version that I had was the Super Nintendo version that, in my, and now that I recall this, it really did keep a lot of stuff from the arcade version. Maybe not some of the digitized, uh, characters that were in it. Like some of the pop-up people that would show up. Like the manager or the referee. They were all I switched to the Super Nintendo version. Uh, audio here. They were all like, you know, pixel people. They weren't, you know, actually, uh, rendered. Um, but it really had a lot of the same stuff. It had really clean graphics for a Super Nintendo sports game. And it was pretty fun. See, there's somebody going in until they explode. Um, and then, oh, here's this, this is, it was just a fun game. That's the only thing I can say about it. The Super Nintendo and Genesis version came out in 1993 and it was put out by, you know, I had it in here and I don't have it now. Um, I want to say it was put out by Acclaim. That was it. That's the, what is it called, the hit meter? Yeah. So, um, I'll just leave it there. It, you know, it paved the way for the NFL Blitz series, which was, you know, another one in the same line. And that's it. We just don't have fun games like that. You know, sports games like that. They all take themselves too seriously. We need more sports games where people explode into body parts. Exactly, or you get something else. Or like in Blades of Steel where it was all about the fighting sub-game where two people get in a fight. You need the over the top, I mean, like now what we have, Mutant League and what was the other football game that's out on Steam right now? Um, you know, they just don't have that fun anymore. Right. Alright there, touchdown! But that's the SNES version. It has all the same stuff from the arcade version. Yeah. Um, you know, a little, a little, uh, I'd say, uh, panned down, but not, you know, not that bad. And the sad thing is, is that, I tried to find more information about this game and it really, I guess, kind of fell off into obscurity. Um, not too many people, I guess, cared about it. But for me, like I said, I hate football. I hate football games. I love this fucking game. So, that's it. Uh, super high impact. There it is, your classic game of the week. Super high impact. Uh, Dark Tetsuya's Blitz is definitely one of my favorite sports games ever. As 200 Matt says, super high impact is the XFL of football games. Yes! Without being a bad business decision. Alright. Well that is gonna do it for this first part of, uh, Orange Lounge Radio. But don't go anywhere guys, cause we have plenty more show to come including, uh, your football question of the week, your phone call is 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio. We're gonna talk about rapid fire news tonight, uh, some LucasArts, some Grand Theft Auto, and some beer. We'll do all of that when we come back with more after this break of Orange Lounge Radio, right after this. Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio Live tonight, October the 25th of 2015 with episode 619 of our show already in progress. We're gonna get back into some news here, uh, in a bit. First though, I thought, uh, I thought you guys would get a kick out of, um, my story about what I did yesterday. So I went on another, uh, adventure with my friend Shane, which, you know, he's been on the show before. He's not here this week, but he was on the past couple weeks. And, uh, we decided randomly, we were gonna take a trip to Chico yesterday, which, um, Chico's a town, it's a college town, it's about two hours north of here where we tape our show in Sacramento. And I actually lived there for like three years, cause I went to school at Chico State. And, um, that's actually where the radio station there was where I first got into this whole thing. So, uh, there's that. But, uh, we went there for a couple reasons. A, I wanted Mongolian BBQ at a place up there I hadn't eaten at in like over a decade. And it's still as good as I remember it, just for the record. Um, so it was totally worth it. Uh, and then B, uh, we thought we'd do some Ingress up there cause I wanted some unique portals from places I hadn't been yet and Shane is playing more and more. So we decided to go play at a graveyard over there. But C, the most important uh, thing is that we were also uh, kinda doing some of the shopping. Uh, cause you know, uh, Shane he's talked about his Power Ranger uh, addiction here on the show and the toys and stuff that he buys with that. Um, and so we had not gone to the stores in Yuba City, which is on the way. Yuba City's like halfway there. And then Chico is like fully north. So we went to the store in Yuba City in Chico. And uh, there's something about that Toys R Us in Chico. I don't know if we happen to have any listeners up there, but I gotta say that Toys R Us is like trapped in a time machine somehow. And Shane got really excited when he saw that at this Toys R Us they still had like in their aisle with video games. Like had the PS4 games. They had like the laminated one sheet. And you'd have to take the pull slip if you wanted the game and actually go take it up to the front counter cause I don't know how long the Toys R Us got rid of that. But for some reason the store that's trapped in time still had that. And on top of all that stuff, believe it or not, they had one of the toys that Shane was missing at this Toys R Us that time forgot two hours north of Major Metropolis. So you better take me there. And they had tons of amiibo. That's where I saw the Animal Crossing amiibo cards. I was like should I get some for Jamie cause I'm not gonna play that game. And then I just saw, I saw like easily like 40 Shulk amiibo. I mean I already have one at this point but there was easily like 40 Shulk amiibo like in all the I guess Toys R Us. Why didn't you bring me one? I didn't know you wanted one. I kind of don't wanna buy one. There you go. I did and bring you back to video games. I did end up getting amiibo for myself. So I got the blue and pink yarn Yoshi to finish my collections. I have all three yarn Yoshis cause they're kinda cute. And I finally got an adult link cause believe it or not I didn't have one cause I was really mad at amiibo when they first came out. And now that I'm finally getting over it I wanted to go back and get some of the ones I missed out on. So I actually found a link thank God still at one of these stores that time forgot so I was able to buy it. So there you go. Going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com Tigerclaw in chat says speaking of Power Rangers, the Power Rangers movie just cast an Asian actor as the Black Ranger and a Black actor for the Blue Ranger. I think yeah, I think they're trying to be kinda diverse in their casting of the folks which is cool. I think kids want to see themselves represented in the Power Rangers so why not? Sounds fun. Let's see. Also going to chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com I think they're just talking about amiibo in chatroom and finding the different amiibo out there. Somebody recommending that PodCulture joins a local amiibo group. Brad from PodCulture saying he just picked up a link online. Is that local group like an amiibo anonymous? Yeah, amiibo addicts anonymous. Something like that. Probably. I guess I need to join. I think I'm up to 37 amiibo. It's pretty gross. Like, Loki, you could bring your Wii U back and I would have more stuff for you to unlock. Yeah, I haven't played Mario Maker this week. I need to bring yours over to my house, Rob. Yeah? Yeah. I can do that. Please do that and then we can hang out. There we go. It'll be fun. I just need a carrying case. And of course, I'll leave it to Bobby Blackwolf to storm into the chatroom and make the mandatory comment that goes with that. 37 amiibo? In a row? You know what's sad is that reference is getting more and more dated. Didn't that movie come out in like 1997 or something? Like, it's... That reference is getting dated. Don't buy any amiibo on the way out. Oh god, it was 1994. Try not to buy any amiibo on your way out to the parking lot. Alright, let's go over some rapid fire news. Some quick gaming headlines this week. Loki. So this actually made me pretty excited. The fact that they're going to be bringing back Day of the Tentacle, which I think was one of the greatest LucasArts games that they kind of did a sequel to, you know, kind of when they started doing the new games. I love that game. And actually, the... Not really a remake. I guess it's more of a remaster. The remaster looks nice. There's not a whole ton of difference other than it's not pixelated. So, I mean, it's a good game, so I definitely would recommend checking it out when it comes out. They don't really have a date yet when it's coming out, but apparently you would have been able to check it out earlier this week, or last week, during Indicade, which was at LA, and they were running a preview build of that, so... Pretty cool. And I'll be coming out later on. And then with this, Rockstar is adding some new modes to Grand Theft Auto online, including their Lowrider update, which allows you to do all sorts of cool customization of Lowriders and stuff. It's starting to get to kind of what they had in San Andreas, where you can do all the different hydraulics and that kind of fun stuff. But they're going to be adding some new adversaries. I guess Keep the Pace is a new game. I guess it's sort of similar to Speed, the movie, where you have to stay above the minimum velocity or you explode, which is awesome. Offense Defense, which is an asymmetrical mode, with people running towards the end of a route, while protectors are trying to stop them. That kind of sounds actually like the... What was that one that... It was like the... The jet game we played in there was really fun, where there's... That was one of my favorite modes in Grand Theft Auto online. I can't remember what the hell it's called now, but you have people running to get to the end of this checkpoint, and there's people in jets firing at you. It's awesome. It's so intense. I really need to go back and play that. And then, of course, they also have a new scene creator with Rockstar Editor. It allows you to set up different scenarios. You can place props from a catalog of more than 200, and save four settings for different scenes and stuff like that. So, awesome. Have that check it out. And let's see... Last but not least, Tony Hawk, Pro Skater 5. What a mess that shit was. And you may remember that it's also supposed to be coming out on the last gen systems. Supposed to have been sometime in November. However, they're putting it on an indefinite hold. Maybe because they're making their money back with that game, and they're saying, we're working closely with our developers to address the issues identified by the community, like everything. Our development resources are fully focused on fixing the content updates for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, so we have decided to delay the release of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions. Yeah, probably because your game's still broken, so you probably want to fix it before you put out the game. We will update the community when we have more information about the release date. If there's a release date. I don't think there's much of a point at this point to releasing the last gen. I don't think they're going to release it. Yeah, I think it's going to go the way the Mortal Kombat had to do the same thing. Mortal Kombat was a fine game. Yeah, it was fine. They had to compromise too much to get it to run on the old systems, I bet. Anyhow, speaking of having to compromise some things to get it to work, Batman Arkham Knight on the PC. It's finally happening. That's right. Batman Arkham Knight on the PC coming out on October 28th. That will be at 10 AM Pacific time, re-released for the PC. There will also be a patch at that time that brings the PC version fully up to date with content that has been released for console, with the exception of any console exclusives. So, that only took, what, like four months for them to fix all the issues? So, hmm. Well, at least they fixed it, I guess. Better late than never. Hey, as we mentioned in the top of the show, in Jason's intro, Back to the Future week was this week, and there was some little things that happened in celebration on the 21st, including in Rocket League, which I always forget to mention this in my gaming week, but usually once a week I get invited to play in some Rocket League game, just randomly online, and that game is always a lot of fun. And so in Rocket League, there is a DeLorean that you can now drive around in the game. It's available for $1.99 on Steam and the PlayStation 4. The tires apparently flip up in the car as well, so that's cute. Also, you may remember there was a reference to the game Wild Gunman. You remember that game was one of the laser games? That was actually in Back to the Future Part II, because it was something that, as part of the plot, Marty kicked ass at the game. Yeah, Cafe 80s, right? So they actually, in a tongue-in-cheek sort of way, in Europe, they released the Wild Gunman version to Wii U Virtual Console in Europe. I don't know why we didn't get it here, but they got it over there in Europe. Dude, it would be awesome if they made a Cafe 80s in that style of Back to the Future II, just like all that retro futuristic shit. Patent pending. That would be awesome. Don't we have that in the form of coin-op downtown except a bar? No, but I'm talking about with the fucking TV monitors and shit with fucking Ronald Reagan. Loki won't say that he wants the fashion. He wants the fashion from Cafe 80s. You know who does not? Me, because I paid a lot of money in Aquanet, okay? Hey, but hey, you can buy those Nike shoes soon for $9,000. Yeah, fuck that. No one's buying that shit. Well, it'll be a lot cheaper to get a hoverboard in Star Trek Online, that is. Unfortunately, it's only until October 26th. I don't know why this is a limited time thing, but just before they roll out season 11 in Star Trek Online, you can get a hoverboard. That's totally not canon. Yeah, I know, but they made it kind of look like it. It says Flyer Future or something on it. They made it just different enough, but I think it's a cute little wink and nod to Back to the Future. So, there it is. So, you can check that out in Star Trek Online, but you better hurry before tomorrow. Alright, also of very important news, you know we gotta update you on Splatfest here at OLR. We don't, because they inform you of that shit every time we fucking log into that game. Well, anyway, the next Splatfest is happening on October 30th, beginning 9 o'clock. I don't know who's gonna play in this, because everybody's gonna be busy on Halloween. But, here it is, you guys. Pirates versus Ninjas. This is, uh, it's a pretty big debate. The epic battle. The battle to end all battles. I can't pick. I don't know which team to pick. I really don't. I'm leaning Team Ninja solely because they have a better color. They have the purple and the ninjas or, I'm sorry, the pirates kind of have that yucky green. But, I do really like to pirate music. So, I feel like, you know, we should show some piracy pride. And Weebl and Bob had the pirate ninja. But you'd like to not get caught by the companies pirating the music so you have to act like a ninja. So you have to act like a ninja when you do it. That's true. That's very true. But, Disney has the Pirates of the Caribbean ride. Then again, there was that movie, Three Ninjas. I don't know. I just, I can't decide. I can't decide. You have to figure out which one's going to be not as popular because the least popular one always wins. Pirates. You think? You think more people will choose ninja? Do you get free t-shirts or anything for these things? In-game. Yeah, but I never received anything for planes. I didn't get a t-shirt that had planes on it. You don't get the t-shirt. Okay, when you do the Splatfest, you have a Splatfest shirt that has the team logo on it or whatever it is. But you have to turn that in when Splatfest is done. And as a reward, depending on how well you did, you get snails which will modify your existing gear to give it more slots and stuff. That's what the Splatfest is for. That's why they do them every other week. Okie doke. Alright. There it is. Alright, and now everybody in chat is telling me which team to pick. You don't own me. You don't run my life. Alright, I'll consider it. Alright, moving on. Dark Saga. Well, we have a thing that I would like to try except it's only in the UK. And that's Fallout Beer. It's going to be available on Amazon UK and the case will go for roughly \u00a330. \u00a329.99. It will be shipping on November 9th. Somebody in the UK better send me some. Even though it is a Pilsner. I will forgive it because I need to try Fallout Beer. And there's a new Bomberman game. And everyone's super excited except it's for cell phone. So, yeah. That's not as exciting but at least it's not another Pachinko machine. Thank you, Konami. I wish Hudson would come back to life. And last but not least, there's a fan mod out there for the new Resident Evil HD. And it brings back the old voice acting. Apparently they had to go through something like over 500 different audio files to find and replace them with the originals. Where's Barry? That's awesome. You were almost a Jill sandwich. That's my favorite. Yeah. I should have brought back that old thing for fortune cookie. You should have but it's alright. You have something Halloween appropriate. It's somewhere. Yeah. Alright. If that is it for rapid fire news, which I believe it is, we are going to get into the Google question of the week. Every week we go to Facebook and we go to Google Plus. And you combine those together, you get FOOGLE. And yes, believe it or not, people are still on Google Plus. Because we do get answers over on Google Plus to our question of the week. And I'm going to start there tonight. Which the question of the week we asked about, you know, it has to do with that whole issue that Dark Soccer brought up earlier where we had some of the nice employees that were leaving reviews on Amazon. But you know, they weren't the first. They're not going to be the last. So we wanted to ask, knowing that the above happens, do you let user reviews sway you one way or another when buying a video game product? What about when compared to critic reviews? Is one or the other both likely to sway you or neither? ActDeft replied and said, wait, people read Amazon product reviews in a serious manner? That's what I said. You know, I do quite often. Especially if I'm buying something or trying to decide between... But when you know this happens, that people are sandbagging the reviews one way or another? Well yes, not if they're sandbagging the reviews. I mean, you can tell. Well, ActDeft continues, for real though, it's all sorts of shady considering that you may not read the reviews, but you'll look at the rating and hit hits and think, this is a good product based on that one. It may be not. Granted, most people that want Rock Band will probably just buy it and ignore the reviews like most people do with any big triple A game. Retertainment says, between fake Amazon reviews, Twitch streamers getting paid off, and newspaper reviewers not playing the game in full before writing a review. Who can you trust? Answer. The fine people at ORL. That's not... That is actually what he typed. ORL. Who's ORL? Or really? Or really? I know that was a typo, but it was an extremely funny one. I'm sorry. When Loki rants about something, you know it's legit. Now when do I get paid? Come on, positive statements of the internet's gotta be worth some internet dollars, right? I'm sorry, but you forfeit the dollars by misspelling the name of the show. I guess this pumpkin cinnamon roll I was gonna pay you with will have to go to somebody else. Sorry. Alright. And lastly, Martin replied over on Google Plus and said, I trust Amazon reviews for physical products, but do not for games. I do trust certain video game reviewers and you get a sense of whether a game is for you from Twitch streamers and quick looks. Alright, let's go over to Facebook where we had quite a few answers. I'm gonna read some here. Alan Alchemy said, I tend to trust aggregates more simply because even if all critics are awful, when 200 of them all lean in the same direction, it's not really a coincidence. When a movie is 8% on Rotten Tomatoes, even if it's a trash genre to begin with, like a teen slasher, I'm not gonna act like it's secretly good and they're all being haters. Then I'll look at the reader review aggregate score and see if they're widely different, or if it's for a niche game I'd probably buy anyway. TigerClaw says, I don't really let critic or user reviews dictate to me whether a product is good or bad. We've all been in situations where a product had great reviews. We had a bad experience with it. Or a product you had a great experience with, but everyone else gave it bad reviews. So it's really up to your decision if you want it that bad. You believe in it, you buy it. Bryce H. says, I don't let user reviews sway me one way or the other. I'd rather try it first hand or watch somebody else. What's bad for one person may be good for another. CriticalMyth says, positive user reviews rarely sway me. Negative user reviews can if they make specific points that touch on items that would affect my enjoyment of the game. Same thing with pro reviews though. Fabrice A. said, I read several reviews from several sources, both user reviews and professional reviews, and then I compare all the pros and cons from every review. That gives me a solid impression of a game. Andy R. says, I tend to trust critic reviews a slight bit above user reviews, but at this point I've been around the block enough that I rarely use the user or critic reviews to sway my purchases. I feel like I can usually get a grasp on whether I'll enjoy a game based on factors like who is making it or preview materials. Plus I tend to stick to franchises I've enjoyed in the past. Dark Charger says, neither. I usually know prior to any review whether I'm going to buy it or not. I know what I like. Occasionally there will be great reviews for a game that I was not originally considering. I may give that game a second look and have discovered some great games this way. Jordan T. says, I usually try to get a feel for an average of what a game is scoring in reviews. With a secondary interest in the extreme positive and especially negative comments, just see what people zero in on. After that, assuming I don't have previous experience with the game or IP, I'll check out gameplay footage to see if it's something I think I would like. Justin H. says, I admit somewhat shamefully that I love both user and critic reviews. I use Metacritic to discover games I wouldn't play otherwise, specifically for older games and indie games. Reviews have also helped me avoid buying games that turn out to be not as good as perceived, like the first person shooter Brink or Reboot of Thief. Reviews are just a tool, however, and I will buy games with bad reviews if I have a genuine interest in playing them regardless. And lastly, Master Claw says, I find most user reviews completely worthless. They're usually poorly written to a point of being unintelligible and they're never moderate. They're always like, OMG this game's awesome. Best game ever. Five stars. Or, this game sucks balls. I'd give it zero stars if I could. I never played it, but I know it sucks. I wish sites like Amazon would allow filtering out of unverified user reviews. There it is. Comments from our Facebook and Google Plus pages. Thank you guys. A very big variety. I was not expecting such a huge variety, but it's really all over the map. Some people saying nah. Some people saying yeah, I kind of do. Especially a lot of people saying reviews can kind of give that second chance. I guess now in this day and age, I'm kind of on that team where I am looking at the streaming of the game to see if it's something I would like. That's what I did with Dragon Quest Heroes. I originally was like, eh, it's a side game. I don't think it's something I'm going to like. But then I watched some of the streams and I was like, well okay, I'll try it. So I got it. Anyway, there you go. Some of the answers from our Facebook and Google Plus communities. Alan Alchemy saying Amazon does have verified purchase on the top reviews. That's true, but I don't think they filter the star score by only the verified reviews. I don't think there's a way to do that. At least not that I know of. I think that might be what the listener was complaining about there. Tigerclaw saying yeah, watching a Twitch stream of a game is a good way to see how the game is like and that will help you on your purchasing decision. I kind of agree. You have those resources out there. Whether it be Twitch, YouTube, whatever it is you use to look at the actual video from a game, I think is a great way to kind of know what you're getting into. Alright, let's move on. Back into some other news. Loki. So we kind of touched on this last week with Overkill adding some microtransactions to Payday 2. Basically what they were doing originally is that they were starting to get the safe drops at the end of matches and so when you would get the safe, in order to get what was inside of it, which contained cosmetic items, many of which would actually add stat bonuses, you would actually have to pay real money for the drills. So you had to pay $2.50 to purchase a drill to open the safe. Well now, they're kind of stepping back a little bit instead of just having that be the only way you get drills. They're not really getting rid of the microtransactions but they're also going to start having drills drop as part of post match rewards as well. Because before it used to be the only way to get those would be to buy them. So now they're just going to drop as well. So you may not have to buy them, but it's still shit. Yeah, not a lot of happy people out there with this whole thing, how this is panned out there with Payday. Yeah, and the community doesn't seem to enjoy it too much based on what I've seen. Well, if you don't like it, don't buy the game, that'll send a message. Do you think that'll actually happen or people just won't be able to resist? I think people can probably resist opening those. For $2.50 for just a random cosmetic item, I think that would be, that's not kind of worth it. Yeah, but if the game doesn't sell well, that'll really tell them. I mean, 8,000 copies of your game sold is going to send a message. But I think that Payday sold more than 8,000 copies. I'm just saying. They re-released it so many times I think it's doing just fine. Alright. Well, we've been talking a lot about remakes tonight, reimaginings, and this is interesting. This is a story that's been floating around where Mega Man 3 is being remade by a fan in the Unreal Engine 4. And I'm totally going to mispronounce this name, so I apologize. But, Andr\u00e9 de Jaeger, I hope I said that right. But he's been working on this, just toying around in Unreal excuse me, remaking Mega Man 3. And I gotta say, it looks great when you look. He's just got a little clip of the Gemini Man stage in this. I don't know where the music comes from. I don't know if he remade the music or if he's like using an overclocked mix or something. There's so many Mega Man fan mixes out there you can only imagine. But let me show, just to the folks in studio here, if I can if I can if it'll work. You can kind of see what that looks like there. Looks great, huh? The background leaves a little bit to be desired, but yeah, the rest of it looks great. Yeah, and then you get into the segments like where it's all the colored blocks, like that looks really good, huh? Yeah, it is. So, I just, you know, again, I think there's a lot of people that would really like something like that. So, alright. I played it again. Anyway, I don't know. Here's the thing when it comes to remakes, especially like this. A lot of people that do like speed runs and things that perfect the game, kind of expect the game to run in certain ways. And when you remake a game like this, I'm not sure everything's gonna be down to the nanosecond, if that makes sense. And that can really bother some people, but I think if you're okay with that, I think this looks great. Like, you know, this is, this looks even better than Mighty No. 9, to be honest. And it's just one guy! Just blows my mind how Capcom doesn't want to do anything like that. So. bonds006 in chat says, Jamie does not sound impressed. That's alright. Well, they did that sort of with Mega Man powered up M, I think that's what it was called, or Mega Man powered up, that was on PSP. Oh yeah, that looked really good, yeah. I mean, they did it in a weird art style where it's like giant head Mega Man, you know, but it was kind of like that. And how level editor was kind of cool. No love for that though, I mean, I don't understand why they'll do that for console. You know, somebody posted in my Facebook, I don't remember if it was Rama or Joe or somebody, but somebody posted my Facebook that somebody remade like Mega Man 1 within Mario Maker. And they, now obviously it doesn't look exactly like Mega Man, but it's like a lot of the same elements they kind of put in Mario Maker, and I was really impressed, I gotta say. They did this whole YouTube where they used some remixed Mega Man themes kind of in the background to give it a little flair, and obviously they used the Mega Man amiibo as well. What? They didn't even make like the music, you know, with, you know, the the note blocks. That would have been a little complicated to do all of that. Nah, just kidding. I just thought that was really cool as well. There's so much fan love for Mega Man out there. It's just like, Capcom, make a new one. You never will, but alright. Anyhow, Dark Saga. Well, you know, we've talked about many different studios in the past and about them going to certain locations. This one is actually pretty cool because it kind of affects my old stomping grounds. And Exile is opening a new studio in New Orleans. They're the group that gave us Bard's Tale 4, for example. But they are going to be opening up the studio. They're supposed to create about 50 new jobs over the next five years. So, they're basically going to be setting up there, trying to also have a long-term goal of creating 110 new jobs in Louisiana itself. And, I just think it's good that they're looking to invest in the area, especially given that parts of the state are still recovering. I mean, Katrina was a while back. Sure. But not everything is recovered. That's going to take a generation to recover from. Yeah. So, I think this is great. I think this is really good, and that means that, you know, folks that I know in the area, that's less distance that have to move to find work in the industry. Yeah. Good deal. It's always nice to hear about jobs being made as opposed to layoffs. So, Loki, what do you have for us? Well, I have layoffs for you. God damn it, Loki. No, but anyways, Rovio, they've laid off 213 people. God damn it, Loki. Sorry. But it's fewer than what was originally announced, because they announced 260, and that was back in August. But they're restructuring the company to focus on key areas like games media and consumer products. And of course, you know, they have the Angry Birds movie coming out in May. So, yeah. The first round, I guess, you know, they laid off 110 employees back in December, and now this 213 is going to be I think a reduction of about 36% originally from their numbers that they were working with. That sucks, but, you know. It does, but how often have we seen this in the smartphone day and age where, you know, this company has their one breakthrough game, and then all of a sudden it's like they're bloated beyond control and then, oh, surprise, the future releases didn't catch on in the same way, so we have to lay everybody off. I mean, this has happened like time and time again, right? Yeah. Is Zynga even still around at this point? Yeah, they are. Are they? What are they making these days? Is there Farmville 3? I don't know. I don't know. But then, you know, Rovio has Angry Birds and I don't know. What else did they do? Yep. And then there was the OMG Pop or whatever, the drawing game on the phone that was huge, and then Zynga bottom, and then nobody wanted to play it anymore. It's Candy Crush. And all the others. What else have they done? Soda Crush. Oh, Candy Crush 2, Electric Boogaloo. What else? Yeah, and like other Crush games. Like, I have a coworker that plays that kind of stuff, and I'm like, what are you playing? And she's, I don't even know, it's like some game. And it's basically Candy Crush, but it just kind of proves, like, it's not Candy Crush, it was just one of the other millions of those games out there. Like, the market's so saturated with like, oh, hey, Candy Crush worked out really well, let's make a bunch of those. I start playing Brandy Lush. I just drink a lot. I'm playing like, you know, it's like Jewel Crush 2, or, I don't know. It's... ActDeft in chat says crush all the things. Oh, be careful, I believe that word is trademarked. Patent pending. Copyright. Anyhow. Hey, some fun news out of the indie scene. Apparently, Goat Simulator and I Am Bread are combining forces for some crossover DLC. And there's actually a trailer that shows, through the power of love, a goat and bread going on a date together to... Goat Simulator will be getting a playable piece of bread, and I Am Bread is gonna get a mode called Rampage. So these two games have literally gotten in bed together for DLC, but this is great. I don't like I Am Bread, but I Am Bread is so frustrating and hard that I don't like that game anymore. I am frustrated. I kinda wish... I'm glad Goat Simulator is getting more DLC. Please bring it to the console, because I can't purchase it on console. It doesn't run well on my PC, and that's my big problem. I would love to purchase your game. I like all the DLC and stuff. I can't, though, because you don't offer it. I have money in my hand. Gonna give it to you, but you're not letting me. And some bread. I have more bread, if that's what you want. You're not letting me. So, yeah. There you go. So, uh, congrats to those guys. That looks like it'll be fun. Alright, let's go to our mailbag! Every week, Dark Soccer dives into our mailbag, and if you want to email us, participate at Orangelauntrader.com is how you can participate with the show. We had some good emails last week, um, so hopefully, this week can live up to it. We have two emails tonight, right, Dark Soccer? Alright, let's get to it! Hello, LR. Please forgive me if I'm about to sound like a high and mighty bragging douche butt. But you are! I mean, let's, let's be, sorry, I don't even know who this is yet, or what it is, but anytime you're gonna say, sorry if I'm gonna do this butt, you're, I'm gonna do it. You are gonna be that. You are gonna do it. But it's okay! I like how this field says, I don't mean to sound racist, but yeah, you're racist. And, I, you know what, I'll, I have definitely been a whiny douche on this show, have we all, so, have your moment, emailer, have your moment. You know what, though, I think that the word douche is the best insult ever. Yeah? You know why? Why? Because, first of all, if you look at an actual douche... I'd rather not. Number one... Especially as a gay man, it's really not something I just, I have zero interest in it whatsoever. Number one... What? It's unnecessary. And number two, it actually can cause harm. That's the best insult ever. Now I'll continue. I think I heard, I actually think I owe Becky rent on that one, because she mentioned that to me once. I see. Pretty good. I don't, okay, I just don't understand why people make such a big deal about beating Contra on the default three lives. It's really, really not that difficult. Compared to those NES games that are actually hard, like Ninja Gaiden or Battletoads or many others, I would say that anyone with at least some gaming skill could do it if they actually try. Personally, I can do it every time without continues. Why aren't you special? Hearts, YYR, hearts. Oh, it's YYR? Yes. Sound the hipster alarm. Better grow that beard and put on some lumberjack clothes. That's right. I got some flannel for you. I've got some horn-rimmed glasses somewhere. Let's watch some Portlandia and listen to some indie bands. Listen to some vinyl. All you need are decent timing and reflexes, a bit of memorization, some knowledge of how the game works, for example, keeping in mind that random enemies can pop out along the ground at any time, and to get comfortable. People, stop messaging me while I'm reading the email. Seriously. Shut it off. No, it's the chat. The thing pops every time I get a message and it's freaking distracting. You need to turn that off. I can't, not with what I have. Where was I? Okay. A hipster douche vinyl. And to get comfortable with the game's weapons. Knowing where the best weapons are helps with quite a bit, but if you're decent at mashing the B button, you can get comfortable with the default weapon as well. And that can help even more. The game gives you a generous number of extra lives, and if you count those, you actually have closer to 10 by the end. And most of all, playing by yourself helps a lot too. You play with yourself and that helps. Do you play with yourself a lot, YPR? You might have thought otherwise, but not having to worry about keeping the same pace as your partner is a huge load off your shoulders. Imagine playing with yourself as a huge load. Jamie! I can't help it. I'm in that mood tonight. It's not as much as you would think. With at least another partner, you normally get a huge load button. A little extra advice will... the whole point is to take off a huge load. He needs to get the huge load off. Please finish this damn email. That's kind of not really how it works, but okay. A little extra advice to... Am I in the Horde house? What happened? Josh! A little extra advice to anyone who wants to try. The R powerup is not a weapon. It makes the shots fired by your current weapon move faster. Every weapon has a maximum number of shots allowed on the screen at a time so the faster they're gone, the sooner you can fire more. The S plus R combination is in almost every way the best weapon in the game. In Stages 2 and 4, don't forget that ducking makes you invincible against bullets and jumping is almost always a bad idea. Also in those levels, the round targets are mandatory, but all others are optional. Against the Stage 4 boss, any homing bubbles that appear would be your first priority, and the snowfield will move forward slowly and be ready to jump over the sudden turrets. And I think if you're playing single player if you push up on Player 2 controller, you can hit the targets in the middle even if you're ducking if I remember correctly. When moving through Stage 8, stop moving forward as soon as you encounter the next mouth unless doing so is impossible. Destroying them when at a time will prevent you from being overwhelmed. When fighting the head or the heart, the distance between you and the target is so short that your shots disappear almost instantly, so the faster you can mash the buttons, the faster you can consider yourself a hero. Against the heart, make sure to take out the two pods on the floor first. Makes things much easier. I would encourage anyone to try Contra on 3 lives even if you never played it back then. Try it with 30 lives first just to get the hang of it, then give it a shot. You're capable of more than you think. Then try the even more challenging sequel, Keep the Trigger Pulled Aaron YYR. That Battle Toads is way harder than even you know, that Battle Toads was definitely controller breaking rage fury type of stuff and there was no 30 lives code in that game so you were just fucked if you couldn't get the pattern down. Ninja Gaiden was really, I own Ninja Gaiden and I don't think I ever beat it. I could only get like to like the next to last stage I think was as far as I could get. It was, it was brutal. Yes. So last email? Yep. This comes from Rissimo. Hi there. I just wanted to say thanks to all three of you for giving me such great ear candy over the years. I found OLR by reading Joystick Mini Moons ago. It was the infamous Katamari tobacco. Oh, I don't know what you're talking about. What Katamari tobacco? I have heard every single episode since then. I never get to listen live so I used to download the episodes from Loki's PSP portal and followed you to Justin TV and now I stream Epps from Stitcher. I've gotten many friends to listen since then and they love you just as well. Thanks again for your dedication and I hope you continue to bless us with your banter for many more years. Aww, thank you. That's, no question or anything. That's it? Just a I just called to say I love you? I just called to say I love OLR. Aww, I'm feeling warm and fuzzy now. That's great. Thank you. It was like a little e-hug. I appreciate that. You feel all squishy. And then I'm thinking in my mind how long ago was that Katamari thing? Wasn't that like 2007 when that happened? Or 2008? I don't even remember. It was a long time ago. It was ages ago. Joystick's been closed for a while now so not that long I guess in retrospect. Let's take a look, shall we? So I think, I want to say it was like 2008? I could be wrong. It was sometime long ago in a galaxy far, far away. Still, that would have been just like that's still like seven years ago. That person's been listening for seven years. Supposedly every week. I'm sorry. Wow, I know that. I feel like there's a long list of things I should apologize for you. March 16, 2007. 2007! Thank you, Wikipedia. We're actually a part of a beautiful Katamari Wikipedia page. Are we really? We are. Oh my god. Why? We don't even have our own Wikipedia article anymore. Yep, we're under PlayStation 3 and Wii development. A March 16, 2007 post at Orange Launch Radio reported that Namco Bandai announced beautiful Katamari to retailers. Well, I was like, Namco Bandai didn't announce it. That was, but okay. But they did, that's how we had discovered it was through the retail channels. Yes, that is correct. So there was a PlayStation 3 version, okay. But we don't, for some reason, we don't have our own Wikipedia article anymore. Because some douche figured that we didn't need one. Even though we won, and you know, whatever, I'm just saying, I'm just saying, we won the very first podcast award. We are the longest running video game podcast that exists, period. If there was another one, we would know of it by now. There's others that have been running a very long time, ten plus years, and many kudos to them, but we are the longest, for what it's worth. Let's see, what else? What else makes this notable? I guess that's it. Me. You. Me. We're also part of the guitar hero encore rock the 80s. What? Wikipedia page. How? Did we break the news on that or something? I don't even remember. That was a long time ago. We do have a link as well on Takeo Mitsumiro, Muratsu. Is that the dude who is OrangeLounge? Under his, like, name, maybe? I don't know. I'm just going in, something about Jumping Flash 2. Let's take a look here. That's cool if we're cited in Jumping Flash 2, I guess. How does that work? Jumping Flash 2 is a great game. They linked to Tetsuya, posted something, I guess. Huh. It's an article on our, or it was an article. It's not linked there anymore for some reason. Wow. Oh, yeah. As 200 Matt says, the VOG Network was also mentioned in the Disney Infinity Wiki at one point. That's right, because the E3 thing got the price point for those figures. There's a post of us on Dailymotion doing what? It was actually going back to when we were on the news about podcasting. Oh, God. Was that the one where, was that the clip with Loki? Oh, it's so much fun. KCRA, yeah. Oh, yeah. With an old-ass iPod. Yes. That was before iPhones, wasn't it? That clip was before the iPhone, if I'm not mistaken. Yup. I think you guys, I think we should do that clip. How long has it been since we played this clip? No. Yes, I think the whole conversation with them, that's what they picked. No, we're right after a shooting. It's 9 years old. This story is 9 years old from July of 2005. No, this is, oh my God, it's over 10 years old at this point. The governor is one of the many people joining the podcasting craze. It's becoming a web craze. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Brian Hickey tonight shows us how people are using podcasting to inform, entertain, and share their thoughts with the world. Apparently your thought is only 10 seconds known. It's called Dance Dance Revolution, or DDR, a popular game that has a fanatic following. It started off tiny and it's grown. Oh my gosh. I hate hearing myself. That's phrasing. That's you talking about the prior email. Phrasing. Check out also the gigantic HDTV I used to have. This is the place I lived with the extra for a moment. Hello everybody once again. Welcome to another episode of our podcast. From their apartment in Rancho Cordova using Revolution... We didn't all live together. Just from their apartment. We didn't all live together. Can you imagine if all three of us, I mean I guess Loki and I lived together for a while. We made it work. Where would I put Dan? And look how young we all are. I'm like oh my god I had so much hair. Girl. Oh my god that was the old We basically give the news for video games popular culture. Basically what gamers really want to know. Oh my god. The developers record their programs then send them to a number of websites now hosting the shows. Now anyone can create, edit and air their ideas, concerns, music and all things audio to anyone else willing to download it. It's a much more flexible way of spreading the information. With nothing more than an MP3 player and a set of headphones you can listen to it anywhere. Now people can talk about things they like to talk about other people can join in and listen to and it's really open and lots of people can get into it. I love how they just interviewed some dude with an iPod and it was like iPod owner. That was actually the little thing that said it was an iPod owner. A number of websites are now hosting the podcast for free. The newest and biggest database to adopt the technology is Apple's iTunes. You just click on the podcast tab, type a topic in the search feature and a list of available podcasts are at your fingertips. Free for you, free for the producers, free speech for everyone. It's so much fun. It's great that you know just anybody out there who really has a desire to want to be heard you have an outlet for your voice to get out there so podcasting is just wonderful. Ian Rancho Cordova, Brian Hickey KCRA 3 reports. Yeah fuck that. Recently Governor Schwarzenegger began providing his weekly radio. Yes everybody reminder, he really was the governor. That actually happened. He really was the governor of California. The goobernator. As a podcast it can be downloaded so you can listen to it in your car as you walk or even as you're pumping iron in the gym. Oh news. Oops I almost started it over again. Sorry about that. There we go. That's a clip from my KCRA bootleg there from our YouTube channel. By the way I also want to point out in that story did you notice even though they had all of us sort of in that interview they never said the name of the show. They never said it was called Orange Lawns Radio ever in that entire clip. They show a picture of it when he's talking about oh iTunes has it they show a picture of him subscribing to it in iTunes with the really old art like even the one before the one you did I mean it was really old. We were in the four corners I was in one corner the chakra was in one corner Loki was in one corner and then the fourth corner was the ferret. And SSA 100 Matt says Loki's field gypped from his five minutes of fame. No that's not the only time I've been on the news. We also did a guitar hero thing. I wasn't on that. I gave an honest opinion about like on a scale of 1 to 10 how do you rate them. It's about like an 8 or 9 and then Miss Miss One Up here has to go it's an 11. Fuck that shit. Say thanks. I was looking. It's a million. It's a million. I was looking just looking for orange on radio and wiki and found my page on the Wikipedia and I don't ever remember saying this but it does sound like something I'd say. I'm controlling the apocalypse. You're all fucked. Wait but that wasn't on Wikipedia that's the orange on radio. On our wiki. Yeah so I haven't read my page. That's a separate thing that the which honestly I don't even know how to edit it. I think maybe I changed one thing on there one time but that's been like a group of like three or four people that still still keep that like classic game list up to date and I think the list list gets updated every time we do that game. Oh my god it's my old MySpace page. I didn't even think this existed anymore. Wait you still have a MySpace page? Apparently I do. There is a link to your MySpace on the Wikipedia. Oh my god. What song is auto playing in the background? Oh my god. Dark Saga is horrified. I would like to read my quotes from the page. Oh yes what's that? It says um I can't for the life of me get the hooker to have sex with me. I remember that. That was you talking about like Grand Theft Auto or something. Of course it's so much fun. Ow my foot why'd I shoot myself in the foot oh my god it hurt so bad. Yes that was you being you were a game company talking about something. I don't remember what I was talking about. Bomb Burger. Wait hold on because I actually I actually have this clip. God damn. Ow my foot. Why did I shoot myself in my foot? Oh my god it hurt so bad. Oh my god my No I need that for walking. Wait and I have this other one it says Loki on babies. I'm a little worried. What this could be. Somebody once told me what having a baby felt like. Giving birth sucks and I'm never going to do it. It's why they cut open your stomach and pull the damn kid out. It's just like what the hell is the point? It's like trying to shove a piano through a door when there's a perfectly good window right there. I mean I don't see the point. And that's why men will never have babies. The genius of Loki on Orange Lums Radio. I don't even remember what the hell that was in regards to. And then we were talking about the Mega Man 2 jingle thing that they had like an app where you can whenever you click an icon do the Mega Man 2 jingle and it's like hamburger and then mailman. In the early days of apps or anything gaming related. That's kind of a lame list. I've said more interesting things since then. For the record I would like to point out that I have birthed no children. Just saying. Alright. I don't even know how we got on that tangent. Oh it was the love letter. Just sent us down memory lane so thank you for that. You even get to hear clips from before you were even listening probably recently so there you go. Alright. Thank you for your emails. Participate at OrangeLumsRadio.com is the place where you can send us emails as well. Let's now take this opportunity to get into the FUs of the week. FU to medical issues. That's it. I'll leave it there. There's so many things I don't even remember on this thing like bucket rolled. Anyways. I guess FU to just being really tired and not having a chance to work on my costume because I'm worried that I'm gonna run out of time very fast. So I need to start tonight. I gotta cut something tonight. For the costume. My FU of the week goes to those delicious pumpkin cinnamon rolls that Jamie brought to the show tonight because they were so Trader Joe's. They were so freaking good but now I just feel so fat after having eaten two of them. I'm having eater's remorse. Oh well. There it is. The FUs of the week. Yep. In fact they already have episode six nineteen classic game of the week already in there so. They're good. What can I say? They're fast. They are fast. Alright. Let's get to it. Don't you have to put a spoiler alert on it though because the podcast doesn't no I'm just kidding. Oh I didn't say what it was. I just said it was there. I'm just. No I'm on the wiki. It's fine. Alright. Just a couple more stories for you guys then the phone calls one eight seven seven game OLR or username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio. All one word. Let's do these last couple stories. Loki. So someone decided to make a Zelda maker on PC. Of course this is not officially endorsed by Nintendo. It is kind of cool to check out. They do have an alpha release you can download and make some levels for. I I don't know. It looked interesting and I kind of watched the video of it. I think this is going to get taken down before you know it. Yeah now that it's on all these new sites Nintendo's lawyers will be at work Monday morning which I hate to say but it's true. You guys all know it's true. Yeah so if you check it out looking to see where the download is for that basically if you look for user dream mix on YouTube there's a link of one of the videos they have legends all that maker Alpha zero point zero one release and you can go download it so it looks interesting. Yeah it looks it's again it's very interesting what a small little independent group can accomplish. So strange to me how they can do that. But anyway I mean sorry it's it's not strange to me they can do it but it's strange how it's this small little team can do it yet you know when it comes to a big company they're they're pressed for resources and so forth it's just I don't know it just blows my mind sometimes. Anyhow lastly before we get to the Skype line this is the story I'm sure you've all been waiting for in fact actually is more when I heard it was one of those things where gosh this didn't already happen Hideo Kojima has officially parted ways with Konami in fact it happened on October 9th and due to a clause apparently in the parting arrangement there he's not allowed to work again until December there was allegedly some type of cheerful but emotional goodbye departure ceremony that about 100 people went to and Hideo Kojima did not comment on this because of a legally binding agreement with the former employer but this is where things got really fucking weird because Kojima can't comment but Konami did after the New Yorker ran that piece about Hideo Kojima and Konami decided to reply on Tokyo Sports which got translated saying that Kojima is still an employee of Konami he's just on vacation currently Kojima is listed as a company employee at Konami currently Kojima and the development team are finished developing Metal Gear Solid 5 and taking a long time off from work because the development time for console games is so long and fatigue builds up it's common for employees to take extended periods of time off when development is finished so would that vacation be up in say I don't know December? We'll see Tigerclaw in chat says maybe something got lost in the translation you know here's the thing Konami's PR stuff is in the goddamn toilet right now and if this hadn't happened after what has been an actual comedy of errors one after another coming out of Konami then I would probably go okay there is probably some type of miscommunication going on and you know something weird is going on but after everything that's come out of Konami over the past year between the PT debacle and the removal and the fact that nothing's coming out except for mobile and pachinko and all this stuff it's like okay Konami needs like they need more than PR they need CPR at this point they need a lot of help getting their image back up and I don't even know if it's recoverable at this point and so yeah when I hear that Kojima's left Konami I kind of tend to believe it because there's that big part of me that's like that didn't already happen SSG-100 Matt says how stupid do they think we are just stop Konami Akdev says we're still together guys we're definitely not lying and Dark Tetsuya says Konami go home you're drunk I think that's the most succinct way to put it it's kind of it's it's not kind of sad it's very sad but it is what it is sounds like one too many egos kind of drove that company into the ground and it will never be the company that brought us double dribble anymore anyhow on that note I should probably open up the Skype line I didn't even have Skype open yet like I actually don't even have the application open since Bobby was not on tonight we didn't do the call before OLR so I don't even have the application open I'm trying to launch it right now but it's taking it forever so I'm going to ask Loki if he has any last minute stories while I try to get Skype up and running my wife wants me to build a catio for my cat I think you should do it I want one for Midna well like here's the thing it's like yeah it's basically like an outdoor space she already has the garage I already put a fucking door in our garage door so she can go out in the garage and she's been hanging out in there now she wants to go outside I mean I could do that but like I'm going to be spending money to build this thing that's a fucking monstrosity for this cat and the cat won't appreciate it I mean you just kind of know in the back of your head the cat would never use it no the cat would use it she'd love she loves outdoors in fact but she's just scared like the other day like we had a Comcast over and I told him like it's cool oh no not Comcast it was the air conditioning guy he was over to kind of check the system for the you know the heater and everything and I told him like yeah it's cool you can go out the back but just make sure you close the door because the cat you know will get out oh she's scared of outside but just make sure you close it because I don't want the door open so he leaves and leaves the fucking door open when he leaves and so I come out there to go close the door and I was seeing the cat walking around alright let's get to the phones I finally have skype open over at 1877 game olr or use the name on skype orange launch radio but we have a call coming in so let's get to it hi you're on orange launch radio who's this chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga chugga oh my god Jim Sally train pulling into the station this is oh my god twice in a month I feel unworthy I'm talking to you on this old ipod that I found in a car I have a sleeping out back that I use for shooting practice it was in the glove box man did you get interviewed by a news station as an ipod owner what yeah man listen everybody if you like technology but don't feel like you're smart enough to use it get an ipod it's great everything like whatever options you're supposed to have it just shows up in two or three really big buttons in front of you you can't fuck it up you know you can't do all the cool things that you want to do on like a real phone and it's kind of pricey but who kills this shit man I want a tweet I want one button tweet I know some people that really liked those ipods that were like the iphone without the phone because that way there were a lot of people I knew that would have like the android phone but then they the ipod touch that's it the ipod touch that's what this is that I'm talking to you on it's an ipod touch from five years ago I think you can skype on it yeah oh yeah I mean the ipod touch the last one they did was equivalent to what a 4 an iphone 4 or something I think yeah so I that's you know skype is certainly on there it's nice I like it well you looked sharp Jim Sally what's on your mind tonight dude I'm still rocking the 3gs how sick is that oh my god well do they have LTE in Canada you live kind of don't you live in ice trucker territory pretty much man oh my gosh I gotta fuck you for the week this week too fuck you fuck you to guns man I just took my fucking super gun course so I could get super guns and there were people in that fucking course and dude it's super guns man like you guys are from America so you don't own guns you know I don't own a gun shit like the big game guns you know I'm talking your big bolt action Winchester's and shit yeah I did not know there was such a thing as a super gun but I'm just gonna assume I thought super guns were for playing video games that's a really big gun and then you can get a gun I saw women in this class man that there's no way they can hold a gun and shoot it and they get to go buy them now well now now now aim knows no gender no physics don't know no gender either man fucking gravity works the same everyday all the time the same no days off man Dungeon Buster in chat says super gun is that the one Saddam had you know those weapons of mass destruction I don't know I somehow don't think Canada would have them if that were the case actually if you want to have some historical facts for you that in the 1980s when Iraq was still considered an ally of the United States there was a Canadian man a Canadian man doctor fuck I don't know Fongoli whatever but he was Canadian and he was building the fucking super gun in Iraq it was just a big rifle big fucking bullets essentially they said they took the Canadian the genius of the Canadian and they gave him the unlimited wealth of the American Federal Trade Bank thingy whatever it's called and then the fucking this is really racist but it's true the Israelis didn't like it so they killed them we never got to see the fucking super Canadian gun all we get all we get is the fucking gay little jerk off arm in space that jerks off the space shuttle watch it watch it you don't have to make a space shuttle just fucking jerk it off now hold on hold on because this is the thing is that you guys in Canada know how to build big guns so is all your politeness and all that it's hiding something isn't it I knew it all this time he's showing off his muscles there all right Jim Sally what did you want to call in to talk about tonight I know you didn't call in to talk about super guns PS congrats on the new PM isn't he dreamy I know you guys got Obama for your dreamy guy he's okay but look at our fucking dreamy guy did you see his pretty face he's oh my goodness I was like I could move yeah well vote for me and I'll do things you know there's a whole lot of people that are lining up to move to Canada Donald Trump somehow actually gets elected so I'm just oh I want Donald Trump to get elected he needs if there's anything right now that's going to save you if Donald Trump gets elected it's our Justin Trudeau I think you could be in power for the next 20 years all right anyway what did you call you did not call in to talk about guns or politics what you want to talk about tonight I don't even know anymore man have you been playing video games at all dude yeah I was just playing check it out man I was just playing some Grand Theft Auto I'm like oh that's cool you can't really see it on the screen over here and I was actually calling to ask if there's any players out there that would like to play Grand Theft Auto with me on the Xbox 360 my name is Jim Salley also at Xbox is there a way for people to just give me money in Grand Theft Auto 5 Loki can you give Jim Salley money I think there's maybe a way to do that most likely you would have to just like I don't know it'd be an agreement with somebody to like put a bounty on them well actually no that wouldn't work either cause you lose half the money then right yeah I don't know if there's a way to give money you normally can't like you can throw bets maybe you can throw bets for you know like different races or something like that just bet a bunch of money and then have someone win I mean that's one way to do it I think there's a way to also like after missions you are able to split up the taking from that and you're supposed to be able to give extra money but I think they cut out a lot of that too because people are using that to when they're modding the game they would cheat that way and you know give millions of dollars I don't know I don't remember if I have much money in the Xbox 360 version anymore there's gotta be someone out there that can help me out and listen Jim Sally needs your help everybody you need to help him out if you know the answer shout it out and chat I mean Rockstar's answer is gonna be just buy the fucking shark cards but yeah exactly that's how I feel as well so now I'm gonna get onto the phone just do missions they're boring as shit but do those or do the gang stuff I don't know it's been a while since I played that alright I thought you played the Grand Theft Auto everyday guy weren't you the Grand Theft Auto officer? I haven't played it in like almost a year hey you guys wanna know what though I did such a good job you wanna hear this this is what I really wanted to show you I did such a good job on my gun course I may be the first Canadian ever outside of the military to get perfect scores on every single gun exam all the way through to all the different levels and stuff they put me on the cover of the hunting manual for the entire province wanna see it? yeah I got it right here hold on a second even though this is radio I will do my best to describe it to everybody so we're gonna get to see a there all I see is orange you are covered in orange and he's pointing at the ground going hey why am I pointing at the cover? yeah my gun is pointed at the heavens but I see a bear you point your gun to Jesus so you don't shoot nobody but for my students point that gun to Jesus see so I say point the gun to Jesus and look I say look see look some kid threw a roach here they're having a good party it's a moose Jim Sally I gotta let you go so we can get some more calls and wrap up but thank you as always for the call it's great where'd he go? I miss you guys I'll see you later I miss you too call us again it's not the same without you we'll be here next week Jim Sally I promise so what level of the course do you get to hunt John Leguizamo? stop it we're done that's the final course bye Jim Sally thanks for the call always a pleasure to hear from Jim Sally here at Orange Lounge radio playing some Grand Theft Auto he did have it running on the TV he might have been doing that multitasking thing I need to go back and play it's been a while but you know Jim Sally needs a friend do it for Jim Sally do it I can go back and play it on 360 I think I still have it on 360 I have to double check I don't think I sold it 1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio all one word if you want to give us a call Skype line is open if you didn't figure it out from that last call Loki while we wait is there any other last minute stories you want to get out here? uhhhh nope I don't have anything alrighty then well then this is the last call for calls over at 1877 Game OLR username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio if no one else is going to call then I guess we're going to be wrapping things up here I was looking at some comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com chat room always lights up during a uhhh we had that Twitter poll that kind of ended up getting on my Twitter traffic but I'll look here real quick actdeft is mentioning in chat them's fightin' herds got funded that was the game he called in to talk about last week but they had hit their funding point at that point but they were in that last push to hit some stretch goals and I think they got a couple of them after all so congrats ummm let's see I was looking at some tweets over at twitter.com slash OLR um at James Nighthawk was thanking Dark Soccer for reading the email on OLR last week glad to hear you're a fellow fan of good grammar in emails too not only is she a fan, she demands it it's an expectation, it has to happen that's right YYR at the end of the show last week was letting us know about a massive Dragon Age sale on Xbox I mean obviously this is over by now but I'll just mention Inquisition was 20 bucks Dragon Age 2 5, Origins 3 74 don't know if I love it where should I start? where should somebody start with the Dragon Age series if they want to get into it I think they should just go to Inquisition at this point myself you can start Inquisition without knowing much in the background but you would probably have it start off with whatever the default official canon is however if you really do want the story beginning to end you have to go Origins, DA2 I mean Awakenings is a good one I actually I'd say in order of my favorite games I would go Inquisition, DA2 Origins, and then Awakening I'm actually one of those people who is not the biggest fan of the first Dragon Age except for Alistair but there was a lot of people that didn't like Dragon Age 2 I love Dragon Age 2, I freaking think it's fun fair enough I would say just having been in similar shoes you're totally ok starting Inquisition without having necessarily played everything else, so it's fine and in fact I think the battle system is a lot more accessible I think playing the old games to get through the story can be a bit of a slog it is a good story if you can tolerate it but it's kind of like Mass Effect the best Mass Effect game is I say it's tied between 2 and 3 but 2 really is the peak of the series, but I think 3 is much better than a lot of people give it credit for because I love the multiplayer in 3 and all that and so it's like, yeah you gotta play Mass Effect but you do kinda have to push through Mass Effect 1 because the story is still really good even if the Mako scenes will drive you up a fucking wall but it's still worth playing alright let's see, DungeonBuster in chat says not a fan of Dragon Age 2 myself, but lore wise it's useful, it was fun playing a smart ass mage in that one so apparently there's a rumor that Final Fantasy DS will be coming to arcades next month oh yeah, I'd heard that, yeah good, more stuff in arcades to play except that'll probably just be Japan, not here, right? yeah, probably I would like to see it come to consoles someday hopefully get on it, get on that remake a game you just put out for consoles alright, that's gonna do it the phones aren't lighting up and it's about 9 o'clock here on the west coast, I think we're gonna go ahead and wrap up for the night, but I do want to thank you guys for tuning in to Orange Laundry Radio remember as we say every week, if you enjoyed the show please tell a friend, or 5 or 15, about Orange Laundry Radio, we are the show where every gamer has a voice, but a lot of people out there we're not notable enough to be on Wikipedia so we have to really rely on your voices and word of mouth to help us get out there and we really appreciate it, so that goes a long way leave us a fake 5 star review on Amazon leave us a real one on iTunes or Stitcher Radio or wherever it is that you found this program all that stuff goes a very long way time to go around and get everybody's final thought I guess I'll start my final thought is I need a nap after how delicious those pumpkin rolls were so BRB nap except, ooh I want to play more Dragon Quest Heroes so maybe no nap Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight according to this quiz, I'm Princess Aurora from Sleeping Beauty and before we get to Loki's final thought I want to say AkumaJP says, Dissida is on handheld console though, that is true I'm talking about the arcade one, yeah I understand that that one is, we want the new shiny one on Playstation 4, alright, just making sure we clarify that there, anyway last but not least, Loki, your final thought my final thought is I need to work on my costume and also Ultimate Spiderman because Spiderman is one of the greatest cartoons that they have for Marvel Spiderman I mean, the writing is great it's just great great, that does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio thank you guys so much for listening tonight, appreciate it we will be back in 7 days to do it all over again have a great week everybody, and Happy Halloween you've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios to join us for a live show tune in to vognetwork.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific 9pm Eastern the views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true see you next week thanks for watching!", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 7.0, "text": " Orange Lounge Radio", "tokens": [50363, 11942, 36333, 8829, 50713], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.2001924822407384, "compression_ratio": 1.46, "no_speech_prob": 0.0020505953580141068}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 7.0, "end": 14.0, "text": " Who's your hosts?
