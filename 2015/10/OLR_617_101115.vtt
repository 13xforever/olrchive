Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:13.000
Who's the host? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:13.000 --> 00:22.000
Tonight October 11th, 2015, it looks like the marketplace of downloadable content may be evolving, from streaming content in Guitar Hero to insurance in Metal Gear Solid.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
We discuss these new directions with our participants next, live on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.000 --> 00:44.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio. Tonight with episode number 617 for this October the 11th of 2015.

00:44.000 --> 00:54.000
We are here assembled in Sacramento, California, Studio N7 to talk about the latest and greatest in gaming along with you guys in our chat room.

00:54.000 --> 01:05.000
My name is Rob Roberts, also known as Skie on Twitter, S-K-I-E, and joining me at my side as she often is, except for those times she's not, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:05.000 --> 01:08.000
Murgle, Murgle.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
What was that, the character in Bravely Default? Oh, I said Murg-er-gerger.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.000
I don't know, I was just thinking of the Murlocs and, wow.

01:17.000 --> 01:21.000
I've been going around just saying that randomly because it sounds funny.

01:21.000 --> 01:29.000
Yeah, it's great. So, before the show we were doing a little bit of snack time, which we usually do.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Oh my god.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
It's 6 o'clock on the west coast, right? It's a little bit snack time. It depends on if we decide to eat dinner before or after the show.

01:36.000 --> 01:43.000
Usually Loki is before DarkSakura, or during really, let's be real. DarkSakura and I are after, so we'll have a little snack to hold us over.

01:43.000 --> 01:48.000
And, because I was at Trader Joe's yesterday, not to give them a free plug, but I guess I did.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.000
They have pumpkin everything this time of year. Everything pumpkin this time of year.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
And so I had Jamie try, she didn't know what it was, and I said, here Jamie, eat this.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
And she's like, okay. And it was a pumpkin flavored tortilla chip.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.000
And the first, the reaction she made when she was eating it was very strange, and I showed her the bag, she's like, give it to me now.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
It took like a whole handful.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
It was really good.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
They are good, aren't they?

02:13.000 --> 02:20.000
Well, I wanted something, it's a little salty, and I like sweet and salty things. I mean, hence me eating up almost all of your kettle corn.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
But, it's so good.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Yeah.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.000
Yeah, actdef said sky is so white, he turns orange in October.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
It's true.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Yeah, Rob turns into Bob Barker.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
That is true.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.000
Acknowledging our chat room, we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of the Geeks Network, vognetwork.com.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
And yeah, actdef saying that I turn orange in October.

02:42.000 --> 02:49.000
You know, true story, my parents had to take me to the hospital when I was two years old because my face turned orange.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
How many carrots were you eating?

02:50.000 --> 02:54.000
And that's exactly what it was, it was because my favorite thing to eat when I was a kid was carrots.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.000
And of course, my parents are like, carrots aren't what, letting me eat carrots is better than sugar, right?

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Did you know that that happened to Susan Day?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Really?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
From the Partridge family?

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
I did not.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
Wasn't she the ginger? Is it a thing about being ginger and eating that? I don't know.

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
No, she had gone on like some anorexic kick.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Oh.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
And was eating nothing but carrots and turned orange.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Wow.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Yeah. How's that for your bit of trivia?

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
There you go. So maybe that ties into the pumpkin thing, I don't know.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Okay, I need to-

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
Alan says that you have pumpkin cranberry pita chips.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
I do have pumpkin-

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
And you need to give them to me now.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
Alright, well after-

03:29.000 --> 03:31.000
I want it now!

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
I'm gonna play the cruelest joke ever on Dark Soccer.

03:34.000 --> 03:39.000
They're in that cabinet on the very top shelf just out of reach for you.

03:40.000 --> 03:43.000
Dark Soccer. Oh, this is the one time I wish we had video.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Dark Soccer is getting on her tippy toes and-

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
Oh my god! What'd you break in there?

03:53.000 --> 03:58.000
Oh my god, I wish you guys could have seen that. She literally jumped to grab the bag of pumpkin-

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
Never underestimate the resourcefulness of a short person.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Alright.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Listen to this. I'm having the- Rob, I'm stealing your food.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
Thanks. Thank you, Alan. Love you. Mean it.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Alright. Look.

04:11.000 --> 04:16.000
Could you guys hear when, like, she just knocked the toaster pan over or something? I don't know. Anyway.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
Alright. Also, make sure you're not crinkling the bag near the mic, though.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
Okay. Also joining us tonight, of course, say hello-

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
And he's running in and out of here, too. I got people running around the house crazy.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Sorry.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
You have a ton of amiibo.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Yes.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
A ton of them I had to scan into Mario Maker, so I don't have to unlock the stupid costumes.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
So, yes. My amiibo collection has gotten disgusting. It has gotten absolu-

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
It's a little large.

04:40.000 --> 04:47.000
Now that they're easy to find, or easier, let's say much easier to find, and I mentioned this before,

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
Shane has that kind of unhealthy obsession right now with searching for toys.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
Like, he's helped me in getting all these different amiibo.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
So, yeah. Just today, I bought a Charizard and a Pikachu so I could have every Pokemon,

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
because I have Jigglypuff on order, shipping to a local target, and I'll have every Pokemon.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Well, I've got them all scanned now.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Did you? You scanned them all into Mario Maker?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
I scanned them all into Mario Maker.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
How many was that?

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
I don't even know. A lot.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
I went from, like, having almost- Well, I had quite a few. I finished, you know, playing the easy mode.

05:19.000 --> 05:24.000
They won't give me any more unlocks, so I have at least 30 there, and then I have to play normal mode now.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
But, yeah. That was at least 30 more, probably.

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
Nice. Yeah, I have a lot of amiibo. I'm a little embarrassed.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.000
And then, of course, I gotta fire up Splatoon to unlock the costumes and that, too.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
Oh, there you go.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.000
Wish they would do that with other characters. I mean, like a hat or a t-shirt or something, but no.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
It's just that game.

05:46.000 --> 05:51.000
All right. Let's see. We're gonna kick off with a kickoff topic tonight.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
I do wanna, again, welcome everybody to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
I'm just reading through some of the comments.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.000
Dark Tetsuya is saying, Rob should rent out his collection for people like me that need them for Mario Maker.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
Just bring your Wii U over. Do what Loki's doing.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
He doesn't even have the Wii U running, except on the gamepad, because you don't need to for Mario Maker.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
So he's just tapping them all on the gamepad. You're welcome.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
You know, I actually played more games this week.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
Did you? Well, get to gaming weeks very soon. I promise.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
I'm just very proud of myself.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
For playing a lot of games this week?

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
For playing other stuff.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
I played a lot as well this week.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Outside of the usual.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
You're really enjoying those pumpkin cranberry things, aren't you?

06:26.000 --> 06:29.000
I might have to leave and change.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
Bobby Blackwolf says, I'm gonna fly to Sacramento and put my Wii U and my carry on.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
You should, Bobby. You should.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
And I'll let you borrow the collection for free in celebration of your 500th episode.

06:43.000 --> 06:49.000
And that gives me an excuse to let our listeners know, if you weren't already aware of our pal Bobby Blackwolf,

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
who does the show before us here at VOG, he hit 500 episodes this evening.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
That is quite a milestone.

06:55.000 --> 07:00.000
And we've been on a neighboring time slot for, what, like 400 of those episodes?

07:00.000 --> 07:05.000
Easy. So, for a very long time we've been working with Bobby Blackwolf.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
And it just wouldn't be Sunday nights without him.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
So, congratulations on 500 episodes.

07:09.000 --> 07:14.000
And we'll see how far we're gonna take this block of programming.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.000
Anyhow, let's get to our kickoff topic tonight.

07:17.000 --> 07:21.000
So, shifting topics here. I want to talk about music games.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
I want to talk about Rock Band 4 came out this week.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
And usually I would get into this in my gaming week.

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
But I feel like this kind of necessitates a little bit of top of the show discussion.

07:31.000 --> 07:36.000
Because I'm gonna talk about Guitar Hero Live as well and some of the things they're doing with DLC.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
If you aren't already aware of it.

07:38.000 --> 07:44.000
So, this is the big year that music games that have been gone for a long time are making their comeback.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
And so, like many of you, I've picked up Rock Band 4.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
And I picked up Rock Band 4 on the Xbox One.

07:50.000 --> 07:57.000
And the reason why I chose Xbox One is because my disgusting amount of rock band songs were on the Xbox 360.

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
And Harmonix has been advertising that those songs are going to import over.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
They're gonna come over from the 360 to the One.

08:04.000 --> 08:10.000
Well, as to be expected with a lot of launch type situations.

08:10.000 --> 08:16.000
The Xbox One and Xbox 360 transfer situation is a little bit borked right now.

08:16.000 --> 08:21.000
Meaning that when I go into Rock Band 4 and look at the library of songs to purchase.

08:21.000 --> 08:26.000
There's some songs that I've purchased already that show available for free.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
But there's others that aren't recognized.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
And it can even, there seems to be no rhyme or reason.

08:32.000 --> 08:36.000
Like I was like, is it the oldest stuff I've bought? Or what is coming in and what's not?

08:36.000 --> 08:41.000
And like for example, I bought the Best of No Doubt album when it was available in Rock Band.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.000
And like half the songs will come in and half won't.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.000
And you guys have probably already heard that Rock Band 4 is having issues with...

08:50.000 --> 08:56.000
They do not yet have the export available for Rock Band, Rock Band 2 or Rock Band 3.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
Or I'm assuming Lego Rock Band will be a part of that at some point.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
Remember that was a thing that had its own soundtrack.

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
Yeah, I remember just getting that just to download the songs.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
These are all songs I was expecting to play on my Xbox One and I can't.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
So I have to admit, I'm a little bit disappointed.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
I assume that they're rushing to meet some type of deadline, which I get it.

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
The holidays are coming up, especially with the plastic instruments and everything.

09:21.000 --> 09:29.000
But I do feel like something big was promised to me that motivate my purchase on the Xbox One that hasn't been delivered.

09:29.000 --> 09:34.000
And I have to call Harmonics out on that. That's not really acceptable to me.

09:34.000 --> 09:39.000
And I really hope this situation gets fixed pretty quickly in the coming month or so.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.000
As for the game itself, Rock Band is a phenomenal game.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.000
Rock Band has always been one of the greatest music game franchises.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
And is the reason why we have a ton of plastic instruments in our house.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
I mean obviously Guitar Hero is a huge part of that too.

09:54.000 --> 09:59.000
But you guys all know Harmonics did Guitar Hero 1 and 2 and then they went on to make Rock Band.

10:00.000 --> 10:05.000
So in many ways, Rock Band is kind of the spiritual successor to the original Guitar Hero games, right?

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
So I was really excited about Rock Band 4 going into next gen.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
Because it's like, okay, this series has been gone for a few years.

10:16.000 --> 10:20.000
Let's see what's going to happen with this game.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
Yeah, we were like imagining, oh man, when they bring it back it's going to be something amazing.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
Yeah, with the new graphics and everything.

10:28.000 --> 10:35.000
So I have to admit, I'm kind of disappointed that Rock Band 4 is a step backwards for the series.

10:35.000 --> 10:41.000
Rock Band 4 is not a bad game, but it's not as good as Rock Band 3.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
It's about the same level as Rock Band 2.

10:44.000 --> 10:52.000
And you would expect that when a game is moving on to a new console like that, that you would not lose a lot of features.

10:52.000 --> 11:00.000
And this isn't just about the keyboard thing, although I truly have a hard time understanding why they couldn't put the keyboards in the game.

11:00.000 --> 11:10.000
I don't understand if they're having the whole compatibility switch thing and the note charts are already in for these songs you supposedly already own.

11:10.000 --> 11:17.000
I'm having a little bit of a hard time understanding that struggle, but I'm going to let the game have a pass on that,

11:17.000 --> 11:20.000
as disappointed as I am personally about the lack of keyboards.

11:20.000 --> 11:26.000
But I'm just talking about customization options blow compared to what was there in 3.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
You have very limited customization options.

11:28.000 --> 11:35.000
I think the harmony parts for singing are gone. I think it's just the singular stuff.

11:35.000 --> 11:39.000
It just feels scaled back.

11:39.000 --> 11:44.000
And I have to admit, then it makes me go, is this game kind of a cash-in?

11:45.000 --> 11:53.000
Was this to pay the light bills so that they can finish making Amplitude and some of these other pet projects that they have going on right now?

11:53.000 --> 12:02.000
I'm sorry to be so, I don't know, pointed or cynical gamer in what I'm saying, but this was my honest reaction when I started playing Rock Band 4.

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
I was like, this really doesn't feel like it was worth a five year wait.

12:06.000 --> 12:14.000
Now, if you've never owned a Rock Band game before, maybe you were 17 when the first series came out.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
Now you're in your early 20s and you have the disposable income for it.

12:18.000 --> 12:25.000
Rock Band 4 is a fine first purchase to get into the franchise. There's nothing super wrong with it.

12:25.000 --> 12:32.000
I'm just saying, Rock Band 3 is honestly a better game, with the exception of the fact that whatever these new songs are in 4,

12:32.000 --> 12:37.000
you wouldn't be able to pull into 3, but it's not that big of a loss all things considered.

12:37.000 --> 12:43.000
Bobby Black Wolf is saying that the harmonies are still there, so he doesn't want me to get corrected there.

12:43.000 --> 12:48.000
I made the same assumption but was proven wrong. I apologize, I didn't see that in the whole...

12:48.000 --> 12:57.000
And I think part of that, here's why I kind of made that assumption, is that I think I've been spoiled by Sing Star a little bit.

12:57.000 --> 13:05.000
Because I don't know if you guys know this, Sing Star ditched the microphones completely, and now you can actually do your singing through a cell phone app.

13:05.000 --> 13:17.000
Sing Star is a completely free thing now on PlayStation. You download the shell, you download the app to your phone, and you just pay for whatever songs you want to have.

13:17.000 --> 13:24.000
And I just kind of thought, after a five or six year wait, I kind of thought Rock Band would kind of get on that as well.

13:24.000 --> 13:28.000
Remember, they tried that with the PSP version. They had the free demo version that you could download.

13:28.000 --> 13:36.000
That's right. And that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about the cell phone microphone and the fact that you don't even need one anymore.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
And then that way, how easy would it be to have three people on their smartphones?

13:40.000 --> 13:50.000
I mean, just last week on the show, we had Jackbox on, and they've made this their thing, is creating these games that many people play with their smartphones.

13:50.000 --> 13:58.000
And that's kind of where things are going now, is that interaction. I was surprised that in that sense, the technology didn't take a step forward in Rock Band.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
So, I don't know.

14:00.000 --> 14:06.000
ActDeft in chat says, Sky, they should be available for free, even if they appear not bought.

14:06.000 --> 14:12.000
I tried selecting a few of them, and it still wanted me to purchase them. So, I don't, you know.

14:12.000 --> 14:24.000
And plus, the whole thing is a little clunky. Especially if being able to import your old songs was a selling point of the game, shouldn't there be a section of the store that's just view purchased items?

14:24.000 --> 14:31.000
Is that really hard? Why did we have to not have that in there? I don't understand.

14:31.000 --> 14:40.000
Again, I know I sound like I'm being really, really critical of Rock Band, but just as somebody who is expecting to be blown away, I wasn't.

14:40.000 --> 14:47.000
I was just like, oh, this is a very status quo game. In fact, it's actually a little bit of a step backwards from Rock Band 3.

14:47.000 --> 14:58.000
So, sorry, that's just kind of how I felt. But, you know, again, if you've never owned a Rock Band game, there's nothing wrong with starting with Rock Band 4, especially if you happen to have an Xbox One or PlayStation 4.

14:58.000 --> 15:08.000
But don't buy a console just for the game. Buy a console because there's many other great games to play as well, and Rock Band will be one of those games.

15:09.000 --> 15:17.000
Kaijuto in chat says, why sorry for how you feel? I don't know because sometimes I don't like to be that cynical gamer that's kind of hating on things.

15:17.000 --> 15:24.000
I want to make sure it's understood that when I'm critical, especially music games, I have a soft spot for music games.

15:24.000 --> 15:35.000
I think because this show started with DDR and the music-based games, maybe I feel some sort of loyalty to music games or what have you.

15:35.000 --> 15:44.000
So, you know, when I am critical of a game, I almost kind of feel bad because I want to see music games succeed and I want to see them be successful.

15:44.000 --> 15:50.000
So it's a little frustrating to me when Rock Band takes a step backwards because I go, this is going to kill the franchise.

15:50.000 --> 15:55.000
Surely I can't be the only one that's noticing this about the game. This is going to kill the franchise for good.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
And this is very disappointing because you want to see it do better. So I don't know.

15:59.000 --> 16:07.000
That's kind of why I apologize a little bit because I don't want to say negative things about it because I want the series to do well, but that's what it is.

16:07.000 --> 16:16.000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, same here about the music game loyalty. That's why whenever there's like a new 2DX on test, I make sure you guys all know about it.

16:16.000 --> 16:22.000
One other thing I want to talk about in our kickoff topic tonight was the DLC in Guitar Hero.

16:22.000 --> 16:27.000
I don't know if you guys have heard about this. Guitar Hero is doing something a little different with their DLC.

16:27.000 --> 16:35.000
Guitar Hero, you've heard about these streaming channels, right? That you're going to be able to like, it's like playing Guitar Hero to MTV.

16:35.000 --> 16:47.000
Well, you can play that all fine and dandy, but there will be a currency that you earn as you play through these streaming channels and you can use that currency to play songs on demand.

16:47.000 --> 16:55.000
But you're never actually purchasing the song, you're just purchasing it on demand to play whatever song it is you want.

16:55.000 --> 16:59.000
This is very similar to how some mobile-based music games work.

16:59.000 --> 17:06.000
Now, this means you're not downloading the song and owning it on your console anymore. That's not happening.

17:06.000 --> 17:15.000
So, you know, and that's a little weird at first when we talk about DLC. It's like, shouldn't I own everything that I'm kind of paying the money for?

17:15.000 --> 17:22.000
But then I think about, how many songs in Rock Band did I buy to just play one or two times and I never went back and played them again?

17:22.000 --> 17:28.000
And I think you guys have all done this at some point, right? So, in a way, I'm kind of like, well, maybe the token thing makes sense.

17:28.000 --> 17:38.000
And they talked about in the open letter about how, you know, it's, well, you know, we get a lot of our music through Spotify and Apple Music now, so we wanted to try something that seemed a little more subscription-based.

17:38.000 --> 17:45.000
And I guess there's like a party pack thing you can buy, where like for 48 hours or something, you basically have unlimited access to the on-demand.

17:45.000 --> 17:50.000
So if you're going to have people come over, you can basically just own every song in the game for a certain amount of time.

17:50.000 --> 17:56.000
I have to admit, I don't want to like this idea, but I'm kind of open to it to see how it works.

17:56.000 --> 18:03.000
You know, again, the way we hear about things isn't always the way it plays out, as I just described with the Rock Band music and importing.

18:03.000 --> 18:09.000
But if it's going to work on, you know, in practice the way they're describing it, I'm open to it. I don't know.

18:09.000 --> 18:16.000
But I know it's controversial, because Kaijuto in chat says, over at live.vognetwork.com, fuck that idea, I don't like it.

18:16.000 --> 18:22.000
And I don't think he's alone in what he's saying with that. What do you guys think about what you're hearing about the Guitar Hero change there? Loki?

18:22.000 --> 18:30.000
I don't know. I mean, I like the idea of like the single-player game, but the DLC thing is just... I don't know.

18:30.000 --> 18:35.000
I don't know if I'd pay for that, because I'm not really on board with the whole Spotify thing. I mean, I just don't do that.

18:35.000 --> 18:42.000
I listen to the music I want to listen to, and that's it. If I want to discover something, I will find other means to do that.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
So, it just doesn't seem like it would appeal to me.

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
I see, and maybe I'm just different, because I am a Spotify person that I'm open to with the idea.

18:53.000 --> 18:57.000
Well, I'd have to see what kind of music is on there. I mean, that's the other thing, too.

18:57.000 --> 19:02.000
And here's the thing, though, but I totally understand. This is a very slippery slope.

19:02.000 --> 19:10.000
But, with that being said, if they had a DJ Hero game with this, then that would be a different story. I would probably be on board with that.

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
I think I'm actually in complete agreement for once with Mookie.

19:14.000 --> 19:19.000
Well, actually, if they just had a DJ Hero game, I'd be totally on board with that.

19:19.000 --> 19:30.000
But just don't let the people that touch, you know, Tony Hawk Pro Skater 5, they can't go in the same building with that game.

19:30.000 --> 19:36.000
Tigerclaw in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com points out, plus you have to be online to play this music.

19:36.000 --> 19:40.000
What if you don't want to be online to play a song? I mean, you have to be online to download it.

19:40.000 --> 19:52.000
But I have totally seen that case where you download the songs, then you take your thing to a convention or something where you may not have reliable internet, but you still have all your songs you can play.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.000
So that's certainly another downside to this tactic as well.

19:55.000 --> 20:00.000
I want to welcome to the show, joining us a little late tonight, he's tardy, but that's okay.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
Welcome everybody, a friend of the show who comes on quite frequently, say hello to Shane.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
Hi.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Hi.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Hi.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
How are you?

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Tired.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
Tired? Did you wake up from a nap and that's why you're late?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.000
Like, three hour nap.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
I got you.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Naps are the best.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
You missed Loki running back and forth.

20:16.000 --> 20:25.000
No, I heard about it on the way here. I was like, if I would have known, I would have brought my different amiibo that you don't have, like my Fire Emblem guys and stuff like that.

20:25.000 --> 20:31.000
Yeah, I don't have everything that Shane has. He has some extra ones, but we'll get that next time. Sound good? Alright.

20:31.000 --> 20:36.000
Shane, what do you think of all that? You're a long time music game fan. What do you think of where Guitar Hero is going with the DLC?

20:36.000 --> 20:42.000
If you can liken it to something like Apple Music, then I'm fine with it because I love that service.

20:42.000 --> 20:50.000
So, whatever, but again, just to reiterate what's been said here, I just want DJ Hero. I don't care about Guitar Hero.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Amen.

20:51.000 --> 20:58.000
Very interesting. It seems like we're all united. I would agree. I would be much more excited about a new DJ Hero game than Guitar Hero game.

20:58.000 --> 21:01.000
We saw DJ Hero today. Was that today? I think it was.

21:01.000 --> 21:10.000
Yeah, it was. It was in the Xbox 360 section of Toys R Us. Because, you know, I'm thinking like, oh, backwards compatibility. Maybe there's some 360 games I want to pick up again.

21:10.000 --> 21:18.000
And then I saw DJ Hero and obviously that's not, you know, with the peripheral and everything, I'm not expecting that to be backwards compatible, but I was like, oh, look, Shane.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
I know, it was sad.

21:20.000 --> 21:27.000
I was like, here's a great Xbox 360 game and then I saw Mass Effect 2 and I'm like, here's the best Xbox 360 game. So, anyway.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
I didn't say anything.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
You mean PC game.

21:29.000 --> 21:40.000
Whatever. Alright, before we get into our gaming weeks, since Shane is here and I don't have any place to talk about this on the show rule otherwise, well, first off, how have you been since the last time we had you on the show, Shane?

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
I've been.

21:41.000 --> 21:46.000
You've been, I was talking about this on last week's show. I don't know if you heard it or not, but I was talking about your toy obsession.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.000
Yeah, you make it sound like a bad thing. You made it sound like a bad thing today, too.

21:50.000 --> 21:55.000
Do you wish to state, would you like to clarify what your thing is?

21:55.000 --> 22:04.000
I just like Power Ranger toys and I want to finish this series before the new ones come out in November. I'm three away.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
And toy collecting is a pretty big thing.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Yeah, it's fun. It's like hunting.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.000
You said you're always running into Star Wars people.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.000
Yeah, but I don't understand what they're doing.

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
No, I'm not saying in a bad way. I just don't understand Star Wars. Like, they wouldn't understand Power Rangers.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
You don't know the characters they're looking for and all that stuff.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.000
No.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
But it's kind of similar to amiibo hunting, what you're doing, right?

22:25.000 --> 22:30.000
Yes, and that's what I fall back on. If I don't find a Power Ranger, well, maybe I'll find an amiibo.

22:30.000 --> 22:37.000
Now, I know there's like three characters you're desperately looking for. Do you want to put a shout out here for people to tweet you if they find them?

22:37.000 --> 22:44.000
As long as they don't pay, or as long as they're not scalping them for $25 to $30 a pop.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
Because you don't support scalpers.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
No, I don't support scalpers.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
What is it you're looking for?

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
I'm looking for Sting Rage, Spellbinder, and Vivizord.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
So they're like villains, right?

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Yeah, they're just villains.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
Okay.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
That's it, and then I'm done until November when it all starts up again.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.000
But you're going to go to Power Morphicon and probably spend a lot more money, right?

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Yes. Oh my god, I can't wait for Power Morphicon.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Are you excited for the movie?

23:06.000 --> 23:10.000
Now I am, since it sounds like it's not a reboot of the original series.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
William Murderface in chat says,

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Shane, what do you think about Dino Charge? I know where this is going.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
Oh my god, it's the best. I love it.

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
I have so many good feelings towards that series.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Is it your favorite series?

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
Yes, right now it is.

23:24.000 --> 23:31.000
It beats SPD, it's on par with RPM, but I think it's going to surpass RPM because RPM didn't have Riley and Chase.

23:31.000 --> 23:38.000
Until you started talking more about your Power Rangers obsession and doing this toy hunting thing,

23:38.000 --> 23:42.000
I really never realized that there were all different seasons.

23:42.000 --> 23:45.000
I thought they just kept recasting the original Rangers.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
No, that's terrible.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
I thought Rita Repulsa was still the villain.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
No.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Rob.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
I had no idea about any of this stuff.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
Well, you knew the Japanese series were all individual series, right?

23:57.000 --> 24:00.000
I know the Japanese, yeah, it's all from Japan.

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
But they were different series every season. They're from the get-go.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
I know that now.

24:05.000 --> 24:10.000
But also, nothing is better than the Mega Ranger vs. Car Ranger movie.

24:10.000 --> 24:15.000
He made me watch the trains from Japan, which they'll probably never have here.

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
I thought it was a cute thing, what I was watching.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.000
I can't get obsessed with it like Shane does, but whatever.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
I also super love Maji Ranger.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
Okay.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
That's Harry Potter.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.000
AKA Harry Potter Rangers.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
Alright, I'm gonna entertain one more Power Rangers question here for Shane.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
Why, let's just talk about this for an hour.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
What about Time Force, Shane?

24:35.000 --> 24:36.000
Shane, we should do a podcast.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
Time Force is really good.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.000
I want to do a podcast.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Let's do one about Power Rangers.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
But Time Force is really good. Time Rangers even better.

24:45.000 --> 24:50.000
But again, Riley and Chase aren't on that season, so I don't know what to tell you.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.000
Alright, another thing you've been obsessed with as of late.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.000
You want to talk about a particular PlayStation 4 game that you are in love with, right Shane?

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Is it not on the show roll?

24:59.000 --> 25:00.000
No, I forgot to put it on there.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
We'll put it on there so I don't...

25:01.000 --> 25:02.000
Oh, here it is.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
We're talking about it right on top of the show.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Oh my gosh, but it had a story.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
I know.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
What game do you love on PlayStation 4?

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Until Dawn.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
Yeah?

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
It's the best.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
It's gonna be my number one.

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
It beat out... everybody's gone to the rapture.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Until Dawn.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
Like, I watched so many Twitch streams of it.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
I just... I love that game.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
What is it about the game that you love?

25:23.000 --> 25:29.000
It's like a choose your own adventure book, but with killing and monsters.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
And sometimes there may be a hook that goes through your jaw.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Or maybe your eyes get gouged out.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.000
That's why I can't play it.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
It's so good.

25:37.000 --> 25:41.000
And now that there's gonna be a second one, I'm even more excited.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
Well, and that is the news, is that...

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
Well, they didn't confirm a second one is happening.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
It sold better than expectations, which I'm sure they expected four copies.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
They said this week it sold better than expectations.

25:52.000 --> 25:57.000
And even, you know, Yoshida had said a few months, or a couple weeks ago, I think it was,

25:57.000 --> 26:01.000
that he said that, you know, they didn't really advertise it a lot and it's been selling well.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
No, they didn't.

26:02.000 --> 26:09.000
And so, over at the developers, they're talking about what they could do for a sequel.

26:09.000 --> 26:15.000
I mean, if they can make it canon that everybody lives, and I mean everybody without spoiling it,

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
you could easily set it up for a sequel with a couple of the same characters, at least.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.000
Well, could they do something, though, where it's just, you know,

26:23.000 --> 26:26.000
and again, I'm trying to be very delicate with spoilers here,

26:26.000 --> 26:30.000
so could they take the mythology of the game, we'll just say that,

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
and maybe with a new cast?

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
I don't think that would be as good, because, I mean, well, technically,

26:36.000 --> 26:41.000
I don't even, I guess, want a real sequel, because the payoff for the game,

26:41.000 --> 26:47.000
besides it being just amazing overall, is finding out, like, the big twist about what's going on,

26:47.000 --> 26:52.000
and so you're going into the game with a new cast where they don't know what's going on,

26:52.000 --> 26:55.000
but you would already know at the start what's going on, so that's not as fun.

26:55.000 --> 26:59.000
Well, with horror movies, though, the cast rarely come back for the sequel.

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
I mean, you might have one or two, like, you know, Jamie Lee Curtis was in the first couple Halloween movies.

27:03.000 --> 27:07.000
Besides, they had to have a survivor that ends up becoming the new villain, or so.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
Yeah.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
I won't say anything about that.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
I mean, it's just a trope.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.000
All right.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Well, let's talk more about Power Rangers.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
Well, I will say, William Murderface in chat is saying,

27:18.000 --> 27:24.000
I would totally be up for a Sentai Power Rangers podcast, even add in Common Rider, which is also wrapped.

27:24.000 --> 27:29.000
Yes, they just started a new one, and I started watching it, and it's pretty...

27:29.000 --> 27:34.000
I don't know, it's only been one episode that I've seen so far, and I don't know how I feel about it,

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
but I'm going to start it from the start and finish it, because it's a neat motif.

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
All right. Well, if people want to tweet you support to start a Power Rangers podcast,

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
which, you know, just saying, would actually be a pretty cool addition to VOG, wink, wink,

27:46.000 --> 27:49.000
tweet Shane at Shane Alinko.

27:49.000 --> 27:55.000
You know, but I have to warn you, it's mostly going to be me talking about Chase and Riley and how much I love that.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.000
There's probably people that would be just fine with that, to be honest.

27:58.000 --> 27:59.000
Yeah, there would be.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
All right.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.000
All right.

28:01.000 --> 28:05.000
And Dark Soccer maybe wants to get in on that podcast as well.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
I'd have to catch up on stuff, because honestly, my favorite ever is Mega Ranger.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.000
Yeah.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
And there will be nothing better than Mega Ranger.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
Well, maybe, okay, just to help you see, this is what I do. I produce shows, right?

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Is this your hero's power?

28:18.000 --> 28:23.000
Yes, maybe a little bit. I would love that. If my power were to get people to start podcasts, I would love that.

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
Here's the thing. What you could do is you could go back through Power Rangers episodes,

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
and you're like the expert. You know them inside out. She likes Power Rangers, but she hasn't seen them.

28:31.000 --> 28:40.000
So it could be like you guys having just watched an episode together, talking about seeing it for the first time and seeing it, you know, like, like a veteran.

28:40.000 --> 28:45.000
Yeah, there's a lot of things I could say about that, but I won't discuss plans like that.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
All right. You don't want to have a meeting live on air. That's fine.

28:48.000 --> 28:52.000
No, unless we're just talking about Power Rangers in general.

28:52.000 --> 28:57.000
Well, back to Until Dawn real quick, not to be all like back and forth, but you mentioned you watch a lot of Twitch streams.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
Yes.

28:58.000 --> 29:03.000
And you know, you've, you've actually kind of like become a fan of some streamers through that.

29:03.000 --> 29:08.000
What is it about the Until Dawn streams that are really appealing to you?

29:08.000 --> 29:13.000
I don't even think it's necessarily the streamers themselves. So some are like really personable and awesome.

29:13.000 --> 29:18.000
But with Until Dawn, I like seeing the different choices people made versus what I did.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.000
I had a feeling.

29:19.000 --> 29:27.000
And I also like seeing, well, it kind of goes hand in hand. Like there are a lot of ways you can die in that game I didn't think you could, and it's pretty funny.

29:27.000 --> 29:35.000
Do you think that Until Dawn's success is going to cause in two years time to be a lot of choose your own adventure type games?

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
No.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.000
Like we're going to see more games like this?

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
No, I don't think so.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
You don't think so?

29:39.000 --> 29:48.000
Because I don't think it's that successful, but I think for a game that had no marketing and clearly they just didn't really end up caring about in the end that it's successful in that regard.

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
All right. Fair enough.

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
Okay. Well, on that note, let's get into our gaming weeks.

29:54.000 --> 29:59.000
We, after our kickoff topic, like to talk about what we have been playing this week, the types of video games we've been playing.

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
Darsakra, at the top of the show, you mentioned you were pretty proud of what you've accomplished this week.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Why don't you kick us off with how was your gaming week?

30:05.000 --> 30:07.000
Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer.

30:07.000 --> 30:10.000
I haven't gotten any more Amiibo cards yet.

30:10.000 --> 30:16.000
And that game is really just like sitting down and designing people's homes and watching everyone get completely happy.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.000
And then you get like backstory from some of the characters, too.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
So it's pretty neat.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.000
You get to work with Digby and that's also awesome because I like Digby.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
And I'm back to playing Dragon Age Inquisition.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
I thought I was going to put it aside and finish Origins again.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
And no, that didn't happen.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.000
I'm also playing Dragon Age Origins at the same time.

30:35.000 --> 30:46.000
I haven't played any Final Fantasy 14 this week, but I am hoping to enlist aid in just running nothing but a bunch of dungeons and instances.

30:47.000 --> 30:52.000
And then Dan and I were...

30:52.000 --> 31:00.000
He's been going through a real bout of playing the Rebirth games on the Wii U.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
And we also picked up...

31:02.000 --> 31:07.000
Have not started yet, but we picked up Earthbound Zero, aka Mother.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
Do you have your Happy Home Designer with you right now?

31:10.000 --> 31:11.000
Yes, I do.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
I would like to see that game, please.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Okay, sure.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
But not right now. I mean, we can't do that later.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
Okay.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
There's other things going on, like a show.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Like we do anything on the show.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
Hey!

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
Except talk about food and I raid Rob's Pantry.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
I heard that. I heard that the crash is pretty funny.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
Those were so good!

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
Rob, I'm just going to have to buy you another bag of those things.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
I think when I try to offer those to Shane, Shane's like, mmm, pumpkin.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.000
What?

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
No, not the pumpkin ones, the cranberry.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
What are you trying to offer me?

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
Food.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
I have food.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
Shane gave me donuts this morning.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
Oh, I have a sad story in the FUs of the week about that.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
Did the mint donut fall over?

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
You just have to wait.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
Oh, you bastard.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
Anyhow, if that's it for Dark Soccer, it's gaming week.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
Whatevs.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
Then let's get to Loki. How was your gaming week?

31:59.000 --> 32:04.000
I played a little bit of Super Mario Maker because I was trying to unlock more costumes.

32:04.000 --> 32:09.000
And so now I've hit the point where I can't play the easy mode anymore, which is super easy.

32:09.000 --> 32:14.000
So now I had to play normal mode, which is basically easy mode but longer.

32:14.000 --> 32:19.000
So I did that last night and played one, and that was about it.

32:19.000 --> 32:24.000
And then I've been playing Ingress because I have a lot of free time in the morning apparently.

32:24.000 --> 32:27.000
And I've leveled up to level four now.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.000
You guys don't understand how bizarro this is to me.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
It is bizarro.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Not just Loki.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
Shane, too, is now playing Ingress a little bit.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
You want to talk about bizarro.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
Why?

32:38.000 --> 32:41.000
Does this mean I have to start playing again so I don't feel left out?

32:41.000 --> 32:45.000
We could raid. We could raid Roseville. It needs it.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
Holy balls.

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
As we could go Toys R Us 2, suddenly preparing your toys.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.000
You saw how blue...

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
I'm not downloading it again.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.000
Yes.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
Bastard.

32:54.000 --> 33:00.000
Anyway, we're going to have a whole Orange Lounge radio team, and they're not even going to know what the hell is happening.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
We just need to have the orange color show up.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
I know. If we had an orange faction, that would be great.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
No.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
So here's how I finally got Shane to play.

33:07.000 --> 33:11.000
Because the first time, Shane was like, Ingress is so stupid, and he downloaded it.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
He's like, what color are you? Green?

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
He's like, I'm going to go blue.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
And so he went blue just to fuck with me, right?

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
And I think Shane truly does love the color blue.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
It is the best thing in the world.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
And I was like, Shane, you don't understand.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
If you play blue, you're cut off.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
And I can't help you at all in that game.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
And you'll just have to rely on strangers to help you out.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
Because some people take this shit very seriously.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.000
You don't understand.

33:33.000 --> 33:38.000
So finally the other day, I was like, Shane, you have that thing for the Power Rangers, right?

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
Like Chase and Riley, right? What color are they?

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Because I was like, I don't think it was the Blue Ranger.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
And he goes, they were green and black.

33:44.000 --> 33:47.000
I said, did you know in Ingress, when you make fields, they're kind of green and black.

33:47.000 --> 33:50.000
And you can name yourself after a Power Ranger.

33:50.000 --> 33:53.000
And then Shane's eyes kind of like, you make a good argument.

33:55.000 --> 34:00.000
It was that and the fact that I go look for the toys, so I'm driving to these places anyway.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.000
Yeah.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
So I finally got Shane to roll for the correct team.

34:03.000 --> 34:06.000
And I said, the blue is the wrong shade anyway.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
It is kind of a light color.

34:08.000 --> 34:13.000
Well, I mean, and I've been just walking in the morning going to random parks.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
There's some Resistance players that probably listen to this show that are like, whatever, Rob, you're an idiot.

34:17.000 --> 34:22.000
I'm sorry about it. Of course I'm going to recruit my friends for the same faction. Deal with it.

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
Rob, you're totally not at all remotely sorry about anything ever.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Nope. Not at all.

34:29.000 --> 34:34.000
So, but yeah, I mean, uh, so I've been walking around in the mornings and doing that.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.000
Yeah, but you want to talk with Zorro World. I've been fucking eating salad every night.

34:37.000 --> 34:42.000
So that's, you know, yeah, I know like a pod person or something.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
I don't know what's going on.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.000
That's weird.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.000
All right.

34:47.000 --> 34:52.000
Uh, but anyways, yeah, so Ingress and then, um, level four and I don't know.

34:52.000 --> 34:56.000
It's hard to level over here because there's like too much blue.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
There's a lot of blue.

34:57.000 --> 35:02.000
Well, again, we have to do that thing where you go, we find like a bunch of portals in a park or something that are blue.

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
I smash them, you cap them and link them and then that's, that's the best way to level up.

35:06.000 --> 35:07.000
Yeah.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
That's what I do. That's how he got to level three in like a day.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
So anyway.

35:11.000 --> 35:15.000
By the way, all those portals that you smashed or whatever, they're all back to blue again.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
Of course they are. Of course they are.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.000
Except for one. Which they link to mine.

35:20.000 --> 35:25.000
All right. Uh, let's get to Shane. How was your gaming week? What are you up to?

35:25.000 --> 35:30.000
I've been playing Ingress a little bit, not as much as everybody else, but just a little bit.

35:30.000 --> 35:38.000
And, um, I, the game I completely wrote off on the 3DS, started playing on my phone, Pokemon shuffle.

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
I can't quit playing it. Um.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
The microtransactions in that game don't bother you though?

35:43.000 --> 35:50.000
I don't use them. I just wait the, I can't do math, but the time to get more hearts and then I play.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
And then if I don't have hearts and I don't play.

35:53.000 --> 35:58.000
And then, um, I have been playing on my Japanese 3DS.

35:58.000 --> 36:02.000
Uh, they put out a Ninja game, which again, back to Power Rangers.

36:02.000 --> 36:06.000
It's not very good. Don't get it. It's pretty, pretty crappy.

36:06.000 --> 36:15.000
Um, and then me and Flaco Jones and his wife, we played Soma last night and that was fun because Soma is pretty scary.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.000
Oh yeah. You've been really into that.

36:16.000 --> 36:23.000
It's not scary, I guess, but the atmosphere is really good and it makes you feel awkward when you play it. I like it.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.000
How so?

36:24.000 --> 36:28.000
Well, there's this one part near the beginning, so I don't think it's really a spoiler.

36:28.000 --> 36:36.000
Um, it's when you are underwater in like this lab and there's this robot in the wall that's calling out for help.

36:36.000 --> 36:41.000
And you go over to him and he thinks he's human and you try to kind of argue with him about it.

36:41.000 --> 36:48.000
And the only way to get by him is to shut this power down, but he thinks he's hurt and when you shut the power down, he screams in pain.

36:48.000 --> 36:56.000
And it's the only way he can get by, but again, he thinks he's human, so it's like you're torturing him to get by and it just makes you unsettled.

36:56.000 --> 37:02.000
This sounds like one of those sadistic Mario Maker levels where the only way to clear the level is to kill Yoshi.

37:02.000 --> 37:18.000
No, it's not that sad. But it's a really interesting game so far and the one enemy we ran into just looks like a big blue robot chicken thing and it wasn't very scary.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
But I'm sure there's more later.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Alright, fair enough.

37:23.000 --> 37:29.000
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com. SSG100Matt talking about Ingress here for Loki saying,

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
I wonder if Nellie is pissed at Rob that now her husband is wandering around raiding portals.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.000
She doesn't care. I mean, I just told her-

37:35.000 --> 37:40.000
I would actually think she'd be happy that Matt's probably volunteering to change Kid's Park.

37:40.000 --> 37:44.000
I tried explaining the game to her, she just doesn't give a shit what I'm doing. She's like,

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
I don't know what you're talking about.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
But he's walking more-

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
I'm just saying, I go for walks in the morning.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
And she's like, why don't you go to our park?

37:52.000 --> 37:56.000
I'm like, because these parks are closer and more convenient for me.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
And also I'm playing this game.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.000
Just waiting to get to level 8, then you're going to be places you never thought you'd ever go.

38:04.000 --> 38:11.000
I had to go to a dog park and walk into the park where the actual dogs are running around and just sit there playing on my phone and these people look like,

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
what the hell is he doing?

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
I am hacking this portal.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
Wait until there's a group of like 10 of you at the park all staring at your fuckers.

38:19.000 --> 38:23.000
And then I'm like, hey, look at this cemetery has a ton of portals I can hack.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.000
I'm going to go walk around in a cemetery. That's going to look strange.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.000
Just put on the goth makeup and no one will care.

38:32.000 --> 38:37.000
Actually, I find there's a lot of people that go walking in cemeteries because it's quiet and calm.

38:37.000 --> 38:41.000
Like, you know, it creeps some people out, but for others it's like-

38:41.000 --> 38:44.000
Well, it doesn't creep me out at all. It's just like, you know-

38:45.000 --> 38:46.000
When I lived in Alabama-

38:46.000 --> 38:50.000
Are you here to visit somebody? No? Just kicking it? Okay, cool.

38:50.000 --> 38:54.000
If you watched this week's Scream Queens, there's other things you can do in a cemetery too.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
That's after dark and you have to be a weird person to do that.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
It was so good.

39:02.000 --> 39:09.000
Okay, so my gaming week. Well, I always play Ingress. I just don't talk about it here on OLR, but I play other games too.

39:09.000 --> 39:14.000
I've been playing more Diablo 3. Alan and I have been running our season characters.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Here's the hilarious thing.

39:16.000 --> 39:26.000
So, my non-seasonal character, which, keep in mind, has the experience dump from season 1, 2, and 3, is Paragon 281.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
My seasonal character is now Paragon 274.

39:29.000 --> 39:35.000
I'm about to pass, experience-wise, all of the experience I've gained until the season started, which is a pretty big deal.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
So, that is Diablo 3.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
I have breaking news for you, I forgot.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
Oh god, alright.

39:40.000 --> 39:45.000
No, so earlier today we were talking about PlayStation TVs, because this is gaming related.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
Yeah.

39:47.000 --> 39:53.000
Because they're on sale right now at a retailer, and you were like, I don't want one unless it can play Luminous.

39:53.000 --> 39:58.000
And we saw that it said it couldn't, but I don't believe the internet most of the time.

39:58.000 --> 40:04.000
So, I put in Luminous, you can start it, and that's it. You can't do anything. You can't get beyond the start screen.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.000
That is so dumb.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.000
That is very dumb.

40:06.000 --> 40:09.000
Unless you have the hack, which you can do and it can play most games.

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Oh, you know about that. Oh, there you go, you can hack it.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
I can hack it. Alright, yeah, I know we talked about the hack.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
You have to send yourself an email.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.000
Go with me too.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
Yeah.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
Weird.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
Alright, anyway, other games I've been playing this week besides Diablo.

40:20.000 --> 40:29.000
Some new stuff. I played Super Meat Boy on PlayStation 4, because you guys might have heard that Super Meat Boy was finally released on the PlayStation platforms,

40:29.000 --> 40:33.000
and they did the release on PlayStation 4, as well as the Vita.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
I haven't played the Vita version, just the PlayStation 4 version.

40:36.000 --> 40:45.000
Very interesting twist, because due to, I guess, some types of arrangement disagreements with the original soundtrack creator,

40:45.000 --> 40:50.000
there's a brand new soundtrack for Super Meat Boy for the PlayStation version.

40:50.000 --> 40:55.000
And I'm going to be honest, I love a lot of the composers that are in the new soundtrack.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
Not as good as the old soundtrack.

40:57.000 --> 41:01.000
And maybe if I'd never heard the old soundtrack, I wouldn't feel that way.

41:01.000 --> 41:08.000
But I just feel like, I don't know, like having played Super Meat Boy all these years on 360 and Steam and so forth,

41:08.000 --> 41:19.000
with that, you know, kind of chiptune soundtrack, to kind of go from that to like a music in level one that sounds like this rodeo twang thing just doesn't really work for me.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
Like, I'm weird.

41:20.000 --> 41:26.000
It's really interesting how important a soundtrack can kind of be to a game.

41:26.000 --> 41:31.000
And I didn't like the way the soundtrack scaled in the retro levels and some of that either.

41:31.000 --> 41:39.000
The game itself is still good, but I also caught some like shadowing effects and some weird frame rate things on PlayStation.

41:39.000 --> 41:43.000
I don't know if that has to do with the refresh rate on my TV or what, but I'm going to be honest,

41:43.000 --> 41:49.000
I still think the 360 version or maybe even the Steam version is probably the definitive version of that game.

41:49.000 --> 41:54.000
It's nice that it's on the PlayStation platform, especially free for PlayStation Plus people,

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
which if you have a PlayStation, you got to be PlayStation Plus.

41:57.000 --> 42:00.000
So, I mean, that's cool if you've never had a chance to play it before.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.000
It's, you know, still a good game and the soundtrack's not really going to change that.

42:03.000 --> 42:08.000
But I don't think it's the definitive experience for Super Meat Boy.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
And that's my honest opinion.

42:10.000 --> 42:18.000
Also played a game on Steam called Read Only Memories, which you might have heard came out this week, which you also played.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Which I bought, but I haven't played yet. I forgot to mention.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.000
Oh, I bought that, but I never got a key for it.

42:23.000 --> 42:27.000
Check your email, because the keys didn't come out until the day the game came out.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
And so, yeah.

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
I hope I didn't delete it.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
You know, I kickstarted the game. So, there you go.

42:32.000 --> 42:38.000
So, I got my code and played, like, the first little bit of it.

42:38.000 --> 42:45.000
Okay, so I'm going to be very honest in saying something that might sound really cold, but it's just like,

42:45.000 --> 42:48.000
I'm just, tonight is honesty night, everybody.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
Here's the thing.

42:49.000 --> 42:53.000
I actually wasn't expecting the game to be very good.

42:53.000 --> 42:59.000
And only because I know that these guys are very busy with the convention and all this stuff,

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
and, you know, when I saw that they went the retro route, I was like,

43:03.000 --> 43:07.000
oh, they're probably doing that, you know, because it's, like, easier or whatever.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
Never mind, I didn't back it, unfortunately.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
Oh, you didn't back it?

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
No, I was thinking Electronic Opus.

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
Oh, no, no, no.

43:12.000 --> 43:18.000
And I thought, you know, oh, it's probably, they're stretched too thin,

43:18.000 --> 43:21.000
and they're not really going to have the time to make the game.

43:21.000 --> 43:26.000
But I'm happy to say, as cold as that sounds, the game actually turned out pretty good.

43:26.000 --> 43:31.000
And it really does feel like a throwback to, like, the older PC games.

43:31.000 --> 43:35.000
Like, I'm playing, like, I don't know, King's Quest or Space Quest,

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
or one of those, like, old school games on the PC.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
And so, I like that aesthetic.

43:40.000 --> 43:44.000
It's heavily, heavily inspired by Snatcher, which I don't have as much experience with,

43:44.000 --> 43:49.000
but from what I understand about the game, that influence is definitely there as well.

43:49.000 --> 43:54.000
So, as mean as what I said is, I'm happy to say the game is actually better

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
than I expected in that regard.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
But, yeah.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
So, there you go.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.000
I only played through the prologue in the first little bit of Chapter 1,

44:01.000 --> 44:05.000
so I still have a long way to go, but my early impressions are,

44:05.000 --> 44:06.000
okay, this is, like, retro, kind of cool.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.000
I like it.

44:09.000 --> 44:13.000
I know a lot of people have heard about, you know, because it was the Kickstarter,

44:13.000 --> 44:19.000
because it was the same team that does GamerX, which is now GX,

44:19.000 --> 44:22.000
some people are wondering about, is there a huge, like,

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
social justice warrior agenda in the game.

44:25.000 --> 44:31.000
And to be honest, like, I think a lot of people are talking about the pronoun thing,

44:31.000 --> 44:36.000
which, to me, like, don't most games that are a little bit first person,

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
don't they, like, ask you in the beginning,

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
like, oh, are you boy or girl?

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Like, you get asked that question in the beginning of the game.

44:42.000 --> 44:47.000
Okay, so the difference here is that it's just, so, what do you prefer to be called?

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
And it's, like, a list of five things, or you can even put in your own thing.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
And I don't see the big issue with that.

44:52.000 --> 44:58.000
Like, whatever makes you happy and what you prefer to be addressed by, go for it.

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
I could even change it, and I thought about doing this,

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
so instead of having, like, he or him, I was going to do, like,

45:04.000 --> 45:07.000
the whole, like, Peppermint Patty and Marcy thing and be addressed as sir.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
And the game would have let me do that.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
So, you know, I think it's, you can do whatever you want.

45:11.000 --> 45:12.000
That's cool.

45:12.000 --> 45:18.000
Yeah. So, and, but, I mean, the story, like, it isn't like it's this huge, like,

45:18.000 --> 45:22.000
oh, we have to start this campaign and get signatures

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
to get such and such TV show off the air because it's problematic.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Like, that's not what the game is about at all.

45:27.000 --> 45:30.000
Your friend gets kidnapped and you're trying to put together the clues

45:30.000 --> 45:36.000
about where your friend has gone off to because the little robot servant dude

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
escaped and came to you for help.

45:38.000 --> 45:43.000
So, I mean, it's like, so the story itself has nothing to do with any of that.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
So, there you go.

45:45.000 --> 45:48.000
So, that was my thought on Read Only Memories.

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
So, that was my gaming week.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
My early thoughts, I should say.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
Quick housekeeping.

45:53.000 --> 45:59.000
Not a lot to say, but I will say, speaking of GX and all that,

45:59.000 --> 46:05.000
we are going to be there at GX3, which is the weekend December 11th and 12th

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
and 13th, I think it's Friday, Saturday, Sunday, that whole weekend.

46:08.000 --> 46:12.000
Dark Soccer and myself will be there, as well as,

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
I don't know if anybody else from VoG is going,

46:14.000 --> 46:17.000
but I know some other friendly podcasters and some people

46:17.000 --> 46:20.000
that have been here on OLR are going to be there with us.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
And VoG will actually have a table at the show,

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
and I still don't know what we're doing with said table,

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
but we'll figure it out.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
You know, now that I have the-

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
I'll arm wrestle people.

46:29.000 --> 46:33.000
Now that I have the Retron and this, we actually have a spare TV,

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
maybe what we'll do is we'll set up like a classic gaming thing.

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
If you want to bring some of your games, we can figure something out.

46:39.000 --> 46:43.000
Which reminds me, did you still want to borrow a Neo Geo Pocket Color?

46:43.000 --> 46:44.000
Because we have several.

46:44.000 --> 46:47.000
I might, but I don't want to keep it, but I'll borrow it.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.000
Okay.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Yeah, to play it and check it out, but I don't want to keep it, yeah.

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
Okay.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Yeah, that'll work. Cool.

46:53.000 --> 46:58.000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news then, now that all that's done.

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
Oh, Twitter.com slash OLR, Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio,

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Google.com slash plus Orange Lounge Radio.

47:04.000 --> 47:05.000
All that good stuff.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Okay, let's get into some gaming news.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
Loki's starting us off this week.

47:08.000 --> 47:12.000
Well, a good way to kick off the holiday season is a price drop,

47:12.000 --> 47:13.000
and that's what Sony has.

47:13.000 --> 47:17.000
They announced effective October 9th that the base PlayStation 4 will drop

47:17.000 --> 47:23.000
from $399 to $349 in the US, and in Canada it would be $449 to $429.

47:23.000 --> 47:28.000
And the holiday bundles are going to be dropping as well.

47:28.000 --> 47:34.000
So take a look out for that if you're in the market for PlayStation 4.

47:34.000 --> 47:42.000
Also, to go along with that, if you're in the UK, you can now utilize PlayStation Now,

47:42.000 --> 47:48.000
and you can stream over 100 games, and that is a thing, I guess, now.

47:48.000 --> 47:53.000
They have an unlimited subscription for, looks like, 13 pounds.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
Nice.

47:54.000 --> 47:57.000
That price drop, though, totally not shocking.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
We all knew it was coming, right?

47:59.000 --> 48:02.000
Yeah, I mean, it's been a couple years already.

48:02.000 --> 48:05.000
This is about that time where people are going to start thinking about the holidays.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
I mean, Black Friday is when it really kicks into gear,

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
but since there will be some game releases throughout October and November,

48:09.000 --> 48:10.000
now is the time to do it.

48:10.000 --> 48:15.000
Yeah, like a Fallout 4 or Call of Duty or Just Cause 3.

48:15.000 --> 48:20.000
Or that Star Wars Battlefront thing that happened this weekend, I know, for the beta.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
Just a few games coming out.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Yeah, so it was the right time.

48:24.000 --> 48:31.000
So, yeah, that keeps the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One neck and neck with the price, competitive.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
You're moved, Nintendo.

48:33.000 --> 48:37.000
Seriously, or just, I don't know.

48:37.000 --> 48:40.000
Have to sweeten that bundle or something.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
Do something.

48:41.000 --> 48:47.000
Well, it's almost kind of like, it seems like kind of an idle state, you know, until the NX stuff comes out.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
It's like, oh, hey, we're saving all the sweet stuff for the NX,

48:50.000 --> 48:53.000
and they better not fucking pull Twilight Princess on us with the fucking,

48:53.000 --> 48:56.000
oh, hey, remember that cool Zelda game?

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Yeah, about that.

48:58.000 --> 49:02.000
I know, a lot of people seem to think that's where it's going to go. We'll see.

49:02.000 --> 49:05.000
That's not going to be on the Wii. That's going to piss people off.

49:05.000 --> 49:09.000
Some people thought Twilight Princess on GameCube was a better experience than the Wii.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.000
So, I don't know, just putting it out there.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
I guess we have to really know what NX is.

49:14.000 --> 49:18.000
Maybe NX doesn't really lend itself well to this Zelda game, so it can't do it.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
We don't know.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.000
It would be cool if it was something, well, I don't know.

49:23.000 --> 49:27.000
NX is also a version of Pump It Up.

49:27.000 --> 49:30.000
It'll just be the Nintendo dance console.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
I'd be down with that, actually.

49:32.000 --> 49:36.000
All right, well, speaking of Nintendo, and a game that I did play this week, but I forgot to talk about,

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
I played a little bit of Splatoon.

49:38.000 --> 49:39.000
Oh, yeah, me too.

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
Yeah, Splatfest happened. Were you Team Planes or Cars?

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
I said maybe be Team Planes.

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
Well, we lost.

49:46.000 --> 49:49.000
I can't play ranked matches anyway, so it's not ranked.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
It's not ranked. You just go into the regular matches.

49:51.000 --> 49:54.000
Well, I won a couple and lost one, so woo!

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
You might get some snails when you load up the game again.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
Ew.

49:58.000 --> 50:03.000
I will not play it if there are any type of land-based mollusks involved.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
They're a currency. You just sell them.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
Yeah, they're a currency.

50:06.000 --> 50:09.000
No, I won't play it now.

50:09.000 --> 50:12.000
Interesting. All right.

50:12.000 --> 50:18.000
But, yeah, so Planes lost. Even though it was like 64 to 36 percent popularity,

50:18.000 --> 50:24.000
it seems like every Splatfest, the least popular team, does better in the wins.

50:24.000 --> 50:28.000
Except last time. Art won, and it was more popular, and it had more wins.

50:28.000 --> 50:32.000
Oh, but wasn't it like really neck and neck? Like it was like 51-49 or something?

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Yeah, both of them were.

50:34.000 --> 50:39.000
It was really neck and neck. No, the only Splatfest I've won is the friggin' Decepticon one.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
I've never won one still.

50:41.000 --> 50:45.000
Jeez, what is up with that? So anyway, that wasn't the news I wanted to get to,

50:45.000 --> 50:51.000
but just throwing it out there. But with Splatoon, they have actually just launched Splatnet.

50:51.000 --> 50:56.000
So if you go to splatoon.nintendo.net, you can log in with your Nintendo Network ID,

50:56.000 --> 51:02.000
and you can actually, I mean, there's not a lot there, but you can see your friends list online,

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
which that's something I don't remember Nintendo doing before.

51:05.000 --> 51:10.000
Can we please have it so every time I log into that game, I don't get the stupid news update

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
that's really annoying.

51:12.000 --> 51:16.000
They do that so you know the stages, but that's what the app or the site does.

51:16.000 --> 51:21.000
I don't care what the stages are, or have it so I can skip that shit, because I don't care.

51:21.000 --> 51:24.000
And the app will tell you what the stages are if you need to know.

51:24.000 --> 51:28.000
It'll tell you the next three sets, which is great, because that's also for ranked.

51:28.000 --> 51:31.000
It'll tell you what ranked styles are coming up.

51:31.000 --> 51:35.000
And then it shows you if your friends are on, so without having to turn the Wii U on,

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
you know if your friends are online or not. And then I guess you can set times,

51:38.000 --> 51:42.000
but that just sends out a tweet or does it through the sidebar, right?

51:42.000 --> 51:49.000
Yeah, it sends out a tweet, and it also sends it out in Japanese, because Jim did it,

51:49.000 --> 51:54.000
and it was like, tweet English, and then two minutes later it was in Japanese.

51:54.000 --> 51:57.000
I was like, when did you type that?

51:57.000 --> 52:02.000
Speaking of Japanese, I know this is really random, but before the show tonight,

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
we were doing Mario Maker, because Loki brought his amiibo that I don't have,

52:05.000 --> 52:10.000
because I don't have a Bowser. So he brought his Bowser, and he brought that other Mario,

52:10.000 --> 52:15.000
which I did not realize it is the blue Mario and the brown Mario, the pixelated ones,

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
they are different.

52:17.000 --> 52:18.000
Didn't I tell you that?

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
You did, but it's not what you said it was.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
Did you still go big?

52:22.000 --> 52:27.000
You go big, but you're the classic colors, and it doesn't do the television effect.

52:27.000 --> 52:30.000
I'm sorry, you're the modern colors, and it doesn't do the TV effect.

52:30.000 --> 52:31.000
Oh, that's weird.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Yeah, it's weird. So the two amiibo do different things.

52:33.000 --> 52:36.000
But anyway, I unlocked Bowser, but the reason why I bring that up,

52:36.000 --> 52:39.000
I also got the notification that says you have messages,

52:39.000 --> 52:43.000
and I noticed a Japanese player commented on my Bowser man level,

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
and I was like, oh, that's kind of, okay, cool, international, I got something there.

52:47.000 --> 52:52.000
Well, I pulled up the comments, and the Japanese player had just posted,

52:52.000 --> 52:56.000
they drew a pile of poop as a comment to my level.

52:56.000 --> 53:00.000
Now, are they actually trying to say that my level was shit?

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
Is that what they're trying to say, that it was a shitty level?

53:02.000 --> 53:05.000
Because I'm like, sorry, you couldn't handle it.

53:05.000 --> 53:10.000
Or did they just draw poop because they could?

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
Did they shit themselves playing the level?

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
Maybe it's not poop. Maybe it's ice cream.

53:14.000 --> 53:17.000
Maybe it's ice cream without a cone. I don't know.

53:17.000 --> 53:21.000
Soft serve ice cream. Here's some soft serve ice cream for you.

53:21.000 --> 53:24.000
That was soft serve ice cream from a magical unicorn's butt.

53:24.000 --> 53:25.000
That's what it was.

53:25.000 --> 53:31.000
That would be amazing if soft serve ice cream came out of a unicorn's ass.

53:31.000 --> 53:35.000
I might like unicorns a little bit more for that.

53:35.000 --> 53:41.000
But it'd actually have to be ice cream. I will not accept, you know, trick ice cream.

53:41.000 --> 53:46.000
Let's see, Tiger Clonchette says, Sky, probably, because you know that old saying,

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
a picture is worth a thousand words.

53:48.000 --> 53:52.000
S2100Matt says, was it Irene posing as a Japanese player?

53:52.000 --> 53:55.000
That would actually make a lot of sense.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
That would.

53:57.000 --> 54:00.000
That would make a lot of sense.

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
All right. Let's see.

54:05.000 --> 54:08.000
Let's go on, I guess, to our next story, except our soccer ran out of the room.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
So I guess we'll loop back to her here in a minute.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
So, Loki, why don't you take what's next?

54:12.000 --> 54:15.000
All right. So, Konami.

54:15.000 --> 54:20.000
We used to love you, but now you're just kind of like, what the hell?

54:20.000 --> 54:26.000
So now, Konami, as part of their microtransaction fest in Metal Gear Solid V,

54:26.000 --> 54:29.000
they have the whole FOBs that you can have,

54:29.000 --> 54:33.000
and you can have people attack them and stuff like that in their little multiplayer mode.

54:33.000 --> 54:39.000
Well, now you can insure your FOB for real money.

54:39.000 --> 54:45.000
That way, if someone attacks your base and destroys stuff, you get paid for it.

54:45.000 --> 54:51.000
And so you can pay with it for MB coins or real money.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Yeah. So that's nice.

54:54.000 --> 55:02.000
And then, along with that, they have some cosmetic DLC for 99 cents each.

55:02.000 --> 55:08.000
And they even went as far as to add horse armor.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
Like, this is one of those things you can't even make up.

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
Like, it's just, you know, it's so meta, what's happening there.

55:16.000 --> 55:21.000
Yeah, so, I mean, it's like, I don't know, it's like different tack.

55:21.000 --> 55:24.000
Like, you have western tack and parade tack.

55:24.000 --> 55:28.000
But it's basically costumes for your horse, so...

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
Alright, I mean, sure.

55:32.000 --> 55:36.000
It's like, let's just make this even more of a joke now.

55:36.000 --> 55:41.000
But, oh my god, the whole DLC for a freaking insurance against other players?

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
You know, let's be honest, so...

55:43.000 --> 55:47.000
I used to play, okay, I used to play a Facebook game called Sorority Life.

55:47.000 --> 55:53.000
And the whole thing in Sorority Life was that I guess you could attack other bitches' sororities and steal their money and stuff.

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Like, that was the whole thing in the game.

55:55.000 --> 55:59.000
And it's like, if you don't check in every day, you're gonna get attacked by all these high level players.

55:59.000 --> 56:00.000
They're gonna take all your shit.

56:00.000 --> 56:03.000
And it gets really frustrating. That's why I don't play it anymore.

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
And I was like, that's in Metal Gear Solid 5?

56:05.000 --> 56:08.000
And I have to pay to protect myself?

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
Get fucked. I don't care.

56:10.000 --> 56:13.000
Like, I don't know, is that just one mode of the game?

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Yeah, it's like their little multiplayer mode that they have in there.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
I don't know, I guess fine, I won't be playing that.

56:17.000 --> 56:22.000
The unnecessary multiplayer mode that they added in so they can unnecessarily charge you for insurance.

56:22.000 --> 56:29.000
Wait till they add an update where the computer can attack your base so they make you get that insurance and not just other players attacking you.

56:29.000 --> 56:34.000
I mean, Grand Theft Auto Online has insurance for your cars that they get destroyed, but it's with in-game money.

56:34.000 --> 56:41.000
You don't have the, I mean, you could buy real money, or in-game money with real money, but you don't have to.

56:41.000 --> 56:45.000
And, I don't know, it's just dumb.

56:45.000 --> 56:51.000
Dungeon Buster in chat says, I don't care about my FOB, I just used it to expand my staffing levels, you can totally ignore it.

56:51.000 --> 56:57.000
And William Murderface in chat says, well at this point Konami has burned most of its bridges with game fans, so why not all of them?

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Why not?

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
Just light it on fire.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Hey, they're still making games though, console games.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Is anyone gonna give a shit when it comes out?

57:05.000 --> 57:10.000
I mean, seriously, is anyone gonna give a shit of whatever they have coming out that's aside from Pro Evo?

57:11.000 --> 57:14.000
If it's Dance Sense Revolution, I may give a little bit of a shit.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
A little bit of a shit, yeah.

57:15.000 --> 57:18.000
A little bit of a shit, but, you know, most likely no.

57:18.000 --> 57:23.000
Since Rock Band and Guitar Hero are all having this resurgence, we're gonna try Beatmania again in the US?

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Yeah, right. I'm not gonna hold my breath all night.

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
No, they'll do, um, what was their other game?

57:28.000 --> 57:29.000
Rock Revolution.

57:29.000 --> 57:30.000
That one, yeah, that's what they'll revive.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
Ugh, alright.

57:32.000 --> 57:36.000
Let's go back to Dark Sakura, because we jumped over one of your-

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
But their drum set was so unique!

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

57:41.000 --> 57:46.000
Well, we've been talking for a little bit about the voice acting strike.

57:46.000 --> 57:54.000
It's, uh, I suppose it's just pronounced SAGAFTRA, or S-A-G-A-F-T-R-A.

57:54.000 --> 58:04.000
Had put out the request for votes to see if they want to authorize a strike in response to an impasse in negotiations with the game industry.

58:04.000 --> 58:11.000
And 96.52% of its members voted and authorized a strike.

58:11.000 --> 58:17.000
They have to have the 75% yes vote to give the national board the authority for it.

58:17.000 --> 58:23.000
So, now this doesn't mean there's a strike right now and there's no more voice acting, good voice acting in games ever.

58:23.000 --> 58:31.000
It just means that they now have the ability to have a strike, and so they're opening things up for negotiations.

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
It looks like, uh-

58:34.000 --> 58:41.000
They've drawn the strike card and put it into their deck for possible future play, but they don't necessarily have to play it.

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
Exactly, it's recycled back into their library.

58:44.000 --> 58:45.000
Yes.

58:45.000 --> 58:49.000
So, it could be on, it couldn't be on, who knows.

58:49.000 --> 58:56.000
It's just, it's now a tactic that's available and endorsed by the majority of its members.

58:57.000 --> 59:03.000
And it probably wouldn't affect games right away because most of your voice acting is done a long time in advance.

59:03.000 --> 59:07.000
But still, not to lessen the impact that a strike like this would have.

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
And we talked about it on a previous episode of the show.

59:09.000 --> 59:14.000
You know, it's a pretty, pretty big deal and could, you know, majorly impact some games down the line.

59:14.000 --> 59:18.000
Especially games that have sequels that you get used to.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Like, you know, like BioWare games, right?

59:20.000 --> 59:23.000
You know, we all know they won't stop with Mass Effect Andromeda.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
They'll be in Andromeda 2 or something.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
That could be impacted by a strike like this.

59:27.000 --> 59:30.000
You know, the same voice talent may not be available or they'd have to schedule it differently.

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
It could delay the game or what have you.

59:33.000 --> 59:40.000
On the flip side, there's some more amateur level voice actors who are a part of SAG-AFTRA who are excited!

59:40.000 --> 59:41.000
Yay, work!

59:41.000 --> 59:48.000
But it's kind of like, well, you know, and then you get into those tricky situations where you're crossing a picket line, essentially.

59:48.000 --> 59:54.000
But aren't they striking in the first place for better conditions for everybody?

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
Like the whole yelling and stuff.

59:56.000 --> 59:59.000
We talked about this, you know, I know Marisa called in last week. We talked a little bit about it.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000
I'd actually like for Marisa to call in again.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Yeah, but anyway.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
If she's out there.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Yeah.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Hopefully we'll get to her later in the show.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Because I know she had, I saw a Facebook post of hers that addressed this whole thing.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
So it'll be interesting.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Again, they have not actually gone on strike, but they've drawn the card and they can choose to play it or discard it on a later turn.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
So we'll see what happens.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000
And well, actually, they could bring it up and then, like I said, recycle it back into their library.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
That's true.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
And cast it for five red mana.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
We'll see what happens. We'll see.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Alright, moving on. Talking about DLC, more DLC.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000
You know, Loki was just talking about Metal Gear Solid.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000
And earlier in the show we were talking about Guitar Hero.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Well, let's talk about Rise of the Tomb Raider.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Because Rise of the Tomb Raider also going to be having microtransactions, if you can believe it.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Rise of the Tomb Raider, you'll be able to get expedition card packs.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:08.000
The cards will have modifiers that you can use on custom missions, which you then share with your friends.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:15.000
So things like Big Head Mode or things that increase the challenge or give you special advantages.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:20.000
You can get these card packs with credits in the game or real money.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Sounds very similar to the BioWare setup in multiplayer.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:31.000
But it looks like it's just for this custom mission mode, which is not part of the main story game.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.000
There's also two types of cards in the game, foil and common.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Foil gets to be used an unlimited number of times, but commons are a one-time use.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:45.000
There will be about 300 cards to start with, more to come after that.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:52.000
So there you go, another $60 game with the DLC in there.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
And this one, again, another random element in there.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
But I don't know, because again, I kind of say it sounds like Mass Effect.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:05.000
But I was fine with the way Mass Effect did it and the way that Dragon Age multiplayer does it.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Because you can earn the stuff at a relatively decent pace yourself.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000
You don't have to spend money, it's just you spend money to rush it along.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
So I think it all depends on how it's weighed in the game.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000
It may not be as bad as it sounds on paper, but we'll see.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
We'll see when the game comes out.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Let's go back over to Dark Sakura for another story.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000
More from me. Why do you want to talk to me so much tonight?

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Because you ate all my food, you gotta work.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Oh, fine, fine. Well, at any rate, we all love Shovel Knight, don't we?

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Yay!

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Yes.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Thanks, Shane.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I never played it. I thought it was going to be Mega Man, but it wasn't.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
It's Duck Tales. It's not really that either.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:55.000
You gotta just check it out. It's like a Capcom game of that era, but it's not really like any of the others.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Well, they have announced, with extremely heavy hearts in the quote, that the Xbox One physical version of Shovel Knight is not happening.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Basically, they said that because of publishing policies on that platform, things that are beyond their control, it's not happening.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:18.000
The pre-orders were really good, and they thank everyone for their support, but it just can't happen.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:30.000
So, they agreed to a $19.99 price point, and then ran into other retail issues as well, so yeah, it's just not happening.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.000
That Microsoft. What are you going to do?

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000
You can calm your ex-boners now, because it's not happening.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Well, there's also a part of me that's like, is there a really big loss to not have a retail release?

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:52.000
What market really is there when the game's downloadable and so many people are connected now?

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
But then I think maybe...

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Some people like a physical release of it.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Well, there is that, and maybe other countries too, where it might not be as easy to get online.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
It's much easier to get the physical copy.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000
I don't know. That's just kind of the thought that goes through my head, is that maybe it's like, it actually is a huge deal.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Stocking stuffers?

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:15.000
I don't know. I don't know about that. Maybe.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:21.000
ActDeft in chat over at live.vognetwork.com has some feelings on this, saying I had that one pre-ordered. I'm really sad.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:29.000
And that it's DuckTales, Castlevania, Metroid, and all the really good platformers of the NES era, and putting a lot of frowny faces at what Shane is saying.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.000
I didn't even say anything. All I said was I thought it was Mega Man, but apparently it's not.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
That's all I said.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000
What if it's better? I mean, it probably is better than some of the later Mega Man games.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000
I like the proper number series just fine.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:52.000
But I do want the Amiibo, probably, because it's an Amiibo, and if I can't find a Power Ranger toy that day and I can find him, I'm sure that's what I'll want.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I definitely want the Shovel Knight Amiibo, that's for sure.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:05:00.000
But anyway, alright. We're going to travel around the world and check out some release dates of games that will be coming out.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Yes. And this week, actually, there's the Back to the Future game by Telltale Games.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:13.000
They're doing a 30th anniversary edition because, hey, the 30th anniversary of the movie!

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Well, not really the movie, but like the... Isn't this like the same, now the Back to the Future 2 date or something coming up?

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Isn't it like the 15th or something?

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Is someone going crazy about that?

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Anyway, so that date is coming up, and that'll be coming out on Xbox 360 and, I believe, PlayStation 4.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Along with that, there's going to be Grand Ages Medieval, Wasteland 2.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Oh, and Grand Ages Medieval is going to be coming out on PlayStation 4.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:49.000
Wasteland 2 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, the Director's Cut.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Dragon Quest Heroes Slime, Collector's Edition on PlayStation 4.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:01.000
And on PlayStation 3, Arland Atelier Trilogy.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:07.000
And then it looks like they're doing a re-release of the Smurfs on 3DS.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Thank you, Ubisoft, you really needed that.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:18.000
And also the non-Collector's Edition Dragon Quest Heroes, the World Trees Woe and the Blight Blow.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000
That's one hell of a subtitle.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
That's also PlayStation 4.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
The Legend of Legacy on 3DS.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
That's an exciting game. I kind of want to play that.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Corpse Party Blood Drive, Evening After Edition on Vita.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:41.000
And the Talos Principle, getting a physical release on PlayStation 4.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Oh, wow.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Also, later in the week, they're doing a Goosebumps game, I guess in tying with the movie.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.000
And Nintendo, hey, look, they have a game coming out. Yoshi's Woolly World.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Both the game by itself and the Amiibo bundle.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Those are going to be coming out on Friday.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:04.000
And along with that, they're doing a re-release of Super Mario Bros. U, plus New Super Luigi.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
And it's in a bundle for $60.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000
I saw that at Toys R Us today. I wonder if it wasn't supposed to be on the shelves.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
It may be a re-release. I thought they even had that out already.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
That's not a big deal. That's more of a re-release.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
That's probably not a big deal to break street on that.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Alright, well, traveling over to Japan.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Actually, it's kind of a slow week in Japan. Not a lot coming out.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Geki Jigen Tag Blank Plus Neptune vs. Zombie Gundam comes out on the Vita this week in regular and limited edition.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:41.000
And then over on the 3DS this week, we have, and I lost it here, sorry, but there's actually on PlayStation 4,

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:47.000
there's really nothing this week and nothing on Wii U that I saw anyway.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Yeah, and on the 3DS this week, we have Dragon Ball Z.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:05.000
I'm sorry, no, Dragon Ball, that's different, 7th Dragon 3 code VFD is out on the 3DS in Japan this week.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Next week, though, on the 3DS is Legend of Zelda Triforce Heroes.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:14.000
So, you know, things will be picking up again when the release is there, but pretty slow week in Japan otherwise.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Dark Sakura.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Well, in other news, we have a release on the 13th, in 13th October, is the Talos Principle for PS4 in the UK.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:32.000
On the 16th, we have Back to the Future 30th Anniversary Edition on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Xbox 360.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Dragon Quest Heroes for PS4, Tales of Zestiria for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 3, and WRC 5 on pretty much everything else.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
That's it.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week, Loki.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:55.000
So after reading a little bit about this, I'm kind of excited about Minecraft Story Mode, but they're going to be doing a Let's Play,

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.000
or they're claiming to be the world's largest Let's Play.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:05.000
It's basically going to be held at the ArcLight Cinemarama Dome in Hollywood, California.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:15.000
They're going to be doing that on October 12th, and they're supposed to have, well, it can hold up to 800 guests, and that's what they're trying to do there.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:29.000
They're going to be basically playing through the first episode, Order of the Stone, and it's going to be streamed on the YouTube gaming channel, I guess at 7pm Eastern Time.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
But the voice cast is what kind of has me excited about the game.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:44.000
They have, was it, Patton Oswalt, Ashley Johnson from The Last of Us, Brian Pushing, Billy West, Corey Feldman, and Paul Reubens.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
That's pretty cool.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Yeah, so I actually will have to check that out. That looks pretty awesome.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Which, by the way, I don't watch the show, but Paul Reubens is going to be on Gotham as Penguin's dad, as he was in Batman Returns.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Do they have the, oh yeah, they do have the Penguin on that show. I watch like half the first season and then gave up.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
It's like Batman without Paul Reubens.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:16.000
I would watch it for Paul Reubens. Well, that and I don't like DC very much, but I would watch it with Paul Reubens.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:20.000
You know, so...

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Could he be like a villain in one of these, like, comic book movies? I mean, I know he was in Mystery Men, but...

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000
I always thought he'd make a good Riddler.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.000
I can see that.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
He's probably, he's got to be about 60 years old now.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
So?

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Well, I mean, I'm just saying, you know, he's...

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
He can, he still looks, he still does the full Bewe thing.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000
That's true, that's true.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000
He looks fine.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.000
I want to see the new movie.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Does it matter?

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.000
SSG-100 Matt in chat says the second season is better. Maybe I'll have to check that out. We'll see.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:11:00.000
Alright, moving on to another story here about possibly playing Xbox 360 and original Xbox games through the Xbox One.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
360 games maybe on the PC.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:15.000
This was in an interview with Gizmodo Brazil, where the Xbox head Phil Spencer was talking about that original Xbox games being backward compatible on Xbox One would be great.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000
But he did reiterate that Xbox 360 functionality is the priority right now.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:25.000
He said also he wants Windows 10 users to be able to play the Xbox 360 games on PC.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Quote, it's something I want to do.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:35.000
I would love to have the ability to play Xbox 360 on PC at some point, but it would be great to have support for original Xbox games too.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:44.000
To be clear, he's hinted at the 360 things on PC before, but, you know, the fact he's bringing it up again, I wonder if this is something they may be working on.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Especially, you would think, I mean, you could easily do the streaming anyway, but if you could take the Xbox One out of the equation for some people, that would be really awesome.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:59.000
He says, quote, so yes, I want to do, but have many other things we want to do as well.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.000
People fight with me for not having background music, so we have much work to do.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:08.000
You know, the more and more I hear from Phil Spencer, the more I like his perspective on things.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Because there was another interview I was reading with him this week where he talked about how, you know, they are still trying to regain confidence over the bridges they burned about the Xbox One's initial reveal.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:25.000
That there are still people that are confused and will ask, does the Xbox One play used games?

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.000
Because they don't know because of that mixed message in the very beginning.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:36.000
So, I really like the guy's, like, upfrontness and I feel like he's pretty transparent, especially, like, compared to Nintendo.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000
You know, I kind of feel like he's really upfront about a lot of things. So, I like the guy.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:44.000
He's a good fit on, like, who he was in before.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Let's have him run Nintendo.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
You never know. You never know.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
All right. Well, let's travel.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Or Konami. Let's have him run Konami.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Let's travel back in time when, you know, these heads of companies were just pictures we saw in magazines.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:03.000
We didn't hear interviews on the internet. We just would see them in comics and magazines.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.000
The classic game of the week.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Every week, Dark Soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds one game that she thinks, hey, you un-

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
I just broke my hair clip.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Are you okay?

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Yeah, but it's expensive. Shit.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000
Aww. Well, at least it's just a hair clip and not a finger.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000
All right.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Yeah, but now I don't have anything to pull my substantial hair back with, Rob. Thank you.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
You can just let it all hang down.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Well, if I had a spare hair clip, I'd loan you one, but I don't have a mani tail.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Hold my hair while I throw up.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
Hold my hair back.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
All right. Let's go to the classic game of the week.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:45.000
Dark Soccer's gonna let her hair down and share with you guys what game she thinks you should be playing this week.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Dark Soccer.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Oh, girl.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:53.000
So, the game this week is Castlevania the Adventure.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:00.000
And in Japan it was called Dracula Densetsu, also known as the Legend of Dracula.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:07.000
It was a platformer for the Game Boy that came out in 1989, and it was re-released- well, kind of re-released.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:13.000
It was remade as Castlevania the Adventure Rebirth, which is a WiiWare game for the Wii.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Dan's been actually playing quite a bit of that, so I was really inspired, I should say, by watching him play through this.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000
God, the last two bosses are really easy in this, by the way.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
I actually have the Wii game as well.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Yeah.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:32.000
It's pretty good. A lot of those WiiWare games got really overlooked, but there was some good stuff on there.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:38.000
Well, we were doing like the, what game did this song come from? What game did this one come from? You know.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:47.000
So, anyway, it was said about a century before the original Castlevania, so you play Christopher Belmont, who is an ancestor of Simon.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:53.000
And he goes through all the different stages to beat Dracula and do the stuff that those Belmonts do.

01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:01.000
You can, you start off with three lives, and then when, if you die, then you have to restart the level after your three are gone.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000
You can upgrade your weapons. You can get a chain whip and flame whip.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.000
You can, anytime you get hit, it will downgrade the weapon.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:15.000
There's no stairs in this one, unlike the other Castlevania games.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:22.000
The new one actually has stuff like that, has stairs and things.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000
You also have to beat your primary evil every level.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:34.000
You get crystals, hearts, and crosses of gold, and a point counter, and every 10,000 points you get an extra life.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Each stage also has a time limit, which was funny because Dan was beating death and then he was kind of screwing around at the end of the fight and actually died due to the time limit.

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000
But this was in the new one.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:16:00.000
So anyway, it was called pretty difficult and had really long levels, but it's pretty simple, it's basic, and it goes back to the Castlevania roots, so it was pretty good.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:09.000
IDW also did a series of comic books about Christopher Belmont in 2005. It's called Castlevania the Belmont Legacy.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
And there you go, just simple as that.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.000
There it is, your classic game of the week, Castlevania Adventure.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:49.000
Well we're going to take a quick break, but when we come back there is plenty more Orange Lounge Radio to come, so don't go anywhere.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:58.000
We're going to get to rapid fire news, the FUGU Question of the Week, and your calls when we come back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Live tonight, October the 11th of 2015 with episode number 617 of our show.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:21.000
DarkSakura, Loki, and myself all here in the studio joined by our pal Shane Alinko, who is enabling me during the break, who pointed out,

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Hey Rob, look!

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.000
Heroes power.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Look at Amazon, there's a Toon Link, and you don't have one in your collection.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
And it was for a regular price with free shipping.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.000
Toon Link's only $13.99, available on Prime, and I'm like, it's a Japanese one.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.000
So, it's the same. Alright, fine, bought it.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Rob, why didn't you get me a Sheik while you were at it?

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Because, the addiction is bad enough for myself, I don't need to involve other people as well.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:53.000
I look at that shelf and I think each one of those cost X amount of dollars and I just feel deep shame.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
But I could use a Sheik.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Well I could use a pony, are you going to buy me a pony?

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.000
You can't use a pony.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Sure, everybody could use a pony.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
What you need is a goat for your backyard.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000
To eat all that.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.000
I would love to have a goat, actually. That would be amazing.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000
That would be great.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.000
I wonder if I can find another Amiibo that's regular priced by the time the show's over.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
The thing that I need for my collection?

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000
Yeah.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
I don't really need everything though, like I even said-

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:23.000
I don't either, but you say that, but then look at that and you're like, well now I do, because look how far I've come.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
I know, but I don't really want, like you've been pushing-

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000
You don't want the Fire Emblem.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:29.000
The Fire Emblem people, and I know I'm weird with that.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
Like, because I know a lot of people really love the Fire Emblem.

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000
But I'm like, eh, eh, I don't really need them.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.000
But it's the old school characters that really do it.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Like the old, you know, Nintendo and Super Nintendo.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
I think the reason why I don't really care about Fire Emblem is because of the newer.

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Well technically he's not Marth old school.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000
He's one.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Whatever.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
He's the one you can find right now too in the store.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000
Whatever.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000
I'm not listening to you.

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000
Alright.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Let's move on, we're going to do some rapid fire news.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Loki, why don't you start us off with some quick news here.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Alright, I'll stop making Mario Maker levels.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:09.000
Alright, so Far Cry has a new game coming out.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Far Cry Primal, it's going to be medieval, or not medieval, Stone Age.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
That would have been cool if it was medieval.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Medieval Far Cry.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Yeah, I'd like that even better.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.000
I would get that.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:25.000
Stone Age Far Cry, not sure if I'm really feeling that, but that's what's going to happen.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000
That's what's going to happen.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:35.000
And it's set to release now on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, as well as PC on February 23,

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.000
at least on the console versions, and then March for PC.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.000
They're not bringing it out to last gen platforms though.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000
And I got to be honest, I'm pretty excited usually about Far Cry games.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
Not feeling anything for this one.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
It should have been Blood Dragon 2.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Then I might have given it a shit.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000
But it's not.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Well, let's see here.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:07.000
American Dad is now being turned into a pinball table in Zen Pinball 2's Balls of Glory pack.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:14.000
That's going to be also joining, I guess, other Fox shows, including Family Guy and Bob's Burgers.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000
And yeah, so that would be pretty cool.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:22.000
And then finally, Star Wars Battlefront.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.000
The beta is going to be extended through Tuesday.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.000
A whole day.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:30.000
So now you have until the 13th to play the game.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000
I don't know.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
I played a little bit of Battlefront.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
The old one, kind of liked it.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:41.000
This I'm not hearing is, it basically seems like it's reskinned Battlefield.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:46.000
That's what I'm hearing on Facebook is that it's like, and Twitter, it's just Battlefield with Star Wars.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.000
I'm fine with that.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
But I would think that's what some people want.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
Yeah, I'm fine with that, but I don't know.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:56.000
I don't like the fact that it doesn't really have a single player portion of it, but whatever.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000
Alright.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Well, do you guys remember that interesting Nintendo PlayStation prototype?

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
No, remember when Sony and Nintendo were working together?

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:11.000
And just a couple months ago, some guy found it like in an old storage thing somewhere.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
And he found this and was making YouTubes of it.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
Well, there's an interesting follow up to this.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Is that he's actually going to go public and bring this console out for public viewing.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.000
But what's interesting is where it's going to be.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
It's going to be at a Hong Kong gaming event.

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Retro.HK.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:33.000
But this part's really cool and this must be how the people convinced him to come out.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.000
So, what's going to happen is that the console is going to go to Retro.HK.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Professionals are going to look at it to see what's inside and if any functionality possibly remains with the device.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Because remember, I think he was kind of paranoid to use it because it might short circuit.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.000
I'm soon to remember.

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.000
So, he's going to have some experts actually take a look at it.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:04.000
This feels to me like an episode of Pawn Shop or something where the experts are going to look at it to see if it really is valuable or if it's, you know.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Pawn Stars.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.000
That's it, Pawn Stars.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Which that show was pretty cool.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Yeah, I have to admit.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.000
Now when I see a Pawn Shop in Reno or something, I'm always like,

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.000
You never know what you're going to find.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
You find some gaming stuff at some of those places.

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000
Also completely off topic.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Sure.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
You know how they called the one guy, Chumlee?

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
I forget, but sure.

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:27.000
Well, I was from Tennessee Tuxedo and that always made me like the show, so whatever.

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000
There you go, alright.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Obscure reference.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Alright, moving on.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
Half Life 3.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:39.000
Now that I have your attention, no Half Life 3 was not announced.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:49.000
But Valve, apparently trolling people at this point, there was a file update to Dota 2 called HL3.txt.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:58.000
And HL3.txt is just some miscellaneous codes, but there's some references to virtual reality, procedural generation, and co-op NPCs.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:04.000
But for all we know, this is just Valve being dicks and putting a file in here so that people go crazy.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Or could it be the beginnings of an ARG for Half Life 3?

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Let's be honest though.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
They are fans of that though.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:18.000
I hope it's either something that accidentally got in there, which I doubt it, or like an ARG thing.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:21.000
But if it's just them being dicks, that's kind of fucked up.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
I mean, if you ask me, it's like, okay, listen.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.000
People are fans about your shit and you're going to troll people with this.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
How do you get off on this shit?

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:35.000
I mean, it's like, seriously, people are entrusting you to come out with something really cool.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000
And fuck, you haven't really released anything in quite a while.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:42.000
I don't know, that's kind of a fucked up thing to do.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:46.000
But sure, if it's just a joke, then fuck you.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.000
I don't know though.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:55.000
They seem to be pretty happy with doing those ARGs and everything.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:24:00.000
I mean, they did a couple of really crazy ones with Portal, remember?

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Yeah, there were some pretty cool Portal ARGs, so who knows?

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Or it could just be that there's something else that's HL3 that has nothing to do with Half Life 3.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Like, you know, it isn't that huge.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Really, they should have just named it HL3 underscore not Half Life 3.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Sorry.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Alright, well, moving on to, hey, DDR-related news, if you can believe it.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:31.000
No, there's not a new game or anything, but people playing DDR for charity.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:38.000
And they did this event last year, it was called DDR4LLS, the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:46.000
They're going to do it again October the 17th, starting at 9am Pacific Time, raising some money for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.000
It looks like they're going to be doing a DDR X3 marathon featuring requests.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:55.000
And there'll be folks emceeing the stream, and they say they're going to run it Desert Bus style,

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.000
where donations will keep the stream going longer.

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000
So the more they raise, the longer they're going to dance.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.000
I only have seen this on Facebook, and it doesn't have a short URL.

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:11.000
So you'll have to try to find this DDR charity stream, the 2.015.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:15.000
Or I'm sure Dark Tetsuya, if he's listening, he'll post the link there in the chatroom.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:20.000
So you guys can check that out and make a bookmark and a note to check that out for a good cause.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.000
So there you go, Dark Sakura.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Well, we like our SEGA stuff, and apparently Nintendo knows we like our SEGA stuff.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:38.000
For the 25th anniversary of the SEGA Game Gear in Japan, it looks like there's going to be a Game Gear themed Nintendo 3DS.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:44.000
They don't have a release date on it yet, but they did tease pictures of it on this SEGA Twitter.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:51.000
So, hooray! It looks alright, you know, but I have a Game Gear, so why do I need that?

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Also, there's another game, and I actually own this game.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:59.000
The Revolutionary Girl Utena game that came out on SEGA Saturn.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:07.000
It was pretty fun, and it had the full motion video and some fun stuff and the full intro and everything.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:12.000
But people apparently really, really like it.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:17.000
And so they are starting to do a fan translation.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.000
You can download the translation online.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:27.000
They've done 100% of the script text and some of the graphic interface as well.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000
So I'm kind of curious.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:36.000
I mean, I own this game. I've played through it in Japanese, so who knows?

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:39.000
And also, Stephen Colbert.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:45.000
Now, he is, you know, a pretty decent, I'd say, video game fan.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000
You know, he does stuff for us.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:52.000
We talked last week about the contrast between what he said and what Jimmy Kimmel said about it,

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000
because he had PewDiePie on, and he was actually kind of respectful about it,

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.000
whereas, you know, Jimmy Kimmel had made some pretty controversial statements.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.000
I just love Stephen Colbert. Good lord, that man's great.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
He's pretty cool.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:14.000
So anyway, he is actually going to be playing some of the music on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on October 13th.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:19.000
He's supposed to be playing some of the music from The Legend of Zelda, Symphony of the Goddesses.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:25.000
So I definitely want to tune in and listen to that. So very cool.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:30.000
Yeah, I'm even more impressed with Stephen Colbert for getting something like that on the show.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
That's a heck of a music guest.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:37.000
My friend Dave Letterman had Hatsune Miku, and that was, like, such a big deal.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Like, it's interesting that now we're getting more, like, video game-based guests on shows.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.000
That's really rad, though. I'm looking forward to seeing that.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.000
You know Stephen Colbert has probably played a game or two of Zelda in his time.

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000
So very cool.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000
All right. Well, let's get to the foogle question of the week.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:57.000
You take Facebook and Google Plus and slam them together, and you get foogle.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.000
It's right here.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:12.000
This week for our foogle question of the week, we wanted to expand on what we talked about at the beginning of the show tonight with Guitar Hero's new DLC.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Guitar Hero Live this week announced an interesting new plan for DLC.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Taking a cue from Spotify, you will no longer download DLC to own permanently, but stream songs using currency in-game or with real money to purchase the right to play songs on demand.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.000
It's a little hard to explain, so we linked the official post for people.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000
We wanted to know, what did you guys think about the new method of DLC?

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Do you like the idea of discoverability behind it and the idea that we usually download these songs to play them just a couple times?

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.000
Or is this a dangerous direction for DLC to head?

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:49.000
So over on Facebook, William Murderface said, this is an interesting idea for this genre, but I don't think it could translate well to other genres.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:55.000
The idea that you could have a Pandora of Guitar Hero and earn credits to be able to gain streaming rights is kind of cool.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
And likely will encourage discovery.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:04.000
That being said, translating this onto other genres without testing and adjustment would be a very, very bad idea.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Silent Tom said, I think it would be okay if you just pay a monthly rate for all songs to access songs like Spotify, as long as it's a very long song list.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Just so you know, Silent Tom, I think they are going to have something like that for maybe not for a month, but for a couple days, like for people having parties and stuff.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Justin or Master Claw replied and said, when I was playing a lot of Rock Band, I used to wish that there was a subscription that allowed access to the entire music library for a monthly fee.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:38.000
If you got to choose what songs you can play, it would have been a good move for them, but not a limited selection.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:50.000
I'm still not getting Guitar Hero, I've always preferred Rock Band and I already have hundreds of dollars in songs and instruments and several years of experience invested in the harmonics franchise.

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Of course, I don't have an Xbox One or a Playstation 4, so it's a moot point.

01:29:54.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Fifth Dream says, I had Guitar Hero preordered for a long time. I changed my mind at the last minute and bought Rock Band 4 instead this week, and this was part of the reason.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:12.000
It seems Guitar Hero Live is only having a temporary set of random songs that changes over time, and not a dependable set of songs that you know, like, and will enjoy playing.

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:19.000
There is a reason I don't listen to the radio anymore. I rarely like what other people decide I'm supposed to listen to.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:31.000
I guess I'm that guy or I'm just old, but I got Rock Band 4, the first Rock Band game I've ever played, and spent a lot of money on past DLC to get a set of 60 or so songs I already know I love and had a blast playing them.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:41.000
In other words, this subscription DLC for songs I can't predict I'll even like really sounds like a bad idea and turned me off of the game completely, and I cancelled my Guitar Hero Live preorder.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Wow, that's voting with your wallet, that's for sure.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Andy R. replied and said, a new plan for DLC. Is it new? Based on what they're saying, it sounds similar to the system in Tap Sonic on mobile, which was free, not $90.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Yeah, and I think we talked about that a little bit at the beginning of the show is that this is more of something that you would see in mobile games, but yes, very fair point.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:09.000
Mobile games are also oftentimes free, and this is not free.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:22.000
A couple answers over on Google+, including Rettertainment, who says, I just tried searching around for a price on Guitar Hero TV, including looking at the game's official site, and was unable to find one.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:33.000
This isn't right. For the DLC, we are told the price up front. For Spotify, we're told the price up front. For most any other product available through a legitimate company or person, we're told the price up front.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:36.000
Why am I not able to find the price for GHTV?

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:46.000
That's a very excellent point, and I guess the easy answer to that is, well, I mean, on the day the game releases, the news will be everywhere about how much it costs.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:54.000
But, I totally understand the point that, well, everybody wants you to pre-order the game. Pre-order the bundle. Guarantee that you're going to get a copy of the game.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:59.000
And I think it's fair to say, well, what's the true cost of the game, because you're not being up front about it.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:03.000
So, I think that's a very fair point Rettertainment raises there.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:10.000
ActDeaf, last but not least, says, this idea sounds neat in concept. We'll have to see how it works in practice.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:19.000
I do think it's a great idea, especially since you don't have to actually pay real money to play them just for a few sessions, or just want to see if a song is actually worth buying or not.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:23.000
But hopefully the prices aren't too high, and the in-game currency isn't really hard to obtain.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:33.000
I do also think that this should be a choice. If someone wants to buy and own the song, so you can play it whenever you want, instead of paying each time, you want to play it.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:47.000
And yeah, with a lot of music, I don't think Spotify lets you buy songs, but Apple Music certainly would link you over to iTunes and let you buy the song for $1.29 or whatever it is that you are going to pay for the song.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:52.000
So, yeah. It would be interesting if you could actually do it both ways.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Anyway, some really good answers there. Thank you guys for participating with our FUGL Question of the Week.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:08.000
And if you want to answer for next week, I usually post those on Sunday afternoon over on Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio and Google.com slash plus OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:15.000
We've got some more news. Let's get right back into it. Loki's got to put down Mario Maker and read the next story for us.

01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Alright, so the next thing we've got, let's talk a little bit about HoloLens.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:29.000
I swear, it's kind of like the whole Elder Scrolls Online thing. The more I hear about, the less excited I am.

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:40.000
So now they were talking about the dev kits that are coming out, and unlike the Oculus Rift, where I was like, ooh, I've got to get me a piece of that dev kit, I'm not going to do that with this.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:47.000
That's because the dev kits, first off, start at $3,000. And they're going to be shipping, I guess, the first quarter of 2016.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:52.000
So if you're interested in making something for HoloLens, that's what it's going to cost you.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:34:01.000
And, yeah, I don't know. And I'm still kind of pissed off that they're not really upfront with the field of view on that.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Because all these demonstrations that they showed, they're just kind of, we have a special camera that we're filming everything with.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:17.000
And it's allowing you to see what's going on. It doesn't represent what you can see actually with the device.

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:24.000
And it's like, how long are you going to keep this charade up? I guess until it comes out.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:29.000
I just hope it improves. I hope they are able to make that device something pretty nice.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:38.000
Originally I'm pretty excited about it, but until that field of view is adequate, then I'm not really jumping on board with it.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:43.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, HoloLens will suck for games.

01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:48.000
That's a pretty strong statement from someone who's been following a lot of this VR stuff.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:53.000
And yes, I realize HoloLens is not VR, but it's adjacent in my mind.

01:34:53.000 --> 01:35:02.000
It would be cool for just PC stuff, but yeah, it's just not, I don't know. What they're showing is not exciting.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:07.000
I'm wondering if it's one of those things, and this happens a lot with Kinect and so forth.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:12.000
The first version will not be that great, but the second version, and to be fair, this isn't just Microsoft.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:17.000
Yeah, the first version will be that great, and they'll say, oh, but the second version will do everything that you want it to do.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:21.000
And the second version won't be that great, and then they'll just drop it. Like it never happened.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000
We'll see what happens.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Alright, well this week, some folks were surprised to see that Destiny suddenly appeared on their PlayStation 4.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:37.000
But here's the deal. It's not that you just suddenly were given a free copy of Destiny.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:43.000
Destiny was inserted into your bar like any other game because it's basically Sony advertising to you.

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:46.000
That's what they call featured content.

01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:56.000
And if you didn't turn it off, PlayStation 4 will put things that it thinks you're going to like, which I don't, it sounds like everybody got Destiny.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.000
I don't know. It's going to put it right there on the bar.

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:03.000
Now, remember, if you don't like this stuff, you can turn it off.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:09.000
In the settings menu, you go to system, automatic downloads, and uncheck the box that says featured content.

01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:13.000
So this kind of stuff will not happen in the future if that pissed you off this week.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Or maybe you liked it. I don't know.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
It didn't piss me off, but it's just like, what the fuck is this?

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:20.000
You know, I hope I didn't download anything to go along with it.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:21.000
Right.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Because, you know, it said featured content. Does that mean it downloaded that shit to my fucking system?

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Isn't it just a link to the store?

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:29.000
I think it's just a link.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000
Yeah, because I turned that off a long time ago.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Well, because I clicked on it and I'm like, what is this? Are they offering this for free or something? Is this like a demo? What the fuck is this?

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
And then I was like, oh, link to buy it. Nope.

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:44.000
So a lot of people were surprised at kind of the positioning of that this week. I think it's the first time.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:53.000
Alan Alchemy in chat says, is this like when U2 forced their album onto people's iPhones and everyone was like, get your geriatric Irish bullshit off my shit. What the fuck?

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Hey now, U2's an okay band.

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:07.000
No, because that was different. The U2 thing actually downloaded that album completely, which didn't happen.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:18.000
With Destiny. The whole Destiny game was not downloaded and it certainly wasn't free. That was just a, it was more of a clever ad, I suppose, for lack of a better term.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
All right, let's move on. Dark Sakura.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:31.000
Well, for people who have been waiting for this, there is kind of sorta support for Cortana in Xbox One.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:41.000
It's not actually, the voice assistant isn't supposed to be available until 2016. However, some people have figured out how to kinda get her working.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:50.000
You can go into the settings menu and going up and mashing the A button multiple times.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:57.000
It doesn't give you the full number of commands, but it gives you some of them, like accessing your calendar.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:12.000
It's really just a minor thing, but it's there. So they've got the beginning hints of it installed, so I guess that's a pretty good thing if you're interested in stuff like that.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:16.000
Loki.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:24.000
I'm not interested in that thing. Like I said, I have that on my Windows 10 PC or laptop and it doesn't do anything.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:31.000
I called Siri, Cortana, just to see what would happen. It was pretty funny. I got a thing that said, haha, very funny, but not funny.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.000
Not funny. Note to self, murder you in your sleep.

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:42.000
No, I'm actually kinda curious. Now hold on. Hey, Cortana, tell me something.

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:45.000
Hello.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.000
Okay, she answered to it. Never mind.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Ah, Siri.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Oh, Siri. Why so Siri-ous? Haha.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:06.000
So apparently according to the publisher of Harvest Moon, Natsume, they're saying that Game Boy games are not being converted to Virtual Console.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:22.000
There, Nintendo has gone and moved beyond that system because this was in regards to someone inquiring about one of their older games, Tailgater, whether that was going to be coming to Virtual Console, and they said, sorry, not going to happen.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:30.000
So if you're looking for some Game Boy games that didn't quite make it there, you're going to have to look to buy a Game Boy.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Why would you just stop that? I mean, were they not selling well at all or something? Like, I just, I don't understand where all the money...

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.000
I don't either, because if...

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.000
...cost is for this stuff. It doesn't make sense.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Yeah, seriously, because it's an emulator. Last I checked, emulators ran that game, so...

01:39:51.000 --> 01:40:01.000
I mean, I know they do this, they do a manual, and they have to put together on the store, but I would seriously think it would be, like, one person's job.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:12.000
And are they not even making that much money to pay that one person? I mean, I don't know. Maybe I'm a little ignorant to this, but it just seems like the cost should not be that big for Virtual Console. It doesn't make sense at all.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:16.000
And you're making just tons of money off of this stuff. I mean, I don't know.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.000
Bobby Blackwolf...

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Or put the cost... Here's an idea. If the publisher wants to go through all that process and make those, why can't you let the publisher do that?

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Good point. And Bobby Blackwolf in chat has a counterpoint here. I can answer your question, Skye, with one acronym, ESRB. That costs a lot to get that rating, and they have to get Virtual Console games rated by the ESRB.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:51.000
A fair point that I didn't consider is that they do get all those games rated, and because back in the day, the ESRB didn't exist for most of these games, so they can't, you know, they have to go back and, I guess, get them re-rated.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:59.000
Well, technically, do they have to? Because you can release an unrelated movie, but I guess there's probably some type of agreement.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Well, you have to, because it's their company policy not to release NR Games.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:07.000
But, okay, but you still bring up a point. What if Nintendo didn't pay for this, but the publishers did?

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:08.000
Exactly.

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:21.000
Hmm. Interesting, though. S2100Matt says, it's just like movie ratings. Sometimes studios fight hard to get an under R rating. Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure. Interesting.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Well, still, I mean, I would think they're making, but I guess obscure Game Boy games may not sell a whole lot of copies, so maybe that's why they decide not to do it.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Maybe they should discount, you know, certain things like that, you know, when they're doing ratings for these old-ass games. I don't know.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Yeah, but then are they really going to get that money back? I don't know. Because, you know, then they're making less money off each sale, so they really get the money back.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
No, I meant the ESRB should charge less.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Oh, well, but the ESRB, and Bobby Blackwell says the ESRB needs their money to put on E3, and especially as E3 is getting less and less relevant. I just added that part.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Anyway, Jim Sallee in chat over at live.vognetware.com. So good to hear from him. Jim Sallee says, I can rate all virtual console games right now. They suck.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.000
Hey, now. Earthbound doesn't suck.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Is that S for suck?

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Rated S for suck.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Alright. Let's see. Somebody brought up Sonic earlier. It was one of the Frugal Question of the Week comments.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:43.000
Well, Sonic actually had a Wii U exclusive version, Sonic Lost World. Well, guess what? It is no longer Wii U exclusive, but it didn't hop over to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:56.000
It's going to Steam. That's right. November 2nd, we'll see the Steam release of Sega Sonic Lost World. The game apparently will run at 60 frames a second with full PC gamepad support.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Also, it's going to come with a free copy of Sonic Racing Transformed, because why not? They just give that game away now. I think, didn't they do that in a Humble Bundle anyway?

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:18.000
But anyway, the game launches on Steam on November 2nd. It will be 20 pounds. I'm assuming that is also like $19.99 in dollars here locally, but we'll see when it actually hits Steam.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:28.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetware.com, use the passphrase, face.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Jim Sally in chat says, more like Sonic Suck World. Tiger Claw says, I have Sonic Lost World, haven't yet got to play it, the Wii U version.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Well, you better play it or you might end up falling in that Steam pit where you end up buying a game just because you can.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:51.000
Did me saying the words Humble Bundle cause you to go to the site, Loki, to see if you needed to drop more money on something?

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:58.000
No, I just wanted to see what the new games were in 15 that they were just... I didn't buy it because I think I have most of these already.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Yeah, I have a lot of the games in that pack. I mean, yay, it's for charity and all that, but yeah, I don't know if I could...

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:13.000
That's also why I'm not jumping on the Humble Monthly, because it's like, dude, I probably have most of those.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Dungeon Buster in chat, speaking of Sonic, says the Sonic Boom cartoon series was also renewed for a second season.

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Well, how about that?

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.000
That just proves kids will watch anything.

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Alright, let's get to the mailbag. Every week, Dark Sakura dives into the mailbag headfirst and pulls out emails that she thinks are rad and worth sharing, if there are any.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:39.000
I thought there was at least one in there. I don't know, Dark Sakura, do we have an email tonight to read?

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.000
There's one.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:46.000
Just one. Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to fill up the mailbox for a future week.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:49.000
Hello, LR, which means this is from YYR.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Last week, there was a brief discussion on the possibility of Japanese shoot-'em-up or SHMUP developer CAVE turning to crowdfunding to bring more games to Steam and or PS4, or perhaps even developing something new, but not for cheap.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:09.000
SHMUPs, unfortunately, with regard to gameplay depth, do not look like much to the average or casual player.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:15.000
But in reality, it takes cat-like reflexes, nerves of steel- by the way, cat-like, not my cat.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Anyway, um, nerves of steel and the ability to discern and memorize patterns and several dozen hours to be able to actually complete a well-designed SHMUP in one credit, the way it was meant to be played.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:33.000
To be able to design a game of this sort takes many, many times longer and a lot of experience.

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:42.000
Anyone can throw together a shooting game with random enemy placement to actually make a game of this type that plays well as something not just anyone can do.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:57.000
The music is usually created by composers outside the company, the sound effects are created to perfectly match the action, and the graphics usually consist of hand-drawn, hand-animated sprites from the player characters all the way down to the tiniest popcorn enemies.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:01.000
All of this takes a ton of work and, therefore, money.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:11.000
So this is why I don't believe three million dollars is an unreasonable amount of money to conceive, design, develop, and release an original SHMUP for consoles.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Unfortunately, this genre is not as popular as it once was, even in Japan, so CAVE has had some money troubles over the last couple of years.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:23.000
Therefore, crowdfunding might be the only way we'll ever see another original game from them.

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:33.000
If you enjoy this sort of game, even a little, I'd encourage you to toss a few bucks their way, and a few bucks their way if they ask for it. I know I will.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
Keep on shooting, AaronYYR.

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:41.000
Okay. We made the point. That's totally what I was, you know, thinking.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:45.000
No, it's a fair point. You know, games aren't cheap to make, that's for sure.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:56.000
You know, I guess it's tricky though, because I do feel like some people have made some pretty competent shooters on a lower budget, just being a team of like one or two people.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:03.000
But I also understand there's a difference, you know, especially the bullet hell SHMUP stuff that really goes to the cult status.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:08.000
Yeah, it definitely has all those things that you're talking about, you know, and especially things like composers and so forth.

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:16.000
And hey, voice actors might get really expensive here pretty soon, if, you know, that's even a possibility with what DarkestHacker was talking about earlier.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:26.000
So, you know, yeah, games aren't free to make for big companies that, you know, want to pay their people so they can, you know, feed their families and stuff.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:33.000
So, makes sense. So yeah, if you enjoy that genre and want to see a new game, I can see where the crowdfunding comes in.

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:42.000
Just hopefully, you know, the slippery slope with crowdfunding, just because, you know, it's the same company with the same reputation, doesn't mean it's necessarily going to be good.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:48.000
And that's what we're hearing with Mighty No. 9, some people not into it based off the demo, like a little let down.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:53.000
I'm going to say this, slippery slope arguments are by their nature fallacious.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:48:02.000
I would say, look, the only way that we're going to know if it's going to be successful or not for them to just do it.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:09.000
And if it opens, yeah, someone's always going to be out there to take advantage of an idea or try to cash in on it.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:19.000
But you have to also think that if this is the only way to get it out, if there's no other possible way, then they should, we should encourage them.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:27.000
Yeah, but in Ifune's Mighty No. 9, I mean, I don't think he was ever out to rip anybody off or anything, but maybe learned a lot of hard lessons along the way.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:34.000
And I think it has caused people who donated to that game, even though it's not, the game isn't even out yet, for one, it's not a shooter.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:42.000
I feel like you're seeing this on Facebook and Twitter, you can already feel the repercussions that the game being delivered is not what people expected.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.000
And that's going to have an impact on all video game Kickstarters.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:49.000
It, I think it is and it will and won't be.

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:56.000
It's just a matter of, I mean, for example, how many games have you bought that just didn't turn out to be what you thought they'd be?

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
I bought one this week.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Okay, so this really isn't anything that different, you know.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:06.000
True.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:11.000
Yeah, and there were always beta releases out for the game for Mighty No. 9.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:15.000
People had ideas of what they were getting into if they had the beta access.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:25.000
And then for the other releases coming out, I mean, if you had just gone out and found it on the shelf and bought it, would it have been what you thought it was going to be?

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
There's really no difference.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:30.000
I'm going to our chat over at live.vog.network.com.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.000
Dungeonbuster says, Caves shmups are pretty legendary production-wise.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:37.000
They lavish a ton of art, sound, and action in their game.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.000
And bullets.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
So many bullets.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:46.000
Sg100matt says, I just hope all Kickstarters and people thinking of video game crowdfunding learn from these mistakes.

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:47.000
That's all I ask.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.000
I was happy with Espa-galuda that I could never quite say right.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
Espa-galuda?

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:53.000
Espa-galuda.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:54.000
Espa-galuda.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:55.000
Espa-galuda.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.000
I played a crap ton of Espa-galuda.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.000
Beluga Whale 2.

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
I can't say it.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Alright.

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:08.000
If you have some further comments on this or what have you, you can always email us.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:12.000
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:13.000
And that's it for emails.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.000
We didn't get a lot this week.

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:17.000
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com if you want to send us another one.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:23.000
Every week we get angsty on the show because reasons.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:57.000
A big FU to people who expect that if you see two characters in a movie or book or anything,

01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:02.000
that the moment that they show any kind of real affection for each other, it means they're fucking.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:03.000
No.

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
It doesn't mean they're fucking.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
It means they have a close relationship.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
Why ruin it?

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.000
The end.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:13.000
You can do whatever you want with your head cannon.

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:19.000
But it says a pretty awful thing about society to say.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Alright, Loki.

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Effie to bad drivers.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:26.000
Especially people that, okay, you maybe missed your turn or something like that.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:30.000
Don't fucking cut over all the lanes to make your turn.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:34.000
Oh shit, I'm going in the off-ramp and I'm in the rightmost lane.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Let me cut across all those lanes to get out of the off-ramp.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
I hate you people.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:43.000
And I was behind all you people today.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
You suck.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Alright Shane, I have to hear this FU that you have tonight.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Okay, so FU to whatever head problems I'm having right now because today we went out toy hunting

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:00.000
and I bought some donuts and we had some donuts but I had two left over.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:04.000
I had a maple one and this weird mint Oreo one.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
Both looked really good.

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:14.000
So when I got back, I got out of the car and I got dizzy and oops, they fell all over the driveway.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
I was so sad.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
You dropped the donuts.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Yes, I really wanted the maple one and I was just kind of interested in the mint one.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Well, you know what this means.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
You have to go back and get more donuts.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.000
Where was this at?

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
Java time over Maguna.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
I'm gonna have to go.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
They have all sorts of crazy donuts.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:39.000
The Oreo one looked like, I just gained a pound looking at it.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Well, I could eat half a donut.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
You could lick some of it off of the driveway.

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
I kind of wanted to do that.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:49.000
I wanted to be like, Shane, I just want to do this bat with the rest of the donuts.

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:52.000
Shane, we should go and I'd have half a donut.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
We could go tomorrow.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:57.000
Okay, I may have to meet someone at lunch but let's go tomorrow.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Okay.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:52:59.000
We'll have breakfast of donuts.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Okay.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Alright.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
Sorry, Rob.

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
I didn't even finish.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:06.000
Sorry, G.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
So FU to Rob for turning off the music before I was done.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
I didn't even give mine yet but go ahead.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Yeah, but you still turned the music off.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
And FU to Toys R Us for not getting their act together

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:17.000
and getting me the Power Ranger toys I deserve

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:20.000
because one of the stores had them one day

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:23.000
and I missed out and got two instead of all five

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
and now nobody's getting them

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:31.000
and I just want to be very mad and yell at them.

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:32.000
Alright.

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
My FU of the Week goes to Shane for being an enabler.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Heroes Power.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Both with donuts and amiibo.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Heroes Power.

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Not something you can control.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:42.000
That's really it.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.000
Things are awesome otherwise.

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
I guess FU to my voice this morning

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
because I did Rocky last night and I actually sound okay now

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:50.000
because I had some hot coffee and all that.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
But yeah, boy oh boy.

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:53.000
But it was a great show.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
I can't say anything FU about that

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:58.000
and I'm very excited about Sinister Creature Con here in Sacramento

01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.000
here locally if you're a local listener.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
I will be there at Sinister Creature Con this weekend

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
in Sacramento at Scottish Rite

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:07.000
and also hosting Rocky Horror again on Halloween.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
So there's my cheap plug.

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.000
FU to cheap plug.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Steal with it.

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Alright.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Let's get to a couple more stories here

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:18.000
before we take your calls at 1877 Game OLR

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:19.000
or username on Skype.

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:22.000
All one word.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:25.000
First we'll go over to Loki.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Yes, since we were talking about Mario Maker a little bit.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:34.000
There has been an individual that remade all of the e-reader levels

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
from the Game Boy Advance version of the game

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
and you can check them out now.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:42.000
So these are all the levels from Super Mario Advance 4

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:46.000
and they're available to check out.

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:51.000
There's a Reddit post in the Wii U thread

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:54.000
that's got a Super Mario 3 e-card.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
It's all levels redone.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.000
And you can download or jot down all the different codes

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:03.000
to download those levels to play them.

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:04.000
That's pretty cool.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:05.000
I have to be honest.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
I totally forgot about the e-reader levels

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:10.000
until this story and I was like, oh yeah.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:13.000
I've seen a lot of people remaking Super Mario Land levels too

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
even though they can't really

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
because there was different mechanics in Super Mario Land

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:21.000
but it's interesting to see people doing that I think.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
All right.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Well, speaking of Mario Maker,

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:30.000
is the creator mad at you for all the hard levels

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
that you're making in Mario Maker?

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:33.000
I hope so.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Lead producer Takashi Tezuka has stated some opinions in Edge Magazine

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:41.000
saying, quote,

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
There is a tendency for the courses people make

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:46.000
to be a little harder than they think they are.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
The creator already knows the design,

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:51.000
where they've placed their traps, and the best route to take.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:54.000
So it would generally be easier for them to play through

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
than someone trying it for the first time.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:59.000
As a result, the course ends up being more difficult

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
than the creator meant it to be.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
You know, I think that's exactly what happened with my Bowser Man level.

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:06.000
I didn't set out for it to be so hard

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:10.000
but because I designed it, I kind of knew the easy way through it

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:14.000
and I got poop drawn on my level by Japanese players because of it.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:15.000
So I guess I learned my lesson.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Yeah, but we learned it from you

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
because you made Super Mario Brothers 2

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
which we call the lost levels here.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
We learned it from you!

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Yeah, that's right. We learned it from you, Japan,

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:26.000
so stop pooping on my levels.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
Like, actually pooping on my levels.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:33.000
I just heard the tale end when you were looking at it.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Oh, look! A Japanese comment!

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
It's poop!

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Poop is universal, Rob.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
Should I report that comment or should I favorite it?

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
You should favorite it.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:44.000
I'm going to favorite it.

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:45.000
Alright.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.000
That would be great.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
Try with more poop.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:51.000
Like, we can have a conversation in poop.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:56.000
Anyway, somebody's listening to OLR for the first time

01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:00.000
going, what the fuck podcast did I subscribe to?

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.000
I'm probably going to have some splainin' to do at work.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:06.000
It's like pissing into an ocean of piss.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Oh, I'm sorry. That's right.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:10.000
You said you might have friends listening tonight.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Hi, Travis!

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Whoops!

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:13.000
Hi, Travis.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:14.000
Alright.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
Anyhow, oh, I do want to point out, though,

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Tezuka did not finish his thought with that,

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
so let's hear the other half, because it's important.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:23.000
I've been watching lots of different courses on YouTube.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:26.000
It was quite a surprise how much fun it was to watch the videos

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
without even playing myself.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:31.000
There are so many intriguing and inventive courses,

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:34.000
like one which you couldn't beat if you picked up a mushroom.

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.000
It's been a huge motivation for us developers to do better.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
That's so amazing that you watch videos on YouTube

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
of other people playing levels,

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:45.000
and you thought that was amazing and inspired people to play the game.

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Oh, my God!

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:50.000
You mean that there's some merit to these fucking levels?

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:51.000
You fucking idiot!

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.000
You fuck, fuck, fucking idiots!

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
And I know it's not you in particular,

01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:01.000
but fuck the people that are in the fucking higher-up chain of Nintendo for...

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:02.000
Yeah.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Dark Sakura, sigh all you want,

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
but that was a pretty fucking good zing.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:07.000
That was.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
You're going to need some ointment for that burn.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
I hope you know that, you know,

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
Nintendo's making money off of that ad revenue.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Thanks a lot, you know.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:19.000
I love it.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.000
Some folks in chat over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Orange Wright says,

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:28.000
You mean it would be beneficial to let people make YouTube videos of your games?

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:29.000
Necessary100Matt says,

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:30.000
Keep going, Loki.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:34.000
And Act F has sounded the Loki O.L.R. rant alarm.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.000
There you go.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
Hey, you know what?

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
I'm sorry if you blew your eardrums out,

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
but the man has a very good point,

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:46.000
and that was a good time to bring that up, so...

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
It's just a little hypocritical of them.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:51.000
I mean, to be honest, this is the developer.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:52.000
It's not him personally.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
No, it's not him. It's not him.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
And let's be honest, this guy,

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:59.000
he's probably a little bit more open-minded to everything than some of the management.

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:02.000
But seriously, the management needs to kind of get on board with that.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:03.000
That's ridiculous.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:04.000
That's a really good call-out.

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
I'm surprised more journalists didn't pick up on that.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:07.000
All right.

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
Anyhow, that's it.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:12.000
That actually brings us to our last story, appropriately.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
But we are going to open up the Skype line.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:17.000
We're actually to the last part of the show a little early tonight.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:18.000
We're going in pretty quick.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:19.000
We're starting late, too.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:20.000
Yeah, we started late, too,

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
because Bobby had his 500th episode, so it's worse.

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Because you didn't let me talk about Power Rangers for an hour.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Well, here's your chance.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:27.000
We're waiting for a call, so...

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
You remember when we were going to do a podcast about Mass Effect,

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
and then that, like, didn't happen?

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
Yeah, I remember the pilot episode I actually guested on,

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:34.000
and I was like, wow.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:35.000
It was because Rob was so bad on it.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:36.000
He was so bad on it.

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:37.000
You guys really...

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:40.000
You know, and some people I knew were like,

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
how can you do a podcast about a game

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:45.000
that is essentially going to be dormant for like five years?

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:46.000
Don't judge us.

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:49.000
But after doing that first episode, I was like, wow.

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:52.000
You could make a podcast out of this pretty regularly,

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:53.000
and then you didn't.

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:56.000
Okay, but let's talk about something else real quick.

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:57.000
Where is that episode?

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Can we put it up somewhere so people can hear it?

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
I think I have it somewhere on my computer.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:02.000
I don't think I have it.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
I found our show role from it, though.

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:05.000
That's funny.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
Can we do, like, a long-lost Mass Effect?

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:08.000
But what the hell was the show called?

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:09.000
I forget.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:10.000
We called it.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:11.000
This is the best podcast on the Citadel.

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:12.000
Oh, we just had the best podcast on the Citadel.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
My favorite podcast on the Citadel.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
And I did the Corian voice, remember?

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:19.000
I had the filter for the Corian voice.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:20.000
So I actually have news.

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:21.000
What?

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Because I forgot to say this earlier.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:28.000
The super awesome pre-orders for Super Beat Zonic

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:31.000
went up a couple days ago,

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:34.000
and that is made by the people that make DJ Max,

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:37.000
since DJ Max is now something that doesn't exist anymore.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
Was that that livestream you were watching the other night?

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:42.000
Yeah, they livestreamed it so we could kind of see what it's about,

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:47.000
even though it still doesn't have, like, a release date beyond fall of this year.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:50.000
But they put up two versions beyond the regular.

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:54.000
There's one that's $50 called the exclusive limited edition.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
It comes with the game and the soundtrack.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:00.000
And there's one that's $100 that comes with the game,

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:05.000
the soundtrack, and then the soundtrack on vinyl and a very fancy box.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:08.000
And the vinyl, it's two vinyls.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:11.000
And there's only 450 of those, 500 of the other.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:16.000
And there's also a golden ticket that they're putting into two of them.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:20.000
And if you get one of those tickets, you get the Corian limited edition,

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:23.000
which I'm trying to pull up right now, because this is a Corian game

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
because it's DJ Max people.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:28.000
The Corian limited edition makes all of us cry

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:31.000
because we don't get these cool things.

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
The Corian limited edition.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:37.000
You get the game in a huge box.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:42.000
You get either a blue Vita that we're getting from GameStop

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
or an orange one, it looks like.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
They said red, but it looks orange.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:50.000
The soundtrack, no vinyl, all these little postcard things.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:53.000
It looks like a memory card as well, and it's very pretty.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:57.000
And I hope I get one of those golden tickets.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:00.000
Act Efton Chat says, do you get to go to the Willy Wonka factory with that golden ticket?

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
I wouldn't want to.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:05.000
All the kids died. Well, they didn't die, they cartoon died.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
I never saw that movie, so I just don't want to go there.

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
I read the book when I was a kid.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
The book was pretty good. I've read the book after that too.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:15.000
I just know the Futurama version of it.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:21.000
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
I thought there were all these people that wanted to call in tonight,

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
and it's dead on the line tonight.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:30.000
This is the part where I go, is the phone line working?

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:33.000
And so I actually put in the number to call to make sure.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Oh, we have a call coming in.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
Is that you calling us?

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
No, it's not me. It says the name of the caller, so I'm going to get to it right now.

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Hey, this is Act Eft.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:46.000
It's clearly Kirby. I'm looking at the picture.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:49.000
Yeah, it's Act Eft wearing a Kirby disguise.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
Oh.

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Kirby swallowed Act Eft and now has Act Eft's voice and powers.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
We'll leave it to your imagination.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Act Eft, what are your powers?

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Buying an amiibo, speaking Spanish, playing taiko, no tatsujin.

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
Yeah, all that stuff.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:15.000
His specialty is bartering for amiibo at the market in Spanish.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Yeah.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
There you go. I'm combining all those things into one thing.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
What's on your mind tonight, my friend?

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:23.000
Well, first, welcome to the amiibo club.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
Gee.

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:29.000
I swear, somebody's going to produce the audio clip of me a year ago going,

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:35.000
Fuck amiibo, fuck me, if I ever get into that amiibo thing, I want you to hit me upside the head with a baseball bat,

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
or whatever I probably said a year ago, and now here I am.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
It took me longer than you.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:46.000
Well, now that I can walk into a store and there's a selection, it doesn't seem so irritating.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
You all right?

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
I was going to say something.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:51.000
What were you going to say? What?

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:54.000
I was going to say, but how many times have you walked into a store and found something,

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:57.000
versus me looking for Power Rangers, texting, like, do you need this one?

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
You know what? That's okay.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:04.000
If Shane wants to be my personal shopping assistant, I'm actually okay with that.

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
That would be so fun to do.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:10.000
He may think it's his hero's power, but I'm making him do all the legwork for me.

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
Who's really better than me?

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
It's not legwork for you when I'm looking for myself.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:17.000
And then, oh, no Power Rangers toys, let me look at the amiibos.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:20.000
Okay, let me spread the amiibo around.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:24.000
Now, he didn't talk about this on the show, but since we're stretching for time tonight,

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:27.000
because we didn't fill three hours, I will point this out.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:32.000
Shane also did me a favor, because I did Rocky Horror this weekend,

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:38.000
and one of my cast members actually said, I'm looking for the Brad pop doll.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:41.000
You know those pop doll things? I have some of them here in studio,

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:45.000
but they're the little pop culture things. They have the big heads and all that.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:51.000
Well, they put out a Rocky Horror set, and this girl on cast, she's a big black girl,

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:52.000
and she's amazing.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Is it from Monet?

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:54.000
It's Monet, yeah.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:05:01.000
And she played Brad, which is, if you picture it, is kind of humorous, but she sold it.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:05.000
She's one of my favorite Brad's I've ever seen in the role.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:09.000
So anyway, she wanted a Brad pop figure, and she couldn't find it.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
They had a bunch of them at Toys R Us.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:15.000
And that's why I said, wait a minute, Shane texted me a picture the other day.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:20.000
He saw those figures in a Toys R Us, and I thought it was very nice that Shane saw something Rocky Horror,

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:24.000
and actually acknowledged it and sent it to me, because usually he's embarrassed on my behalf.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:25.000
It had some GameStop.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:30.000
But I said, Shane, hey, while you're out on your next toy run, I'm looking for this pop doll.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:35.000
If you find it, let me know. First store he goes to, he's like, I got you that Brad doll.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:40.000
And I gave it to her last night, and she was so, so, so happy. So there you go.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:41.000
Hooray, story.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:44.000
There you go. Anyway.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:48.000
So where were we? Did we ever get the question you were going to ask here?

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
I don't even remember my question.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
He was just rubbing it in that you buy amiibos.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
Oh yeah, that's right.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:06:00.000
I was going to talk about this recent amiibo restock. It was pretty, pretty good.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
It's how it should always be, right?

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:08.000
Doesn't it seem, though, I mean, not to be that jaded gamer, but oh fucking well,

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:12.000
I guess I'm doing, I'm filling that role tonight.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Doesn't Nintendo always fucking do this?

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:21.000
The first year is a shit show for trying to get the merchandise, like the Nintendo Wii itself,

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:26.000
and then we're a year out, and oh, it's like there was never a problem in the first place.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:31.000
I mean, granted, you can't get every figure you want, but it's a lot more reasonable now

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:35.000
than it was when these figures first came out. You know what I mean?

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:39.000
Like, if you put a little effort into it, you can get just about anything you want,

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:43.000
save some of the original pressings from a while ago, you know what I mean?

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Or the ones you thought were going to be around for forever and somehow aren't anymore, Samus and Link.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:50.000
Yeah, but Samus and Link weren't hard to find in the beginning.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
No, they weren't, and now it's like...

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:53.000
Oops.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:54.000
Yeah.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:57.000
It's curious that Kirby is now one of the rarest ones to find.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Yep.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:02.000
You cannot find a Kirby right now, at least for a retail price.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:06.000
But they'll probably restock, you know, early next year. Amiibo aren't going to go away anytime soon,

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
and Smash Brothers is by far the biggest line.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:11.000
The only thing is that I just worry Nintendo's like,

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:15.000
oh, you know, we're not always going to have these out, we're going to offer cards instead.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:19.000
Well, if they can just do what they did this time with restocks and just do that for all of them,

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:23.000
like, on a cycle, that would be fine too. I don't see a problem with that.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
I don't want cards. I want the figures.

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:26.000
I don't want cards either.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:32.000
I mean, I get that the cards are a good way for people that want the functionality to be able to have,

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:33.000
which is fine and dandy, but...

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:37.000
I didn't even have a game that worked with Amiibo until just recently, but I've had Amiibo for forever, so...

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:40.000
Do they work in Woolly World? I mean, I know the Yoshi's do.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:41.000
Yeah, they unlock costumes.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:46.000
I need to try my cards, because I have the card reader for my DS.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:50.000
But they work, the Yoshi gets costumes.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Oh, this is like Mario Maker.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
Some of them are cute, some of them are frightening.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:54.000
Yeah.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:59.000
I need to still go back to Mario Kart 8, because now I have all these Amiibo I didn't have before,

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:03.000
and go unlock all the costumes I have yet to do. Anyway...

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:09.000
Yeah, unlocking all the Amiibo costumes on Super Mario Maker, especially with all the ones I have,

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
it was, like, kind of tedious.

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
Because, yeah, but...

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:21.000
But, even though with the restock, hopefully, yeah, at least it's not gonna be hard to find,

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:27.000
or at least some of the really hard to find will be easier.

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:33.000
Hopefully it will get better, but we don't know. Hopefully it will, but who knows?

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:36.000
Or more games that come out centered around those hard-to-find ones,

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:43.000
like with the supposed villager restock coming on the 8th of next month in time for the Animal Crossing Wii U game.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:44.000
Yeah.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:50.000
Or, like, maybe the Fire Emblem 4 will all come back when the Fates game comes out next year.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:54.000
I'm really curious to see, though, how this translates going into NX,

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
because this has been so huge for Nintendo.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:57.000
They'll use it, for sure.

02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:03.000
They'll have Amiibo, but what scary thing are they gonna think of next for this, you know?

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:06.000
As long as, I mean, at least the figures...

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:10.000
$12 is really not a lot of money for those figures, when you think about it.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:11.000
I don't think so, anyway.

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:14.000
I mean, that, okay, you remember that little, today at Toys R Us,

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:17.000
they had that little 8-bit pillow that was, like, the link sprite?

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:18.000
It was super cute, yeah.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:22.000
And, yeah, it looks cute, but then up close, I was like, it's a tiny pillow,

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
and you kind of squeeze it, and it's not very soft.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:28.000
It's kind of a, I don't know what the hell it is, just something that would sit on a bookshelf or something.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
You know, it was $16.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:31.000
Yeah.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:34.000
And I kind of think Amiibo are a better value than that pillow.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:37.000
It's one of those World of Nintendo ones, right?

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:38.000
Yeah, it was.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Yeah, I'm kind of surprised there's, like, a following for those,

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:47.000
because some of them are really hard to find.

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
Have you seen the Metroid one, the actual Metroid one?

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Yes, that you can't find anywhere now.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
Yeah, those are really hard to find.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
Yeah, that Metroid was so cute.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:59.000
I saw it once, I didn't think anything of it, and now I've never seen it again.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
Brad from Pod Culture says,

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:05.000
I want the Power A Amiibo N-level display, but 30 bucks?

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.000
Is that the one I own?

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:07.000
That's the one, yeah.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
I gotta say, I like that thing a lot, though.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:10.000
It is cool.

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:11.000
It is really cute.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:12.000
I wish they'd make more things like it.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:13.000
I need more.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:16.000
I saw at Best Buy, they have warp pipes now that you can buy.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:17.000
What?

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Yeah, you can put warp pipes on, I'm not sure you can put them on those,

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
but you can place them and put the Amiibo in them.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
Okay, you might need to go to Best Buy for me tomorrow.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
I probably was going to go the best way.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:28.000
See what I mean?

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:32.000
There's supposed to be more Amiibo displays like that one.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:36.000
There's one for Zelda, and I think there's one for Kirby.

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:41.000
I remember seeing them, or at least reported on when it was the 3 this year.

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:48.000
So yeah, there's going to be more of them, but they haven't been released other than the Mario one.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:52.000
Yeah, I don't know if you've seen the shelf that I'm now keeping my Amiibo on.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:56.000
I had to switch out from a table, now it's a shelf, and it's kind of like a weak shelf.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:02.000
It's like one of these really pick up, I need to get a legit better way to display my Amiibo, and it's kind of, I don't know.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
You think you have problems?

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:08.000
Alan has to be rolling his eyes to the back of his head at this whole thing.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:09.000
I can hear it.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:17.000
Like I was saying, if you have problems, you should ask me, because I don't even have a really big space to handle all my Amiibo.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:22.000
I have them all over my room, so yeah.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:27.000
Brad from Pod Culture and Chat says, can anyone find a Mega Man Amiibo for me?

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
I'm not paying scalper prices.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:38.000
I think Amazon has Mega Man for a decent price, if you don't care if it's American or Japanese.

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:48.000
I see Mega Man in the wild occasionally still, so it might be a little hard to find, but I'll keep an eye out.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:52.000
Alright, you gotta connect with Shane on Twitter, Brad.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:55.000
I wanted one until I scanned it in, and then I'm done, so I don't need one.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:58.000
Aw, it's so cute. That was my second Amiibo I've ever had.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:03.000
And by the way, in Mario Maker, don't forget to push up, because the sprites all do different things when you push up.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:04.000
I didn't realize that until-

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:05.000
Up and down.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:06.000
Oh, and down?

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Yeah, and down as well.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:10.000
They do squatty things sometimes, depending on what it is.

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:11.000
Alright.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:18.000
SJ100Matt in Chat says, if you have problems, Rob, I feel bad for you, son. I got 99 problems and having an Amiibo ain't one.

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:19.000
Well, thank you.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
Because you can't stop at one Amiibo.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:24.000
Brad from Pod Culture says, Shane, grab one. I'll pay you back.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:32.000
You know, if you found one of these Power Ranger toys Shane is looking for, he'll buy you more than a Mega Man Amiibo, I'm sure.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
That sounded vaguely sexual.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
Not anything freaky. Alright.

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:40.000
ActDeaf, I'm gonna let you go so we can try to get some more calls, but thanks for calling in.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
Hey, thanks for having me.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:43.000
Yeah, take care, buddy.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:51.000
Alright. 1877GameOLR, our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio, if you want to give the show a call.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:56.000
Super jealous of the Korean box art for Super Beat Zonic. It looks so much better than ours.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:01.000
You know, some people are talking about Zonic in Chat, MXC saying, I preordered the Zonic edition, I'm bad.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:06.000
ActDeaf in Chat saying, it does look nice, I kind of want it.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:07.000
So, there you go.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:08.000
It's exciting.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:09.000
It is exciting.

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
Hey, we got another call on the line coming in, let's get to it.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Oh, I feel blessed. Blessed, I hear a train pulling up to the station.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:27.000
Oh, we even have video here in studio. Amazing.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:32.000
I'm Sally!

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:36.000
Jim Sally! What is so good? Where the hell have you been?

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Dude, I've been on a journey.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:41.000
A spiritual journey?

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:44.000
I went places I never thought I would go before.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
Oh, so you're playing Ingress 2?

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:47.000
What?

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:48.000
Never mind.

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
What kind of journey did you go on?

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:56.000
A sentimental journey.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
A sense of something journey.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Was it a sexy journey?

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:02.000
It was a little bit.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:05.000
I had a fucking...

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
Do you want to know it's gross?

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
Do you want to know how gross you want to get?

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Why not?

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
It's after dark right now.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
It probably gets pretty gross.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
I'm going to tell you though, because I love you.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:17.000
Alright.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:23.000
You know how your body is full of like, you know, arteries and shit?

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:24.000
Yeah.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:25.000
Yeah?

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Well, I had one of my arteries get a little fucking full.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:29.000
Uh oh.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:33.000
It got kind of big and then it stopped things from happening.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:34.000
Uh oh.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Dude, it was in my, my, my, my, my taint.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
Oh my gosh. Oh no.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:46.000
And I had it for like months and I didn't know I had it. It was just in there.

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:47.000
And it stopped.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:52.000
It's embarrassing to talk about, but it stopped my testosterone for a little bit, dude.

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
And I didn't know what was going on.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:56.000
Wow.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:15:02.000
Well, thank God you got to, I mean, you look great and you are out around and moving and doing your train dance and everything.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:03.000
So thank God you found it.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:12.000
And the doctors, you know, and yes, the human bodies are crazy things and some of it's a little embarrassing to talk about, but shit happens, literally.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
Dude, I was getting strange.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:18.000
My wife was pregnant and shit and I thought I was having like sympathy pregnancies or something.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
I don't know what was happening.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:32.000
It was one of those things where it's like you, you were, I've heard about this before where, where women get pregnant and then the husbands have like this really like deep connection to it where they feel like they're pregnant too.

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:33.000
Yeah.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Hey, and look at that over in chat.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
There's nobody that's ewing you out in chat.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:42.000
We have, I'm glad you're okay, Jim Sally.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:45.000
Right on. Me too, man. It was scary.

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:46.000
All right. Well, you're all better now.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
So what's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:49.000
Okay. Boom.

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:51.000
Yeah. Boom. Muscles. Muscles.

02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:52.000
I get fucking excited.

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Listen, what's up today?

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:57.000
We're going to have a, we're going to have some bad fucking Bobby trivia.

02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:58.000
Whoa. Whoa.

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:02.000
Cause, cause Bobby Black Wolf just celebrated 500 episodes, right?

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:03.000
That's right, buddy.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:05.000
He had a great show tonight.

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:06.000
He did.

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
So yes, some Bobby Black Wolf trivia.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:12.000
So you've brought some Black Wolf trivia tonight to the show to celebrate?

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:15.000
I got some delicious Bobby Black Wolf trivia.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:16.000
All right.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:17.000
So how are we going to do this?

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:18.000
You going to ask questions?

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
We're going to see who here in studio gets it right?

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Yeah, but you guys like give it a little bit for the chatters to try to catch up to see if they can answer the questions.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:27.000
Never.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:28.000
First question. First question.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:29.000
All right.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.000
What is the name of, this is the easy round.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:38.000
What is the name of the instrument Bobby Black Wolf plays and what sports team does he play it for?

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:39.000
Hmm.

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:40.000
I know. I know.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
Oh, does Shane know?

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
Does Shane know?

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:47.000
By the way, I also would like to know if Travis knows.

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:52.000
Travis, if you're out there, go on Skype and tell us if you know the answer.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:55.000
Travis Donovan would never admit he listens to OLR.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:58.000
Is that the Travis that's listening?

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:03.000
If Travis Donovan's out there listening, he would never admit that he's listening to OLR.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Travis, you've changed, man.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:07.000
Just let people know you listen to OLR.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:09.000
I tell lots of people that.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:10.000
I put it on my resume.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:13.000
Like, don't worry about it, Travis.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:14.000
All right.

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:17.000
The instrument Bobby plays and what team he plays for.

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:18.000
Anybody want to?

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
I know this, but what do you guys want to say?

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
He plays the zither for Manchester United.

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
That is not true and you know it.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:25.000
I know what he plays.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:26.000
What does he play?

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
He plays drums for the Atlanta Falcons.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:29.000
That's right.

02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:31.000
He plays percussion for the Atlanta Falcons.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:33.000
Beautiful answer.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Let's get a little more obscure there.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
This is the medium round.

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:37.000
All right.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Bobby started his show 10 years ago almost.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:41.000
It's a long time ago.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:42.000
It is.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:45.000
The world was a different place.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:49.000
Gas was fucking like $3 a liter or some shit.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Or what was it?

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:51.000
A gallon?

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:52.000
$2 a gallon?

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
Yeah, we don't have that liter stuff here.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
It was like $2 a gallon.

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
Yeah, it was cheap.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Bobby was fresh out of college.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.000
He was good looking.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:02.000
His beard was just little.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
It wasn't quite Doug Bynum yet.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
He's still good looking.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:07.000
You know what I mean?

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:08.000
He's 29 still.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:11.000
What kind of car did Bobby Blockwolf drive?

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:16.000
If you listen to the show back then, you wouldn't know it because he talked about it a few times.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:17.000
I know because I rode in it.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:19.000
I think it was the same car.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:23.000
I always think of Bobby Blackwolf in that car when I think of Bobby Blackwolf.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:24.000
Nobody drives now.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
When Bobby started the show, what was he driving?

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:29.000
I know what it is.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:30.000
A whambulance.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
A whambulance?

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
This is why you get fired from shows by Bobby.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
I was trying to think of a funny car.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
That was a pretty good car.

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:43.000
Brad from Pod Culture is right in the chat.

02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:44.000
It was a Mustang.

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:45.000
I know that.

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:46.000
Oh, that's right.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:47.000
Mustang convertible.

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:48.000
It was.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:49.000
Alright.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:53.000
Do you want the super ultra hard question now?

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:54.000
Sure.

02:18:56.000 --> 02:19:00.000
What is Bobby Blackwolf's social insurance number?

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
No, that's not a super hard question.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.000
212 fuck you.

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:09.000
That's the social security number.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:16.000
The super hard question today is what game is Jim Salley talking about when Jim Salley

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:19.000
is in Bobby Blackwolf's intro?

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:23.000
Oh, shit.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:24.000
See what I mean?

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:25.000
This one's good.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:26.000
You've heard it.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:27.000
Is that the one that's Halo?

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:29.000
Is Jim Salley the one talking about Halo?

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:30.000
I'm going to say Halo.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:31.000
It's Halo.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.000
That's what Actif says.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Halo.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:37.000
Halo.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
Halo is the answer.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:41.000
That is correct.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:42.000
That is correct.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Rob, three for three, buddy.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
Bobby and I are tight.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:47.000
We started a network together.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:48.000
What can I say?

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:52.000
I did not think you would get that last one, buddy.

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:53.000
Oh, my God.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:58.000
No, well, I've heard that intro an awful lot.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:19:59.000
What can I say?

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:00.000
That is true.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:03.000
That intro has stood the test of time.

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:06.000
That's the kind of influence Jim Salley can have on a show.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:07.000
It has.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:12.000
I always laugh at Bobby's new intro because instead of streaming all the good calls together,

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:17.000
he's, I don't want to say you had a bad call, Jim, but he's, no, he's, but he's streamed

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:20.000
like, okay, he's got like the person who cuts out.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
He's got the person he's like, he doesn't agree with.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:23.000
I scared Jim Salley off.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:31.000
I didn't, I didn't mean that he put a lot of like, I don't know, like not so great,

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:32.000
great moments together.

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Like that.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:35.000
That makes sense.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
Oh, Jim Salley's crying.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
I didn't mean it like that.

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Come back, Jim Salley.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:43.000
I miss you.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:44.000
I'm back.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:45.000
All right.

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:49.000
Fuck, it's tight in here, man.

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
The webcam is a very, very tiny space.

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:53.000
What can I say?

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:55.000
I'm working out a lot, man.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:56.000
I can't fit in here anymore.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:57.000
Okay.

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:58.000
I'm in.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:20:59.000
Okay.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:00.000
I'm okay now.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:06.000
So yeah, dude, I fucking, it was a crazy little, little turn of events I had to go through

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:14.000
for a little while, but I've always, I've always been listening and I, I'm finally putting

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:15.000
it together.

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:20.000
Well, I, I'm glad you're here tonight, Jim.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:25.000
I'm, I, uh, I hope you continue to, uh, listen and grace us with your presence once in a

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:28.000
while to play random trivia games or what have you.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:31.000
And, uh, you know, I still want you to start a podcast someday.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:32.000
I really do.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
My sister came down from Toronto.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:36.000
She's a standup comedian.

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
Is she, is she, get out, really?

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:39.000
I'm being serious.

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
She talked me through, her name is Susie Marks.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:42.000
You can check her out online.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:43.000
M A R K S.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:46.000
Susanna Marks, M A R K S.

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:47.000
Okay.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
On the internet and stuff, because everyone wants to give her some likes.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:50.000
She likes that shit.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:54.000
But she talked me through it on, on today and we put some good ideas together and we

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
recorded a couple of little demos.

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:01.000
It might be, it's going to be a manly podcast.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:02.000
A manly podcast.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:03.000
That's okay.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:08.000
It's time for men to be men.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:09.000
Don't break something, Jim.

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
It's time for men to be men, Rob.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
You know what I'm saying?

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:14.000
I understand.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
You know what I'm saying?

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:17.000
I, Jim, Jim, Jim.

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
When Shane dropped those fucking donuts, he was a man.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:24.000
Shane dropped those donuts and he came up to you and he said, lover, I dropped the donut.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:28.000
And then you said, you said you'd be a man and you get the fuck back outside and you

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:29.000
get the more donuts.

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:32.000
And Shane said, yes, sir.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:33.000
I said, no.

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
Shane, get the fucking donuts, man.

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:38.000
You can't tell a guy you're going to give him a motherfucking donut.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:41.000
Ah, he had, he had a donut, Jim Sally.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:42.000
He had two of them.

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:45.000
I ate two donuts because I'm a big boy.

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:46.000
Yeah.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
But those were my donuts that I dropped for myself.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
Rob, you were going to eat both the fucking donuts.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:53.000
Jim, I am, I am all for a manly men's show.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
Believe me, Jim, I like men.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:03.000
Well, good.

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:04.000
We're going to do it, buddy.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:05.000
All right.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:06.000
That sounds awesome.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:07.000
I can't wait.

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:10.000
All right, Jim Sally, I got to let you go so we can try to get another call, wrap up

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:13.000
the show, but thank you so much for gracing us with your presence tonight and playing

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:14.000
Bobby Blackwell trivia.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:15.000
Love you, man.

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:16.000
It was good.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
Shane, don't give him fucking two donuts, man.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:19.000
You got to be with him.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:22.000
The one looked like the one in the introduction to the Simpsons.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:23.000
I had to eat it.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
It was like purple and springy.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:26.000
Shouldn't eat two donuts, guys.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
Just eat fucking one donut.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:29.000
I couldn't help myself.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:30.000
All right.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:31.000
Now I feel guilty.

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:32.000
All right.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:33.000
Bye, Jim Sally.

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:34.000
Thanks for calling in.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:35.000
Choo choo.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:36.000
Bye, Jim.

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:37.000
Goodbye.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:38.000
For now, we'll talk to you maybe next week.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:39.000
All right.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:40.000
I'll see you later.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Bye, Jim.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:44.000
I'll be down here.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:45.000
Okay.

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:52.000
Brad from Pod Culture says he just needs to submit a ton of random clips and put them

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
in random rotation.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:55.000
I would be totally okay with that.

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:58.000
More people would probably listen to that than the music feed.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:23:59.000
Let's be real.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:04.000
You just have Jim Sally going on rants 24-7 when there's no other live program on the

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:09.000
network, and I think people would be totally down for that.

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
So great to hear from Jim Sally.

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:14.000
Well, we will try to squeeze in one more call here.

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:15.000
1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:20.000
Our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:21.000
Yeah.

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:24.000
Try to squeeze you in if you want to get in on the show.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:27.000
Are you looking up any more last minute stories over there?

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:28.000
Low-key, Darzara?

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
Arrowhead says they're not doing Gauntlet anymore.

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:31.000
Oh, really?

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:32.000
No more Gauntlet games?

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:33.000
Yeah.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:34.000
That was on Game Politics.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:35.000
Hold on.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:36.000
Why?

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:37.000
I have to find it again.

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:38.000
The new Gauntlet wasn't bad at all.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:39.000
That's kind of sad.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
I didn't play it, but I have it.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:42.000
I just haven't played it yet.

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:43.000
It's not bad at all.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:47.000
It's Diablo inspired, but it's a little different.

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:48.000
You don't go for the gear grind.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
It's just straight up the gold.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:54.000
Yeah, you have last minute stories.

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:57.000
Smile Basic is coming to 3DS.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:07.000
If you remember, Smile Basic was on the regular DS and DSi a while back.

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:11.000
You can actually program games in it, and now you can do that as well.

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:14.000
It allows for more complex games to be made.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:18.000
It's only $10 in the US, coming out on the 15th of October.

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:22.000
Check it out.

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
One I missed a little bit earlier.

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Minecraft got an update recently.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:31.000
With that, you can actually get some sort of special magical wings to be able to fly around,

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:35.000
or I should say glide around in the game.

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:38.000
They are not necessarily wings.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:41.000
It seems like it's a hang glider or something.

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:45.000
Apparently, you can find it, but you can't actually craft those in the game.

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
That's kind of cool.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:54.000
The deal with Arrowhead is that they're not going to be doing updates for Gauntlet Slayer Edition anymore.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:58.000
They said that they were happy working with Warner Bros. Entertainment,

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:01.000
and now they're ready to bring it to an end.

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000
They're not going to do any more patches.

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
They just likely said they're not going to do any more patches.

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
Nothing will be unfixed.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:13.000
Anything that has a problem will remain unfixed, and they haven't really said why.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:16.000
So, yeah, no more.

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:19.000
So that's it.

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
Maybe the game sales slowed down or something.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:24.000
They've got to shift resources to another game or something.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:25.000
They don't have the money anymore. I don't know.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:26.000
Possibly.

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
Anything else, Loki?

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:29.000
That's it.

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
Shane, you got anything else there?

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:32.000
No.

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:33.000
I guess that's it then.

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:36.000
We're going to go ahead and wrap up for the evening because the phones aren't ringing either.

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:39.000
But those are some pretty great calls tonight.

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:43.000
So if you guys want to follow up, you can always send us an email.

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
Participate at orangelaunchradio.com.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
You can also contact us on Twitter.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
All great places to get ahold of us.

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:55.000
We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts and wrap it up for the night.

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
But as I always say towards the end of the show,

02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:03.000
if you did enjoy what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two or 15 or 60 about the show.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:06.000
And help spread the word about the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:11.000
Because we don't have a big website or really big names backing up this show.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
So we really appreciate the word of mouth.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:14.000
It goes an awful long way.

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:17.000
And hey, participate with the show.

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:18.000
Come be a part of it.

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:21.000
Everybody's welcome here at Orange Lounge Radio.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
Including Shane who joined us here in studio tonight.

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:24.000
Thanks for being here, Shane.

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:25.000
Even if you were a tardy.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:26.000
It's all right.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:27.000
It happens.

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:28.000
Thank you for the donuts earlier today.

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:29.000
You're welcome.

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:30.000
And for all the shopping.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Even if you encourage me to buy things, I probably should know.

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:33.000
Yeah.

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:34.000
Yeah.

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:35.000
Any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:41.000
Everybody should go pre-order Super Beat Zonic so it does well enough to have DLC and stuff like that.

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:44.000
Do you want to plug your Twitter or anything for people to follow you?

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:45.000
No.

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:46.000
All right. Fair enough.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:47.000
I think I gave it out already anyway.

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:50.000
Jamie, you're ready to say something.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:51.000
So what's your final thought for tonight?

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
Thank you for letting me dance some at Shane.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:54.000
You're welcome.

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:57.000
I have to now find the PS2 and hook it up.

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
Because we only have the PS4 and we hooked up.

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
That's such a good game too.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:02.000
I know.

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:03.000
It's so underappreciated.

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
I wish though you had your controllers here.

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:06.000
I never had this.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:07.000
I thought you did.

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:08.000
Nope.

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:09.000
Never had the clappy hand controllers.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:10.000
Whose did I play it in?

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:11.000
I thought you did too.

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:12.000
No.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:16.000
Because I tried playing it without the clappy hand controllers on the clappy hand mode.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
And it's really hard.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:21.000
I thought the first time I played it was with the clappy hand controller.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:22.000
That wasn't me.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:27.000
Which reminded me of the old ColecoVision button finger thing that you have the little joystick on.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:30.000
I think we have one of those somewhere.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:35.000
I bet that was our friend here locally who I've just lost touch with over the years.

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
That he also collected all his music game stars.

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Remember he had the arcade style popping music and all that?

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:41.000
That's right.

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
I feel like he's the one that would have had that if anybody.

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
It was Ryan.

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:48.000
Oh that's not who I was thinking of.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:52.000
No he didn't have those but he had the popping music.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
The full one.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
Whatever.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
Shane brings out my inner whatever.

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
Sorry.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:01.000
That's okay.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
Logan your final thought tonight.

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:06.000
My final thought is...

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:09.000
I guess I'll play more Ingress this week.

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:12.000
One of us. One of us.

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
My phone didn't let me download it.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:15.000
Why not?

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:16.000
Because I'm out of room.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:17.000
Delete something.

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:21.000
No because I cannot go without my Bejeweled fix Rob.

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
Alright deleting Bejeweled.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:24.000
No.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:28.000
And my final thought tonight is we're finishing a little early.

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000
Maybe I should try to livestream after this show.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:34.000
I usually try to edit OLR right away but maybe I'll try to squeeze in a livestream before anything.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:38.000
Or if you didn't watch Amy Schumer on SNL you should watch her monologue.

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:39.000
It's so good.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:40.000
Was it good?

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:41.000
I died.

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:42.000
I'll try to find it on Uber or something.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:43.000
She's like a more offensive Sarah Silverman.

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
Alright we'll see.

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:46.000
We'll see.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:47.000
Stay tuned to my Twitter.

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:50.000
Twitter.com slash SKIE.

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:53.000
Everyone needs to stay for the fortune cookie this time because it's really good.

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:54.000
It makes me think of Pogo.

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:58.000
Well don't say that because then the people on the podcast are like what is she talking about?

02:29:58.000 --> 02:29:59.000
I'm sorry.

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:00.000
And they don't realize there's more show to happen.

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:01.000
That means they have to listen to us live.

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:02.000
Alright that's right.

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
You gotta come out sometime and listen to us live.

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:05.000
Alright goodnight everybody.

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:09.000
Have a wonderful night and we will see you in 7 days to do this all over again.

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
Thanks for listening to OLR.

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:14.000
