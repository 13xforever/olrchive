0	18080	This week, Niantic Labs, Makers of Ingress, receive $20 million in funding from the Pokemon
18080	20860	company Nintendo and Google, and that's just the tip of the iceberg.
20860	24080	We have plenty more in this week's gaming news, your comments called and listless, all
24080	27800	starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27800	33200	Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends out there on the internet
33200	36620	and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36620	45080	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this October the 18th of 2015 with episode number 618 of
45080	46180	our show.
46180	52320	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter as Skye and joining me as always
52320	55320	say hello over there to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
55320	56320	Hi.
56320	57320	How are you DarkSakura?
57320	58320	Gassy.
58320	59320	Gassy?
59320	63160	No, I've been drinking this Yarritos tamarind soda.
63160	64160	Yarritos!
64160	71920	And I've been burping like I've been on a beer binge like you wouldn't believe.
71920	72920	TMI.
72920	74040	But you know what?
74040	75160	I'm just keeping it real.
75160	79160	I did not know it was like Mexican food night here at Studio OLR, it's like a fiesta here
79160	80160	in Studio.
80160	81720	You're not the only one that brought that tonight.
81720	86360	Except for the like grouchy old white guy I elbowed at El Forestero.
86360	88000	You almost got in a fight.
88000	91160	No, I just caught him on being a rude entitled shit.
91160	94360	I keep it real Rob, I keep it real.
94360	97520	DarkSakura tried to start a fight at the local taqueria.
97520	101080	Anyway, also say hello to of course the one guy who didn't bring Mexican food.
101080	102080	Say hello to Techmaster Loki.
102080	103920	No, I tried pileology instead.
103920	107640	Yeah, that's one of those pizza places where they put the pizza in the oven, like the ultra
107640	109560	hot oven for just like two minutes, right?
109560	111040	Yeah, it was quick.
111080	114440	I mean it's basically you pick what toppings you want, I mean like any other pizza place,
114440	115840	but they kind of make it in front of you.
115840	119520	Yeah, I headed a place just like that in Boston, actually, for when I was there this year.
119520	123680	I'm like, I don't know what I want when I went in there, I'm like, ehhh, pepperoni.
123680	124680	That pepperoni?
124680	128280	If you guys didn't know, Loki's a very picky eater, so he has to...
128280	131320	Well, I wanted to put a bunch of stuff on there, but I was like, you know, if I put
131320	137480	bacon and pepperoni on there, it just, it's doesn't kind of go, it's like too much almost.
137480	141560	I don't like, you know, like combination pizzas too much because it's just a lot of
141560	143200	toppings and stuff, so...
143200	145640	It's kind of salad on a pizza, and it's a lot.
145640	150280	I just wanted like, I don't know, I wanted them to dump the whole tray of bacon on it,
150280	154920	but they wouldn't do that, so I was like, fine, I'll do pepperoni and garlic.
154920	157480	Could I get a scoop of pepperoni and a tray of bacon?
157480	160520	You have more in the back, we're going to need more.
160520	161520	Can you order more?
161520	162520	Can I get it here now?
162520	163520	I love it.
163560	167520	All right, well of course we are here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the
167520	173080	gamer lifestyle as we do every Sunday night at the Voice of the Geek's Network, vognetwork.com.
173080	177960	Real quick, I was kind of on the scene, sorry, but like seriously, yesterday I was grocery
177960	181360	shopping and they have like, you know, the bacon packages, little bacon bit packages
181360	186040	and stuff, and there's a little thing on it, it's like, you know, now it's six ounces with
186040	189840	even more bacon to love, I'm like, with even more bacon to love, like it literally exclaimed
189840	193000	that out in the supermarket.
193000	195720	Is it just a picture of a pig saying, let me love you?
195720	200720	Anyway, how dare, yeah, if you are listening live and you want to yell at Loki for interrupting
200720	205560	your plug, join our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com because of course we do tape live at the
205560	209040	Voice of the Geek's Network Sunday nights at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern,
209040	211720	right after the Bobby Black Hole show.
211720	214960	But we are joined not just by you guys in our chat room and us here in studio, but we
214960	218440	have some special guests here in studio with us tonight.
218440	224040	It just, it ended up being a fiesta tonight and they brought Taco Bell to make it complete,
224040	227560	even though we all know that's not real Mexican food, but say hello.
227560	231960	Joining us again and we appreciate when he drops in every now and again.
231960	235400	Say hello everybody to VOG super fan, Flaco Jones.
235400	236400	Hello.
236400	237400	Hey Flaco.
237400	238400	Hi everybody.
238400	239400	How you doing?
239400	240400	I'm doing great.
240400	241400	How are you doing?
241400	243400	I'm, I'm well, actually I had a fantastic day yesterday, but I'll get into that.
243400	244400	That's great.
244400	245400	Yeah.
245400	246400	How about you?
246400	247400	Are you having a super weekend?
247400	248400	I'm having a super weekend.
248400	249720	It's been really, it's been really cool.
249720	250720	All right.
250720	253640	I went up all the way up to Lake County to see my family and usually that's not a great
253640	255960	experience, but it was fun and it's so nice up there.
255960	256960	Yeah.
256960	258700	The Lake over there, it's kind of smells funny.
258700	261200	It's it's, yeah, I grew up with it, so I'm used to that.
261200	266000	Now, now I'm sorry to get super serious, but I know that that County was really affected
266000	269040	by some fires recently, but I'm assuming your family didn't get it.
269040	270040	No, no.
270040	271040	They're in the North County.
271040	272040	All the fires have been in the South County.
272040	275260	So we did drive through like an area that was totally scorched.
275260	276260	So it's kind of sad.
276260	279260	And this signs up everywhere, you know, you know, thanks for, you know, first responders
279260	281900	and thanks, you know, firefighters who did all the hard work.
281900	282900	So this signs up everywhere.
282900	287380	Well, and it's tough because believe it or not, we're actually getting rain now in California,
287380	288380	which is nice.
288380	289380	Yeah.
289380	290380	It rained on the way up there.
290380	291380	That's pretty cool.
291380	292380	I was like, what?
292380	293380	What is this stuff?
293380	294380	But for those fire stricken areas that just causes the mud.
294380	295380	Yeah.
295380	296380	Then there's gonna be landslides and stuff.
296380	298220	It's really sad because all the vegetation's gone.
298220	299660	It's just, it's all dirt now.
299660	300660	It's pretty bad.
300660	301660	So yeah, definitely.
301660	303060	Sorry to bring everybody down guys.
303060	304060	I know.
304060	305060	Fires are bad.
305060	306060	You know, good awareness.
306060	307060	Yeah, that's true.
307060	308060	We need the help.
308060	310300	So if, you know, you feel like making a donation to red cross.
310300	314180	One of the places that burned up like a, there's this forest up there in your middle town.
314180	315940	I used to go camping with my buddies up there.
315940	320140	We would just go out in the middle of forest and you know, go camp out overnight and that
320140	321780	place totally is gone.
321780	325100	There's like a hot Springs up there that's famous for like a nudist colony.
325100	326100	It's gone.
326100	327100	Pictures of that one.
327100	328100	It was really sad.
328100	329100	Oh yeah.
329100	330100	Yeah.
330100	331100	The Harbin hot Springs.
331100	332100	Yeah.
332100	333100	Not the nudist colony.
333100	334100	I know.
334140	337380	They may learn that taking carbon baths are healthy and good for the skin.
337380	338380	Yeah.
338380	339380	There you go.
339380	342540	So it's, it's, it's really sad to see the pictures like, Oh, I used to drive through
342540	343540	it all the time.
343540	347100	My friends are all live there, but they all have moved out since nobody I knew was really
347100	348100	affected anymore.
348100	349100	They don't like it.
349100	350100	Their family home.
350100	351100	They was like, Oh, that's where I grew up.
351100	352100	It's gone now.
352100	353100	But they're like, Oh, but we moved on.
353100	354100	I know.
354100	355100	It's kind of sad to think that way.
355100	356100	That's what he said.
356100	357100	I like, I called my friend.
357100	359940	I'm like, did you like, so your family home burned down, right?
359940	360940	He's like, yeah, yeah.
360940	361940	I was in the area.
361940	362940	Like, wow.
362980	364300	But I don't really go up there anymore.
364300	366580	So there's not a lot of people.
366580	370460	I lived in the same house for like 18 years, so I never moved as a kid.
370460	372540	So my house, my family home burned down.
372540	376940	I'd be like, so sad without like giving away addresses here on the show.
376940	382540	But my, the house I grew up in is in Roseville and it's not that far off the beaten path.
382540	387160	So once in a great while, I'll still drive by it just to say, Oh, check in, see how it,
387160	388160	how it looks these days.
388160	391740	I'm like, everything looks smaller now that I'm by.
391740	392740	What is this?
392740	393740	Like the nineties.
393740	398940	This is what Google maps is for from a satellite.
398940	403740	I don't have to drive all the way like where I grew up to look at my hands and hand view.
403740	404840	It's not the same.
404840	407740	So of course we have a comment from our chat room with Falco Jones being here.
407740	412960	We have SSU 100 Matt and our chat room says, Flaco Jones, hopefully nothing breaks or area
412960	413960	blackout tonight.
413960	414960	Yeah, I know.
414960	415960	You never know.
415960	416960	It's starting to rain.
416960	418140	California doesn't know how to handle rain.
418140	419140	Everything shorts out.
419140	420140	We never know.
420140	421140	You know what happens?
421540	422540	Yeah.
422540	423540	All right.
423540	426180	Well also, also a welcome back to the show two weeks in a row.
426180	427180	Look at us.
427180	428180	Say hello to Shana.
428180	429180	Linko.
429180	430180	Hi.
430180	431180	How are you?
431180	432180	Fine.
432180	433180	Yep.
433180	434180	Yeah.
434180	435180	How's power Rangers?
435180	436180	Really good.
436180	437180	Yeah.
437180	438180	Yeah.
438180	439180	So today you and I went on a shopping adventure.
439180	440180	Yeah.
440180	443060	So I got that retron five a couple of weeks ago, which I think I talked about on air.
443060	444060	Right.
444060	448840	But I need like, I have a few super Nintendo games and a couple of NES games, but you know,
448840	452240	my collection from when I was a kid, Lord knows what it's probably still at my childhood
452240	454380	home or something, but Lord knows what that stuff is.
454380	460260	So I have to kind of build, I have to build something that's even like a 10th of an impressive
460260	462080	as Jamie's collection is.
462080	463960	So I want to go buy some games.
463960	470720	So we went to a local flea market today and I wasn't, I was kind of disappointed.
470720	471720	I don't know.
471720	472720	I thought a lot of...
472720	473720	Disappointed in their prices.
473720	477640	A little bit, the prices a little bit, just the condition of all the cartridges like look
477640	479480	like they'd been out in the sun forever.
479480	483440	And I was just like, the flea market was a really scary place, so it doesn't surprise
483440	484440	me.
484440	485440	It was.
485440	486440	And you saw a knockoff power Rangers.
486440	487440	Yeah.
487440	488440	It was like Dino superheroes.
488440	490760	I love the knockoff toys.
490760	491760	Those are the best.
491760	496640	They're like the ones that they have, like Spiderman, like Raphael from the Ninja turtles,
496640	499540	a power ranger, a transformer.
499540	502680	It's like some weird, it made me sad.
502680	505760	There's so much awesome bootleg stuff at a flea market though, but it was really crowded
505760	506760	today.
506880	508240	The weather's like perfect right now.
508240	511680	It's like, you know, that kind of overcast 70 degrees.
511680	512680	It's a good day to be outside.
512680	515240	The one I miss going to, and I used to do it all the time because I used to live down
515240	517120	there was the San Jose flea market.
517120	519560	Man, that flea market was enormous.
519560	522760	Well the one on Roseville is pretty impressive.
522760	525320	This is way huger.
525320	526320	Way huger?
526320	527320	Yes, way huger.
527320	529000	That's proper English.
529000	530920	So it's, it's awesome.
530920	531920	Awesome.
531920	534840	I remember you said like, it was so big, they had parking across the street and you had
534840	538640	to walk under the street to get to the flea market.
538640	539640	That's where I buy all my NES titles.
539640	543600	Yeah, I was going to say, now I want to go to the other flea market in town to see if
543600	548800	maybe I can find some good deals, because I did get Clue on Super Nintendo at the other
548800	551880	flea market a few years ago, and that was kind of awesome.
551880	557280	And I see TigerClan chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Sky needs to stream on Twitch with the
557280	559600	Retron 5, got to revisit some of those old games.
559600	562360	I actually, I really do, and I was playing with it a little bit today.
562360	564120	I thought the quality was pretty darn good.
564120	565920	Yeah, it looked pretty good.
565920	569720	And I told, I told him that all he has to do is just stream Super Metroid because it's
569720	571400	the only game that's worth streaming.
571400	574400	I do have my Super Metroid cartridge, you know I still have that, so that'll be one
574400	575400	of the first.
575400	576400	That'll be one of the first.
576400	578400	But the game you saw today, I think I'll stream first.
578400	579400	Oh.
579400	581400	Well, that's one of my favorites.
581400	582400	Anyway.
582400	583400	Alright, whatever.
583400	591640	Okay, so we're going to get into tonight's show with the kickoff topic first, and today,
591640	596040	if you didn't already know, actual today that we're taping the show, October 18th,
596040	602120	is the 30th anniversary of the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System in America.
602120	605960	So even though, you know, some, because you probably are thinking, wait a minute, how
605960	610240	did we celebrate 30 years of Super Mario Brothers, well, because that was all by the Japanese
610240	611240	days.
611240	616680	So, because the NES or the Famicom was out in Japan, I think in 83, but it came out here
616680	620080	in the States in 85, October 18th, 1985.
620080	624240	So today we're looking back on 30 years of the Nintendo Entertainment System.
624240	627880	Later in the show, we're actually going to play a listless game around this.
627880	631440	If you've never heard us do listless before, stay tuned, we're going to get into that in
631440	632840	Part B tonight.
632840	636520	I should also say here at the top of the show, I was going to get into this in housekeeping,
636520	640360	but I want to make sure we get a plug for this, because this is a pretty big deal.
640360	645320	We have a cool little exclusive interview from our correspondent, DJ Rama, from Anime
645320	651920	Jam Session, is actually going to bring us an interview he did tonight with Kyle Hebert,
651920	655600	and you may not know the name, but he's a voice actor and he's done a lot of big stuff,
655600	660440	including he's the voice of Ryu in like Street Fighter IV and, you know, Smash Brothers and
660440	661440	all that.
661440	664320	So he's got a pretty impressive resume when it comes to anime and games.
664320	668640	So DJ Rama S will be bringing us that interview a little later in the show.
668640	669640	So we'll get to that.
669640	672480	But anyway, sorry for the tangent, but I want to make sure that got a shout out towards
672480	674080	the top of the show.
674080	681160	Getting back into the 30th anniversary of the NES, I know that my life has been shaped
681160	684420	significantly by the Nintendo Entertainment System.
684420	687160	Let me go around the room, because I know we've shared a lot of memory stories and so
687160	688160	forth.
688160	693320	But let me go around the room and say, what do you guys consider to be your favorite,
693320	697920	your one favorite NES game playing experience?
697920	701560	Like what is your favorite NES game that you ever played or your favorite experience?
701560	703640	And more importantly, why?
703640	705360	I see Dark Soccer picking the mic up.
705360	708000	So ladies first, your favorite NES and why?
708000	709000	The Guardian Legend.
709000	710000	Of course.
710000	715120	I mean, it was semi obscure.
715120	718760	It was a sequel to a not great MSX game.
718760	720440	And it was really freaking hard.
720440	724640	And I had a very deep sense of accomplishment when I beat it.
724640	727560	And I don't even nearly have that skill now.
727560	732520	It requires really fast reflexes, but it was such a good game.
732520	737000	Yeah, like even playing that very first level, the beginning of it scrolls by so fast, it
737000	738000	like throws you off guard.
738000	739480	Like, why can't I get any of these power-ups?
739480	742160	But it's kind of supposed to do that, I guess, in the very beginning.
742160	747400	And then me being young and having a nice, strong female hero, it was really nice.
747400	748400	Yeah.
748400	751880	No, that is absolutely one of my favorite games for sure.
751880	753480	Who's got the mic over there, Flacco?
753480	754480	What about you?
754480	756080	What is your favorite NES game ever?
756080	757080	Why?
757080	758080	Oh my gosh.
758080	759080	This is such a hard question.
759080	760480	I only can pick one.
760480	761480	Yeah.
761520	764520	I was unprepared for it.
764520	765520	It's live radio.
765520	769080	Alright, so I mean, the first thing that always pops in my head is Mario 2.
769080	772560	And I know like, oh, that's a weird game from blah, blah, blah.
772560	773560	It's not a real Mario game.
773560	774560	I don't think so.
774560	775560	I don't agree with that at all.
775560	776560	I don't know.
776560	777560	I don't know.
777560	778560	And it's all a dream or whatever.
778560	779560	I don't care.
779560	780560	I love that game.
780560	786260	I think it's one of the first games I beat because I didn't get Nintendo when everybody
786260	787260	else did.
787260	790040	So I played all these games like after the fact, kind of.
790440	792480	I played Mario Brothers and I played through it.
792480	793480	I didn't beat it.
793480	796600	And then I played Mario 2 and I'm like, oh, I love this game so much more because I kind
796600	798040	of had them both at the same time.
798040	800320	So yeah, Mario 2 I really loved.
800320	803840	I loved beating the final boss and I love the art style and I like the different gameplay
803840	804840	for the different characters.
804840	808680	And then the only other game I could think of is, this is why it's neck and neck for
808680	811040	me, but Deja Vu on the NES.
811040	812040	Oh yeah.
812040	818080	That was in that same series as like an uninvited Shadow Gate.
818080	819080	I just love Deja Vu.
819120	822880	Again, I got all these games as hand-me-downs, so I had them way later.
822880	823880	That was a Mac game.
823880	825880	That series was really a Mac series.
825880	829080	And a lot of people say that the S ports weren't very good, but I just loved them.
829080	831680	The music in Shadow Gate, though, is seriously one of my favorites.
831680	834840	I know it's a Mac game, but then they got a Japanese composer, I think, to do the music.
834840	839040	I love the music in Deja Vu, so I don't know if it's the same composer, but I love that
839040	840040	game.
840040	842040	So I love both those games so much, so it's hard to pick.
842040	843400	No, that's all right.
843400	849000	And since you bring up Mario 2, you know how today, here we are 30 years later, and
849000	854680	oftentimes we criticize the sequel-itis, the yearly entry, right?
854680	858060	Like Madden 16, Roster Update 2016, right?
858060	862520	We kind of get very critical of sequels because they don't really differ that much from the
862520	863520	original.
863520	866800	But one interesting thing, like really interesting thing about the Nintendo Entertainment System
866800	873160	in particular, is that a lot of the sequels on NES were very different games.
873160	878200	And I know that Mario 2, we all know that it was based off another Japanese game and
878200	884360	that Japan actually had the Mario 2 that was very similar to Mario 1, so it was a hell
884360	886120	of a lot harder, right?
886120	891080	But I liked that it was so different, and it showed the versatility, I think, of the
891080	892720	strong characters.
892720	895680	But it wasn't just Mario 2, I mean, look at Castlevania.
895680	897920	Look at Simon's Quest versus the original.
897920	898920	Oh yeah, and I love that game.
898920	901360	I know a lot of people don't like that game either, but I love that game.
901360	903040	I kind of like the weird deviations.
903040	907960	I don't like Adventure of Link, but it's still a fun, interesting deviation.
907960	910920	I thought Adventure of Link was amazing when I was a kid.
910920	916680	Yeah, it wasn't nearly the same as Zelda 1, but it was so hard.
916680	919440	And I look back and I go, how did I beat this as a kid?
919440	923720	And it's just hours and hours of practice and staying up late with your friends.
923720	924720	That's what we did.
924720	929040	We stayed up until two in the morning until, you know, our parents woke up screaming like
929040	934720	get to bed, you know, playing these games and getting to know these patterns.
934720	935760	I love those weird sequels.
935760	936760	I don't know why.
936840	938880	I was always drawn to them, even if they're kind of not great.
938880	940560	It's just like, oh, I like that it's different.
940560	945520	I think many, many people consider Mega Man 2 superior to Mega Man 1, which I know it's
945520	946520	not.
946520	947520	Everybody's going to agree with me on that point.
947520	951000	And Mega Man 1 did have, you know, a lot of things to love about it, but Mega Man 2 kind
951000	953120	of like really perfected the formula.
953120	956960	I'm trying to think what other games were very, very different with the sequels.
956960	961480	I don't know if you would consider Gradius and Life Force, because I guess they technically
961480	962760	then there was a Gradius 2.
962760	967480	I think a lot of people at the time considered Life Force to be Gradius 2 and they were very
967480	968480	different.
968480	969480	Salamander, right?
969480	973560	So if you know the history, there's another one that was extremely different between the
973560	974560	one and the two.
974560	978840	Was it Donkey Kong 2 different or was it Donkey Kong Jr.?
978840	982800	It was Donkey Kong Jr. and sort of, but not really.
982800	986920	But Donkey Kong Jr. and we, I thought Donkey Kong Jr. was more accessible, at least when
986920	990360	we brought this up on the show a few weeks ago, but Donkey Kong Jr. was notable because
990360	992440	it's like the only game where Mario's the villain.
992440	994800	Okay, I don't remember.
994800	998120	At least that's what you think.
998120	1005000	Unless you consider Mario Party possible, then Mario is certainly the villain for some
1005000	1006800	people in that game as well.
1006800	1009560	All right, let's move on.
1009560	1011920	Shane, how about you?
1011920	1014880	Greatest NES game for you and why?
1014880	1021320	Probably Mega Man 3 because I remember playing it at Power Fest, Nintendo Power Fest, and
1021320	1025600	they could not pull me away from playing Top Man's stage or Snake Man's stage.
1025600	1029600	Those were the two I think you got to play and it just, I was so into Mega Man at that
1029600	1036520	point and my love of Mega Man has never really waned since then, since Mega Man 3, so it's
1036520	1037520	my favorite.
1037520	1041480	What's your favorite stage in Mega Man 3?
1041480	1051680	To play, probably Gemini Man's stage, to listen to Shadow Man's stage.
1051680	1056800	I always liked Snake Man because the level's so cartoony and I remember thinking that when
1056800	1057800	I was a kid.
1057800	1061980	I was very impressed with the graphics in Mega Man 2 and 3 because it's like I'm watching
1061980	1063320	a cartoon on my TV.
1063320	1064320	It looks so good.
1064320	1066560	Yeah, like when you were on the big snake and you had to shoot his head and it was going
1066560	1067560	up and down.
1067560	1068560	Yes, exactly.
1068560	1073720	Or like in Bubble Man's stage in Mega Man 2 with the big fish, it was kind of a lot
1073720	1074720	like that.
1074720	1075720	Yeah.
1075720	1076720	Yeah.
1076720	1077720	All right, that's a good answer, Mega Man 3.
1077720	1078720	Absolutely.
1078720	1079720	It is a good answer.
1079720	1080720	I know there's a lot of people who love Mega Man.
1080720	1081720	And it's better than 2.
1081720	1083020	Pissed that Capcom won't go back.
1083020	1084020	It's close.
1084020	1085020	No, it's better than 2.
1085020	1088880	Pissed that Capcom doesn't seem to want to revisit this era?
1088880	1096800	I'm actually, no, I'm not upset about that because I like 9 and 10, but I'm done with
1096800	1097800	8-bit games.
1097800	1103500	If we're going to make a Mega Man 11, let's at least graduate to the Super Nintendo style
1103500	1104500	or Mega Man 8.
1104500	1105500	I love Mega Man 8.
1105500	1108580	I love everything about 8, especially the bad voice acting.
1108580	1109580	So if they could do that for him.
1109580	1110580	Dr. Waiwi.
1110580	1111580	Yes.
1111580	1112580	Yes.
1112580	1116380	Or when he like flubs his lines, but you know, they don't cut it.
1116380	1117580	They just let him keep going.
1117580	1118980	Oh, it's so good.
1118980	1124860	Do you think that, I lost my train of thought.
1124860	1125860	Mighty No. 9.
1125920	1128800	Mighty Mighty No. 9 is going to prove to be a good successor, like something that you're
1128800	1129800	looking for?
1129800	1134880	I'm not looking forward to it at all based on stuff I've seen on it, like video.
1134880	1139320	It looks soulless for a Mega Man game or a Mega Man ripoff.
1139320	1140320	Ouch.
1140320	1141320	Yeah.
1141320	1142320	Alright.
1142320	1143320	Loki, how about you?
1143320	1145680	Yeah, that's tough.
1145680	1149680	Probably Super Mario Bros. 3?
1149680	1154520	Just because I was really hyped up about that game even before it came out with the whole
1154540	1156340	wizard thing.
1156340	1159060	You know, that was going to be the first time they were showing that off, and it was like,
1159060	1164100	oh my god, this is amazing, and then I played it and it was, oh my god, amazing, and especially
1164100	1169380	like the airship levels and stuff like that were pretty awesome, or the giant world.
1169380	1174700	They hyped that game so fucking good too with the movie, The Wizard, and like, you know,
1174700	1178180	because that movie was out like a good year before the game.
1178180	1181060	I don't know if maybe Japan had got that game a lot sooner than we did.
1181060	1182740	That was probably really the case.
1182740	1188280	You know, we didn't, the internet was not around in the late 80s, so if the game wasn't
1188280	1191000	out in America, you were none the wiser.
1191000	1195800	So yeah, there was so much build up to Mario 3, and when you finally got to play it, it
1195800	1197520	was, oh my god!
1197520	1201320	And plus, remember in the movie, they show you how to get the warp whistle, and so if
1201320	1204160	you were paying attention, you knew how to do it in the game.
1204160	1205160	Yep.
1205160	1206160	Crazy.
1206160	1207160	Alright, Mario 3.
1207160	1208160	I think a lot of people would pick that.
1208160	1210160	That was one of the big ones.
1210380	1212980	This might surprise you, because I'm not going to pick The Guardian Legend, even though that
1212980	1217100	is one of my very favorites, but I really think if I were to go back for what was my
1217100	1222180	favorite, my like essential NES game, it really would be The Original Legend of Zelda.
1222180	1228220	I think was really the one that just started it all, and I think in some ways, like, I
1228220	1229980	really can truly say that game changed my life.
1229980	1237660	I think it did, because, you know, it kind of made me more social in some ways at school,
1237660	1241280	and I know I've kind of brought this up before, that like I was totally like not the cool
1241280	1245720	kid at school, but then The Legend of Zelda, like, can you imagine that by the way, guys?
1245720	1250200	I was not a cool kid in school, I know it's hard to believe, but I just wasn't, but when
1250200	1256160	Zelda came out, like then, the guys that would pick on me would suddenly like, so, you know,
1256160	1259960	after like making fun of me around their friends, then when they had a chance to see me one
1259960	1264520	on one, alright, so, uh, how do I find the fourth dungeon on the second quest?
1264520	1267600	That's the best part about it though, is like, there's no direction to it.
1267620	1271780	And on top of all that, then when you're done, they have a whole completely second quest
1271780	1274140	to it, and that's like value right there.
1274140	1280020	That would be DLC today, that's the scary thing, that is DLC today, and that was just,
1280020	1282060	that was like an Easter egg back then, you know?
1282060	1285500	Well, and then today, like, imagine kids trying to play The Legend of Zelda, like, they're
1285500	1290460	not gonna know what the fuck to do, like, uh, what do I do?
1290460	1291460	How do I beat this?
1291460	1292460	Yeah, I know.
1292460	1293460	Figure it out.
1293460	1294460	Stupid.
1294520	1297820	Well, for me, like, the way I found everything out was magazines.
1297820	1302840	If you were researched, and you really, like, read up on it, you could find all this stuff
1302840	1306720	out and you just had to, like, be attention, or pay attention and be aware.
1306720	1311320	And you know, if you read all the magazines and, you know, got that fold-out map and,
1311320	1316480	um, god, uh, you know, the Nintendo Fun Club magazine before there was Nintendo Power,
1316480	1323520	um, and, uh, you know, just weird things like that, you just picked it up, talking to people
1323580	1327540	about games and trading secrets that way, like, that's just kinda like, because of the
1327540	1331500	internet and things like GameFAQs, and I'm not shading GameFAQs, I use that side a lot
1331500	1336060	myself, but we don't need, I mean, it's like, we don't really talk about game strategy anymore,
1336060	1337060	we don't need to.
1337060	1340140	But, like, I like that game how there's, like, so much hidden stuff and there's no indication
1340140	1343900	of where it is, there's no, like, cracked walls or anything in most of the places, like,
1343900	1348080	out in the outside, it's just like bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb all the walls.
1348080	1352360	One in the, one of the dungeons in the second quest, you have to set a tree on fire to get
1352380	1353900	it to open, right?
1353900	1358860	Okay, and, like, I think they give you a hint, one of the old ladies on one of the screens
1358860	1362180	says, like, the tree in the forest holds a secret.
1362180	1366420	Well, there's, like, 5,000 fucking trees in the forest, I mean, what are you supposed
1366420	1367700	to do, set every single one of them on fire?
1367700	1369700	Burn the forest down!
1369700	1370700	So.
1370700	1374740	Or, like, the invisible walls.
1374740	1377740	Those were the worst, having to figure out where the invisible walls were and just finding
1377740	1378740	them by accident.
1379400	1385200	Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, a lot of comments here on what I was just
1385200	1389100	saying about Zelda in chat, Kaijuto says, those fucking Zelda commercials threw me off
1389100	1391520	the game, they turned me off from it.
1391520	1396920	Yeah, remember how, like, everything was all hyped up for, like, you know, like, Nintendo
1396920	1401320	cereal and everything was like, wow, and neon colors, like, but all the commercials from,
1401320	1402320	like, that era.
1402320	1403320	That's just the era, yeah.
1403320	1404640	All the commercials back then were super lame.
1404640	1408120	I don't even remember, I don't even remember the Legend of Zelda commercial, to be honest
1408120	1409120	with you.
1409120	1410120	You don't remember it?
1410120	1412120	It was a guy in the room going, Zelda!
1412120	1413120	Zelda!
1413120	1416100	Weren't they, like, rapping the names of the enemies or something?
1416100	1417100	I thought that was it.
1417100	1420340	But there was that one too, yeah, there was a rapping commercial, there was so many weird
1420340	1421340	commercials.
1421340	1422340	Everything was a wrap.
1422340	1423340	Well, yeah, that's everything.
1423340	1427300	But I just remember the guy just in the room just screaming, Zelda!
1427300	1429660	It was such a bad commercial.
1429660	1434060	Let's see, Dark Tetsuya says, too used to having their handheld via a tutorial.
1434060	1438040	Why also, I don't want to sound like the get off my lawn gamer either, because there's
1438040	1442760	a lot of great games, and I've razzed games for not having a tutorial, like, remember
1442760	1446480	when I first played Minecraft, I was like, I don't fucking get it, but then when I played
1446480	1449800	the Xbox 360 one that did hold your hand a little bit, I was like, oh, okay, I get it
1449800	1450800	now.
1450800	1451800	You know?
1451800	1455320	And that's one of the things, well, to get into that later on, yeah, like, I like some
1455320	1458340	of the things that they changed in that one, where, like, you know, the crafting stuff's
1458340	1462680	a lot easier, you don't need to, you know, have to remember every recipe and stuff.
1462700	1466100	I kind of wish the Windows 10 version was like that again, because, or at least have
1466100	1468900	the option to turn that on, that would be nice.
1468900	1471700	Because I don't like having to remember the recipe, especially when there's, like, new
1471700	1473420	blocks, I'm like, what the hell is this block?
1473420	1474420	What do I use this for?
1474420	1477380	I have no idea what the hell I can craft with this.
1477380	1479820	I guess I could look it up.
1479820	1485020	Let's see, an anonymous chatter in our chat room, 466 says, I'm 30 years old and still
1485020	1488020	trying to figure out how to get past the first stage in Zelda.
1488020	1492100	Hey, good on you for not just going to Game Facts and cheating, though, but I'll give
1492120	1494400	you, I'll give you a hint, I'll give you a hint.
1494400	1501280	In the first couple dungeons in Zelda, like, every wall you can bomb through.
1501280	1502560	Every wall is, like, bombable.
1502560	1506160	So as long as you have a map, and you can find the map in the dungeon of what it looks
1506160	1507840	like, like, every wall you can bomb.
1507840	1509680	Just a little tip there.
1509680	1517400	Let's see, also, what else is in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, SSG100Matt says, I
1517400	1521900	had no clue how to play Zelda 2 until I read the maps in Nintendo Power.
1521900	1524580	There you go.
1524580	1528240	Let's see, now, of course, everybody's sharing YouTube clips.
1528240	1529420	So let me see here.
1529420	1535540	This one is, what is this one, this is the one that Flock was talking about.
1535540	1554520	What even is this?
1554520	1558760	Is that, like, the guy from, like, what was it, the second Ghostbusters movie or something?
1558760	1563040	You know, the one that was, like, not Vigo, but the guy that was, you know, possessed
1563040	1564040	by Vigo.
1564580	1565580	Oh my god.
1565580	1571580	It was seriously, though, that's, like, seriously, uh, PlayStation 3 advertisement material right
1571580	1572580	there.
1572580	1574780	I mean, that's just some weird shit.
1574780	1578660	Giant enemy crabs!
1578660	1580220	You expect it to go next.
1580220	1581220	I love it.
1581220	1582220	All right, thank you guys.
1582220	1583220	That was great.
1583220	1587820	Uh, so, yeah, I mean, who knows where gaming would be today without the NES?
1587820	1591420	I mean, the NES came out at the end of a huge video game crash.
1591420	1596880	I mean, a lot of people wrote off the game industry as dead because, and it wasn't because
1596880	1597880	of E.T.
1597880	1601680	It was not solely because of E.T., and a lot of people kind of mistake that, but it was
1601680	1607360	just these shitty licensed games were coming out by the bucketful, and it's just the marketplace.
1607360	1612240	God, if only shitty licensed games destroyed an industry, we'd be fucked right now.
1612240	1613240	Right?
1613240	1618280	And it's, it's, isn't it weird that that technically can kind of happen now, but it's not, like,
1618280	1619280	it's just different now.
1619280	1623420	The market's so different now, because, you know, PC is so open-ended, I mean, there is
1623420	1628740	a lot of shit and shovelware out there, but somehow, thanks to the internet, word of mouth,
1628740	1632020	what marketplaces feature, and so forth, we have a way to kind of sort through that, I
1632020	1633020	think.
1633020	1638100	So, and then when really crappy licensed things come out, like Yaris, you know, we figure
1638100	1639100	it out.
1639100	1640100	So, anyway.
1640100	1643900	All right, let's get into a little more current.
1643900	1647820	We won't do retro all night long, but we will revisit the Nintendo later in the show.
1647820	1650880	Frugal question of the week, as well as our list list tonight.
1650880	1654560	But I want to talk about our gaming weeks, get a little more current with what we've
1654560	1655560	been playing lately.
1655560	1657120	So, how is your gaming week?
1657120	1659120	Dark Sakura, starting with you.
1659120	1661920	I've been playing on some Dragon Age Inquisition.
1661920	1668040	I've played some Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer, but other than that, I really haven't
1668040	1673320	played a whole lot of much, just because I wanted to finish up my fanfic this week, which
1673320	1676480	I finally put the last chapter in.
1676480	1677480	Yay.
1678140	1681540	If you want to read my shit, tell me.
1681540	1684140	All right, go visit our chat room.
1684140	1685740	You can look at Dark Sakura's there.
1685740	1688660	You can just look up Dark Sakura on Archive of Our Own.
1688660	1691860	Oh, chapter five, entering the Bone Zone.
1691860	1692860	Stop it.
1692860	1693860	Don't write that kind of shit.
1693860	1694860	All right.
1694860	1697860	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1697860	1702240	This week, I would consider like the, it's like video game masturbation, it was basically
1702240	1703240	playing a bunch of games.
1703240	1704540	You were in the Bone Zone.
1704540	1705540	Pretty much.
1705600	1709240	It was pretty much just playing games for like no purpose whatsoever.
1709240	1710240	Just like I...
1710240	1711240	You know what games are for?
1711240	1714740	No, no, I understand that, but like I was trying to find a game that I could get into
1714740	1716680	and it wasn't really getting into anything.
1716680	1721960	Like I try, I started up, because I have the PC version of Final Fantasy VII, so I started
1721960	1726780	that up, you know, I was showing my son the game and he asked way too many fucking questions
1726780	1727780	about it.
1727780	1734060	And honestly, it doesn't seem, it didn't really hold up too well to me.
1734080	1737460	So I was like, eh, I don't really want to play this.
1737460	1742700	So I started up Final Fantasy VI instead, and I think that held up a lot better, but
1742700	1746680	once again, he ruined it by asking too many questions about it.
1746680	1747900	But I may start playing that.
1747900	1755100	I did play a lot of Minecraft for Windows 10, and I don't know, it's okay.
1755100	1760800	It runs well, but I was playing it on survival and I'm just kind of bored with it.
1760800	1762760	Like there's just no point to it at all.
1762760	1768200	I'm like, eh, I don't, it's not hard to survive and I just don't want to build stuff.
1768200	1772280	I mean, I don't want to make like this fancy structure or something like that.
1772280	1775720	And I was exploring, you know, caves and stuff and I got all the way down to the bottom there
1775720	1779960	and then I got knocked into the lava because of some stupid kickback from a zombie.
1779960	1783280	And I was like, fuck this, I don't want to play this anymore.
1783280	1784700	But then I went back and played it some more.
1784700	1789200	But it just, I get bored with it so fast and I just kind of lost the point.
1789200	1792720	Like playing it by yourself is just not as fun as playing it with other people.
1792720	1796240	And there seems to be like, the fact that it doesn't really have, I mean, it has like
1796240	1800280	a storyline and what you're supposed to do to kind of beat the game, but there's not
1800280	1802840	really much motivation to get you to do any of that.
1802840	1807760	And so there's kind of no point without finding something to do with friends.
1807760	1809040	So that was that.
1809040	1811040	And then what else did I play?
1811040	1813480	I think I played a little bit of Mario Maker, but very little.
1813480	1818360	I may have played through the 100 Mario thing and that was it.
1818360	1819360	Just once.
1819360	1822760	All right, there it is.
1822760	1823760	Moving on.
1823760	1824760	More gaming weeks.
1824760	1825760	How about you?
1825760	1826760	Who's got the mic over there?
1826760	1827760	Flaco.
1827760	1828760	Hello, I have the mic.
1828760	1829760	What did I play this week?
1829760	1830760	What did I play every week?
1830760	1831760	Splatoon.
1831760	1832760	Played a lot more Splatoon.
1832760	1835160	I'm at B plus 61 on ranked mode.
1835160	1837160	I just want to get the A minus so bad.
1837160	1839880	Did they do a big update this week or am I crazy?
1839880	1842020	I thought they did like a big balancing thing this week.
1842020	1843360	Was that this week or was it coming?
1843360	1847240	No, I don't think it's happened yet because I was still owning people with my blaster
1847240	1848240	this morning.
1848240	1849240	So that was pretty awesome.
1849240	1850240	But yeah.
1850240	1853160	I heard the rollers are getting a nerf and that upset me.
1853160	1854660	Everybody was getting a nerf.
1854660	1857600	I just came out to have a good time and I'm feeling very attacked by this.
1857600	1859720	Yeah, but I bet you don't play rollers like that.
1859720	1860720	Yeah.
1860720	1861720	Well, you see me.
1861720	1862720	You just roll.
1862720	1863720	You're good.
1863720	1864720	You're just rolling around.
1864720	1865720	You're doing the roller thing.
1865720	1866720	Thank you.
1866720	1867720	Once I get to know the map.
1867720	1868720	I know where to roll.
1868720	1870960	But I know if you just barely clip someone with the side of your roller, you kill them.
1870960	1872840	I think that's not going to happen anymore.
1872840	1876920	And, uh, so just, um, like something about the splatter and like, you gotta be right
1876920	1879320	in the middle of splatter to get them now instead of like getting them with the sides
1879320	1880320	or something like that.
1880320	1881320	I don't know.
1881320	1882320	I don't really play roller.
1882320	1883320	So I didn't focus on that.
1883320	1886480	I know the blasters splash damage is getting nerfed and I use that in tower control, but
1886480	1887480	it was great this morning.
1887480	1889880	I was still shooting at the tower, killing people without even aiming at them.
1889880	1890880	It was great.
1890880	1896400	Uh, so yeah, I played that I played, uh, Oh, Shane brought over Soma again last week.
1896400	1898240	So I'm playing a little bit Soma.
1898240	1900920	And then that's like the scary game of the now, right?
1900920	1902800	I guess it's not that scary.
1902800	1903800	It's cool.
1903800	1904800	I like the story.
1904800	1905800	It's really creepy, but it's not scary.
1905800	1910280	I wouldn't say it's really disturbing in places, but I wouldn't call it like a scary game.
1910280	1911640	So it's not jump scares or anything.
1911640	1912640	I think I did yell once.
1912640	1915360	I was like, ah, yeah, I said I did jump once.
1915360	1916840	Uh, that's a cool game.
1916840	1922000	And then he went and bought Jackbox party pack and brought that over and we played bomb
1922000	1923760	Corp and it was amazing.
1923760	1925640	And so, so much so that we were getting obsessed with it.
1925640	1926920	My wife and I were going to obsess with it.
1926920	1930720	And so then we add a little credits on our PlayStation accounts like let's just buy it.
1930720	1934160	So we bought the party back, but always played still as bomb Corp.
1934160	1938720	So we played that and we got through, I think we got to day six or seven or something.
1938720	1940520	Can you beat that game or does it just keep going?
1940520	1941520	I don't know.
1941520	1944240	We've gotten as far as day 10 and then we got, we, we just stopped because we got so
1944240	1945240	tired.
1945240	1946240	So we stopped playing.
1946240	1948400	We were like at the end of day 10 when we just didn't want to try one more time.
1948400	1951740	I think it's just two weeks cause there's a, there's a great story.
1951740	1952740	It's really funny.
1952740	1955720	Some of the best like comedy writing I think I've seen in a game.
1955720	1957860	So it was really funny.
1957860	1961480	And there's a storyline going on where this guy is there and he's going to be leaving
1961480	1964240	soon and that's his last day is day 10.
1964240	1966300	So I assume that's the last day of the game.
1966300	1967300	Oh, I didn't even know.
1967300	1970140	I didn't, we didn't even get as far like cause we were playing it.
1970140	1972900	Me Alan and Shane were all playing it this week and we did.
1972900	1976780	I, it's not revealed until the second week that this certain characters it's his last
1976780	1977780	week.
1977780	1978780	Oh no.
1978780	1980100	We were exploding on like Wednesday the first week.
1980100	1981480	Oh, Wednesday is the hardest day.
1981480	1982480	It's like you get through Monday.
1982480	1983480	Oh, this is not so bad.
1983480	1984480	Tuesday.
1984480	1985480	It's like, okay, a little harder.
1985480	1990040	Ratches all the way up cause like little kids start writing the clues and you're like, what?
1990040	1994400	Like get the book, like don't cut the wire if it's funky, but cut it if it's cool, but
1994400	1995400	not if it's wicked.
1995400	1996400	I'm like, what?
1996400	1999080	Blues are always wicked and reds are always cool.
1999080	2000720	I'm like, that doesn't make any sense.
2000720	2003440	The thing that I wasn't expecting cause you know, we, we had them on the show a couple
2003440	2004440	of weeks ago.
2004440	2005440	Right.
2005440	2006960	And I, I didn't even, I don't remember them even talking about this, but there's more
2006960	2011880	than just bomb cutting in it because then it's like filing the filing and key pads.
2011880	2012880	Yeah.
2012880	2014720	If you file it wrong, then the filing cabinet explodes.
2014760	2015760	Yeah.
2015760	2016760	Cause every, it's a warm court.
2016760	2017760	Everything explodes.
2017760	2019920	It's like, oh, you know, put this, put the number on the door and by the way, if you
2019920	2020920	get it wrong, it'll explode.
2020920	2021920	Uh, yeah.
2021920	2022920	File these files.
2022920	2024400	If you get it wrong, the file cabinet will explode.
2024400	2025400	Just don't question it.
2025400	2026400	It's just going to happen.
2026400	2029000	What I love is that if you fuck up, there's, there's like nothing.
2029000	2031280	There's no like EE, there's no like buzz.
2031280	2032920	It's just an instant on the TV.
2032920	2033920	Boom.
2033920	2034920	That's it.
2034920	2035920	You get nothing.
2035920	2036920	Everybody's like, what just happened?
2036920	2037920	What did we do wrong?
2037920	2038920	I thought we read this.
2038920	2039920	Oh, my wife's case.
2039920	2041200	She just gets, cuts the wires.
2041200	2042680	She's like, we can't decide which wire to cut.
2042680	2044680	She's like, oh, cut that one.
2044680	2045680	Sometimes it works.
2045680	2046680	So it's like, wow, that actually worked.
2046680	2051600	But then a lot of times it doesn't like, no, no, we're going to start all over.
2051600	2052600	Let's see.
2052600	2055240	So I played Palm Corp, which is amazing.
2055240	2056720	And I thought I played one more game this week.
2056720	2057720	Oh yeah.
2057720	2058720	Yoshi's wooly world.
2058720	2061160	I bought that and it was, it's really awesome.
2061160	2066220	I played through the entire first area and I'm on the second area now.
2066220	2069120	So that's where I'm at in that one in the kids love it.
2069120	2073560	We play with mellow mode on the kids and it's pretty cool cause like my son is getting
2073560	2077020	better at video games and this one he's figuring out pretty quick and like you can hold the
2077020	2079120	a button and just fly forever.
2079120	2080120	So you just fly around.
2080120	2081440	Oh, is that how mellow mode works?
2081440	2082440	That's how mellow mode works.
2082440	2085080	Like you have full health, like not all the time.
2085080	2088300	He still goes down, but you start with completely full hearts all the way.
2088300	2091480	And then when you press a to jump, you can just fly forever.
2091480	2092480	You have little wings.
2092480	2094040	Oh, she has little wings.
2094040	2097280	Like in Mario world, you could get the wings and fly if I remember right.
2097280	2098280	Oh, I don't remember.
2098280	2099280	I don't remember.
2099280	2100280	Yeah.
2100280	2101280	Yeah.
2101280	2102280	Okay.
2102280	2103280	Yeah.
2103280	2104280	So it's like that.
2104280	2106040	But yeah, I think it's a great game.
2106040	2109160	It's a simple little game, but you know, it's only like 40 bucks.
2109160	2111520	So I was like, that's great.
2111520	2112520	So I think that's all I played.
2112520	2113520	Oh yeah.
2113520	2117760	And of course, uh, Marvel puzzle quest on my phone because I played it all the time
2117760	2118760	still.
2118760	2122240	Uh, somebody posted in my Facebook this week that that came out for PlayStation four and
2122240	2123240	I had no idea.
2123240	2124240	Yeah.
2124240	2125240	Right.
2125240	2126240	I know.
2126240	2127240	Are you kidding me?
2127240	2128240	No, it's on my Facebook.
2128240	2129200	Oh my gosh.
2129200	2130200	I have to download that.
2130200	2131200	Can I transfer my stuff over from face?
2131200	2132200	I don't know.
2132200	2133200	Can you, can you, I don't know.
2133200	2135440	You can save your stuff on Facebook cause I switched phones.
2135440	2139920	I switched from an Android phone to an iPhone and I was able to switch my stuff over.
2139920	2142200	I might have to play again at least.
2142200	2143260	Well, I left your guilt.
2143260	2144260	So whatever.
2144260	2145260	Yeah, I can.
2145260	2147520	I went to a place where people actually played.
2147520	2150680	No, it's now I get so much more bonus stuff and it makes me want to play more.
2150680	2151680	So that's fair.
2151680	2152680	Yeah.
2152680	2153680	I'm getting lots of good covers.
2153680	2154680	It's great.
2154680	2155680	I love that game.
2155680	2156680	We have a vog community on PS four now.
2156680	2160480	Maybe I can scrape together enough people to maybe, I don't know, but if it's the same
2160480	2164760	information that I would still be in my same Alliance, maybe Rob didn't abandon me like
2164760	2165760	you did.
2165760	2166760	I don't know what that would be on.
2166760	2171080	No, I think he, I think he was the only one still playing, uh, but maybe I don't know
2171080	2172080	how that would play on a PS.
2172080	2173960	I guess you just move the control around and swap the gems.
2173960	2174960	It's not like there's a timer.
2174960	2177760	So I mean, puzzle quest was originally on the three 60.
2177760	2178760	Okay.
2178760	2179760	So there you go.
2179760	2180760	I never had a three 60.
2180760	2181760	So all right.
2181760	2182760	There you go.
2182760	2184840	Uh, Shane, how was your gaming week?
2184840	2188400	Basically all you have to do is rewind the episode to where Jim started talking and that's
2188400	2189400	my week too.
2189400	2191360	Cause we played the same thing.
2191360	2193880	Well, what are, what are your impressions on some of the things you talked about?
2193880	2198440	Like Yoshi's wooly world because that game is so amazing.
2198440	2199680	I love that game.
2199680	2203120	I love you guys aren't even talking about anything else cause we haven't played anything
2203120	2204120	else yet.
2204120	2209760	We just went straight to bomb Corp and it is seriously like probably my favorite Jack
2209760	2210760	box game.
2210760	2214560	I think it might be better than you don't know Jack for me at least.
2214560	2218760	Um, it's actually funnier, which is hard to top.
2218760	2223640	I do like that it's, it's very different and you know, we brought this up a couple of weeks
2223640	2224640	ago and we had them on too.
2224640	2228040	It's kind of was breaking the formula that you could kind of start to see in the first
2228040	2230480	game where it was not, not that it was bad.
2230480	2231480	I mean it works.
2231480	2235400	All those games are a lot of fun, but it was like everybody does this and then everybody
2235400	2237120	votes on result.
2237120	2239200	But bomb Corp is very different than that.
2239200	2240200	And I thought that was cool.
2240200	2244160	Um, I would do think though that bomb Corp is not for everybody because without naming
2244160	2252600	names, Rob, some people got frustrated while playing and it's a very frustrating game.
2252600	2254240	But it's, you don't want to see me heated.
2254240	2258720	I swear if we were to live stream bomb Corp, Oh my gosh, we couldn't, but we, we would
2258720	2263120	have to get, who are some ultra competitive people that I know, but it's not, it's cooperative.
2263120	2264120	That's why it's nice.
2264120	2266960	That's why it's like when you get the people to get really into it.
2267720	2269840	And you didn't even get to meet Kyle yet.
2269840	2272520	Kyle is exploding on Wednesday.
2272520	2275960	No, we got through Wednesday I thought because yeah, we got through Wednesday.
2275960	2276960	I don't know.
2276960	2277960	Yeah.
2277960	2283680	You didn't make it to like making coffee, which also explodes and the copy machine.
2283680	2284680	Yeah.
2284680	2286160	The copy machine's pretty good too.
2286160	2288240	Um, then Yoshi's wooly world.
2288240	2289240	I really like it.
2289240	2290520	It's so adorable.
2290600	2297160	I've got stars on all of the stages in the first world and I'd be one S which is ridiculous
2297160	2305320	to try to get everything in that and I'm on world two that's as far as I got, um, there's
2305320	2306320	my week.
2306320	2312840	I play a lot of Pokemon shuffle on my phone constantly, constantly dark soccer.
2312840	2314680	I'll get to it when I get to your week.
2314680	2315680	Okay.
2315680	2316680	Then my week.
2316680	2319160	Well, I'm only gonna talk about one game cause I got you something.
2319160	2320160	You did.
2320160	2321160	Oh yeah.
2321160	2322160	I didn't get around to playing it yet.
2322160	2323160	Yes.
2323160	2324160	Uh, but you did.
2324160	2327440	You bought me on steam, uh, uh, pigeon sex, the game.
2327440	2329440	That's what it is, right?
2329440	2330440	Hot to full boyfriend.
2330440	2331440	Yes.
2331440	2333120	Cause Rob has to see the crackness.
2333120	2334120	I want to play it.
2334120	2336000	I want to, I want to do a stream of it.
2336000	2341240	Make sure you do it though with the, um, the story playthroughs so that you can get a hateful
2341240	2342240	boyfriend.
2342240	2343240	Okay.
2343240	2344240	I will.
2344240	2345240	I will.
2345240	2347600	Uh, but I sadly, I did not get to enjoy that yet cause um, I had a pretty busy weekend
2347600	2352280	which we'll talk about in a minute, but um, I did play Yoshi's wooly world as well.
2352280	2355560	And I just want to talk about that game real quick because I wasn't going to get it originally
2355560	2359080	because I was like, you know, I don't know if, I don't know if it's really my thing,
2359080	2363800	but then Shane did his Shane thing where he was like, I could get it at a discount Rob
2363800	2367600	and you know, you're going to want the green amiibo and it's the only way I'm interrupting.
2367600	2371040	That was also part of our gaming week that neither me nor Jim talked about as we waited
2371040	2377040	in line at Best Buy for Yoshi's wooly world and the amiibo and the line consisted of just
2377040	2378040	us.
2378040	2379040	Oh my God.
2379040	2380040	No.
2380040	2381040	So nobody's lining up for amiibo anymore.
2381040	2382040	Yeah.
2382040	2383040	Yeah.
2383040	2386760	There was some people that showed up right at the end, but no, they only got like eight
2386760	2388320	of each color too.
2388320	2392800	So, um, and then some of the bundles, but yeah, we were in the store when I texted you
2392800	2394280	to see if you wanted it.
2394280	2395280	Yeah.
2395280	2396460	They're not continuing your story.
2396460	2401480	By texting me to see if I wanted it, meaning convincing me that I need it.
2401480	2402480	I will.
2402480	2406640	I will pull up my phone and see exactly what I said so you can see that.
2406640	2409880	But also then again, you did get Marth today and you said you didn't want any of the Fire
2409880	2410880	Emblem amiibo.
2410880	2413000	And then I was like, Oh, maybe I don't.
2413000	2414000	Marth looks kind of cool.
2414000	2415680	I'll regret not getting him if I don't get him.
2415680	2416680	Yes.
2416680	2417680	I got my 35th amiibo today.
2417680	2419600	I got Marth today.
2419600	2425000	He got me some stupid tracker program on, on the iPhone that you can use to track like
2425000	2426000	what you have in your collection.
2426000	2427000	There's a tracker?
2427000	2428000	Yeah.
2428000	2430560	I was like, I'm going to get to that point where I'm going to buy an amiibo and then
2430560	2432800	get home and be fucking pissed that I already own it.
2432800	2435480	I thought it was bad that I had, I think I have 16 now.
2435520	2441960	I have 35 and like I would, I would say 20, 25 of them have been in the past month because
2441960	2442960	of Shane.
2442960	2443960	Just, just putting it out there.
2443960	2444960	Oh, that's cool.
2444960	2448560	So anyway, Yoshi's wooly world where this whole thing was starting, right?
2448560	2453000	Um, I, I was very pleasantly surprised with Yoshi's wooly world.
2453000	2457560	I didn't think I'd like it, but I think it's a very solid platforming experience.
2457560	2464320	Um, it is, it is essentially Super Mario world to Yoshi's Island, but just now in this yarn
2464360	2466360	environment, which looks gorgeous.
2466360	2470640	I didn't, I didn't know how I would enjoy that, but, um, it does look really good.
2470640	2473680	It's still, I don't know, it's still a little weird for me.
2473680	2475200	I'm like, why is Yoshi a ball of yarn?
2475200	2476200	I don't get it.
2476200	2480520	But then I think, okay, if I was like seven or eight years old, this would be my favorite
2480520	2485760	game hands down because just, you know, the solid platforming elements of it, the, the
2485760	2489120	look of the game and those mechanics and so forth.
2489120	2494280	Like I just, I, I would love this if I was seven and I actually really like it at 30
2494280	2500120	seven, I think it's a very solid platformer and kind of hard, like not, I mean, you can
2500120	2502320	get from start to finish in the stages.
2502320	2503320	Pretty easy.
2503320	2507120	It's not that hard, but like, Oh my God, there's so much to complete.
2507120	2513200	There's the flowers, there's the yarn, there's the now instead of red coins, it's the Miiverse
2513200	2517280	stamps and they're all hidden in the levels amongst the regular gems or whatever it is.
2517280	2519600	And then there's the, you got to get to the end with full health.
2519600	2525480	I mean, to get a star on a level that's actually kind of hard and also infuriating when you're
2525480	2531640	just missing one goddamn Miiverse token to get a star on the whole damn level.
2531640	2540000	So I, I'm kind of surprised at how much depth the game has to be a very difficult game.
2540000	2543160	For a game that looks like a kiddie game, you know what I mean?
2543160	2546520	So yeah, I, I'm really enjoying Yoshi's Willy world.
2546560	2553720	And with the amiibo, I thought that was a cute tie-in because all it really is, you can in the game,
2553720	2559480	as you go through, if you get all the yarn in each level, there's five hidden chunks of yarn.
2559480	2562280	You can build one of Yoshi's missing friends.
2562280	2565200	For example, you might get Moo Moo Yoshi in one level.
2565200	2566760	That's a cow and it's adorable.
2566760	2567760	I mean, it really is.
2567760	2568760	Right.
2568760	2569760	I like the watermelon Yoshi.
2569760	2570760	Oh yeah.
2570760	2571760	It's adorable.
2571760	2572760	The circus Yoshi looks like a butthole to me.
2572760	2575560	Like, I don't know why they have, that looks really offensive.
2575600	2583640	I'm just saying, um, but what my, the sunflower one, the very first one you got, we're not
2583640	2584640	going to get into that.
2584640	2585640	Why?
2585640	2586640	All right.
2586640	2587640	And then, um, what was I going to say?
2587640	2589120	Uh, Oh, the amiibo.
2589120	2593920	So the amiibo unlock different skins for the Yoshi as well, that kind of look like the
2593920	2595460	character of the amiibo.
2595460	2597180	And some of them are really bad.
2597180	2600440	Like the Mr. Game and Watch is just a solid black Yoshi.
2600440	2601640	Like how boring is that?
2601640	2603140	Blackface Yoshi.
2603140	2604480	That's that's tacky.
2604600	2610040	Um, but the mega man one is super cute and it makes it like actually get like these little
2610040	2611520	like ears and so forth.
2611520	2614200	Uh, and the Sonic one is actually my favorite one.
2614200	2616200	Just like that blue is really cute.
2616200	2617200	That was my favorite.
2617200	2620040	I don't have Sonic, but I saw that one on YouTube and I'm like, that is amazing.
2620040	2621040	Looking at the red shoes.
2621040	2624040	It's just blue with red shoes, but it has the coloration of like, you know, his body
2624040	2625040	a little bit too.
2625040	2626040	It's so awesome.
2626040	2631080	That's awesome that they support, you know, amiibos from other games, unlike Splatoon
2631080	2632080	that does not.
2632200	2635800	Well, the weird thing is it pretty much does run with all the amiibo.
2635800	2637800	It even works with the Splatoon amiibo.
2637800	2640880	Duck Hunt Dog was my other favorite one, by the way, because actually no Pokemon.
2640880	2642660	There's no Pokemon.
2642660	2646120	And I don't know if that's because there's an issue, a game freak where it's like, we
2646120	2648920	don't want our characters to look different or something.
2648920	2652880	I have a weird feeling that's what comes into play where it's like, no, Pikachu is Pikachu
2652880	2654880	and Yoshi's not allowed to look like Pikachu.
2654880	2659600	I just, but yeah, the Pokemon don't work.
2659600	2660600	I know.
2660600	2661600	I know.
2662000	2663000	Very weird.
2663000	2665200	Go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.
2665200	2669920	Kaijuto says, little big planet is yarn, should be used to yarn by now.
2669920	2670920	Is it?
2670920	2672280	I don't remember it being yarn.
2672280	2673280	It's more like fabric.
2673280	2674280	It's more, it's fabric.
2674280	2675280	It's not yarn.
2675280	2676280	Yeah.
2676280	2677280	No, what's yarn?
2677280	2678280	It's literal sackcloth.
2678280	2679280	It's not yarn.
2679280	2680280	Yeah, it's like cloth.
2680280	2681280	It's canvas.
2681280	2682280	Yeah.
2682280	2683280	It's a rough burlap.
2683280	2686720	It's a trip to Joanne's fabrics, but you know, it's a little bit different.
2686720	2687720	I don't know.
2687720	2692000	SSJ100Matt says, I'm close to buying a pink yarn Yoshi for my girlfriend.
2692000	2694160	She doesn't own a Wii U, but she'll think it's cute.
2694160	2697600	I got to say those yarn Yoshi are done pretty darn well.
2697600	2700680	Those little yarn Yoshi amiibo, which the pink one is probably the only one you're going
2700680	2704400	to be able to find at this point, but they are really cute.
2704400	2706600	So all right, there it is.
2706600	2709640	That's going to do it for my gaming week.
2709640	2711640	Quickly some housekeeping.
2711640	2715040	We are going to be here for the next few weeks, although it sounds like we may not be here
2715040	2718840	Thanksgiving week, but I bet a lot of you guys probably won't be either, so that probably
2718840	2719840	won't be a big issue.
2719840	2724320	We'll get you posted on that a little closer to November.
2724320	2729660	Also we will be, Dark Soccer and I will be at GamerX in December in San Jose, so look
2729660	2730660	forward to that.
2730660	2733160	We were going to have a little table, which we're still trying to figure out what we're
2733160	2734160	going to do with it.
2734160	2737340	If you guys have suggestions, you should let us know, but I think I know what we might
2737340	2739340	do.
2739340	2742700	And then I just want to say like on a totally selfish, like unrelated note, but I have to
2742700	2744380	get this out of my system.
2744380	2746220	I was very honored yesterday.
2746220	2750420	This has nothing to do with games, so I apologize, but we had a convention here in Sacramento,
2750420	2753820	Sinister Creature Con yesterday, which was a first year con.
2753820	2757860	And it was pretty cool because they had like all the, it was a very random assortment of
2757860	2758860	guests.
2758860	2762700	Like they had a Kristen Bauer, I think her name is, she's Maleficent on Once Upon a Time
2762700	2764060	and she was in True Blood.
2764060	2765180	She's pretty cool.
2765180	2770740	And they had like some of the cast from Terror Vision and the kid from Pet Sematary was all
2770740	2771740	there.
2771740	2775540	And they also had three of the actors from the Rocky Horror Picture Show were there.
2775540	2780220	Barry Bostwick, who played Brad, Lil Nel, who played Columbia and Patricia Quinn, who
2780220	2781220	played Magenta, were actually-
2781220	2782220	Dame Patricia.
2782220	2784820	Lady Stevens, I think is, she's Lady.
2784820	2785820	Lady.
2785820	2787700	I thought she was, I thought she was Dame, Dame.
2787700	2788700	Mm-mm.
2788700	2789700	Okay.
2789700	2790700	That's Dame Edna.
2790700	2791700	No, I'm just kidding.
2791700	2792700	No, but no-
2792700	2793700	Who was in Shock Treatment.
2793700	2794700	I'll have to double check now because I thought she was.
2794700	2795700	I thought she was Lady.
2795700	2800860	But anyway, she is a Lady, but I will say this, and you guys that might know my history with
2800860	2804900	podcasting know that before I was doing Orange L'Andrea, I was doing a show called Under
2804900	2808100	Sedation Live, which is still on, but not for much longer.
2808100	2809100	It was only-
2809100	2810100	She is Lady.
2810100	2811100	She is Lady.
2811100	2812100	I didn't know that.
2812100	2813100	Okay.
2813100	2814100	Oh no, I'm sorry.
2814100	2815100	Yes.
2815100	2816100	I did know that.
2816100	2817100	All right.
2817100	2818100	Stop confusing me.
2818100	2821780	So before I was doing this, I was doing Under Sedation Live, which was about Rocky Horror
2821780	2823860	and I was big into that community.
2823860	2825060	So I was really honored.
2825060	2830060	I got to host the panel at this convention, a 40th anniversary celebratory panel with
2830060	2834460	these celebrities and I got to talk to them and introduce myself backstage and we actually
2834460	2837540	got to actually have this panel where we ask questions.
2837540	2839580	It was really well received.
2839580	2843420	So I just wanted to thank Sinister Creature Con for that experience because in some ways,
2843420	2848260	and I know this has nothing to do with gaming, but it kind of brings a lot of my hobbies
2848260	2850220	and things like that full circle.
2850220	2855260	To get to do that was just awesome and really put a point.
2855260	2860980	And it also showed me that maybe someday here on OLR, we can get some of the big gaming
2860980	2863520	celebrities I've always wanted to have on the show.
2863520	2866780	Like me personally, I want to have Sid Meier on someday because you all know how I feel
2866780	2868140	about civilization.
2868140	2869140	So that would be one of my dream guests.
2869140	2871940	Do you guys have any dream guests for OLR?
2871940	2874380	Like somebody we have to interview before we throw in the towel?
2874380	2877780	Reggie Fils-Aime, I think is on the bucket list.
2877780	2881780	Reggie would be funny.
2881780	2885500	I don't know.
2885500	2886860	Let's get Troy Baker.
2886860	2887860	Troy Baker.
2887860	2890500	Or what was his name?
2890500	2891980	We get a lot of awesome voice.
2891980	2893620	We have another voice actor on the show tonight.
2893620	2894620	Why not?
2894620	2895620	We're getting Tara Strong.
2895620	2897260	Let's get Tara Strong as well.
2897260	2898260	Do all three of them.
2898260	2899260	Why not?
2899260	2900420	How about you Darcyra?
2900420	2901860	It's got to be something Bioware.
2901860	2902860	Jennifer Hale.
2902860	2907220	Well, yeah, that would be cool, but I would actually like to get concept designers.
2907220	2908220	Okay.
2908220	2913020	Some of the actual people who work on the artwork who come up.
2913020	2915140	Actually I'd like Patrick Weeks.
2915140	2921500	I'd like some of the other writers at Bioware to come in.
2921500	2926900	Let's get Gabe Newell and he'll just announce Half-Life 3, but no one will know because
2926900	2929900	no one listens to the show.
2929900	2930900	That's right.
2930900	2932980	And no one's going to believe us anyways.
2932980	2934480	No one would believe us.
2934480	2938800	This dog and pony show known as Orange Lounge Radio that's dedicated to DDR, because they
2938800	2944720	just checked the website that's a little bit out of date, and says that Half-Life 3 could
2944720	2947560	claim to have Gabe on their show and that Half-Life 3 did.
2947560	2948560	Sure they did.
2948560	2949560	Sure they did.
2949560	2953120	But to be perfectly serious, I'd like some of the people who work behind the scenes who
2953120	2958400	maybe don't get the big recognition to come on the show and talk about what they do.
2958400	2963320	I think that there needs to be a bigger respect for the concept artists, for the design, for
2963320	2965480	the level layout, the music designers.
2965480	2969300	People need to, I think, hear about their contributions into the games that they like
2969300	2971200	instead of just the people at the top of the food chain.
2971200	2976760	Or just like Charles Martinet to have him do all the voices.
2976760	2977760	I would love that.
2977760	2978760	I was being serious.
2978760	2980600	No, I know, I know.
2980600	2981600	Let's see.
2981600	2985120	Going to our chat room, actually I love this answer, this is a completely serious answer
2985120	2986120	too.
2986120	2987120	Dungeon Buster, Richard Garriott.
2987120	2988120	Yes.
2988120	2989120	Oh my god, yes.
2989120	2991040	I love hearing that man speak at conventions.
2991040	2993200	I would love to have Lord British on the show.
2993200	2996240	Anyway, there it is, bucket list guests.
2996240	2999900	If you happen to know any contacts for any of these people, tell them about our little
2999900	3005840	dog and pony show and that we're a safe place to talk about whatever, because nobody listens.
3005840	3007600	I know who you need to get on here.
3007600	3008600	Who?
3008600	3010320	Mega Man.
3010320	3011320	Just actual Mega Man?
3011320	3012320	Just Mega Man, yeah.
3012320	3013320	Just actual Mega Man?
3013320	3014760	He's been in a lot of games, so he would probably have a lot to talk about.
3014760	3016400	Well, he's probably pretty bored right now, actually.
3016400	3017760	Yeah, you could have talked about his-
3017760	3018760	He's unemployed.
3018760	3019760	He's unemployed right now.
3019760	3022160	You could talk about his little known soccer career.
3022160	3023160	There you go.
3023160	3024160	Yeah.
3024160	3025160	Yeah.
3025160	3026160	We'll get Mega Man on the show.
3026160	3027160	We'll work on that.
3027160	3030240	All right, let's get into some gaming news for the week.
3030240	3034000	We still have a pretty, it was a pretty slow news week, admittedly, but we still have a
3034000	3037880	lot of ground to cover, so Loki's starting us off, I think, with some rumors, yes?
3037880	3039780	Of course.
3039780	3045640	It's another week, so there's another week of Nintendo NX rumors, and this week's rumor
3045640	3052160	is that the dev kits are going out, which I guess that makes sense since, you know,
3052160	3054800	isn't this supposed to be coming out next year or something like that?
3054800	3058200	I mean, 2016's the year of gaming, right?
3058200	3064920	Yeah, so unfortunately, we don't know too much about it, but apparently, people are
3064920	3069640	seeing the dev kits, and they're saying that it's kind of a combination of like a portable
3069640	3072440	and home console combined.
3072440	3075200	I don't know.
3075200	3077920	So it's an all-in-one combo system.
3077920	3078960	Something like that, yes.
3078960	3085640	So yeah, and they're basically saying that, you know, it could be that there's a secondary
3085640	3091440	piece of the NX that could be like a Wii U gamepad or handheld or something like that,
3091440	3092440	so they're not sure.
3092440	3095400	I'm wondering if they're like thinking it's, I don't know, because I always thought they
3095400	3099480	would be cool if the gamepad could be like a portable system, so maybe that's kind of
3099480	3104040	what they're doing with that, where it is, it's like a, you know, 3DS hardware built
3104040	3108440	into it or something, I don't know.
3108440	3109440	I guess we'll see.
3109440	3114960	I hope it's good, and the other rumor I saw was it's cutting edge, you know, technology
3114960	3120640	or something like that, so I hope that's true, because I would love to see like another kind
3120640	3124120	of Wii, you know, disturbance thing, you know, where they just kind of...
3124120	3125840	Okay, here's the thing with that, though.
3125840	3130320	I just want to caution people, because some people that are reading really a lot into
3130320	3133240	that are forgetting something very important.
3133240	3138000	When the Wii U was announced, when the Wii U came out, the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox
3138000	3139000	One were not out yet.
3139000	3141640	Remember, the Wii U got a one-year head start on the others.
3141640	3147640	The Wii U was ahead of the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, but not by much.
3147640	3148640	You know what I mean?
3148640	3152800	It didn't ultimately end up mattering, so I just, I want to caution people to get too
3152800	3155080	excited about that.
3155080	3156080	Not necessarily.
3156080	3158840	It wasn't ahead of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
3158840	3165240	It was supposed to be, spec-wise, maybe stronger than them, but it still can't run the engines
3165240	3166800	that even those systems can run.
3166800	3171440	Like it can't do Frostbite, for example, that's why you don't have a lot of those, you know,
3171440	3173200	Battlefield games and stuff like that on there.
3173200	3175900	It just can't run them.
3175900	3181280	So I don't think, even though the specs may be up there, it's just, it's not able to run...
3181280	3183320	It's about equivalent to those systems, maybe.
3183320	3184360	You know what's interesting, though?
3184360	3190400	If it is one of these handheld and combo, well, you know, Nintendo's always been very
3190400	3193400	good about backwards compatible games, and we've always kind of been wondering, like,
3193400	3195800	how's Wii U's successor going to emulate Wii U games?
3195800	3199560	Well, if it does end up being a combo system, that's going to emulate Wii U games pretty
3199560	3201840	easy, isn't it?
3201840	3204720	Because the game pad or whatever would be like your...
3204720	3210340	It sounds to me like it's a more powerful Wii U where the game pad truly works anywhere,
3210340	3212400	or by itself, essentially.
3212400	3216280	Like you could take it and use it anywhere as its own system.
3216280	3220920	It would be nice to take that someplace and be able to play games on it and then bring
3220920	3221920	it back home.
3221920	3225160	But I'm curious if it couldn't be, like, separated as well.
3225160	3229960	Like, does that mean Nintendo is going to sell a console and, I mean, are they going
3229960	3231960	to sell it separately or are they going to sell it as a combo?
3231960	3232960	I don't know.
3232960	3233960	It's just a lot of unanswered questions.
3233960	3234960	We'll see, I guess.
3234960	3235960	Yeah.
3235960	3236960	I don't...
3236960	3243200	Like, you know, usually I'm like, rumors, whatever, but a lot of this seems like a logical
3243200	3245660	next step for Nintendo.
3245660	3251920	It's interesting, though, that when some people are like, the Wii U was not, you know, very
3251920	3256120	successful, it's interesting that they're going to go all in on it, essentially.
3256120	3257120	I hope they do.
3257120	3258560	This is the vision for it.
3258560	3263680	Please, God, have someone that knows what they're doing network-wise because, like,
3263680	3268040	seriously, this, like, antiquated bullshit, you know, where they're just starting to figure
3268040	3271560	out how to do all this stuff, that needs to end.
3271560	3274920	They need to, like, forget that happened and be on board with what's going on now.
3274920	3278280	Well, and one big thing they'll end up doing that's going to put it in a huge position,
3278280	3280600	you know they're going to change the name, drastically.
3280600	3282280	The new name will not be Wii anything.
3282280	3286760	It's going to be a brand new something we haven't thought of.
3286760	3288320	It could be another made-up word.
3288320	3292280	It could be another very simple thing like Wii, but it's not going to be NX.
3292280	3294320	These development names never stick.
3294320	3300040	So, it could be another, like, weird simple made-up word, but it could be like the Nintendo
3300040	3304320	Go, because it's on the go.
3304320	3305760	It could be something very simple.
3305760	3306760	No, please don't.
3306760	3307760	We had a PSP Go.
3307760	3308760	That's true.
3308760	3309760	Nintendo.
3309760	3310760	Nintendo!
3310760	3318160	I always thought they should just go back to its roots and just call it a Nintendo
3318160	3320040	Entertainment System.
3320040	3321040	Why not?
3321040	3322880	They're always playing the Nintendo.
3322880	3323880	That's right.
3323880	3324880	Take that word back.
3324880	3325880	All right.
3325880	3330520	Act deft and chat says Nintendo Go, Pokemon Go, oh God.
3330520	3333840	You know, though, if this handheld device is something that works anywhere, imagine
3333840	3336000	what if it has cellular capability in it.
3336000	3337000	It might.
3337000	3338000	It will probably at least be Wi-Fi.
3338000	3339000	Oh my God.
3339000	3342440	Imagine how many pedophiles are going to have access to your children.
3342440	3344600	Oh God.
3344600	3347600	But it, it, it, the other interesting thing, and I have to get this out of my system, the
3347600	3352560	other very interesting thing about the fact, if the tech is superior to PlayStation 4 and
3352560	3357640	Xbox One and meaning like by a significant amount, it's going to be interesting if
3357640	3364320	Nintendo forces this cycle to move faster than Sony and Microsoft originally planned.
3364320	3366980	Because that could be a very interesting side effect of this.
3366980	3371320	If Nintendo is very successful with this and people start developing games for Nintendo
3371320	3378040	system that won't work on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, it's going to force the PlayStation
3378040	3383020	5 and the Microsoft successor out faster than maybe they intended.
3383020	3386520	And I know I'm being very tinfoil hat-ish right now, but I think that could be a very
3386520	3387520	interesting side effect.
3387520	3388520	If Nintendo is successful.
3388520	3389960	No, I don't think so.
3389960	3393480	I don't think it's going to affect anything because they're all kind of doing their own
3393480	3394480	thing.
3394480	3400160	I mean, we'll see where the VR stuff goes because what if that takes off and then who,
3400160	3401160	I don't know.
3401200	3404200	I don't know really where it's going to go.
3404200	3405200	We'll just have to wait and see.
3405200	3406400	That's what's kind of fun about it.
3406400	3411960	Let's wait and see and have no expectations so we can't be let down because they will
3411960	3412960	do that.
3412960	3413960	Alright.
3413960	3421320	Well, otherwise, it's just rumors and we'll find out when we hear at E3 2016.
3421320	3425080	It seems inevitable that this is going to be a huge highlight of the show.
3425080	3431080	Well, a little sooner than next year's E3, Halo 5 is going to come out really soon.
3431080	3434840	Halo 5 is out, what, just a couple of weeks, right?
3434840	3440960	There is some free DLC available for Halo 5 and you actually don't need, well, obviously
3440960	3443960	it's free because you don't need to spend any money on it, but you do have to spend
3443960	3445480	a little bit of time.
3445480	3449640	So there's an interactive site that 343 Industries and Microsoft has put out there where your
3449640	3456240	Master Chief versus Spartan Lock and there's five videos dedicated to each person's point
3456240	3457240	of view.
3457240	3462400	You sit through the ten, and they're less than ten second clips, I guess, you are rewarded
3462400	3464560	with a free Rec Pack.
3464560	3466640	That's Halo 5's microtransactions.
3466640	3472680	They're two dollars, I guess, but 343 swears, you get the currency fast enough you don't
3472680	3474880	have to necessarily spend actual money.
3474880	3479040	So why even make it a microtransaction in the first place?
3479040	3481480	Because you're willing to spend the money.
3481480	3483920	They aren't incentivizing you to buy that stuff.
3483920	3488000	I'm sure people that are super into Halo and the lore anyway are going to sit through this
3488000	3491320	what adds up to what, like three minutes worth of videos.
3491320	3495600	So it's fine, I don't think it's too big a video.
3495600	3499760	I am all for a little extra something for free.
3499760	3505960	But yeah, hopefully you're not having to spend a lot of money on top of the $60 as it is
3505960	3506960	already.
3506960	3512780	Bonds006 in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, dear room, I want that damn new Halo
3512780	3513780	game.
3513820	3514820	A lot of people do.
3514820	3516260	I don't think you are alone in that.
3516260	3517260	Just saying.
3517260	3518260	You're in good company.
3518260	3519260	DarkSakura.
3519260	3522220	Well, we love our Humble Bundle, don't we?
3522220	3526660	Yes, I just bought the Capcom one this week.
3526660	3527660	So did I.
3527660	3529180	Dan already had like most of the games in it.
3529180	3531980	I didn't even mention that during my game of the week, but I played Ultra Street Fighter
3531980	3532980	4 on my PC.
3532980	3533980	Cool.
3533980	3536620	I forgot to mention the game I played, but I'm not going to mention it though.
3536620	3538860	So I actually had a developer give me a game.
3538860	3540820	Oh, well, then don't bring it up.
3540820	3541820	All right.
3541820	3542820	Oh, so did I.
3542860	3546860	I was given a game too, but I haven't started it yet.
3546860	3549860	Well, everybody here is special but me.
3549860	3557060	Well, Humble Bundle, as a lot of us know, they do the pay what you want for games, and
3557060	3564220	you can have the money be distributed between the developer, Humble Bundle, or the charity.
3564220	3570860	Well, they actually, I think, have been bitten a little bit in the butt by this because they
3570860	3574900	had to let go some of their employees.
3574900	3583780	They just, it says that their hiring was too ambitious and they had to make a hard call.
3583780	3592580	It says that they let off, let about 12 people go, which, I mean, 12 people is a lot for
3592580	3594260	a smaller company.
3594260	3598220	So I would say that if you don't want to see this happening, then make sure that you
3598220	3602860	just contribute a little bit more fundage toward them.
3602860	3609620	I try to make sure that I split things about 50-50 between Humble Bundle and the charity
3609620	3614380	if it's a developer that I'm pissed off at.
3614380	3616540	Usually I'll do them in equal thirds.
3616540	3619780	So that's it.
3619780	3628020	Yeah, I guess sometimes even companies that are very charitable can end up in these predicaments,
3628060	3633780	especially if it's true that they were overstaffed, but, you know, they do a lot of good stuff
3633780	3637140	out there, especially with the charity work, so it's difficult to hear about this, but
3637140	3642260	I understand if it's too heavy, then they're not able to effectively give the money to
3642260	3643260	the charities.
3643260	3645260	So, yeah, that could be bad.
3645260	3647460	So, all right.
3647460	3648460	Moving on.
3648460	3649460	Loki.
3649460	3650460	All right.
3650460	3654660	And so, funny enough, I was looking at Ingress and now I'm talking about the company that
3654660	3656820	makes Ingress, Niantic.
3656820	3662500	They've got some funding now for Pokemon Go thanks to Nintendo and the Pokemon Company.
3662500	3664780	$20 million!
3664780	3668620	That's definitely going to help them out and it'll be interesting to see how they use that
3668620	3676820	money to make this kind of, I don't know, real world Pokemon game.
3676820	3681300	Along with that, though, they said with the $20 million investment, apparently if they're
3681300	3688380	eligible to make another $10 million, if they meet its milestones as well.
3688380	3691900	So they could essentially make $30 million off Pokemon Go.
3691900	3695420	When I don't, you know, and people ask, how do they make money off Ingress?
3695420	3696420	I don't know.
3696420	3697420	I don't know.
3697420	3700060	Well, it was a Google project for the longest time and Google, I don't, how's Google funding
3700060	3701700	the self-driving cars?
3701700	3705780	They just, they have money in the bank that they're spending on these pet projects.
3705780	3711020	But now that Niantic's more off on their own, you know, they're having to, I guess, come
3711020	3714340	up with the other funding, although, you know, again, just to acknowledge Ingress does
3714340	3715820	have like sponsorships in it.
3715820	3720700	Some of the names of the items are called like named after companies, but it's just
3720700	3721700	a few.
3721700	3726060	There's not a lot, but there was one, uh, like about six months ago, every Jamba Juice
3726060	3728460	was a portal, but then they removed that.
3728460	3730340	The Jamba Juices are no longer all portals.
3730340	3731660	Yeah, I know.
3731660	3732660	Right.
3732660	3735860	Used to, uh, used to be an excuse for me to go get one of those pumpkin smoothies, but
3735860	3736860	whatever.
3736860	3739580	So, uh, yeah, I don't know.
3739620	3743420	Well, I know a lot of people that are really excited about Pokemon Go.
3743420	3746580	Uh, Shane, you're a big Pokemon fan.
3746580	3749820	Are you going to check out Pokemon Go, especially now that you've actually dabbled in Ingress
3749820	3750820	a little bit?
3750820	3751820	Yeah, I'll try it.
3751820	3752820	Yeah.
3752820	3756060	Um, I want to see like how ridiculous it is.
3756060	3761180	So like, will I have to drive to Montana to get to a certain Pokemon or will everything
3761180	3765220	kind of be available around me or how it's going to work?
3765220	3769100	I just need more details before I really feel like I can jump in.
3769140	3772380	I'm really excited about the beta test and I hope it's true that Ingress players are
3772380	3773580	going to get the jump on that.
3773580	3774580	I play Ingress.
3774580	3776220	Can I have a beta test?
3776220	3779260	You actually, you might, you might have to be a certain level, but I don't know.
3779260	3781740	That better not be the case.
3781740	3782740	We'll see.
3782740	3786980	Um, but, uh, yeah, I know a lot of Ingress players, there's even a lot of chat amongst
3786980	3787980	that group.
3787980	3793980	Like, so who's going to end up not playing anymore because of Pokemon and most people
3793980	3796020	I talked to say they're going to play both.
3796020	3802100	Probably most of the people that are on the blue side and hey, you guys even it out a
3802100	3803100	little bit.
3803100	3804100	Just even it out.
3804100	3805100	Yeah.
3805100	3806100	I think it's, I think it's a little bit, a little bit of both.
3806100	3807100	Uh, let's see.
3807100	3811940	Act Efton chat over at live.vognotework.com says, I know I'm excited for Pokemon Go despite
3811940	3812980	I don't play Ingress.
3812980	3814500	My brother though, he's Ingress junkie.
3814500	3815500	Yeah.
3815500	3818420	Funny how I forgot to mention that during my gaming week about how much Ingress I played
3818420	3819420	this week.
3819420	3821220	There's a reason why I stopped talking about it.
3821220	3822220	Yeah.
3822220	3825500	Uh, and Akuma JP in chat says, I've tried Ingress.
3825500	3827300	I have no idea what to do.
3827300	3833940	It isn't the easiest concept to pick up at first, but essentially you have resonators,
3833940	3838060	you have bursters, resonators is how you capture things.
3838060	3839540	Bursters is how you blow up the other.
3839540	3843420	Just watch like some, a couple of YouTube videos on like, uh, getting started with it.
3843420	3845980	And actually if you play through the tutorial, it'll kind of walk you through it.
3845980	3848780	Cause that when I first got into, I was like, eh, I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing,
3848780	3850200	but I have a better idea now.
3850200	3855060	It really helps to be at a park or a place where there's likely to be portals when you're
3855060	3856060	learning the game.
3856060	3857060	It'll help you a lot.
3857060	3858060	I think.
3858060	3859060	Or at work.
3859060	3860060	Yeah.
3860060	3861540	Or, or with coworkers who can explain it to you.
3861540	3862540	Absolutely.
3862540	3863540	All right.
3863540	3864540	Uh, let's see.
3864540	3867540	Bonds double six says, I was wondering if real world malls and cities would have some
3867540	3868540	perks.
3868540	3871980	Well, I mean the malls all here have several portals at them.
3871980	3876060	So if Niantic is just going to use the same database for Ingress as they're going to use
3876060	3880100	in Pokemon go, then I would think, yeah, a lot of malls and things are going to have
3880100	3881300	tons of Pokemon.
3881300	3886300	But this also means cemeteries are going to be the place to get, which is where I want
3886300	3887300	to go.
3887300	3890060	But I see where that starts to get a little weird.
3890060	3891780	No, I don't.
3891780	3892780	I want to go tonight.
3892780	3897140	She wouldn't go play Ingress at the cemetery tonight.
3897140	3900060	I'm already planning on stopping a few places on the way home.
3900060	3901540	I've got a fucking problem.
3901540	3904820	I seriously, why am I looking at a map?
3904820	3906260	Why do I have it turned on my phone?
3906260	3907260	I have a problem.
3907260	3910220	I need serious help.
3911180	3912180	I can relate.
3912180	3913820	It's an addictive game.
3913820	3914820	It really is.
3914820	3915820	All right.
3915820	3917740	I took work off Tuesday, by the way.
3917740	3918740	Did you?
3918740	3920500	Originally I wasn't playing Ingress, but I'm actually going to work on my costume.
3920500	3921500	I still only play some Ingress.
3921500	3922500	You're going to do both.
3922500	3923500	You know you're going to do both.
3923500	3924500	Eleven hours of Ingress.
3924500	3925500	All right.
3925500	3930940	Moving on, let's talk about something a lot more old school, but still very Nintendo.
3930940	3932420	Donkey Kong Jr.
3932420	3934100	Whatever happened to Donkey Kong Jr.?
3934100	3939020	I mean, because Donkey Kong kind of split off into the whole Donkey Kong Country universe,
3939020	3943260	and then there was Diddy Kong and Dixie Kong and all that, but whatever happened to Donkey
3943260	3944420	Kong Jr.?
3944420	3949820	Well, if you believe trademark-related things, a new trademark has been filed for Donkey
3949820	3951260	Kong Jr.
3951260	3954260	This was found, of course, on the United States trademark website, and that's how people snoop
3954260	3955620	around and find all this stuff.
3955620	3957480	It was filed just over a month ago.
3957480	3964060	It was filed by Nintendo of America under, quote, downloadable electronic game programs,
3964060	3968500	downloadable electronic video game software, electronic game programs, electronic game
3968500	3972340	software, video game programs, and video game software.
3972340	3975980	So could this mean that Donkey Kong Jr. is due for a revival?
3975980	3977380	I would say no.
3977380	3980660	It's probably just that Donkey Kong Jr. is coming to Virtual Console, because I don't
3980660	3981940	think it's on Virtual Console.
3981940	3983060	I could be wrong.
3983060	3984460	I don't think it is.
3984460	3988980	So that seems like the easier answer is that they're just renewing it because Donkey Kong
3988980	3991460	Jr. will be on Virtual Console.
3991460	3996580	But it could also be, what if Donkey Kong Jr. is one of the new Smash Brothers characters?
3996580	3997580	Could be.
3997580	3998580	So you never know.
3998580	4001740	They might, you know, the character might end up showing up somewhere else.
4001740	4004820	Would you guys be interested in a revival of Donkey Kong Jr.?
4004820	4005820	No.
4005820	4006820	No?
4006820	4007820	I like the arcade game, but...
4007820	4008820	It was okay.
4008820	4009820	I like the Coleco...
4009820	4012260	I think I had it on Coleco.
4012260	4014220	I liked that one.
4014220	4015220	But I...
4015220	4016220	No.
4016220	4017220	Not really.
4017220	4018220	Just...
4018220	4019420	What I would like to see them do is something new.
4019420	4020420	Or...
4020420	4021420	I don't know.
4021420	4022420	A new Metroid or...
4022420	4023420	I don't know.
4023420	4024420	A new F-Zero would be nice.
4024420	4025980	Do we need another fucking Donkey Kong game?
4025980	4027540	I mean, seriously.
4027540	4030420	They just put out one on the Wii U not too long ago.
4030420	4031420	Cool.
4031420	4034260	Let's go to another franchise you haven't touched for a while.
4034260	4040100	Alan Alchemy in chat with a little FYI saying Diddy Kong was originally Jr., but Nintendo
4040100	4044660	forced the name change because he didn't look anything like the overalls Jr. Nintendo already
4044660	4047460	came up with, if I recall correctly.
4047460	4048460	And if I...
4048460	4052180	Rare had developed Donkey Kong Country, so maybe Nintendo is being very protective of
4052180	4057240	the character saying, this looks nothing like Donkey Kong Jr., so you can't name him that.
4057240	4060380	So maybe that's part of how things got split off.
4060380	4063380	But it would be interesting if Nintendo revisited that world.
4063380	4069060	You know, I could expect that Nintendo's gonna surprise us, you know, now that we've seen
4069060	4071020	that original IPs work.
4071020	4075260	Not that necessarily Donkey Kong Jr.'s original, but, you know, if they're not gonna end up
4075260	4078140	doing another Donkey Kong Country game, maybe they're gonna take a strong character and
4078140	4083460	still come up with some type of new platforming type of thing, so that it's different than
4083460	4084900	the country universe we're used to.
4084900	4085900	I don't know.
4085900	4087900	Any thoughts, Donkey Kong Jr.?
4087900	4090620	I barely remembered it when I was talking about it earlier tonight.
4090620	4094380	I think it would be interesting, though, if Mario is the villain again.
4094380	4098380	That's the other thing that is it, you know, remember, Mario was the villain in those games.
4098380	4099380	Would they do that?
4099380	4100380	They would never do that now.
4100380	4101380	I don't know.
4101380	4103380	They'd just make it Wario or something.
4103380	4104380	Yeah, that's true.
4104500	4106860	It'd probably end up being Wario.
4106860	4109260	Or Mario is under influence.
4109260	4114300	You find out that the whole time, Mario is under a spell of somebody else.
4114300	4116220	That'll be how they work their way out of it.
4116220	4122260	Why don't they have, like, a Wario Waluigi equivalent of Princess Peach?
4122260	4123260	I thought they did.
4123260	4124260	A bad girl?
4124260	4126540	Yeah, like a bad female character.
4126540	4127540	Wasn't there a bad Daisy?
4127540	4128540	I thought there was.
4128540	4129540	I don't remember.
4129540	4130540	Maybe I'm crazy.
4130540	4131540	I don't know.
4131700	4135940	Daisy was in Mario Land, which Wario was the villain in, but...
4135940	4143220	I always liked Waluigi's name as a pun, because it always makes me think Wari isn't bad.
4143220	4144220	Oh, okay.
4144220	4145220	Yeah.
4145220	4146220	But...
4146220	4150220	Alan Alchemy says, that's who Petsch is, Princess Petsch.
4150220	4152380	I thought I thought there was a bad princess.
4152380	4153380	No.
4153380	4159500	No, Petsch was a person's, uh, crap, me.
4159500	4160500	Oh.
4160500	4161500	Never mind.
4162460	4164460	I posted that ages ago on my...
4164460	4165460	Princess Petsch is a meme.
4165460	4166460	Yeah, I was gonna say Princess Petsch.
4166460	4167460	I'm gonna find it.
4167460	4168460	It's on my Tumblr somewhere.
4168460	4171620	Princess Petsch sounds like, you know, Sanic or, you know, Danky Kang.
4171620	4173260	Danky Kang.
4173260	4176060	I don't remember seeing Princess Petsch as a Jeopardy answer.
4176060	4178860	We could make a cool bad girl princess in the Mario universe.
4178860	4179860	That would be awesome.
4179860	4183540	Excuse me if I can't keep up with the 5,000 memes that are out there on the internet.
4183540	4184540	Alright.
4184540	4185540	Anyhow.
4185540	4188020	Oh, Alan Alchemy is giving me a link here.
4188020	4189300	Hold on.
4189300	4190300	So let me see.
4190300	4194820	Apparently I'm being exposed to a meme for the first time, or I'm gonna go, oh, that.
4194820	4197140	Oh, yeah, I've seen that.
4197140	4198140	Okay.
4198140	4199140	That's a meme?
4199140	4200140	Really?
4200140	4201140	Yeah.
4201140	4202140	Yeah, okay.
4202140	4203140	It's just somebody's me character.
4203140	4205420	It's, and their face is just smushed together.
4205420	4206420	Whatever.
4206420	4208780	That's not even funny.
4208780	4212740	He had just posted it the same time I found my, uh, thing on Facebook.
4212740	4215640	That's not nearly as funny as the Wat Lady.
4215640	4217940	And Lonk.
4217940	4219220	Or Danky Kang.
4219220	4223900	Yeah, my, um, my, uh, Tumblr link in there has Lonk.
4223900	4226020	And someone's fanart of the two of them.
4226020	4230340	Alright, moving on, DarkSakura, please take us out of meme territory.
4230340	4231340	No.
4231340	4233540	I'm trying to get us deeper into it.
4233540	4240980	So, um, there is a little bit of flak 2K, uh, Games is Taking.
4240980	4248300	Uh, they tried to bring in, uh, one of the journalists from, uh, Giant Bomb, Jeff Girtzman,
4248300	4254420	who has a role called Dr. Tracksuit, that he uses to promote PAX Wrestling events.
4254420	4264300	Um, well, they made a likeness of him in WWE 2K6, and it was in their trailer, and so he
4264300	4269420	caught a view of it, and was like, hey, that's not cool, I didn't give anyone permission
4269420	4270420	for this.
4270420	4275220	In fact, the actual tweet says, kind of not okay with someone, uh, using something similar
4275220	4281340	to my likeness to promote a franchise that has been so terrible for so long.
4281340	4289100	Well, they changed the, uh, the, uh, preview and removed the portion out of it.
4289100	4290100	Mmm.
4290100	4291660	That's almost an admission of guilt.
4291660	4297540	Yeah, I hope that they've learned their lesson, but I'm sure there's gonna be a way to recreate
4297540	4299740	them in the actual game.
4299740	4300740	So.
4300740	4304540	Um, was, did they punch him in the face in the trailer?
4304540	4306380	Like did this guy give him a bad review?
4306380	4307860	It's insane, I didn't watch it.
4307860	4310820	They wanted to suplex him in the video like he was a train?
4310820	4316320	See I rather, uh, agree with his opinion of the franchise.
4316320	4318020	So I won't play it.
4318020	4321420	I will not, I will not play that Sam I am.
4321420	4323940	Even with Green Eggs and Ham.
4323940	4325500	Fair enough.
4325500	4330500	Uh, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says he's only showed up coming down the entrance ramp.
4330500	4334420	Okay, so, cause I thought maybe like he'd given the game a bad review, so they punched
4334420	4337900	him in the face in the trailer and I would have thought like, well that's pretty clever
4337900	4340500	but that's also really, really wrong.
4340500	4344460	So I guess it's for the best it ended up being, um, changed.
4344460	4347780	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of games that
4347780	4350700	are coming out, uh, this next week.
4350700	4353300	Starting with the US, Loki.
4353300	4357140	So there's, we're in the thick of it, so there's a lot of games coming out this week.
4357140	4362380	Um, starting off with Guitar Hero Live will be making its way up finally.
4362380	4365420	I played a demo of that at a Target.
4365420	4367940	I do not like what they did with the controller.
4367940	4371140	I guess it's innovative but it's not fun.
4371140	4372420	Have you seen the controller?
4372420	4373820	I haven't.
4373820	4375900	They have the frets, there's six of them.
4375900	4376900	There's three.
4376900	4377900	Three and two rows.
4377900	4382940	Yeah, and it's so weird to try to move your fingers back and forth because, you know,
4382940	4387060	you either have to hit one row or the other row and it's just, it doesn't feel good but
4387060	4388260	maybe that's how real guitar is.
4388260	4389420	I don't really know.
4389420	4393660	Um, yeah, I don't know, I don't play guitar so I can't really say.
4393660	4402060	But yeah, Guitar Hero Live coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and
4402060	4403060	Wii U.
4403060	4410620	Also, coming out this week, Just Dance 2016 on pretty much all platforms.
4410620	4414540	Gravity Falls, they're having a game come out on 3DS.
4414540	4417140	Let's see.
4417140	4422580	And then, I'm not sure if this is accurate or not, but they have a Halo 5 Guardians limited
4422580	4425860	collector's edition on Xbox One that's coming out this week.
4425860	4429780	Although I know Halo 5 actually comes out next week, so I'm not positive if this is
4429780	4435120	something, if you spend $250 you get it a week early or if it's just an incorrect date.
4435120	4440260	I'm willing to bet it's an incorrect date but, you know, just thought I'd mention it.
4440260	4445380	Tales of Zestiria is coming out on PlayStation 3 and also collector's edition on PlayStation
4445380	4450060	4 and I believe a regular edition on PlayStation 4 as well.
4450060	4458980	Just Dance Disney Party 2 coming out on Xbox 360 and Wii U and Wii and I believe PlayStation
4458980	4459980	3.
4459980	4472180	Also, Adventure Time Finn and Jake Investigations on PlayStation 4, 3DS, Wii U and Xbox 360.
4472180	4476740	Let's see, there's a lot of games coming out.
4476740	4482060	Dragon Ball Z Extreme Butoden coming out on 3DS.
4482060	4487740	Hasbro Family Fun Pack on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4487740	4493900	They're doing like a combo pack for Disney games, Frozen and Big Hero 6, kind of a re-release
4493900	4495900	there.
4495900	4502780	Let's see what else we have coming out.
4502780	4505740	Guitar Hero once again, with that, Guitar Hero Live they're also doing like a bundle
4505740	4510220	pack with two guitars as well in case you want an additional guitar on top of the one
4510220	4511660	that it comes with.
4511660	4516620	And Just Dance 2016 Gold Edition, they're putting out a special edition for that as
4516620	4517620	well.
4517620	4521620	I believe that's, oh wait, nope, nope.
4521620	4523540	Doing these crappy Sunday releases.
4523540	4527180	So thank you Ubisoft.
4527180	4532420	Assassin's Creed Syndicate, they have a version of that that's going to be coming out on Friday,
4532420	4536740	so that's on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
4536740	4538380	And then that would be it for the week.
4538380	4541260	Alright, wow, busy week in the US.
4541260	4543940	Japan traveling over there, it's a lot lighter.
4543940	4547760	There's not really the same level of releases over there that we have here, but we do have
4547760	4549540	just a few things coming out.
4549540	4555820	Sengoku Musou 4 gets a price reduction as it moves into the Koei Tecmo The Best collection
4555820	4557580	over on the PlayStation 4.
4557580	4563500	I do not believe anything is out on the Wii U this week in Japan, nope, in fact I think
4563500	4566900	now that Woolly World's come out, I don't think there's anything for quite a while until
4566900	4567900	we get into November.
4567900	4572100	However, if you go to the handhelds, the story's a little different because on the 3DS this
4572100	4575860	week, and I think this is the big tent pole for the week, The Legend of Zelda Triforce
4575860	4578420	Heroes is out in Japan on the 22nd.
4578420	4580340	So obviously that's a big title.
4580340	4581980	That's a really good game I didn't talk about.
4581980	4582980	Oh, did you play the demo?
4582980	4584340	I played the demo.
4584340	4585700	It was really fun.
4585700	4590020	I did not have any expectations going into it.
4590020	4591020	Is it a lot like Four Swords?
4591020	4594660	Yes, but with one less person and costumes.
4594660	4599500	And it's just neat, like the costumes, the ones we had in the demo were kind of stupid.
4599500	4604540	Does it work with all the Amiibo on the 3DS too for costumes like Yoshi does?
4604540	4607740	I don't think it does anything with Amiibo, it may do something with Toon Link, I don't
4607740	4608740	know.
4608740	4613860	But we got to pick from a Tingle costume or a Zelda costume, and they all had their own
4613860	4615340	power-ups.
4615340	4619140	Like the little emotes, because you can't voice chat, the emotes are so much fun and
4619140	4623100	you can keep tapping them over and over to make them bigger and louder, to get people's
4623100	4624100	attention.
4624100	4625100	It's cool.
4625100	4626100	Alright.
4626100	4629700	Well, also on the 3DS, if for whatever reason Triforce Heroes isn't your thing, Pri Para
4629700	4633740	Mezase Idol Grand Prix No. 1 is also out this week.
4633740	4635100	I'm sure that is a winner.
4635100	4636100	I don't know though.
4636100	4637980	I don't know anything about that game.
4637980	4645380	Lastly, over on the PlayStation Vita, I actually don't think, oh, some price reductions this
4645380	4646380	week.
4646380	4652820	Senkoku Musou 4, Maju, and then one new game from Prototype called Flowers Natsu Hen comes
4652820	4655380	out this week on the PlayStation Vita.
4655380	4656380	That's it for Japan.
4656380	4657380	How about Europe?
4657380	4660540	Oh, a few things, just a few.
4660540	4668820	We have on the 20th, Deathwatch Enhanced Edition, Rebel Galaxy, and Tales of Zestiria.
4668820	4672380	On the 21st, Kingdom for Mac and PC.
4672380	4680060	On the 22nd, Dovetail Games Euro Fishing, and Noct for PC and for Mac.
4680060	4688740	And on the 23rd, I think the 23rd is this week, I can't even remember what day it is,
4688740	4694100	Assassin's Creed Syndicate for a bunch of stuff, Guitar Hero Live for a bunch of stuff,
4694100	4707020	including iOS, Just Dance 2016, Let's Sing 2016, and Warhammer End Times Verminetide
4707020	4708420	on PC.
4708420	4710380	I think that's it.
4710380	4711380	That is it.
4711380	4714800	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week,
4714800	4716300	but first, Loki.
4716700	4721620	Alright, so this kind of sucks, but apparently more accounts have been hacked.
4721620	4728940	There was a data dump that they did on PaySpin that included about 600 origin accounts, including
4728940	4739340	Gmail addresses, passwords, and games tied to accounts.
4739340	4744540	They're saying that, and basically these were kind of like the first part of a dump, maybe.
4744540	4749780	They're saying they're letters A through F as far as the names.
4749780	4753820	Right now, they're saying at this point, there's no indication that the list was obtained through
4753820	4759940	an intrusion of our account databases, but because of that, you still might want to take
4759940	4766380	caution to make sure that you're changing your passwords and that type of stuff.
4766380	4767820	I don't know.
4767820	4770820	That's not too reassuring, though.
4770820	4771820	No it is not.
4772340	4776380	Email addresses and passwords and stuff.
4776380	4779260	Just make sure you're not reusing your passwords.
4779260	4781820	You know, a game I didn't talk about during my gaming week, probably because I didn't
4781820	4785060	play an awful lot of it, but it's something I played through Origin, and again, this is
4785060	4786940	kind of Shane's fault, but not really.
4786940	4787940	He didn't really pressure me to play this.
4787940	4789340	I was just like, oh, I'll try it again.
4789340	4794020	I played Star Wars The Old Republic, which is an EA, it's an online MMO, and I haven't
4794020	4797540	played it since it first came out, and when it went free to play, and I was like, oh,
4797540	4799860	let me see how the graphics are.
4799900	4802420	There's Star Wars hysteria in the world right now.
4802420	4804020	They've got an expansion coming out.
4804020	4807620	What the poster for the new movie came out today, and everybody's going, oh my God, you
4807620	4810060	know, right, over that, so I was like, oh, I'll check out The Old Republic.
4810060	4811980	I didn't play a lot of it, though.
4811980	4816220	I actually probably played more Final Fantasy XIV than I did Star Wars The Old Republic,
4816220	4817260	which is a bit of a change.
4817260	4821700	I've been kind of taking a break from XIV lately because I really need a content patch,
4821700	4825620	but I'm very excited about the pet battles in the new patch, but anyway, just kind of
4825620	4828700	made me think of that as a, I haven't really been playing a lot through Origin lately,
4828740	4830140	but I did play that.
4830140	4833100	But Shane, you didn't talk really about this during your gaming week, Star Wars The Old
4833100	4834100	Republic.
4834100	4835100	Are you having a good time with it?
4835100	4838260	Because I couldn't play it because my computer's graphics card was too good, remember?
4838260	4840260	Yeah, but you're further along than I am, so you may be playing that.
4840260	4842300	Yeah, because I just did a little bit here and there.
4842300	4843300	It's fun.
4843300	4846460	I don't want to get back into an MMO, really, so.
4846460	4847460	Yeah, I hear you.
4847460	4853820	It's just a neat little diversion while my Hunt for Power Ranger toys is kind of cooled.
4853820	4854820	That's how I feel.
4854820	4857340	It's like an, oh, neat kind of thing, but I don't think I'm going to get sucked back
4857380	4858380	into it at all.
4858380	4860900	It's kind of like when I played Neverwinter for like a week.
4860900	4862860	I was like, oh, okay, it's kind of neat.
4862860	4867060	Now I feel a little more like I know a little more about this MMO, but that's it.
4867060	4873700	Anyhow, you know, we are now living in a world where there is not just one video game streaming
4873700	4877820	service, but there's two between Twitch TV and YouTube gaming, and of course, you know,
4877820	4882580	the other, you know, kind of under the bubble streaming services as well.
4882580	4886420	But I think a lot of us have been trying to see, oh, what's going to happen in this competition
4886940	4887940	versus Twitch and YouTube?
4887940	4890820	Well, YouTube did a very interesting move this week.
4890820	4898220	YouTube gaming updated their app, and now you can actually stream from a mobile phone
4898220	4899220	if it's Android.
4899220	4903460	It actually will not work on the iPhones, and I'm assuming that's because the iPhones
4903460	4907140	are a little more locked down in the OS, so I don't think one app can kind of bleed into
4907140	4908500	another.
4908500	4911540	But if you have Android, you can actually do streaming from mobile.
4911540	4913060	That's kind of exciting, actually.
4913060	4916740	You can use the front cam to actually do commentary as you play along with the mobile
4916740	4917740	game.
4917740	4922380	I did not realize this, but I guess stuff like Clash of Clans is, like, huge on YouTube,
4922380	4926140	and I, you know, I gotta be honest, that's not, is that the one Mariah Carey does the
4926140	4927140	ads for now?
4927140	4928140	I have no idea.
4928140	4929820	It's like, dang, what happened to you, girl?
4929820	4932100	She is, is that, or is that Game of War?
4932100	4934700	I thought that was Liam Neeson did Clash of Clans.
4934700	4935900	Is it?
4935900	4936900	I don't know.
4936900	4937900	What's the other one?
4937900	4942800	It's always that fucking ad on YouTube where Mariah Carey is like, and it was somebody
4942800	4945400	else before her, some supermodel pretty girl.
4945400	4946400	Kate Upton?
4946400	4947400	Yeah.
4947400	4948400	The Kate Upton game?
4948400	4949400	Yeah.
4949400	4950400	Which one's that?
4950400	4951400	Oh, I don't remember.
4951400	4952400	Alan will shout it out in chat as soon as, okay.
4952400	4953400	They're all, they all blend together.
4953400	4954400	Oh, they're all yelling, it's Game of War.
4954400	4955720	Thank you.
4955720	4956720	That's different.
4956720	4957720	Um.
4957720	4964080	SSJ100 Matt in chat says, ugh, I'm envisioning people streaming themselves going through
4964080	4965080	Tinder.
4965080	4970400	That's kind of fucked up, though, like, don't broadcast people who don't, you know, who
4970400	4972640	didn't give you permission to do that, you know what I mean?
4972640	4974280	Don't broadcast things like Tinder.
4974280	4975280	All right.
4975280	4977720	And Act F says Clash of Clans is the one with the cartoony looks.
4977720	4978720	All right.
4978720	4979720	Well, now I understand.
4979720	4980720	Thank you.
4980720	4985080	I would stream myself playing Flappy Bird because that game was really infuriating sometimes,
4985080	4986080	remember?
4986080	4988040	You guys remember when Flappy Bird was cool?
4988040	4990080	I never played it.
4990080	4991080	Yeah.
4991080	4993840	I think Hearthstone would be fun to stream on my phone.
4993840	4994840	Oh, yeah.
4994840	4995840	Yeah.
4995840	4996840	Hearthstone's a fun game.
4996840	4997840	Well, that's a good one.
4997840	5001200	You get so frustrated because you get, you play really well, then this insane card comes
5001200	5002200	out.
5002200	5003200	You're like, no!
5003200	5004640	I can see the rage.
5004640	5008480	That's when, um, uh, the Hearthstone's a huge one on PC.
5008480	5009480	Anyway.
5009480	5010480	Yeah, I know.
5010480	5011480	It's one of the biggest streamers on Twitch.
5011480	5015080	And so, but, but I think having the mobile phone, if it uses the camera and it's pointing
5015080	5017480	like right up at your face, I think it's just hilarious.
5017480	5018480	All right.
5018480	5023200	Well, also, uh, rolling out on YouTube fan funding and sponsorships, and I guess this
5023200	5025600	is being tested with some streamers right now.
5025600	5031880	Uh, there's live chat stuff, uh, extra there, exclusive chat sessions, and more apparently
5031880	5033240	being planned with that.
5033240	5036640	So, um, interesting to see what's developing on that front.
5036640	5040040	And I got to admit, as somebody who's trying to get into streaming more and more, like
5040040	5043800	I kind of can't decide, do I want to do Twitch or do I want to do YouTube?
5043800	5047880	Like, I feel like the discoverability is a little better on Twitch right now.
5047880	5051800	And you know, they've got a pretty solid community over there, but then it's like, oh, but YouTube,
5051800	5056200	you know, probably opens up monetization to everybody, but let's be real.
5056200	5058120	I'm not going to make any money off of it.
5058120	5061160	And I kind of, I kind of think the stream is better quality on YouTube because you can
5061160	5063400	do the 1080p at 60 frames a second.
5063400	5064400	So I don't know.
5064400	5065400	I don't know.
5065400	5068040	I'm, I'm trying to decide and it can't, it's just, there's perks to, I think inevitably
5068040	5071920	I'll have to juggle both, but then do I want to spread myself thin like that?
5071920	5072920	I don't know.
5072920	5073920	All right.
5073920	5077940	Well, remember, we're going to take a trip back and remember the days when you couldn't
5077940	5080460	like stream these games.
5080460	5083740	You could take like a Polaroid picture and that was it.
5083740	5087580	It's a classic game of the week.
5087580	5092380	Dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, Hey,
5092380	5099700	enough with your clash of clans, game of war, mobile phone streaming stuff.
5099700	5102500	This is back when Mariah Carey had number one hits.
5102500	5106900	This is before Mariah Carey had number one hits.
5106900	5111460	This is when you can't do that on television was actually still on TV.
5111460	5112460	This is before.
5112460	5114660	This was when Mariah Carey gets back on.
5114660	5116180	It was back on for a minute.
5116180	5117180	What?
5117180	5118180	Yeah.
5118180	5123380	Nickelodeon had that splat channel or something like that.
5123380	5124380	And it was gas.
5124380	5125380	Right?
5125380	5126380	No, no, no.
5126380	5127380	I don't think that existed anymore.
5127380	5129220	That was a new channel splatter thing.
5129220	5130220	It's coming on.
5130220	5131220	It's all the nineties.
5131220	5132220	Yeah.
5132220	5133460	And then at night, I'm sorry.
5133460	5134460	I'm very sorry.
5134460	5136580	But nineties Nickelodeon is very important.
5136580	5137860	Did gas turn into splat?
5137860	5139340	No gas was just went away a long time ago.
5139340	5140980	That was a really good channel though.
5140980	5145140	Um, no, it had stuff like you can't do that on television.
5145140	5146140	Are you afraid of the dark?
5146140	5147140	Oh my God.
5147140	5148140	This is amazing.
5148140	5149140	Clarissa explains it all.
5149140	5150140	Yeah.
5150140	5151140	It was really cool looking.
5151140	5154700	And of course I don't have cable so I can watch it, but I apologize to dark soccer,
5154700	5156700	but you did say you can't do that on television.
5156700	5161500	So, all right, anyhow, she just rolled her eyes so hard.
5161500	5163300	It's the introduction to the opposite.
5163300	5164300	All right.
5164300	5165300	Dark soccer.
5165300	5171860	Classic game of the week, punch out, which, which she's about to do to one of the hosts.
5171860	5175740	I'm about to do something anyway.
5175740	5179540	Punch out was a actually a whole series of boxing games.
5179540	5187140	It was created by a Nintendo general manager, uh, Daniel Takeda and uh, done also by a Makato
5187140	5188140	Wada.
5188140	5193500	The, uh, we had the arcade version, which was punch out with exclamation points.
5193500	5198300	And then there was a sequel, which was super punch out exclamation points.
5198300	5203580	So there were all kinds of different versions that came out later for the home market and
5203580	5212140	even fairly recently for the home market again, and even had a spinoff called arm wrestling,
5212140	5215820	which only came out in North American arcades.
5215820	5222260	And it was also Nintendo's last arcade game that they independently developed and released.
5222260	5229980	So, um, it really is just, you're going through a character by character, trying to punch
5229980	5230980	them.
5230980	5236020	You play as little Mac and you're trying to win the world video boxing association championship
5236020	5244100	and you fight different, a very stereotypical characters to say the least.
5244100	5249260	And um, basically you just have to knock them out, but everyone's going to have their own
5249260	5251420	different super attack and their own patterns.
5251420	5256580	So you really have to just learn how to beat them properly.
5256580	5263100	You will also get a visual cue that lets you know when they're about to do their big, uh,
5263100	5264980	super powered attack.
5264980	5271180	So, um, as far as different versions that have been out, cause I mean, there's really
5271180	5275340	not too much else to say about fucking punch out cause it's, you know, punch out, um, there
5275340	5279820	was punch out arcade, which was the first one punch out boxing for game and watch super
5279820	5286900	punch out that came out arcade, uh, CPC, Commodore 16, Commodore 64, Commodore plus,
5286900	5290060	uh, MS-DOS and ZX spectrum.
5290060	5296420	Then there was arm wrestling in 1985, uh, punch out slash Mike Tyson's punch out that
5296420	5302700	came out on the NES, um, Wii, uh, virtual console, Nintendo 3DS virtual console and
5302700	5304380	Wii U virtual console.
5304380	5310940	Now something to say about this is that Mike Tyson's punch out was under a special license
5310940	5316060	after, um, they, uh, lost the licensing rights.
5316060	5322060	It then became just punch out again with, I think it was Mr. Dream as the final, the
5322060	5323060	final boss.
5323060	5324060	But interesting.
5324060	5327900	You know, you hear, you can hear in the video left, right, left cause we're looking at the
5327900	5333340	arcade version here, which, you know, I, I remember playing as a kid and I'm kind of
5333340	5336700	looking at this going, wow, I didn't realize how much of Mike Tyson's punch out, which
5336700	5339340	I'm more familiar with, had like a lot of this stuff.
5339340	5340340	Like kid quick.
5340340	5341340	This guy was not in.
5341340	5342340	Yeah.
5342340	5343340	Tyson's at all.
5343340	5344340	The ball bold.
5344340	5348980	The last guy was, but the last Joe, the last guy in this was a super macho man, right?
5348980	5349980	I think so.
5349980	5350980	Yeah.
5350980	5351980	I'm pretty sure it was like the end boss.
5351980	5355940	And the other thing too, is that graphically, the reason why we had teensy tiny little Mac
5355940	5359420	is because, um, they wouldn't have been able, I think part of it was that they couldn't
5359420	5360700	have the size of the character.
5360700	5364700	They would have also been able to do the transparencies for the green grid.
5364700	5367700	They just didn't have the memory for it.
5367700	5372260	Um, so little Mac was teeny Mac as I would call him.
5372260	5374340	I didn't know it was the licensing issue though.
5374340	5376980	I thought it was all because of Mike Tyson's legal troubles or something.
5376980	5377980	No, it was licensing.
5377980	5378980	So was that before that?
5378980	5379980	Yeah.
5379980	5380980	Oh, I didn't know that.
5380980	5381980	Yeah.
5381980	5382980	I think the legal troubles came soon after.
5382980	5387780	So in my mind, like growing up, I always like related to like, Oh, they can't have that
5387780	5388780	anymore after, you know.
5388780	5389780	You went to jail for rape.
5389780	5391780	For beating up and cheating on your wife.
5391780	5392780	Asshole.
5392780	5393780	Yeah.
5393780	5394780	Anyway.
5394780	5397780	Um, after that we had Punch Out for Wii and Wii U.
5397780	5404220	Then we had Doc Lewis's Punch Out, which was a WiiWare standalone.
5404220	5409540	So it was only a download exclusive to the 2009 Club Nintendo Platinum members.
5409540	5415380	And then it was re-released with a hundred other titles that were claimed by a general
5415380	5416840	Club Nintendo members.
5416840	5420040	So it was only Club Nintendo.
5420040	5425320	And so, uh, there were all kinds of fun characters in this series.
5425320	5429200	Um, just to go through the list, cause there's a lot of them.
5429200	5434120	There was Aaron Ryan, Bald Bull, I'm going in order, Bear Hugger, Bob Charlie, Disco
5434120	5437880	Kid, Doc Lewis, Don Flamenco, Donkey Kong.
5437880	5440560	God, there's actually just a bunch more.
5440560	5441560	Yeah.
5441560	5444760	Um, my favorite, always King Hippo, just because he was hilarious.
5444760	5453280	Um, we had Gabby J, Glass Joe, Great Tiger, Heike Kagero, um, Hoi Karlo, uh, Kid Quick,
5453280	5461600	King Hippo, uh, Lil Mac as an opponent, uh, Mad Clown, Mast Muscle, Mike Tyson, Mr. Dream,
5461600	5470680	Mr. Sandman, Narciss Prince, uh, Nick Bruiser, Piston Honda, Piston Hurricane, Pizza Pasta,
5470680	5478440	Rick Bruiser, Soda Popinski, which who originally was supposed to be, uh, um, uh, Vodka something.
5478440	5479800	I'm gonna have to look him up again.
5479800	5482600	We had Super Macho Man and Von Kaiser.
5482600	5486720	Let me see if I can find Soda Popinski, cause he's actually got his little article on it.
5486720	5490600	Okay, he was supposed to be Vodka Drunkinski.
5490600	5495960	He first appeared in Super Punch Out and was called Vodka Drunkinski.
5495960	5498920	And then he changed it from Mike Tyson's Punch Out.
5498920	5499920	Huh.
5500480	5505000	Yeah, I can't imagine that Nintendo of the 1980s made that change.
5505000	5506000	Who knew?
5506000	5507000	Eh.
5507000	5508000	You think they're bad with the family stuff now.
5508000	5510160	Good lord, you should have seen them back then.
5510160	5517160	Well, um, the characters of course made plenty of other, um, you know, appearances.
5517160	5520760	We've, uh, had like trophies in Super Smash Brothers.
5520760	5526720	We've had, uh, I believe, were there a couple of Howard and Nestor?
5526720	5532720	And then, um, the SNES version of Super Punch Out was in the GameCube version of EA's Fight
5532720	5534600	Night Round 2.
5534600	5544640	Um, and then you could also play Lil Mac, um, in, uh, uh, in the same game.
5544640	5546120	He was an unlockable.
5546120	5550840	Um, so it was, it was, you know, there were a lot of crossovers in there, but yeah, this
5550840	5553480	game was pretty cool.
5553480	5555200	Alright.
5555200	5561760	There it is, your classic game of the week, Punch Out, which you can play in the arcade
5561760	5564280	or you can play one of the, uh, many other home versions.
5564280	5569000	Found what it was I was thinking of, there was a, a Punch Out title that was in the Nintendo
5569000	5570000	comic system.
5570000	5571000	Oh.
5571000	5572000	That was it.
5572000	5577560	I have a little Punch Out like kind of memory real quick is, uh, it's a recent memory, but
5577560	5583000	it's, you know, I, I love Games Done Quick, but the way I found out about Games Done Quick
5583000	5587720	was people on Twitter were talking about that guy, Sinister One, was playing Punch
5587720	5590220	Out blindfolded on a stream.
5590220	5591720	And Tyre Claude just brought that up in chat.
5591720	5592720	Oh, that's funny.
5592720	5593720	Oh yeah.
5593720	5596040	I haven't been looking at the chat tonight, but yeah, it was actually the creator of Adventure
5596040	5600360	Time tweeted it out and I was following him and uh, yeah, he said like, there's someone
5600360	5604720	playing Mike Tyson's Punch Out blindfolded right now, everybody should go check it out.
5604720	5607280	And I checked it out and I've been watching the streams ever since.
5607280	5610080	That's what got me into Games Done Quick.
5610080	5611080	I love Games Done Quick.
5611080	5612920	Yeah, no, it's a good, good marathon.
5612920	5613920	For the record.
5613920	5617480	We were having a conversation last night about other games done blindfolded, all of which
5617480	5624080	I have two, which is the Dragon Stage in Mega Man 2, I used to be able to do that blindfolded
5624080	5626360	and then 8-1 in Super Mario Brothers.
5626360	5627360	Dang.
5627360	5630880	I did blindfolded, uh, Pagle on a stream once and that was funny.
5630880	5631880	Yeah.
5631880	5635560	I think Shane watched that one and then, uh, you were there for that one?
5635560	5636560	I don't remember.
5636560	5637560	I see.
5637560	5638560	I didn't know that.
5638560	5643560	But, uh, there's a, there's an achievement on Unfinished Swan to, I didn't really do
5643560	5647080	a blindfolded, but you have to get through the first level, which is all white, pretty
5647080	5648080	much.
5648080	5649080	And you spray paint everywhere.
5649080	5650080	We're using only like three paint balls.
5650080	5653720	And I was like, this is like a blindfold challenge because you have to be so quiet and listen
5653720	5655700	to your steps and where you're going is pretty cool.
5655700	5656700	That's a more recent game.
5656700	5660320	But yeah, there's a, there's a trophy and you get the trophy by not using too much paint.
5660320	5661320	So yeah.
5661320	5662320	Excellent.
5662320	5663320	Blindfold games.
5663320	5664320	Fun.
5664320	5665320	Fun.
5665320	5666320	All right.
5666320	5670320	Thanks for participation for this week's episode of Orange Laundry Radio at vognetwork.com.
5670320	5671320	Use the passphrase, Neil.
5671320	5675760	Uh, that's going to do it for this first half of Orange Laundry Radio, but don't go anywhere.
5675760	5680640	We got more, including rapid fire news, the Fugu question of the week, your emails and
5680640	5682700	listless when we come back.
5682700	5684920	And tonight we actually have something very special.
5684920	5689360	Usually we do a music break, uh, in between part A and part B, but tonight we actually
5689360	5694480	have, thanks to DJ Rama S from Anime Jam Session, bringing us a very special exclusive interview
5694480	5696160	with Kyle Hebert.
5696160	5701080	And if you don't know that name, uh, he is actually a very prolific anime voice actor
5701080	5702720	as well as video games.
5702720	5707520	He is the voice of Ryu in Street Fighter IV and like Smash Brothers with the DLC and all
5707520	5708520	that.
5708520	5709520	So, uh, we're going to get right to it.
5709520	5711520	We're going to get over to Rama with this interview.
5711520	5714920	It is about 15 minutes and I do want to say the audio quality is a little different than
5714920	5719360	us here in studio because I think, uh, uh, Rama had his little audio recorder and it
5719360	5722200	sounds like they're in a back room at this anime convention somewhere.
5722240	5727560	Uh, so please excuse, uh, what might be perceived as, uh, uh, some rough audio, but, uh, good
5727560	5728560	content.
5728560	5733020	So, uh, we'll be back and a big thanks to Rama S for this interview and, uh, we'll be
5733020	5735160	back in about 15 minutes on the other end of this interview.
5735160	5736160	Take it away, Rama.
5736160	5744520	Hey everyone, DJ Rama S here from Anime Jam Session.
5744520	5751520	We're at AAC, another anime convention, 2015, Sunday, we're up, we're running about and
5751520	5753600	they decided to give us some awesome interviews today.
5753600	5755300	So we're going to take advantage of that.
5755300	5762560	And today on my right, we're here with prolific voice actor, Kyle, a bear, Hey Kyle, how's
5762560	5763560	it going?
5763560	5764560	I'm an excellent man.
5764560	5768480	I'm just trying to wake up and another fantastic weekend under our belt pretty much.
5768480	5769920	That is awesome.
5769920	5772840	First thing first, I want to say is congratulations on your upcoming Nopos.
5772840	5773840	Oh yeah.
5773840	5774840	Yeah.
5774840	5775840	Thank you.
5775840	5776840	Thank you.
5776840	5777840	Thank you very much.
5778160	5781160	So is it true to theme is going to be Gohan and Videl?
5781160	5784720	Oh, I don't know about that.
5784720	5785720	Don't know about that.
5785720	5790120	She's thinking like, okay, long engagement and something private.
5790120	5791120	Let's elope.
5791120	5792120	Let's save money.
5792120	5797360	If you're going to blow money on anything wedding related, save it for the honeymoon.
5797360	5798360	Big trip somewhere.
5798360	5799360	There you go.
5799360	5801360	And how far are you from Vegas?
5801360	5804840	A five hour drive.
5804840	5805840	Very scenic.
5805840	5811640	But you know, God, if she had her way, she's just like, let's do it on the beach, barefoot
5811640	5816680	in the sand, you know, something quiet and simple.
5816680	5818840	And I'm like, can we live stream it?
5818840	5824840	Can I periscope it like, get the big sigh and the judgy face.
5824840	5830320	Well, we're techno geeks or techno nerds, it comes with the territory.
5830320	5831320	Right.
5831320	5832320	Right.
5832320	5833320	Yeah.
5833320	5834320	It's like, take me as I am, honey.
5834320	5835320	Yeah.
5835320	5836320	So it's been a while since we've interviewed you.
5836320	5839320	I think last time was like anime and acts like 2011 or something like that.
5839320	5840320	Back in the day.
5840320	5842320	And it may have been the same year I was here.
5842320	5843320	2011, 2012.
5843320	5844320	Probably.
5844320	5845320	It was an older venue.
5845320	5846320	Like the hotel looked like a castle.
5846320	5847320	I remember that.
5847320	5848320	Yeah.
5848320	5849320	Everyone was telling me about that.
5849320	5854400	I started coming up here to like move to this location.
5854400	5855800	This is a pretty swanky location.
5855800	5856800	I dig it.
5856800	5858920	I've had a blast here every year I've gone.
5858920	5859920	Yeah.
5859920	5860920	Good on you.
5860920	5865640	So, tell me, how did you get into becoming the voice of Ryu from Street Fighter?
5865640	5869280	Man, well, like, you can actually insert this answer for anything.
5869280	5871520	How did you get any fill in the blank role?
5871520	5872520	There you go.
5872520	5873520	You auditioned.
5873520	5875520	But how do you audition, Kyle?
5875520	5876520	You gotta know people.
5876520	5878520	Well, how do you know people, Kyle?
5878520	5885520	Well, you know, it's this long process of training first and a lot of luck.
5885520	5888040	A lot of luck.
5888040	5892200	You know, being in the right place at the right time, knowing the right people, getting
5892200	5896360	on someone's radar, as it were.
5896360	5901080	For years, I've been recording with new generation pictures on various things through the years.
5901080	5908720	Ergo Proxy, a bunch of RPG stuff, The Dawn of Mana, I was trying to think of stuff before
5908720	5909720	that.
5909720	5916800	Ultimately, I think we did like Hellsing Ultimate, I did like a mercenary guy on that.
5916800	5923800	And because I was kind of on that list, recording with them on various anime projects and Japanese
5923800	5928520	RPG stuff, they said, hey, we got this big project, we can't tell you what it is, in
5928520	5932760	fact it's so big that you have to sign an NDA just to audition.
5932760	5935600	I go, ooh, ooh, ooh, I wonder what it is.
5935600	5939400	So I get to the studio, I try out, and they hand me this three ring binder.
5939400	5942640	And it says, alright, oh wait, you haven't signed the NDA yet.
5942640	5944640	Okay, alright, sign the NDA.
5944640	5949240	Alright, when you open this three ring binder, you will probably recognize what it is.
5949240	5950240	Don't freak out.
5950240	5958240	So I open this ring binder and I'm like, ooh, is this what I think he asked?
5958240	5959240	Okay.
5959240	5961440	It's like, pick who you want to read for.
5961440	5965640	So naturally I had to read for you.
5965640	5973160	Let's see, I think I read for M. Bison and oh, at least like three or four others, El
5973160	5974160	Fuerte even.
5974160	5980080	And I thought, okay, I don't know which one I felt the strongest about.
5980080	5986120	But yes, I go in, do the best I can, as you do with any audition, hope for the best.
5986120	5991000	A couple months go by, and then the director of the project, Taliesin Jaffe, he also voices
5991000	5992000	Blanca.
5992000	5996280	He tells me at a con secretly, so I think, congrats, man, I go, on what?
5996280	5998880	He's like, you got to read it.
5998880	5999880	I'm like, what?
5999880	6000880	Really?
6000880	6001880	He's like, oh, they didn't tell you?
6001880	6002880	Like, no.
6002880	6006000	I'm like, we can't talk about it.
6006000	6010600	You sign these non-disclosure agreements saying, you know, you're under a gag order until the
6010600	6011600	game comes out.
6011600	6013120	Oh, I understand completely.
6013120	6018680	And in this case, and is the case with many games, you know, nine months, a year, sometimes
6018680	6023540	longer, Guild Wars was years worked on that for multiple years.
6023540	6030200	But Street Fighter, yeah, unreal, because not only I'm a casual gamer, I'm a casual
6030200	6034640	crappy gamer, button masher, I lost a lot of quarters on Street Fighter, but I also
6034640	6038880	knew how important and iconic that series is, much less the character.
6038880	6039880	Yes.
6039880	6045720	So, yeah, my inner geek was definitely tingling.
6045720	6050400	That is amazing, because I remember many of them throwing quarter after quarter after
6050400	6052360	quarter playing Street Fighter in the arcade.
6052360	6053360	Oh, okay.
6053360	6054360	Yes.
6054360	6057080	Yeah, and then the consoles happened, and then people stopped throwing quarters, because
6057080	6062440	nowadays to play a quarter game in the 80s, you'd probably pay like a dollar nowadays
6062440	6063440	or something.
6063440	6064440	Yeah.
6064440	6065440	It's nutty.
6065440	6069960	But, you know, there are some reasons to come out, like there's some new Star Wars game
6069960	6073720	that's only in arcades that looks amazing.
6073720	6078180	They got to give you a reason to come out of your cave once in a while, I suppose.
6078180	6083640	But I mean, the Street Fighter thing, even cooler, was getting to, because I had that
6083640	6087200	connection to that, and then Disney made Wreck-It Ralph, and said, we're going to have
6087200	6093160	cameos for Street Fighter characters and Sonic and all that, and they reached out and they
6093160	6097080	knew the fans would want the original voices.
6097080	6098080	Good on them.
6098080	6099080	Thank you, Disney.
6099080	6100440	Thank you, Rich Moore, the director.
6100440	6107720	Thank you, everybody working on that, for thinking ahead and thinking to the fans.
6107720	6113000	That is a love story, a love letter to the fans of the whole gaming generation.
6113360	6117520	Yeah, I remember when me and my co-owner, we went to go see Wreck-It Ralph.
6117520	6119280	We were just waiting just to hear your voice.
6119280	6124880	We were just screaming in the fears, because like, we know who that is, that is awesome.
6124880	6127600	We stayed for the credits just to see your name go up in the credits.
6127600	6128600	That's so cool.
6128600	6129600	Thank you.
6129600	6137120	Yeah, I went with Steve Blum and some other staffers at Anime Nebraska on opening night,
6137120	6138120	and oh, man, I teared up.
6138120	6139120	It was so sweet.
6139120	6140120	It was like, oh, yeah.
6140120	6142120	They're like, woohoo.
6142240	6143240	Awesome.
6143240	6147360	And that was neat, to not only see my name on the credits under additional voices, that's
6147360	6148360	what I expected.
6148360	6151520	I didn't think it would say redo Kylie, they're like, what?
6151520	6157920	You know, Ken, Ruben Langdon, all the characters got their name in the credits, you know?
6157920	6161880	And I know a lot of people get up and leave during the credits, but for years, especially
6161880	6166320	after being in the industry, I like seeing who did the additional voices, you know?
6166320	6168320	You know, celebs do the main ones.
6168520	6170520	I like to say it's like, oh, I recognize that person.
6170520	6171520	Oh, yeah.
6171520	6176520	And then I'll sit there and cheer, a little inner giggle and clap and all that stuff.
6176520	6178880	So, yeah, yeah, absolutely.
6178880	6182720	That's like my favorite achievement so far in 15 years in this industry is getting to
6182720	6185320	do Ryu on a Disney movie.
6185320	6186320	Nice.
6186320	6187320	That is impressive.
6187320	6188320	So, again, congratulations.
6188320	6189320	Thank you.
6189320	6190320	Thank you.
6190320	6194320	So, besides fighting games, what other type of games do you like to play when you have
6194320	6196320	the few minutes to relax?
6196320	6198320	Oh, man, a few minutes.
6198320	6199320	What?
6199320	6200320	What?
6200320	6202320	I'm so ADD to begin with, too, you know?
6202320	6205320	It's just, I put in all sorts of things.
6205320	6209320	The latest thing I have that I want to dedicate more time to is Arkham Knight.
6209320	6213320	Not only is it a beautiful game, but it's a ton of fun to play.
6213320	6216320	All the Arkham games are, you know?
6216320	6220320	Fighting games, I still fire up Street Fighter, to be honest.
6220320	6221320	There you go.
6221320	6222320	It's Soul Calibur.
6222320	6224320	It's actually my favorite brawler.
6224320	6225320	I love first-person shooters.
6225320	6226320	Again, I suck at them.
6226320	6230320	I'll be the first one to die if you play co-op with me or whatever.
6230320	6232320	But, yeah, Call of Duty, Halo.
6232320	6233320	Can't wait for the new Halo.
6233320	6234320	That's going to be fun.
6234320	6236320	I'm not on it, by the way.
6236320	6237320	I wish I was.
6237320	6239320	Tried out for it.
6239320	6242320	But my favorite shooter is actually Left 4 Dead 1 and 2.
6242320	6243320	I love that.
6243320	6245320	I love it, love it, love it, love it.
6245320	6247320	And I love retro stuff, too.
6247320	6253320	Going back to the Pac-Man, Galaga, Donkey Kong days, all that stuff.
6253320	6254320	Oh, yeah.
6254320	6257320	I love playing the old school.
6257320	6262320	We were down on Jersey Shore about a few weeks ago and there's a retro cave there.
6262320	6263320	I think it's like $5.
6263320	6266320	You can play all these arcade machines for like a half hour.
6266320	6267320	Oh, that's beautiful.
6267320	6270320	And there's arcade themed bars across the country.
6270320	6273320	You know, the cover charge and then you go in and it's unlimited play.
6273320	6278320	So the people go in there and you see games from all different eras.
6278320	6281320	And even like Duck Hunt at the bar and people are holding the thing.
6281320	6284320	And like, get that dog.
6284320	6286320	But everyone's not ordering drinks right away.
6286320	6289320	They're playing games from their childhood.
6289320	6292320	And now with Smash Brothers, you can actually go after the dog.
6292320	6293320	There you go.
6293320	6294320	I'll do that.
6294320	6296320	So this is Smash.
6296320	6297320	Yeah.
6297320	6298320	Yeah, there you go.
6298320	6299320	There you go.
6299320	6300320	Exactly.
6300320	6308320	What kind of advice can you tell aspiring voice actors and actors who want to get into the industry and do this for a living?
6308320	6310320	Boy, I tell you.
6311320	6320320	If you want to see it all summed up on a great website, D. Bradley Baker, who's done a ton of stuff on cartoons and games and stuff for years,
6320320	6328320	has made a beautiful website for beginners and the curious called Iwanttobeavoiceactor.com.
6328320	6338320	I'm endorsing it because I firmly believe that every bit of advice that he has on there, it's a wonderful blog to help give some insight to people that want to know.
6338320	6340320	It's like, this looks like the coolest job in the world.
6340320	6342320	And yes, it is the coolest job in the world.
6342320	6345320	I can look like this and still voice buff young dudes.
6345320	6348320	So hey, you know, you gotta love that.
6348320	6350320	What are you talking about? You are a buff young dog.
6350320	6354320	Yeah, I am a buff. Just close your eyes. Pretend.
6354320	6356320	The answer lies in the heart of battle.
6356320	6359320	Yeah, so advice, man.
6359320	6361320	I crossed into it from radio.
6361320	6363320	But radio's a different beast now.
6363320	6367320	It was tough to get into radio then, 15, 20 years ago.
6367320	6370320	Now the internet has changed the way we consume media.
6370320	6374320	So, you know, user-generated content and all that stuff.
6374320	6378320	But definitely practice. Start getting used to your voice.
6378320	6381320	Record it. Read aloud. Ten minutes a day.
6381320	6384320	That's the free thing you should be doing every day anyway.
6384320	6387320	Overcome shyness.
6387320	6395320	You know, understand that it is a business, so you gotta kind of learn a business angle to it.
6395320	6398320	Because you gotta network and you gotta market yourself.
6398320	6401320	And you have to train. You know, you have to hone your skills.
6401320	6406320	Doctors don't just want to be a doctor and suddenly they're carving into your heart and saving your life.
6406320	6410320	They have to go to school and learn their craft.
6410320	6412320	Same thing with acting.
6412320	6415320	If you want to be on the top of your game, absolutely.
6415320	6418320	Take acting classes. Not just voiceover classes.
6418320	6422320	Sometimes, depending on where you are, there are no voice acting classes.
6422320	6425320	So don't throw up your arms and just say, oh, I give up.
6425320	6428320	No. Take advantage of any sort of acting class.
6428320	6432320	Or ability. Or opportunity, rather.
6432320	6435320	You know, theater. Student film.
6435320	6438320	But I want to do voiceover. I want to be on camera.
6438320	6441320	You never know. Take the journey. Be open-minded.
6441320	6446320	Because you might discover along the way that you have an affinity for something else.
6446320	6451320	Like directing or something technical behind the scenes. Audio production or whatnot.
6451320	6455320	But nowadays you kind of have to be a jack-of-all-trades. Especially because of the internet.
6455320	6458320	Voice actors have to know to record themselves at home.
6458320	6463320	So you've got to learn some basic stuff. Editing and production skills and all that.
6463320	6467320	Learn some techniques and soundproofing.
6467320	6469320	Be able to record in your closet.
6469320	6472320	Clothing. You don't have to spend a fortune.
6472320	6475320	Clothing and boxes are great insulators for sound.
6475320	6481320	So if you record in your closet or have a little corner of your apartment or home that's quiet.
6481320	6489320	And doesn't have your voice reverberating off the sides of the walls, then that's something to consider as well.
6489320	6495320	Ultimately, depending on your goals in voiceover, the most money you can make is commercials.
6495320	6498320	That's the most lucrative. Especially a national ad campaign.
6498320	6501320	You could stand to make residuals from that.
6501320	6511320	I think Carlos Lazroqui, who was the voice of Okiyara Taco Bell years ago, he bought a house with those words.
6511320	6513320	Think about that. That's incredible.
6513320	6516320	There's no residuals in games and animation and certainly not anime.
6516320	6523320	Anime pays. Games are on fire right now.
6523320	6525320	And in animation too.
6525320	6532320	But in LA, Los Angeles is the hub for the most variety and the most different companies doing that sort of thing.
6532320	6536320	But commercial work, radio TV commercials, any major hub.
6536320	6539320	We're close to Boston pretty much here.
6539320	6551320	So Boston is a great place to go to if you need to go and learn the craft of acting and get into some commercial stuff.
6551320	6554320	Once you're trained, then this is the demo phase.
6554320	6557320	Now, you can practice at home and record demos and all that.
6557320	6564320	As it evolves, you can take different little excerpts and put them in different order and everything.
6564320	6572320	But once you start training with the pros and accredited, actual legit VO coaches who have testimonials from students and all that stuff,
6572320	6579320	they'll point you in the direction of demo producers who can give you the most bang for your buck.
6579320	6584320	And it is expensive. A top notch LA quality demo will run you about 1500 bucks.
6584320	6587320	It's a tax write off because we're freelance.
6587320	6593320	Anything having to do with equipment purchases, the classes you take, all that's a tax deduction.
6593320	6595320	So Uncle Sam treats you back.
6595320	6598320	So think of it that way. It's an investment in your craft.
6598320	6602320	So train. After you train and get experience, demo.
6602320	6605320	After your demo, market it to casting people.
6605320	6607320	How do you know where to send it?
6607320	6609320	Look it up online. Google is your friend.
6609320	6611320	Talk and network with other actors.
6611320	6614320	Use the internet to your advantage.
6614320	6617320	Join forums and discussion boards, Facebook groups.
6617320	6626320	Tons of them are out there featuring tons of voice talent from all over the world who can help you with their own experiences and ideas.
6626320	6628320	But everyone's path is unique.
6628320	6633320	You can take all the classes in the world, be super talented and still not book a gig.
6633320	6638320	But you have to have a thick skin. You have to have passion and determination.
6638320	6641320	And you've got to do it for the love.
6641320	6643320	Yeah, you want to make a living doing it.
6643320	6647320	And that's the end goal. But you're not going to be able to do it overnight.
6647320	6651320	The people that do just walk into an audition and suddenly their career is on fire, that's so rare.
6651320	6653320	So don't have that to do.
6653320	6659320	Just say to yourself, I see myself doing this. I want to do it so bad that I can't imagine doing anything else.
6660320	6664320	You take all the rejections from the auditions like it's nothing.
6664320	6667320	It just floats off your arms and you're like, whatever.
6667320	6669320	Give me the next one. I'm good to go.
6669320	6677320	And then, hopefully, after all that, after years of that mental torture and oh my god, I can't believe I'm doing this.
6677320	6680320	And your parents and your family and friends going, why don't you get a real job?
6680320	6685320	Then maybe, maybe, just maybe, you'll make a little progress.
6686320	6689320	Hey, that's motivation. I mean, thank you, man. I appreciate it.
6689320	6691320	Yeah, absolutely. Sure thing.
6691320	6694320	It's Kyle Aver, ladies and gentlemen. Definitely check him out.
6694320	6699320	And Street Fighter. My favorite album is Naruto.
6699320	6702320	Gurren Lagann and a few others. Definitely check it out.
6702320	6704320	Rock and roll. Thanks a lot, guys.
6704320	6705320	No problem.
6705320	6714320	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
6714320	6720320	And a big thanks to DJ Rama S from Anime Jam Session for that interview with Kyle Hebert,
6720320	6724320	which, you know, given some great advice for aspiring voice actors there in that interview.
6724320	6728320	And we love to kind of hear, you know, I know there's a lot of people that aspire to do that sort of stuff,
6728320	6730320	so I always love hearing the experts giving some advice.
6730320	6734320	So, a big thank you very much to DJ Rama S for that.
6734320	6739320	You can hear Anime Jam Sessions Tuesday night live here at the Voice of Geeks Network.
6739320	6743320	Check your local listings over at vognetwork.com for your time zone.
6743320	6749320	We're going to get into some rapid fire news here, and then we're going to get into list lists coming up in a little bit,
6749320	6751320	and I'll tell you what the topic is in just a moment.
6751320	6758320	Flaco Jones and Shane stepped out for a minute. They ran to do a dessert run for us. Oink, oink.
6758320	6764320	But we're going to get into some rapid fire news, and they should be back about the time we're going to get to list lists.
6764320	6767320	So, let's get to rapid fire news with Loki.
6767320	6770320	So, they're going to make some more pinball tables.
6770320	6776320	What is this? For Zen Pinball or Pinball FX2.
6776320	6784320	And with it now, of course, adding to all the different tables that I think we mentioned before in the Balls of Glory set
6784320	6787320	with Family Guy, American Dad, and Bob's Burgers.
6787320	6789320	Archer. They're going to have an Archer table.
6789320	6792320	Oh, fuck, that's awesome. I love Archer.
6792320	6797320	So, that would be pretty awesome. I'd have to definitely check that out.
6797320	6805320	When is that expected out? Not sure yet, but I guess whenever that Balls of Glory set comes out, that would be pretty epic.
6805320	6807320	So, I'll have to check it out.
6808320	6814320	Rocket League is getting some DLC, I'm sure, to tie in with the anniversary of Back to the Future.
6814320	6820320	Plus, the fact that they're going to have was a Back to the Future 2 date.
6820320	6823320	And the fact that's actually when it's coming out.
6823320	6831320	October 21st for $1.99, you'll be able to get a DeLorean for Rocket League.
6831320	6836320	October 21st, the date that they travel to the future in and Back to the Future 2.
6837320	6843320	The same day you can get Pepsi, what's it called? The Pepsi from the movie? Pepsi Perfect?
6843320	6845320	I think it's Pepsi Perfect, yeah.
6845320	6848320	I will have to try that. Where's that being sold?
6848320	6850320	I think, like, online.
6850320	6852320	Why don't you just be regular, crappy Pepsi?
6852320	6854320	If you didn't already get it, I think you're shit out of line.
6854320	6857320	Who cares? I don't. You know, whatever.
6857320	6863320	And last but not least, yet another game getting microtransactions.
6864320	6871320	They're getting microtransactions, I guess, and it's the only way you can unlock some certain cosmetic and stat-boosting items.
6871320	6884320	With that, there's going to be a black market update for $19.99, which introduces, I guess, loot drop safes that can only be opened using an item purchased with real money.
6884320	6894320	Whoa, hold on a second. So I have to purchase... do I have to purchase this update for $19.99 and then they want me to buy these safe keys?
6894320	6896320	That's kind of what it sounds like.
6896320	6902320	Why would I pay money for an update to buy...
6902320	6906320	You're going to pay money for the right to buy more. It's like conventions.
6906320	6909320	You're going to pay in a free fee to get in and then get all these vendors.
6909320	6913320	At least the convention has panels for free, though, once you get in.
6913320	6916320	Yeah, that's kind of lame, but all right.
6916320	6924320	By the way, this is why I love doing the show live because there's always listeners here ready to correct us when we fuck up the facts or just are kind of clueless.
6924320	6929320	Dark Tetsuya says it's a limited edition deal. This is the Pepsi for $20.15 a bottle.
6929320	6933320	Sj100Matt says I'll get that Pepsi perfect and dump it out for the bottle.
6933320	6937320	So I guess the black market update's free. The game's $20.
6937320	6941320	Brad from Pod Culture says it is just real sugar Pepsi.
6941320	6944320	So thank you for the listeners at live.vognetwork.com.
6944320	6947320	All we need is throwback.
6947320	6951320	All right. Moving on to some Nintendo news.
6951320	6956320	Some big maintenance for Nintendo's birthday. Well, tomorrow is the day after their birthday, I suppose.
6956320	6965320	But Monday, October 19th, from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Pacific time, Nintendo's online services will be down.
6965320	6969320	And it's like everything. So you want to play a Wii U game online? Too bad.
6969320	6976320	You can't even go shopping on the 3DS or the Wii U tomorrow. It is all going to be down, down, down.
6976320	6982320	So, yep, you'll have to. I don't know why. I don't know if it's to patch some type of exploit or something.
6982320	6988320	Actually, we have something coming up a little later that perhaps it is patching some type of exploit or what they're doing.
6989320	6995320	Some pretty controversial news this week. Star Wars Battlefront announced their season pass.
6995320	7000320	It is $50. $50 season pass for a $60 game.
7000320	7002320	Fuck that.
7002320	7011320	The season pass is going to be good for four expansions, a two-week early access to each piece of DLC, and a shoot-first emote.
7011320	7017320	So, you know, because you're going to shoot first on picking up this season pack. I don't know.
7017320	7023320	There's also what they call an ultimate edition of Battlefront. It's the deluxe edition with the season pass.
7023320	7030320	$120. That is a savings of $0 because the deluxe edition is already $70.
7030320	7038320	So, there you go. If you are really into Star Wars Battlefront, have fun with that season pass.
7038320	7046320	I don't know. A lot of what I'm hearing about Battlefront is that it's just, or I'm sorry, what I'm hearing about Star Wars Battlefront is that it's just Battlefield with a Star Wars skin.
7046320	7051320	But I'm like, isn't that what people wanted? Because, I don't know, it still looks kind of awesome.
7051320	7059320	I don't know if I'd play a lot of it and I certainly wouldn't spend $50 on the season pass and I don't even really know all what I'm getting, but I don't know.
7059320	7062320	I thought that's what people wanted.
7062320	7068320	I think, I don't know. I mean, I wish there was like a single-player campaign instead of just the survival modes.
7068320	7072320	Yeah, that part kind of sucks. I will go with you on that.
7073320	7080320	Let's see. Also, Square Enix considering doing some localization via crowdfunding.
7080320	7086320	That's right. This is a comment from Square Enix Europe CEO Phil Rogers in an interview with Game Informer.
7086320	7090320	Localization is a topic that comes up a lot and we understand why it does.
7090320	7097320	To a great extent, in a really positive way, we're absolutely humbled that we have this loyal and dedicated fan base that wants to give us the feedback.
7097320	7101320	We're constantly working with the teams in Tokyo to show them this and work with them there.
7101320	7109320	The simple truth is that in some ways, the development process and the tools, it's not always an easy undertaking to reopen a game and add localization subsequently.
7109320	7116320	But I think as we go forward with the way the group is working technically and the way it's now thinking globally, I'm really hoping that in the next 10 years,
7116320	7123320	localization is seen as pleasing all our fans because it's truly global and the methods in which we can localize now are vastly improved.
7123320	7128320	I think this is why you're seeing more of their games come out worldwide and you don't have that big gap.
7128320	7135320	Final Fantasy games used to come out years in advance over there, which is why we missed a bunch in the early days during the Super Nintendo days.
7135320	7139320	By the way, he went on to talk about the crowdfunding specifically.
7139320	7145320	I would love to try and work with that crowdfunding to find a way because ultimately we want to satisfy the demands of the fans.
7145320	7149320	I think also our fans are very rational. They understand and if we explain things, they often go,
7150320	7157320	Oh, I get that now. Thanks for explaining. They know it's complex or it's very expensive and it's not as simply, as you say, as using Google Translate.
7157320	7162320	You would not want to localize something through Google Translate. That wouldn't work.
7162320	7169320	I understand you sometimes have to actually go in and change the size.
7169320	7175320	I know that's what made translating a lot of the Super Nintendo games a bitch because they actually had to change the size of the cartridge
7175320	7179320	because English text is a different size than Japanese text.
7179320	7186320	Anyway, I won't get into all the this's and that's of that. I will move on to Jamie with her rapid fire news.
7186320	7189320	I have some news about Super Mario Maker.
7189320	7194320	They are doing some different costumes that have been out in Japan already.
7194320	7201320	One was Famitsu's Neki, the cat mascot. Another one is Game Center CX's Arino.
7202320	7212320	And so now there is going to be one based off of Yukio Sawada's manga called Super Mario-kun with big butt and big eyes.
7212320	7217320	It's supposed to be coming out November 6th and I kind of hope we get it here.
7217320	7225320	So moving on, they are doing Splatoon All-Star Collection plushies and they are available to pre-order now.
7225320	7234320	You can order them via Playasia in the US or I guess no matter where you are in the world, really, you can order them from Playasia.
7234320	7237320	They are supposed to be released on December 25th.
7237320	7244320	And then, last but not least, there is going to be a new Dead or Alive Xtreme this spring.
7244320	7252320	There will be Dead or Alive Xtreme 3 Fortune for PS4 and Dead or Alive Xtreme 3 Venus for Vita.
7253320	7256320	It's supposed to be on March 25th.
7256320	7271320	Fortune will be 95.04 yen and the collector's edition will be 149.04 and relatively a little bit cheaper for Vita.
7271320	7281320	The character roster is supposed to be Marie Rose, Ohonaka, Kasumi, Ayane, Kokoro, Niotengu, Hitomi, Momiji, and Helena.
7281320	7285320	So, there you go. Volleyball and boobs.
7285320	7288320	I'm sure you're very much looking forward to this, right, DarkSakura?
7288320	7292320	I just want Dan to get it so I can laugh about him playing dress-up.
7292320	7295320	It's Barbie for boys, right? That's just all it is.
7295320	7297320	Yeah, it's funny actually.
7297320	7303320	Alright, well, this is about the point in the show where we get to the foogle question of the week.
7304320	7308320	But I actually want to talk quickly about tonight's list list, which I hope...
7308320	7313320	There must have been a line where Shane and Flaco went. They're not back yet.
7313320	7315320	They went to Dunkin Donuts where I had to wait for 30 minutes.
7315320	7317320	Was the line really that bad over there?
7317320	7321320	Yeah, they finally opened at Dunkin here in NorCal and you know I want my coffee.
7321320	7325320	I can't handle the line that's over there right now. It's crazy.
7325320	7327320	So, you went there last night though, right?
7327320	7331320	Yeah, we were there for about 30 minutes and I got my favorite donut that they carry.
7331320	7332320	What was that?
7332320	7335320	It was the powdered donut with the chocolate cream.
7335320	7337320	Was the line going out the door like it was?
7337320	7339320	No, it was going into the bathroom.
7339320	7342320	We had people in the men's bathroom with the door open.
7342320	7344320	That's strange.
7344320	7346320	But they also had the pumpkin donuts. Those were pretty good.
7346320	7348320	The pumpkin spice ones.
7348320	7350320	And they were like regular cost.
7350320	7352320	And the chocolate cakes.
7352320	7354320	We're giving them free advertising right now.
7354320	7356320	Who the fuck cares? I love it.
7356320	7358320	It's the new thing here.
7358320	7360320	I bought two bags of coffee as well.
7360320	7365320	So, Dan was like, well, they have one in Roseville. I guess we'll get one in Elk Grove next because we have to do everything that Roseville does.
7365320	7367320	Probably.
7367320	7371320	Anyway, tonight's list list, just so you guys can start thinking about the topic.
7371320	7379320	We are going to do for tonight's list list, in celebration of the Nintendo Entertainment System's 30th anniversary, we're going to do a Nest Center topic.
7379320	7383320	We were going to do best Nintendo game ever, but we all know the Guardian Legend would win.
7383320	7385320	So, that's pretty much a moot point.
7385320	7389320	We're going to do the worst Nintendo game they ever made.
7389320	7391320	Is tonight's list list.
7391320	7393320	So, stay tuned for that. We will get to that shortly.
7393320	7396320	But first, the foogle question of the week.
7402320	7406320	Every week we visit our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.
7406320	7410320	And you take Facebook and Google and you slam those together and you get what everybody?
7410320	7412320	Foogle!
7412320	7414320	So, let's get to it.
7414320	7418320	This week's question, very similar to what we opened the show with tonight.
7418320	7422320	We asked our listeners about the 30th anniversary of the Nintendo Entertainment System.
7422320	7427320	And, you know, if they have a particular game that they have fond memories of from the NES days.
7427320	7431320	What is their one favorite NES game?
7431320	7433320	So, let's get to Google Plus first.
7433320	7438320	And Retertainment starts us off tonight simply saying Tetris.
7438320	7441320	That was an amazing NES game.
7441320	7447320	And the music still to this day gets stuck in your head and makes you think of falling bricks.
7447320	7450320	ActDeft over on Google Plus says there are so many to choose.
7450320	7454320	But if I only have to pick one, it would probably be Kirby's Adventure.
7454320	7456320	My first Kirby experience.
7456320	7458320	I'm not surprised at all to hear ActDeft picking that one.
7458320	7460320	But you know what's interesting about that?
7460320	7462320	That was kind of a later Nintendo release.
7462320	7464320	Kirby's release was really, it wasn't the last.
7464320	7466320	I know Warriors Woods was the last one.
7466320	7469320	Or that or StarTropics 2. One of those was the last one.
7469320	7476320	But that Kirby was kind of a later release for the NES.
7476320	7479320	Let's go over to Facebook where Stephen D. replies and says,
7479320	7483320	Zelda, I remember my friend slept over to pull an all-night Zelda-thon
7483320	7486320	only to find my brother took the nest to his friend's house.
7486320	7488320	We stared at the map that night.
7488320	7493320	I also recall being in tears because a dark nut wouldn't die.
7493320	7496320	That's right. Some of those things you had to know exactly how to kill them.
7496320	7498320	And otherwise you couldn't do it.
7498320	7503320	Renji221 responded and said, I think I would have to say Super Mario 3.
7503320	7507320	While I don't think it's the best in the series, that would be Mario World.
7507320	7510320	I do think it had really good levels and a nice set of power-ups.
7510320	7513320	I think for a lot of people those two games are neck and neck.
7513320	7519320	Fifth Dream says, it's so hard to pick, but I choose Kid Nicky, Radical Ninja.
7519320	7521320	It wasn't the best game and the graphics weren't great.
7521320	7524320	But I played it a lot despite dying constantly.
7524320	7530320	And the background soundtrack is the most awesome, annoying, repetitive, catchy, and memorable music ever.
7530320	7533320	The bosses were pretty silly and really fun to fight.
7533320	7536320	I had so much fun playing this and remember it fondly to this day.
7536320	7539320	I actually posted a little YouTube there of Kid Nicky. I remember that game.
7541320	7543320	Degenerate Johnny said, Metroid.
7543320	7546320	Not only was it the NES title I had the most fun playing,
7546320	7552320	but the idea of me playing a badass female character helped me get over the cootie phase of my life.
7552320	7554320	That's a good way of putting it.
7554320	7558320	That was so important what they did there with that game.
7558320	7560320	That whole twist ending.
7560320	7563320	That was very, very big in gaming.
7563320	7567320	Except Guardian Legend went all that from the very get-go of the game.
7567320	7569320	That is true, but it did come a few years after.
7569320	7571320	A little bit, yeah. But still.
7571320	7572320	That's true.
7573320	7576320	Cell Agent Why Not replies and says,
7576320	7580320	Has to be Metal Gear, hands down, then Super Mario Bros.
7580320	7587320	You know, some people, like purists, consider Metal Gear to be trash on the NES
7587320	7590320	because it's so different from the MSX version.
7590320	7594320	But I also understand, I'm actually not one of those people
7594320	7598320	because so many of us got introduced from that version
7598320	7601320	which to then hear it's a sub-par version is like,
7601320	7603320	my God, this game is amazing.
7603320	7605320	So, anyway, there you go.
7605320	7607320	SHO 100 Matt says,
7607320	7609320	It's so hard to pick one game.
7609320	7611320	While you might think I would say Blades of Steel,
7611320	7613320	I'm going to go with Super Mario Bros. 3.
7613320	7616320	The game had so much depth and challenge behind it
7616320	7618320	that you could beat it a dozen or so different ways.
7618320	7621320	Not only that, it was featured in one of the big movies from my childhood,
7621320	7623320	The Wizard.
7623320	7625320	It's so bad.
7625320	7627320	Joe G. replied and said,
7627320	7630320	Super Mario 3 because it was the first game I ever finished.
7630320	7632320	Well, that's important.
7632320	7634320	Mako Chan says,
7634320	7637320	Mickey Mouse Capade was my favorite and my first game
7637320	7640320	besides the one bundled with my system, Mario Bros. and Hogan's Alley.
7640320	7644320	My love for it is completely nostalgic as the game itself was annoying
7644320	7647320	and many pissed me off half the time,
7647320	7650320	but I had so much fun playing it when I was little.
7650320	7652320	Silent Tom says,
7652320	7654320	The Legend of Zelda, it's the game that has become a part of my life
7654320	7657320	and the music is something I always hear in my mind.
7657320	7659320	Dark Tetsuya says,
7659320	7661320	I'm sure I've told the story about a hundred times,
7661320	7663320	so I'll spare you guys and just say The Legend of Zelda.
7663320	7665320	Obviously, it was a very special game
7665320	7668320	having shipped on a glistening gold game pack,
7668320	7670320	which it was.
7670320	7672320	I saw a gold game pack today and I got so excited,
7672320	7674320	but it wasn't Zelda.
7674320	7676320	It was some other NES game they'd released.
7676320	7678320	By the way, Flocko and Chain are back in studio and brought food.
7678320	7680320	Thank you.
7680320	7682320	Dairy Queen!
7682320	7684320	Is this really a pumpkin blizzard?
7684320	7686320	I'm so excited.
7686320	7688320	It's pumpkin pie.
7688320	7690320	It's not baby poop, Chain.
7690320	7692320	Baby poop blizzard.
7692320	7694320	It looks like it.
7694320	7696320	Lastly, Master Claw says,
7696320	7698320	I know almost everyone has already said this,
7698320	7700320	but Super Mario Bros. 3,
7700320	7702320	I remember seeing it in trailers for the wizard
7702320	7704320	and in the movie itself and knowing I have to have it.
7704320	7706320	I remember my parents bringing me to electronics boutique
7706320	7708320	and buying it for me
7708320	7710320	and many, many years of playing it on my NES.
7710320	7714320	It's still one of my three favorite games.
7714320	7716320	There it is.
7716320	7718320	We're going to do a few more stories here
7718320	7720320	and then we're going to get to tonight's list list.
7720320	7722320	Worst Nintendo game ever.
7722320	7724320	It was a fukou question.
7724320	7726320	We didn't get to answer.
7726320	7728320	It was the same thing we did at the beginning of the show.
7728320	7730320	Yes, you did get to answer.
7730320	7732320	You changed your answer?
7732320	7734320	I picked two, which wasn't following the rules.
7734320	7736320	Now you're going to really not follow it.
7736320	7738320	I'm going to delete those two and pick just one
7738320	7740320	because I don't know why I didn't say it
7740320	7742320	and I didn't hear what the other people said.
7742320	7744320	Hopefully someone else called out too because it's amazing.
7744320	7746320	Did anybody say Contra?
7746320	7748320	I love Contra.
7748320	7750320	I played it so much.
7750320	7752320	I was able to beat that game with co-op
7752320	7754320	in under 20 minutes.
7754320	7756320	It was so much fun.
7756320	7758320	I started recording my runs on VCR
7758320	7760320	just to see, this is what I do.
7760320	7762320	Contra is pretty hard.
7762320	7764320	I know, but I got so good at it.
7764320	7766320	I think that's why I liked it so much.
7766320	7768320	Oh, that game is impossible.
7768320	7770320	Hello, employer. This is my resume.
7770320	7772320	Did you ever see the differences with the Japanese version?
7772320	7774320	I had extra animations that weren't in the US release.
7774320	7776320	I had no idea.
7776320	7778320	Yeah, there's comparisons online. They're pretty cool.
7778320	7780320	I love watching the speedruns of it,
7780320	7782320	but those guys kill their fingers.
7782320	7784320	They just mash, mash, mash, mash to get that.
7784320	7786320	You got to get that spread gun at a certain rate
7786320	7788320	where it actually shoots straight
7788320	7790320	but shoots so much at once
7790320	7792320	because something about the number of frames
7792320	7794320	that could be on screen, I don't know.
7794320	7796320	It was way over my head.
7796320	7798320	I didn't even do that stuff.
7798320	7800320	They could beat the game in 8 minutes or 10 minutes.
7801320	7803320	I don't know about right now,
7803320	7805320	but I think I tried to play it
7805320	7807320	on an emulator a few years ago,
7807320	7809320	and I was still pretty good at it,
7809320	7811320	but definitely not like I used to.
7811320	7813320	I could still beat it in 20 minutes,
7813320	7815320	but not without the Konami code.
7815320	7817320	I'd challenge you to come to my house,
7817320	7819320	sit down with my NES in the cartridge,
7819320	7821320	and run through it.
7821320	7823320	Oh my gosh, I would love to try it again,
7823320	7825320	especially with a real controller.
7825320	7827320	I would borrow somebody's box to stream that.
7827320	7829320	I would have to practice for streaming that.
7830320	7832320	I would get together with my friend Ken,
7832320	7834320	and we would just play that every weekend.
7834320	7836320	We were good at the co-op mode, too.
7836320	7838320	Even though you had to time things,
7838320	7840320	especially on the waterfall level,
7840320	7842320	where you're both in sync,
7842320	7844320	otherwise you kill each other.
7844320	7846320	We still used the Konami code on that,
7846320	7848320	but for single player, I would not use the Konami code.
7848320	7850320	That was one of the first experiences
7850320	7852320	of the dick your friends type of thing
7852320	7854320	where you could kill people on purpose.
7854320	7856320	That always goes over popular.
7856320	7858320	For me, it was one of the first games
7858320	7860320	for me. I didn't play a lot of games with friends.
7860320	7862320	I didn't have a ton of friends,
7862320	7864320	but that one was like,
7864320	7866320	oh yeah, let's play this every weekend.
7866320	7868320	So much fun.
7868320	7870320	You know the biggest dick your friends game was, Battle Toads.
7870320	7872320	That's a pretty big one, too.
7872320	7874320	Anyhow, let's get back into some news here.
7874320	7876320	Loki.
7876320	7878320	Apparently the launch for Metal Gear Online
7878320	7880320	was a little bit...
7880320	7882320	not great.
7882320	7884320	Most online games are like that,
7884320	7886320	but Konami is saying sorry
7886320	7890320	by giving everybody 3000 GP,
7890320	7893320	and then they're also extending the XP boost period
7893320	7895320	to three weeks instead of two.
7895320	7898320	And I wonder if you can use that...
7898320	7900320	if you're supposed to use that GP for the insurance
7900320	7902320	that they announced the other week, right?
7902320	7904320	They have to pay for real money for...
7904320	7906320	That's what I was just about to say,
7906320	7908320	so I can get the free insurance to block other players
7908320	7910320	from taking my shit.
7910320	7912320	Which I still don't...
7912320	7914320	Yeah.
7915320	7917320	Konami saying sorry?
7917320	7919320	Are they apologizing with Silent Hills?
7923320	7926320	See, that would have been the clickbait headline.
7926320	7928320	If VOG Network had a bunch of clickbait headlines,
7928320	7930320	that would have been it.
7930320	7933320	You won't believe what Konami just apologized for.
7933320	7935320	Click here to find out.
7935320	7937320	And then it would be a picture of Silent Hill,
7937320	7939320	but then when you click in the article,
7939320	7941320	it would just say like,
7941320	7943320	Konami has pissed a lot of people off over Silent Hill,
7943320	7944320	and then the picture under it would be,
7944320	7946320	but they talked about Metal Gear this week.
7946320	7947320	God.
7947320	7948320	All right.
7948320	7950320	Well, earlier I talked about some Nintendo data mining,
7950320	7952320	and this could be the reason
7952320	7954320	that there's some emergency maintenance going on,
7954320	7955320	or the likely not.
7955320	7958320	But some information was data mined from the Wii U eShop
7958320	7961320	about potential coming out games later,
7961320	7963320	like games that are on their way out.
7963320	7966320	For example, Contra Advance on the Game Boy Advance
7966320	7968320	was spotted for Wii U Virtual Console.
7968320	7971320	F-Zero Climax on the Game Boy Advance.
7971320	7973320	A bunch of Kirby games.
7973320	7974320	That should make it.
7974320	7976320	Kirby Canvas Curse and Kirby Mass Attack.
7976320	7978320	A lot of Zelda games.
7978320	7981320	Mega Man additional games.
7981320	7983320	Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.
7983320	7985320	Pokemon Ranger, Sonic Advance 2 and 3.
7985320	7987320	I mean, there's more games than I can really name here.
7987320	7990320	But what's also interesting, Wii games on the Wii U.
7990320	7993320	Kiki Trick, Kirby's Epic Yarn,
7993320	7995320	Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword.
7995320	7996320	That would be something to see that.
7996320	7998320	That was a later game release.
7998320	8001320	Metroid Other M, New Super Mario Brothers Wii,
8001320	8004320	Super Paper Mario, Wario Land Shake It Up,
8004320	8005320	Xenoblade Chronicles.
8005320	8007320	That could be interesting.
8007320	8010320	And then Wii U games, apparently spotted,
8010320	8015320	included The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess HD.
8015320	8017320	And that made a lot of people go,
8017320	8018320	huh?
8018320	8020320	But apparently, yeah,
8020320	8022320	The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess HD
8022320	8025320	was spotted on the Nintendo Update server.
8025320	8027320	And so now a lot of people are going,
8027320	8030320	is this something that maybe Nintendo is going to be releasing
8030320	8033320	to build up hype for the new Zelda game
8033320	8034320	or to hold this over?
8034320	8036320	Because they'll probably get delayed again.
8036320	8037320	I want it.
8037320	8038320	I want it bad.
8038320	8041320	And I saw a lot of people saying how upset they were
8041320	8043320	that that was a game that would be getting HD
8043320	8044320	because they all hate it.
8044320	8045320	And I don't understand why.
8045320	8047320	I thought it was a really good game.
8047320	8048320	I thought Twilight Princess was great.
8048320	8049320	It was good enough to name my cat after it.
8049320	8051320	Yeah, I thought Twilight Princess was great.
8051320	8056320	It's my second favorite 3D Zelda game, probably.
8056320	8057320	All right.
8057320	8059320	Maybe first.
8059320	8060320	All right.
8060320	8061320	Dark Soccer's got one more story for us
8061320	8063320	before we get into tonight's Listless.
8063320	8066320	The third annual Day of the Devs is coming back
8066320	8072320	on November 7th from 4 to 11th at the Midway in San Francisco.
8072320	8074320	So basically it's a celebration of indie games
8074320	8077320	and music that's being produced, sorry,
8077320	8080320	sponsored by Double Fine and I Am 8-Bit.
8080320	8085320	And this year is going to have game makers
8085320	8088320	showing off directly to their fans
8088320	8094320	who are interested in going hands-on along live music
8094320	8098320	from, is it Doseon or Dose One, I guess?
8098320	8101320	I don't know.
8101320	8103320	But anyway, they're going to have games,
8103320	8108320	some of them, Abzu, Adrift with a one in the middle,
8108320	8112320	Bad Blood Below, Botolo, Burly Men at Sea,
8112320	8115320	that sounds fun, Day of the Tentacle,
8115320	8121320	Death's Gambit, Donut Country, Fantastic Contraption,
8121320	8125320	Gang Beasts, Nog with a G, Hyper Light Drifter,
8125320	8128320	Night in the Woods, Outer Wilds, Overland, Oxenfree,
8128320	8131320	Pit People, Rising Thunder, Scale, Secret Legends,
8131320	8134320	Sound Self, Spy Party, Spy Party sounds fun,
8134320	8137320	Tacoma Thumper, Tilt Brush, Watch Ram,
8137320	8144320	What Remains of Edith Finch, Witch Marsh, and many more.
8144320	8150320	You can find out about it at dayofthedevs.com.
8150320	8153320	Mwahahaha.
8153320	8156320	I'm all for these type of events that, you know,
8156320	8159320	bring more light on what these hardworking indie folks are doing.
8159320	8161320	So why not?
8161320	8163320	Alright, let's do this.
8163320	8165320	We have not done this in quite some time,
8165320	8168320	but we are going to get into a list list.
8171320	8173320	Oh, it's been far too long since we've done this,
8173320	8178320	so let me explain how this highly scientific process works.
8178320	8181320	If you are listening live, unfortunately the podcast folks
8181320	8183320	aren't able to participate in this because this is something
8183320	8185320	that kind of plays out live.
8185320	8187320	But if you want to play along with us,
8187320	8190320	you can join our chatroom over at live.vognetworks.com
8190320	8193320	As long as you're logged into the VOG Network site
8193320	8195320	and you're actually in the chatroom,
8195320	8199320	you can actually participate if you're on that live page.
8199320	8201320	So we're going to put together a list,
8201320	8205320	and it is going to be the definitive list in the scientific process.
8205320	8207320	Everybody here in the studio will contribute to the list.
8207320	8210320	We're going to name our top three answers
8210320	8212320	with your help in the chatroom,
8212320	8214320	because sometimes when answers get duplicated and so forth,
8214320	8217320	we'll pull answers from the chatroom.
8217320	8219320	And then we're going to go around.
8219320	8222320	It's a very difficult, but it's a very important part of the process.
8222320	8227320	We each go around and eliminate one item that does not deserve to be on the list.
8227320	8231320	And then you guys will vote on your number one and your number two answer.
8231320	8239320	And again, tonight, what was the worst NES game they ever made?
8239320	8241320	So let's get into it.
8241320	8243320	I'm going to put that up on the board here.
8243320	8245320	I'm having to multitask a little bit here.
8245320	8248320	But of course, playing tonight here in the studio, myself, Rob Roberts.
8248320	8252320	Dark Sakura, Loki, and Flaco Jones, and Shana Linko.
8252320	8253320	So we have five players tonight.
8253320	8255320	This is a pretty heavy list.
8255320	8256320	We don't usually have five.
8256320	8258320	We usually have like three or four.
8258320	8264320	So what was the worst NES game they ever made?
8264320	8265320	All right, let's go to...
8265320	8268320	Showgirls.
8268320	8270320	Let's go first to...
8270320	8272320	I'll say Dark Sakura is going to go first.
8272320	8273320	Dark Sakura, ladies first.
8273320	8274320	Me? I don't want to.
8274320	8275320	Well, too bad.
8275320	8276320	Somebody's got to go first.
8276320	8277320	I will bite my butt.
8277320	8279320	Dark Sakura, what are you going to put on the list?
8279320	8282320	X-Men.
8282320	8283320	X-Men.
8283320	8285320	Why do you think the X-Men game on NES was terrible?
8285320	8286320	The X-Men game was shit.
8286320	8288320	It had poor collision detection.
8288320	8291320	If you were playing a character that wasn't ranged,
8291320	8294320	you'd just get overload so badly.
8294320	8297320	Plus the whole thing was kind of an overhead view.
8297320	8299320	It just really was not good.
8299320	8300320	It was the shit.
8300320	8302320	The shit as in literal shit.
8302320	8306320	Like someone ate it and pooped out a game.
8306320	8308320	Someone went to Marvel Comics,
8308320	8311320	ate a whole bunch of issues of uncanny X-Men,
8311320	8315320	and shat it in a Nintendo cartridge.
8315320	8318320	No, tell me how you really feel.
8318320	8321320	And I'm keeping my list just sticking with actual licensed stuff
8321320	8323320	and not any of the unlicensed stuff.
8323320	8324320	Fair enough, fair enough.
8324320	8326320	All right, that's not a condition.
8326320	8328320	Other people can do whatever they want with the list.
8328320	8332320	In fact, we're going to see what Loki is going to put now up on the list.
8332320	8337320	I kind of like this game, but it is still pretty bad.
8337320	8339320	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
8339320	8341320	Yeah, that was kind of bad.
8341320	8343320	And because of the water levels.
8343320	8344320	You stole one of my answers.
8344320	8345320	Yes, that was bad.
8345320	8347320	I did beat it though.
8347320	8350320	That's an interesting sign that so many people here in the studio are like,
8350320	8353320	yeah, dammit, I was going to pick that one as well.
8353320	8355320	But not to be confused with the arcade game.
8355320	8357320	No, no, not the arcade game.
8357320	8359320	The ultra games Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,
8359320	8361320	the one where you have four Ninja Turtles you get to play as,
8361320	8363320	one one dies.
8363320	8365320	Well, you're fucked unless you rest.
8365320	8368320	I think you can rescue them too or something like that.
8368320	8370320	I don't remember how that works.
8370320	8372320	It's been a while, so I don't remember.
8372320	8374320	Oh, you're starting fights in chat.
8374320	8377320	Act Def says TMNT was hard, but it wasn't bad.
8377320	8379320	And Alan Alchemy says, wow, rude.
8379320	8380320	I beat it a few times.
8380320	8382320	It was fucking hard, but I beat it.
8382320	8385320	I beat it too, but I'm just saying, you know, it was, you know.
8385320	8386320	All right.
8386320	8389320	I'm going to go next and I'm going to apologize to Flaco Jones
8389320	8392320	because I think it was something he was considering putting on the list.
8392320	8394320	But here's the thing.
8394320	8396320	I actually bought this.
8396320	8397320	Well, I didn't buy it.
8397320	8398320	I convinced my mom to buy it.
8398320	8402320	And I was so pissed that this game was so fucking terrible.
8402320	8404320	It really was one of the worst I ever played.
8404320	8409320	And it's such an important series as well for gaming.
8409320	8414320	I can't believe they fucked up Super Pitfall so fucking bad.
8414320	8416320	Have you played it?
8416320	8417320	It's god awful.
8417320	8421320	They made Pitfall Harry into like this blue hard hat Hector.
8421320	8422320	I don't know.
8422320	8423320	I did play it though.
8423320	8427320	And it's just like, yeah, it was awful, awful, awful, awful.
8427320	8431320	I would rather play Pitfall 2 on the Atari 2600.
8431320	8432320	All right.
8432320	8436320	Flaco Jones up next with your number three answer.
8436320	8438320	I decided not to pick that one and I'm glad I didn't.
8438320	8439320	I'm glad you didn't either.
8439320	8444320	I have Bible Adventures for the NES, which I don't know if a lot of people might have
8444320	8447320	seen that back on, again, Games Done Quick.
8447320	8451320	But I remember playing this one because I was a very active member of my youth group
8451320	8452320	and all that stuff.
8452320	8458320	So this was a game that was made just by a Christian video game company.
8458320	8460320	And so there were like a few different ventures.
8460320	8463320	It was like you played Noah's Ark, Baby Moses, or David and Goliath.
8463320	8467320	I remember the Moses one because you run around with Baby Moses like over your head,
8467320	8470320	like the way Mario carries a turnip in Mario 2.
8470320	8473320	And I think you could even like throw him, which is ridiculous.
8473320	8476320	I saw the pictures of like, what was it, I think Noah.
8476320	8478320	He's carrying animals that way too.
8478320	8480320	Yeah, and he carries like stacks of animals.
8480320	8481320	It's so ridiculous.
8481320	8484320	It's like, you know, it's, they want to make games to make the Bible cool for kids,
8484320	8486320	but they are not necessarily the best at making games.
8486320	8488320	But they've made a lot, I think.
8488320	8490320	I remember them talking about this on Games Done Quick.
8490320	8493320	They made a lot of games and this was like the NES one.
8493320	8496320	So that's why I picked that one because I remember playing that as a kid
8496320	8499320	and I'm like, this is weird.
8499320	8500320	All right, good.
8500320	8501320	I do hear that one come up a lot.
8501320	8502320	I sure do.
8502320	8505320	I do want to clarify in the chat, AkumaJP was asking,
8505320	8508320	is it just Famicom, Super Nintendo, I mean, or all Nintendo consoles?
8508320	8512320	Since we are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the NES in America tonight,
8512320	8514320	we are keeping it to NES.
8514320	8517320	I suppose if somebody wants to put a Famicom game on the list,
8517320	8520320	it wouldn't be off limits, but I don't think anyone in here
8520320	8523320	has especially fond memories of Famicom games.
8523320	8527320	Maybe Jamie with the vault, but I have a feeling those games will avoid her list.
8527320	8528320	But we'll see.
8528320	8533320	Tigerclaw posted me a link to a game called That Damn Level,
8533320	8535320	which is, it's a...
8535320	8536320	Oh, Mario Maker thing, right?
8536320	8537320	No, no.
8537320	8542320	It's an independent game based on the level from Ninja Turtles.
8542320	8546320	You cruel bastards.
8546320	8547320	All right.
8547320	8549320	Shane Alinko with your number three answer.
8549320	8551320	I just had to come up with this off the top of my head
8551320	8556320	because low-key taking Ninja Turtles just threw my list out of whack.
8556320	8558320	So I'm going to say Snake, Rattle, and Roll
8558320	8561320	because I had fond memories of it when I was a kid,
8561320	8566320	but then when I saw you play it on the Rare Replay collection,
8566320	8570320	I don't know if I was given drugs as a kid
8570320	8572320	or if I was just really dumb.
8572320	8575320	But it was such a bad-looking game.
8575320	8579320	It's like, oh, I'm this snake that gets longer but attacks jumping feet.
8579320	8581320	I think that's Tiara's favorite NES game.
8581320	8582320	Is it really?
8582320	8585320	It's another one of those games that doesn't make a whole lot of sense
8585320	8586320	until you like...
8586320	8589320	I don't think it holds up either.
8589320	8594320	Maybe if I was like five or six again when it came out the first time,
8594320	8595320	I'd still like it.
8595320	8599320	But since I'm not, it's pretty awful.
8599320	8600320	All right.
8600320	8601320	Well, this is a pretty interesting list so far.
8601320	8604320	So far, the list consists of X-Men, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,
8604320	8608320	Super Pitfall, Bible Adventures, and Snake, Rattle, and Roll.
8608320	8609320	Let's get to number two answers.
8609320	8612320	Dark Sakura, what is the worst NES game they ever made?
8612320	8616320	Okay, since we are going off the beaten path,
8616320	8619320	I am going to go ahead and name Cheetah Men 2.
8619320	8621320	And that's men plural.
8621320	8623320	Cheetah Men 2.
8623320	8625320	I hope I spelled this right, but does it really matter?
8625320	8626320	Let's be honest.
8626320	8627320	Cheetah Men 2.
8627320	8630320	It's basically some game that hardly anyone's ever heard of.
8630320	8635320	It's completely unreleased, and it even actually plays like it's unfinished.
8635320	8639320	It's a side-scrolling platformer.
8639320	8643320	It's just shit, but it had to be on the list because it's so shitty.
8643320	8646320	Actually, if you want to see a really good review of it,
8646320	8648320	Angry Video Game Nerd did one.
8648320	8649320	All right.
8649320	8650320	Yeah.
8650320	8655320	Cheetah Men 2 is like the things don't even touch you and you die.
8655320	8657320	It's that bad.
8657320	8658320	All right.
8658320	8659320	Fair enough.
8659320	8662320	Let's go to Loki with your number two answer.
8662320	8666320	My number two answer is going to be Back to the Future 2 and 3
8666320	8668320	because they did both movies into one game.
8668320	8671320	And I remember reading about Back to the Future, the first game,
8671320	8674320	and I was like, oh, hey, that looks pretty cool.
8674320	8678320	And I played this game, and I'm like, wow, this game is really stupid.
8678320	8682320	And you have to play all the way through Back to the Future 2
8682320	8685320	to get to Back to the Future 3, and then I found a code for it,
8685320	8688320	and Back to the Future 3 is still fucking lame.
8688320	8690320	So it was just, I don't know.
8690320	8693320	Yeah, you think like, oh, it's going to be awesome, like two movies in one.
8693320	8695320	It was like some side-scrolling thing,
8695320	8699320	and the hoverboard looks stupid, and the whole thing was just garbage.
8699320	8701320	And it had nothing to do with the movie.
8701320	8703320	Pretty much, yes.
8703320	8705320	All right, my number two answer,
8705320	8707320	and I feel like I'm going to take somebody's answer
8707320	8709320	because this one was really bad,
8709320	8711320	and it was one of the launch titles for the NES,
8711320	8714320	and this makes it particularly worrisome.
8714320	8718320	But you know, in the 80s, they had to show us the good
8718320	8720320	that video games could do
8720320	8723320	and the edutainment purposes of video games,
8723320	8726320	which is why we had such a popular, iconic character
8726320	8730320	like Donkey Kong Jr. teaching us math.
8730320	8735320	That's right, Donkey Kong Jr. math is my number two answer.
8735320	8738320	And if you've never seen it, it was basically like
8738320	8741320	they kind of took one of the boards from Donkey Kong Jr.
8741320	8745320	and made math equations out of it, and it was number one.
8745320	8748320	I only knew about that game because of Animal Crossing.
8748320	8751320	That's right, it was one of the games Animal Crossing.
8751320	8753320	Yes, I think that's where a lot of us played it
8753320	8754320	and got very upset.
8754320	8756320	That's the game that's coming to Virtual Console,
8756320	8757320	that they have to get the trademark.
8757320	8759320	Problem, right?
8759320	8761320	Hey, look, you can learn things on your Wii U
8761320	8762320	about long division.
8762320	8764320	Actually, I think it was all addition subtraction,
8764320	8767320	but it was garbage, so there it is.
8767320	8770320	Donkey Kong Jr. math is my number two pick.
8770320	8772320	Flaco Jones, you're next, your number two pick.
8772320	8774320	All right, I keep going back and forth.
8774320	8776320	I don't think I'm going to mention the game I mentioned earlier.
8776320	8777320	I don't know.
8777320	8779320	I'll do a different one.
8779320	8780320	Yes, no, maybe I'll save that one.
8780320	8781320	I'll save that one for last.
8781320	8785320	Okay, so this pick is Top Gun.
8785320	8787320	Was anyone able to beat that game?
8787320	8788320	Yes.
8788320	8791320	How do you land on the aircraft carrier after the first level?
8791320	8792320	The first level I can land.
8792320	8794320	After that, I can't land anymore.
8794320	8797320	How do you fucking refuel in that game?
8797320	8798320	I can refuel.
8798320	8799320	I can get that every once in a while.
8799320	8802320	But what sucks is if you fail to refuel,
8802320	8804320	you still got to fly around until you die.
8804320	8807320	Well, you're not going to make it, but just fly around for a while.
8807320	8809320	You had the sex in that game.
8809320	8811320	You had the sex with the refuel.
8811320	8812320	What was the same as the aircraft thing?
8812320	8813320	It was the same as landing.
8813320	8817320	You had to be like, left, left, left, right, right, right, up, down, pull up, up.
8817320	8819320	And it's like, nope, too late, couldn't do it.
8819320	8820320	The plane flies away.
8820320	8822320	I'm like, oh, good, I'm going to die, but I still got to play.
8822320	8825320	Darsakra, you said you can actually do it?
8825320	8826320	You could beat that game.
8826320	8828320	It's been ages, but yeah, I beat it when I was 11.
8828320	8832320	I swear, I get so close on level two to land on the aircraft carrier.
8832320	8835320	And it says, pull up.
8836320	8842320	I watched one of those videos that have the play throughs on them
8842320	8844320	that you would buy on VHS.
8844320	8849320	And it had the tips on how to hook up to the aircraft carrier
8849320	8851320	and how to refuel and everything.
8851320	8854320	And once I wrote down the numbers that you had to have
8854320	8858320	to get the nose up just right and the wings just right,
8858320	8860320	then I aced it every time.
8860320	8861320	I can see you having the numbers help.
8861320	8862320	I guess it never went that far.
8862320	8863320	I just got so mad.
8863320	8864320	I was like, screw this game forever.
8864320	8867320	Once you had the numbers, then it was like, oh, okay.
8867320	8869320	Let's do the research for Zelda.
8869320	8871320	I can't do that on the Top Gun. I got so angry.
8871320	8874320	Even though I honestly didn't have too much of a fun time with it,
8874320	8875320	I just beat it to prove I could.
8875320	8876320	All right.
8876320	8878320	Darsakra, we need to see how much you can remember.
8878320	8881320	You have some pretty lofty gaming accomplishments here.
8881320	8883320	I'm like, I would like to see you do Mega Man blindfolded.
8883320	8884320	That would be a lot of fun.
8884320	8886320	I don't think I could do that anymore.
8886320	8888320	I mean, shoot, do you want to know how many times?
8888320	8890320	You'd be surprised what comes back with muscle memory.
8890320	8891320	Oh my God.
8891320	8893320	But do you want to know how many times it took me to do that
8893320	8894320	the first time?
8894320	8895320	That's true.
8895320	8897320	Is I actually had to play through that level
8897320	8899320	something like 10 times.
8899320	8902320	They blindfolded me and I did it again.
8902320	8904320	When I played the Mega Man collection on that,
8904320	8906320	because that just came out a long ago.
8906320	8907320	Timing on that one's bad, by the way.
8907320	8908320	Is it?
8908320	8909320	It is. The timing's off.
8909320	8910320	Okay, because it took me a couple tries,
8910320	8912320	but then I was finally able to do the Quick Man thing.
8912320	8915320	But I was surprised how much would just be muscle memory.
8915320	8917320	I knew things to fall down.
8917320	8918320	We compared it.
8918320	8921320	We took the actual cartridge versus the collection.
8921320	8923320	And yeah, timing is off in Quick Man's stage.
8923320	8924320	Interesting.
8924320	8926320	All right, s2100matt says,
8926320	8929320	Clearly Flaco wants Konami to apologize for Top Gun.
8929320	8930320	Possibly.
8930320	8932320	s2100matt says, I still have muscle memory
8932320	8934320	for some classic DDR step charts,
8934320	8936320	even after not playing DDR for years.
8936320	8938320	Oh yeah, every time I hear like Orion 7-8,
8938320	8939320	I hear it just in my mind,
8939320	8942320	duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.
8942320	8943320	You just hear the step patterns in your mind.
8943320	8945320	Anyway, nerd, nerd, nerd.
8945320	8946320	All right, speaking of nerd,
8946320	8950320	Shane, what is your number two worst NES game ever?
8950320	8953320	So I'm going to explain why it is before I say what it is.
8953320	8954320	Okay.
8954320	8958320	So this game is terrible
8958320	8961320	because it's way too difficult for what it should be.
8961320	8965320	And for the license it is, it also should not be difficult.
8965320	8967320	And it also scared me as a kid.
8967320	8970320	So my number two game is Mickey Mousecapades.
8970320	8975320	Didn't somebody say that was their favorite game earlier?
8975320	8977320	Oh no, that's fighting words.
8977320	8979320	So what was it about Mickey Mousecapades
8979320	8981320	you just, it was too frustrating.
8981320	8982320	It was scary and frightening.
8982320	8983320	Why was it scary?
8983320	8985320	I don't know, a lot of games scared me when I was a kid.
8985320	8988320	My number one game also scared me as a kid.
8988320	8990320	I think you get scared easy.
8990320	8994320	It was, and I love Silent Hill and stuff like that.
8994320	8996320	That's not nearly as scary as Cat in the Hat
8996320	8999320	and picks up the mix-up,
8999320	9003320	which is a scarring game for me.
9003320	9005320	Didn't I find footage on YouTube of that and you started crying?
9005320	9006320	I did not like it.
9006320	9008320	I did not like it.
9008320	9011320	But yeah, it wasn't very fun.
9011320	9013320	It's a Mickey game.
9013320	9015320	It should be not super difficult.
9015320	9017320	But as a kid that game was just so hard.
9017320	9019320	And why are they throwing stars?
9019320	9021320	When did Mickey and Minnie start throwing stars?
9021320	9023320	When they became ninjas.
9023320	9024320	But they weren't ninjas.
9024320	9026320	And Minnie was so frustrating.
9026320	9031320	Alright, anyhow, folks in chat predicting that will be an early elimination in the next round.
9031320	9033320	But we can't, we're not there yet.
9033320	9036320	So far the list contains X-Men, Cheetahmen 2, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,
9036320	9037320	Back to the Future 2 and 3,
9037320	9042320	Super Pitfall, Donkey Kong Jr. Math, Bible Adventures, Top Gun, Snake Rattle and Roll, Mickey Mousecapades.
9042320	9045320	We've got room for five more for now, so let's get to it.
9045320	9049320	Dark Sakura, the worst NES game they ever made.
9049320	9050320	Don't hate me, please.
9050320	9052320	I'm gonna, but what is it?
9052320	9053320	Castlevania 2, Simon's Quest.
9053320	9056320	Oh, fuck! You're going for the jugular!
9056320	9059320	Damn! No way! No way!
9059320	9061320	What? Okay, but why?
9061320	9066320	Because it broke the mold of Castlevania games and not in a good way.
9066320	9075320	It was like trying to play a Castlevania RPG that didn't want to be an RPG and didn't want to be a Castlevania game.
9075320	9077320	It really was just...
9077320	9081320	I feel like that's what led us to Symphony of the Night.
9081320	9085320	No, I think Metroid led its way to Symphony of the Night.
9085320	9090320	This one, you're walking around outside and you're talking to villagers and shit.
9090320	9094320	And even if it did, it took the few good qualities from it.
9094320	9097320	It was hard as fuck, first of all.
9097320	9104320	And then the only good thing about it was what a terrible night to have a curse.
9104320	9106320	The music, though.
9106320	9107320	The music was great.
9107320	9110320	I mean, I'm just saying going strictly gameplay...
9110320	9111320	It's alright.
9111320	9114320	I have a feeling this is the round where we're all gonna kick each other in the balls.
9114320	9116320	So, you know, metaphorically.
9116320	9118320	Well, I mean, it just don't...
9118320	9123320	It was a big disappointment to me because Castlevania was fantastic.
9123320	9126320	Castlevania 3 was fantastic.
9126320	9131320	Every Castlevania game, even Dracula X on the Super Nintendo,
9131320	9137320	which was no way as good as the PC Engine version, was better than this.
9137320	9141320	You are entitled to your opinion even when you are extremely wrong.
9144320	9145320	Hearts.
9145320	9146320	Girl.
9146320	9147320	Alright, anyway.
9147320	9150320	My number one will not be popular either, but we'll see.
9150320	9152320	Loki, here it is, your number one answer.
9152320	9154320	The worst NES game they ever made.
9154320	9158320	Okay, so, like, all these games have been mentioned have been games I actually played,
9158320	9163320	and I actually played this too because we rented a ton of fucking games back in the NES days.
9163320	9166320	And this game was so fucking weird.
9166320	9169320	And I guess it makes sense because what the hell are you gonna do in a type of game like this
9169320	9174320	that's based off this license, but the worst game I probably played was Barbie.
9174320	9176320	The Barbie game.
9176320	9178320	And it was fucking weird.
9178320	9183320	Just like shoes and shit bouncing up and down, like purses, and like, I don't know.
9183320	9187320	It was a weird fucking hard game for girls, I guess, to play.
9187320	9190320	And it's just, I don't know, it's silly.
9190320	9192320	Alright, there it is.
9192320	9195320	Barbie is the worst video game they ever made.
9195320	9198320	It is kind of shit though, I have to be honest.
9198320	9200320	I mean, it had some impossible jumps and so forth.
9200320	9202320	Alright, we'll see.
9202320	9207320	Alright, my number one pick for the worst NES game they ever did make.
9207320	9209320	You ready? Because not everybody's gonna agree with me.
9209320	9212320	But I think this game is super fucking overrated,
9212320	9215320	and it's one of those games when you sit there and you play it again, you're like,
9215320	9217320	this game is trash.
9217320	9222320	And what's also huge about this game is that it's the game that everybody remembers
9222320	9225320	around a particular peripheral they made for the NES,
9225320	9229320	even though there were way better games that used the same peripheral,
9229320	9234320	which is why Duck Hunt is the worst video game on the NES.
9235320	9238320	Duck Hunt is the worst. No, come on!
9238320	9241320	Who actually sat there and played the game the way it meant to be played?
9241320	9243320	It was just everybody sitting in front of the TV,
9243320	9246320	you couldn't kill the dog who was a total twat,
9246320	9248320	everybody wanted to kill the damn dog and you couldn't.
9248320	9251320	No, I played it the right way. I didn't just go up to the TV and hold my gun there.
9251320	9253320	I'm just saying...
9253320	9255320	I would play the clay pigeon a lot.
9255320	9257320	Yeah, clay pigeon game was fun too.
9257320	9259320	I'm just saying Hogan's Alley was a better light gun game.
9259320	9261320	I do love Hogan's Alley, but Duck Hunt's awesome.
9261320	9263320	No it's not.
9264320	9266320	Overrated. Overrated.
9266320	9269320	I was only happy when the dog was announced for Smash Brothers
9269320	9271320	so I could kick its ass.
9271320	9273320	That was really all it was.
9273320	9276320	Some folks in chat getting really mad at me for that answer.
9276320	9278320	Well, all I have to say is...
9280320	9283320	No one actually disagreed with me over Castlevania, by the way.
9284320	9287320	They know better than to disagree with you.
9287320	9290320	I love Castlevania 2. It's like one of my favorite Castlevania games.
9290320	9293320	I know. I think all four of us will be eliminating Castlevania.
9293320	9295320	That's what happens. That's what happens.
9295320	9297320	We'll see. We'll see.
9297320	9300320	Moving on though. Flaco Jones, your number one answer.
9300320	9302320	I keep going back and forth.
9302320	9305320	I was going to pick Ten Yard Fight, but it's a sports game, so who cares?
9305320	9308320	So I'm going to pick the game I talked about at the beginning with Shane, which is Trojan.
9308320	9310320	Which Shane likes, I guess.
9310320	9313320	I don't know why I'm picking a game to argue with Shane about.
9313320	9317320	I just remember everybody associating it with condoms.
9317320	9319320	That's all I remember.
9319320	9321320	Just because it's called Trojan?
9321320	9325320	Yeah, Trojan's always been... I don't know. Whatever.
9325320	9327320	I don't know what to do.
9327320	9331320	It's another game that I just kind of got as a hand-me-down, because I did most of my games.
9331320	9333320	So I just played it, and I was like,
9333320	9337320	this game is so weird. You've got to kneel down and swing your sword a bunch of times to kill things.
9337320	9342320	I did kind of like the mode where you get to fight your friend, but even that was just so weird.
9342320	9345320	You got to jump using the up button. They didn't have a dedicated jump button.
9345320	9348320	It's always so bothersome in a game like that.
9348320	9350320	But there's some cool power-ups you get.
9350320	9352320	But I just couldn't get very far in it.
9352320	9354320	The graphics look kind of lame.
9354320	9356320	It's a Capcom game, right?
9356320	9360320	Yeah, so it's like when you've got Mega Man and Bionic Commando, and then you have this.
9360320	9365320	Sometimes they make that one choice in the game that just ruins the whole fucking thing.
9365320	9370320	I was really going to go for Blood and put Rygar on my list, because he didn't have a fucking save chip.
9370320	9373320	How can you beat Rygar? You can't.
9373320	9374320	Dan can.
9374320	9376320	Well, Dan's insane.
9376320	9378320	I don't think you can save on Trojan, either.
9378320	9381320	No, you have to play straight through Trojan, too. I just couldn't do it.
9381320	9388320	Alright. Anyway, here we go. One more space on the list here, and it's going to belong to Shane Alinko.
9388320	9390320	Shane, what is the worst NES game they ever made?
9390320	9396320	Okay, again, this game's there because terrible choice for what they're doing with the license.
9396320	9401320	It was really hard, and it scared me even more than Mickey Mouse paid.
9401320	9405320	My number one choice is Bart vs. the Space Mutants.
9407320	9408320	Such a bad game.
9408320	9410320	I actually don't remember Bart vs. the Space Mutants.
9410320	9411320	It's not good.
9411320	9412320	What happened in that one?
9412320	9417320	Aliens were trying to take over, and in the first stage, you had to color things not purple,
9417320	9419320	because they're a machine to take over the world.
9419320	9423320	They had to have purple things, so you would spray paint over that with red.
9423320	9427320	And then the second stage is, you've got to collect hats, because their new machine requires hats.
9427320	9428320	Wow.
9428320	9430320	Yeah, it was really bad.
9430320	9435320	I remember Bart and the Nightmare, the Bart dream nightmare, but that was Super Nintendo.
9435320	9437320	That wasn't quite as bad.
9437320	9439320	But it was kind of crap.
9439320	9441320	All right, wow, there it is.
9441320	9445320	I'm going to read through this list, but I want to acknowledge some of our chat room comments here.
9445320	9448320	I was trying to see what they were saying back towards the beginning.
9448320	9449320	Did we get some people yelling answers?
9449320	9453320	Silver Surfer was shouted out in the chat room there.
9453320	9455320	The Adventures of the Link.
9455320	9457320	Non-silon-occupied Caprica.
9457320	9459320	I don't think that was actually a game, though.
9459320	9462320	Not that kind of list list tonight.
9463320	9465320	Even Flaco was like, wait a minute, you're doing a list list?
9465320	9467320	You don't have silly answers?
9467320	9471320	I was like, well, you know people are going to go for blood by putting a game that's considered good on the list.
9471320	9474320	I honestly can't remember a serious answer list list.
9474320	9476320	I don't know why.
9476320	9480320	It must have happened. I've only been listening for eight years.
9480320	9482320	Maybe before that, Flaco.
9482320	9484320	Anyway, be thinking about this, guys.
9484320	9488320	Here it is. Here's the list as it stands now, but we have one more very important round.
9488320	9490320	So far, here is the list.
9490320	9505320	X-Men, Cheetahmen 2, Castlevania II, Simon's Quest, Bible Adventures, Top Gun, Trojan, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Back to the Future 2 and 3, Barbie, Snake, Rattle and Roll, Mickey Mouse Capades, Bart vs. the Space Mutants, Super Pitfall, Donkey Kong Jr. Math, and Duck Hunt.
9505320	9510320	Let's just, you know, I realize there's a few controversial choices on here, but I think we did a pretty good job.
9510320	9513320	I think this is a pretty good list that we got so far.
9513320	9519320	But here we go. Here is that round. You gotta do it. It's part of the process.
9519320	9521320	Now it's time for the elimination round.
9521320	9523320	Dark Sakura, ladies first.
9523320	9526320	Which of these is not worthy of the list?
9529320	9534320	I am going to take off...
9537320	9539320	For Tiara, I'll take off Snake, Rattle and Roll.
9539320	9543320	For Tiara, she's taken off Snake, Rattle and Roll.
9543320	9544320	They're all pretty bad.
9544320	9547320	It has been stricken from the list. It wasn't that bad, Shane.
9547320	9551320	It wasn't that bad. At least that wasn't one of the ones that scared you.
9551320	9562320	Alright. Do remember though, in a revision to the listless rules we made a couple years ago, if a host loses two of their answers, the other will get immunity and cannot be removed.
9562320	9566320	So if one of Shane's other answers disappears, the third will get immunity.
9566320	9571320	Let's see what happens though. Up next is Loki. Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?
9571320	9572320	I'd say Simon's Quest.
9572320	9576320	Simon's Quest. I think Dark Sakura knew she was losing that one.
9576320	9577320	I'm just keeping it real.
9577320	9581320	I'm just keeping it real. Alright, there it is. It has been stricken from the list.
9581320	9583320	Castlevania II, Simon's Quest has been removed.
9583320	9585320	Ooh, that means it's my turn.
9586320	9589320	Which one am I going to remove from this?
9589320	9603320	I'm really tempted to take one of Shane's off, but I think I'm going to go for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because Alan got really offended, so I feel like if I don't remove that...
9603320	9606320	I kind of like how Dark Sakura did hers for Tiara. I'm doing this one for Alan.
9606320	9611320	So I'm taking Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles off the list. It has been removed from the list.
9611320	9616320	Flaco Jones, three down, two to go. Flaco, which of these is not worthy of the list?
9616320	9617320	Goodbye, Duck Hunt.
9617320	9618320	Duck Hunt.
9618320	9619320	Duck Hunt!
9619320	9620320	Yeah!
9620320	9621320	I knew I was going to lose that one.
9621320	9622320	I'm so glad it was still there.
9622320	9627320	Alright, Duck Hunt has been removed from the list wrongfully by Flaco Jones.
9627320	9631320	Alright, Shane, I just want to point out Flaco's list is still intact, but...
9631320	9632320	I'm taking off Trojan.
9632320	9633320	I knew it!
9633320	9634320	Trojan!
9634320	9635320	I knew it!
9637320	9640320	It's like, it's pretty easy. It's softball.
9640320	9642320	Why did you choose? Are you a big fan of Trojan?
9642320	9645320	Yes, I loved Trojan when I was a kid. That was a fun game.
9645320	9646320	Why?
9646320	9647320	I wouldn't like it now.
9647320	9648320	Alright.
9648320	9651320	But I was like five, so lots of things were fun at five.
9651320	9657320	This is, this is, everybody lost one answer. That's pretty good for five people. Everybody lost one.
9657320	9660320	I know, I expected some people to go down to just one answer.
9660320	9662320	I thought I was going to take Mickey Mouse campaigns off.
9662320	9664320	Why? It was terrible.
9664320	9668320	Because then I would have to hear it from Alan. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is not that bad.
9668320	9674320	Well, there's no way anyone's going to defend Back to the Future 2 and 3 or Barbie the game, because they're both fucking terrible.
9674320	9685320	Alright, so here we go. It is about time for you to vote. Remember, when you do vote at vognetwork.com, you click on your number one answer, then your number two answer.

9721320	9726320	And we will get to the top answers in just a little bit, probably after the mailbag.
9726320	9729320	But for now, oh, it's actually time for the mailbag. Let's get to it.
9729320	9736320	Dark Soccer's going to dive into our mailbag. Participate at orangelaungeradio.com, where I think we actually got quite a few emails tonight. I'm excited.
9736320	9738320	And they're all sticky.
9738320	9740320	I'm excited for one of them that I heard about.
9740320	9742320	Oh boy, alright, let's get to it.
9742320	9748320	Participate at orangelaungeradio.com if you want to send us an email. We have three of them tonight, so let's get to it, Dark Soccer.
9748320	9753320	This is titled Power Portals with a Z. Thank you, Canada.
9754320	9763320	I'm planning on getting my dad into Ingress on his 5C, even though it's only a 16GB model. So is mine, don't worry about it. Mine's a 5S, though.
9763320	9774320	As for me, can you recommend the game on devices dependent on WiFi? No, it just says recommend the game on devices dependent on WiFi.
9774320	9781320	I really can't, just to be fair. Which, by the way, I don't know when this turned into the Ingress podcast. I'm not sure how I feel about that.
9781320	9790320	But I would say no. WiFi, you have to be able to go out to places of interest. In fact, if you're on a really strict data plan, don't do it either.
9790320	9797320	You have to be able to have enough data. It eats up a lot of data. It does eat up a lot of data, so just be mindful.
9797320	9811320	While it's obviously not his demographic, has Shane seen the Fisher-Price MMPR Imaginext line, including the 2-foot tall Megazord playset?
9811320	9822320	Yes, clearly he has. Interesting. Also weird that the current Monster slash Halloween-themed LEGO minifigure series blind bags are perpetually sold out.
9822320	9830320	Finally, while it's not exactly cave quality, have any of you checked out Shootie Skies? Fairly serious megalomania vibe there.
9830320	9834320	And that comes from Robert M. No, I have not.
9834320	9838320	Yeah, I can't say I've played that one either.
9838320	9840320	So the answer is no.
9840320	9844320	Alright, moving forward. Kind of long email.
9844320	9850320	Gotta say I'm with you on Rock Band 4, Rob. I was expecting and hoping for a lot more from Rock Band 4.
9850320	9857320	Not only removing keys and skimming on character creation, like you mentioned, but also taking out Pro Guitar and even online.
9857320	9864320	I can see their reasoning. Their data and polls suggested that most of the features they removed were the less used ones.
9864320	9868320	It's still kind of disappointing to compare Rock Band 3 and Rock Band 4.
9868320	9876320	I'm still enjoying the game as the basic gameplay is still great, but I keep thinking, maybe I should just toss in Rock Band 3 instead.
9876320	9882320	I was just going to say, just quickly, there was not enough additions to make up for the subtractions.
9882320	9889320	And that's the problem. So big fucking deal, they added this solo thing that's kind of, I don't really care for the solo thing at all, actually, the way they did it.
9889320	9898320	I preferred it the old way. I did play a little more Rock Band 4 this week, and to be fair on some of my criticisms last week,
9898320	9905320	I did find that this time, if I was able to go into DLC that I knew I'd bought, even if it said $1.99, I was able to download it for free.
9905320	9908320	So I got the rest of my No Doubt album and some of the other things I knew I had.
9908320	9914320	But it's still, I can't say it's a better game than Rock Band 3.
9914320	9919320	So again, if you need the Rock Band experience on a current console, okay, great. I mean, Rock Band is still a good game.
9919320	9926320	I would have still recommended Rock Band 1 and 2, but it's just, it's a little disappointing. I was expecting a little more. That's all.
9926320	9934320	As for the DLC issue, I was having similar issues on PS4. Some song packs not showing up properly or not downloading or whatever.
9934320	9939320	At the very least, they've been working pretty hard on fixing that stuff.
9939320	9944320	Just in the week that the game's been out, I've had several songs go from not working to working.
9944320	9951320	Sucks to have to keep checking back given the volume of songs to scroll through, but that's also probably what's taking them so long.
9951320	9960320	There's a thread on their forum where you can communicate any DLC issues you have, and I suggest going in there if you're finding stuff that's not working.
9960320	9969320	I agree that I wish there were some easier way to find the songs you own, but sadly I think that's the problem with PSN and Xbox Live.
9969320	9972320	Not so much something Harmonix could have changed.
9972320	9985320	If there's a silver lining that the game has been getting decent enough reviews, Harmonix has said that they consider Rock Band 4 to be a platform, and they are game to add in new features as time goes on.
9985320	9991320	So hopefully enough people are picking up the game to make that worth their while. That comes from Andy R.
9991320	10002320	Thank you for the email, Andy R. Hey, Diablo 3 got fixed. Destiny got fixed. That's this weird thing about where we're at with gaming these days.
10002320	10010320	So you know what? Maybe they can make some patches and make Rock Band 4 get some more of those pluses to make up for some of the minuses.
10011320	10014320	Alright, last email. It's a little bit of a long one, but I'll read it.
10014320	10021320	Hello, OLR. And if this is actually your real legitimate name, I am sorry for sitting on air, but it looks like a nickname.
10021320	10034320	So, James Nighthawk here. I've been listening for about six months now after hearing about the show from Rob while guesting with the crazy chaps on Koopa Club, and I've been meaning to email to say hi.
10034320	10039320	Recently someone suggested on your show that Rob's superpowers should be making people start podcasts.
10040320	10047320	Well, I just wanted to say that you guys at OLR are in no small part responsible for myself starting my own podcast this summer.
10047320	10053320	I am a songwriter and music producer by trade. I have been an active member of Songwriting Forum for years.
10053320	10065320	It was after listening to OLR Koopa Club and a few other indie podcasts that I realized that it is a passion and personality that really matter to giving a podcast a unique edge.
10065320	10075320	I have listened to bigger budget podcasts for years from the likes of the BBC and such, but the smaller indie podcasts seem to allow a freedom of expression that really appeals to me.
10075320	10086320	Can I just jump in real quick? First off, if he's a songwriter, I don't think he's going to mind at all. I'm pretty sure I saw a tweet from this person this week, and I don't think they're going to mind at all that you said their name.
10087320	10097320	I was going to say also shout out to Koopa Club. I was supposed to guest on their show again this past week, but Jeremy got sick, so I guess we're rescheduling that.
10097320	10103320	They were on a little hiatus, and they're kind of doing a different format now. So yeah, shout out to them.
10104320	10118320	I also want to say to that comment is that I really agree. I think part of that is when you're doing a podcast for the BBC or even something like IGN or whatever, you have to remember that whatever you're saying kind of reflects on your company.
10118320	10127320	So I think even though you can have a No Whole Bards podcast or whatever, you still have that in the back of your mind that you're representing your company.
10127320	10134320	Whereas here on OLR, my day job has nothing to do with the gaming industry. If it did, I probably wouldn't be able to do this show for you guys.
10134320	10141320	But because my day job has nothing to do with this, I can speak freely. You know what I mean?
10141320	10151320	If I say something like, you know, such and such sucks, I don't represent my company when I say that. But it's why I don't do a podcast on corporate training or something. You know what I mean?
10151320	10153320	It's a big reason why I don't actually mention where I work.
10153320	10154320	Sure. I understand.
10154320	10158320	Other than that, I call it low cat and you guys have to deal with that.
10158320	10169320	Here's what makes OLR matter to me. Rob's adoration for games and his energy. Jamie's dry but warm random nature. Okay. Thank you. And Loki's glorious rants.
10169320	10176320	The games news itself, I have often already heard or read. It's what you guys have to say about the news that interests me.
10176320	10186320	Anyway, very quick plug, I started my podcast called Songwriter Select, where we give a songwriter's view on popular music and aim to inspire and inform musicians.
10186320	10197320	The early feedback we were getting seems to be validating my view that people want a slant, a personal edge to the topics at hand, just like you guys do for video games.
10197320	10202320	And musicians listening, do check us out. We actually have a few in our chat room right now.
10202320	10207320	I do not mind a cheap plug at all, especially when you're going to be so kind to say as we played a part in the inspiration of that.
10207320	10214320	I think that is truly the best compliment somebody can give this show, is that your show inspired me to start my own show.
10214320	10215320	Happy for the plug.
10215320	10216320	Yeah, happy to be here.
10216320	10222320	That all said, I am of course a big gamer. Thanks to Rob for replying to my tweet earlier this week about Rock Band 4.
10222320	10225320	Please do keep OLR updated with your views on the game.
10225320	10237320	I have been on the Rock Band wagon since Rock Band 1. I really really want the disc imports to be confirmed before I jump on Rock Band 4.
10237320	10240320	I think our writer here is from the UK.
10240320	10244320	Yes, it's the tweet I was thinking of earlier this week.
10244320	10246320	Two quick Rock Band questions.
10246320	10256320	One, how is the frame rate? In Rock Band 2 and 3, when playing as a band, it chugged a fair bit, which is annoying as a smooth note chart helps me concentrate.
10256320	10261320	I, going to be honest, haven't played the full band yet, but remember they removed some instruments in Rock Band 4.
10261320	10266320	So you won't have the same band that you had in Rock Band 3, because there's no keyboards now.
10266320	10269320	Maybe we should stream some stuff. I'll sing live.
10269320	10274320	Well, that's quite the offer. I don't have a freaking microphone, but maybe I can get one.
10274320	10275320	Do you?
10275320	10277320	I think I might have the ones that'll work.
10277320	10280320	Yeah, I'll have to see if it'll work, but if it does, yeah, heck yeah.
10280320	10282320	Actually, no, ours might be Xbox.
10282320	10284320	Anyway, but we'll figure that out.
10284320	10289320	But, yeah, as far as the frame rate goes, it's smooth for me.
10289320	10296320	I also have a high refresh rate TV, and we are on the next gen system, so I would hope that's not an issue, but I haven't noticed any problems there.
10296320	10304320	Two, I have read about vocals being scored differently in Rock Band 4, so long as you are in key and on a note from the chord, you aren't marked down.
10304320	10308320	If this works, this is music to my ears. Again, bad pun, sorry.
10308320	10320320	Often with bands like Queen, which I have all the DLC for, bless you forever, the harmonies and the melodies are at the same level in the audio mix, so it's hard to know which is which.
10320320	10326320	When singing, I would be scored low for singing the wrong vocal line, even though it was perfectly in key.
10326320	10328320	Any reports on this first hand?
10328320	10333320	I have not first hand, but I've heard second hand that what you're saying is correct.
10334320	10336320	That it would still be that way?
10336320	10342320	By the way, the only reason I don't have Queen songs in Rock Band is because I have Sing Star Queen, just saying.
10342320	10345320	Because then you get the music videos, too.
10345320	10350320	But, yeah, as far as I know, that is the case, is what I'm hearing, too.
10350320	10353320	I don't know if anybody in chat has insight on that as well.
10353320	10354320	Ready for the end?
10354320	10355320	Yeah.
10355320	10359320	Anyway, sorry for the longish email, I tried to be concise, you were fine.
10359320	10362320	And blessed wonderful grammar.
10362320	10367320	Much love and thanks for the podcast, which I download here each Monday.
10367320	10372320	I will listen live one day, but being in England, that is some crazy late night antics right there.
10372320	10374320	And it comes from James Nighthawk.
10374320	10377320	Well, we do a couple times a year try to do the show at noon.
10377320	10381320	And usually it's because we have some other type of commitment, like the last time was what?
10381320	10383320	We were going to San Francisco, that was when Victoria moved away, right?
10383320	10384320	It was.
10384320	10386320	And then we ate chicken hearts.
10386320	10388320	Right, we did a show at noon, so we get to San Francisco in time.
10388320	10397320	So sometimes, and we'll call that our UK show, because it would be timed to be only 8 o'clock at night over in the UK as opposed to, what time is it on in the UK now?
10397320	10399320	It's 8 hours later than us.
10399320	10401320	So it's 2am in the morning is when it starts.
10401320	10404320	So unfortunately it's just, you know, time zones kind of suck.
10404320	10406320	But that's why we love the podcast.
10406320	10408320	Time zones are shite.
10408320	10410320	They're total shite.
10410320	10412320	Thank you, thank you for the email.
10412320	10415320	And long emails are perfectly fine, especially from first time emailers.
10416320	10418320	So, thank you. That's it.
10418320	10420320	You get one pass.
10420320	10424320	Participate at Orangeloungeradio.com.
10424320	10427320	Akuma JP in chat says no UK show.
10427320	10430320	Akuma JP doesn't like the UK shows because he's in Japan.
10430320	10433320	So when we do the noon shows, that's like 2 in the morning for him.
10433320	10435320	But it's like lunchtime for him right now or something.
10435320	10436320	Yeah, it is.
10436320	10438320	So maybe we need to do the Jcast.
10438320	10439320	Yeah, maybe.
10439320	10442320	God, then we'd have to be up till 2 in the morning to do the Jcast.
10442320	10444320	We'll do it Saturday, Sunday morning.
10444320	10445320	You know what?
10445320	10447320	We do it playing global.
10447320	10449320	We're just going to do the 24 hour show.
10449320	10453320	We have to one up our marathon show and do a complete start to finish 24 hour show.
10453320	10455320	What do you say, Loki?
10455320	10458320	I'd be fine with it, but my wife wouldn't.
10458320	10460320	Nelly should be on the show too.
10460320	10461320	We'll do it at your house.
10461320	10462320	Yeah, they'll never have that.
10462320	10463320	Alright.
10463320	10466320	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
10466320	10469320	It is about that time to get a little bit angsty.
10472320	10492320	FU to just certain issues and night terrors.
10492320	10493320	Alright.
10493320	10498320	Loki, let's see how vague I can be about this.
10498320	10507320	FU to situations in my life that would cause a therapist to basically summarize, say, you're
10507320	10510320	fucked.
10510320	10512320	Okay.
10512320	10513320	My view of the week.
10513320	10514320	You know what?
10514320	10516320	I had a pretty damn good weekend.
10516320	10518320	It's hard for me to be upset about anything.
10518320	10520320	FU to the fact that, oh, I know.
10520320	10524320	FU to the fact that I was really going to try and do some live streams last week and
10524320	10527320	then I went out and did shit like every single night last week.
10527320	10528320	So this week I got to work.
10528320	10532320	And FU to the fact that I've let my living room become a total disaster and I need to
10532320	10533320	clean this week.
10533320	10534320	I'm going to do that too.
10534320	10535320	So FU to cleaning.
10535320	10536320	Flaco.
10536320	10541320	FU not playing enough Splatoon this week and their ranking system is so hard.
10541320	10542320	It's so mean.
10542320	10545320	But I love it still.
10545320	10546320	Alright.
10546320	10548320	And Shane Alinko.
10548320	10554320	FU to the, oh, to insomnia and how hot it is in here right now.
10554320	10556320	I turned on the AC.
10556320	10557320	What more do you want?
10557320	10560320	Turn on three ACs.
10560320	10564320	I will turn on all the ACs just for you.
10564320	10565320	Alright.
10565320	10567320	FU to Shane.
10567320	10568320	He's never happy.
10568320	10571320	Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys and then we're going to quickly open
10571320	10572320	up the Skyline.
10572320	10576320	We're already after nine o'clock so I am going to only have it open for a little bit.
10576320	10578320	So let's go over to Loki next.
10578320	10585320	So Valve is apparently removing some Steam games off of their service that are Linux
10585320	10589320	titles that don't support SteamOS.
10589320	10593320	And apparently these are being pulled because they're not meeting the standards or they're
10593320	10595320	incompatible with the system.
10595320	10600320	And so you would need to fix that if that's the case.
10600320	10604320	The games are no longer available for purchase but if you do own the game you can still download
10604320	10606320	and play it.
10606320	10609320	And I guess they were saying one of the games affected by it was Star Made and it was removed
10609320	10613320	due to a Java requirement.
10613320	10616320	So that kind of sucks.
10616320	10620320	So they're not just removing it because they're mad that the games, you know, don't work on
10620320	10621320	them.
10621320	10629320	Yeah, basically they don't want a game advertised as having SteamOS support if it has an outside
10629320	10637320	launcher, installer, flash, anything else that's required to run the game.
10637320	10638320	Alright.
10638320	10645320	Well lastly tonight, this could be interesting, a Wii U emulator has been released for Windows
10645320	10646320	10.
10646320	10649320	That's right, you can now emulate the Wii U on Windows 10.
10649320	10651320	Nintendo is not going to like that.
10651320	10653320	It's called Cemu?
10653320	10655320	I don't know if that's how you pronounce it.
10655320	10656320	Cemu?
10656320	10657320	I don't know.
10657320	10658320	Cemu?
10658320	10659320	Wii U?
10659320	10660320	Cemu?
10660320	10661320	Ceman?
10661320	10662320	I don't know.
10662320	10670320	It has Wii U titles at a resolution of 1920x1080, but it's still very much a work in progress.
10670320	10676320	There's no audio, some games crash, but some games like NES Remix actually run.
10676320	10680320	But then other games like Super Mario 3D World don't work so well.
10680320	10684320	And as you can understand, Nintendo's going to be a little bit pissed off about this because
10684320	10689320	the Wii U is kind of current hardware and if an emulator comes out it's just going to
10689320	10693320	you know, probably drive more piracy and so on, so that's not going to end up being a
10693320	10694320	healthy thing.
10694320	10700320	So, I could see that Nintendo's going to try real hard to shut this one down, but the question
10700320	10702320	will be, legally, can they?
10702320	10707320	I mean, at least when the NES and Super Nintendo emulators came out, it was kind of a while
10707320	10709320	after those consoles had sunsetted.
10709320	10712320	You know, even though there is the Virtual Console and so forth.
10712320	10715320	This one for a current system, I don't know.
10715320	10716320	We'll see.
10716320	10717320	Alright.
10717320	10723320	Anyhow, we are going to open up the Skype line 1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype,
10723320	10725320	Orange Lounge Radio.
10725320	10726320	But you know what?
10726320	10730320	I think it's about time we check in with our list list segment.
10730320	10732320	Let's quickly get to this list list tonight.
10734320	10738320	I'm going to be honest, a lot of ties across the board because there weren't a lot of votes tonight.
10738320	10740320	Where are our listeners?
10740320	10742320	I'm sad.
10742320	10745320	I was going to beg them all to vote in my movie poll article.
10745320	10747320	Alright, well, you still should.
10747320	10752320	While you're logged in, voting for this, go rank the movies in my latest Fall Movie Preview.
10752320	10753320	Thank you.
10753320	10755320	Alright, well, you know what?
10755320	10759320	It's the show where every gamer has a voice, but only when you use them.
10759320	10760320	So here it is.
10760320	10763320	Your top three as determined by the listeners.
10763320	10766320	The worst NES game they ever made.
10766320	10767320	We have two ties.
10767320	10770320	So for number three, we have a tie.
10770320	10773320	Back to the Future 2 and 3.
10773320	10777320	And Cheetahmen 2 for the worst NES game they ever made.
10777320	10778320	That's like a freeway tie.
10778320	10779320	I know, right?
10779320	10783320	And at number two, we also have a tie.
10783320	10788320	Tied for the number two worst game they ever did make.
10788320	10793320	Bart vs. the Space Mutants and Barbie.
10794320	10800320	But the number one, according to the chatters and our listeners, and this is it,
10800320	10805320	this is the worst NES game they ever made.
10805320	10807320	Bible Adventures.
10807320	10809320	Yes!
10809320	10812320	Bible Adventures is the worst.
10812320	10815320	I didn't even get a single damn answer on the list there.
10815320	10819320	With all those ties, I thought, oh, there's no way none of mine are getting up there.
10820320	10821320	I'm just surprised.
10821320	10823320	Anyone actually knew Cheetahmen enough to vote for it?
10823320	10824320	There you go.
10824320	10826320	Apparently somebody else suffered through it.
10826320	10828320	I think games done quick for exposure.
10828320	10829320	All right, so there it was.
10829320	10830320	The list.
10830320	10833320	Thank you guys that participated in that tonight.
10833320	10834320	Appreciate it.
10834320	10835320	All right.
10835320	10837320	I think actually, too, what happened is the votes were really spread out.
10837320	10840320	I think a lot of the people that did vote were all voting for different things.
10840320	10841320	So...
10841320	10843320	Don't downgrade my victory, Rob.
10843320	10844320	That kind of played...
10844320	10845320	No, I...
10845320	10847320	I think Bible...
10847320	10849320	Yeah, if they were still spread out, how come you didn't get any?
10849320	10850320	Ah, fuck off.
10850320	10851320	All right.
10851320	10854320	I honestly thought Barbie would be number one, but...
10854320	10855320	I thought so, too.
10855320	10857320	Bible Adventures in the top three doesn't spread out at all.
10857320	10858320	I thought X-Men would be up there, too.
10858320	10859320	Yeah, yeah.
10859320	10860320	All right, let's get to...
10860320	10862320	Will somebody eliminate a duck hunt?
10862320	10863320	That would have won it.
10863320	10864320	All right.
10864320	10865320	Nope.
10865320	10867320	1877 Game O-L-R, username on Skype.
10867320	10868320	Orange Lounge Radio.
10868320	10870320	Now I'm looking at it, and it's open.
10870320	10872320	Sorry, I want to make sure we got the list out there, though.
10872320	10873320	So, hey, we got a call coming in.
10873320	10874320	Let's get to it.
10874320	10875320	Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio.
10875320	10876320	Who's this?
10876320	10877320	Hey, this is Akdeft.
10877320	10878320	Yeah, hey, Akdeft.
10878320	10879320	How you doing?
10879320	10882320	Pretty fine, pretty fine, actually.
10882320	10883320	What's on your mind?
10883320	10884320	Really great.
10884320	10885320	I'm sorry?
10885320	10886320	All right.
10886320	10887320	Go ahead.
10887320	10888320	Oh.
10888320	10894320	Like I say, I was saying, I'm really feeling like...
10894320	10895320	Sorry.
10895320	10898320	Really great right now.
10898320	10899320	Do you...
10899320	10900320	Sorry.
10900320	10905320	You do remember the Dance Fighting Hertz in the Go campaign, right?
10906320	10907320	Yes.
10907320	10908320	Did it make it?
10908320	10909320	Yeah, actually.
10909320	10913320	Even last week, it was really, really far from its goal.
10913320	10926320	It had at least like over 100,000 still to get funded, and this week was really amazing
10926320	10933320	because every day it was going up like 20,000 a day or 25,000.
10933320	10946320	So, earlier today, they got to their goal of 436,000 thousand dollars.
10946320	10955320	So, right now, they're at 450,000 or 51,000 actually.
10955320	10956320	So, wait.
10956320	10957320	They're 9,000 short?
10957320	10958320	No, no, no.
10958320	10959320	They actually...
10959320	10960320	Sorry.
10961320	10962320	Sorry.
10962320	10964320	I'm getting really started.
10964320	10965320	Sorry.
10965320	10966320	Sorry.
10966320	10967320	Yeah.
10967320	10968320	Okay.
10968320	10975320	They're right now at 450,000 K. Yeah.
10975320	10981320	So, they actually got or they surpassed their goal.
10981320	10984320	That was 436,000.
10984320	10985320	Oh, 436.
10985320	10986320	I thought for some reason...
10986320	10987320	I guess I just misheard the number.
10987320	10988320	Okay.
10988320	10989320	So, they did make it after all.
10989320	10993320	That's the thing with the crowdfunding campaigns that usually the most money is made at the
10993320	10995320	very beginning and the very end.
10995320	11001320	Very little of it is made in the middle unless you have some huge presence, a huge interview
11001320	11005320	or some exposure breaks through or something really kind of pushes that campaign a little
11005320	11007320	bit in the middle.
11007320	11009320	So, yeah.
11009320	11011320	I'm glad though that everybody rallied at the end.
11011320	11014320	I think a lot of times too what happens towards the end is that everybody's like,
11014320	11017320	oh shit, this is my last chance to help the game out.
11017320	11019320	Procrastinators, right?
11019320	11020320	Yeah, basically.
11020320	11021320	They think so.
11021320	11024320	Most people want it right now, but at the same time, I can procrastinate.
11024320	11026320	I'll wait till the last possible minute and then I'll do it.
11026320	11027320	Right?
11027320	11029320	And there's still three days to go.
11029320	11033320	So, hopefully they get some of their stretch goals.
11033320	11034320	Yeah.
11034320	11042320	They're pretty much like 25,000 for Mac and Linux versions.
11042320	11052320	Though, if they get 546,000, they'll make another character, a new character for the
11052320	11053320	game.
11053320	11055320	So, hopefully they'll make it though.
11055320	11057320	It seems like kind of far fetched right now.
11057320	11058320	Yeah.
11058320	11060320	With a few days to go, you're going to have a lot of people to jump in there right at
11060320	11064320	the end to make sure they get their copy of the game and help things move along and get
11064320	11065320	to the stretch goals.
11065320	11071320	So, I feel like there's a good chance at depth, but happy to hear they made their goal.
11071320	11074320	So, them fighting herds coming out soon, right?
11074320	11075320	Yeah.
11075320	11079320	Coming out for Steam and hopefully in 2017, I think.
11079320	11080320	Yeah.
11080320	11081320	But, yeah.
11081320	11091320	Hopefully, again, this game will not only be popular among My Little Pony fans, but
11091320	11095320	hopefully for all fighting games fans in general.
11095320	11099320	Well, it sounds like, too, if you like Skullgirls, there'll probably be a lot here for you because
11099320	11100320	it's the same engine, right?
11100320	11101320	Yeah.
11101320	11102320	Yeah.
11102320	11103320	So, there'll be other stuff there for fighting game fans.
11103320	11108320	Now, we just have to have it show up at EVO.
11108320	11114320	Actually, the original game, Fighting is Magic, was going to make it at EVO, I think, last
11114320	11115320	year.
11115320	11116320	Really?
11116320	11117320	Yeah.
11117320	11121320	Remember they had that poll, that fun donation poll?
11121320	11122320	Oh, that's right.
11122320	11124320	Yes, I do remember that.
11124320	11128320	Yeah, that's when Melee got into EVO last year.
11128320	11135320	Actually, Fighting is Magic had the first place, but Mane6 said they couldn't have a
11135320	11142320	final build of the game made for EVO, so they dropped out of the donation drive.
11142320	11143320	Got it.
11143320	11144320	Got it.
11144320	11145320	All right.
11145320	11146320	Makes sense.
11146320	11149320	Well, Act F, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?
11149320	11150320	Not really.
11150320	11152320	That's all for tonight, I think.
11152320	11153320	Nope.
11153320	11154320	I appreciate it.
11154320	11155320	All right.
11155320	11156320	You take care, buddy.
11156320	11157320	Hey, take care, too.
11157320	11159320	Thanks for having me.
11159320	11160320	Bye.
11160320	11164320	I would have asked Act F about Ines's memory, but you know he's going to say something about
11164320	11165320	Kirby.
11165320	11166320	I can just answer that for him.
11166320	11169320	He actually did answer the question over on our Fugu Question of the Week as well.
11169320	11170320	All right.
11170320	11175320	Do you have any last minute stories, Loki?
11175320	11177320	Wait to see if any other calls come in.
11177320	11179320	1877 game OLR, username on Skype, Orange on Trio.
11179320	11182320	Did you guys talk about Allison Road canceling their Kickstarter and going-
11182320	11183320	You know what?
11183320	11184320	No, I don't think that came up.
11184320	11186320	Did you want to- I did remember reading about this, though.
11186320	11189320	I don't have it in front of me, but I know they got picked up by the people who make
11189320	11190320	the Worms game, I think?
11190320	11191320	Yeah, Team 17.
11191320	11192320	Yeah, Team 17.
11192320	11193320	So they got picked up by them.
11193320	11195320	It didn't look like they were going to make their Kickstarter.
11195320	11196320	No.
11196320	11198320	It looked like they were pretty far off from it.
11198320	11202320	I don't know how much time they had left, but it is hard to tell because it's in British
11202320	11203320	Pounds, I think.
11203320	11204320	Yeah, yeah.
11204320	11208320	I don't know if that was part of the problem, but yeah, they weren't going to make their
11208320	11211320	Kickstarter, but now they're getting in front of the more traditional route because they
11211320	11214320	have a studio behind it, which they said is good for them.
11214320	11215320	Well, trying to-
11215320	11219320	You got to spin it in a nice way when you fail your Kickstarter, right?
11219320	11224320	But, to be fair, with all due respect to the makers of Allison Road, I think what had a
11224320	11230320	lot of people excited about PT was the involvement of Guillermo del Toro and Hideo Kojima, so
11230320	11232320	it's kind of like you're trying to-
11232320	11233320	Piggyback on that?
11233320	11237320	You're kind of trying to piggyback on a game that everybody's pissed off is not happening,
11237320	11240320	so I think that was always going to be an uphill battle of sorts.
11240320	11244320	Well, hopefully with Team17's backing, I mean, hopefully they see the talent in that
11244320	11247320	little demo, because I think a lot of people did see that Allison Road demo and went, wow,
11247320	11249320	this is pretty cool.
11249320	11254320	So, hopefully Team17 can give them the more traditional backing they need to make the
11254320	11257320	game they envision, and then they can make a killing on the sales.
11257320	11259320	See what I did there?
11259320	11261320	A killing on the sales.
11261320	11262320	All right.
11262320	11264320	But we have no idea when the game's coming out, right?
11264320	11265320	Not even October 2016.
11265320	11267320	I would imagine it'd be so far away.
11267320	11272320	I think starters alone take two years, and maybe go in the traditional route, would that
11272320	11274320	make it faster or longer?
11274320	11275320	I don't know.
11275320	11276320	Probably the same.
11276320	11280320	The only new stuff that I saw this week that I watched a video on was that trans-pacific
11280320	11287320	partnership thing, that secret thing that they're drafting up of a guest that's basically
11287320	11294320	going to fuck over everybody as far as consumer rights and copyright and fair use and all that.
11294320	11296320	I do remember reading about this vaguely.
11296320	11299320	Let me come back to this real quick, because we do have another call coming in, but I want
11299320	11300320	to revisit that topic in just a minute.
11300320	11301320	But let me get to the phone.
11301320	11302320	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11302320	11303320	Who's this?
11303320	11304320	Hey, everybody.
11304320	11305320	It's Rama.
11305320	11306320	Hey, Rama.
11306320	11307320	Thanks for the interview.
11307320	11308320	Hey, no problem.
11308320	11309320	Anything for you guys.
11309320	11310320	Aw, I was actually sorry.
11310320	11313320	I texted you, and I'm like, you're not keeping this for yourself?
11313320	11319320	Well, you know, I try to, you know, whenever I get the opportunity to interview voice actors
11319320	11321320	who have done a lot of gaming stuff.
11321320	11322320	Yeah.
11322320	11328320	I'll do an audio copy of the interview and hook you guys up, because it's going to be
11328320	11331320	a while before we put the video interview up on our YouTube page.
11331320	11332320	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
11332320	11333320	No, I appreciate it.
11333320	11334320	I definitely appreciate it.
11334320	11335320	Yeah.
11335320	11336320	So what's on your mind?
11336320	11340320	I was actually thinking about the hardest Nintendo game I've ever played by Refleak.
11340320	11344320	Can't think of any, because most of the time it was a couple of Super Nintendo games.
11344320	11347320	I just found myself throwing the controllers left and right.
11347320	11351320	But my thing is about the whole Nintendo NX.
11351320	11357320	The way they're talking reminds me of the TurboGrafx-16 and the Turbo Express Portable.
11357320	11358320	Interesting.
11358320	11364320	Where the Portable played the exact same games from the exact same cards as the 16, huh?
11364320	11365320	Yeah.
11365320	11366320	That's a good point.
11366320	11368320	I hope the screen's bigger.
11368320	11369320	It should be.
11369320	11370320	It should be.
11370320	11371320	Oh, no, no, no.
11371320	11378320	There's nothing quite as hard on your eyes as playing the Portable, the Turbo Express.
11378320	11381320	I think there's still so many unknown factors, though.
11381320	11383320	Let's say it is a portable system and a console.
11383320	11386320	Does that mean that the games they make are going to be different?
11386320	11390320	Because when you play at home, would it be a dual-screen experience?
11390320	11393320	Whereas when you're on the go, it's a one-screen experience?
11393320	11396320	There's so many questions about it that I still have.
11396320	11399320	But again, this is all coming from the rumor mill anyway.
11399320	11402320	So this could all be for nothing, you know?
11402320	11406320	Yeah, because for a while they were saying it was going to be an Android-powered console.
11406320	11408320	I'm like, pfft, that ain't gonna happen.
11408320	11409320	No.
11409320	11413320	I mean, I could see where maybe Nintendo would make it easier for that, but I don't know.
11413320	11414320	Android-powered console?
11414320	11415320	PAX console?
11415320	11416320	Yep.
11416320	11417320	Yeah.
11417320	11423320	And I know when the NX comes out, everybody's going to want the backwards compatibility,
11423320	11428320	and they're saying that it's going to be much more powerful than the Xbox One and the PS4.
11428320	11429320	I'll just say this.
11429320	11431320	If you notice, PS1...
11431320	11433320	I mean, what am I saying?
11433320	11434320	I'm sorry.
11434320	11435320	I'm tired.
11435320	11441320	The X64, Xbox One, they went X64 straight up PC processing.
11441320	11447320	The way they built these consoles out, these consoles literally have a 10-year lifespan.
11447320	11456320	So if the NX comes out, it's going to be a PC-based console where the parts can be pulled off the shelves.
11456320	11463320	And I can see it being, if not powerful, just as powerful as the current next-gen consoles,
11463320	11467320	because to be perfectly honest, when it comes to price point, you could actually go to New
11467320	11472320	Egg or Micro Center and build a PC with the same specs as the One or the PS4.
11472320	11473320	No, you can't.
11473320	11474320	And it will run you about...
11474320	11482320	You remember that the PS4 has all that GDDR4, was it, the graphics card memory in it.
11482320	11485320	It runs a lot faster than your standard RAM.
11485320	11487320	I mean, that's not something you can just pull off the shelf.
11487320	11494320	Plus, I mean, the price points of those consoles are pretty high as it is, and Nintendo's going to want to keep a low price point.
11494320	11499320	And if you're throwing in like a second screen device as well, it's just going to be pricey.
11499320	11502320	That's why I think they may try to sell them separately.
11502320	11512320	There may be like an NX brand for both, but that the handheld would be one $200 purchase, and then the console's another $200 purchase.
11512320	11519320	So really, it's like $400 or even maybe $500 for the combo, but they're going to disguise it as two cheaper purchases.
11519320	11523320	That could be a thing. I'm not saying it will be, but that could be how they do it.
11523320	11527320	I can see that, because to be perfectly honest, one of the things that turned me off from getting a Wii U is the GamePad.
11527320	11531320	I'm like, I don't mind the console, but I don't know if I want the GamePad.
11531320	11536320	I mean, if I could play all the games without the GamePad, then why do I need it?
11536320	11541320	Yeah, but some games it's like, you know, Splatoon is built with the GamePad.
11541320	11550320	Whether we think it's that useful or not, you know, they would have to go back and make massive changes to the game to make it completely without the GamePad, and I just don't see that happening.
11550320	11553320	Yeah, you're probably right about that.
11553320	11556320	Except they do have a mode that runs off the GameChat, so you know.
11556320	11559320	You could stick to a tablet or something for a secondary screen, you know?
11559320	11564320	Yeah. Alright. Well, Rama, any other thoughts on your mind before we let you go?
11564320	11574320	It's October. It's 40 degrees out. I am sitting here with my space heater under the desk. What the hell?
11574320	11580320	It's hot in the studio. We have the light off in the studio and just the kitchen light on behind us. It's like really hot. I don't know if it's because there's five of us.
11580320	11582320	It's 63 degrees. We could crack a window.
11582320	11588320	I do have a window cracker. I mean, it's all the way over there, but here's the other thing. I didn't want to keep that window open because the sound traveled the neighbors.
11588320	11589320	Because the evil dead outside?
11589320	11591320	Yes, the evil dead and the neighbors.
11591320	11592320	And the spiders.
11592320	11596320	Alright. Anyway, I'm going to let you go, Rama. Thanks for calling.
11596320	11597320	Hey, no problem, dude.
11597320	11598320	Alright, take care.
11598320	11599320	Alright, bye.
11599320	11603320	Bye. Alright, there it is. That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
11603320	11607320	I wanted to quickly go back to what Loki was saying, though, before we wrap it up here tonight.
11607320	11610320	Loki, you were talking about the whole partnership on the streaming?
11610320	11615320	Yeah, basically it's a secret deal that's going on that only got leaked out by WikiLeaks.
11615320	11621320	And that's the only way we found out about it. It's basically going to make, first off, those types of leaks legal.
11621320	11628320	It's also going to make, if you infringe on copyright, and this could be anything from modding a game,
11628320	11634320	you could be held criminally for that, including jail time and unlimited penalties as far as monetary.
11634320	11635320	That's too much.
11635320	11643320	They would increase the copyright to basically match what the US has, which is the life of the creator plus 70 years.
11643320	11649320	It's just basically going to fuck everybody over. It's pretty much going to kill the modding scene.
11649320	11657320	You can't circumvent DRM in any fashion that's illegal, even if you do it just on a personal level.
11657320	11658320	That won't happen.
11658320	11668320	It will happen because, think about it, this is being drafted by 151 companies, or 150-some companies, to serve themselves.
11668320	11673320	And this is being done in secret, without the public knowledge, except it got leaked out.
11673320	11676320	Remember SOPA? That's the exact same thing that happened with that whole thing.
11676320	11680320	Once people got educated on it, they put their foot down.
11680320	11687320	We'll see, but they're already on their final draft, apparently, of this, and so it just has to be ratified by these countries.
11687320	11688320	Alright.
11690320	11694320	Okay, I guess that's going to wrap it up here for another episode of Orange Andrea.
11694320	11699320	We're almost like 9-20, so we're a little long tonight, and especially the podcast listeners are going to be like,
11699320	11703320	wow, this is a super long show, because the interview and our usual break is actually a part of it.
11703320	11705320	So, I do want to go ahead and wrap things up.
11705320	11709320	Thank you guys for sticking with us for an extra long edition of Orange Lounge Radio.
11709320	11714320	Hey, if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two, or 17, about the show.
11714320	11717320	Help us spread the word, because, you know, as we've joked about earlier in the show,
11717320	11722320	we don't have the backing of the BBC or IGN or one of those big companies,
11722320	11726320	so we could definitely use word-of-mouth support and tell a friend.
11726320	11730320	And that's, yeah, that's the best thing you could do for our show.
11730320	11732320	Really would appreciate it and help out.
11732320	11735320	Well, five-star review on iTunes or Stitcher Radio or wherever you found this show.
11735320	11737320	That goes a long, long way as well.
11737320	11740320	You know, if we were sponsored by CNN, they'd just tell us to lie to everyone.
11742320	11746320	All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.
11746320	11748320	First off, I want to thank our guests for being here.
11748320	11750320	Flaco Jones, thank you for being here tonight.
11750320	11751320	You're welcome.
11751320	11752320	Always good to have you here.
11752320	11753320	I love being here.
11753320	11754320	Good job on List List.
11754320	11755320	We love having you.
11755320	11756320	I've never won before.
11756320	11757320	It makes me so happy.
11757320	11758320	Yay.
11758320	11759320	I won List List.
11759320	11760320	And you'll never win again.
11760320	11761320	No, never again.
11761320	11762320	I plan to.
11762320	11764320	Enjoy all the Bomb Corp you're going to play this week, I'm sure.
11764320	11765320	Yeah.
11765320	11767320	I just love that game.
11767320	11768320	And Yoshi.
11768320	11769320	And Splatoon.
11769320	11770320	There's not enough time in the game.
11770320	11771320	There's a lot of good stuff out right now.
11771320	11772320	I know.
11772320	11773320	It's a fun time to be a gamer.
11773320	11774320	So many good games this year.
11774320	11775320	So much better than last year.
11775320	11776320	Well, thank you for being here.
11776320	11777320	Do you have anything you want to plug?
11777320	11778320	Uh, yeah.
11778320	11781320	How about Flaco's fall movie preview?
11781320	11784320	If you're still logged in from voting on List List, go on there and rank the movies.
11784320	11785320	There you go.
11785320	11786320	Like six people have so far.
11786320	11790320	If you're listening to the podcast, just log in, make an account, rank the movies.
11790320	11791320	It's fun.
11791320	11792320	It's points.
11792320	11793320	It's points.
11793320	11794320	There's no prizes this month so far.
11794320	11795320	I don't think there's going to be a prize this month.
11795320	11796320	No prize this month.
11796320	11797320	But who cares?
11797320	11798320	The prize is winning.
11798320	11799320	But we're going to try and bring one back next month.
11799320	11800320	We're going to do any points now.
11800320	11801320	We're going to do prizes more often.
11801320	11802320	Prizes are fun, aren't they?
11802320	11803320	Prizes are fun.
11803320	11805320	I wouldn't know because I can't win any.
11805320	11807320	You know, that happens.
11807320	11808320	It happens.
11808320	11809320	It's okay.
11809320	11810320	I used to dominate.
11810320	11811320	I dominated for like the first year of vlog.
11811320	11812320	You get perks in other ways.
11812320	11815320	Your eternal prize is you get to guess on a level or whatever you want.
11815320	11816320	Yay.
11816320	11817320	Oh, that's so fun.
11817320	11818320	All right.
11818320	11820320	Let's get to Shane Alenko.
11820320	11822320	Thanks for being here.
11822320	11823320	Welcome.
11823320	11825320	And glad you got to bring up Power Rangers at least once.
11825320	11826320	Not enough.
11826320	11827320	All right.
11827320	11828320	To be honest.
11828320	11829320	All right.
11829320	11830320	Well, do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?
11830320	11832320	Should be something Power Rangers related.
11832320	11833320	Wednesdays.
11833320	11834320	Am I right?
11834320	11835320	Oh, man.
11835320	11836320	I miss Kyle.
11836320	11837320	Kyle is so good.
11837320	11838320	There it is.
11838320	11839320	Play bomb course.
11839320	11842320	Shane, I have a story for you.
11842320	11843320	Okay.
11843320	11847320	Last Monday, I was sitting in and out near my house.
11847320	11852320	And I heard the Power Rangers sound go off and had to look at my phone and make sure
11852320	11854320	it wasn't you texting me.
11854320	11858320	And then I heard it again and I'm looking around going, who the fuck has that?
11858320	11862320	There's a person at work that I used to sit in the air that had that as their text to
11862320	11864320	him as well as like, that's so cool.
11864320	11866320	Is it the one that actually goes beep, beep, beep, beep, beep?
11866320	11867320	Yeah.
11867320	11869320	Not like mine, which is like a five hour song.
11869320	11872320	That's what Shane's text sound is on my phone.
11872320	11873320	How appropriate.
11873320	11874320	I thought so.
11874320	11876320	You know what Shane's text message alert is?
11876320	11877320	It's the whole dollar on you, Shane.
11877320	11881320	You know what Shane's text message alert is on my phone?
11881320	11882320	Same one everybody has.
11882320	11884320	You know what yours is on my phone?
11884320	11885320	What?
11885320	11886320	Spice Girls or something, right?
11886320	11887320	No.
11887320	11888320	It was Enkindle this.
11888320	11889320	Oh, that's right.
11889320	11890320	It's Blasto.
11890320	11891320	That's right.
11891320	11892320	I thought you had an Ab Fab one for me at one point.
11892320	11893320	Sweetie darling.
11893320	11894320	Lacroix.
11894320	11895320	Sweetie Lacroix.
11895320	11896320	All right.
11896320	11898320	Final thought for us, StarkSaga.
11898320	11901320	I should probably give you a different text sound.
11901320	11902320	Okay.
11902320	11905320	My final thought for the night is I should probably give anybody a different text sound.
11905320	11908320	And thank you again, Sinister Creature Con.
11908320	11909320	Yay.
11909320	11912320	And I look forward to GamerX and whatever other cons.
11912320	11915320	I'm going to go to MagFest and whatever other cons are coming up that I'm going to end up
11915320	11916320	going to.
11916320	11917320	GamerX.
11917320	11918320	Last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight.
11918320	11921320	My final thought is I'm working on a Halloween costume.
11921320	11923320	Going to be a Lego minifig.
11923320	11926320	So I haven't decided yet on which minifig I'm going to do.
11926320	11930320	I'm kind of tossed up between either Loki, which would be a lot harder because I have
11930320	11934320	to do a paper craft helmet and scepter, or Deadpool.
11934320	11935320	All right.
11935320	11936320	So one of those.
11936320	11937320	Deadpool.
11937320	11938320	Hit Loki.
11938320	11939320	I want to do Loki, though.
11939320	11941320	Hit Loki up on Twitter and let him know.
11941320	11943320	Have fun playing Ingress, by the way.
11943320	11944320	All right.
11944320	11945320	All right.
11945320	11946320	All right.
11946320	11947320	That's going to do it.
11947320	11949320	We will be back in seven days.
11949320	11954320	And I believe in seven days, I have to make sure and confirm all that this week, but I
11954320	11958320	believe we're actually going to have here in studio live with us somebody new here in
11958320	11959320	SAC who also does a podcast.
11959320	11961320	We're going to talk to him next week.
11961320	11963320	So look forward to that.
11963320	11965320	We'll be back in seven days to do it all again.
11965320	11966320	Have a great week, everybody.
