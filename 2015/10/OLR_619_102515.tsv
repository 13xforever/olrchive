0	7000	Orange Lounge Radio
7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	20000	This week we go back to the future with a nod to Mattel's still unreleased hoverboard, the most stylish time machine, and even a classic video game.
20000	27000	All this and the actual news of late October 2015 along with your calls, comments, and more starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Great Scott
33000	39000	Indeed, see that's my cue to throw the toilet paper for the movie's ice watch. Alright, anyway.
39000	43000	Hi everybody, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
43000	52000	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 619 of our show, October the 25th of 2015.
52000	63000	My name is Rob Roberts, you can follow me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, and joining me here in studio to talk about the latest and greatest in video games, video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle.
63000	66000	Say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
66000	67000	Hi.
67000	68000	How are you?
68000	71000	I'm alive.
71000	79000	How does it feel to be in the future? Because you know that's what Jason was referencing in the intro, we have some news around that this week, and lots of people talking about that this week.
79000	88000	Because that day, in case you hadn't heard, because it wasn't just like everywhere, that day that Marty McFly travels to the future actually happened this week.
88000	96000	As opposed to all the Tumblr memes that have said that for the past four years, that every day is the day that Marty McFly arrives, that day actually happened this past week.
96000	98000	It feels like a struggle.
98000	100000	Every day is a struggle.
100000	103000	Because of all the people who want to hold us back.
103000	105000	You need your-
105000	107000	Embrace the future.
107000	117000	That's right, and will deny me my hoverboard, and my flying car, and so forth. Why is that that in every perception of the future, there's flying cars?
117000	119000	Because traffic sucks.
119000	120000	Traffic does.
120000	121000	But imagine this.
121000	122000	Traffic is worse.
122000	134000	If you had flying cars that have to figure out a way to put lanes up there, just if you want your example of what shit would be with flying cars, look at the fifth element.
135000	139000	Or like Star Wars. I think they sometimes show like on Course Con, they have like-
139000	140000	Yeah.
140000	141000	Yeah.
141000	142000	No.
142000	146000	But I know what you mean, the fifth element, because he was the taxi driver, and so they had a lot of traffic shots and that, so.
146000	151000	Yeah. Or that episode of Doctor Who with all of the cars in the tunnel.
151000	152000	Mm-hmm.
152000	154000	And the cat people and the kittens.
154000	155000	Yeah, that.
155000	158000	Also welcome, everybody, to the future. Tech master, Loki!
158000	159000	Hello.
159000	160000	Hey, Loki, how are you doing?
160000	162000	Good, multi-sasking.
162000	166000	Good. Yes, I see. You were actually playing Minecraft during the show.
166000	167000	Yeah.
167000	172000	Are you trying to build something during the show? Is there something extremely important going on in Minecraft?
172000	179000	No, this is basically what is the equivalent of gaming masturbation, just because there is no point to this game in survival mode, so.
179000	183000	Yeah, but some would argue that there is a point to masturbation, Loki.
183000	192000	True, but there's really no point to this, you know, game in survival mode. I mean, so I'm just basically down in my mind, hacking at the wall.
192000	195000	So that would be more like a video game nap. It's just a video game nap.
195000	197000	Maybe, yeah, nap. That works.
197000	204000	It might feel good, and then you're gonna regret that you just wasted the whole day doing it. I think that would be a little more appropriate.
204000	209000	All right, say hello as well to our chat room, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.
209000	213000	vog.network.com, and if you're listening live, you should participate with us and chat.
213000	223000	live.vog.network.com, and where Tigerclaw is reminding us in our chat room, we still have four years till we get to the year of Blade Runner, which is 2019.
223000	224000	So we have-
224000	227000	Guess what? The cars won't still be flying.
227000	229000	We are two years from the running man.
229000	236000	They might not be flying, but they might be driving themselves. I feel like we're getting closer and closer to that whole thing.
237000	242000	Google's doing one, supposedly Apple's doing one. I don't know, rumors.
242000	251000	Of course, there's the whole Tesla thing this week where now it's not just cruise control, but now it's cruise drivable and things like that.
251000	257000	I feel like in four years, it just might be the whole kit and caboodle where the cars are just driving themselves.
257000	261000	I can't be the only one that's disappointed that there's not Tesla coil in every Tesla car.
262000	275000	I'm just saying, I was promised giant Tesla coils for Command and Conquer Red Alert, and I expect giant Tesla coils being able to destroy my enemies with.
275000	280000	You demand it. Brad from Pod Culture says, get back to me when kit is a reality.
280000	287000	Yes, what year was that? But that was present day, right? Knight Rider? Wasn't that present day? Wasn't it in the future?
287000	288000	That was the 80s.
288000	290000	It was like a James Bond-esque kind of thing.
290000	291000	That was the 80s.
291000	293000	Yes, that was the 80s.
293000	306000	But why couldn't we have combined Knight Rider and Magnum P.I. and have kit have been in a Ferrari Testarossa and the Hoth have a huge porn stash?
306000	313000	Maybe there should have been a crossover. We're going to talk about an interesting video game crossover a little later on, just to shift it back to games a little bit, though.
313000	323000	But I did want to say, with this whole fact that Knight Rider was the 80s, and everybody's celebrating Back to the Future this week, and the fact that we are living in the future.
323000	330000	I think anybody that saw the Jem and the Holograms movie this week would rather be living in the past. Just saying.
330000	332000	One of my friends actually liked it.
332000	333000	Really?
333000	334000	And I was like, no.
334000	342000	Here's the thing. I think the Metacritic is what, not that I let Metacritic run my life, but I'm curious. So I think it was like a 29% on Metacritic.
342000	352000	And it's like, okay, well, I've seen worse. There's worse movies. I feel like Mall Cop 2 probably had a lower Metacritic rating than Jem.
352000	357000	And maybe that should be the tagline. Jem and the Holograms. Hey, Adam Sandler's not in it.
357000	369000	But it's still just, it's a complete violation of my childhood.
369000	383000	Believe me. Believe me. I loved the Jem 80s cartoon. And I feel like I heard, read this somewhere, that they took somebody else's script and was like, oh, we have this Jem license we're going to use, or we're going to lose if we don't use it.
383000	391000	So we're just going to insert Jem into this existing script that has nothing to do with Jem. And I think that's, yeah, what they got didn't really work.
391000	397000	I was hoping, when I heard they were making a movie out of Jem, I was hoping it was going to be more like the Josie and the Pussycats movie.
397000	405000	Which, if you haven't seen it, is like, it's one of those like, it's so bad, cheesy, over the top, it's kind of great.
405000	408000	I think that Josie and the Pussycats knows what it is.
408000	415000	Yeah, come on, Josie and the Pussycats opens with a boy band singing their number one hit, Back Door Lover. That's funny.
415000	418000	And it's one of those things that kids don't get.
418000	422000	That's like 21 Jump Street stuff, you know, where that movie knows what it is.
422000	423000	Exactly.
423000	428000	It's a parody of, you know, it's its own movie, but it's also a parody of the genre.
428000	437000	Parker Posey was in it. I mean, that's instant, like, that's an instant plus 15 on the Metacritic at least. Parker Posey's in it, therefore it lifts it up a little bit. Come on.
437000	444000	Alan Alchemy in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says, Space Channel 5 is in Josie and the Pussycats.
444000	456000	That's right, because there was, the whole like, brand insertion and commercialization was a big thing, and I seem to remember like, Sega and Dreamcast are some of those brands that show up, because that was, you know, about the time.
456000	464000	Kaijuto in chat says, I was a huge Gem fan and I don't care. The minute I found out it was live action, I was always already out and didn't care.
464000	474000	Yeah, and I think most people are just like, I do not consider this canon. It's just I'm turning my back on it. It's not what they say it is. And there's that.
474000	486000	Anyway, how did we get on movies and TVs? We're supposed to be a video game show, but hey, you know what? I know a lot of you guys, when you're playing video games, you're probably watching movies on your second monitor. At least I'm told that's what a lot of people do.
486000	499000	I can't do that. Do you guys, let me ask that a little bit here for part of our kickoff topic, because I feel like the kickoff topic I have is ground we've tread before, but let me ask this real quick is, do you guys multitask when you play games?
499000	502000	Let me start with Loki, because I think the answer is going to be pretty obvious here.
502000	515000	No, normally I don't. And that's the funny thing is, well, at least I don't intend to. But usually the wife is watching something stupid on TV, and so it's kind of hard to ignore it.
515000	518000	So you multitask not by choice?
518000	532000	Not by choice, yes. It's forced upon my eyes as I'm playing a game, usually like Mario Maker or something like that on a second screen. Unless, of course, I have the TV, in which case, no, there are no distractions.
532000	534000	And how was Grey's Anatomy this week?
534000	544000	We're already done with Grey's Anatomy, in fact, which she's done with her other stupid ABC family movie or show about some kid that was accused of murder of his aunt or some stupid thing like that.
544000	548000	And now we're on to classic episodes from Roseanne, which isn't so bad.
548000	550000	That's not so bad. I would watch that one.
550000	552000	Roseanne, it's a good show.
552000	554000	Yeah, there you go. At least you and the wife can compromise once in a while.
554000	560000	I should be concerned that she aspires to be Roseanne, so that...
560000	568000	But Jamie's the one that goes around going, Dan! Coffee!
568000	575000	No, it's usually Dan playing in the front room and me playing on my computer. We don't do movies. God, that's like not normal.
575000	583000	I was just gonna tell Loki real quick, though, I would be worried for when Fuller House comes out, because that's gonna be the one that I know your wife is gonna be there day one.
583000	590000	I would watch that. I like Fuller House. I mean, it was okay. I just think it's gonna be, no, here's the one I'm fucking worried about, okay?
590000	602000	It's the fact that they're announcing, hey, guess what? We're gonna do another Gilmore Girls series. I'm like, fuck no. Fuck no. I am not fucking listening to that shit.
602000	610000	I don't understand how they talk like that. It's just they talk so quick. God, it's like how I hear the conversations.
610000	616000	The way they talk in that show is not the way people really talk, and it bothers me a lot.
616000	619000	Kinda like robots set to 1.5 speed or something like that.
619000	627000	SSJ100Matt says, does listening to great podcasts from the VoG network, cheap plug, while playing games count as multitasking?
627000	638000	Sort of, and that I can do, actually, especially during MMOs. I actually get a lot of my podcasts listening in while I'm grinding in an MMO, and I count Diablo as an MMO.
638000	646000	Because in an MMO, even though the music can be amazing, like Final Fantasy XIV, one of the greatest soundtracks in all of games, let alone an MMO,
646000	653000	once you've heard the song literally 5,000 times, you're kinda ready to turn it down and listen to something else.
653000	666000	So yes, and I think that's a great plug for podcasts in general, is that they make a great kind of background music when you're doing gaming or what have you that doesn't take your visual attention away.
667000	672000	Jamie, I know you started to kind of answer this question a little bit because you said Dan would be in the front room, you'd be in the back.
672000	678000	Do you ever multitask while you're playing a game? Do you do the game on one monitor or something else on the second monitor?
678000	681000	I'll chat with Becky sometimes.
681000	682000	Chat.
682000	690000	So I'll keep my chat stuff open, or I'll probably have an FAQ if it's a hard puzzle or something.
690000	694000	But I pretty much give the game my attention and just chat on the side.
694000	702000	What's interesting about the chat, I think I would say that's about as far as I go with it too, is that I'll either have Google Hangouts, which is what I use these days,
702000	707000	I have Google Hangouts open on another window and I'll do the chat thing, kind of like that.
707000	714000	But I find that with a lot of games, especially if it's an MMO and I happen to have people on, I can chat within the game.
715000	723000	Or like Battle.net has several games that are all tied together that are all pretty popular that you can kind of chat in between the games.
723000	729000	I was catching up with a few people from WoW last night. I just loaded up Battle.net just for the sake of it.
729000	737000	Actually now that I have the full build of Hearthstone, not Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, so I was installing that in Diablo 3 the other day.
737000	738000	Nice.
738000	741000	And just chatting with folks from the guild.
741000	749000	Yeah, because obviously I played WoW pretty hardcore for a few years. I was doing the podcast for a while that was about nothing but WoW.
749000	760000	And I found that Battle.net, while I'm playing Diablo, or the rare occasion I'm playing Heroes of the Storm, a great way to talk to some of my old friends from WoW who are still playing.
760000	764000	There's this couple we used to raid with who lives up in Canada, and I can still keep in touch with them.
764000	769000	And then some of you guys know Gemet. I see him online once in a while and I'll talk to him or whoever else from those days.
769000	779000	I kind of like, as much as I hated the real ID and all that stuff in Battle.net at first, the concept of the chat client that goes across multiple games, I really liked.
779000	789000	Steam, I would be a fool to leave out. Steam obviously is another huge way that people can communicate across games.
789000	791000	It's a lot easier than using Tails.
791000	797000	Yeah, you've beeped me on Steam, DarkSagra. Certainly. There you go.
797000	807000	I tend to, for folks in the free company, because I hate that you can't chat while you're in an instance, so I just use Steam for that.
807000	811000	Oh, there you go. That works. Steam is a really good workaround for all that kind of stuff.
811000	814000	I don't have to keep typing slash Tails slash Tails.
814000	817000	I think you do slash T as a shortcut, just so you know.
817000	819000	I still hate having to do slash anything.
819000	830000	Quick side tangent before I get to our chat room, and this will be totally random, but tonight I made DarkSagra before the show try this pumpkin pie soda, which I couldn't stand.
830000	833000	I had it last night, but Alan's dying to know. What did you think of it?
833000	836000	It's like cream soda with pumpkin aftertaste.
836000	837000	See, I didn't like it.
837000	840000	But not good cream soda, and not good pumpkin.
840000	844000	Okay, I think she's drinking it just because.
844000	845000	It doesn't suck.
845000	847000	Cream soda, yuck.
847000	849000	I love all things pumpkin, but I do not like that.
849000	863000	I love cream soda a lot, to the point that I'll drink almost any kind of cream soda, but it's novel. I've had it once, and I'm vaguely thirsty, but I think that what's about to come out of the oven is going to be infinitely better than this.
863000	866000	Yes, DarkSagra's baking during OLR tonight.
866000	869000	I didn't make it from scratch. Fuck that.
870000	876000	Alright, Dartusuya is asking, let me guess, is it a Jones soda? No, it's some random store brand that they happen to have.
876000	878000	I think it'd taste good if it was a Jones soda.
878000	888000	Yeah, let's see, Zippo25 in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I can play games while I watch movies, but not watch movies while I play games.
888000	892000	That's an interesting way to put it.
892000	902000	I can't even do Netflix in games, because I'll keep wanting to watch whatever it is, and I can't focus on the game. I can't do both at the same time. I just can't.
902000	908000	Let's see, Kaijuto in chat says, the new Diablo is Zelda Triforce Heroes. It's the shit.
908000	919000	You know, I didn't pick that up this week, surprisingly, and I'll tell you why in a little bit. I've been playing something else, but I'm very curious about that, Triforce Heroes.
919000	923000	I want to hear more feedback from my friends about that game.
923000	930000	Let's see, Brad from Pod Culture says, the Jones soda pumpkin pie was kind of nasty, too, when they all drank it on Pod Culture.
930000	940000	And Tigerclaw talking about Triforce Heroes says, the only thing is all three players share the hearts. If any one person dies, you restart the level.
940000	945000	Ouch. I bet that doesn't get annoying whatsoever, I'm sure.
945000	956000	Okay, so Halloween's this week. Happy Halloween to all of our OLR listeners, and I hope whatever it is you're doing this weekend will be safe for you.
956000	959000	Halloween makes me miss Radiscoll and Devil Doll.
959000	961000	Why is that?
961000	968000	Just because the second episode that they did was a Halloween one. It was called Halloweeny. It was funny.
968000	969000	Random.
969000	970000	I know.
971000	978000	So I'm going to ask you guys, how do you plan to celebrate Halloween, and is there any gaming involved? Will you be doing any special Halloween gaming?
978000	987000	I'll start. I am absolutely going to, and I think a lot of people will be doing this, but I will be playing the PT demo on Halloween.
987000	992000	Hopefully I'll be able to squeeze in between some other stuff I'm doing on Halloween, because I'm kind of busy.
992000	997000	Rocky Horror, obviously, is also a really big Halloween thing, and I'm hosting that here in SAC on Halloween.
997000	1005000	So I've got to make sure I can kind of squeeze that in, but I do plan to do a stream, hopefully, of PT on Halloween, because you've got to.
1005000	1011000	And I'm sure a lot of people are going to be doing it, those that haven't lost it from their PlayStation 4s. I've got to do PT.
1011000	1013000	So what about you guys for Halloween?
1013000	1015000	Going to the Bay Area.
1015000	1016000	Yeah.
1016000	1018000	See the mills.
1018000	1024000	Any, well I guess, yeah I'll be going to that too, at least making a cameo, but any gaming at that?
1024000	1026000	I'm sure there'll be some gaming.
1026000	1028000	Because we all met playing music-based games, so.
1028000	1034000	And then, I don't know, it depends on when we come back, what else we're going to do.
1034000	1039000	But hey, it's a half day, so I'm sure I'll find something to do.
1039000	1041000	Is there any?
1041000	1044000	Maybe some, my favorite of the Silent Hills.
1044000	1045000	Might have to happen.
1045000	1046000	Which is?
1046000	1047000	Three.
1047000	1048000	Three is my favorite.
1048000	1050000	So you can play with the Heather Beam?
1050000	1052000	Heather Beam!
1052000	1056000	Because it's funny for the Heather Beam, like, it's her Japanese voice.
1056000	1058000	So it makes me laugh. Heather Beam!
1058000	1059000	So.
1059000	1060000	Alright.
1060000	1062000	Loki, how about you for Halloween?
1062000	1063000	No, I'm not doing anything.
1063000	1066000	You're not doing anything? I thought you were going to go to this elaborate costume and all this stuff?
1066000	1071000	Oh, well I'm making the costume, yeah, that's for work though, but that's not for Halloween, that's just for like the day before.
1071000	1073000	That's just for work, I see.
1073000	1077000	So, any gaming? If you're not going to do anything, are you going to do any gaming at all for Halloween? Scary game?
1077000	1078000	No.
1078000	1079000	Do you scare your kids?
1079000	1081000	No, they'll probably go trick or treating.
1081000	1083000	And then I'll eat their candy.
1083000	1087000	That's like the advantage of being a parent.
1087000	1089000	That's the trick.
1089000	1094000	You know, I did just remember the other thing I'm probably going to have going on when I get back that night.
1094000	1096000	Is working on my Grey Warden staff.
1096000	1099000	Oh, yeah, for your cosplay you're doing for gamer acts.
1099000	1101000	Yeah, I've got all of this stuff ready to put together.
1101000	1102000	Nice.
1102000	1104000	And Victoria is making the costume.
1104000	1105000	Awesome.
1105000	1106000	But I have to build-
1106000	1108000	Who did my Joker costume, by the way, if you saw it on-
1108000	1110000	I have to build my staff and that's going to be the fun part.
1110000	1111000	Okay.
1111000	1112000	And I've got to modify my boots.
1112000	1113000	That'll be fun.
1113000	1114000	It'll be a neat costume.
1114000	1115000	Awesome.
1115000	1118000	Well, I know you want to go tend to the little pumpkin rolls.
1118000	1119000	Well, hold on, hold on before you go.
1119000	1120000	Before you go.
1120000	1121000	Okay, well good.
1121000	1122000	They're cooling for a bit.
1122000	1124000	Then while they cool, I want to get into our gaming weeks.
1124000	1125000	Okay.
1125000	1129000	Because of course we like to start off the show talking about the types of video games that we've been playing this week.
1129000	1130000	So, Dark Soccer-
1130000	1131000	Mind games.
1131000	1132000	How was your gaming week?
1132000	1134000	It was all right.
1134000	1140000	I've been playing some more Happy Home Designer, Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer.
1140000	1144000	Now I have to design Town Hall, so that's interesting.
1144000	1146000	Do you need the amiibo cards for that?
1146000	1149000	Because I saw a ton of them yesterday and I was like, maybe I should be buying these for Jamie.
1149000	1151000	Because I don't think these are like super easy to find right now.
1151000	1154000	I have a small pack of them that came with it, but I don't know.
1154000	1155000	I haven't opened the cards.
1155000	1156000	Oh, okay.
1156000	1160000	So if you find any of the neat cards, like the kitty cats or any of them-
1160000	1161000	Aren't they all blind reveals?
1161000	1162000	Yeah, I guess they are.
1162000	1164000	So just buy me a pack and I'll thank you for them.
1164000	1168000	All right, well, BRB, I have to go back to Chico where I saw them.
1168000	1170000	They have them at the Toys R Us near my house.
1170000	1171000	Oh yeah, that's good.
1171000	1175000	But I think I'm worth $6 in a trip to Chico.
1175000	1181000	I downloaded Diablo 3 and Heroes of the Storm, so I'm going to be trying to get into that.
1181000	1184000	Although a lot of my coworkers play Hearthstone 2.
1184000	1189000	I'm like, no more Magic games, no more.
1189000	1191000	We've been playing Super Mario 3D World.
1191000	1199000	Dan's playing through Super Mario 2 Advance on the Wii U, playing the Virtual Console version.
1199000	1200000	Oh, right.
1200000	1203000	And we got Tank, Tank, Tank.
1203000	1205000	So we're probably going to be playing that tonight.
1205000	1208000	Really? I didn't like that game on the Wii U at all.
1208000	1212000	Well, Dan just found it and got super excited and bought it.
1212000	1216000	Oh, so they have that free, like the free to play version.
1216000	1217000	It's just really a demo.
1217000	1219000	We've got the game, the game game.
1219000	1220000	Okay, wow.
1222000	1224000	Oh yeah, Dragon Age Inquisition.
1224000	1228000	I'm back to actually playing through two new side-by-side playthroughs.
1228000	1232000	Because I'm comparing the Templar playthrough with the Mage playthrough.
1232000	1241000	And I'm also trying to finish Origins, but it's kind of hard to go back and play Origins after playing Inquisition with how pretty it is.
1241000	1242000	Yeah, same.
1242000	1245000	And how much better the game plays, oh my god.
1246000	1248000	That's why I was never able to beat Origins.
1248000	1250000	Origins is like a clusterfuck for fighting.
1250000	1251000	Yeah.
1252000	1255000	I really like the combat in Dragon Age 2.
1255000	1259000	I like the combat in Inquisition a whole lot better too.
1261000	1265000	So I was playing that and I started Beginner's Guide.
1265000	1272000	Which is really just a game dedicated to the games of this other person who I think stopped making games.
1272000	1278000	So it's basically this person's old levels and everything and someone walking through and talking about game design.
1278000	1282000	And it's by the folks that did the Stanley parable, so it's pretty neat.
1282000	1283000	Nice.
1283000	1286000	And I bought Elder Scrolls Online.
1286000	1288000	But I haven't started it yet.
1288000	1291000	It's 20 bucks on the Humble sale, I think it's over though.
1291000	1292000	Oh wow, okay.
1292000	1295000	I got the Capcom Humble bundle.
1295000	1300000	And I played Final Fantasy XIV for a little bit, so it's kind of...
1300000	1301000	You've been busy.
1301000	1307000	Busier than usual, but I've got crap ton of other stuff I need to get done, so probably going to be slow.
1307000	1308000	In the rush to Halloween.
1308000	1311000	Loki, how was your gaming week besides the Minecraft you're playing right now?
1311000	1315000	I did play Minecraft earlier this week as well, so there's that.
1315000	1316000	What else did I play?
1316000	1318000	Minecraft Story Mode.
1318000	1322000	Not because I'm just obsessed with Minecraft or something, but because I wanted to check it out.
1322000	1326000	See what exactly they're going to do for a story-based Minecraft game.
1326000	1328000	And it was okay.
1328000	1334000	I was asking Rob earlier how the other Telltale games are as far as, are they pretty linear?
1334000	1337000	Do they have a lot of stuff that you have to do, like puzzle solving?
1337000	1346000	Because I'm coming into it thinking, oh hey, I used to play these old PC adventure games and stuff from LucasArts a while back.
1346000	1348000	Is this anything like this?
1348000	1350000	And it seemed pretty linear.
1350000	1352000	It's entertaining, I guess.
1352000	1353000	It was short.
1353000	1356000	I finished the first episode in about two hours, maybe.
1356000	1357000	If that.
1357000	1361000	And there wasn't really a whole lot of interaction other than just dialogue.
1361000	1365000	And the rest is kind of just watching it and there's a few quick time events.
1365000	1367000	That's about it, I mean.
1367000	1375000	Yeah, I kind of found the Telltale games to not be, at least the ones I've played, like Walking Dead and Jurassic Park even I played.
1375000	1378000	I didn't find those games to be super linear.
1378000	1383000	I imagine Minecraft, because it's geared towards kids, might be a little more linear than the others.
1383000	1389000	But I also didn't find it to be as rich as maybe like the King's Quest games and stuff used to be.
1389000	1392000	It was very different than that, I think.
1392000	1394000	Yeah, I don't know. It was okay.
1394000	1398000	I mean, I was just kind of curious to see how they would kind of throw a story into that.
1398000	1400000	And of course they have different characters, not Steve or anything.
1400000	1401000	Right.
1401000	1403000	My son kept going, like, you know, is Steve in that?
1403000	1405000	I'm like, no, he's not in this game.
1405000	1408000	And it's like, why isn't he in there? Why isn't Steve in there?
1408000	1410000	Because Steve died.
1410000	1412000	Because Steve's not in the game.
1412000	1415000	Although he should make a cameo. I think that they should do that.
1415000	1418000	I kind of got, I don't know.
1418000	1423000	I was getting a little bit annoyed with Patton Oswalt's voice acting, though, in the game.
1423000	1426000	But whatever. It was okay.
1426000	1431000	Whether I'm going to pick up the rest of the episodes, I'm interested.
1431000	1433000	But it's not something that I'm going to make a priority right now.
1433000	1436000	Especially since they discount that stuff, like, all the time.
1436000	1438000	So I may just wait for it to be discounted.
1438000	1440000	But it was okay.
1440000	1442000	I mean, I guess it's worth five bucks.
1442000	1443000	Which is what I paid for it.
1443000	1445000	And then you can play it through it again.
1445000	1448000	And there's different, you know, dialogue things that can happen and stuff.
1448000	1450000	Sure.
1450000	1452000	I tried Super Time Force a little bit.
1452000	1455000	I didn't really get past the demo or the tutorial portion.
1455000	1457000	I just kind of got sick of it.
1457000	1460000	It was mainly just killing time while Minecraft Story Mode was downloading.
1460000	1462000	And then, what else?
1462000	1464000	I...
1464000	1466000	Let's see.
1466000	1468000	I mentioned Minecraft already.
1468000	1470000	I started playing Final Fantasy VI again.
1470000	1472000	Just a little bit.
1472000	1474000	Because I actually started Final Fantasy VII.
1474000	1478000	And then it just did not look good anymore.
1478000	1481000	I mean, it was awesome on PlayStation 1.
1481000	1483000	But, oh my god.
1483000	1485000	Now it just kind of...
1485000	1487000	It did not hold up too well.
1487000	1494000	Or maybe I just don't like it the way that they kind of up-rezzed everything for this update for the PC version.
1494000	1496000	So maybe that's the thing that bothers me about it.
1496000	1500000	But, other than that, I mean Final Fantasy VI is amazing.
1500000	1502000	So, I started that.
1502000	1504000	I don't know if I'll finish it or not.
1504000	1506000	But, it's a fun game.
1506000	1508000	And then Ingress.
1508000	1510000	I played Ingress and got to level 6.
1510000	1512000	I hit level 2.
1512000	1514000	Did you really? Congrats.
1514000	1516000	Yeah.
1516000	1518000	I don't know if I need to finish all the tutorial stuff in that.
1518000	1520000	No, you don't. I never did.
1520000	1522000	Do you get a badge for that or something?
1522000	1524000	No, I don't think so.
1524000	1527000	They had to suspend the verify thing because they didn't have the resources for it.
1527000	1530000	But, I was going to ask real quick about Final Fantasy VII.
1530000	1532000	Whatever happened to the...
1532000	1534000	Remember last year at the PlayStation experience?
1534000	1538000	They announced Final Fantasy VII, but it was just the PC version on PlayStation 4.
1538000	1540000	And everybody was like, fuck off. That's not what we asked for.
1540000	1543000	And then, Sony finally delivered it at E3.
1543000	1545000	It was like, okay, okay. We were just fucking with you. Here it is.
1545000	1548000	But, I thought that PC thing was still coming.
1548000	1551000	Like, is that not happening now because of the other remake?
1551000	1553000	I hope not.
1553000	1555000	I hope it's not coming.
1555000	1557000	I don't like the PC version that well.
1557000	1559000	I just don't think it looks that great.
1559000	1561000	Put up just the regular version of the game.
1561000	1563000	Have it play on the PlayStation 4. Done.
1563000	1565000	You know what I mean?
1565000	1567000	Because they have it out there already as a title.
1567000	1573000	Hell, just make it so we can play PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 games.
1573000	1575000	Hell, it'll all have itself for PlayStation 1 games.
1575000	1577000	Because, shit.
1577000	1579000	If a fucking PSP can play PlayStation 1 games,
1579000	1583000	the fucking PlayStation 4 has the power to be able to emulate PlayStation 1 games.
1583000	1587000	I really feel like that's an unlock we're gonna get at this PlayStation experience.
1587000	1593000	I just really feel like, you know, the Christmas season's a good time to announce something like that.
1593000	1595000	I just, I really hope that's the mic drop.
1595000	1597000	Because, like, that would be great.
1597000	1602000	Because, like, I have a few games from that that I got.
1602000	1605000	You know, I purchased, like, some older PlayStation 1 games.
1605000	1607000	I mean, it'd be nice. Or even PlayStation 2 games.
1607000	1614000	Like, I've got, like, Katamari that's just sitting there that, you know, I had to boot up my PlayStation 3 to be able to play that stuff.
1614000	1616000	It's stupid.
1618000	1620000	I don't want to have to do that.
1622000	1623000	But, um, alright.
1623000	1625000	So, Ingress, though. I'm playing lots of Ingress.
1625000	1627000	Not so much the last couple days.
1627000	1630000	Because I've been really trying to focus on having to work on my costume.
1630000	1632000	Which hasn't happened.
1632000	1634000	Because I've been super tired.
1634000	1637000	Like, today I was trying to even do the show role and I fell asleep.
1637000	1639000	Because I was exhausted.
1639000	1641000	I wonder why your stories went up later than usual.
1643000	1645000	So, yeah. I was doing that while my kids were napping.
1645000	1647000	And, like, I just passed out.
1647000	1649000	Because I'm so tired.
1649000	1654000	So, unfortunately, last night was going to be one of the times I had to work on that.
1654000	1656000	And it just didn't happen.
1656000	1661000	But, ideally, I'm going to be a Lego minifigure of Loki.
1661000	1663000	Because that would be funny.
1663000	1665000	Not yourself, but...
1665000	1667000	But Loki from Marvel Superheroes.
1667000	1669000	Or Lego Marvel Superheroes.
1669000	1670000	Nice.
1670000	1673000	And if I don't have enough time, then it'll have to be something else.
1673000	1675000	I look forward to the pictures.
1675000	1677000	Yeah. So, it'll be something Lego related.
1677000	1679000	I'm going to work on it tonight.
1679000	1680000	I'm going to try.
1680000	1682000	Alright. As far as my gaming week goes.
1682000	1684000	Mostly the same games.
1684000	1685000	Diablo 3.
1685000	1687000	I don't remember if I mentioned it last week.
1687000	1690000	I've now hit Paragon, like, 330.
1690000	1693000	In my adventures in Diablo 3 and playing with Alan.
1693000	1697000	I have surpassed the Paragon level of my non-seasonal characters.
1697000	1699000	Which would be all the previous seasons.
1699000	1701000	And pre that seasonal stuff combined.
1701000	1705000	Because your seasonal XP dumps into the main pool every time a season ends.
1705000	1707000	So, I've now surpassed that point.
1707000	1710000	So, that should tell you about how much Diablo I've been playing lately.
1710000	1713000	However, also, you kind of get more experience now.
1713000	1717000	Because the K'Nai's Cube, which gives you the power of three more legendaries.
1717000	1719000	Allows you to do much harder content.
1719000	1722000	And so you're getting more XP through that harder content.
1722000	1725000	To be fair, this doesn't necessarily mean the hours I've spent have been more.
1725000	1728000	But certainly my character's power is greater.
1728000	1730000	So, that's been fun.
1730000	1733000	Also, I've been playing a little bit of Final Fantasy XIV.
1733000	1735000	But not a lot. I'm still kind of on a lull.
1735000	1737000	I know they had some announcements today.
1737000	1739000	We didn't really get them into the show role.
1739000	1742000	But they talked a little bit about what they're going to be doing with Patch 3.1.
1742000	1746000	And there's going to be a mini-game that involves the minions.
1746000	1747000	That's pretty cool.
1747000	1749000	And two new dungeons. So, that'll be nice.
1749000	1752000	They're going to be updating Gold Saucer, I think, with some other games.
1752000	1754000	So, that's cool.
1754000	1756000	Let's see.
1756000	1764000	I also, at a gathering of about eight people, actually got to play some Jackbox Party Pack 2.
1764000	1766000	I'd already played it a little bit last week.
1766000	1768000	But only with just a few people.
1768000	1770000	So, I think I got to play it more the way it was intended.
1770000	1772000	In a room full of people.
1772000	1776000	And we only really had the time to just play a couple of the games.
1776000	1778000	We didn't play everything.
1778000	1783000	But we played Quiplash XL, which was hilarious.
1783000	1785000	And we had a lot of fun with that.
1785000	1789000	And when you have eight people, there's a lot of prompts.
1789000	1792000	Because each prompt, I guess it's like, I don't know, Family Feud style.
1792000	1794000	Where it matches up two people at a time.
1794000	1798000	So, if you have eight people, and each person is answering two questions.
1798000	1801000	I mean, it's something like fifteen prompts or something you're going through and voting on.
1801000	1803000	But it's really funny.
1803000	1809000	Especially with the right group of people that are all kind of on that same sense of humor where we're all going to hell.
1809000	1812000	So, I had a good time playing that.
1812000	1814000	We also played Earwax.
1814000	1816000	Which was okay.
1816000	1824000	I'm not sure the formula works totally compared to some of the other Jackbox games.
1824000	1830000	Just because it's weird that you really have no control over the sound effects that you can have in your pool.
1830000	1834000	Like, it would be a little more interesting if it was Cards Against Humanity style or something.
1834000	1836000	Where you had a hand of sound effects.
1836000	1839000	And then the ones you didn't use, you could use in the later round or something like that.
1839000	1841000	I don't know. This thing might be a little more interesting with that.
1841000	1844000	But it's weird. You can't really preview the sound effects too.
1844000	1849000	But again, when you have so many people and everybody's in that same sense of humor.
1849000	1853000	So, every single prompt is responded to as some sort of fart noise.
1853000	1855000	There is still some humor to be found in that.
1855000	1857000	So, I didn't think the game was bad or anything.
1857000	1861000	It's not as strong as the other Jackbox games.
1861000	1866000	Which, earlier last week, myself, Allen, and Shane were all playing Bomb Corp.
1866000	1868000	That one is really cool.
1868000	1871000	That one, I think, is the reason to check out the pack.
1871000	1876000	Because it's something very, very different from a lot of the stuff you saw in Jackbox 1.
1876000	1878000	And the sense of humor is really great.
1878000	1880000	And the retro style graphics.
1880000	1882000	It's a really fun game to play together.
1882000	1885000	Bomb Corp, I think, is my favorite out of those that I've played.
1885000	1888000	Anyhow, other games I've played this week.
1888000	1891000	Dragon Quest Heroes on PlayStation 4.
1891000	1895000	I actually bought that because I was on the fence about getting it.
1895000	1897000	I wasn't sure if I wanted it.
1897000	1900000	Because I thought, ah, but I really want a main Dragon Quest game.
1900000	1901000	I'd rather play that.
1901000	1904000	But then, I was watching some Twitch streams and I was like,
1904000	1909000	oh, it's Dynasty Warriors or Hyrule Warriors, if you will, meets Dragon Quest.
1909000	1911000	I'm like, what the hell. I'll do it.
1911000	1912000	So I ended up buying it.
1912000	1915000	And I've actually sunk quite a few hours in that game.
1915000	1918000	It's fun. I'm having a good time with it.
1918000	1925000	There's something very zen and fulfilling about just the utter button mashing
1925000	1929000	where you're just taking out slime after slime and skeleton
1929000	1933000	and cute little bat things and all the other creatures in Dragon Quest.
1933000	1936000	It's really cool that in this game they've kind of blended
1936000	1938000	some of the different Dragon Quest worlds together.
1938000	1941000	Because there's characters that appear from like four, five, six,
1941000	1944000	I think seven and eight, all show up.
1944000	1946000	So I think that was kind of cool.
1946000	1950000	So, yeah, I'm enjoying Dragon Quest Warriors more than I thought I would.
1950000	1954000	Even though the game doesn't have a lot of depth to it.
1954000	1959000	I mean, I guess you can set your controls two different ways.
1959000	1963000	And I chose to do the easy way, which is like you just hit square over and over,
1963000	1967000	mix in some triangle, and you're doing all these crazy-ass combos.
1967000	1970000	So, you know, I chose to, I guess, make the game a little more simpler.
1970000	1974000	But they do some other JRPG stuff in it.
1974000	1980000	Like, use the item drops you get at the Alchemist to create this accessory
1980000	1981000	that you can use.
1981000	1984000	And then you can combine accessories to make the super accessory.
1984000	1987000	And, you know, a lot of those JRPG grindy things you've come to expect.
1987000	1988000	They're all there.
1988000	1992000	JRPG grindiness is why I love Dragon Quest.
1992000	1994000	So I'm having a good time.
1994000	1998000	Just the character design is great, as it always is in Dragon Quest games.
1998000	2000000	And the music, of course.
2000000	2002000	Which is very interesting.
2002000	2004000	And I know we talked about this a little bit last week.
2004000	2006000	But I found it very interesting that right there on the title screen,
2006000	2011000	there's a little, it says, press options for more info on streaming stuff.
2011000	2013000	Or I don't know what's the streaming information.
2013000	2016000	And it actually said, when you press start, it's this whole, like, legal thing
2016000	2020000	that's like, you know, you do not have permission to stream
2020000	2023000	just for the purposes of listening to the music.
2023000	2024000	This is copyright.
2024000	2025000	Such and such.
2025000	2028000	Like, they don't want people to just stream the music only.
2028000	2030000	And they, it's so weird.
2030000	2034000	Like, all the weird copyright stuff that's in that game.
2034000	2035000	I know we dipped into it a little bit last week.
2035000	2039000	But to kind of see it firsthand in the game was kind of strange.
2039000	2043000	So I have a feeling publishers are going to get more control
2043000	2046000	over what you can and can't stream in, like, a future PlayStation 4 update.
2046000	2048000	I wouldn't be surprised if maybe when streaming's on,
2048000	2050000	they could disable the music somehow.
2050000	2052000	I feel like Square would have wanted to do that on this.
2052000	2053000	I don't know.
2053000	2057000	So, anyhow, yeah, I've been playing a lot of fun games this week.
2057000	2059000	That was my gaming week.
2059000	2062000	So, some housekeeping before we get into some news.
2062000	2063000	I don't have a lot, really, to announce here.
2063000	2065000	I don't think we're going to be here Thanksgiving weekend.
2065000	2068000	I think Dark Saga said she's going to be out of town.
2068000	2071000	And I don't think we're going to be here Thanksgiving weekend
2071000	2072000	because most of you guys probably won't be either.
2072000	2075000	But otherwise, we're still here every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific,
2075000	2077000	9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
2077000	2079000	at the Voice of the Geeks Network.
2079000	2080000	voggenetwork.com.
2080000	2083000	Although, Bobby was not on tonight.
2083000	2087000	He had some other stuff to take care of tonight, so he was not able to be live.
2087000	2089000	But he'll be back next week, as will we.
2089000	2092000	So, let's get into some gaming news.
2092000	2093000	Loki.
2093000	2099000	So, Sony has confirmed that they don't have any first-party titles coming for the Vita.
2099000	2101000	And I can't say that I'm surprised
2101000	2104000	because they haven't had a lot of first-party titles since...
2104000	2106000	God, what was the last one they had for that?
2106000	2110000	Was it that Media Molecule game? I think the paper one.
2110000	2111000	I don't remember what it's called now.
2111000	2112000	Tearaway.
2112000	2113000	Tearaway, yes.
2113000	2114000	Which they ended up putting on the PlayStation 4.
2114000	2115000	Yes, exactly.
2115000	2119000	So, that was the last one I think that they did for that console.
2119000	2124000	They're basically allowing the third parties to basically shine on that.
2124000	2125000	And that's it.
2125000	2127000	They're focusing on the PlayStation 4.
2127000	2130000	Shine or do the work for our dying console?
2130000	2131000	Uh...
2131000	2132000	Yeah.
2132000	2133000	And sorry to the Vita fans,
2133000	2135000	because no one is going to ruffle some feathers with that comment,
2135000	2137000	but at the same time, come on.
2137000	2138000	If Sony themselves is like,
2138000	2140000	eh, we're not really interested in developing for it,
2140000	2141000	what does that tell you?
2141000	2143000	It's on its way out.
2143000	2144000	They're just not making the money back on it.
2144000	2146000	You've seen the writing on the wall for a while with that console.
2146000	2147000	They're not making the money back on it.
2147000	2148000	And that's fine.
2148000	2152000	I think that third parties should be able to do well on it.
2152000	2154000	But this kind of pisses me off more
2154000	2157000	that we don't have something like PlayStation Mobile again
2157000	2160000	where you could easily publish to it
2160000	2163000	and be able to put a lot of those indie titles out there.
2163000	2164000	Because that'd be awesome to be able to...
2164000	2166000	You want a PlayStation Ouya?
2166000	2170000	I want a PlayStation that just has, you know,
2170000	2173000	the same kind of app store like an Android
2173000	2176000	or maybe not so much like Android or iOS
2176000	2178000	because there's a lot of shit on there.
2178000	2180000	But maybe like Steam.
2180000	2182000	I mean, Steam has a lot of shit on there too,
2182000	2185000	but it's a lot less, I think,
2185000	2188000	because there's a little bit of a barrier of entry to that.
2188000	2191000	But I'd like to see something like that,
2191000	2195000	that at least has, there's a way to get your content out there.
2195000	2196000	So I think that was a pretty cool idea.
2196000	2198000	It's just it wasn't something that was promoted.
2198000	2200000	It's like they have these programs where they're like,
2200000	2203000	eh, we're just not gonna really do anything with it.
2203000	2205000	Like they'll announce it and they'll get all excited about it
2205000	2208000	and they're like, eh, oh, yeah, we do have that, don't we?
2208000	2210000	Oh, well, fuck it. It's gone.
2210000	2213000	I'd be really curious to see that post-mortem expose
2213000	2215000	on the PlayStation Vita in like five years
2215000	2219000	from all the insiders on what the fuck happened.
2219000	2220000	But here's the other weird thing, though.
2221000	2223000	You know, we say all this,
2223000	2225000	but then every week here on the show,
2225000	2227000	I'm reading Japanese release dates,
2227000	2229000	and there's something on the Vita every week in Japan.
2229000	2231000	Granted, it's not Sony,
2231000	2234000	but maybe that whole third parties are gonna carry it thing
2234000	2236000	is working overseas in a way it's not working here.
2236000	2238000	I think it's just the difference in culture
2238000	2241000	because you have a lot of people that are taking mass transit,
2241000	2244000	you know, to places and they have time to kill
2244000	2246000	and it's time to play these games.
2246000	2249000	It's more of a portable, you know,
2249000	2252000	it seems to be more conducive to like portable gaming.
2252000	2255000	But people here seem to just use their phones.
2255000	2258000	Yeah, they use their phones for that,
2258000	2261000	but I just don't think it's like, I don't know,
2261000	2263000	I don't think that you can get the same experience with it
2263000	2265000	without the buttons and everything.
2265000	2267000	I don't want to play, I have Minecraft on my phone,
2267000	2269000	I bought it, I don't want to play it
2269000	2274000	because it doesn't support a controller, which is stupid.
2274000	2277000	So I don't want to play it that way.
2277000	2280000	Akuma JP in chat who happens to be in Japan says,
2280000	2282000	Bingo, Loki.
2282000	2285000	I'm assuming what you're saying about why it's succeeding in Japan
2285000	2287000	where it's not doing so well here in America.
2287000	2289000	But it's not like we don't have mass transit.
2289000	2291000	They tried like to make this console,
2291000	2293000	it was way too expensive when it came out.
2293000	2295000	They have like, oh, look, it's gonna have like mobile in it,
2295000	2298000	you can get mobile data plans through AT&T,
2298000	2300000	which it was like, ooh, 3G.
2300000	2302000	Oh, by the way, it can't really do anything over that,
2302000	2305000	other than just you can do the asynchronous,
2305000	2308000	you know, game multiplayer or some shit like that,
2308000	2310000	like Ghost Racing.
2310000	2312000	It's like, no one wanted to do that.
2312000	2315000	They wanted to have it where you can play like actual people
2315000	2317000	over the internet and stuff like that.
2317000	2320000	And maybe now that's something that they can do.
2320000	2323000	I would love to see them put out another portable console
2323000	2326000	that wasn't shit, I don't know.
2326000	2328000	Well, Bonds006 in chat says,
2328000	2331000	Dear Sony, the Vita just had to take away almost 30 years
2331000	2333000	of Ninty handheld presence.
2333000	2335000	That was a huge uphill battle.
2335000	2339000	Yeah, but I don't think Nintendo is necessarily insurmountable either.
2339000	2342000	I mean, when we get into some of the NX predictions
2342000	2345000	about how Nintendo is really going to make an ecosystem
2345000	2347000	out of their dominant handheld in their system,
2347000	2349000	that's gonna be very interesting, you know,
2349000	2351000	if those rumors pan out or whatever.
2351000	2354000	But, I mean, Nintendo is not insurmountable
2354000	2358000	because, let us not forget, the 3DS,
2358000	2360000	there was a moment where people were questioning
2360000	2362000	if the 3DS was gonna make it.
2362000	2365000	And Nintendo really pushed out some of those first-party things
2365000	2367000	that people were really hoping for.
2367000	2369000	I think it was like when a Mario Kart game came out.
2369000	2372000	Yeah, like Mario Kart and Animal Crossing
2372000	2374000	and the new Super Mario Brothers.
2374000	2376000	Yeah, it kind of all came out all at once
2376000	2378000	to really pull that console up.
2378000	2380000	Sony had an opportunity to strike,
2380000	2384000	and they kind of did with the PSP,
2384000	2387000	but I'm not sure they ever really supported the PSP in the same way.
2387000	2389000	Well, Sony, that's the thing,
2389000	2392000	the problem was they put it to like,
2392000	2395000	oh, we're gonna have these other companies
2395000	2397000	port over our games to that console,
2397000	2398000	and that was the problem.
2398000	2401000	They were like, oh yeah, we're gonna have Call of Duty,
2401000	2403000	and we're gonna have Resistance,
2403000	2405000	and I was like, fuck yes, mobile Call of Duty?
2405000	2407000	That's gonna be amazing.
2407000	2409000	And then the Resistance game came out
2409000	2411000	by the same developer of the Call of Duty game,
2411000	2413000	and it was terrible.
2413000	2415000	It was fucking garbage.
2415000	2417000	And I was like, uhhhh,
2417000	2419000	I'm not sure if I want to play this Call of Duty game,
2419000	2421000	and then the Call of Duty game comes out,
2421000	2423000	oh, it's fucking terrible too.
2423000	2425000	It's like, why did you do that?
2425000	2429000	Why did you entrust your most popular franchises to garbage?
2429000	2432000	And I have to do the research,
2432000	2435000	but I think it might be the same company
2435000	2437000	that put out the last Tony Hawk game too.
2437000	2439000	Maybe, I don't know.
2439000	2441000	I don't know about that, but
2441000	2444000	yeah, you can't do that.
2444000	2447000	You can't just have this first-party title
2447000	2449000	that's gonna really carry the console,
2449000	2451000	and just shuffle it off to some company
2451000	2453000	that might be able to do it.
2453000	2455000	DungeonBuster in chat says,
2455000	2457000	nice hardware, but kind of hard to break
2457000	2459000	Nintendo's vice-like grip without the kind of
2459000	2461000	third-party title glut that have driven
2461000	2463000	Nintendo's handhelds.
2463000	2465000	So interesting when you compare that to the situation
2465000	2467000	that Wii U's been in, though.
2467000	2469000	It's so, I mean, like, I don't know,
2469000	2471000	it's so crazy to me.
2471000	2473000	Also, in chat,
2473000	2475000	Oh, IkumaJP kind of clarifying what was said,
2475000	2477000	or no, saying bingo again for Loki, saying,
2477000	2479000	the Vita has bells and whistles,
2479000	2481000	but most we don't need.
2481000	2483000	And I can hear that,
2483000	2486000	because, yeah, I have a 3G Vita.
2486000	2489000	Why? Why do I fucking have a 3G Vita?
2489000	2491000	I really, I mean, I only bought it
2491000	2493000	because it was on sale on Amazon.
2493000	2495000	It ended up being just as much as like a Wi-Fi one would
2495000	2497000	and it had a game with it or whatever.
2497000	2499000	But, like, there really was no fucking reason
2499000	2501000	to have a 3G Vita.
2501000	2503000	No, there wasn't. It didn't do anything.
2503000	2505000	I was not going to pay for that data plan.
2505000	2508000	Why didn't it do online gaming over 3G?
2508000	2510000	I think that scared AT&T
2510000	2512000	and all these, because, you know,
2512000	2514000	as everything in voice is going
2514000	2516000	unlimited minutes, unlimited minutes,
2516000	2518000	we're seeing these mobile companies
2518000	2520000	start to gouge the shit out of data,
2520000	2522000	which we all know is not that expensive,
2522000	2524000	but like fucking Verizon or somebody this week,
2524000	2526000	didn't they just come out and say,
2526000	2528000	well, we'll let you keep your grandfathered
2528000	2530000	but now we're going to charge you, like,
2530000	2532000	something like, it's up to like 40 bucks a month now
2532000	2534000	for Verizon's unlimited data plan,
2534000	2536000	if you want to stay on it.
2536000	2538000	So it's like, these wireless companies
2538000	2540000	know that data is their bread and butter,
2540000	2542000	so I think they were afraid of all that multi-player gaming stuff.
2542000	2544000	Well, here's the worst part about those companies.
2544000	2546000	They'll have their advertised rates.
2546000	2548000	Oh, but there's a line access fee
2548000	2550000	that's like $20 that you have to pay
2550000	2552000	in order to have access
2552000	2554000	to all that high-speed data and everything.
2554000	2556000	So that, yeah, that was the thing with Verizon.
2556000	2558000	Like, I was like, hey, well, shit, that's 40 bucks a month,
2558000	2560000	you know, or whatever.
2560000	2562000	You know, that's like, you know, what I'm paying now,
2562000	2564000	plus it's, you know, unlimited minutes,
2564000	2566000	so hell, I'm going to do that.
2566000	2568000	And they're, oh, yeah, but it's also got,
2568000	2570000	there's this access fee that you have to pay.
2570000	2572000	Like, well, that wasn't advertised here.
2572000	2574000	Oh, yeah, but there's that small asterisk
2574000	2576000	that you didn't see there.
2576000	2578000	Geez. It's okay.
2578000	2580000	It ended up with my employee discount.
2580000	2582000	It's like 10 bucks more than I was paying before.
2582000	2584000	Um, AkumaJP says,
2584000	2586000	When he was in the dump at the time, remember the PlayStation 3
2586000	2588000	was not selling and people were letting go.
2588000	2590000	That's why Allgame win third party.
2590000	2592000	Tigerklonchat says,
2592000	2594000	Those that are grandfathered in with unlimited data
2594000	2596000	isn't really unlimited. The minute you reach
2596000	2598000	a certain cap, they will throttle your connection
2598000	2600000	even if it's still unlimited.
2600000	2602000	Yeah, I know, because I have AT&T
2602000	2604000	and it's the same thing where, you know,
2604000	2606000	I'll get a nasty text like,
2606000	2608000	I don't know if I should be admitting this,
2608000	2610000	but like six or seven days into the month,
2610000	2612000	I'll get my text that says you're
2612000	2614000	almost at your bandwidth cap
2614000	2616000	and you're gonna get throttled.
2616000	2618000	And I guess they probably do throttle me,
2618000	2620000	but I don't, I actually don't notice it.
2620000	2622000	What I've read is that they throttle during peak times.
2622000	2624000	But peak times are
2624000	2626000	probably when I'm driving to and from work
2626000	2628000	and I'm not really using much data outside
2628000	2630000	of maybe Waze. You know what I mean?
2630000	2632000	Uh, yeah, I don't use much, okay,
2632000	2634000	well, I do use a lot of data now just because
2634000	2636000	of stupid Ingress, but, um, aside
2636000	2638000	from that, I'm not, because
2638000	2640000	Ingress is the most expensive free game I've ever played.
2640000	2642000	Why? What the fuck is it doing
2642000	2644000	that's using so much data? Pinging
2644000	2646000	where I'm at? I mean, uh, the portal
2646000	2648000	pictures, the maps. The pictures
2648000	2650000	are so fucking tiny. There's no way
2650000	2652000	that that's like a big data
2652000	2654000	thing that's like sucking, what,
2654000	2656000	like a one megabyte picture?
2656000	2658000	Whoo! I mean, there's no way
2658000	2660000	that that shit is fucking taking up all
2660000	2662000	that bandwidth. Cache that
2662000	2664000	shit. I mean, come on.
2664000	2666000	Whatever, but yeah, I use
2666000	2668000	about a hundred, it's about a hundred megs, I think,
2668000	2670000	an hour, maybe, that you
2670000	2672000	play that for no
2672000	2674000	reason. Yep, I know, I know.
2674000	2676000	Anyway, uh,
2676000	2678000	so we got on a bit of a tangent there,
2678000	2680000	but, uh, no, I really hope
2680000	2682000	the system does well. I mean, I think it's
2682000	2684000	pretty nice. It's a little,
2684000	2686000	ergonomically, it could use a little bit
2686000	2688000	of help, but it was nice that they had the dual
2688000	2690000	analog sticks and everything. The back touch
2690000	2692000	thing was absolutely fucking not
2692000	2694000	necessary at all. Um,
2694000	2696000	it could have used maybe a second set of, um,
2696000	2698000	rear trigger, or, you know, rear
2698000	2700000	shoulder buttons. That would have been nice.
2700000	2702000	Um, that's
2702000	2704000	about it. The front facing camera,
2704000	2706000	totally not fucking necessary. Actually,
2706000	2708000	a camera at all on those fucking devices,
2708000	2710000	not fucking necessary. Even the 3DS.
2710000	2712000	Yeah. The 3D picture thing is kinda
2712000	2714000	cool. Um, it was cool for
2714000	2716000	a minute. For a minute, yeah, and then, like,
2716000	2718000	I don't know, it was just kinda lame. What games
2718000	2720000	use it?
2720000	2722000	That people actually play? Don't give me that
2722000	2724000	AR games and all that. The people don't use it.
2724000	2726000	No, the AR cards too.
2726000	2728000	Both systems. The AR cards. That was
2728000	2730000	fucking stupid. No one needs that.
2730000	2732000	Alright. Well, moving
2732000	2734000	on. Maybe things should just go back to the
2734000	2736000	way they used to be. At least that's where Square
2736000	2738000	Enix might be headed. Uh, interesting
2738000	2740000	because they released their annual
2740000	2742000	report, which, you know, we're getting to the end of the
2742000	2744000	financial year for various companies.
2744000	2746000	So Square Enix put out their annual
2746000	2748000	report about, you know, where the money's made and all
2748000	2750000	that. And an interesting passage
2750000	2752000	from their annual report, and this is
2752000	2754000	a quote from that, says,
2782000	2784000	Well, at the same time, have new customers enjoyed the
2784000	2786000	IP as though it were brand new? By not
2786000	2788000	only optimizing single pieces of IP
2788000	2790000	for single platforms, but also rolling
2790000	2792000	out IP in a multidimensional manner to meet the
2792000	2794000	needs of the modern market, we believe we can
2794000	2796000	deliver exciting new experiences.
2796000	2798000	So, interesting because
2798000	2800000	they basically say, they're gonna go back
2800000	2802000	and reinvent stuff they did on old consoles
2802000	2804000	for new technology. So, like
2804000	2806000	Chrono Trigger on the Oculus Rift.
2806000	2808000	Who's ready for it? Yeah.
2808000	2810000	Obviously, I'm jumping into conclusion here.
2810000	2812000	Come on, that's a franchise you haven't touched in a while.
2812000	2814000	I could think that would do well.
2814000	2816000	Hell yes. Oh my god, that's a great one.
2816000	2818000	Good answer.
2818000	2820000	Dark Sakura, is there a classic Square Enix
2820000	2822000	franchise you'd like to see them reinvent
2822000	2824000	for the newer technology that's out there?
2824000	2826000	No. No. Actually,
2826000	2828000	yes, I do have one. And I would...
2828000	2830000	Day one. Day one.
2830000	2832000	Ur-guys. Ur-guys would be good.
2832000	2834000	No, no, not ur-guys.
2834000	2836000	Super Mario fucking RPG.
2836000	2838000	Super Mario RPG.
2838000	2840000	Might be difficult. Why would it be difficult?
2840000	2842000	Because of the whole Nintendo.
2842000	2844000	Unless... Come on, Nintendo.
2844000	2846000	Come on. You know.
2846000	2848000	Let's get your tinfoil
2848000	2850000	hats, everybody. Get the aluminum foil out of your
2850000	2852000	kitchen drawer. You ready, everybody? Get them
2852000	2854000	out. Get them out. Make your hat. Put it on.
2854000	2856000	Here we go. Here we go. Here goes
2856000	2858000	Rob justifying how Super Mario
2858000	2860000	RPG could be in the remakes right now.
2860000	2862000	Here's how it is. Do you remember
2862000	2864000	a couple months ago, there was a rumor floating
2864000	2866000	around that Nintendo
2866000	2868000	for the NX was
2868000	2870000	majorly in bed with a third-party
2870000	2872000	publisher. And some people were speculating
2872000	2874000	that publisher was Square Enix.
2874000	2876000	What if...
2876000	2878000	What if...
2878000	2880000	Nintendo's letting them do a new Super Mario
2880000	2882000	RPG as a launch title for NX?
2882000	2884000	That'd be cool, but I don't think that's gonna happen.
2884000	2886000	As
2886000	2888000	quick as you were to fanboy about that, you should just miss that.
2888000	2890000	I think they would do like a Dragon
2890000	2892000	Quest game or something like that.
2892000	2894000	Because they could kind of publish
2894000	2896000	first-party stuff. 12's already been announced for 3DS
2896000	2898000	and PlayStation 4, so unless...
2898000	2900000	It would be cool. I would be down with that.
2900000	2902000	But I don't think that would be something that
2902000	2904000	most... It's not gonna get
2904000	2906000	the casual audience to come over to the NX.
2906000	2908000	It would get the hardcore
2908000	2910000	fans of RPGs and stuff to come over.
2910000	2912000	Unless they make it
2912000	2914000	approachable enough for them.
2914000	2916000	As fun as tinfoil hat
2916000	2918000	moments are, I think in reality, that
2918000	2920000	moved on to the Mario and Luigi series
2920000	2922000	that you see on handhelds. I know it's not
2922000	2924000	the same, but that's kind of
2924000	2926000	you know, where things are at.
2926000	2928000	Come on, you can do it all epic and shit like
2928000	2930000	fucking Kingdom Hearts and stuff.
2930000	2932000	ActDeft in chat says
2932000	2934000	I'm surprised it hasn't appeared in the Wii U virtual
2934000	2936000	console. You know,
2936000	2938000	me too, although I'm sure it's rights.
2938000	2940000	Again, agreements, sign-offs,
2940000	2942000	things like that. Licenses
2942000	2944000	that expired and so on. That's why it doesn't
2944000	2946000	show up on virtual console.
2946000	2948000	But anything is possible. Dare to dream, you guys.
2948000	2950000	Dare to dream.
2950000	2952000	Let's see,
2952000	2954000	what else do I want to say on that whole thing about
2954000	2956000	the remakes and so forth.
2956000	2958000	So Dark Soccer, you're against it, right?
2958000	2960000	I just don't care.
2960000	2962000	You don't care, or you don't want them to do it?
2962000	2964000	If they want to do it, they can do it. It doesn't mean we have to buy it.
2964000	2966000	Well, they're
2966000	2968000	going to want to make things that hopefully you buy, though,
2968000	2970000	Dark Soccer. They don't want to just make something to make
2970000	2972000	it, because making games costs a lot of money.
2972000	2974000	If I don't want it, somebody else out there
2974000	2976000	might want it, so it doesn't really matter what I think.
2976000	2978000	Can someone like, I know
2978000	2980000	this isn't Square Enix, but can someone like maybe
2980000	2982000	get a hold of Namco Bandai and say, hey, you know
2982000	2984000	what, can you guys just stop sucking for
2984000	2986000	a second and actually just make a good
2986000	2988000	new Ridge Racer game? I mean, it's kind
2988000	2990000	of sad that we don't have a Ridge Racer
2990000	2992000	game launching a new
2992000	2994000	console platform. It's been a long time
2994000	2996000	since like, what, the
2996000	2998000	PlayStation, well, the PlayStation
2998000	3000000	Vita had a Ridge Racer title.
3000000	3002000	That's where it kind of went downhill. It was like,
3002000	3004000	fucking, oh hey, yeah, it's like
3004000	3006000	30 bucks for this demo, and then you
3006000	3008000	got to buy all the tracks and all the cars.
3008000	3010000	Now, fuck that shit. I'm talking about just
3010000	3012000	like, a good Ridge Racer game to
3012000	3014000	launch a platform.
3014000	3016000	Maybe they should upscale R4.
3016000	3018000	I'd be down to that.
3018000	3020000	Well, the chat room's here to correct me when I
3020000	3022000	misspeak, and act-deft in chat says
3022000	3024000	it is on the Wii Virtual Console.
3024000	3026000	Mario RPG, I guess, is on the Wii, which you could launch
3026000	3028000	into backwards compatibility
3028000	3030000	mode on the Wii U,
3030000	3032000	which I...
3032000	3034000	That's a whole other thing. No wonder I forgot.
3034000	3036000	How convoluted is that? That I have to
3036000	3038000	launch into the Wii backwards compatibility
3038000	3040000	to see the stuff that's on the Wii.
3040000	3042000	It's so crazy that the Wii could run that, but
3042000	3044000	the Wii U, I can't
3044000	3046000	emulate that Super Nintendo game.
3046000	3048000	Hold on, let me pull out my old ass
3048000	3050000	cell phone that can emulate that
3050000	3052000	game. Just perfectly fine.
3052000	3054000	Well,
3054000	3056000	back to what I was saying,
3056000	3058000	is that I think that
3058000	3060000	there are going to be people out there who want
3060000	3062000	to get it. For me, I'm not their
3062000	3064000	target audience when it comes to this.
3064000	3066000	So, if they put out something
3066000	3068000	and I want it badly enough, then yeah, I'll get it,
3068000	3070000	but chances are, I already
3070000	3072000	have it. This is going to be for the
3072000	3074000	people who didn't hold on to their
3074000	3076000	original consoles, or
3076000	3078000	don't have some of these old games who are,
3078000	3080000	you know, super nostalgic for them.
3080000	3082000	Um...
3082000	3084000	I don't think I'm their target
3084000	3086000	audience for this, so...
3086000	3088000	Sometimes, I like the idea
3088000	3090000	of a remake, though. I'm
3090000	3092000	okay with a remake outside
3092000	3094000	of the original, you know what I mean? Like, it doesn't
3094000	3096000	always have to play just like the
3096000	3098000	pure original. Like, I'm okay with a remake once
3098000	3100000	in a while. Now, if they updated and re-released
3100000	3102000	Do Prism, or Threads of Fate,
3102000	3104000	or The Guardian Legend. I'm talking about
3104000	3106000	Squeenix.
3106000	3108000	They couldn't
3108000	3110000	redo The Guardian Legend and have it be the same
3110000	3112000	thing. Square Enix could
3112000	3114000	I don't know, give somebody
3114000	3116000	a handy and get the rights to it somehow, come on.
3116000	3118000	I want a sequel that plays the
3118000	3120000	same, but the first game was perfect as it is.
3120000	3122000	It's fair. Alright, well, by the way,
3122000	3124000	trying something new now that Twitter has polling
3124000	3126000	built into it, and I know we can do polls
3126000	3128000	at VOG Network, too, with the live
3128000	3130000	audience, but I thought, oh, I see this feature on
3130000	3132000	Twitter, let's try this. Ask a question
3132000	3134000	in advance, we can gather some responses.
3134000	3136000	So, we asked our listeners over at Twitter.com
3136000	3138000	slash OLR before tonight's show,
3138000	3140000	Square Enix saying they plan
3140000	3142000	to remake more old IPs.
3142000	3144000	Is this good news or bad news?
3144000	3146000	82% says good news.
3146000	3148000	This is good news. Only 18%
3148000	3150000	saying it was bad news. Thanks to
3150000	3152000	you guys for responding over there. That's
3152000	3154000	a pretty big majority there saying
3154000	3156000	that's good news.
3156000	3158000	I'm fine with it.
3158000	3160000	I understand why people
3160000	3162000	say bad to that. I totally
3162000	3164000	get it, because it takes the resources away from
3164000	3166000	inventing on new stuff, but again,
3166000	3168000	I think once in a while the reimaginings can be
3168000	3170000	pretty good. I don't
3170000	3172000	want them to be on mobile phones.
3172000	3174000	A lot of the bad sentiment comes from that.
3174000	3176000	There are new things though that Square Enix
3176000	3178000	came up with that have been really good.
3178000	3180000	Seriously. Well, don't forget
3180000	3182000	that Square Enix
3182000	3184000	has the IDOS stuff and the stuff that they
3184000	3186000	make here in the States.
3186000	3188000	The recent Tomb Raider reboot, for example,
3188000	3190000	one could argue that's
3190000	3192000	a reimagining of a classic IP
3192000	3194000	that worked out very well.
3194000	3196000	Rise of the Tomb Raider is something we're all
3196000	3198000	looking forward to, right?
3198000	3200000	Generally, the public is.
3200000	3202000	I think that might be an example of
3202000	3204000	where this could be exactly the type of thing they're
3204000	3206000	talking about, right? Taking an old
3206000	3208000	thing and making it
3208000	3210000	relevant for the newer consoles.
3210000	3212000	I don't know.
3212000	3214000	Just a thought on that.
3214000	3216000	To register participation
3216000	3218000	for this week's episode of Orange Under Radio at
3218000	3220000	bognetwork.com, use the passphrase
3220000	3222000	coffee.
3222000	3224000	Dungeon Buster says, also, Square Enix
3224000	3226000	needs money to make new things too.
3226000	3228000	Deus Ex and Tomb Raider
3228000	3230000	can't do it alone.
3230000	3232000	All right. Well, let's move on
3232000	3234000	to some more news here, and
3234000	3236000	we'll get more of your thoughts here later in the show.
3236000	3238000	For now, Dark Soccer.
3238000	3240000	We have some shady business going down at Harmonix.
3240000	3242000	Ooh.
3242000	3244000	What happened is
3244000	3246000	that some of the Rock Band 4 developers
3246000	3248000	went onto Amazon
3248000	3250000	and gave their game five-star reviews
3250000	3252000	without identifying themselves as having
3252000	3254000	worked on the game.
3254000	3256000	Three
3256000	3258000	in question were Matthew
3258000	3260000	Nordhaus,
3260000	3262000	Jane Tan, and
3262000	3264000	Chris Foster.
3264000	3266000	Basically gave themselves five-star reviews
3266000	3268000	and just, you know,
3268000	3270000	pretty much said, oh, the game's great.
3270000	3272000	We're doing this with our family. Well,
3272000	3274000	Harmonix has come back out after they got,
3274000	3276000	you know, outed on Reddit.
3276000	3278000	They said,
3278000	3280000	and this is the official statement, that they
3280000	3282000	have clarified their internal policy
3282000	3284000	about posting reviews on our
3284000	3286000	own products on retail sites.
3286000	3288000	And we've asked that existing reviews be
3288000	3290000	edited to identify Harmonix employees
3290000	3292000	or be removed entirely.
3292000	3294000	Um,
3294000	3296000	so they're like, ugh, they caught us.
3296000	3298000	So, here's a
3298000	3300000	smack done on it. And one of
3300000	3302000	the people who did it, he went
3302000	3304000	on and said, I added the
3304000	3306000	review half in jest, as you might be able to tell
3306000	3308000	from the tone of the original. In hindsight,
3308000	3310000	it's probably important that I know that I worked on the game
3310000	3312000	and worked for Harmonix.
3312000	3314000	Um, so
3314000	3316000	they've gone back and said, oops, we
3316000	3318000	are bad. But still,
3318000	3320000	they should have known better. Yeah, I
3320000	3322000	think that's a dangerous thing to
3322000	3324000	mess with. I worry because these people
3324000	3326000	have been, like, individually identified,
3326000	3328000	which kind of sucks for them because I just,
3328000	3330000	I just think of all the crimes
3330000	3332000	in the world you can commit,
3332000	3334000	this is not, I mean, I don't know. And
3334000	3336000	people would be like, Rob, ethics,
3336000	3338000	dah, dah, dah, dah. And I'm like, okay, yeah, but we're
3338000	3340000	talking about Amazon reviews,
3340000	3342000	people. But it's about ethics in
3342000	3344000	video games. Don't. But
3344000	3346000	the thing is, we're not
3346000	3348000	talking about some type of, like, payola
3348000	3350000	thing where,
3350000	3352000	you know, a reputable
3352000	3354000	website published this huge review
3354000	3356000	or whatever. Like, shouldn't you fucking
3356000	3358000	take Amazon reviews with a big
3358000	3360000	grain of salt anyway?
3360000	3362000	Like, that's my whole thing, is I'm almost like,
3362000	3364000	I wouldn't, I don't know, I wouldn't take them that
3364000	3366000	seriously. So,
3366000	3368000	I don't know. But I
3368000	3370000	also, at the same time, I see, like,
3370000	3372000	you get in this really dangerous place, you put
3372000	3374000	your company in an odd place when you do something
3374000	3376000	like this, and I worry for
3376000	3378000	those guys, because I think they just did, like,
3378000	3380000	a silly thing, and I would hate, like,
3380000	3382000	now that this is all just being dragged
3382000	3384000	out there, because there's no other gaming news going
3384000	3386000	on, that something, you know, is going to
3386000	3388000	happen to these guys. And I just really hope not, because I just
3388000	3390000	think of all the crimes in the world, is
3390000	3392000	leaving an Amazon review really the
3392000	3394000	biggest breach of ethics you can think of? I
3394000	3396000	don't know. Maybe I'm just, maybe I'm just
3396000	3398000	naive, but I don't pay attention to any of that stuff
3398000	3400000	anyway. It's like Yelp reviews.
3400000	3402000	I, I take
3402000	3404000	Yelp reviews with a huge grain of salt,
3404000	3406000	because either people
3406000	3408000	had a bad experience,
3408000	3410000	and they raised the place
3410000	3412000	all the time on Yelp, or
3412000	3414000	they had a good experience, or
3414000	3416000	know the owner, or
3416000	3418000	a friend or family or whatever, and
3418000	3420000	leave a five-star review. There's, like, nothing in the
3420000	3422000	middle. I, you know,
3422000	3424000	I don't know, you can't trust that stuff. You just
3424000	3426000	can't. It's all extremes on one end
3426000	3428000	or the other. I don't know. But
3428000	3430000	also, to be fair to harmonics,
3430000	3432000	I mean,
3432000	3434000	is this really the first or the last
3434000	3436000	time this stuff has happened? I don't
3436000	3438000	think it is. I know it's not the
3438000	3440000	first time, and it definitely won't be the last time.
3440000	3442000	Because I know we had stuff,
3442000	3444000	wasn't it actually with a Telltale
3444000	3446000	game that came out? Like, there was some positive
3446000	3448000	reviews on Metacritic or something in the user reviews,
3448000	3450000	I want to say.
3450000	3452000	It was one of the ones that was kind of, was it
3452000	3454000	Jurassic Park? Or one of the ones that wasn't
3454000	3456000	as well received to see others got
3456000	3458000	some review. I don't remember. Don't quote me
3458000	3460000	on that. But it was something out
3460000	3462000	there I seem to remember.
3462000	3464000	Going to our chat room over at
3464000	3466000	live.vog.network.com
3466000	3468000	Tigerhonchat says,
3468000	3470000	it's especially bad if the game a developer worked
3470000	3472000	on was bad from the beginning,
3472000	3474000	and they try to put a positive review on it.
3474000	3476000	Let's see.
3476000	3478000	Bonds006 says, I was waiting for
3478000	3480000	anti-Yelpers.
3480000	3482000	Let's see.
3482000	3484000	Cial says,
3484000	3486000	oh sorry, that was a comment on the
3486000	3488000	last story.
3488000	3490000	Bonds006 also says, so is that
3490000	3492000	a ban hammer or not for in-house
3492000	3494000	workers? Well, you know Amazon's
3494000	3496000	trying to take, because they want
3496000	3498000	their reviews to be taken seriously, Amazon's
3498000	3500000	trying to take steps
3500000	3502000	kind of against that whole thing. Didn't they come out this
3502000	3504000	week and say they were going to sue people that
3504000	3506000	were leaving, like, they were
3506000	3508000	being paid to leave five star
3508000	3510000	reviews on products? I mean,
3510000	3512000	another reason why you can't trust these reviews
3512000	3514000	in the first place. I don't know.
3514000	3516000	I mean, it's not a review, but I know that
3516000	3518000	EA, I think, had told its
3518000	3520000	employees to vote against,
3520000	3522000	it was either EA or
3522000	3524000	Comcast that tried to vote against, you know,
3524000	3526000	them as the worst company in America.
3526000	3528000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
3528000	3530000	Oh, gosh.
3530000	3532000	Uh, yeah.
3532000	3534000	You know, I mean, and getting your employees
3534000	3536000	to vote and your friends and stuff to vote, like,
3536000	3538000	I think here locally, I'm sure every
3538000	3540000	town does this. Don't you have some type
3540000	3542000	of newspaper or TV station
3542000	3544000	that does a best of the town
3544000	3546000	type of competition?
3546000	3548000	Because I know it happens here in Sacramento. There's some type of, like,
3548000	3550000	best of Sacramento. I don't remember who does
3550000	3552000	it. It's one of the local TV stations,
3552000	3554000	I think. And, like, I've actually
3554000	3556000	gotten a little thing with my
3556000	3558000	receipt that says, vote for us
3558000	3560000	in this competition, dah, dah, dah, dah, and go to this
3560000	3562000	website and vote for us so we can win
3562000	3564000	and all this stuff. So, I mean,
3564000	3566000	it's not that different
3566000	3568000	from the podcast awards, all things
3568000	3570000	considered.
3570000	3572000	Anyway.
3572000	3574000	Uh, Brad from Pod
3574000	3576000	Culture, and I think this is probably the right way to do it,
3576000	3578000	says, I always throw out the top
3578000	3580000	and the lowest scores, and I
3580000	3582000	read the middle stuff. It's probably
3582000	3584000	the way to do it. Or, you
3584000	3586000	can really only trust your friends. I think that's
3586000	3588000	another thing for me.
3588000	3590000	We'll get into this topic again a little more
3590000	3592000	later on in our FUGL Question of the Week,
3592000	3594000	but for now, let's move on with some more
3594000	3596000	stories. Loki. Alright.
3596000	3598000	So, Microsoft is gonna focus now
3598000	3600000	on, primarily,
3600000	3602000	Xbox Live usership.
3602000	3604000	And I think the reason for this is because not only
3604000	3606000	do they not
3606000	3608000	gonna be kinda struggling a little bit
3608000	3610000	with console sales, but, hey,
3610000	3612000	Xbox Live, that could be on, you know,
3612000	3614000	Windows and
3614000	3616000	on, you know,
3616000	3618000	the Xbox consoles,
3618000	3620000	maybe even Windows Phone. So, of course,
3620000	3622000	they wanna, you know, strive to have more Xbox
3622000	3624000	Live users, you know,
3624000	3626000	maybe more spending that way,
3626000	3628000	and they don't necessarily need to sell
3628000	3630000	the brand new consoles, because, hey, you have got a lot
3630000	3632000	of people who have Xbox 360s still.
3632000	3634000	You know, I'm actually
3634000	3636000	finding myself in kind of that predicament where
3636000	3638000	it's like, you know, my Xbox Live
3638000	3640000	membership is running up,
3640000	3642000	I think, early next year, and I
3642000	3644000	really haven't played anything on Live
3644000	3646000	that justifies me continuing that, since
3646000	3648000	I don't have an Xbox One, so,
3648000	3650000	I'm probably not.
3650000	3652000	But, yeah,
3652000	3654000	apparently, they're saying that
3654000	3656000	they're not using console
3656000	3658000	shipments as their primary metric
3658000	3660000	for success, but they've,
3660000	3662000	they're focusing more on
3662000	3664000	engagement, leading to choose
3664000	3666000	Xbox Live usership as its
3666000	3668000	statistic for that,
3668000	3670000	and basically indicating that
3670000	3672000	they have 39 million Xbox Live
3672000	3674000	users right now.
3674000	3676000	And they're trying to get it up.
3676000	3678000	Usership, I guess, up is
3678000	3680000	up 28%.
3680000	3682000	Well, I suppose this is a nice
3682000	3684000	way to put a spin on a situation
3684000	3686000	that otherwise might not
3686000	3688000	be all good news for Microsoft.
3688000	3690000	I mean, maybe they're kind of,
3690000	3692000	this sounds to me like,
3692000	3694000	and you might disagree, but it just kind of sounds
3694000	3696000	to me like they're just kind of,
3696000	3698000	I don't want to say throwing in the towel, but they're kind
3698000	3700000	of admitting that if they keep
3700000	3702000	comparing themselves to Sony PlayStation
3702000	3704000	numbers, that number is looking
3704000	3706000	more and more insurmountable. Or maybe, like,
3706000	3708000	maybe it's just like PR spin
3708000	3710000	for investors type thing, like, oh, well
3710000	3712000	we're not really, it's cool,
3712000	3714000	we're not really competing against you,
3714000	3716000	Nintendo, we're not really competing
3716000	3718000	against you, we're on our own
3718000	3720000	thing, we're just going to look at, you know,
3720000	3722000	Xbox Live usership,
3722000	3724000	which is way higher, because we've got way more people
3724000	3726000	than PlayStation Plus, that's what they're probably
3726000	3728000	looking at. Well, and to
3728000	3730000	be fair, on the flip side, I mean,
3730000	3732000	yeah, they still make
3732000	3734000	quite a bit of money from Xbox
3734000	3736000	Live, I mean, it's what, 50, 60 bucks a year?
3736000	3738000	Well, yeah, and think about, you know,
3738000	3740000	manufacturing consoles. Over five years, that's as much
3740000	3742000	as a console. How much are you making per console? I mean, you're
3742000	3744000	probably losing money on each console, so
3744000	3746000	I mean, yeah, might as well
3746000	3748000	have as much usership as you can.
3748000	3750000	And the other thing, you know, is, I've
3750000	3752000	been reading that they've been pretty
3752000	3754000	shy on talking numbers
3754000	3756000	of units sold, it's
3756000	3758000	more difficult each time
3758000	3760000	when those NPD numbers come out to see
3760000	3762000	what are you guys selling? Interesting.
3762000	3764000	Especially now that the new rules
3764000	3766000	were that I don't think they have to even
3766000	3768000	divulge that stuff. Yeah.
3768000	3770000	An anonymous
3770000	3772000	chat in our chat, 648
3772000	3774000	says, I'm sticking with the PlayStation 4
3774000	3776000	and the PC at this point.
3776000	3778000	Maybe that's what
3778000	3780000	Microsoft needs to do more of, is
3780000	3782000	how to differentiate themselves more
3782000	3784000	from the PlayStation 4, and I guess, I mean,
3784000	3786000	to be fair, I do feel like that's been
3786000	3788000	a big tone of theirs this year, is really
3788000	3790000	pushing those exclusive
3790000	3792000	games that are only going to
3792000	3794000	be on Xbox One this holiday, like
3794000	3796000	you know, the
3796000	3798000	Rare Replay and
3798000	3800000	Tomb Raider and
3800000	3802000	Halo 5, I keep wanting to say Crackdown
3802000	3804000	but that got pushed back, so not
3804000	3806000	Crackdown, but you know,
3806000	3808000	Gears of War, that whole thing.
3808000	3810000	So, you know, that's what
3810000	3812000	Microsoft's kind of trying to do, is how to differentiate
3812000	3814000	themselves. To be fair, their lineup for first party
3814000	3816000	titles is way better than Sony's right now.
3816000	3818000	I mean, that's just, this holiday
3818000	3820000	they've knocked it out of the park. Sony,
3820000	3822000	nope, they have
3822000	3824000	not. I mean, they have Uncharted, which
3824000	3826000	that's not even coming out this year. The Uncharted
3826000	3828000	Collection, sorry, a collection of old
3828000	3830000	games does not make a blockbuster
3830000	3832000	you know,
3832000	3834000	first party lineup for the holiday. Oh,
3834000	3836000	but you've got those exclusives
3836000	3838000	with Destiny and
3838000	3840000	fucking Call of Duty. I'm sorry, that doesn't
3840000	3842000	sell consoles either.
3842000	3844000	Bonds006
3844000	3846000	in chat says, so these companies who in the past
3846000	3848000	shouted from the hills about
3848000	3850000	MPD stats are now trying to hide
3850000	3852000	underperforming products in a number
3852000	3854000	maze.
3854000	3856000	Let's see, some comments on the Wii U actually
3856000	3858000	in chat, Dungeon Buster saying
3858000	3860000	I haven't really felt compelled to get an Xbox
3860000	3862000	One yet, but I'm actually leaning
3862000	3864000	more towards a Wii U.
3864000	3866000	Well, I don't, you know, again, I
3866000	3868000	think, especially now that we're years
3868000	3870000	into the Wii U's cycle,
3870000	3872000	there's so many games now that
3872000	3874000	you're missing out on. I honestly, if you're thinking
3874000	3876000	about a Wii U, I might still hold off
3876000	3878000	on that, just because, you know,
3878000	3880000	you're going to invest into a Wii U right now, then all
3880000	3882000	of a sudden, oh hey, NX, fuck the Wii
3882000	3884000	U, we're done with that, you know, because I can see
3884000	3886000	that totally happening, and just
3886000	3888000	maybe give it a few more months until we
3888000	3890000	start hearing the E3 news and kind of see what
3890000	3892000	their plan is with that. Wait for a price drop
3892000	3894000	or E3. Because, yeah, because
3894000	3896000	I'm worried that if you jump in right now,
3896000	3898000	eh, I mean, Zelda's
3898000	3900000	going to be cool, and god, I hope it's still coming out in
3900000	3902000	the Wii U, but like, eh,
3902000	3904000	I don't know. They may
3904000	3906000	try to pull that, you know, shit where
3906000	3908000	they did that with, was it the
3908000	3910000	GameCube and the Wii, you know, oh hey,
3910000	3912000	Zelda, it's on the Wii now.
3912000	3914000	Yeah, a lot of people think that could be
3914000	3916000	where it's headed, we'll see.
3916000	3918000	Well, anyhow, Xbox Live, you know,
3918000	3920000	for better or for worse, is a place where,
3920000	3922000	you know, you can get called nasty things
3922000	3924000	by all sorts of strangers, and
3924000	3926000	soon, this could be coming to PC. Okay,
3926000	3928000	it's not really the same thing, it's
3928000	3930000	actually a little bit different, but here's the deal.
3930000	3932000	Blizzard has actually
3932000	3934000	been shown that
3934000	3936000	they are going to be testing some
3936000	3938000	voice chat systems in
3938000	3940000	their Battle.net client.
3940000	3942000	So, right now, voice chat
3942000	3944000	is going to be in beta when Overwatch
3944000	3946000	goes into beta testing, which I
3946000	3948000	believe is in days, I think that
3948000	3950000	is on Tuesday, when the Overwatch
3950000	3952000	beta starts, although
3952000	3954000	really only the people in the super special
3954000	3956000	secret Blizzard club are going to be in that at first,
3956000	3958000	and then they'll start rolling that out to more and more
3958000	3960000	people, I'm sure, as time goes on.
3960000	3962000	So, Overwatch is going to
3962000	3964000	get those betas, that'll start
3964000	3966000	being streamed on Twitch, for sure.
3966000	3968000	That'll be the big, the people that always
3968000	3970000	pimp Blizzard products on Twitch
3970000	3972000	will get those beta keys, so that
3972000	3974000	they start streaming it, and it's all going to be
3974000	3976000	positive, because they're already really into Blizzard stuff.
3976000	3978000	So, that'll, you'll see that on Tuesday,
3978000	3980000	probably.
3980000	3982000	But, anyhow, as part
3982000	3984000	of the Overwatch beta FAQ,
3984000	3986000	Blizzard is calling this new system Battle.net
3986000	3988000	voice chat. So, it's
3988000	3990000	not Overwatch voice chat, it's
3990000	3992000	Battle.net voice chat.
3992000	3994000	And they say, with voice chat still in its early
3994000	3996000	development and testing stages, it's too
3996000	3998000	early to say which Blizzard games will be
3998000	4000000	supported and when. So, that could
4000000	4002000	be very interesting, because, you know, not only will
4002000	4004000	you possibly be able to talk to each
4004000	4006000	other in Overwatch, but you'll
4006000	4008000	be able to, maybe, I would say
4008000	4010000	if it's a Battle.net voice chat
4010000	4012000	thing, maybe you'll be able to talk to somebody
4012000	4014000	in World of Warcraft, while
4014000	4016000	you're playing Diablo, or something like that.
4016000	4018000	You could actually talk across those channels.
4018000	4020000	Now, something to note,
4020000	4022000	is that
4022000	4024000	World of Warcraft did have
4024000	4026000	voice chat in it, I think still does.
4026000	4028000	Nobody used it
4028000	4030000	right after it first came out.
4030000	4032000	And everybody went back to using TeamSpeak
4032000	4034000	and Ventrilo, or Skype
4034000	4036000	even, than using the built-in.
4036000	4038000	Why? Because the options on the
4038000	4040000	built-in voice chat were extremely limiting
4040000	4042000	to the point it was useless.
4042000	4044000	Because you couldn't control volume
4044000	4046000	very well at all. I remember it was very
4046000	4048000	hard to hear. The quality
4048000	4050000	was really bad. I don't know if
4050000	4052000	it was trying to share processing with the
4052000	4054000	game itself, or what, but
4054000	4056000	it just had so many problems.
4056000	4058000	So, I hope if they're building this voice
4058000	4060000	chat into Battle.net, maybe it's
4060000	4062000	running on a separate process,
4062000	4064000	or a separate application.
4064000	4066000	If I'm playing Diablo with
4066000	4068000	say, Shane or somebody
4068000	4070000	over Skype, and
4070000	4072000	we're both on Skype, and playing Diablo,
4072000	4074000	it's fine. It's a great experience.
4074000	4076000	All Blizzard needs to do
4076000	4078000	is to build that Skype-like thing
4078000	4080000	into the Battle.net client, and they'll
4080000	4082000	be fine.
4082000	4084000	But that could be interesting. That could also
4084000	4086000	be very doom-impending
4086000	4088000	for TeamSpeak and
4088000	4090000	Ventrilo type of stuff, if
4090000	4092000	it takes off very well and is of
4092000	4094000	good quality.
4094000	4096000	We'll see.
4096000	4098000	Let's see, going to our chatroom over at
4098000	4100000	live.vognetwork.com
4100000	4102000	bonds006 says, and there goes
4102000	4104000	the already fucked up PC chatrooms, adding
4104000	4106000	voice. I know where that will go.
4106000	4108000	I'm hoping that
4108000	4110000	it's something where you have a lot of control
4110000	4112000	over it, where it's limited to just
4112000	4114000	your friends. Because I would
4114000	4116000	not want to play an Overwatch
4116000	4118000	match at all, and get
4118000	4120000	voice chat. And I have a feeling
4120000	4122000	Blizzard doesn't want to go there with it either, because they know
4122000	4124000	what's going to happen if they just enable voice chat.
4124000	4126000	Because people can be really mean in Heroes
4126000	4128000	of the Storm, for god's sake.
4128000	4130000	God, people are so rude in those
4130000	4132000	types of games sometimes.
4132000	4134000	I can't imagine they're just going to open up
4134000	4136000	voice chat for everybody. But,
4136000	4138000	if I'm in a party, like let's say
4138000	4140000	Grandpa, myself,
4140000	4142000	and Nextifer or something all want to play
4142000	4144000	Heroes of the Storm together, we should be able to
4144000	4146000	hit a button and open up
4146000	4148000	a voice chat channel very easy.
4148000	4150000	Be nice.
4150000	4152000	Anyway.
4152000	4154000	Cial from our chatroom says, third-party chat will
4154000	4156000	never die. I suppose I could
4156000	4158000	see where there's still always kind of a use for a
4158000	4160000	third-party chat. When I'm
4160000	4162000	playing Wii U,
4162000	4164000	if I'm playing Splatoon on Wii U,
4164000	4166000	I still have to use Skype.
4166000	4168000	There's no voice chat there, so
4168000	4170000	I guess that's true. But no, I don't think
4170000	4172000	third-party voice chat will ever die.
4172000	4174000	But it'll take a big hit, I think, if some of
4174000	4176000	these games go to it. I don't know. That's what I think.
4176000	4178000	Anyhow, let's move on. Dark Soccer.
4178000	4180000	Well,
4180000	4182000	this is probably the big reason
4182000	4184000	why we've seen a lot of crackdown on
4184000	4186000	ads for YouTube. You know,
4186000	4188000	why they've really been trying to get rid of the
4188000	4190000	ad blockers and whatnot. Google
4190000	4192000	announced that YouTube
4192000	4194000	Red is coming out, which is an
4194000	4196000	ad-free subscription service
4196000	4198000	for YouTube.
4198000	4200000	It will start on the 28th
4200000	4202000	of October for $9.99
4202000	4204000	a month, and will
4204000	4206000	let you watch YouTube without ads.
4206000	4208000	Meanwhile, some of us
4208000	4210000	who remain unnamed are
4210000	4212000	using the specific
4212000	4214000	ad block for YouTube, and
4214000	4216000	not getting ads either.
4216000	4218000	But they're supposed to be doing a 30-day
4218000	4220000	trial right
4220000	4222000	after it launches, so you can see
4222000	4224000	if you like it.
4226000	4228000	Okay, I mean, you can also play videos
4228000	4230000	in the background while using
4230000	4232000	apps on
4232000	4234000	your smartphone when you're running
4234000	4236000	it through the smartphone app.
4236000	4238000	I think that was a really stupid
4238000	4240000	name to pick, because
4240000	4242000	surely you all know about
4242000	4244000	RedTube.
4244000	4246000	You're pure and innocent. Have you heard about
4246000	4248000	RedTube?
4248000	4250000	No, but there's more
4250000	4252000	cinnamon buns.
4252000	4254000	There are definitely some buns on RedTube,
4254000	4256000	let me tell you. I don't need to know
4256000	4258000	about that, la la la la la. Among other
4258000	4260000	body parts. So I just
4260000	4262000	think that was a really clueless
4262000	4264000	name to pick. But also kind of puts their branding
4264000	4266000	in competition with Brand Red.
4266000	4268000	Oh, I didn't even think about that.
4268000	4270000	Interesting.
4272000	4274000	Well, I've also found
4274000	4276000	it very interesting. I don't know if you guys, either
4276000	4278000	of you, have heard about this. The way they're kind of like
4278000	4280000	strong-arming some of their biggest
4280000	4282000	content creators to basically accept the
4282000	4284000	deal, or if we're
4284000	4286000	going to lock all your videos private
4286000	4288000	and all this shit.
4288000	4290000	I don't know how I feel about
4290000	4292000	that. I feel
4292000	4294000	like because YouTube doesn't have a lot
4294000	4296000	of competition in that space, they can
4296000	4298000	kind of get away with that shit.
4298000	4300000	Because where else are those content creators
4300000	4302000	going to go? Where else are they going to
4302000	4304000	go to put up videos like that
4304000	4306000	on a mass scale to be discovered
4306000	4308000	and make the kind of money they do on YouTube now?
4308000	4310000	And I feel like Google
4310000	4312000	or YouTube kind of knows that
4312000	4314000	and is why they can strong-arm them into
4314000	4316000	this deal, but there's a part of me that feels
4316000	4318000	like, is that
4318000	4320000	totally legal, what they're doing?
4320000	4322000	Aren't they kind of begging to be
4322000	4324000	sued?
4324000	4326000	But they probably
4326000	4328000	can't be because I'm sure
4328000	4330000	part of the agreement you make when you
4330000	4332000	agree to cash the check from YouTube is
4332000	4334000	you're not going to sue us over contract
4334000	4336000	change. The other fun thing too is that they're blocking
4336000	4338000	specific games
4338000	4340000	from YouTube as well. So for example,
4340000	4342000	because these
4342000	4344000	companies, I guess, haven't
4344000	4346000	taken the agreement yet
4346000	4348000	in some Japanese companies, games
4348000	4350000	like Attack on Titan, Hatsune
4350000	4352000	Miku, Project Mirai 2,
4352000	4354000	BlazBlue Chrono Phantasma,
4354000	4356000	they are not able to be seen
4356000	4358000	in the US. Any videos that get
4358000	4360000	content ID matched for those,
4360000	4362000	they are blocked in the US because
4362000	4364000	the companies that make those games
4364000	4366000	have not taken the deal for YouTube
4366000	4368000	Red.
4368000	4370000	I just,
4370000	4372000	how can this be legal?
4372000	4374000	I just still do what the fuck
4374000	4376000	they want. But, you know,
4376000	4378000	and now what's interesting is that, you know, Twitch
4378000	4380000	is making more of a play for the on-demand
4380000	4382000	gaming type of stuff.
4382000	4384000	So, I mean, some of these games I'm sure you could
4384000	4386000	find on Twitch, no problem.
4386000	4388000	I just think it's, like, pretty ballsy of
4388000	4390000	them to say, hey, we're going to offer
4390000	4392000	ad-free, um,
4392000	4394000	ad-free
4394000	4396000	usage for 999 a month and people are like,
4398000	4400000	I just, I've been using
4400000	4402000	an ad block. I don't, maybe
4402000	4404000	it's just me. I, I,
4404000	4406000	would you guys pay for content
4406000	4408000	that you look at on YouTube?
4408000	4410000	Because there's a lot of, and I say, I've
4410000	4412000	created YouTubes
4412000	4414000	and I wouldn't want people to have to pay to watch
4414000	4416000	what I've done. Nope. And, and, and, if they're
4416000	4418000	going to try to do this shit where it's like, hey, this
4418000	4420000	PewDiePie's got a fucking exclusive
4420000	4422000	new video series that's behind
4422000	4424000	this paywall of YouTube Red,
4424000	4426000	I guess I'm just never going to see it
4426000	4428000	because that's what's going to end up happening.
4428000	4430000	Or is someone just going to fucking
4430000	4432000	dump that shit and fucking re-upload it on
4432000	4434000	their channel or, I'm just sorry,
4434000	4436000	it's just, you,
4436000	4438000	you've been giving this out
4438000	4440000	for free for so long,
4440000	4442000	it's going to get pretty hard to give,
4442000	4444000	make people pay for it now.
4444000	4446000	Imagine if Facebook started charging
4446000	4448000	999 a month for, you know,
4448000	4450000	something. Don't start another copy
4450000	4452000	paste post on everybody's wall. I'm just saying,
4452000	4454000	you know, I'm not paying for this.
4454000	4456000	Period. I'm not going to pay for it.
4456000	4458000	If I don't want to watch ads,
4458000	4460000	then I will just use ad block. I would
4460000	4462000	pay for it if there was something worth paying
4462000	4464000	for. I pay for Netflix
4464000	4466000	because they've got some fucking
4466000	4468000	great original series that you can
4468000	4470000	watch very conveniently and easily.
4470000	4472000	Orange is the New Black, I mean, the new
4472000	4474000	season aside, the first two seasons were really good.
4474000	4476000	I, Sense8 was
4476000	4478000	fucking amazing.
4478000	4480000	Gracie and Frankie or whatever that
4480000	4482000	show is called with the broads from 9 to 5.
4482000	4484000	I like that show a lot.
4484000	4486000	And, you know, there's a lot of really
4486000	4488000	good Netflix original stuff, so I
4488000	4490000	don't mind paying for that stuff. But now this pool
4490000	4492000	is getting really diluted because everybody wants
4492000	4494000	money for their content,
4494000	4496000	but it's like, you know, you've got to have
4496000	4498000	really good exclusive content for me.
4498000	4500000	Yeah, exactly. And that's the thing, too, is like...
4500000	4502000	I would not fucking pay for
4502000	4504000	PewDiePie and Tyler
4504000	4506000	Oakley and The Drunk Chef.
4506000	4508000	I'm not going to pay for that.
4508000	4510000	I have no problem with them doing their thing. That's fine.
4510000	4512000	But, like, I'm kind of,
4512000	4514000	I'm not worried for them, but, like, they're
4514000	4516000	literally making it difficult to
4516000	4518000	do their thing on YouTube.
4518000	4520000	Now they're making them sign these deals
4520000	4522000	to be on this, you know, YouTube Red type stuff.
4522000	4524000	Game companies
4524000	4526000	are being blocked from having their content
4526000	4528000	on the service. Other game companies
4528000	4530000	are fucking blocking people from using it
4530000	4532000	or taking their ad revenue because
4532000	4534000	they want to do their shit. It's like, it's
4534000	4536000	getting so fucking complicated.
4536000	4538000	This is great for indies.
4538000	4540000	I'm telling you that much because indie guys are like,
4540000	4542000	what the fuck is going on? Just play my game.
4542000	4544000	I would love it if you played my game. I'm not going to
4544000	4546000	do anything. You play my game? Cool.
4546000	4548000	We're done. That's it. You know what would have
4548000	4550000	shut YouTube up is if these
4550000	4552000	big creators, their bread
4552000	4554000	and butter, the creators,
4554000	4556000	had banded together and said,
4556000	4558000	no, shove it.
4558000	4560000	Like, we're going to go to this
4560000	4562000	other site unless you give us
4562000	4564000	a better deal type of thing or, you know, you give
4564000	4566000	the user more freedom. They really should have, but unfortunately
4566000	4568000	that didn't happen. We're going to go to this other site.
4568000	4570000	Which site? Yeah, which site?
4570000	4572000	Somebody in chat said Daily Motion, but it's just,
4572000	4574000	I know that's a video site, but it's not, you know,
4574000	4576000	I don't know, it's not the kind of thing, but now is the time
4576000	4578000	for those types of sites to strike.
4578000	4580000	Somebody could make,
4580000	4582000	you know, these big creators an offer
4582000	4584000	and possibly siphon some of the content. But the Content ID,
4584000	4586000	though, it's just, it's greed by this publisher,
4586000	4588000	by these publishers. I mean,
4588000	4590000	and don't get me wrong, I think it's cool to
4590000	4592000	protect artists' rights
4592000	4594000	and stuff like that, but that's not what they're doing.
4594000	4596000	They're just protecting publisher
4596000	4598000	rights and wanting to be able to
4598000	4600000	sell that content at a premium.
4600000	4602000	Instead of like, hey,
4602000	4604000	this song was licensed for this video game
4604000	4606000	and it just happens to be in the background
4606000	4608000	of this video of the video game because
4608000	4610000	it's part of the video game.
4610000	4612000	Oh, but let's copyright strike these because
4612000	4614000	god damn it, you didn't license that
4614000	4616000	song to be played on your channel.
4616000	4618000	It's way too complicated. It shouldn't be this complicated.
4618000	4620000	Bonds006 in chat says,
4620000	4622000	the companies that once all supported
4622000	4624000	CISPA are now getting forced to
4624000	4626000	their knees by YouTube.
4626000	4628000	YouTube will now be the new grandfather
4628000	4630000	of online free media.
4630000	4632000	So.
4632000	4634000	Bonds006 says
4634000	4636000	YouTube already has them by the balls. It's YouTube's way
4636000	4638000	to get the fuck out. And I know I've called this out
4638000	4640000	before, as I'm sure a lot of you guys have too,
4640000	4642000	as part of the problem with YouTube
4642000	4644000	is that there isn't, this is why
4644000	4646000	competition, and I'm not usually
4646000	4648000	the type to get up there and go like
4648000	4650000	rah rah rah capitalism.
4650000	4652000	But in this such
4652000	4654000	of a narrow, and don't get me started on political
4654000	4656000	stuff, don't read too much into what I just said.
4656000	4658000	When we don't have
4658000	4660000	any type of competitor for YouTube
4660000	4662000	that competes with them on that level,
4662000	4664000	this is what happens.
4664000	4666000	You know what I mean? Like this is why there needs
4666000	4668000	to be that type of competition and this is why
4668000	4670000	and I've kind of said this about
4670000	4672000	Twitch too, right? Twitch was so
4672000	4674000	dominant that, you know, when
4674000	4676000	their rules went into place, they needed some competition
4676000	4678000	to get them worried. Enter YouTube,
4678000	4680000	ironically enough,
4680000	4682000	to kind of mix that up a little bit. And I think
4682000	4684000	really, based on what we've been hearing out of TwitchCon
4684000	4686000	TwitchCon and all this stuff, it's making Twitch
4686000	4688000	better, because they're having to
4688000	4690000	you know, make sure that they involve themselves
4690000	4692000	to make themselves the better option. And I
4692000	4694000	really want to see the same thing happen to YouTube.
4694000	4696000	And from a gaming standpoint, maybe
4696000	4698000	that will happen, is that these games that are blocked
4698000	4700000	from YouTube, well shit on the PlayStation 4,
4700000	4702000	you're one button press from going over to Twitch.
4702000	4704000	Well it's just like the YouTube gaming stuff.
4704000	4706000	I've never launched the YouTube gaming app.
4706000	4708000	I don't fucking care.
4708000	4710000	I can find gaming videos just fine on YouTube.
4710000	4712000	Like,
4712000	4714000	how could you not find gaming videos
4714000	4716000	on YouTube? That's impossible.
4716000	4718000	I don't understand
4718000	4720000	how people are having such a difficult
4720000	4722000	time in finding gaming videos
4722000	4724000	that they need to create a separate app for that.
4724000	4726000	It's just like,
4726000	4728000	I don't get it. It's like,
4728000	4730000	shit, I can't find any cat pictures
4730000	4732000	on Reddit. If only we had a separate
4732000	4734000	Reddit for cats.
4734000	4736000	I think there is a separate Reddit for cats.
4736000	4738000	I'm sure there is, but I'm just saying that
4738000	4740000	it's impossible to not
4740000	4742000	like, this was never, you
4742000	4744000	came up with a solution for a problem that didn't
4744000	4746000	exist, is what it is.
4748000	4750000	Isn't that called capitalism?
4750000	4752000	It's not capitalism.
4752000	4754000	It's just, it's useless.
4754000	4756000	It's just like, the whole thing was that they were trying to compete with Twitch.
4756000	4758000	Just like capitalism. I would say
4758000	4760000	that's more the other extreme end
4760000	4762000	of it, right? When the corporations are people,
4762000	4764000	right? We know what you want.
4764000	4766000	How many times has
4766000	4768000	that been nails on a chalkboard to you?
4768000	4770000	When a gaming company gets up there and goes,
4770000	4772000	this is what the gamers want.
4772000	4774000	They want microtransactions and all this other stuff,
4774000	4776000	and you're like, fuck a whole lot of you.
4776000	4778000	Because that's so, like you're
4778000	4780000	sitting there going, no, it is not what I want, actually.
4780000	4782000	What gamers want is for you to get your head out of your
4782000	4784000	ass and actually look around.
4784000	4786000	The fucking end.
4786000	4788000	It's not about what you want, it's about what we
4788000	4790000	want. And if we don't want what you're
4790000	4792000	doing, we're gonna go somewhere else. And you know what
4792000	4794000	gamers want? Fuckery.
4794000	4796000	Another fucking Super Mario RPG.
4796000	4798000	That is what gamers want.
4798000	4800000	So if that is not what you're
4800000	4802000	bringing me, get off the stage.
4802000	4804000	You know what we want?
4804000	4806000	What? Zillion three.
4810000	4812000	What do we want?
4812000	4814000	Guardian Legends sequel. When do we want it?
4814000	4816000	Now. Yesterday.
4818000	4820000	SSG100 Matt says, someone
4820000	4822000	needs the capital and the infrastructure to handle
4822000	4824000	a massive amount of data like YouTube.
4824000	4826000	On top of that, said business
4826000	4828000	needs to find profit in that.
4828000	4830000	Where is the immediate profit in a YouTube competitor?
4830000	4832000	You know what though, guys?
4832000	4834000	YouTube
4834000	4836000	didn't start in a day
4836000	4838000	and Facebook started somewhere.
4838000	4840000	And MySpace looked like
4840000	4842000	it was never gonna go away. You know who's evil enough to compete
4842000	4844000	with Google? Facebook.
4844000	4846000	They've got the capital,
4846000	4848000	they've got the resources. Unfortunately
4848000	4850000	it wouldn't be very good, but
4850000	4852000	I'll take competitors
4852000	4854000	as long as they're competing. Maybe that'll fix
4854000	4856000	something.
4856000	4858000	Alright.
4858000	4860000	Anyhow, let's move on. Maybe they
4860000	4862000	can come up with their own service and they'll be called
4862000	4864000	F-Tube.
4864000	4866000	Yeah?
4866000	4868000	Yeah, F-Tube?
4870000	4872000	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some
4872000	4874000	release dates and some video games that you
4874000	4876000	may or may not be streaming to YouTube, but pretty soon.
4876000	4878000	Release dates for games.
4878000	4880000	Loki. Starting in the US.
4880000	4882000	So this week we've got
4882000	4884000	Divinity Original Sin Enhanced Edition
4884000	4886000	coming out on Playstation 4 and
4886000	4888000	Xbox One.
4888000	4890000	A game called Halo 5 Guardians.
4890000	4892000	That's coming out on Xbox
4892000	4894000	One this week. Also the Limited
4894000	4896000	Edition. Fuck, is that
4896000	4898000	really this week? That is this week.
4898000	4900000	That is Tuesday. I feel
4900000	4902000	like I have to
4902000	4904000	buy it, but I don't
4904000	4906000	want to because I've got all these other games I need to be.
4906000	4908000	Then don't buy it right now. But it's Halo.
4908000	4910000	You can buy it, just not right now.
4910000	4912000	I gotta...
4912000	4914000	I need it.
4914000	4916000	What kind of gamer am I
4916000	4918000	if I don't own the newest thing?
4918000	4920000	Rob.
4920000	4922000	Can you eat Halo 5?
4922000	4924000	Can you breathe it?
4924000	4926000	How much barbecue sauce can you
4926000	4928000	drink it? Technically, does it put a roof over your
4928000	4930000	head? Technically, you can
4930000	4932000	eat Halo 5. Oh wait, no, that's Call of Duty
4932000	4934000	Black Ops 3, I'm thinking. Sorry.
4934000	4936000	They're doing a promotion with
4936000	4938000	Carl's Jr. apparently for that.
4938000	4940000	If I duct tape a lot of the discs
4940000	4942000	together, I could make a box
4942000	4944000	to live in out of Halo 5.
4946000	4948000	Don't fucking challenge
4948000	4950000	me, woman. It's not needed for survival.
4950000	4952000	You could hollow out an original Xbox
4952000	4954000	and could have a family of four live in that,
4954000	4956000	but you know, that's not...
4958000	4960000	Anyways, so Minecraft
4960000	4962000	Story Mode, the season pass disc
4962000	4964000	is coming out as well. If you want
4964000	4966000	to just jump into all of
4966000	4968000	those episodes, that's on
4968000	4970000	PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4,
4970000	4972000	Xbox 360, and Xbox One.
4972000	4974000	WWE 2K6
4974000	4976000	coming out on PlayStation 3,
4976000	4978000	Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, and
4978000	4980000	Xbox One as well.
4980000	4982000	Lords
4982000	4984000	of the Fallen complete edition.
4984000	4986000	That'll be the following week, actually.
4986000	4988000	And
4990000	4992000	that'll be it.
4992000	4994000	OK, so Alan Alchemy in chat
4994000	4996000	said I had to show Jamie what he bought
4996000	4998000	this week. Speaking of, I want
4998000	5000000	it. I need it. Look at this.
5000000	5002000	Yeah. Mass Effect Monopoly
5002000	5004000	something he bought this week.
5004000	5006000	Although, doesn't that look like it's based on
5006000	5008000	Mass Effect 2? Kind of. Yeah.
5008000	5010000	But yet, it
5010000	5012000	says copyright 2015, so I guess
5012000	5014000	it's newer. I did miss one. Dark
5014000	5016000	Ciders 2, the definitive
5016000	5018000	edition coming on PlayStation
5018000	5020000	4 and Xbox One.
5020000	5022000	Just in time for Halloween.
5022000	5024000	Also, MX vs ATV Supercross
5024000	5026000	Encore on PlayStation 4.
5026000	5028000	And do you know
5028000	5030000	why he bought Monopoly Mass Effect?
5030000	5032000	Because it was there. Yeah, because he fucking wanted it.
5032000	5034000	Cue the American flag and the theme.
5034000	5036000	I
5036000	5038000	honestly, I knew about it, and
5038000	5040000	I hate playing Monopoly.
5040000	5042000	I really hate playing Monopoly.
5042000	5044000	I don't even play
5044000	5046000	all the five other different collector's
5046000	5048000	versions of Monopoly that we have. Yeah,
5048000	5050000	but this has a space hamster as one of
5050000	5052000	the tokens. You know what?
5052000	5054000	IDGAF.
5054000	5056000	I
5056000	5058000	might have gotten the Mass Effect
5058000	5060000	risk, but
5060000	5062000	I'm not...
5062000	5064000	That's kind of expensive. I didn't
5064000	5066000	care.
5066000	5068000	I'm actually
5068000	5070000	really getting a lot more into Dragon Age
5070000	5072000	than Mass Effect until Andromeda
5072000	5074000	comes out. Until Andromeda's out, yeah.
5074000	5076000	So, I'm content.
5076000	5078000	Fair enough.
5078000	5080000	Alright, let's go over to Japan and check out
5080000	5082000	some of the releases in Japan this week. God Eater
5082000	5084000	Resurrection on the PlayStation 4,
5084000	5086000	a regular and a crossplay pack.
5086000	5088000	Also, NBA 2K16
5088000	5090000	makes its way to Japan, getting
5090000	5092000	its release on the 29th.
5092000	5094000	Heading over to
5094000	5096000	the Wii U, I think, is still kind of
5096000	5098000	dry this week. They get Lego
5098000	5100000	Jurassic World on November 5th, but that's
5100000	5102000	still a couple weeks away. On the
5102000	5104000	Vita this week, I would expect that we'll probably
5104000	5106000	see God Eater over there, too. Yep,
5106000	5108000	we sure do, because that's that crossplay.
5108000	5110000	Alias Carnival, Sacrament
5110000	5112000	is out this week.
5112000	5114000	Heart no Kuni, no Alice Wonderful
5114000	5116000	Twin World, a new version. Also,
5116000	5118000	Love Revenge, regular and
5118000	5120000	limited edition, Raishi,
5120000	5122000	and Yomawari. Those are
5122000	5124000	all Vita releases.
5124000	5126000	More than any other system I'm going to read this week.
5126000	5128000	Like, that was like, what, one, two, three,
5128000	5130000	four, five, six releases
5130000	5132000	on the Vita this week in Japan.
5132000	5134000	It is such a different story.
5134000	5136000	It just blows my mind.
5136000	5138000	On the Nintendo 3DS this week
5138000	5140000	over in Japan,
5140000	5142000	looks like actually nothing
5142000	5144000	on the 3DS this week. There's some new
5144000	5146000	cases, but that's really it.
5146000	5148000	Otherwise, Disney Magic Castles,
5148000	5150000	which you have to look forward to in two weeks.
5150000	5152000	But, you know, they love
5152000	5154000	Disney in Japan almost as much as we
5154000	5156000	love it here, so Disney releases are a pretty big deal
5156000	5158000	over there, too. Alright,
5158000	5160000	let's go to the UK, Dark Sakura.
5160000	5162000	On the 27th, we have Darksiders
5162000	5164000	which is attached to the Death
5164000	5166000	Initive edition.
5166000	5168000	I'm sorry, I'm full of
5168000	5170000	pumpkin cinnamon roll.
5170000	5172000	It's coming on PlayStation 4
5172000	5174000	and Xbox One.
5174000	5176000	We have Halo 5 Guardians for Xbox One
5176000	5178000	and WWE 2K16
5178000	5180000	on everything else.
5180000	5182000	On the 30th, Lands End comes out on
5182000	5184000	Android and Shin Megami Tensei
5184000	5186000	Devil Survivor 2
5186000	5188000	on 3DS.
5188000	5190000	And I'll go ahead and say it on the 31st,
5190000	5192000	we have Five Nights at Freddy's 4, the final
5192000	5194000	chapter.
5194000	5196000	On PC. In the UK.
5196000	5198000	Oh, I was like, wait a minute.
5198000	5200000	I was like, I had to look at it again, because
5200000	5202000	I was like, didn't you guys get that too?
5202000	5204000	I guess not.
5204000	5206000	But don't we get that, isn't that RPG
5206000	5208000	a Halloween thing in the US? I think it is.
5208000	5210000	I felt like that was what was being targeted.
5210000	5212000	Maybe.
5212000	5214000	Alright.
5214000	5216000	This looks like the same shit we got.
5216000	5218000	Alright, well moving on,
5218000	5220000	just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic
5220000	5222000	game of the week.
5222000	5224000	By the way, AkumaJP in chat says
5224000	5226000	I am not kidding. You can get murdered
5226000	5228000	if you say bad things about Disney here.
5228000	5230000	I
5230000	5232000	wish it was like that here.
5232000	5234000	No, I'm just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
5234000	5236000	But, yeah, no,
5236000	5238000	here, here we have to defend
5238000	5240000	ourselves for being big kids
5240000	5242000	when we're too into Disney a little bit.
5242000	5244000	I don't know, I think actually it's a lot less.
5244000	5246000	I think everybody in
5246000	5248000	their 30s and 40s kind of grew up with
5248000	5250000	all that, so it's kind of less
5250000	5252000	than probably what it used to be. Fuck that,
5252000	5254000	I didn't get to.
5254000	5256000	It was still around you.
5256000	5258000	It was on the gummy bears on TV
5258000	5260000	and stuff. But I didn't get to go to Disneyland
5260000	5262000	or Disney World even.
5262000	5264000	And I think, honestly, neither did I.
5264000	5266000	And I did watch Song of the South at least six times in a row
5266000	5268000	as a kid. I think we made up for lost time.
5268000	5270000	I think that's what happened with me in Disneyland.
5270000	5272000	That's what I have a feeling of.
5272000	5274000	And by the way, the reason why I bring that up is because
5274000	5276000	it was in Alabama and we
5276000	5278000	did have Song of the South on
5278000	5280000	VHS. Now
5280000	5282000	that you can't find it at all anywhere.
5282000	5284000	So, of course, I
5284000	5286000	also lived where the Black Cauldron was
5286000	5288000	also banned. Oh
5288000	5290000	jeez, Black Cauldron is like one of those like
5290000	5292000	and it's butchered up anyway. If it had
5292000	5294000	been like the full thing, that
5294000	5296000	would have been badass. Well, it was
5296000	5298000	most of the fairy tales
5298000	5300000	are kind of butchered up. I mean, in Cinderella
5300000	5302000	didn't they chop the
5302000	5304000	superstitious foot off? Yeah, she cut
5304000	5306000	off her toes. Yeah, they didn't do that in Cinderella.
5306000	5308000	But in the Black Cauldron, they actually
5308000	5310000	had more footage
5310000	5312000	that they cut out to make it less
5312000	5314000	dark. And it made
5314000	5316000	the story not make sense. Because Island
5316000	5318000	Wii was great. I thought of you today and I
5318000	5320000	probably shouldn't be saying this now because you'll probably go, gee, thanks
5320000	5322000	for telling me. But I heard that Don Bluth
5322000	5324000	was at some convention here in Sac today. Yeah, I know about that.
5324000	5326000	Okay, you knew. Yeah, it was like Sac Con
5326000	5328000	or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
5328000	5330000	I thought of you when I saw that because I was like
5330000	5332000	what Don Bluth stans do I know? Oh, Jamie.
5332000	5334000	Well, because Don Bluth
5334000	5336000	before he had his major studio
5336000	5338000	animated the
5338000	5340000	Don't Walk Away scene in Xanadu.
5340000	5342000	I should have had a copy of Dragon's
5342000	5344000	Lair autographed. That would have been
5344000	5346000	cool. I would have just taken
5346000	5348000	my copy of Xanadu.
5348000	5350000	Here, sign this.
5350000	5352000	I'm the one that likes it. Legit.
5352000	5354000	Me and three other people.
5354000	5356000	Alright.
5356000	5358000	Let's see. Loki.
5358000	5360000	Alright, so
5360000	5362000	oddly enough
5362000	5364000	Vivendi has been investing
5364000	5366000	quite a bit in Ubisoft.
5366000	5368000	They made, I guess,
5368000	5370000	161 million dollar
5370000	5372000	investment last week and now another
5372000	5374000	111 million dollars
5374000	5376000	this week. And I guess
5376000	5378000	because of that, the
5378000	5380000	stock went up from
5380000	5382000	6.6% to
5382000	5384000	10.39%.
5384000	5386000	But
5386000	5388000	of course, it's kind of making them a little bit
5388000	5390000	uneasy. Basically,
5390000	5392000	the CEO
5392000	5394000	Yiz Gamat
5394000	5396000	basically said that the investment is
5396000	5398000	unsolicited and unwelcome.
5398000	5400000	And, you know, they're
5400000	5402000	not sure what exactly
5402000	5404000	their intention is on purchasing
5404000	5406000	all this stock. It was like a hostile
5406000	5408000	takeover, you know, what the case may be
5408000	5410000	in that. But
5410000	5412000	yeah, interesting to see. I know
5412000	5414000	recently what Activision
5414000	5416000	had to pay a bunch of money just to get rid of
5416000	5418000	Vivendi off of
5418000	5420000	their books, basically.
5420000	5422000	So now the
5422000	5424000	alien is looking for another creature
5424000	5426000	to suck dry.
5426000	5428000	Look out!
5428000	5430000	Alright.
5430000	5432000	One more story for you guys.
5432000	5434000	It's about sports games, which I don't talk about
5434000	5436000	a lot on this show. But, you know,
5436000	5438000	it's an important part of what drives
5438000	5440000	the industry and sells
5440000	5442000	consoles and so forth. And if you weren't
5442000	5444000	aware, there's some really interesting stuff
5444000	5446000	going on in the basketball world.
5446000	5448000	You know, 2K
5448000	5450000	Games makes
5450000	5452000	an NBA series. They have
5452000	5454000	the NBA 2K series.
5454000	5456000	And EA has their own NBA Live series.
5456000	5458000	And if you weren't aware, NBA
5458000	5460000	Live last year was not
5460000	5462000	good. In fact, it was
5462000	5464000	really bad. Well, NBA Live was like
5464000	5466000	postponed for a few years because it
5466000	5468000	originally leaked out even. They put it
5468000	5470000	out and then pulled it back really fast.
5470000	5472000	And someone had bought one of those versions
5472000	5474000	and it was just shit.
5474000	5476000	And then they took a couple years
5476000	5478000	off to fix it and then
5478000	5480000	released it and it was still shit. And then
5480000	5482000	the following year, well, it's better this year.
5482000	5484000	Still shit.
5484000	5486000	Well, both these basketball games came out
5486000	5488000	this past month and
5488000	5490000	NBA 2K actually
5490000	5492000	sold 1 million units.
5492000	5494000	NBA 2K16 sold a million units.
5494000	5496000	It came out in the middle of the month. Biggest
5496000	5498000	selling sports game launch this generation.
5498000	5500000	So, I mean, huge launch.
5500000	5502000	Did very well.
5502000	5504000	EA's NBA Live sold
5504000	5506000	8,000
5506000	5508000	units.
5508000	5510000	Oh, shit. Compared to 1 million.
5510000	5512000	Yeah, that ain't coming back.
5512000	5514000	Only
5514000	5516000	8,000
5516000	5518000	people in the entire
5518000	5520000	country. See, Square Enix, this
5520000	5522000	right here is a disappointment in sales.
5522000	5524000	Not 3 million from Tomb Raider.
5524000	5526000	8,000. You know
5526000	5528000	which game sold more than 8,000
5528000	5530000	units? Earth Defense Force
5530000	5532000	fucking sold more than 8,000 units.
5532000	5534000	I think President Cat sold more
5534000	5536000	units than this game did.
5536000	5538000	That's something.
5538000	5540000	And, you know, if you think about it, like,
5540000	5542000	you know, either
5542000	5544000	it's just that 2K has established themselves
5544000	5546000	as this dominant franchise and people are like,
5546000	5548000	I don't need two basketball games. I got this one.
5548000	5550000	Or, it's just
5550000	5552000	the EA's kind of
5552000	5554000	what the series has done before this.
5554000	5556000	The reputation just, it's ruined.
5556000	5558000	It's absolutely ruined and people don't.
5558000	5560000	And it's bad because NBA 2K, I think, has done some
5560000	5562000	shit recently that's been kind of like,
5562000	5564000	eh, you know.
5564000	5566000	I don't follow too much. I know that
5566000	5568000	they're live scanning. The face scanning
5568000	5570000	thing's not working out, but it never has.
5570000	5572000	I
5572000	5574000	don't know. But, yeah, the point,
5574000	5576000	you only have two options, really.
5576000	5578000	I think they should just get, I don't
5578000	5580000	know how long into that exclusive deal that
5580000	5582000	NBA, or, I don't even
5582000	5584000	know if NBA works that way if they have, like, an
5584000	5586000	exclusive deal between those two companies or if
5586000	5588000	other companies can make NBA games.
5588000	5590000	I hope that they didn't pay for a long
5590000	5592000	licensing
5592000	5594000	period because, eh, it's not going to work out.
5594000	5596000	Well, but, you know, they're swimming
5596000	5598000	in buckets of money because of Madden, so.
5598000	5600000	Well, yeah, but, I mean, they could be
5600000	5602000	having more buckets of money if their game didn't
5602000	5604000	suck.
5604000	5606000	That is very true.
5606000	5608000	Alright. Let's
5608000	5610000	take a trip down memory lane, you guys.
5610000	5612000	Dark Soccer's going to step into the gaming vault
5612000	5614000	and find a game
5614000	5616000	that she thinks, hey, you guys should be
5616000	5618000	playing this this week. We're going to go back
5618000	5620000	to a time when the only basketball
5620000	5622000	game that mattered was Double Dribble.
5622000	5624000	And I had low standards. Remember
5624000	5626000	when Konami fucking made
5626000	5628000	games like Double Dribble?
5630000	5632000	Maybe we'll get Double Dribble Pachinko someday.
5632000	5634000	Alright. Moving on,
5634000	5636000	Dark Soccer's going to step into the gaming vault and find a game she
5636000	5638000	thinks, hey, you should play this this week.
5638000	5640000	You, you dumb kid.
5640000	5642000	Alright. What is the classic
5642000	5644000	game of the week, Dark Soccer?
5644000	5646000	Super high impact.
5646000	5648000	Now, I have to say
5648000	5650000	why I picked this game.
5650000	5652000	I was like, did we go all sports ball this week? What happened?
5652000	5654000	My brothers and I played the shit
5654000	5656000	out of this game. And we
5656000	5658000	we would, there's like this little guitar
5658000	5660000	thing that plays after you pick your play.
5660000	5662000	We used to make that sound
5662000	5664000	like we were growling at each other.
5664000	5666000	And we used to try to, like, tackle each other
5666000	5668000	until the other person would explode.
5668000	5670000	This game is so over the top.
5670000	5672000	And it was actually one of the
5672000	5674000	precursors to the NFL
5674000	5676000	Blitz series. You remember how
5676000	5678000	kind of oddball that one was.
5678000	5680000	Anyway, super high
5680000	5682000	impact. It was the sequel
5682000	5684000	to High Impact. This one
5684000	5686000	came out by Midway in 1991.
5686000	5688000	And
5688000	5690000	it was just a football game running
5690000	5692000	on a JAMA harness.
5692000	5694000	And it had one button
5694000	5696000	and an 8-way joystick. Ooh.
5696000	5698000	Um, so anyway, with this
5698000	5700000	particular game, you had
5700000	5702000	a, basically your button
5702000	5704000	was like, your pass, your
5704000	5706000	action, your, all of
5706000	5708000	this, you know, it was the
5708000	5710000	one way to decide what happened. Which I
5710000	5712000	honestly didn't care for that so much on the arcade one.
5712000	5714000	Which I did play that a few times.
5714000	5716000	Um.
5716000	5718000	But the thing about this
5718000	5720000	one, it was just really over
5720000	5722000	the top. Um.
5722000	5724000	You could tackle
5724000	5726000	somebody until they would
5726000	5728000	explode into a mass of body parts.
5728000	5730000	You had
5730000	5732000	the hit meter or something.
5732000	5734000	What was it called? It was
5734000	5736000	the hit-o-meter, the
5736000	5738000	whack-o-meter or something.
5738000	5740000	And so you'd get, uh,
5740000	5742000	like a thumbs up or a
5742000	5744000	you know, a rank like awesome
5744000	5746000	if you sacked somebody
5746000	5748000	badly enough. It was just really over the top.
5748000	5750000	And like,
5750000	5752000	they'd say little insults at each other
5752000	5754000	before each play and everything. It was
5754000	5756000	just, just really a silly
5756000	5758000	game. Um.
5758000	5760000	But it was, actually for me, who's always
5760000	5762000	hated football, it was
5762000	5764000	a fun game. It was just really
5764000	5766000	fun. It was easy to play. You could
5766000	5768000	pick your, your plays and everything.
5768000	5770000	And, now the version that
5770000	5772000	I had was the Super Nintendo
5772000	5774000	version that, in my, and now
5774000	5776000	that I recall this,
5776000	5778000	it really did keep
5778000	5780000	a lot of stuff from the
5780000	5782000	arcade version. Maybe not some of the
5782000	5784000	digitized, uh,
5784000	5786000	characters that were in it.
5786000	5788000	Like some of the pop-up people that would show up.
5788000	5790000	Like the manager or the referee.
5790000	5792000	They were all
5792000	5794000	I switched to the Super Nintendo version.
5794000	5796000	Uh, audio here.
5796000	5798000	They were all like, you know, pixel people. They weren't, you know,
5798000	5800000	actually, uh,
5800000	5802000	rendered. Um, but it
5802000	5804000	really had a lot of the same stuff.
5804000	5806000	It had really clean
5806000	5808000	graphics for a Super Nintendo
5808000	5810000	sports game. And it
5810000	5812000	was pretty fun.
5812000	5814000	See, there's somebody going in
5814000	5816000	until they explode. Um,
5816000	5818000	and then,
5818000	5820000	oh, here's this,
5820000	5822000	this is, it was just a fun game. That's the only thing I can
5822000	5824000	say about it. The Super Nintendo and
5824000	5826000	Genesis version came out
5826000	5828000	in 1993 and
5828000	5830000	it was put out by,
5830000	5832000	you know, I had it in
5832000	5834000	here and I don't have it now.
5834000	5836000	Um, I want to say it was put out by Acclaim.
5836000	5838000	That was it.
5838000	5840000	That's the, what is it called, the hit meter?
5840000	5842000	Yeah. So, um,
5842000	5844000	I'll just leave it there. It, you know,
5844000	5846000	it paved the way for the NFL Blitz
5846000	5848000	series, which was, you know, another one
5848000	5850000	in the same line. And
5850000	5852000	that's it.
5852000	5854000	We just don't have
5854000	5856000	fun games like that. You know, sports games
5856000	5858000	like that. They all take themselves too seriously.
5858000	5860000	We need more sports games where people explode into body parts.
5860000	5862000	Exactly, or you get
5862000	5864000	something else. Or like in Blades
5864000	5866000	of Steel where it was all about the fighting
5866000	5868000	sub-game where two people get in a fight. You need
5868000	5870000	the over the top, I mean, like now what we
5870000	5872000	have, Mutant League and what was the
5872000	5874000	other football game that's out on Steam right
5874000	5876000	now? Um, you know,
5876000	5878000	they just don't have that fun anymore.
5878000	5880000	Right.
5880000	5882000	Alright there, touchdown!
5882000	5884000	But that's
5884000	5886000	the SNES version. It has all the same stuff
5886000	5888000	from the arcade version. Yeah. Um,
5888000	5890000	you know, a little, a little,
5890000	5892000	uh, I'd say, uh,
5892000	5894000	panned down, but not, you know, not that bad.
5894000	5896000	And the sad thing is, is that, I
5896000	5898000	tried to find more information about
5898000	5900000	this game and it really, I guess,
5900000	5902000	kind of fell off into obscurity.
5902000	5904000	Um, not too many people, I guess,
5904000	5906000	cared about it. But for me,
5906000	5908000	like I said, I hate football.
5908000	5910000	I hate football games. I love this fucking
5910000	5912000	game. So, that's it.
5912000	5914000	Uh, super high impact. There it is, your
5914000	5916000	classic game of the week. Super high impact.
5916000	5918000	Uh, Dark Tetsuya's Blitz is definitely one of my
5918000	5920000	favorite sports games ever. As
5920000	5922000	200 Matt says, super high impact is the XFL
5922000	5924000	of football games. Yes!
5924000	5926000	Without being a bad business
5926000	5928000	decision.
5928000	5930000	Alright.
5930000	5932000	Well that is gonna do it
5932000	5934000	for this first part of, uh,
5934000	5936000	Orange Lounge Radio. But don't go anywhere
5936000	5938000	guys, cause we have plenty more show to come
5938000	5940000	including, uh, your football question of
5940000	5942000	the week, your phone call is
5942000	5944000	1-877-GAME-OLR or
5944000	5946000	username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
5946000	5948000	We're gonna talk about rapid fire news
5948000	5950000	tonight, uh, some LucasArts,
5950000	5952000	some Grand Theft Auto, and some beer.
5952000	5954000	We'll do all of that when we come
5954000	5956000	back with more after this break of
5956000	5958000	Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.
5964000	5966000	Welcome back everybody
5966000	5968000	to Orange Lounge Radio
5968000	5970000	Live tonight, October
5970000	5972000	the 25th of 2015 with episode
5972000	5974000	619 of our show
5974000	5976000	already in progress. We're gonna get back
5976000	5978000	into some news here, uh, in a bit.
5978000	5980000	First though, I thought, uh, I thought you guys would get
5980000	5982000	a kick out of, um, my story about
5982000	5984000	what I did yesterday. So I went on
5984000	5986000	another, uh, adventure with my
5986000	5988000	friend Shane, which, you know, he's been on the show
5988000	5990000	before. He's not here this week, but he was on the past couple weeks.
5990000	5992000	And, uh, we decided randomly, we were
5992000	5994000	gonna take a trip to Chico yesterday, which, um,
5994000	5996000	Chico's a town, it's a college town, it's
5996000	5998000	about two hours north of here where we tape our show
5998000	6000000	in Sacramento. And I actually lived
6000000	6002000	there for like three years, cause I went to school at Chico
6002000	6004000	State. And, um, that's actually
6004000	6006000	where the radio station there was where I first
6006000	6008000	got into this whole thing. So, uh, there's that.
6008000	6010000	But, uh, we went there
6010000	6012000	for a couple reasons. A,
6012000	6014000	I wanted Mongolian
6014000	6016000	BBQ at a place up there I hadn't
6016000	6018000	eaten at in like over a decade.
6018000	6020000	And it's still as good as I remember it, just for the record.
6020000	6022000	Um, so it was totally
6022000	6024000	worth it. Uh, and then B,
6024000	6026000	uh, we thought we'd do some
6026000	6028000	Ingress up there cause I wanted some
6028000	6030000	unique portals from places I hadn't been yet
6030000	6032000	and Shane is playing more and more.
6032000	6034000	So we decided to go play at a graveyard over there.
6034000	6036000	But C, the most important
6036000	6038000	uh, thing is that we were also
6038000	6040000	uh, kinda doing some of the shopping.
6040000	6042000	Uh, cause you know, uh, Shane
6042000	6044000	he's talked about his Power Ranger
6044000	6046000	uh, addiction here on the show
6046000	6048000	and the toys and stuff that he buys with that.
6048000	6050000	Um, and so we had not
6050000	6052000	gone to the stores in Yuba City, which is
6052000	6054000	on the way. Yuba City's like halfway there. And then
6054000	6056000	Chico is like fully north. So we went to the store
6056000	6058000	in Yuba City in Chico. And
6058000	6060000	uh, there's something about that Toys R Us
6060000	6062000	in Chico. I don't know if we happen to have any listeners
6062000	6064000	up there, but I gotta say that Toys R Us is like
6064000	6066000	trapped in a time machine somehow.
6066000	6068000	And Shane got really excited when he saw
6068000	6070000	that at this Toys R Us
6070000	6072000	they still had like in their
6072000	6074000	aisle with video games. Like had the
6074000	6076000	PS4 games. They had like the laminated
6076000	6078000	one sheet. And you'd have to
6078000	6080000	take the pull slip if you wanted the game
6080000	6082000	and actually go take it up to the front
6082000	6084000	counter cause I don't know how long
6084000	6086000	the Toys R Us got rid of that. But for some
6086000	6088000	reason the store that's trapped in time
6088000	6090000	still had that. And on top of
6090000	6092000	all that stuff, believe it or not, they had
6092000	6094000	one of the toys that Shane was missing
6094000	6096000	at this Toys R Us that time
6096000	6098000	forgot two hours north of
6098000	6100000	Major Metropolis. So you better take me
6100000	6102000	there. And they had
6102000	6104000	tons of amiibo. That's where I saw
6104000	6106000	the Animal Crossing amiibo cards. I was like
6106000	6108000	should I get some for Jamie cause
6108000	6110000	I'm not gonna play that game. And then I
6110000	6112000	just saw, I saw like
6112000	6114000	easily like 40 Shulk amiibo.
6114000	6116000	I mean I already have one at this point but
6116000	6118000	there was easily like 40 Shulk amiibo
6118000	6120000	like in all the I guess
6120000	6122000	Toys R Us. Why didn't you bring me one? I didn't know
6122000	6124000	you wanted one. I kind of
6124000	6126000	don't wanna buy one. There you go.
6126000	6128000	I did and
6128000	6130000	bring you back to video games. I did end up
6130000	6132000	getting amiibo for myself. So I got
6132000	6134000	the blue and pink yarn Yoshi
6134000	6136000	to finish my collections. I have all three yarn
6136000	6138000	Yoshis cause they're kinda cute.
6138000	6140000	And I finally got an adult link
6140000	6142000	cause believe it or not I didn't have one cause
6142000	6144000	I was really mad at amiibo when they first came out.
6144000	6146000	And now that I'm finally getting over it
6146000	6148000	I wanted to go back and get some of the ones
6148000	6150000	I missed out on. So I actually found
6150000	6152000	a link thank God still
6152000	6154000	at one of these stores that time forgot so I was able to
6154000	6156000	buy it. So there you go.
6156000	6158000	Going to our chatroom
6158000	6160000	over at live.vognetwork.com
6160000	6162000	Tigerclaw in chat says
6162000	6164000	speaking of Power Rangers, the Power Rangers movie
6164000	6166000	just cast an Asian actor as the Black Ranger
6166000	6168000	and a Black actor for the Blue Ranger.
6168000	6170000	I think yeah, I think they're
6170000	6172000	trying to be kinda diverse in their casting
6172000	6174000	of the folks which is cool.
6174000	6176000	I think kids want to see themselves represented
6176000	6178000	in the Power Rangers so why not?
6178000	6180000	Sounds fun.
6180000	6182000	Let's see. Also going to
6182000	6184000	chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com
6184000	6186000	I think they're just talking about
6186000	6188000	amiibo in chatroom
6188000	6190000	and finding the different amiibo out there.
6190000	6192000	Somebody recommending that PodCulture
6192000	6194000	joins a local amiibo group.
6194000	6196000	Brad from PodCulture
6196000	6198000	saying he just picked up a link online.
6198000	6200000	Is that local group like an
6200000	6202000	amiibo anonymous?
6202000	6204000	Yeah, amiibo addicts anonymous. Something like that.
6204000	6206000	Probably.
6206000	6208000	I guess I need to join. I think I'm up to
6208000	6210000	37 amiibo. It's pretty gross.
6210000	6212000	Like, Loki, you could bring your Wii U
6212000	6214000	back and I would have more stuff for you to
6214000	6216000	unlock. Yeah, I haven't
6216000	6218000	played Mario Maker this week.
6218000	6220000	I need to bring yours over to my house, Rob.
6220000	6222000	Yeah? Yeah. I can do that.
6222000	6224000	Please do that and then we can hang out. There we go.
6224000	6226000	It'll be fun. I just need a carrying case.
6226000	6228000	And of course, I'll leave it to Bobby Blackwolf
6228000	6230000	to storm into the chatroom and make the
6230000	6232000	mandatory comment that goes with that.
6232000	6234000	37 amiibo? In a row?
6236000	6238000	You know what's sad is that
6238000	6240000	reference is getting more and more dated.
6240000	6242000	Didn't that movie come out in like 1997
6242000	6244000	or something? Like, it's...
6244000	6246000	That reference is getting dated.
6246000	6248000	Don't buy any amiibo on the way out.
6250000	6252000	Oh god, it was 1994.
6252000	6254000	Try not to
6254000	6256000	buy any amiibo on your way out to the parking lot.
6258000	6260000	Alright, let's go over some
6260000	6262000	rapid fire news.
6262000	6264000	Some quick gaming headlines this week. Loki.
6264000	6266000	So this actually made me pretty excited.
6266000	6268000	The fact that they're going to be bringing back
6268000	6270000	Day of the Tentacle, which I think was one of the
6270000	6272000	greatest LucasArts
6272000	6274000	games that they kind of
6274000	6276000	did a sequel to, you know, kind of when they started
6276000	6278000	doing the new games.
6278000	6280000	I love that game. And actually, the...
6280000	6282000	Not really a remake.
6282000	6284000	I guess it's more of a remaster.
6284000	6286000	The remaster looks nice. There's not a whole
6286000	6288000	ton of difference other than it's not pixelated.
6288000	6290000	So, I mean,
6290000	6292000	it's a good game, so I definitely would recommend
6292000	6294000	checking it out when it comes out.
6294000	6296000	They don't really have a
6296000	6298000	date yet when it's coming out, but apparently
6298000	6300000	you would have been able to check it out earlier
6300000	6302000	this week, or last week,
6302000	6304000	during Indicade, which was at
6304000	6306000	LA, and they were running a
6306000	6308000	preview build of that, so...
6308000	6310000	Pretty cool. And I'll be coming out
6310000	6312000	later on. And then
6312000	6314000	with this, Rockstar
6314000	6316000	is adding some new
6316000	6318000	modes to Grand Theft Auto online,
6318000	6320000	including their Lowrider
6320000	6322000	update, which
6322000	6324000	allows you to do all sorts of cool customization
6324000	6326000	of Lowriders and stuff. It's starting
6326000	6328000	to get to
6328000	6330000	kind of what they had in San Andreas,
6330000	6332000	where you can do all the
6332000	6334000	different
6334000	6336000	hydraulics and that kind of fun stuff.
6336000	6338000	But they're going to be
6338000	6340000	adding some new adversaries.
6340000	6342000	I guess
6342000	6344000	Keep the Pace
6344000	6346000	is a new game. I guess it's sort of similar
6346000	6348000	to Speed, the movie, where
6348000	6350000	you have to stay above the minimum velocity or you
6350000	6352000	explode, which is awesome.
6352000	6354000	Offense Defense, which is an
6354000	6356000	asymmetrical mode, with people
6356000	6358000	running towards the end of a route, while
6358000	6360000	protectors are trying to stop them.
6360000	6362000	That kind of sounds actually
6362000	6364000	like the...
6364000	6366000	What was that one that... It was like the...
6366000	6368000	The jet game
6368000	6370000	we played in there was really fun, where
6370000	6372000	there's... That was one of my favorite
6372000	6374000	modes in Grand Theft Auto online.
6374000	6376000	I can't remember what the hell it's called now, but
6376000	6378000	you have people running
6378000	6380000	to get to the end of this
6380000	6382000	checkpoint, and there's
6382000	6384000	people in jets firing at you.
6384000	6386000	It's awesome. It's so
6386000	6388000	intense. I really need to go back and play
6388000	6390000	that. And then, of course, they also
6390000	6392000	have a new scene creator with
6392000	6394000	Rockstar Editor. It allows you to set
6394000	6396000	up different scenarios. You can place props
6396000	6398000	from a catalog of more than 200, and
6398000	6400000	save four settings for
6400000	6402000	different scenes and stuff
6402000	6404000	like that. So, awesome.
6404000	6406000	Have that check it out.
6406000	6408000	And let's see...
6408000	6410000	Last but not least, Tony Hawk,
6410000	6412000	Pro Skater 5. What a mess that
6412000	6414000	shit was. And you may
6414000	6416000	remember that it's also supposed to be coming out
6416000	6418000	on the last gen systems.
6418000	6420000	Supposed to have been sometime
6420000	6422000	in November. However,
6422000	6424000	they're putting it on an
6424000	6426000	indefinite hold. Maybe
6426000	6428000	because they're making their money
6428000	6430000	back with that game, and
6430000	6432000	they're saying, we're working closely with
6432000	6434000	our developers to address the issues identified
6434000	6436000	by the community, like everything.
6436000	6438000	Our development resources
6438000	6440000	are fully focused on fixing the content
6440000	6442000	updates for PlayStation 4 and
6442000	6444000	Xbox One, so we have decided to delay the
6444000	6446000	release of the PlayStation 3 and
6446000	6448000	Xbox 360 versions. Yeah, probably because your
6448000	6450000	game's still broken, so you probably want to fix it before you
6450000	6452000	put out the game.
6452000	6454000	We will update the community when we have more information
6454000	6456000	about the release date. If there's a release date.
6456000	6458000	I don't think there's much of a point at this point
6458000	6460000	to releasing the last gen. I don't think
6460000	6462000	they're going to release it. Yeah, I think it's going to go the way
6462000	6464000	the Mortal Kombat had to do the same thing.
6464000	6466000	Mortal Kombat was a fine game.
6466000	6468000	Yeah, it was fine.
6468000	6470000	They had to
6470000	6472000	compromise too much to get it to run on the old
6472000	6474000	systems, I bet. Anyhow,
6474000	6476000	speaking of having to compromise some things
6476000	6478000	to get it to work, Batman
6478000	6480000	Arkham Knight on the PC.
6480000	6482000	It's finally happening. That's right.
6482000	6484000	Batman Arkham Knight on the
6484000	6486000	PC coming out on October
6486000	6488000	28th. That will be at 10 AM Pacific
6488000	6490000	time, re-released for the
6490000	6492000	PC. There will also be a patch at that time
6492000	6494000	that brings the PC version fully up to
6494000	6496000	date with content that has been released
6496000	6498000	for console, with the exception of any
6498000	6500000	console exclusives.
6500000	6502000	So, that only took, what, like
6502000	6504000	four months for them to fix all the issues?
6504000	6506000	So, hmm.
6506000	6508000	Well, at least they fixed it,
6508000	6510000	I guess. Better late than never.
6510000	6512000	Hey, as we mentioned in the top
6512000	6514000	of the show, in Jason's intro,
6514000	6516000	Back to the Future week was this week, and there
6516000	6518000	was some little things that
6518000	6520000	happened in celebration on the 21st,
6520000	6522000	including in Rocket League,
6522000	6524000	which I always forget to mention
6524000	6526000	this in my gaming week, but usually once a week
6526000	6528000	I get invited to play in some Rocket League game,
6528000	6530000	just randomly online, and that game is
6530000	6532000	always a lot of fun. And so
6532000	6534000	in Rocket League, there is a
6534000	6536000	DeLorean that you can now drive
6536000	6538000	around in the game. It's available
6538000	6540000	for $1.99 on Steam
6540000	6542000	and the PlayStation 4.
6542000	6544000	The tires apparently flip up in
6544000	6546000	the car as well, so that's
6546000	6548000	cute. Also,
6548000	6550000	you may remember there was a
6550000	6552000	reference to the game Wild Gunman.
6552000	6554000	You remember that game was one of the
6554000	6556000	laser games? That was actually in
6556000	6558000	Back to the Future Part II, because it was
6558000	6560000	something that, as part of the plot,
6560000	6562000	Marty kicked ass
6562000	6564000	at the game. Yeah, Cafe 80s, right?
6564000	6566000	So they actually,
6566000	6568000	in a tongue-in-cheek sort of way,
6568000	6570000	in Europe, they released
6570000	6572000	the Wild Gunman
6572000	6574000	version to
6574000	6576000	Wii U Virtual Console in Europe. I don't know why
6576000	6578000	we didn't get it here, but they got it over
6578000	6580000	there in Europe. Dude, it would be awesome if they made
6580000	6582000	a Cafe 80s in that style
6582000	6584000	of Back to the Future II, just like all that
6584000	6586000	retro futuristic shit. Patent
6586000	6588000	pending. That would be awesome. Don't we
6588000	6590000	have that in the form of coin-op downtown
6590000	6592000	except a bar? No, but I'm talking about
6592000	6594000	with the fucking TV monitors and shit
6594000	6596000	with fucking Ronald Reagan. Loki won't say
6596000	6598000	that he wants the fashion.
6598000	6600000	He wants the fashion from Cafe
6600000	6602000	80s. You know who does not?
6602000	6604000	Me, because I paid a lot of money in
6604000	6606000	Aquanet, okay? Hey, but
6606000	6608000	hey, you can buy those Nike shoes soon
6608000	6610000	for $9,000. Yeah, fuck that.
6610000	6612000	No one's buying that shit.
6612000	6614000	Well, it'll be a lot cheaper
6614000	6616000	to get a hoverboard in
6616000	6618000	Star Trek Online, that is.
6618000	6620000	Unfortunately, it's only until October 26th.
6620000	6622000	I don't know why this is a limited time thing,
6622000	6624000	but just before they roll out season
6624000	6626000	11 in Star Trek Online,
6626000	6628000	you can get a hoverboard.
6628000	6630000	That's totally not canon.
6630000	6632000	Yeah, I know, but they
6632000	6634000	made it kind of look like it.
6634000	6636000	It says Flyer
6636000	6638000	Future or something on it. They made it
6638000	6640000	just different enough, but I think it's a cute
6640000	6642000	little wink and nod to Back to the Future.
6642000	6644000	So, there it is.
6644000	6646000	So, you can check that out in Star
6646000	6648000	Trek Online, but you better hurry before tomorrow.
6648000	6650000	Alright, also
6650000	6652000	of very important news, you know we gotta
6652000	6654000	update you on Splatfest
6654000	6656000	here at OLR.
6656000	6658000	We don't, because they inform you of that
6658000	6660000	shit every time we fucking log into that game.
6660000	6662000	Well,
6662000	6664000	anyway, the next Splatfest
6664000	6666000	is happening on October 30th,
6666000	6668000	beginning 9 o'clock. I don't know who's gonna
6668000	6670000	play in this, because everybody's gonna be busy on Halloween.
6670000	6672000	But, here it is, you guys.
6672000	6674000	Pirates versus
6674000	6676000	Ninjas.
6676000	6678000	This is, uh, it's a pretty big
6678000	6680000	debate. The epic battle.
6680000	6682000	The battle to end all battles. I can't
6682000	6684000	pick. I don't know which team to pick.
6684000	6686000	I really don't. I'm leaning
6686000	6688000	Team Ninja solely because
6688000	6690000	they have a better color. They have the purple and the ninjas
6690000	6692000	or, I'm sorry, the pirates kind of have that
6692000	6694000	yucky green. But,
6694000	6696000	I do really like to pirate music.
6696000	6698000	So, I feel like, you know, we should show some
6698000	6700000	piracy pride. And Weebl and Bob had the
6700000	6702000	pirate ninja. But you'd like to not get
6702000	6704000	caught by the companies pirating the music
6704000	6706000	so you have to act like a ninja. So you have to act like a ninja
6706000	6708000	when you do it. That's true. That's very true.
6708000	6710000	But, Disney has the Pirates
6710000	6712000	of the Caribbean ride.
6712000	6714000	Then again, there was that movie,
6714000	6716000	Three Ninjas. I don't know. I just, I can't decide.
6716000	6718000	I can't decide.
6718000	6720000	You have to
6720000	6722000	figure out which one's going to be
6722000	6724000	not as popular
6724000	6726000	because the least
6726000	6728000	popular one always wins. Pirates.
6728000	6730000	You think? You think more
6730000	6732000	people will choose ninja? Do you get free t-shirts or anything
6732000	6734000	for these things?
6734000	6736000	In-game. Yeah, but I
6736000	6738000	never received anything for planes.
6738000	6740000	I didn't get a t-shirt that had planes on it.
6740000	6742000	You don't get the t-shirt.
6742000	6744000	Okay, when you do the Splatfest,
6744000	6746000	you have a Splatfest shirt
6746000	6748000	that has the team logo on it
6748000	6750000	or whatever it is. But you have to turn that in
6750000	6752000	when Splatfest is done. And as a reward,
6752000	6754000	depending on how well you did, you get snails
6754000	6756000	which will modify your existing gear to
6756000	6758000	give it more slots and stuff.
6758000	6760000	That's what the Splatfest is for.
6760000	6762000	That's why they do them every other week.
6762000	6764000	Okie doke. Alright.
6764000	6766000	There it is.
6766000	6768000	Alright, and now everybody in chat
6768000	6770000	is telling me which team to pick. You don't own
6770000	6772000	me. You don't run my life.
6772000	6774000	Alright, I'll consider it.
6774000	6776000	Alright, moving on. Dark Saga.
6776000	6778000	Well, we have
6778000	6780000	a thing that
6780000	6782000	I would like to try except it's only in the UK.
6782000	6784000	And that's Fallout Beer.
6784000	6786000	It's going to be available on Amazon
6786000	6788000	UK and
6788000	6790000	the case will go
6790000	6792000	for roughly £30.
6792000	6794000	£29.99.
6794000	6796000	It will be shipping
6796000	6798000	on November 9th.
6798000	6800000	Somebody in the UK better send me some.
6800000	6802000	Even though it is
6802000	6804000	a Pilsner.
6804000	6806000	I will forgive it because I need to try Fallout Beer.
6806000	6808000	And there's a new
6808000	6810000	Bomberman game. And everyone's super excited
6810000	6812000	except it's
6812000	6814000	for cell phone.
6814000	6816000	So, yeah.
6816000	6818000	That's not as exciting but at least
6818000	6820000	it's not another Pachinko machine.
6820000	6822000	Thank you, Konami.
6822000	6824000	I wish Hudson would come back to life.
6824000	6826000	And last but not least, there's a
6826000	6828000	fan mod out there for
6828000	6830000	the new Resident Evil HD.
6830000	6832000	And it brings back the old voice
6832000	6834000	acting. Apparently they had
6834000	6836000	to go through something like
6836000	6838000	over 500 different audio files
6838000	6840000	to find and replace them with the originals.
6840000	6842000	Where's
6842000	6844000	Barry?
6844000	6846000	That's awesome.
6846000	6848000	You were almost a Jill sandwich.
6850000	6852000	That's my favorite.
6852000	6854000	Yeah. I should have brought
6854000	6856000	back that old thing for fortune cookie.
6856000	6858000	You should have but
6858000	6860000	it's alright. You have something Halloween appropriate.
6860000	6862000	It's somewhere. Yeah.
6862000	6864000	Alright. If that is it
6864000	6866000	for rapid fire news, which I believe it is,
6866000	6868000	we are going to get into the
6868000	6870000	Google question of the week.
6870000	6872000	Every week
6872000	6874000	we go to Facebook and we go to
6874000	6876000	Google Plus.
6876000	6878000	And you combine those together, you get
6878000	6880000	FOOGLE.
6880000	6882000	And yes, believe it or not, people are still
6882000	6884000	on Google Plus.
6884000	6886000	Because we do get answers over on Google Plus
6886000	6888000	to our question of the week. And I'm going to start there
6888000	6890000	tonight. Which the question of the week we
6890000	6892000	asked about, you know, it has to do with that whole
6892000	6894000	issue that Dark
6894000	6896000	Soccer brought up earlier where we had some of the
6896000	6898000	nice employees that were leaving reviews
6898000	6900000	on Amazon. But you know,
6900000	6902000	they weren't the first. They're not going to be the last.
6902000	6904000	So we wanted to ask, knowing
6904000	6906000	that the above happens,
6906000	6908000	do you let user reviews sway you
6908000	6910000	one way or another when buying a
6910000	6912000	video game product? What about
6912000	6914000	when compared to critic reviews? Is one or
6914000	6916000	the other both likely to
6916000	6918000	sway you or neither?
6918000	6920000	ActDeft replied and said,
6920000	6922000	wait, people read Amazon
6922000	6924000	product reviews in a serious manner?
6924000	6926000	That's what I said.
6926000	6928000	You know, I do quite often.
6928000	6930000	Especially if I'm buying something or trying to
6930000	6932000	decide between... But when you know this happens,
6932000	6934000	that people are sandbagging the reviews one way or another?
6934000	6936000	Well yes, not if they're sandbagging the reviews.
6936000	6938000	I mean, you can tell.
6938000	6940000	Well, ActDeft continues, for real though, it's all
6940000	6942000	sorts of shady considering that you may not read
6942000	6944000	the reviews, but you'll look at the rating and hit
6944000	6946000	hits and think, this is a good product based
6946000	6948000	on that one. It may be not.
6948000	6950000	Granted, most people that want Rock Band will
6950000	6952000	probably just buy it and ignore the reviews
6952000	6954000	like most people do with any big triple A game.
6954000	6956000	Retertainment says, between
6956000	6958000	fake Amazon reviews, Twitch streamers
6958000	6960000	getting paid off, and newspaper reviewers not
6960000	6962000	playing the game in full before writing a review.
6962000	6964000	Who can you trust? Answer.
6964000	6966000	The fine people at ORL.
6966000	6970000	That's not...
6970000	6972000	That is actually what he typed. ORL.
6972000	6974000	Who's ORL?
6974000	6976000	Or really? Or really?
6976000	6978000	I know that
6978000	6980000	was a typo, but it was an extremely funny one.
6980000	6982000	I'm sorry. When Loki rants about
6982000	6984000	something, you know it's legit.
6984000	6986000	Now when do I get paid? Come on, positive statements
6986000	6988000	of the internet's gotta be worth some internet dollars, right?
6988000	6990000	I'm sorry, but you forfeit
6990000	6992000	the dollars by misspelling the name of the
6992000	6994000	show. I guess this
6994000	6996000	pumpkin cinnamon roll I was gonna pay you with
6996000	6998000	will have to go to somebody else.
6998000	7000000	Sorry. Alright.
7000000	7002000	And lastly, Martin
7002000	7004000	replied over on Google Plus and said,
7004000	7006000	I trust Amazon reviews for physical
7006000	7008000	products, but do not for games.
7008000	7010000	I do trust certain video game reviewers
7010000	7012000	and you get a sense of whether a game is
7012000	7014000	for you from Twitch streamers and
7014000	7016000	quick looks. Alright, let's
7016000	7018000	go over to Facebook where we had quite a few answers.
7018000	7020000	I'm gonna read some here. Alan Alchemy said,
7020000	7022000	I tend to trust aggregates more
7022000	7024000	simply because even if all critics are
7024000	7026000	awful, when 200 of them all lean
7026000	7028000	in the same direction, it's not really a coincidence.
7028000	7030000	When a movie is 8% on
7030000	7032000	Rotten Tomatoes, even if it's a trash genre
7032000	7034000	to begin with, like a teen slasher,
7034000	7036000	I'm not gonna act like it's secretly good and they're
7036000	7038000	all being haters. Then I'll look at the reader
7038000	7040000	review aggregate score and see if they're widely
7040000	7042000	different, or if it's for a niche game I'd probably
7042000	7044000	buy anyway. TigerClaw
7044000	7046000	says, I don't really let critic or user reviews
7046000	7048000	dictate to me whether a product is good or bad.
7048000	7050000	We've all been in situations where a
7050000	7052000	product had great reviews. We had a bad
7052000	7054000	experience with it. Or a product you had a
7054000	7056000	great experience with, but everyone else gave it bad reviews.
7056000	7058000	So it's really up to your decision
7058000	7060000	if you want it that bad. You believe
7060000	7062000	in it, you buy it.
7062000	7064000	Bryce H. says, I don't let user
7064000	7066000	reviews sway me one way or the other. I'd rather
7066000	7068000	try it first hand or watch somebody else.
7068000	7070000	What's bad for one person may be good for
7070000	7072000	another. CriticalMyth
7072000	7074000	says, positive user reviews
7074000	7076000	rarely sway me. Negative
7076000	7078000	user reviews can if they make specific
7078000	7080000	points that touch on items that
7080000	7082000	would affect my enjoyment of the game.
7082000	7084000	Same thing with pro reviews though.
7084000	7086000	Fabrice A. said, I
7086000	7088000	read several reviews from several sources,
7088000	7090000	both user reviews and professional reviews,
7090000	7092000	and then I compare all the pros and cons
7092000	7094000	from every review. That gives me a
7094000	7096000	solid impression of a game.
7096000	7098000	Andy R. says, I tend to trust critic reviews
7098000	7100000	a slight bit above user reviews, but
7100000	7102000	at this point I've been around the block enough that I rarely
7102000	7104000	use the user or critic reviews to
7104000	7106000	sway my purchases. I feel like
7106000	7108000	I can usually get a grasp on whether I'll enjoy a game
7108000	7110000	based on factors like who is making
7110000	7112000	it or preview materials. Plus
7112000	7114000	I tend to stick to franchises I've enjoyed
7114000	7116000	in the past. Dark Charger
7116000	7118000	says, neither. I usually know prior
7118000	7120000	to any review whether I'm going to buy it or not.
7120000	7122000	I know what I like. Occasionally there will be
7122000	7124000	great reviews for a game that I was not originally
7124000	7126000	considering. I may give that game a second
7126000	7128000	look and have discovered some great games this way.
7128000	7130000	Jordan T. says,
7130000	7132000	I usually try to get a feel for an average
7132000	7134000	of what a game is scoring in reviews.
7134000	7136000	With a secondary interest in the extreme positive
7136000	7138000	and especially negative comments,
7138000	7140000	just see what people zero in on.
7140000	7142000	After that, assuming I don't have previous experience
7142000	7144000	with the game or IP, I'll check out gameplay
7144000	7146000	footage to see if it's something I think I would like.
7146000	7148000	Justin H. says,
7148000	7150000	I admit somewhat shamefully that I love
7150000	7152000	both user and critic reviews.
7152000	7154000	I use Metacritic to discover games I wouldn't play
7154000	7156000	otherwise, specifically for older games
7156000	7158000	and indie games. Reviews have also
7158000	7160000	helped me avoid buying games that turn out to be not
7160000	7162000	as good as perceived, like the first person
7162000	7164000	shooter Brink or Reboot of Thief.
7164000	7166000	Reviews are just a tool,
7166000	7168000	however, and I will buy games with bad reviews
7168000	7170000	if I have a genuine interest in playing them regardless.
7170000	7172000	And lastly, Master Claw
7172000	7174000	says, I find most user reviews completely
7174000	7176000	worthless. They're usually poorly written
7176000	7178000	to a point of being unintelligible and they're
7178000	7180000	never moderate. They're always like, OMG
7180000	7182000	this game's awesome. Best game ever.
7182000	7184000	Five stars. Or,
7184000	7186000	this game sucks balls. I'd give it zero
7186000	7188000	stars if I could. I never played it, but I know
7188000	7190000	it sucks. I wish sites like Amazon
7190000	7192000	would allow filtering out
7192000	7194000	of unverified user reviews.
7196000	7198000	There it is. Comments
7198000	7200000	from our Facebook and Google Plus pages.
7200000	7202000	Thank you guys. A very big
7202000	7204000	variety. I was not expecting
7204000	7206000	such a huge variety, but
7206000	7208000	it's really all over the map. Some people saying
7208000	7210000	nah. Some people saying yeah, I kind of do.
7210000	7212000	Especially a lot of people
7212000	7214000	saying reviews
7214000	7216000	can kind of give that
7216000	7218000	second chance. I guess
7218000	7220000	now in this day and age, I'm kind of
7220000	7222000	on that team where I am looking at the
7222000	7224000	streaming of the game to see if it's something I would like.
7224000	7226000	That's what I did with Dragon Quest Heroes.
7226000	7228000	I originally was like, eh, it's
7228000	7230000	a side game. I don't think it's something I'm going to like.
7230000	7232000	But then I watched some of the streams and I was like,
7232000	7234000	well okay, I'll try it.
7234000	7236000	So I got it.
7236000	7238000	Anyway, there you go.
7238000	7240000	Some of the answers
7240000	7242000	from our Facebook and Google Plus communities.
7242000	7244000	Alan Alchemy saying
7244000	7246000	Amazon does have verified purchase
7246000	7248000	on the top reviews. That's true,
7248000	7250000	but I don't think they filter the star score
7250000	7252000	by only the verified reviews.
7252000	7254000	I don't think there's a way
7254000	7256000	to do that. At least not that I know of.
7256000	7258000	I think that might be what the listener was complaining about there.
7258000	7260000	Tigerclaw
7260000	7262000	saying yeah, watching a Twitch stream
7262000	7264000	of a game is a good way to see how the game is like
7264000	7266000	and that will help you on your purchasing decision.
7266000	7268000	I kind of agree. You have those resources
7268000	7270000	out there. Whether it be Twitch, YouTube,
7270000	7272000	whatever it is you use to look at the
7272000	7274000	actual video from a game, I think
7274000	7276000	is a great way to kind of know what you're getting into.
7276000	7278000	Alright, let's move on.
7278000	7280000	Back into some other news. Loki.
7280000	7282000	So we kind of touched on this last week with
7282000	7284000	Overkill
7284000	7286000	adding some microtransactions
7286000	7288000	to Payday 2. Basically
7288000	7290000	what they were doing originally is that
7290000	7292000	they were starting to get the
7292000	7294000	safe drops at the end of matches
7294000	7296000	and so when you would get
7296000	7298000	the safe, in order to
7298000	7300000	get what was inside of it, which contained
7300000	7302000	cosmetic items, many of which
7302000	7304000	would actually add stat bonuses,
7304000	7306000	you would actually have to pay real money
7306000	7308000	for the drills. So you had to pay
7308000	7310000	$2.50 to purchase a
7310000	7312000	drill to open the safe.
7312000	7314000	Well now, they're kind of
7314000	7316000	stepping back a little bit
7316000	7318000	instead of just having that be
7318000	7320000	the only way you get drills.
7320000	7322000	They're not really getting rid of the microtransactions
7322000	7324000	but they're also going to start having
7324000	7326000	drills drop as part of post
7326000	7328000	match rewards as well.
7328000	7330000	Because before
7330000	7332000	it used to be the only way to get those would be
7332000	7334000	to buy them.
7334000	7336000	So now they're just going to drop as well.
7336000	7338000	So you may not have to buy them, but it's still
7338000	7340000	shit.
7340000	7342000	Yeah, not
7342000	7344000	a lot of happy people out there with
7344000	7346000	this whole thing, how this is
7346000	7348000	panned out there with Payday.
7348000	7350000	Yeah, and the community doesn't seem to enjoy it too much
7350000	7352000	based on what I've seen.
7352000	7354000	Well, if you don't like it, don't buy the
7354000	7356000	game, that'll send a message. Do you think that'll
7356000	7358000	actually happen or people just won't be able to resist?
7358000	7360000	I think
7360000	7362000	people can probably resist opening
7362000	7364000	those.
7364000	7366000	For $2.50 for just a random
7366000	7368000	cosmetic item, I think that
7368000	7370000	would be, that's not kind of worth it.
7370000	7372000	Yeah, but if the game doesn't sell well, that'll really tell
7372000	7374000	them. I mean, 8,000 copies of your game
7374000	7376000	sold is going to send a message. But I think that Payday
7376000	7378000	sold more than 8,000 copies.
7378000	7380000	I'm just saying. They re-released it so many times
7380000	7382000	I think it's doing just fine.
7382000	7384000	Alright.
7384000	7386000	Well, we've
7386000	7388000	been talking a lot about remakes tonight,
7388000	7390000	reimaginings, and this is interesting.
7390000	7392000	This is a
7392000	7394000	story that's been floating around where
7394000	7396000	Mega Man 3 is being
7396000	7398000	remade by a fan in the Unreal
7398000	7400000	Engine 4. And I'm totally
7400000	7402000	going to mispronounce this name, so I apologize.
7402000	7404000	But, André
7404000	7406000	de Jaeger, I hope I said that right.
7406000	7408000	But he's been working on this, just
7408000	7410000	toying around in Unreal
7410000	7412000	excuse me,
7412000	7414000	remaking Mega Man 3.
7414000	7416000	And I gotta say, it looks great
7416000	7418000	when you look. He's just got a little
7418000	7420000	clip of the Gemini Man stage in
7420000	7422000	this. I don't know where the music comes
7422000	7424000	from. I don't know if he remade the music or if he's like
7424000	7426000	using an overclocked mix or something. There's
7426000	7428000	so many Mega Man fan mixes
7428000	7430000	out there you can only imagine.
7430000	7432000	But let me show, just to the folks in
7432000	7434000	studio here, if I can
7434000	7436000	if I can
7436000	7438000	if it'll work.
7438000	7440000	You can
7440000	7442000	kind of see what that looks like there.
7442000	7444000	Looks great, huh?
7444000	7446000	The background leaves
7446000	7448000	a little bit to be desired, but yeah, the rest
7448000	7450000	of it looks great. Yeah, and then you get into the segments
7450000	7452000	like where it's all the colored blocks, like that looks really
7452000	7454000	good, huh? Yeah, it is.
7454000	7456000	So,
7456000	7458000	I just, you know, again, I think there's a lot of
7458000	7460000	people that would really like something like that.
7460000	7462000	So,
7462000	7464000	alright.
7464000	7466000	I played it again.
7466000	7468000	Anyway, I don't know.
7470000	7472000	Here's the thing when it comes to remakes, especially like this.
7472000	7474000	A lot of people that do like
7474000	7476000	speed runs and things that perfect
7476000	7478000	the game, kind of expect
7478000	7480000	the game to run in certain
7480000	7482000	ways. And when you remake a game like this,
7482000	7484000	I'm not sure everything's gonna be down to the
7484000	7486000	nanosecond, if that makes sense.
7486000	7488000	And that can really bother some people, but I think
7488000	7490000	if you're okay with that, I think this looks
7490000	7492000	great. Like, you know,
7492000	7494000	this is, this looks even
7494000	7496000	better than Mighty No. 9, to be honest.
7496000	7498000	And it's just one guy!
7498000	7500000	Just blows my mind how Capcom doesn't want
7500000	7502000	to do anything like that.
7502000	7504000	So.
7504000	7506000	bonds006 in chat says, Jamie does not
7506000	7508000	sound impressed.
7508000	7510000	That's alright. Well, they did that sort of
7510000	7512000	with Mega Man powered up
7512000	7514000	M, I think that's what it was called,
7514000	7516000	or Mega Man powered up, that was on PSP.
7516000	7518000	Oh yeah, that looked really good, yeah.
7518000	7520000	I mean, they did it in a weird art style
7520000	7522000	where it's like giant head Mega Man, you know,
7522000	7524000	but it was kind of
7524000	7526000	like that. And how level editor was
7526000	7528000	kind of cool. No love for that
7528000	7530000	though, I mean, I don't understand why they'll do that
7530000	7532000	for console. You know, somebody
7532000	7534000	posted in my Facebook, I don't remember if it was
7534000	7536000	Rama or Joe or somebody, but somebody posted
7536000	7538000	my Facebook that somebody remade
7538000	7540000	like Mega Man 1
7540000	7542000	within Mario Maker.
7542000	7544000	And they, now obviously it
7544000	7546000	doesn't look exactly
7546000	7548000	like Mega Man, but it's like a lot of the same
7548000	7550000	elements they kind of put
7550000	7552000	in Mario Maker, and I was really impressed, I
7552000	7554000	gotta say. They did this whole YouTube where
7554000	7556000	they used some remixed Mega
7556000	7558000	Man themes kind of in the background to give it a little
7558000	7560000	flair, and obviously they used the Mega Man
7560000	7562000	amiibo as well. What? They didn't even make like
7562000	7564000	the music, you know, with, you know, the
7564000	7566000	the note blocks. That would have been
7566000	7568000	a little complicated to do all of that.
7568000	7570000	Nah, just kidding. I just thought that was really
7570000	7572000	cool as well. There's so much
7572000	7574000	fan love for Mega Man out there.
7574000	7576000	It's just like, Capcom, make a new one.
7576000	7578000	You never will, but alright.
7578000	7580000	Anyhow, Dark Saga.
7580000	7582000	Well,
7582000	7584000	you know, we've
7584000	7586000	talked about many different
7586000	7588000	studios in the past and about them going to
7588000	7590000	certain locations. This one
7590000	7592000	is actually pretty cool because
7592000	7594000	it kind of affects my old stomping grounds.
7594000	7596000	And Exile is opening
7596000	7598000	a new studio in
7598000	7600000	New Orleans. They're the
7600000	7602000	group that gave us
7602000	7604000	Bard's Tale 4, for example.
7604000	7606000	But they are going to be
7606000	7608000	opening up
7608000	7610000	the studio. They're supposed to
7610000	7612000	create about 50 new jobs over
7612000	7614000	the next five years.
7614000	7616000	So,
7616000	7618000	they're basically going to be
7618000	7620000	setting up there, trying to also
7620000	7622000	have a long-term goal of creating
7622000	7624000	110 new jobs
7624000	7626000	in Louisiana itself.
7626000	7628000	And,
7628000	7630000	I just think it's
7630000	7632000	good that they're looking to invest in the area,
7632000	7634000	especially given that parts
7634000	7636000	of the state are still recovering. I mean,
7636000	7638000	Katrina was a while back. Sure.
7638000	7640000	But not everything is recovered. That's going to take
7640000	7642000	a generation to recover from. Yeah.
7642000	7644000	So, I think this is great.
7644000	7646000	I think this is really good, and that means
7646000	7648000	that, you know, folks that I know
7648000	7650000	in the area, that's
7650000	7652000	less distance
7652000	7654000	that have to move to find work in the industry.
7654000	7656000	Yeah. Good deal.
7656000	7658000	It's always nice to hear about jobs being made
7658000	7660000	as opposed to layoffs.
7660000	7662000	So, Loki, what do you have for us?
7662000	7664000	Well, I have layoffs for you.
7664000	7666000	God damn it, Loki.
7666000	7668000	No, but anyways,
7668000	7670000	Rovio, they've laid off
7670000	7672000	213 people. God damn it, Loki.
7672000	7674000	Sorry.
7674000	7676000	But it's fewer than
7676000	7678000	what was originally announced, because they announced
7678000	7680000	260, and that was back in August.
7680000	7682000	But they're restructuring
7682000	7684000	the company to focus on
7684000	7686000	key areas like games media
7686000	7688000	and consumer products.
7688000	7690000	And of course, you know, they have the
7690000	7692000	Angry Birds movie coming out in
7692000	7694000	May. So,
7694000	7696000	yeah. The first round, I guess,
7696000	7698000	you know, they
7698000	7700000	laid off 110 employees back in
7700000	7702000	December, and now this
7702000	7704000	213 is going to be
7704000	7706000	I think a reduction of about
7706000	7708000	36% originally from their
7708000	7710000	numbers that they were working with.
7710000	7712000	That
7712000	7714000	sucks, but, you know. It does, but how
7714000	7716000	often have we seen this in the smartphone day
7716000	7718000	and age where, you know, this company has their
7718000	7720000	one breakthrough game, and then all of a
7720000	7722000	sudden it's like they're bloated beyond control
7722000	7724000	and then, oh, surprise,
7724000	7726000	the future releases didn't
7726000	7728000	catch on in the same way, so we have to
7728000	7730000	lay everybody off. I mean, this has happened like time and time
7730000	7732000	again, right? Yeah.
7732000	7734000	Is Zynga even still around at this point?
7734000	7736000	Yeah, they are. Are they?
7736000	7738000	What are they making these days? Is there
7738000	7740000	Farmville 3?
7740000	7742000	I don't know. I don't know.
7742000	7744000	But then, you know, Rovio has Angry Birds
7744000	7746000	and I don't know. What else did they do?
7746000	7748000	Yep.
7748000	7750000	And then there was
7750000	7752000	the OMG Pop or whatever,
7752000	7754000	the drawing game
7754000	7756000	on the phone that was huge, and then Zynga
7756000	7758000	bottom, and then nobody wanted to play it anymore.
7758000	7760000	It's Candy Crush.
7760000	7762000	And all the others. What else have they done?
7762000	7764000	Soda Crush. Oh,
7764000	7766000	Candy Crush 2, Electric Boogaloo.
7766000	7768000	What else? Yeah, and like other Crush
7768000	7770000	games. Like, I have a coworker that plays
7770000	7772000	that kind of stuff, and I'm like,
7772000	7774000	what are you playing? And she's,
7774000	7776000	I don't even know, it's like some
7776000	7778000	game. And it's
7778000	7780000	basically Candy Crush, but
7780000	7782000	it just kind of proves, like, it's not Candy
7782000	7784000	Crush, it was just one of the other
7784000	7786000	millions of those games out there.
7786000	7788000	Like, the market's so saturated with like, oh,
7788000	7790000	hey, Candy Crush worked out
7790000	7792000	really well, let's make a bunch of those.
7792000	7794000	I start playing Brandy Lush.
7794000	7796000	I just drink a lot.
7796000	7798000	I'm playing like, you know, it's like Jewel Crush
7798000	7800000	2, or, I don't know.
7800000	7802000	It's...
7802000	7804000	ActDeft in chat says
7804000	7806000	crush all the things. Oh, be careful,
7806000	7808000	I believe that word is trademarked.
7808000	7810000	Patent pending. Copyright.
7812000	7814000	Anyhow.
7814000	7816000	Hey, some fun news
7816000	7818000	out of the indie scene. Apparently,
7818000	7820000	Goat Simulator and
7820000	7822000	I Am Bread are
7822000	7824000	combining forces for some
7824000	7826000	crossover DLC. And there's
7826000	7828000	actually a trailer that
7828000	7830000	shows, through the power of love,
7830000	7832000	a goat and bread
7832000	7834000	going on a date together
7834000	7836000	to...
7836000	7838000	Goat Simulator will be
7838000	7840000	getting a playable piece of bread,
7840000	7842000	and I Am Bread is gonna get a mode called
7842000	7844000	Rampage. So these
7844000	7846000	two games have literally gotten in bed
7846000	7848000	together for DLC, but this is great.
7848000	7850000	I don't like I Am Bread, but I Am Bread is so frustrating
7850000	7852000	and hard that I don't like
7852000	7854000	that game anymore. I am frustrated.
7854000	7856000	I kinda wish...
7856000	7858000	I'm glad Goat Simulator is getting more
7858000	7860000	DLC. Please bring it to the console, because
7860000	7862000	I can't purchase it on console.
7862000	7864000	It doesn't run well on my PC, and that's
7864000	7866000	my big problem. I would love to purchase
7866000	7868000	your game. I like all the DLC and stuff.
7868000	7870000	I can't, though, because you don't
7870000	7872000	offer it. I have money
7872000	7874000	in my hand. Gonna give it to you,
7874000	7876000	but you're not letting me. And some bread. I have more bread,
7876000	7878000	if that's what you want. You're not letting me.
7878000	7880000	So, yeah.
7880000	7882000	There you go.
7882000	7884000	So, uh, congrats to those guys.
7884000	7886000	That looks like it'll be fun.
7886000	7888000	Alright, let's go to our
7888000	7890000	mailbag!
7896000	7898000	Every week, Dark Soccer dives into our
7898000	7900000	mailbag, and if you want to email us,
7900000	7902000	participate at Orangelauntrader.com
7902000	7904000	is how you can participate with the show.
7904000	7906000	We had some good emails last week, um, so
7906000	7908000	hopefully, this week can live up to it.
7908000	7910000	We have two emails tonight, right, Dark Soccer?
7910000	7912000	Alright, let's get to it!
7912000	7914000	Hello, LR. Please forgive me if I'm about to sound like
7914000	7916000	a high and mighty bragging douche butt.
7916000	7918000	But you are!
7918000	7920000	I mean, let's, let's be, sorry, I don't even
7920000	7922000	know who this is yet, or what it is, but
7922000	7924000	anytime you're gonna say, sorry if I'm gonna do this butt,
7924000	7926000	you're, I'm gonna do it. You are gonna be that.
7926000	7928000	You are gonna do it. But it's okay! I like how this
7928000	7930000	field says, I don't mean to sound racist, but
7930000	7932000	yeah, you're racist.
7932000	7934000	And, I, you know what, I'll,
7934000	7936000	I have definitely been a whiny douche on this
7936000	7938000	show, have we all, so, have your moment,
7938000	7940000	emailer, have your moment. You know what,
7940000	7942000	though, I think that the word douche is the best
7942000	7944000	insult ever. Yeah? You know why?
7944000	7946000	Why? Because, first of all, if you look at an
7946000	7948000	actual douche...
7948000	7950000	I'd rather not. Number one...
7950000	7952000	Especially as a gay man, it's really not something
7952000	7954000	I just, I have zero interest in it whatsoever.
7954000	7956000	Number one... What?
7956000	7958000	It's unnecessary. And number two,
7958000	7960000	it actually can cause harm.
7960000	7962000	That's the best insult ever.
7962000	7964000	Now I'll continue.
7964000	7966000	I think
7966000	7968000	I heard, I actually think I owe Becky
7968000	7970000	rent on that one, because she
7970000	7972000	mentioned that to me once. I see.
7972000	7974000	Pretty good. I don't,
7974000	7976000	okay, I just don't understand why people make such a
7976000	7978000	big deal about beating Contra on the
7978000	7980000	default three lives.
7980000	7982000	It's really, really not that difficult.
7982000	7984000	Compared to those NES games that are
7984000	7986000	actually hard, like Ninja Gaiden
7986000	7988000	or Battletoads or many others,
7988000	7990000	I would say that anyone with at least some
7990000	7992000	gaming skill could do it if they actually
7992000	7994000	try. Personally, I can do it
7994000	7996000	every time without continues.
7996000	7998000	Why aren't you special?
7998000	8000000	Hearts, YYR,
8000000	8002000	hearts. Oh, it's YYR?
8002000	8004000	Yes. Sound the hipster alarm.
8008000	8010000	Better grow that beard and put on some lumberjack
8010000	8012000	clothes. That's right. I got some
8012000	8014000	flannel for you. I've got some horn-rimmed glasses
8014000	8016000	somewhere. Let's watch some Portlandia
8016000	8018000	and listen to some indie bands. Listen to some vinyl.
8020000	8022000	All you need are decent
8022000	8024000	timing and reflexes, a bit of
8024000	8026000	memorization, some knowledge
8026000	8028000	of how the game works, for example, keeping
8028000	8030000	in mind that random enemies can pop out
8030000	8032000	along the ground at any time, and
8032000	8034000	to get comfortable. People, stop
8034000	8036000	messaging me while I'm reading the email.
8036000	8038000	Seriously. Shut it off.
8038000	8040000	No, it's the chat.
8040000	8042000	The thing pops every time I get a message
8042000	8044000	and it's freaking distracting.
8044000	8046000	You need to turn that off.
8046000	8048000	I can't, not with what I have.
8050000	8052000	Where was I? Okay.
8052000	8054000	A hipster douche vinyl.
8054000	8056000	And to get comfortable with the game's weapons.
8056000	8058000	Knowing where the best weapons are
8058000	8060000	helps with quite a bit,
8060000	8062000	but if you're decent at mashing the B button,
8062000	8064000	you can get comfortable with the default weapon as well.
8064000	8066000	And that can help even more.
8066000	8068000	The game gives you a generous number of extra
8068000	8070000	lives, and if you count those, you actually
8070000	8072000	have closer to 10 by the end.
8072000	8074000	And most of all, playing by yourself
8074000	8076000	helps a lot too. You play with yourself
8076000	8078000	and that helps. Do you play with
8078000	8080000	yourself a lot, YPR?
8080000	8082000	You might have thought otherwise, but not having
8082000	8084000	to worry about keeping the same pace as
8084000	8086000	your partner is a huge load off your shoulders.
8086000	8088000	Imagine playing with yourself as a huge load.
8088000	8090000	Jamie!
8090000	8094000	I can't help it.
8094000	8096000	I'm in that mood tonight.
8096000	8098000	It's not as much as you would think.
8098000	8100000	With at least another partner, you normally get a
8100000	8102000	huge load button.
8102000	8104000	A little extra advice
8104000	8106000	will... the whole point is to take off
8106000	8108000	a huge load. He needs to get the huge load off.
8108000	8110000	Please finish
8110000	8112000	this damn email.
8112000	8114000	That's kind of not really how it works, but okay.
8114000	8116000	A little extra advice to...
8116000	8118000	Am I in the Horde house? What happened?
8118000	8120000	Josh! A little extra advice
8120000	8122000	to anyone who wants to try.
8122000	8124000	The R powerup is not a weapon.
8124000	8126000	It makes the shots fired by your current weapon
8126000	8128000	move faster. Every weapon has a maximum
8128000	8130000	number of shots allowed on the screen at a time
8130000	8132000	so the faster they're gone, the sooner you can
8132000	8134000	fire more. The S plus R
8134000	8136000	combination is in almost every way
8136000	8138000	the best weapon in the game. In Stages 2
8138000	8140000	and 4, don't forget that ducking makes you
8140000	8142000	invincible against bullets
8142000	8144000	and jumping is almost
8144000	8146000	always a bad idea.
8146000	8148000	Also in those levels, the round
8148000	8150000	targets are mandatory, but all others are
8150000	8152000	optional. Against the Stage 4 boss,
8152000	8154000	any homing bubbles that appear
8154000	8156000	would be your first priority, and the snowfield
8156000	8158000	will move forward slowly and be ready
8158000	8160000	to jump over the sudden turrets.
8160000	8162000	And I think if you're playing single player
8162000	8164000	if you push up on Player 2
8164000	8166000	controller, you can hit
8166000	8168000	the targets in the middle even if you're ducking
8168000	8170000	if I remember correctly.
8170000	8172000	When moving through Stage 8,
8172000	8174000	stop moving forward as
8174000	8176000	soon as you encounter the next mouth
8176000	8178000	unless doing so is impossible.
8178000	8180000	Destroying them when at a time will prevent
8180000	8182000	you from being overwhelmed.
8182000	8184000	When fighting the head or the
8184000	8186000	heart, the distance between you and the target
8186000	8188000	is so short that your shots
8188000	8190000	disappear almost instantly, so the
8190000	8192000	faster you can mash the buttons, the faster you can
8192000	8194000	consider yourself a hero. Against
8194000	8196000	the heart, make sure to take out the two
8196000	8198000	pods on the floor first. Makes
8198000	8200000	things much easier. I would encourage anyone
8200000	8202000	to try Contra on 3 lives even if
8202000	8204000	you never played it back then. Try it with
8204000	8206000	30 lives first just to get the hang of it, then
8206000	8208000	give it a shot. You're capable of more than you
8208000	8210000	think. Then
8210000	8212000	try the even more challenging
8212000	8214000	sequel, Keep the Trigger Pulled
8214000	8216000	Aaron YYR.
8242000	8244000	That Battle Toads is way harder
8244000	8246000	than even
8246000	8248000	you know, that Battle Toads was definitely
8248000	8250000	controller breaking rage
8250000	8252000	fury type of stuff and there
8252000	8254000	was no 30 lives code in that game so
8254000	8256000	you were just fucked if you
8256000	8258000	couldn't get the pattern down.
8258000	8260000	Ninja Gaiden was really, I own Ninja
8260000	8262000	Gaiden and I don't think I ever beat it.
8262000	8264000	I could only get like to like the next
8264000	8266000	to last stage I think was as far as I could get.
8266000	8268000	It was, it was
8268000	8270000	brutal. Yes.
8270000	8272000	So last email? Yep.
8272000	8274000	This comes from Rissimo.
8274000	8276000	Hi there. I just wanted to say
8276000	8278000	thanks to all three of you for giving me such
8278000	8280000	great ear candy over the years.
8280000	8282000	I found OLR by reading Joystick
8282000	8284000	Mini Moons ago. It was the
8284000	8286000	infamous Katamari tobacco.
8286000	8288000	Oh, I don't know what
8288000	8290000	you're talking about. What Katamari
8290000	8292000	tobacco?
8292000	8294000	I have heard every single episode
8294000	8296000	since then. I never get to listen
8296000	8298000	live so I
8298000	8300000	used to download the episodes from Loki's PSP
8300000	8302000	portal and followed you to Justin TV
8302000	8304000	and now I stream Epps from Stitcher.
8304000	8306000	I've gotten many friends to listen
8306000	8308000	since then and they love you just as
8308000	8310000	well. Thanks again for your dedication and
8310000	8312000	I hope you continue to bless us with your banter
8312000	8314000	for many more years.
8314000	8316000	Aww, thank you. That's, no question
8316000	8318000	or anything. That's it? Just a
8318000	8320000	I just called to say I love you?
8320000	8322000	I just called to say
8322000	8324000	I love
8324000	8326000	OLR.
8326000	8328000	Aww, I'm feeling warm and fuzzy now.
8328000	8330000	That's great. Thank you. It was like a little
8330000	8332000	e-hug. I appreciate that. You feel all squishy.
8332000	8334000	And then I'm thinking in my mind
8334000	8336000	how long ago was that Katamari thing?
8336000	8338000	Wasn't that like 2007 when that happened?
8338000	8340000	Or 2008? I don't even remember. It was a long time ago.
8340000	8342000	It was ages ago.
8342000	8344000	Joystick's been closed for a while now
8344000	8346000	so not that long I guess in retrospect.
8346000	8348000	Let's take a look, shall we?
8348000	8350000	So
8350000	8352000	I think, I want to say it was like 2008?
8352000	8354000	I could be
8354000	8356000	wrong. It was sometime
8356000	8358000	long ago
8358000	8360000	in a galaxy far, far away.
8360000	8362000	Still, that would have been just like
8362000	8364000	that's still like
8364000	8366000	seven years ago. That person's been listening for seven years.
8366000	8368000	Supposedly every week. I'm sorry.
8368000	8370000	Wow, I know that. I feel like there's
8370000	8372000	a long list of things I should apologize for you. March 16, 2007.
8372000	8374000	2007!
8374000	8376000	Thank you, Wikipedia.
8376000	8378000	We're actually a part of a beautiful Katamari Wikipedia page.
8378000	8380000	Are we really?
8380000	8382000	We are. Oh my god.
8382000	8384000	Why?
8384000	8386000	We don't even have our own Wikipedia
8386000	8388000	article anymore. Yep, we're under
8388000	8390000	PlayStation 3 and Wii development.
8390000	8392000	A March 16, 2007 post at
8392000	8394000	Orange Launch Radio reported that Namco Bandai
8394000	8396000	announced beautiful Katamari to retailers.
8396000	8398000	Well, I was like,
8398000	8400000	Namco Bandai didn't announce it.
8400000	8402000	That was, but okay.
8402000	8404000	But they did,
8404000	8406000	that's how we had discovered it was through the retail channels.
8406000	8408000	Yes, that is correct.
8408000	8410000	So
8410000	8412000	there was a PlayStation 3 version, okay.
8412000	8414000	But we don't, for some reason, we don't have
8414000	8416000	our own Wikipedia article anymore.
8416000	8418000	Because some douche figured
8418000	8420000	that we didn't need one. Even though
8420000	8422000	we won, and you know, whatever, I'm just
8422000	8424000	saying, I'm just saying, we won
8424000	8426000	the very first podcast award.
8426000	8428000	We are the longest running video
8428000	8430000	game podcast that exists, period.
8430000	8432000	If there was another
8432000	8434000	one, we would know of it by now. There's others
8434000	8436000	that have been running a very long time, ten plus
8436000	8438000	years, and many kudos to them, but
8438000	8440000	we are the longest, for what it's worth.
8440000	8442000	Let's see, what else? What else
8442000	8444000	makes this notable? I guess that's it.
8444000	8446000	Me. You.
8446000	8448000	Me.
8448000	8450000	We're also part of the
8450000	8452000	guitar hero encore rock the 80s.
8452000	8454000	What?
8454000	8456000	Wikipedia page.
8456000	8458000	How? Did we break the news on that or something?
8458000	8460000	I don't even remember.
8460000	8462000	That was a long time ago.
8462000	8464000	We do have a link as well
8464000	8466000	on Takeo
8466000	8468000	Mitsumiro,
8468000	8470000	Muratsu.
8470000	8472000	Is that the dude who
8472000	8474000	is OrangeLounge?
8474000	8476000	Under his, like, name, maybe?
8476000	8478000	I don't know. I'm just
8478000	8480000	going in, something about Jumping
8480000	8482000	Flash 2.
8482000	8484000	Let's take a look here.
8484000	8486000	That's cool
8486000	8488000	if we're cited in Jumping Flash 2, I
8488000	8490000	guess. How does that work?
8490000	8492000	Jumping Flash 2 is a great game.
8492000	8494000	They linked to
8494000	8496000	Tetsuya, posted something, I guess.
8496000	8498000	Huh.
8498000	8500000	It's an article
8500000	8502000	on our, or it was an
8502000	8504000	article. It's not linked there anymore
8504000	8506000	for some reason. Wow.
8506000	8508000	Oh, yeah. As 200 Matt says, the VOG Network
8508000	8510000	was also mentioned in the Disney Infinity Wiki
8510000	8512000	at one point. That's right, because the
8512000	8514000	E3 thing got the price point for those figures.
8514000	8516000	There's a post of us on Dailymotion
8516000	8518000	doing what?
8518000	8520000	It was actually going back to when we were
8520000	8522000	on the news about podcasting.
8522000	8524000	Oh, God.
8524000	8526000	Was that the one where, was that the clip with Loki?
8526000	8528000	Oh, it's so much fun.
8528000	8530000	KCRA, yeah. Oh, yeah.
8530000	8532000	With an old-ass iPod.
8532000	8534000	Yes.
8534000	8536000	That was before iPhones, wasn't it?
8536000	8538000	That clip was before the iPhone,
8538000	8540000	if I'm not mistaken.
8540000	8542000	Yup.
8542000	8544000	I think you guys,
8544000	8546000	I think we should
8546000	8548000	do that clip.
8548000	8550000	How long has it been since we
8550000	8552000	played this clip? No.
8552000	8554000	Yes, I think the whole conversation
8554000	8556000	with them, that's what they picked.
8556000	8558000	No, we're right after a shooting.
8558000	8560000	It's
8560000	8562000	9 years old. This story is 9 years
8562000	8564000	old from July of 2005.
8564000	8566000	No, this is,
8566000	8568000	oh my God, it's over 10 years old at this point.
8568000	8570000	The governor
8570000	8572000	is one of the many people joining the
8572000	8574000	podcasting craze.
8574000	8576000	It's becoming a web craze.
8576000	8578000	I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
8578000	8580000	Brian Hickey tonight shows us how
8580000	8582000	people are using podcasting to
8582000	8584000	inform, entertain, and share their thoughts
8584000	8586000	with the world.
8586000	8588000	Apparently your thought is only 10 seconds
8588000	8590000	known.
8590000	8592000	It's called Dance Dance Revolution, or DDR, a popular
8592000	8594000	game that has a fanatic following.
8594000	8596000	It started off tiny and it's
8596000	8598000	grown. Oh my gosh.
8598000	8600000	I hate hearing
8600000	8602000	myself. That's phrasing.
8602000	8604000	That's you talking about the prior email.
8604000	8606000	Phrasing.
8606000	8608000	Check out also
8608000	8610000	the gigantic HDTV I used
8610000	8612000	to have. This is the place I lived
8612000	8614000	with the extra for a moment.
8622000	8624000	Hello everybody
8624000	8626000	once again.
8626000	8628000	Welcome to another episode
8628000	8630000	of our podcast.
8630000	8632000	From their apartment in Rancho Cordova using
8632000	8634000	Revolution... We didn't all live together.
8634000	8636000	Just from their apartment.
8636000	8638000	We didn't all live together. Can you imagine
8638000	8640000	if all three of us, I mean I guess Loki and I
8640000	8642000	lived together for a while. We made it work.
8642000	8644000	Where would I put Dan?
8644000	8646000	And look how young we all are. I'm like
8646000	8648000	oh my god I had so much hair.
8648000	8650000	Girl.
8650000	8652000	Oh my god that was
8652000	8654000	the old
8654000	8656000	We basically give the news for video games
8656000	8658000	popular culture.
8658000	8660000	Basically what gamers really want to know.
8660000	8662000	Oh my god.
8662000	8664000	The developers record their programs
8664000	8666000	then send them to a number of websites
8666000	8668000	now hosting the shows.
8668000	8670000	Now anyone can create, edit and
8670000	8672000	air their ideas, concerns, music
8672000	8674000	and all things audio to anyone
8674000	8676000	else willing to download it.
8676000	8678000	It's a much
8678000	8680000	more flexible way of
8680000	8682000	spreading the information. With nothing
8682000	8684000	more than an MP3 player and a set of headphones
8684000	8686000	you can listen to it anywhere.
8686000	8688000	Now people can talk about
8688000	8690000	things they like to talk about
8690000	8692000	other people can join in
8692000	8694000	and listen to and it's really open
8694000	8696000	and lots of people can get into it.
8696000	8698000	I love how they just interviewed
8698000	8700000	some dude with an iPod and it was
8700000	8702000	like iPod owner. That was actually
8702000	8704000	the little thing that said it was an iPod
8704000	8706000	owner. A number of websites are now
8706000	8708000	hosting the podcast for free.
8708000	8710000	The newest and biggest database to adopt
8710000	8712000	the technology is Apple's iTunes.
8712000	8714000	You just click on the podcast
8714000	8716000	tab, type a topic in the search
8716000	8718000	feature and a list of available
8718000	8720000	podcasts are at your fingertips.
8720000	8722000	Free for you, free for the producers,
8722000	8724000	free speech for everyone.
8724000	8726000	It's so much fun.
8726000	8728000	It's great that you know just anybody out there
8728000	8730000	who really has a desire to want to be heard
8730000	8732000	you have an outlet for your voice to get out there
8732000	8734000	so podcasting is just wonderful.
8734000	8736000	Ian Rancho Cordova, Brian Hickey
8736000	8738000	KCRA 3 reports.
8738000	8740000	Yeah fuck that.
8740000	8742000	Recently Governor Schwarzenegger began providing
8742000	8744000	his weekly radio. Yes everybody
8744000	8746000	reminder, he really was the governor.
8746000	8748000	That actually happened.
8748000	8750000	He really was the governor of California.
8750000	8752000	The goobernator.
8752000	8754000	As a podcast it can be
8754000	8756000	downloaded so you can listen to it
8756000	8758000	in your car as you walk or even as you're
8758000	8760000	pumping iron in the gym.
8760000	8762000	Oh news.
8762000	8764000	Oops I almost started it over again. Sorry about that.
8764000	8766000	There we go. That's a clip from my KCRA
8766000	8768000	bootleg there
8768000	8770000	from our YouTube channel.
8770000	8772000	By the way I also want to point out
8772000	8774000	in that story did you notice
8774000	8776000	even though they had all of us
8776000	8778000	sort of in that interview
8778000	8780000	they never said the name of the show.
8780000	8782000	They never said it was called
8782000	8784000	Orange Lawns Radio ever in that entire clip.
8784000	8786000	They show a picture of it
8786000	8788000	when he's talking about oh iTunes has it
8788000	8790000	they show a picture of him subscribing to it
8790000	8792000	in iTunes with the really old
8792000	8794000	art like
8794000	8796000	even the one before the one
8796000	8798000	you did I mean it was really old.
8798000	8800000	We were in the four corners
8800000	8802000	I was in one corner
8802000	8804000	the chakra was in one corner Loki was in one corner
8804000	8806000	and then the fourth corner was the ferret.
8806000	8808000	And SSA 100 Matt says Loki's field
8808000	8810000	gypped from his five minutes of fame. No that's not the only time
8810000	8812000	I've been on the news. We also did a guitar
8812000	8814000	hero thing. I wasn't on that.
8814000	8816000	I gave an honest opinion about
8816000	8818000	like on a scale of 1 to 10
8818000	8820000	how do you rate them. It's about like an 8 or 9
8820000	8822000	and then Miss
8822000	8824000	Miss One Up here has to go it's an
8824000	8826000	11.
8826000	8828000	Fuck that shit.
8828000	8830000	Say thanks.
8830000	8832000	I was looking.
8832000	8834000	It's a million.
8834000	8836000	It's a million.
8836000	8838000	I was looking
8838000	8840000	just looking for
8840000	8842000	orange on radio and wiki and found
8842000	8844000	my page on the Wikipedia
8844000	8846000	and I don't ever remember saying this
8846000	8848000	but it does sound like something I'd say.
8848000	8850000	I'm controlling the apocalypse.
8850000	8852000	You're all fucked.
8852000	8854000	Wait but that wasn't on Wikipedia
8854000	8856000	that's the orange on radio. On our wiki.
8856000	8858000	Yeah so I haven't read my page.
8858000	8860000	That's a separate thing that the which
8860000	8862000	honestly I don't even know how to edit it.
8862000	8864000	I think maybe I changed one thing on there
8864000	8866000	one time but that's been like a group
8866000	8868000	of like three or four people that still
8868000	8870000	still keep that like classic game
8870000	8872000	list up to date and I think the list list gets
8872000	8874000	updated every time we do that game. Oh my god it's my
8874000	8876000	old MySpace page.
8876000	8878000	I didn't even think this existed anymore.
8878000	8880000	Wait you still have a MySpace page? Apparently I do.
8880000	8882000	There is a link to your MySpace
8882000	8884000	on the Wikipedia. Oh my god.
8884000	8886000	What song
8886000	8888000	is auto playing in the background?
8890000	8892000	Oh my god.
8892000	8894000	Dark Saga is horrified.
8894000	8896000	I would like to read my quotes from the page.
8896000	8898000	Oh yes what's that?
8898000	8900000	It says um
8900000	8902000	I can't for the life of me
8902000	8904000	get the hooker to have sex with me.
8904000	8906000	I remember that. That was you talking
8906000	8908000	about like Grand Theft Auto or something.
8908000	8910000	Of course it's so much fun.
8910000	8912000	Ow my foot why'd I shoot myself
8912000	8914000	in the foot oh my god it hurt so bad.
8914000	8916000	Yes that was you
8916000	8918000	being you were a game company
8918000	8920000	talking about something.
8920000	8922000	I don't remember what I was talking about.
8922000	8924000	Bomb Burger.
8924000	8926000	Wait hold on
8926000	8928000	because I actually I actually
8928000	8930000	have this
8930000	8932000	clip.
8932000	8934000	God damn.
8934000	8936000	Ow my foot.
8936000	8938000	Why did I shoot myself in my foot?
8938000	8940000	Oh my god it hurt so bad.
8940000	8942000	Oh my god my
8942000	8944000	No I need
8944000	8946000	that for walking.
8946000	8948000	Wait and I have this other one it says Loki on
8948000	8950000	babies. I'm a little worried.
8950000	8952000	What this
8952000	8954000	could be. Somebody once told me
8954000	8956000	what having a baby felt like.
8956000	8958000	Giving birth sucks and I'm never going to do it.
8958000	8960000	It's why they cut open your stomach and
8960000	8962000	pull the damn kid out. It's just like what the hell
8962000	8964000	is the point? It's like trying to shove a piano
8964000	8966000	through a door when there's a perfectly good
8966000	8968000	window right there.
8970000	8972000	I mean
8972000	8974000	I don't see the point.
8974000	8976000	And that's why
8976000	8978000	men will never have babies.
8978000	8980000	The genius of Loki on Orange Lums
8980000	8982000	Radio. I don't even remember what the hell
8982000	8984000	that was in regards to.
8984000	8986000	And then we were talking about
8986000	8988000	the Mega Man 2 jingle thing that they
8988000	8990000	had like an app where you can
8990000	8992000	whenever you click an icon
8992000	8994000	do the Mega Man 2 jingle and it's like
8994000	8996000	hamburger and then
8996000	8998000	mailman.
8998000	9000000	In the early days of apps or anything
9000000	9002000	gaming related.
9002000	9004000	That's kind of a
9004000	9006000	lame list. I've said more interesting things
9006000	9008000	since then.
9008000	9010000	For the record I would like to point out
9010000	9012000	that I have birthed no children.
9012000	9014000	Just saying.
9014000	9016000	Alright.
9016000	9018000	I don't even know
9018000	9020000	how we got on that tangent. Oh it was the
9020000	9022000	love letter. Just sent us down memory lane
9022000	9024000	so thank you for that. You even get
9024000	9026000	to hear clips from before you were even listening
9026000	9028000	probably recently so there you go.
9028000	9030000	Alright. Thank you for your emails.
9030000	9032000	Participate at OrangeLumsRadio.com
9032000	9034000	is the place where you can send us
9034000	9036000	emails as well. Let's
9036000	9038000	now take this opportunity to get into
9038000	9040000	the FUs of the week.
9057000	9059000	FU to
9059000	9061000	medical issues.
9061000	9063000	That's it. I'll leave it there.
9063000	9065000	There's so many things I don't even
9065000	9067000	remember on this thing like bucket rolled.
9067000	9069000	Anyways.
9069000	9071000	I guess FU to just being really
9071000	9073000	tired and not having a chance to work on
9073000	9075000	my costume because I'm worried that I'm gonna run out of time
9075000	9077000	very fast. So
9077000	9079000	I need to start tonight.
9079000	9081000	I gotta cut something tonight.
9081000	9083000	For the costume.
9083000	9085000	My FU of the week goes
9085000	9087000	to those delicious
9087000	9089000	pumpkin cinnamon rolls that
9089000	9091000	Jamie brought to the show tonight because they were so
9091000	9093000	Trader Joe's. They were so freaking
9093000	9095000	good but now I just feel so fat
9095000	9097000	after having eaten two of them.
9098000	9100000	I'm having eater's remorse.
9100000	9102000	Oh well.
9102000	9104000	There it is.
9104000	9106000	The FUs of the week.
9106000	9108000	Yep. In fact they already have episode six
9108000	9110000	nineteen classic game of the week already
9110000	9112000	in there so. They're
9112000	9114000	good. What can I say? They're fast. They are
9114000	9116000	fast. Alright.
9116000	9118000	Let's get to it. Don't you have to put
9118000	9120000	a spoiler alert on it though because the podcast doesn't
9120000	9122000	no I'm just kidding. Oh I didn't say what it was.
9122000	9124000	I just said it was there. I'm just. No I'm
9124000	9126000	on the wiki. It's fine. Alright.
9126000	9128000	Just a couple more stories for you guys then the
9128000	9130000	phone calls one eight seven seven
9130000	9132000	game OLR or username on Skype
9132000	9134000	Orange Lounge Radio.
9134000	9136000	All one word. Let's do these last
9136000	9138000	couple stories. Loki. So someone decided
9138000	9140000	to make a Zelda maker on
9140000	9142000	PC. Of course this is not officially
9142000	9144000	endorsed by Nintendo.
9144000	9146000	It is kind of cool to check out. They do
9146000	9148000	have an alpha release you can
9148000	9150000	download and make some levels
9150000	9152000	for. I
9152000	9154000	I don't know. It looked interesting
9154000	9156000	and I kind of watched the video of it.
9156000	9158000	I think this is going to get
9158000	9160000	taken down before you know it. Yeah now that
9160000	9162000	it's on all these new sites Nintendo's
9162000	9164000	lawyers will be at work Monday morning
9164000	9166000	which I hate to say but it's true. You guys all
9166000	9168000	know it's true. Yeah so
9168000	9170000	if you check it out
9170000	9172000	looking to see where the download is for that
9172000	9174000	basically
9174000	9176000	if you look for user dream mix
9176000	9178000	on YouTube there's a link of
9178000	9180000	one of the videos they have legends all that maker
9180000	9182000	Alpha zero point zero
9182000	9184000	one release and you can go download it
9186000	9188000	so it looks interesting.
9188000	9190000	Yeah it looks it's again
9190000	9192000	it's very interesting what a small little independent
9192000	9194000	group can accomplish.
9194000	9196000	So strange to me how
9196000	9198000	they can do that. But anyway
9198000	9200000	I mean sorry it's
9200000	9202000	it's not strange to me they can do it but
9202000	9204000	it's strange how it's
9204000	9206000	this small little team can do it yet you
9206000	9208000	know when it comes to a big company they're
9208000	9210000	they're pressed for resources and so forth
9210000	9212000	it's just I don't know it just
9212000	9214000	blows my mind sometimes.
9214000	9216000	Anyhow
9216000	9218000	lastly before we get to the Skype
9218000	9220000	line this is the story
9220000	9222000	I'm sure you've all been waiting for
9222000	9224000	in fact actually
9224000	9226000	is more when I heard it was one of those things where
9226000	9228000	gosh this didn't already happen
9228000	9230000	Hideo Kojima
9230000	9232000	has officially parted ways with
9232000	9234000	Konami in fact it happened
9234000	9236000	on October 9th and due to a
9236000	9238000	clause apparently in the
9238000	9240000	parting arrangement there he's
9240000	9242000	not allowed to work again until December
9242000	9244000	there was allegedly
9244000	9246000	some type of cheerful but emotional
9246000	9248000	goodbye departure ceremony that about
9248000	9250000	100 people went to and
9250000	9252000	Hideo Kojima did not comment on
9252000	9254000	this because of a legally binding agreement
9254000	9256000	with the former employer
9256000	9258000	but this is where things got really fucking weird
9258000	9260000	because Kojima can't
9260000	9262000	comment but Konami did
9262000	9264000	after the New Yorker ran that piece about
9264000	9266000	Hideo Kojima and
9266000	9268000	Konami decided to reply on
9268000	9270000	Tokyo Sports which got translated
9270000	9272000	saying that Kojima
9272000	9274000	is still an employee of Konami he's
9274000	9276000	just on vacation
9276000	9278000	currently Kojima is listed as a
9278000	9280000	company employee at Konami
9280000	9282000	currently Kojima and the development team are finished
9282000	9284000	developing Metal Gear Solid 5 and taking
9284000	9286000	a long time off from work because the
9286000	9288000	development time for console games is so long and fatigue
9288000	9290000	builds up it's common for employees to
9290000	9292000	take extended periods of time off when
9292000	9294000	development is finished
9294000	9296000	so would that vacation
9296000	9298000	be up in say I don't know December?
9298000	9302000	We'll see
9302000	9304000	Tigerclaw in chat says maybe
9304000	9306000	something got lost in the translation
9306000	9308000	you know here's the thing
9308000	9310000	Konami's PR stuff
9310000	9312000	is in the goddamn toilet right now
9312000	9314000	and if
9314000	9316000	this hadn't happened after what
9316000	9318000	has been an actual comedy
9318000	9320000	of errors one after another
9320000	9322000	coming out of Konami then
9322000	9324000	I would probably go okay there is
9324000	9326000	probably some type of miscommunication going on
9326000	9328000	and you know something weird is going on
9328000	9330000	but after everything
9330000	9332000	that's come out of Konami over the past
9332000	9334000	year between the PT debacle
9334000	9336000	and the removal
9336000	9338000	and the fact that nothing's coming out except
9338000	9340000	for mobile and pachinko
9340000	9342000	and all this stuff it's like okay
9342000	9344000	Konami needs
9344000	9346000	like
9346000	9348000	they need more than PR they need
9348000	9350000	CPR at this point they need a
9350000	9352000	lot of help getting their image
9352000	9354000	back up and I don't even know if it's recoverable
9354000	9356000	at this point and so yeah when I
9356000	9358000	hear that Kojima's left Konami
9358000	9360000	I kind of tend to believe it because there's
9360000	9362000	that big part of me that's like that didn't already
9362000	9364000	happen
9364000	9366000	SSG-100 Matt
9366000	9368000	says how stupid do they think we are
9368000	9370000	just stop Konami
9370000	9372000	Akdev says we're still together guys we're definitely not lying
9372000	9374000	and Dark Tetsuya says
9374000	9376000	Konami go home you're drunk
9378000	9380000	I think that's the most succinct way
9380000	9382000	to put it it's kind of it's
9382000	9384000	it's not kind of sad it's very sad
9384000	9386000	but it is what it is
9386000	9388000	sounds like
9388000	9390000	one too many egos kind of drove that company
9390000	9392000	into the ground and it will never be
9392000	9394000	the company that brought us double
9394000	9396000	dribble anymore
9396000	9398000	anyhow on that note I should probably open
9398000	9400000	up the Skype line I didn't even have Skype open
9400000	9402000	yet like I actually don't even have the application
9402000	9404000	open since Bobby was not
9404000	9406000	on tonight we didn't do the call
9406000	9408000	before OLR so I don't even have the
9408000	9410000	application open I'm trying to launch it right now
9410000	9412000	but it's taking
9412000	9414000	it forever so I'm going to ask Loki
9414000	9416000	if he has any last minute stories while I try to get
9416000	9418000	Skype up and running my wife wants me to build
9418000	9420000	a catio for my cat
9420000	9422000	I think you should do it
9422000	9424000	I want one for Midna well like here's the thing
9424000	9426000	it's like yeah it's basically like an outdoor space
9426000	9428000	she already has the garage I already put a fucking
9428000	9430000	door in our garage door so she can
9430000	9432000	go out in the garage and she's
9432000	9434000	been hanging out in there now she wants
9434000	9436000	to go outside I mean I could do that
9436000	9438000	but like
9438000	9440000	I'm going to be
9440000	9442000	spending money to build this thing that's a
9442000	9444000	fucking monstrosity for this cat
9444000	9446000	and the cat won't appreciate it
9446000	9448000	I mean you just kind of know
9448000	9450000	in the back of your head the cat would never use it
9450000	9452000	no the cat would use it she'd love
9452000	9454000	she loves outdoors in fact but she's just
9454000	9456000	scared like the other day like we had
9456000	9458000	a Comcast over and I told
9458000	9460000	him like it's cool
9460000	9462000	oh no not Comcast it was
9462000	9464000	the air conditioning guy he was over to
9464000	9466000	kind of check the system for the you know the
9466000	9468000	heater and everything and
9468000	9470000	I told him like yeah it's cool you
9470000	9472000	can go out the back but just make sure you close the door
9472000	9474000	because the cat you know will get out
9474000	9476000	oh she's scared of outside but just make sure
9476000	9478000	you close it because I don't want the door open so
9478000	9480000	he leaves and leaves the fucking door open when
9480000	9482000	he leaves and so I come out there
9482000	9484000	to go close the door and I
9484000	9486000	was seeing the cat walking around
9486000	9488000	alright let's get to the phones I finally

9626000	9628000	Winchester's and shit yeah I did not know
9628000	9630000	there was such a thing as a super gun
9630000	9632000	but I'm just gonna assume
9632000	9634000	I thought super guns were for playing video games
9634000	9636000	that's a really big gun
9636000	9638000	and then you can get a gun
9638000	9640000	I saw women in this class man that
9640000	9642000	there's no way they can hold a gun and shoot it
9642000	9644000	and they get to go buy them now

9656000	9658000	Dungeon Buster in chat
9658000	9660000	says super gun is that the one
9660000	9662000	Saddam had you know those weapons of mass
9662000	9664000	destruction I don't know I somehow
9664000	9666000	don't think Canada would have them if
9666000	9668000	that were the case actually if you want to have some
9668000	9670000	historical facts for you that in the
9670000	9672000	1980s when Iraq was
9672000	9674000	still considered an ally
9674000	9676000	of the United States there was a Canadian man
9676000	9678000	a Canadian man doctor
9678000	9680000	fuck I don't know Fongoli whatever but he was
9680000	9682000	Canadian and he was building the fucking
9682000	9684000	super gun in Iraq it was just a
9684000	9686000	big rifle big fucking
9686000	9688000	bullets essentially they said they took the
9688000	9690000	Canadian the genius of the Canadian and they
9690000	9692000	gave him the unlimited wealth of the
9692000	9694000	American Federal Trade Bank thingy
9694000	9696000	whatever it's called and then the
9696000	9698000	fucking this is really racist but it's true
9698000	9700000	the Israelis didn't like it so they killed
9700000	9702000	them
9702000	9704000	we never got to see the fucking super Canadian
9704000	9706000	gun all we get all we get is the
9706000	9708000	fucking gay little jerk off arm in
9708000	9710000	space that jerks off the space shuttle
9710000	9712000	watch it watch it
9712000	9714000	you don't have to make a space shuttle just
9714000	9716000	fucking jerk it off now hold on hold on
9716000	9718000	because this is the
9718000	9720000	thing is that you guys in Canada
9720000	9722000	know how to build big guns
9722000	9724000	so is all your politeness and all that
9724000	9726000	it's hiding something isn't it I knew it
9726000	9728000	all this time
9728000	9730000	he's showing off his muscles there
9730000	9732000	all right Jim Sally what did you want to call
9732000	9734000	in to talk about tonight I know you didn't call in to

9768000	9770000	going to save you if Donald Trump gets elected
9770000	9772000	it's our Justin Trudeau I think you could
9772000	9774000	be in power for the next 20 years
9774000	9776000	all right anyway what did you call
9776000	9778000	you did not call in to talk about guns or politics
9778000	9780000	what you want to talk about tonight
9780000	9782000	I don't even
9782000	9784000	know anymore man

9790000	9792000	some Grand Theft Auto I'm like oh that's
9792000	9794000	cool you can't really see it on
9794000	9796000	the screen over here and I was actually
9796000	9798000	calling to ask if there's any players out
9798000	9800000	there that would like to play Grand Theft Auto with me
9800000	9802000	on the Xbox
9802000	9804000	360 my name is Jim Salley also at
9804000	9806000	Xbox is there a way for people
9806000	9808000	to just give me money in
9808000	9810000	Grand Theft Auto 5 Loki can
9810000	9812000	you give Jim Salley money
9812000	9814000	I think there's
9814000	9816000	maybe a way to do that
9816000	9818000	most likely
9818000	9820000	you would have to just like
9820000	9822000	I don't know
9822000	9824000	it'd be an agreement with somebody to like
9824000	9826000	put a bounty on them well actually
9826000	9828000	no that wouldn't work either cause you
9828000	9830000	lose half the money then right
9830000	9832000	yeah I don't know if there's a way to give money
9832000	9834000	you
9834000	9836000	normally can't like you can
9836000	9838000	throw bets maybe
9838000	9840000	you can throw bets for
9840000	9842000	you know like different races or something
9842000	9844000	like that just bet a bunch of money and then have someone
9844000	9846000	win I mean that's one way to do it
9846000	9848000	I think there's a way to also like after missions
9848000	9850000	you are able to split up
9850000	9852000	the
9852000	9854000	taking from that and you're supposed to be able to give
9854000	9856000	extra money but I think they cut out a lot of
9856000	9858000	that too because people are using that to
9858000	9860000	when they're modding the game they would cheat that
9860000	9862000	way and you know give millions of dollars
9862000	9864000	I don't know
9864000	9866000	I don't remember if I have much money in the Xbox
9866000	9868000	360 version anymore
9868000	9870000	there's
9870000	9872000	gotta be someone out there that can help me out
9872000	9874000	and listen Jim Sally

10008000	10010000	it's been a while but you know

10046000	10048000	username on Skype Orange Lounge
10048000	10050000	Radio if no one else is going to
10050000	10052000	call then I guess we're going to be wrapping things
10052000	10054000	up here I was looking at some
10054000	10056000	comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com
10056000	10058000	chat room always lights
10058000	10060000	up during a uhhh
10060000	10062000	we had that Twitter poll
10062000	10064000	that kind of ended up getting on my Twitter
10064000	10066000	traffic but I'll look here real quick
10066000	10068000	actdeft is mentioning in chat
10068000	10070000	them's fightin' herds got funded
10070000	10072000	that was the game he called in to talk about last week
10072000	10074000	but they had hit their funding
10074000	10076000	point at that point
10076000	10078000	but they were in that last push to hit some stretch goals
10078000	10080000	and I think they got a couple of them after all
10080000	10082000	so congrats
10082000	10084000	ummm
10084000	10086000	let's see
10086000	10088000	I was looking at some tweets over at
10088000	10090000	twitter.com slash OLR
10090000	10092000	um at James Nighthawk
10092000	10094000	was thanking Dark Soccer for reading the email
10094000	10096000	on OLR last week
10096000	10098000	glad to hear you're a fellow fan of good grammar
10098000	10100000	in emails too
10100000	10102000	not only is she a fan, she demands it
10102000	10104000	it's an expectation, it has to happen
10104000	10106000	that's right
10106000	10108000	YYR at the end of the show last week
10108000	10110000	was letting us know about a massive
10110000	10112000	Dragon Age sale on Xbox
10112000	10114000	I mean obviously this is over by now
10114000	10116000	but I'll just mention Inquisition was 20 bucks
10116000	10118000	Dragon Age 2 5, Origins 3 74
10118000	10120000	don't know if I love it
10120000	10122000	where should I start?
10122000	10124000	where should somebody start with the Dragon Age series if they want to get into it
10124000	10126000	I think they should just go to Inquisition at this point
10126000	10128000	myself
10128000	10130000	you can start
10130000	10132000	Inquisition without knowing much in the background
10132000	10134000	but you would probably
10134000	10136000	have it start off with whatever the
10136000	10138000	default official canon is
10138000	10140000	however
10140000	10142000	if you really
10142000	10144000	do want the story beginning to end
10144000	10146000	you have to go Origins, DA2
10146000	10148000	I mean
10148000	10150000	Awakenings is a good one
10150000	10152000	I actually
10152000	10154000	I'd say in order of my favorite
10154000	10156000	games I would go Inquisition, DA2
10156000	10158000	Origins, and then Awakening
10158000	10160000	I'm actually one of those people
10160000	10162000	who is not the biggest fan of the first Dragon Age
10162000	10164000	except for Alistair
10164000	10166000	but there was a lot of people that didn't like
10166000	10168000	Dragon Age 2
10168000	10170000	I love Dragon Age 2, I freaking think it's fun
10170000	10172000	fair enough
10172000	10174000	I would say
10174000	10176000	just having been in similar shoes
10176000	10178000	you're totally ok starting Inquisition without
10178000	10180000	having necessarily played everything
10180000	10182000	else, so it's fine
10182000	10184000	and in fact I think the battle
10184000	10186000	system is a lot more accessible
10186000	10188000	I think playing the old games to get
10188000	10190000	through the story can be a bit of a
10190000	10192000	slog
10192000	10194000	it is a good story if you can tolerate it
10194000	10196000	but it's kind of like Mass Effect
10196000	10198000	the best Mass Effect game
10198000	10200000	is
10200000	10202000	I say it's tied between 2 and 3
10202000	10204000	but 2 really is
10204000	10206000	the peak of the series, but I think 3
10206000	10208000	is much better than a lot of people give it credit for
10208000	10210000	because I love the multiplayer in 3 and all that
10210000	10212000	and so it's like, yeah you gotta play Mass Effect
10212000	10214000	but you do kinda have to
10214000	10216000	push through Mass Effect 1 because
10216000	10218000	the story is still really good even if the
10218000	10220000	Mako scenes will drive you up a fucking wall
10220000	10222000	but it's still worth playing
10222000	10224000	alright
10224000	10226000	let's see, DungeonBuster in chat says
10226000	10228000	not a fan of Dragon Age 2 myself, but lore wise
10228000	10230000	it's useful, it was fun playing a
10230000	10232000	smart ass mage in that one
10232000	10234000	so apparently there's a rumor that
10234000	10236000	Final Fantasy DS
10236000	10238000	will be coming to arcades next month
10238000	10240000	oh yeah, I'd heard that, yeah
10242000	10244000	good, more stuff in arcades to play
10244000	10246000	except that'll probably just be Japan, not here, right?
10246000	10248000	yeah, probably
10248000	10250000	I would like to see it come to consoles someday
10250000	10252000	hopefully
10252000	10254000	get on it, get on that
10254000	10256000	remake a game you just put out
10256000	10258000	for consoles
10258000	10260000	alright, that's gonna do it
10260000	10262000	the phones aren't lighting up and it's about 9 o'clock
10262000	10264000	here on the west coast, I think we're gonna go ahead and wrap
10264000	10266000	up for the night, but I do want to thank you
10266000	10268000	guys for tuning in to Orange Laundry Radio
10268000	10270000	remember as we say every week, if you enjoyed the show
10270000	10272000	please tell a friend, or 5
10272000	10274000	or 15, about Orange
10274000	10276000	Laundry Radio, we are the show where every gamer
10276000	10278000	has a voice, but a lot of people out there
10278000	10280000	we're not notable enough to be on Wikipedia
10280000	10282000	so we have to really
10282000	10284000	rely on your voices and word of mouth
10284000	10286000	to help us get out there
10286000	10288000	and we really appreciate it, so
10288000	10290000	that goes a long way
10290000	10292000	leave us a fake 5 star review on Amazon
10292000	10294000	leave us a real one on
10294000	10296000	iTunes or Stitcher Radio
10296000	10298000	or wherever it is that you found this program
10298000	10300000	all that stuff goes a very long way
10300000	10302000	time to go around and get everybody's final thought
10302000	10304000	I guess I'll start
10304000	10306000	my final thought is
10306000	10308000	I need a nap after how delicious
10308000	10310000	those pumpkin rolls were
10310000	10312000	so BRB nap
10312000	10314000	except, ooh I want to play more Dragon Quest Heroes
10314000	10316000	so maybe no nap
10316000	10318000	Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight
10318000	10320000	according to this quiz, I'm
10320000	10322000	Princess Aurora
10322000	10324000	from Sleeping Beauty
10324000	10326000	and before we get to Loki's final thought
10326000	10328000	I want to say AkumaJP says, Dissida is on
10328000	10330000	handheld console though, that is true
10330000	10332000	I'm talking about the arcade one, yeah I understand
10332000	10334000	that that one is, we want the new shiny one
10334000	10336000	on Playstation 4, alright, just making sure
10336000	10338000	we clarify that there, anyway
10338000	10340000	last but not least, Loki, your final thought
10340000	10342000	my final thought is I need to work on my costume
10342000	10344000	and also Ultimate Spiderman
10344000	10346000	because Spiderman is one of the greatest cartoons
10346000	10348000	that they have for Marvel Spiderman
10348000	10350000	I mean, the writing is great
10350000	10352000	it's just great
10352000	10354000	great, that does it
10354000	10356000	for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio
