00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:52,320
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter as Skye and joining me as always

10
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,320
say hello over there to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,320
Hi.

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,320
How are you DarkSakura?

13
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,320
Gassy.

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,320
Gassy?

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,160
No, I've been drinking this Yarritos tamarind soda.

16
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,160
Yarritos!

17
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:11,920
And I've been burping like I've been on a beer binge like you wouldn't believe.

18
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,920
TMI.

19
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,040
But you know what?

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,160
I'm just keeping it real.

21
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:19,160
I did not know it was like Mexican food night here at Studio OLR, it's like a fiesta here

22
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,160
in Studio.

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,720
You're not the only one that brought that tonight.

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,360
Except for the like grouchy old white guy I elbowed at El Forestero.

25
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,000
You almost got in a fight.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,160
No, I just caught him on being a rude entitled shit.

27
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,360
I keep it real Rob, I keep it real.

28
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,520
DarkSakura tried to start a fight at the local taqueria.

29
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,080
Anyway, also say hello to of course the one guy who didn't bring Mexican food.

30
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,080
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

31
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,920
No, I tried pileology instead.

32
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,640
Yeah, that's one of those pizza places where they put the pizza in the oven, like the ultra

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,560
hot oven for just like two minutes, right?

34
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,040
Yeah, it was quick.

35
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,440
I mean it's basically you pick what toppings you want, I mean like any other pizza place,

36
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,840
but they kind of make it in front of you.

37
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,520
Yeah, I headed a place just like that in Boston, actually, for when I was there this year.

38
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,680
I'm like, I don't know what I want when I went in there, I'm like, ehhh, pepperoni.

39
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
That pepperoni?

40
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,280
If you guys didn't know, Loki's a very picky eater, so he has to...

41
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,320
Well, I wanted to put a bunch of stuff on there, but I was like, you know, if I put

42
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:17,480
bacon and pepperoni on there, it just, it's doesn't kind of go, it's like too much almost.

43
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,560
I don't like, you know, like combination pizzas too much because it's just a lot of

44
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,200
toppings and stuff, so...

45
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,640
It's kind of salad on a pizza, and it's a lot.

46
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,280
I just wanted like, I don't know, I wanted them to dump the whole tray of bacon on it,

47
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,920
but they wouldn't do that, so I was like, fine, I'll do pepperoni and garlic.

48
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,480
Could I get a scoop of pepperoni and a tray of bacon?

49
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,520
You have more in the back, we're going to need more.

50
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,520
Can you order more?

51
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,520
Can I get it here now?

52
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,520
I love it.

53
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,520
All right, well of course we are here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the

54
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,080
gamer lifestyle as we do every Sunday night at the Voice of the Geek's Network, vognetwork.com.

55
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,960
Real quick, I was kind of on the scene, sorry, but like seriously, yesterday I was grocery

56
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,360
shopping and they have like, you know, the bacon packages, little bacon bit packages

57
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,040
and stuff, and there's a little thing on it, it's like, you know, now it's six ounces with

58
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,840
even more bacon to love, I'm like, with even more bacon to love, like it literally exclaimed

59
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,000
that out in the supermarket.

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,720
Is it just a picture of a pig saying, let me love you?

61
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,720
Anyway, how dare, yeah, if you are listening live and you want to yell at Loki for interrupting

62
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,560
your plug, join our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com because of course we do tape live at the

63
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,040
Voice of the Geek's Network Sunday nights at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern,

64
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,720
right after the Bobby Black Hole show.

65
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,960
But we are joined not just by you guys in our chat room and us here in studio, but we

66
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,440
have some special guests here in studio with us tonight.

67
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,040
It just, it ended up being a fiesta tonight and they brought Taco Bell to make it complete,

68
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,560
even though we all know that's not real Mexican food, but say hello.

69
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,960
Joining us again and we appreciate when he drops in every now and again.

70
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,400
Say hello everybody to VOG super fan, Flaco Jones.

71
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
Hello.

72
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
Hey Flaco.

73
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
Hi everybody.

74
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,400
How you doing?

75
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
I'm doing great.

76
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
How are you doing?

77
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
I'm, I'm well, actually I had a fantastic day yesterday, but I'll get into that.

78
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
That's great.

79
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Yeah.

80
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,400
How about you?

81
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Are you having a super weekend?

82
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
I'm having a super weekend.

83
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,720
It's been really, it's been really cool.

84
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,720
All right.

85
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,640
I went up all the way up to Lake County to see my family and usually that's not a great

86
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,960
experience, but it was fun and it's so nice up there.

87
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,960
Yeah.

88
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,700
The Lake over there, it's kind of smells funny.

89
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,200
It's it's, yeah, I grew up with it, so I'm used to that.

90
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:26,000
Now, now I'm sorry to get super serious, but I know that that County was really affected

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,040
by some fires recently, but I'm assuming your family didn't get it.

92
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,040
No, no.

93
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,040
They're in the North County.

94
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,040
All the fires have been in the South County.

95
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,260
So we did drive through like an area that was totally scorched.

96
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,260
So it's kind of sad.

97
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,260
And this signs up everywhere, you know, you know, thanks for, you know, first responders

98
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,900
and thanks, you know, firefighters who did all the hard work.

99
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,900
So this signs up everywhere.

100
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,380
Well, and it's tough because believe it or not, we're actually getting rain now in California,

101
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,380
which is nice.

102
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,380
Yeah.

103
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,380
It rained on the way up there.

104
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,380
That's pretty cool.

105
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,380
I was like, what?

106
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,380
What is this stuff?

107
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,380
But for those fire stricken areas that just causes the mud.

108
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,380
Yeah.

109
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,380
Then there's gonna be landslides and stuff.

110
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,220
It's really sad because all the vegetation's gone.

111
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,660
It's just, it's all dirt now.

112
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,660
It's pretty bad.

113
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,660
So yeah, definitely.

114
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,060
Sorry to bring everybody down guys.

115
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,060
I know.

116
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,060
Fires are bad.

117
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,060
You know, good awareness.

118
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,060
Yeah, that's true.

119
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,060
We need the help.

120
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,300
So if, you know, you feel like making a donation to red cross.

121
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,180
One of the places that burned up like a, there's this forest up there in your middle town.

122
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,940
I used to go camping with my buddies up there.

123
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:20,140
We would just go out in the middle of forest and you know, go camp out overnight and that

124
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,780
place totally is gone.

125
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,100
There's like a hot Springs up there that's famous for like a nudist colony.

126
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,100
It's gone.

127
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,100
Pictures of that one.

128
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,100
It was really sad.

129
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,100
Oh yeah.

130
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,100
Yeah.

131
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,100
The Harbin hot Springs.

132
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,100
Yeah.

133
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,100
Not the nudist colony.

134
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,100
I know.

135
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,380
They may learn that taking carbon baths are healthy and good for the skin.

136
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,380
Yeah.

137
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,380
There you go.

138
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,540
So it's, it's, it's really sad to see the pictures like, Oh, I used to drive through

139
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,540
it all the time.

140
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,100
My friends are all live there, but they all have moved out since nobody I knew was really

141
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,100
affected anymore.

142
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,100
They don't like it.

143
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,100
Their family home.

144
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,100
They was like, Oh, that's where I grew up.

145
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,100
It's gone now.

146
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,100
But they're like, Oh, but we moved on.

147
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,100
I know.

148
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,100
It's kind of sad to think that way.

149
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,100
That's what he said.

150
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,100
I like, I called my friend.

151
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,940
I'm like, did you like, so your family home burned down, right?

152
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,940
He's like, yeah, yeah.

153
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,940
I was in the area.

154
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,940
Like, wow.

155
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,300
But I don't really go up there anymore.

156
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,580
So there's not a lot of people.

157
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,460
I lived in the same house for like 18 years, so I never moved as a kid.

158
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,540
So my house, my family home burned down.

159
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:16,940
I'd be like, so sad without like giving away addresses here on the show.

160
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:22,540
But my, the house I grew up in is in Roseville and it's not that far off the beaten path.

161
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:27,160
So once in a great while, I'll still drive by it just to say, Oh, check in, see how it,

162
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,160
how it looks these days.

163
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,740
I'm like, everything looks smaller now that I'm by.

164
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:32,740
What is this?

165
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,740
Like the nineties.

166
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,940
This is what Google maps is for from a satellite.

167
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,740
I don't have to drive all the way like where I grew up to look at my hands and hand view.

168
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,840
It's not the same.

169
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,740
So of course we have a comment from our chat room with Falco Jones being here.

170
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,960
We have SSU 100 Matt and our chat room says, Flaco Jones, hopefully nothing breaks or area

171
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,960
blackout tonight.

172
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,960
Yeah, I know.

173
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,960
You never know.

174
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,960
It's starting to rain.

175
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,140
California doesn't know how to handle rain.

176
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,140
Everything shorts out.

177
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,140
We never know.

178
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,140
You know what happens?

179
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,540
Yeah.

180
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,540
All right.

181
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,180
Well also, also a welcome back to the show two weeks in a row.

182
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,180
Look at us.

183
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,180
Say hello to Shana.

184
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,180
Linko.

185
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,180
Hi.

186
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,180
How are you?

187
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,180
Fine.

188
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,180
Yep.

189
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,180
Yeah.

190
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,180
How's power Rangers?

191
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,180
Really good.

192
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,180
Yeah.

193
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,180
Yeah.

194
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,180
So today you and I went on a shopping adventure.

195
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,180
Yeah.

196
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,060
So I got that retron five a couple of weeks ago, which I think I talked about on air.

197
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,060
Right.

198
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,840
But I need like, I have a few super Nintendo games and a couple of NES games, but you know,

199
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,240
my collection from when I was a kid, Lord knows what it's probably still at my childhood

200
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,380
home or something, but Lord knows what that stuff is.

201
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:40,260
So I have to kind of build, I have to build something that's even like a 10th of an impressive

202
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,080
as Jamie's collection is.

203
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,960
So I want to go buy some games.

204
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:50,720
So we went to a local flea market today and I wasn't, I was kind of disappointed.

205
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,720
I don't know.

206
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
I thought a lot of...

207
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
Disappointed in their prices.

208
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,640
A little bit, the prices a little bit, just the condition of all the cartridges like look

209
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,480
like they'd been out in the sun forever.

210
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,440
And I was just like, the flea market was a really scary place, so it doesn't surprise

211
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
me.

212
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,440
It was.

213
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,440
And you saw a knockoff power Rangers.

214
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,440
Yeah.

215
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,440
It was like Dino superheroes.

216
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,760
I love the knockoff toys.

217
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,760
Those are the best.

218
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,640
They're like the ones that they have, like Spiderman, like Raphael from the Ninja turtles,

219
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,540
a power ranger, a transformer.

220
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,680
It's like some weird, it made me sad.

221
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,760
There's so much awesome bootleg stuff at a flea market though, but it was really crowded

222
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,760
today.

223
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,240
The weather's like perfect right now.

224
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,680
It's like, you know, that kind of overcast 70 degrees.

225
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,680
It's a good day to be outside.

226
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,240
The one I miss going to, and I used to do it all the time because I used to live down

227
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,120
there was the San Jose flea market.

228
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,560
Man, that flea market was enormous.

229
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,760
Well the one on Roseville is pretty impressive.

230
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,320
This is way huger.

231
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,320
Way huger?

232
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,320
Yes, way huger.

233
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,000
That's proper English.

234
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,920
So it's, it's awesome.

235
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,920
Awesome.

236
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,840
I remember you said like, it was so big, they had parking across the street and you had

237
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,640
to walk under the street to get to the flea market.

238
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,640
That's where I buy all my NES titles.

239
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,600
Yeah, I was going to say, now I want to go to the other flea market in town to see if

240
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,800
maybe I can find some good deals, because I did get Clue on Super Nintendo at the other

241
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,880
flea market a few years ago, and that was kind of awesome.

242
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:17,280
And I see TigerClan chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Sky needs to stream on Twitch with the

243
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,600
Retron 5, got to revisit some of those old games.

244
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,360
I actually, I really do, and I was playing with it a little bit today.

245
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,120
I thought the quality was pretty darn good.

246
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,920
Yeah, it looked pretty good.

247
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,720
And I told, I told him that all he has to do is just stream Super Metroid because it's

248
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,400
the only game that's worth streaming.

249
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,400
I do have my Super Metroid cartridge, you know I still have that, so that'll be one

250
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
of the first.

251
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
That'll be one of the first.

252
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,400
But the game you saw today, I think I'll stream first.

253
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
Oh.

254
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,400
Well, that's one of my favorites.

255
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
Anyway.

256
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
Alright, whatever.

257
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:51,640
Okay, so we're going to get into tonight's show with the kickoff topic first, and today,

258
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:56,040
if you didn't already know, actual today that we're taping the show, October 18th,

259
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:02,120
is the 30th anniversary of the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System in America.

260
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,960
So even though, you know, some, because you probably are thinking, wait a minute, how

261
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,240
did we celebrate 30 years of Super Mario Brothers, well, because that was all by the Japanese

262
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
days.

263
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,680
So, because the NES or the Famicom was out in Japan, I think in 83, but it came out here

264
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,080
in the States in 85, October 18th, 1985.

265
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,240
So today we're looking back on 30 years of the Nintendo Entertainment System.

266
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,880
Later in the show, we're actually going to play a listless game around this.

267
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,440
If you've never heard us do listless before, stay tuned, we're going to get into that in

268
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,840
Part B tonight.

269
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,520
I should also say here at the top of the show, I was going to get into this in housekeeping,

270
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,360
but I want to make sure we get a plug for this, because this is a pretty big deal.

271
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,320
We have a cool little exclusive interview from our correspondent, DJ Rama, from Anime

272
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:51,920
Jam Session, is actually going to bring us an interview he did tonight with Kyle Hebert,

273
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,600
and you may not know the name, but he's a voice actor and he's done a lot of big stuff,

274
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,440
including he's the voice of Ryu in like Street Fighter IV and, you know, Smash Brothers and

275
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,440
all that.

276
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,320
So he's got a pretty impressive resume when it comes to anime and games.

277
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,640
So DJ Rama S will be bringing us that interview a little later in the show.

278
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,640
So we'll get to that.

279
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,480
But anyway, sorry for the tangent, but I want to make sure that got a shout out towards

280
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,080
the top of the show.

281
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:21,160
Getting back into the 30th anniversary of the NES, I know that my life has been shaped

282
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,420
significantly by the Nintendo Entertainment System.

283
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,160
Let me go around the room, because I know we've shared a lot of memory stories and so

284
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,160
forth.

285
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,320
But let me go around the room and say, what do you guys consider to be your favorite,

286
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,920
your one favorite NES game playing experience?

287
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,560
Like what is your favorite NES game that you ever played or your favorite experience?

288
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,640
And more importantly, why?

289
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,360
I see Dark Soccer picking the mic up.

290
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,000
So ladies first, your favorite NES and why?

291
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
The Guardian Legend.

292
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Of course.

293
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,120
I mean, it was semi obscure.

294
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,760
It was a sequel to a not great MSX game.

295
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,440
And it was really freaking hard.

296
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,640
And I had a very deep sense of accomplishment when I beat it.

297
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,560
And I don't even nearly have that skill now.

298
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,520
It requires really fast reflexes, but it was such a good game.

299
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,000
Yeah, like even playing that very first level, the beginning of it scrolls by so fast, it

300
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
like throws you off guard.

301
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,480
Like, why can't I get any of these power-ups?

302
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,160
But it's kind of supposed to do that, I guess, in the very beginning.

303
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,400
And then me being young and having a nice, strong female hero, it was really nice.

304
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
Yeah.

305
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,880
No, that is absolutely one of my favorite games for sure.

306
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,480
Who's got the mic over there, Flacco?

307
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,480
What about you?

308
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,080
What is your favorite NES game ever?

309
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
Why?

310
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,080
Oh my gosh.

311
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,080
This is such a hard question.

312
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,480
I only can pick one.

313
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,480
Yeah.

314
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,520
I was unprepared for it.

315
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,520
It's live radio.

316
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:49,080
Alright, so I mean, the first thing that always pops in my head is Mario 2.

317
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,560
And I know like, oh, that's a weird game from blah, blah, blah.

318
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,560
It's not a real Mario game.

319
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,560
I don't think so.

320
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,560
I don't agree with that at all.

321
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,560
I don't know.

322
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,560
I don't know.

323
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,560
And it's all a dream or whatever.

324
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,560
I don't care.

325
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,560
I love that game.

326
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,260
I think it's one of the first games I beat because I didn't get Nintendo when everybody

327
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,260
else did.

328
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,040
So I played all these games like after the fact, kind of.

329
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,480
I played Mario Brothers and I played through it.

330
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,480
I didn't beat it.

331
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,600
And then I played Mario 2 and I'm like, oh, I love this game so much more because I kind

332
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,040
of had them both at the same time.

333
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,320
So yeah, Mario 2 I really loved.

334
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,840
I loved beating the final boss and I love the art style and I like the different gameplay

335
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,840
for the different characters.

336
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,680
And then the only other game I could think of is, this is why it's neck and neck for

337
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,040
me, but Deja Vu on the NES.

338
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,040
Oh yeah.

339
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:38,080
That was in that same series as like an uninvited Shadow Gate.

340
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,080
I just love Deja Vu.

341
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,880
Again, I got all these games as hand-me-downs, so I had them way later.

342
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,880
That was a Mac game.

343
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,880
That series was really a Mac series.

344
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,080
And a lot of people say that the S ports weren't very good, but I just loved them.

345
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,680
The music in Shadow Gate, though, is seriously one of my favorites.

346
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,840
I know it's a Mac game, but then they got a Japanese composer, I think, to do the music.

347
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,040
I love the music in Deja Vu, so I don't know if it's the same composer, but I love that

348
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,040
game.

349
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,040
So I love both those games so much, so it's hard to pick.

350
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,400
No, that's all right.

351
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:09,000
And since you bring up Mario 2, you know how today, here we are 30 years later, and

352
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,680
oftentimes we criticize the sequel-itis, the yearly entry, right?

353
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,060
Like Madden 16, Roster Update 2016, right?

354
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,520
We kind of get very critical of sequels because they don't really differ that much from the

355
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,520
original.

356
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,800
But one interesting thing, like really interesting thing about the Nintendo Entertainment System

357
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:33,160
in particular, is that a lot of the sequels on NES were very different games.

358
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:38,200
And I know that Mario 2, we all know that it was based off another Japanese game and

359
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:44,360
that Japan actually had the Mario 2 that was very similar to Mario 1, so it was a hell

360
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,120
of a lot harder, right?

361
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,080
But I liked that it was so different, and it showed the versatility, I think, of the

362
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,720
strong characters.

363
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,680
But it wasn't just Mario 2, I mean, look at Castlevania.

364
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,920
Look at Simon's Quest versus the original.

365
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
Oh yeah, and I love that game.

366
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,360
I know a lot of people don't like that game either, but I love that game.

367
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,040
I kind of like the weird deviations.

368
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,960
I don't like Adventure of Link, but it's still a fun, interesting deviation.

369
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,920
I thought Adventure of Link was amazing when I was a kid.

370
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:16,680
Yeah, it wasn't nearly the same as Zelda 1, but it was so hard.

371
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,440
And I look back and I go, how did I beat this as a kid?

372
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,720
And it's just hours and hours of practice and staying up late with your friends.

373
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,720
That's what we did.

374
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,040
We stayed up until two in the morning until, you know, our parents woke up screaming like

375
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,720
get to bed, you know, playing these games and getting to know these patterns.

376
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,760
I love those weird sequels.

377
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,760
I don't know why.

378
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,880
I was always drawn to them, even if they're kind of not great.

379
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,560
It's just like, oh, I like that it's different.

380
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,520
I think many, many people consider Mega Man 2 superior to Mega Man 1, which I know it's

381
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,520
not.

382
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
Everybody's going to agree with me on that point.

383
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,000
And Mega Man 1 did have, you know, a lot of things to love about it, but Mega Man 2 kind

384
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,120
of like really perfected the formula.

385
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,960
I'm trying to think what other games were very, very different with the sequels.

386
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,480
I don't know if you would consider Gradius and Life Force, because I guess they technically

387
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,760
then there was a Gradius 2.

388
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,480
I think a lot of people at the time considered Life Force to be Gradius 2 and they were very

389
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,480
different.

390
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,480
Salamander, right?

391
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,560
So if you know the history, there's another one that was extremely different between the

392
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,560
one and the two.

393
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,840
Was it Donkey Kong 2 different or was it Donkey Kong Jr.?

394
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,800
It was Donkey Kong Jr. and sort of, but not really.

395
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,920
But Donkey Kong Jr. and we, I thought Donkey Kong Jr. was more accessible, at least when

396
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,360
we brought this up on the show a few weeks ago, but Donkey Kong Jr. was notable because

397
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,440
it's like the only game where Mario's the villain.

398
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,800
Okay, I don't remember.

399
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,120
At least that's what you think.

400
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:45,000
Unless you consider Mario Party possible, then Mario is certainly the villain for some

401
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,800
people in that game as well.

402
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,560
All right, let's move on.

403
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,920
Shane, how about you?

404
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,880
Greatest NES game for you and why?

405
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:01,320
Probably Mega Man 3 because I remember playing it at Power Fest, Nintendo Power Fest, and

406
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,600
they could not pull me away from playing Top Man's stage or Snake Man's stage.

407
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,600
Those were the two I think you got to play and it just, I was so into Mega Man at that

408
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:16,520
point and my love of Mega Man has never really waned since then, since Mega Man 3, so it's

409
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
my favorite.

410
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,480
What's your favorite stage in Mega Man 3?

411
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:31,680
To play, probably Gemini Man's stage, to listen to Shadow Man's stage.

412
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:36,800
I always liked Snake Man because the level's so cartoony and I remember thinking that when

413
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,800
I was a kid.

414
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,980
I was very impressed with the graphics in Mega Man 2 and 3 because it's like I'm watching

415
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,320
a cartoon on my TV.

416
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,320
It looks so good.

417
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,560
Yeah, like when you were on the big snake and you had to shoot his head and it was going

418
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,560
up and down.

419
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,560
Yes, exactly.

420
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,720
Or like in Bubble Man's stage in Mega Man 2 with the big fish, it was kind of a lot

421
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,720
like that.

422
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,720
Yeah.

423
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,720
Yeah.

424
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,720
All right, that's a good answer, Mega Man 3.

425
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,720
Absolutely.

426
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,720
It is a good answer.

427
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,720
I know there's a lot of people who love Mega Man.

428
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,720
And it's better than 2.

429
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,020
Pissed that Capcom won't go back.

430
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,020
It's close.

431
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,020
No, it's better than 2.

432
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,880
Pissed that Capcom doesn't seem to want to revisit this era?

433
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:16,800
I'm actually, no, I'm not upset about that because I like 9 and 10, but I'm done with

434
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,800
8-bit games.

435
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:23,500
If we're going to make a Mega Man 11, let's at least graduate to the Super Nintendo style

436
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,500
or Mega Man 8.

437
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,500
I love Mega Man 8.

438
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,580
I love everything about 8, especially the bad voice acting.

439
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,580
So if they could do that for him.

440
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,580
Dr. Waiwi.

441
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,580
Yes.

442
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,580
Yes.

443
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,380
Or when he like flubs his lines, but you know, they don't cut it.

444
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,580
They just let him keep going.

445
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,980
Oh, it's so good.

446
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:44,860
Do you think that, I lost my train of thought.

447
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,860
Mighty No. 9.

448
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,800
Mighty Mighty No. 9 is going to prove to be a good successor, like something that you're

449
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,800
looking for?

450
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,880
I'm not looking forward to it at all based on stuff I've seen on it, like video.

451
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,320
It looks soulless for a Mega Man game or a Mega Man ripoff.

452
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,320
Ouch.

453
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,320
Yeah.

454
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,320
Alright.

455
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,320
Loki, how about you?

456
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,680
Yeah, that's tough.

457
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,680
Probably Super Mario Bros. 3?

458
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,520
Just because I was really hyped up about that game even before it came out with the whole

459
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,340
wizard thing.

460
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,060
You know, that was going to be the first time they were showing that off, and it was like,

461
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:24,100
oh my god, this is amazing, and then I played it and it was, oh my god, amazing, and especially

462
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:29,380
like the airship levels and stuff like that were pretty awesome, or the giant world.

463
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:34,700
They hyped that game so fucking good too with the movie, The Wizard, and like, you know,

464
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,180
because that movie was out like a good year before the game.

465
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,060
I don't know if maybe Japan had got that game a lot sooner than we did.

466
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,740
That was probably really the case.

467
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:48,280
You know, we didn't, the internet was not around in the late 80s, so if the game wasn't

468
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,000
out in America, you were none the wiser.

469
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,800
So yeah, there was so much build up to Mario 3, and when you finally got to play it, it

470
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,520
was, oh my god!

471
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,320
And plus, remember in the movie, they show you how to get the warp whistle, and so if

472
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,160
you were paying attention, you knew how to do it in the game.

473
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,160
Yep.

474
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,160
Crazy.

475
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,160
Alright, Mario 3.

476
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,160
I think a lot of people would pick that.

477
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,160
That was one of the big ones.

478
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,980
This might surprise you, because I'm not going to pick The Guardian Legend, even though that

479
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:17,100
is one of my very favorites, but I really think if I were to go back for what was my

480
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:22,180
favorite, my like essential NES game, it really would be The Original Legend of Zelda.

481
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:28,220
I think was really the one that just started it all, and I think in some ways, like, I

482
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,980
really can truly say that game changed my life.

483
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:37,660
I think it did, because, you know, it kind of made me more social in some ways at school,

484
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:41,280
and I know I've kind of brought this up before, that like I was totally like not the cool

485
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,720
kid at school, but then The Legend of Zelda, like, can you imagine that by the way, guys?

486
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,200
I was not a cool kid in school, I know it's hard to believe, but I just wasn't, but when

487
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:56,160
Zelda came out, like then, the guys that would pick on me would suddenly like, so, you know,

488
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,960
after like making fun of me around their friends, then when they had a chance to see me one

489
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,520
on one, alright, so, uh, how do I find the fourth dungeon on the second quest?

490
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,600
That's the best part about it though, is like, there's no direction to it.

491
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,780
And on top of all that, then when you're done, they have a whole completely second quest

492
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,140
to it, and that's like value right there.

493
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:20,020
That would be DLC today, that's the scary thing, that is DLC today, and that was just,

494
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,060
that was like an Easter egg back then, you know?

495
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,500
Well, and then today, like, imagine kids trying to play The Legend of Zelda, like, they're

496
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,460
not gonna know what the fuck to do, like, uh, what do I do?

497
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,460
How do I beat this?

498
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,460
Yeah, I know.

499
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,460
Figure it out.

500
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,460
Stupid.

501
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,820
Well, for me, like, the way I found everything out was magazines.

502
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:42,840
If you were researched, and you really, like, read up on it, you could find all this stuff

503
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,720
out and you just had to, like, be attention, or pay attention and be aware.

504
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,320
And you know, if you read all the magazines and, you know, got that fold-out map and,

505
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:56,480
um, god, uh, you know, the Nintendo Fun Club magazine before there was Nintendo Power,

506
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:03,520
um, and, uh, you know, just weird things like that, you just picked it up, talking to people

507
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:07,540
about games and trading secrets that way, like, that's just kinda like, because of the

508
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:11,500
internet and things like GameFAQs, and I'm not shading GameFAQs, I use that side a lot

509
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:16,060
myself, but we don't need, I mean, it's like, we don't really talk about game strategy anymore,

510
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,060
we don't need to.

511
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:20,140
But, like, I like that game how there's, like, so much hidden stuff and there's no indication

512
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,900
of where it is, there's no, like, cracked walls or anything in most of the places, like,

513
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:28,080
out in the outside, it's just like bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb all the walls.

514
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,360
One in the, one of the dungeons in the second quest, you have to set a tree on fire to get

515
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,900
it to open, right?

516
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,860
Okay, and, like, I think they give you a hint, one of the old ladies on one of the screens

517
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,180
says, like, the tree in the forest holds a secret.

518
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:46,420
Well, there's, like, 5,000 fucking trees in the forest, I mean, what are you supposed

519
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,700
to do, set every single one of them on fire?

520
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,700
Burn the forest down!

521
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,700
So.

522
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,740
Or, like, the invisible walls.

523
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,740
Those were the worst, having to figure out where the invisible walls were and just finding

524
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,740
them by accident.

525
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:05,200
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, a lot of comments here on what I was just

526
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,100
saying about Zelda in chat, Kaijuto says, those fucking Zelda commercials threw me off

527
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,520
the game, they turned me off from it.

528
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,920
Yeah, remember how, like, everything was all hyped up for, like, you know, like, Nintendo

529
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,320
cereal and everything was like, wow, and neon colors, like, but all the commercials from,

530
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,320
like, that era.

531
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,320
That's just the era, yeah.

532
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,640
All the commercials back then were super lame.

533
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,120
I don't even remember, I don't even remember the Legend of Zelda commercial, to be honest

534
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,120
with you.

535
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,120
You don't remember it?

536
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,120
It was a guy in the room going, Zelda!

537
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
Zelda!

538
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,100
Weren't they, like, rapping the names of the enemies or something?

539
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,100
I thought that was it.

540
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,340
But there was that one too, yeah, there was a rapping commercial, there was so many weird

541
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,340
commercials.

542
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,340
Everything was a wrap.

543
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,340
Well, yeah, that's everything.

544
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:47,300
But I just remember the guy just in the room just screaming, Zelda!

545
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,660
It was such a bad commercial.

546
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:54,060
Let's see, Dark Tetsuya says, too used to having their handheld via a tutorial.

547
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:58,040
Why also, I don't want to sound like the get off my lawn gamer either, because there's

548
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:02,760
a lot of great games, and I've razzed games for not having a tutorial, like, remember

549
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:06,480
when I first played Minecraft, I was like, I don't fucking get it, but then when I played

550
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,800
the Xbox 360 one that did hold your hand a little bit, I was like, oh, okay, I get it

551
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,800
now.

552
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
You know?

553
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,320
And that's one of the things, well, to get into that later on, yeah, like, I like some

554
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,340
of the things that they changed in that one, where, like, you know, the crafting stuff's

555
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,680
a lot easier, you don't need to, you know, have to remember every recipe and stuff.

556
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,100
I kind of wish the Windows 10 version was like that again, because, or at least have

557
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,900
the option to turn that on, that would be nice.

558
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,700
Because I don't like having to remember the recipe, especially when there's, like, new

559
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,420
blocks, I'm like, what the hell is this block?

560
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,420
What do I use this for?

561
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,380
I have no idea what the hell I can craft with this.

562
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,820
I guess I could look it up.

563
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:45,020
Let's see, an anonymous chatter in our chat room, 466 says, I'm 30 years old and still

564
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,020
trying to figure out how to get past the first stage in Zelda.

565
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:52,100
Hey, good on you for not just going to Game Facts and cheating, though, but I'll give

566
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,400
you, I'll give you a hint, I'll give you a hint.

567
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:01,280
In the first couple dungeons in Zelda, like, every wall you can bomb through.

568
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,560
Every wall is, like, bombable.

569
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,160
So as long as you have a map, and you can find the map in the dungeon of what it looks

570
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,840
like, like, every wall you can bomb.

571
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,680
Just a little tip there.

572
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:17,400
Let's see, also, what else is in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, SSG100Matt says, I

573
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,900
had no clue how to play Zelda 2 until I read the maps in Nintendo Power.

574
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,580
There you go.

575
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:28,240
Let's see, now, of course, everybody's sharing YouTube clips.

576
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,420
So let me see here.

577
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:35,540
This one is, what is this one, this is the one that Flock was talking about.

578
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:54,520
What even is this?

579
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,760
Is that, like, the guy from, like, what was it, the second Ghostbusters movie or something?

580
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:03,040
You know, the one that was, like, not Vigo, but the guy that was, you know, possessed

581
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,040
by Vigo.

582
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,580
Oh my god.

583
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:11,580
It was seriously, though, that's, like, seriously, uh, PlayStation 3 advertisement material right

584
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,580
there.

585
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,780
I mean, that's just some weird shit.

586
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,660
Giant enemy crabs!

587
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,220
You expect it to go next.

588
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,220
I love it.

589
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,220
All right, thank you guys.

590
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,220
That was great.

591
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:27,820
Uh, so, yeah, I mean, who knows where gaming would be today without the NES?

592
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:31,420
I mean, the NES came out at the end of a huge video game crash.

593
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:36,880
I mean, a lot of people wrote off the game industry as dead because, and it wasn't because

594
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,880
of E.T.

595
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,680
It was not solely because of E.T., and a lot of people kind of mistake that, but it was

596
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:47,360
just these shitty licensed games were coming out by the bucketful, and it's just the marketplace.

597
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,240
God, if only shitty licensed games destroyed an industry, we'd be fucked right now.

598
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,240
Right?

599
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,280
And it's, it's, isn't it weird that that technically can kind of happen now, but it's not, like,

600
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,280
it's just different now.

601
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:03,420
The market's so different now, because, you know, PC is so open-ended, I mean, there is

602
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:08,740
a lot of shit and shovelware out there, but somehow, thanks to the internet, word of mouth,

603
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:12,020
what marketplaces feature, and so forth, we have a way to kind of sort through that, I

604
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,020
think.

605
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:18,100
So, and then when really crappy licensed things come out, like Yaris, you know, we figure

606
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,100
it out.

607
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,100
So, anyway.

608
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,900
All right, let's get into a little more current.

609
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,820
We won't do retro all night long, but we will revisit the Nintendo later in the show.

610
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,880
Frugal question of the week, as well as our list list tonight.

611
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,560
But I want to talk about our gaming weeks, get a little more current with what we've

612
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,560
been playing lately.

613
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,120
So, how is your gaming week?

614
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,120
Dark Sakura, starting with you.

615
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,920
I've been playing on some Dragon Age Inquisition.

616
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:48,040
I've played some Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer, but other than that, I really haven't

617
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:53,320
played a whole lot of much, just because I wanted to finish up my fanfic this week, which

618
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,480
I finally put the last chapter in.

619
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,480
Yay.

620
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,540
If you want to read my shit, tell me.

621
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,140
All right, go visit our chat room.

622
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,740
You can look at Dark Sakura's there.

623
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,660
You can just look up Dark Sakura on Archive of Our Own.

624
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,860
Oh, chapter five, entering the Bone Zone.

625
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,860
Stop it.

626
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,860
Don't write that kind of shit.

627
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,860
All right.

628
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,860
Loki, how was your gaming week?

629
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:22,240
This week, I would consider like the, it's like video game masturbation, it was basically

630
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,240
playing a bunch of games.

631
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,540
You were in the Bone Zone.

632
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,540
Pretty much.

633
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,240
It was pretty much just playing games for like no purpose whatsoever.

634
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,240
Just like I...

635
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,240
You know what games are for?

636
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,740
No, no, I understand that, but like I was trying to find a game that I could get into

637
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,680
and it wasn't really getting into anything.

638
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:41,960
Like I try, I started up, because I have the PC version of Final Fantasy VII, so I started

639
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,780
that up, you know, I was showing my son the game and he asked way too many fucking questions

640
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,780
about it.

641
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:54,060
And honestly, it doesn't seem, it didn't really hold up too well to me.

642
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,460
So I was like, eh, I don't really want to play this.

643
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:02,700
So I started up Final Fantasy VI instead, and I think that held up a lot better, but

644
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,680
once again, he ruined it by asking too many questions about it.

645
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,900
But I may start playing that.

646
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:15,100
I did play a lot of Minecraft for Windows 10, and I don't know, it's okay.

647
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:20,800
It runs well, but I was playing it on survival and I'm just kind of bored with it.

648
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,760
Like there's just no point to it at all.

649
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:28,200
I'm like, eh, I don't, it's not hard to survive and I just don't want to build stuff.

650
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,280
I mean, I don't want to make like this fancy structure or something like that.

651
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:35,720
And I was exploring, you know, caves and stuff and I got all the way down to the bottom there

652
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,960
and then I got knocked into the lava because of some stupid kickback from a zombie.

653
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,280
And I was like, fuck this, I don't want to play this anymore.

654
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,700
But then I went back and played it some more.

655
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:49,200
But it just, I get bored with it so fast and I just kind of lost the point.

656
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,720
Like playing it by yourself is just not as fun as playing it with other people.

657
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,240
And there seems to be like, the fact that it doesn't really have, I mean, it has like

658
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,280
a storyline and what you're supposed to do to kind of beat the game, but there's not

659
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,840
really much motivation to get you to do any of that.

660
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:07,760
And so there's kind of no point without finding something to do with friends.

661
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,040
So that was that.

662
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,040
And then what else did I play?

663
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,480
I think I played a little bit of Mario Maker, but very little.

664
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:18,360
I may have played through the 100 Mario thing and that was it.

665
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,360
Just once.

666
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,760
All right, there it is.

667
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,760
Moving on.

668
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,760
More gaming weeks.

669
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,760
How about you?

670
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,760
Who's got the mic over there?

671
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,760
Flaco.

672
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,760
Hello, I have the mic.

673
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,760
What did I play this week?

674
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,760
What did I play every week?

675
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,760
Splatoon.

676
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
Played a lot more Splatoon.

677
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,160
I'm at B plus 61 on ranked mode.

678
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,160
I just want to get the A minus so bad.

679
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,880
Did they do a big update this week or am I crazy?

680
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,020
I thought they did like a big balancing thing this week.

681
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,360
Was that this week or was it coming?

682
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,240
No, I don't think it's happened yet because I was still owning people with my blaster

683
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,240
this morning.

684
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,240
So that was pretty awesome.

685
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,240
But yeah.

686
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,160
I heard the rollers are getting a nerf and that upset me.

687
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,660
Everybody was getting a nerf.

688
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,600
I just came out to have a good time and I'm feeling very attacked by this.

689
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,720
Yeah, but I bet you don't play rollers like that.

690
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,720
Yeah.

691
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,720
Well, you see me.

692
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,720
You just roll.

693
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,720
You're good.

694
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,720
You're just rolling around.

695
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,720
You're doing the roller thing.

696
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,720
Thank you.

697
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,720
Once I get to know the map.

698
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,720
I know where to roll.

699
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,960
But I know if you just barely clip someone with the side of your roller, you kill them.

700
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,840
I think that's not going to happen anymore.

701
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,920
And, uh, so just, um, like something about the splatter and like, you gotta be right

702
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,320
in the middle of splatter to get them now instead of like getting them with the sides

703
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,320
or something like that.

704
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,320
I don't know.

705
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,320
I don't really play roller.

706
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,320
So I didn't focus on that.

707
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:26,480
I know the blasters splash damage is getting nerfed and I use that in tower control, but

708
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,480
it was great this morning.

709
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,880
I was still shooting at the tower, killing people without even aiming at them.

710
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,880
It was great.

711
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,400
Uh, so yeah, I played that I played, uh, Oh, Shane brought over Soma again last week.

712
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,240
So I'm playing a little bit Soma.

713
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,920
And then that's like the scary game of the now, right?

714
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,800
I guess it's not that scary.

715
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,800
It's cool.

716
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,800
I like the story.

717
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,800
It's really creepy, but it's not scary.

718
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:50,280
I wouldn't say it's really disturbing in places, but I wouldn't call it like a scary game.

719
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,640
So it's not jump scares or anything.

720
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,640
I think I did yell once.

721
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,360
I was like, ah, yeah, I said I did jump once.

722
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,840
Uh, that's a cool game.

723
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:02,000
And then he went and bought Jackbox party pack and brought that over and we played bomb

724
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,760
Corp and it was amazing.

725
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,640
And so, so much so that we were getting obsessed with it.

726
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,920
My wife and I were going to obsess with it.

727
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,720
And so then we add a little credits on our PlayStation accounts like let's just buy it.

728
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,160
So we bought the party back, but always played still as bomb Corp.

729
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,720
So we played that and we got through, I think we got to day six or seven or something.

730
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,520
Can you beat that game or does it just keep going?

731
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,520
I don't know.

732
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:24,240
We've gotten as far as day 10 and then we got, we, we just stopped because we got so

733
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,240
tired.

734
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,240
So we stopped playing.

735
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,400
We were like at the end of day 10 when we just didn't want to try one more time.

736
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,740
I think it's just two weeks cause there's a, there's a great story.

737
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,740
It's really funny.

738
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:35,720
Some of the best like comedy writing I think I've seen in a game.

739
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,860
So it was really funny.

740
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,480
And there's a storyline going on where this guy is there and he's going to be leaving

741
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,240
soon and that's his last day is day 10.

742
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,300
So I assume that's the last day of the game.

743
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,300
Oh, I didn't even know.

744
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,140
I didn't, we didn't even get as far like cause we were playing it.

745
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,900
Me Alan and Shane were all playing it this week and we did.

746
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,780
I, it's not revealed until the second week that this certain characters it's his last

747
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,780
week.

748
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,780
Oh no.

749
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,100
We were exploding on like Wednesday the first week.

750
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,480
Oh, Wednesday is the hardest day.

751
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,480
It's like you get through Monday.

752
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,480
Oh, this is not so bad.

753
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,480
Tuesday.

754
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,480
It's like, okay, a little harder.

755
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,040
Ratches all the way up cause like little kids start writing the clues and you're like, what?

756
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:14,400
Like get the book, like don't cut the wire if it's funky, but cut it if it's cool, but

757
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,400
not if it's wicked.

758
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,400
I'm like, what?

759
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,080
Blues are always wicked and reds are always cool.

760
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,720
I'm like, that doesn't make any sense.

761
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,440
The thing that I wasn't expecting cause you know, we, we had them on the show a couple

762
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,440
of weeks ago.

763
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,440
Right.

764
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,960
And I, I didn't even, I don't remember them even talking about this, but there's more

765
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,880
than just bomb cutting in it because then it's like filing the filing and key pads.

766
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,880
Yeah.

767
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,720
If you file it wrong, then the filing cabinet explodes.

768
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,760
Yeah.

769
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,760
Cause every, it's a warm court.

770
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,760
Everything explodes.

771
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,920
It's like, oh, you know, put this, put the number on the door and by the way, if you

772
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,920
get it wrong, it'll explode.

773
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,920
Uh, yeah.

774
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,920
File these files.

775
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,400
If you get it wrong, the file cabinet will explode.

776
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,400
Just don't question it.

777
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,400
It's just going to happen.

778
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,000
What I love is that if you fuck up, there's, there's like nothing.

779
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,280
There's no like EE, there's no like buzz.

780
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,920
It's just an instant on the TV.

781
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,920
Boom.

782
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
That's it.

783
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,920
You get nothing.

784
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,920
Everybody's like, what just happened?

785
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,920
What did we do wrong?

786
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
I thought we read this.

787
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,920
Oh, my wife's case.

788
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,200
She just gets, cuts the wires.

789
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,680
She's like, we can't decide which wire to cut.

790
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,680
She's like, oh, cut that one.

791
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,680
Sometimes it works.

792
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,680
So it's like, wow, that actually worked.

793
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:11,600
But then a lot of times it doesn't like, no, no, we're going to start all over.

794
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,600
Let's see.

795
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:15,240
So I played Palm Corp, which is amazing.

796
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,720
And I thought I played one more game this week.

797
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,720
Oh yeah.

798
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,720
Yoshi's wooly world.

799
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,160
I bought that and it was, it's really awesome.

800
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:26,220
I played through the entire first area and I'm on the second area now.

801
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,120
So that's where I'm at in that one in the kids love it.

802
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:33,560
We play with mellow mode on the kids and it's pretty cool cause like my son is getting

803
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,020
better at video games and this one he's figuring out pretty quick and like you can hold the

804
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,120
a button and just fly forever.

805
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,120
So you just fly around.

806
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,440
Oh, is that how mellow mode works?

807
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,440
That's how mellow mode works.

808
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,080
Like you have full health, like not all the time.

809
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,300
He still goes down, but you start with completely full hearts all the way.

810
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,480
And then when you press a to jump, you can just fly forever.

811
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,480
You have little wings.

812
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,040
Oh, she has little wings.

813
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,280
Like in Mario world, you could get the wings and fly if I remember right.

814
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,280
Oh, I don't remember.

815
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,280
I don't remember.

816
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,280
Yeah.

817
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,280
Yeah.

818
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,280
Okay.

819
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,280
Yeah.

820
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,280
So it's like that.

821
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,040
But yeah, I think it's a great game.

822
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,160
It's a simple little game, but you know, it's only like 40 bucks.

823
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,520
So I was like, that's great.

824
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,520
So I think that's all I played.

825
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,520
Oh yeah.

826
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,760
And of course, uh, Marvel puzzle quest on my phone because I played it all the time

827
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,760
still.

828
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,240
Uh, somebody posted in my Facebook this week that that came out for PlayStation four and

829
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,240
I had no idea.

830
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,240
Yeah.

831
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,240
Right.

832
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,240
I know.

833
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,240
Are you kidding me?

834
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,240
No, it's on my Facebook.

835
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,200
Oh my gosh.

836
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,200
I have to download that.

837
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Can I transfer my stuff over from face?

838
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,200
I don't know.

839
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,200
Can you, can you, I don't know.

840
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,440
You can save your stuff on Facebook cause I switched phones.

841
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:39,920
I switched from an Android phone to an iPhone and I was able to switch my stuff over.

842
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,200
I might have to play again at least.

843
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,260
Well, I left your guilt.

844
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,260
So whatever.

845
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,260
Yeah, I can.

846
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,520
I went to a place where people actually played.

847
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,680
No, it's now I get so much more bonus stuff and it makes me want to play more.

848
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,680
So that's fair.

849
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,680
Yeah.

850
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,680
I'm getting lots of good covers.

851
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,680
It's great.

852
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,680
I love that game.

853
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,680
We have a vog community on PS four now.

854
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,480
Maybe I can scrape together enough people to maybe, I don't know, but if it's the same

855
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,760
information that I would still be in my same Alliance, maybe Rob didn't abandon me like

856
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,760
you did.

857
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,760
I don't know what that would be on.

858
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:11,080
No, I think he, I think he was the only one still playing, uh, but maybe I don't know

859
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,080
how that would play on a PS.

860
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,960
I guess you just move the control around and swap the gems.

861
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,960
It's not like there's a timer.

862
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,760
So I mean, puzzle quest was originally on the three 60.

863
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,760
Okay.

864
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,760
So there you go.

865
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,760
I never had a three 60.

866
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,760
So all right.

867
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,760
There you go.

868
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,840
Uh, Shane, how was your gaming week?

869
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,400
Basically all you have to do is rewind the episode to where Jim started talking and that's

870
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,400
my week too.

871
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,360
Cause we played the same thing.

872
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,880
Well, what are, what are your impressions on some of the things you talked about?

873
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:38,440
Like Yoshi's wooly world because that game is so amazing.

874
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,680
I love that game.

875
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,120
I love you guys aren't even talking about anything else cause we haven't played anything

876
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,120
else yet.

877
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:49,760
We just went straight to bomb Corp and it is seriously like probably my favorite Jack

878
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,760
box game.

879
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,560
I think it might be better than you don't know Jack for me at least.

880
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,760
Um, it's actually funnier, which is hard to top.

881
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:03,640
I do like that it's, it's very different and you know, we brought this up a couple of weeks

882
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,640
ago and we had them on too.

883
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,040
It's kind of was breaking the formula that you could kind of start to see in the first

884
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,480
game where it was not, not that it was bad.

885
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,480
I mean it works.

886
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,400
All those games are a lot of fun, but it was like everybody does this and then everybody

887
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,120
votes on result.

888
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,200
But bomb Corp is very different than that.

889
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,200
And I thought that was cool.

890
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:24,160
Um, I would do think though that bomb Corp is not for everybody because without naming

891
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:32,600
names, Rob, some people got frustrated while playing and it's a very frustrating game.

892
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,240
But it's, you don't want to see me heated.

893
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,720
I swear if we were to live stream bomb Corp, Oh my gosh, we couldn't, but we, we would

894
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,120
have to get, who are some ultra competitive people that I know, but it's not, it's cooperative.

895
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,120
That's why it's nice.

896
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,960
That's why it's like when you get the people to get really into it.

897
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,840
And you didn't even get to meet Kyle yet.

898
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,520
Kyle is exploding on Wednesday.

899
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,960
No, we got through Wednesday I thought because yeah, we got through Wednesday.

900
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,960
I don't know.

901
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,960
Yeah.

902
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:03,680
You didn't make it to like making coffee, which also explodes and the copy machine.

903
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,680
Yeah.

904
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,160
The copy machine's pretty good too.

905
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,240
Um, then Yoshi's wooly world.

906
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,240
I really like it.

907
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,520
It's so adorable.

908
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:17,160
I've got stars on all of the stages in the first world and I'd be one S which is ridiculous

909
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:25,320
to try to get everything in that and I'm on world two that's as far as I got, um, there's

910
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,320
my week.

911
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:32,840
I play a lot of Pokemon shuffle on my phone constantly, constantly dark soccer.

912
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,680
I'll get to it when I get to your week.

913
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,680
Okay.

914
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,680
Then my week.

915
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,160
Well, I'm only gonna talk about one game cause I got you something.

916
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,160
You did.

917
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,160
Oh yeah.

918
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,160
I didn't get around to playing it yet.

919
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,160
Yes.

920
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,160
Uh, but you did.

921
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,440
You bought me on steam, uh, uh, pigeon sex, the game.

922
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,440
That's what it is, right?

923
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,440
Hot to full boyfriend.

924
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,440
Yes.

925
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,120
Cause Rob has to see the crackness.

926
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,120
I want to play it.

927
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,000
I want to, I want to do a stream of it.

928
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,240
Make sure you do it though with the, um, the story playthroughs so that you can get a hateful

929
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,240
boyfriend.

930
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,240
Okay.

931
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,240
I will.

932
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,240
I will.

933
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,600
Uh, but I sadly, I did not get to enjoy that yet cause um, I had a pretty busy weekend

934
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:12,280
which we'll talk about in a minute, but um, I did play Yoshi's wooly world as well.

935
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,560
And I just want to talk about that game real quick because I wasn't going to get it originally

936
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:19,080
because I was like, you know, I don't know if, I don't know if it's really my thing,

937
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:23,800
but then Shane did his Shane thing where he was like, I could get it at a discount Rob

938
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,600
and you know, you're going to want the green amiibo and it's the only way I'm interrupting.

939
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,040
That was also part of our gaming week that neither me nor Jim talked about as we waited

940
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:37,040
in line at Best Buy for Yoshi's wooly world and the amiibo and the line consisted of just

941
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,040
us.

942
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,040
Oh my God.

943
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,040
No.

944
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,040
So nobody's lining up for amiibo anymore.

945
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,040
Yeah.

946
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,040
Yeah.

947
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,760
There was some people that showed up right at the end, but no, they only got like eight

948
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,320
of each color too.

949
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,800
So, um, and then some of the bundles, but yeah, we were in the store when I texted you

950
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,280
to see if you wanted it.

951
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,280
Yeah.

952
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,460
They're not continuing your story.

953
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:01,480
By texting me to see if I wanted it, meaning convincing me that I need it.

954
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,480
I will.

955
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,640
I will pull up my phone and see exactly what I said so you can see that.

956
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,880
But also then again, you did get Marth today and you said you didn't want any of the Fire

957
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,880
Emblem amiibo.

958
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,000
And then I was like, Oh, maybe I don't.

959
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Marth looks kind of cool.

960
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,680
I'll regret not getting him if I don't get him.

961
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,680
Yes.

962
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,680
I got my 35th amiibo today.

963
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,600
I got Marth today.

964
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:25,000
He got me some stupid tracker program on, on the iPhone that you can use to track like

965
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
what you have in your collection.

966
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,000
There's a tracker?

967
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Yeah.

968
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,560
I was like, I'm going to get to that point where I'm going to buy an amiibo and then

969
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,800
get home and be fucking pissed that I already own it.

970
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,480
I thought it was bad that I had, I think I have 16 now.

971
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:41,960
I have 35 and like I would, I would say 20, 25 of them have been in the past month because

972
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,960
of Shane.

973
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,960
Just, just putting it out there.

974
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,960
Oh, that's cool.

975
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,560
So anyway, Yoshi's wooly world where this whole thing was starting, right?

976
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:53,000
Um, I, I was very pleasantly surprised with Yoshi's wooly world.

977
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,560
I didn't think I'd like it, but I think it's a very solid platforming experience.

978
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:04,320
Um, it is, it is essentially Super Mario world to Yoshi's Island, but just now in this yarn

979
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,360
environment, which looks gorgeous.

980
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:10,640
I didn't, I didn't know how I would enjoy that, but, um, it does look really good.

981
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,680
It's still, I don't know, it's still a little weird for me.

982
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,200
I'm like, why is Yoshi a ball of yarn?

983
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,200
I don't get it.

984
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,520
But then I think, okay, if I was like seven or eight years old, this would be my favorite

985
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:25,760
game hands down because just, you know, the solid platforming elements of it, the, the

986
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,120
look of the game and those mechanics and so forth.

987
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:34,280
Like I just, I, I would love this if I was seven and I actually really like it at 30

988
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:40,120
seven, I think it's a very solid platformer and kind of hard, like not, I mean, you can

989
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,320
get from start to finish in the stages.

990
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,320
Pretty easy.

991
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:47,120
It's not that hard, but like, Oh my God, there's so much to complete.

992
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:53,200
There's the flowers, there's the yarn, there's the now instead of red coins, it's the Miiverse

993
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,280
stamps and they're all hidden in the levels amongst the regular gems or whatever it is.

994
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,600
And then there's the, you got to get to the end with full health.

995
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:05,480
I mean, to get a star on a level that's actually kind of hard and also infuriating when you're

996
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:11,640
just missing one goddamn Miiverse token to get a star on the whole damn level.

997
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:20,000
So I, I'm kind of surprised at how much depth the game has to be a very difficult game.

998
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,160
For a game that looks like a kiddie game, you know what I mean?

999
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,520
So yeah, I, I'm really enjoying Yoshi's Willy world.

1000
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:33,720
And with the amiibo, I thought that was a cute tie-in because all it really is, you can in the game,

1001
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:39,480
as you go through, if you get all the yarn in each level, there's five hidden chunks of yarn.

1002
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,280
You can build one of Yoshi's missing friends.

1003
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,200
For example, you might get Moo Moo Yoshi in one level.

1004
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,760
That's a cow and it's adorable.

1005
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,760
I mean, it really is.

1006
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,760
Right.

1007
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,760
I like the watermelon Yoshi.

1008
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,760
Oh yeah.

1009
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,760
It's adorable.

1010
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,760
The circus Yoshi looks like a butthole to me.

1011
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:55,560
Like, I don't know why they have, that looks really offensive.

1012
00:42:55,600 --> 00:43:03,640
I'm just saying, um, but what my, the sunflower one, the very first one you got, we're not

1013
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,640
going to get into that.

1014
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,640
Why?

1015
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,640
All right.

1016
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,640
And then, um, what was I going to say?

1017
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,120
Uh, Oh, the amiibo.

1018
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:13,920
So the amiibo unlock different skins for the Yoshi as well, that kind of look like the

1019
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,460
character of the amiibo.

1020
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,180
And some of them are really bad.

1021
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:20,440
Like the Mr. Game and Watch is just a solid black Yoshi.

1022
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,640
Like how boring is that?

1023
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,140
Blackface Yoshi.

1024
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,480
That's that's tacky.

1025
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:30,040
Um, but the mega man one is super cute and it makes it like actually get like these little

1026
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,520
like ears and so forth.

1027
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,200
Uh, and the Sonic one is actually my favorite one.

1028
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,200
Just like that blue is really cute.

1029
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,200
That was my favorite.

1030
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,040
I don't have Sonic, but I saw that one on YouTube and I'm like, that is amazing.

1031
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,040
Looking at the red shoes.

1032
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,040
It's just blue with red shoes, but it has the coloration of like, you know, his body

1033
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,040
a little bit too.

1034
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,040
It's so awesome.

1035
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:51,080
That's awesome that they support, you know, amiibos from other games, unlike Splatoon

1036
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,080
that does not.

1037
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,800
Well, the weird thing is it pretty much does run with all the amiibo.

1038
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,800
It even works with the Splatoon amiibo.

1039
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,880
Duck Hunt Dog was my other favorite one, by the way, because actually no Pokemon.

1040
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,660
There's no Pokemon.

1041
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:06,120
And I don't know if that's because there's an issue, a game freak where it's like, we

1042
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,920
don't want our characters to look different or something.

1043
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,880
I have a weird feeling that's what comes into play where it's like, no, Pikachu is Pikachu

1044
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,880
and Yoshi's not allowed to look like Pikachu.

1045
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,600
I just, but yeah, the Pokemon don't work.

1046
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,600
I know.

1047
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,600
I know.

1048
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Very weird.

1049
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,200
Go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

1050
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,920
Kaijuto says, little big planet is yarn, should be used to yarn by now.

1051
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:30,920
Is it?

1052
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,280
I don't remember it being yarn.

1053
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,280
It's more like fabric.

1054
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,280
It's more, it's fabric.

1055
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,280
It's not yarn.

1056
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,280
Yeah.

1057
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,280
No, what's yarn?

1058
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,280
It's literal sackcloth.

1059
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,280
It's not yarn.

1060
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,280
Yeah, it's like cloth.

1061
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,280
It's canvas.

1062
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,280
Yeah.

1063
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,280
It's a rough burlap.

1064
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,720
It's a trip to Joanne's fabrics, but you know, it's a little bit different.

1065
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,720
I don't know.

1066
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:52,000
SSJ100Matt says, I'm close to buying a pink yarn Yoshi for my girlfriend.

1067
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,160
She doesn't own a Wii U, but she'll think it's cute.

1068
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,600
I got to say those yarn Yoshi are done pretty darn well.

1069
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,680
Those little yarn Yoshi amiibo, which the pink one is probably the only one you're going

1070
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:04,400
to be able to find at this point, but they are really cute.

1071
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,600
So all right, there it is.

1072
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,640
That's going to do it for my gaming week.

1073
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,640
Quickly some housekeeping.

1074
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,040
We are going to be here for the next few weeks, although it sounds like we may not be here

1075
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,840
Thanksgiving week, but I bet a lot of you guys probably won't be either, so that probably

1076
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,840
won't be a big issue.

1077
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:24,320
We'll get you posted on that a little closer to November.

1078
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:29,660
Also we will be, Dark Soccer and I will be at GamerX in December in San Jose, so look

1079
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,660
forward to that.

1080
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:33,160
We were going to have a little table, which we're still trying to figure out what we're

1081
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,160
going to do with it.

1082
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,340
If you guys have suggestions, you should let us know, but I think I know what we might

1083
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,340
do.

1084
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:42,700
And then I just want to say like on a totally selfish, like unrelated note, but I have to

1085
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,380
get this out of my system.

1086
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,220
I was very honored yesterday.

1087
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:50,420
This has nothing to do with games, so I apologize, but we had a convention here in Sacramento,

1088
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:53,820
Sinister Creature Con yesterday, which was a first year con.

1089
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:57,860
And it was pretty cool because they had like all the, it was a very random assortment of

1090
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:58,860
guests.

1091
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:02,700
Like they had a Kristen Bauer, I think her name is, she's Maleficent on Once Upon a Time

1092
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,060
and she was in True Blood.

1093
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,180
She's pretty cool.

1094
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:10,740
And they had like some of the cast from Terror Vision and the kid from Pet Sematary was all

1095
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:11,740
there.

1096
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:15,540
And they also had three of the actors from the Rocky Horror Picture Show were there.

1097
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:20,220
Barry Bostwick, who played Brad, Lil Nel, who played Columbia and Patricia Quinn, who

1098
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,220
played Magenta, were actually-

1099
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,220
Dame Patricia.

1100
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,820
Lady Stevens, I think is, she's Lady.

1101
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:25,820
Lady.

1102
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:27,700
I thought she was, I thought she was Dame, Dame.

1103
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:28,700
Mm-mm.

1104
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,700
Okay.

1105
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:30,700
That's Dame Edna.

1106
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:31,700
No, I'm just kidding.

1107
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:32,700
No, but no-

1108
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:33,700
Who was in Shock Treatment.

1109
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,700
I'll have to double check now because I thought she was.

1110
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,700
I thought she was Lady.

1111
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:40,860
But anyway, she is a Lady, but I will say this, and you guys that might know my history with

1112
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:44,900
podcasting know that before I was doing Orange L'Andrea, I was doing a show called Under

1113
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:48,100
Sedation Live, which is still on, but not for much longer.

1114
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,100
It was only-

1115
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,100
She is Lady.

1116
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,100
She is Lady.

1117
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,100
I didn't know that.

1118
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,100
Okay.

1119
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,100
Oh no, I'm sorry.

1120
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:55,100
Yes.

1121
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,100
I did know that.

1122
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,100
All right.

1123
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,100
Stop confusing me.

1124
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:01,780
So before I was doing this, I was doing Under Sedation Live, which was about Rocky Horror

1125
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,860
and I was big into that community.

1126
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,060
So I was really honored.

1127
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:10,060
I got to host the panel at this convention, a 40th anniversary celebratory panel with

1128
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:14,460
these celebrities and I got to talk to them and introduce myself backstage and we actually

1129
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,540
got to actually have this panel where we ask questions.

1130
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,580
It was really well received.

1131
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:23,420
So I just wanted to thank Sinister Creature Con for that experience because in some ways,

1132
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:28,260
and I know this has nothing to do with gaming, but it kind of brings a lot of my hobbies

1133
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:30,220
and things like that full circle.

1134
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:35,260
To get to do that was just awesome and really put a point.

1135
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:40,980
And it also showed me that maybe someday here on OLR, we can get some of the big gaming

1136
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,520
celebrities I've always wanted to have on the show.

1137
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,780
Like me personally, I want to have Sid Meier on someday because you all know how I feel

1138
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,140
about civilization.

1139
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,140
So that would be one of my dream guests.

1140
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:51,940
Do you guys have any dream guests for OLR?

1141
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:54,380
Like somebody we have to interview before we throw in the towel?

1142
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:57,780
Reggie Fils-Aime, I think is on the bucket list.

1143
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:01,780
Reggie would be funny.

1144
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:05,500
I don't know.

1145
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:06,860
Let's get Troy Baker.

1146
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:07,860
Troy Baker.

1147
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,500
Or what was his name?

1148
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,980
We get a lot of awesome voice.

1149
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,620
We have another voice actor on the show tonight.

1150
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:14,620
Why not?

1151
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:15,620
We're getting Tara Strong.

1152
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:17,260
Let's get Tara Strong as well.

1153
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,260
Do all three of them.

1154
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:19,260
Why not?

1155
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:20,420
How about you Darcyra?

1156
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:21,860
It's got to be something Bioware.

1157
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:22,860
Jennifer Hale.

1158
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:27,220
Well, yeah, that would be cool, but I would actually like to get concept designers.

1159
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:28,220
Okay.

1160
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:33,020
Some of the actual people who work on the artwork who come up.

1161
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:35,140
Actually I'd like Patrick Weeks.

1162
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:41,500
I'd like some of the other writers at Bioware to come in.

1163
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:46,900
Let's get Gabe Newell and he'll just announce Half-Life 3, but no one will know because

1164
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,900
no one listens to the show.

1165
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:50,900
That's right.

1166
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,980
And no one's going to believe us anyways.

1167
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:54,480
No one would believe us.

1168
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,800
This dog and pony show known as Orange Lounge Radio that's dedicated to DDR, because they

1169
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:04,720
just checked the website that's a little bit out of date, and says that Half-Life 3 could

1170
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,560
claim to have Gabe on their show and that Half-Life 3 did.

1171
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,560
Sure they did.

1172
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,560
Sure they did.

1173
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:13,120
But to be perfectly serious, I'd like some of the people who work behind the scenes who

1174
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:18,400
maybe don't get the big recognition to come on the show and talk about what they do.

1175
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,320
I think that there needs to be a bigger respect for the concept artists, for the design, for

1176
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,480
the level layout, the music designers.

1177
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:29,300
People need to, I think, hear about their contributions into the games that they like

1178
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,200
instead of just the people at the top of the food chain.

1179
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:36,760
Or just like Charles Martinet to have him do all the voices.

1180
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:37,760
I would love that.

1181
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:38,760
I was being serious.

1182
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,600
No, I know, I know.

1183
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,600
Let's see.

1184
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,120
Going to our chat room, actually I love this answer, this is a completely serious answer

1185
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,120
too.

1186
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,120
Dungeon Buster, Richard Garriott.

1187
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,120
Yes.

1188
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,120
Oh my god, yes.

1189
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,040
I love hearing that man speak at conventions.

1190
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,200
I would love to have Lord British on the show.

1191
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,240
Anyway, there it is, bucket list guests.

1192
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,900
If you happen to know any contacts for any of these people, tell them about our little

1193
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:05,840
dog and pony show and that we're a safe place to talk about whatever, because nobody listens.

1194
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,600
I know who you need to get on here.

1195
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:08,600
Who?

1196
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,320
Mega Man.

1197
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,320
Just actual Mega Man?

1198
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,320
Just Mega Man, yeah.

1199
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,320
Just actual Mega Man?

1200
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,760
He's been in a lot of games, so he would probably have a lot to talk about.

1201
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,400
Well, he's probably pretty bored right now, actually.

1202
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,760
Yeah, you could have talked about his-

1203
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:18,760
He's unemployed.

1204
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:19,760
He's unemployed right now.

1205
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,160
You could talk about his little known soccer career.

1206
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,160
There you go.

1207
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,160
Yeah.

1208
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,160
Yeah.

1209
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,160
We'll get Mega Man on the show.

1210
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,160
We'll work on that.

1211
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:30,240
All right, let's get into some gaming news for the week.

1212
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,000
We still have a pretty, it was a pretty slow news week, admittedly, but we still have a

1213
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,880
lot of ground to cover, so Loki's starting us off, I think, with some rumors, yes?

1214
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,780
Of course.

1215
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:45,640
It's another week, so there's another week of Nintendo NX rumors, and this week's rumor

1216
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:52,160
is that the dev kits are going out, which I guess that makes sense since, you know,

1217
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,800
isn't this supposed to be coming out next year or something like that?

1218
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,200
I mean, 2016's the year of gaming, right?

1219
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:04,920
Yeah, so unfortunately, we don't know too much about it, but apparently, people are

1220
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:09,640
seeing the dev kits, and they're saying that it's kind of a combination of like a portable

1221
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:12,440
and home console combined.

1222
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,200
I don't know.

1223
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,920
So it's an all-in-one combo system.

1224
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,960
Something like that, yes.

1225
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:25,640
So yeah, and they're basically saying that, you know, it could be that there's a secondary

1226
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:31,440
piece of the NX that could be like a Wii U gamepad or handheld or something like that,

1227
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,440
so they're not sure.

1228
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:35,400
I'm wondering if they're like thinking it's, I don't know, because I always thought they

1229
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,480
would be cool if the gamepad could be like a portable system, so maybe that's kind of

1230
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:44,040
what they're doing with that, where it is, it's like a, you know, 3DS hardware built

1231
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:48,440
into it or something, I don't know.

1232
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,440
I guess we'll see.

1233
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:54,960
I hope it's good, and the other rumor I saw was it's cutting edge, you know, technology

1234
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:00,640
or something like that, so I hope that's true, because I would love to see like another kind

1235
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,120
of Wii, you know, disturbance thing, you know, where they just kind of...

1236
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,840
Okay, here's the thing with that, though.

1237
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:10,320
I just want to caution people, because some people that are reading really a lot into

1238
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,240
that are forgetting something very important.

1239
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:18,000
When the Wii U was announced, when the Wii U came out, the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox

1240
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
One were not out yet.

1241
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,640
Remember, the Wii U got a one-year head start on the others.

1242
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:27,640
The Wii U was ahead of the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, but not by much.

1243
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:28,640
You know what I mean?

1244
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,800
It didn't ultimately end up mattering, so I just, I want to caution people to get too

1245
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:35,080
excited about that.

1246
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,080
Not necessarily.

1247
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,840
It wasn't ahead of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

1248
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:45,240
It was supposed to be, spec-wise, maybe stronger than them, but it still can't run the engines

1249
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,800
that even those systems can run.

1250
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,440
Like it can't do Frostbite, for example, that's why you don't have a lot of those, you know,

1251
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,200
Battlefield games and stuff like that on there.

1252
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,900
It just can't run them.

1253
00:52:55,900 --> 00:53:01,280
So I don't think, even though the specs may be up there, it's just, it's not able to run...

1254
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,320
It's about equivalent to those systems, maybe.

1255
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,360
You know what's interesting, though?

1256
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:10,400
If it is one of these handheld and combo, well, you know, Nintendo's always been very

1257
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,400
good about backwards compatible games, and we've always kind of been wondering, like,

1258
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,800
how's Wii U's successor going to emulate Wii U games?

1259
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,560
Well, if it does end up being a combo system, that's going to emulate Wii U games pretty

1260
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,840
easy, isn't it?

1261
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,720
Because the game pad or whatever would be like your...

1262
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:30,340
It sounds to me like it's a more powerful Wii U where the game pad truly works anywhere,

1263
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,400
or by itself, essentially.

1264
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,280
Like you could take it and use it anywhere as its own system.

1265
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:40,920
It would be nice to take that someplace and be able to play games on it and then bring

1266
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,920
it back home.

1267
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,160
But I'm curious if it couldn't be, like, separated as well.

1268
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:49,960
Like, does that mean Nintendo is going to sell a console and, I mean, are they going

1269
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:51,960
to sell it separately or are they going to sell it as a combo?

1270
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:52,960
I don't know.

1271
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,960
It's just a lot of unanswered questions.

1272
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:54,960
We'll see, I guess.

1273
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:55,960
Yeah.

1274
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:56,960
I don't...

1275
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:03,200
Like, you know, usually I'm like, rumors, whatever, but a lot of this seems like a logical

1276
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,660
next step for Nintendo.

1277
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:11,920
It's interesting, though, that when some people are like, the Wii U was not, you know, very

1278
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,120
successful, it's interesting that they're going to go all in on it, essentially.

1279
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,120
I hope they do.

1280
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,560
This is the vision for it.

1281
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:23,680
Please, God, have someone that knows what they're doing network-wise because, like,

1282
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:28,040
seriously, this, like, antiquated bullshit, you know, where they're just starting to figure

1283
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:31,560
out how to do all this stuff, that needs to end.

1284
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,920
They need to, like, forget that happened and be on board with what's going on now.

1285
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,280
Well, and one big thing they'll end up doing that's going to put it in a huge position,

1286
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,600
you know they're going to change the name, drastically.

1287
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,280
The new name will not be Wii anything.

1288
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:46,760
It's going to be a brand new something we haven't thought of.

1289
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,320
It could be another made-up word.

1290
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:52,280
It could be another very simple thing like Wii, but it's not going to be NX.

1291
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:54,320
These development names never stick.

1292
00:54:54,320 --> 00:55:00,040
So, it could be another, like, weird simple made-up word, but it could be like the Nintendo

1293
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:04,320
Go, because it's on the go.

1294
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,760
It could be something very simple.

1295
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,760
No, please don't.

1296
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:07,760
We had a PSP Go.

1297
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,760
That's true.

1298
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,760
Nintendo.

1299
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,760
Nintendo!

1300
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:18,160
I always thought they should just go back to its roots and just call it a Nintendo

1301
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,040
Entertainment System.

1302
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,040
Why not?

1303
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,880
They're always playing the Nintendo.

1304
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,880
That's right.

1305
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:24,880
Take that word back.

1306
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,880
All right.

1307
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:30,520
Act deft and chat says Nintendo Go, Pokemon Go, oh God.

1308
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:33,840
You know, though, if this handheld device is something that works anywhere, imagine

1309
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,000
what if it has cellular capability in it.

1310
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
It might.

1311
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
It will probably at least be Wi-Fi.

1312
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Oh my God.

1313
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,440
Imagine how many pedophiles are going to have access to your children.

1314
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,600
Oh God.

1315
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,600
But it, it, it, the other interesting thing, and I have to get this out of my system, the

1316
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:52,560
other very interesting thing about the fact, if the tech is superior to PlayStation 4 and

1317
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:57,640
Xbox One and meaning like by a significant amount, it's going to be interesting if

1318
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:04,320
Nintendo forces this cycle to move faster than Sony and Microsoft originally planned.

1319
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,980
Because that could be a very interesting side effect of this.

1320
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:11,320
If Nintendo is very successful with this and people start developing games for Nintendo

1321
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:18,040
system that won't work on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, it's going to force the PlayStation

1322
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:23,020
5 and the Microsoft successor out faster than maybe they intended.

1323
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:26,520
And I know I'm being very tinfoil hat-ish right now, but I think that could be a very

1324
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:27,520
interesting side effect.

1325
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,520
If Nintendo is successful.

1326
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:29,960
No, I don't think so.

1327
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:33,480
I don't think it's going to affect anything because they're all kind of doing their own

1328
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:34,480
thing.

1329
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:40,160
I mean, we'll see where the VR stuff goes because what if that takes off and then who,

1330
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,160
I don't know.

1331
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,200
I don't know really where it's going to go.

1332
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,200
We'll just have to wait and see.

1333
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:46,400
That's what's kind of fun about it.

1334
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:51,960
Let's wait and see and have no expectations so we can't be let down because they will

1335
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:52,960
do that.

1336
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,960
Alright.

1337
00:56:53,960 --> 00:57:01,320
Well, otherwise, it's just rumors and we'll find out when we hear at E3 2016.

1338
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:05,080
It seems inevitable that this is going to be a huge highlight of the show.

1339
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:11,080
Well, a little sooner than next year's E3, Halo 5 is going to come out really soon.

1340
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:14,840
Halo 5 is out, what, just a couple of weeks, right?

1341
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:20,960
There is some free DLC available for Halo 5 and you actually don't need, well, obviously

1342
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,960
it's free because you don't need to spend any money on it, but you do have to spend

1343
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,480
a little bit of time.

1344
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:29,640
So there's an interactive site that 343 Industries and Microsoft has put out there where your

1345
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:36,240
Master Chief versus Spartan Lock and there's five videos dedicated to each person's point

1346
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,240
of view.

1347
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:42,400
You sit through the ten, and they're less than ten second clips, I guess, you are rewarded

1348
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,560
with a free Rec Pack.

1349
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,640
That's Halo 5's microtransactions.

1350
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:52,680
They're two dollars, I guess, but 343 swears, you get the currency fast enough you don't

1351
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,880
have to necessarily spend actual money.

1352
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,040
So why even make it a microtransaction in the first place?

1353
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,480
Because you're willing to spend the money.

1354
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,920
They aren't incentivizing you to buy that stuff.

1355
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:08,000
I'm sure people that are super into Halo and the lore anyway are going to sit through this

1356
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,320
what adds up to what, like three minutes worth of videos.

1357
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:15,600
So it's fine, I don't think it's too big a video.

1358
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:19,760
I am all for a little extra something for free.

1359
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:25,960
But yeah, hopefully you're not having to spend a lot of money on top of the $60 as it is

1360
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,960
already.

1361
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:32,780
Bonds006 in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, dear room, I want that damn new Halo

1362
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:33,780
game.

1363
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:34,820
A lot of people do.

1364
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:36,260
I don't think you are alone in that.

1365
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:37,260
Just saying.

1366
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:38,260
You're in good company.

1367
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:39,260
DarkSakura.

1368
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:42,220
Well, we love our Humble Bundle, don't we?

1369
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:46,660
Yes, I just bought the Capcom one this week.

1370
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:47,660
So did I.

1371
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:49,180
Dan already had like most of the games in it.

1372
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:51,980
I didn't even mention that during my game of the week, but I played Ultra Street Fighter

1373
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:52,980
4 on my PC.

1374
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:53,980
Cool.

1375
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:56,620
I forgot to mention the game I played, but I'm not going to mention it though.

1376
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:58,860
So I actually had a developer give me a game.

1377
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:00,820
Oh, well, then don't bring it up.

1378
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:01,820
All right.

1379
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:02,820
Oh, so did I.

1380
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:06,860
I was given a game too, but I haven't started it yet.

1381
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:09,860
Well, everybody here is special but me.

1382
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:17,060
Well, Humble Bundle, as a lot of us know, they do the pay what you want for games, and

1383
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:24,220
you can have the money be distributed between the developer, Humble Bundle, or the charity.

1384
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:30,860
Well, they actually, I think, have been bitten a little bit in the butt by this because they

1385
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:34,900
had to let go some of their employees.

1386
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:43,780
They just, it says that their hiring was too ambitious and they had to make a hard call.

1387
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:52,580
It says that they let off, let about 12 people go, which, I mean, 12 people is a lot for

1388
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:54,260
a smaller company.

1389
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:58,220
So I would say that if you don't want to see this happening, then make sure that you

1390
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:02,860
just contribute a little bit more fundage toward them.

1391
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:09,620
I try to make sure that I split things about 50-50 between Humble Bundle and the charity

1392
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:14,380
if it's a developer that I'm pissed off at.

1393
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,540
Usually I'll do them in equal thirds.

1394
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:19,780
So that's it.

1395
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:28,020
Yeah, I guess sometimes even companies that are very charitable can end up in these predicaments,

1396
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:33,780
especially if it's true that they were overstaffed, but, you know, they do a lot of good stuff

1397
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:37,140
out there, especially with the charity work, so it's difficult to hear about this, but

1398
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:42,260
I understand if it's too heavy, then they're not able to effectively give the money to

1399
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:43,260
the charities.

1400
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,260
So, yeah, that could be bad.

1401
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:47,460
So, all right.

1402
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:48,460
Moving on.

1403
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:49,460
Loki.

1404
01:00:49,460 --> 01:00:50,460
All right.

1405
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:54,660
And so, funny enough, I was looking at Ingress and now I'm talking about the company that

1406
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,820
makes Ingress, Niantic.

1407
01:00:56,820 --> 01:01:02,500
They've got some funding now for Pokemon Go thanks to Nintendo and the Pokemon Company.

1408
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:04,780
$20 million!

1409
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:08,620
That's definitely going to help them out and it'll be interesting to see how they use that

1410
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:16,820
money to make this kind of, I don't know, real world Pokemon game.

1411
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:21,300
Along with that, though, they said with the $20 million investment, apparently if they're

1412
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:28,380
eligible to make another $10 million, if they meet its milestones as well.

1413
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:31,900
So they could essentially make $30 million off Pokemon Go.

1414
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:35,420
When I don't, you know, and people ask, how do they make money off Ingress?

1415
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:36,420
I don't know.

1416
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:37,420
I don't know.

1417
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:40,060
Well, it was a Google project for the longest time and Google, I don't, how's Google funding

1418
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:41,700
the self-driving cars?

1419
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:45,780
They just, they have money in the bank that they're spending on these pet projects.

1420
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:51,020
But now that Niantic's more off on their own, you know, they're having to, I guess, come

1421
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:54,340
up with the other funding, although, you know, again, just to acknowledge Ingress does

1422
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:55,820
have like sponsorships in it.

1423
01:01:55,820 --> 01:02:00,700
Some of the names of the items are called like named after companies, but it's just

1424
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:01,700
a few.

1425
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:06,060
There's not a lot, but there was one, uh, like about six months ago, every Jamba Juice

1426
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:08,460
was a portal, but then they removed that.

1427
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:10,340
The Jamba Juices are no longer all portals.

1428
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:11,660
Yeah, I know.

1429
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:12,660
Right.

1430
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:15,860
Used to, uh, used to be an excuse for me to go get one of those pumpkin smoothies, but

1431
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:16,860
whatever.

1432
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:19,580
So, uh, yeah, I don't know.

1433
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:23,420
Well, I know a lot of people that are really excited about Pokemon Go.

1434
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:26,580
Uh, Shane, you're a big Pokemon fan.

1435
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:29,820
Are you going to check out Pokemon Go, especially now that you've actually dabbled in Ingress

1436
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:30,820
a little bit?

1437
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:31,820
Yeah, I'll try it.

1438
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:32,820
Yeah.

1439
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:36,060
Um, I want to see like how ridiculous it is.

1440
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:41,180
So like, will I have to drive to Montana to get to a certain Pokemon or will everything

1441
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:45,220
kind of be available around me or how it's going to work?

1442
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:49,100
I just need more details before I really feel like I can jump in.

1443
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:52,380
I'm really excited about the beta test and I hope it's true that Ingress players are

1444
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:53,580
going to get the jump on that.

1445
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:54,580
I play Ingress.

1446
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:56,220
Can I have a beta test?

1447
01:02:56,220 --> 01:02:59,260
You actually, you might, you might have to be a certain level, but I don't know.

1448
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:01,740
That better not be the case.

1449
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:02,740
We'll see.

1450
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:06,980
Um, but, uh, yeah, I know a lot of Ingress players, there's even a lot of chat amongst

1451
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:07,980
that group.

1452
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:13,980
Like, so who's going to end up not playing anymore because of Pokemon and most people

1453
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:16,020
I talked to say they're going to play both.

1454
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:22,100
Probably most of the people that are on the blue side and hey, you guys even it out a

1455
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,100
little bit.

1456
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:24,100
Just even it out.

1457
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:25,100
Yeah.

1458
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:26,100
I think it's, I think it's a little bit, a little bit of both.

1459
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:27,100
Uh, let's see.

1460
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:31,940
Act Efton chat over at live.vognotework.com says, I know I'm excited for Pokemon Go despite

1461
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:32,980
I don't play Ingress.

1462
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,500
My brother though, he's Ingress junkie.

1463
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,500
Yeah.

1464
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:38,420
Funny how I forgot to mention that during my gaming week about how much Ingress I played

1465
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:39,420
this week.

1466
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:41,220
There's a reason why I stopped talking about it.

1467
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:42,220
Yeah.

1468
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:45,500
Uh, and Akuma JP in chat says, I've tried Ingress.

1469
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,300
I have no idea what to do.

1470
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:53,940
It isn't the easiest concept to pick up at first, but essentially you have resonators,

1471
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:58,060
you have bursters, resonators is how you capture things.

1472
01:03:58,060 --> 01:03:59,540
Bursters is how you blow up the other.

1473
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:03,420
Just watch like some, a couple of YouTube videos on like, uh, getting started with it.

1474
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:05,980
And actually if you play through the tutorial, it'll kind of walk you through it.

1475
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:08,780
Cause that when I first got into, I was like, eh, I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing,

1476
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:10,200
but I have a better idea now.

1477
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:15,060
It really helps to be at a park or a place where there's likely to be portals when you're

1478
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,060
learning the game.

1479
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,060
It'll help you a lot.

1480
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:18,060
I think.

1481
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:19,060
Or at work.

1482
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:20,060
Yeah.

1483
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:21,540
Or, or with coworkers who can explain it to you.

1484
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:22,540
Absolutely.

1485
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:23,540
All right.

1486
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:24,540
Uh, let's see.

1487
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:27,540
Bonds double six says, I was wondering if real world malls and cities would have some

1488
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:28,540
perks.

1489
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:31,980
Well, I mean the malls all here have several portals at them.

1490
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:36,060
So if Niantic is just going to use the same database for Ingress as they're going to use

1491
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:40,100
in Pokemon go, then I would think, yeah, a lot of malls and things are going to have

1492
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:41,300
tons of Pokemon.

1493
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:46,300
But this also means cemeteries are going to be the place to get, which is where I want

1494
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,300
to go.

1495
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:50,060
But I see where that starts to get a little weird.

1496
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:51,780
No, I don't.

1497
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:52,780
I want to go tonight.

1498
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:57,140
She wouldn't go play Ingress at the cemetery tonight.

1499
01:04:57,140 --> 01:05:00,060
I'm already planning on stopping a few places on the way home.

1500
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:01,540
I've got a fucking problem.

1501
01:05:01,540 --> 01:05:04,820
I seriously, why am I looking at a map?

1502
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:06,260
Why do I have it turned on my phone?

1503
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:07,260
I have a problem.

1504
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:10,220
I need serious help.

1505
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:12,180
I can relate.

1506
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:13,820
It's an addictive game.

1507
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:14,820
It really is.

1508
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:15,820
All right.

1509
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:17,740
I took work off Tuesday, by the way.

1510
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:18,740
Did you?

1511
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:20,500
Originally I wasn't playing Ingress, but I'm actually going to work on my costume.

1512
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:21,500
I still only play some Ingress.

1513
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,500
You're going to do both.

1514
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:23,500
You know you're going to do both.

1515
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:24,500
Eleven hours of Ingress.

1516
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:25,500
All right.

1517
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:30,940
Moving on, let's talk about something a lot more old school, but still very Nintendo.

1518
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:32,420
Donkey Kong Jr.

1519
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:34,100
Whatever happened to Donkey Kong Jr.?

1520
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:39,020
I mean, because Donkey Kong kind of split off into the whole Donkey Kong Country universe,

1521
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:43,260
and then there was Diddy Kong and Dixie Kong and all that, but whatever happened to Donkey

1522
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:44,420
Kong Jr.?

1523
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:49,820
Well, if you believe trademark-related things, a new trademark has been filed for Donkey

1524
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:51,260
Kong Jr.

1525
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:54,260
This was found, of course, on the United States trademark website, and that's how people snoop

1526
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:55,620
around and find all this stuff.

1527
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:57,480
It was filed just over a month ago.

1528
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:04,060
It was filed by Nintendo of America under, quote, downloadable electronic game programs,

1529
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:08,500
downloadable electronic video game software, electronic game programs, electronic game

1530
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:12,340
software, video game programs, and video game software.

1531
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:15,980
So could this mean that Donkey Kong Jr. is due for a revival?

1532
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:17,380
I would say no.

1533
01:06:17,380 --> 01:06:20,660
It's probably just that Donkey Kong Jr. is coming to Virtual Console, because I don't

1534
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:21,940
think it's on Virtual Console.

1535
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:23,060
I could be wrong.

1536
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:24,460
I don't think it is.

1537
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:28,980
So that seems like the easier answer is that they're just renewing it because Donkey Kong

1538
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:31,460
Jr. will be on Virtual Console.

1539
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:36,580
But it could also be, what if Donkey Kong Jr. is one of the new Smash Brothers characters?

1540
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:37,580
Could be.

1541
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:38,580
So you never know.

1542
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:41,740
They might, you know, the character might end up showing up somewhere else.

1543
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:44,820
Would you guys be interested in a revival of Donkey Kong Jr.?

1544
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:45,820
No.

1545
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:46,820
No?

1546
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:47,820
I like the arcade game, but...

1547
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:48,820
It was okay.

1548
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:49,820
I like the Coleco...

1549
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:52,260
I think I had it on Coleco.

1550
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:54,220
I liked that one.

1551
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:55,220
But I...

1552
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:56,220
No.

1553
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:57,220
Not really.

1554
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:58,220
Just...

1555
01:06:58,220 --> 01:06:59,420
What I would like to see them do is something new.

1556
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:00,420
Or...

1557
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:01,420
I don't know.

1558
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:02,420
A new Metroid or...

1559
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:03,420
I don't know.

1560
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:04,420
A new F-Zero would be nice.

1561
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:05,980
Do we need another fucking Donkey Kong game?

1562
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,540
I mean, seriously.

1563
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:10,420
They just put out one on the Wii U not too long ago.

1564
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:11,420
Cool.

1565
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:14,260
Let's go to another franchise you haven't touched for a while.

1566
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:20,100
Alan Alchemy in chat with a little FYI saying Diddy Kong was originally Jr., but Nintendo

1567
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:24,660
forced the name change because he didn't look anything like the overalls Jr. Nintendo already

1568
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:27,460
came up with, if I recall correctly.

1569
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:28,460
And if I...

1570
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:32,180
Rare had developed Donkey Kong Country, so maybe Nintendo is being very protective of

1571
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:37,240
the character saying, this looks nothing like Donkey Kong Jr., so you can't name him that.

1572
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:40,380
So maybe that's part of how things got split off.

1573
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:43,380
But it would be interesting if Nintendo revisited that world.

1574
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:49,060
You know, I could expect that Nintendo's gonna surprise us, you know, now that we've seen

1575
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:51,020
that original IPs work.

1576
01:07:51,020 --> 01:07:55,260
Not that necessarily Donkey Kong Jr.'s original, but, you know, if they're not gonna end up

1577
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:58,140
doing another Donkey Kong Country game, maybe they're gonna take a strong character and

1578
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:03,460
still come up with some type of new platforming type of thing, so that it's different than

1579
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:04,900
the country universe we're used to.

1580
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:05,900
I don't know.

1581
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:07,900
Any thoughts, Donkey Kong Jr.?

1582
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:10,620
I barely remembered it when I was talking about it earlier tonight.

1583
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:14,380
I think it would be interesting, though, if Mario is the villain again.

1584
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:18,380
That's the other thing that is it, you know, remember, Mario was the villain in those games.

1585
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:19,380
Would they do that?

1586
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:20,380
They would never do that now.

1587
01:08:20,380 --> 01:08:21,380
I don't know.

1588
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:23,380
They'd just make it Wario or something.

1589
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:24,380
Yeah, that's true.

1590
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,860
It'd probably end up being Wario.

1591
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:29,260
Or Mario is under influence.

1592
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:34,300
You find out that the whole time, Mario is under a spell of somebody else.

1593
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:36,220
That'll be how they work their way out of it.

1594
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:42,260
Why don't they have, like, a Wario Waluigi equivalent of Princess Peach?

1595
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:43,260
I thought they did.

1596
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:44,260
A bad girl?

1597
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:46,540
Yeah, like a bad female character.

1598
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:47,540
Wasn't there a bad Daisy?

1599
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:48,540
I thought there was.

1600
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:49,540
I don't remember.

1601
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:50,540
Maybe I'm crazy.

1602
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:51,540
I don't know.

1603
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:55,940
Daisy was in Mario Land, which Wario was the villain in, but...

1604
01:08:55,940 --> 01:09:03,220
I always liked Waluigi's name as a pun, because it always makes me think Wari isn't bad.

1605
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:04,220
Oh, okay.

1606
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:05,220
Yeah.

1607
01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:06,220
But...

1608
01:09:06,220 --> 01:09:10,220
Alan Alchemy says, that's who Petsch is, Princess Petsch.

1609
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:12,380
I thought I thought there was a bad princess.

1610
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:13,380
No.

1611
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:19,500
No, Petsch was a person's, uh, crap, me.

1612
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:20,500
Oh.

1613
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:21,500
Never mind.

1614
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:24,460
I posted that ages ago on my...

1615
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:25,460
Princess Petsch is a meme.

1616
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:26,460
Yeah, I was gonna say Princess Petsch.

1617
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:27,460
I'm gonna find it.

1618
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:28,460
It's on my Tumblr somewhere.

1619
01:09:28,460 --> 01:09:31,620
Princess Petsch sounds like, you know, Sanic or, you know, Danky Kang.

1620
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:33,260
Danky Kang.

1621
01:09:33,260 --> 01:09:36,060
I don't remember seeing Princess Petsch as a Jeopardy answer.

1622
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:38,860
We could make a cool bad girl princess in the Mario universe.

1623
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:39,860
That would be awesome.

1624
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:43,540
Excuse me if I can't keep up with the 5,000 memes that are out there on the internet.

1625
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:44,540
Alright.

1626
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:45,540
Anyhow.

1627
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:48,020
Oh, Alan Alchemy is giving me a link here.

1628
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:49,300
Hold on.

1629
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:50,300
So let me see.

1630
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:54,820
Apparently I'm being exposed to a meme for the first time, or I'm gonna go, oh, that.

1631
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:57,140
Oh, yeah, I've seen that.

1632
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:58,140
Okay.

1633
01:09:58,140 --> 01:09:59,140
That's a meme?

1634
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:00,140
Really?

1635
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:01,140
Yeah.

1636
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:02,140
Yeah, okay.

1637
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:03,140
It's just somebody's me character.

1638
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:05,420
It's, and their face is just smushed together.

1639
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:06,420
Whatever.

1640
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:08,780
That's not even funny.

1641
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:12,740
He had just posted it the same time I found my, uh, thing on Facebook.

1642
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:15,640
That's not nearly as funny as the Wat Lady.

1643
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:17,940
And Lonk.

1644
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:19,220
Or Danky Kang.

1645
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:23,900
Yeah, my, um, my, uh, Tumblr link in there has Lonk.

1646
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:26,020
And someone's fanart of the two of them.

1647
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:30,340
Alright, moving on, DarkSakura, please take us out of meme territory.

1648
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:31,340
No.

1649
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:33,540
I'm trying to get us deeper into it.

1650
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:40,980
So, um, there is a little bit of flak 2K, uh, Games is Taking.

1651
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:48,300
Uh, they tried to bring in, uh, one of the journalists from, uh, Giant Bomb, Jeff Girtzman,

1652
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:54,420
who has a role called Dr. Tracksuit, that he uses to promote PAX Wrestling events.

1653
01:10:54,420 --> 01:11:04,300
Um, well, they made a likeness of him in WWE 2K6, and it was in their trailer, and so he

1654
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:09,420
caught a view of it, and was like, hey, that's not cool, I didn't give anyone permission

1655
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:10,420
for this.

1656
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:15,220
In fact, the actual tweet says, kind of not okay with someone, uh, using something similar

1657
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:21,340
to my likeness to promote a franchise that has been so terrible for so long.

1658
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:29,100
Well, they changed the, uh, the, uh, preview and removed the portion out of it.

1659
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:30,100
Mmm.

1660
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:31,660
That's almost an admission of guilt.

1661
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:37,540
Yeah, I hope that they've learned their lesson, but I'm sure there's gonna be a way to recreate

1662
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:39,740
them in the actual game.

1663
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:40,740
So.

1664
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:44,540
Um, was, did they punch him in the face in the trailer?

1665
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:46,380
Like did this guy give him a bad review?

1666
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:47,860
It's insane, I didn't watch it.

1667
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:50,820
They wanted to suplex him in the video like he was a train?

1668
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:56,320
See I rather, uh, agree with his opinion of the franchise.

1669
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,020
So I won't play it.

1670
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:01,420
I will not, I will not play that Sam I am.

1671
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:03,940
Even with Green Eggs and Ham.

1672
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:05,500
Fair enough.

1673
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:10,500
Uh, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says he's only showed up coming down the entrance ramp.

1674
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:14,420
Okay, so, cause I thought maybe like he'd given the game a bad review, so they punched

1675
01:12:14,420 --> 01:12:17,900
him in the face in the trailer and I would have thought like, well that's pretty clever

1676
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:20,500
but that's also really, really wrong.

1677
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:24,460
So I guess it's for the best it ended up being, um, changed.

1678
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:27,780
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of games that

1679
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:30,700
are coming out, uh, this next week.

1680
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:33,300
Starting with the US, Loki.

1681
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:37,140
So there's, we're in the thick of it, so there's a lot of games coming out this week.

1682
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:42,380
Um, starting off with Guitar Hero Live will be making its way up finally.

1683
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:45,420
I played a demo of that at a Target.

1684
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:47,940
I do not like what they did with the controller.

1685
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:51,140
I guess it's innovative but it's not fun.

1686
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:52,420
Have you seen the controller?

1687
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:53,820
I haven't.

1688
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:55,900
They have the frets, there's six of them.

1689
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:56,900
There's three.

1690
01:12:56,900 --> 01:12:57,900
Three and two rows.

1691
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:02,940
Yeah, and it's so weird to try to move your fingers back and forth because, you know,

1692
01:13:02,940 --> 01:13:07,060
you either have to hit one row or the other row and it's just, it doesn't feel good but

1693
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:08,260
maybe that's how real guitar is.

1694
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:09,420
I don't really know.

1695
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:13,660
Um, yeah, I don't know, I don't play guitar so I can't really say.

1696
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:22,060
But yeah, Guitar Hero Live coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and

1697
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:23,060
Wii U.

1698
01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:30,620
Also, coming out this week, Just Dance 2016 on pretty much all platforms.

1699
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:34,540
Gravity Falls, they're having a game come out on 3DS.

1700
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:37,140
Let's see.

1701
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:42,580
And then, I'm not sure if this is accurate or not, but they have a Halo 5 Guardians limited

1702
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:45,860
collector's edition on Xbox One that's coming out this week.

1703
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:49,780
Although I know Halo 5 actually comes out next week, so I'm not positive if this is

1704
01:13:49,780 --> 01:13:55,120
something, if you spend $250 you get it a week early or if it's just an incorrect date.

1705
01:13:55,120 --> 01:14:00,260
I'm willing to bet it's an incorrect date but, you know, just thought I'd mention it.

1706
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:05,380
Tales of Zestiria is coming out on PlayStation 3 and also collector's edition on PlayStation

1707
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:10,060
4 and I believe a regular edition on PlayStation 4 as well.

1708
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:18,980
Just Dance Disney Party 2 coming out on Xbox 360 and Wii U and Wii and I believe PlayStation

1709
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:19,980
3.

1710
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:32,180
Also, Adventure Time Finn and Jake Investigations on PlayStation 4, 3DS, Wii U and Xbox 360.

1711
01:14:32,180 --> 01:14:36,740
Let's see, there's a lot of games coming out.

1712
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:42,060
Dragon Ball Z Extreme Butoden coming out on 3DS.

1713
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:47,740
Hasbro Family Fun Pack on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1714
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:53,900
They're doing like a combo pack for Disney games, Frozen and Big Hero 6, kind of a re-release

1715
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:55,900
there.

1716
01:14:55,900 --> 01:15:02,780
Let's see what else we have coming out.

1717
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:05,740
Guitar Hero once again, with that, Guitar Hero Live they're also doing like a bundle

1718
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:10,220
pack with two guitars as well in case you want an additional guitar on top of the one

1719
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:11,660
that it comes with.

1720
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:16,620
And Just Dance 2016 Gold Edition, they're putting out a special edition for that as

1721
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:17,620
well.

1722
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:21,620
I believe that's, oh wait, nope, nope.

1723
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:23,540
Doing these crappy Sunday releases.

1724
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:27,180
So thank you Ubisoft.

1725
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:32,420
Assassin's Creed Syndicate, they have a version of that that's going to be coming out on Friday,

1726
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:36,740
so that's on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1727
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:38,380
And then that would be it for the week.

1728
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:41,260
Alright, wow, busy week in the US.

1729
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:43,940
Japan traveling over there, it's a lot lighter.

1730
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:47,760
There's not really the same level of releases over there that we have here, but we do have

1731
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:49,540
just a few things coming out.

1732
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:55,820
Sengoku Musou 4 gets a price reduction as it moves into the Koei Tecmo The Best collection

1733
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:57,580
over on the PlayStation 4.

1734
01:15:57,580 --> 01:16:03,500
I do not believe anything is out on the Wii U this week in Japan, nope, in fact I think

1735
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:06,900
now that Woolly World's come out, I don't think there's anything for quite a while until

1736
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:07,900
we get into November.

1737
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:12,100
However, if you go to the handhelds, the story's a little different because on the 3DS this

1738
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:15,860
week, and I think this is the big tent pole for the week, The Legend of Zelda Triforce

1739
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:18,420
Heroes is out in Japan on the 22nd.

1740
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:20,340
So obviously that's a big title.

1741
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:21,980
That's a really good game I didn't talk about.

1742
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:22,980
Oh, did you play the demo?

1743
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:24,340
I played the demo.

1744
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:25,700
It was really fun.

1745
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:30,020
I did not have any expectations going into it.

1746
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:31,020
Is it a lot like Four Swords?

1747
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:34,660
Yes, but with one less person and costumes.

1748
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:39,500
And it's just neat, like the costumes, the ones we had in the demo were kind of stupid.

1749
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:44,540
Does it work with all the Amiibo on the 3DS too for costumes like Yoshi does?

1750
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:47,740
I don't think it does anything with Amiibo, it may do something with Toon Link, I don't

1751
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:48,740
know.

1752
01:16:48,740 --> 01:16:53,860
But we got to pick from a Tingle costume or a Zelda costume, and they all had their own

1753
01:16:53,860 --> 01:16:55,340
power-ups.

1754
01:16:55,340 --> 01:16:59,140
Like the little emotes, because you can't voice chat, the emotes are so much fun and

1755
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:03,100
you can keep tapping them over and over to make them bigger and louder, to get people's

1756
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:04,100
attention.

1757
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:05,100
It's cool.

1758
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:06,100
Alright.

1759
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:09,700
Well, also on the 3DS, if for whatever reason Triforce Heroes isn't your thing, Pri Para

1760
01:17:09,700 --> 01:17:13,740
Mezase Idol Grand Prix No. 1 is also out this week.

1761
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:15,100
I'm sure that is a winner.

1762
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:16,100
I don't know though.

1763
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:17,980
I don't know anything about that game.

1764
01:17:17,980 --> 01:17:25,380
Lastly, over on the PlayStation Vita, I actually don't think, oh, some price reductions this

1765
01:17:25,380 --> 01:17:26,380
week.

1766
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:32,820
Senkoku Musou 4, Maju, and then one new game from Prototype called Flowers Natsu Hen comes

1767
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:35,380
out this week on the PlayStation Vita.

1768
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:36,380
That's it for Japan.

1769
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:37,380
How about Europe?

1770
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:40,540
Oh, a few things, just a few.

1771
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:48,820
We have on the 20th, Deathwatch Enhanced Edition, Rebel Galaxy, and Tales of Zestiria.

1772
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:52,380
On the 21st, Kingdom for Mac and PC.

1773
01:17:52,380 --> 01:18:00,060
On the 22nd, Dovetail Games Euro Fishing, and Noct for PC and for Mac.

1774
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:08,740
And on the 23rd, I think the 23rd is this week, I can't even remember what day it is,

1775
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:14,100
Assassin's Creed Syndicate for a bunch of stuff, Guitar Hero Live for a bunch of stuff,

1776
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:27,020
including iOS, Just Dance 2016, Let's Sing 2016, and Warhammer End Times Verminetide

1777
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:28,420
on PC.

1778
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:30,380
I think that's it.

1779
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:31,380
That is it.

1780
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:34,800
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week,

1781
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,300
but first, Loki.

1782
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:41,620
Alright, so this kind of sucks, but apparently more accounts have been hacked.

1783
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:48,940
There was a data dump that they did on PaySpin that included about 600 origin accounts, including

1784
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:59,340
Gmail addresses, passwords, and games tied to accounts.

1785
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:04,540
They're saying that, and basically these were kind of like the first part of a dump, maybe.

1786
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:09,780
They're saying they're letters A through F as far as the names.

1787
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:13,820
Right now, they're saying at this point, there's no indication that the list was obtained through

1788
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:19,940
an intrusion of our account databases, but because of that, you still might want to take

1789
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:26,380
caution to make sure that you're changing your passwords and that type of stuff.

1790
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:27,820
I don't know.

1791
01:19:27,820 --> 01:19:30,820
That's not too reassuring, though.

1792
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:31,820
No it is not.

1793
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:36,380
Email addresses and passwords and stuff.

1794
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:39,260
Just make sure you're not reusing your passwords.

1795
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:41,820
You know, a game I didn't talk about during my gaming week, probably because I didn't

1796
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:45,060
play an awful lot of it, but it's something I played through Origin, and again, this is

1797
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:46,940
kind of Shane's fault, but not really.

1798
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:47,940
He didn't really pressure me to play this.

1799
01:19:47,940 --> 01:19:49,340
I was just like, oh, I'll try it again.

1800
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:54,020
I played Star Wars The Old Republic, which is an EA, it's an online MMO, and I haven't

1801
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:57,540
played it since it first came out, and when it went free to play, and I was like, oh,

1802
01:19:57,540 --> 01:19:59,860
let me see how the graphics are.

1803
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:02,420
There's Star Wars hysteria in the world right now.

1804
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:04,020
They've got an expansion coming out.

1805
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:07,620
What the poster for the new movie came out today, and everybody's going, oh my God, you

1806
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:10,060
know, right, over that, so I was like, oh, I'll check out The Old Republic.

1807
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:11,980
I didn't play a lot of it, though.

1808
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:16,220
I actually probably played more Final Fantasy XIV than I did Star Wars The Old Republic,

1809
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:17,260
which is a bit of a change.

1810
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:21,700
I've been kind of taking a break from XIV lately because I really need a content patch,

1811
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:25,620
but I'm very excited about the pet battles in the new patch, but anyway, just kind of

1812
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:28,700
made me think of that as a, I haven't really been playing a lot through Origin lately,

1813
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:30,140
but I did play that.

1814
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:33,100
But Shane, you didn't talk really about this during your gaming week, Star Wars The Old

1815
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:34,100
Republic.

1816
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:35,100
Are you having a good time with it?

1817
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:38,260
Because I couldn't play it because my computer's graphics card was too good, remember?

1818
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:40,260
Yeah, but you're further along than I am, so you may be playing that.

1819
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:42,300
Yeah, because I just did a little bit here and there.

1820
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:43,300
It's fun.

1821
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:46,460
I don't want to get back into an MMO, really, so.

1822
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:47,460
Yeah, I hear you.

1823
01:20:47,460 --> 01:20:53,820
It's just a neat little diversion while my Hunt for Power Ranger toys is kind of cooled.

1824
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:54,820
That's how I feel.

1825
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:57,340
It's like an, oh, neat kind of thing, but I don't think I'm going to get sucked back

1826
01:20:57,380 --> 01:20:58,380
into it at all.

1827
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:00,900
It's kind of like when I played Neverwinter for like a week.

1828
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:02,860
I was like, oh, okay, it's kind of neat.

1829
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:07,060
Now I feel a little more like I know a little more about this MMO, but that's it.

1830
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:13,700
Anyhow, you know, we are now living in a world where there is not just one video game streaming

1831
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:17,820
service, but there's two between Twitch TV and YouTube gaming, and of course, you know,

1832
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:22,580
the other, you know, kind of under the bubble streaming services as well.

1833
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:26,420
But I think a lot of us have been trying to see, oh, what's going to happen in this competition

1834
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:27,940
versus Twitch and YouTube?

1835
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:30,820
Well, YouTube did a very interesting move this week.

1836
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:38,220
YouTube gaming updated their app, and now you can actually stream from a mobile phone

1837
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:39,220
if it's Android.

1838
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:43,460
It actually will not work on the iPhones, and I'm assuming that's because the iPhones

1839
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:47,140
are a little more locked down in the OS, so I don't think one app can kind of bleed into

1840
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:48,500
another.

1841
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:51,540
But if you have Android, you can actually do streaming from mobile.

1842
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:53,060
That's kind of exciting, actually.

1843
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:56,740
You can use the front cam to actually do commentary as you play along with the mobile

1844
01:21:56,740 --> 01:21:57,740
game.

1845
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:02,380
I did not realize this, but I guess stuff like Clash of Clans is, like, huge on YouTube,

1846
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:06,140
and I, you know, I gotta be honest, that's not, is that the one Mariah Carey does the

1847
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:07,140
ads for now?

1848
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:08,140
I have no idea.

1849
01:22:08,140 --> 01:22:09,820
It's like, dang, what happened to you, girl?

1850
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:12,100
She is, is that, or is that Game of War?

1851
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:14,700
I thought that was Liam Neeson did Clash of Clans.

1852
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:15,900
Is it?

1853
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:16,900
I don't know.

1854
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:17,900
What's the other one?

1855
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:22,800
It's always that fucking ad on YouTube where Mariah Carey is like, and it was somebody

1856
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,400
else before her, some supermodel pretty girl.

1857
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,400
Kate Upton?

1858
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:27,400
Yeah.

1859
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:28,400
The Kate Upton game?

1860
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:29,400
Yeah.

1861
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,400
Which one's that?

1862
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:31,400
Oh, I don't remember.

1863
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:32,400
Alan will shout it out in chat as soon as, okay.

1864
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,400
They're all, they all blend together.

1865
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:34,400
Oh, they're all yelling, it's Game of War.

1866
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,720
Thank you.

1867
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:36,720
That's different.

1868
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:37,720
Um.

1869
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:44,080
SSJ100 Matt in chat says, ugh, I'm envisioning people streaming themselves going through

1870
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:45,080
Tinder.

1871
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:50,400
That's kind of fucked up, though, like, don't broadcast people who don't, you know, who

1872
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,640
didn't give you permission to do that, you know what I mean?

1873
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:54,280
Don't broadcast things like Tinder.

1874
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:55,280
All right.

1875
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,720
And Act F says Clash of Clans is the one with the cartoony looks.

1876
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:58,720
All right.

1877
01:22:58,720 --> 01:22:59,720
Well, now I understand.

1878
01:22:59,720 --> 01:23:00,720
Thank you.

1879
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:05,080
I would stream myself playing Flappy Bird because that game was really infuriating sometimes,

1880
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,080
remember?

1881
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:08,040
You guys remember when Flappy Bird was cool?

1882
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:10,080
I never played it.

1883
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:11,080
Yeah.

1884
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,840
I think Hearthstone would be fun to stream on my phone.

1885
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:14,840
Oh, yeah.

1886
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:15,840
Yeah.

1887
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,840
Hearthstone's a fun game.

1888
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:17,840
Well, that's a good one.

1889
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:21,200
You get so frustrated because you get, you play really well, then this insane card comes

1890
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:22,200
out.

1891
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,200
You're like, no!

1892
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:24,640
I can see the rage.

1893
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:28,480
That's when, um, uh, the Hearthstone's a huge one on PC.

1894
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:29,480
Anyway.

1895
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:30,480
Yeah, I know.

1896
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:31,480
It's one of the biggest streamers on Twitch.

1897
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:35,080
And so, but, but I think having the mobile phone, if it uses the camera and it's pointing

1898
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:37,480
like right up at your face, I think it's just hilarious.

1899
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:38,480
All right.

1900
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:43,200
Well, also, uh, rolling out on YouTube fan funding and sponsorships, and I guess this

1901
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:45,600
is being tested with some streamers right now.

1902
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:51,880
Uh, there's live chat stuff, uh, extra there, exclusive chat sessions, and more apparently

1903
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:53,240
being planned with that.

1904
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:56,640
So, um, interesting to see what's developing on that front.

1905
01:23:56,640 --> 01:24:00,040
And I got to admit, as somebody who's trying to get into streaming more and more, like

1906
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:03,800
I kind of can't decide, do I want to do Twitch or do I want to do YouTube?

1907
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:07,880
Like, I feel like the discoverability is a little better on Twitch right now.

1908
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:11,800
And you know, they've got a pretty solid community over there, but then it's like, oh, but YouTube,

1909
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:16,200
you know, probably opens up monetization to everybody, but let's be real.

1910
01:24:16,200 --> 01:24:18,120
I'm not going to make any money off of it.

1911
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:21,160
And I kind of, I kind of think the stream is better quality on YouTube because you can

1912
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:23,400
do the 1080p at 60 frames a second.

1913
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:24,400
So I don't know.

1914
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:25,400
I don't know.

1915
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:28,040
I'm, I'm trying to decide and it can't, it's just, there's perks to, I think inevitably

1916
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:31,920
I'll have to juggle both, but then do I want to spread myself thin like that?

1917
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:32,920
I don't know.

1918
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:33,920
All right.

1919
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:37,940
Well, remember, we're going to take a trip back and remember the days when you couldn't

1920
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:40,460
like stream these games.

1921
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:43,740
You could take like a Polaroid picture and that was it.

1922
01:24:43,740 --> 01:24:47,580
It's a classic game of the week.

1923
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:52,380
Dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, Hey,

1924
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:59,700
enough with your clash of clans, game of war, mobile phone streaming stuff.

1925
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:02,500
This is back when Mariah Carey had number one hits.

1926
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:06,900
This is before Mariah Carey had number one hits.

1927
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:11,460
This is when you can't do that on television was actually still on TV.

1928
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:12,460
This is before.

1929
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:14,660
This was when Mariah Carey gets back on.

1930
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:16,180
It was back on for a minute.

1931
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:17,180
What?

1932
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:18,180
Yeah.

1933
01:25:18,180 --> 01:25:23,380
Nickelodeon had that splat channel or something like that.

1934
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:24,380
And it was gas.

1935
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:25,380
Right?

1936
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:26,380
No, no, no.

1937
01:25:26,380 --> 01:25:27,380
I don't think that existed anymore.

1938
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:29,220
That was a new channel splatter thing.

1939
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:30,220
It's coming on.

1940
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:31,220
It's all the nineties.

1941
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:32,220
Yeah.

1942
01:25:32,220 --> 01:25:33,460
And then at night, I'm sorry.

1943
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:34,460
I'm very sorry.

1944
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:36,580
But nineties Nickelodeon is very important.

1945
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:37,860
Did gas turn into splat?

1946
01:25:37,860 --> 01:25:39,340
No gas was just went away a long time ago.

1947
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:40,980
That was a really good channel though.

1948
01:25:40,980 --> 01:25:45,140
Um, no, it had stuff like you can't do that on television.

1949
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,140
Are you afraid of the dark?

1950
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:47,140
Oh my God.

1951
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:48,140
This is amazing.

1952
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:49,140
Clarissa explains it all.

1953
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:50,140
Yeah.

1954
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:51,140
It was really cool looking.

1955
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:54,700
And of course I don't have cable so I can watch it, but I apologize to dark soccer,

1956
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:56,700
but you did say you can't do that on television.

1957
01:25:56,700 --> 01:26:01,500
So, all right, anyhow, she just rolled her eyes so hard.

1958
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:03,300
It's the introduction to the opposite.

1959
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:04,300
All right.

1960
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:05,300
Dark soccer.

1961
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:11,860
Classic game of the week, punch out, which, which she's about to do to one of the hosts.

1962
01:26:11,860 --> 01:26:15,740
I'm about to do something anyway.

1963
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:19,540
Punch out was a actually a whole series of boxing games.

1964
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:27,140
It was created by a Nintendo general manager, uh, Daniel Takeda and uh, done also by a Makato

1965
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:28,140
Wada.

1966
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:33,500
The, uh, we had the arcade version, which was punch out with exclamation points.

1967
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:38,300
And then there was a sequel, which was super punch out exclamation points.

1968
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:43,580
So there were all kinds of different versions that came out later for the home market and

1969
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:52,140
even fairly recently for the home market again, and even had a spinoff called arm wrestling,

1970
01:26:52,140 --> 01:26:55,820
which only came out in North American arcades.

1971
01:26:55,820 --> 01:27:02,260
And it was also Nintendo's last arcade game that they independently developed and released.

1972
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:09,980
So, um, it really is just, you're going through a character by character, trying to punch

1973
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:10,980
them.

1974
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:16,020
You play as little Mac and you're trying to win the world video boxing association championship

1975
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:24,100
and you fight different, a very stereotypical characters to say the least.

1976
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:29,260
And um, basically you just have to knock them out, but everyone's going to have their own

1977
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:31,420
different super attack and their own patterns.

1978
01:27:31,420 --> 01:27:36,580
So you really have to just learn how to beat them properly.

1979
01:27:36,580 --> 01:27:43,100
You will also get a visual cue that lets you know when they're about to do their big, uh,

1980
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:44,980
super powered attack.

1981
01:27:44,980 --> 01:27:51,180
So, um, as far as different versions that have been out, cause I mean, there's really

1982
01:27:51,180 --> 01:27:55,340
not too much else to say about fucking punch out cause it's, you know, punch out, um, there

1983
01:27:55,340 --> 01:27:59,820
was punch out arcade, which was the first one punch out boxing for game and watch super

1984
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:06,900
punch out that came out arcade, uh, CPC, Commodore 16, Commodore 64, Commodore plus,

1985
01:28:06,900 --> 01:28:10,060
uh, MS-DOS and ZX spectrum.

1986
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:16,420
Then there was arm wrestling in 1985, uh, punch out slash Mike Tyson's punch out that

1987
01:28:16,420 --> 01:28:22,700
came out on the NES, um, Wii, uh, virtual console, Nintendo 3DS virtual console and

1988
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:24,380
Wii U virtual console.

1989
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:30,940
Now something to say about this is that Mike Tyson's punch out was under a special license

1990
01:28:30,940 --> 01:28:36,060
after, um, they, uh, lost the licensing rights.

1991
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:42,060
It then became just punch out again with, I think it was Mr. Dream as the final, the

1992
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:43,060
final boss.

1993
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:44,060
But interesting.

1994
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:47,900
You know, you hear, you can hear in the video left, right, left cause we're looking at the

1995
01:28:47,900 --> 01:28:53,340
arcade version here, which, you know, I, I remember playing as a kid and I'm kind of

1996
01:28:53,340 --> 01:28:56,700
looking at this going, wow, I didn't realize how much of Mike Tyson's punch out, which

1997
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:59,340
I'm more familiar with, had like a lot of this stuff.

1998
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:00,340
Like kid quick.

1999
01:29:00,340 --> 01:29:01,340
This guy was not in.

2000
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:02,340
Yeah.

2001
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:03,340
Tyson's at all.

2002
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:04,340
The ball bold.

2003
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:08,980
The last guy was, but the last Joe, the last guy in this was a super macho man, right?

2004
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:09,980
I think so.

2005
01:29:09,980 --> 01:29:10,980
Yeah.

2006
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:11,980
I'm pretty sure it was like the end boss.

2007
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:15,940
And the other thing too, is that graphically, the reason why we had teensy tiny little Mac

2008
01:29:15,940 --> 01:29:19,420
is because, um, they wouldn't have been able, I think part of it was that they couldn't

2009
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:20,700
have the size of the character.

2010
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:24,700
They would have also been able to do the transparencies for the green grid.

2011
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:27,700
They just didn't have the memory for it.

2012
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:32,260
Um, so little Mac was teeny Mac as I would call him.

2013
01:29:32,260 --> 01:29:34,340
I didn't know it was the licensing issue though.

2014
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:36,980
I thought it was all because of Mike Tyson's legal troubles or something.

2015
01:29:36,980 --> 01:29:37,980
No, it was licensing.

2016
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:38,980
So was that before that?

2017
01:29:38,980 --> 01:29:39,980
Yeah.

2018
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:40,980
Oh, I didn't know that.

2019
01:29:40,980 --> 01:29:41,980
Yeah.

2020
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:42,980
I think the legal troubles came soon after.

2021
01:29:42,980 --> 01:29:47,780
So in my mind, like growing up, I always like related to like, Oh, they can't have that

2022
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:48,780
anymore after, you know.

2023
01:29:48,780 --> 01:29:49,780
You went to jail for rape.

2024
01:29:49,780 --> 01:29:51,780
For beating up and cheating on your wife.

2025
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:52,780
Asshole.

2026
01:29:52,780 --> 01:29:53,780
Yeah.

2027
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:54,780
Anyway.

2028
01:29:54,780 --> 01:29:57,780
Um, after that we had Punch Out for Wii and Wii U.

2029
01:29:57,780 --> 01:30:04,220
Then we had Doc Lewis's Punch Out, which was a WiiWare standalone.

2030
01:30:04,220 --> 01:30:09,540
So it was only a download exclusive to the 2009 Club Nintendo Platinum members.

2031
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:15,380
And then it was re-released with a hundred other titles that were claimed by a general

2032
01:30:15,380 --> 01:30:16,840
Club Nintendo members.

2033
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:20,040
So it was only Club Nintendo.

2034
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:25,320
And so, uh, there were all kinds of fun characters in this series.

2035
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:29,200
Um, just to go through the list, cause there's a lot of them.

2036
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:34,120
There was Aaron Ryan, Bald Bull, I'm going in order, Bear Hugger, Bob Charlie, Disco

2037
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:37,880
Kid, Doc Lewis, Don Flamenco, Donkey Kong.

2038
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:40,560
God, there's actually just a bunch more.

2039
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:41,560
Yeah.

2040
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:44,760
Um, my favorite, always King Hippo, just because he was hilarious.

2041
01:30:44,760 --> 01:30:53,280
Um, we had Gabby J, Glass Joe, Great Tiger, Heike Kagero, um, Hoi Karlo, uh, Kid Quick,

2042
01:30:53,280 --> 01:31:01,600
King Hippo, uh, Lil Mac as an opponent, uh, Mad Clown, Mast Muscle, Mike Tyson, Mr. Dream,

2043
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:10,680
Mr. Sandman, Narciss Prince, uh, Nick Bruiser, Piston Honda, Piston Hurricane, Pizza Pasta,

2044
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:18,440
Rick Bruiser, Soda Popinski, which who originally was supposed to be, uh, um, uh, Vodka something.

2045
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:19,800
I'm gonna have to look him up again.

2046
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:22,600
We had Super Macho Man and Von Kaiser.

2047
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:26,720
Let me see if I can find Soda Popinski, cause he's actually got his little article on it.

2048
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:30,600
Okay, he was supposed to be Vodka Drunkinski.

2049
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:35,960
He first appeared in Super Punch Out and was called Vodka Drunkinski.

2050
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:38,920
And then he changed it from Mike Tyson's Punch Out.

2051
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:39,920
Huh.

2052
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:45,000
Yeah, I can't imagine that Nintendo of the 1980s made that change.

2053
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Who knew?

2054
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Eh.

2055
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,000
You think they're bad with the family stuff now.

2056
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,160
Good lord, you should have seen them back then.

2057
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:57,160
Well, um, the characters of course made plenty of other, um, you know, appearances.

2058
01:31:57,160 --> 01:32:00,760
We've, uh, had like trophies in Super Smash Brothers.

2059
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:06,720
We've had, uh, I believe, were there a couple of Howard and Nestor?

2060
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:12,720
And then, um, the SNES version of Super Punch Out was in the GameCube version of EA's Fight

2061
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:14,600
Night Round 2.

2062
01:32:14,600 --> 01:32:24,640
Um, and then you could also play Lil Mac, um, in, uh, uh, in the same game.

2063
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,120
He was an unlockable.

2064
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:30,840
Um, so it was, it was, you know, there were a lot of crossovers in there, but yeah, this

2065
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:33,480
game was pretty cool.

2066
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:35,200
Alright.

2067
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:41,760
There it is, your classic game of the week, Punch Out, which you can play in the arcade

2068
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:44,280
or you can play one of the, uh, many other home versions.

2069
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:49,000
Found what it was I was thinking of, there was a, a Punch Out title that was in the Nintendo

2070
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
comic system.

2071
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Oh.

2072
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:52,000
That was it.

2073
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:57,560
I have a little Punch Out like kind of memory real quick is, uh, it's a recent memory, but

2074
01:32:57,560 --> 01:33:03,000
it's, you know, I, I love Games Done Quick, but the way I found out about Games Done Quick

2075
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,720
was people on Twitter were talking about that guy, Sinister One, was playing Punch

2076
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:10,220
Out blindfolded on a stream.

2077
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:11,720
And Tyre Claude just brought that up in chat.

2078
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:12,720
Oh, that's funny.

2079
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:13,720
Oh yeah.

2080
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:16,040
I haven't been looking at the chat tonight, but yeah, it was actually the creator of Adventure

2081
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:20,360
Time tweeted it out and I was following him and uh, yeah, he said like, there's someone

2082
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:24,720
playing Mike Tyson's Punch Out blindfolded right now, everybody should go check it out.

2083
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:27,280
And I checked it out and I've been watching the streams ever since.

2084
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:30,080
That's what got me into Games Done Quick.

2085
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:31,080
I love Games Done Quick.

2086
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:32,920
Yeah, no, it's a good, good marathon.

2087
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:33,920
For the record.

2088
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:37,480
We were having a conversation last night about other games done blindfolded, all of which

2089
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:44,080
I have two, which is the Dragon Stage in Mega Man 2, I used to be able to do that blindfolded

2090
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,360
and then 8-1 in Super Mario Brothers.

2091
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:47,360
Dang.

2092
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:50,880
I did blindfolded, uh, Pagle on a stream once and that was funny.

2093
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:51,880
Yeah.

2094
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:55,560
I think Shane watched that one and then, uh, you were there for that one?

2095
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:56,560
I don't remember.

2096
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:57,560
I see.

2097
01:33:57,560 --> 01:33:58,560
I didn't know that.

2098
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:03,560
But, uh, there's a, there's an achievement on Unfinished Swan to, I didn't really do

2099
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:07,080
a blindfolded, but you have to get through the first level, which is all white, pretty

2100
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:08,080
much.

2101
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:09,080
And you spray paint everywhere.

2102
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:10,080
We're using only like three paint balls.

2103
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:13,720
And I was like, this is like a blindfold challenge because you have to be so quiet and listen

2104
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:15,700
to your steps and where you're going is pretty cool.

2105
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:16,700
That's a more recent game.

2106
01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:20,320
But yeah, there's a, there's a trophy and you get the trophy by not using too much paint.

2107
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:21,320
So yeah.

2108
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:22,320
Excellent.

2109
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:23,320
Blindfold games.

2110
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:24,320
Fun.

2111
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:25,320
Fun.

2112
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:26,320
All right.

2113
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:30,320
Thanks for participation for this week's episode of Orange Laundry Radio at vognetwork.com.

2114
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:31,320
Use the passphrase, Neil.

2115
01:34:31,320 --> 01:34:35,760
Uh, that's going to do it for this first half of Orange Laundry Radio, but don't go anywhere.

2116
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:40,640
We got more, including rapid fire news, the Fugu question of the week, your emails and

2117
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:42,700
listless when we come back.

2118
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:44,920
And tonight we actually have something very special.

2119
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:49,360
Usually we do a music break, uh, in between part A and part B, but tonight we actually

2120
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:54,480
have, thanks to DJ Rama S from Anime Jam Session, bringing us a very special exclusive interview

2121
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,160
with Kyle Hebert.

2122
01:34:56,160 --> 01:35:01,080
And if you don't know that name, uh, he is actually a very prolific anime voice actor

2123
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:02,720
as well as video games.

2124
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:07,520
He is the voice of Ryu in Street Fighter IV and like Smash Brothers with the DLC and all

2125
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:08,520
that.

2126
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:09,520
So, uh, we're going to get right to it.

2127
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:11,520
We're going to get over to Rama with this interview.

2128
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:14,920
It is about 15 minutes and I do want to say the audio quality is a little different than

2129
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:19,360
us here in studio because I think, uh, uh, Rama had his little audio recorder and it

2130
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:22,200
sounds like they're in a back room at this anime convention somewhere.

2131
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:27,560
Uh, so please excuse, uh, what might be perceived as, uh, uh, some rough audio, but, uh, good

2132
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:28,560
content.

2133
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:33,020
So, uh, we'll be back and a big thanks to Rama S for this interview and, uh, we'll be

2134
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:35,160
back in about 15 minutes on the other end of this interview.

2135
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:36,160
Take it away, Rama.

2136
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:44,520
Hey everyone, DJ Rama S here from Anime Jam Session.

2137
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:51,520
We're at AAC, another anime convention, 2015, Sunday, we're up, we're running about and

2138
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:53,600
they decided to give us some awesome interviews today.

2139
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,300
So we're going to take advantage of that.

2140
01:35:55,300 --> 01:36:02,560
And today on my right, we're here with prolific voice actor, Kyle, a bear, Hey Kyle, how's

2141
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,560
it going?

2142
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:04,560
I'm an excellent man.

2143
01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:08,480
I'm just trying to wake up and another fantastic weekend under our belt pretty much.

2144
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:09,920
That is awesome.

2145
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:12,840
First thing first, I want to say is congratulations on your upcoming Nopos.

2146
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:13,840
Oh yeah.

2147
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:14,840
Yeah.

2148
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:15,840
Thank you.

2149
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:16,840
Thank you.

2150
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:17,840
Thank you very much.

2151
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:21,160
So is it true to theme is going to be Gohan and Videl?

2152
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:24,720
Oh, I don't know about that.

2153
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:25,720
Don't know about that.

2154
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:30,120
She's thinking like, okay, long engagement and something private.

2155
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:31,120
Let's elope.

2156
01:36:31,120 --> 01:36:32,120
Let's save money.

2157
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:37,360
If you're going to blow money on anything wedding related, save it for the honeymoon.

2158
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:38,360
Big trip somewhere.

2159
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:39,360
There you go.

2160
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:41,360
And how far are you from Vegas?

2161
01:36:41,360 --> 01:36:44,840
A five hour drive.

2162
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:45,840
Very scenic.

2163
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:51,640
But you know, God, if she had her way, she's just like, let's do it on the beach, barefoot

2164
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:56,680
in the sand, you know, something quiet and simple.

2165
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:58,840
And I'm like, can we live stream it?

2166
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:04,840
Can I periscope it like, get the big sigh and the judgy face.

2167
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:10,320
Well, we're techno geeks or techno nerds, it comes with the territory.

2168
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:11,320
Right.

2169
01:37:11,320 --> 01:37:12,320
Right.

2170
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:13,320
Yeah.

2171
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:14,320
It's like, take me as I am, honey.

2172
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:15,320
Yeah.

2173
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:16,320
So it's been a while since we've interviewed you.

2174
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:19,320
I think last time was like anime and acts like 2011 or something like that.

2175
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:20,320
Back in the day.

2176
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:22,320
And it may have been the same year I was here.

2177
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:23,320
2011, 2012.

2178
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:24,320
Probably.

2179
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:25,320
It was an older venue.

2180
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:26,320
Like the hotel looked like a castle.

2181
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:27,320
I remember that.

2182
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:28,320
Yeah.

2183
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,320
Everyone was telling me about that.

2184
01:37:29,320 --> 01:37:34,400
I started coming up here to like move to this location.

2185
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:35,800
This is a pretty swanky location.

2186
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:36,800
I dig it.

2187
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:38,920
I've had a blast here every year I've gone.

2188
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:39,920
Yeah.

2189
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:40,920
Good on you.

2190
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:45,640
So, tell me, how did you get into becoming the voice of Ryu from Street Fighter?

2191
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:49,280
Man, well, like, you can actually insert this answer for anything.

2192
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,520
How did you get any fill in the blank role?

2193
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:52,520
There you go.

2194
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:53,520
You auditioned.

2195
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:55,520
But how do you audition, Kyle?

2196
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:56,520
You gotta know people.

2197
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:58,520
Well, how do you know people, Kyle?

2198
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:05,520
Well, you know, it's this long process of training first and a lot of luck.

2199
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:08,040
A lot of luck.

2200
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:12,200
You know, being in the right place at the right time, knowing the right people, getting

2201
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:16,360
on someone's radar, as it were.

2202
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:21,080
For years, I've been recording with new generation pictures on various things through the years.

2203
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:28,720
Ergo Proxy, a bunch of RPG stuff, The Dawn of Mana, I was trying to think of stuff before

2204
01:38:28,720 --> 01:38:29,720
that.

2205
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:36,800
Ultimately, I think we did like Hellsing Ultimate, I did like a mercenary guy on that.

2206
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:43,800
And because I was kind of on that list, recording with them on various anime projects and Japanese

2207
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:48,520
RPG stuff, they said, hey, we got this big project, we can't tell you what it is, in

2208
01:38:48,520 --> 01:38:52,760
fact it's so big that you have to sign an NDA just to audition.

2209
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:55,600
I go, ooh, ooh, ooh, I wonder what it is.

2210
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:59,400
So I get to the studio, I try out, and they hand me this three ring binder.

2211
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:02,640
And it says, alright, oh wait, you haven't signed the NDA yet.

2212
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:04,640
Okay, alright, sign the NDA.

2213
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:09,240
Alright, when you open this three ring binder, you will probably recognize what it is.

2214
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:10,240
Don't freak out.

2215
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:18,240
So I open this ring binder and I'm like, ooh, is this what I think he asked?

2216
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:19,240
Okay.

2217
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:21,440
It's like, pick who you want to read for.

2218
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:25,640
So naturally I had to read for you.

2219
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:33,160
Let's see, I think I read for M. Bison and oh, at least like three or four others, El

2220
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:34,160
Fuerte even.

2221
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:40,080
And I thought, okay, I don't know which one I felt the strongest about.

2222
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:46,120
But yes, I go in, do the best I can, as you do with any audition, hope for the best.

2223
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:51,000
A couple months go by, and then the director of the project, Taliesin Jaffe, he also voices

2224
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Blanca.

2225
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:56,280
He tells me at a con secretly, so I think, congrats, man, I go, on what?

2226
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:58,880
He's like, you got to read it.

2227
01:39:58,880 --> 01:39:59,880
I'm like, what?

2228
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:00,880
Really?

2229
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:01,880
He's like, oh, they didn't tell you?

2230
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:02,880
Like, no.

2231
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:06,000
I'm like, we can't talk about it.

2232
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,600
You sign these non-disclosure agreements saying, you know, you're under a gag order until the

2233
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:11,600
game comes out.

2234
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:13,120
Oh, I understand completely.

2235
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:18,680
And in this case, and is the case with many games, you know, nine months, a year, sometimes

2236
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:23,540
longer, Guild Wars was years worked on that for multiple years.

2237
01:40:23,540 --> 01:40:30,200
But Street Fighter, yeah, unreal, because not only I'm a casual gamer, I'm a casual

2238
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:34,640
crappy gamer, button masher, I lost a lot of quarters on Street Fighter, but I also

2239
01:40:34,640 --> 01:40:38,880
knew how important and iconic that series is, much less the character.

2240
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:39,880
Yes.

2241
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:45,720
So, yeah, my inner geek was definitely tingling.

2242
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:50,400
That is amazing, because I remember many of them throwing quarter after quarter after

2243
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:52,360
quarter playing Street Fighter in the arcade.

2244
01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:53,360
Oh, okay.

2245
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:54,360
Yes.

2246
01:40:54,360 --> 01:40:57,080
Yeah, and then the consoles happened, and then people stopped throwing quarters, because

2247
01:40:57,080 --> 01:41:02,440
nowadays to play a quarter game in the 80s, you'd probably pay like a dollar nowadays

2248
01:41:02,440 --> 01:41:03,440
or something.

2249
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:04,440
Yeah.

2250
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:05,440
It's nutty.

2251
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:09,960
But, you know, there are some reasons to come out, like there's some new Star Wars game

2252
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:13,720
that's only in arcades that looks amazing.

2253
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:18,180
They got to give you a reason to come out of your cave once in a while, I suppose.

2254
01:41:18,180 --> 01:41:23,640
But I mean, the Street Fighter thing, even cooler, was getting to, because I had that

2255
01:41:23,640 --> 01:41:27,200
connection to that, and then Disney made Wreck-It Ralph, and said, we're going to have

2256
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:33,160
cameos for Street Fighter characters and Sonic and all that, and they reached out and they

2257
01:41:33,160 --> 01:41:37,080
knew the fans would want the original voices.

2258
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:38,080
Good on them.

2259
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:39,080
Thank you, Disney.

2260
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:40,440
Thank you, Rich Moore, the director.

2261
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:47,720
Thank you, everybody working on that, for thinking ahead and thinking to the fans.

2262
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:53,000
That is a love story, a love letter to the fans of the whole gaming generation.

2263
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:57,520
Yeah, I remember when me and my co-owner, we went to go see Wreck-It Ralph.

2264
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:59,280
We were just waiting just to hear your voice.

2265
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:04,880
We were just screaming in the fears, because like, we know who that is, that is awesome.

2266
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:07,600
We stayed for the credits just to see your name go up in the credits.

2267
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:08,600
That's so cool.

2268
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:09,600
Thank you.

2269
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:17,120
Yeah, I went with Steve Blum and some other staffers at Anime Nebraska on opening night,

2270
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:18,120
and oh, man, I teared up.

2271
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:19,120
It was so sweet.

2272
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:20,120
It was like, oh, yeah.

2273
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:22,120
They're like, woohoo.

2274
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:23,240
Awesome.

2275
01:42:23,240 --> 01:42:27,360
And that was neat, to not only see my name on the credits under additional voices, that's

2276
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:28,360
what I expected.

2277
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:31,520
I didn't think it would say redo Kylie, they're like, what?

2278
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:37,920
You know, Ken, Ruben Langdon, all the characters got their name in the credits, you know?

2279
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:41,880
And I know a lot of people get up and leave during the credits, but for years, especially

2280
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:46,320
after being in the industry, I like seeing who did the additional voices, you know?

2281
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:48,320
You know, celebs do the main ones.

2282
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:50,520
I like to say it's like, oh, I recognize that person.

2283
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:51,520
Oh, yeah.

2284
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:56,520
And then I'll sit there and cheer, a little inner giggle and clap and all that stuff.

2285
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:58,880
So, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

2286
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:02,720
That's like my favorite achievement so far in 15 years in this industry is getting to

2287
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:05,320
do Ryu on a Disney movie.

2288
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:06,320
Nice.

2289
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:07,320
That is impressive.

2290
01:43:07,320 --> 01:43:08,320
So, again, congratulations.

2291
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:09,320
Thank you.

2292
01:43:09,320 --> 01:43:10,320
Thank you.

2293
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:14,320
So, besides fighting games, what other type of games do you like to play when you have

2294
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:16,320
the few minutes to relax?

2295
01:43:16,320 --> 01:43:18,320
Oh, man, a few minutes.

2296
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:19,320
What?

2297
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:20,320
What?

2298
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,320
I'm so ADD to begin with, too, you know?

2299
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:25,320
It's just, I put in all sorts of things.

2300
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:29,320
The latest thing I have that I want to dedicate more time to is Arkham Knight.

2301
01:43:29,320 --> 01:43:33,320
Not only is it a beautiful game, but it's a ton of fun to play.

2302
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:36,320
All the Arkham games are, you know?

2303
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:40,320
Fighting games, I still fire up Street Fighter, to be honest.

2304
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:41,320
There you go.

2305
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:42,320
It's Soul Calibur.

2306
01:43:42,320 --> 01:43:44,320
It's actually my favorite brawler.

2307
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:45,320
I love first-person shooters.

2308
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:46,320
Again, I suck at them.

2309
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:50,320
I'll be the first one to die if you play co-op with me or whatever.

2310
01:43:50,320 --> 01:43:52,320
But, yeah, Call of Duty, Halo.

2311
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,320
Can't wait for the new Halo.

2312
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:54,320
That's going to be fun.

2313
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:56,320
I'm not on it, by the way.

2314
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:57,320
I wish I was.

2315
01:43:57,320 --> 01:43:59,320
Tried out for it.

2316
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:02,320
But my favorite shooter is actually Left 4 Dead 1 and 2.

2317
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:03,320
I love that.

2318
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:05,320
I love it, love it, love it, love it.

2319
01:44:05,320 --> 01:44:07,320
And I love retro stuff, too.

2320
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:13,320
Going back to the Pac-Man, Galaga, Donkey Kong days, all that stuff.

2321
01:44:13,320 --> 01:44:14,320
Oh, yeah.

2322
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:17,320
I love playing the old school.

2323
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:22,320
We were down on Jersey Shore about a few weeks ago and there's a retro cave there.

2324
01:44:22,320 --> 01:44:23,320
I think it's like $5.

2325
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:26,320
You can play all these arcade machines for like a half hour.

2326
01:44:26,320 --> 01:44:27,320
Oh, that's beautiful.

2327
01:44:27,320 --> 01:44:30,320
And there's arcade themed bars across the country.

2328
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:33,320
You know, the cover charge and then you go in and it's unlimited play.

2329
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:38,320
So the people go in there and you see games from all different eras.

2330
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:41,320
And even like Duck Hunt at the bar and people are holding the thing.

2331
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:44,320
And like, get that dog.

2332
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,320
But everyone's not ordering drinks right away.

2333
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:49,320
They're playing games from their childhood.

2334
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:52,320
And now with Smash Brothers, you can actually go after the dog.

2335
01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:53,320
There you go.

2336
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:54,320
I'll do that.

2337
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:56,320
So this is Smash.

2338
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:57,320
Yeah.

2339
01:44:57,320 --> 01:44:58,320
Yeah, there you go.

2340
01:44:58,320 --> 01:44:59,320
There you go.

2341
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:00,320
Exactly.

2342
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:08,320
What kind of advice can you tell aspiring voice actors and actors who want to get into the industry and do this for a living?

2343
01:45:08,320 --> 01:45:10,320
Boy, I tell you.

2344
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:20,320
If you want to see it all summed up on a great website, D. Bradley Baker, who's done a ton of stuff on cartoons and games and stuff for years,

2345
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:28,320
has made a beautiful website for beginners and the curious called Iwanttobeavoiceactor.com.

2346
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:38,320
I'm endorsing it because I firmly believe that every bit of advice that he has on there, it's a wonderful blog to help give some insight to people that want to know.

2347
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:40,320
It's like, this looks like the coolest job in the world.

2348
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:42,320
And yes, it is the coolest job in the world.

2349
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:45,320
I can look like this and still voice buff young dudes.

2350
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:48,320
So hey, you know, you gotta love that.

2351
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,320
What are you talking about? You are a buff young dog.

2352
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:54,320
Yeah, I am a buff. Just close your eyes. Pretend.

2353
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:56,320
The answer lies in the heart of battle.

2354
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:59,320
Yeah, so advice, man.

2355
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:01,320
I crossed into it from radio.

2356
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:03,320
But radio's a different beast now.

2357
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:07,320
It was tough to get into radio then, 15, 20 years ago.

2358
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:10,320
Now the internet has changed the way we consume media.

2359
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:14,320
So, you know, user-generated content and all that stuff.

2360
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:18,320
But definitely practice. Start getting used to your voice.

2361
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:21,320
Record it. Read aloud. Ten minutes a day.

2362
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:24,320
That's the free thing you should be doing every day anyway.

2363
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:27,320
Overcome shyness.

2364
01:46:27,320 --> 01:46:35,320
You know, understand that it is a business, so you gotta kind of learn a business angle to it.

2365
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:38,320
Because you gotta network and you gotta market yourself.

2366
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:41,320
And you have to train. You know, you have to hone your skills.

2367
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:46,320
Doctors don't just want to be a doctor and suddenly they're carving into your heart and saving your life.

2368
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:50,320
They have to go to school and learn their craft.

2369
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:52,320
Same thing with acting.

2370
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:55,320
If you want to be on the top of your game, absolutely.

2371
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:58,320
Take acting classes. Not just voiceover classes.

2372
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:02,320
Sometimes, depending on where you are, there are no voice acting classes.

2373
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:05,320
So don't throw up your arms and just say, oh, I give up.

2374
01:47:05,320 --> 01:47:08,320
No. Take advantage of any sort of acting class.

2375
01:47:08,320 --> 01:47:12,320
Or ability. Or opportunity, rather.

2376
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:15,320
You know, theater. Student film.

2377
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:18,320
But I want to do voiceover. I want to be on camera.

2378
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:21,320
You never know. Take the journey. Be open-minded.

2379
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:26,320
Because you might discover along the way that you have an affinity for something else.

2380
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:31,320
Like directing or something technical behind the scenes. Audio production or whatnot.

2381
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:35,320
But nowadays you kind of have to be a jack-of-all-trades. Especially because of the internet.

2382
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:38,320
Voice actors have to know to record themselves at home.

2383
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:43,320
So you've got to learn some basic stuff. Editing and production skills and all that.

2384
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:47,320
Learn some techniques and soundproofing.

2385
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:49,320
Be able to record in your closet.

2386
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:52,320
Clothing. You don't have to spend a fortune.

2387
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:55,320
Clothing and boxes are great insulators for sound.

2388
01:47:55,320 --> 01:48:01,320
So if you record in your closet or have a little corner of your apartment or home that's quiet.

2389
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:09,320
And doesn't have your voice reverberating off the sides of the walls, then that's something to consider as well.

2390
01:48:09,320 --> 01:48:15,320
Ultimately, depending on your goals in voiceover, the most money you can make is commercials.

2391
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:18,320
That's the most lucrative. Especially a national ad campaign.

2392
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:21,320
You could stand to make residuals from that.

2393
01:48:21,320 --> 01:48:31,320
I think Carlos Lazroqui, who was the voice of Okiyara Taco Bell years ago, he bought a house with those words.

2394
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:33,320
Think about that. That's incredible.

2395
01:48:33,320 --> 01:48:36,320
There's no residuals in games and animation and certainly not anime.

2396
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:43,320
Anime pays. Games are on fire right now.

2397
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:45,320
And in animation too.

2398
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:52,320
But in LA, Los Angeles is the hub for the most variety and the most different companies doing that sort of thing.

2399
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:56,320
But commercial work, radio TV commercials, any major hub.

2400
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:59,320
We're close to Boston pretty much here.

2401
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:11,320
So Boston is a great place to go to if you need to go and learn the craft of acting and get into some commercial stuff.

2402
01:49:11,320 --> 01:49:14,320
Once you're trained, then this is the demo phase.

2403
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:17,320
Now, you can practice at home and record demos and all that.

2404
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:24,320
As it evolves, you can take different little excerpts and put them in different order and everything.

2405
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:32,320
But once you start training with the pros and accredited, actual legit VO coaches who have testimonials from students and all that stuff,

2406
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:39,320
they'll point you in the direction of demo producers who can give you the most bang for your buck.

2407
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:44,320
And it is expensive. A top notch LA quality demo will run you about 1500 bucks.

2408
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:47,320
It's a tax write off because we're freelance.

2409
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:53,320
Anything having to do with equipment purchases, the classes you take, all that's a tax deduction.

2410
01:49:53,320 --> 01:49:55,320
So Uncle Sam treats you back.

2411
01:49:55,320 --> 01:49:58,320
So think of it that way. It's an investment in your craft.

2412
01:49:58,320 --> 01:50:02,320
So train. After you train and get experience, demo.

2413
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:05,320
After your demo, market it to casting people.

2414
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:07,320
How do you know where to send it?

2415
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:09,320
Look it up online. Google is your friend.

2416
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:11,320
Talk and network with other actors.

2417
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:14,320
Use the internet to your advantage.

2418
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:17,320
Join forums and discussion boards, Facebook groups.

2419
01:50:17,320 --> 01:50:26,320
Tons of them are out there featuring tons of voice talent from all over the world who can help you with their own experiences and ideas.

2420
01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:28,320
But everyone's path is unique.

2421
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:33,320
You can take all the classes in the world, be super talented and still not book a gig.

2422
01:50:33,320 --> 01:50:38,320
But you have to have a thick skin. You have to have passion and determination.

2423
01:50:38,320 --> 01:50:41,320
And you've got to do it for the love.

2424
01:50:41,320 --> 01:50:43,320
Yeah, you want to make a living doing it.

2425
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:47,320
And that's the end goal. But you're not going to be able to do it overnight.

2426
01:50:47,320 --> 01:50:51,320
The people that do just walk into an audition and suddenly their career is on fire, that's so rare.

2427
01:50:51,320 --> 01:50:53,320
So don't have that to do.

2428
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:59,320
Just say to yourself, I see myself doing this. I want to do it so bad that I can't imagine doing anything else.

2429
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:04,320
You take all the rejections from the auditions like it's nothing.

2430
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:07,320
It just floats off your arms and you're like, whatever.

2431
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:09,320
Give me the next one. I'm good to go.

2432
01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:17,320
And then, hopefully, after all that, after years of that mental torture and oh my god, I can't believe I'm doing this.

2433
01:51:17,320 --> 01:51:20,320
And your parents and your family and friends going, why don't you get a real job?

2434
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:25,320
Then maybe, maybe, just maybe, you'll make a little progress.

2435
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:29,320
Hey, that's motivation. I mean, thank you, man. I appreciate it.

2436
01:51:29,320 --> 01:51:31,320
Yeah, absolutely. Sure thing.

2437
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:34,320
It's Kyle Aver, ladies and gentlemen. Definitely check him out.

2438
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:39,320
And Street Fighter. My favorite album is Naruto.

2439
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:42,320
Gurren Lagann and a few others. Definitely check it out.

2440
01:51:42,320 --> 01:51:44,320
Rock and roll. Thanks a lot, guys.

2441
01:51:44,320 --> 01:51:45,320
No problem.

2442
01:51:45,320 --> 01:51:54,320
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

2443
01:51:54,320 --> 01:52:00,320
And a big thanks to DJ Rama S from Anime Jam Session for that interview with Kyle Hebert,

2444
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:04,320
which, you know, given some great advice for aspiring voice actors there in that interview.

2445
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:08,320
And we love to kind of hear, you know, I know there's a lot of people that aspire to do that sort of stuff,

2446
01:52:08,320 --> 01:52:10,320
so I always love hearing the experts giving some advice.

2447
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:14,320
So, a big thank you very much to DJ Rama S for that.

2448
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:19,320
You can hear Anime Jam Sessions Tuesday night live here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

2449
01:52:19,320 --> 01:52:23,320
Check your local listings over at vognetwork.com for your time zone.

2450
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:29,320
We're going to get into some rapid fire news here, and then we're going to get into list lists coming up in a little bit,

2451
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:31,320
and I'll tell you what the topic is in just a moment.

2452
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:38,320
Flaco Jones and Shane stepped out for a minute. They ran to do a dessert run for us. Oink, oink.

2453
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:44,320
But we're going to get into some rapid fire news, and they should be back about the time we're going to get to list lists.

2454
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:47,320
So, let's get to rapid fire news with Loki.

2455
01:52:47,320 --> 01:52:50,320
So, they're going to make some more pinball tables.

2456
01:52:50,320 --> 01:52:56,320
What is this? For Zen Pinball or Pinball FX2.

2457
01:52:56,320 --> 01:53:04,320
And with it now, of course, adding to all the different tables that I think we mentioned before in the Balls of Glory set

2458
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:07,320
with Family Guy, American Dad, and Bob's Burgers.

2459
01:53:07,320 --> 01:53:09,320
Archer. They're going to have an Archer table.

2460
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:12,320
Oh, fuck, that's awesome. I love Archer.

2461
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:17,320
So, that would be pretty awesome. I'd have to definitely check that out.

2462
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:25,320
When is that expected out? Not sure yet, but I guess whenever that Balls of Glory set comes out, that would be pretty epic.

2463
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:27,320
So, I'll have to check it out.

2464
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:34,320
Rocket League is getting some DLC, I'm sure, to tie in with the anniversary of Back to the Future.

2465
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:40,320
Plus, the fact that they're going to have was a Back to the Future 2 date.

2466
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:43,320
And the fact that's actually when it's coming out.

2467
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:51,320
October 21st for $1.99, you'll be able to get a DeLorean for Rocket League.

2468
01:53:51,320 --> 01:53:56,320
October 21st, the date that they travel to the future in and Back to the Future 2.

2469
01:53:57,320 --> 01:54:03,320
The same day you can get Pepsi, what's it called? The Pepsi from the movie? Pepsi Perfect?

2470
01:54:03,320 --> 01:54:05,320
I think it's Pepsi Perfect, yeah.

2471
01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:08,320
I will have to try that. Where's that being sold?

2472
01:54:08,320 --> 01:54:10,320
I think, like, online.

2473
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:12,320
Why don't you just be regular, crappy Pepsi?

2474
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:14,320
If you didn't already get it, I think you're shit out of line.

2475
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:17,320
Who cares? I don't. You know, whatever.

2476
01:54:17,320 --> 01:54:23,320
And last but not least, yet another game getting microtransactions.

2477
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:31,320
They're getting microtransactions, I guess, and it's the only way you can unlock some certain cosmetic and stat-boosting items.

2478
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:44,320
With that, there's going to be a black market update for $19.99, which introduces, I guess, loot drop safes that can only be opened using an item purchased with real money.

2479
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:54,320
Whoa, hold on a second. So I have to purchase... do I have to purchase this update for $19.99 and then they want me to buy these safe keys?

2480
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:56,320
That's kind of what it sounds like.

2481
01:54:56,320 --> 01:55:02,320
Why would I pay money for an update to buy...

2482
01:55:02,320 --> 01:55:06,320
You're going to pay money for the right to buy more. It's like conventions.

2483
01:55:06,320 --> 01:55:09,320
You're going to pay in a free fee to get in and then get all these vendors.

2484
01:55:09,320 --> 01:55:13,320
At least the convention has panels for free, though, once you get in.

2485
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:16,320
Yeah, that's kind of lame, but all right.

2486
01:55:16,320 --> 01:55:24,320
By the way, this is why I love doing the show live because there's always listeners here ready to correct us when we fuck up the facts or just are kind of clueless.

2487
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:29,320
Dark Tetsuya says it's a limited edition deal. This is the Pepsi for $20.15 a bottle.

2488
01:55:29,320 --> 01:55:33,320
Sj100Matt says I'll get that Pepsi perfect and dump it out for the bottle.

2489
01:55:33,320 --> 01:55:37,320
So I guess the black market update's free. The game's $20.

2490
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:41,320
Brad from Pod Culture says it is just real sugar Pepsi.

2491
01:55:41,320 --> 01:55:44,320
So thank you for the listeners at live.vognetwork.com.

2492
01:55:44,320 --> 01:55:47,320
All we need is throwback.

2493
01:55:47,320 --> 01:55:51,320
All right. Moving on to some Nintendo news.

2494
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:56,320
Some big maintenance for Nintendo's birthday. Well, tomorrow is the day after their birthday, I suppose.

2495
01:55:56,320 --> 01:56:05,320
But Monday, October 19th, from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Pacific time, Nintendo's online services will be down.

2496
01:56:05,320 --> 01:56:09,320
And it's like everything. So you want to play a Wii U game online? Too bad.

2497
01:56:09,320 --> 01:56:16,320
You can't even go shopping on the 3DS or the Wii U tomorrow. It is all going to be down, down, down.

2498
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:22,320
So, yep, you'll have to. I don't know why. I don't know if it's to patch some type of exploit or something.

2499
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:28,320
Actually, we have something coming up a little later that perhaps it is patching some type of exploit or what they're doing.

2500
01:56:29,320 --> 01:56:35,320
Some pretty controversial news this week. Star Wars Battlefront announced their season pass.

2501
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:40,320
It is $50. $50 season pass for a $60 game.

2502
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:42,320
Fuck that.

2503
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:51,320
The season pass is going to be good for four expansions, a two-week early access to each piece of DLC, and a shoot-first emote.

2504
01:56:51,320 --> 01:56:57,320
So, you know, because you're going to shoot first on picking up this season pack. I don't know.

2505
01:56:57,320 --> 01:57:03,320
There's also what they call an ultimate edition of Battlefront. It's the deluxe edition with the season pass.

2506
01:57:03,320 --> 01:57:10,320
$120. That is a savings of $0 because the deluxe edition is already $70.

2507
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:18,320
So, there you go. If you are really into Star Wars Battlefront, have fun with that season pass.

2508
01:57:18,320 --> 01:57:26,320
I don't know. A lot of what I'm hearing about Battlefront is that it's just, or I'm sorry, what I'm hearing about Star Wars Battlefront is that it's just Battlefield with a Star Wars skin.

2509
01:57:26,320 --> 01:57:31,320
But I'm like, isn't that what people wanted? Because, I don't know, it still looks kind of awesome.

2510
01:57:31,320 --> 01:57:39,320
I don't know if I'd play a lot of it and I certainly wouldn't spend $50 on the season pass and I don't even really know all what I'm getting, but I don't know.

2511
01:57:39,320 --> 01:57:42,320
I thought that's what people wanted.

2512
01:57:42,320 --> 01:57:48,320
I think, I don't know. I mean, I wish there was like a single-player campaign instead of just the survival modes.

2513
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:52,320
Yeah, that part kind of sucks. I will go with you on that.

2514
01:57:53,320 --> 01:58:00,320
Let's see. Also, Square Enix considering doing some localization via crowdfunding.

2515
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:06,320
That's right. This is a comment from Square Enix Europe CEO Phil Rogers in an interview with Game Informer.

2516
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:10,320
Localization is a topic that comes up a lot and we understand why it does.

2517
01:58:10,320 --> 01:58:17,320
To a great extent, in a really positive way, we're absolutely humbled that we have this loyal and dedicated fan base that wants to give us the feedback.

2518
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:21,320
We're constantly working with the teams in Tokyo to show them this and work with them there.

2519
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:29,320
The simple truth is that in some ways, the development process and the tools, it's not always an easy undertaking to reopen a game and add localization subsequently.

2520
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:36,320
But I think as we go forward with the way the group is working technically and the way it's now thinking globally, I'm really hoping that in the next 10 years,

2521
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:43,320
localization is seen as pleasing all our fans because it's truly global and the methods in which we can localize now are vastly improved.

2522
01:58:43,320 --> 01:58:48,320
I think this is why you're seeing more of their games come out worldwide and you don't have that big gap.

2523
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:55,320
Final Fantasy games used to come out years in advance over there, which is why we missed a bunch in the early days during the Super Nintendo days.

2524
01:58:55,320 --> 01:58:59,320
By the way, he went on to talk about the crowdfunding specifically.

2525
01:58:59,320 --> 01:59:05,320
I would love to try and work with that crowdfunding to find a way because ultimately we want to satisfy the demands of the fans.

2526
01:59:05,320 --> 01:59:09,320
I think also our fans are very rational. They understand and if we explain things, they often go,

2527
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:17,320
Oh, I get that now. Thanks for explaining. They know it's complex or it's very expensive and it's not as simply, as you say, as using Google Translate.

2528
01:59:17,320 --> 01:59:22,320
You would not want to localize something through Google Translate. That wouldn't work.

2529
01:59:22,320 --> 01:59:29,320
I understand you sometimes have to actually go in and change the size.

2530
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:35,320
I know that's what made translating a lot of the Super Nintendo games a bitch because they actually had to change the size of the cartridge

2531
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:39,320
because English text is a different size than Japanese text.

2532
01:59:39,320 --> 01:59:46,320
Anyway, I won't get into all the this's and that's of that. I will move on to Jamie with her rapid fire news.

2533
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:49,320
I have some news about Super Mario Maker.

2534
01:59:49,320 --> 01:59:54,320
They are doing some different costumes that have been out in Japan already.

2535
01:59:54,320 --> 02:00:01,320
One was Famitsu's Neki, the cat mascot. Another one is Game Center CX's Arino.

2536
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:12,320
And so now there is going to be one based off of Yukio Sawada's manga called Super Mario-kun with big butt and big eyes.

2537
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:17,320
It's supposed to be coming out November 6th and I kind of hope we get it here.

2538
02:00:17,320 --> 02:00:25,320
So moving on, they are doing Splatoon All-Star Collection plushies and they are available to pre-order now.

2539
02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:34,320
You can order them via Playasia in the US or I guess no matter where you are in the world, really, you can order them from Playasia.

2540
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:37,320
They are supposed to be released on December 25th.

2541
02:00:37,320 --> 02:00:44,320
And then, last but not least, there is going to be a new Dead or Alive Xtreme this spring.

2542
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:52,320
There will be Dead or Alive Xtreme 3 Fortune for PS4 and Dead or Alive Xtreme 3 Venus for Vita.

2543
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:56,320
It's supposed to be on March 25th.

2544
02:00:56,320 --> 02:01:11,320
Fortune will be 95.04 yen and the collector's edition will be 149.04 and relatively a little bit cheaper for Vita.

2545
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:21,320
The character roster is supposed to be Marie Rose, Ohonaka, Kasumi, Ayane, Kokoro, Niotengu, Hitomi, Momiji, and Helena.

2546
02:01:21,320 --> 02:01:25,320
So, there you go. Volleyball and boobs.

2547
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:28,320
I'm sure you're very much looking forward to this, right, DarkSakura?

2548
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:32,320
I just want Dan to get it so I can laugh about him playing dress-up.

2549
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:35,320
It's Barbie for boys, right? That's just all it is.

2550
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:37,320
Yeah, it's funny actually.

2551
02:01:37,320 --> 02:01:43,320
Alright, well, this is about the point in the show where we get to the foogle question of the week.

2552
02:01:44,320 --> 02:01:48,320
But I actually want to talk quickly about tonight's list list, which I hope...

2553
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:53,320
There must have been a line where Shane and Flaco went. They're not back yet.

2554
02:01:53,320 --> 02:01:55,320
They went to Dunkin Donuts where I had to wait for 30 minutes.

2555
02:01:55,320 --> 02:01:57,320
Was the line really that bad over there?

2556
02:01:57,320 --> 02:02:01,320
Yeah, they finally opened at Dunkin here in NorCal and you know I want my coffee.

2557
02:02:01,320 --> 02:02:05,320
I can't handle the line that's over there right now. It's crazy.

2558
02:02:05,320 --> 02:02:07,320
So, you went there last night though, right?

2559
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:11,320
Yeah, we were there for about 30 minutes and I got my favorite donut that they carry.

2560
02:02:11,320 --> 02:02:12,320
What was that?

2561
02:02:12,320 --> 02:02:15,320
It was the powdered donut with the chocolate cream.

2562
02:02:15,320 --> 02:02:17,320
Was the line going out the door like it was?

2563
02:02:17,320 --> 02:02:19,320
No, it was going into the bathroom.

2564
02:02:19,320 --> 02:02:22,320
We had people in the men's bathroom with the door open.

2565
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:24,320
That's strange.

2566
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:26,320
But they also had the pumpkin donuts. Those were pretty good.

2567
02:02:26,320 --> 02:02:28,320
The pumpkin spice ones.

2568
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:30,320
And they were like regular cost.

2569
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:32,320
And the chocolate cakes.

2570
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:34,320
We're giving them free advertising right now.

2571
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:36,320
Who the fuck cares? I love it.

2572
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:38,320
It's the new thing here.

2573
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:40,320
I bought two bags of coffee as well.

2574
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:45,320
So, Dan was like, well, they have one in Roseville. I guess we'll get one in Elk Grove next because we have to do everything that Roseville does.

2575
02:02:45,320 --> 02:02:47,320
Probably.

2576
02:02:47,320 --> 02:02:51,320
Anyway, tonight's list list, just so you guys can start thinking about the topic.

2577
02:02:51,320 --> 02:02:59,320
We are going to do for tonight's list list, in celebration of the Nintendo Entertainment System's 30th anniversary, we're going to do a Nest Center topic.

2578
02:02:59,320 --> 02:03:03,320
We were going to do best Nintendo game ever, but we all know the Guardian Legend would win.

2579
02:03:03,320 --> 02:03:05,320
So, that's pretty much a moot point.

2580
02:03:05,320 --> 02:03:09,320
We're going to do the worst Nintendo game they ever made.

2581
02:03:09,320 --> 02:03:11,320
Is tonight's list list.

2582
02:03:11,320 --> 02:03:13,320
So, stay tuned for that. We will get to that shortly.

2583
02:03:13,320 --> 02:03:16,320
But first, the foogle question of the week.

2584
02:03:22,320 --> 02:03:26,320
Every week we visit our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.

2585
02:03:26,320 --> 02:03:30,320
And you take Facebook and Google and you slam those together and you get what everybody?

2586
02:03:30,320 --> 02:03:32,320
Foogle!

2587
02:03:32,320 --> 02:03:34,320
So, let's get to it.

2588
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:38,320
This week's question, very similar to what we opened the show with tonight.

2589
02:03:38,320 --> 02:03:42,320
We asked our listeners about the 30th anniversary of the Nintendo Entertainment System.

2590
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:47,320
And, you know, if they have a particular game that they have fond memories of from the NES days.

2591
02:03:47,320 --> 02:03:51,320
What is their one favorite NES game?

2592
02:03:51,320 --> 02:03:53,320
So, let's get to Google Plus first.

2593
02:03:53,320 --> 02:03:58,320
And Retertainment starts us off tonight simply saying Tetris.

2594
02:03:58,320 --> 02:04:01,320
That was an amazing NES game.

2595
02:04:01,320 --> 02:04:07,320
And the music still to this day gets stuck in your head and makes you think of falling bricks.

2596
02:04:07,320 --> 02:04:10,320
ActDeft over on Google Plus says there are so many to choose.

2597
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:14,320
But if I only have to pick one, it would probably be Kirby's Adventure.

2598
02:04:14,320 --> 02:04:16,320
My first Kirby experience.

2599
02:04:16,320 --> 02:04:18,320
I'm not surprised at all to hear ActDeft picking that one.

2600
02:04:18,320 --> 02:04:20,320
But you know what's interesting about that?

2601
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:22,320
That was kind of a later Nintendo release.

2602
02:04:22,320 --> 02:04:24,320
Kirby's release was really, it wasn't the last.

2603
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:26,320
I know Warriors Woods was the last one.

2604
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:29,320
Or that or StarTropics 2. One of those was the last one.

2605
02:04:29,320 --> 02:04:36,320
But that Kirby was kind of a later release for the NES.

2606
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:39,320
Let's go over to Facebook where Stephen D. replies and says,

2607
02:04:39,320 --> 02:04:43,320
Zelda, I remember my friend slept over to pull an all-night Zelda-thon

2608
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:46,320
only to find my brother took the nest to his friend's house.

2609
02:04:46,320 --> 02:04:48,320
We stared at the map that night.

2610
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:53,320
I also recall being in tears because a dark nut wouldn't die.

2611
02:04:53,320 --> 02:04:56,320
That's right. Some of those things you had to know exactly how to kill them.

2612
02:04:56,320 --> 02:04:58,320
And otherwise you couldn't do it.

2613
02:04:58,320 --> 02:05:03,320
Renji221 responded and said, I think I would have to say Super Mario 3.

2614
02:05:03,320 --> 02:05:07,320
While I don't think it's the best in the series, that would be Mario World.

2615
02:05:07,320 --> 02:05:10,320
I do think it had really good levels and a nice set of power-ups.

2616
02:05:10,320 --> 02:05:13,320
I think for a lot of people those two games are neck and neck.

2617
02:05:13,320 --> 02:05:19,320
Fifth Dream says, it's so hard to pick, but I choose Kid Nicky, Radical Ninja.

2618
02:05:19,320 --> 02:05:21,320
It wasn't the best game and the graphics weren't great.

2619
02:05:21,320 --> 02:05:24,320
But I played it a lot despite dying constantly.

2620
02:05:24,320 --> 02:05:30,320
And the background soundtrack is the most awesome, annoying, repetitive, catchy, and memorable music ever.

2621
02:05:30,320 --> 02:05:33,320
The bosses were pretty silly and really fun to fight.

2622
02:05:33,320 --> 02:05:36,320
I had so much fun playing this and remember it fondly to this day.

2623
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:39,320
I actually posted a little YouTube there of Kid Nicky. I remember that game.

2624
02:05:41,320 --> 02:05:43,320
Degenerate Johnny said, Metroid.

2625
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:46,320
Not only was it the NES title I had the most fun playing,

2626
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:52,320
but the idea of me playing a badass female character helped me get over the cootie phase of my life.

2627
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:54,320
That's a good way of putting it.

2628
02:05:54,320 --> 02:05:58,320
That was so important what they did there with that game.

2629
02:05:58,320 --> 02:06:00,320
That whole twist ending.

2630
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:03,320
That was very, very big in gaming.

2631
02:06:03,320 --> 02:06:07,320
Except Guardian Legend went all that from the very get-go of the game.

2632
02:06:07,320 --> 02:06:09,320
That is true, but it did come a few years after.

2633
02:06:09,320 --> 02:06:11,320
A little bit, yeah. But still.

2634
02:06:11,320 --> 02:06:12,320
That's true.

2635
02:06:13,320 --> 02:06:16,320
Cell Agent Why Not replies and says,

2636
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:20,320
Has to be Metal Gear, hands down, then Super Mario Bros.

2637
02:06:20,320 --> 02:06:27,320
You know, some people, like purists, consider Metal Gear to be trash on the NES

2638
02:06:27,320 --> 02:06:30,320
because it's so different from the MSX version.

2639
02:06:30,320 --> 02:06:34,320
But I also understand, I'm actually not one of those people

2640
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:38,320
because so many of us got introduced from that version

2641
02:06:38,320 --> 02:06:41,320
which to then hear it's a sub-par version is like,

2642
02:06:41,320 --> 02:06:43,320
my God, this game is amazing.

2643
02:06:43,320 --> 02:06:45,320
So, anyway, there you go.

2644
02:06:45,320 --> 02:06:47,320
SHO 100 Matt says,

2645
02:06:47,320 --> 02:06:49,320
It's so hard to pick one game.

2646
02:06:49,320 --> 02:06:51,320
While you might think I would say Blades of Steel,

2647
02:06:51,320 --> 02:06:53,320
I'm going to go with Super Mario Bros. 3.

2648
02:06:53,320 --> 02:06:56,320
The game had so much depth and challenge behind it

2649
02:06:56,320 --> 02:06:58,320
that you could beat it a dozen or so different ways.

2650
02:06:58,320 --> 02:07:01,320
Not only that, it was featured in one of the big movies from my childhood,

2651
02:07:01,320 --> 02:07:03,320
The Wizard.

2652
02:07:03,320 --> 02:07:05,320
It's so bad.

2653
02:07:05,320 --> 02:07:07,320
Joe G. replied and said,

2654
02:07:07,320 --> 02:07:10,320
Super Mario 3 because it was the first game I ever finished.

2655
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:12,320
Well, that's important.

2656
02:07:12,320 --> 02:07:14,320
Mako Chan says,

2657
02:07:14,320 --> 02:07:17,320
Mickey Mouse Capade was my favorite and my first game

2658
02:07:17,320 --> 02:07:20,320
besides the one bundled with my system, Mario Bros. and Hogan's Alley.

2659
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:24,320
My love for it is completely nostalgic as the game itself was annoying

2660
02:07:24,320 --> 02:07:27,320
and many pissed me off half the time,

2661
02:07:27,320 --> 02:07:30,320
but I had so much fun playing it when I was little.

2662
02:07:30,320 --> 02:07:32,320
Silent Tom says,

2663
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:34,320
The Legend of Zelda, it's the game that has become a part of my life

2664
02:07:34,320 --> 02:07:37,320
and the music is something I always hear in my mind.

2665
02:07:37,320 --> 02:07:39,320
Dark Tetsuya says,

2666
02:07:39,320 --> 02:07:41,320
I'm sure I've told the story about a hundred times,

2667
02:07:41,320 --> 02:07:43,320
so I'll spare you guys and just say The Legend of Zelda.

2668
02:07:43,320 --> 02:07:45,320
Obviously, it was a very special game

2669
02:07:45,320 --> 02:07:48,320
having shipped on a glistening gold game pack,

2670
02:07:48,320 --> 02:07:50,320
which it was.

2671
02:07:50,320 --> 02:07:52,320
I saw a gold game pack today and I got so excited,

2672
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:54,320
but it wasn't Zelda.

2673
02:07:54,320 --> 02:07:56,320
It was some other NES game they'd released.

2674
02:07:56,320 --> 02:07:58,320
By the way, Flocko and Chain are back in studio and brought food.

2675
02:07:58,320 --> 02:08:00,320
Thank you.

2676
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:02,320
Dairy Queen!

2677
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:04,320
Is this really a pumpkin blizzard?

2678
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:06,320
I'm so excited.

2679
02:08:06,320 --> 02:08:08,320
It's pumpkin pie.

2680
02:08:08,320 --> 02:08:10,320
It's not baby poop, Chain.

2681
02:08:10,320 --> 02:08:12,320
Baby poop blizzard.

2682
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:14,320
It looks like it.

2683
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:16,320
Lastly, Master Claw says,

2684
02:08:16,320 --> 02:08:18,320
I know almost everyone has already said this,

2685
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:20,320
but Super Mario Bros. 3,

2686
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:22,320
I remember seeing it in trailers for the wizard

2687
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:24,320
and in the movie itself and knowing I have to have it.

2688
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:26,320
I remember my parents bringing me to electronics boutique

2689
02:08:26,320 --> 02:08:28,320
and buying it for me

2690
02:08:28,320 --> 02:08:30,320
and many, many years of playing it on my NES.

2691
02:08:30,320 --> 02:08:34,320
It's still one of my three favorite games.

2692
02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:36,320
There it is.

2693
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:38,320
We're going to do a few more stories here

2694
02:08:38,320 --> 02:08:40,320
and then we're going to get to tonight's list list.

2695
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:42,320
Worst Nintendo game ever.

2696
02:08:42,320 --> 02:08:44,320
It was a fukou question.

2697
02:08:44,320 --> 02:08:46,320
We didn't get to answer.

2698
02:08:46,320 --> 02:08:48,320
It was the same thing we did at the beginning of the show.

2699
02:08:48,320 --> 02:08:50,320
Yes, you did get to answer.

2700
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:52,320
You changed your answer?

2701
02:08:52,320 --> 02:08:54,320
I picked two, which wasn't following the rules.

2702
02:08:54,320 --> 02:08:56,320
Now you're going to really not follow it.

2703
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:58,320
I'm going to delete those two and pick just one

2704
02:08:58,320 --> 02:09:00,320
because I don't know why I didn't say it

2705
02:09:00,320 --> 02:09:02,320
and I didn't hear what the other people said.

2706
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:04,320
Hopefully someone else called out too because it's amazing.

2707
02:09:04,320 --> 02:09:06,320
Did anybody say Contra?

2708
02:09:06,320 --> 02:09:08,320
I love Contra.

2709
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:10,320
I played it so much.

2710
02:09:10,320 --> 02:09:12,320
I was able to beat that game with co-op

2711
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:14,320
in under 20 minutes.

2712
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:16,320
It was so much fun.

2713
02:09:16,320 --> 02:09:18,320
I started recording my runs on VCR

2714
02:09:18,320 --> 02:09:20,320
just to see, this is what I do.

2715
02:09:20,320 --> 02:09:22,320
Contra is pretty hard.

2716
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:24,320
I know, but I got so good at it.

2717
02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:26,320
I think that's why I liked it so much.

2718
02:09:26,320 --> 02:09:28,320
Oh, that game is impossible.

2719
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:30,320
Hello, employer. This is my resume.

2720
02:09:30,320 --> 02:09:32,320
Did you ever see the differences with the Japanese version?

2721
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:34,320
I had extra animations that weren't in the US release.

2722
02:09:34,320 --> 02:09:36,320
I had no idea.

2723
02:09:36,320 --> 02:09:38,320
Yeah, there's comparisons online. They're pretty cool.

2724
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:40,320
I love watching the speedruns of it,

2725
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:42,320
but those guys kill their fingers.

2726
02:09:42,320 --> 02:09:44,320
They just mash, mash, mash, mash to get that.

2727
02:09:44,320 --> 02:09:46,320
You got to get that spread gun at a certain rate

2728
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:48,320
where it actually shoots straight

2729
02:09:48,320 --> 02:09:50,320
but shoots so much at once

2730
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:52,320
because something about the number of frames

2731
02:09:52,320 --> 02:09:54,320
that could be on screen, I don't know.

2732
02:09:54,320 --> 02:09:56,320
It was way over my head.

2733
02:09:56,320 --> 02:09:58,320
I didn't even do that stuff.

2734
02:09:58,320 --> 02:10:00,320
They could beat the game in 8 minutes or 10 minutes.

2735
02:10:01,320 --> 02:10:03,320
I don't know about right now,

2736
02:10:03,320 --> 02:10:05,320
but I think I tried to play it

2737
02:10:05,320 --> 02:10:07,320
on an emulator a few years ago,

2738
02:10:07,320 --> 02:10:09,320
and I was still pretty good at it,

2739
02:10:09,320 --> 02:10:11,320
but definitely not like I used to.

2740
02:10:11,320 --> 02:10:13,320
I could still beat it in 20 minutes,

2741
02:10:13,320 --> 02:10:15,320
but not without the Konami code.

2742
02:10:15,320 --> 02:10:17,320
I'd challenge you to come to my house,

2743
02:10:17,320 --> 02:10:19,320
sit down with my NES in the cartridge,

2744
02:10:19,320 --> 02:10:21,320
and run through it.

2745
02:10:21,320 --> 02:10:23,320
Oh my gosh, I would love to try it again,

2746
02:10:23,320 --> 02:10:25,320
especially with a real controller.

2747
02:10:25,320 --> 02:10:27,320
I would borrow somebody's box to stream that.

2748
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:29,320
I would have to practice for streaming that.

2749
02:10:30,320 --> 02:10:32,320
I would get together with my friend Ken,

2750
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:34,320
and we would just play that every weekend.

2751
02:10:34,320 --> 02:10:36,320
We were good at the co-op mode, too.

2752
02:10:36,320 --> 02:10:38,320
Even though you had to time things,

2753
02:10:38,320 --> 02:10:40,320
especially on the waterfall level,

2754
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:42,320
where you're both in sync,

2755
02:10:42,320 --> 02:10:44,320
otherwise you kill each other.

2756
02:10:44,320 --> 02:10:46,320
We still used the Konami code on that,

2757
02:10:46,320 --> 02:10:48,320
but for single player, I would not use the Konami code.

2758
02:10:48,320 --> 02:10:50,320
That was one of the first experiences

2759
02:10:50,320 --> 02:10:52,320
of the dick your friends type of thing

2760
02:10:52,320 --> 02:10:54,320
where you could kill people on purpose.

2761
02:10:54,320 --> 02:10:56,320
That always goes over popular.

2762
02:10:56,320 --> 02:10:58,320
For me, it was one of the first games

2763
02:10:58,320 --> 02:11:00,320
for me. I didn't play a lot of games with friends.

2764
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:02,320
I didn't have a ton of friends,

2765
02:11:02,320 --> 02:11:04,320
but that one was like,

2766
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:06,320
oh yeah, let's play this every weekend.

2767
02:11:06,320 --> 02:11:08,320
So much fun.

2768
02:11:08,320 --> 02:11:10,320
You know the biggest dick your friends game was, Battle Toads.

2769
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:12,320
That's a pretty big one, too.

2770
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:14,320
Anyhow, let's get back into some news here.

2771
02:11:14,320 --> 02:11:16,320
Loki.

2772
02:11:16,320 --> 02:11:18,320
Apparently the launch for Metal Gear Online

2773
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:20,320
was a little bit...

2774
02:11:20,320 --> 02:11:22,320
not great.

2775
02:11:22,320 --> 02:11:24,320
Most online games are like that,

2776
02:11:24,320 --> 02:11:26,320
but Konami is saying sorry

2777
02:11:26,320 --> 02:11:30,320
by giving everybody 3000 GP,

2778
02:11:30,320 --> 02:11:33,320
and then they're also extending the XP boost period

2779
02:11:33,320 --> 02:11:35,320
to three weeks instead of two.

2780
02:11:35,320 --> 02:11:38,320
And I wonder if you can use that...

2781
02:11:38,320 --> 02:11:40,320
if you're supposed to use that GP for the insurance

2782
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:42,320
that they announced the other week, right?

2783
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:44,320
They have to pay for real money for...

2784
02:11:44,320 --> 02:11:46,320
That's what I was just about to say,

2785
02:11:46,320 --> 02:11:48,320
so I can get the free insurance to block other players

2786
02:11:48,320 --> 02:11:50,320
from taking my shit.

2787
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:52,320
Which I still don't...

2788
02:11:52,320 --> 02:11:54,320
Yeah.

2789
02:11:55,320 --> 02:11:57,320
Konami saying sorry?

2790
02:11:57,320 --> 02:11:59,320
Are they apologizing with Silent Hills?

2791
02:12:03,320 --> 02:12:06,320
See, that would have been the clickbait headline.

2792
02:12:06,320 --> 02:12:08,320
If VOG Network had a bunch of clickbait headlines,

2793
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:10,320
that would have been it.

2794
02:12:10,320 --> 02:12:13,320
You won't believe what Konami just apologized for.

2795
02:12:13,320 --> 02:12:15,320
Click here to find out.

2796
02:12:15,320 --> 02:12:17,320
And then it would be a picture of Silent Hill,

2797
02:12:17,320 --> 02:12:19,320
but then when you click in the article,

2798
02:12:19,320 --> 02:12:21,320
it would just say like,

2799
02:12:21,320 --> 02:12:23,320
Konami has pissed a lot of people off over Silent Hill,

2800
02:12:23,320 --> 02:12:24,320
and then the picture under it would be,

2801
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:26,320
but they talked about Metal Gear this week.

2802
02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:27,320
God.

2803
02:12:27,320 --> 02:12:28,320
All right.

2804
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:30,320
Well, earlier I talked about some Nintendo data mining,

2805
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:32,320
and this could be the reason

2806
02:12:32,320 --> 02:12:34,320
that there's some emergency maintenance going on,

2807
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:35,320
or the likely not.

2808
02:12:35,320 --> 02:12:38,320
But some information was data mined from the Wii U eShop

2809
02:12:38,320 --> 02:12:41,320
about potential coming out games later,

2810
02:12:41,320 --> 02:12:43,320
like games that are on their way out.

2811
02:12:43,320 --> 02:12:46,320
For example, Contra Advance on the Game Boy Advance

2812
02:12:46,320 --> 02:12:48,320
was spotted for Wii U Virtual Console.

2813
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:51,320
F-Zero Climax on the Game Boy Advance.

2814
02:12:51,320 --> 02:12:53,320
A bunch of Kirby games.

2815
02:12:53,320 --> 02:12:54,320
That should make it.

2816
02:12:54,320 --> 02:12:56,320
Kirby Canvas Curse and Kirby Mass Attack.

2817
02:12:56,320 --> 02:12:58,320
A lot of Zelda games.

2818
02:12:58,320 --> 02:13:01,320
Mega Man additional games.

2819
02:13:01,320 --> 02:13:03,320
Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.

2820
02:13:03,320 --> 02:13:05,320
Pokemon Ranger, Sonic Advance 2 and 3.

2821
02:13:05,320 --> 02:13:07,320
I mean, there's more games than I can really name here.

2822
02:13:07,320 --> 02:13:10,320
But what's also interesting, Wii games on the Wii U.

2823
02:13:10,320 --> 02:13:13,320
Kiki Trick, Kirby's Epic Yarn,

2824
02:13:13,320 --> 02:13:15,320
Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword.

2825
02:13:15,320 --> 02:13:16,320
That would be something to see that.

2826
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:18,320
That was a later game release.

2827
02:13:18,320 --> 02:13:21,320
Metroid Other M, New Super Mario Brothers Wii,

2828
02:13:21,320 --> 02:13:24,320
Super Paper Mario, Wario Land Shake It Up,

2829
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:25,320
Xenoblade Chronicles.

2830
02:13:25,320 --> 02:13:27,320
That could be interesting.

2831
02:13:27,320 --> 02:13:30,320
And then Wii U games, apparently spotted,

2832
02:13:30,320 --> 02:13:35,320
included The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess HD.

2833
02:13:35,320 --> 02:13:37,320
And that made a lot of people go,

2834
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:38,320
huh?

2835
02:13:38,320 --> 02:13:40,320
But apparently, yeah,

2836
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:42,320
The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess HD

2837
02:13:42,320 --> 02:13:45,320
was spotted on the Nintendo Update server.

2838
02:13:45,320 --> 02:13:47,320
And so now a lot of people are going,

2839
02:13:47,320 --> 02:13:50,320
is this something that maybe Nintendo is going to be releasing

2840
02:13:50,320 --> 02:13:53,320
to build up hype for the new Zelda game

2841
02:13:53,320 --> 02:13:54,320
or to hold this over?

2842
02:13:54,320 --> 02:13:56,320
Because they'll probably get delayed again.

2843
02:13:56,320 --> 02:13:57,320
I want it.

2844
02:13:57,320 --> 02:13:58,320
I want it bad.

2845
02:13:58,320 --> 02:14:01,320
And I saw a lot of people saying how upset they were

2846
02:14:01,320 --> 02:14:03,320
that that was a game that would be getting HD

2847
02:14:03,320 --> 02:14:04,320
because they all hate it.

2848
02:14:04,320 --> 02:14:05,320
And I don't understand why.

2849
02:14:05,320 --> 02:14:07,320
I thought it was a really good game.

2850
02:14:07,320 --> 02:14:08,320
I thought Twilight Princess was great.

2851
02:14:08,320 --> 02:14:09,320
It was good enough to name my cat after it.

2852
02:14:09,320 --> 02:14:11,320
Yeah, I thought Twilight Princess was great.

2853
02:14:11,320 --> 02:14:16,320
It's my second favorite 3D Zelda game, probably.

2854
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:17,320
All right.

2855
02:14:17,320 --> 02:14:19,320
Maybe first.

2856
02:14:19,320 --> 02:14:20,320
All right.

2857
02:14:20,320 --> 02:14:21,320
Dark Soccer's got one more story for us

2858
02:14:21,320 --> 02:14:23,320
before we get into tonight's Listless.

2859
02:14:23,320 --> 02:14:26,320
The third annual Day of the Devs is coming back

2860
02:14:26,320 --> 02:14:32,320
on November 7th from 4 to 11th at the Midway in San Francisco.

2861
02:14:32,320 --> 02:14:34,320
So basically it's a celebration of indie games

2862
02:14:34,320 --> 02:14:37,320
and music that's being produced, sorry,

2863
02:14:37,320 --> 02:14:40,320
sponsored by Double Fine and I Am 8-Bit.

2864
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:45,320
And this year is going to have game makers

2865
02:14:45,320 --> 02:14:48,320
showing off directly to their fans

2866
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:54,320
who are interested in going hands-on along live music

2867
02:14:54,320 --> 02:14:58,320
from, is it Doseon or Dose One, I guess?

2868
02:14:58,320 --> 02:15:01,320
I don't know.

2869
02:15:01,320 --> 02:15:03,320
But anyway, they're going to have games,

2870
02:15:03,320 --> 02:15:08,320
some of them, Abzu, Adrift with a one in the middle,

2871
02:15:08,320 --> 02:15:12,320
Bad Blood Below, Botolo, Burly Men at Sea,

2872
02:15:12,320 --> 02:15:15,320
that sounds fun, Day of the Tentacle,

2873
02:15:15,320 --> 02:15:21,320
Death's Gambit, Donut Country, Fantastic Contraption,

2874
02:15:21,320 --> 02:15:25,320
Gang Beasts, Nog with a G, Hyper Light Drifter,

2875
02:15:25,320 --> 02:15:28,320
Night in the Woods, Outer Wilds, Overland, Oxenfree,

2876
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:31,320
Pit People, Rising Thunder, Scale, Secret Legends,

2877
02:15:31,320 --> 02:15:34,320
Sound Self, Spy Party, Spy Party sounds fun,

2878
02:15:34,320 --> 02:15:37,320
Tacoma Thumper, Tilt Brush, Watch Ram,

2879
02:15:37,320 --> 02:15:44,320
What Remains of Edith Finch, Witch Marsh, and many more.

2880
02:15:44,320 --> 02:15:50,320
You can find out about it at dayofthedevs.com.

2881
02:15:50,320 --> 02:15:53,320
Mwahahaha.

2882
02:15:53,320 --> 02:15:56,320
I'm all for these type of events that, you know,

2883
02:15:56,320 --> 02:15:59,320
bring more light on what these hardworking indie folks are doing.

2884
02:15:59,320 --> 02:16:01,320
So why not?

2885
02:16:01,320 --> 02:16:03,320
Alright, let's do this.

2886
02:16:03,320 --> 02:16:05,320
We have not done this in quite some time,

2887
02:16:05,320 --> 02:16:08,320
but we are going to get into a list list.

2888
02:16:11,320 --> 02:16:13,320
Oh, it's been far too long since we've done this,

2889
02:16:13,320 --> 02:16:18,320
so let me explain how this highly scientific process works.

2890
02:16:18,320 --> 02:16:21,320
If you are listening live, unfortunately the podcast folks

2891
02:16:21,320 --> 02:16:23,320
aren't able to participate in this because this is something

2892
02:16:23,320 --> 02:16:25,320
that kind of plays out live.

2893
02:16:25,320 --> 02:16:27,320
But if you want to play along with us,

2894
02:16:27,320 --> 02:16:30,320
you can join our chatroom over at live.vognetworks.com

2895
02:16:30,320 --> 02:16:33,320
As long as you're logged into the VOG Network site

2896
02:16:33,320 --> 02:16:35,320
and you're actually in the chatroom,

2897
02:16:35,320 --> 02:16:39,320
you can actually participate if you're on that live page.

2898
02:16:39,320 --> 02:16:41,320
So we're going to put together a list,

2899
02:16:41,320 --> 02:16:45,320
and it is going to be the definitive list in the scientific process.

2900
02:16:45,320 --> 02:16:47,320
Everybody here in the studio will contribute to the list.

2901
02:16:47,320 --> 02:16:50,320
We're going to name our top three answers

2902
02:16:50,320 --> 02:16:52,320
with your help in the chatroom,

2903
02:16:52,320 --> 02:16:54,320
because sometimes when answers get duplicated and so forth,

2904
02:16:54,320 --> 02:16:57,320
we'll pull answers from the chatroom.

2905
02:16:57,320 --> 02:16:59,320
And then we're going to go around.

2906
02:16:59,320 --> 02:17:02,320
It's a very difficult, but it's a very important part of the process.

2907
02:17:02,320 --> 02:17:07,320
We each go around and eliminate one item that does not deserve to be on the list.

2908
02:17:07,320 --> 02:17:11,320
And then you guys will vote on your number one and your number two answer.

2909
02:17:11,320 --> 02:17:19,320
And again, tonight, what was the worst NES game they ever made?

2910
02:17:19,320 --> 02:17:21,320
So let's get into it.

2911
02:17:21,320 --> 02:17:23,320
I'm going to put that up on the board here.

2912
02:17:23,320 --> 02:17:25,320
I'm having to multitask a little bit here.

2913
02:17:25,320 --> 02:17:28,320
But of course, playing tonight here in the studio, myself, Rob Roberts.

2914
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:32,320
Dark Sakura, Loki, and Flaco Jones, and Shana Linko.

2915
02:17:32,320 --> 02:17:33,320
So we have five players tonight.

2916
02:17:33,320 --> 02:17:35,320
This is a pretty heavy list.

2917
02:17:35,320 --> 02:17:36,320
We don't usually have five.

2918
02:17:36,320 --> 02:17:38,320
We usually have like three or four.

2919
02:17:38,320 --> 02:17:44,320
So what was the worst NES game they ever made?

2920
02:17:44,320 --> 02:17:45,320
All right, let's go to...

2921
02:17:45,320 --> 02:17:48,320
Showgirls.

2922
02:17:48,320 --> 02:17:50,320
Let's go first to...

2923
02:17:50,320 --> 02:17:52,320
I'll say Dark Sakura is going to go first.

2924
02:17:52,320 --> 02:17:53,320
Dark Sakura, ladies first.

2925
02:17:53,320 --> 02:17:54,320
Me? I don't want to.

2926
02:17:54,320 --> 02:17:55,320
Well, too bad.

2927
02:17:55,320 --> 02:17:56,320
Somebody's got to go first.

2928
02:17:56,320 --> 02:17:57,320
I will bite my butt.

2929
02:17:57,320 --> 02:17:59,320
Dark Sakura, what are you going to put on the list?

2930
02:17:59,320 --> 02:18:02,320
X-Men.

2931
02:18:02,320 --> 02:18:03,320
X-Men.

2932
02:18:03,320 --> 02:18:05,320
Why do you think the X-Men game on NES was terrible?

2933
02:18:05,320 --> 02:18:06,320
The X-Men game was shit.

2934
02:18:06,320 --> 02:18:08,320
It had poor collision detection.

2935
02:18:08,320 --> 02:18:11,320
If you were playing a character that wasn't ranged,

2936
02:18:11,320 --> 02:18:14,320
you'd just get overload so badly.

2937
02:18:14,320 --> 02:18:17,320
Plus the whole thing was kind of an overhead view.

2938
02:18:17,320 --> 02:18:19,320
It just really was not good.

2939
02:18:19,320 --> 02:18:20,320
It was the shit.

2940
02:18:20,320 --> 02:18:22,320
The shit as in literal shit.

2941
02:18:22,320 --> 02:18:26,320
Like someone ate it and pooped out a game.

2942
02:18:26,320 --> 02:18:28,320
Someone went to Marvel Comics,

2943
02:18:28,320 --> 02:18:31,320
ate a whole bunch of issues of uncanny X-Men,

2944
02:18:31,320 --> 02:18:35,320
and shat it in a Nintendo cartridge.

2945
02:18:35,320 --> 02:18:38,320
No, tell me how you really feel.

2946
02:18:38,320 --> 02:18:41,320
And I'm keeping my list just sticking with actual licensed stuff

2947
02:18:41,320 --> 02:18:43,320
and not any of the unlicensed stuff.

2948
02:18:43,320 --> 02:18:44,320
Fair enough, fair enough.

2949
02:18:44,320 --> 02:18:46,320
All right, that's not a condition.

2950
02:18:46,320 --> 02:18:48,320
Other people can do whatever they want with the list.

2951
02:18:48,320 --> 02:18:52,320
In fact, we're going to see what Loki is going to put now up on the list.

2952
02:18:52,320 --> 02:18:57,320
I kind of like this game, but it is still pretty bad.

2953
02:18:57,320 --> 02:18:59,320
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

2954
02:18:59,320 --> 02:19:01,320
Yeah, that was kind of bad.

2955
02:19:01,320 --> 02:19:03,320
And because of the water levels.

2956
02:19:03,320 --> 02:19:04,320
You stole one of my answers.

2957
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:05,320
Yes, that was bad.

2958
02:19:05,320 --> 02:19:07,320
I did beat it though.

2959
02:19:07,320 --> 02:19:10,320
That's an interesting sign that so many people here in the studio are like,

2960
02:19:10,320 --> 02:19:13,320
yeah, dammit, I was going to pick that one as well.

2961
02:19:13,320 --> 02:19:15,320
But not to be confused with the arcade game.

2962
02:19:15,320 --> 02:19:17,320
No, no, not the arcade game.

2963
02:19:17,320 --> 02:19:19,320
The ultra games Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,

2964
02:19:19,320 --> 02:19:21,320
the one where you have four Ninja Turtles you get to play as,

2965
02:19:21,320 --> 02:19:23,320
one one dies.

2966
02:19:23,320 --> 02:19:25,320
Well, you're fucked unless you rest.

2967
02:19:25,320 --> 02:19:28,320
I think you can rescue them too or something like that.

2968
02:19:28,320 --> 02:19:30,320
I don't remember how that works.

2969
02:19:30,320 --> 02:19:32,320
It's been a while, so I don't remember.

2970
02:19:32,320 --> 02:19:34,320
Oh, you're starting fights in chat.

2971
02:19:34,320 --> 02:19:37,320
Act Def says TMNT was hard, but it wasn't bad.

2972
02:19:37,320 --> 02:19:39,320
And Alan Alchemy says, wow, rude.

2973
02:19:39,320 --> 02:19:40,320
I beat it a few times.

2974
02:19:40,320 --> 02:19:42,320
It was fucking hard, but I beat it.

2975
02:19:42,320 --> 02:19:45,320
I beat it too, but I'm just saying, you know, it was, you know.

2976
02:19:45,320 --> 02:19:46,320
All right.

2977
02:19:46,320 --> 02:19:49,320
I'm going to go next and I'm going to apologize to Flaco Jones

2978
02:19:49,320 --> 02:19:52,320
because I think it was something he was considering putting on the list.

2979
02:19:52,320 --> 02:19:54,320
But here's the thing.

2980
02:19:54,320 --> 02:19:56,320
I actually bought this.

2981
02:19:56,320 --> 02:19:57,320
Well, I didn't buy it.

2982
02:19:57,320 --> 02:19:58,320
I convinced my mom to buy it.

2983
02:19:58,320 --> 02:20:02,320
And I was so pissed that this game was so fucking terrible.

2984
02:20:02,320 --> 02:20:04,320
It really was one of the worst I ever played.

2985
02:20:04,320 --> 02:20:09,320
And it's such an important series as well for gaming.

2986
02:20:09,320 --> 02:20:14,320
I can't believe they fucked up Super Pitfall so fucking bad.

2987
02:20:14,320 --> 02:20:16,320
Have you played it?

2988
02:20:16,320 --> 02:20:17,320
It's god awful.

2989
02:20:17,320 --> 02:20:21,320
They made Pitfall Harry into like this blue hard hat Hector.

2990
02:20:21,320 --> 02:20:22,320
I don't know.

2991
02:20:22,320 --> 02:20:23,320
I did play it though.

2992
02:20:23,320 --> 02:20:27,320
And it's just like, yeah, it was awful, awful, awful, awful.

2993
02:20:27,320 --> 02:20:31,320
I would rather play Pitfall 2 on the Atari 2600.

2994
02:20:31,320 --> 02:20:32,320
All right.

2995
02:20:32,320 --> 02:20:36,320
Flaco Jones up next with your number three answer.

2996
02:20:36,320 --> 02:20:38,320
I decided not to pick that one and I'm glad I didn't.

2997
02:20:38,320 --> 02:20:39,320
I'm glad you didn't either.

2998
02:20:39,320 --> 02:20:44,320
I have Bible Adventures for the NES, which I don't know if a lot of people might have

2999
02:20:44,320 --> 02:20:47,320
seen that back on, again, Games Done Quick.

3000
02:20:47,320 --> 02:20:51,320
But I remember playing this one because I was a very active member of my youth group

3001
02:20:51,320 --> 02:20:52,320
and all that stuff.

3002
02:20:52,320 --> 02:20:58,320
So this was a game that was made just by a Christian video game company.

3003
02:20:58,320 --> 02:21:00,320
And so there were like a few different ventures.

3004
02:21:00,320 --> 02:21:03,320
It was like you played Noah's Ark, Baby Moses, or David and Goliath.

3005
02:21:03,320 --> 02:21:07,320
I remember the Moses one because you run around with Baby Moses like over your head,

3006
02:21:07,320 --> 02:21:10,320
like the way Mario carries a turnip in Mario 2.

3007
02:21:10,320 --> 02:21:13,320
And I think you could even like throw him, which is ridiculous.

3008
02:21:13,320 --> 02:21:16,320
I saw the pictures of like, what was it, I think Noah.

3009
02:21:16,320 --> 02:21:18,320
He's carrying animals that way too.

3010
02:21:18,320 --> 02:21:20,320
Yeah, and he carries like stacks of animals.

3011
02:21:20,320 --> 02:21:21,320
It's so ridiculous.

3012
02:21:21,320 --> 02:21:24,320
It's like, you know, it's, they want to make games to make the Bible cool for kids,

3013
02:21:24,320 --> 02:21:26,320
but they are not necessarily the best at making games.

3014
02:21:26,320 --> 02:21:28,320
But they've made a lot, I think.

3015
02:21:28,320 --> 02:21:30,320
I remember them talking about this on Games Done Quick.

3016
02:21:30,320 --> 02:21:33,320
They made a lot of games and this was like the NES one.

3017
02:21:33,320 --> 02:21:36,320
So that's why I picked that one because I remember playing that as a kid

3018
02:21:36,320 --> 02:21:39,320
and I'm like, this is weird.

3019
02:21:39,320 --> 02:21:40,320
All right, good.

3020
02:21:40,320 --> 02:21:41,320
I do hear that one come up a lot.

3021
02:21:41,320 --> 02:21:42,320
I sure do.

3022
02:21:42,320 --> 02:21:45,320
I do want to clarify in the chat, AkumaJP was asking,

3023
02:21:45,320 --> 02:21:48,320
is it just Famicom, Super Nintendo, I mean, or all Nintendo consoles?

3024
02:21:48,320 --> 02:21:52,320
Since we are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the NES in America tonight,

3025
02:21:52,320 --> 02:21:54,320
we are keeping it to NES.

3026
02:21:54,320 --> 02:21:57,320
I suppose if somebody wants to put a Famicom game on the list,

3027
02:21:57,320 --> 02:22:00,320
it wouldn't be off limits, but I don't think anyone in here

3028
02:22:00,320 --> 02:22:03,320
has especially fond memories of Famicom games.

3029
02:22:03,320 --> 02:22:07,320
Maybe Jamie with the vault, but I have a feeling those games will avoid her list.

3030
02:22:07,320 --> 02:22:08,320
But we'll see.

3031
02:22:08,320 --> 02:22:13,320
Tigerclaw posted me a link to a game called That Damn Level,

3032
02:22:13,320 --> 02:22:15,320
which is, it's a...

3033
02:22:15,320 --> 02:22:16,320
Oh, Mario Maker thing, right?

3034
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:17,320
No, no.

3035
02:22:17,320 --> 02:22:22,320
It's an independent game based on the level from Ninja Turtles.

3036
02:22:22,320 --> 02:22:26,320
You cruel bastards.

3037
02:22:26,320 --> 02:22:27,320
All right.

3038
02:22:27,320 --> 02:22:29,320
Shane Alinko with your number three answer.

3039
02:22:29,320 --> 02:22:31,320
I just had to come up with this off the top of my head

3040
02:22:31,320 --> 02:22:36,320
because low-key taking Ninja Turtles just threw my list out of whack.

3041
02:22:36,320 --> 02:22:38,320
So I'm going to say Snake, Rattle, and Roll

3042
02:22:38,320 --> 02:22:41,320
because I had fond memories of it when I was a kid,

3043
02:22:41,320 --> 02:22:46,320
but then when I saw you play it on the Rare Replay collection,

3044
02:22:46,320 --> 02:22:50,320
I don't know if I was given drugs as a kid

3045
02:22:50,320 --> 02:22:52,320
or if I was just really dumb.

3046
02:22:52,320 --> 02:22:55,320
But it was such a bad-looking game.

3047
02:22:55,320 --> 02:22:59,320
It's like, oh, I'm this snake that gets longer but attacks jumping feet.

3048
02:22:59,320 --> 02:23:01,320
I think that's Tiara's favorite NES game.

3049
02:23:01,320 --> 02:23:02,320
Is it really?

3050
02:23:02,320 --> 02:23:05,320
It's another one of those games that doesn't make a whole lot of sense

3051
02:23:05,320 --> 02:23:06,320
until you like...

3052
02:23:06,320 --> 02:23:09,320
I don't think it holds up either.

3053
02:23:09,320 --> 02:23:14,320
Maybe if I was like five or six again when it came out the first time,

3054
02:23:14,320 --> 02:23:15,320
I'd still like it.

3055
02:23:15,320 --> 02:23:19,320
But since I'm not, it's pretty awful.

3056
02:23:19,320 --> 02:23:20,320
All right.

3057
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:21,320
Well, this is a pretty interesting list so far.

3058
02:23:21,320 --> 02:23:24,320
So far, the list consists of X-Men, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,

3059
02:23:24,320 --> 02:23:28,320
Super Pitfall, Bible Adventures, and Snake, Rattle, and Roll.

3060
02:23:28,320 --> 02:23:29,320
Let's get to number two answers.

3061
02:23:29,320 --> 02:23:32,320
Dark Sakura, what is the worst NES game they ever made?

3062
02:23:32,320 --> 02:23:36,320
Okay, since we are going off the beaten path,

3063
02:23:36,320 --> 02:23:39,320
I am going to go ahead and name Cheetah Men 2.

3064
02:23:39,320 --> 02:23:41,320
And that's men plural.

3065
02:23:41,320 --> 02:23:43,320
Cheetah Men 2.

3066
02:23:43,320 --> 02:23:45,320
I hope I spelled this right, but does it really matter?

3067
02:23:45,320 --> 02:23:46,320
Let's be honest.

3068
02:23:46,320 --> 02:23:47,320
Cheetah Men 2.

3069
02:23:47,320 --> 02:23:50,320
It's basically some game that hardly anyone's ever heard of.

3070
02:23:50,320 --> 02:23:55,320
It's completely unreleased, and it even actually plays like it's unfinished.

3071
02:23:55,320 --> 02:23:59,320
It's a side-scrolling platformer.

3072
02:23:59,320 --> 02:24:03,320
It's just shit, but it had to be on the list because it's so shitty.

3073
02:24:03,320 --> 02:24:06,320
Actually, if you want to see a really good review of it,

3074
02:24:06,320 --> 02:24:08,320
Angry Video Game Nerd did one.

3075
02:24:08,320 --> 02:24:09,320
All right.

3076
02:24:09,320 --> 02:24:10,320
Yeah.

3077
02:24:10,320 --> 02:24:15,320
Cheetah Men 2 is like the things don't even touch you and you die.

3078
02:24:15,320 --> 02:24:17,320
It's that bad.

3079
02:24:17,320 --> 02:24:18,320
All right.

3080
02:24:18,320 --> 02:24:19,320
Fair enough.

3081
02:24:19,320 --> 02:24:22,320
Let's go to Loki with your number two answer.

3082
02:24:22,320 --> 02:24:26,320
My number two answer is going to be Back to the Future 2 and 3

3083
02:24:26,320 --> 02:24:28,320
because they did both movies into one game.

3084
02:24:28,320 --> 02:24:31,320
And I remember reading about Back to the Future, the first game,

3085
02:24:31,320 --> 02:24:34,320
and I was like, oh, hey, that looks pretty cool.

3086
02:24:34,320 --> 02:24:38,320
And I played this game, and I'm like, wow, this game is really stupid.

3087
02:24:38,320 --> 02:24:42,320
And you have to play all the way through Back to the Future 2

3088
02:24:42,320 --> 02:24:45,320
to get to Back to the Future 3, and then I found a code for it,

3089
02:24:45,320 --> 02:24:48,320
and Back to the Future 3 is still fucking lame.

3090
02:24:48,320 --> 02:24:50,320
So it was just, I don't know.

3091
02:24:50,320 --> 02:24:53,320
Yeah, you think like, oh, it's going to be awesome, like two movies in one.

3092
02:24:53,320 --> 02:24:55,320
It was like some side-scrolling thing,

3093
02:24:55,320 --> 02:24:59,320
and the hoverboard looks stupid, and the whole thing was just garbage.

3094
02:24:59,320 --> 02:25:01,320
And it had nothing to do with the movie.

3095
02:25:01,320 --> 02:25:03,320
Pretty much, yes.

3096
02:25:03,320 --> 02:25:05,320
All right, my number two answer,

3097
02:25:05,320 --> 02:25:07,320
and I feel like I'm going to take somebody's answer

3098
02:25:07,320 --> 02:25:09,320
because this one was really bad,

3099
02:25:09,320 --> 02:25:11,320
and it was one of the launch titles for the NES,

3100
02:25:11,320 --> 02:25:14,320
and this makes it particularly worrisome.

3101
02:25:14,320 --> 02:25:18,320
But you know, in the 80s, they had to show us the good

3102
02:25:18,320 --> 02:25:20,320
that video games could do

3103
02:25:20,320 --> 02:25:23,320
and the edutainment purposes of video games,

3104
02:25:23,320 --> 02:25:26,320
which is why we had such a popular, iconic character

3105
02:25:26,320 --> 02:25:30,320
like Donkey Kong Jr. teaching us math.

3106
02:25:30,320 --> 02:25:35,320
That's right, Donkey Kong Jr. math is my number two answer.

3107
02:25:35,320 --> 02:25:38,320
And if you've never seen it, it was basically like

3108
02:25:38,320 --> 02:25:41,320
they kind of took one of the boards from Donkey Kong Jr.

3109
02:25:41,320 --> 02:25:45,320
and made math equations out of it, and it was number one.

3110
02:25:45,320 --> 02:25:48,320
I only knew about that game because of Animal Crossing.

3111
02:25:48,320 --> 02:25:51,320
That's right, it was one of the games Animal Crossing.

3112
02:25:51,320 --> 02:25:53,320
Yes, I think that's where a lot of us played it

3113
02:25:53,320 --> 02:25:54,320
and got very upset.

3114
02:25:54,320 --> 02:25:56,320
That's the game that's coming to Virtual Console,

3115
02:25:56,320 --> 02:25:57,320
that they have to get the trademark.

3116
02:25:57,320 --> 02:25:59,320
Problem, right?

3117
02:25:59,320 --> 02:26:01,320
Hey, look, you can learn things on your Wii U

3118
02:26:01,320 --> 02:26:02,320
about long division.

3119
02:26:02,320 --> 02:26:04,320
Actually, I think it was all addition subtraction,

3120
02:26:04,320 --> 02:26:07,320
but it was garbage, so there it is.

3121
02:26:07,320 --> 02:26:10,320
Donkey Kong Jr. math is my number two pick.

3122
02:26:10,320 --> 02:26:12,320
Flaco Jones, you're next, your number two pick.

3123
02:26:12,320 --> 02:26:14,320
All right, I keep going back and forth.

3124
02:26:14,320 --> 02:26:16,320
I don't think I'm going to mention the game I mentioned earlier.

3125
02:26:16,320 --> 02:26:17,320
I don't know.

3126
02:26:17,320 --> 02:26:19,320
I'll do a different one.

3127
02:26:19,320 --> 02:26:20,320
Yes, no, maybe I'll save that one.

3128
02:26:20,320 --> 02:26:21,320
I'll save that one for last.

3129
02:26:21,320 --> 02:26:25,320
Okay, so this pick is Top Gun.

3130
02:26:25,320 --> 02:26:27,320
Was anyone able to beat that game?

3131
02:26:27,320 --> 02:26:28,320
Yes.

3132
02:26:28,320 --> 02:26:31,320
How do you land on the aircraft carrier after the first level?

3133
02:26:31,320 --> 02:26:32,320
The first level I can land.

3134
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:34,320
After that, I can't land anymore.

3135
02:26:34,320 --> 02:26:37,320
How do you fucking refuel in that game?

3136
02:26:37,320 --> 02:26:38,320
I can refuel.

3137
02:26:38,320 --> 02:26:39,320
I can get that every once in a while.

3138
02:26:39,320 --> 02:26:42,320
But what sucks is if you fail to refuel,

3139
02:26:42,320 --> 02:26:44,320
you still got to fly around until you die.

3140
02:26:44,320 --> 02:26:47,320
Well, you're not going to make it, but just fly around for a while.

3141
02:26:47,320 --> 02:26:49,320
You had the sex in that game.

3142
02:26:49,320 --> 02:26:51,320
You had the sex with the refuel.

3143
02:26:51,320 --> 02:26:52,320
What was the same as the aircraft thing?

3144
02:26:52,320 --> 02:26:53,320
It was the same as landing.

3145
02:26:53,320 --> 02:26:57,320
You had to be like, left, left, left, right, right, right, up, down, pull up, up.

3146
02:26:57,320 --> 02:26:59,320
And it's like, nope, too late, couldn't do it.

3147
02:26:59,320 --> 02:27:00,320
The plane flies away.

3148
02:27:00,320 --> 02:27:02,320
I'm like, oh, good, I'm going to die, but I still got to play.

3149
02:27:02,320 --> 02:27:05,320
Darsakra, you said you can actually do it?

3150
02:27:05,320 --> 02:27:06,320
You could beat that game.

3151
02:27:06,320 --> 02:27:08,320
It's been ages, but yeah, I beat it when I was 11.

3152
02:27:08,320 --> 02:27:12,320
I swear, I get so close on level two to land on the aircraft carrier.

3153
02:27:12,320 --> 02:27:15,320
And it says, pull up.

3154
02:27:16,320 --> 02:27:22,320
I watched one of those videos that have the play throughs on them

3155
02:27:22,320 --> 02:27:24,320
that you would buy on VHS.

3156
02:27:24,320 --> 02:27:29,320
And it had the tips on how to hook up to the aircraft carrier

3157
02:27:29,320 --> 02:27:31,320
and how to refuel and everything.

3158
02:27:31,320 --> 02:27:34,320
And once I wrote down the numbers that you had to have

3159
02:27:34,320 --> 02:27:38,320
to get the nose up just right and the wings just right,

3160
02:27:38,320 --> 02:27:40,320
then I aced it every time.

3161
02:27:40,320 --> 02:27:41,320
I can see you having the numbers help.

3162
02:27:41,320 --> 02:27:42,320
I guess it never went that far.

3163
02:27:42,320 --> 02:27:43,320
I just got so mad.

3164
02:27:43,320 --> 02:27:44,320
I was like, screw this game forever.

3165
02:27:44,320 --> 02:27:47,320
Once you had the numbers, then it was like, oh, okay.

3166
02:27:47,320 --> 02:27:49,320
Let's do the research for Zelda.

3167
02:27:49,320 --> 02:27:51,320
I can't do that on the Top Gun. I got so angry.

3168
02:27:51,320 --> 02:27:54,320
Even though I honestly didn't have too much of a fun time with it,

3169
02:27:54,320 --> 02:27:55,320
I just beat it to prove I could.

3170
02:27:55,320 --> 02:27:56,320
All right.

3171
02:27:56,320 --> 02:27:58,320
Darsakra, we need to see how much you can remember.

3172
02:27:58,320 --> 02:28:01,320
You have some pretty lofty gaming accomplishments here.

3173
02:28:01,320 --> 02:28:03,320
I'm like, I would like to see you do Mega Man blindfolded.

3174
02:28:03,320 --> 02:28:04,320
That would be a lot of fun.

3175
02:28:04,320 --> 02:28:06,320
I don't think I could do that anymore.

3176
02:28:06,320 --> 02:28:08,320
I mean, shoot, do you want to know how many times?

3177
02:28:08,320 --> 02:28:10,320
You'd be surprised what comes back with muscle memory.

3178
02:28:10,320 --> 02:28:11,320
Oh my God.

3179
02:28:11,320 --> 02:28:13,320
But do you want to know how many times it took me to do that

3180
02:28:13,320 --> 02:28:14,320
the first time?

3181
02:28:14,320 --> 02:28:15,320
That's true.

3182
02:28:15,320 --> 02:28:17,320
Is I actually had to play through that level

3183
02:28:17,320 --> 02:28:19,320
something like 10 times.

3184
02:28:19,320 --> 02:28:22,320
They blindfolded me and I did it again.

3185
02:28:22,320 --> 02:28:24,320
When I played the Mega Man collection on that,

3186
02:28:24,320 --> 02:28:26,320
because that just came out a long ago.

3187
02:28:26,320 --> 02:28:27,320
Timing on that one's bad, by the way.

3188
02:28:27,320 --> 02:28:28,320
Is it?

3189
02:28:28,320 --> 02:28:29,320
It is. The timing's off.

3190
02:28:29,320 --> 02:28:30,320
Okay, because it took me a couple tries,

3191
02:28:30,320 --> 02:28:32,320
but then I was finally able to do the Quick Man thing.

3192
02:28:32,320 --> 02:28:35,320
But I was surprised how much would just be muscle memory.

3193
02:28:35,320 --> 02:28:37,320
I knew things to fall down.

3194
02:28:37,320 --> 02:28:38,320
We compared it.

3195
02:28:38,320 --> 02:28:41,320
We took the actual cartridge versus the collection.

3196
02:28:41,320 --> 02:28:43,320
And yeah, timing is off in Quick Man's stage.

3197
02:28:43,320 --> 02:28:44,320
Interesting.

3198
02:28:44,320 --> 02:28:46,320
All right, s2100matt says,

3199
02:28:46,320 --> 02:28:49,320
Clearly Flaco wants Konami to apologize for Top Gun.

3200
02:28:49,320 --> 02:28:50,320
Possibly.

3201
02:28:50,320 --> 02:28:52,320
s2100matt says, I still have muscle memory

3202
02:28:52,320 --> 02:28:54,320
for some classic DDR step charts,

3203
02:28:54,320 --> 02:28:56,320
even after not playing DDR for years.

3204
02:28:56,320 --> 02:28:58,320
Oh yeah, every time I hear like Orion 7-8,

3205
02:28:58,320 --> 02:28:59,320
I hear it just in my mind,

3206
02:28:59,320 --> 02:29:02,320
duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

3207
02:29:02,320 --> 02:29:03,320
You just hear the step patterns in your mind.

3208
02:29:03,320 --> 02:29:05,320
Anyway, nerd, nerd, nerd.

3209
02:29:05,320 --> 02:29:06,320
All right, speaking of nerd,

3210
02:29:06,320 --> 02:29:10,320
Shane, what is your number two worst NES game ever?

3211
02:29:10,320 --> 02:29:13,320
So I'm going to explain why it is before I say what it is.

3212
02:29:13,320 --> 02:29:14,320
Okay.

3213
02:29:14,320 --> 02:29:18,320
So this game is terrible

3214
02:29:18,320 --> 02:29:21,320
because it's way too difficult for what it should be.

3215
02:29:21,320 --> 02:29:25,320
And for the license it is, it also should not be difficult.

3216
02:29:25,320 --> 02:29:27,320
And it also scared me as a kid.

3217
02:29:27,320 --> 02:29:30,320
So my number two game is Mickey Mousecapades.

3218
02:29:30,320 --> 02:29:35,320
Didn't somebody say that was their favorite game earlier?

3219
02:29:35,320 --> 02:29:37,320
Oh no, that's fighting words.

3220
02:29:37,320 --> 02:29:39,320
So what was it about Mickey Mousecapades

3221
02:29:39,320 --> 02:29:41,320
you just, it was too frustrating.

3222
02:29:41,320 --> 02:29:42,320
It was scary and frightening.

3223
02:29:42,320 --> 02:29:43,320
Why was it scary?

3224
02:29:43,320 --> 02:29:45,320
I don't know, a lot of games scared me when I was a kid.

3225
02:29:45,320 --> 02:29:48,320
My number one game also scared me as a kid.

3226
02:29:48,320 --> 02:29:50,320
I think you get scared easy.

3227
02:29:50,320 --> 02:29:54,320
It was, and I love Silent Hill and stuff like that.

3228
02:29:54,320 --> 02:29:56,320
That's not nearly as scary as Cat in the Hat

3229
02:29:56,320 --> 02:29:59,320
and picks up the mix-up,

3230
02:29:59,320 --> 02:30:03,320
which is a scarring game for me.

3231
02:30:03,320 --> 02:30:05,320
Didn't I find footage on YouTube of that and you started crying?

3232
02:30:05,320 --> 02:30:06,320
I did not like it.

3233
02:30:06,320 --> 02:30:08,320
I did not like it.

3234
02:30:08,320 --> 02:30:11,320
But yeah, it wasn't very fun.

3235
02:30:11,320 --> 02:30:13,320
It's a Mickey game.

3236
02:30:13,320 --> 02:30:15,320
It should be not super difficult.

3237
02:30:15,320 --> 02:30:17,320
But as a kid that game was just so hard.

3238
02:30:17,320 --> 02:30:19,320
And why are they throwing stars?

3239
02:30:19,320 --> 02:30:21,320
When did Mickey and Minnie start throwing stars?

3240
02:30:21,320 --> 02:30:23,320
When they became ninjas.

3241
02:30:23,320 --> 02:30:24,320
But they weren't ninjas.

3242
02:30:24,320 --> 02:30:26,320
And Minnie was so frustrating.

3243
02:30:26,320 --> 02:30:31,320
Alright, anyhow, folks in chat predicting that will be an early elimination in the next round.

3244
02:30:31,320 --> 02:30:33,320
But we can't, we're not there yet.

3245
02:30:33,320 --> 02:30:36,320
So far the list contains X-Men, Cheetahmen 2, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,

3246
02:30:36,320 --> 02:30:37,320
Back to the Future 2 and 3,

3247
02:30:37,320 --> 02:30:42,320
Super Pitfall, Donkey Kong Jr. Math, Bible Adventures, Top Gun, Snake Rattle and Roll, Mickey Mousecapades.

3248
02:30:42,320 --> 02:30:45,320
We've got room for five more for now, so let's get to it.

3249
02:30:45,320 --> 02:30:49,320
Dark Sakura, the worst NES game they ever made.

3250
02:30:49,320 --> 02:30:50,320
Don't hate me, please.

3251
02:30:50,320 --> 02:30:52,320
I'm gonna, but what is it?

3252
02:30:52,320 --> 02:30:53,320
Castlevania 2, Simon's Quest.

3253
02:30:53,320 --> 02:30:56,320
Oh, fuck! You're going for the jugular!

3254
02:30:56,320 --> 02:30:59,320
Damn! No way! No way!

3255
02:30:59,320 --> 02:31:01,320
What? Okay, but why?

3256
02:31:01,320 --> 02:31:06,320
Because it broke the mold of Castlevania games and not in a good way.

3257
02:31:06,320 --> 02:31:15,320
It was like trying to play a Castlevania RPG that didn't want to be an RPG and didn't want to be a Castlevania game.

3258
02:31:15,320 --> 02:31:17,320
It really was just...

3259
02:31:17,320 --> 02:31:21,320
I feel like that's what led us to Symphony of the Night.

3260
02:31:21,320 --> 02:31:25,320
No, I think Metroid led its way to Symphony of the Night.

3261
02:31:25,320 --> 02:31:30,320
This one, you're walking around outside and you're talking to villagers and shit.

3262
02:31:30,320 --> 02:31:34,320
And even if it did, it took the few good qualities from it.

3263
02:31:34,320 --> 02:31:37,320
It was hard as fuck, first of all.

3264
02:31:37,320 --> 02:31:44,320
And then the only good thing about it was what a terrible night to have a curse.

3265
02:31:44,320 --> 02:31:46,320
The music, though.

3266
02:31:46,320 --> 02:31:47,320
The music was great.

3267
02:31:47,320 --> 02:31:50,320
I mean, I'm just saying going strictly gameplay...

3268
02:31:50,320 --> 02:31:51,320
It's alright.

3269
02:31:51,320 --> 02:31:54,320
I have a feeling this is the round where we're all gonna kick each other in the balls.

3270
02:31:54,320 --> 02:31:56,320
So, you know, metaphorically.

3271
02:31:56,320 --> 02:31:58,320
Well, I mean, it just don't...

3272
02:31:58,320 --> 02:32:03,320
It was a big disappointment to me because Castlevania was fantastic.

3273
02:32:03,320 --> 02:32:06,320
Castlevania 3 was fantastic.

3274
02:32:06,320 --> 02:32:11,320
Every Castlevania game, even Dracula X on the Super Nintendo,

3275
02:32:11,320 --> 02:32:17,320
which was no way as good as the PC Engine version, was better than this.

3276
02:32:17,320 --> 02:32:21,320
You are entitled to your opinion even when you are extremely wrong.

3277
02:32:24,320 --> 02:32:25,320
Hearts.

3278
02:32:25,320 --> 02:32:26,320
Girl.

3279
02:32:26,320 --> 02:32:27,320
Alright, anyway.

3280
02:32:27,320 --> 02:32:30,320
My number one will not be popular either, but we'll see.

3281
02:32:30,320 --> 02:32:32,320
Loki, here it is, your number one answer.

3282
02:32:32,320 --> 02:32:34,320
The worst NES game they ever made.

3283
02:32:34,320 --> 02:32:38,320
Okay, so, like, all these games have been mentioned have been games I actually played,

3284
02:32:38,320 --> 02:32:43,320
and I actually played this too because we rented a ton of fucking games back in the NES days.

3285
02:32:43,320 --> 02:32:46,320
And this game was so fucking weird.

3286
02:32:46,320 --> 02:32:49,320
And I guess it makes sense because what the hell are you gonna do in a type of game like this

3287
02:32:49,320 --> 02:32:54,320
that's based off this license, but the worst game I probably played was Barbie.

3288
02:32:54,320 --> 02:32:56,320
The Barbie game.

3289
02:32:56,320 --> 02:32:58,320
And it was fucking weird.

3290
02:32:58,320 --> 02:33:03,320
Just like shoes and shit bouncing up and down, like purses, and like, I don't know.

3291
02:33:03,320 --> 02:33:07,320
It was a weird fucking hard game for girls, I guess, to play.

3292
02:33:07,320 --> 02:33:10,320
And it's just, I don't know, it's silly.

3293
02:33:10,320 --> 02:33:12,320
Alright, there it is.

3294
02:33:12,320 --> 02:33:15,320
Barbie is the worst video game they ever made.

3295
02:33:15,320 --> 02:33:18,320
It is kind of shit though, I have to be honest.

3296
02:33:18,320 --> 02:33:20,320
I mean, it had some impossible jumps and so forth.

3297
02:33:20,320 --> 02:33:22,320
Alright, we'll see.

3298
02:33:22,320 --> 02:33:27,320
Alright, my number one pick for the worst NES game they ever did make.

3299
02:33:27,320 --> 02:33:29,320
You ready? Because not everybody's gonna agree with me.

3300
02:33:29,320 --> 02:33:32,320
But I think this game is super fucking overrated,

3301
02:33:32,320 --> 02:33:35,320
and it's one of those games when you sit there and you play it again, you're like,

3302
02:33:35,320 --> 02:33:37,320
this game is trash.

3303
02:33:37,320 --> 02:33:42,320
And what's also huge about this game is that it's the game that everybody remembers

3304
02:33:42,320 --> 02:33:45,320
around a particular peripheral they made for the NES,

3305
02:33:45,320 --> 02:33:49,320
even though there were way better games that used the same peripheral,

3306
02:33:49,320 --> 02:33:54,320
which is why Duck Hunt is the worst video game on the NES.

3307
02:33:55,320 --> 02:33:58,320
Duck Hunt is the worst. No, come on!

3308
02:33:58,320 --> 02:34:01,320
Who actually sat there and played the game the way it meant to be played?

3309
02:34:01,320 --> 02:34:03,320
It was just everybody sitting in front of the TV,

3310
02:34:03,320 --> 02:34:06,320
you couldn't kill the dog who was a total twat,

3311
02:34:06,320 --> 02:34:08,320
everybody wanted to kill the damn dog and you couldn't.

3312
02:34:08,320 --> 02:34:11,320
No, I played it the right way. I didn't just go up to the TV and hold my gun there.

3313
02:34:11,320 --> 02:34:13,320
I'm just saying...

3314
02:34:13,320 --> 02:34:15,320
I would play the clay pigeon a lot.

3315
02:34:15,320 --> 02:34:17,320
Yeah, clay pigeon game was fun too.

3316
02:34:17,320 --> 02:34:19,320
I'm just saying Hogan's Alley was a better light gun game.

3317
02:34:19,320 --> 02:34:21,320
I do love Hogan's Alley, but Duck Hunt's awesome.

3318
02:34:21,320 --> 02:34:23,320
No it's not.

3319
02:34:24,320 --> 02:34:26,320
Overrated. Overrated.

3320
02:34:26,320 --> 02:34:29,320
I was only happy when the dog was announced for Smash Brothers

3321
02:34:29,320 --> 02:34:31,320
so I could kick its ass.

3322
02:34:31,320 --> 02:34:33,320
That was really all it was.

3323
02:34:33,320 --> 02:34:36,320
Some folks in chat getting really mad at me for that answer.

3324
02:34:36,320 --> 02:34:38,320
Well, all I have to say is...

3325
02:34:40,320 --> 02:34:43,320
No one actually disagreed with me over Castlevania, by the way.

3326
02:34:44,320 --> 02:34:47,320
They know better than to disagree with you.

3327
02:34:47,320 --> 02:34:50,320
I love Castlevania 2. It's like one of my favorite Castlevania games.

3328
02:34:50,320 --> 02:34:53,320
I know. I think all four of us will be eliminating Castlevania.

3329
02:34:53,320 --> 02:34:55,320
That's what happens. That's what happens.

3330
02:34:55,320 --> 02:34:57,320
We'll see. We'll see.

3331
02:34:57,320 --> 02:35:00,320
Moving on though. Flaco Jones, your number one answer.

3332
02:35:00,320 --> 02:35:02,320
I keep going back and forth.

3333
02:35:02,320 --> 02:35:05,320
I was going to pick Ten Yard Fight, but it's a sports game, so who cares?

3334
02:35:05,320 --> 02:35:08,320
So I'm going to pick the game I talked about at the beginning with Shane, which is Trojan.

3335
02:35:08,320 --> 02:35:10,320
Which Shane likes, I guess.

3336
02:35:10,320 --> 02:35:13,320
I don't know why I'm picking a game to argue with Shane about.

3337
02:35:13,320 --> 02:35:17,320
I just remember everybody associating it with condoms.

3338
02:35:17,320 --> 02:35:19,320
That's all I remember.

3339
02:35:19,320 --> 02:35:21,320
Just because it's called Trojan?

3340
02:35:21,320 --> 02:35:25,320
Yeah, Trojan's always been... I don't know. Whatever.

3341
02:35:25,320 --> 02:35:27,320
I don't know what to do.

3342
02:35:27,320 --> 02:35:31,320
It's another game that I just kind of got as a hand-me-down, because I did most of my games.

3343
02:35:31,320 --> 02:35:33,320
So I just played it, and I was like,

3344
02:35:33,320 --> 02:35:37,320
this game is so weird. You've got to kneel down and swing your sword a bunch of times to kill things.

3345
02:35:37,320 --> 02:35:42,320
I did kind of like the mode where you get to fight your friend, but even that was just so weird.

3346
02:35:42,320 --> 02:35:45,320
You got to jump using the up button. They didn't have a dedicated jump button.

3347
02:35:45,320 --> 02:35:48,320
It's always so bothersome in a game like that.

3348
02:35:48,320 --> 02:35:50,320
But there's some cool power-ups you get.

3349
02:35:50,320 --> 02:35:52,320
But I just couldn't get very far in it.

3350
02:35:52,320 --> 02:35:54,320
The graphics look kind of lame.

3351
02:35:54,320 --> 02:35:56,320
It's a Capcom game, right?

3352
02:35:56,320 --> 02:36:00,320
Yeah, so it's like when you've got Mega Man and Bionic Commando, and then you have this.

3353
02:36:00,320 --> 02:36:05,320
Sometimes they make that one choice in the game that just ruins the whole fucking thing.

3354
02:36:05,320 --> 02:36:10,320
I was really going to go for Blood and put Rygar on my list, because he didn't have a fucking save chip.

3355
02:36:10,320 --> 02:36:13,320
How can you beat Rygar? You can't.

3356
02:36:13,320 --> 02:36:14,320
Dan can.

3357
02:36:14,320 --> 02:36:16,320
Well, Dan's insane.

3358
02:36:16,320 --> 02:36:18,320
I don't think you can save on Trojan, either.

3359
02:36:18,320 --> 02:36:21,320
No, you have to play straight through Trojan, too. I just couldn't do it.

3360
02:36:21,320 --> 02:36:28,320
Alright. Anyway, here we go. One more space on the list here, and it's going to belong to Shane Alinko.

3361
02:36:28,320 --> 02:36:30,320
Shane, what is the worst NES game they ever made?

3362
02:36:30,320 --> 02:36:36,320
Okay, again, this game's there because terrible choice for what they're doing with the license.

3363
02:36:36,320 --> 02:36:41,320
It was really hard, and it scared me even more than Mickey Mouse paid.

3364
02:36:41,320 --> 02:36:45,320
My number one choice is Bart vs. the Space Mutants.

3365
02:36:47,320 --> 02:36:48,320
Such a bad game.

3366
02:36:48,320 --> 02:36:50,320
I actually don't remember Bart vs. the Space Mutants.

3367
02:36:50,320 --> 02:36:51,320
It's not good.

3368
02:36:51,320 --> 02:36:52,320
What happened in that one?

3369
02:36:52,320 --> 02:36:57,320
Aliens were trying to take over, and in the first stage, you had to color things not purple,

3370
02:36:57,320 --> 02:36:59,320
because they're a machine to take over the world.

3371
02:36:59,320 --> 02:37:03,320
They had to have purple things, so you would spray paint over that with red.

3372
02:37:03,320 --> 02:37:07,320
And then the second stage is, you've got to collect hats, because their new machine requires hats.

3373
02:37:07,320 --> 02:37:08,320
Wow.

3374
02:37:08,320 --> 02:37:10,320
Yeah, it was really bad.

3375
02:37:10,320 --> 02:37:15,320
I remember Bart and the Nightmare, the Bart dream nightmare, but that was Super Nintendo.

3376
02:37:15,320 --> 02:37:17,320
That wasn't quite as bad.

3377
02:37:17,320 --> 02:37:19,320
But it was kind of crap.

3378
02:37:19,320 --> 02:37:21,320
All right, wow, there it is.

3379
02:37:21,320 --> 02:37:25,320
I'm going to read through this list, but I want to acknowledge some of our chat room comments here.

3380
02:37:25,320 --> 02:37:28,320
I was trying to see what they were saying back towards the beginning.

3381
02:37:28,320 --> 02:37:29,320
Did we get some people yelling answers?

3382
02:37:29,320 --> 02:37:33,320
Silver Surfer was shouted out in the chat room there.

3383
02:37:33,320 --> 02:37:35,320
The Adventures of the Link.

3384
02:37:35,320 --> 02:37:37,320
Non-silon-occupied Caprica.

3385
02:37:37,320 --> 02:37:39,320
I don't think that was actually a game, though.

3386
02:37:39,320 --> 02:37:42,320
Not that kind of list list tonight.

3387
02:37:43,320 --> 02:37:45,320
Even Flaco was like, wait a minute, you're doing a list list?

3388
02:37:45,320 --> 02:37:47,320
You don't have silly answers?

3389
02:37:47,320 --> 02:37:51,320
I was like, well, you know people are going to go for blood by putting a game that's considered good on the list.

3390
02:37:51,320 --> 02:37:54,320
I honestly can't remember a serious answer list list.

3391
02:37:54,320 --> 02:37:56,320
I don't know why.

3392
02:37:56,320 --> 02:38:00,320
It must have happened. I've only been listening for eight years.

3393
02:38:00,320 --> 02:38:02,320
Maybe before that, Flaco.

3394
02:38:02,320 --> 02:38:04,320
Anyway, be thinking about this, guys.

3395
02:38:04,320 --> 02:38:08,320
Here it is. Here's the list as it stands now, but we have one more very important round.

3396
02:38:08,320 --> 02:38:10,320
So far, here is the list.

3397
02:38:10,320 --> 02:38:25,320
X-Men, Cheetahmen 2, Castlevania II, Simon's Quest, Bible Adventures, Top Gun, Trojan, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Back to the Future 2 and 3, Barbie, Snake, Rattle and Roll, Mickey Mouse Capades, Bart vs. the Space Mutants, Super Pitfall, Donkey Kong Jr. Math, and Duck Hunt.

3398
02:38:25,320 --> 02:38:30,320
Let's just, you know, I realize there's a few controversial choices on here, but I think we did a pretty good job.

3399
02:38:30,320 --> 02:38:33,320
I think this is a pretty good list that we got so far.

3400
02:38:33,320 --> 02:38:39,320
But here we go. Here is that round. You gotta do it. It's part of the process.

3401
02:38:39,320 --> 02:38:41,320
Now it's time for the elimination round.

3402
02:38:41,320 --> 02:38:43,320
Dark Sakura, ladies first.

3403
02:38:43,320 --> 02:38:46,320
Which of these is not worthy of the list?

3404
02:38:49,320 --> 02:38:54,320
I am going to take off...

3405
02:38:57,320 --> 02:38:59,320
For Tiara, I'll take off Snake, Rattle and Roll.

3406
02:38:59,320 --> 02:39:03,320
For Tiara, she's taken off Snake, Rattle and Roll.

3407
02:39:03,320 --> 02:39:04,320
They're all pretty bad.

3408
02:39:04,320 --> 02:39:07,320
It has been stricken from the list. It wasn't that bad, Shane.

3409
02:39:07,320 --> 02:39:11,320
It wasn't that bad. At least that wasn't one of the ones that scared you.

3410
02:39:11,320 --> 02:39:22,320
Alright. Do remember though, in a revision to the listless rules we made a couple years ago, if a host loses two of their answers, the other will get immunity and cannot be removed.

3411
02:39:22,320 --> 02:39:26,320
So if one of Shane's other answers disappears, the third will get immunity.

3412
02:39:26,320 --> 02:39:31,320
Let's see what happens though. Up next is Loki. Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?

3413
02:39:31,320 --> 02:39:32,320
I'd say Simon's Quest.

3414
02:39:32,320 --> 02:39:36,320
Simon's Quest. I think Dark Sakura knew she was losing that one.

3415
02:39:36,320 --> 02:39:37,320
I'm just keeping it real.

3416
02:39:37,320 --> 02:39:41,320
I'm just keeping it real. Alright, there it is. It has been stricken from the list.

3417
02:39:41,320 --> 02:39:43,320
Castlevania II, Simon's Quest has been removed.

3418
02:39:43,320 --> 02:39:45,320
Ooh, that means it's my turn.

3419
02:39:46,320 --> 02:39:49,320
Which one am I going to remove from this?

3420
02:39:49,320 --> 02:40:03,320
I'm really tempted to take one of Shane's off, but I think I'm going to go for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because Alan got really offended, so I feel like if I don't remove that...

3421
02:40:03,320 --> 02:40:06,320
I kind of like how Dark Sakura did hers for Tiara. I'm doing this one for Alan.

3422
02:40:06,320 --> 02:40:11,320
So I'm taking Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles off the list. It has been removed from the list.

3423
02:40:11,320 --> 02:40:16,320
Flaco Jones, three down, two to go. Flaco, which of these is not worthy of the list?

3424
02:40:16,320 --> 02:40:17,320
Goodbye, Duck Hunt.

3425
02:40:17,320 --> 02:40:18,320
Duck Hunt.

3426
02:40:18,320 --> 02:40:19,320
Duck Hunt!

3427
02:40:19,320 --> 02:40:20,320
Yeah!

3428
02:40:20,320 --> 02:40:21,320
I knew I was going to lose that one.

3429
02:40:21,320 --> 02:40:22,320
I'm so glad it was still there.

3430
02:40:22,320 --> 02:40:27,320
Alright, Duck Hunt has been removed from the list wrongfully by Flaco Jones.

3431
02:40:27,320 --> 02:40:31,320
Alright, Shane, I just want to point out Flaco's list is still intact, but...

3432
02:40:31,320 --> 02:40:32,320
I'm taking off Trojan.

3433
02:40:32,320 --> 02:40:33,320
I knew it!

3434
02:40:33,320 --> 02:40:34,320
Trojan!

3435
02:40:34,320 --> 02:40:35,320
I knew it!

3436
02:40:37,320 --> 02:40:40,320
It's like, it's pretty easy. It's softball.

3437
02:40:40,320 --> 02:40:42,320
Why did you choose? Are you a big fan of Trojan?

3438
02:40:42,320 --> 02:40:45,320
Yes, I loved Trojan when I was a kid. That was a fun game.

3439
02:40:45,320 --> 02:40:46,320
Why?

3440
02:40:46,320 --> 02:40:47,320
I wouldn't like it now.

3441
02:40:47,320 --> 02:40:48,320
Alright.

3442
02:40:48,320 --> 02:40:51,320
But I was like five, so lots of things were fun at five.

3443
02:40:51,320 --> 02:40:57,320
This is, this is, everybody lost one answer. That's pretty good for five people. Everybody lost one.

3444
02:40:57,320 --> 02:41:00,320
I know, I expected some people to go down to just one answer.

3445
02:41:00,320 --> 02:41:02,320
I thought I was going to take Mickey Mouse campaigns off.

3446
02:41:02,320 --> 02:41:04,320
Why? It was terrible.

3447
02:41:04,320 --> 02:41:08,320
Because then I would have to hear it from Alan. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is not that bad.

3448
02:41:08,320 --> 02:41:14,320
Well, there's no way anyone's going to defend Back to the Future 2 and 3 or Barbie the game, because they're both fucking terrible.

3449
02:41:14,320 --> 02:41:25,320

And we will get to the top answers in just a little bit, probably after the mailbag.

3455
02:42:06,320 --> 02:42:09,320
But for now, oh, it's actually time for the mailbag. Let's get to it.

3456
02:42:09,320 --> 02:42:16,320
Dark Soccer's going to dive into our mailbag. Participate at orangelaungeradio.com, where I think we actually got quite a few emails tonight. I'm excited.

3457
02:42:16,320 --> 02:42:18,320
And they're all sticky.

3458
02:42:18,320 --> 02:42:20,320
I'm excited for one of them that I heard about.

3459
02:42:20,320 --> 02:42:22,320
Oh boy, alright, let's get to it.

3460
02:42:22,320 --> 02:42:28,320
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com if you want to send us an email. We have three of them tonight, so let's get to it, Dark Soccer.

3461
02:42:28,320 --> 02:42:33,320
This is titled Power Portals with a Z. Thank you, Canada.

3462
02:42:34,320 --> 02:42:43,320
I'm planning on getting my dad into Ingress on his 5C, even though it's only a 16GB model. So is mine, don't worry about it. Mine's a 5S, though.

3463
02:42:43,320 --> 02:42:54,320
As for me, can you recommend the game on devices dependent on WiFi? No, it just says recommend the game on devices dependent on WiFi.

3464
02:42:54,320 --> 02:43:01,320
I really can't, just to be fair. Which, by the way, I don't know when this turned into the Ingress podcast. I'm not sure how I feel about that.

3465
02:43:01,320 --> 02:43:10,320
But I would say no. WiFi, you have to be able to go out to places of interest. In fact, if you're on a really strict data plan, don't do it either.

3466
02:43:10,320 --> 02:43:17,320
You have to be able to have enough data. It eats up a lot of data. It does eat up a lot of data, so just be mindful.

3467
02:43:17,320 --> 02:43:31,320
While it's obviously not his demographic, has Shane seen the Fisher-Price MMPR Imaginext line, including the 2-foot tall Megazord playset?

3468
02:43:31,320 --> 02:43:42,320
Yes, clearly he has. Interesting. Also weird that the current Monster slash Halloween-themed LEGO minifigure series blind bags are perpetually sold out.

3469
02:43:42,320 --> 02:43:50,320
Finally, while it's not exactly cave quality, have any of you checked out Shootie Skies? Fairly serious megalomania vibe there.

3470
02:43:50,320 --> 02:43:54,320
And that comes from Robert M. No, I have not.

3471
02:43:54,320 --> 02:43:58,320
Yeah, I can't say I've played that one either.

3472
02:43:58,320 --> 02:44:00,320
So the answer is no.

3473
02:44:00,320 --> 02:44:04,320
Alright, moving forward. Kind of long email.

3474
02:44:04,320 --> 02:44:10,320
Gotta say I'm with you on Rock Band 4, Rob. I was expecting and hoping for a lot more from Rock Band 4.

3475
02:44:10,320 --> 02:44:17,320
Not only removing keys and skimming on character creation, like you mentioned, but also taking out Pro Guitar and even online.

3476
02:44:17,320 --> 02:44:24,320
I can see their reasoning. Their data and polls suggested that most of the features they removed were the less used ones.

3477
02:44:24,320 --> 02:44:28,320
It's still kind of disappointing to compare Rock Band 3 and Rock Band 4.

3478
02:44:28,320 --> 02:44:36,320
I'm still enjoying the game as the basic gameplay is still great, but I keep thinking, maybe I should just toss in Rock Band 3 instead.

3479
02:44:36,320 --> 02:44:42,320
I was just going to say, just quickly, there was not enough additions to make up for the subtractions.

3480
02:44:42,320 --> 02:44:49,320
And that's the problem. So big fucking deal, they added this solo thing that's kind of, I don't really care for the solo thing at all, actually, the way they did it.

3481
02:44:49,320 --> 02:44:58,320
I preferred it the old way. I did play a little more Rock Band 4 this week, and to be fair on some of my criticisms last week,

3482
02:44:58,320 --> 02:45:05,320
I did find that this time, if I was able to go into DLC that I knew I'd bought, even if it said $1.99, I was able to download it for free.

3483
02:45:05,320 --> 02:45:08,320
So I got the rest of my No Doubt album and some of the other things I knew I had.

3484
02:45:08,320 --> 02:45:14,320
But it's still, I can't say it's a better game than Rock Band 3.

3485
02:45:14,320 --> 02:45:19,320
So again, if you need the Rock Band experience on a current console, okay, great. I mean, Rock Band is still a good game.

3486
02:45:19,320 --> 02:45:26,320
I would have still recommended Rock Band 1 and 2, but it's just, it's a little disappointing. I was expecting a little more. That's all.

3487
02:45:26,320 --> 02:45:34,320
As for the DLC issue, I was having similar issues on PS4. Some song packs not showing up properly or not downloading or whatever.

3488
02:45:34,320 --> 02:45:39,320
At the very least, they've been working pretty hard on fixing that stuff.

3489
02:45:39,320 --> 02:45:44,320
Just in the week that the game's been out, I've had several songs go from not working to working.

3490
02:45:44,320 --> 02:45:51,320
Sucks to have to keep checking back given the volume of songs to scroll through, but that's also probably what's taking them so long.

3491
02:45:51,320 --> 02:46:00,320
There's a thread on their forum where you can communicate any DLC issues you have, and I suggest going in there if you're finding stuff that's not working.

3492
02:46:00,320 --> 02:46:09,320
I agree that I wish there were some easier way to find the songs you own, but sadly I think that's the problem with PSN and Xbox Live.

3493
02:46:09,320 --> 02:46:12,320
Not so much something Harmonix could have changed.

3494
02:46:12,320 --> 02:46:25,320
If there's a silver lining that the game has been getting decent enough reviews, Harmonix has said that they consider Rock Band 4 to be a platform, and they are game to add in new features as time goes on.

3495
02:46:25,320 --> 02:46:31,320
So hopefully enough people are picking up the game to make that worth their while. That comes from Andy R.

3496
02:46:31,320 --> 02:46:42,320
Thank you for the email, Andy R. Hey, Diablo 3 got fixed. Destiny got fixed. That's this weird thing about where we're at with gaming these days.

3497
02:46:42,320 --> 02:46:50,320
So you know what? Maybe they can make some patches and make Rock Band 4 get some more of those pluses to make up for some of the minuses.

3498
02:46:51,320 --> 02:46:54,320
Alright, last email. It's a little bit of a long one, but I'll read it.

3499
02:46:54,320 --> 02:47:01,320
Hello, OLR. And if this is actually your real legitimate name, I am sorry for sitting on air, but it looks like a nickname.

3500
02:47:01,320 --> 02:47:14,320
So, James Nighthawk here. I've been listening for about six months now after hearing about the show from Rob while guesting with the crazy chaps on Koopa Club, and I've been meaning to email to say hi.

3501
02:47:14,320 --> 02:47:19,320
Recently someone suggested on your show that Rob's superpowers should be making people start podcasts.

3502
02:47:20,320 --> 02:47:27,320
Well, I just wanted to say that you guys at OLR are in no small part responsible for myself starting my own podcast this summer.

3503
02:47:27,320 --> 02:47:33,320
I am a songwriter and music producer by trade. I have been an active member of Songwriting Forum for years.

3504
02:47:33,320 --> 02:47:45,320
It was after listening to OLR Koopa Club and a few other indie podcasts that I realized that it is a passion and personality that really matter to giving a podcast a unique edge.

3505
02:47:45,320 --> 02:47:55,320
I have listened to bigger budget podcasts for years from the likes of the BBC and such, but the smaller indie podcasts seem to allow a freedom of expression that really appeals to me.

3506
02:47:55,320 --> 02:48:06,320
Can I just jump in real quick? First off, if he's a songwriter, I don't think he's going to mind at all. I'm pretty sure I saw a tweet from this person this week, and I don't think they're going to mind at all that you said their name.

3507
02:48:07,320 --> 02:48:17,320
I was going to say also shout out to Koopa Club. I was supposed to guest on their show again this past week, but Jeremy got sick, so I guess we're rescheduling that.

3508
02:48:17,320 --> 02:48:23,320
They were on a little hiatus, and they're kind of doing a different format now. So yeah, shout out to them.

3509
02:48:24,320 --> 02:48:38,320
I also want to say to that comment is that I really agree. I think part of that is when you're doing a podcast for the BBC or even something like IGN or whatever, you have to remember that whatever you're saying kind of reflects on your company.

3510
02:48:38,320 --> 02:48:47,320
So I think even though you can have a No Whole Bards podcast or whatever, you still have that in the back of your mind that you're representing your company.

3511
02:48:47,320 --> 02:48:54,320
Whereas here on OLR, my day job has nothing to do with the gaming industry. If it did, I probably wouldn't be able to do this show for you guys.

3512
02:48:54,320 --> 02:49:01,320
But because my day job has nothing to do with this, I can speak freely. You know what I mean?

3513
02:49:01,320 --> 02:49:11,320
If I say something like, you know, such and such sucks, I don't represent my company when I say that. But it's why I don't do a podcast on corporate training or something. You know what I mean?

3514
02:49:11,320 --> 02:49:13,320
It's a big reason why I don't actually mention where I work.

3515
02:49:13,320 --> 02:49:14,320
Sure. I understand.

3516
02:49:14,320 --> 02:49:18,320
Other than that, I call it low cat and you guys have to deal with that.

3517
02:49:18,320 --> 02:49:29,320
Here's what makes OLR matter to me. Rob's adoration for games and his energy. Jamie's dry but warm random nature. Okay. Thank you. And Loki's glorious rants.

3518
02:49:29,320 --> 02:49:36,320
The games news itself, I have often already heard or read. It's what you guys have to say about the news that interests me.

3519
02:49:36,320 --> 02:49:46,320
Anyway, very quick plug, I started my podcast called Songwriter Select, where we give a songwriter's view on popular music and aim to inspire and inform musicians.

3520
02:49:46,320 --> 02:49:57,320
The early feedback we were getting seems to be validating my view that people want a slant, a personal edge to the topics at hand, just like you guys do for video games.

3521
02:49:57,320 --> 02:50:02,320
And musicians listening, do check us out. We actually have a few in our chat room right now.

3522
02:50:02,320 --> 02:50:07,320
I do not mind a cheap plug at all, especially when you're going to be so kind to say as we played a part in the inspiration of that.

3523
02:50:07,320 --> 02:50:14,320
I think that is truly the best compliment somebody can give this show, is that your show inspired me to start my own show.

3524
02:50:14,320 --> 02:50:15,320
Happy for the plug.

3525
02:50:15,320 --> 02:50:16,320
Yeah, happy to be here.

3526
02:50:16,320 --> 02:50:22,320
That all said, I am of course a big gamer. Thanks to Rob for replying to my tweet earlier this week about Rock Band 4.

3527
02:50:22,320 --> 02:50:25,320
Please do keep OLR updated with your views on the game.

3528
02:50:25,320 --> 02:50:37,320
I have been on the Rock Band wagon since Rock Band 1. I really really want the disc imports to be confirmed before I jump on Rock Band 4.

3529
02:50:37,320 --> 02:50:40,320
I think our writer here is from the UK.

3530
02:50:40,320 --> 02:50:44,320
Yes, it's the tweet I was thinking of earlier this week.

3531
02:50:44,320 --> 02:50:46,320
Two quick Rock Band questions.

3532
02:50:46,320 --> 02:50:56,320
One, how is the frame rate? In Rock Band 2 and 3, when playing as a band, it chugged a fair bit, which is annoying as a smooth note chart helps me concentrate.

3533
02:50:56,320 --> 02:51:01,320
I, going to be honest, haven't played the full band yet, but remember they removed some instruments in Rock Band 4.

3534
02:51:01,320 --> 02:51:06,320
So you won't have the same band that you had in Rock Band 3, because there's no keyboards now.

3535
02:51:06,320 --> 02:51:09,320
Maybe we should stream some stuff. I'll sing live.

3536
02:51:09,320 --> 02:51:14,320
Well, that's quite the offer. I don't have a freaking microphone, but maybe I can get one.

3537
02:51:14,320 --> 02:51:15,320
Do you?

3538
02:51:15,320 --> 02:51:17,320
I think I might have the ones that'll work.

3539
02:51:17,320 --> 02:51:20,320
Yeah, I'll have to see if it'll work, but if it does, yeah, heck yeah.

3540
02:51:20,320 --> 02:51:22,320
Actually, no, ours might be Xbox.

3541
02:51:22,320 --> 02:51:24,320
Anyway, but we'll figure that out.

3542
02:51:24,320 --> 02:51:29,320
But, yeah, as far as the frame rate goes, it's smooth for me.

3543
02:51:29,320 --> 02:51:36,320
I also have a high refresh rate TV, and we are on the next gen system, so I would hope that's not an issue, but I haven't noticed any problems there.

3544
02:51:36,320 --> 02:51:44,320
Two, I have read about vocals being scored differently in Rock Band 4, so long as you are in key and on a note from the chord, you aren't marked down.

3545
02:51:44,320 --> 02:51:48,320
If this works, this is music to my ears. Again, bad pun, sorry.

3546
02:51:48,320 --> 02:52:00,320
Often with bands like Queen, which I have all the DLC for, bless you forever, the harmonies and the melodies are at the same level in the audio mix, so it's hard to know which is which.

3547
02:52:00,320 --> 02:52:06,320
When singing, I would be scored low for singing the wrong vocal line, even though it was perfectly in key.

3548
02:52:06,320 --> 02:52:08,320
Any reports on this first hand?

3549
02:52:08,320 --> 02:52:13,320
I have not first hand, but I've heard second hand that what you're saying is correct.

3550
02:52:14,320 --> 02:52:16,320
That it would still be that way?

3551
02:52:16,320 --> 02:52:22,320
By the way, the only reason I don't have Queen songs in Rock Band is because I have Sing Star Queen, just saying.

3552
02:52:22,320 --> 02:52:25,320
Because then you get the music videos, too.

3553
02:52:25,320 --> 02:52:30,320
But, yeah, as far as I know, that is the case, is what I'm hearing, too.

3554
02:52:30,320 --> 02:52:33,320
I don't know if anybody in chat has insight on that as well.

3555
02:52:33,320 --> 02:52:34,320
Ready for the end?

3556
02:52:34,320 --> 02:52:35,320
Yeah.

3557
02:52:35,320 --> 02:52:39,320
Anyway, sorry for the longish email, I tried to be concise, you were fine.

3558
02:52:39,320 --> 02:52:42,320
And blessed wonderful grammar.

3559
02:52:42,320 --> 02:52:47,320
Much love and thanks for the podcast, which I download here each Monday.

3560
02:52:47,320 --> 02:52:52,320
I will listen live one day, but being in England, that is some crazy late night antics right there.

3561
02:52:52,320 --> 02:52:54,320
And it comes from James Nighthawk.

3562
02:52:54,320 --> 02:52:57,320
Well, we do a couple times a year try to do the show at noon.

3563
02:52:57,320 --> 02:53:01,320
And usually it's because we have some other type of commitment, like the last time was what?

3564
02:53:01,320 --> 02:53:03,320
We were going to San Francisco, that was when Victoria moved away, right?

3565
02:53:03,320 --> 02:53:04,320
It was.

3566
02:53:04,320 --> 02:53:06,320
And then we ate chicken hearts.

3567
02:53:06,320 --> 02:53:08,320
Right, we did a show at noon, so we get to San Francisco in time.

3568
02:53:08,320 --> 02:53:17,320
So sometimes, and we'll call that our UK show, because it would be timed to be only 8 o'clock at night over in the UK as opposed to, what time is it on in the UK now?

3569
02:53:17,320 --> 02:53:19,320
It's 8 hours later than us.

3570
02:53:19,320 --> 02:53:21,320
So it's 2am in the morning is when it starts.

3571
02:53:21,320 --> 02:53:24,320
So unfortunately it's just, you know, time zones kind of suck.

3572
02:53:24,320 --> 02:53:26,320
But that's why we love the podcast.

3573
02:53:26,320 --> 02:53:28,320
Time zones are shite.

3574
02:53:28,320 --> 02:53:30,320
They're total shite.

3575
02:53:30,320 --> 02:53:32,320
Thank you, thank you for the email.

3576
02:53:32,320 --> 02:53:35,320
And long emails are perfectly fine, especially from first time emailers.

3577
02:53:36,320 --> 02:53:38,320
So, thank you. That's it.

3578
02:53:38,320 --> 02:53:40,320
You get one pass.

3579
02:53:40,320 --> 02:53:44,320
Participate at Orangeloungeradio.com.

3580
02:53:44,320 --> 02:53:47,320
Akuma JP in chat says no UK show.

3581
02:53:47,320 --> 02:53:50,320
Akuma JP doesn't like the UK shows because he's in Japan.

3582
02:53:50,320 --> 02:53:53,320
So when we do the noon shows, that's like 2 in the morning for him.

3583
02:53:53,320 --> 02:53:55,320
But it's like lunchtime for him right now or something.

3584
02:53:55,320 --> 02:53:56,320
Yeah, it is.

3585
02:53:56,320 --> 02:53:58,320
So maybe we need to do the Jcast.

3586
02:53:58,320 --> 02:53:59,320
Yeah, maybe.

3587
02:53:59,320 --> 02:54:02,320
God, then we'd have to be up till 2 in the morning to do the Jcast.

3588
02:54:02,320 --> 02:54:04,320
We'll do it Saturday, Sunday morning.

3589
02:54:04,320 --> 02:54:05,320
You know what?

3590
02:54:05,320 --> 02:54:07,320
We do it playing global.

3591
02:54:07,320 --> 02:54:09,320
We're just going to do the 24 hour show.

3592
02:54:09,320 --> 02:54:13,320
We have to one up our marathon show and do a complete start to finish 24 hour show.

3593
02:54:13,320 --> 02:54:15,320
What do you say, Loki?

3594
02:54:15,320 --> 02:54:18,320
I'd be fine with it, but my wife wouldn't.

3595
02:54:18,320 --> 02:54:20,320
Nelly should be on the show too.

3596
02:54:20,320 --> 02:54:21,320
We'll do it at your house.

3597
02:54:21,320 --> 02:54:22,320
Yeah, they'll never have that.

3598
02:54:22,320 --> 02:54:23,320
Alright.

3599
02:54:23,320 --> 02:54:26,320
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

3600
02:54:26,320 --> 02:54:29,320
It is about that time to get a little bit angsty.

3601
02:54:32,320 --> 02:54:52,320
FU to just certain issues and night terrors.

3602
02:54:52,320 --> 02:54:53,320
Alright.

3603
02:54:53,320 --> 02:54:58,320
Loki, let's see how vague I can be about this.

3604
02:54:58,320 --> 02:55:07,320
FU to situations in my life that would cause a therapist to basically summarize, say, you're

3605
02:55:07,320 --> 02:55:10,320
fucked.

3606
02:55:10,320 --> 02:55:12,320
Okay.

3607
02:55:12,320 --> 02:55:13,320
My view of the week.

3608
02:55:13,320 --> 02:55:14,320
You know what?

3609
02:55:14,320 --> 02:55:16,320
I had a pretty damn good weekend.

3610
02:55:16,320 --> 02:55:18,320
It's hard for me to be upset about anything.

3611
02:55:18,320 --> 02:55:20,320
FU to the fact that, oh, I know.

3612
02:55:20,320 --> 02:55:24,320
FU to the fact that I was really going to try and do some live streams last week and

3613
02:55:24,320 --> 02:55:27,320
then I went out and did shit like every single night last week.

3614
02:55:27,320 --> 02:55:28,320
So this week I got to work.

3615
02:55:28,320 --> 02:55:32,320
And FU to the fact that I've let my living room become a total disaster and I need to

3616
02:55:32,320 --> 02:55:33,320
clean this week.

3617
02:55:33,320 --> 02:55:34,320
I'm going to do that too.

3618
02:55:34,320 --> 02:55:35,320
So FU to cleaning.

3619
02:55:35,320 --> 02:55:36,320
Flaco.

3620
02:55:36,320 --> 02:55:41,320
FU not playing enough Splatoon this week and their ranking system is so hard.

3621
02:55:41,320 --> 02:55:42,320
It's so mean.

3622
02:55:42,320 --> 02:55:45,320
But I love it still.

3623
02:55:45,320 --> 02:55:46,320
Alright.

3624
02:55:46,320 --> 02:55:48,320
And Shane Alinko.

3625
02:55:48,320 --> 02:55:54,320
FU to the, oh, to insomnia and how hot it is in here right now.

3626
02:55:54,320 --> 02:55:56,320
I turned on the AC.

3627
02:55:56,320 --> 02:55:57,320
What more do you want?

3628
02:55:57,320 --> 02:56:00,320
Turn on three ACs.

3629
02:56:00,320 --> 02:56:04,320
I will turn on all the ACs just for you.

3630
02:56:04,320 --> 02:56:05,320
Alright.

3631
02:56:05,320 --> 02:56:07,320
FU to Shane.

3632
02:56:07,320 --> 02:56:08,320
He's never happy.

3633
02:56:08,320 --> 02:56:11,320
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys and then we're going to quickly open

3634
02:56:11,320 --> 02:56:12,320
up the Skyline.

3635
02:56:12,320 --> 02:56:16,320
We're already after nine o'clock so I am going to only have it open for a little bit.

3636
02:56:16,320 --> 02:56:18,320
So let's go over to Loki next.

3637
02:56:18,320 --> 02:56:25,320
So Valve is apparently removing some Steam games off of their service that are Linux

3638
02:56:25,320 --> 02:56:29,320
titles that don't support SteamOS.

3639
02:56:29,320 --> 02:56:33,320
And apparently these are being pulled because they're not meeting the standards or they're

3640
02:56:33,320 --> 02:56:35,320
incompatible with the system.

3641
02:56:35,320 --> 02:56:40,320
And so you would need to fix that if that's the case.

3642
02:56:40,320 --> 02:56:44,320
The games are no longer available for purchase but if you do own the game you can still download

3643
02:56:44,320 --> 02:56:46,320
and play it.

3644
02:56:46,320 --> 02:56:49,320
And I guess they were saying one of the games affected by it was Star Made and it was removed

3645
02:56:49,320 --> 02:56:53,320
due to a Java requirement.

3646
02:56:53,320 --> 02:56:56,320
So that kind of sucks.

3647
02:56:56,320 --> 02:57:00,320
So they're not just removing it because they're mad that the games, you know, don't work on

3648
02:57:00,320 --> 02:57:01,320
them.

3649
02:57:01,320 --> 02:57:09,320
Yeah, basically they don't want a game advertised as having SteamOS support if it has an outside

3650
02:57:09,320 --> 02:57:17,320
launcher, installer, flash, anything else that's required to run the game.

3651
02:57:17,320 --> 02:57:18,320
Alright.

3652
02:57:18,320 --> 02:57:25,320
Well lastly tonight, this could be interesting, a Wii U emulator has been released for Windows

3653
02:57:25,320 --> 02:57:26,320
10.

3654
02:57:26,320 --> 02:57:29,320
That's right, you can now emulate the Wii U on Windows 10.

3655
02:57:29,320 --> 02:57:31,320
Nintendo is not going to like that.

3656
02:57:31,320 --> 02:57:33,320
It's called Cemu?

3657
02:57:33,320 --> 02:57:35,320
I don't know if that's how you pronounce it.

3658
02:57:35,320 --> 02:57:36,320
Cemu?

3659
02:57:36,320 --> 02:57:37,320
I don't know.

3660
02:57:37,320 --> 02:57:38,320
Cemu?

3661
02:57:38,320 --> 02:57:39,320
Wii U?

3662
02:57:39,320 --> 02:57:40,320
Cemu?

3663
02:57:40,320 --> 02:57:41,320
Ceman?

3664
02:57:41,320 --> 02:57:42,320
I don't know.

3665
02:57:42,320 --> 02:57:50,320
It has Wii U titles at a resolution of 1920x1080, but it's still very much a work in progress.

3666
02:57:50,320 --> 02:57:56,320
There's no audio, some games crash, but some games like NES Remix actually run.

3667
02:57:56,320 --> 02:58:00,320
But then other games like Super Mario 3D World don't work so well.

3668
02:58:00,320 --> 02:58:04,320
And as you can understand, Nintendo's going to be a little bit pissed off about this because

3669
02:58:04,320 --> 02:58:09,320
the Wii U is kind of current hardware and if an emulator comes out it's just going to

3670
02:58:09,320 --> 02:58:13,320
you know, probably drive more piracy and so on, so that's not going to end up being a

3671
02:58:13,320 --> 02:58:14,320
healthy thing.

3672
02:58:14,320 --> 02:58:20,320
So, I could see that Nintendo's going to try real hard to shut this one down, but the question

3673
02:58:20,320 --> 02:58:22,320
will be, legally, can they?

3674
02:58:22,320 --> 02:58:27,320
I mean, at least when the NES and Super Nintendo emulators came out, it was kind of a while

3675
02:58:27,320 --> 02:58:29,320
after those consoles had sunsetted.

3676
02:58:29,320 --> 02:58:32,320
You know, even though there is the Virtual Console and so forth.

3677
02:58:32,320 --> 02:58:35,320
This one for a current system, I don't know.

3678
02:58:35,320 --> 02:58:36,320
We'll see.

3679
02:58:36,320 --> 02:58:37,320
Alright.

3680
02:58:37,320 --> 02:58:43,320
Anyhow, we are going to open up the Skype line 1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype,

3681
02:58:43,320 --> 02:58:45,320
Orange Lounge Radio.

3682
02:58:45,320 --> 02:58:46,320
But you know what?

3683
02:58:46,320 --> 02:58:50,320
I think it's about time we check in with our list list segment.

3684
02:58:50,320 --> 02:58:52,320
Let's quickly get to this list list tonight.

3685
02:58:54,320 --> 02:58:58,320
I'm going to be honest, a lot of ties across the board because there weren't a lot of votes tonight.

3686
02:58:58,320 --> 02:59:00,320
Where are our listeners?

3687
02:59:00,320 --> 02:59:02,320
I'm sad.

3688
02:59:02,320 --> 02:59:05,320
I was going to beg them all to vote in my movie poll article.

3689
02:59:05,320 --> 02:59:07,320
Alright, well, you still should.

3690
02:59:07,320 --> 02:59:12,320
While you're logged in, voting for this, go rank the movies in my latest Fall Movie Preview.

3691
02:59:12,320 --> 02:59:13,320
Thank you.

3692
02:59:13,320 --> 02:59:15,320
Alright, well, you know what?

3693
02:59:15,320 --> 02:59:19,320
It's the show where every gamer has a voice, but only when you use them.

3694
02:59:19,320 --> 02:59:20,320
So here it is.

3695
02:59:20,320 --> 02:59:23,320
Your top three as determined by the listeners.

3696
02:59:23,320 --> 02:59:26,320
The worst NES game they ever made.

3697
02:59:26,320 --> 02:59:27,320
We have two ties.

3698
02:59:27,320 --> 02:59:30,320
So for number three, we have a tie.

3699
02:59:30,320 --> 02:59:33,320
Back to the Future 2 and 3.

3700
02:59:33,320 --> 02:59:37,320
And Cheetahmen 2 for the worst NES game they ever made.

3701
02:59:37,320 --> 02:59:38,320
That's like a freeway tie.

3702
02:59:38,320 --> 02:59:39,320
I know, right?

3703
02:59:39,320 --> 02:59:43,320
And at number two, we also have a tie.

3704
02:59:43,320 --> 02:59:48,320
Tied for the number two worst game they ever did make.

3705
02:59:48,320 --> 02:59:53,320
Bart vs. the Space Mutants and Barbie.

3706
02:59:54,320 --> 03:00:00,320
But the number one, according to the chatters and our listeners, and this is it,

3707
03:00:00,320 --> 03:00:05,320
this is the worst NES game they ever made.

3708
03:00:05,320 --> 03:00:07,320
Bible Adventures.

3709
03:00:07,320 --> 03:00:09,320
Yes!

3710
03:00:09,320 --> 03:00:12,320
Bible Adventures is the worst.

3711
03:00:12,320 --> 03:00:15,320
I didn't even get a single damn answer on the list there.

3712
03:00:15,320 --> 03:00:19,320
With all those ties, I thought, oh, there's no way none of mine are getting up there.

3713
03:00:20,320 --> 03:00:21,320
I'm just surprised.

3714
03:00:21,320 --> 03:00:23,320
Anyone actually knew Cheetahmen enough to vote for it?

3715
03:00:23,320 --> 03:00:24,320
There you go.

3716
03:00:24,320 --> 03:00:26,320
Apparently somebody else suffered through it.

3717
03:00:26,320 --> 03:00:28,320
I think games done quick for exposure.

3718
03:00:28,320 --> 03:00:29,320
All right, so there it was.

3719
03:00:29,320 --> 03:00:30,320
The list.

3720
03:00:30,320 --> 03:00:33,320
Thank you guys that participated in that tonight.

3721
03:00:33,320 --> 03:00:34,320
Appreciate it.

3722
03:00:34,320 --> 03:00:35,320
All right.

3723
03:00:35,320 --> 03:00:37,320
I think actually, too, what happened is the votes were really spread out.

3724
03:00:37,320 --> 03:00:40,320
I think a lot of the people that did vote were all voting for different things.

3725
03:00:40,320 --> 03:00:41,320
So...

3726
03:00:41,320 --> 03:00:43,320
Don't downgrade my victory, Rob.

3727
03:00:43,320 --> 03:00:44,320
That kind of played...

3728
03:00:44,320 --> 03:00:45,320
No, I...

3729
03:00:45,320 --> 03:00:47,320
I think Bible...

3730
03:00:47,320 --> 03:00:49,320
Yeah, if they were still spread out, how come you didn't get any?

3731
03:00:49,320 --> 03:00:50,320
Ah, fuck off.

3732
03:00:50,320 --> 03:00:51,320
All right.

3733
03:00:51,320 --> 03:00:54,320
I honestly thought Barbie would be number one, but...

3734
03:00:54,320 --> 03:00:55,320
I thought so, too.

3735
03:00:55,320 --> 03:00:57,320
Bible Adventures in the top three doesn't spread out at all.

3736
03:00:57,320 --> 03:00:58,320
I thought X-Men would be up there, too.

3737
03:00:58,320 --> 03:00:59,320
Yeah, yeah.

3738
03:00:59,320 --> 03:01:00,320
All right, let's get to...

3739
03:01:00,320 --> 03:01:02,320
Will somebody eliminate a duck hunt?

3740
03:01:02,320 --> 03:01:03,320
That would have won it.

3741
03:01:03,320 --> 03:01:04,320
All right.

3742
03:01:04,320 --> 03:01:05,320
Nope.

3743
03:01:05,320 --> 03:01:07,320
1877 Game O-L-R, username on Skype.

3744
03:01:07,320 --> 03:01:08,320
Orange Lounge Radio.

3745
03:01:08,320 --> 03:01:10,320
Now I'm looking at it, and it's open.

3746
03:01:10,320 --> 03:01:12,320
Sorry, I want to make sure we got the list out there, though.

3747
03:01:12,320 --> 03:01:13,320
So, hey, we got a call coming in.

3748
03:01:13,320 --> 03:01:14,320
Let's get to it.

3749
03:01:14,320 --> 03:01:15,320
Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio.

3750
03:01:15,320 --> 03:01:16,320
Who's this?

3751
03:01:16,320 --> 03:01:17,320
Hey, this is Akdeft.

3752
03:01:17,320 --> 03:01:18,320
Yeah, hey, Akdeft.

3753
03:01:18,320 --> 03:01:19,320
How you doing?

3754
03:01:19,320 --> 03:01:22,320
Pretty fine, pretty fine, actually.

3755
03:01:22,320 --> 03:01:23,320
What's on your mind?

3756
03:01:23,320 --> 03:01:24,320
Really great.

3757
03:01:24,320 --> 03:01:25,320
I'm sorry?

3758
03:01:25,320 --> 03:01:26,320
All right.

3759
03:01:26,320 --> 03:01:27,320
Go ahead.

3760
03:01:27,320 --> 03:01:28,320
Oh.

3761
03:01:28,320 --> 03:01:34,320
Like I say, I was saying, I'm really feeling like...

3762
03:01:34,320 --> 03:01:35,320
Sorry.

3763
03:01:35,320 --> 03:01:38,320
Really great right now.

3764
03:01:38,320 --> 03:01:39,320
Do you...

3765
03:01:39,320 --> 03:01:40,320
Sorry.

3766
03:01:40,320 --> 03:01:45,320
You do remember the Dance Fighting Hertz in the Go campaign, right?

3767
03:01:46,320 --> 03:01:47,320
Yes.

3768
03:01:47,320 --> 03:01:48,320
Did it make it?

3769
03:01:48,320 --> 03:01:49,320
Yeah, actually.

3770
03:01:49,320 --> 03:01:53,320
Even last week, it was really, really far from its goal.

3771
03:01:53,320 --> 03:02:06,320
It had at least like over 100,000 still to get funded, and this week was really amazing

3772
03:02:06,320 --> 03:02:13,320
because every day it was going up like 20,000 a day or 25,000.

3773
03:02:13,320 --> 03:02:26,320
So, earlier today, they got to their goal of 436,000 thousand dollars.

3774
03:02:26,320 --> 03:02:35,320
So, right now, they're at 450,000 or 51,000 actually.

3775
03:02:35,320 --> 03:02:36,320
So, wait.

3776
03:02:36,320 --> 03:02:37,320
They're 9,000 short?

3777
03:02:37,320 --> 03:02:38,320
No, no, no.

3778
03:02:38,320 --> 03:02:39,320
They actually...

3779
03:02:39,320 --> 03:02:40,320
Sorry.

3780
03:02:41,320 --> 03:02:42,320
Sorry.

3781
03:02:42,320 --> 03:02:44,320
I'm getting really started.

3782
03:02:44,320 --> 03:02:45,320
Sorry.

3783
03:02:45,320 --> 03:02:46,320
Sorry.

3784
03:02:46,320 --> 03:02:47,320
Yeah.

3785
03:02:47,320 --> 03:02:48,320
Okay.

3786
03:02:48,320 --> 03:02:55,320
They're right now at 450,000 K. Yeah.

3787
03:02:55,320 --> 03:03:01,320
So, they actually got or they surpassed their goal.

3788
03:03:01,320 --> 03:03:04,320
That was 436,000.

3789
03:03:04,320 --> 03:03:05,320
Oh, 436.

3790
03:03:05,320 --> 03:03:06,320
I thought for some reason...

3791
03:03:06,320 --> 03:03:07,320
I guess I just misheard the number.

3792
03:03:07,320 --> 03:03:08,320
Okay.

3793
03:03:08,320 --> 03:03:09,320
So, they did make it after all.

3794
03:03:09,320 --> 03:03:13,320
That's the thing with the crowdfunding campaigns that usually the most money is made at the

3795
03:03:13,320 --> 03:03:15,320
very beginning and the very end.

3796
03:03:15,320 --> 03:03:21,320
Very little of it is made in the middle unless you have some huge presence, a huge interview

3797
03:03:21,320 --> 03:03:25,320
or some exposure breaks through or something really kind of pushes that campaign a little

3798
03:03:25,320 --> 03:03:27,320
bit in the middle.

3799
03:03:27,320 --> 03:03:29,320
So, yeah.

3800
03:03:29,320 --> 03:03:31,320
I'm glad though that everybody rallied at the end.

3801
03:03:31,320 --> 03:03:34,320
I think a lot of times too what happens towards the end is that everybody's like,

3802
03:03:34,320 --> 03:03:37,320
oh shit, this is my last chance to help the game out.

3803
03:03:37,320 --> 03:03:39,320
Procrastinators, right?

3804
03:03:39,320 --> 03:03:40,320
Yeah, basically.

3805
03:03:40,320 --> 03:03:41,320
They think so.

3806
03:03:41,320 --> 03:03:44,320
Most people want it right now, but at the same time, I can procrastinate.

3807
03:03:44,320 --> 03:03:46,320
I'll wait till the last possible minute and then I'll do it.

3808
03:03:46,320 --> 03:03:47,320
Right?

3809
03:03:47,320 --> 03:03:49,320
And there's still three days to go.

3810
03:03:49,320 --> 03:03:53,320
So, hopefully they get some of their stretch goals.

3811
03:03:53,320 --> 03:03:54,320
Yeah.

3812
03:03:54,320 --> 03:04:02,320
They're pretty much like 25,000 for Mac and Linux versions.

3813
03:04:02,320 --> 03:04:12,320
Though, if they get 546,000, they'll make another character, a new character for the

3814
03:04:12,320 --> 03:04:13,320
game.

3815
03:04:13,320 --> 03:04:15,320
So, hopefully they'll make it though.

3816
03:04:15,320 --> 03:04:17,320
It seems like kind of far fetched right now.

3817
03:04:17,320 --> 03:04:18,320
Yeah.

3818
03:04:18,320 --> 03:04:20,320
With a few days to go, you're going to have a lot of people to jump in there right at

3819
03:04:20,320 --> 03:04:24,320
the end to make sure they get their copy of the game and help things move along and get

3820
03:04:24,320 --> 03:04:25,320
to the stretch goals.

3821
03:04:25,320 --> 03:04:31,320
So, I feel like there's a good chance at depth, but happy to hear they made their goal.

3822
03:04:31,320 --> 03:04:34,320
So, them fighting herds coming out soon, right?

3823
03:04:34,320 --> 03:04:35,320
Yeah.

3824
03:04:35,320 --> 03:04:39,320
Coming out for Steam and hopefully in 2017, I think.

3825
03:04:39,320 --> 03:04:40,320
Yeah.

3826
03:04:40,320 --> 03:04:41,320
But, yeah.

3827
03:04:41,320 --> 03:04:51,320
Hopefully, again, this game will not only be popular among My Little Pony fans, but

3828
03:04:51,320 --> 03:04:55,320
hopefully for all fighting games fans in general.

3829
03:04:55,320 --> 03:04:59,320
Well, it sounds like, too, if you like Skullgirls, there'll probably be a lot here for you because

3830
03:04:59,320 --> 03:05:00,320
it's the same engine, right?

3831
03:05:00,320 --> 03:05:01,320
Yeah.

3832
03:05:01,320 --> 03:05:02,320
Yeah.

3833
03:05:02,320 --> 03:05:03,320
So, there'll be other stuff there for fighting game fans.

3834
03:05:03,320 --> 03:05:08,320
Now, we just have to have it show up at EVO.

3835
03:05:08,320 --> 03:05:14,320
Actually, the original game, Fighting is Magic, was going to make it at EVO, I think, last

3836
03:05:14,320 --> 03:05:15,320
year.

3837
03:05:15,320 --> 03:05:16,320
Really?

3838
03:05:16,320 --> 03:05:17,320
Yeah.

3839
03:05:17,320 --> 03:05:21,320
Remember they had that poll, that fun donation poll?

3840
03:05:21,320 --> 03:05:22,320
Oh, that's right.

3841
03:05:22,320 --> 03:05:24,320
Yes, I do remember that.

3842
03:05:24,320 --> 03:05:28,320
Yeah, that's when Melee got into EVO last year.

3843
03:05:28,320 --> 03:05:35,320
Actually, Fighting is Magic had the first place, but Mane6 said they couldn't have a

3844
03:05:35,320 --> 03:05:42,320
final build of the game made for EVO, so they dropped out of the donation drive.

3845
03:05:42,320 --> 03:05:43,320
Got it.

3846
03:05:43,320 --> 03:05:44,320
Got it.

3847
03:05:44,320 --> 03:05:45,320
All right.

3848
03:05:45,320 --> 03:05:46,320
Makes sense.

3849
03:05:46,320 --> 03:05:49,320
Well, Act F, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?

3850
03:05:49,320 --> 03:05:50,320
Not really.

3851
03:05:50,320 --> 03:05:52,320
That's all for tonight, I think.

3852
03:05:52,320 --> 03:05:53,320
Nope.

3853
03:05:53,320 --> 03:05:54,320
I appreciate it.

3854
03:05:54,320 --> 03:05:55,320
All right.

3855
03:05:55,320 --> 03:05:56,320
You take care, buddy.

3856
03:05:56,320 --> 03:05:57,320
Hey, take care, too.

3857
03:05:57,320 --> 03:05:59,320
Thanks for having me.

3858
03:05:59,320 --> 03:06:00,320
Bye.

3859
03:06:00,320 --> 03:06:04,320
I would have asked Act F about Ines's memory, but you know he's going to say something about

3860
03:06:04,320 --> 03:06:05,320
Kirby.

3861
03:06:05,320 --> 03:06:06,320
I can just answer that for him.

3862
03:06:06,320 --> 03:06:09,320
He actually did answer the question over on our Fugu Question of the Week as well.

3863
03:06:09,320 --> 03:06:10,320
All right.

3864
03:06:10,320 --> 03:06:15,320
Do you have any last minute stories, Loki?

3865
03:06:15,320 --> 03:06:17,320
Wait to see if any other calls come in.

3866
03:06:17,320 --> 03:06:19,320
1877 game OLR, username on Skype, Orange on Trio.

3867
03:06:19,320 --> 03:06:22,320
Did you guys talk about Allison Road canceling their Kickstarter and going-

3868
03:06:22,320 --> 03:06:23,320
You know what?

3869
03:06:23,320 --> 03:06:24,320
No, I don't think that came up.

3870
03:06:24,320 --> 03:06:26,320
Did you want to- I did remember reading about this, though.

3871
03:06:26,320 --> 03:06:29,320
I don't have it in front of me, but I know they got picked up by the people who make

3872
03:06:29,320 --> 03:06:30,320
the Worms game, I think?

3873
03:06:30,320 --> 03:06:31,320
Yeah, Team 17.

3874
03:06:31,320 --> 03:06:32,320
Yeah, Team 17.

3875
03:06:32,320 --> 03:06:33,320
So they got picked up by them.

3876
03:06:33,320 --> 03:06:35,320
It didn't look like they were going to make their Kickstarter.

3877
03:06:35,320 --> 03:06:36,320
No.

3878
03:06:36,320 --> 03:06:38,320
It looked like they were pretty far off from it.

3879
03:06:38,320 --> 03:06:42,320
I don't know how much time they had left, but it is hard to tell because it's in British

3880
03:06:42,320 --> 03:06:43,320
Pounds, I think.

3881
03:06:43,320 --> 03:06:44,320
Yeah, yeah.

3882
03:06:44,320 --> 03:06:48,320
I don't know if that was part of the problem, but yeah, they weren't going to make their

3883
03:06:48,320 --> 03:06:51,320
Kickstarter, but now they're getting in front of the more traditional route because they

3884
03:06:51,320 --> 03:06:54,320
have a studio behind it, which they said is good for them.

3885
03:06:54,320 --> 03:06:55,320
Well, trying to-

3886
03:06:55,320 --> 03:06:59,320
You got to spin it in a nice way when you fail your Kickstarter, right?

3887
03:06:59,320 --> 03:07:04,320
But, to be fair, with all due respect to the makers of Allison Road, I think what had a

3888
03:07:04,320 --> 03:07:10,320
lot of people excited about PT was the involvement of Guillermo del Toro and Hideo Kojima, so

3889
03:07:10,320 --> 03:07:12,320
it's kind of like you're trying to-

3890
03:07:12,320 --> 03:07:13,320
Piggyback on that?

3891
03:07:13,320 --> 03:07:17,320
You're kind of trying to piggyback on a game that everybody's pissed off is not happening,

3892
03:07:17,320 --> 03:07:20,320
so I think that was always going to be an uphill battle of sorts.

3893
03:07:20,320 --> 03:07:24,320
Well, hopefully with Team17's backing, I mean, hopefully they see the talent in that

3894
03:07:24,320 --> 03:07:27,320
little demo, because I think a lot of people did see that Allison Road demo and went, wow,

3895
03:07:27,320 --> 03:07:29,320
this is pretty cool.

3896
03:07:29,320 --> 03:07:34,320
So, hopefully Team17 can give them the more traditional backing they need to make the

3897
03:07:34,320 --> 03:07:37,320
game they envision, and then they can make a killing on the sales.

3898
03:07:37,320 --> 03:07:39,320
See what I did there?

3899
03:07:39,320 --> 03:07:41,320
A killing on the sales.

3900
03:07:41,320 --> 03:07:42,320
All right.

3901
03:07:42,320 --> 03:07:44,320
But we have no idea when the game's coming out, right?

3902
03:07:44,320 --> 03:07:45,320
Not even October 2016.

3903
03:07:45,320 --> 03:07:47,320
I would imagine it'd be so far away.

3904
03:07:47,320 --> 03:07:52,320
I think starters alone take two years, and maybe go in the traditional route, would that

3905
03:07:52,320 --> 03:07:54,320
make it faster or longer?

3906
03:07:54,320 --> 03:07:55,320
I don't know.

3907
03:07:55,320 --> 03:07:56,320
Probably the same.

3908
03:07:56,320 --> 03:08:00,320
The only new stuff that I saw this week that I watched a video on was that trans-pacific

3909
03:08:00,320 --> 03:08:07,320
partnership thing, that secret thing that they're drafting up of a guest that's basically

3910
03:08:07,320 --> 03:08:14,320
going to fuck over everybody as far as consumer rights and copyright and fair use and all that.

3911
03:08:14,320 --> 03:08:16,320
I do remember reading about this vaguely.

3912
03:08:16,320 --> 03:08:19,320
Let me come back to this real quick, because we do have another call coming in, but I want

3913
03:08:19,320 --> 03:08:20,320
to revisit that topic in just a minute.

3914
03:08:20,320 --> 03:08:21,320
But let me get to the phone.

3915
03:08:21,320 --> 03:08:22,320
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

3916
03:08:22,320 --> 03:08:23,320
Who's this?

3917
03:08:23,320 --> 03:08:24,320
Hey, everybody.

3918
03:08:24,320 --> 03:08:25,320
It's Rama.

3919
03:08:25,320 --> 03:08:26,320
Hey, Rama.

3920
03:08:26,320 --> 03:08:27,320
Thanks for the interview.

3921
03:08:27,320 --> 03:08:28,320
Hey, no problem.

3922
03:08:28,320 --> 03:08:29,320
Anything for you guys.

3923
03:08:29,320 --> 03:08:30,320
Aw, I was actually sorry.

3924
03:08:30,320 --> 03:08:33,320
I texted you, and I'm like, you're not keeping this for yourself?

3925
03:08:33,320 --> 03:08:39,320
Well, you know, I try to, you know, whenever I get the opportunity to interview voice actors

3926
03:08:39,320 --> 03:08:41,320
who have done a lot of gaming stuff.

3927
03:08:41,320 --> 03:08:42,320
Yeah.

3928
03:08:42,320 --> 03:08:48,320
I'll do an audio copy of the interview and hook you guys up, because it's going to be

3929
03:08:48,320 --> 03:08:51,320
a while before we put the video interview up on our YouTube page.

3930
03:08:51,320 --> 03:08:52,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3931
03:08:52,320 --> 03:08:53,320
No, I appreciate it.

3932
03:08:53,320 --> 03:08:54,320
I definitely appreciate it.

3933
03:08:54,320 --> 03:08:55,320
Yeah.

3934
03:08:55,320 --> 03:08:56,320
So what's on your mind?

3935
03:08:56,320 --> 03:09:00,320
I was actually thinking about the hardest Nintendo game I've ever played by Refleak.

3936
03:09:00,320 --> 03:09:04,320
Can't think of any, because most of the time it was a couple of Super Nintendo games.

3937
03:09:04,320 --> 03:09:07,320
I just found myself throwing the controllers left and right.

3938
03:09:07,320 --> 03:09:11,320
But my thing is about the whole Nintendo NX.

3939
03:09:11,320 --> 03:09:17,320
The way they're talking reminds me of the TurboGrafx-16 and the Turbo Express Portable.

3940
03:09:17,320 --> 03:09:18,320
Interesting.

3941
03:09:18,320 --> 03:09:24,320
Where the Portable played the exact same games from the exact same cards as the 16, huh?

3942
03:09:24,320 --> 03:09:25,320
Yeah.

3943
03:09:25,320 --> 03:09:26,320
That's a good point.

3944
03:09:26,320 --> 03:09:28,320
I hope the screen's bigger.

3945
03:09:28,320 --> 03:09:29,320
It should be.

3946
03:09:29,320 --> 03:09:30,320
It should be.

3947
03:09:30,320 --> 03:09:31,320
Oh, no, no, no.

3948
03:09:31,320 --> 03:09:38,320
There's nothing quite as hard on your eyes as playing the Portable, the Turbo Express.

3949
03:09:38,320 --> 03:09:41,320
I think there's still so many unknown factors, though.

3950
03:09:41,320 --> 03:09:43,320
Let's say it is a portable system and a console.

3951
03:09:43,320 --> 03:09:46,320
Does that mean that the games they make are going to be different?

3952
03:09:46,320 --> 03:09:50,320
Because when you play at home, would it be a dual-screen experience?

3953
03:09:50,320 --> 03:09:53,320
Whereas when you're on the go, it's a one-screen experience?

3954
03:09:53,320 --> 03:09:56,320
There's so many questions about it that I still have.

3955
03:09:56,320 --> 03:09:59,320
But again, this is all coming from the rumor mill anyway.

3956
03:09:59,320 --> 03:10:02,320
So this could all be for nothing, you know?

3957
03:10:02,320 --> 03:10:06,320
Yeah, because for a while they were saying it was going to be an Android-powered console.

3958
03:10:06,320 --> 03:10:08,320
I'm like, pfft, that ain't gonna happen.

3959
03:10:08,320 --> 03:10:09,320
No.

3960
03:10:09,320 --> 03:10:13,320
I mean, I could see where maybe Nintendo would make it easier for that, but I don't know.

3961
03:10:13,320 --> 03:10:14,320
Android-powered console?

3962
03:10:14,320 --> 03:10:15,320
PAX console?

3963
03:10:15,320 --> 03:10:16,320
Yep.

3964
03:10:16,320 --> 03:10:17,320
Yeah.

3965
03:10:17,320 --> 03:10:23,320
And I know when the NX comes out, everybody's going to want the backwards compatibility,

3966
03:10:23,320 --> 03:10:28,320
and they're saying that it's going to be much more powerful than the Xbox One and the PS4.

3967
03:10:28,320 --> 03:10:29,320
I'll just say this.

3968
03:10:29,320 --> 03:10:31,320
If you notice, PS1...

3969
03:10:31,320 --> 03:10:33,320
I mean, what am I saying?

3970
03:10:33,320 --> 03:10:34,320
I'm sorry.

3971
03:10:34,320 --> 03:10:35,320
I'm tired.

3972
03:10:35,320 --> 03:10:41,320
The X64, Xbox One, they went X64 straight up PC processing.

3973
03:10:41,320 --> 03:10:47,320
The way they built these consoles out, these consoles literally have a 10-year lifespan.

3974
03:10:47,320 --> 03:10:56,320
So if the NX comes out, it's going to be a PC-based console where the parts can be pulled off the shelves.

3975
03:10:56,320 --> 03:11:03,320
And I can see it being, if not powerful, just as powerful as the current next-gen consoles,

3976
03:11:03,320 --> 03:11:07,320
because to be perfectly honest, when it comes to price point, you could actually go to New

3977
03:11:07,320 --> 03:11:12,320
Egg or Micro Center and build a PC with the same specs as the One or the PS4.

3978
03:11:12,320 --> 03:11:13,320
No, you can't.

3979
03:11:13,320 --> 03:11:14,320
And it will run you about...

3980
03:11:14,320 --> 03:11:22,320
You remember that the PS4 has all that GDDR4, was it, the graphics card memory in it.

3981
03:11:22,320 --> 03:11:25,320
It runs a lot faster than your standard RAM.

3982
03:11:25,320 --> 03:11:27,320
I mean, that's not something you can just pull off the shelf.

3983
03:11:27,320 --> 03:11:34,320
Plus, I mean, the price points of those consoles are pretty high as it is, and Nintendo's going to want to keep a low price point.

3984
03:11:34,320 --> 03:11:39,320
And if you're throwing in like a second screen device as well, it's just going to be pricey.

3985
03:11:39,320 --> 03:11:42,320
That's why I think they may try to sell them separately.

3986
03:11:42,320 --> 03:11:52,320
There may be like an NX brand for both, but that the handheld would be one $200 purchase, and then the console's another $200 purchase.

3987
03:11:52,320 --> 03:11:59,320
So really, it's like $400 or even maybe $500 for the combo, but they're going to disguise it as two cheaper purchases.

3988
03:11:59,320 --> 03:12:03,320
That could be a thing. I'm not saying it will be, but that could be how they do it.

3989
03:12:03,320 --> 03:12:07,320
I can see that, because to be perfectly honest, one of the things that turned me off from getting a Wii U is the GamePad.

3990
03:12:07,320 --> 03:12:11,320
I'm like, I don't mind the console, but I don't know if I want the GamePad.

3991
03:12:11,320 --> 03:12:16,320
I mean, if I could play all the games without the GamePad, then why do I need it?

3992
03:12:16,320 --> 03:12:21,320
Yeah, but some games it's like, you know, Splatoon is built with the GamePad.

3993
03:12:21,320 --> 03:12:30,320
Whether we think it's that useful or not, you know, they would have to go back and make massive changes to the game to make it completely without the GamePad, and I just don't see that happening.

3994
03:12:30,320 --> 03:12:33,320
Yeah, you're probably right about that.

3995
03:12:33,320 --> 03:12:36,320
Except they do have a mode that runs off the GameChat, so you know.

3996
03:12:36,320 --> 03:12:39,320
You could stick to a tablet or something for a secondary screen, you know?

3997
03:12:39,320 --> 03:12:44,320
Yeah. Alright. Well, Rama, any other thoughts on your mind before we let you go?

3998
03:12:44,320 --> 03:12:54,320
It's October. It's 40 degrees out. I am sitting here with my space heater under the desk. What the hell?

3999
03:12:54,320 --> 03:13:00,320
It's hot in the studio. We have the light off in the studio and just the kitchen light on behind us. It's like really hot. I don't know if it's because there's five of us.

4000
03:13:00,320 --> 03:13:02,320
It's 63 degrees. We could crack a window.

4001
03:13:02,320 --> 03:13:08,320
I do have a window cracker. I mean, it's all the way over there, but here's the other thing. I didn't want to keep that window open because the sound traveled the neighbors.

4002
03:13:08,320 --> 03:13:09,320
Because the evil dead outside?

4003
03:13:09,320 --> 03:13:11,320
Yes, the evil dead and the neighbors.

4004
03:13:11,320 --> 03:13:12,320
And the spiders.

4005
03:13:12,320 --> 03:13:16,320
Alright. Anyway, I'm going to let you go, Rama. Thanks for calling.

4006
03:13:16,320 --> 03:13:17,320
Hey, no problem, dude.

4007
03:13:17,320 --> 03:13:18,320
Alright, take care.

4008
03:13:18,320 --> 03:13:19,320
Alright, bye.

4009
03:13:19,320 --> 03:13:23,320
Bye. Alright, there it is. That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

4010
03:13:23,320 --> 03:13:27,320
I wanted to quickly go back to what Loki was saying, though, before we wrap it up here tonight.

4011
03:13:27,320 --> 03:13:30,320
Loki, you were talking about the whole partnership on the streaming?

4012
03:13:30,320 --> 03:13:35,320
Yeah, basically it's a secret deal that's going on that only got leaked out by WikiLeaks.

4013
03:13:35,320 --> 03:13:41,320
And that's the only way we found out about it. It's basically going to make, first off, those types of leaks legal.

4014
03:13:41,320 --> 03:13:48,320
It's also going to make, if you infringe on copyright, and this could be anything from modding a game,

4015
03:13:48,320 --> 03:13:54,320
you could be held criminally for that, including jail time and unlimited penalties as far as monetary.

4016
03:13:54,320 --> 03:13:55,320
That's too much.

4017
03:13:55,320 --> 03:14:03,320
They would increase the copyright to basically match what the US has, which is the life of the creator plus 70 years.

4018
03:14:03,320 --> 03:14:09,320
It's just basically going to fuck everybody over. It's pretty much going to kill the modding scene.

4019
03:14:09,320 --> 03:14:17,320
You can't circumvent DRM in any fashion that's illegal, even if you do it just on a personal level.

4020
03:14:17,320 --> 03:14:18,320
That won't happen.

4021
03:14:18,320 --> 03:14:28,320
It will happen because, think about it, this is being drafted by 151 companies, or 150-some companies, to serve themselves.

4022
03:14:28,320 --> 03:14:33,320
And this is being done in secret, without the public knowledge, except it got leaked out.

4023
03:14:33,320 --> 03:14:36,320
Remember SOPA? That's the exact same thing that happened with that whole thing.

4024
03:14:36,320 --> 03:14:40,320
Once people got educated on it, they put their foot down.

4025
03:14:40,320 --> 03:14:47,320
We'll see, but they're already on their final draft, apparently, of this, and so it just has to be ratified by these countries.

4026
03:14:47,320 --> 03:14:48,320
Alright.

4027
03:14:50,320 --> 03:14:54,320
Okay, I guess that's going to wrap it up here for another episode of Orange Andrea.

4028
03:14:54,320 --> 03:14:59,320
We're almost like 9-20, so we're a little long tonight, and especially the podcast listeners are going to be like,

4029
03:14:59,320 --> 03:15:03,320
wow, this is a super long show, because the interview and our usual break is actually a part of it.

4030
03:15:03,320 --> 03:15:05,320
So, I do want to go ahead and wrap things up.

4031
03:15:05,320 --> 03:15:09,320
Thank you guys for sticking with us for an extra long edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

4032
03:15:09,320 --> 03:15:14,320
Hey, if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two, or 17, about the show.

4033
03:15:14,320 --> 03:15:17,320
Help us spread the word, because, you know, as we've joked about earlier in the show,

4034
03:15:17,320 --> 03:15:22,320
we don't have the backing of the BBC or IGN or one of those big companies,

4035
03:15:22,320 --> 03:15:26,320
so we could definitely use word-of-mouth support and tell a friend.

4036
03:15:26,320 --> 03:15:30,320
And that's, yeah, that's the best thing you could do for our show.

4037
03:15:30,320 --> 03:15:32,320
Really would appreciate it and help out.

4038
03:15:32,320 --> 03:15:35,320
Well, five-star review on iTunes or Stitcher Radio or wherever you found this show.

4039
03:15:35,320 --> 03:15:37,320
That goes a long, long way as well.

4040
03:15:37,320 --> 03:15:40,320
You know, if we were sponsored by CNN, they'd just tell us to lie to everyone.

4041
03:15:42,320 --> 03:15:46,320
All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

4042
03:15:46,320 --> 03:15:48,320
First off, I want to thank our guests for being here.

4043
03:15:48,320 --> 03:15:50,320
Flaco Jones, thank you for being here tonight.

4044
03:15:50,320 --> 03:15:51,320
You're welcome.

4045
03:15:51,320 --> 03:15:52,320
Always good to have you here.

4046
03:15:52,320 --> 03:15:53,320
I love being here.

4047
03:15:53,320 --> 03:15:54,320
Good job on List List.

4048
03:15:54,320 --> 03:15:55,320
We love having you.

4049
03:15:55,320 --> 03:15:56,320
I've never won before.

4050
03:15:56,320 --> 03:15:57,320
It makes me so happy.

4051
03:15:57,320 --> 03:15:58,320
Yay.

4052
03:15:58,320 --> 03:15:59,320
I won List List.

4053
03:15:59,320 --> 03:16:00,320
And you'll never win again.

4054
03:16:00,320 --> 03:16:01,320
No, never again.

4055
03:16:01,320 --> 03:16:02,320
I plan to.

4056
03:16:02,320 --> 03:16:04,320
Enjoy all the Bomb Corp you're going to play this week, I'm sure.

4057
03:16:04,320 --> 03:16:05,320
Yeah.

4058
03:16:05,320 --> 03:16:07,320
I just love that game.

4059
03:16:07,320 --> 03:16:08,320
And Yoshi.

4060
03:16:08,320 --> 03:16:09,320
And Splatoon.

4061
03:16:09,320 --> 03:16:10,320
There's not enough time in the game.

4062
03:16:10,320 --> 03:16:11,320
There's a lot of good stuff out right now.

4063
03:16:11,320 --> 03:16:12,320
I know.

4064
03:16:12,320 --> 03:16:13,320
It's a fun time to be a gamer.

4065
03:16:13,320 --> 03:16:14,320
So many good games this year.

4066
03:16:14,320 --> 03:16:15,320
So much better than last year.

4067
03:16:15,320 --> 03:16:16,320
Well, thank you for being here.

4068
03:16:16,320 --> 03:16:17,320
Do you have anything you want to plug?

4069
03:16:17,320 --> 03:16:18,320
Uh, yeah.

4070
03:16:18,320 --> 03:16:21,320
How about Flaco's fall movie preview?

4071
03:16:21,320 --> 03:16:24,320
If you're still logged in from voting on List List, go on there and rank the movies.

4072
03:16:24,320 --> 03:16:25,320
There you go.

4073
03:16:25,320 --> 03:16:26,320
Like six people have so far.

4074
03:16:26,320 --> 03:16:30,320
If you're listening to the podcast, just log in, make an account, rank the movies.

4075
03:16:30,320 --> 03:16:31,320
It's fun.

4076
03:16:31,320 --> 03:16:32,320
It's points.

4077
03:16:32,320 --> 03:16:33,320
It's points.

4078
03:16:33,320 --> 03:16:34,320
There's no prizes this month so far.

4079
03:16:34,320 --> 03:16:35,320
I don't think there's going to be a prize this month.

4080
03:16:35,320 --> 03:16:36,320
No prize this month.

4081
03:16:36,320 --> 03:16:37,320
But who cares?

4082
03:16:37,320 --> 03:16:38,320
The prize is winning.

4083
03:16:38,320 --> 03:16:39,320
But we're going to try and bring one back next month.

4084
03:16:39,320 --> 03:16:40,320
We're going to do any points now.

4085
03:16:40,320 --> 03:16:41,320
We're going to do prizes more often.

4086
03:16:41,320 --> 03:16:42,320
Prizes are fun, aren't they?

4087
03:16:42,320 --> 03:16:43,320
Prizes are fun.

4088
03:16:43,320 --> 03:16:45,320
I wouldn't know because I can't win any.

4089
03:16:45,320 --> 03:16:47,320
You know, that happens.

4090
03:16:47,320 --> 03:16:48,320
It happens.

4091
03:16:48,320 --> 03:16:49,320
It's okay.

4092
03:16:49,320 --> 03:16:50,320
I used to dominate.

4093
03:16:50,320 --> 03:16:51,320
I dominated for like the first year of vlog.

4094
03:16:51,320 --> 03:16:52,320
You get perks in other ways.

4095
03:16:52,320 --> 03:16:55,320
Your eternal prize is you get to guess on a level or whatever you want.

4096
03:16:55,320 --> 03:16:56,320
Yay.

4097
03:16:56,320 --> 03:16:57,320
Oh, that's so fun.

4098
03:16:57,320 --> 03:16:58,320
All right.

4099
03:16:58,320 --> 03:17:00,320
Let's get to Shane Alenko.

4100
03:17:00,320 --> 03:17:02,320
Thanks for being here.

4101
03:17:02,320 --> 03:17:03,320
Welcome.

4102
03:17:03,320 --> 03:17:05,320
And glad you got to bring up Power Rangers at least once.

4103
03:17:05,320 --> 03:17:06,320
Not enough.

4104
03:17:06,320 --> 03:17:07,320
All right.

4105
03:17:07,320 --> 03:17:08,320
To be honest.

4106
03:17:08,320 --> 03:17:09,320
All right.

4107
03:17:09,320 --> 03:17:10,320
Well, do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

4108
03:17:10,320 --> 03:17:12,320
Should be something Power Rangers related.

4109
03:17:12,320 --> 03:17:13,320
Wednesdays.

4110
03:17:13,320 --> 03:17:14,320
Am I right?

4111
03:17:14,320 --> 03:17:15,320
Oh, man.

4112
03:17:15,320 --> 03:17:16,320
I miss Kyle.

4113
03:17:16,320 --> 03:17:17,320
Kyle is so good.

4114
03:17:17,320 --> 03:17:18,320
There it is.

4115
03:17:18,320 --> 03:17:19,320
Play bomb course.

4116
03:17:19,320 --> 03:17:22,320
Shane, I have a story for you.

4117
03:17:22,320 --> 03:17:23,320
Okay.

4118
03:17:23,320 --> 03:17:27,320
Last Monday, I was sitting in and out near my house.

4119
03:17:27,320 --> 03:17:32,320
And I heard the Power Rangers sound go off and had to look at my phone and make sure

4120
03:17:32,320 --> 03:17:34,320
it wasn't you texting me.

4121
03:17:34,320 --> 03:17:38,320
And then I heard it again and I'm looking around going, who the fuck has that?

4122
03:17:38,320 --> 03:17:42,320
There's a person at work that I used to sit in the air that had that as their text to

4123
03:17:42,320 --> 03:17:44,320
him as well as like, that's so cool.

4124
03:17:44,320 --> 03:17:46,320
Is it the one that actually goes beep, beep, beep, beep, beep?

4125
03:17:46,320 --> 03:17:47,320
Yeah.

4126
03:17:47,320 --> 03:17:49,320
Not like mine, which is like a five hour song.

4127
03:17:49,320 --> 03:17:52,320
That's what Shane's text sound is on my phone.

4128
03:17:52,320 --> 03:17:53,320
How appropriate.

4129
03:17:53,320 --> 03:17:54,320
I thought so.

4130
03:17:54,320 --> 03:17:56,320
You know what Shane's text message alert is?

4131
03:17:56,320 --> 03:17:57,320
It's the whole dollar on you, Shane.

4132
03:17:57,320 --> 03:18:01,320
You know what Shane's text message alert is on my phone?

4133
03:18:01,320 --> 03:18:02,320
Same one everybody has.

4134
03:18:02,320 --> 03:18:04,320
You know what yours is on my phone?

4135
03:18:04,320 --> 03:18:05,320
What?

4136
03:18:05,320 --> 03:18:06,320
Spice Girls or something, right?

4137
03:18:06,320 --> 03:18:07,320
No.

4138
03:18:07,320 --> 03:18:08,320
It was Enkindle this.

4139
03:18:08,320 --> 03:18:09,320
Oh, that's right.

4140
03:18:09,320 --> 03:18:10,320
It's Blasto.

4141
03:18:10,320 --> 03:18:11,320
That's right.

4142
03:18:11,320 --> 03:18:12,320
I thought you had an Ab Fab one for me at one point.

4143
03:18:12,320 --> 03:18:13,320
Sweetie darling.

4144
03:18:13,320 --> 03:18:14,320
Lacroix.

4145
03:18:14,320 --> 03:18:15,320
Sweetie Lacroix.

4146
03:18:15,320 --> 03:18:16,320
All right.

4147
03:18:16,320 --> 03:18:18,320
Final thought for us, StarkSaga.

4148
03:18:18,320 --> 03:18:21,320
I should probably give you a different text sound.

4149
03:18:21,320 --> 03:18:22,320
Okay.

4150
03:18:22,320 --> 03:18:25,320
My final thought for the night is I should probably give anybody a different text sound.

4151
03:18:25,320 --> 03:18:28,320
And thank you again, Sinister Creature Con.

4152
03:18:28,320 --> 03:18:29,320
Yay.

4153
03:18:29,320 --> 03:18:32,320
And I look forward to GamerX and whatever other cons.

4154
03:18:32,320 --> 03:18:35,320
I'm going to go to MagFest and whatever other cons are coming up that I'm going to end up

4155
03:18:35,320 --> 03:18:36,320
going to.

4156
03:18:36,320 --> 03:18:37,320
GamerX.

4157
03:18:37,320 --> 03:18:38,320
Last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight.

4158
03:18:38,320 --> 03:18:41,320
My final thought is I'm working on a Halloween costume.

4159
03:18:41,320 --> 03:18:43,320
Going to be a Lego minifig.

4160
03:18:43,320 --> 03:18:46,320
So I haven't decided yet on which minifig I'm going to do.

4161
03:18:46,320 --> 03:18:50,320
I'm kind of tossed up between either Loki, which would be a lot harder because I have

4162
03:18:50,320 --> 03:18:54,320
to do a paper craft helmet and scepter, or Deadpool.

4163
03:18:54,320 --> 03:18:55,320
All right.

4164
03:18:55,320 --> 03:18:56,320
So one of those.

4165
03:18:56,320 --> 03:18:57,320
Deadpool.

4166
03:18:57,320 --> 03:18:58,320
Hit Loki.

4167
03:18:58,320 --> 03:18:59,320
I want to do Loki, though.

4168
03:18:59,320 --> 03:19:01,320
Hit Loki up on Twitter and let him know.

4169
03:19:01,320 --> 03:19:03,320
Have fun playing Ingress, by the way.

4170
03:19:03,320 --> 03:19:04,320
All right.

4171
03:19:04,320 --> 03:19:05,320
All right.

4172
03:19:05,320 --> 03:19:06,320
All right.

4173
03:19:06,320 --> 03:19:07,320
That's going to do it.

4174
03:19:07,320 --> 03:19:09,320
We will be back in seven days.

4175
03:19:09,320 --> 03:19:14,320
And I believe in seven days, I have to make sure and confirm all that this week, but I

4176
03:19:14,320 --> 03:19:18,320
believe we're actually going to have here in studio live with us somebody new here in

4177
03:19:18,320 --> 03:19:19,320
SAC who also does a podcast.

4178
03:19:19,320 --> 03:19:21,320
We're going to talk to him next week.

4179
03:19:21,320 --> 03:19:23,320
So look forward to that.

4180
03:19:23,320 --> 03:19:25,320
We'll be back in seven days to do it all again.

4181
03:19:25,320 --> 03:19:26,320
Have a great week, everybody.

4182
03:19:26,320 --> 03:19:27,320
Good night.
