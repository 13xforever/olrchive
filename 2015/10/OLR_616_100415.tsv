27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	36000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
36000	44000	It is Orange Lounge Radio tonight with episode number 616 for October the 4th of 2015
44000	56000	My name is Rob Roberts or on Twitter I'm at Skie and I am here with you every week in Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento, CA with my co-hosts
56000	60000	Say hello over there to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers
60000	67000	Hello, how are we fighting about? Is there a cookie that we're fighting over?
67000	70000	No, I wish I had a cookie
70000	73000	I wish I had a cookie too, sorry there are no cookies to be found here
73000	75000	There are pumpkin chocolate chip cookies at the grocery store
75000	76000	Yum
76000	78000	I told Becky she needs to make us some
78000	80000	Sorry DarkSakura, our cookie is in another castle
80000	82000	Well fuck that cookie, I'll make a cookie
82000	86000	Alright, also say hello to TechMasterLoki
86000	87000	Hi, I'm here
87000	89000	Hi, you're here, how you doing?
89000	90000	Doing alright
90000	92000	Two weeks in a row of perfect attendance everybody
92000	94000	Let's put it on the board
94000	98000	Number of weeks without an absence too, there we go
99000	102000	I feel like I should have one of those little white tote board thingies
102000	104000	You know, with the changing numbers
104000	108000	Anyway, myself, DarkSakura, and Loki here with you all of course to talk about
108000	111000	Video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle
111000	113000	You know what, no extra guests here in studio tonight
113000	117000	But that's okay because we always are joined by you guys in our chat room
117000	120000	Over at live.vognetwork.com
120000	124000	Where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
124000	126000	Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
126000	128000	Again that's live.vognetwork.com
128000	133000	And SSG100Matt in our chat room saying everyone gets a star today
133000	137000	And I'm assuming that is a gold star there in the chat room
137000	138000	Appreciate it
138000	140000	I don't recognize any other type of star
140000	143000	That's right, you don't ever see people handing out silver stars
143000	144000	It's like
144000	145000	Here's your bronze star
145000	147000	You know what, what if I like the color green?
147000	149000	Do I get a green star? Like how does that work?
149000	151000	We're orange lounge radio, should we have orange stars?
151000	153000	Come on people, think outside the gold box
153000	154000	Alright, no I'm kidding
154000	156000	We appreciate all the gold stars
156000	159000	Raginator in chat, I love this one
159000	162000	Says, two, two weeks without absence
162000	164000	Ah, ah, ah
164000	165000	That's a good quote
165000	167000	Raginator made a funny joke
167000	170000	Oh my god, this is going to be an amazing show tonight you guys
170000	171000	I'm so excited
171000	174000	Seattle chat says warp star
174000	175000	I like that
175000	178000	Although Starboard Power Coupling is on Thursday nights on the network
178000	179000	Anyway
179000	181000	We're here to talk about video games
181000	185000	And we actually do have a guest that's going to be joining us via the Skype line
185000	187000	In about 15 minutes here live with us
187000	190000	And we're really excited to welcome back to the show this week
190000	192000	Jackbox Games
192000	195000	And Steve-o is going to be joining us this week from Jackbox Games
195000	199000	To talk all about the Jackbox Party Pack Part 2
199000	202000	And we are very excited to talk about this upcoming release
202000	204000	Because I don't know if y'all played Part 1
204000	206000	But that was a lot of fun
206000	207000	And you know
207000	209000	In the interest of transparency
209000	210000	We here at OLR
210000	212000	We've made it no secret that we kind of
212000	215000	Alright sometimes we're a little partial to Jackbox Games
215000	217000	And it's not just because they'll come on the show
217000	221000	But I grew up loving those things like You Don't Know Jack
221000	224000	And you know the things that Berkley Systems used to do back in the day
224000	226000	Which you know if you trace their history
226000	228000	You know basically went from one company to another
228000	230000	Acrophobia and all this stuff
230000	233000	So I'm really happy to have them on the show
233000	235000	Talk about what they're doing these days
235000	237000	Because I really feel like they've kind of had a renaissance of sorts
237000	238000	In the past couple years
238000	240000	With the relaunch of You Don't Know Jack
240000	242000	And all these other things that they're doing online
242000	243000	So we'll be talking to them live
243000	245000	And if you want to join us in our chat room
245000	248000	Over at live.vognetwork.com
248000	251000	You can actually ask questions along with the interview
251000	253000	It's interactive like that
253000	255000	Very excited about that
255000	258000	Meanwhile though we are going to get to a kickoff topic here in studio
258000	260000	Because we do of course talk about
260000	262000	What's going on in gaming and gaming culture every week
262000	263000	Here at Orange Launch Radio
263000	264000	And tonight's kickoff topic
264000	265000	I want to talk about
265000	267000	A little bit of a real life experience
267000	268000	That I had today
268000	270000	And I want to get Dark Soccer and Loki's opinion on this
270000	272000	As well as you guys in our chat room
272000	274000	And today I went shopping
274000	275000	Which you know
275000	277000	Everybody goes shopping once in a while right
277000	279000	But today I went shopping to a lot of different places
279000	281000	Because my buddy Shane
281000	283000	Who calls into the show quite often
283000	285000	Who you know was a guest on Horde House
285000	287000	I'm sure a lot of you know him by now
287000	290000	Shane has this fascination
290000	292000	Shall we say with Power Rangers dolls
292000	294000	Which you know I get it
294000	296000	Everybody's got their thing right
296000	298000	You know what if you collect amiibo
298000	300000	You have no right to talk
300000	302000	To talk down to Shane about what he's collecting
302000	304000	So he loves his Power Rangers things
304000	305000	And he actually like
305000	307000	He does that thing where he kind of tracks
307000	309000	Like the different stores and what they're getting
309000	311000	And I think there's like a forum that he's posting to
311000	312000	So long story short
312000	314000	We had to go to like Target
314000	315000	Over on this side of town
315000	316000	And the Walmart over here
316000	317000	And Best Buy
317000	320000	All to look for basically Power Rangers dolls
320000	322000	And amiibo
322000	324000	Which was something that I was looking for
324000	326000	Because you know they've had the recent reprinting
326000	327000	Of some of the hard to get amiibo
327000	329000	So I was looking for some of that
329000	330000	At these different stores
330000	332000	Well the reason why I bring up going shopping
332000	333000	To all these different stores is
333000	335000	I'm really noticing
335000	337000	And I feel like we've talked about this on the show
337000	338000	A couple years ago
338000	340000	When this was first starting to take place
340000	343000	But now that we've had new games come out
343000	345000	Like Lego Dimensions last week
345000	348000	Shelf space being made for Guitar Hero
348000	349000	Skylanders
349000	350000	Amiibo
350000	353000	I am really feeling the toy-splosion
353000	355000	That's happening in the video game world
355000	357000	And I mean
357000	358000	When I was at Toys R Us
358000	359000	I'm telling you
359000	361000	Like one whole wall
361000	364000	Dedicated to the Lego Dimensions
364000	366000	And because you know what the Lego Dimensions is
366000	367000	It's the starter pack
367000	368000	But it's not just the starter
368000	370000	It's starter pack for Wii U
370000	371000	Starter pack for Xbox 360
371000	372000	For the one
372000	373000	For the PlayStation 4
373000	375000	And then it's level packs
375000	376000	Like you know
376000	377000	Portal 2
377000	378000	Back to the Future
378000	379000	Simpsons
380000	381000	Fun packs
381000	383000	Which is like more vehicles
383000	385000	Fun packs which are like characters
385000	386000	And then they have like
386000	387000	Team packs
387000	388000	Or something like that
388000	390000	Which are a few characters
391000	392000	Yeah
392000	393000	And then
393000	394000	Okay so
394000	395000	That's just Lego Dimensions
395000	396000	Now add to that
396000	398000	The fact that Skylanders has a new game this year
398000	401000	Everybody's going fucking nuts over Amiibo
401000	404000	Guitar Hero and Rock Band are now making a space
404000	405000	Which I
405000	407000	I know that isn't really toys
407000	410000	But it's still that odd peripheral space
410000	412000	That everybody said was dead
412000	414000	Cause remember this show goes back to
414000	416000	Dance Dance Revolution right
416000	417000	So when we started this show
417000	418000	Cause if you didn't know
418000	419000	Myself, Loki, Dark Sakura
419000	421000	We all met playing Dance Dance Revolution
421000	422000	And look at me now
422000	424000	You would never have noticed that
424000	427000	You would know that Loki has a strange affinity
427000	429000	For Eurodance music but
429000	431000	It is true
431000	432000	But anyway
432000	433000	Some of it I mean
433000	434000	Some of it
435000	436000	But anyway
436000	437000	You know at that point
437000	439000	I remember we would have conversations about
439000	441000	DDR saved peripherals
441000	443000	Peripherals were a joke
443000	445000	In gaming for the longest time in the 90s right
445000	446000	Because
446000	448000	What do we love to quote from the wizard
448000	449000	The power glove
449000	451000	It's so bad right
451000	453000	Cause it really was bad
453000	454000	Did you guys play with the power glove?
454000	455000	It was bad
455000	456000	And smelled funny
456000	457000	Yeah it did kind of smell funny
457000	458000	And then the U-Force
458000	459000	It didn't
459000	461000	Remember the magazine ads for the U-Force
461000	463000	Making it look like you would actually be playing pun
463000	464000	It didn't fucking work like that
464000	465000	It did not
465000	466000	Work like that whatsoever
466000	467000	The power pad
467000	469000	They made what like two games for the power pad
469000	470000	And that was okay
470000	471000	So it's like
471000	473000	Peripherals were kind of in this weird dead place
473000	475000	Where they didn't really make them
475000	476000	During the Super Nintendo era
476000	477000	Yes
477000	478000	I love the Super Scope
478000	479000	I know the Super Scope
479000	481000	But like what there was like one Super Scope game
481000	483000	Maybe I think there was a second more obscure one
483000	485000	I mean like there were not a lot of games
485000	487000	Well Super Scope 6 and then of course
487000	488000	The robot game
488000	490000	Cause really those are the only two games that you needed
490000	491000	Still what a weird ass
491000	492000	I mean think about it
492000	493000	Battle Clash
493000	494000	What a weird ass concept
494000	496000	That the Super Scope was to begin with
496000	498000	Who had the idea to put a fucking bazooka
498000	499000	Like
499000	501000	Hey we need a zapper gun
501000	502000	But that's too small
502000	503000	Let's have a bazooka
503000	505000	I'm not knocking
505000	506000	That peripheral
506000	507000	Because it was awesome
507000	508000	But I'm just saying
508000	509000	It was really weird
509000	510000	When you kind of go back and think about it
510000	512000	Why couldn't we just do the zapper again?
512000	513000	No?
513000	514000	Bazooka?
514000	515000	I don't know
515000	516000	But anyway
516000	517000	So all these peripherals come and go
517000	518000	But now it seems like
518000	520000	I don't even know if it's a renaissance
520000	521000	Or if it's just the fact that
521000	523000	Disney and Lego
523000	525000	Which are huge entertainment companies
525000	528000	And toy makers are now seeing these big dollar signs
528000	530000	Thanks to what Activision did with Skylanders
530000	532000	So now they're flooding with all this
532000	534000	But what is up with the toy splosion?
534000	536000	And how does this make you feel
536000	538000	When you go to the video game section
538000	540000	At let's say Toys R Us or Target
540000	542000	And over half
542000	543000	Excuse me
543000	544000	Over half of it
544000	545000	I mean
545000	546000	And that's not
546000	548000	Look at the square footage
548000	549000	Video games themselves
549000	550000	Don't take up much space
550000	552000	And a lot of that is shifting digital
552000	554000	And that might be part of this as well
554000	556000	But over half that shelf space
556000	557000	Are the toys
557000	558000	And the peripherals
558000	559000	And things that we
559000	560000	Like ten years ago
560000	562000	You could not have guessed that this was going to happen
562000	563000	You could not have guessed
563000	564000	And that's pretty nice for
564000	566000	Companies like GameStop
566000	568000	That are fearing that it's going to go all digital
568000	570000	Because it's not
570000	571000	There's no way they can
571000	573000	If they have all this crap that they have to sell
573000	574000	So
574000	575000	I don't know
575000	576000	So far
576000	579000	Prior to this year
579000	581000	It was pretty easy for me to avoid all that stuff
581000	582000	Because I'm like
582000	583000	Fuck that
583000	585000	I'm not really going to invest in Disney Infinity
585000	586000	Or
586000	588000	Skylars
588000	589000	Because just Skylars
589000	591000	I don't really give a shit about that
591000	592000	Disney Infinity
592000	593000	It was expensive
593000	594000	I tried it a little bit
594000	595000	And then just kind of like
595000	597000	It's not my age demographic
597000	599000	But then again
599000	600000	There's the Lego game
600000	601000	And I
601000	604000	That might be my Achilles heel right there
604000	607000	The thing about that Lego game for me
607000	608000	And I finally took the plunge
608000	610000	And I bought that Lego Dimensions
610000	613000	It is the tie-ins that they're tying in with
613000	614000	Are so random
614000	615000	But awesome
615000	617000	Like Portal 2
617000	618000	Simpsons
618000	620000	That Midway arcade thing
620000	621000	Ghostbusters
621000	622000	Back to the Future
622000	623000	That's the thing
623000	624000	Doctor Who
624000	625000	That's what finally sold me on it
625000	627000	Is that it wasn't just Disney movies
627000	628000	Or this made up universe
628000	629000	Which Skylanders is
629000	630000	But it was like
630000	632000	Really awesome things
632000	634000	Like all in kind of a giant blender
634000	635000	What do you think of all this
635000	636000	Dark Soccer?
636000	637000	I mean
637000	638000	You kind of used to collect this stuff
638000	639000	I mean
639000	640000	The Dreamcast game with a dish
640000	641000	Hello?
641000	642000	Well
642000	643000	But I was also
643000	645000	I was super into Cardcaptor Sakura
645000	647000	When I got that
647000	650000	And I came really close to getting the Sakura Taisen one as well
650000	651000	But you know
651000	654000	I had this big thing for collector's editions
654000	657000	Like back when we had a bunch more disposable income
657000	659000	Now we've got the income for it
659000	660000	But it's not so disposable
660000	661000	If that makes sense
661000	662000	Sure
662000	663000	And Dan and I were looking at it
663000	664000	And we're like
664000	665000	Well you know what
665000	666000	We could get this
666000	667000	And spend
667000	668000	$150
668000	674000	Or I could get Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer
674000	675000	For $50
675000	677000	And you ended up with Animal Crossing
677000	678000	Well there was that
678000	682000	We were actually going to get the Wii U Pro Controller
682000	685000	And then we looked at Lego Dimensions
685000	686000	And then did the math on it
686000	688000	And I ended up getting a game
688000	690000	With the Amiibo reader
690000	692000	The Amiibo card reader
692000	694000	Because I need all of the Animal Crossing cards
694000	695000	And that's more important
695000	696000	Which is funny
696000	697000	For me personally
697000	698000	And I'm not slamming your decision
698000	699000	But for me personally
699000	700000	I have zero interest in that Happy Home Designer thing
700000	701000	Yeah
701000	702000	I have no interest in it
702000	703000	But that's cool
703000	705000	How much of the last Animal Crossing game did I play?
705000	706000	Yeah I know
706000	707000	You played a lot of it
707000	708000	You played a lot more than I did
708000	709000	That's for sure
709000	710000	And now I get to design everyone's freaking homes
710000	712000	And they better love me for it
712000	713000	Let me go to the chat room
713000	716000	Which is lighten up over at live.vognetwork.com
716000	718000	Kaijuto in chat says suckers
718000	720000	And they mash all that stuff in
720000	723000	To sucker you to buy a cheap mediocre game
723000	725000	And Bobby Blackwolf defending his actions
725000	726000	Saying I'm a sucker
726000	728000	But I am having too much fun being a sucker
728000	730000	You know I gotta say though
730000	732000	And I really truly feel this way
732000	734000	Like I enjoy Legos anyway
734000	736000	So the fact that they kind of made a game around it
736000	738000	Their games are pretty good though
738000	740000	Like I wasn't like Lego Marvel
740000	742000	I was like yeah Lego games are pretty good
742000	745000	You know and they're pretty good
745000	746000	But I
746000	748000	It's just they're good I don't know
748000	752000	I really truly love the Amiibo figures themselves
752000	754000	Like and I know I've gone on rants about Amiibo
754000	756000	And that's all about the distribution
756000	758000	And now that that's finally calming its tits a little bit
758000	760000	And it's getting a little easier to find
760000	762000	You know some of the things you want
762000	764000	Especially if you're willing to pay just like
764000	766000	Four or five more bucks to get it from a Japanese import
766000	768000	Which is totally easy
768000	770000	You know I'm getting those figures a lot easier
770000	772000	And I gotta say I really just as a nerd
772000	776000	Who was raised on the Legend of Zelda and Mario Brothers
776000	778000	I just love those little figures
778000	780000	And if they didn't do anything with the game
780000	782000	I would be kind of okay with that
782000	784000	Because let's be real they don't do that much
784000	786000	Like Amiibos aren't
786000	788000	I mean it's cool that they have a little extra
788000	790000	And it's usually just something
790000	792000	Just a little extra something like a Mario Maker
792000	794000	And one extra little costume
794000	796000	Mario Kart and an extra costume
796000	798000	I'm not buying those figures for the costume
798000	800000	I thought that for Splatoon I'm like
800000	802000	Oh maybe I've got this you know Bowser
802000	804000	I'm gonna try using this
804000	806000	Oh sorry that only works with the Splatoon Amiibos
806000	810000	I'm like well then why would I buy those?
810000	812000	That's stupid
812000	814000	Wat meme in our chat room
814000	816000	Wat says
816000	819000	I'm holding out for the Montgomery Ward exclusive
819000	821000	One could only hope
821000	823000	That a store like Montgomery Ward
823000	825000	Where I believe
825000	827000	What was it we bought at Montgomery Ward
827000	829000	I think my Super Nintendo came from Montgomery Ward
829000	831000	I bought Killer Instinct there
831000	833000	Did you?
833000	835000	I believe that is where my mom bought my Super Nintendo
835000	837000	For Christmas was at a Montgomery Ward
837000	839000	Which has been leveled many years ago
839000	841000	And became a target
841000	843000	I believe the sales person said
843000	845000	Oh yeah our biggest selling game
845000	847000	On Super Nintendo right now is Drakken
847000	849000	And then my mom bought Drakken
849000	851000	Which I was like
851000	853000	What the hell is this game
853000	855000	When I played it
855000	857000	Well I mean luckily that was the packing game
857000	859000	And I played that like ten times more
859000	861000	But then
861000	863000	Wasn't it nice to have packing games all the time
863000	865000	Yeah remember those days
865000	867000	Then I went back to Drakken like a year after I had the Super Nintendo
867000	869000	And I was like what the fuck was I missing
869000	871000	This game was awesome
871000	873000	Then they did a sequel, Dragon's View
873000	875000	That game was tight
875000	877000	That game was awesome
877000	879000	So thank you Montgomery Ward salesman
879000	881000	For introducing me to a game I probably would have
881000	883000	Never figured out otherwise
883000	885000	Cialan Chat says
885000	887000	I want the Samus amiibos
887000	889000	Just to let Nintendo know
889000	891000	That the series still needs love
891000	893000	Raginator in chat over at
893000	895000	Live.vognetwork.com says
895000	897000	Seeing as I am a diehard
897000	899000	Magic player, the actual collectible card game
899000	901000	Back in the day, I can't say
901000	903000	Shit about Skylanders, amiibo
903000	905000	And so forth, you know that's a good comparison
905000	907000	Is that there's always
907000	909000	Been a space for collectibles
909000	911000	Even in the gaming world
911000	913000	Right, I mean board game
913000	915000	People right, aren't there usually like
915000	917000	Several editions of a game
917000	919000	Or even a game like
919000	921000	What Dominion has all these
921000	923000	Like it seems like there's like fifty different
923000	925000	Probably I'm exaggerating but like
925000	927000	All these different booster packs and things like that
927000	929000	For that game, or hell Cards Against Humanity
929000	931000	Right, how many people
931000	933000	Are like oh, if you go to PAX East
933000	935000	You gotta get me the exclusive cards
935000	937000	For my Cards Against Humanity game
937000	939000	Because they add something to the game
939000	941000	Whereas amiibos just add like a
941000	943000	Costume to the game and it doesn't really matter
943000	945000	It's just kind of an excuse
945000	947000	To sell DLC
947000	949000	But more expensive and it's
949000	951000	Less valuable
951000	953000	So like if someone tried to say hey
953000	955000	I'll tell you what
955000	957000	You know Mario Kart, do you want a really cool
957000	959000	Koopa hat, that's gonna be
959000	961000	Twelve dollars
961000	963000	You'd probably say fuck you, I am not buying that
963000	965000	But since they're selling it with a statue
965000	967000	Sure
967000	969000	We'll do that
969000	971000	And maybe I'll get to use it
971000	973000	In another game someday
973000	975000	Maybe, maybe
975000	977000	Alright, well we're
977000	979000	Going to get to our interview here shortly but
979000	981000	Before we get into our gaming weeks real quick
981000	983000	We'll at least probably get Dark Soccer's out here
983000	985000	And then we'll move into
985000	987000	Our interview tonight, so
987000	989000	Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
989000	991000	We always like to start off the show after our kickoff topic
991000	993000	Talking about our gaming weeks
993000	995000	Kinda busy, yeah
995000	997000	I of course played Dragon Age Inquisition
997000	999000	I
999000	1001000	What else, I got
1001000	1003000	Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer
1003000	1005000	Although I haven't had a chance to start it yet
1005000	1007000	What else
1007000	1009000	Oh yeah, we got our Wii U
1009000	1011000	Which you know we
1011000	1013000	Like a whole lot and we borrowed
1013000	1015000	Super Mario 3D World
1015000	1017000	And Dan and I started that together
1017000	1019000	Cause you know we can play co-op and
1019000	1021000	You know we fussed each other for you know
1021000	1023000	Knocking each other
1023000	1025000	Into enemies and what not, it was still pretty fun
1025000	1027000	And
1029000	1031000	Something else but I don't remember so
1031000	1033000	I'll just say that's it
1033000	1035000	Alright, Loki
1035000	1037000	How was your gaming week?
1037000	1039000	I did play a lot of stuff
1039000	1041000	I started off trying out Ingress
1041000	1043000	So I've been playing that
1043000	1045000	I'm so proud
1045000	1047000	I'm so happy
1047000	1049000	So I'm level 3 now in Ingress cause I captured
1049000	1051000	Two portals today and
1051000	1053000	It's basically just kind of
1053000	1055000	It's kind of gaming in that
1055000	1057000	Space between other things
1057000	1059000	I guess if that makes sense
1059000	1061000	Just taking my kids to the park
1061000	1063000	Instead of just sitting there
1063000	1065000	Bored while I'm pushing them on the swing
1065000	1067000	I can hack a portal and push them
1067000	1069000	On the swing, it's multitasking
1069000	1071000	It's like foursquare really
1071000	1073000	That's why I always kind of like you know we always
1073000	1075000	Just check in, we go places, it's kind of like that
1075000	1077000	Except now you can kind of, you can literally like
1077000	1079000	Piss on something for your team
1079000	1081000	And be like it's mine
1081000	1083000	I claim this in the name of Spain
1083000	1085000	I don't know if like I'd be going down like to
1085000	1087000	Oh I gotta go to some event or something in San Francisco
1087000	1089000	Or something, I don't know if I'd do that but you know
1089000	1091000	I don't know, it's something to do
1091000	1093000	While I'm waiting for things
1093000	1095000	I guess if that makes sense
1095000	1097000	So I don't know
1097000	1099000	And then let's see what other
1099000	1101000	Brief thing can I get into
1103000	1105000	Played a little bit of Lego Marvel Super Heroes
1105000	1107000	Because my son is still playing that
1107000	1109000	I think he's like 220 hours now
1109000	1111000	In that game
1111000	1113000	It's like you were with Minecraft at one point
1113000	1115000	I think he spent
1115000	1117000	More time in that game
1117000	1119000	So I'm looking forward to getting whatever the next
1119000	1121000	Lego Avengers
1121000	1123000	I love this comment from Bobby Blackwolf in chat
1123000	1125000	Loki gets a Wii U and then starts playing Ingress
1125000	1127000	That's great
1127000	1129000	I can't play Ingress at home
1129000	1131000	So it's just when I'm out
1131000	1133000	Ingress is an outdoor game
1133000	1135000	It is
1135000	1137000	And it got me to go walking one lunch
1137000	1139000	See that's what the game does to you
1139000	1141000	It's crazy
1141000	1143000	But anyway, I don't want to turn this into an Ingress show
1143000	1145000	Somebody suggested that I do one
1145000	1147000	I'm still thinking about it
1148000	1150000	Super Mario Maker
1150000	1152000	I made a level called
1152000	1154000	Jigsaw's Castle of Carnage
1154000	1156000	And no one has passed it
1156000	1158000	Except for me
1158000	1160000	It's incredibly hard
1160000	1162000	I know Bobby was talking about this on his show
1162000	1164000	Earlier tonight
1164000	1166000	All the levels are just torture porn
1166000	1168000	And I don't mean that
1168000	1170000	In a Jigsaw movie kind of way
1170000	1172000	It's all just
1172000	1174000	Everybody wanting to be asshole Mario
1174000	1176000	It's not asshole Mario
1176000	1178000	I have hidden blocks
1178000	1180000	It's not trolling you
1180000	1182000	It's just genuinely difficult
1182000	1184000	I guess
1184000	1186000	It's not incredible
1186000	1188000	I passed it after about 50 tries
1188000	1190000	It's just torture
1190000	1192000	There's a mistake in it too
1192000	1194000	I accidentally missed one of the pits
1194000	1196000	It has a block covering
1196000	1198000	I'm like ah shit
1198000	1200000	I gotta fix this and pass the game again
1200000	1202000	If I want to edit it
1202000	1204000	That's staying there
1204000	1206000	I played Splatoon
1206000	1208000	And I actually figured out how to play that finally
1208000	1210000	And enjoying it now that I have the paint roller
1212000	1214000	At this point though I can't use my other Amiibo stuff
1214000	1216000	For unlocking costumes
1216000	1218000	Still trying to figure out what I'm using that for
1220000	1222000	I think that's about it
1222000	1224000	That's about it for your gaming week huh?
1224000	1226000	We are actually going to go to
1226000	1228000	Our interview because it's about 6.30
1228000	1230000	So we are going to actually give
1230000	1232000	Steve-O a call
1232000	1234000	With Jackbox Games
1234000	1236000	And he is actually the editorial director
1236000	1238000	Over at Jackbox and tonight
1238000	1240000	We are going to be talking about the Jackbox Party Pack
1240000	1242000	Part 2 and I'm really excited
1242000	1244000	To welcome to the show Steve-O
1244000	1246000	Are you there Steve?
1246000	1248000	I am can you hear me?
1248000	1250000	We can hear you just fine welcome to Orange Launch Radio
1250000	1252000	Thank you for having me on
1252000	1254000	Thank you so much for being here
1254000	1256000	I don't know if you heard earlier in the show
1256000	1258000	We admit that we are a little partial
1258000	1260000	To Jackbox Games
1260000	1262000	Just because you guys come on the show
1262000	1264000	Just because I love
1264000	1266000	Game Show Games
1266000	1268000	I was talking about this with Mike last time we were here
1268000	1270000	When he was here
1270000	1272000	I don't want to necessarily repeat the conversation
1272000	1274000	I was so bummed when 1 vs 100
1274000	1276000	Went off of Xbox Live
1276000	1278000	I feel like you guys are making games
1278000	1280000	That help fill that gap if that makes sense
1280000	1282000	Oh yeah definitely
1282000	1284000	In fact as we
1284000	1286000	We are constantly trying to come up with
1286000	1288000	New ideas for games
1288000	1290000	The 1 vs 100 idea
1290000	1292000	Something that really keeps coming up with us
1292000	1294000	Something like that
1294000	1296000	That we might try to do someday
1296000	1298000	That is very similar to that but not that obviously
1298000	1300000	We wouldn't steal the idea
1300000	1302000	No you would never steal it
1302000	1304000	No no
1304000	1306000	Because you can play our games
1306000	1308000	On streams and there are hundreds of people watching
1308000	1310000	Since your phone is your controller
1310000	1312000	You can have a lot of people playing
1312000	1314000	I wouldn't be surprised
1314000	1316000	If we make something like the 1 vs 100
1316000	1318000	Kind of style of game sometimes
1318000	1320000	Inspired by
1320000	1322000	We'll say inspired
1322000	1324000	How has that streaming
1324000	1326000	Thing been going
1326000	1328000	Because I noticed
1328000	1330000	You guys noticed early on
1330000	1332000	With some of your earlier fibage
1332000	1334000	And some of the games you put out
1334000	1336000	During this renaissance period
1336000	1338000	Ever since the newer You Don't Know Jack games
1338000	1340000	You guys are putting out more things
1340000	1342000	On the networks
1342000	1344000	I noticed that the streaming
1344000	1346000	Has really been a big part
1346000	1348000	For you guys
1348000	1350000	So much so that I noticed in Quiplash
1350000	1352000	It seemed like you made some decisions
1352000	1354000	In the game such as enabling streaming mode
1354000	1356000	And doing these things that
1356000	1358000	Kind of catered towards live streamers
1358000	1360000	Have you been surprised that that has been
1360000	1362000	Such a huge part of the games?
1362000	1364000	Absolutely, in fact
1364000	1366000	We knew it was the thing
1366000	1368000	But we didn't realize with our games
1368000	1370000	How popular it would become
1370000	1372000	When we first did the first fibage
1372000	1374000	That's when we noticed
1374000	1376000	We saw people playing
1376000	1378000	They were giving comments
1378000	1380000	It would be great if the host had
1380000	1382000	A little bit more control over certain things
1382000	1384000	Such as
1384000	1386000	Well
1386000	1388000	There were things like time issues
1388000	1390000	People are playing on a stream
1390000	1392000	And they're not really live
1392000	1394000	15 seconds delayed because of the stream
1394000	1396000	How does that work?
1396000	1398000	Are they still seeing all the information they need
1398000	1400000	On their phone or on their controller
1400000	1402000	In case they can't see
1402000	1404000	They're not synced up with what's on the screen
1404000	1406000	We had an issue
1406000	1408000	At the beginning where
1408000	1410000	Any of the people
1410000	1412000	Who had logged in to play the game
1412000	1414000	Could actually hit the start button and start the game
1414000	1416000	So people
1416000	1418000	Out in the world were pressing
1418000	1420000	Start and not everybody had gotten in yet
1420000	1422000	So we sort of tailored that to be
1422000	1424000	Only the first person to log in
1424000	1426000	That would be the host or whoever is running the stream
1426000	1428000	Only the person who is running the stream
1428000	1430000	Can push the start button now
1430000	1432000	Stuff like that that we heard feedback on
1432000	1434000	And now we're really starting to integrate
1434000	1436000	Damn those trolls
1436000	1438000	It made the game even better
1438000	1440000	Even trolls can teach you a thing or two sometimes
1440000	1442000	Even though we shouldn't admit that
1442000	1444000	I noticed some of your games
1444000	1446000	Are tailored now to more and more people
1446000	1448000	For example
1448000	1450000	A lice water went up to 100 people
1450000	1452000	And I'm noticing in one of these games
1452000	1454000	That's in the Jackbox Party Pack
1454000	1456000	Bomb Corps
1456000	1458000	How many people can participate
1458000	1460000	Not necessarily play but participate
1460000	1462000	In Bomb Corps, tell us about that
1462000	1464000	Because that seems like it has to be done
1464000	1466000	With a streaming audience in mind
1466000	1468000	Because I know I can't hold 10,000 people in my living room
1468000	1470000	Well actually
1470000	1472000	There's a couple of games
1472000	1474000	In the Party Pack
1474000	1476000	The Party Pack 2
1476000	1478000	That we've integrated this
1478000	1480000	Audience feature
1480000	1482000	And so what the audience feature is
1482000	1484000	Is sort of like
1484000	1486000	You're not actually a player in the game
1486000	1488000	But you are participating in some way
1488000	1490000	So for instance in Quiplash
1490000	1492000	The audience
1492000	1494000	There's 8 core players
1494000	1496000	Up to 8 core players
1496000	1498000	But as many as 10,000 people can join
1498000	1500000	Because they can vote on their favorite answers
1500000	1502000	And actually affect the outcome of the game
1502000	1504000	So
1504000	1506000	We have games
1506000	1508000	Like lice water
1508000	1510000	Goes up to actually 100 players
1510000	1512000	That could actually play it
1512000	1514000	As a player
1514000	1516000	But now we're starting to find
1516000	1518000	This other little area which is called the audience
1518000	1520000	Where it's sort of like a
1520000	1522000	It's like partial participation in the game
1522000	1524000	While you're viewing it
1524000	1526000	And when you're
1526000	1528000	When you're not like a full time player in the game
1528000	1530000	You know our servers
1530000	1532000	The way our architecture is sort of set up
1532000	1534000	We can sort of support more of a
1534000	1536000	Semi player if you will
1536000	1538000	So the people who are watching on streams
1538000	1540000	Aren't just passively watching our games now
1540000	1542000	We can get 10,000 people in
1542000	1544000	And actually have some sort of effect on the game
1544000	1546000	It is this really fascinating
1546000	1548000	Trend I'm seeing with games
1548000	1550000	Not just from you guys
1550000	1552000	But I was at TwitchCon for a little bit
1552000	1554000	And I was talking about that on the show last week
1554000	1556000	And I know you guys were there too
1556000	1558000	I noticed there were actually games being made
1558000	1560000	With Twitch in mind
1560000	1562000	And there was this one game being shown
1562000	1564000	Where they could add obstacles and things
1564000	1566000	And I remember in the Tomb Raider collection
1566000	1568000	That was one of the earliest ones I remember
1568000	1570000	That would really affect things
1570000	1572000	It sounds like you guys are kind of taking that as well
1572000	1574000	Where you're playing with the world
1574000	1576000	And they can impact the game
1576000	1578000	I mean how is
1578000	1580000	How was TwitchCon for you guys
1580000	1582000	And all that?
1582000	1584000	I wasn't out there
1584000	1586000	We were out there
1586000	1588000	My coworkers were out there
1588000	1590000	And yeah it's definitely
1590000	1592000	And the Twitch folks
1592000	1594000	Are very interested in what we're doing too
1594000	1596000	So they're being very
1596000	1598000	Open to sort of
1598000	1600000	Helping us get our stuff
1600000	1602000	Optimized for
1602000	1604000	Twitch
1604000	1606000	So I think we have a good working relationship
1606000	1608000	With them that's kind of building right now
1608000	1610000	But I was out at PAX Prime
1610000	1612000	Not too long ago
1612000	1614000	And we actually did a
1614000	1616000	Talk with the folks
1616000	1618000	Who do iDAR
1618000	1620000	I don't know if you're familiar with that
1620000	1622000	It's a game where audience participation is there
1622000	1624000	People are
1624000	1626000	Sending hashtags through Twitter
1626000	1628000	And they're sort of
1628000	1630000	Adding bombs and all sorts of things
1630000	1632000	To the game
1632000	1634000	The way we do it is a little bit different
1634000	1636000	You're either voting on a winner
1636000	1638000	Or you're playing along with the questions
1638000	1640000	The trivia questions
1640000	1642000	There's a lot of different ways
1642000	1644000	Integrating this sort of concept
1644000	1646000	Of like hey people are
1646000	1648000	Enjoying just watching games
1648000	1650000	Wouldn't it be cool if we could actually give them
1650000	1652000	A little bit of participation too
1652000	1654000	Let's talk a little more about some of the games
1654000	1656000	That are going to be in the Jackbox Party Pack
1656000	1658000	In case you guys have missed it
1658000	1660000	Or out there listening
1660000	1662000	I know on your blog and through your various
1662000	1664000	Social media streams which also includes
1664000	1666000	A live stream, you guys do your own live streams
1666000	1668000	On Fridays right?
1668000	1670000	2 o'clock central on Fridays, tune in
1670000	1672000	There you go, you can play along with people
1672000	1674000	Who make the games
1674000	1676000	You have 5 games that you've announced on your blog
1676000	1678000	That are going to be included in this game
1678000	1680000	Fibbage 2, Earwax,
1680000	1682000	Idiots, which I love that name
1682000	1684000	Quiplash XL and
1684000	1686000	Bomb Core
1686000	1688000	Now I got to ask a tough question
1688000	1690000	That I think a lot of folks are going to be thinking
1690000	1692000	And I got to ask it
1692000	1694000	Why did you pass on a You Don't Know Jack game
1694000	1696000	For this collection? I was a little surprised to see that
1696000	1698000	Well, you know
1698000	1700000	We're not killing
1700000	1702000	You Don't Know Jack
1702000	1704000	Oh yeah
1704000	1706000	I just noticed
1706000	1708000	It was passed on for this
1708000	1710000	So I was just kind of surprised
1710000	1712000	Because I was expecting that to be a game
1712000	1714000	Not that I'm disappointed
1714000	1716000	One of the things
1716000	1718000	What we learned when we were watching
1718000	1720000	People play the Jackbox
1720000	1722000	Party Pack 1, the original
1722000	1724000	Was that the games like
1724000	1726000	Fibbage and Drawfold
1726000	1728000	Were super streamable
1728000	1730000	And that's what we were
1730000	1732000	Kind of, a lot of the games that we were trying
1732000	1734000	To make for this version were
1734000	1736000	Sort of tailored a little bit more toward that
1736000	1738000	And while You Don't Know Jack is streamable
1738000	1740000	For sure
1740000	1742000	It's limited to four players
1742000	1744000	And it's really hard
1744000	1746000	With the timing of the questions
1746000	1748000	The way the game is kind of set up now
1748000	1750000	To really get an audience that's on a 15 second
1750000	1752000	Delay kind of involved in it
1752000	1754000	So the games that we saw
1754000	1756000	That were really big hits from the
1756000	1758000	Jackbox Party Pack 1
1758000	1760000	Like Fibbage, like Drawfold
1760000	1762000	We saw that those were games that people were
1762000	1764000	You know, they were able to
1764000	1766000	Create their own sort of content
1766000	1768000	On their phone slash controller device
1768000	1770000	And Fibbage, it's your entering
1770000	1772000	Lies, in Drawfold
1772000	1774000	You're drawing things that are funny
1774000	1776000	So we kind of tried to go
1776000	1778000	A little bit more in that direction with this
1778000	1780000	Party Pack 2
1780000	1782000	And so, you know, like I said
1782000	1784000	You Don't Know Jack is not dead
1784000	1786000	The five games in this pack
1786000	1788000	I think people are going to enjoy
1788000	1790000	From the perspective of
1790000	1792000	They're great party games
1792000	1794000	They're great for your controller
1794000	1796000	They're great for streams, or your phone is a controller
1796000	1798000	They're great for streams
1798000	1800000	And I think when we do You Don't Know Jack again
1800000	1802000	We'll definitely try to
1802000	1804000	Make some changes that make it a little bit more
1804000	1806000	Fitting with the kind of way we're doing things now
1806000	1808000	Okay, you know what, now I'm glad I asked
1808000	1810000	That question because what you're saying is making a lot of sense
1810000	1812000	See, I thought you might be being that
1812000	1814000	Band coming out on stage not wanting to play
1814000	1816000	Their hit single, I thought maybe that was what was
1816000	1818000	Going on, but no, I'm glad I asked that because what you say
1818000	1820000	There makes a lot of sense, you're right
1820000	1822000	The streams are more of that party
1822000	1824000	Streaming thing, whereas You Don't Know Jack, the timing is so important
1824000	1826000	That makes a lot of sense
1826000	1828000	Although if you throw your bras and panties
1828000	1830000	Up on stage, we might
1830000	1832000	Go ahead and make one
1832000	1834000	Well, if you insist
1834000	1836000	Alright, anyway
1836000	1838000	Loki, get on that
1840000	1842000	Alright, anyway
1842000	1844000	I hope you take like, you know
1844000	1846000	X-Men Underoos or something
1846000	1848000	Take? That would
1848000	1850000	That would complete my collection
1850000	1852000	Awesome
1852000	1854000	See why we like having them on the show
1854000	1856000	Alright, let's talk about some of these games that are in the Party Pack
1856000	1858000	I want to start with Bomb Corps
1858000	1860000	Because to me, when I looked at Bomb Corps
1860000	1862000	I was like, alright, this looks really different
1862000	1864000	For Jackbox, but I'm like
1864000	1866000	I'm here for this, this is the kind of retro
1866000	1868000	Looking thing, tell us a little more about
1868000	1870000	Bomb Corps and where this idea came from
1870000	1872000	And how it fits into the pack
1872000	1874000	Yeah, so, you know, what we wanted to do
1874000	1876000	Was like, since you use
1876000	1878000	Your phones as controllers
1878000	1880000	Or your tablet or your laptop
1880000	1882000	We have this ability to send secret information
1882000	1884000	So that's something that doesn't
1884000	1886000	You know, you don't get on a
1886000	1888000	When you're using just a standard game controller
1888000	1890000	So everybody, the fact that everybody could get
1890000	1892000	You know, sort of secret information that not everybody else had
1892000	1894000	We tried to
1894000	1896000	We were coming up with ideas that would
1896000	1898000	You know, really play to that
1898000	1900000	So with Bomb Corps
1900000	1902000	It's funny that you say Bomb Corps
1902000	1904000	Because we went back and forth on this
1904000	1906000	Is it, like, when it's
1906000	1908000	C-O-R-P period, is it corp?
1908000	1910000	Or corp, Bomb Corp?
1910000	1912000	We don't even know, we're going with corp
1912000	1914000	But you can call it corp if you want
1914000	1916000	I don't know, but then I also think
1916000	1918000	An actual, like, core of the bomb
1918000	1920000	I don't know, I thought maybe it was a double entendre
1920000	1922000	Because I notice you guys like puns
1922000	1924000	No, I thought that might
1924000	1926000	I thought that might have been the thing, but alright
1926000	1928000	Yeah, no, but anyway
1928000	1930000	I got, yes, so
1930000	1932000	The idea kind of came from this idea of
1932000	1934000	You know, how can we
1934000	1936000	Leverage this idea of, like, everybody
1936000	1938000	Has different information, so in Bomb Corp
1938000	1940000	You get, each
1940000	1942000	Player gets a little bit of information as to how
1942000	1944000	To diffuse a bomb
1944000	1946000	If the timer's ticking down
1946000	1948000	And you kind of have to do a co-op
1948000	1950000	Work together to diffuse the bomb
1950000	1952000	So, you know, I might say
1952000	1954000	You might say, oh, I've got rule number one
1954000	1956000	You know, don't cut any red wires
1956000	1958000	Unless they're next to white wires
1958000	1960000	And then the second person has a different rule and says
1960000	1962000	Don't cut anything about red wire, you know
1962000	1964000	So, or, only player three
1964000	1966000	Can cut wires, so it's
1966000	1968000	It starts off a little simple
1968000	1970000	And then it gets really, really complicated
1970000	1972000	Or really not complicated, it gets more challenging
1972000	1974000	There you go
1974000	1976000	Now, I'm just thinking, though, if I were the
1976000	1978000	I mean, you're gonna have those Lokis
1978000	1980000	Or the assholes of the party who lie about the direction
1980000	1982000	I don't do that
1982000	1984000	Well, you know what
1984000	1986000	Fine, we all know it's Jamie that does that
1986000	1988000	Who would say, oh, I made a mistake
1988000	1990000	It's Irene that would do that
1990000	1992000	That's true, Irene
1992000	1994000	Oh, come on, I'm the person in Maniac Mansion
1994000	1996000	Who just gets sick of the game, goes and blows up everything
1996000	1998000	Yeah, maybe
1998000	2000000	I pushed the red button in the pool
2000000	2002000	It's always Irene that's drawing the penis
2002000	2004000	In those games, it's all
2004000	2006000	It's like, okay, hmm, yeah, I wonder who did that
2006000	2008000	It's always Irene
2008000	2010000	Well, some of our games actually call for drawing up penises
2010000	2012000	So that's good
2012000	2014000	I think I actually saw on your Twitter account
2014000	2016000	Somebody lucked out and got the room code
2016000	2018000	D-N-I-S or something like that
2018000	2020000	It cracked me up
2020000	2022000	Yeah, you know, we actually go through
2022000	2024000	We actually go through an exhaustive process
2024000	2026000	Every time, it's like, what do we need to add
2026000	2028000	To this list that's not gonna get us in trouble
2028000	2030000	You know, and so
2030000	2032000	There's like an hour every time
2032000	2034000	We put out a game, it's like, alright, here's the
2034000	2036000	Existing list, is there anything else we've missed
2036000	2038000	You know, there's always something
2038000	2040000	You know, V-U-V-A
2040000	2042000	Bulba or something, I don't know
2042000	2044000	There's always something that we're like, well
2044000	2046000	That's okay, we'll leave it or we take it out
2046000	2048000	Are you telling me that Jackbox Games
2048000	2050000	Has a list of four letter words that goes around
2050000	2052000	The office, hey, if anybody can think of
2052000	2054000	Another four letter word that's not on the list
2054000	2056000	It's an hour long brainstorm
2056000	2058000	Every product, yeah
2058000	2060000	Let Steve and HR know by five o'clock Friday
2060000	2062000	Yeah
2062000	2064000	I mean, you know, mostly you're trying to get
2064000	2066000	The sort of, the really bad, like racist stuff
2066000	2068000	Anything that could be a derogatory term
2068000	2070000	Out of there, but then there's always one
2070000	2072000	That comes up and you're like, how did we
2072000	2074000	Miss that, like the penis one you just said
2074000	2076000	So
2076000	2078000	Alright, anyway
2078000	2080000	But the point, I was gonna say about BombCorp
2080000	2082000	If you, you know
2082000	2084000	The thing is, if you decide to blow everything up
2084000	2086000	And you decide not to play along, we think that
2086000	2088000	The moment where everyone blows up is pretty
2088000	2090000	Funny anyway and never gets old, so there you go
2090000	2092000	It's the Magroober experience
2092000	2094000	It is the Magroober kind of thing, yeah
2094000	2096000	And I'm gonna say that from now on
2096000	2098000	When I say the BombCorp
2098000	2100000	I'm gonna just say it that way when I'm plugging it
2100000	2102000	Right here on this show
2102000	2104000	Let's talk about some of the other newer games
2104000	2106000	I'm familiar with Fibbage and Quiplash
2106000	2108000	Although I'm sure there's lots of new features
2108000	2110000	We'll go back to those if we have time
2110000	2112000	By the way, if you guys have questions for Steve
2112000	2114000	Please, by all means, ask away in our chatroom over at
2114000	2116000	Live.vognetwork.com
2116000	2118000	I wanna talk about some of these other newer games that are in it
2118000	2120000	Earwax, we were joking around
2120000	2122000	On the show last week because we thought this was a pretty
2122000	2124000	Funny concept, so this is a game all around
2124000	2126000	Sound effects
2126000	2128000	And you just string sound effects
2128000	2130000	It's like charades but with sound effects
2130000	2132000	Tell us more about Earwax
2132000	2134000	Okay, yeah, so that was one of the things
2134000	2136000	When we started with Party Pack 2
2136000	2138000	We really wanted to get a game with sound effects
2138000	2140000	Because we had
2140000	2142000	Fibbage where you're typing in answers
2142000	2144000	And Quiplash 2 and we had Drawful where you were drawing
2144000	2146000	Things and we were like, what else can we do?
2146000	2148000	Well, we could submit sounds
2148000	2150000	And so we
2150000	2152000	Tried a whole bunch of different ways of
2152000	2154000	Doing it and what ended up being really the funniest
2154000	2156000	To us was this idea of
2156000	2158000	You get a prompt and it's
2158000	2160000	The prompt could be like
2160000	2162000	Retirement home
2162000	2164000	Love affair or something like that
2164000	2166000	Please God no
2166000	2168000	And then you have a car
2168000	2170000	A handful of sound effects
2170000	2172000	When I say a handful of sound effects on your phone
2172000	2174000	Or your tablet, you'll have a list
2174000	2176000	Of sound effects that are kind of like the cards in your hand
2176000	2178000	And you don't hear them
2178000	2180000	Necessarily, you just see the description of them
2180000	2182000	And you kind of are trying to put
2182000	2184000	Together a one-two punch
2184000	2186000	Two sound effects back to back
2186000	2188000	That best fit
2188000	2190000	That prompt that you got
2190000	2192000	So everyone submits their two sounds
2192000	2194000	And then you go through
2194000	2196000	A reveal to hear everyone's sounds
2196000	2198000	Back to back and it's usually pretty funny
2198000	2200000	And then there's a judge for each round
2200000	2202000	The judge is actually the person
2202000	2204000	Who picks the card in the first place
2204000	2206000	Old folks, retirement home, love affair, whatever
2206000	2208000	And then the person who's the judge
2208000	2210000	Gets to pick which one they like the best
2210000	2212000	That sounds
2212000	2214000	What's most interesting
2214000	2216000	About that to me is
2216000	2218000	Who's the person at the office that had to compile
2218000	2220000	All those sound effects
2220000	2222000	They've got a dream job, I'm telling you
2222000	2224000	Right, well Andy Poland is our
2224000	2226000	You know, our audio music guru
2226000	2228000	And I will say
2228000	2230000	That many, many of those sound effects
2230000	2232000	Obviously, we already had in our big giant
2232000	2234000	Database of sound effects that we use for all our games
2234000	2236000	But with the help of
2236000	2238000	Some interns
2238000	2240000	By the way, in BombCorp
2240000	2242000	You are an intern
2242000	2244000	Working at BombCorp
2244000	2246000	So we got to have a lot of fun with our interns
2246000	2248000	Our actual interns
2248000	2250000	During the summer
2250000	2252000	But anyway, I'm going off on a tangent
2252000	2254000	We had interns help us organize
2254000	2256000	The sound effects, but it's all Andy
2256000	2258000	When you hear a nice long fart sound effect
2258000	2260000	Andy Poland made that at some point
2260000	2262000	In his bathroom or near his bathroom
2262000	2264000	Oh my god
2264000	2266000	That's amazing, I love that
2266000	2268000	You passed it on to the interns too
2268000	2270000	Fantastic
2270000	2272000	Let's talk a little bit about Bidiots
2272000	2274000	Which is my favorite name of any game there
2274000	2276000	And I'm sure you guys must all have to
2276000	2278000	Brainstorm these names for the games as well
2278000	2280000	And somehow
2280000	2282000	Some genius comes up with this
2282000	2284000	But let's talk about Bidiots
2284000	2286000	So actually what you're drawing on your phone
2286000	2288000	And then the other players bid
2288000	2290000	On the art, like what is valuable
2290000	2292000	Or funniest, or how does that work?
2292000	2294000	Yeah, so
2294000	2296000	You're given
2296000	2298000	Kind of like our game Drawful
2298000	2300000	You're given a prompt
2300000	2302000	And you draw
2302000	2304000	This thing as best you can
2304000	2306000	And it's probably not going to be that
2306000	2308000	Your drawing's not going to be that great
2308000	2310000	But you get two drawings
2310000	2312000	And you draw two drawings within a minute and a half or so
2312000	2314000	And then you submit them
2314000	2316000	And they become pieces of art in this art auction
2316000	2318000	And then once you've submitted all your art
2318000	2320000	And everyone's submitted all their drawings
2320000	2322000	Everyone becomes a bidder at this auction
2322000	2324000	So it becomes much more
2324000	2326000	Of a fast paced
2326000	2328000	You know, just like you're at a real auction
2328000	2330000	And you get some secret information
2330000	2332000	On your phone
2332000	2334000	Or on your device, whatever controller you're using
2334000	2336000	That tells you
2336000	2338000	Certain things are worth a certain amount of money
2338000	2340000	There's a little bit of vagary there
2340000	2342000	So you kind of
2342000	2344000	Have an idea of what some things might be worth
2344000	2346000	And what they might not
2346000	2348000	And the other thing is
2348000	2350000	It might say, well, the drawing of
2350000	2352000	Bananas
2352000	2354000	Bananas playing volleyball
2354000	2356000	Or whatever
2356000	2358000	Might be worth a lot
2358000	2360000	Or might be worth
2360000	2362000	$3,200
2362000	2364000	And then you see an image up on screen
2364000	2366000	And it looks like it might be bananas
2366000	2368000	And it looks like there might be a ball
2368000	2370000	And the thing is
2370000	2372000	Obviously, for the purposes of the game
2372000	2374000	We've given everybody very similar drawings
2374000	2376000	So, you know
2376000	2378000	You may be thinking that this is a very valuable
2378000	2380000	Bananas playing volleyball
2380000	2382000	When in fact it's bananas
2382000	2384000	Doing the limbo or something like that
2384000	2386000	And it was only worth $900
2386000	2388000	So the idea is that you're bidding
2388000	2390000	You're trying to guess what each thing's worth
2390000	2392000	And then at the end of the game
2392000	2394000	However much money you have left
2394000	2396000	Plus the profit you've made on
2396000	2398000	Basically what the art pieces
2398000	2400000	Were valued at
2400000	2402000	Minus what you paid for them
2402000	2404000	That's the profit you make off of
2404000	2406000	And so at the end of the game you're trying to have the most profit
2406000	2408000	Awesome. Well, these games sound like a lot of fun
2408000	2410000	I love that, you know, it could have been tempting
2410000	2412000	To probably just make
2412000	2414000	Sequels to everything
2414000	2416000	In Party Pack 1
2416000	2418000	And I'm sure that would have been a lot of fun too
2418000	2420000	And you do have sequels, essentially, to fun games
2420000	2422000	But you have a little bit of that but mixed with these new ideas
2422000	2424000	And I think that sounds like it's going to be
2424000	2426000	A lot of fun. I'm looking forward to playing it myself
2426000	2428000	I want to get to some of the questions
2428000	2430000	In our chatroom over at
2430000	2432000	live.vognetwork.com
2432000	2434000	You know, we're a little bit delayed here
2434000	2436000	So we're just now getting a question on the sound effect thing
2436000	2438000	And we have a question from Matt in our chatroom
2438000	2440000	So when someone actually farts in the office
2440000	2442000	Do you all just blame it on Andy?
2442000	2444000	Like the dog, since Andy's the sound guy
2444000	2446000	We actually
2446000	2448000	Well, no, I'll tell you why
2448000	2450000	Because Andy, we're in Chicago
2450000	2452000	And Andy is actually in Michigan
2452000	2454000	So we have him
2454000	2456000	On an iPad
2456000	2458000	On a robotic
2458000	2460000	You might have seen
2460000	2462000	These things, but it's like
2462000	2464000	A stand with a wheel
2464000	2466000	And it's got his face on it
2466000	2468000	So he comes to meetings
2468000	2470000	And he moves around the office
2470000	2472000	It's like a robot
2472000	2474000	So to answer that specific question
2474000	2476000	No, we would not expect
2476000	2478000	It would have been Andy that farted
2478000	2480000	Because he's a state away
2480000	2482000	He's on his segue
2482000	2484000	But we do have
2484000	2486000	A lot of us have sound effects
2486000	2488000	At the ready at our desks
2488000	2490000	To play at any moment during the day
2490000	2492000	That's amazing
2492000	2494000	Of course, I know actually a lot of companies
2494000	2496000	The working remotely
2496000	2498000	And all that is being more and more a thing
2498000	2500000	So I'm not surprised to hear that at all
2500000	2502000	Let's see, Tigerclaw in our chatroom
2502000	2504000	Over at live.vognetwork.com saying
2504000	2506000	It must be a challenge to come up with all
2506000	2508000	The trivia in the game
2508000	2510000	Considering those questions get outdated
2510000	2512000	Faster after people play through it
2512000	2514000	Multiple times
2514000	2516000	Sure, that's a risk
2516000	2518000	That just means people are enjoying your game too much
2518000	2520000	That they wore out all the questions
2520000	2522000	So let's come up with new questions
2522000	2524000	For these games
2524000	2526000	Quiplash, the first version
2526000	2528000	Was out just a few months ago
2528000	2530000	And now here we are coming up on
2530000	2532000	Quiplash XL
2532000	2534000	Where do all these prompts come from?
2534000	2536000	How do you do it?
2536000	2538000	Well, thank you
2538000	2540000	We have a great staff
2540000	2542000	Of writers that we have on staff
2542000	2544000	It's a little bit different for each game
2544000	2546000	Quiplash
2546000	2548000	The prompts are
2548000	2550000	The challenge with those is not
2550000	2552000	Having too many that are similar
2552000	2554000	To each other
2554000	2556000	Because in Quiplash XL we have a thousand
2556000	2558000	Prompts
2558000	2560000	You're going to be hard pressed
2560000	2562000	To get through all of them
2562000	2564000	And some of those are from the original
2564000	2566000	Quiplash
2566000	2568000	We've added on to the original
2568000	2570000	So the challenge there is
2570000	2572000	Man, we've already
2572000	2574000	Asked about
2574000	2576000	What
2576000	2578000	Pat Sajak's
2578000	2580000	Breath smells like
2580000	2582000	Before
2582000	2584000	So we can't do what
2584000	2586000	Alex Trebek's breath smells like
2586000	2588000	So you get a lot of that kind of thing
2588000	2590000	So that's the challenge there
2590000	2592000	Those are a little bit easier to come up with
2592000	2594000	Because they're not based on facts
2594000	2596000	Now if you talk about something like Fibbage
2596000	2598000	Those are all sort of wacky
2598000	2600000	News of the weird
2600000	2602000	Kind of things
2602000	2604000	So you're kind of beholden to
2604000	2606000	Criminals and people out there
2606000	2608000	Just continuing to do stupid things
2608000	2610000	And getting in the news
2610000	2612000	Which luckily they do
2612000	2614000	So that's kind of
2614000	2616000	With Fibbage it's sort of like you're constantly
2616000	2618000	Scouring the daily news
2618000	2620000	Updates to see what
2620000	2622000	Stupid person has done another stupid thing
2622000	2624000	Or has created some
2624000	2626000	Completely useless
2626000	2628000	House made out of whatever
2628000	2630000	Florida Man
2630000	2632000	Yeah, Florida Man
2632000	2634000	Was everywhere on Facebook this week
2634000	2636000	Of the guy who lit his gas tank on fire
2636000	2638000	Trying to kill a spider
2638000	2640000	Oh yes, exactly
2640000	2642000	And in fact those things go around the office
2642000	2644000	And they're sent out and they're like
2644000	2646000	Fibbage 3, here's stuff
2646000	2648000	For Fibbage 3
2648000	2650000	You guys must have so much fun
2650000	2652000	At the office passing all this stuff around
2652000	2654000	I mean, it must be just kind of like
2654000	2656000	Being a part of the game all day
2656000	2658000	That's amazing
2658000	2660000	Yeah it's interesting and the thing is
2660000	2662000	When you're doing something like a party pack
2662000	2664000	You've got
2664000	2666000	Five mini teams
2666000	2668000	Out of a small group of people
2668000	2670000	So some people aren't
2670000	2672000	Even working on certain games
2672000	2674000	So you might be working on
2674000	2676000	Two or three and somebody else might be working on
2676000	2678000	Two or three, you might overlap on one
2678000	2680000	But we keep a constant
2680000	2682000	Slack thread going at work
2682000	2684000	So everybody kind of
2684000	2686000	Gets a little bit of insight into what's going on
2686000	2688000	In all the other games, even if they're not on the team
2688000	2690000	You kind of still feel a part of it
2690000	2692000	So I think that's a really cool thing about where we work
2692000	2694000	Alright, let me get one more question here and then we'll
2694000	2696000	Wrap up because I know we've had you on for
2696000	2698000	Way longer than we usually say
2698000	2700000	It's going to be 15, 20
2700000	2702000	Watmeme is in our chat
2702000	2704000	And I have a feeling he might know this is a loaded question
2704000	2706000	So this might be a good one to ask here
2706000	2708000	Watmeme in chat says, ask Steve-O
2708000	2710000	What would be his dream version of
2710000	2712000	You Don't Know Jack?
2712000	2714000	I think I know who that is, but I'm not going to out him
2714000	2716000	I have a feeling I know who it is too
2716000	2718000	But that's okay, I know this is a loaded question
2718000	2720000	So please answer
2720000	2722000	Well the fact that he called me Steve-O
2722000	2724000	The only people who call me Steve-O
2724000	2726000	Are the people who work at Jackbox
2726000	2728000	Because when I first started
2728000	2730000	At the company back when it was Jellyvision
2730000	2732000	There were like five Steves
2732000	2734000	So they had to give every Steve a little slightly different thing
2734000	2736000	And I got lucky, I got Steve-O
2736000	2738000	There were some really weird ones
2738000	2740000	So everywhere else I'm just Steve
2740000	2742000	At Jackbox, I'm Steve-O
2742000	2744000	So I know this is somebody who either
2744000	2746000	Been watching our streams or works anyway
2746000	2748000	I'm also going to say
2748000	2750000	Without telling people your full name
2750000	2752000	Your last name is not O
2752000	2754000	So it's not like they just used the last initial
2754000	2756000	Right, there's not even an O in it
2756000	2758000	Yeah, exactly
2758000	2760000	Yeah, no
2760000	2762000	My dream version of You Don't Know Jack
2762000	2764000	You know, it's kind of hard to
2764000	2766000	Put my, you know, we did the TV show
2766000	2768000	Did you know we did a TV show of You Don't Know Jack?
2768000	2770000	Yeah, I did, I was probably, I think I was the one guy
2770000	2772000	That watched it
2772000	2774000	Oh, you were him?
2774000	2776000	Oh, thank you
2776000	2778000	I was it with Paul Reubens, how could you not?
2778000	2780000	Because that was, was that before or after
2780000	2782000	The infamous, I think that was after
2782000	2784000	It was after, he was like resurrecting
2784000	2786000	His career, he was doing that movie
2786000	2788000	Blow with Johnny Depp at the time
2788000	2790000	That's right, that's right
2790000	2792000	I remember getting a Christmas card from him
2792000	2794000	And it had him and Johnny Depp and a bunch of
2794000	2796000	Women from the show
2796000	2798000	It was strange
2798000	2800000	And there's supposed to be a new Peewee movie, but anyway
2800000	2802000	Yeah, so my point is
2802000	2804000	We tried it as a TV show, we thought it'd be great
2804000	2806000	Because it's kind of like a TV show that you play
2806000	2808000	But it, you know, it didn't work out that well
2808000	2810000	It was, it had its, it didn't have its
2810000	2812000	It had its qualities, but
2812000	2814000	But like, as far as like the ideal
2814000	2816000	Version of You Don't Know Jack
2816000	2818000	I think if we could get it so that
2818000	2820000	You could play with more than four people
2820000	2822000	That you could stream it and that
2822000	2824000	The great thing is
2824000	2826000	That we still have Cookie, you know, our
2826000	2828000	Tom Gottlieb who plays Cookie Masterson
2828000	2830000	You know, it just would not be
2830000	2832000	The same without him, so thankfully
2832000	2834000	We still have him, he's been around
2834000	2836000	Ever since, you know, You Don't Know Jack volume 3
2836000	2838000	Even before that, but he was
2838000	2840000	The host of that, so it would have to have
2840000	2842000	Cookie Masterson, it would have to have
2842000	2844000	Support for more than four players
2844000	2846000	And I already have ideas
2846000	2848000	For the next version, but I don't want to
2848000	2850000	Give them all away here, plus I'll probably
2850000	2852000	Bring it all to work and people will be like, no
2852000	2854000	So, hahaha
2854000	2856000	Act Deft in chat is suggesting a one versus
2856000	2858000	100 You Don't Know Jack hybrid would be
2858000	2860000	The best thing ever
2860000	2862000	That's a direct quote, best thing ever
2862000	2864000	Oh, ever? Ever
2864000	2866000	In that case we'll get right on it
2866000	2868000	Apparently better than this program
2868000	2870000	Or pornography even, who knew
2870000	2872000	But there you go, Steve-o
2872000	2874000	I want to thank you so much for being on the show
2874000	2876000	Let's talk one more time everything
2876000	2878000	People need to know about Jackbox Party Back
2878000	2880000	Jackbox Party Back 2 is out
2880000	2882000	What, it's out this, like next week
2882000	2884000	Right, it's like ten days away, nine, right?
2884000	2886000	Yes, October 13th, so that's Tuesday
2886000	2888000	Tuesday, October 13th
2888000	2890000	Xbox One, PlayStation 3
2890000	2892000	4, Steam
2892000	2894000	Amazon Fire TV, Google Play
2894000	2896000	There you go, but
2896000	2898000	No Wii U, Steve-o?
2898000	2900000	No Wii U?
2900000	2902000	You're speaking the language of Ben Jacobs
2902000	2904000	Our beloved programmer
2904000	2906000	Who is in love
2906000	2908000	With all things Nintendo
2908000	2910000	We all love Nintendo, but
2910000	2912000	Right now it's not the right platform for us
2912000	2914000	I understand, I understand, I'm just being
2914000	2916000	Twitter, because I know you guys have got to get those tweets
2916000	2918000	Once in a while, what about Wii U?
2918000	2920000	But anyway, I understand, no, you guys are
2920000	2922000	Obviously supporting an awful lot there between all these different systems
2922000	2924000	And uh,
2924000	2926000	$24.99 local currency, right?
2926000	2928000	$24.99 American
2928000	2930000	And yeah, it's
2930000	2932000	I mean, I don't
2932000	2934000	I try not to sound like too sales pitchy
2934000	2936000	When I say this, but like, the work that we put
2936000	2938000	Into each of these games, we feel like we could
2938000	2940000	Sell each one of these five games for like
2940000	2942000	You know, $15 a piece
2942000	2944000	So the fact that you get five of them for $24.99
2944000	2946000	I mean, you can't afford not to buy
2946000	2948000	Okay, there, I did it, I went
2948000	2950000	I went all file, I went all sales pitch
2950000	2952000	It's $5 a game, $5 a game
2952000	2954000	Yeah, $5 a game, there you go
2954000	2956000	Alright, well Steve-o, best of luck to all you guys at Jackbox Games
2956000	2958000	And you guys are welcome back anytime
2958000	2960000	To announce whatever it is you might be working
2960000	2962000	On next, I assume inevitably
2962000	2964000	Someday this will be so successful
2964000	2966000	We might be here in a few months
2966000	2968000	Talking about Jackbox Party Pack 3
2969000	2971000	We will call you from our yacht
2971000	2973000	Sounds good, I look forward to it
2973000	2975000	Alright, thanks for having me on guys
2975000	2977000	Alright, take care, thanks so much for being here
2977000	2979000	Alright, bye
2979000	2981000	Alright, that was Steve from Jackbox Games
2981000	2983000	Of course, as they call him around the office
2983000	2985000	Steve-o, and if you want to read more about what Jackbox is up to
2985000	2987000	Jackboxgames.com
2987000	2989000	They're on Twitter as well
2989000	2991000	Over at Jackbox Games
2991000	2993000	And they're on Facebook
2993000	2995000	Hey, you know where? Jackbox Games, there it is
2995000	2997000	And I know I'll be picking up Jackbox Party Pack 2
2997000	2999000	On next day, I can't promise that I'm going to live stream
2999000	3001000	Because I don't need you all messing with my game
3001000	3003000	But no, maybe I will
3003000	3005000	Maybe I will do something
3005000	3007000	I think that bomb game with everybody involved
3007000	3009000	Will be a lot of fun
3009000	3011000	Bomb Corp, will be a lot of fun to play with everybody
3011000	3013000	To register participation
3013000	3015000	For this week's episode of Orange On Radio
3015000	3017000	At vognetwork.com
3017000	3019000	Use the passphrase, bacon
3019000	3021000	Alright, we're going to move right back
3021000	3023000	Into the show
3023000	3025000	And start to get into some news
3025000	3027000	I'm going to talk about my own gaming week though
3027000	3029000	I didn't really get a chance to get to my gaming week
3029000	3031000	But I don't have a whole lot to add
3031000	3033000	Because I bought stuff, I bought Lego dimensions
3033000	3035000	But I haven't played it yet
3035000	3037000	So this week, what I've actually been playing
3037000	3039000	I've been playing an awful lot of Diablo 3
3039000	3041000	I finally passed Paragon level 200
3041000	3043000	For the season
3043000	3045000	That'll tell you how much I've been playing Diablo 3
3045000	3047000	But once I finish the set bonus
3047000	3049000	For my Demon Hunter, oh my gosh
3049000	3051000	I just mow things down
3051000	3053000	I've been having a lot of fun with that
3053000	3055000	I finally got around to playing
3055000	3057000	And if Cody is out there listening, or even Extover
3057000	3059000	They're going to be both so proud of me that I finally got around to this game
3059000	3061000	On the Xbox One
3061000	3063000	I finally played Ori and the Blind Forest
3063000	3065000	I picked that up in a sale
3065000	3067000	A couple months ago
3067000	3069000	Finally decided to sit down and play this game
3069000	3071000	And I've got to say
3071000	3073000	It's got a really moving intro
3073000	3075000	Just in the beginning
3075000	3077000	Just in the first 10 minutes of the game
3077000	3079000	I was like, oh god, it's going to be one of those types of games
3079000	3081000	That really kind of moves you with the story
3081000	3083000	Even though the narrator kept reminding me
3083000	3085000	Of one of the dragons in Final Fantasy 14
3085000	3087000	If you've played Heaven's Word
3087000	3089000	You'll know what I'm talking about
3089000	3091000	If you haven't, don't worry about it
3091000	3093000	It sounds like the narrator in Ori and the Blind Forest
3093000	3095000	Ori and the Blind Forest is a Metroidvania
3095000	3097000	To use that term
3097000	3099000	It's one of those types of games
3099000	3101000	It's obviously a different type of setting
3101000	3103000	And the character is very different
3103000	3105000	And the fact that you have this ability
3105000	3107000	Where you can kind of consistently jump up a wall
3107000	3109000	In the very beginning of the game
3109000	3111000	It's like one of the first abilities you get
3111000	3113000	Causes the level design to be very different
3113000	3115000	Because you have a lot of curvatures
3115000	3117000	And branches and nature
3117000	3119000	And other ways that kind of prevent you from just jumping
3119000	3121000	Up all the walls
3121000	3123000	So in that way it kind of makes the design of the game
3123000	3125000	A lot different from games I've seen before
3125000	3127000	And the art direction of the game
3127000	3129000	Is great
3129000	3131000	It's a beautiful game
3131000	3133000	And so yeah, I've got to say
3133000	3135000	I am really enjoying Ori and the Blind Forest
3135000	3137000	The one little drawback
3137000	3139000	Where I'm at so far
3139000	3141000	Is that the difficulty of the game goes up really fast
3141000	3143000	And you start getting into
3143000	3145000	If you think
3145000	3147000	Loki makes asshole Mario Maker levels
3147000	3149000	Wait until you play some of these things
3149000	3151000	In Ori and the Blind Forest
3151000	3153000	There's some really tough parts of the game
3153000	3155000	Granted, you can save your game
3155000	3157000	Essentially at any time
3157000	3159000	And I thought that was also an interesting mechanic
3159000	3161000	If you have enough energy
3161000	3163000	Which you collect from exploding plants
3163000	3165000	And inanimate objects
3165000	3167000	And monsters as you kill them as well
3167000	3169000	You get a little bit of energy
3169000	3171000	You can create a save point anywhere
3171000	3173000	So that makes getting through some of these excruciatingly difficult parts
3173000	3175000	A little bit easier
3175000	3177000	Unless of course you create your save portal
3177000	3179000	At a horrible place
3179000	3181000	But I really enjoyed
3181000	3183000	Ori and the Blind Forest
3183000	3185000	And I want to play more of it in this coming week
3185000	3187000	So that was pretty much my gaming week
3187000	3189000	Diablo 3 and Ori and the Blind Forest
3189000	3191000	Housekeeping tonight
3191000	3193000	We do not have any shows off planned
3193000	3195000	But remember
3195000	3197000	DarkSakura and I
3197000	3199000	Will be, we should start promoting this
3199000	3201000	DarkSakura and I will be at
3201000	3203000	GamerX or GX3 is what they're calling it
3203000	3205000	Because they want to make sure the message is out there
3205000	3207000	That everybody games
3207000	3209000	You don't have to be gay to enjoy GamerX
3209000	3211000	But it helps, no I'm just kidding
3211000	3213000	Everybody will enjoy it
3213000	3215000	No matter what
3215000	3217000	If you're a part of the quilt bag or you're not
3217000	3219000	You're going to have a good time there
3219000	3221000	We will be there
3222000	3224000	We have a panel that DarkSakura and I will be on
3224000	3226000	I'm actually moderating it
3226000	3228000	Podcast Cross Zone 3
3228000	3230000	Really excited about that
3230000	3232000	And I totally forget the time and the moment
3232000	3234000	I can't remember if it's Friday or Saturday night
3234000	3236000	But we are actually going to be there
3236000	3238000	And DarkSakura and I still have to figure out how this is even going to work
3238000	3240000	VOG Network, if you haven't heard
3240000	3242000	Is a sponsor of GX3
3242000	3244000	We helped pitch in for the Kickstarter
3244000	3246000	I've always been a fan
3246000	3248000	Of this concept
3248000	3250000	So we pitched in
3250000	3252000	For people somewhere at the convention
3252000	3254000	So this is, I believe
3254000	3256000	The first time
3256000	3258000	Maybe because Bobby has done some of those Atlanta meetups
3258000	3260000	But this is going to be the first time
3260000	3262000	We've actually had a table at a show
3262000	3264000	And you can come by and say hi
3264000	3266000	And we're going to figure out
3266000	3268000	I don't know if we're going to have a classic game available
3268000	3270000	Or if we're actually going to be recording bits
3270000	3272000	For use on air
3272000	3274000	Which I think is going to be a big part of what we're doing
3274000	3276000	We're working on a top secret project behind the scenes
3276000	3278000	So we're going to be doing a lot of interviews
3278000	3280000	And nerds alike
3280000	3282000	Getting their viewpoints
3282000	3284000	So we'll be there at GX3
3284000	3286000	That's in San Jose December 11th and 12th
3286000	3288000	That weekend
3288000	3290000	I also take bribery in the form of fan art of my characters
3290000	3292000	In Dragon Age
3292000	3294000	There you go
3294000	3296000	Bobby Blackwell says
3296000	3298000	We've never had a table
3298000	3300000	And using that in quotes
3300000	3302000	We've actually had to turn down tables out there
3302000	3304000	Because I'm only one person and don't want to be tied to a table
3304000	3306000	The good news is
3306000	3308000	We're going to have more people
3308000	3310000	I know myself and DarkSoccer are going to be there for sure
3310000	3312000	And we might enlist the help of some of our friends
3312000	3314000	To help us man the table
3314000	3316000	Or we'll man the table
3316000	3318000	Or whatever the table when we're not there
3318000	3320000	So we'll work on it
3320000	3322000	Anyhow, that's all I have to announce
3322000	3324000	We are ready to get into some news
3324000	3326000	So let's start it off
3326000	3328000	With what's going on in the gaming world this week
3328000	3330000	Loki
3330000	3332000	So Microsoft has purchased Havoc Physics
3332000	3334000	The middleware
3334000	3336000	For calculating physics and animation
3336000	3338000	From Intel and they've used it on a bunch of their games
3338000	3340000	So what's this mean?
3340000	3342000	Don't know yet
3342000	3344000	But I know that one of the big games that uses that
3344000	3346000	That's coming up soon will be Crackdown 3
3346000	3348000	And of course they've used it recently
3348000	3350000	In Destiny, Dragon Age
3350000	3352000	Inquisition, Call of Duty, Advanced Warfare
3352000	3354000	A lot of the major games end up using that
3354000	3356000	And
3356000	3358000	Basically they've
3358000	3360000	Asserted that they're going to continue to innovate
3360000	3362000	For the benefit of the
3362000	3364000	Development partners and part of this innovation
3364000	3366000	Will include building more complex
3366000	3368000	More complete
3368000	3370000	Cloud service
3370000	3372000	Which they're kind of demonstrating
3372000	3374000	With Crackdown 3
3374000	3376000	Having everything fully destructible
3376000	3378000	So
3378000	3380000	Is this going to create interesting scenarios
3380000	3382000	Where the Havoc Engine might be used
3382000	3384000	On a Playstation game and I know I've seen that happen
3384000	3386000	Before
3386000	3388000	I don't know if they're going to lock it down to just one
3388000	3390000	Platform and stuff, I think it's just another revenue
3390000	3392000	Source for them
3392000	3394000	Maybe more of a thing to kind of
3394000	3396000	Sell their servers
3396000	3398000	And stuff like that
3398000	3400000	I don't know
3400000	3402000	I hope not
3402000	3404000	That would be kind of dickish
3404000	3406000	Tigerclaw in chat says
3406000	3408000	Havoc has been in a lot of games
3408000	3410000	That we played
3410000	3412000	Havoc is out there a lot
3412000	3414000	I think if they did lock it down that there would probably
3414000	3416000	Be an alternative that would come about
3416000	3418000	Gotcha
3418000	3420000	That's true
3420000	3422000	Somebody will inevitably
3422000	3424000	Copy it I suppose
3424000	3426000	Just like all those Minecraft clones
3426000	3428000	Except Minecraft still exists on so many platforms
3428000	3430000	And they're still supporting it
3430000	3432000	Just because Microsoft owns it
3432000	3434000	Doesn't mean they'll cut off support completely
3434000	3436000	They know where the money is
3436000	3438000	As many platforms as possible
3438000	3440000	What meme in our chat is saying
3440000	3442000	Gotta say Xbox is killing it
3442000	3444000	Since Phil Spencer took over
3444000	3446000	You know I agree
3446000	3448000	I totally do
3448000	3450000	I don't know if I would go so far as to say killing it
3450000	3452000	But definitely like
3452000	3454000	Turn that shit around
3454000	3456000	Would be maybe the phrase I would use
3456000	3458000	Because I'm sorry
3458000	3460000	But it was not going well under
3460000	3462000	Don Mattrick and I'm sure he's a fine person
3462000	3464000	And I hope I don't miss out on a potential
3464000	3466000	Coffee date someday because of my big mouth
3466000	3468000	But I'm just saying
3468000	3470000	All that razz on the
3470000	3472000	Xbox one
3472000	3474000	Was under his leadership
3474000	3476000	But yeah when Phil Spencer took over
3476000	3478000	Focusing on the positive
3478000	3480000	You know you really sense that turn around
3480000	3482000	And one thing I really enjoy about Phil Spencer
3482000	3484000	Is that he kind of admits
3484000	3486000	About the competition, you get the sense
3486000	3488000	From Phil Spencer that he plays games
3488000	3490000	Like he is a gamer
3490000	3492000	He plays games, okay yeah he's a business guy too
3492000	3494000	But like he'll acknowledge like yeah
3494000	3496000	Sony, Nintendo, doing good stuff
3496000	3498000	You know we're trying to offer our own stuff
3498000	3500000	Over here that we think is really good
3500000	3502000	Each generation has their kind of fails
3502000	3504000	I mean there's PlayStation 3 kind of
3504000	3506000	Botched the launch
3506000	3508000	You know Xbox One
3508000	3510000	Sort of botched the launch at first
3510000	3512000	But so did PlayStation 3
3512000	3514000	PlayStation 3 as I mentioned
3514000	3516000	And then Wii U
3516000	3518000	That's true
3518000	3520000	Everybody gets their turn at the fuck up table
3520000	3522000	But everybody
3522000	3524000	Does awesome things too
3524000	3526000	As much as we razz the companies
3526000	3528000	When they do things not so well
3528000	3530000	Things should get called out when they're done well too
3530000	3532000	Even with Wii U
3532000	3534000	I know a lot of Nintendo fanboys would fight me
3534000	3536000	And with good reasons because there are
3536000	3538000	A lot of great
3538000	3540000	Exclusive experiences on Wii U
3540000	3542000	And in fact I was just asked the other day
3542000	3544000	About what console should I get
3544000	3546000	And I said did you consider Wii U
3546000	3548000	Did you give it some serious consideration
3548000	3550000	Because you know there's some great games on it
3550000	3552000	And maybe you'll decide well it doesn't have Call of Duty
3552000	3554000	So I don't really want it
3554000	3556000	But you know you gotta at least consider it at this point
3556000	3558000	So anyway sorry we went on a tangent
3558000	3560000	Here over at live.vognetwork.com
3562000	3564000	Anyhow let's move on to another story
3564000	3566000	Speaking of Wii U I swear this was not all set up
3566000	3568000	For a transition but
3568000	3570000	Splatoon of course being one of those games
3570000	3572000	That are really swinging the people over to the Wii U
3572000	3574000	And apparently Splatoon has been hacked
3574000	3576000	Because you know what they say
3576000	3578000	Because the hacker's gonna hack
3578000	3580000	Hack hack hack
3580000	3582000	Well apparently a Splatoon hacker
3582000	3584000	Was online and can like
3584000	3586000	Screw up your save file
3586000	3588000	If your character won't load up when you're going
3588000	3590000	In the main plaza
3590000	3592000	And I guess it's like an
3592000	3594000	Octoling that will carry
3594000	3596000	The Hydra Splatling
3596000	3598000	So obviously it's a hacker because the thing hasn't released
3598000	3600000	Yet and what happens to get
3600000	3602000	Around this don't leave the room until
3602000	3604000	They're gone because returning
3604000	3606000	Back to the base is what screws up the save
3606000	3608000	File and there's a character in the game
3608000	3610000	Whose name is K and it has numbers in it
3610000	3612000	But nobody's gotten the full name
3612000	3614000	But you worry that something like this is
3614000	3616000	Probably spread around
3616000	3618000	Pretty quickly so
3618000	3620000	Be careful
3620000	3622000	Some folks actually found out that it's kinda
3622000	3624000	Easy to play as an Octoling in
3624000	3626000	Online matches
3626000	3628000	There's a whole YouTube video that walks you through
3628000	3630000	It that you do a text modification to the player
3630000	3632000	ID in the save file
3632000	3634000	I'm obviously not gonna get into the details here
3634000	3636000	I'm just gonna say it's out there
3636000	3638000	But I guess this is all gonna be
3638000	3640000	Patched by the time the next Splatfest
3640000	3642000	Comes out because that's when they'll do an update to the game
3642000	3644000	And certainly this is gonna get
3644000	3646000	This is gonna get sewed right up
3646000	3648000	So that doesn't happen anymore
3648000	3650000	By the way the theme has been announced for the next Splatfest
3650000	3652000	Friday October 9th
3652000	3654000	At 9pm for 24 hours
3654000	3656000	It will be
3656000	3658000	Planes versus
3658000	3660000	Cars
3660000	3662000	Do you prefer to travel by plane
3662000	3664000	Or do you prefer to travel by car
3664000	3666000	I think it should be three teams
3666000	3668000	Planes, trains and automobiles
3668000	3670000	There you go there's no team train
3670000	3672000	Japan always does things differently
3672000	3674000	Maybe they'll have team train
3674000	3676000	Or Europe will get something else
3676000	3678000	But anyway I'm gonna be team plane
3678000	3680000	Just because
3680000	3682000	I like car trips too but you know
3682000	3684000	Planes take me to places like Hawaii
3684000	3686000	That the car doesn't get me to so
3686000	3688000	I'm gonna be team plane for that one
3688000	3690000	Just in case you wanna be playing with me
3690000	3692000	But keep in mind Rob you have to take the car to get to the plane
3692000	3694000	That is true
3694000	3696000	Well you could take transit you could take a train to get to the plane
3696000	3698000	But you could also take a bus
3698000	3700000	You could
3700000	3702000	Or a van
3702000	3704000	You could take the train to the plane that will take you to the rain in Spain
3704000	3706000	The automobile is more versatile
3706000	3708000	I would go with the automobile
3708000	3710000	Yes but they don't serve you alcoholic
3710000	3712000	Beverages in the automobile
3712000	3714000	In fact it's against the law
3714000	3716000	They don't know what I'm doing in the backseat
3716000	3718000	That's not true though
3718000	3720000	In limos they do serve you
3720000	3722000	Hell yeah
3722000	3724000	Yeah but it's not team limo
3724000	3726000	Limo is a type of car so
3726000	3728000	Whatever whatever alright
3728000	3730000	Let's move on Dark Soccer what do you have for us
3730000	3732000	I have some crap
3732000	3734000	Anyway
3734000	3736000	We all like our humble bundles don't we
3736000	3738000	And now we have the
3738000	3740000	Humble Monthly Bundle
3740000	3742000	Woo
3742000	3744000	So they are doing a
3744000	3746000	And I'm quoting a highly curated bundle
3746000	3748000	Of favorite games once a month
3748000	3750000	It's gonna be
3750000	3752000	The Humble Monthly Bundle costs 12 bucks a month
3752000	3754000	And it will show games
3754000	3756000	That have been in the various weekly ones
3756000	3758000	And some that haven't been featured
3758000	3760000	And of course 5% of the subscription
3760000	3762000	Goes to charity
3762000	3764000	So like right now
3764000	3766000	We have Legend of Grimrock 2
3766000	3768000	In there right now
3768000	3770000	You can just go to
3770000	3772000	HumbleBundle.com
3772000	3774000	monthly and have a look at it
3774000	3776000	I guess it shouldn't be too surprising
3776000	3778000	That you know with the Loot Crate
3778000	3780000	What the Dollar Shave
3780000	3782000	Club There's a Pusheen one now
3782000	3784000	Oh for Loot Crate
3784000	3786000	No not well Loot Crate
3786000	3788000	But it's a Pusheen
3788000	3790000	Oh like a Pusheen of the Month Club
3790000	3792000	I remember when the Blank of the Month Club
3792000	3794000	Was something that you would read about
3794000	3796000	Speaking of planes like in SkyMall Magazine
3796000	3798000	Or like just something they would
3798000	3800000	Advertise on TV or the
3800000	3802000	Columbia House get 12 CDs
3802000	3804000	For a dollar and then they're gonna send
3804000	3806000	You the CDs of the month and if you don't like them
3806000	3808000	Send it back like it seems like that whole thing is
3808000	3810000	Back like big time like it
3810000	3812000	If I could send the games back
3812000	3814000	You'd get different games because a lot of them I probably already have
3814000	3816000	Yeah that's the one problem with Humble Bundle
3816000	3818000	But when you consider your charity
3818000	3820000	There's always a good element of it too
3820000	3822000	To throw in there
3822000	3824000	Feel like you're doing a little bit of good with the games
3824000	3826000	I don't know I'll have to look into it
3826000	3828000	I might actually jump on this
3828000	3830000	Might be a good way to force myself to play some games
3830000	3832000	That I wouldn't usually play
3832000	3834000	Let's travel around the world and check out some
3834000	3836000	Release dates some things that we'll be playing
3836000	3838000	A little sooner than
3838000	3840000	Perhaps what is coming up in the Humble Bundle next month
3840000	3842000	Starting in the US
3842000	3844000	Loki
3844000	3846000	Alright so starting off we've got
3846000	3848000	Dragon Age Inquisition Game of the Year edition
3848000	3850000	Yes the one on the DLC
3850000	3852000	I'll get another one
3852000	3854000	That's on Playstation 4 and Xbox One
3854000	3856000	Here's your chance to get it on another platform
3856000	3858000	That could be that's what I do
3858000	3860000	No because I can't mod other platforms
3860000	3862000	Disgaea 5
3862000	3864000	Alliance of Vengeance on Playstation 4
3864000	3866000	Dengeki
3866000	3868000	Bunko Fighting Climax
3868000	3870000	On Playstation 3 and Vita
3870000	3872000	Did you say Bunko Fighting Climax
3872000	3874000	Yeah Dengeki Bunko
3874000	3876000	Bunk that's the game my mom would play
3876000	3878000	That's with a C not a K
3878000	3882000	I'm like how do you do Bunko Fighting?
3882000	3886000	Do the dice get up and attack each other?
3886000	3890000	That's what I saw in my mind
3890000	3892000	Bunko Fighters
3892000	3894000	Grandma's gonna throw down
3894000	3896000	Cause she didn't get the roll she wanted
3898000	3900000	Sorry Loki
3900000	3902000	There's a little known game called Rock Band 4
3902000	3904000	That's coming out this week as well
3904000	3906000	On Playstation 4 and Xbox One
3906000	3908000	And if you want to get it with some instruments
3908000	3910000	They have all those available for you as well
3910000	3912000	Transformers Devastation
3912000	3914000	The Platinum Games
3914000	3916000	Transformers
3916000	3918000	That's coming out on Playstation 4
3918000	3920000	And Xbox One as well
3920000	3922000	Ride on Playstation 4
3922000	3926000	I guess Devastation is also on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360
3926000	3928000	Farming Simulator 16 on Vita
3928000	3930000	I thought I've seen that before but I guess
3930000	3932000	It's been delayed again
3932000	3934000	Gotta wait for that
3934000	3936000	Man
3936000	3938000	As if we're not in the fourth quarter already
3938000	3940000	Alright
3940000	3942000	And then the next thing I've got
3942000	3944000	Let's see
3944000	3946000	Brace yourself winter is coming
3946000	3948000	And then finally on
3948000	3950000	I guess this is Sunday or Friday
3950000	3952000	Chibi Robo Ziplash on 3DS
3952000	3954000	I think it's the one with the amiibo
3954000	3956000	Oh yes they have one with an amiibo
3956000	3960000	And then Uncharted the Nathan Drake collection on Playstation 4 is coming
3960000	3964000	And Sid Meier's Civilization Beyond Earth Rising Tide
3964000	3966000	So that's an expansion for an expansion
3966000	3968000	Oh no it's an expansion for the new game
3968000	3970000	That's right
3970000	3972000	And that's it
3972000	3974000	Alright
3974000	3976000	By the way in chat over at live.vognetware.com
3976000	3978000	Dark Tetsuya says Bunko Fighters
3978000	3980000	Is that another dream game?
3980000	3982000	Nah I don't think we could
3982000	3984000	Officially put it on the dream game list
3984000	3986000	But if like YYR hears this
3986000	3988000	And like that's my next game
3988000	3990000	I'm not gonna complain
3990000	3992000	So I'm just saying
3992000	3994000	Alright anyway
3994000	3996000	Let's travel to Japan and look at the Playstation 4
3996000	3998000	Where this week FIFA 16
3998000	4000000	Gets its release in regular and deluxe edition
4000000	4002000	On October the 8th
4002000	4004000	Also Grand Theft Auto 5 gets a price reduction
4004000	4006000	It moves into the best hit series
4006000	4008000	And the Uncharted collection is out this week
4008000	4010000	In Japan as well
4010000	4012000	Moving over to the Wii U
4012000	4014000	Nada
4014000	4016000	In fact their next release
4016000	4018000	I don't think they have anything until November actually
4018000	4020000	In Japan
4020000	4022000	For the Wii U so you might not be reading those dates
4022000	4024000	For a while
4024000	4026000	But on the Playstation Vita
4026000	4028000	Actually this is the first week in a while we don't have anything on the Vita
4028000	4030000	We have a
4030000	4032000	Neptune vs. Zombie Gundam
4032000	4034000	Gekkei Jigen Tag Blank
4034000	4036000	comes out next week
4036000	4038000	But that's on the 15th
4038000	4040000	So this is finally a quiet week on the Vita in Japan
4040000	4042000	Could that be because
4042000	4044000	They're expecting a big reception to
4044000	4046000	Guru Guru Chibi Robo
4046000	4048000	In regular and amiibo set over in Japan
4048000	4050000	That is releasing on October the 8th as well
4050000	4052000	I hear this is gonna be the last Chibi Robo game they do
4052000	4054000	Well if it sells well
4054000	4056000	Then of course they'll do another one
4056000	4058000	I think they kind of made that
4058000	4060000	I don't wanna say a threat but it was a threat
4060000	4062000	Like on Twitter like you know
4062000	4064000	Well if it doesn't sell well
4064000	4066000	I'm kind of fine with that
4066000	4068000	Anyway also on the 3DS
4068000	4070000	A price reduction for Simogami Tensei 4
4070000	4072000	As it moves into the Atlas Best collection
4072000	4074000	So that is what you have to look forward to
4074000	4076000	In Japan this week
4076000	4078000	Let's go over to the UK
4078000	4080000	With Dark Sakura
4080000	4082000	On October 6th we have Prison Architect
4082000	4084000	For Mac and for PC
4084000	4086000	Blackband 4 comes out on
4086000	4088000	Xbox One and Playstation 4
4088000	4090000	Skyhill comes out on Mac and PC
4090000	4092000	And then on October 8th
4092000	4094000	We have Bridge Constructor Stunts
4094000	4096000	For Android
4096000	4098000	That's it
4098000	4100000	Alright just a few more stories for you guys
4100000	4102000	And then the classic game of the week
4102000	4104000	Loki?
4104000	4106000	Alright I'm surprised well
4106000	4108000	Bridge Constructor that's kind of what people do in that
4108000	4110000	Anyways it just makes stunts so I'm surprised it took them this long
4110000	4112000	To actually release something like that
4112000	4114000	Criterion
4114000	4116000	They're working on
4116000	4118000	Possibly a successor to Burnout
4118000	4120000	And that makes me happy
4120000	4122000	Because I want more Burnout
4122000	4124000	And this is coming from a Twitter conversation
4124000	4126000	They're saying you know
4126000	4128000	What they're working on
4128000	4130000	Two things first the game is a multiplayer sports game
4130000	4132000	Coming spring of 2016
4132000	4134000	Which I remember that's that like
4134000	4136000	I think there's like an off-road
4136000	4138000	Racing sports thing
4138000	4140000	That they've got coming
4140000	4142000	And then the other one
4142000	4144000	It says then we make a driving game
4144000	4146000	What sort of driving game you ask?
4146000	4148000	A spiritual successor
4148000	4150000	Speed traffic and crashing lots and lots
4150000	4152000	Of crashing
4152000	4154000	Yes please
4154000	4156000	That's what I need in my Burnout
4156000	4158000	Game is just big fiery
4158000	4160000	Car crashes
4160000	4162000	I don't understand why no one would fund
4162000	4164000	Or like
4164000	4166000	Put money towards another Burnout game
4166000	4168000	I mean come on
4168000	4170000	How well of these Need for Speed games have done
4170000	4172000	Not very good
4172000	4174000	I bet if they went to Kickstarter they'd get it
4174000	4176000	If it was like fucking Burnout and said Need for Speed
4176000	4178000	Way better
4178000	4180000	Alright
4180000	4182000	Speaking of crowdfunding
4182000	4184000	Maybe Criterion
4184000	4186000	And those employees aren't doing this
4186000	4188000	But Cave is thinking about it
4188000	4190000	You want some shooters on the Playstation 4
4190000	4192000	Some more shooters
4192000	4194000	Cave is thinking about
4194000	4196000	Getting some crowdfunding
4196000	4198000	They're asking on Facebook
4198000	4200000	Could we get $300,000 to $500,000
4200000	4202000	To do
4202000	4204000	Actually that's the Steam port
4204000	4206000	But a million would allow them to do a Playstation 4 port
4206000	4208000	And they're saying for 3 million
4208000	4210000	They'll do a new game as well
4210000	4212000	To a console
4212000	4214000	So I don't know
4214000	4216000	That seems like an awful lot of money
4216000	4218000	But then again
4218000	4220000	If they're selling it for $20 a pop
4220000	4222000	They would have to get what
4222000	4224000	15,000 people
4224000	4226000	To get on board
4226000	4228000	That's a lot of money for
4228000	4230000	I don't know
4230000	4232000	I can't imagine an arcade game
4232000	4234000	Having that kind of budget
4234000	4236000	It would depend
4236000	4238000	On
4238000	4240000	It's also like how into
4240000	4242000	These types of games are you
4242000	4244000	Maybe we say that we dismiss it
4244000	4246000	Because we're not super into shooters
4246000	4248000	But you know some people really love their bullet hell games
4248000	4250000	I'm not even thinking necessarily the genre
4250000	4252000	I'm just thinking of how complex of a game it is
4252000	4254000	I mean yeah I understand there's bullet patterns
4254000	4256000	And all that stuff but really how much
4256000	4258000	How many art assets are you talking there
4258000	4260000	I mean the level design
4260000	4262000	I just don't see that as being a very in depth
4262000	4264000	Game that would require 3 million
4264000	4266000	Dollars to
4266000	4268000	Make another one of
4268000	4270000	I mean I just don't know
4270000	4272000	Well that's fair
4272000	4274000	Well we are going to take a trip down memory lane
4274000	4276000	With Dark Sakura
4276000	4278000	And Dark Sakura is going to step into the gaming vault
4278000	4280000	And find a game that she thinks
4280000	4282000	You kids should check out this game this week
4282000	4284000	It is the classic game
4284000	4286000	Of the week with Dark
4286000	4288000	Sakura
4288000	4290000	I think this is kind of an
4290000	4292000	Obscure pick this week but I don't know that's just me
4292000	4294000	It was one of my favorites that I had
4294000	4296000	Alright so what is the classic
4296000	4298000	Game of the week this week?
4298000	4300000	The game is SNK Gals Fighter
4300000	4302000	It was a one on one
4302000	4304000	Fighting game that
4304000	4306000	Came out on the Neo Geo Pocket Color
4306000	4308000	In 2000
4308000	4310000	I played the stew out of this game
4310000	4312000	Just because I really liked it and it was really funny
4312000	4314000	So this was for the
4314000	4316000	Queen of Fighters tournament
4316000	4318000	That was organized by a Miss X
4318000	4320000	Who is really
4320000	4322000	Yori Yagami dressed up in drag
4322000	4324000	So that they could
4324000	4326000	Win the K talisman that grants any
4326000	4328000	Wish so
4328000	4330000	It's really just like a little
4330000	4332000	Sd fighter it's really cute
4332000	4334000	And it's very similar to how
4334000	4336000	The King of Fighters
4336000	4338000	R1 and R2 played but a little bit faster
4338000	4340000	So it was
4340000	4342000	Honestly like I said one of my
4342000	4344000	Favorite games ever that came out on
4344000	4346000	The Neo Geo Pocket Color
4346000	4348000	You could play as
4348000	4350000	Mai Shiranui from
4350000	4352000	Fatal Fury 2
4352000	4354000	You had Athena from Psycho Soldier
4354000	4356000	Yuri from Art of Fighting 2
4356000	4358000	Leona from King of Fighters 96
4358000	4360000	Shirmi from King of Fighters 97
4360000	4362000	Also the namesake of my cat
4362000	4364000	Nakoru from Samurai
4364000	4366000	Shiki from
4366000	4368000	Samurai Shodown 64
4368000	4370000	And Akari from The Last Blade
4370000	4372000	You also had hidden characters
4372000	4374000	You had Whip and you had
4374000	4376000	Yuki Kushinata who was
4376000	4378000	Kyo's girlfriend
4378000	4380000	In King of Fighters 97 and it's the only fighting
4380000	4382000	Game she's actually been playable in
4382000	4384000	And of course your boss is Miss X
4384000	4386000	Who is Yori from
4386000	4388000	King of Fighters
4388000	4390000	So it was
4390000	4392000	I mean
4392000	4394000	There's not really so much to say about it
4394000	4396000	It is really just a
4396000	4398000	A little fighting game
4398000	4400000	But a lot of the little stuff
4400000	4402000	The you know attacks
4402000	4404000	In it were really just made comical
4404000	4406000	You uh
4408000	4410000	For a chibi pocket version
4410000	4412000	Of the game cause you know a lot of the pocket
4412000	4414000	Versions of fighting games were straight up
4414000	4416000	Bad like if you played Mortal Kombat
4416000	4418000	On the original Game Boy it's really
4418000	4420000	Bad but this
4420000	4422000	You know again I haven't played this
4422000	4424000	But this looks like okay
4424000	4426000	It's a chibi cartoony like you know
4426000	4428000	Amped up silly I guess
4428000	4430000	Version of the game but it looks
4430000	4432000	Surprisingly fluid for a pocket game
4432000	4434000	Oh yeah it was really good
4434000	4436000	I mean it was surprisingly good
4436000	4438000	And you know
4438000	4440000	Even with the limitations
4440000	4442000	Of the system at the time it was
4442000	4444000	Very solid I played
4444000	4446000	I probably played through this game for
4446000	4448000	Until I beat it with everybody
4448000	4450000	And I always forget that
4450000	4452000	Athena in this game is the same Athena
4452000	4454000	From the NES game
4454000	4456000	It's like a soldier
4456000	4458000	Crazy
4458000	4460000	There it is
4460000	4462000	And that's actually the outfit
4462000	4464000	That she's wearing in that one
4464000	4466000	Is her King of Fighters 99 outfit
4466000	4468000	So there you go
4468000	4470000	That's all I have to say
4470000	4472000	This is the only version of this game ever that's been out
4472000	4474000	And it's just
4474000	4476000	Really cute and very funny
4476000	4478000	So you get
4478000	4480000	You know little cameos
4480000	4482000	From some of the other characters of course
4482000	4484000	From the various SNK series
4484000	4486000	In endings and backgrounds
4486000	4488000	And whatnot
4488000	4490000	Well you know sometimes she picks
4490000	4492000	A mainstream game but sometimes she picks
4492000	4494000	A more obscure game that hey maybe you hadn't
4494000	4496000	Heard of this and considering it was only on the Neo Geo Pocket
4496000	4498000	Color I'm going to assume a lot of people
4498000	4500000	Probably never heard of this so there it is
4500000	4502000	SNK Gals Fighters
4502000	4504000	I didn't even know about this game
4504000	4506000	I love that she just drew a picture and now she's singing
4506000	4508000	Karaoke as one of her moves
4508000	4510000	Yeah if you want to borrow it
4510000	4512000	Did Leona just strap dynamite to her?
4512000	4514000	Wow
4514000	4516000	She has the earring bomb but they changed it for the game
4516000	4518000	For this one
4518000	4520000	So it's just really cute
4520000	4522000	It's kind of fun
4522000	4524000	If you're interested in borrowing it I would be more than happy
4524000	4526000	To lend you a Neo Geo Pocket Color in the game
4526000	4528000	Sweet
4528000	4530000	Bring your own batteries
4530000	4532000	I like dark soccer she gives me stuff
4532000	4534000	Which I still need to bring over some of my
4534000	4536000	Super Famicom, not my Super but my
4536000	4538000	Actually I do have a few Super Famicom cartridges
4538000	4540000	And my Famicom cartridges
4540000	4542000	I don't even think I talked yet on the show
4542000	4544000	About what I bought, no that's okay
4544000	4546000	Because we'll talk about that at the start of part B
4546000	4548000	Let that be our teaser
4548000	4550000	I have a few
4550000	4552000	We are going to take a break and we'll talk about that
4552000	4554000	We're going to talk about the FUGL Question of the Week
4554000	4556000	Which has to do with multiplayer games
4556000	4558000	Since we had Jackbox on tonight and they really
4558000	4560000	Excel at doing those multiplayer games
4560000	4562000	Thought we would have a question about that tonight
4562000	4564000	So we're going to talk that with you guys
4564000	4566000	Your phone calls and 1877 game OLR
4566000	4568000	And emails which I think
4568000	4570000	There's quite a few emails tonight
4570000	4572000	Dark soccer is going to be busy during the email segment
4572000	4574000	Yay! So we'll get to all that
4574000	4576000	When we come back after this break with more
4576000	4578000	Of Orange Lounge Radio right after this
4584000	4586000	Welcome back everybody
4586000	4588000	To Orange Lounge Radio
4588000	4590000	We are live tonight with our
4590000	4592000	616th episode, it's the second half
4592000	4594000	For this October the 4th
4594000	4596000	Of 2015 and I
4596000	4598000	Can't believe it's already October
4598000	4600000	Where's this year gone? And 616?
4600000	4602000	Didn't we just celebrate episode 600?
4602000	4604000	Oh my gosh where'd this year go
4604000	4606000	At least the good news is now that it's
4606000	4608000	October it is officially time
4608000	4610000	For Pumpkin All the Things
4610000	4612000	And I'm very excited about the Pumpkin All the Things
4612000	4614000	Time of year
4614000	4616000	You know I got my pumpkin spice latte
4616000	4618000	I love all of them actually
4618000	4620000	I had those pumpkin latte M&M's they were great
4620000	4622000	You know what else is also a good season for?
4622000	4624000	If you happen to like that kind of thing
4624000	4626000	Root vegetables
4626000	4628000	Oh because this is the time of year where a lot of those
4628000	4630000	Are in season and so forth
4630000	4632000	Which pumpkin kind of is
4632000	4634000	Well we have an amazing cafe at work
4634000	4636000	And I'll just leave it here
4636000	4638000	I've been having some stomach problems so I haven't been able to
4638000	4640000	Eat a lot of heavy crazy foods
4640000	4642000	They had one that was like rutabaga
4642000	4644000	And beets and parsnips and carrots
4644000	4646000	And everything and I am enjoying
4646000	4648000	Carrot ginger soup
4648000	4650000	Yeah ginger is amazing
4650000	4652000	It's a great spice
4652000	4654000	I feel weird calling it a spice but you know it's a great flavor
4654000	4656000	Well it's also really good if you
4656000	4658000	Have stomach problems
4658000	4660000	I love ginger beer and you can't get it
4660000	4662000	At every store but like
4662000	4664000	Bathmo
4664000	4666000	Oh my god I have to tell you
4666000	4668000	This is completely off topic
4668000	4670000	That's okay we do that here at OLR and you the most
4670000	4672000	They're opening a total wine by my house
4672000	4674000	Total wine gets frivolous
4674000	4676000	Oh so you're going to be a total lush
4676000	4678000	Yep and I will get you ginger beer
4678000	4680000	When I go get my frivolous
4680000	4682000	My favorite is that there is a total wine
4682000	4684000	It's over by for you SAC people which is I know
4684000	4686000	A very small percentage of our audience
4686000	4688000	There's a big mall there's a total wine
4688000	4690000	Not far from there but the hilarious
4690000	4692000	Thing on the back side of
4692000	4694000	The plaza the side that's by Chick-fil-A
4694000	4696000	For those that happen to know the area
4696000	4698000	No it says
4698000	4700000	On the sign still circuit city
4700000	4702000	How long
4702000	4704000	Has circuit city been gone
4704000	4706000	And it's still on the sign
4706000	4708000	Where total wine is
4708000	4710000	That's the building they converted
4710000	4712000	Oh my gosh drives me crazy
4712000	4714000	It's still in the shape of the big plug
4714000	4716000	Who remembers the commercials
4716000	4718000	That was always the cool part of the store
4718000	4720000	But that one is the one they use for the Halloween
4720000	4722000	Store right they rent out that building once in a while
4722000	4724000	I think so and it was also like stupid
4724000	4726000	Prices or something I don't know
4726000	4728000	It's called stupid prices
4728000	4730000	It's a recent history
4730000	4732000	We're local there it is
4732000	4734000	Once in a while I'll get those tweets
4734000	4736000	That are like it's so weird to hear about
4736000	4738000	Local things on OLR I forget they're in my neighborhood
4738000	4740000	That actually happened to me on Tumblr by the way
4740000	4742000	I was posting I was like
4742000	4744000	Yeah we got like 10 minutes of rain
4744000	4746000	You know it was a few days ago and
4746000	4748000	I was like I wish we had more and then I tagged
4748000	4750000	At Sacramento and one of
4750000	4752000	The people who follows me is like oh my god
4752000	4754000	I live in Santa Clara
4754000	4756000	Yeah and I can speak Bay Area too
4756000	4758000	That's the good news there's a lot of people there
4758000	4760000	I met my friend Brian the pagan
4760000	4762000	Jew on
4762000	4764000	Hi Free Looking Brian
4764000	4766000	But you know that's how I met my friend that way
4766000	4768000	And he and his husband
4768000	4770000	Razi
4770000	4772000	But I feel fortunate through OLR
4772000	4774000	If we can have a cheesy moment for a minute
4774000	4776000	I feel fortunate through OLR that I do feel like
4776000	4778000	I know people
4778000	4780000	And I have acquaintances if not friends
4780000	4782000	Like in almost every major
4782000	4784000	City in America because
4784000	4786000	Of you know Twitter
4786000	4788000	Podcasting and things that have happened
4788000	4790000	Because of this show and I'm so thankful for that
4790000	4792000	Anyway not to get too warm and fuzzy
4792000	4794000	But it's just a reality it's how I feel
4794000	4796000	I can't help the feels
4796000	4798000	Let's land back into reality for a minute
4798000	4800000	Here though because at the end of part A
4800000	4802000	Dark Soccer was teasing this about Loaning Me
4802000	4804000	Games so I suppose it's time we talk
4804000	4806000	About another big purchase I made today
4806000	4808000	I was really I needed retail
4808000	4810000	I didn't need retail therapy but it's one of those things that you don't
4810000	4812000	Realize you need it until you're doing it
4812000	4814000	I bought a Retron 5 today
4814000	4816000	And I've been talking about doing that
4816000	4818000	For a while
4818000	4820000	But I finally did it today
4820000	4822000	And I did it because
4822000	4824000	Well the Retron 5 will play the NES
4824000	4826000	The Super Nintendo, the GBA
4826000	4828000	Famicom and
4828000	4830000	Genesis, did I say Genesis?
4830000	4832000	But those are the five
4832000	4834000	Systems it does, sadly it will not do Neo Geo
4834000	4836000	Pocket Color
4836000	4838000	It also will not do like
4838000	4840000	Super Game Boy and add on games
4840000	4842000	So because I do recall reading a review
4842000	4844000	Where it won't do Sonic and Knuckles
4844000	4846000	Interesting
4846000	4848000	Like any of the add on type games
4848000	4850000	Well that's okay and part of the reason I did it
4850000	4852000	And I know there's mixed reviews on
4852000	4854000	Retron I know I'm going into it with that
4854000	4856000	But the HDMI support
4856000	4858000	I think is pretty cool and
4858000	4860000	Will help me a lot in streaming
4860000	4862000	Wink wink nudge nudge
4862000	4864000	So that was you know and the price is actually
4864000	4866000	Cheaper where I got it than it was on Amazon
4866000	4868000	And how often do you see that so
4868000	4870000	Yeah and Tigerclaw on chat
4870000	4872000	Even saying you need to do some games
4872000	4874000	For the Retron 5 on Twitch and that's the plan
4874000	4876000	And SSJ with that same comment
4876000	4878000	About the add on games
4878000	4880000	So yeah
4880000	4882000	There you go
4882000	4884000	And AkumaJP is reminding me
4884000	4886000	Not to mention international in regards to
4886000	4888000	Our audience, that's true
4888000	4890000	Like I actually
4890000	4892000	AkumaJP I feel fortunate that if I went to
4892000	4894000	Japan some day
4894000	4896000	He could help me out in some of the culture shock
4896000	4898000	And getting to different places I needed to go
4898000	4900000	Same thing if I were to ever
4900000	4902000	Go overseas into what we've
4902000	4904000	Affectionately called on the other show
4904000	4906000	Hoard House, Londonland or not
4906000	4908000	Londonland
4908000	4910000	With Raven and EJ
4910000	4912000	On Girls Gone Wow
4912000	4914000	And Syl from the Geek Card
4914000	4916000	And Razorbug and Robface and all the
4916000	4918000	People I know over there it's like
4918000	4920000	And Pika Uno could totally take me to Disneyland
4920000	4922000	Although I hope they didn't
4922000	4924000	Up the prices at Disney Paris
4924000	4926000	Like they did here in the US
4926000	4928000	Recently because that sucked
4928000	4930000	The prices at Disneyland went up today
4930000	4932000	Did you hear about that Dark Sakura?
4932000	4934000	There is no longer a premium pass at Disneyland
4934000	4936000	Well Dan and I actually had a
4936000	4938000	Conversation about it
4938000	4940000	Well prepare to pay a lot more money
4940000	4942000	If you're gonna get the passes
4942000	4944000	Well part of the reason though is that the passes are probably cheap
4944000	4946000	When the parks weren't getting a lot of attention
4946000	4948000	Now that you know the Disney parks
4948000	4950000	Are crazy popular
4950000	4952000	They can
4952000	4954000	I've heard that this is a move to
4954000	4956000	Weed out the crowds
4956000	4958000	That's what we were saying
4958000	4960000	You would think wouldn't Disney want the crowds
4960000	4962000	But yes of course they do
4962000	4964000	But to a certain limit
4964000	4966000	And I think Disney has kind of hit that limit
4966000	4968000	When they have to turn people away
4968000	4970000	They've kind of hit the limit
4970000	4972000	I think that could be a big part of it
4972000	4974000	But anyway
4974000	4976000	We're getting a little bit off base
4976000	4978000	We're getting a little bit off base
4978000	4980000	But yeah
4980000	4982000	We will
4982000	4984000	I'm sure have to start a Disney podcast someday
4984000	4986000	When I can afford to go to Disneyland again
4986000	4988000	Yet I say I can't afford Disneyland
4988000	4990000	And I'm like ooh I just bought a Red Tron 5
4990000	4992000	But Disneyland gets a lot more expensive than that
4992000	4994000	That won't even buy
4994000	4996000	That won't even buy
4996000	4998000	Like a two day park hopper anymore
4998000	5000000	When I spend on that Red Tron 5
5000000	5002000	I didn't see if they still have the SoCal discount
5002000	5004000	I didn't see anything about that
5004000	5006000	So we just need to talk to Marissa
5006000	5008000	I just want to be clear
5008000	5010000	I do love Disneyland
5010000	5012000	I love it and I miss it
5012000	5014000	I haven't been in over a year
5014000	5016000	But it's getting expensive yo
5016000	5018000	To do Disney
5018000	5020000	I really want to go before Big Thunder is gone
5020000	5022000	But still
5022000	5024000	I'm not going to be able to help it when they open Star Wars Land
5024000	5026000	I do want to see that
5026000	5028000	I'm not even that big of a Star Wars fan
5028000	5030000	But I just want to see how Disneyland does Star Wars
5030000	5032000	I want them to migrate the bucket of meat
5032000	5034000	Hopefully
5034000	5036000	I would think that would be a great fit at California Adventure
5036000	5038000	If they could do the bucket of meat
5038000	5040000	At some Wall-E themed place
5040000	5042000	So if they open Star Wars Land
5042000	5044000	Does that mean they're going to move Star Tours
5044000	5046000	I don't know
5046000	5048000	I would think logically
5048000	5050000	Yes you move Star Tours over there
5050000	5052000	Have a new Star Tour and then you close the old one
5052000	5054000	And use it for something else
5054000	5056000	But a lot of Star Wars is already injected into Tomorrowland
5056000	5058000	Because they're Star Tours
5058000	5060000	I believe I heard Space Mountain
5060000	5062000	Is going to have a Star Wars type theme
5062000	5064000	No they can't
5064000	5066000	It's a rock and roller coaster
5066000	5068000	If it's a temporary thing
5068000	5070000	It's not permanent
5070000	5072000	Remember the rock and roller coaster
5072000	5074000	It's going to be like that
5074000	5076000	Dan and I were actually talking about
5076000	5078000	Maybe sometime in the next year or so
5078000	5080000	Going to Disney World
5080000	5082000	So we can do Mission 1
5082000	5084000	Or Mission 2, whatever it's called
5084000	5086000	But then the Captain EO Theater
5086000	5088000	So how's Ingress in Disneyland?
5088000	5090000	Insane
5090000	5092000	There's like 500 portals in one park
5093000	5095000	And it's always constantly flipped
5095000	5097000	That's a great place to just AP farm
5097000	5099000	I am loving this you guys
5099000	5101000	Loki, within the scope of a week
5101000	5103000	Within the scope of a week has gone from
5103000	5105000	I hate Ingress, you're dumb for playing it
5105000	5107000	I just didn't get it
5107000	5109000	And I still don't really get it
5109000	5111000	But it's kind of something to kill time
5111000	5113000	So how many portals do you think there are at Disneyland?
5113000	5115000	I love it
5115000	5117000	If I'm going to have to
5117000	5119000	I don't normally go on the roller coaster
5119000	5121000	So I have to have something to do while I'm sitting there
5122000	5125000	Alright, I'm going to curb all the Disney chat
5125000	5128000	Although Bobby Black Wolf is screaming in chat
5128000	5130000	And I say screaming because it's all in caps
5130000	5132000	Come to Disney World instead
5132000	5134000	I've been giving that some serious thought
5134000	5136000	And if I could get the time away from work
5136000	5138000	I would love, love, love
5138000	5140000	To go to Dragon Con
5140000	5142000	I'm using my quotey fingers like really early
5142000	5144000	And go to Disney World on like Monday, Tuesday
5144000	5146000	And then go to Dragon Con
5146000	5148000	I would love to do that
5148000	5151000	What I would like to do is fly into Orlando
5151000	5153000	Or close to it
5153000	5155000	Go to Disney World and then rent a car
5155000	5157000	And drive up the Florida coast
5157000	5163000	And spend like another week in Mobile with my family
5163000	5165000	And then come home from Mobile
5165000	5167000	That would be perfect
5167000	5170000	Bobby Black Wolf is saying two days isn't enough for Disney World though
5170000	5172000	Good point, good point
5172000	5174000	Alright, anyway
5174000	5176000	We'll get into travel talk later
5176000	5178000	We got to get into some rapid fire news
5178000	5180000	So let's get to it
5180000	5182000	Traveling around quickly looking at what happened in the gaming world this week
5182000	5184000	With these quick stories, Loki
5184000	5188000	I'm not surprised but Super Mario Maker has already sold a million copies
5188000	5191000	I mean it makes sense because it looked awesome
5191000	5197000	And they said already over 2 million courses have been made
5197000	5200000	And it's been played 75 million times
5200000	5202000	And I want DLC
5203000	5207000	I'm wondering if they do like a DLC pack that's like Zelda 2 Adventures of Link
5207000	5209000	Because it is kind of side scroller
5209000	5212000	It would be kind of nice to have like non-Mario themes
5212000	5214000	I don't know
5214000	5216000	Hopefully
5216000	5219000	I just have a feeling we've only seen the beginning of what they're going to do with Mario Maker
5219000	5221000	Oh I think we have
5221000	5223000	If Splatoon and Mario Kart 8 are any example
5223000	5226000	I'm loving this Nintendo that understands DLC
5226000	5228000	I never thought I'd say that but I really am
5228000	5230000	Yeah
5230000	5232000	And then along with that
5232000	5236000	Speaking of community created things
5236000	5240000	Battlefield 4 they have a new outbreak map that's coming out
5240000	5243000	That's being designed I guess by the community
5243000	5245000	They've got
5245000	5247000	It looks kind of cool
5247000	5251000	It's like a jungle type environment
5251000	5255000	And you can drive boats on the river and stuff like that
5255000	5257000	So that's kind of cool
5257000	5261000	Maybe a free update that will be coming out soon
5261000	5263000	And then
5263000	5265000	Amiibos
5265000	5269000	Nintendo is bringing back some of the more rare Amiibos
5269000	5273000	Apparently the Captain Falcon, Fox, Greninja, Little Mac
5273000	5276000	Lucario and Shulk are going to be coming back
5276000	5279000	I may have picked up a Captain Falcon and a Little Mac
5279000	5281000	We found the Fox by the way
5281000	5283000	The Fox McCloud
5283000	5285000	Nice yeah
5285000	5287000	They are out there
5287000	5289000	So those will be coming back
5289000	5291000	Select retailers soon
5291000	5293000	And then along with that there's going to be some new
5293000	5295000	Animal Crossing Amiibos
5295000	5297000	Including they've got
5297000	5299000	Celeste
5299000	5303000	Mr. Rosetti, Kix and Blathers
5303000	5305000	And I'm assuming those are going to be for
5305000	5307000	Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer
5307000	5309000	I don't know
5309000	5311000	Rosetti is kind of fun
5311000	5313000	Yeah some of those Amiibo I would have to have
5313000	5315000	What about Tom? Do they have Tom Nook?
5315000	5317000	I know they have his kids
5317000	5319000	Timmy and Tommy
5319000	5321000	But I don't know if they have
5321000	5323000	They were annoying
5323000	5325000	Here's the thing
5325000	5327000	I'm kind of not feeling the
5327000	5329000	Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer
5329000	5331000	All the Amiibo stuff
5331000	5333000	That's cool that Jamie likes it
5333000	5335000	It seems like that would be more something like
5335000	5337000	For like
5337000	5339000	I don't know
5339000	5341000	Animal Crossing
5341000	5343000	Like
5343000	5345000	Imagine if you will
5345000	5347000	Instead of having random animals in your town
5347000	5349000	You buy the Amiibos for the animals
5349000	5351000	You want to live in your town
5351000	5353000	Alright
5353000	5355000	Anyhow we'll
5355000	5357000	Keep on moving with some more stories here
5357000	5359000	Because we can probably debate these Animal Crossing
5359000	5361000	Amiibo for some time
5361000	5363000	I say this now that I'm not going to get any
5363000	5365000	And then watch my shelf will suddenly
5365000	5367000	Where did you get the Blathers from?
5367000	5369000	I bought it because I could
5370000	5372000	They're out
5372000	5374000	No I meant for non-Animal Crossing
5374000	5376000	I don't know when that is planned
5376000	5378000	For non-Animal Crossing characters
5378000	5380000	I'd rather pick up a bunch of those
5380000	5382000	Than just buying a bunch of the figures
5382000	5384000	Alright
5384000	5386000	Moving on, speaking of Mario Maker
5386000	5388000	Japan getting another piece
5388000	5390000	Of DLC announced
5390000	5392000	We have yet to have one announced
5392000	5394000	But another character in Japan
5394000	5396000	It's Game Center CX's Arino
5396000	5398000	Who will have the suit and tie
5399000	5401000	So again this is one of those
5401000	5403000	Amiibo suits
5403000	5405000	That's used in the 8-bit version of the game
5405000	5407000	You can't really use it in the other levels
5407000	5409000	But that's still kind of cool
5409000	5411000	That's going to be some DLC
5411000	5413000	Can't wait to see what's coming out here
5413000	5415000	Do you think we'll get that here? Because I don't think we will
5415000	5417000	Well I'm kind of wondering if we will get that here
5417000	5419000	Or at least some sort of update because
5419000	5421000	Aren't we going to be playing those levels
5421000	5423000	Since we do play levels from Japanese players
5423000	5425000	I guess that's true
5425000	5427000	So wouldn't we have those suits?
5427000	5429000	That's a good thought I didn't think about
5429000	5431000	That we could essentially play a Japanese level
5431000	5433000	That would have those suits whether they're out here or not
5433000	5435000	That's a very good point
5435000	5437000	Unless they're just going to filter those out for us
5437000	5439000	Oh yeah like maybe what is
5439000	5441000	The Game Center person for us
5441000	5443000	Or for them will become a different personality for us
5443000	5445000	Well no I'm not
5445000	5447000	Oh maybe I don't know I just thought maybe
5447000	5449000	Everybody with DLC here
5449000	5451000	Maybe Jeff Keighley is going to be a suit in Mario Maker
5453000	5455000	Reggie Fils-Aime
5455000	5457000	I would love that
5457000	5459000	My buddy is ready
5459000	5461000	I'm seriously
5461000	5463000	Why didn't they put him in Smash
5463000	5465000	I mean come on that would have been so perfect
5465000	5467000	I missed out
5467000	5469000	You never know
5469000	5471000	They make the Mii
5471000	5473000	With Reggie a lot in the
5473000	5475000	I don't want the Mii I want actually
5475000	5477000	Reggie and the Mii is cool
5477000	5479000	You can make whoever you want but like I want
5479000	5481000	Actually to have officially
5481000	5483000	Supported Reggie in there
5483000	5485000	Mii Fighters aren't good enough
5485000	5487000	No it's not good enough
5487000	5489000	Moving on
5489000	5491000	What used to be the Best Buy
5491000	5493000	Theater in Times Square
5493000	5495000	Which was also once the Nokia
5495000	5497000	Theater it is now a Sony
5497000	5499000	Sponsored theater and so now
5499000	5501000	It is the PlayStation Theater
5501000	5503000	Not to be confused with a place
5503000	5505000	That will actually like have PlayStation
5505000	5507000	Experiences and so forth but being in
5507000	5509000	Times Square isn't that it's a theater
5509000	5511000	It will be live performances and
5511000	5513000	It will occasionally though have events that
5513000	5515000	Will showcase Sony PlayStation
5515000	5517000	Type events and you can bet that if
5517000	5519000	Sony has big announcements to make they may consider
5519000	5521000	Using this in New York City
5521000	5523000	So we'll see
5523000	5525000	You can also see that the official PlayStation
5525000	5527000	Twitter account actually tweeted some pictures of the
5527000	5529000	Inside of the theater looks very
5529000	5531000	Nice in there let's hope this branding sticks
5531000	5533000	They have a guy from
5533000	5535000	Doing No Man's Sky you know kind of the spokes works in there
5535000	5537000	On
5537000	5539000	Colbert's show and
5539000	5541000	He had a PewDiePie
5541000	5543000	On his show
5543000	5545000	One of the things that he was saying though
5545000	5547000	He's all
5547000	5549000	Is this game coming out soon?
5549000	5551000	Because it's got to be coming out soon if you're on my
5551000	5553000	Show so I'm wondering like
5553000	5555000	If they're going to be announcing something soon
5555000	5557000	Because it is true they've been doing
5557000	5559000	The whole
5559000	5561000	They've been doing that ever since
5561000	5563000	E3 and stuff but they've been doing talk show
5563000	5565000	Circuit where they're showing off the game
5565000	5567000	It's kind of usually
5567000	5569000	Yeah I thought it was supposed to be this holiday
5569000	5571000	That that game was out
5571000	5573000	Maybe surprise would be
5573000	5575000	I'd like a surprise please
5575000	5577000	Speaking of not to be too tangenty
5577000	5579000	But apparently Colbert
5579000	5581000	Had PewDiePie on
5581000	5583000	And very respectful
5583000	5585000	Sort of interview but in the Colbert way
5585000	5587000	Colbert still took his digs
5587000	5589000	In the way only he can do
5589000	5591000	But a lot of people comparing and contrasting
5591000	5593000	To how Jimmy Kimmel kind of came off
5593000	5595000	Like an uninformed ass
5596000	5598000	Which is also his shtick
5598000	5600000	I mean being an ass
5600000	5602000	Is kind of how he got famous from the man show
5602000	5604000	I mean right because that was his first
5604000	5606000	Big show was the one he did with Adam Carolla the man show
5606000	5608000	And they were kind of asses on that show
5608000	5610000	And that was what it was
5610000	5612000	But anyway people really
5612000	5614000	Giving kudos to Colbert and I got to say
5614000	5616000	I haven't watched a lot of episodes of his show
5616000	5618000	But I've always loved Stephen Colbert
5618000	5620000	And you know my love of Stephen Colbert
5620000	5622000	I watch a lot of the highlights thankfully
5622000	5624000	To the internet because I don't stay up to watch
5624000	5626000	Those shows but like I watch a lot of the highlights
5626000	5628000	And yeah I mean he's doing a great job
5628000	5630000	There's yeah and
5630000	5632000	I might be partial because I've loved him ever since
5632000	5634000	Strangers with Candy and even a little bit of
5634000	5636000	Exit 57 so I think it's cool that
5636000	5638000	They really do need to have Strangers with Candy come back
5638000	5640000	I don't think it can now
5640000	5642000	Why?
5642000	5644000	I don't know oh Bobby Blackwolf correcting me
5644000	5646000	Kimmel's first big show is
5646000	5648000	Win Ben Stein's Money I forgot about that
5648000	5650000	That's right
5650000	5652000	Oh yeah
5652000	5654000	That was before the Man Show I think it was
5654000	5656000	Was he the first host though?
5656000	5658000	I thought they had a woman on but maybe she was later
5658000	5660000	Because he wasn't always
5660000	5662000	The host of Win Ben Stein's Money
5662000	5664000	That came later wasn't it?
5664000	5666000	That show was awesome Yeah that show was a good show
5666000	5668000	I gotta say I need more Ben Stein
5668000	5670000	Where is Ben Stein?
5670000	5672000	He started going really political
5672000	5674000	He kind of went down that Margaret Cho route
5674000	5676000	Where she got less funny and more political
5676000	5678000	And I think that's kind of what happened with Ben Stein
5678000	5680000	So I don't know
5680000	5682000	Bobby Blackwolf says
5682000	5684000	That Ben's doing Clear Eyes ads
5684000	5686000	And Mega Man X400 says
5686000	5688000	The best game show host
5688000	5690000	Was the mean British lady
5690000	5692000	On weakest link
5692000	5694000	Anne Robinson
5694000	5696000	Yes
5696000	5698000	Which village is missing their idiot?
5698000	5700000	It's time to find out
5700000	5702000	Who is the weakest link?
5702000	5704000	Goodbye
5704000	5706000	That show is so fucking rad
5706000	5708000	Why is that gone?
5708000	5710000	Have you seen
5710000	5712000	Because we have basic cable
5712000	5714000	And occasionally I turn it on TV
5714000	5716000	Because I don't actually watch TV I just get it
5716000	5718000	Because it's $10 cheaper with cable for some stupid reason
5718000	5720000	So we have basic cable
5720000	5722000	And occasionally I'll turn it on and see what shows
5722000	5724000	Are on and there's like this game show
5724000	5726000	With a bomb and so you have to
5726000	5728000	Answer these questions and the answer is
5728000	5730000	Whatever when you cut and if they get it wrong
5730000	5732000	They get sprayed with some sort of
5732000	5734000	It's yogurt
5734000	5736000	It's dog urine
5736000	5738000	It's like really disgusting
5738000	5740000	Stuff
5740000	5742000	It was on Fox and I think it did so horribly
5742000	5744000	They moved it to one of the off brand
5744000	5746000	FX or something
5746000	5748000	It wasn't even that it was on one of the local channels
5748000	5750000	Because that's all I get
5750000	5752000	Maybe Fox kept it
5752000	5754000	I haven't watched TV in a while
5754000	5756000	What happened to TV?
5756000	5758000	Fox cancels Firefly
5758000	5760000	But keeps the bomb blowing up
5760000	5762000	Rabbit poop in people's faces
5762000	5764000	Firefly is too intelligent
5764000	5766000	For the audience that is Fox
5766000	5768000	So that's why
5768000	5770000	They have to
5770000	5772000	Put that crap on there
5772000	5774000	Hey rapid fire news
5774000	5776000	Where we talk about this news rapidly
5776000	5778000	And don't go on tansions
5778000	5780000	Hey Google and Microsoft
5780000	5782000	I'm sorry Rob have you met us?
5782000	5784000	No
5784000	5786000	Who are you people and what are you doing in my house?
5786000	5788000	Google and Microsoft
5788000	5790000	Hey they used to be going
5790000	5792000	Head to head to each other over different patents
5792000	5794000	Because you know everybody loves to fight about patents
5794000	5796000	But Google and Microsoft
5796000	5798000	Agreeing to a truce
5798000	5800000	There were 20 lawsuits
5800000	5802000	Between the two companies
5802000	5804000	They have all been
5804000	5806000	Settled essentially
5806000	5808000	Ending the five year dispute
5808000	5810000	This has to do with phones
5810000	5812000	Xbox video playback
5812000	5814000	Now they're going to actually come together
5814000	5816000	And on certain patent matters
5816000	5818000	They will actually brand together
5818000	5820000	Building a royalty free video format
5820000	5822000	That prevents these legal skirmishes
5822000	5824000	In the future
5824000	5826000	So that's always nice to see people resolve their differences
5826000	5828000	And all this patent
5828000	5830000	Crap get weeded out
5830000	5832000	That's nice
5832000	5834000	How about you Dark Soccer what do you have?
5834000	5836000	Eh nothing I give up
5836000	5838000	No I'm kidding
5838000	5840000	Stop
5840000	5842000	So Nvidia has decided to rebrand
5842000	5844000	Grid
5844000	5846000	All in capitals as Geforce now
5846000	5848000	So basically it's their version of cloud gaming
5848000	5850000	To give you 1080p
5850000	5852000	60 frames per second
5852000	5854000	60 frames per second gaming
5854000	5856000	Over the internet blah blah blah
5856000	5858000	So yeah rebranding that's all
5858000	5860000	If you see a change that's why
5860000	5862000	Also the game
5862000	5864000	That pretty much started it all when it comes to fighting games
5864000	5866000	Is
5866000	5868000	Now on Playstation Network
5868000	5870000	It's karate champ
5870000	5872000	So I mean how's that
5872000	5874000	For a slice of 1984 right?
5874000	5876000	That takes me back to Straw Hat Pizza
5876000	5878000	Straw Hat Pizza
5878000	5880000	Which is still around I guess
5880000	5882000	Which I've never been to
5882000	5884000	Really? Yeah
5884000	5886000	It's not bad but they used to be everywhere and then they just kind of fizzled
5886000	5888000	Do you think there's good pizza in Alabama?
5888000	5890000	No
5890000	5892000	I bet you'd be surprised
5892000	5894000	Didn't you say there was like a sushi place you loved in Alabama?
5894000	5896000	I thought there was
5896000	5898000	Yeah but they opened it like well after I moved
5898000	5900000	Did you know there's a place
5900000	5902000	Sorry to do tangents but that's what we do here at OLR
5902000	5904000	Since I've been informed
5904000	5906000	Did you know that there's a sushi place
5906000	5908000	Near here called Nemo Sushi
5908000	5910000	And the little logo
5910000	5912000	Is actually an orange fish
5912000	5914000	That has white stripes on it
5914000	5916000	And I'm like
5916000	5918000	I could go there and eat little Nemo
5918000	5920000	Why would you call your restaurant
5920000	5922000	Why would you call your restaurant
5922000	5924000	Nemo Sushi
5924000	5926000	You're gonna eat Nemo
5926000	5928000	See I would've if I was gonna do one called Nemo Sushi
5928000	5930000	It would be a little boy in pajamas
5930000	5932000	And you could sit on beds and eat sushi
5932000	5934000	Fair enough, alright sorry
5934000	5936000	I still want to go to that Ninja Sushi
5936000	5938000	I apologize for the tangent
5938000	5940000	But it was important
5940000	5942000	This tangent was brought to you by fish
5942000	5944000	I'll never forget we went to a place called Taka's Sushi
5944000	5946000	Just because we were like
5946000	5948000	Because of the name BeatMania2DX LOL
5948000	5950000	I don't even know if that place is still there
5950000	5952000	They have the sakura roll which I had to eat
5952000	5954000	You had a sakura roll at Taka's Sushi
5954000	5956000	A sakura roll
5958000	5960000	So anyway
5960000	5962000	There's been leaks
5962000	5964000	Of new Street Fighter 5 characters
5964000	5966000	There's one called Lara
5966000	5968000	And I'm trying to
5968000	5970000	It was actually shared by
5970000	5972000	Famitsu
5972000	5974000	But I'm trying to see exactly what her style is
5974000	5976000	It looks like she's a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu
5976000	5978000	And then
5978000	5980000	There was also announced
5980000	5982000	Nekali and Rashid
5982000	5984000	And then they also confirmed
5984000	5986000	Zangief
5986000	5988000	Yay, Street Fighter 5
5988000	5990000	Excellent
5990000	5992000	Done
5992000	5994000	Alright well then let's go to our
5994000	5996000	FOOGLE question of the week
5996000	5998000	Each week we take Facebook
5998000	6000000	And Google Plus and we slam those
6000000	6002000	Words together and you get FOOGLE
6008000	6010000	Of course you can follow us
6010000	6012000	At Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio
6012000	6014000	Or Google.com slash
6014000	6016000	Plus OrangeLoungeRadio
6016000	6018000	And tonight we thought we would ask
6018000	6020000	About multiplayer games
6020000	6022000	Since you know Jackbox Games
6022000	6024000	Was on the show tonight
6024000	6026000	And they specialize really in multiplayer party games
6026000	6028000	We thought we'd ask about your favorite
6028000	6030000	Multiplayer game to have people
6030000	6032000	All in one place to play
6032000	6034000	And we were really looking for
6034000	6036000	In one room type of stories
6036000	6038000	Because yeah you can play everything online today
6038000	6040000	Including you know the Jackbox games
6040000	6042000	But I think it's
6042000	6044000	Kind of fun to talk about having people
6044000	6046000	Over and getting the party on that way
6046000	6048000	So let's go to Facebook
6048000	6050000	Where Master Claw starts us off tonight
6050000	6052000	Saying Super Smash Brothers Melee
6052000	6054000	Mario Kart 64 and GoldenEye 007
6054000	6056000	Saw the most couch multiplayer
6056000	6058000	In my house
6058000	6060000	I haven't had many friends IRL since then
6060000	6062000	Aww that's sad though
6062000	6064000	You always answer our questions
6064000	6066000	If you listen to this show you must be a good guy
6066000	6068000	You should have lots of friends IRL
6068000	6070000	Maybe you just don't have friends that play video games
6070000	6072000	But you'd be surprised
6072000	6074000	I'm sometimes talking to play Mario Kart with you
6074000	6076000	Bryce H. replies
6076000	6078000	And says Mario Kart 8
6078000	6080000	And Just Dance
6080000	6082000	See I don't, so people
6082000	6084000	Really do the Just Dance with lots of people around
6084000	6086000	I would think I'd be a little scared to do that
6086000	6088000	Oh come on you did the Abba Dance
6088000	6090000	With me and Tiara
6090000	6092000	That was a private moment
6092000	6094000	Tiara was here wasn't she?
6094000	6096000	That was a private moment
6096000	6098000	I was a private dancer
6098000	6100000	You weren't dancing for money
6100000	6102000	I didn't know that was anything except a laugh
6102000	6104000	Didn't I get sushi? I don't know
6104000	6106000	I don't know
6106000	6108000	Degenerate Johnny says
6108000	6110000	Although I would have loved to say We Dare for the Wii
6110000	6112000	I couldn't find good swinger couples
6112000	6114000	To play with me, Sy
6114000	6116000	So I guess I'll have to stick with Super Smash Brothers
6116000	6118000	Oh Degenerate Johnny
6118000	6120000	Ragenator says
6120000	6122000	When I was in college
6122000	6124000	My college campus had a 4 slot Neo Geo MVS
6124000	6126000	A few of us really got into playing the crap
6126000	6128000	Out of Samurai Shodown 4
6128000	6130000	Amakusa's Revenge
6130000	6132000	Granted only 2 people could play at a time
6132000	6134000	In terms of non-video gaming
6134000	6136000	I used to love Magic the Gathering the actual card game
6136000	6138000	Sadly I can't afford to constantly get new cards
6138000	6140000	Nowadays plus card shops are a pain to get to
6140000	6142000	For my neighborhood anyway
6142000	6144000	So I have to settle for the Steam incarnations of Magic
6144000	6146000	You know I was wondering if somebody would reply with an arcade game
6146000	6148000	Because you know
6148000	6150000	Arcade games were definitely a multiplayer experience
6150000	6152000	All in the same place many years ago
6152000	6156000	Hence how Dark Sakura, Loki, and myself met
6156000	6158000	Actually was playing DDR
6158000	6160000	I wonder if anybody said DDR
6160000	6162000	So I guess maybe dance games would be included
6162000	6164000	Didn't I just say just dance?
6164000	6166000	That must be a thing with age
6166000	6168000	In my 20s I must not have been as inhibited as I am now
6168000	6170000	Alright Silent Tom
6170000	6172000	Says my favorite multiplayer game
6172000	6174000	Is the best of the Rock Band games
6174000	6176000	I get
6176000	6178000	Excuse me Rock Band games
6178000	6180000	A game my wife, her and her best friend and her hubby have
6180000	6182000	Get together and have some drinks
6182000	6184000	And have a great time
6184000	6186000	And ER also saying Rock Band
6186000	6188000	Back in college we played that game a ton
6188000	6190000	We also played a lot of fighting games
6190000	6192000	Which just aren't the same online
6192000	6194000	SSG100Matt says my friends and I
6194000	6196000	During my middle and high school years
6196000	6198000	Would always play the Mario Party games together
6198000	6200000	Primarily Mario Party 2
6200000	6202000	We played the hell out of that game
6202000	6204000	And would always get into playful arguments
6204000	6206000	About setting off Bowser parades
6206000	6208000	Star stealing and coin stealing
6208000	6210000	We also had developed calluses on the palms of our hands
6210000	6212000	And had several broken N60 games
6212000	6214000	To be fair those things are really easy to break
6214000	6216000	Hitstun says nothing beats a big game of Bomberman
6216000	6218000	It's easy to pick up and play
6218000	6220000	So it's great for parties
6220000	6222000	It's about time we get a Bomberman game on current consoles
6222000	6224000	Who owns that IP now?
6224000	6226000	Oh yeah
6226000	6228000	It's Konami
6228000	6230000	Nevermind
6230000	6232000	What you weren't a fan of Bomberman Zero
6232000	6234000	Or whatever that was on the
6234000	6236000	Oh god
6236000	6238000	Anyway
6238000	6240000	Dark Tetsuya says
6240000	6242000	I'm gonna say Para Para Paradise
6242000	6244000	Because even though it wasn't technically multiplayer
6244000	6246000	If you get a bunch of nerds in a room
6246000	6248000	That know the routine to a given song
6248000	6250000	They're all probably gonna do it
6250000	6252000	In blatant disregard to the sign
6252000	6254000	Forbidding such activity
6254000	6256000	Okay you're right I was totally wrong on what I said about dancing
6256000	6258000	Yeah it's hilarious when they
6258000	6260000	Forbid that type of thing it's like what is this
6260000	6262000	Footloose or something?
6262000	6264000	Dancing is foreboden
6264000	6266000	Here at Golfland
6266000	6268000	Lastly on Facebook
6268000	6270000	MegamanX400
6270000	6272000	Our pal from Video Game Realness
6272000	6274000	Podcast says
6274000	6276000	Hands down the game my friends and I have played the most
6276000	6278000	Even since high school has been Smash Brothers
6278000	6280000	Each iteration has provided
6280000	6282000	Hours of replayable fun
6282000	6284000	As everyone's skill levels improved
6284000	6286000	We all shifted over time and performance
6286000	6288000	So it kept things interesting and competitive
6288000	6290000	For us
6290000	6292000	Those are the answers from Facebook
6292000	6294000	But let us not forget Google Plus
6294000	6296000	Where we have ActDeft saying Super Smash Brothers
6296000	6298000	They never failed to deliver
6298000	6300000	On the local multiplayer department
6300000	6302000	Retertainment says
6302000	6304000	Seen it since all you really needed to play it
6304000	6306000	Was a DVD player
6306000	6308000	Oh god they really drilled that series
6308000	6310000	Into the ground though with all the scenes
6310000	6312000	Have you seen the Twilight seen it?
6312000	6314000	That's nothing but trivia questions
6314000	6316000	On the Twilight games oh lord
6316000	6318000	Sent it on fire
6318000	6320000	And lastly
6320000	6322000	MartinD replies and says
6322000	6324000	Maybe a weird answer here but probably
6324000	6326000	Tekken 3 is still the game I played
6326000	6328000	The most with my friends back in the day
6328000	6330000	A lot of fun
6330000	6332000	Also any FIFA game is a lot of fun to play
6332000	6334000	Against friends not really into the party games
6334000	6336000	I don't think Tekken 3 is a weird answer
6336000	6338000	Irene and I used to play the shit out of that game
6338000	6340000	And it was all about Panda
6340000	6342000	I worked in an Amco arcade when that was out
6342000	6344000	I still am proud of the day
6344000	6346000	That I went in and the guys had been there
6346000	6348000	Like almost all day practicing King
6348000	6350000	And I decided to just take
6350000	6352000	You know go back and forth with Jen and Julia
6352000	6354000	On the left
6354000	6356000	AkumaJP giving an old school answer
6356000	6358000	In our chat room saying
6358000	6360000	If it doesn't have to be multiplayer my friend and I
6360000	6362000	Played the shit out of Shinobi on the Genesis
6362000	6364000	4 person turn by turn
6364000	6366000	Yeah I mean
6366000	6368000	Sometimes a multiplayer gaming experience
6368000	6370000	Was passing that controller around
6370000	6372000	And everybody kind of doing the part of the game
6372000	6374000	That they're best at or you suck
6374000	6376000	And can't get past this part let me take care of it
6376000	6378000	Bomberman 2 with the multitap
6378000	6380000	On the SNES
6380000	6382000	That was pretty awesome
6382000	6384000	Yeah they really haven't had a new one in a while
6384000	6386000	The last one I can think of was that
6386000	6388000	They had one on the Xbox 360
6388000	6390000	And I think it was on PlayStation 3 as well
6390000	6392000	But not zero
6392000	6394000	Not zero there was like on the network
6394000	6396000	Nintendo network
6396000	6398000	The online download
6398000	6400000	Yeah there was Bomberman live
6400000	6402000	Alright
6402000	6404000	Anyhow that does it for the Fugu question of the week
6404000	6406000	But we've got some more news and your phone calls
6406000	6408000	Here in a little while
6409000	6411000	In the meantime Loki
6411000	6413000	Yeah so it kind of makes me wonder you know with
6413000	6415000	You know the decision for
6415000	6417000	Konami going into this whole
6417000	6419000	More so into the Pachinko
6419000	6421000	And you know on mobile games
6421000	6423000	Division maybe it's not the greatest thing
6423000	6425000	Sega, Sammy for example
6425000	6427000	They're cutting 200 jobs
6427000	6429000	In its Pachinko division
6429000	6431000	Based on poor sales
6431000	6433000	So
6433000	6435000	They're putting, soliciting voluntary retirement
6435000	6437000	For 200 jobs
6437000	6439000	And I guess they're saying that there was
6439000	6441000	An extraordinary loss
6441000	6443000	And that basically
6443000	6445000	The poor sales of
6445000	6447000	Pachinko machines like
6447000	6449000	Pachinko slot
6449000	6451000	Hokuto no Ken Tomo
6451000	6453000	Or Fist of the North Star
6453000	6455000	And Bayonetta's Pachinko slot
6455000	6457000	Not even hitting half the sales
6457000	6459000	They were expected to
6459000	6461000	I hope Bayonetta isn't
6461000	6463000	Like gone forever
6463000	6465000	I have this really bad feeling it is
6466000	6468000	I'm going to try not to think negative thoughts
6468000	6470000	And just hope that she shows up in Smash Brothers
6470000	6472000	And gets an amiibo
6472000	6474000	But I just feel like it's not going to happen
6477000	6479000	So I guess there isn't
6479000	6481000	Tons and tons of money
6481000	6483000	Could it be over saturation of the market?
6483000	6485000	I mean because I can't imagine
6485000	6487000	Well I don't know
6487000	6489000	There's probably a ton of Pachinko slot
6489000	6491000	Parlors or arcades or whatever
6491000	6493000	In Japan so
6493000	6495000	Do they maybe have too many?
6495000	6497000	I mean I don't know
6497000	6499000	Why it wouldn't perform as well
6499000	6501000	Alan Alchemy in chat over at
6501000	6503000	Live.FogNetwork.com says
6503000	6505000	They need to port Bayonetta to PC
6505000	6507000	God damn it
6507000	6509000	Maybe the first one
6509000	6511000	But the second one they can't
6511000	6513000	That game would not have happened if not for Nintendo
6513000	6515000	And I don't see Nintendo
6515000	6517000	I mean unless there's something in the contract
6517000	6519000	Where like after five years they can do it
6519000	6521000	Like maybe what happened was Zombie U
6521000	6523000	And I still believe we can
6523000	6525000	Yeah so anyway
6525000	6527000	Moving on
6527000	6529000	Let's get to another story here
6529000	6531000	Although a masked bishop joined our chat room
6531000	6533000	Apparently just to say Bomberman 64 was amazing
6533000	6535000	Oh yeah the old school Bomberman's were all awesome
6535000	6537000	But then Bomberman 0 happened
6537000	6539000	And we all wondered what the hell happened
6539000	6541000	Alright anyhow
6541000	6543000	Let's move on to some updates on the
6543000	6545000	Xbox One console
6545000	6547000	You know PlayStation 4 got its big update
6547000	6549000	And I know Xbox One's right around the corner
6549000	6551000	It's supposed to be the big backwards compatibility one right
6551000	6553000	But also some other features that are
6553000	6555000	Supposed to be in the Xbox One update
6555000	6557000	Cortana was originally
6557000	6559000	Going to I believe be a part of this
6559000	6561000	However will not
6561000	6563000	Be making a debut until
6563000	6565000	Early next year
6565000	6567000	According to Major Nelson
6567000	6569000	Unfortunately that is not going to be a part of this
6569000	6571000	Roll out however
6571000	6573000	Folks in the dashboard preview program later
6573000	6575000	This fall will be able to actually use
6575000	6577000	Cortana but I gotta be honest
6577000	6579000	I don't ever use this voice search
6579000	6581000	Stuff it doesn't seem to work
6581000	6583000	And I can't get the microphone to work on my laptop
6583000	6585000	So it's just like normally I do that
6585000	6587000	If I don't want to find Photoshop
6587000	6589000	Digging through the menus I just type Photoshop
6589000	6591000	Really I've never had any problem
6591000	6593000	With Siri
6593000	6595000	I wasn't going to use it anyway
6595000	6597000	Siri's a little different because you know that's in the palm of your hand
6597000	6599000	And that is I will say that's convenient
6599000	6601000	For Siri's going to be on the Apple TV
6601000	6603000	Remind me in 20 minutes I don't think
6603000	6605000	I would ever use it on Apple TV to be honest
6605000	6607000	But I do use Siri for
6607000	6609000	Remind me in 20 minutes to check the oven
6609000	6611000	I use Siri to text you from my watch
6611000	6613000	Do you really? Yeah I do
6613000	6615000	When I'm on my way to the show I'll just tell Rob
6615000	6617000	This and then I even have my punctuation
6617000	6619000	But see those are all portable
6619000	6621000	Things and just on something
6621000	6623000	That's on your like set top
6623000	6625000	Box I don't see a lot of use for it
6625000	6627000	I will say the thing that Apple
6627000	6629000	Is doing and maybe Microsoft's doing this
6629000	6631000	With Xbox One I don't realize it
6631000	6633000	Is that the Apple thing will
6633000	6635000	Tell you this movie's on Hulu
6635000	6637000	Or this movie's on Netflix and so on
6637000	6639000	That's useful because there's so many freaking services
6639000	6641000	Now I don't know what movie is where
6641000	6643000	Like where do I get to watch old
6643000	6645000	Episodes of Strangers with Candy with Stephen Colbert
6645000	6647000	Because it's not on Netflix but it is on Hulu
6647000	6649000	That type of search is really useful
6649000	6651000	That's actually going to be on Apple TV
6651000	6653000	Right that's what I'm saying that's one thing that I think will be
6653000	6655000	Good on Apple TV but I don't
6655000	6657000	Think it's planned for Microsoft's
6657000	6659000	Thing if it is then I guess that's something
6659000	6661000	I might use I like I just turned on
6661000	6663000	The microphone just for the fuck of it to see if
6663000	6665000	You know what would happen with
6665000	6667000	Cortana and he said there is
6667000	6669000	An eclipse try to open something
6669000	6671000	I'm like I don't know what you
6671000	6673000	Cortana just told you there's an eclipse
6673000	6675000	Yeah so there's an eclipse period and it's like
6675000	6677000	Trying to open something I'm like okay
6677000	6679000	Thank you for that information tell her to divide by
6679000	6681000	Zero and see if she makes funny like Siri does
6681000	6683000	Alright anyhow also
6683000	6685000	Some things that have been added to
6685000	6687000	The Xbox beta app in
6687000	6689000	Windows 10
6689000	6691000	So this is kind of related
6691000	6693000	Party text chat available for the
6693000	6695000	Xbox beta app members
6695000	6697000	Reading and replying to messages directly from
6697000	6699000	Notifications
6699000	6701000	Alert activity alert notifications
6701000	6703000	Like if somebody else is on Xbox
6703000	6705000	Add you as a friend or whatever
6705000	6707000	And then activity feed sharing you can share within
6707000	6709000	The activity feed so
6709000	6711000	Cool
6711000	6713000	Some additions there to Xbox
6713000	6715000	And I'm sure the
6715000	6717000	Big software update for everybody
6717000	6719000	I think that was supposed to go live in October right?
6719000	6721000	With the big backwards compatibility and all that
6721000	6723000	I think that was coming up very soon
6723000	6725000	Alright meanwhile Dark Soccer what do you have for us?
6725000	6727000	Actually I was talking to
6727000	6729000	Ikuma JP real quick
6729000	6731000	And I had like a total brain translation error
6731000	6733000	But
6733000	6735000	But
6735000	6737000	Siri would be Shiri
6737000	6739000	In Japan which means butt
6739000	6741000	So I wonder if you'd be like
6741000	6743000	Hey butt
6743000	6745000	Hey butt you're a butt
6745000	6747000	I'm just
6747000	6749000	Trying to help
6749000	6751000	You can friend my butt
6751000	6753000	Anyway
6753000	6755000	So Twisted Pixel
6755000	6757000	We know them right?
6757000	6759000	Splosion Man
6759000	6761000	Well you know that they
6761000	6763000	Were acquired by Microsoft in
6763000	6765000	2011 well they're going solo
6765000	6767000	They have
6767000	6769000	Had an amicable split
6769000	6771000	And they are going
6771000	6773000	On to expand their relationships
6773000	6775000	They're going to see other companies
6775000	6777000	They're going to
6777000	6779000	Be a poly
6779000	6781000	Poly gaming
6781000	6783000	They want to live the life of a single company for a while
6783000	6785000	They're gonna be swinging
6785000	6787000	Do those things they didn't get to experience five years ago
6787000	6789000	Exactly so they've had an
6789000	6791000	Enrollment
6791000	6793000	Of sorts I guess
6793000	6795000	They still had to work with the prenup
6795000	6797000	But you know
6797000	6799000	That means Splosion Man on Playstation 4 soon enough right?
6799000	6801000	Maybe
6801000	6803000	Could be
6803000	6805000	But
6805000	6807000	The Microsoft General Manager
6807000	6809000	John Needham said
6809000	6811000	I can't wait to see what this talented team creates next
6811000	6813000	And that's it
6813000	6815000	We'll see
6815000	6817000	Alright
6817000	6819000	Logie
6819000	6821000	Alright so in October
6821000	6823000	We're going to be getting some
6823000	6825000	New Playstation Plus games
6825000	6827000	Including Broken Age
6827000	6829000	Super Meat Boy
6829000	6831000	On Playstation 4
6831000	6833000	Playstation 3 Beginning Chariot
6833000	6835000	Kickbeat, Kung Fu Rabbit
6835000	6837000	And also Unmechanical Extended
6837000	6839000	And Vita, Broken Age
6839000	6841000	Kickbeat, Kung Fu Rabbit
6841000	6843000	And Super Meat Boy
6843000	6845000	Also in October
6845000	6847000	The Drive Club
6847000	6849000	Demo or whatever that was
6849000	6851000	Will be leaving as well
6851000	6853000	So be sure to download it
6853000	6855000	Before October 6
6855000	6857000	And then
6857000	6859000	Along with that
6859000	6861000	Wait why are they getting rid of it?
6861000	6863000	That seems so weird
6863000	6865000	There was this big hype up about the
6865000	6867000	Release of Drive Club on Playstation Plus
6867000	6869000	It was something they had launched
6869000	6871000	Took forever to get
6871000	6873000	And now they're going to pull it?
6873000	6875000	Was it that bad?
6875000	6877000	I thought
6877000	6879000	Some people really enjoyed it
6879000	6881000	But I found it hard to play that
6881000	6883000	After playing Forza Horizon 2
6883000	6885000	No thank you
6885000	6887000	And then along with that
6887000	6889000	Of course Super Meat Boy is going to have
6889000	6891000	Different music though on Playstation 4
6891000	6893000	And the Vita release
6893000	6895000	That's just because
6895000	6897000	The original
6897000	6899000	Audio designer has decided
6899000	6901000	Not to license the music for the new versions
6901000	6903000	Of the game so they're going to be getting other
6903000	6905000	Music
6905000	6907000	For the game
6907000	6909000	There sounds like some very interesting
6909000	6911000	Drama there because you know they're not
6911000	6913000	In specifics but it's very much
6913000	6915000	Like a I'm not going to work with them
6915000	6917000	Again type of thing
6917000	6919000	Very interesting drama there
6919000	6921000	They're basically replacing the soundtrack
6921000	6923000	They have different musicians
6923000	6925000	Including
6925000	6927000	Some of the artists that worked on
6927000	6929000	The Binding of Isaac, Rebirth
6929000	6931000	Hotline Miami and Plants vs. Zombies
6931000	6933000	Hotline Miami
6933000	6935000	Had a sick soundtrack though
6935000	6937000	It would be kind of cool to hear how it
6937000	6939000	It's going to be weird
6939000	6941000	I kind of thought some of the best
6941000	6943000	Stuff in Super Meat Boy was the music
6943000	6945000	The music was so good and fit the game
6945000	6947000	Not to say that the new soundtrack
6947000	6949000	Will be bad it's just
6949000	6951000	It's going to have big shoes to fill
6951000	6953000	It's going to almost feel like a different game
6953000	6955000	It's going to be a very interesting kind of
6955000	6957000	I don't know
6957000	6959000	Experiment
6959000	6961000	I guess for lack of a better word
6961000	6963000	In how important is the soundtrack
6963000	6965000	To a game
6965000	6967000	We'll see
6967000	6969000	The games will be up for download
6969000	6971000	On October 6th
6971000	6973000	I could also see
6973000	6975000	That maybe the whole social aspect
6975000	6977000	And the fact that the game will be shared everywhere
6977000	6979000	Maybe the guy
6979000	6981000	I don't know maybe it's just more of a personal thing
6981000	6983000	Between him and the other makers
6983000	6985000	I don't necessarily want to make stuff up
6985000	6987000	The fact that that music is going to be streamed everywhere
6987000	6989000	It has been streamed everywhere for a long time
6989000	6991000	I guess that's true
6991000	6993000	There's a lot of YouTube videos with all that
6993000	6995000	Alright
6995000	6997000	Well moving on it's a little bit of a slower news week
6997000	6999000	So we're having to dig deep a little bit here
6999000	7001000	So we're talking about website launches tonight
7001000	7003000	But I think this is interesting
7003000	7005000	It's about a topic I think a lot of people
7005000	7007000	Have an opinion about certainly
7007000	7009000	And that is game reviews
7009000	7011000	And you guys know Metacritic
7011000	7013000	And Metacritic is often controversial
7013000	7015000	Well there's a new site
7015000	7017000	That's been launched this week
7017000	7019000	That's picking up some exposure on some gaming blogs
7019000	7021000	Called Open Critic
7021000	7023000	And Open Critic is
7023000	7025000	Trying to focus on video games
7025000	7027000	But they're doing some different things with it
7027000	7029000	Such as they'll be just a simple score average
7029000	7031000	Not weighted differently from different websites
7031000	7033000	And apparently you can actually
7033000	7035000	Go in there as a user and whitelist
7035000	7037000	Different outlets
7037000	7039000	To only see reviews from
7039000	7041000	So that way if you think a particular
7041000	7043000	Website is shit
7043000	7045000	And you don't like their reviews
7045000	7047000	You can just basically
7047000	7049000	Blacklist them and they don't actually show up in the scores
7049000	7051000	That you see
7051000	7053000	And that's a very interesting concept
7053000	7055000	Because even with movies it's like
7055000	7057000	Well maybe you agree with Cisco but you don't agree with Ebert
7057000	7059000	Type of thing you know
7059000	7061000	Or whoever the, who do they have these days
7061000	7063000	There's nobody that compares to Cisco and Ebert now
7063000	7065000	Is it Roper and some other dude
7065000	7067000	But anyway you know there tends to be
7067000	7069000	Probably certain outlets that you agree with more than others
7069000	7071000	You know like vognetwork.com
7071000	7073000	Wink wink
7073000	7075000	Anyhow
7075000	7077000	It's going to be interesting to see how that goes
7077000	7079000	Also apparently one other big twist
7079000	7081000	Is going to be displaying non-numerical scores
7081000	7083000	Because
7083000	7085000	You know some websites have said
7085000	7087000	We're no longer giving games a score
7087000	7089000	And so open critic is still somehow
7089000	7091000	Going to rate that
7091000	7093000	I don't know if that's using words
7093000	7095000	Or how they're going to do that or if they're just
7095000	7097000	Assigning a score based on how the review reads
7097000	7099000	That could be very interesting and controversial
7099000	7101000	But anyway I thought that was just
7101000	7103000	Worth bringing up
7103000	7105000	Not that I usually will give these websites
7105000	7107000	Free plugs but
7107000	7109000	I do often times have conversations about
7109000	7111000	You know the importance of video game reviews
7111000	7113000	Is Metacritic helping or harming
7113000	7115000	The developing of games because we've heard about
7115000	7117000	The whole bonuses tied to Metacritic scores and all that
7117000	7119000	So it's interesting that somebody wants to
7119000	7121000	Come in and shake that up a little bit
7121000	7123000	So
7123000	7125000	Very interesting
7125000	7127000	Alright
7127000	7129000	Let's move on with the mailbag
7129000	7131000	Tonight Dark Soccer
7131000	7133000	Going to dive into the mailbag
7133000	7135000	Head first and pull out some emails
7135000	7137000	That she believes are worthy of reading
7137000	7139000	On the show, there's actually quite a bit
7139000	7141000	So I should shut up and let her get to it but I will say
7141000	7143000	If you want to email us for a future week
7143000	7145000	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com
7145000	7147000	You know I was just told today
7147000	7149000	That on the Facebook
7149000	7151000	The email address has been wrong for like
7151000	7153000	How long ago did we switch the email address?
7153000	7155000	I don't know
7155000	7157000	I totally forgot to change Facebook, it has now changed
7157000	7159000	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com
7159000	7161000	If you see the wrong email floating around out there
7161000	7163000	Please let me know, I'll fix it
7163000	7165000	Whatever the
7165000	7167000	I've got an email
7167000	7169000	That I think is in
7169000	7171000	Braille?
7171000	7173000	Oh yes, I saw
7173000	7175000	That one, there's like a bunch of coded
7175000	7177000	Text or whatever
7177000	7179000	We don't, do we
7179000	7181000	Do we have a cipher or something
7181000	7183000	To crack the code?
7183000	7185000	Nope, moving on
7185000	7187000	I guess unintelligible
7187000	7189000	Garball is what we got for an email this week
7189000	7191000	I'll
7191000	7193000	See if I can look at it later this week and translate it
7193000	7195000	But it better be good, I swear to god
7195000	7197000	If I translate it, it's like
7197000	7199000	Oh my god, Becky, stop sending me pictures of cookies
7199000	7201000	Is she listening?
7201000	7203000	No, I just messaged
7203000	7205000	I just put on Facebook, Becky cookies
7205000	7207000	And she's like, well I'm actually making some right now
7207000	7209000	And I'm like, I'm coming over after the show
7209000	7211000	If I translate that message and it's butt butt fart
7211000	7213000	I'm going to be very upset, I'm just saying
7213000	7215000	I will be
7215000	7217000	But if it's butt fart fart
7217000	7219000	Then we're fine
7219000	7221000	I just wanted to say hey butts
7221000	7223000	Hello LR
7223000	7225000	It's your friendly neighborhood alleged
7225000	7227000	Word murderer with an opinion and a serious
7227000	7229000	Question, god this is a long email
7229000	7231000	Stop it, YYR
7231000	7233000	I personally believe that the Vita's commercial
7233000	7235000	Failure in the US is almost entirely due to
7235000	7237000	The rise of smartphone gaming and
7237000	7239000	The resulting change in market
7239000	7241000	Conditions, heck the 3DS
7241000	7243000	Was almost a failure for the same reason
7243000	7245000	Have we forgotten that it sold
7245000	7247000	Miserably during its first year or so
7247000	7249000	It wasn't until Nintendo dropped the price
7249000	7251000	And a steady stream of high quality games
7251000	7253000	Released that it began to sell well
7253000	7255000	Without both of those things it would have flopped
7255000	7257000	Just as hard, the casual games that kept
7257000	7259000	The Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS popular
7259000	7261000	Even when Nintendo wasn't
7261000	7263000	Releasing the gold
7263000	7265000	Gold the movie adaptations
7265000	7267000	The games featuring
7267000	7269000	Popular toys or kids characters
7269000	7271000	And so on
7271000	7273000	Have almost all moved to phones and tablets
7273000	7275000	Today's market has
7275000	7277000	Changed without both a low price tag
7277000	7279000	And a continuous stream of quality games
7279000	7281000	The market is done with you and therefore
7281000	7283000	It was done with the Vita very quickly
7283000	7285000	Speaking of continuous what's left in the
7285000	7287000	Pipeline for the 3DS
7287000	7289000	Most of my friends already seem to have abandoned theirs
7289000	7291000	If and when Nintendo releases a new portable
7291000	7293000	The market for them will be even tougher
7293000	7295000	Than it was this time
7295000	7297000	I wish them good luck, I really do and for the record
7297000	7299000	I love my Vita
7299000	7301000	Which, by the way
7301000	7303000	I picked up
7303000	7305000	My Vita again for like the first time
7305000	7307000	In ages when Happy Home Designer came out
7309000	7311000	Not my Vita, my DS
7311000	7313000	I haven't played my American one
7313000	7315000	Since Pixel Poops
7315000	7317000	You should lend it to us
7317000	7319000	I also got that Japanese one and then
7319000	7321000	Akuma sent me that game from Japan
7321000	7323000	And I have some other stuff to play on that
7323000	7325000	But I haven't played the American one since Pixel Poops
7325000	7327000	You should lend it to us
7327000	7329000	I might be talked into that
7329000	7331000	I'll lend you a Neo Geo Pocket Color
7331000	7333000	Alright, now I'd like to pose a question
7333000	7335000	To the panel, the chatters and really
7335000	7337000	Everyone listening
7337000	7339000	I thought of this when talking with Amy
7339000	7341000	This week about pop music
7341000	7343000	According to statistics
7343000	7345000	Everybody eventually ages out of pop music
7345000	7347000	They're no longer interested in new stuff
7347000	7349000	They're perfectly content to go back
7349000	7351000	And listen to the years with the music they
7351000	7353000	Already enjoyed for the rest of their lives
7353000	7355000	And never look forward again
7355000	7357000	On average this happens in their early to mid 30's
7357000	7359000	Though for women it happens a bit later
7359000	7361000	Than it does for men
7361000	7363000	Do you think this will also happen with all of us
7363000	7365000	In video games?
7365000	7367000	I asked this question because I'm starting to think
7367000	7369000	That this process has already begun for me
7369000	7371000	I managed to get a PS4 about a month ago
7371000	7373000	With The Last of Us for $275
7373000	7375000	Figured I'd need it eventually for Shenmue 3
7375000	7377000	So why not?
7377000	7379000	I hooked it up and downloaded the cross buy games
7379000	7381000	I already owned
7381000	7383000	Since that weekend it has never been turned on
7383000	7385000	Not even once
7385000	7387000	While this is likely partially due to
7387000	7389000	My current most played console
7389000	7391000	It feels odd to me
7391000	7393000	I haven't yet purchased Super Mario Maker
7393000	7395000	In fact I feel absolutely zero need to buy it
7395000	7397000	Any time soon even though 12 year old me
7397000	7399000	Would have put in 100 hours already
7399000	7403000	My Xbox 360, Xbox One, 3DS and Wii U
7403000	7405000	Backlogs have gotten so long that I feel like
7405000	7407000	I just don't need it
7407000	7409000	So what am I playing right now?
7409000	7411000	Sonic Adventure 2 on 360
7411000	7413000	I'm having more fun with it than I've had
7413000	7415000	With anything else I've played this year so far
7415000	7417000	Despite the fact that I 100% destroyed it
7417000	7419000	When it came out almost 15 years ago
7419000	7421000	Now I have access to over 35 years
7421000	7423000	Of video games on demand
7423000	7425000	At my fingertips
7425000	7427000	And sometimes I feel like I'd be perfectly content
7427000	7429000	Just playing what's come out already
7429000	7431000	Never looking forward again
7431000	7433000	What are your thoughts on this?
7433000	7435000	And do you think you'll personally reach this point?
7435000	7437000	I'd also love to know what the listeners think
7437000	7439000	And if this doesn't become a future foogle question
7439000	7441000	I hope they'll respond via email or in some other way
7441000	7443000	Looking to spare Rob
7443000	7445000	From the year old jokes
7445000	7447000	YYR
7447000	7449000	You know what? I actually think this is a great question
7449000	7451000	But I'm gonna say that
7451000	7453000	And I would pose this to our chatters
7453000	7455000	If we do have any quick responses
7455000	7457000	I'll read those out on air
7457000	7459000	But are video games gonna go the way
7459000	7461000	Where as you get older you're not gonna be able to appreciate
7461000	7463000	The new stuff like you appreciate the old stuff
7463000	7465000	But see I would actually say that I'm not sure
7465000	7467000	What you said at the very beginning
7467000	7469000	Is even accurate
7469000	7471000	That we don't understand pop music today
7471000	7473000	I mean for me personally
7473000	7475000	And everybody's different
7475000	7477000	And that's the first thing to remember
7477000	7479000	But for me personally
7479000	7481000	There is some newer music that I actually really enjoy
7481000	7483000	Some of it I don't understand
7483000	7485000	At all
7485000	7487000	Like One Direction
7487000	7489000	That's not music
7489000	7491000	But you know
7491000	7493000	Younger girls would disagree with you
7493000	7495000	There's a difference between
7495000	7497000	Cookie cutter pop
7497000	7499000	And actual pop music
7499000	7501000	I do but I also think a lot of it's relative
7501000	7503000	Music is music
7503000	7505000	But like the new Church's album
7505000	7507000	Is what I've been listening to
7507000	7509000	Like non-stop
7509000	7511000	It's so fucking good that just came out like last week
7511000	7513000	Or me and Mystery Skulls
7513000	7515000	But is Church's really pop music?
7515000	7517000	I don't know
7517000	7519000	The new Carly Rae Jepsen album
7519000	7521000	And I feel so embarrassed saying that
7521000	7523000	Because I know how tacky
7523000	7525000	That Call Me Maybe got
7525000	7527000	But her new album with new stuff is actually really cool
7527000	7529000	I really like it
7529000	7531000	But I am also
7531000	7533000	So looking forward to
7533000	7535000	The 20 year anniversary
7535000	7537000	And if you know me you know why
7537000	7539000	Of Jagged Little Pill
7539000	7541000	With demos from the 90's that have been unreleased until now
7541000	7543000	Like I cannot wait for that
7543000	7545000	And I listen to ABBA all the time
7545000	7547000	So I kind of get both sides of it
7547000	7549000	So for video games it's actually
7549000	7551000	Kind of similar
7551000	7553000	Like there's some new stuff
7553000	7555000	I don't really understand and I'm not sure
7555000	7557000	I'm ever going to and for me that would be stuff like
7557000	7559000	A lot of sports games
7559000	7561000	Madden, that's just a train
7561000	7563000	I'm never going to be able to get on
7563000	7565000	Call of Duty for me
7565000	7567000	But I understand for Loki
7567000	7569000	He's got to play them all and that's cool
7569000	7571000	And I only play them for a little bit now
7571000	7573000	I really need to go back to Advanced Warfare
7573000	7575000	Why did I buy the season pass if I'm not going to play online?
7575000	7577000	But
7577000	7579000	There's some games
7579000	7581000	That take me a while to understand
7581000	7583000	And appreciate later
7583000	7585000	I think Minecraft is the quintessential example
7585000	7587000	I didn't get Minecraft at first
7587000	7589000	What so ever
7589000	7591000	And it wasn't until the 360 version
7591000	7593000	Came out that framed the game a little differently
7593000	7595000	Where I was totally on board
7595000	7597000	And I was like okay I understand Minecraft
7597000	7599000	This game is an awful lot of fun
7599000	7601000	But Minecraft was always bigger with I think a younger
7601000	7603000	Generation before I got it
7603000	7605000	And this isn't even unique to video games
7605000	7607000	Because Snapchat
7607000	7609000	Do you know how popular Snapchat is?
7609000	7611000	And I didn't understand it
7611000	7613000	At all
7613000	7615000	Until Alan finally sat me down and was like
7615000	7617000	This is why people use it
7617000	7619000	And you can create stories
7619000	7621000	And it's just a fun way for you to look
7621000	7623000	And you can send people messages and all this stuff
7623000	7625000	I just thought it was a way to send people dick pics
7625000	7627000	I thought it was just for dick pics and nothing else
7627000	7629000	But no apparently there's this whole other
7629000	7631000	Like it's huge
7631000	7633000	People use Snapchat to communicate like a lot
7633000	7635000	But
7635000	7637000	But anyway
7637000	7639000	I kind of think that analogy
7639000	7641000	Kind of works
7641000	7643000	For a lot of different things
7643000	7645000	But I also don't necessarily
7645000	7647000	Think it's accurate to say that for
7647000	7649000	All people you're not going to be
7649000	7651000	Into necessarily newer pop music
7651000	7653000	And newer things
7653000	7655000	It can also be that like a lot of pop music nowadays is cookie cutter
7655000	7657000	I mean granted a lot of pop music back in
7657000	7659000	The 80's was cookie cutter too but for some reason
7659000	7661000	It's just I don't know
7661000	7663000	Because it's age!
7663000	7665000	Well now also you have like at least back then
7665000	7667000	It was more like
7667000	7669000	You actually had to sing it nowadays
7669000	7671000	So you can sample and just
7671000	7673000	Throw your voice through a computer
7673000	7675000	And
7675000	7677000	I know I might be weird
7677000	7679000	And you guys are going to disagree with me
7679000	7681000	I see that in some ways as another instrument
7681000	7683000	Like you know
7683000	7685000	We kind of laugh at some of the people
7685000	7687000	Who overuse it
7687000	7689000	But like with like Cher's Believe
7689000	7691000	That is a great pop song
7691000	7693000	And it just would not be the same without the
7693000	7695000	Do you believe in like
7695000	7697000	The way it sounds like a computer
7697000	7699000	The major autotune
7699000	7701000	The obvious autotune
7701000	7703000	Ok but here's the thing
7703000	7705000	You can make fun of that but then on the other hand
7705000	7707000	Ok I'm going to watch this
7707000	7709000	You can go to Kate Bush
7709000	7711000	And what she did
7711000	7713000	She did like this whole like reimagining
7713000	7715000	Of some of her pop songs and in some of it
7715000	7717000	She uses that whole like
7717000	7719000	Autotune stuff as art
7719000	7721000	I need to get that
7721000	7723000	And you can't fucking tell me that Kate Bush
7723000	7725000	It's not
7725000	7727000	Kate Bush is like progressive rock
7727000	7729000	Imogen Heap with
7729000	7731000	Hide and Seek
7731000	7733000	Everybody knows that song from the Dear Sisters
7733000	7735000	See that was like
7735000	7737000	Autotune as an instrument in a way
7737000	7739000	So it's like
7739000	7741000	Church's does the same thing
7741000	7743000	So I'm not necessarily
7743000	7745000	I don't necessarily subscribe to the fact that autotune is always bad
7745000	7747000	Do some people abuse it? Sure
7747000	7749000	Or Lord
7749000	7751000	Well all the background singing and
7751000	7753000	Instrumentation was her
7753000	7755000	So my favorite Lord meme
7755000	7757000	Will always be the whole like where she posted
7757000	7759000	The thing on her Instagram that says
7759000	7761000	It was graffiti that says Lord help me
7761000	7763000	And it was spelled L-O-R-D-E
7763000	7765000	And she just put as the caption I'm on my way
7765000	7767000	That's cute
7767000	7769000	Anyway
7769000	7771000	Darktitsuyu in chat says
7771000	7773000	I do kind of miss the stuff we listened to
7773000	7775000	Back in the early 2000's when we did the original
7775000	7777000	Show. You know it doesn't seem
7777000	7779000	I've been trying to see if they make Eurodance
7779000	7781000	Kind of like that and I feel like it's more
7781000	7783000	Evolved into like that
7783000	7785000	The trance and the Euro vocal trance
7785000	7787000	Which isn't bad by any means
7787000	7789000	I love that stuff and I listen to a lot of stuff
7789000	7791000	On Spotify
7791000	7793000	Is there any more from what's that artist
7793000	7795000	That kind of partnered up with Paul Terry there for a little bit
7795000	7797000	Orbitribe?
7797000	7799000	Oh I have no idea I have to check
7799000	7801000	Spotify. I just know Armin Van Buren
7801000	7803000	I swear to God is putting out a compilation every week
7803000	7805000	And a podcast
7805000	7807000	He's got a great ear
7807000	7809000	I could listen to any of those mixes he does
7809000	7811000	It's great
7811000	7813000	On a tangent I guess I got away a little bit
7813000	7815000	From the original question
7815000	7817000	I don't even remember what the original question was
7817000	7819000	Okay the original question was
7819000	7821000	Pop music we tend to not
7821000	7823000	Listen to the new stuff and focus on the stuff we
7823000	7825000	Enjoyed as kids. Is that going to be the same situation
7825000	7827000	With video games?
7827000	7829000	I am just saying
7829000	7831000	To be honest although I completely see your point
7831000	7833000	Your analogy is not always true
7833000	7835000	So therefore no
7835000	7837000	I think I'm pretty interested in
7837000	7839000	Games coming out now
7839000	7841000	Just there's only certain games I want
7841000	7843000	I think now it's like
7843000	7845000	I don't have Blockbuster and stuff where I could rent
7845000	7847000	Games for five bucks and just play everything
7847000	7849000	Now it's just kind of more selective
7849000	7851000	About it
7851000	7853000	I kind of have a better idea what my tastes are
7853000	7855000	And also you know it used to be that
7855000	7857000	The only exposure on
7857000	7859000	What a game is was from looking at the box
7859000	7861000	Hmm does this look interesting?
7861000	7863000	I guess we'll rent it
7863000	7865000	I don't have like now where the internet
7865000	7867000	You see trailers, you watch the impressions of it
7867000	7869000	You hear people talk about it, read the reviews
7869000	7871000	I mean there's a lot to it
7871000	7873000	You know what's interesting though?
7873000	7875000	And to give YYR the benefit of the doubt
7875000	7877000	I just saw this comment in chat
7877000	7879000	And I'm sorry
7879000	7881000	You're going to think I'm yelling at you and I swear I'm not
7881000	7883000	I respect your opinion. Kasan in our chat room
7883000	7885000	Says I can't think of
7885000	7887000	Three good music videos from the 90s
7887000	7889000	And I'm sitting here about to flip a table
7889000	7891000	I'm like what? What are you talking about?
7891000	7893000	There wasn't three good videos from the 1990s
7893000	7895000	Oh my god like some of the greatest music
7895000	7897000	Videos were from the 1990s
7897000	7899000	Like you know
7899000	7901000	I for one think Alanis
7901000	7903000	Ironic was a fantastic
7903000	7905000	Video at the time. Madonna did
7905000	7907000	So many great videos in the 90s like Ray of Light
7907000	7909000	That Jamiroquai
7909000	7911000	Virtual Insanity was so cool
7911000	7913000	All Gorillaz videos?
7913000	7915000	That was...
7915000	7917000	I mean my god there's a ton of good stuff
7917000	7919000	How many other Michael Jackson videos?
7919000	7921000	So I kind of look at that comment and go
7921000	7923000	What the fuck are you?
7923000	7925000	Again you're welcome to your opinion
7925000	7927000	And that goes to show that YYR to your point
7927000	7929000	I think the opposite might be true
7929000	7931000	Most of the time
7931000	7933000	Not all the time
7933000	7935000	But I think the opposite
7935000	7937000	And what I mean by that is I think people today
7937000	7939000	Who grew up on PlayStation 2
7939000	7941000	Like don't know a world
7941000	7943000	With anything older than a PlayStation 2 or 3
7943000	7945000	I think those people
7945000	7947000	Have a much harder time
7947000	7949000	Going back to NES
7949000	7951000	Atari 2600
7951000	7953000	And appreciating the value of those games
7953000	7955000	The way that we can
7955000	7957000	Most of the time
7957000	7959000	Not saying all the time because certainly there's gonna be
7959000	7961000	Like that 18 year old that listens to OLR
7961000	7963000	That says whoa you're wrong
7963000	7965000	My son refers to anything that
7965000	7967000	Is 8-bit as Minecraft
7967000	7969000	So he's just like
7969000	7971000	So that game looks like Minecraft
7971000	7973000	So that comment kind of made me think
7973000	7975000	Because I'm sitting here going what are you talking about
7976000	7978000	And I'm thinking well maybe
7978000	7980000	He doesn't have that same perspective
7980000	7982000	That I do because I lived it
7982000	7984000	You know and if you're younger
7984000	7986000	You didn't have the emotional attachment to those videos
7986000	7988000	The way maybe that I do
7988000	7990000	And so I think with video games
7990000	7992000	To YYR's point that's very true
7992000	7994000	So YYR I actually think
7994000	7996000	The complete opposite of what you said is what's true
7996000	7998000	If that makes sense
7998000	8000000	Anyway
8000000	8002000	There you go and now everybody in chat is like
8002000	8004000	Naming off great 90s music videos
8004000	8006000	Smashing pumpkins oh my god
8006000	8008000	So many amazing 90s music videos
8008000	8010000	Sabotage by Beastie Boys
8010000	8012000	Smack My Bitch Up by Prodigy
8012000	8014000	Remember the big twist in that video
8014000	8016000	And that was a controversial one I got banned from MTV
8016000	8018000	Anyway I just want to say
8018000	8020000	I'm not yelling at you
8020000	8022000	Your point just kind of made me go
8022000	8024000	What? For a minute
8024000	8026000	So anyway
8026000	8028000	Let's move on next email
8028000	8030000	There are still a few
8030000	8032000	So next email comes
8032000	8034000	From Robert M
8034000	8036000	Do any of you yet know whether
8036000	8038000	The bases of Lego Dimensions
8038000	8040000	Figures slash builds are able
8040000	8042000	To store data such as studs collected
8042000	8044000	Alternate builds, experience levels
8044000	8046000	And so on nope
8046000	8048000	I do not know the answer I will in a week
8048000	8050000	But I'm sure we have some people in our chat
8050000	8052000	Who have played the game who know that
8052000	8054000	Do the Lego Dimensions characters save
8054000	8056000	Information
8056000	8058000	Cause Amiibos can do that right
8058000	8060000	Amiibos do it Skylanders do it
8060000	8062000	I'll give some information cause you can take them to different
8062000	8064000	Does it? Okay
8064000	8066000	Maybe somebody in chat can
8066000	8068000	Fill us in with a little more information on how that works
8068000	8070000	Cause even though I bought it today I haven't played it yet
8070000	8072000	So Brad from Pop Culture
8072000	8074000	Jumping in to say the vehicles do
8076000	8078000	There you go
8078000	8080000	Alright
8080000	8082000	There's the best answer I can get for now
8082000	8084000	Alright next email
8084000	8086000	Eating's Grey and Way Allutation
8086000	8088000	Says sorry Jamie it's been a while since I've
8088000	8090000	Messed with Grandpa by using Pig Ladin
8090000	8092000	Oh I already know who this is
8092000	8094000	I couldn't help myself by the way I just
8094000	8096000	Caught up on all OLR episodes and I'm
8096000	8098000	Happy to hear Rob is thinking about bringing back
8098000	8100000	That Wednesday show out from
8100000	8102000	Hiatus
8102000	8104000	Quickly it's not just my decision
8104000	8106000	To make that clear
8106000	8108000	It's something that Extra for myself
8108000	8110000	And Grandpa are all talking about
8110000	8112000	And even inviting
8112000	8114000	If Shane wants to be a part of it he certainly can
8114000	8116000	Although if he doesn't then we respect that too
8116000	8118000	Not to get too
8118000	8120000	Tangeny sorry I'm interrupting
8120000	8122000	Darkseiders email but I think people want to know
8122000	8124000	Right now really for us
8124000	8126000	We're all kind of burned out on online games
8126000	8128000	Like you know I don't even
8128000	8130000	Really play Final Fantasy 14 these days
8130000	8132000	Just because there's a real lull
8132000	8134000	Between content patches
8134000	8136000	I don't think Grandpa's playing anything but maybe
8136000	8138000	Heroes of the Storm I'm playing Diablo 3 granted
8138000	8140000	But we need to find a new focus
8140000	8142000	And once that's
8142000	8144000	What the three of us have to sit down and figure out
8144000	8146000	So it's almost like starting a new podcast
8146000	8148000	And we realize
8148000	8150000	There's a lot of people out there
8150000	8152000	Who really don't care what we talk about
8152000	8154000	Because they're tuning in to hear Grandpa and Extra for
8154000	8156000	Gang up on me which is fine
8156000	8158000	But once we figure out what that
8158000	8160000	Supposed topic of the show is going to be
8160000	8162000	And how that format is going to work
8162000	8164000	It'll be back in some form
8164000	8166000	Which reminds me I need to talk to you about something
8166000	8168000	Okay
8168000	8170000	Anyway
8170000	8172000	I know you guys
8172000	8174000	Have been wiping on that difficult boss
8174000	8176000	Known as real life but I'm confident
8176000	8178000	That you guys will pull through as you always do
8178000	8180000	As long as Rob keeps up with his heels
8180000	8182000	And Grandpa keeps his drink on
8182000	8184000	Because he's better at DPS when he's drunk
8184000	8186000	Extra is perfect the way he is tanking
8186000	8188000	And spanking
8188000	8190000	I will pass that message along
8190000	8192000	And Grandpa is back from
8192000	8194000	His big NBA trip
8194000	8196000	He went over
8196000	8198000	He gallivanted across Europe and had beer from all over
8198000	8200000	And supposedly under the guise of education
8200000	8202000	Yeah
8202000	8204000	So anyway
8204000	8206000	A little bit of news came out
8206000	8208000	Last week on Digital Card Gaming front
8208000	8210000	As some of you might have heard
8210000	8212000	In Spring 2014
8212000	8214000	Wizards of the Coast slash Hasbro filed a lawsuit
8214000	8216000	Against Cryptozoic Entertainment
8216000	8218000	The lawsuit stated that
8218000	8220000	Cryptozoic's digital card game released
8220000	8222000	Hex Shards of Fate
8222000	8224000	Infringed on Wizards of the Coast
8224000	8226000	Hasbro's card game Magic the Gathering
8226000	8228000	In regards to copyright, trade dress, and patent claims
8228000	8230000	I remember this
8230000	8232000	Well I'm happy to say that the lawsuit has been settled
8232000	8234000	As of Thursday of last week
8234000	8236000	Link below
8236000	8238000	HexTCG.com slash press dash release dash settlement
8238000	8240000	However
8240000	8242000	Those who have read the press release
8242000	8244000	May have noticed the word license
8244000	8246000	Has shown up twice
8246000	8248000	Although details of the settlements are unknown
8248000	8250000	The appearance of the word license
8250000	8252000	Make the story a little interesting
8252000	8254000	For me at least
8254000	8256000	Regardless I'm glad to know that the matter has been settled
8256000	8258000	And I hope that this
8258000	8260000	Bit news will ease
8260000	8262000	The concerns of would be hex players
8262000	8264000	Who might have been put off by the lawsuit
8264000	8266000	My question to you guys
8266000	8268000	In chat is this
8268000	8270000	We all know that copyright laws are extremely out of date
8270000	8272000	I understand that we're all not lawyers and senators
8272000	8274000	As far as I know
8274000	8276000	But imagine if you could change those laws
8276000	8278000	How would you change them in accordance
8278000	8280000	To the technological age we live in today
8280000	8282000	I'm not a lawyer
8282000	8284000	It'd have to be revamped
8284000	8286000	With all due respect
8286000	8288000	That is such a deep question
8288000	8290000	I'm not sure I can think of an answer on the spot
8290000	8292000	About how to fix it
8292000	8294000	I want a politician to tell me how they're going to do it
8294000	8296000	And I'm going to nod and say that sounds good
8296000	8298000	How would you do it?
8300000	8302000	I would think it would be a lot harder
8302000	8304000	To trademark
8304000	8306000	Very vague, broad
8306000	8308000	Things
8308000	8310000	That seems to be a lot of the problem
8310000	8312000	Is just the broadness
8312000	8314000	That people can actually patent
8314000	8316000	And the fact that
8316000	8318000	I don't want to say you can't patent ideas
8318000	8320000	Because I realize that defeats the purpose
8320000	8322000	But I gotta say
8322000	8324000	Since you're listening to old episodes of OLR
8324000	8326000	I really truly think
8326000	8328000	We have what? 616 episodes of the show we've done
8328000	8330000	If there's like 10 OLR episodes
8330000	8332000	You must listen to before you die
8332000	8334000	That episode that Kyle Ward was on
8334000	8336000	A couple months ago
8336000	8338000	And sorry I don't remember the number off the top of my head
8338000	8340000	I need to crowd source that one for a minute
8340000	8342000	Dark Tetsuya what number was that?
8342000	8344000	That is one of the 10 episodes you need to hear of OLR
8344000	8346000	Because
8346000	8348000	Kyle talking about
8348000	8350000	What he went through with his game
8350000	8352000	And what he realized about these various
8352000	8354000	Patents that Konami actually owned
8354000	8356000	We were sitting here going
8356000	8358000	Thank you 596
8358000	8360000	I knew it was right before 600
8360000	8362000	That is one of the 10 I truly feel
8362000	8364000	I can't believe you can actually Google our episodes
8364000	8366000	Would you guys agree with me?
8366000	8368000	I think that's really one of the 10 best episodes we ever did
8368000	8370000	And just that insight
8370000	8372000	That he really gave us into that
8372000	8374000	And kind of how the sausage is made
8374000	8376000	Sort of thing
8376000	8378000	I really think kind of plays into exactly why you're seeing the word license
8378000	8380000	I think Wizards of the Coast
8380000	8382000	Or whatever had some type of patent
8382000	8384000	In this thing that had
8384000	8386000	Hex by the balls that they couldn't get out of
8386000	8388000	And so they had to license it
8388000	8390000	And I don't think the fans
8390000	8392000	Should lash out at Hex for this
8392000	8394000	I think the fans should take their case to
8394000	8396000	Wanting this patent law reformed
8396000	8398000	And how was a patent granted
8398000	8400000	For this in the first place
8400000	8402000	Question mark
8402000	8404000	I think the rules about what we do
8404000	8406000	And what we don't patent
8406000	8408000	Need to be more clearly defined
8408000	8410000	I can see them with patenting the rules of the game
8410000	8412000	Or something like that
8412000	8414000	And if they're copying the exact rules of the game
8414000	8416000	Then there could be issues
8416000	8418000	But I think general
8418000	8420000	Patents for just like
8420000	8422000	Arrows scrolling up a screen
8422000	8424000	Or method to blah blah blah
8424000	8426000	I think they should be granted
8426000	8428000	For a couple years and then that's it
8428000	8430000	Make your money off of it
8430000	8432000	And then it goes public domain
8432000	8434000	Kind of like how medicine is
8434000	8436000	When you find a drug that's patented for what
8436000	8438000	7 years and you get to make it
8438000	8440000	And then that's it
8440000	8442000	Then it can go generic after that
8442000	8444000	Because that 7 years is long enough
8444000	8446000	Especially with an idea like arrows
8446000	8448000	Scrolling up the screen
8448000	8450000	Look how long DDR lasted
8450000	8452000	It's really not around anymore
8453000	8455000	It is not the cultural thing it was
8455000	8457000	When we first started doing OLR
8457000	8459000	You know so I think these ideas
8459000	8461000	Kind of have their cycle
8461000	8463000	And then they kind of come and go
8463000	8465000	And look what happened with the plastic instruments and all that
8465000	8467000	Well you know who's pushing for all that
8467000	8469000	Copyright stuff to be extended out
8469000	8470000	Disney
8470000	8471000	Absolutely
8471000	8473000	Well because they're scared as hell what's going to happen
8473000	8475000	When Mickey Mouse goes in the public domain
8475000	8477000	I mean I could
8477000	8479000	I could put a picture
8479000	8481000	I mean I guess I could do this today under parody law
8481000	8483000	Technically but I could sell a shirt
8483000	8485000	Of me pooping on Mickey Mouse
8485000	8487000	I could sell a shirt
8487000	8489000	And there's nothing they could do to stop me
8489000	8491000	Once Mickey Mouse is in the public domain
8491000	8493000	That's what they're afraid of
8493000	8495000	You want to charge like $200
8495000	8497000	For me to go to Disneyland
8497000	8499000	I'm going to make my own Disneyland
8499000	8501000	I could have a picture of a shirt
8501000	8503000	I could have a picture of a shirt with Mickey Mouse
8503000	8505000	On it that says I love dick
8505000	8507000	And there's nothing they could do about it
8507000	8509000	Now they can because I can't sell that shirt
8509000	8511000	I mean I could do it under parody
8511000	8513000	If I put it onto my Twitter account they can't do anything
8513000	8515000	But if I sell a shirt with Mickey Mouse
8515000	8517000	That says I love dick they could sue me
8517000	8519000	But they won't once
8519000	8521000	Mickey goes in the public domain so you're right
8521000	8523000	Disney is scared as hell of that stuff
8523000	8525000	Banksy just did it with Dismaland
8525000	8527000	Oh that's right
8527000	8529000	But he didn't use the characters exactly
8529000	8531000	And you could kind of say that's parody
8531000	8533000	It was parody it was also a political statement
8533000	8535000	But yeah
8535000	8537000	Boy did we get on a tangent with that email
8537000	8539000	We do that here at OLR don't we
8539000	8541000	Alright
8541000	8543000	P.S. Rob I'm happy to
8543000	8545000	Know that you're starting to fulfill the first
8545000	8547000	Part of your new years resolution
8547000	8549000	In regards to streaming yes I did watch the
8549000	8551000	Broadcasting of your stream from yesterday
8551000	8553000	However I've yet to see
8553000	8555000	That platinum that you were hoping
8555000	8557000	To get on Diablo 3 PS4
8557000	8559000	Which was the second part of your new years
8559000	8561000	Resolution lol
8561000	8563000	It's all good Rob not all of us are meant to achieve
8563000	8565000	Platinum status in games
8565000	8567000	Snuggles and huggles to you all
8567000	8569000	Not so sincerely degenerate Johnny
8569000	8571000	I've got three months left
8571000	8573000	Here's what's going to do me in I'm not going to have
8573000	8575000	The vacation time over the holidays like I had
8575000	8577000	Last year because of the job switch so
8577000	8579000	I don't know we'll see we'll see
8579000	8581000	I'm also actually considering
8581000	8583000	Doing like a weekly twitch again
8583000	8585000	Because you know how I was
8585000	8587000	Playing hot to full boyfriend
8587000	8589000	I'm actually just thinking about doing just
8589000	8591000	Jamie fucks around in Dragon Age
8591000	8593000	And cheats
8593000	8595000	As long as you kind of like give commentary and talk
8595000	8597000	Through it it could be very interesting
8597000	8599000	I just like playing the game
8599000	8601000	And like answering people
8601000	8603000	We talked about this last week though where it's just different
8603000	8605000	Depending on the stream you know I did a Diablo 3
8605000	8607000	You guys have to tell me what you think of this I don't think
8607000	8609000	Anybody saw it but it's on my archive
8609000	8611000	Twitch TV slash Rob Roberts
8611000	8613000	Maybe I'll do it again tonight if I have time
8613000	8615000	I was playing some Diablo 3 yesterday because for me
8615000	8617000	PC streaming is the easiest but
8617000	8619000	Using that new game show software I actually
8619000	8621000	Set up different camera things
8621000	8623000	So that like when I was in between stages
8623000	8625000	It was my little cam you could see my cam
8625000	8627000	And the Diablo screen I would kind of talk to the camera
8627000	8629000	And then I could even click a button
8629000	8631000	And it would make the screen even smaller and you would
8631000	8633000	See the chat room and I would respond to chat comments
8633000	8635000	Although there weren't a lot yesterday because it was Saturday afternoon
8635000	8637000	But then when I actually went into the Rift
8637000	8639000	And I was doing heavy game playing
8639000	8641000	I clicked another button and made the game full screen
8641000	8643000	And I just talked over it and I thought that was
8643000	8645000	Like I like being able to switch between
8645000	8647000	Them I think is even better
8647000	8649000	Than just a static image that's what I would like
8649000	8651000	To do more of in the future but that game show right now
8651000	8653000	Is kind of limiting on
8653000	8655000	Some features but
8655000	8657000	Anyway I'll get into that at a later time
8657000	8659000	I gotta let Jamie finish the email
8659000	8661000	Hey OLR Delvin here
8661000	8663000	From Video Game Realness, long time listener
8663000	8665000	First time emailer Delvin is
8665000	8667000	Awesome and he's my podcasting buddy
8667000	8669000	On a seasonal show, reading is fundamental
8669000	8671000	Did you know I did a show on RuPaul's Drag Race?
8671000	8673000	We do a podcast
8673000	8675000	The listeners might not
8675000	8677000	And knowing is half the battle
8677000	8679000	This past weekend
8679000	8681000	Was the start of a League of Legends
8681000	8683000	World Championship and I have been watching
8683000	8685000	A fair amount of it
8685000	8687000	Despite being terrible at the game
8687000	8689000	I have been playing League of Legends for a few years now
8689000	8691000	Also have friends who have played it
8691000	8693000	Since the game first came out
8693000	8695000	To see where the game started
8695000	8697000	And what it has become over the past few years
8697000	8699000	Is incredibly mind boggling in a good way
8699000	8701000	As far as the esports scene
8701000	8703000	For the game goes, it started out as friends
8703000	8705000	Who were good at the game, made teams
8705000	8707000	And competed at local or national events
8707000	8709000	And now has grown into a full fledged sport
8709000	8711000	Having managers, sponsors, drafts
8711000	8713000	And large amounts of viewers and teams
8713000	8715000	That have become full on brands
8715000	8717000	And household names among the gaming community
8717000	8719000	I'm curious to know
8719000	8721000	What is OLR's thoughts on esports
8721000	8723000	Mainly League of Legends has become
8723000	8725000	And do you see it as good or bad for gaming?
8725000	8727000	Your pal, Delvin, Video Game Realness
8727000	8729000	P.S. For those who don't know
8729000	8731000	Rob has a long lost brother who plays League of Legends
8731000	8733000	Professionally for Cloud9 Gaming
8733000	8735000	Under the name LemonNation, look it up
8763000	8765000	I'm not really good at them, therefore I don't really have much of an interest in them
8767000	8769000	But it's not that I want to see these games tank
8769000	8771000	Because I don't
8771000	8773000	I don't carry that negativity
8773000	8775000	And I think the money that gets poured into this stuff
8775000	8777000	I mean, A. It's exposure for gaming
8777000	8779000	It's more of a positive image for gaming
8779000	8781000	That it's not all necessarily
8781000	8783000	Just like guns blazing
8783000	8785000	And Doom and Mortal Kombat
8785000	8787000	Ripping heads off of bodies and stuff
8787000	8789000	It kind of gets a little more into that
8789000	8791000	Strategical side of games
8791000	8793000	So I like that that's kind of what's out there
8793000	8795000	More and more in the populace
8795000	8797000	And with TBS taking on some Counter-Strike
8797000	8799000	Next year and so forth
8799000	8801000	A little more of the
8801000	8803000	Strategical and the actual game side of things
8803000	8805000	But I personally
8805000	8807000	It's hard
8807000	8809000	I try to watch it and I'm just kind of like
8809000	8811000	I don't understand what the fuck's going on
8811000	8813000	But I did
8813000	8815000	Shane and I watched on Twitch a little bit of the
8815000	8817000	Heroes of the Storm stuff
8817000	8819000	A lot of my co-workers play that
8819000	8821000	Which is basically
8821000	8823000	League of Legends dumbed down
8823000	8825000	For people like me
8825000	8827000	Blizzard is A plus
8827000	8829000	Pro at dumbing games down
8829000	8831000	And making them accessible and that's not a bad thing at all
8831000	8833000	That's just what they do
8833000	8835000	And they're going to do it with the Team Fortress thing
8835000	8837000	And the first person shooter with this game they're making now
8837000	8839000	Overwatch
8839000	8841000	Anyway
8841000	8843000	Shane and I did watch some of that
8843000	8845000	I was kind of into it
8845000	8847000	Because at least I understand this game
8847000	8849000	But do I get caught up in the celebrity
8849000	8851000	Of it all and that end of it?
8851000	8853000	Not really
8853000	8855000	That I'm not really so into
8855000	8857000	And I'm not sure I understand
8857000	8859000	That yet
8859000	8861000	And that's what I struggled with a little bit at TwitchCon
8861000	8863000	As well is that
8863000	8865000	I guess I'm surrounded by a lot of famous people
8865000	8867000	But they're just
8867000	8869000	Other con-goers to me
8869000	8871000	I'm not really caught up in that celebrity
8871000	8873000	But at the same time
8873000	8875000	They have no idea what the fuck I'm doing
8875000	8877000	With a podcaster that I'm part of
8877000	8879000	The longest running video game podcast on the internet
8879000	8881000	They don't know that
8881000	8883000	It's this interesting kind of like other side
8883000	8885000	I don't know how to phrase it
8885000	8887000	But yeah
8887000	8889000	I guess that's my very long winded thoughts on that
8889000	8891000	Overall I think it's a good thing
8891000	8893000	It presents a good image
8893000	8895000	For video gaming and gaming culture
8895000	8897000	But I have a really hard time
8897000	8899000	Getting wrapped up in the celebrity
8899000	8901000	And especially over that particular game
8901000	8903000	It's just not one I'm thrilled about
8903000	8905000	But I don't want you to take that as like a negative
8905000	8907000	That I hate it because I don't
8907000	8909000	Okay cool
8909000	8911000	It's just like football
8911000	8913000	I don't hate football, it's just not for me
8913000	8915000	I like hockey though
8915000	8917000	And I bet SSJ100Matt's happy to hear that
8917000	8919000	I like hockey, that I understand
8919000	8921000	So there you go
8921000	8923000	That's my thoughts on the email
8923000	8925000	I don't know if you guys have something to add
8925000	8927000	Or if anybody in chat is saying anything on that
8927000	8929000	Seattle in chat says
8929000	8931000	The only Blizzard game I really really want to play
8931000	8933000	And maybe Starcraft 2
8933000	8935000	I love Diablo 3
8935000	8937000	But like I'm terrible at Starcraft 2
8937000	8939000	I am terrible at it
8939000	8941000	I will say when I've watched the professional Starcraft 2 stuff
8941000	8943000	I'm just like how do they fucking know what to do so fast
8943000	8945000	But then I think back to
8945000	8947000	When you and I
8947000	8949000	All of us here
8949000	8951000	Used to play
8951000	8953000	DDR back at Roseville Golfland
8953000	8955000	And we were doing songs like Orion 7-8
8955000	8957000	With the note chart that's just all the arrows
8957000	8959000	Smashed together
8959000	8961000	Like that's how fast your feet are moving right?
8961000	8963000	And like when people would watch us
8963000	8965000	Play that they were probably like
8965000	8967000	How the hell do they move their feet that fast
8967000	8969000	How do they read that
8969000	8971000	I can't do that anymore
8971000	8973000	But it was practice
8973000	8975000	And a real love of the game
8975000	8977000	And just playing it over and over and over again
8977000	8979000	And so I get it
8979000	8981000	That's what they're doing in Starcraft 2
8981000	8983000	Is that they know all the keyboard shortcuts
8983000	8985000	And that crazy shit because they really love the game
8985000	8987000	And they learned it
8987000	8989000	So anyway
8989000	8991000	That's my thoughts
8991000	8993000	My long winded thoughts as usual
8993000	8995000	I don't know if you guys want to add anything
8995000	8997000	And that was it for email
8997000	8999000	That's it for email that was a long email segment tonight
8999000	9001000	But very good you guys did a very good job tonight
9001000	9003000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com
9003000	9005000	And now
9005000	9007000	That that is over it is time
9007000	9009000	To get a little bit angsty
9009000	9011000	Here at OLR with a segment we call
9011000	9013000	The FUs of the Week
9013000	9015000	And why do we get so angry here at OLR?
9015000	9017000	Well we have issues
9031000	9035000	A major FU to my digestive system
9035000	9037000	I'm sure people remember a couple weeks ago
9037000	9039000	I was out sick
9039000	9041000	Like sick sick
9041000	9043000	Like quarantine sick
9043000	9045000	And it turns out that I still have a problem
9045000	9047000	They actually don't know that because I blamed it
9047000	9049000	On the Jewish holiday that was going on at the time
9049000	9051000	Well I mean that's originally why I was going to be out
9051000	9053000	But it turned out that I ended up being told
9053000	9055000	Don't go out among people
9055000	9057000	Gotcha
9057000	9059000	So I still have the problem
9059000	9061000	For the last week or so
9061000	9063000	I haven't been able to eat more than about
9063000	9065000	600 calories worth of stuff a day
9065000	9067000	Oh my gosh
9067000	9069000	And I've had to go a few days without any coffee
9069000	9071000	Which is difficult
9071000	9073000	So I
9073000	9075000	Yeah, screw it
9075000	9077000	I hate it
9077000	9079000	I like pie and I'm going to eat pie tonight and if it makes me sick
9079000	9081000	Oh well
9081000	9083000	Pie is awesome
9083000	9085000	Loki, how about you?
9085000	9087000	I guess my FU of the Week is going to be going
9087000	9089000	To
9089000	9091000	Just
9091000	9093000	I don't know
9093000	9095000	Not being able to find the right font for my stupid
9095000	9097000	Games logo
9097000	9099000	Because I know what it is
9099000	9101000	Try Papyrus
9101000	9103000	Or Comic Sans
9103000	9105000	Don't you fucking dare
9105000	9107000	Or the best thing I've ever seen called
9107000	9109000	Comic Papyrus
9109000	9111000	Actually I'll show you a funny one
9111000	9113000	Is Comic Slab
9113000	9115000	It's basically Comic Sans
9115000	9117000	But done with a slab serif
9117000	9119000	So it's kind of funny
9119000	9121000	We'll see
9121000	9123000	I will
9123000	9125000	Check those out I guess
9125000	9127000	So that's what I've been working on this week
9127000	9129000	And wasting so much time doing so
9129000	9131000	By the way I have like a million fonts now and none of them
9131000	9133000	Seems to be good enough
9133000	9135000	My FU of the Week
9135000	9137000	Goes to Shane for being an enabler
9137000	9139000	And just watching me spend all that money today
9139000	9141000	And not trying to do anything
9141000	9143000	To stop it
9143000	9145000	That's fair, right?
9145000	9147000	Alright, there it is
9147000	9149000	The FU of the Week segment
9149000	9151000	By the way, Hitstun in chat over at
9151000	9153000	Live.vognetwork.com saying
9153000	9155000	That Hitstun has finished
9155000	9157000	Loki's castle level and saying
9157000	9159000	My FU of the Week goes to Jigsaw's Castle of Carnage
9159000	9161000	So there you go Loki, somebody beat him
9161000	9163000	There you go
9163000	9165000	How many tries did it take you Hitstun?
9165000	9167000	I just want to know
9167000	9169000	Alright, anyhow
9169000	9171000	Let's get to a couple more news stories and then we'll get to the Skype line
9171000	9173000	Which I'm only going to leave open for a little bit tonight
9173000	9175000	So if you want to get through you better be fast
9175000	9177000	And I'll let you know when that's open here in just a moment
9177000	9179000	Now Hitstun says 20 tries
9179000	9181000	That's still really good
9181000	9183000	Yeah, it's better than I did
9183000	9185000	So Jeremy's level is from Koopa Club
9185000	9187000	He did some, I swear to god
9187000	9189000	I died like 70 times on one of them
9189000	9191000	I will have to try this
9191000	9193000	And I was cursing his name in 7 different languages
9193000	9195000	More news stories, Loki
9195000	9197000	Alright, so beat Takashi
9197000	9199000	Is going to be in the new Yakuza game
9199000	9201000	That's pretty cool
9201000	9203000	Let's see
9203000	9205000	Apparently
9205000	9207000	I'm not really sure who
9207000	9209000	Is supposed to be in the actual game here
9209000	9211000	Did you watch the little trailer thing?
9211000	9213000	Nope, I did not
9213000	9215000	Okay, so someone posted on Twitter
9215000	9217000	Just the back of his head
9217000	9219000	And said, guess who's going to be in the next Yakuza game
9219000	9221000	And I was like, oh it's Kitano Takashi
9221000	9223000	And I only knew it from the back of his head
9223000	9225000	But I knew that he also did a bunch of Yakuza movies
9225000	9227000	Like that was his thing
9227000	9229000	And then I saw the little trailer and it's totally his voice
9229000	9231000	So
9231000	9233000	Neat
9233000	9235000	Cool
9235000	9237000	That's all I got
9237000	9239000	I just thought you'd enjoy that because I know you were a big fan of Takashi's castle
9239000	9241000	I was
9241000	9243000	I really wish they'd bring
9243000	9245000	I just
9245000	9247000	That's what I want
9247000	9249000	I want like a channel of just
9249000	9251000	Subtitled
9251000	9253000	Japanese game shows
9253000	9255000	Is that like a thing that can happen?
9255000	9257000	Because I know
9257000	9259000	It's got to be out there
9259000	9261000	Because they used to record that stuff for our Japanese class
9261000	9263000	So I think they have like a local channel
9263000	9265000	In San Francisco or something
9265000	9267000	They've got to have
9267000	9269000	Because we used to watch
9269000	9271000	Furuhata
9271000	9273000	Oh god I love Furuhata
9273000	9275000	There is a channel in the bay area
9275000	9277000	That does all Japanese TV
9277000	9279000	Mostly like dramas and game shows
9279000	9281000	That's what I want
9281000	9283000	Japanese game show channel
9283000	9285000	And I need to watch
9285000	9287000	More Silent Library because that was also funny
9287000	9289000	That was the closest thing I had to a Japanese game
9289000	9291000	Was that the MTV?
9291000	9293000	It was
9293000	9295000	It was so stupid
9295000	9297000	It was like a Japanese game show
9297000	9299000	It was really stupid
9299000	9301000	That show kind of got it
9301000	9303000	When they try to bring that stuff over here
9303000	9305000	Like with the hole in the wall
9305000	9307000	They lose it's charm
9307000	9309000	They're like
9309000	9311000	Oh that's what they did
9311000	9313000	And they just make a really terrible knock off
9313000	9315000	It doesn't have the same
9315000	9317000	I don't know
9317000	9319000	Like seriousness
9319000	9321000	Perfect example
9321000	9323000	Like some of the cooking competition shows
9323000	9325000	In Iron Chef Japan
9325000	9327000	It was very serious
9327000	9329000	And very artful
9329000	9331000	Iron Chef America is like
9331000	9333000	The pompousness
9333000	9335000	And grandstanding of it all is what made that show
9335000	9337000	Great and when they brought it to the US
9337000	9339000	It was kind of like I'm his cousin
9339000	9341000	I do things differently
9341000	9343000	Woo
9343000	9345000	It's sort of
9345000	9347000	It's still good but it lost
9347000	9349000	That charm to it
9349000	9351000	Agree
9351000	9353000	She links us to
9353000	9355000	Actually a pretty awesome movie called Outrage
9355000	9357000	That has
9357000	9359000	Takeshi in it
9359000	9361000	Very cool
9361000	9363000	Alright well one more story for you guys
9363000	9365000	About and some of you might have heard about this
9365000	9367000	But did you know there was an unreleased
9367000	9369000	And unfinished South Park game
9369000	9371000	It was apparently cancelled
9371000	9373000	It was on the Xbox
9373000	9375000	The first Xbox
9375000	9377000	I almost said the Xbox one
9377000	9379000	But I made the first Xbox
9379000	9381000	And yeah if you actually watch some of the video
9381000	9383000	I mean this is a very early build
9383000	9385000	I mean half the town is not even finished
9385000	9387000	But it moves around in a 3D
9387000	9389000	Environment which is very interesting to see
9389000	9391000	And it's not at all like
9391000	9393000	South Park 64
9393000	9395000	Yeah it kind of looks a little more like South Park 64
9395000	9397000	But with better polygons
9397000	9399000	And so forth
9399000	9401000	But it looks like they even had some cut scenes
9401000	9403000	That were in there and some of the voice acting was done
9403000	9405000	There was a workable combat system in place
9405000	9407000	Cartman can actually fight dogs
9407000	9409000	In one part of it
9409000	9411000	So that's kind of neat
9411000	9413000	Buzz Monkey was the studio that made
9413000	9415000	The game and it was eventually snapped up
9415000	9417000	By Zynga and became a part of that collective
9417000	9419000	But the game never happened
9419000	9421000	And I don't know if that's because I think it was a little late
9421000	9423000	In the Xbox's life that this was being put
9423000	9425000	Together and maybe they decided not to do it
9425000	9427000	But we still have the fractured
9427000	9429000	Butthole which I
9429000	9431000	I will never get over that title
9431000	9433000	That is still coming
9433000	9435000	I think I'm going to make that my goal this week
9435000	9437000	To go back and play signature
9437000	9439000	Because I never finished it on Xbox
9439000	9441000	And I need to go play it
9441000	9443000	And finish it before I get to the fractured
9443000	9445000	Butthole
9445000	9447000	Now when they release that are they going to include the first game
9447000	9449000	With that too because I think that's coming out on PlayStation 4
9449000	9451000	Because that would be pretty cool if they did
9451000	9453000	I don't think that's part of the plan
9453000	9455000	Because it's a different studio doing it too
9455000	9457000	That's too bad
9457000	9459000	I think the game itself will be different
9459000	9461000	But as long as, I mean if Trey and Matt are still involved
9461000	9463000	They'll have that same humor
9463000	9465000	Which is usually on point
9465000	9467000	It depends what season it is
9467000	9469000	Sometimes it's on point, sometimes it's
9469000	9471000	I miss a lot of South Park
9471000	9473000	It's one of those shows I forget is on
9473000	9475000	Because it's so infrequent that there's new episodes
9475000	9477000	And then when you happen to see it on TV
9477000	9479000	It's like oh god this episode is ages old
9479000	9481000	But then when you remember
9481000	9483000	Oh yeah there's a new South Park on you watch it
9483000	9485000	Most of the time it's really
9485000	9487000	Really funny and on point
9487000	9489000	I just don't like the multi story arcs
9489000	9491000	They do the four episode long
9491000	9493000	God, one of them they did was awful
9493000	9495000	It was Imaginationland
9495000	9497000	I didn't like that one at all
9497000	9499000	I liked that, that was fine
9499000	9501000	Some of the other ones are coming
9501000	9503000	Exactly, anyway
9503000	9505000	Phone lines are open
9505000	9507000	1-877-GAMELR or our username on Skype
9507000	9509000	OrangeLoungeRadio
9509000	9511000	If you want to give us a call
9511000	9513000	We'll be happy to have you on the show
9513000	9515000	We're only going to keep this open for a little bit
9515000	9517000	So if you want to call
9517000	9519000	Try to get in now
9519000	9521000	It's almost 9 o'clock here on the west coast
9521000	9523000	Which means midnight on the east coast
9523000	9525000	And lucky us we have a call coming in already
9525000	9527000	So let's get to it
9527000	9529000	Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?
9529000	9531000	Hey guys it's Jason
9531000	9533000	Hey Jason, oh my gosh are you driving right now?
9533000	9535000	I am hands free
9535000	9537000	I have my headset in my phone
9537000	9539000	I am in the high country of California
9539000	9541000	Just about to hit Truckee here
9541000	9543000	Probably about the time this call is going to be over
9543000	9545000	No I know you're a good boy
9545000	9547000	And you wouldn't drive
9547000	9549000	And have the hands and all that
9549000	9551000	But I can hear that rushing wind sound
9551000	9553000	Of the car
9553000	9555000	So sad you came right through Sacramento
9555000	9557000	But couldn't stop by tonight because you're on a schedule
9557000	9559000	I understand
9559000	9561000	I'm already a little bit behind because I am
9561000	9563000	A wonderful procrastinator
9563000	9565000	And we'll just leave it at that
9565000	9567000	As long as you waved when you went by Sacramento
9567000	9569000	I absolutely did
9569000	9571000	I saw all the buildings and I was like I think it's that way
9571000	9573000	You
9573000	9575000	You felt my presence
9575000	9577000	As long as that's the case I'm happy
9577000	9579000	What's on your mind tonight? You must be listening in the car
9579000	9581000	What's up?
9581000	9583000	I am here with your weekly
9583000	9585000	Twitch report
9585000	9587000	I think I mentioned
9587000	9589000	Last week that I am
9589000	9591000	Predominantly a variety
9591000	9593000	I follow variety streams
9593000	9595000	The
9595000	9597000	Extent of esports and streaming for me
9597000	9599000	Is I watched a couple of the internationals
9599000	9601000	And then I follow a couple of
9601000	9603000	Speedrunners which are definitely
9603000	9605000	Kind of in the middle ground but they still have their personality
9605000	9607000	That they put into it
9607000	9609000	But I am predominantly a variety caster
9609000	9611000	But I still kind of pay attention to
9611000	9613000	Trends
9613000	9615000	Twitch really likes putting the top games
9615000	9617000	In your face especially on the mobile app
9617000	9619000	That being the default view so you see this kind of stuff
9619000	9621000	And the obvious
9621000	9623000	Trends like variety casters still have
9623000	9625000	Their
9625000	9627000	Trope caliber expectations
9627000	9629000	Everybody's breaking out the scary
9629000	9631000	Games for October
9631000	9633000	Have we covered
9633000	9635000	Until dawn?
9637000	9639000	Whoa what do you mean by covered
9639000	9641000	Because sorry I just dropped my phone
9641000	9643000	Literally while you were talking
9643000	9645000	Was there anything
9645000	9647000	I'm not actually sure how old the game is
9647000	9649000	It's less than a year and a half
9649000	9651000	Because it's modern consoles
9651000	9653000	Was there
9653000	9655000	With Five Nights at Freddy's
9655000	9657000	Kind of
9657000	9659000	Spearheading the fear
9659000	9661000	Of the games and that kind of stuff
9661000	9663000	And everybody trying to be into this space
9663000	9665000	That series
9665000	9667000	Until Dawn
9667000	9669000	Stoma
9669000	9671000	What are some of the newer ones I can't even think of
9671000	9673000	Me personally I follow some stuff with Fatal Frame 5
9673000	9675000	I'll tell you where we're at
9675000	9677000	With Until Dawn is that
9677000	9679000	That game actually only came out probably about six weeks ago
9679000	9681000	It's not an incredibly old game
9681000	9683000	It's been out for about a month
9683000	9685000	And actually I think that was the last livestream
9685000	9687000	I did for my Playstation 4
9687000	9689000	It made me play it
9689000	9691000	And yeah
9691000	9693000	It is another one of those scary games
9693000	9695000	And it's like I just knew
9695000	9697000	Do you want to walk left or walk right
9697000	9699000	And I'm like great
9699000	9701000	Which direction is going to get my head chopped off
9701000	9703000	And which one is going to get me to safety
9703000	9705000	I kind of can't deal with that type of pressure
9705000	9707000	It's scary
9707000	9709000	But yeah
9709000	9711000	You know what's interesting
9711000	9713000	Is I really think Sony wrote that game off
9713000	9715000	I really do
9715000	9717000	They originally wrote that game off
9717000	9719000	And I think it has to do with the performance
9719000	9721000	Of The Order
9721000	9723000	And I don't know what those games have in common
9723000	9725000	Besides the fact that they were both early showcased games
9725000	9727000	For Playstation
9727000	9729000	But I don't think Sony has thrown a lot of oomph behind that game
9729000	9731000	But I think
9731000	9733000	Because of livestreaming
9733000	9735000	In large part
9735000	9737000	I think that game is doing a whole lot better
9737000	9739000	And unfortunately we lost Jason
9739000	9741000	And knowing where he is in California right now
9741000	9743000	If he's coming through Truckee
9743000	9745000	I'm in the mountain ranges of California right now
9745000	9747000	And so I'm actually trying to call him back
9747000	9749000	I don't usually do this
9749000	9751000	But for Jason who does a lot of favors for OLR
9751000	9753000	I will make phone
9753000	9755000	I think we have him back
9755000	9757000	Hi Jason are you back with us
9757000	9759000	Maybe
9759000	9761000	Jason I know you're in the high country in California right now
9761000	9763000	So your signal probably sucks
9763000	9765000	But I'm hoping you understand me
9765000	9767000	So I was just saying that Until Dawn
9767000	9769000	I actually think it's kind of gained that cult status
9769000	9771000	In a way
9771000	9773000	In a big way
9773000	9775000	But I bet that game is doing better than they expected
9775000	9777000	And I actually think livestreaming
9777000	9779000	Absolutely plays into that
9779000	9781000	Because that game does lend itself pretty well
9781000	9783000	Because you know there's people out there going
9783000	9785000	And it's like participating with a bad movie
9785000	9787000	Don't go back there
9787000	9789000	Don't go back there
9789000	9791000	People in the live feed or whatever can scream
9791000	9793000	Don't go left, don't go left
9793000	9795000	And either the person is an idiot and goes left
9795000	9797000	And gets their head chopped off or whatever
9797000	9799000	So anyway
9800000	9802000	Did you have some thoughts on that you wanted to try and get out
9802000	9805000	I was mostly curious about how old it is
9805000	9808000	Because of the variety rounds that it's making right now
9808000	9812000	Like I said I didn't think it was too particularly old
9812000	9818000	And it's strange to think that with the prime season
9818000	9820000	That applies to the theme of the game
9820000	9822000	That they would already kind of like set it aside
9822000	9824000	But I really hope that they've seen successes with it
9824000	9827000	Because the sheer amount of play time
9827000	9833000	I think I saw it at number 25 on the top games on Twitch
9833000	9835000	And you know that kind of stuff
9835000	9840000	It only takes one influential streamer to crack the top 20
9840000	9844000	But certainly with the rotation
9844000	9846000	People saving it closer to Halloween
9846000	9848000	And all that kind of stuff
9848000	9850000	That's a big deal to have that
9853000	9856000	I'm not hearing anything about scary game lineups this year
9856000	9858000	You're cutting out a little bit again
9858000	9861000	But I think especially this really is that time of year for scary game streaming
9861000	9864000	And yeah I think Until Dawn is going to be a part of that
9864000	9866000	I don't know if you heard, not to shift things radically
9866000	9869000	But I don't know if you heard the Jackbox interview earlier in the show
9869000	9872000	But they were talking a little bit about how streaming is really kind of
9872000	9875000	And almost I kind of feel like in that interview
9875000	9880000	Is a part of the reason why You Don't Know Jack isn't a part of this second box
9880000	9884000	Is that well we wanted to focus on games that were better for streaming
9884000	9886000	And multiplayer and so forth
9886000	9888000	And that was kind of a, like it made a lot of sense when he said it
9888000	9891000	And I was like wow that's kind of neat
9891000	9894000	So, anyway
9894000	9896000	I think unfortunately Jason is cutting out again
9896000	9898000	So I'm going to have to go ahead and end the call
9898000	9900000	And just hope that he has a safe drive
9900000	9902000	On his way back there
9902000	9905000	And hopefully he'll be able to hear this on the podcast feed or something else later
9905000	9907000	But I am going to go ahead and open up the Skype line again
9907000	9909000	At 1877 Game OLR
9909000	9911000	Or username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio
9911000	9913000	You know we don't often get called from moving vehicles
9913000	9915000	So that one was a little bit special
9915000	9917000	But anyway it is lighting up again
9917000	9919000	So let's get to the next call
9919000	9921000	Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
9921000	9923000	Hello Rob
9923000	9925000	Hey it's Marissa, how are you?
9925000	9927000	I'm good, how are you?
9927000	9929000	Good, great to hear from you, what's on your mind my friend?
9929000	9931000	I feel very rude
9931000	9933000	Because I only had the opportunity to tune in just now
9933000	9935000	But I'm always happy to hear the show
9935000	9937000	That's okay, it's a long show
9937000	9939000	It's a long commitment to listen to the whole show, I understand
9939000	9941000	That's true
9941000	9943000	Yeah I was out and about also
9943000	9945000	But you were talking about scary games
9945000	9947000	And actually Chris and I have been playing
9947000	9949000	The Walking Dead game together
9949000	9951000	And slowly and surely we've been learning
9951000	9953000	That I'm the more depraved one
9953000	9955000	Based on our decisions
9955000	9957000	So you let that person live
9957000	9959000	You're an asshole
9959000	9961000	We learn new things about each other
9961000	9963000	So in other words
9963000	9965000	With the difficult choices you make in that game
9965000	9967000	For instance, there's some scenes
9967000	9969000	In that game where it's like, do you want to save
9969000	9971000	This person or this person
9971000	9973000	And so you probably, you know, save a person
9973000	9975000	And so Chris will probably
9975000	9977000	You know, be like, why would you want to save that person?
9977000	9979000	Right, you guys kind of get into those type of arguments
9979000	9981000	I've learned that I am a cold ass
9981000	9983000	Motherfucker
9983000	9985000	And my boyfriend
9985000	9987000	Is a sweet, thoughtful man
9987000	9989000	That's what I have learned
9989000	9991000	Like why would you let that person
9991000	9993000	Live, he was an asshole anyway
9993000	9995000	You know
9995000	9997000	He was dead weight, you gotta keep moving honey
9997000	9999000	Now I'm sure you are sweet and thoughtful
9999000	10001000	Aplenty in real life
10001000	10003000	But it's just the video games bring out
10003000	10005000	The worst in you, which is fine
10005000	10007000	It happens to me too
10007000	10009000	Yeah, don't defend the media's position, right?
10009000	10011000	Exactly
10011000	10013000	Actually
10013000	10015000	I did have some
10015000	10017000	Some news too, it's not directly
10017000	10019000	Game related, but for anybody that likes
10019000	10021000	Sci-fi or on the video
10021000	10023000	Game side, for anyone that
10023000	10025000	Really enjoyed The Scarecrow
10025000	10027000	Scarecrow
10027000	10029000	I've had a long day
10029000	10031000	Scarecrow
10031000	10033000	Not the most recent
10033000	10035000	But the previous Batman games
10035000	10037000	Is played by Dino Andrade
10037000	10039000	I'm part of an audio
10039000	10041000	Podcast or radio drama
10041000	10043000	With our friend Ben, who has called in a few times
10043000	10045000	He also hosts the show Port Center
10045000	10047000	On YouTube
10047000	10049000	And we're releasing one a month
10049000	10051000	It's called Jump Leads, it was based on a popular webcomic
10051000	10053000	So I'm excited to announce
10053000	10055000	That for anybody that likes Red Dwarf
10055000	10057000	And Doctor Who
10057000	10059000	And everything British and fun
10059000	10061000	I feel like I've known Dino
10061000	10063000	Online forever
10063000	10065000	We've followed each other on Twitter
10065000	10067000	Since the beginning
10067000	10069000	I missed him at Dragon Con
10069000	10071000	Because you never know what the schedule
10071000	10073000	Is actually going to be
10073000	10075000	I've got to message him offline
10075000	10077000	Now that things have calmed down a bit
10077000	10079000	Hopefully with convention season
10079000	10081000	And try to get him on the show
10081000	10083000	He's one of the best voice actors here
10083000	10085000	At Orange Launch Radio
10085000	10087000	Have you guys talked about the strike?
10087000	10089000	We brought it up last week
10089000	10091000	I wasn't sure if I wanted to go there with you
10091000	10093000	But since you said it
10093000	10095000	I'm going to go there
10095000	10097000	I actually did repost
10097000	10099000	The thing with the terms of the strike
10099000	10101000	And the link to vote on it
10101000	10103000	On my public Facebook
10103000	10105000	My understanding is that
10105000	10107000	They've gone radio silent on that
10107000	10109000	We know it's a possibility
10109000	10111000	We don't know if it's actually happening
10111000	10113000	Or not yet, right?
10113000	10115000	Yeah, it's been pretty quiet
10115000	10117000	And you know
10117000	10119000	It's funny because out of all the nuances
10119000	10121000	Of the whole argument
10121000	10123000	The only thing that I find the most interesting
10123000	10125000	Were people talking about other sides of the industry
10125000	10127000	Not perhaps being fairly compensated
10127000	10129000	And why should you worry about the actors
10129000	10131000	First, and I kind of thought
10131000	10133000	So you're saying that everyone should just be equally
10133000	10135000	Screwed?
10135000	10137000	You know what?
10137000	10139000	I think a lot of the concerns
10139000	10141000	And I'm not going to be one to get into the money
10141000	10143000	Because I don't know how that all works
10143000	10145000	But as far as the whole
10145000	10147000	Having certain rules
10147000	10149000	Like going into the studio and screaming
10149000	10151000	For four hours on end
10151000	10153000	What's funny is that when you helped us out
10153000	10155000	And we got Greg
10155000	10157000	And those guys on the show
10157000	10159000	The fact that they were talking about
10159000	10161000	Oh, does your agent make sure that you only get the two
10161000	10163000	It kind of dawned on me
10163000	10165000	Oh yeah, not everybody gets that
10166000	10168000	So kind of setting those sort of
10168000	10170000	What are essentially safety
10170000	10172000	Safe working conditions
10172000	10174000	I think is more than fair
10174000	10176000	So for that side of things
10176000	10178000	And again, I'm not going to get into the money things
10178000	10180000	I just don't know
10180000	10182000	But as far as those safety conditions
10182000	10184000	That seems awfully reasonable
10184000	10186000	It is, you know I did
10186000	10190000	I've done things where I've blown out my voice
10190000	10192000	I didn't have certainly any protections like that
10193000	10195000	People think that
10195000	10197000	This is a problem that just doesn't affect just acting
10197000	10200000	But any career where there's some sort of artistic end to it
10200000	10203000	They think because you get some sort of satisfaction out of it
10203000	10205000	That it's okay
10205000	10207000	Or it's not a big deal
10207000	10209000	Well yeah, it's not okay if you scream once
10209000	10211000	But if you scream for four hours
10211000	10213000	You can ruin your instrument
10213000	10215000	And video games
10215000	10217000	For actors it can be
10217000	10219000	One of the most rewarding
10219000	10221000	Because of the amount of dialogue
10221000	10224000	And story can also be one of the most grueling
10224000	10226000	But you know
10226000	10228000	On the money thing
10228000	10230000	Regardless of the specifics
10230000	10232000	People deserve to be compensated
10232000	10234000	Fairly for their time
10234000	10236000	No matter what their job is
10236000	10238000	Of course
10238000	10240000	This also goes out to all my friends
10240000	10242000	That are graphic designers
10242000	10244000	People that work in fields
10244000	10246000	That involve computers
10246000	10248000	Or musicians or photographers
10248000	10250000	Where people go
10250000	10252000	My nephew is good with computers
10252000	10254000	So I'll just have them do it
10254000	10256000	You want things done right
10256000	10258000	You need skilled, hardworking people
10258000	10260000	And I've heard most often
10260000	10262000	The argument about how
10262000	10264000	Certain sides of the video game industry
10264000	10266000	Aren't fairly compensated
10266000	10268000	Well everybody should be then
10268000	10270000	I know what to tell you
10270000	10272000	There's a lot of people
10272000	10274000	There's a lot of people out there that say
10274000	10276000	Well if the voice actors just go on strike
10276000	10278000	And do it for free
10278000	10280000	But you are right in that regard
10280000	10282000	That well you'll get what you pay for
10282000	10284000	And we'll be back in the era of 90's CD-ROM games
10284000	10286000	When the acting wasn't quite what it is today
10286000	10288000	If that makes sense
10288000	10290000	Well you know that's
10290000	10292000	That's kind of affected
10292000	10294000	The industry as a whole
10294000	10296000	I mean again it's not just voice acting
10296000	10298000	That's been affected by this proliferation of
10298000	10300000	Competition for jobs on the internet
10300000	10302000	And driving down of prices
10302000	10304000	But you know that aside
10304000	10306000	It is interesting when I see people that say that
10306000	10308000	Well I'll just do it for really cheap
10308000	10310000	And then I'm going to get this great exposure
10310000	10312000	And this great gig
10312000	10314000	Well that's wonderful but
10314000	10316000	That sustaining career that you want
10316000	10318000	Isn't going to be there for you then
10318000	10320000	At the end of the day
10320000	10322000	So you're like
10322000	10324000	Oh I'll do this thing really cheap right now
10324000	10326000	And that's going to give me all the exposure I need
10326000	10328000	And that's going to skyrocket me to the top
10328000	10330000	When I'm going to do what I love for a living
10330000	10332000	But if you do that then that career isn't going to exist
10332000	10334000	Well I hope they can
10334000	10336000	I hope they can all work it out
10336000	10338000	I hope they can hug it out
10338000	10340000	And figure this stuff out
10340000	10342000	And you have some support in chat
10342000	10344000	In our chatroom over at live.fognetwork.com
10344000	10346000	I'm definitely with Marissa on this one
10346000	10348000	And Dungeon Buster says that could be the future
10348000	10350000	Without skilled voice actors
10350000	10352000	Not even the 90's look up
10352000	10354000	Chaos Wars voice acting on Google or YouTube
10354000	10356000	Classic 90's bad acting
10356000	10358000	Resident Evil nuff said says Raginator
10358000	10360000	Anyway
10360000	10362000	You know what? This is easy
10362000	10364000	So you deserve to be played less
10364000	10366000	Yeah but I
10366000	10368000	I mentioned this last week on the show
10368000	10370000	When I've done Rocky Horror and emceed that show
10370000	10372000	And I'm on stage for maybe 20-30 minutes
10372000	10374000	And I'm kind of yelling
10374000	10376000	Then I come in
10376000	10378000	By the way I have a show I should plug this
10378000	10380000	Because I didn't earlier
10380000	10382000	But for those that do happen to be local here in Sacramento
10382000	10384000	I am going to be hosting Rocky Horror at the Colonial
10384000	10386000	On Saturday at I think 10.30 pm
10386000	10388000	As part of the 9th annual Sacramento Horror Film Festival
10388000	10390000	I've been fortunate enough to be asked back to do that
10390000	10392000	But when I come in here next week
10392000	10394000	You guys should fully expect
10394000	10396000	Hi everybody this is Rob Roberts
10396000	10398000	Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio
10398000	10400000	I just smoked four packs and came on air
10400000	10402000	That's what it's going to be
10402000	10404000	Yeah and sometimes you know
10404000	10406000	This can be complete BS
10406000	10408000	But to me it always seems that
10408000	10410000	When I run my voice ragged
10410000	10412000	It makes me more vulnerable to sickness
10412000	10414000	Yeah and I'm worried about that
10414000	10416000	Because there's something going around
10416000	10418000	Anytime you wear your body down
10418000	10420000	You're making it more vulnerable to sickness
10420000	10422000	Anyway Marissa I hate to do this
10422000	10424000	But I got to wrap up so we can wrap up the show
10424000	10426000	Because we're running a little long
10426000	10428000	Thank you so much for the call
10428000	10430000	It's always good to hear from you
10430000	10432000	Alright take care
10432000	10434000	Alright I think that is actually going to do it for the skype line tonight
10434000	10436000	Because I know Jamie wants to go get pie
10436000	10438000	And I have some other things I want to take care of around here
10438000	10440000	We are after midnight on the east coast
10440000	10442000	So I want to go ahead and move to wrap things up
10442000	10444000	But I do want to check in and make sure
10444000	10446000	Are there any last minute stories or things we want to bring up here?
10446000	10448000	Crowdfunding started for them's fighting herds
10448000	10450000	So if you want to back that
10450000	10452000	You can check that out on Indiegogo
10452000	10454000	That's right I remember hearing about that a couple weeks ago
10454000	10456000	They're already at about
10456000	10458000	Just over halfway
10458000	10460000	About 200,000 from goal
10460000	10462000	With 17 days left
10462000	10464000	Nice
10464000	10466000	Alright
10466000	10468000	If that's it for last minute stories
10468000	10470000	There was one other thing I saw
10470000	10472000	They have more
10472000	10474000	They have more footage
10474000	10476000	Of an unreleased Nintendo 64 game
10476000	10478000	It was a sequel to the Neo Geo
10478000	10480000	Shooter Viewpoint
10480000	10482000	Called Viewpoint 2064
10482000	10484000	Yeah
10484000	10486000	It's kind of random
10486000	10488000	I guess it was from a prototype
10488000	10490000	Cartridge that someone bought on eBay
10490000	10492000	I'm liking all these
10492000	10494000	Unreleased games
10494000	10496000	Unearthed prototypes
10496000	10498000	It's always kind of fun to see what we might have missed out on
10498000	10500000	Alright
10500000	10502000	Well we're going to wind down here for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio
10502000	10504000	But hey I want to really thank you guys

10512000	10514000	If you liked what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio
10514000	10516000	Please consider telling a friend or two
10516000	10518000	About the show because word of mouth is really all we have
10518000	10520000	We'd appreciate a tweet
10520000	10522000	You want to tweet? Hey guys listen to OLR
10522000	10524000	We would love that so much, thank you so much

10526000	10528000	On iTunes or Stitcher Radio
10528000	10530000	I know all your favorite podcasts ask you
10530000	10532000	But we're all asking you for a reason
10532000	10534000	Because it goes a long way
10534000	10536000	So we really appreciate that
10536000	10538000	And that is going to bring us to a close
10538000	10540000	Here at another week of Orange Lounge Radio
10540000	10542000	Great show tonight everybody
10542000	10544000	Thank you Steve-O from Jackbox Games
10544000	10546000	For coming on the show tonight
10546000	10548000	And I want to thank Evan over at Jackbox Games
10548000	10550000	For helping to arrange that
10550000	10552000	So thank you very much
10552000	10554000	Big thanks to Jackbox Games
10554000	10556000	For supporting the show
10556000	10558000	Best of luck with Jackbox Party Pack 2
10558000	10560000	I know I will be there checking that out
10560000	10562000	As will I'm sure most of us here in studio
10562000	10564000	And our listenership out there
10564000	10566000	So it's time to go around
10566000	10568000	And get everybody's final thought
10568000	10570000	Tonight here on the show
10570000	10572000	Darce Agro we haven't heard from you in a little bit
10572000	10574000	We'll start with you, what's your final thought here tonight?
10574000	10576000	I'm Mrs. Marissa
10576000	10578000	Me too, I haven't been to Southern California
10578000	10580000	In a long time
10580000	10582000	Let's just go, except I feel depressed going down
10582000	10584000	And also not going to Disneyland
10584000	10586000	It's that whole new job time off thing
10586000	10588000	I can't get time off until December
10590000	10592000	Let's all just meet up at the Bravo Cheese Farm
10592000	10594000	There you go, meet halfway
10594000	10596000	Alright
10596000	10598000	Let's see, my final thought tonight
10598000	10600000	I want to wish a happy early
10600000	10602000	500th episode of Bobby Black Wolf
10602000	10604000	Because next week is his 500th episode
10604000	10606000	So tonight was $4.99
10606000	10608000	And I just want to make sure I did not forget
10608000	10610000	To give him his kudos where it's due
10610000	10612000	Bobby Black Wolf is
10612000	10614000	A big reason why O.L.R. is still going
10614000	10616000	After all these years because there was a period of time
10616000	10618000	Where we were going to
10618000	10620000	Not be a live show anymore
10620000	10622000	And Bobby helped save that
10622000	10624000	So we were able to do live
10624000	10626000	We were going to be a dead show
10626000	10628000	I don't know if we were going to be dead
10628000	10630000	But it would just be a very different show
10630000	10632000	So thank you Bobby for keeping it live
10632000	10634000	Congrats to the discipline it's taken you
10634000	10636000	To get all the way to 500 episodes
10636000	10638000	Last but not least, Loki
10638000	10640000	Your final thought tonight
10640000	10642000	I don't know
10642000	10644000	I'm thinking
10644000	10646000	I'm at that awkward point where you decide whether or not
10646000	10648000	You're going to make a costume for Halloween
10648000	10650000	And you know instead
10650000	10652000	Much like my game project
10652000	10654000	Instead of doing something simple
10654000	10656000	It's either extremely complicated or nothing
10656000	10658000	In the wise words of one
10658000	10660000	Shia LaBeouf
10660000	10662000	Do it!
10662000	10664000	Just do it!
10664000	10666000	So I guess we're being
10666000	10668000	Listened to by Becky and Julian
10668000	10670000	Oh are we?
10670000	10672000	If Mother approves
10672000	10674000	Because sometimes we get a little R-rated
10674000	10676000	But I guess we can watch our F and Mals
10676000	10678000	While Julian's here
10678000	10680000	We can try
10680000	10682000	There you go, so we'll try
10682000	10684000	Well I have to know, what game is Julian going to talk about?
10684000	10686000	Probably Pirates 101 and Lego something
10686000	10688000	That's fine, oh is he playing that new Lego game too?
10688000	10690000	No I don't think Dimensions
10690000	10692000	We should do a show
10692000	10694000	Where we can bring the kids on
10694000	10696000	My son would love to talk about Minecraft
10696000	10698000	Or whatever it is, the Lego game
10698000	10700000	Bring your kid to OLR
10700000	10702000	It's just like, alright let's do it
10702000	10704000	You know what, I just say
10704000	10706000	Maybe for April Fools next year we'll just let them host
10708000	10710000	He gets kind of shy so
10710000	10712000	I don't know, we'll see
10712000	10714000	That would be funny
10714000	10716000	I think the listeners would love that
10716000	10718000	I think they would love that, so we'll have to make that happen
10718000	10720000	In a few weeks, so there you go
10720000	10722000	S2100Matt says if we've done a drunk show
10722000	10724000	We could do a kids show
10724000	10726000	And ActDef says, OLR
10726000	10728000	Kid tested, mother approved
10728000	10730000	I think I just got another text
10730000	10732000	Just open that up with the themes from Wonder Shows
10732000	10734000	So we get
10734000	10736000	LOL Minecraft
10736000	10738000	You know what, you can never talk enough Minecraft
10738000	10740000	So now I have to go over to Becky's and have a cookie
10740000	10742000	Alright sounds good, have two cookies
10742000	10744000	One for me
10744000	10746000	That's going to do it, thank you guys so much
10746000	10748000	For listening to Orange Lounge Radio
10748000	10750000	And supporting independent broadcasting
10750000	10752000	We'll be back to do it again in seven days
10752000	10754000	We'll see you then, have a great week everybody
10754000	10756000	Good night
10782000	10784000	See you next week
10812000	10814000	Thanks for watching!
