00:24.080 --> 00:27.800

00:27.800 --> 00:33.200
Orange Lounge Radio Hello my friends out there on the internet

00:33.200 --> 00:36.620
and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.620 --> 00:45.080
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this October the 18th of 2015 with episode number 618 of

00:45.080 --> 00:46.180
our show.

00:46.180 --> 00:52.320
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me on Twitter as Skye and joining me as always

00:52.320 --> 00:55.320
say hello over there to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:55.320 --> 00:56.320
Hi.

00:56.320 --> 00:57.320
How are you DarkSakura?

00:57.320 --> 00:58.320
Gassy.

00:58.320 --> 00:59.320
Gassy?

00:59.320 --> 01:03.160
No, I've been drinking this Yarritos tamarind soda.

01:03.160 --> 01:04.160
Yarritos!

01:04.160 --> 01:11.920
And I've been burping like I've been on a beer binge like you wouldn't believe.

01:11.920 --> 01:12.920
TMI.

01:12.920 --> 01:14.040
But you know what?

01:14.040 --> 01:15.160
I'm just keeping it real.

01:15.160 --> 01:19.160
I did not know it was like Mexican food night here at Studio OLR, it's like a fiesta here

01:19.160 --> 01:20.160
in Studio.

01:20.160 --> 01:21.720
You're not the only one that brought that tonight.

01:21.720 --> 01:26.360
Except for the like grouchy old white guy I elbowed at El Forestero.

01:26.360 --> 01:28.000
You almost got in a fight.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.160
No, I just caught him on being a rude entitled shit.

01:31.160 --> 01:34.360
I keep it real Rob, I keep it real.

01:34.360 --> 01:37.520
DarkSakura tried to start a fight at the local taqueria.

01:37.520 --> 01:41.080
Anyway, also say hello to of course the one guy who didn't bring Mexican food.

01:41.080 --> 01:42.080
Say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:42.080 --> 01:43.920
No, I tried pileology instead.

01:43.920 --> 01:47.640
Yeah, that's one of those pizza places where they put the pizza in the oven, like the ultra

01:47.640 --> 01:49.560
hot oven for just like two minutes, right?

01:49.560 --> 01:51.040
Yeah, it was quick.

01:51.080 --> 01:54.440
I mean it's basically you pick what toppings you want, I mean like any other pizza place,

01:54.440 --> 01:55.840
but they kind of make it in front of you.

01:55.840 --> 01:59.520
Yeah, I headed a place just like that in Boston, actually, for when I was there this year.

01:59.520 --> 02:03.680
I'm like, I don't know what I want when I went in there, I'm like, ehhh, pepperoni.

02:03.680 --> 02:04.680
That pepperoni?

02:04.680 --> 02:08.280
If you guys didn't know, Loki's a very picky eater, so he has to...

02:08.280 --> 02:11.320
Well, I wanted to put a bunch of stuff on there, but I was like, you know, if I put

02:11.320 --> 02:17.480
bacon and pepperoni on there, it just, it's doesn't kind of go, it's like too much almost.

02:17.480 --> 02:21.560
I don't like, you know, like combination pizzas too much because it's just a lot of

02:21.560 --> 02:23.200
toppings and stuff, so...

02:23.200 --> 02:25.640
It's kind of salad on a pizza, and it's a lot.

02:25.640 --> 02:30.280
I just wanted like, I don't know, I wanted them to dump the whole tray of bacon on it,

02:30.280 --> 02:34.920
but they wouldn't do that, so I was like, fine, I'll do pepperoni and garlic.

02:34.920 --> 02:37.480
Could I get a scoop of pepperoni and a tray of bacon?

02:37.480 --> 02:40.520
You have more in the back, we're going to need more.

02:40.520 --> 02:41.520
Can you order more?

02:41.520 --> 02:42.520
Can I get it here now?

02:42.520 --> 02:43.520
I love it.

02:43.560 --> 02:47.520
All right, well of course we are here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the

02:47.520 --> 02:53.080
gamer lifestyle as we do every Sunday night at the Voice of the Geek's Network, vognetwork.com.

02:53.080 --> 02:57.960
Real quick, I was kind of on the scene, sorry, but like seriously, yesterday I was grocery

02:57.960 --> 03:01.360
shopping and they have like, you know, the bacon packages, little bacon bit packages

03:01.360 --> 03:06.040
and stuff, and there's a little thing on it, it's like, you know, now it's six ounces with

03:06.040 --> 03:09.840
even more bacon to love, I'm like, with even more bacon to love, like it literally exclaimed

03:09.840 --> 03:13.000
that out in the supermarket.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.720
Is it just a picture of a pig saying, let me love you?

03:15.720 --> 03:20.720
Anyway, how dare, yeah, if you are listening live and you want to yell at Loki for interrupting

03:20.720 --> 03:25.560
your plug, join our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com because of course we do tape live at the

03:25.560 --> 03:29.040

03:29.040 --> 03:31.720

03:31.720 --> 03:34.960
But we are joined not just by you guys in our chat room and us here in studio, but we

03:34.960 --> 03:38.440
have some special guests here in studio with us tonight.

03:38.440 --> 03:44.040
It just, it ended up being a fiesta tonight and they brought Taco Bell to make it complete,

03:44.040 --> 03:47.560
even though we all know that's not real Mexican food, but say hello.

03:47.560 --> 03:51.960
Joining us again and we appreciate when he drops in every now and again.

03:51.960 --> 03:55.400
Say hello everybody to VOG super fan, Flaco Jones.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.400
Hello.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.400
Hey Flaco.

03:57.400 --> 03:58.400
Hi everybody.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.400
How you doing?

03:59.400 --> 04:00.400
I'm doing great.

04:00.400 --> 04:01.400
How are you doing?

04:01.400 --> 04:03.400
I'm, I'm well, actually I had a fantastic day yesterday, but I'll get into that.

04:03.400 --> 04:04.400
That's great.

04:04.400 --> 04:05.400
Yeah.

04:05.400 --> 04:06.400
How about you?

04:06.400 --> 04:07.400
Are you having a super weekend?

04:07.400 --> 04:08.400
I'm having a super weekend.

04:08.400 --> 04:09.720
It's been really, it's been really cool.

04:09.720 --> 04:10.720
All right.

04:10.720 --> 04:13.640
I went up all the way up to Lake County to see my family and usually that's not a great

04:13.640 --> 04:15.960
experience, but it was fun and it's so nice up there.

04:15.960 --> 04:16.960
Yeah.

04:16.960 --> 04:18.700
The Lake over there, it's kind of smells funny.

04:18.700 --> 04:21.200
It's it's, yeah, I grew up with it, so I'm used to that.

04:21.200 --> 04:26.000
Now, now I'm sorry to get super serious, but I know that that County was really affected

04:26.000 --> 04:29.040
by some fires recently, but I'm assuming your family didn't get it.

04:29.040 --> 04:30.040
No, no.

04:30.040 --> 04:31.040
They're in the North County.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.040
All the fires have been in the South County.

04:32.040 --> 04:35.260
So we did drive through like an area that was totally scorched.

04:35.260 --> 04:36.260
So it's kind of sad.

04:36.260 --> 04:39.260
And this signs up everywhere, you know, you know, thanks for, you know, first responders

04:39.260 --> 04:41.900
and thanks, you know, firefighters who did all the hard work.

04:41.900 --> 04:42.900
So this signs up everywhere.

04:42.900 --> 04:47.380
Well, and it's tough because believe it or not, we're actually getting rain now in California,

04:47.380 --> 04:48.380
which is nice.

04:48.380 --> 04:49.380
Yeah.

04:49.380 --> 04:50.380
It rained on the way up there.

04:50.380 --> 04:51.380
That's pretty cool.

04:51.380 --> 04:52.380
I was like, what?

04:52.380 --> 04:53.380
What is this stuff?

04:53.380 --> 04:54.380
But for those fire stricken areas that just causes the mud.

04:54.380 --> 04:55.380
Yeah.

04:55.380 --> 04:56.380
Then there's gonna be landslides and stuff.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.220
It's really sad because all the vegetation's gone.

04:58.220 --> 04:59.660
It's just, it's all dirt now.

04:59.660 --> 05:00.660
It's pretty bad.

05:00.660 --> 05:01.660
So yeah, definitely.

05:01.660 --> 05:03.060
Sorry to bring everybody down guys.

05:03.060 --> 05:04.060
I know.

05:04.060 --> 05:05.060
Fires are bad.

05:05.060 --> 05:06.060
You know, good awareness.

05:06.060 --> 05:07.060
Yeah, that's true.

05:07.060 --> 05:08.060
We need the help.

05:08.060 --> 05:10.300
So if, you know, you feel like making a donation to red cross.

05:10.300 --> 05:14.180
One of the places that burned up like a, there's this forest up there in your middle town.

05:14.180 --> 05:15.940
I used to go camping with my buddies up there.

05:15.940 --> 05:20.140
We would just go out in the middle of forest and you know, go camp out overnight and that

05:20.140 --> 05:21.780
place totally is gone.

05:21.780 --> 05:25.100
There's like a hot Springs up there that's famous for like a nudist colony.

05:25.100 --> 05:26.100
It's gone.

05:26.100 --> 05:27.100
Pictures of that one.

05:27.100 --> 05:28.100
It was really sad.

05:28.100 --> 05:29.100
Oh yeah.

05:29.100 --> 05:30.100
Yeah.

05:30.100 --> 05:31.100
The Harbin hot Springs.

05:31.100 --> 05:32.100
Yeah.

05:32.100 --> 05:33.100
Not the nudist colony.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.100
I know.

05:34.140 --> 05:37.380
They may learn that taking carbon baths are healthy and good for the skin.

05:37.380 --> 05:38.380
Yeah.

05:38.380 --> 05:39.380
There you go.

05:39.380 --> 05:42.540
So it's, it's, it's really sad to see the pictures like, Oh, I used to drive through

05:42.540 --> 05:43.540
it all the time.

05:43.540 --> 05:47.100
My friends are all live there, but they all have moved out since nobody I knew was really

05:47.100 --> 05:48.100
affected anymore.

05:48.100 --> 05:49.100
They don't like it.

05:49.100 --> 05:50.100
Their family home.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.100
They was like, Oh, that's where I grew up.

05:51.100 --> 05:52.100
It's gone now.

05:52.100 --> 05:53.100
But they're like, Oh, but we moved on.

05:53.100 --> 05:54.100
I know.

05:54.100 --> 05:55.100
It's kind of sad to think that way.

05:55.100 --> 05:56.100
That's what he said.

05:56.100 --> 05:57.100
I like, I called my friend.

05:57.100 --> 05:59.940
I'm like, did you like, so your family home burned down, right?

05:59.940 --> 06:00.940
He's like, yeah, yeah.

06:00.940 --> 06:01.940
I was in the area.

06:01.940 --> 06:02.940
Like, wow.

06:02.980 --> 06:04.300
But I don't really go up there anymore.

06:04.300 --> 06:06.580
So there's not a lot of people.

06:06.580 --> 06:10.460
I lived in the same house for like 18 years, so I never moved as a kid.

06:10.460 --> 06:12.540
So my house, my family home burned down.

06:12.540 --> 06:16.940
I'd be like, so sad without like giving away addresses here on the show.

06:16.940 --> 06:22.540
But my, the house I grew up in is in Roseville and it's not that far off the beaten path.

06:22.540 --> 06:27.160
So once in a great while, I'll still drive by it just to say, Oh, check in, see how it,

06:27.160 --> 06:28.160
how it looks these days.

06:28.160 --> 06:31.740
I'm like, everything looks smaller now that I'm by.

06:31.740 --> 06:32.740
What is this?

06:32.740 --> 06:33.740
Like the nineties.

06:33.740 --> 06:38.940
This is what Google maps is for from a satellite.

06:38.940 --> 06:43.740
I don't have to drive all the way like where I grew up to look at my hands and hand view.

06:43.740 --> 06:44.840
It's not the same.

06:44.840 --> 06:47.740
So of course we have a comment from our chat room with Falco Jones being here.

06:47.740 --> 06:52.960
We have SSU 100 Matt and our chat room says, Flaco Jones, hopefully nothing breaks or area

06:52.960 --> 06:53.960
blackout tonight.

06:53.960 --> 06:54.960
Yeah, I know.

06:54.960 --> 06:55.960
You never know.

06:55.960 --> 06:56.960
It's starting to rain.

06:56.960 --> 06:58.140
California doesn't know how to handle rain.

06:58.140 --> 06:59.140
Everything shorts out.

06:59.140 --> 07:00.140
We never know.

07:00.140 --> 07:01.140
You know what happens?

07:01.540 --> 07:02.540
Yeah.

07:02.540 --> 07:03.540
All right.

07:03.540 --> 07:06.180
Well also, also a welcome back to the show two weeks in a row.

07:06.180 --> 07:07.180
Look at us.

07:07.180 --> 07:08.180
Say hello to Shana.

07:08.180 --> 07:09.180
Linko.

07:09.180 --> 07:10.180
Hi.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.180
How are you?

07:11.180 --> 07:12.180
Fine.

07:12.180 --> 07:13.180
Yep.

07:13.180 --> 07:14.180
Yeah.

07:14.180 --> 07:15.180
How's power Rangers?

07:15.180 --> 07:16.180
Really good.

07:16.180 --> 07:17.180
Yeah.

07:17.180 --> 07:18.180
Yeah.

07:18.180 --> 07:19.180
So today you and I went on a shopping adventure.

07:19.180 --> 07:20.180
Yeah.

07:20.180 --> 07:23.060
So I got that retron five a couple of weeks ago, which I think I talked about on air.

07:23.060 --> 07:24.060
Right.

07:24.060 --> 07:28.840
But I need like, I have a few super Nintendo games and a couple of NES games, but you know,

07:28.840 --> 07:32.240
my collection from when I was a kid, Lord knows what it's probably still at my childhood

07:32.240 --> 07:34.380
home or something, but Lord knows what that stuff is.

07:34.380 --> 07:40.260
So I have to kind of build, I have to build something that's even like a 10th of an impressive

07:40.260 --> 07:42.080
as Jamie's collection is.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.960
So I want to go buy some games.

07:43.960 --> 07:50.720
So we went to a local flea market today and I wasn't, I was kind of disappointed.

07:50.720 --> 07:51.720
I don't know.

07:51.720 --> 07:52.720
I thought a lot of...

07:52.720 --> 07:53.720
Disappointed in their prices.

07:53.720 --> 07:57.640
A little bit, the prices a little bit, just the condition of all the cartridges like look

07:57.640 --> 07:59.480
like they'd been out in the sun forever.

07:59.480 --> 08:03.440
And I was just like, the flea market was a really scary place, so it doesn't surprise

08:03.440 --> 08:04.440
me.

08:04.440 --> 08:05.440
It was.

08:05.440 --> 08:06.440
And you saw a knockoff power Rangers.

08:06.440 --> 08:07.440
Yeah.

08:07.440 --> 08:08.440
It was like Dino superheroes.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.760
I love the knockoff toys.

08:10.760 --> 08:11.760
Those are the best.

08:11.760 --> 08:16.640
They're like the ones that they have, like Spiderman, like Raphael from the Ninja turtles,

08:16.640 --> 08:19.540
a power ranger, a transformer.

08:19.540 --> 08:22.680
It's like some weird, it made me sad.

08:22.680 --> 08:25.760
There's so much awesome bootleg stuff at a flea market though, but it was really crowded

08:25.760 --> 08:26.760
today.

08:26.880 --> 08:28.240
The weather's like perfect right now.

08:28.240 --> 08:31.680
It's like, you know, that kind of overcast 70 degrees.

08:31.680 --> 08:32.680
It's a good day to be outside.

08:32.680 --> 08:35.240
The one I miss going to, and I used to do it all the time because I used to live down

08:35.240 --> 08:37.120
there was the San Jose flea market.

08:37.120 --> 08:39.560
Man, that flea market was enormous.

08:39.560 --> 08:42.760
Well the one on Roseville is pretty impressive.

08:42.760 --> 08:45.320
This is way huger.

08:45.320 --> 08:46.320
Way huger?

08:46.320 --> 08:47.320
Yes, way huger.

08:47.320 --> 08:49.000
That's proper English.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.920
So it's, it's awesome.

08:50.920 --> 08:51.920
Awesome.

08:51.920 --> 08:54.840
I remember you said like, it was so big, they had parking across the street and you had

08:54.840 --> 08:58.640
to walk under the street to get to the flea market.

08:58.640 --> 08:59.640
That's where I buy all my NES titles.

08:59.640 --> 09:03.600
Yeah, I was going to say, now I want to go to the other flea market in town to see if

09:03.600 --> 09:08.800
maybe I can find some good deals, because I did get Clue on Super Nintendo at the other

09:08.800 --> 09:11.880
flea market a few years ago, and that was kind of awesome.

09:11.880 --> 09:17.280
And I see TigerClan chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, Sky needs to stream on Twitch with the

09:17.280 --> 09:19.600
Retron 5, got to revisit some of those old games.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.360
I actually, I really do, and I was playing with it a little bit today.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.120
I thought the quality was pretty darn good.

09:24.120 --> 09:25.920
Yeah, it looked pretty good.

09:25.920 --> 09:29.720
And I told, I told him that all he has to do is just stream Super Metroid because it's

09:29.720 --> 09:31.400
the only game that's worth streaming.

09:31.400 --> 09:34.400
I do have my Super Metroid cartridge, you know I still have that, so that'll be one

09:34.400 --> 09:35.400
of the first.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.400
That'll be one of the first.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.400
But the game you saw today, I think I'll stream first.

09:38.400 --> 09:39.400
Oh.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.400
Well, that's one of my favorites.

09:41.400 --> 09:42.400
Anyway.

09:42.400 --> 09:43.400
Alright, whatever.

09:43.400 --> 09:51.640
Okay, so we're going to get into tonight's show with the kickoff topic first, and today,

09:51.640 --> 09:56.040
if you didn't already know, actual today that we're taping the show, October 18th,

09:56.040 --> 10:02.120
is the 30th anniversary of the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System in America.

10:02.120 --> 10:05.960
So even though, you know, some, because you probably are thinking, wait a minute, how

10:05.960 --> 10:10.240
did we celebrate 30 years of Super Mario Brothers, well, because that was all by the Japanese

10:10.240 --> 10:11.240
days.

10:11.240 --> 10:16.680
So, because the NES or the Famicom was out in Japan, I think in 83, but it came out here

10:16.680 --> 10:20.080
in the States in 85, October 18th, 1985.

10:20.080 --> 10:24.240
So today we're looking back on 30 years of the Nintendo Entertainment System.

10:24.240 --> 10:27.880
Later in the show, we're actually going to play a listless game around this.

10:27.880 --> 10:31.440
If you've never heard us do listless before, stay tuned, we're going to get into that in

10:31.440 --> 10:32.840
Part B tonight.

10:32.840 --> 10:36.520
I should also say here at the top of the show, I was going to get into this in housekeeping,

10:36.520 --> 10:40.360
but I want to make sure we get a plug for this, because this is a pretty big deal.

10:40.360 --> 10:45.320
We have a cool little exclusive interview from our correspondent, DJ Rama, from Anime

10:45.320 --> 10:51.920
Jam Session, is actually going to bring us an interview he did tonight with Kyle Hebert,

10:51.920 --> 10:55.600
and you may not know the name, but he's a voice actor and he's done a lot of big stuff,

10:55.600 --> 11:00.440
including he's the voice of Ryu in like Street Fighter IV and, you know, Smash Brothers and

11:00.440 --> 11:01.440
all that.

11:01.440 --> 11:04.320
So he's got a pretty impressive resume when it comes to anime and games.

11:04.320 --> 11:08.640
So DJ Rama S will be bringing us that interview a little later in the show.

11:08.640 --> 11:09.640
So we'll get to that.

11:09.640 --> 11:12.480
But anyway, sorry for the tangent, but I want to make sure that got a shout out towards

11:12.480 --> 11:14.080
the top of the show.

11:14.080 --> 11:21.160
Getting back into the 30th anniversary of the NES, I know that my life has been shaped

11:21.160 --> 11:24.420
significantly by the Nintendo Entertainment System.

11:24.420 --> 11:27.160
Let me go around the room, because I know we've shared a lot of memory stories and so

11:27.160 --> 11:28.160
forth.

11:28.160 --> 11:33.320
But let me go around the room and say, what do you guys consider to be your favorite,

11:33.320 --> 11:37.920
your one favorite NES game playing experience?

11:37.920 --> 11:41.560
Like what is your favorite NES game that you ever played or your favorite experience?

11:41.560 --> 11:43.640
And more importantly, why?

11:43.640 --> 11:45.360
I see Dark Soccer picking the mic up.

11:45.360 --> 11:48.000
So ladies first, your favorite NES and why?

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
The Guardian Legend.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Of course.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.120
I mean, it was semi obscure.

11:55.120 --> 11:58.760
It was a sequel to a not great MSX game.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.440
And it was really freaking hard.

12:00.440 --> 12:04.640
And I had a very deep sense of accomplishment when I beat it.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.560
And I don't even nearly have that skill now.

12:07.560 --> 12:12.520
It requires really fast reflexes, but it was such a good game.

12:12.520 --> 12:17.000
Yeah, like even playing that very first level, the beginning of it scrolls by so fast, it

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
like throws you off guard.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.480
Like, why can't I get any of these power-ups?

12:19.480 --> 12:22.160
But it's kind of supposed to do that, I guess, in the very beginning.

12:22.160 --> 12:27.400
And then me being young and having a nice, strong female hero, it was really nice.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.400
Yeah.

12:28.400 --> 12:31.880
No, that is absolutely one of my favorite games for sure.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.480
Who's got the mic over there, Flacco?

12:33.480 --> 12:34.480
What about you?

12:34.480 --> 12:36.080
What is your favorite NES game ever?

12:36.080 --> 12:37.080
Why?

12:37.080 --> 12:38.080
Oh my gosh.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.080
This is such a hard question.

12:39.080 --> 12:40.480
I only can pick one.

12:40.480 --> 12:41.480
Yeah.

12:41.520 --> 12:44.520
I was unprepared for it.

12:44.520 --> 12:45.520
It's live radio.

12:45.520 --> 12:49.080
Alright, so I mean, the first thing that always pops in my head is Mario 2.

12:49.080 --> 12:52.560
And I know like, oh, that's a weird game from blah, blah, blah.

12:52.560 --> 12:53.560
It's not a real Mario game.

12:53.560 --> 12:54.560
I don't think so.

12:54.560 --> 12:55.560
I don't agree with that at all.

12:55.560 --> 12:56.560
I don't know.

12:56.560 --> 12:57.560
I don't know.

12:57.560 --> 12:58.560
And it's all a dream or whatever.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.560
I don't care.

12:59.560 --> 13:00.560
I love that game.

13:00.560 --> 13:06.260
I think it's one of the first games I beat because I didn't get Nintendo when everybody

13:06.260 --> 13:07.260
else did.

13:07.260 --> 13:10.040
So I played all these games like after the fact, kind of.

13:10.440 --> 13:12.480
I played Mario Brothers and I played through it.

13:12.480 --> 13:13.480
I didn't beat it.

13:13.480 --> 13:16.600
And then I played Mario 2 and I'm like, oh, I love this game so much more because I kind

13:16.600 --> 13:18.040
of had them both at the same time.

13:18.040 --> 13:20.320
So yeah, Mario 2 I really loved.

13:20.320 --> 13:23.840
I loved beating the final boss and I love the art style and I like the different gameplay

13:23.840 --> 13:24.840
for the different characters.

13:24.840 --> 13:28.680
And then the only other game I could think of is, this is why it's neck and neck for

13:28.680 --> 13:31.040
me, but Deja Vu on the NES.

13:31.040 --> 13:32.040
Oh yeah.

13:32.040 --> 13:38.080
That was in that same series as like an uninvited Shadow Gate.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.080
I just love Deja Vu.

13:39.120 --> 13:42.880
Again, I got all these games as hand-me-downs, so I had them way later.

13:42.880 --> 13:43.880
That was a Mac game.

13:43.880 --> 13:45.880
That series was really a Mac series.

13:45.880 --> 13:49.080
And a lot of people say that the S ports weren't very good, but I just loved them.

13:49.080 --> 13:51.680
The music in Shadow Gate, though, is seriously one of my favorites.

13:51.680 --> 13:54.840
I know it's a Mac game, but then they got a Japanese composer, I think, to do the music.

13:54.840 --> 13:59.040
I love the music in Deja Vu, so I don't know if it's the same composer, but I love that

13:59.040 --> 14:00.040
game.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.040
So I love both those games so much, so it's hard to pick.

14:02.040 --> 14:03.400
No, that's all right.

14:03.400 --> 14:09.000
And since you bring up Mario 2, you know how today, here we are 30 years later, and

14:09.000 --> 14:14.680
oftentimes we criticize the sequel-itis, the yearly entry, right?

14:14.680 --> 14:18.060
Like Madden 16, Roster Update 2016, right?

14:18.060 --> 14:22.520
We kind of get very critical of sequels because they don't really differ that much from the

14:22.520 --> 14:23.520
original.

14:23.520 --> 14:26.800
But one interesting thing, like really interesting thing about the Nintendo Entertainment System

14:26.800 --> 14:33.160
in particular, is that a lot of the sequels on NES were very different games.

14:33.160 --> 14:38.200
And I know that Mario 2, we all know that it was based off another Japanese game and

14:38.200 --> 14:44.360
that Japan actually had the Mario 2 that was very similar to Mario 1, so it was a hell

14:44.360 --> 14:46.120
of a lot harder, right?

14:46.120 --> 14:51.080
But I liked that it was so different, and it showed the versatility, I think, of the

14:51.080 --> 14:52.720
strong characters.

14:52.720 --> 14:55.680
But it wasn't just Mario 2, I mean, look at Castlevania.

14:55.680 --> 14:57.920
Look at Simon's Quest versus the original.

14:57.920 --> 14:58.920
Oh yeah, and I love that game.

14:58.920 --> 15:01.360
I know a lot of people don't like that game either, but I love that game.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.040
I kind of like the weird deviations.

15:03.040 --> 15:07.960
I don't like Adventure of Link, but it's still a fun, interesting deviation.

15:07.960 --> 15:10.920
I thought Adventure of Link was amazing when I was a kid.

15:10.920 --> 15:16.680
Yeah, it wasn't nearly the same as Zelda 1, but it was so hard.

15:16.680 --> 15:19.440
And I look back and I go, how did I beat this as a kid?

15:19.440 --> 15:23.720
And it's just hours and hours of practice and staying up late with your friends.

15:23.720 --> 15:24.720
That's what we did.

15:24.720 --> 15:29.040
We stayed up until two in the morning until, you know, our parents woke up screaming like

15:29.040 --> 15:34.720
get to bed, you know, playing these games and getting to know these patterns.

15:34.720 --> 15:35.760
I love those weird sequels.

15:35.760 --> 15:36.760
I don't know why.

15:36.840 --> 15:38.880
I was always drawn to them, even if they're kind of not great.

15:38.880 --> 15:40.560
It's just like, oh, I like that it's different.

15:40.560 --> 15:45.520
I think many, many people consider Mega Man 2 superior to Mega Man 1, which I know it's

15:45.520 --> 15:46.520
not.

15:46.520 --> 15:47.520
Everybody's going to agree with me on that point.

15:47.520 --> 15:51.000
And Mega Man 1 did have, you know, a lot of things to love about it, but Mega Man 2 kind

15:51.000 --> 15:53.120
of like really perfected the formula.

15:53.120 --> 15:56.960
I'm trying to think what other games were very, very different with the sequels.

15:56.960 --> 16:01.480
I don't know if you would consider Gradius and Life Force, because I guess they technically

16:01.480 --> 16:02.760
then there was a Gradius 2.

16:02.760 --> 16:07.480
I think a lot of people at the time considered Life Force to be Gradius 2 and they were very

16:07.480 --> 16:08.480
different.

16:08.480 --> 16:09.480
Salamander, right?

16:09.480 --> 16:13.560
So if you know the history, there's another one that was extremely different between the

16:13.560 --> 16:14.560
one and the two.

16:14.560 --> 16:18.840
Was it Donkey Kong 2 different or was it Donkey Kong Jr.?

16:18.840 --> 16:22.800
It was Donkey Kong Jr. and sort of, but not really.

16:22.800 --> 16:26.920
But Donkey Kong Jr. and we, I thought Donkey Kong Jr. was more accessible, at least when

16:26.920 --> 16:30.360
we brought this up on the show a few weeks ago, but Donkey Kong Jr. was notable because

16:30.360 --> 16:32.440
it's like the only game where Mario's the villain.

16:32.440 --> 16:34.800
Okay, I don't remember.

16:34.800 --> 16:38.120
At least that's what you think.

16:38.120 --> 16:45.000
Unless you consider Mario Party possible, then Mario is certainly the villain for some

16:45.000 --> 16:46.800
people in that game as well.

16:46.800 --> 16:49.560
All right, let's move on.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.920
Shane, how about you?

16:51.920 --> 16:54.880
Greatest NES game for you and why?

16:54.880 --> 17:01.320
Probably Mega Man 3 because I remember playing it at Power Fest, Nintendo Power Fest, and

17:01.320 --> 17:05.600
they could not pull me away from playing Top Man's stage or Snake Man's stage.

17:05.600 --> 17:09.600
Those were the two I think you got to play and it just, I was so into Mega Man at that

17:09.600 --> 17:16.520
point and my love of Mega Man has never really waned since then, since Mega Man 3, so it's

17:16.520 --> 17:17.520
my favorite.

17:17.520 --> 17:21.480
What's your favorite stage in Mega Man 3?

17:21.480 --> 17:31.680
To play, probably Gemini Man's stage, to listen to Shadow Man's stage.

17:31.680 --> 17:36.800
I always liked Snake Man because the level's so cartoony and I remember thinking that when

17:36.800 --> 17:37.800
I was a kid.

17:37.800 --> 17:41.980
I was very impressed with the graphics in Mega Man 2 and 3 because it's like I'm watching

17:41.980 --> 17:43.320
a cartoon on my TV.

17:43.320 --> 17:44.320
It looks so good.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.560
Yeah, like when you were on the big snake and you had to shoot his head and it was going

17:46.560 --> 17:47.560
up and down.

17:47.560 --> 17:48.560
Yes, exactly.

17:48.560 --> 17:53.720
Or like in Bubble Man's stage in Mega Man 2 with the big fish, it was kind of a lot

17:53.720 --> 17:54.720
like that.

17:54.720 --> 17:55.720
Yeah.

17:55.720 --> 17:56.720
Yeah.

17:56.720 --> 17:57.720
All right, that's a good answer, Mega Man 3.

17:57.720 --> 17:58.720
Absolutely.

17:58.720 --> 17:59.720
It is a good answer.

17:59.720 --> 18:00.720
I know there's a lot of people who love Mega Man.

18:00.720 --> 18:01.720
And it's better than 2.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.020
Pissed that Capcom won't go back.

18:03.020 --> 18:04.020
It's close.

18:04.020 --> 18:05.020
No, it's better than 2.

18:05.020 --> 18:08.880
Pissed that Capcom doesn't seem to want to revisit this era?

18:08.880 --> 18:16.800
I'm actually, no, I'm not upset about that because I like 9 and 10, but I'm done with

18:16.800 --> 18:17.800
8-bit games.

18:17.800 --> 18:23.500
If we're going to make a Mega Man 11, let's at least graduate to the Super Nintendo style

18:23.500 --> 18:24.500
or Mega Man 8.

18:24.500 --> 18:25.500
I love Mega Man 8.

18:25.500 --> 18:28.580
I love everything about 8, especially the bad voice acting.

18:28.580 --> 18:29.580
So if they could do that for him.

18:29.580 --> 18:30.580
Dr. Waiwi.

18:30.580 --> 18:31.580
Yes.

18:31.580 --> 18:32.580
Yes.

18:32.580 --> 18:36.380
Or when he like flubs his lines, but you know, they don't cut it.

18:36.380 --> 18:37.580
They just let him keep going.

18:37.580 --> 18:38.980
Oh, it's so good.

18:38.980 --> 18:44.860
Do you think that, I lost my train of thought.

18:44.860 --> 18:45.860
Mighty No. 9.

18:45.920 --> 18:48.800
Mighty Mighty No. 9 is going to prove to be a good successor, like something that you're

18:48.800 --> 18:49.800
looking for?

18:49.800 --> 18:54.880
I'm not looking forward to it at all based on stuff I've seen on it, like video.

18:54.880 --> 18:59.320
It looks soulless for a Mega Man game or a Mega Man ripoff.

18:59.320 --> 19:00.320
Ouch.

19:00.320 --> 19:01.320
Yeah.

19:01.320 --> 19:02.320
Alright.

19:02.320 --> 19:03.320
Loki, how about you?

19:03.320 --> 19:05.680
Yeah, that's tough.

19:05.680 --> 19:09.680
Probably Super Mario Bros. 3?

19:09.680 --> 19:14.520
Just because I was really hyped up about that game even before it came out with the whole

19:14.540 --> 19:16.340
wizard thing.

19:16.340 --> 19:19.060
You know, that was going to be the first time they were showing that off, and it was like,

19:19.060 --> 19:24.100
oh my god, this is amazing, and then I played it and it was, oh my god, amazing, and especially

19:24.100 --> 19:29.380
like the airship levels and stuff like that were pretty awesome, or the giant world.

19:29.380 --> 19:34.700
They hyped that game so fucking good too with the movie, The Wizard, and like, you know,

19:34.700 --> 19:38.180
because that movie was out like a good year before the game.

19:38.180 --> 19:41.060
I don't know if maybe Japan had got that game a lot sooner than we did.

19:41.060 --> 19:42.740
That was probably really the case.

19:42.740 --> 19:48.280
You know, we didn't, the internet was not around in the late 80s, so if the game wasn't

19:48.280 --> 19:51.000
out in America, you were none the wiser.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.800
So yeah, there was so much build up to Mario 3, and when you finally got to play it, it

19:55.800 --> 19:57.520
was, oh my god!

19:57.520 --> 20:01.320
And plus, remember in the movie, they show you how to get the warp whistle, and so if

20:01.320 --> 20:04.160
you were paying attention, you knew how to do it in the game.

20:04.160 --> 20:05.160
Yep.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.160
Crazy.

20:06.160 --> 20:07.160
Alright, Mario 3.

20:07.160 --> 20:08.160
I think a lot of people would pick that.

20:08.160 --> 20:10.160
That was one of the big ones.

20:10.380 --> 20:12.980
This might surprise you, because I'm not going to pick The Guardian Legend, even though that

20:12.980 --> 20:17.100
is one of my very favorites, but I really think if I were to go back for what was my

20:17.100 --> 20:22.180
favorite, my like essential NES game, it really would be The Original Legend of Zelda.

20:22.180 --> 20:28.220
I think was really the one that just started it all, and I think in some ways, like, I

20:28.220 --> 20:29.980
really can truly say that game changed my life.

20:29.980 --> 20:37.660
I think it did, because, you know, it kind of made me more social in some ways at school,

20:37.660 --> 20:41.280
and I know I've kind of brought this up before, that like I was totally like not the cool

20:41.280 --> 20:45.720
kid at school, but then The Legend of Zelda, like, can you imagine that by the way, guys?

20:45.720 --> 20:50.200
I was not a cool kid in school, I know it's hard to believe, but I just wasn't, but when

20:50.200 --> 20:56.160
Zelda came out, like then, the guys that would pick on me would suddenly like, so, you know,

20:56.160 --> 20:59.960
after like making fun of me around their friends, then when they had a chance to see me one

20:59.960 --> 21:04.520
on one, alright, so, uh, how do I find the fourth dungeon on the second quest?

21:04.520 --> 21:07.600
That's the best part about it though, is like, there's no direction to it.

21:07.620 --> 21:11.780
And on top of all that, then when you're done, they have a whole completely second quest

21:11.780 --> 21:14.140
to it, and that's like value right there.

21:14.140 --> 21:20.020
That would be DLC today, that's the scary thing, that is DLC today, and that was just,

21:20.020 --> 21:22.060
that was like an Easter egg back then, you know?

21:22.060 --> 21:25.500
Well, and then today, like, imagine kids trying to play The Legend of Zelda, like, they're

21:25.500 --> 21:30.460
not gonna know what the fuck to do, like, uh, what do I do?

21:30.460 --> 21:31.460
How do I beat this?

21:31.460 --> 21:32.460
Yeah, I know.

21:32.460 --> 21:33.460
Figure it out.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.460
Stupid.

21:34.520 --> 21:37.820
Well, for me, like, the way I found everything out was magazines.

21:37.820 --> 21:42.840
If you were researched, and you really, like, read up on it, you could find all this stuff

21:42.840 --> 21:46.720
out and you just had to, like, be attention, or pay attention and be aware.

21:46.720 --> 21:51.320
And you know, if you read all the magazines and, you know, got that fold-out map and,

21:51.320 --> 21:56.480
um, god, uh, you know, the Nintendo Fun Club magazine before there was Nintendo Power,

21:56.480 --> 22:03.520
um, and, uh, you know, just weird things like that, you just picked it up, talking to people

22:03.580 --> 22:07.540
about games and trading secrets that way, like, that's just kinda like, because of the

22:07.540 --> 22:11.500
internet and things like GameFAQs, and I'm not shading GameFAQs, I use that side a lot

22:11.500 --> 22:16.060
myself, but we don't need, I mean, it's like, we don't really talk about game strategy anymore,

22:16.060 --> 22:17.060
we don't need to.

22:17.060 --> 22:20.140
But, like, I like that game how there's, like, so much hidden stuff and there's no indication

22:20.140 --> 22:23.900
of where it is, there's no, like, cracked walls or anything in most of the places, like,

22:23.900 --> 22:28.080
out in the outside, it's just like bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb all the walls.

22:28.080 --> 22:32.360
One in the, one of the dungeons in the second quest, you have to set a tree on fire to get

22:32.380 --> 22:33.900
it to open, right?

22:33.900 --> 22:38.860
Okay, and, like, I think they give you a hint, one of the old ladies on one of the screens

22:38.860 --> 22:42.180
says, like, the tree in the forest holds a secret.

22:42.180 --> 22:46.420
Well, there's, like, 5,000 fucking trees in the forest, I mean, what are you supposed

22:46.420 --> 22:47.700
to do, set every single one of them on fire?

22:47.700 --> 22:49.700
Burn the forest down!

22:49.700 --> 22:50.700
So.

22:50.700 --> 22:54.740
Or, like, the invisible walls.

22:54.740 --> 22:57.740
Those were the worst, having to figure out where the invisible walls were and just finding

22:57.740 --> 22:58.740
them by accident.

22:59.400 --> 23:05.200
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, a lot of comments here on what I was just

23:05.200 --> 23:09.100
saying about Zelda in chat, Kaijuto says, those fucking Zelda commercials threw me off

23:09.100 --> 23:11.520
the game, they turned me off from it.

23:11.520 --> 23:16.920
Yeah, remember how, like, everything was all hyped up for, like, you know, like, Nintendo

23:16.920 --> 23:21.320
cereal and everything was like, wow, and neon colors, like, but all the commercials from,

23:21.320 --> 23:22.320
like, that era.

23:22.320 --> 23:23.320
That's just the era, yeah.

23:23.320 --> 23:24.640
All the commercials back then were super lame.

23:24.640 --> 23:28.120
I don't even remember, I don't even remember the Legend of Zelda commercial, to be honest

23:28.120 --> 23:29.120
with you.

23:29.120 --> 23:30.120
You don't remember it?

23:30.120 --> 23:32.120
It was a guy in the room going, Zelda!

23:32.120 --> 23:33.120
Zelda!

23:33.120 --> 23:36.100
Weren't they, like, rapping the names of the enemies or something?

23:36.100 --> 23:37.100
I thought that was it.

23:37.100 --> 23:40.340
But there was that one too, yeah, there was a rapping commercial, there was so many weird

23:40.340 --> 23:41.340
commercials.

23:41.340 --> 23:42.340
Everything was a wrap.

23:42.340 --> 23:43.340
Well, yeah, that's everything.

23:43.340 --> 23:47.300
But I just remember the guy just in the room just screaming, Zelda!

23:47.300 --> 23:49.660
It was such a bad commercial.

23:49.660 --> 23:54.060
Let's see, Dark Tetsuya says, too used to having their handheld via a tutorial.

23:54.060 --> 23:58.040
Why also, I don't want to sound like the get off my lawn gamer either, because there's

23:58.040 --> 24:02.760
a lot of great games, and I've razzed games for not having a tutorial, like, remember

24:02.760 --> 24:06.480
when I first played Minecraft, I was like, I don't fucking get it, but then when I played

24:06.480 --> 24:09.800
the Xbox 360 one that did hold your hand a little bit, I was like, oh, okay, I get it

24:09.800 --> 24:10.800
now.

24:10.800 --> 24:11.800
You know?

24:11.800 --> 24:15.320
And that's one of the things, well, to get into that later on, yeah, like, I like some

24:15.320 --> 24:18.340
of the things that they changed in that one, where, like, you know, the crafting stuff's

24:18.340 --> 24:22.680
a lot easier, you don't need to, you know, have to remember every recipe and stuff.

24:22.700 --> 24:26.100
I kind of wish the Windows 10 version was like that again, because, or at least have

24:26.100 --> 24:28.900
the option to turn that on, that would be nice.

24:28.900 --> 24:31.700
Because I don't like having to remember the recipe, especially when there's, like, new

24:31.700 --> 24:33.420
blocks, I'm like, what the hell is this block?

24:33.420 --> 24:34.420
What do I use this for?

24:34.420 --> 24:37.380
I have no idea what the hell I can craft with this.

24:37.380 --> 24:39.820
I guess I could look it up.

24:39.820 --> 24:45.020
Let's see, an anonymous chatter in our chat room, 466 says, I'm 30 years old and still

24:45.020 --> 24:48.020
trying to figure out how to get past the first stage in Zelda.

24:48.020 --> 24:52.100
Hey, good on you for not just going to Game Facts and cheating, though, but I'll give

24:52.120 --> 24:54.400
you, I'll give you a hint, I'll give you a hint.

24:54.400 --> 25:01.280
In the first couple dungeons in Zelda, like, every wall you can bomb through.

25:01.280 --> 25:02.560
Every wall is, like, bombable.

25:02.560 --> 25:06.160
So as long as you have a map, and you can find the map in the dungeon of what it looks

25:06.160 --> 25:07.840
like, like, every wall you can bomb.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.680
Just a little tip there.

25:09.680 --> 25:17.400
Let's see, also, what else is in chat over at live.vognetwork.com, SSG100Matt says, I

25:17.400 --> 25:21.900
had no clue how to play Zelda 2 until I read the maps in Nintendo Power.

25:21.900 --> 25:24.580
There you go.

25:24.580 --> 25:28.240
Let's see, now, of course, everybody's sharing YouTube clips.

25:28.240 --> 25:29.420
So let me see here.

25:29.420 --> 25:35.540
This one is, what is this one, this is the one that Flock was talking about.

25:35.540 --> 25:54.520
What even is this?

25:54.520 --> 25:58.760
Is that, like, the guy from, like, what was it, the second Ghostbusters movie or something?

25:58.760 --> 26:03.040
You know, the one that was, like, not Vigo, but the guy that was, you know, possessed

26:03.040 --> 26:04.040
by Vigo.

26:04.580 --> 26:05.580
Oh my god.

26:05.580 --> 26:11.580
It was seriously, though, that's, like, seriously, uh, PlayStation 3 advertisement material right

26:11.580 --> 26:12.580
there.

26:12.580 --> 26:14.780
I mean, that's just some weird shit.

26:14.780 --> 26:18.660
Giant enemy crabs!

26:18.660 --> 26:20.220
You expect it to go next.

26:20.220 --> 26:21.220
I love it.

26:21.220 --> 26:22.220
All right, thank you guys.

26:22.220 --> 26:23.220
That was great.

26:23.220 --> 26:27.820
Uh, so, yeah, I mean, who knows where gaming would be today without the NES?

26:27.820 --> 26:31.420
I mean, the NES came out at the end of a huge video game crash.

26:31.420 --> 26:36.880
I mean, a lot of people wrote off the game industry as dead because, and it wasn't because

26:36.880 --> 26:37.880
of E.T.

26:37.880 --> 26:41.680
It was not solely because of E.T., and a lot of people kind of mistake that, but it was

26:41.680 --> 26:47.360
just these shitty licensed games were coming out by the bucketful, and it's just the marketplace.

26:47.360 --> 26:52.240
God, if only shitty licensed games destroyed an industry, we'd be fucked right now.

26:52.240 --> 26:53.240
Right?

26:53.240 --> 26:58.280
And it's, it's, isn't it weird that that technically can kind of happen now, but it's not, like,

26:58.280 --> 26:59.280
it's just different now.

26:59.280 --> 27:03.420
The market's so different now, because, you know, PC is so open-ended, I mean, there is

27:03.420 --> 27:08.740
a lot of shit and shovelware out there, but somehow, thanks to the internet, word of mouth,

27:08.740 --> 27:12.020
what marketplaces feature, and so forth, we have a way to kind of sort through that, I

27:12.020 --> 27:13.020
think.

27:13.020 --> 27:18.100
So, and then when really crappy licensed things come out, like Yaris, you know, we figure

27:18.100 --> 27:19.100
it out.

27:19.100 --> 27:20.100
So, anyway.

27:20.100 --> 27:23.900
All right, let's get into a little more current.

27:23.900 --> 27:27.820
We won't do retro all night long, but we will revisit the Nintendo later in the show.

27:27.820 --> 27:30.880
Frugal question of the week, as well as our list list tonight.

27:30.880 --> 27:34.560
But I want to talk about our gaming weeks, get a little more current with what we've

27:34.560 --> 27:35.560
been playing lately.

27:35.560 --> 27:37.120
So, how is your gaming week?

27:37.120 --> 27:39.120
Dark Sakura, starting with you.

27:39.120 --> 27:41.920
I've been playing on some Dragon Age Inquisition.

27:41.920 --> 27:48.040
I've played some Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer, but other than that, I really haven't

27:48.040 --> 27:53.320
played a whole lot of much, just because I wanted to finish up my fanfic this week, which

27:53.320 --> 27:56.480
I finally put the last chapter in.

27:56.480 --> 27:57.480
Yay.

27:58.140 --> 28:01.540
If you want to read my shit, tell me.

28:01.540 --> 28:04.140
All right, go visit our chat room.

28:04.140 --> 28:05.740
You can look at Dark Sakura's there.

28:05.740 --> 28:08.660
You can just look up Dark Sakura on Archive of Our Own.

28:08.660 --> 28:11.860
Oh, chapter five, entering the Bone Zone.

28:11.860 --> 28:12.860
Stop it.

28:12.860 --> 28:13.860
Don't write that kind of shit.

28:13.860 --> 28:14.860
All right.

28:14.860 --> 28:17.860
Loki, how was your gaming week?

28:17.860 --> 28:22.240
This week, I would consider like the, it's like video game masturbation, it was basically

28:22.240 --> 28:23.240
playing a bunch of games.

28:23.240 --> 28:24.540
You were in the Bone Zone.

28:24.540 --> 28:25.540
Pretty much.

28:25.600 --> 28:29.240
It was pretty much just playing games for like no purpose whatsoever.

28:29.240 --> 28:30.240
Just like I...

28:30.240 --> 28:31.240
You know what games are for?

28:31.240 --> 28:34.740
No, no, I understand that, but like I was trying to find a game that I could get into

28:34.740 --> 28:36.680
and it wasn't really getting into anything.

28:36.680 --> 28:41.960
Like I try, I started up, because I have the PC version of Final Fantasy VII, so I started

28:41.960 --> 28:46.780
that up, you know, I was showing my son the game and he asked way too many fucking questions

28:46.780 --> 28:47.780
about it.

28:47.780 --> 28:54.060
And honestly, it doesn't seem, it didn't really hold up too well to me.

28:54.080 --> 28:57.460
So I was like, eh, I don't really want to play this.

28:57.460 --> 29:02.700
So I started up Final Fantasy VI instead, and I think that held up a lot better, but

29:02.700 --> 29:06.680
once again, he ruined it by asking too many questions about it.

29:06.680 --> 29:07.900
But I may start playing that.

29:07.900 --> 29:15.100
I did play a lot of Minecraft for Windows 10, and I don't know, it's okay.

29:15.100 --> 29:20.800
It runs well, but I was playing it on survival and I'm just kind of bored with it.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.760
Like there's just no point to it at all.

29:22.760 --> 29:28.200
I'm like, eh, I don't, it's not hard to survive and I just don't want to build stuff.

29:28.200 --> 29:32.280
I mean, I don't want to make like this fancy structure or something like that.

29:32.280 --> 29:35.720
And I was exploring, you know, caves and stuff and I got all the way down to the bottom there

29:35.720 --> 29:39.960
and then I got knocked into the lava because of some stupid kickback from a zombie.

29:39.960 --> 29:43.280
And I was like, fuck this, I don't want to play this anymore.

29:43.280 --> 29:44.700
But then I went back and played it some more.

29:44.700 --> 29:49.200
But it just, I get bored with it so fast and I just kind of lost the point.

29:49.200 --> 29:52.720
Like playing it by yourself is just not as fun as playing it with other people.

29:52.720 --> 29:56.240
And there seems to be like, the fact that it doesn't really have, I mean, it has like

29:56.240 --> 30:00.280
a storyline and what you're supposed to do to kind of beat the game, but there's not

30:00.280 --> 30:02.840
really much motivation to get you to do any of that.

30:02.840 --> 30:07.760
And so there's kind of no point without finding something to do with friends.

30:07.760 --> 30:09.040
So that was that.

30:09.040 --> 30:11.040
And then what else did I play?

30:11.040 --> 30:13.480
I think I played a little bit of Mario Maker, but very little.

30:13.480 --> 30:18.360
I may have played through the 100 Mario thing and that was it.

30:18.360 --> 30:19.360
Just once.

30:19.360 --> 30:22.760
All right, there it is.

30:22.760 --> 30:23.760
Moving on.

30:23.760 --> 30:24.760
More gaming weeks.

30:24.760 --> 30:25.760
How about you?

30:25.760 --> 30:26.760
Who's got the mic over there?

30:26.760 --> 30:27.760
Flaco.

30:27.760 --> 30:28.760
Hello, I have the mic.

30:28.760 --> 30:29.760
What did I play this week?

30:29.760 --> 30:30.760
What did I play every week?

30:30.760 --> 30:31.760
Splatoon.

30:31.760 --> 30:32.760
Played a lot more Splatoon.

30:32.760 --> 30:35.160
I'm at B plus 61 on ranked mode.

30:35.160 --> 30:37.160
I just want to get the A minus so bad.

30:37.160 --> 30:39.880
Did they do a big update this week or am I crazy?

30:39.880 --> 30:42.020
I thought they did like a big balancing thing this week.

30:42.020 --> 30:43.360
Was that this week or was it coming?

30:43.360 --> 30:47.240
No, I don't think it's happened yet because I was still owning people with my blaster

30:47.240 --> 30:48.240
this morning.

30:48.240 --> 30:49.240
So that was pretty awesome.

30:49.240 --> 30:50.240
But yeah.

30:50.240 --> 30:53.160
I heard the rollers are getting a nerf and that upset me.

30:53.160 --> 30:54.660
Everybody was getting a nerf.

30:54.660 --> 30:57.600
I just came out to have a good time and I'm feeling very attacked by this.

30:57.600 --> 30:59.720
Yeah, but I bet you don't play rollers like that.

30:59.720 --> 31:00.720
Yeah.

31:00.720 --> 31:01.720
Well, you see me.

31:01.720 --> 31:02.720
You just roll.

31:02.720 --> 31:03.720
You're good.

31:03.720 --> 31:04.720
You're just rolling around.

31:04.720 --> 31:05.720
You're doing the roller thing.

31:05.720 --> 31:06.720
Thank you.

31:06.720 --> 31:07.720
Once I get to know the map.

31:07.720 --> 31:08.720
I know where to roll.

31:08.720 --> 31:10.960
But I know if you just barely clip someone with the side of your roller, you kill them.

31:10.960 --> 31:12.840
I think that's not going to happen anymore.

31:12.840 --> 31:16.920
And, uh, so just, um, like something about the splatter and like, you gotta be right

31:16.920 --> 31:19.320
in the middle of splatter to get them now instead of like getting them with the sides

31:19.320 --> 31:20.320
or something like that.

31:20.320 --> 31:21.320
I don't know.

31:21.320 --> 31:22.320
I don't really play roller.

31:22.320 --> 31:23.320
So I didn't focus on that.

31:23.320 --> 31:26.480
I know the blasters splash damage is getting nerfed and I use that in tower control, but

31:26.480 --> 31:27.480
it was great this morning.

31:27.480 --> 31:29.880
I was still shooting at the tower, killing people without even aiming at them.

31:29.880 --> 31:30.880
It was great.

31:30.880 --> 31:36.400
Uh, so yeah, I played that I played, uh, Oh, Shane brought over Soma again last week.

31:36.400 --> 31:38.240
So I'm playing a little bit Soma.

31:38.240 --> 31:40.920
And then that's like the scary game of the now, right?

31:40.920 --> 31:42.800
I guess it's not that scary.

31:42.800 --> 31:43.800
It's cool.

31:43.800 --> 31:44.800
I like the story.

31:44.800 --> 31:45.800
It's really creepy, but it's not scary.

31:45.800 --> 31:50.280
I wouldn't say it's really disturbing in places, but I wouldn't call it like a scary game.

31:50.280 --> 31:51.640
So it's not jump scares or anything.

31:51.640 --> 31:52.640
I think I did yell once.

31:52.640 --> 31:55.360
I was like, ah, yeah, I said I did jump once.

31:55.360 --> 31:56.840
Uh, that's a cool game.

31:56.840 --> 32:02.000
And then he went and bought Jackbox party pack and brought that over and we played bomb

32:02.000 --> 32:03.760
Corp and it was amazing.

32:03.760 --> 32:05.640
And so, so much so that we were getting obsessed with it.

32:05.640 --> 32:06.920
My wife and I were going to obsess with it.

32:06.920 --> 32:10.720
And so then we add a little credits on our PlayStation accounts like let's just buy it.

32:10.720 --> 32:14.160
So we bought the party back, but always played still as bomb Corp.

32:14.160 --> 32:18.720
So we played that and we got through, I think we got to day six or seven or something.

32:18.720 --> 32:20.520
Can you beat that game or does it just keep going?

32:20.520 --> 32:21.520
I don't know.

32:21.520 --> 32:24.240
We've gotten as far as day 10 and then we got, we, we just stopped because we got so

32:24.240 --> 32:25.240
tired.

32:25.240 --> 32:26.240
So we stopped playing.

32:26.240 --> 32:28.400
We were like at the end of day 10 when we just didn't want to try one more time.

32:28.400 --> 32:31.740
I think it's just two weeks cause there's a, there's a great story.

32:31.740 --> 32:32.740
It's really funny.

32:32.740 --> 32:35.720
Some of the best like comedy writing I think I've seen in a game.

32:35.720 --> 32:37.860
So it was really funny.

32:37.860 --> 32:41.480
And there's a storyline going on where this guy is there and he's going to be leaving

32:41.480 --> 32:44.240
soon and that's his last day is day 10.

32:44.240 --> 32:46.300
So I assume that's the last day of the game.

32:46.300 --> 32:47.300
Oh, I didn't even know.

32:47.300 --> 32:50.140
I didn't, we didn't even get as far like cause we were playing it.

32:50.140 --> 32:52.900
Me Alan and Shane were all playing it this week and we did.

32:52.900 --> 32:56.780
I, it's not revealed until the second week that this certain characters it's his last

32:56.780 --> 32:57.780
week.

32:57.780 --> 32:58.780
Oh no.

32:58.780 --> 33:00.100
We were exploding on like Wednesday the first week.

33:00.100 --> 33:01.480
Oh, Wednesday is the hardest day.

33:01.480 --> 33:02.480
It's like you get through Monday.

33:02.480 --> 33:03.480
Oh, this is not so bad.

33:03.480 --> 33:04.480
Tuesday.

33:04.480 --> 33:05.480
It's like, okay, a little harder.

33:05.480 --> 33:10.040
Ratches all the way up cause like little kids start writing the clues and you're like, what?

33:10.040 --> 33:14.400
Like get the book, like don't cut the wire if it's funky, but cut it if it's cool, but

33:14.400 --> 33:15.400
not if it's wicked.

33:15.400 --> 33:16.400
I'm like, what?

33:16.400 --> 33:19.080
Blues are always wicked and reds are always cool.

33:19.080 --> 33:20.720
I'm like, that doesn't make any sense.

33:20.720 --> 33:23.440
The thing that I wasn't expecting cause you know, we, we had them on the show a couple

33:23.440 --> 33:24.440
of weeks ago.

33:24.440 --> 33:25.440
Right.

33:25.440 --> 33:26.960
And I, I didn't even, I don't remember them even talking about this, but there's more

33:26.960 --> 33:31.880
than just bomb cutting in it because then it's like filing the filing and key pads.

33:31.880 --> 33:32.880
Yeah.

33:32.880 --> 33:34.720
If you file it wrong, then the filing cabinet explodes.

33:34.760 --> 33:35.760
Yeah.

33:35.760 --> 33:36.760
Cause every, it's a warm court.

33:36.760 --> 33:37.760
Everything explodes.

33:37.760 --> 33:39.920
It's like, oh, you know, put this, put the number on the door and by the way, if you

33:39.920 --> 33:40.920
get it wrong, it'll explode.

33:40.920 --> 33:41.920
Uh, yeah.

33:41.920 --> 33:42.920
File these files.

33:42.920 --> 33:44.400
If you get it wrong, the file cabinet will explode.

33:44.400 --> 33:45.400
Just don't question it.

33:45.400 --> 33:46.400
It's just going to happen.

33:46.400 --> 33:49.000
What I love is that if you fuck up, there's, there's like nothing.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.280
There's no like EE, there's no like buzz.

33:51.280 --> 33:52.920
It's just an instant on the TV.

33:52.920 --> 33:53.920
Boom.

33:53.920 --> 33:54.920
That's it.

33:54.920 --> 33:55.920
You get nothing.

33:55.920 --> 33:56.920
Everybody's like, what just happened?

33:56.920 --> 33:57.920
What did we do wrong?

33:57.920 --> 33:58.920
I thought we read this.

33:58.920 --> 33:59.920
Oh, my wife's case.

33:59.920 --> 34:01.200
She just gets, cuts the wires.

34:01.200 --> 34:02.680
She's like, we can't decide which wire to cut.

34:02.680 --> 34:04.680
She's like, oh, cut that one.

34:04.680 --> 34:05.680
Sometimes it works.

34:05.680 --> 34:06.680
So it's like, wow, that actually worked.

34:06.680 --> 34:11.600
But then a lot of times it doesn't like, no, no, we're going to start all over.

34:11.600 --> 34:12.600
Let's see.

34:12.600 --> 34:15.240
So I played Palm Corp, which is amazing.

34:15.240 --> 34:16.720
And I thought I played one more game this week.

34:16.720 --> 34:17.720
Oh yeah.

34:17.720 --> 34:18.720
Yoshi's wooly world.

34:18.720 --> 34:21.160
I bought that and it was, it's really awesome.

34:21.160 --> 34:26.220
I played through the entire first area and I'm on the second area now.

34:26.220 --> 34:29.120
So that's where I'm at in that one in the kids love it.

34:29.120 --> 34:33.560
We play with mellow mode on the kids and it's pretty cool cause like my son is getting

34:33.560 --> 34:37.020
better at video games and this one he's figuring out pretty quick and like you can hold the

34:37.020 --> 34:39.120
a button and just fly forever.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.120
So you just fly around.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.440
Oh, is that how mellow mode works?

34:41.440 --> 34:42.440
That's how mellow mode works.

34:42.440 --> 34:45.080
Like you have full health, like not all the time.

34:45.080 --> 34:48.300
He still goes down, but you start with completely full hearts all the way.

34:48.300 --> 34:51.480
And then when you press a to jump, you can just fly forever.

34:51.480 --> 34:52.480
You have little wings.

34:52.480 --> 34:54.040
Oh, she has little wings.

34:54.040 --> 34:57.280
Like in Mario world, you could get the wings and fly if I remember right.

34:57.280 --> 34:58.280
Oh, I don't remember.

34:58.280 --> 34:59.280
I don't remember.

34:59.280 --> 35:00.280
Yeah.

35:00.280 --> 35:01.280
Yeah.

35:01.280 --> 35:02.280
Okay.

35:02.280 --> 35:03.280
Yeah.

35:03.280 --> 35:04.280
So it's like that.

35:04.280 --> 35:06.040
But yeah, I think it's a great game.

35:06.040 --> 35:09.160
It's a simple little game, but you know, it's only like 40 bucks.

35:09.160 --> 35:11.520
So I was like, that's great.

35:11.520 --> 35:12.520
So I think that's all I played.

35:12.520 --> 35:13.520
Oh yeah.

35:13.520 --> 35:17.760
And of course, uh, Marvel puzzle quest on my phone because I played it all the time

35:17.760 --> 35:18.760
still.

35:18.760 --> 35:22.240
Uh, somebody posted in my Facebook this week that that came out for PlayStation four and

35:22.240 --> 35:23.240
I had no idea.

35:23.240 --> 35:24.240
Yeah.

35:24.240 --> 35:25.240
Right.

35:25.240 --> 35:26.240
I know.

35:26.240 --> 35:27.240
Are you kidding me?

35:27.240 --> 35:28.240
No, it's on my Facebook.

35:28.240 --> 35:29.200
Oh my gosh.

35:29.200 --> 35:30.200
I have to download that.

35:30.200 --> 35:31.200
Can I transfer my stuff over from face?

35:31.200 --> 35:32.200
I don't know.

35:32.200 --> 35:33.200
Can you, can you, I don't know.

35:33.200 --> 35:35.440
You can save your stuff on Facebook cause I switched phones.

35:35.440 --> 35:39.920
I switched from an Android phone to an iPhone and I was able to switch my stuff over.

35:39.920 --> 35:42.200
I might have to play again at least.

35:42.200 --> 35:43.260
Well, I left your guilt.

35:43.260 --> 35:44.260
So whatever.

35:44.260 --> 35:45.260
Yeah, I can.

35:45.260 --> 35:47.520
I went to a place where people actually played.

35:47.520 --> 35:50.680
No, it's now I get so much more bonus stuff and it makes me want to play more.

35:50.680 --> 35:51.680
So that's fair.

35:51.680 --> 35:52.680
Yeah.

35:52.680 --> 35:53.680
I'm getting lots of good covers.

35:53.680 --> 35:54.680
It's great.

35:54.680 --> 35:55.680
I love that game.

35:55.680 --> 35:56.680
We have a vog community on PS four now.

35:56.680 --> 36:00.480
Maybe I can scrape together enough people to maybe, I don't know, but if it's the same

36:00.480 --> 36:04.760
information that I would still be in my same Alliance, maybe Rob didn't abandon me like

36:04.760 --> 36:05.760
you did.

36:05.760 --> 36:06.760
I don't know what that would be on.

36:06.760 --> 36:11.080
No, I think he, I think he was the only one still playing, uh, but maybe I don't know

36:11.080 --> 36:12.080
how that would play on a PS.

36:12.080 --> 36:13.960
I guess you just move the control around and swap the gems.

36:13.960 --> 36:14.960
It's not like there's a timer.

36:14.960 --> 36:17.760
So I mean, puzzle quest was originally on the three 60.

36:17.760 --> 36:18.760
Okay.

36:18.760 --> 36:19.760
So there you go.

36:19.760 --> 36:20.760
I never had a three 60.

36:20.760 --> 36:21.760
So all right.

36:21.760 --> 36:22.760
There you go.

36:22.760 --> 36:24.840
Uh, Shane, how was your gaming week?

36:24.840 --> 36:28.400
Basically all you have to do is rewind the episode to where Jim started talking and that's

36:28.400 --> 36:29.400
my week too.

36:29.400 --> 36:31.360
Cause we played the same thing.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.880
Well, what are, what are your impressions on some of the things you talked about?

36:33.880 --> 36:38.440
Like Yoshi's wooly world because that game is so amazing.

36:38.440 --> 36:39.680
I love that game.

36:39.680 --> 36:43.120
I love you guys aren't even talking about anything else cause we haven't played anything

36:43.120 --> 36:44.120
else yet.

36:44.120 --> 36:49.760
We just went straight to bomb Corp and it is seriously like probably my favorite Jack

36:49.760 --> 36:50.760
box game.

36:50.760 --> 36:54.560
I think it might be better than you don't know Jack for me at least.

36:54.560 --> 36:58.760
Um, it's actually funnier, which is hard to top.

36:58.760 --> 37:03.640
I do like that it's, it's very different and you know, we brought this up a couple of weeks

37:03.640 --> 37:04.640
ago and we had them on too.

37:04.640 --> 37:08.040
It's kind of was breaking the formula that you could kind of start to see in the first

37:08.040 --> 37:10.480
game where it was not, not that it was bad.

37:10.480 --> 37:11.480
I mean it works.

37:11.480 --> 37:15.400
All those games are a lot of fun, but it was like everybody does this and then everybody

37:15.400 --> 37:17.120
votes on result.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.200
But bomb Corp is very different than that.

37:19.200 --> 37:20.200
And I thought that was cool.

37:20.200 --> 37:24.160
Um, I would do think though that bomb Corp is not for everybody because without naming

37:24.160 --> 37:32.600
names, Rob, some people got frustrated while playing and it's a very frustrating game.

37:32.600 --> 37:34.240
But it's, you don't want to see me heated.

37:34.240 --> 37:38.720
I swear if we were to live stream bomb Corp, Oh my gosh, we couldn't, but we, we would

37:38.720 --> 37:43.120
have to get, who are some ultra competitive people that I know, but it's not, it's cooperative.

37:43.120 --> 37:44.120
That's why it's nice.

37:44.120 --> 37:46.960
That's why it's like when you get the people to get really into it.

37:47.720 --> 37:49.840
And you didn't even get to meet Kyle yet.

37:49.840 --> 37:52.520
Kyle is exploding on Wednesday.

37:52.520 --> 37:55.960
No, we got through Wednesday I thought because yeah, we got through Wednesday.

37:55.960 --> 37:56.960
I don't know.

37:56.960 --> 37:57.960
Yeah.

37:57.960 --> 38:03.680
You didn't make it to like making coffee, which also explodes and the copy machine.

38:03.680 --> 38:04.680
Yeah.

38:04.680 --> 38:06.160
The copy machine's pretty good too.

38:06.160 --> 38:08.240
Um, then Yoshi's wooly world.

38:08.240 --> 38:09.240
I really like it.

38:09.240 --> 38:10.520
It's so adorable.

38:10.600 --> 38:17.160
I've got stars on all of the stages in the first world and I'd be one S which is ridiculous

38:17.160 --> 38:25.320
to try to get everything in that and I'm on world two that's as far as I got, um, there's

38:25.320 --> 38:26.320
my week.

38:26.320 --> 38:32.840
I play a lot of Pokemon shuffle on my phone constantly, constantly dark soccer.

38:32.840 --> 38:34.680
I'll get to it when I get to your week.

38:34.680 --> 38:35.680
Okay.

38:35.680 --> 38:36.680
Then my week.

38:36.680 --> 38:39.160
Well, I'm only gonna talk about one game cause I got you something.

38:39.160 --> 38:40.160
You did.

38:40.160 --> 38:41.160
Oh yeah.

38:41.160 --> 38:42.160
I didn't get around to playing it yet.

38:42.160 --> 38:43.160
Yes.

38:43.160 --> 38:44.160
Uh, but you did.

38:44.160 --> 38:47.440
You bought me on steam, uh, uh, pigeon sex, the game.

38:47.440 --> 38:49.440
That's what it is, right?

38:49.440 --> 38:50.440
Hot to full boyfriend.

38:50.440 --> 38:51.440
Yes.

38:51.440 --> 38:53.120
Cause Rob has to see the crackness.

38:53.120 --> 38:54.120
I want to play it.

38:54.120 --> 38:56.000
I want to, I want to do a stream of it.

38:56.000 --> 39:01.240
Make sure you do it though with the, um, the story playthroughs so that you can get a hateful

39:01.240 --> 39:02.240
boyfriend.

39:02.240 --> 39:03.240
Okay.

39:03.240 --> 39:04.240
I will.

39:04.240 --> 39:05.240
I will.

39:05.240 --> 39:07.600
Uh, but I sadly, I did not get to enjoy that yet cause um, I had a pretty busy weekend

39:07.600 --> 39:12.280
which we'll talk about in a minute, but um, I did play Yoshi's wooly world as well.

39:12.280 --> 39:15.560
And I just want to talk about that game real quick because I wasn't going to get it originally

39:15.560 --> 39:19.080
because I was like, you know, I don't know if, I don't know if it's really my thing,

39:19.080 --> 39:23.800
but then Shane did his Shane thing where he was like, I could get it at a discount Rob

39:23.800 --> 39:27.600
and you know, you're going to want the green amiibo and it's the only way I'm interrupting.

39:27.600 --> 39:31.040
That was also part of our gaming week that neither me nor Jim talked about as we waited

39:31.040 --> 39:37.040
in line at Best Buy for Yoshi's wooly world and the amiibo and the line consisted of just

39:37.040 --> 39:38.040
us.

39:38.040 --> 39:39.040
Oh my God.

39:39.040 --> 39:40.040
No.

39:40.040 --> 39:41.040
So nobody's lining up for amiibo anymore.

39:41.040 --> 39:42.040
Yeah.

39:42.040 --> 39:43.040
Yeah.

39:43.040 --> 39:46.760
There was some people that showed up right at the end, but no, they only got like eight

39:46.760 --> 39:48.320
of each color too.

39:48.320 --> 39:52.800
So, um, and then some of the bundles, but yeah, we were in the store when I texted you

39:52.800 --> 39:54.280
to see if you wanted it.

39:54.280 --> 39:55.280
Yeah.

39:55.280 --> 39:56.460
They're not continuing your story.

39:56.460 --> 40:01.480
By texting me to see if I wanted it, meaning convincing me that I need it.

40:01.480 --> 40:02.480
I will.

40:02.480 --> 40:06.640
I will pull up my phone and see exactly what I said so you can see that.

40:06.640 --> 40:09.880
But also then again, you did get Marth today and you said you didn't want any of the Fire

40:09.880 --> 40:10.880
Emblem amiibo.

40:10.880 --> 40:13.000
And then I was like, Oh, maybe I don't.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.000
Marth looks kind of cool.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.680
I'll regret not getting him if I don't get him.

40:15.680 --> 40:16.680
Yes.

40:16.680 --> 40:17.680
I got my 35th amiibo today.

40:17.680 --> 40:19.600
I got Marth today.

40:19.600 --> 40:25.000
He got me some stupid tracker program on, on the iPhone that you can use to track like

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
what you have in your collection.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
There's a tracker?

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
Yeah.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.560
I was like, I'm going to get to that point where I'm going to buy an amiibo and then

40:30.560 --> 40:32.800
get home and be fucking pissed that I already own it.

40:32.800 --> 40:35.480
I thought it was bad that I had, I think I have 16 now.

40:35.520 --> 40:41.960
I have 35 and like I would, I would say 20, 25 of them have been in the past month because

40:41.960 --> 40:42.960
of Shane.

40:42.960 --> 40:43.960
Just, just putting it out there.

40:43.960 --> 40:44.960
Oh, that's cool.

40:44.960 --> 40:48.560
So anyway, Yoshi's wooly world where this whole thing was starting, right?

40:48.560 --> 40:53.000
Um, I, I was very pleasantly surprised with Yoshi's wooly world.

40:53.000 --> 40:57.560
I didn't think I'd like it, but I think it's a very solid platforming experience.

40:57.560 --> 41:04.320
Um, it is, it is essentially Super Mario world to Yoshi's Island, but just now in this yarn

41:04.360 --> 41:06.360
environment, which looks gorgeous.

41:06.360 --> 41:10.640
I didn't, I didn't know how I would enjoy that, but, um, it does look really good.

41:10.640 --> 41:13.680
It's still, I don't know, it's still a little weird for me.

41:13.680 --> 41:15.200
I'm like, why is Yoshi a ball of yarn?

41:15.200 --> 41:16.200
I don't get it.

41:16.200 --> 41:20.520
But then I think, okay, if I was like seven or eight years old, this would be my favorite

41:20.520 --> 41:25.760
game hands down because just, you know, the solid platforming elements of it, the, the

41:25.760 --> 41:29.120
look of the game and those mechanics and so forth.

41:29.120 --> 41:34.280
Like I just, I, I would love this if I was seven and I actually really like it at 30

41:34.280 --> 41:40.120
seven, I think it's a very solid platformer and kind of hard, like not, I mean, you can

41:40.120 --> 41:42.320
get from start to finish in the stages.

41:42.320 --> 41:43.320
Pretty easy.

41:43.320 --> 41:47.120
It's not that hard, but like, Oh my God, there's so much to complete.

41:47.120 --> 41:53.200
There's the flowers, there's the yarn, there's the now instead of red coins, it's the Miiverse

41:53.200 --> 41:57.280
stamps and they're all hidden in the levels amongst the regular gems or whatever it is.

41:57.280 --> 41:59.600
And then there's the, you got to get to the end with full health.

41:59.600 --> 42:05.480
I mean, to get a star on a level that's actually kind of hard and also infuriating when you're

42:05.480 --> 42:11.640
just missing one goddamn Miiverse token to get a star on the whole damn level.

42:11.640 --> 42:20.000
So I, I'm kind of surprised at how much depth the game has to be a very difficult game.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.160
For a game that looks like a kiddie game, you know what I mean?

42:23.160 --> 42:26.520
So yeah, I, I'm really enjoying Yoshi's Willy world.

42:26.560 --> 42:33.720
And with the amiibo, I thought that was a cute tie-in because all it really is, you can in the game,

42:33.720 --> 42:39.480
as you go through, if you get all the yarn in each level, there's five hidden chunks of yarn.

42:39.480 --> 42:42.280
You can build one of Yoshi's missing friends.

42:42.280 --> 42:45.200
For example, you might get Moo Moo Yoshi in one level.

42:45.200 --> 42:46.760
That's a cow and it's adorable.

42:46.760 --> 42:47.760
I mean, it really is.

42:47.760 --> 42:48.760
Right.

42:48.760 --> 42:49.760
I like the watermelon Yoshi.

42:49.760 --> 42:50.760
Oh yeah.

42:50.760 --> 42:51.760
It's adorable.

42:51.760 --> 42:52.760
The circus Yoshi looks like a butthole to me.

42:52.760 --> 42:55.560
Like, I don't know why they have, that looks really offensive.

42:55.600 --> 43:03.640
I'm just saying, um, but what my, the sunflower one, the very first one you got, we're not

43:03.640 --> 43:04.640
going to get into that.

43:04.640 --> 43:05.640
Why?

43:05.640 --> 43:06.640
All right.

43:06.640 --> 43:07.640
And then, um, what was I going to say?

43:07.640 --> 43:09.120
Uh, Oh, the amiibo.

43:09.120 --> 43:13.920
So the amiibo unlock different skins for the Yoshi as well, that kind of look like the

43:13.920 --> 43:15.460
character of the amiibo.

43:15.460 --> 43:17.180
And some of them are really bad.

43:17.180 --> 43:20.440
Like the Mr. Game and Watch is just a solid black Yoshi.

43:20.440 --> 43:21.640
Like how boring is that?

43:21.640 --> 43:23.140
Blackface Yoshi.

43:23.140 --> 43:24.480
That's that's tacky.

43:24.600 --> 43:30.040
Um, but the mega man one is super cute and it makes it like actually get like these little

43:30.040 --> 43:31.520
like ears and so forth.

43:31.520 --> 43:34.200
Uh, and the Sonic one is actually my favorite one.

43:34.200 --> 43:36.200
Just like that blue is really cute.

43:36.200 --> 43:37.200
That was my favorite.

43:37.200 --> 43:40.040
I don't have Sonic, but I saw that one on YouTube and I'm like, that is amazing.

43:40.040 --> 43:41.040
Looking at the red shoes.

43:41.040 --> 43:44.040
It's just blue with red shoes, but it has the coloration of like, you know, his body

43:44.040 --> 43:45.040
a little bit too.

43:45.040 --> 43:46.040
It's so awesome.

43:46.040 --> 43:51.080
That's awesome that they support, you know, amiibos from other games, unlike Splatoon

43:51.080 --> 43:52.080
that does not.

43:52.200 --> 43:55.800
Well, the weird thing is it pretty much does run with all the amiibo.

43:55.800 --> 43:57.800
It even works with the Splatoon amiibo.

43:57.800 --> 44:00.880
Duck Hunt Dog was my other favorite one, by the way, because actually no Pokemon.

44:00.880 --> 44:02.660
There's no Pokemon.

44:02.660 --> 44:06.120
And I don't know if that's because there's an issue, a game freak where it's like, we

44:06.120 --> 44:08.920
don't want our characters to look different or something.

44:08.920 --> 44:12.880
I have a weird feeling that's what comes into play where it's like, no, Pikachu is Pikachu

44:12.880 --> 44:14.880
and Yoshi's not allowed to look like Pikachu.

44:14.880 --> 44:19.600
I just, but yeah, the Pokemon don't work.

44:19.600 --> 44:20.600
I know.

44:20.600 --> 44:21.600
I know.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
Very weird.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.200
Go to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

44:25.200 --> 44:29.920
Kaijuto says, little big planet is yarn, should be used to yarn by now.

44:29.920 --> 44:30.920
Is it?

44:30.920 --> 44:32.280
I don't remember it being yarn.

44:32.280 --> 44:33.280
It's more like fabric.

44:33.280 --> 44:34.280
It's more, it's fabric.

44:34.280 --> 44:35.280
It's not yarn.

44:35.280 --> 44:36.280
Yeah.

44:36.280 --> 44:37.280
No, what's yarn?

44:37.280 --> 44:38.280
It's literal sackcloth.

44:38.280 --> 44:39.280
It's not yarn.

44:39.280 --> 44:40.280
Yeah, it's like cloth.

44:40.280 --> 44:41.280
It's canvas.

44:41.280 --> 44:42.280
Yeah.

44:42.280 --> 44:43.280
It's a rough burlap.

44:43.280 --> 44:46.720
It's a trip to Joanne's fabrics, but you know, it's a little bit different.

44:46.720 --> 44:47.720
I don't know.

44:47.720 --> 44:52.000
SSJ100Matt says, I'm close to buying a pink yarn Yoshi for my girlfriend.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.160
She doesn't own a Wii U, but she'll think it's cute.

44:54.160 --> 44:57.600
I got to say those yarn Yoshi are done pretty darn well.

44:57.600 --> 45:00.680
Those little yarn Yoshi amiibo, which the pink one is probably the only one you're going

45:00.680 --> 45:04.400
to be able to find at this point, but they are really cute.

45:04.400 --> 45:06.600
So all right, there it is.

45:06.600 --> 45:09.640
That's going to do it for my gaming week.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.640
Quickly some housekeeping.

45:11.640 --> 45:15.040
We are going to be here for the next few weeks, although it sounds like we may not be here

45:15.040 --> 45:18.840
Thanksgiving week, but I bet a lot of you guys probably won't be either, so that probably

45:18.840 --> 45:19.840
won't be a big issue.

45:19.840 --> 45:24.320
We'll get you posted on that a little closer to November.

45:24.320 --> 45:29.660
Also we will be, Dark Soccer and I will be at GamerX in December in San Jose, so look

45:29.660 --> 45:30.660
forward to that.

45:30.660 --> 45:33.160
We were going to have a little table, which we're still trying to figure out what we're

45:33.160 --> 45:34.160
going to do with it.

45:34.160 --> 45:37.340
If you guys have suggestions, you should let us know, but I think I know what we might

45:37.340 --> 45:39.340
do.

45:39.340 --> 45:42.700
And then I just want to say like on a totally selfish, like unrelated note, but I have to

45:42.700 --> 45:44.380
get this out of my system.

45:44.380 --> 45:46.220
I was very honored yesterday.

45:46.220 --> 45:50.420
This has nothing to do with games, so I apologize, but we had a convention here in Sacramento,

45:50.420 --> 45:53.820
Sinister Creature Con yesterday, which was a first year con.

45:53.820 --> 45:57.860
And it was pretty cool because they had like all the, it was a very random assortment of

45:57.860 --> 45:58.860
guests.

45:58.860 --> 46:02.700
Like they had a Kristen Bauer, I think her name is, she's Maleficent on Once Upon a Time

46:02.700 --> 46:04.060
and she was in True Blood.

46:04.060 --> 46:05.180
She's pretty cool.

46:05.180 --> 46:10.740
And they had like some of the cast from Terror Vision and the kid from Pet Sematary was all

46:10.740 --> 46:11.740
there.

46:11.740 --> 46:15.540
And they also had three of the actors from the Rocky Horror Picture Show were there.

46:15.540 --> 46:20.220
Barry Bostwick, who played Brad, Lil Nel, who played Columbia and Patricia Quinn, who

46:20.220 --> 46:21.220
played Magenta, were actually-

46:21.220 --> 46:22.220
Dame Patricia.

46:22.220 --> 46:24.820
Lady Stevens, I think is, she's Lady.

46:24.820 --> 46:25.820
Lady.

46:25.820 --> 46:27.700
I thought she was, I thought she was Dame, Dame.

46:27.700 --> 46:28.700
Mm-mm.

46:28.700 --> 46:29.700
Okay.

46:29.700 --> 46:30.700
That's Dame Edna.

46:30.700 --> 46:31.700
No, I'm just kidding.

46:31.700 --> 46:32.700
No, but no-

46:32.700 --> 46:33.700
Who was in Shock Treatment.

46:33.700 --> 46:34.700
I'll have to double check now because I thought she was.

46:34.700 --> 46:35.700
I thought she was Lady.

46:35.700 --> 46:40.860
But anyway, she is a Lady, but I will say this, and you guys that might know my history with

46:40.860 --> 46:44.900
podcasting know that before I was doing Orange L'Andrea, I was doing a show called Under

46:44.900 --> 46:48.100
Sedation Live, which is still on, but not for much longer.

46:48.100 --> 46:49.100
It was only-

46:49.100 --> 46:50.100
She is Lady.

46:50.100 --> 46:51.100
She is Lady.

46:51.100 --> 46:52.100
I didn't know that.

46:52.100 --> 46:53.100
Okay.

46:53.100 --> 46:54.100
Oh no, I'm sorry.

46:54.100 --> 46:55.100
Yes.

46:55.100 --> 46:56.100
I did know that.

46:56.100 --> 46:57.100
All right.

46:57.100 --> 46:58.100
Stop confusing me.

46:58.100 --> 47:01.780
So before I was doing this, I was doing Under Sedation Live, which was about Rocky Horror

47:01.780 --> 47:03.860
and I was big into that community.

47:03.860 --> 47:05.060
So I was really honored.

47:05.060 --> 47:10.060
I got to host the panel at this convention, a 40th anniversary celebratory panel with

47:10.060 --> 47:14.460
these celebrities and I got to talk to them and introduce myself backstage and we actually

47:14.460 --> 47:17.540
got to actually have this panel where we ask questions.

47:17.540 --> 47:19.580
It was really well received.

47:19.580 --> 47:23.420
So I just wanted to thank Sinister Creature Con for that experience because in some ways,

47:23.420 --> 47:28.260
and I know this has nothing to do with gaming, but it kind of brings a lot of my hobbies

47:28.260 --> 47:30.220
and things like that full circle.

47:30.220 --> 47:35.260
To get to do that was just awesome and really put a point.

47:35.260 --> 47:40.980
And it also showed me that maybe someday here on OLR, we can get some of the big gaming

47:40.980 --> 47:43.520
celebrities I've always wanted to have on the show.

47:43.520 --> 47:46.780
Like me personally, I want to have Sid Meier on someday because you all know how I feel

47:46.780 --> 47:48.140
about civilization.

47:48.140 --> 47:49.140
So that would be one of my dream guests.

47:49.140 --> 47:51.940
Do you guys have any dream guests for OLR?

47:51.940 --> 47:54.380
Like somebody we have to interview before we throw in the towel?

47:54.380 --> 47:57.780
Reggie Fils-Aime, I think is on the bucket list.

47:57.780 --> 48:01.780
Reggie would be funny.

48:01.780 --> 48:05.500
I don't know.

48:05.500 --> 48:06.860
Let's get Troy Baker.

48:06.860 --> 48:07.860
Troy Baker.

48:07.860 --> 48:10.500
Or what was his name?

48:10.500 --> 48:11.980
We get a lot of awesome voice.

48:11.980 --> 48:13.620
We have another voice actor on the show tonight.

48:13.620 --> 48:14.620
Why not?

48:14.620 --> 48:15.620
We're getting Tara Strong.

48:15.620 --> 48:17.260
Let's get Tara Strong as well.

48:17.260 --> 48:18.260
Do all three of them.

48:18.260 --> 48:19.260
Why not?

48:19.260 --> 48:20.420
How about you Darcyra?

48:20.420 --> 48:21.860
It's got to be something Bioware.

48:21.860 --> 48:22.860
Jennifer Hale.

48:22.860 --> 48:27.220
Well, yeah, that would be cool, but I would actually like to get concept designers.

48:27.220 --> 48:28.220
Okay.

48:28.220 --> 48:33.020
Some of the actual people who work on the artwork who come up.

48:33.020 --> 48:35.140
Actually I'd like Patrick Weeks.

48:35.140 --> 48:41.500
I'd like some of the other writers at Bioware to come in.

48:41.500 --> 48:46.900
Let's get Gabe Newell and he'll just announce Half-Life 3, but no one will know because

48:46.900 --> 48:49.900
no one listens to the show.

48:49.900 --> 48:50.900
That's right.

48:50.900 --> 48:52.980
And no one's going to believe us anyways.

48:52.980 --> 48:54.480
No one would believe us.

48:54.480 --> 48:58.800
This dog and pony show known as Orange Lounge Radio that's dedicated to DDR, because they

48:58.800 --> 49:04.720
just checked the website that's a little bit out of date, and says that Half-Life 3 could

49:04.720 --> 49:07.560
claim to have Gabe on their show and that Half-Life 3 did.

49:07.560 --> 49:08.560
Sure they did.

49:08.560 --> 49:09.560
Sure they did.

49:09.560 --> 49:13.120
But to be perfectly serious, I'd like some of the people who work behind the scenes who

49:13.120 --> 49:18.400
maybe don't get the big recognition to come on the show and talk about what they do.

49:18.400 --> 49:23.320
I think that there needs to be a bigger respect for the concept artists, for the design, for

49:23.320 --> 49:25.480
the level layout, the music designers.

49:25.480 --> 49:29.300
People need to, I think, hear about their contributions into the games that they like

49:29.300 --> 49:31.200
instead of just the people at the top of the food chain.

49:31.200 --> 49:36.760
Or just like Charles Martinet to have him do all the voices.

49:36.760 --> 49:37.760
I would love that.

49:37.760 --> 49:38.760
I was being serious.

49:38.760 --> 49:40.600
No, I know, I know.

49:40.600 --> 49:41.600
Let's see.

49:41.600 --> 49:45.120
Going to our chat room, actually I love this answer, this is a completely serious answer

49:45.120 --> 49:46.120
too.

49:46.120 --> 49:47.120
Dungeon Buster, Richard Garriott.

49:47.120 --> 49:48.120
Yes.

49:48.120 --> 49:49.120
Oh my god, yes.

49:49.120 --> 49:51.040
I love hearing that man speak at conventions.

49:51.040 --> 49:53.200
I would love to have Lord British on the show.

49:53.200 --> 49:56.240
Anyway, there it is, bucket list guests.

49:56.240 --> 49:59.900
If you happen to know any contacts for any of these people, tell them about our little

49:59.900 --> 50:05.840
dog and pony show and that we're a safe place to talk about whatever, because nobody listens.

50:05.840 --> 50:07.600
I know who you need to get on here.

50:07.600 --> 50:08.600
Who?

50:08.600 --> 50:10.320
Mega Man.

50:10.320 --> 50:11.320
Just actual Mega Man?

50:11.320 --> 50:12.320
Just Mega Man, yeah.

50:12.320 --> 50:13.320
Just actual Mega Man?

50:13.320 --> 50:14.760
He's been in a lot of games, so he would probably have a lot to talk about.

50:14.760 --> 50:16.400
Well, he's probably pretty bored right now, actually.

50:16.400 --> 50:17.760
Yeah, you could have talked about his-

50:17.760 --> 50:18.760
He's unemployed.

50:18.760 --> 50:19.760
He's unemployed right now.

50:19.760 --> 50:22.160
You could talk about his little known soccer career.

50:22.160 --> 50:23.160
There you go.

50:23.160 --> 50:24.160
Yeah.

50:24.160 --> 50:25.160
Yeah.

50:25.160 --> 50:26.160
We'll get Mega Man on the show.

50:26.160 --> 50:27.160
We'll work on that.

50:27.160 --> 50:30.240
All right, let's get into some gaming news for the week.

50:30.240 --> 50:34.000
We still have a pretty, it was a pretty slow news week, admittedly, but we still have a

50:34.000 --> 50:37.880
lot of ground to cover, so Loki's starting us off, I think, with some rumors, yes?

50:37.880 --> 50:39.780
Of course.

50:39.780 --> 50:45.640
It's another week, so there's another week of Nintendo NX rumors, and this week's rumor

50:45.640 --> 50:52.160
is that the dev kits are going out, which I guess that makes sense since, you know,

50:52.160 --> 50:54.800
isn't this supposed to be coming out next year or something like that?

50:54.800 --> 50:58.200
I mean, 2016's the year of gaming, right?

50:58.200 --> 51:04.920
Yeah, so unfortunately, we don't know too much about it, but apparently, people are

51:04.920 --> 51:09.640
seeing the dev kits, and they're saying that it's kind of a combination of like a portable

51:09.640 --> 51:12.440
and home console combined.

51:12.440 --> 51:15.200
I don't know.

51:15.200 --> 51:17.920
So it's an all-in-one combo system.

51:17.920 --> 51:18.960
Something like that, yes.

51:18.960 --> 51:25.640
So yeah, and they're basically saying that, you know, it could be that there's a secondary

51:25.640 --> 51:31.440
piece of the NX that could be like a Wii U gamepad or handheld or something like that,

51:31.440 --> 51:32.440
so they're not sure.

51:32.440 --> 51:35.400
I'm wondering if they're like thinking it's, I don't know, because I always thought they

51:35.400 --> 51:39.480
would be cool if the gamepad could be like a portable system, so maybe that's kind of

51:39.480 --> 51:44.040
what they're doing with that, where it is, it's like a, you know, 3DS hardware built

51:44.040 --> 51:48.440
into it or something, I don't know.

51:48.440 --> 51:49.440
I guess we'll see.

51:49.440 --> 51:54.960
I hope it's good, and the other rumor I saw was it's cutting edge, you know, technology

51:54.960 --> 52:00.640
or something like that, so I hope that's true, because I would love to see like another kind

52:00.640 --> 52:04.120
of Wii, you know, disturbance thing, you know, where they just kind of...

52:04.120 --> 52:05.840
Okay, here's the thing with that, though.

52:05.840 --> 52:10.320
I just want to caution people, because some people that are reading really a lot into

52:10.320 --> 52:13.240
that are forgetting something very important.

52:13.240 --> 52:18.000
When the Wii U was announced, when the Wii U came out, the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox

52:18.000 --> 52:19.000
One were not out yet.

52:19.000 --> 52:21.640
Remember, the Wii U got a one-year head start on the others.

52:21.640 --> 52:27.640
The Wii U was ahead of the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, but not by much.

52:27.640 --> 52:28.640
You know what I mean?

52:28.640 --> 52:32.800
It didn't ultimately end up mattering, so I just, I want to caution people to get too

52:32.800 --> 52:35.080
excited about that.

52:35.080 --> 52:36.080
Not necessarily.

52:36.080 --> 52:38.840
It wasn't ahead of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

52:38.840 --> 52:45.240
It was supposed to be, spec-wise, maybe stronger than them, but it still can't run the engines

52:45.240 --> 52:46.800
that even those systems can run.

52:46.800 --> 52:51.440
Like it can't do Frostbite, for example, that's why you don't have a lot of those, you know,

52:51.440 --> 52:53.200
Battlefield games and stuff like that on there.

52:53.200 --> 52:55.900
It just can't run them.

52:55.900 --> 53:01.280
So I don't think, even though the specs may be up there, it's just, it's not able to run...

53:01.280 --> 53:03.320
It's about equivalent to those systems, maybe.

53:03.320 --> 53:04.360
You know what's interesting, though?

53:04.360 --> 53:10.400
If it is one of these handheld and combo, well, you know, Nintendo's always been very

53:10.400 --> 53:13.400
good about backwards compatible games, and we've always kind of been wondering, like,

53:13.400 --> 53:15.800
how's Wii U's successor going to emulate Wii U games?

53:15.800 --> 53:19.560
Well, if it does end up being a combo system, that's going to emulate Wii U games pretty

53:19.560 --> 53:21.840
easy, isn't it?

53:21.840 --> 53:24.720
Because the game pad or whatever would be like your...

53:24.720 --> 53:30.340
It sounds to me like it's a more powerful Wii U where the game pad truly works anywhere,

53:30.340 --> 53:32.400
or by itself, essentially.

53:32.400 --> 53:36.280
Like you could take it and use it anywhere as its own system.

53:36.280 --> 53:40.920
It would be nice to take that someplace and be able to play games on it and then bring

53:40.920 --> 53:41.920
it back home.

53:41.920 --> 53:45.160
But I'm curious if it couldn't be, like, separated as well.

53:45.160 --> 53:49.960
Like, does that mean Nintendo is going to sell a console and, I mean, are they going

53:49.960 --> 53:51.960
to sell it separately or are they going to sell it as a combo?

53:51.960 --> 53:52.960
I don't know.

53:52.960 --> 53:53.960
It's just a lot of unanswered questions.

53:53.960 --> 53:54.960
We'll see, I guess.

53:54.960 --> 53:55.960
Yeah.

53:55.960 --> 53:56.960
I don't...

53:56.960 --> 54:03.200
Like, you know, usually I'm like, rumors, whatever, but a lot of this seems like a logical

54:03.200 --> 54:05.660
next step for Nintendo.

54:05.660 --> 54:11.920
It's interesting, though, that when some people are like, the Wii U was not, you know, very

54:11.920 --> 54:16.120
successful, it's interesting that they're going to go all in on it, essentially.

54:16.120 --> 54:17.120
I hope they do.

54:17.120 --> 54:18.560
This is the vision for it.

54:18.560 --> 54:23.680
Please, God, have someone that knows what they're doing network-wise because, like,

54:23.680 --> 54:28.040
seriously, this, like, antiquated bullshit, you know, where they're just starting to figure

54:28.040 --> 54:31.560
out how to do all this stuff, that needs to end.

54:31.560 --> 54:34.920
They need to, like, forget that happened and be on board with what's going on now.

54:34.920 --> 54:38.280
Well, and one big thing they'll end up doing that's going to put it in a huge position,

54:38.280 --> 54:40.600
you know they're going to change the name, drastically.

54:40.600 --> 54:42.280
The new name will not be Wii anything.

54:42.280 --> 54:46.760
It's going to be a brand new something we haven't thought of.

54:46.760 --> 54:48.320
It could be another made-up word.

54:48.320 --> 54:52.280
It could be another very simple thing like Wii, but it's not going to be NX.

54:52.280 --> 54:54.320
These development names never stick.

54:54.320 --> 55:00.040
So, it could be another, like, weird simple made-up word, but it could be like the Nintendo

55:00.040 --> 55:04.320
Go, because it's on the go.

55:04.320 --> 55:05.760
It could be something very simple.

55:05.760 --> 55:06.760
No, please don't.

55:06.760 --> 55:07.760
We had a PSP Go.

55:07.760 --> 55:08.760
That's true.

55:08.760 --> 55:09.760
Nintendo.

55:09.760 --> 55:10.760
Nintendo!

55:10.760 --> 55:18.160
I always thought they should just go back to its roots and just call it a Nintendo

55:18.160 --> 55:20.040
Entertainment System.

55:20.040 --> 55:21.040
Why not?

55:21.040 --> 55:22.880
They're always playing the Nintendo.

55:22.880 --> 55:23.880
That's right.

55:23.880 --> 55:24.880
Take that word back.

55:24.880 --> 55:25.880
All right.

55:25.880 --> 55:30.520
Act deft and chat says Nintendo Go, Pokemon Go, oh God.

55:30.520 --> 55:33.840
You know, though, if this handheld device is something that works anywhere, imagine

55:33.840 --> 55:36.000
what if it has cellular capability in it.

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
It might.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
It will probably at least be Wi-Fi.

55:38.000 --> 55:39.000
Oh my God.

55:39.000 --> 55:42.440
Imagine how many pedophiles are going to have access to your children.

55:42.440 --> 55:44.600
Oh God.

55:44.600 --> 55:47.600
But it, it, it, the other interesting thing, and I have to get this out of my system, the

55:47.600 --> 55:52.560
other very interesting thing about the fact, if the tech is superior to PlayStation 4 and

55:52.560 --> 55:57.640
Xbox One and meaning like by a significant amount, it's going to be interesting if

55:57.640 --> 56:04.320
Nintendo forces this cycle to move faster than Sony and Microsoft originally planned.

56:04.320 --> 56:06.980
Because that could be a very interesting side effect of this.

56:06.980 --> 56:11.320
If Nintendo is very successful with this and people start developing games for Nintendo

56:11.320 --> 56:18.040
system that won't work on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, it's going to force the PlayStation

56:18.040 --> 56:23.020
5 and the Microsoft successor out faster than maybe they intended.

56:23.020 --> 56:26.520
And I know I'm being very tinfoil hat-ish right now, but I think that could be a very

56:26.520 --> 56:27.520
interesting side effect.

56:27.520 --> 56:28.520
If Nintendo is successful.

56:28.520 --> 56:29.960
No, I don't think so.

56:29.960 --> 56:33.480
I don't think it's going to affect anything because they're all kind of doing their own

56:33.480 --> 56:34.480
thing.

56:34.480 --> 56:40.160
I mean, we'll see where the VR stuff goes because what if that takes off and then who,

56:40.160 --> 56:41.160
I don't know.

56:41.200 --> 56:44.200
I don't know really where it's going to go.

56:44.200 --> 56:45.200
We'll just have to wait and see.

56:45.200 --> 56:46.400
That's what's kind of fun about it.

56:46.400 --> 56:51.960
Let's wait and see and have no expectations so we can't be let down because they will

56:51.960 --> 56:52.960
do that.

56:52.960 --> 56:53.960
Alright.

56:53.960 --> 57:01.320
Well, otherwise, it's just rumors and we'll find out when we hear at E3 2016.

57:01.320 --> 57:05.080
It seems inevitable that this is going to be a huge highlight of the show.

57:05.080 --> 57:11.080
Well, a little sooner than next year's E3, Halo 5 is going to come out really soon.

57:11.080 --> 57:14.840
Halo 5 is out, what, just a couple of weeks, right?

57:14.840 --> 57:20.960
There is some free DLC available for Halo 5 and you actually don't need, well, obviously

57:20.960 --> 57:23.960
it's free because you don't need to spend any money on it, but you do have to spend

57:23.960 --> 57:25.480
a little bit of time.

57:25.480 --> 57:29.640
So there's an interactive site that 343 Industries and Microsoft has put out there where your

57:29.640 --> 57:36.240
Master Chief versus Spartan Lock and there's five videos dedicated to each person's point

57:36.240 --> 57:37.240
of view.

57:37.240 --> 57:42.400
You sit through the ten, and they're less than ten second clips, I guess, you are rewarded

57:42.400 --> 57:44.560
with a free Rec Pack.

57:44.560 --> 57:46.640
That's Halo 5's microtransactions.

57:46.640 --> 57:52.680
They're two dollars, I guess, but 343 swears, you get the currency fast enough you don't

57:52.680 --> 57:54.880
have to necessarily spend actual money.

57:54.880 --> 57:59.040
So why even make it a microtransaction in the first place?

57:59.040 --> 58:01.480
Because you're willing to spend the money.

58:01.480 --> 58:03.920
They aren't incentivizing you to buy that stuff.

58:03.920 --> 58:08.000
I'm sure people that are super into Halo and the lore anyway are going to sit through this

58:08.000 --> 58:11.320
what adds up to what, like three minutes worth of videos.

58:11.320 --> 58:15.600
So it's fine, I don't think it's too big a video.

58:15.600 --> 58:19.760
I am all for a little extra something for free.

58:19.760 --> 58:25.960
But yeah, hopefully you're not having to spend a lot of money on top of the $60 as it is

58:25.960 --> 58:26.960
already.

58:26.960 --> 58:32.780
Bonds006 in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, dear room, I want that damn new Halo

58:32.780 --> 58:33.780
game.

58:33.820 --> 58:34.820
A lot of people do.

58:34.820 --> 58:36.260
I don't think you are alone in that.

58:36.260 --> 58:37.260
Just saying.

58:37.260 --> 58:38.260
You're in good company.

58:38.260 --> 58:39.260
DarkSakura.

58:39.260 --> 58:42.220
Well, we love our Humble Bundle, don't we?

58:42.220 --> 58:46.660
Yes, I just bought the Capcom one this week.

58:46.660 --> 58:47.660
So did I.

58:47.660 --> 58:49.180
Dan already had like most of the games in it.

58:49.180 --> 58:51.980
I didn't even mention that during my game of the week, but I played Ultra Street Fighter

58:51.980 --> 58:52.980
4 on my PC.

58:52.980 --> 58:53.980
Cool.

58:53.980 --> 58:56.620
I forgot to mention the game I played, but I'm not going to mention it though.

58:56.620 --> 58:58.860
So I actually had a developer give me a game.

58:58.860 --> 59:00.820
Oh, well, then don't bring it up.

59:00.820 --> 59:01.820
All right.

59:01.820 --> 59:02.820
Oh, so did I.

59:02.860 --> 59:06.860
I was given a game too, but I haven't started it yet.

59:06.860 --> 59:09.860
Well, everybody here is special but me.

59:09.860 --> 59:17.060
Well, Humble Bundle, as a lot of us know, they do the pay what you want for games, and

59:17.060 --> 59:24.220
you can have the money be distributed between the developer, Humble Bundle, or the charity.

59:24.220 --> 59:30.860
Well, they actually, I think, have been bitten a little bit in the butt by this because they

59:30.860 --> 59:34.900
had to let go some of their employees.

59:34.900 --> 59:43.780
They just, it says that their hiring was too ambitious and they had to make a hard call.

59:43.780 --> 59:52.580
It says that they let off, let about 12 people go, which, I mean, 12 people is a lot for

59:52.580 --> 59:54.260
a smaller company.

59:54.260 --> 59:58.220
So I would say that if you don't want to see this happening, then make sure that you

59:58.220 --> 01:00:02.860
just contribute a little bit more fundage toward them.

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:09.620
I try to make sure that I split things about 50-50 between Humble Bundle and the charity

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:14.380
if it's a developer that I'm pissed off at.

01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:16.540
Usually I'll do them in equal thirds.

01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:19.780
So that's it.

01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:28.020
Yeah, I guess sometimes even companies that are very charitable can end up in these predicaments,

01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:33.780
especially if it's true that they were overstaffed, but, you know, they do a lot of good stuff

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:37.140
out there, especially with the charity work, so it's difficult to hear about this, but

01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:42.260
I understand if it's too heavy, then they're not able to effectively give the money to

01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:43.260
the charities.

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:45.260
So, yeah, that could be bad.

01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:47.460
So, all right.

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:48.460
Moving on.

01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:49.460
Loki.

01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:50.460
All right.

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:54.660
And so, funny enough, I was looking at Ingress and now I'm talking about the company that

01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:56.820
makes Ingress, Niantic.

01:00:56.820 --> 01:01:02.500
They've got some funding now for Pokemon Go thanks to Nintendo and the Pokemon Company.

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:04.780
$20 million!

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:08.620
That's definitely going to help them out and it'll be interesting to see how they use that

01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:16.820
money to make this kind of, I don't know, real world Pokemon game.

01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:21.300
Along with that, though, they said with the $20 million investment, apparently if they're

01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:28.380
eligible to make another $10 million, if they meet its milestones as well.

01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:31.900
So they could essentially make $30 million off Pokemon Go.

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:35.420
When I don't, you know, and people ask, how do they make money off Ingress?

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:36.420
I don't know.

01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:37.420
I don't know.

01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:40.060
Well, it was a Google project for the longest time and Google, I don't, how's Google funding

01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:41.700
the self-driving cars?

01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:45.780
They just, they have money in the bank that they're spending on these pet projects.

01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:51.020
But now that Niantic's more off on their own, you know, they're having to, I guess, come

01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:54.340
up with the other funding, although, you know, again, just to acknowledge Ingress does

01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:55.820
have like sponsorships in it.

01:01:55.820 --> 01:02:00.700
Some of the names of the items are called like named after companies, but it's just

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:01.700
a few.

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:06.060
There's not a lot, but there was one, uh, like about six months ago, every Jamba Juice

01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:08.460
was a portal, but then they removed that.

01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:10.340
The Jamba Juices are no longer all portals.

01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:11.660
Yeah, I know.

01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:12.660
Right.

01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:15.860
Used to, uh, used to be an excuse for me to go get one of those pumpkin smoothies, but

01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:16.860
whatever.

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:19.580
So, uh, yeah, I don't know.

01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:23.420
Well, I know a lot of people that are really excited about Pokemon Go.

01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:26.580
Uh, Shane, you're a big Pokemon fan.

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:29.820
Are you going to check out Pokemon Go, especially now that you've actually dabbled in Ingress

01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:30.820
a little bit?

01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:31.820
Yeah, I'll try it.

01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:32.820
Yeah.

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:36.060
Um, I want to see like how ridiculous it is.

01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:41.180
So like, will I have to drive to Montana to get to a certain Pokemon or will everything

01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:45.220
kind of be available around me or how it's going to work?

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:49.100
I just need more details before I really feel like I can jump in.

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:52.380
I'm really excited about the beta test and I hope it's true that Ingress players are

01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:53.580
going to get the jump on that.

01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:54.580
I play Ingress.

01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:56.220
Can I have a beta test?

01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:59.260
You actually, you might, you might have to be a certain level, but I don't know.

01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:01.740
That better not be the case.

01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:02.740
We'll see.

01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:06.980
Um, but, uh, yeah, I know a lot of Ingress players, there's even a lot of chat amongst

01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:07.980
that group.

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:13.980
Like, so who's going to end up not playing anymore because of Pokemon and most people

01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:16.020
I talked to say they're going to play both.

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:22.100
Probably most of the people that are on the blue side and hey, you guys even it out a

01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:23.100
little bit.

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:24.100
Just even it out.

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.100
Yeah.

01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:26.100
I think it's, I think it's a little bit, a little bit of both.

01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:27.100
Uh, let's see.

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:31.940
Act Efton chat over at live.vognotework.com says, I know I'm excited for Pokemon Go despite

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:32.980
I don't play Ingress.

01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:34.500
My brother though, he's Ingress junkie.

01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:35.500
Yeah.

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:38.420
Funny how I forgot to mention that during my gaming week about how much Ingress I played

01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:39.420
this week.

01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:41.220
There's a reason why I stopped talking about it.

01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:42.220
Yeah.

01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:45.500
Uh, and Akuma JP in chat says, I've tried Ingress.

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:47.300
I have no idea what to do.

01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:53.940
It isn't the easiest concept to pick up at first, but essentially you have resonators,

01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:58.060
you have bursters, resonators is how you capture things.

01:03:58.060 --> 01:03:59.540
Bursters is how you blow up the other.

01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:03.420
Just watch like some, a couple of YouTube videos on like, uh, getting started with it.

01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:05.980
And actually if you play through the tutorial, it'll kind of walk you through it.

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:08.780
Cause that when I first got into, I was like, eh, I don't know what I'm supposed to be doing,

01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:10.200
but I have a better idea now.

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:15.060
It really helps to be at a park or a place where there's likely to be portals when you're

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:16.060
learning the game.

01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:17.060
It'll help you a lot.

01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:18.060
I think.

01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:19.060
Or at work.

01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:20.060
Yeah.

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:21.540
Or, or with coworkers who can explain it to you.

01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:22.540
Absolutely.

01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:23.540
All right.

01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:24.540
Uh, let's see.

01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:27.540
Bonds double six says, I was wondering if real world malls and cities would have some

01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:28.540
perks.

01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:31.980
Well, I mean the malls all here have several portals at them.

01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:36.060
So if Niantic is just going to use the same database for Ingress as they're going to use

01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:40.100
in Pokemon go, then I would think, yeah, a lot of malls and things are going to have

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:41.300
tons of Pokemon.

01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:46.300
But this also means cemeteries are going to be the place to get, which is where I want

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:47.300
to go.

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:50.060
But I see where that starts to get a little weird.

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:51.780
No, I don't.

01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:52.780
I want to go tonight.

01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:57.140
She wouldn't go play Ingress at the cemetery tonight.

01:04:57.140 --> 01:05:00.060
I'm already planning on stopping a few places on the way home.

01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:01.540
I've got a fucking problem.

01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:04.820
I seriously, why am I looking at a map?

01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:06.260
Why do I have it turned on my phone?

01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:07.260
I have a problem.

01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:10.220
I need serious help.

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:12.180
I can relate.

01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:13.820
It's an addictive game.

01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:14.820
It really is.

01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:15.820
All right.

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:17.740
I took work off Tuesday, by the way.

01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:18.740
Did you?

01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:20.500
Originally I wasn't playing Ingress, but I'm actually going to work on my costume.

01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:21.500
I still only play some Ingress.

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:22.500
You're going to do both.

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:23.500
You know you're going to do both.

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:24.500
Eleven hours of Ingress.

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:25.500
All right.

01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:30.940
Moving on, let's talk about something a lot more old school, but still very Nintendo.

01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:32.420
Donkey Kong Jr.

01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:34.100
Whatever happened to Donkey Kong Jr.?

01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:39.020
I mean, because Donkey Kong kind of split off into the whole Donkey Kong Country universe,

01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:43.260
and then there was Diddy Kong and Dixie Kong and all that, but whatever happened to Donkey

01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:44.420
Kong Jr.?

01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:49.820
Well, if you believe trademark-related things, a new trademark has been filed for Donkey

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:51.260
Kong Jr.

01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:54.260
This was found, of course, on the United States trademark website, and that's how people snoop

01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:55.620
around and find all this stuff.

01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:57.480
It was filed just over a month ago.

01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:04.060
It was filed by Nintendo of America under, quote, downloadable electronic game programs,

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:08.500
downloadable electronic video game software, electronic game programs, electronic game

01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:12.340
software, video game programs, and video game software.

01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:15.980
So could this mean that Donkey Kong Jr. is due for a revival?

01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:17.380
I would say no.

01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:20.660
It's probably just that Donkey Kong Jr. is coming to Virtual Console, because I don't

01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:21.940
think it's on Virtual Console.

01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:23.060
I could be wrong.

01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:24.460
I don't think it is.

01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:28.980
So that seems like the easier answer is that they're just renewing it because Donkey Kong

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:31.460
Jr. will be on Virtual Console.

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:36.580
But it could also be, what if Donkey Kong Jr. is one of the new Smash Brothers characters?

01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:37.580
Could be.

01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:38.580
So you never know.

01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:41.740
They might, you know, the character might end up showing up somewhere else.

01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:44.820
Would you guys be interested in a revival of Donkey Kong Jr.?

01:06:44.820 --> 01:06:45.820
No.

01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:46.820
No?

01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:47.820
I like the arcade game, but...

01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:48.820
It was okay.

01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:49.820
I like the Coleco...

01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:52.260
I think I had it on Coleco.

01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:54.220
I liked that one.

01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:55.220
But I...

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:56.220
No.

01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:57.220
Not really.

01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:58.220
Just...

01:06:58.220 --> 01:06:59.420
What I would like to see them do is something new.

01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:00.420
Or...

01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:01.420
I don't know.

01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:02.420
A new Metroid or...

01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:03.420
I don't know.

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:04.420
A new F-Zero would be nice.

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:05.980
Do we need another fucking Donkey Kong game?

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:07.540
I mean, seriously.

01:07:07.540 --> 01:07:10.420
They just put out one on the Wii U not too long ago.

01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:11.420
Cool.

01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:14.260
Let's go to another franchise you haven't touched for a while.

01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:20.100
Alan Alchemy in chat with a little FYI saying Diddy Kong was originally Jr., but Nintendo

01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:24.660
forced the name change because he didn't look anything like the overalls Jr. Nintendo already

01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:27.460
came up with, if I recall correctly.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:28.460
And if I...

01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:32.180
Rare had developed Donkey Kong Country, so maybe Nintendo is being very protective of

01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:37.240
the character saying, this looks nothing like Donkey Kong Jr., so you can't name him that.

01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:40.380
So maybe that's part of how things got split off.

01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:43.380
But it would be interesting if Nintendo revisited that world.

01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:49.060
You know, I could expect that Nintendo's gonna surprise us, you know, now that we've seen

01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:51.020
that original IPs work.

01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:55.260
Not that necessarily Donkey Kong Jr.'s original, but, you know, if they're not gonna end up

01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:58.140
doing another Donkey Kong Country game, maybe they're gonna take a strong character and

01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:03.460
still come up with some type of new platforming type of thing, so that it's different than

01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:04.900
the country universe we're used to.

01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:05.900
I don't know.

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:07.900
Any thoughts, Donkey Kong Jr.?

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:10.620
I barely remembered it when I was talking about it earlier tonight.

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:14.380
I think it would be interesting, though, if Mario is the villain again.

01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:18.380
That's the other thing that is it, you know, remember, Mario was the villain in those games.

01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:19.380
Would they do that?

01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:20.380
They would never do that now.

01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:21.380
I don't know.

01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:23.380
They'd just make it Wario or something.

01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:24.380
Yeah, that's true.

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:26.860
It'd probably end up being Wario.

01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:29.260
Or Mario is under influence.

01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:34.300
You find out that the whole time, Mario is under a spell of somebody else.

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:36.220
That'll be how they work their way out of it.

01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:42.260
Why don't they have, like, a Wario Waluigi equivalent of Princess Peach?

01:08:42.260 --> 01:08:43.260
I thought they did.

01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:44.260
A bad girl?

01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:46.540
Yeah, like a bad female character.

01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:47.540
Wasn't there a bad Daisy?

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:48.540
I thought there was.

01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:49.540
I don't remember.

01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:50.540
Maybe I'm crazy.

01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:51.540
I don't know.

01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:55.940
Daisy was in Mario Land, which Wario was the villain in, but...

01:08:55.940 --> 01:09:03.220
I always liked Waluigi's name as a pun, because it always makes me think Wari isn't bad.

01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:04.220
Oh, okay.

01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:05.220
Yeah.

01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:06.220
But...

01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:10.220
Alan Alchemy says, that's who Petsch is, Princess Petsch.

01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:12.380
I thought I thought there was a bad princess.

01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:13.380
No.

01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:19.500
No, Petsch was a person's, uh, crap, me.

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:20.500
Oh.

01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:21.500
Never mind.

01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:24.460
I posted that ages ago on my...

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:25.460
Princess Petsch is a meme.

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:26.460
Yeah, I was gonna say Princess Petsch.

01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:27.460
I'm gonna find it.

01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:28.460
It's on my Tumblr somewhere.

01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:31.620
Princess Petsch sounds like, you know, Sanic or, you know, Danky Kang.

01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:33.260
Danky Kang.

01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:36.060
I don't remember seeing Princess Petsch as a Jeopardy answer.

01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:38.860
We could make a cool bad girl princess in the Mario universe.

01:09:38.860 --> 01:09:39.860
That would be awesome.

01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:43.540
Excuse me if I can't keep up with the 5,000 memes that are out there on the internet.

01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:44.540
Alright.

01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:45.540
Anyhow.

01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:48.020
Oh, Alan Alchemy is giving me a link here.

01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:49.300
Hold on.

01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:50.300
So let me see.

01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:54.820
Apparently I'm being exposed to a meme for the first time, or I'm gonna go, oh, that.

01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:57.140
Oh, yeah, I've seen that.

01:09:57.140 --> 01:09:58.140
Okay.

01:09:58.140 --> 01:09:59.140
That's a meme?

01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:00.140
Really?

01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:01.140
Yeah.

01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:02.140
Yeah, okay.

01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:03.140
It's just somebody's me character.

01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:05.420
It's, and their face is just smushed together.

01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:06.420
Whatever.

01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:08.780
That's not even funny.

01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:12.740
He had just posted it the same time I found my, uh, thing on Facebook.

01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:15.640
That's not nearly as funny as the Wat Lady.

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.940
And Lonk.

01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:19.220
Or Danky Kang.

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:23.900
Yeah, my, um, my, uh, Tumblr link in there has Lonk.

01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:26.020
And someone's fanart of the two of them.

01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:30.340
Alright, moving on, DarkSakura, please take us out of meme territory.

01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:31.340
No.

01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:33.540
I'm trying to get us deeper into it.

01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:40.980
So, um, there is a little bit of flak 2K, uh, Games is Taking.

01:10:40.980 --> 01:10:48.300
Uh, they tried to bring in, uh, one of the journalists from, uh, Giant Bomb, Jeff Girtzman,

01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:54.420
who has a role called Dr. Tracksuit, that he uses to promote PAX Wrestling events.

01:10:54.420 --> 01:11:04.300
Um, well, they made a likeness of him in WWE 2K6, and it was in their trailer, and so he

01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:09.420
caught a view of it, and was like, hey, that's not cool, I didn't give anyone permission

01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:10.420
for this.

01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:15.220
In fact, the actual tweet says, kind of not okay with someone, uh, using something similar

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:21.340
to my likeness to promote a franchise that has been so terrible for so long.

01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:29.100
Well, they changed the, uh, the, uh, preview and removed the portion out of it.

01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:30.100
Mmm.

01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:31.660
That's almost an admission of guilt.

01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:37.540
Yeah, I hope that they've learned their lesson, but I'm sure there's gonna be a way to recreate

01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:39.740
them in the actual game.

01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:40.740
So.

01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:44.540
Um, was, did they punch him in the face in the trailer?

01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:46.380
Like did this guy give him a bad review?

01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:47.860
It's insane, I didn't watch it.

01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:50.820
They wanted to suplex him in the video like he was a train?

01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:56.320
See I rather, uh, agree with his opinion of the franchise.

01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:58.020
So I won't play it.

01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:01.420
I will not, I will not play that Sam I am.

01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:03.940
Even with Green Eggs and Ham.

01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:05.500
Fair enough.

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:10.500
Uh, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says he's only showed up coming down the entrance ramp.

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:14.420
Okay, so, cause I thought maybe like he'd given the game a bad review, so they punched

01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:17.900
him in the face in the trailer and I would have thought like, well that's pretty clever

01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:20.500
but that's also really, really wrong.

01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:24.460
So I guess it's for the best it ended up being, um, changed.

01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:27.780
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of games that

01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:30.700
are coming out, uh, this next week.

01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:33.300
Starting with the US, Loki.

01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:37.140
So there's, we're in the thick of it, so there's a lot of games coming out this week.

01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:42.380
Um, starting off with Guitar Hero Live will be making its way up finally.

01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:45.420
I played a demo of that at a Target.

01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:47.940
I do not like what they did with the controller.

01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:51.140
I guess it's innovative but it's not fun.

01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:52.420
Have you seen the controller?

01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:53.820
I haven't.

01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:55.900
They have the frets, there's six of them.

01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:56.900
There's three.

01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:57.900
Three and two rows.

01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:02.940
Yeah, and it's so weird to try to move your fingers back and forth because, you know,

01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:07.060
you either have to hit one row or the other row and it's just, it doesn't feel good but

01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:08.260
maybe that's how real guitar is.

01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:09.420
I don't really know.

01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:13.660
Um, yeah, I don't know, I don't play guitar so I can't really say.

01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:22.060
But yeah, Guitar Hero Live coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and

01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:23.060
Wii U.

01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:30.620
Also, coming out this week, Just Dance 2016 on pretty much all platforms.

01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:34.540
Gravity Falls, they're having a game come out on 3DS.

01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:37.140
Let's see.

01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:42.580
And then, I'm not sure if this is accurate or not, but they have a Halo 5 Guardians limited

01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:45.860
collector's edition on Xbox One that's coming out this week.

01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:49.780
Although I know Halo 5 actually comes out next week, so I'm not positive if this is

01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:55.120
something, if you spend $250 you get it a week early or if it's just an incorrect date.

01:13:55.120 --> 01:14:00.260
I'm willing to bet it's an incorrect date but, you know, just thought I'd mention it.

01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:05.380
Tales of Zestiria is coming out on PlayStation 3 and also collector's edition on PlayStation

01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:10.060
4 and I believe a regular edition on PlayStation 4 as well.

01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:18.980
Just Dance Disney Party 2 coming out on Xbox 360 and Wii U and Wii and I believe PlayStation

01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:19.980
3.

01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:32.180
Also, Adventure Time Finn and Jake Investigations on PlayStation 4, 3DS, Wii U and Xbox 360.

01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:36.740
Let's see, there's a lot of games coming out.

01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:42.060
Dragon Ball Z Extreme Butoden coming out on 3DS.

01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:47.740
Hasbro Family Fun Pack on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:53.900
They're doing like a combo pack for Disney games, Frozen and Big Hero 6, kind of a re-release

01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:55.900
there.

01:14:55.900 --> 01:15:02.780
Let's see what else we have coming out.

01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:05.740
Guitar Hero once again, with that, Guitar Hero Live they're also doing like a bundle

01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:10.220
pack with two guitars as well in case you want an additional guitar on top of the one

01:15:10.220 --> 01:15:11.660
that it comes with.

01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:16.620
And Just Dance 2016 Gold Edition, they're putting out a special edition for that as

01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:17.620
well.

01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:21.620
I believe that's, oh wait, nope, nope.

01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:23.540
Doing these crappy Sunday releases.

01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:27.180
So thank you Ubisoft.

01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:32.420
Assassin's Creed Syndicate, they have a version of that that's going to be coming out on Friday,

01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:36.740
so that's on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:38.380
And then that would be it for the week.

01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:41.260
Alright, wow, busy week in the US.

01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:43.940
Japan traveling over there, it's a lot lighter.

01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:47.760
There's not really the same level of releases over there that we have here, but we do have

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.540
just a few things coming out.

01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:55.820
Sengoku Musou 4 gets a price reduction as it moves into the Koei Tecmo The Best collection

01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:57.580
over on the PlayStation 4.

01:15:57.580 --> 01:16:03.500
I do not believe anything is out on the Wii U this week in Japan, nope, in fact I think

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:06.900
now that Woolly World's come out, I don't think there's anything for quite a while until

01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:07.900
we get into November.

01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:12.100
However, if you go to the handhelds, the story's a little different because on the 3DS this

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:15.860
week, and I think this is the big tent pole for the week, The Legend of Zelda Triforce

01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:18.420
Heroes is out in Japan on the 22nd.

01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:20.340
So obviously that's a big title.

01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:21.980
That's a really good game I didn't talk about.

01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:22.980
Oh, did you play the demo?

01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:24.340
I played the demo.

01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:25.700
It was really fun.

01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:30.020
I did not have any expectations going into it.

01:16:30.020 --> 01:16:31.020
Is it a lot like Four Swords?

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:34.660
Yes, but with one less person and costumes.

01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:39.500
And it's just neat, like the costumes, the ones we had in the demo were kind of stupid.

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:44.540
Does it work with all the Amiibo on the 3DS too for costumes like Yoshi does?

01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:47.740
I don't think it does anything with Amiibo, it may do something with Toon Link, I don't

01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:48.740
know.

01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:53.860
But we got to pick from a Tingle costume or a Zelda costume, and they all had their own

01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:55.340
power-ups.

01:16:55.340 --> 01:16:59.140
Like the little emotes, because you can't voice chat, the emotes are so much fun and

01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:03.100
you can keep tapping them over and over to make them bigger and louder, to get people's

01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:04.100
attention.

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:05.100
It's cool.

01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:06.100
Alright.

01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:09.700
Well, also on the 3DS, if for whatever reason Triforce Heroes isn't your thing, Pri Para

01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:13.740
Mezase Idol Grand Prix No. 1 is also out this week.

01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:15.100
I'm sure that is a winner.

01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:16.100
I don't know though.

01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:17.980
I don't know anything about that game.

01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:25.380
Lastly, over on the PlayStation Vita, I actually don't think, oh, some price reductions this

01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:26.380
week.

01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:32.820
Senkoku Musou 4, Maju, and then one new game from Prototype called Flowers Natsu Hen comes

01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:35.380
out this week on the PlayStation Vita.

01:17:35.380 --> 01:17:36.380
That's it for Japan.

01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:37.380
How about Europe?

01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:40.540
Oh, a few things, just a few.

01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:48.820
We have on the 20th, Deathwatch Enhanced Edition, Rebel Galaxy, and Tales of Zestiria.

01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:52.380
On the 21st, Kingdom for Mac and PC.

01:17:52.380 --> 01:18:00.060
On the 22nd, Dovetail Games Euro Fishing, and Noct for PC and for Mac.

01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:08.740
And on the 23rd, I think the 23rd is this week, I can't even remember what day it is,

01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:14.100
Assassin's Creed Syndicate for a bunch of stuff, Guitar Hero Live for a bunch of stuff,

01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:27.020
including iOS, Just Dance 2016, Let's Sing 2016, and Warhammer End Times Verminetide

01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:28.420
on PC.

01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:30.380
I think that's it.

01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:31.380
That is it.

01:18:31.380 --> 01:18:34.800
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week,

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:36.300
but first, Loki.

01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:41.620
Alright, so this kind of sucks, but apparently more accounts have been hacked.

01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:48.940
There was a data dump that they did on PaySpin that included about 600 origin accounts, including

01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:59.340
Gmail addresses, passwords, and games tied to accounts.

01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:04.540
They're saying that, and basically these were kind of like the first part of a dump, maybe.

01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:09.780
They're saying they're letters A through F as far as the names.

01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:13.820
Right now, they're saying at this point, there's no indication that the list was obtained through

01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:19.940
an intrusion of our account databases, but because of that, you still might want to take

01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:26.380
caution to make sure that you're changing your passwords and that type of stuff.

01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:27.820
I don't know.

01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:30.820
That's not too reassuring, though.

01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:31.820
No it is not.

01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:36.380
Email addresses and passwords and stuff.

01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:39.260
Just make sure you're not reusing your passwords.

01:19:39.260 --> 01:19:41.820
You know, a game I didn't talk about during my gaming week, probably because I didn't

01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:45.060
play an awful lot of it, but it's something I played through Origin, and again, this is

01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:46.940
kind of Shane's fault, but not really.

01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:47.940
He didn't really pressure me to play this.

01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:49.340
I was just like, oh, I'll try it again.

01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:54.020
I played Star Wars The Old Republic, which is an EA, it's an online MMO, and I haven't

01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:57.540
played it since it first came out, and when it went free to play, and I was like, oh,

01:19:57.540 --> 01:19:59.860
let me see how the graphics are.

01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:02.420
There's Star Wars hysteria in the world right now.

01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:04.020
They've got an expansion coming out.

01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:07.620
What the poster for the new movie came out today, and everybody's going, oh my God, you

01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:10.060
know, right, over that, so I was like, oh, I'll check out The Old Republic.

01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:11.980
I didn't play a lot of it, though.

01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:16.220
I actually probably played more Final Fantasy XIV than I did Star Wars The Old Republic,

01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:17.260
which is a bit of a change.

01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:21.700
I've been kind of taking a break from XIV lately because I really need a content patch,

01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:25.620
but I'm very excited about the pet battles in the new patch, but anyway, just kind of

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:28.700
made me think of that as a, I haven't really been playing a lot through Origin lately,

01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:30.140
but I did play that.

01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:33.100
But Shane, you didn't talk really about this during your gaming week, Star Wars The Old

01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:34.100
Republic.

01:20:34.100 --> 01:20:35.100
Are you having a good time with it?

01:20:35.100 --> 01:20:38.260
Because I couldn't play it because my computer's graphics card was too good, remember?

01:20:38.260 --> 01:20:40.260
Yeah, but you're further along than I am, so you may be playing that.

01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:42.300
Yeah, because I just did a little bit here and there.

01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:43.300
It's fun.

01:20:43.300 --> 01:20:46.460
I don't want to get back into an MMO, really, so.

01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:47.460
Yeah, I hear you.

01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:53.820
It's just a neat little diversion while my Hunt for Power Ranger toys is kind of cooled.

01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:54.820
That's how I feel.

01:20:54.820 --> 01:20:57.340
It's like an, oh, neat kind of thing, but I don't think I'm going to get sucked back

01:20:57.380 --> 01:20:58.380
into it at all.

01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:00.900
It's kind of like when I played Neverwinter for like a week.

01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:02.860
I was like, oh, okay, it's kind of neat.

01:21:02.860 --> 01:21:07.060
Now I feel a little more like I know a little more about this MMO, but that's it.

01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:13.700
Anyhow, you know, we are now living in a world where there is not just one video game streaming

01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:17.820
service, but there's two between Twitch TV and YouTube gaming, and of course, you know,

01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:22.580
the other, you know, kind of under the bubble streaming services as well.

01:21:22.580 --> 01:21:26.420
But I think a lot of us have been trying to see, oh, what's going to happen in this competition

01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:27.940
versus Twitch and YouTube?

01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:30.820
Well, YouTube did a very interesting move this week.

01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:38.220
YouTube gaming updated their app, and now you can actually stream from a mobile phone

01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:39.220
if it's Android.

01:21:39.220 --> 01:21:43.460
It actually will not work on the iPhones, and I'm assuming that's because the iPhones

01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:47.140
are a little more locked down in the OS, so I don't think one app can kind of bleed into

01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:48.500
another.

01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:51.540
But if you have Android, you can actually do streaming from mobile.

01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:53.060
That's kind of exciting, actually.

01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:56.740
You can use the front cam to actually do commentary as you play along with the mobile

01:21:56.740 --> 01:21:57.740
game.

01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:02.380
I did not realize this, but I guess stuff like Clash of Clans is, like, huge on YouTube,

01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:06.140
and I, you know, I gotta be honest, that's not, is that the one Mariah Carey does the

01:22:06.140 --> 01:22:07.140
ads for now?

01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:08.140
I have no idea.

01:22:08.140 --> 01:22:09.820
It's like, dang, what happened to you, girl?

01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:12.100
She is, is that, or is that Game of War?

01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:14.700
I thought that was Liam Neeson did Clash of Clans.

01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:15.900
Is it?

01:22:15.900 --> 01:22:16.900
I don't know.

01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:17.900
What's the other one?

01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:22.800
It's always that fucking ad on YouTube where Mariah Carey is like, and it was somebody

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:25.400
else before her, some supermodel pretty girl.

01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:26.400
Kate Upton?

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:27.400
Yeah.

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:28.400
The Kate Upton game?

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:29.400
Yeah.

01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:30.400
Which one's that?

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:31.400
Oh, I don't remember.

01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:32.400
Alan will shout it out in chat as soon as, okay.

01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:33.400
They're all, they all blend together.

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:34.400
Oh, they're all yelling, it's Game of War.

01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:35.720
Thank you.

01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:36.720
That's different.

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:37.720
Um.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:44.080
SSJ100 Matt in chat says, ugh, I'm envisioning people streaming themselves going through

01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:45.080
Tinder.

01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:50.400
That's kind of fucked up, though, like, don't broadcast people who don't, you know, who

01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:52.640
didn't give you permission to do that, you know what I mean?

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:54.280
Don't broadcast things like Tinder.

01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:55.280
All right.

01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:57.720
And Act F says Clash of Clans is the one with the cartoony looks.

01:22:57.720 --> 01:22:58.720
All right.

01:22:58.720 --> 01:22:59.720
Well, now I understand.

01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:00.720
Thank you.

01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:05.080
I would stream myself playing Flappy Bird because that game was really infuriating sometimes,

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.080
remember?

01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:08.040
You guys remember when Flappy Bird was cool?

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:10.080
I never played it.

01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:11.080
Yeah.

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.840
I think Hearthstone would be fun to stream on my phone.

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:14.840
Oh, yeah.

01:23:14.840 --> 01:23:15.840
Yeah.

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:16.840
Hearthstone's a fun game.

01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:17.840
Well, that's a good one.

01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:21.200
You get so frustrated because you get, you play really well, then this insane card comes

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.200
out.

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:23.200
You're like, no!

01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:24.640
I can see the rage.

01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:28.480
That's when, um, uh, the Hearthstone's a huge one on PC.

01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:29.480
Anyway.

01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:30.480
Yeah, I know.

01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:31.480
It's one of the biggest streamers on Twitch.

01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:35.080
And so, but, but I think having the mobile phone, if it uses the camera and it's pointing

01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:37.480
like right up at your face, I think it's just hilarious.

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:38.480
All right.

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:43.200
Well, also, uh, rolling out on YouTube fan funding and sponsorships, and I guess this

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:45.600
is being tested with some streamers right now.

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:51.880
Uh, there's live chat stuff, uh, extra there, exclusive chat sessions, and more apparently

01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:53.240
being planned with that.

01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:56.640
So, um, interesting to see what's developing on that front.

01:23:56.640 --> 01:24:00.040
And I got to admit, as somebody who's trying to get into streaming more and more, like

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:03.800
I kind of can't decide, do I want to do Twitch or do I want to do YouTube?

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:07.880
Like, I feel like the discoverability is a little better on Twitch right now.

01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:11.800
And you know, they've got a pretty solid community over there, but then it's like, oh, but YouTube,

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:16.200
you know, probably opens up monetization to everybody, but let's be real.

01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:18.120
I'm not going to make any money off of it.

01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:21.160
And I kind of, I kind of think the stream is better quality on YouTube because you can

01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:23.400
do the 1080p at 60 frames a second.

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:24.400
So I don't know.

01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:25.400
I don't know.

01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:28.040
I'm, I'm trying to decide and it can't, it's just, there's perks to, I think inevitably

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:31.920
I'll have to juggle both, but then do I want to spread myself thin like that?

01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:32.920
I don't know.

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:33.920
All right.

01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:37.940
Well, remember, we're going to take a trip back and remember the days when you couldn't

01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:40.460
like stream these games.

01:24:40.460 --> 01:24:43.740
You could take like a Polaroid picture and that was it.

01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:47.580
It's a classic game of the week.

01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:52.380
Dark soccer is going to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, Hey,

01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:59.700
enough with your clash of clans, game of war, mobile phone streaming stuff.

01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:02.500
This is back when Mariah Carey had number one hits.

01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:06.900
This is before Mariah Carey had number one hits.

01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:11.460
This is when you can't do that on television was actually still on TV.

01:25:11.460 --> 01:25:12.460
This is before.

01:25:12.460 --> 01:25:14.660
This was when Mariah Carey gets back on.

01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:16.180
It was back on for a minute.

01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:17.180
What?

01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:18.180
Yeah.

01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:23.380
Nickelodeon had that splat channel or something like that.

01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:24.380
And it was gas.

01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:25.380
Right?

01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:26.380
No, no, no.

01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:27.380
I don't think that existed anymore.

01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:29.220
That was a new channel splatter thing.

01:25:29.220 --> 01:25:30.220
It's coming on.

01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:31.220
It's all the nineties.

01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:32.220
Yeah.

01:25:32.220 --> 01:25:33.460
And then at night, I'm sorry.

01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:34.460
I'm very sorry.

01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:36.580
But nineties Nickelodeon is very important.

01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:37.860
Did gas turn into splat?

01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:39.340
No gas was just went away a long time ago.

01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:40.980
That was a really good channel though.

01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:45.140
Um, no, it had stuff like you can't do that on television.

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:46.140
Are you afraid of the dark?

01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:47.140
Oh my God.

01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:48.140
This is amazing.

01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:49.140
Clarissa explains it all.

01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:50.140
Yeah.

01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:51.140
It was really cool looking.

01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:54.700
And of course I don't have cable so I can watch it, but I apologize to dark soccer,

01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:56.700
but you did say you can't do that on television.

01:25:56.700 --> 01:26:01.500
So, all right, anyhow, she just rolled her eyes so hard.

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:03.300
It's the introduction to the opposite.

01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:04.300
All right.

01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:05.300
Dark soccer.

01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:11.860
Classic game of the week, punch out, which, which she's about to do to one of the hosts.

01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:15.740
I'm about to do something anyway.

01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:19.540
Punch out was a actually a whole series of boxing games.

01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:27.140
It was created by a Nintendo general manager, uh, Daniel Takeda and uh, done also by a Makato

01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:28.140
Wada.

01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:33.500
The, uh, we had the arcade version, which was punch out with exclamation points.

01:26:33.500 --> 01:26:38.300
And then there was a sequel, which was super punch out exclamation points.

01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:43.580
So there were all kinds of different versions that came out later for the home market and

01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:52.140
even fairly recently for the home market again, and even had a spinoff called arm wrestling,

01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:55.820
which only came out in North American arcades.

01:26:55.820 --> 01:27:02.260
And it was also Nintendo's last arcade game that they independently developed and released.

01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:09.980
So, um, it really is just, you're going through a character by character, trying to punch

01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:10.980
them.

01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:16.020
You play as little Mac and you're trying to win the world video boxing association championship

01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:24.100
and you fight different, a very stereotypical characters to say the least.

01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:29.260
And um, basically you just have to knock them out, but everyone's going to have their own

01:27:29.260 --> 01:27:31.420
different super attack and their own patterns.

01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:36.580
So you really have to just learn how to beat them properly.

01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:43.100
You will also get a visual cue that lets you know when they're about to do their big, uh,

01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:44.980
super powered attack.

01:27:44.980 --> 01:27:51.180
So, um, as far as different versions that have been out, cause I mean, there's really

01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:55.340
not too much else to say about fucking punch out cause it's, you know, punch out, um, there

01:27:55.340 --> 01:27:59.820
was punch out arcade, which was the first one punch out boxing for game and watch super

01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:06.900
punch out that came out arcade, uh, CPC, Commodore 16, Commodore 64, Commodore plus,

01:28:06.900 --> 01:28:10.060
uh, MS-DOS and ZX spectrum.

01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:16.420
Then there was arm wrestling in 1985, uh, punch out slash Mike Tyson's punch out that

01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:22.700
came out on the NES, um, Wii, uh, virtual console, Nintendo 3DS virtual console and

01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:24.380
Wii U virtual console.

01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:30.940
Now something to say about this is that Mike Tyson's punch out was under a special license

01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:36.060
after, um, they, uh, lost the licensing rights.

01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:42.060
It then became just punch out again with, I think it was Mr. Dream as the final, the

01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:43.060
final boss.

01:28:43.060 --> 01:28:44.060
But interesting.

01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:47.900
You know, you hear, you can hear in the video left, right, left cause we're looking at the

01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:53.340
arcade version here, which, you know, I, I remember playing as a kid and I'm kind of

01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:56.700
looking at this going, wow, I didn't realize how much of Mike Tyson's punch out, which

01:28:56.700 --> 01:28:59.340
I'm more familiar with, had like a lot of this stuff.

01:28:59.340 --> 01:29:00.340
Like kid quick.

01:29:00.340 --> 01:29:01.340
This guy was not in.

01:29:01.340 --> 01:29:02.340
Yeah.

01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:03.340
Tyson's at all.

01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:04.340
The ball bold.

01:29:04.340 --> 01:29:08.980
The last guy was, but the last Joe, the last guy in this was a super macho man, right?

01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:09.980
I think so.

01:29:09.980 --> 01:29:10.980
Yeah.

01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:11.980
I'm pretty sure it was like the end boss.

01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:15.940
And the other thing too, is that graphically, the reason why we had teensy tiny little Mac

01:29:15.940 --> 01:29:19.420
is because, um, they wouldn't have been able, I think part of it was that they couldn't

01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:20.700
have the size of the character.

01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:24.700
They would have also been able to do the transparencies for the green grid.

01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:27.700
They just didn't have the memory for it.

01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:32.260
Um, so little Mac was teeny Mac as I would call him.

01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:34.340
I didn't know it was the licensing issue though.

01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:36.980
I thought it was all because of Mike Tyson's legal troubles or something.

01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:37.980
No, it was licensing.

01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:38.980
So was that before that?

01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:39.980
Yeah.

01:29:39.980 --> 01:29:40.980
Oh, I didn't know that.

01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:41.980
Yeah.

01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:42.980
I think the legal troubles came soon after.

01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:47.780
So in my mind, like growing up, I always like related to like, Oh, they can't have that

01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:48.780
anymore after, you know.

01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:49.780
You went to jail for rape.

01:29:49.780 --> 01:29:51.780
For beating up and cheating on your wife.

01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:52.780
Asshole.

01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:53.780
Yeah.

01:29:53.780 --> 01:29:54.780
Anyway.

01:29:54.780 --> 01:29:57.780
Um, after that we had Punch Out for Wii and Wii U.

01:29:57.780 --> 01:30:04.220
Then we had Doc Lewis's Punch Out, which was a WiiWare standalone.

01:30:04.220 --> 01:30:09.540
So it was only a download exclusive to the 2009 Club Nintendo Platinum members.

01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:15.380
And then it was re-released with a hundred other titles that were claimed by a general

01:30:15.380 --> 01:30:16.840
Club Nintendo members.

01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:20.040
So it was only Club Nintendo.

01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:25.320
And so, uh, there were all kinds of fun characters in this series.

01:30:25.320 --> 01:30:29.200
Um, just to go through the list, cause there's a lot of them.

01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:34.120
There was Aaron Ryan, Bald Bull, I'm going in order, Bear Hugger, Bob Charlie, Disco

01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:37.880
Kid, Doc Lewis, Don Flamenco, Donkey Kong.

01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:40.560
God, there's actually just a bunch more.

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:41.560
Yeah.

01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:44.760
Um, my favorite, always King Hippo, just because he was hilarious.

01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:53.280
Um, we had Gabby J, Glass Joe, Great Tiger, Heike Kagero, um, Hoi Karlo, uh, Kid Quick,

01:30:53.280 --> 01:31:01.600
King Hippo, uh, Lil Mac as an opponent, uh, Mad Clown, Mast Muscle, Mike Tyson, Mr. Dream,

01:31:01.600 --> 01:31:10.680
Mr. Sandman, Narciss Prince, uh, Nick Bruiser, Piston Honda, Piston Hurricane, Pizza Pasta,

01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:18.440
Rick Bruiser, Soda Popinski, which who originally was supposed to be, uh, um, uh, Vodka something.

01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:19.800
I'm gonna have to look him up again.

01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:22.600
We had Super Macho Man and Von Kaiser.

01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:26.720
Let me see if I can find Soda Popinski, cause he's actually got his little article on it.

01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:30.600
Okay, he was supposed to be Vodka Drunkinski.

01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:35.960
He first appeared in Super Punch Out and was called Vodka Drunkinski.

01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:38.920
And then he changed it from Mike Tyson's Punch Out.

01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:39.920
Huh.

01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:45.000
Yeah, I can't imagine that Nintendo of the 1980s made that change.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000
Who knew?

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Eh.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000
You think they're bad with the family stuff now.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.160
Good lord, you should have seen them back then.

01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:57.160
Well, um, the characters of course made plenty of other, um, you know, appearances.

01:31:57.160 --> 01:32:00.760
We've, uh, had like trophies in Super Smash Brothers.

01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:06.720
We've had, uh, I believe, were there a couple of Howard and Nestor?

01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:12.720
And then, um, the SNES version of Super Punch Out was in the GameCube version of EA's Fight

01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:14.600
Night Round 2.

01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:24.640
Um, and then you could also play Lil Mac, um, in, uh, uh, in the same game.

01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:26.120
He was an unlockable.

01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:30.840
Um, so it was, it was, you know, there were a lot of crossovers in there, but yeah, this

01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:33.480
game was pretty cool.

01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:35.200
Alright.

01:32:35.200 --> 01:32:41.760
There it is, your classic game of the week, Punch Out, which you can play in the arcade

01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:44.280
or you can play one of the, uh, many other home versions.

01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:49.000
Found what it was I was thinking of, there was a, a Punch Out title that was in the Nintendo

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.000
comic system.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:51.000
Oh.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.000
That was it.

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:57.560
I have a little Punch Out like kind of memory real quick is, uh, it's a recent memory, but

01:32:57.560 --> 01:33:03.000
it's, you know, I, I love Games Done Quick, but the way I found out about Games Done Quick

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:07.720
was people on Twitter were talking about that guy, Sinister One, was playing Punch

01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:10.220
Out blindfolded on a stream.

01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:11.720
And Tyre Claude just brought that up in chat.

01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:12.720
Oh, that's funny.

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:13.720
Oh yeah.

01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:16.040
I haven't been looking at the chat tonight, but yeah, it was actually the creator of Adventure

01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:20.360
Time tweeted it out and I was following him and uh, yeah, he said like, there's someone

01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:24.720
playing Mike Tyson's Punch Out blindfolded right now, everybody should go check it out.

01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:27.280
And I checked it out and I've been watching the streams ever since.

01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:30.080
That's what got me into Games Done Quick.

01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:31.080
I love Games Done Quick.

01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:32.920
Yeah, no, it's a good, good marathon.

01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:33.920
For the record.

01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:37.480
We were having a conversation last night about other games done blindfolded, all of which

01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:44.080
I have two, which is the Dragon Stage in Mega Man 2, I used to be able to do that blindfolded

01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:46.360
and then 8-1 in Super Mario Brothers.

01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:47.360
Dang.

01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:50.880
I did blindfolded, uh, Pagle on a stream once and that was funny.

01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:51.880
Yeah.

01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:55.560
I think Shane watched that one and then, uh, you were there for that one?

01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:56.560
I don't remember.

01:33:56.560 --> 01:33:57.560
I see.

01:33:57.560 --> 01:33:58.560
I didn't know that.

01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:03.560
But, uh, there's a, there's an achievement on Unfinished Swan to, I didn't really do

01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:07.080
a blindfolded, but you have to get through the first level, which is all white, pretty

01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:08.080
much.

01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:09.080
And you spray paint everywhere.

01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:10.080
We're using only like three paint balls.

01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:13.720
And I was like, this is like a blindfold challenge because you have to be so quiet and listen

01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:15.700
to your steps and where you're going is pretty cool.

01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:16.700
That's a more recent game.

01:34:16.700 --> 01:34:20.320
But yeah, there's a, there's a trophy and you get the trophy by not using too much paint.

01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:21.320
So yeah.

01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:22.320
Excellent.

01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:23.320
Blindfold games.

01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:24.320
Fun.

01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:25.320
Fun.

01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:26.320
All right.

01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:30.320
Thanks for participation for this week's episode of Orange Laundry Radio at vognetwork.com.

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:31.320
Use the passphrase, Neil.

01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:35.760
Uh, that's going to do it for this first half of Orange Laundry Radio, but don't go anywhere.

01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:40.640
We got more, including rapid fire news, the Fugu question of the week, your emails and

01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:42.700
listless when we come back.

01:34:42.700 --> 01:34:44.920
And tonight we actually have something very special.

01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:49.360
Usually we do a music break, uh, in between part A and part B, but tonight we actually

01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:54.480
have, thanks to DJ Rama S from Anime Jam Session, bringing us a very special exclusive interview

01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:56.160
with Kyle Hebert.

01:34:56.160 --> 01:35:01.080
And if you don't know that name, uh, he is actually a very prolific anime voice actor

01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:02.720
as well as video games.

01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:07.520
He is the voice of Ryu in Street Fighter IV and like Smash Brothers with the DLC and all

01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:08.520
that.

01:35:08.520 --> 01:35:09.520
So, uh, we're going to get right to it.

01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:11.520
We're going to get over to Rama with this interview.

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:14.920
It is about 15 minutes and I do want to say the audio quality is a little different than

01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:19.360
us here in studio because I think, uh, uh, Rama had his little audio recorder and it

01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:22.200
sounds like they're in a back room at this anime convention somewhere.

01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:27.560
Uh, so please excuse, uh, what might be perceived as, uh, uh, some rough audio, but, uh, good

01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:28.560
content.

01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:33.020
So, uh, we'll be back and a big thanks to Rama S for this interview and, uh, we'll be

01:35:33.020 --> 01:35:35.160
back in about 15 minutes on the other end of this interview.

01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:36.160
Take it away, Rama.

01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:44.520
Hey everyone, DJ Rama S here from Anime Jam Session.

01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:51.520
We're at AAC, another anime convention, 2015, Sunday, we're up, we're running about and

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:53.600
they decided to give us some awesome interviews today.

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:55.300
So we're going to take advantage of that.

01:35:55.300 --> 01:36:02.560
And today on my right, we're here with prolific voice actor, Kyle, a bear, Hey Kyle, how's

01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:03.560
it going?

01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:04.560
I'm an excellent man.

01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:08.480
I'm just trying to wake up and another fantastic weekend under our belt pretty much.

01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:09.920
That is awesome.

01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:12.840
First thing first, I want to say is congratulations on your upcoming Nopos.

01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:13.840
Oh yeah.

01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:14.840
Yeah.

01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:15.840
Thank you.

01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:16.840
Thank you.

01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:17.840
Thank you very much.

01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:21.160
So is it true to theme is going to be Gohan and Videl?

01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:24.720
Oh, I don't know about that.

01:36:24.720 --> 01:36:25.720
Don't know about that.

01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:30.120
She's thinking like, okay, long engagement and something private.

01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:31.120
Let's elope.

01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:32.120
Let's save money.

01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:37.360
If you're going to blow money on anything wedding related, save it for the honeymoon.

01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:38.360
Big trip somewhere.

01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:39.360
There you go.

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:41.360
And how far are you from Vegas?

01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:44.840
A five hour drive.

01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:45.840
Very scenic.

01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:51.640
But you know, God, if she had her way, she's just like, let's do it on the beach, barefoot

01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:56.680
in the sand, you know, something quiet and simple.

01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:58.840
And I'm like, can we live stream it?

01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:04.840
Can I periscope it like, get the big sigh and the judgy face.

01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:10.320
Well, we're techno geeks or techno nerds, it comes with the territory.

01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:11.320
Right.

01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:12.320
Right.

01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:13.320
Yeah.

01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:14.320
It's like, take me as I am, honey.

01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:15.320
Yeah.

01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:16.320
So it's been a while since we've interviewed you.

01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:19.320
I think last time was like anime and acts like 2011 or something like that.

01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:20.320
Back in the day.

01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:22.320
And it may have been the same year I was here.

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:23.320
2011, 2012.

01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:24.320
Probably.

01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:25.320
It was an older venue.

01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:26.320
Like the hotel looked like a castle.

01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:27.320
I remember that.

01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:28.320
Yeah.

01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:29.320
Everyone was telling me about that.

01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:34.400
I started coming up here to like move to this location.

01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:35.800
This is a pretty swanky location.

01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:36.800
I dig it.

01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:38.920
I've had a blast here every year I've gone.

01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:39.920
Yeah.

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:40.920
Good on you.

01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:45.640
So, tell me, how did you get into becoming the voice of Ryu from Street Fighter?

01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:49.280
Man, well, like, you can actually insert this answer for anything.

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:51.520
How did you get any fill in the blank role?

01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:52.520
There you go.

01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:53.520
You auditioned.

01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:55.520
But how do you audition, Kyle?

01:37:55.520 --> 01:37:56.520
You gotta know people.

01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:58.520
Well, how do you know people, Kyle?

01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:05.520
Well, you know, it's this long process of training first and a lot of luck.

01:38:05.520 --> 01:38:08.040
A lot of luck.

01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:12.200
You know, being in the right place at the right time, knowing the right people, getting

01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:16.360
on someone's radar, as it were.

01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:21.080
For years, I've been recording with new generation pictures on various things through the years.

01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:28.720
Ergo Proxy, a bunch of RPG stuff, The Dawn of Mana, I was trying to think of stuff before

01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:29.720
that.

01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:36.800
Ultimately, I think we did like Hellsing Ultimate, I did like a mercenary guy on that.

01:38:36.800 --> 01:38:43.800
And because I was kind of on that list, recording with them on various anime projects and Japanese

01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:48.520
RPG stuff, they said, hey, we got this big project, we can't tell you what it is, in

01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:52.760
fact it's so big that you have to sign an NDA just to audition.

01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:55.600
I go, ooh, ooh, ooh, I wonder what it is.

01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:59.400
So I get to the studio, I try out, and they hand me this three ring binder.

01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:02.640
And it says, alright, oh wait, you haven't signed the NDA yet.

01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:04.640
Okay, alright, sign the NDA.

01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:09.240
Alright, when you open this three ring binder, you will probably recognize what it is.

01:39:09.240 --> 01:39:10.240
Don't freak out.

01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:18.240
So I open this ring binder and I'm like, ooh, is this what I think he asked?

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:19.240
Okay.

01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:21.440
It's like, pick who you want to read for.

01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:25.640
So naturally I had to read for you.

01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:33.160
Let's see, I think I read for M. Bison and oh, at least like three or four others, El

01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:34.160
Fuerte even.

01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:40.080
And I thought, okay, I don't know which one I felt the strongest about.

01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:46.120
But yes, I go in, do the best I can, as you do with any audition, hope for the best.

01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:51.000
A couple months go by, and then the director of the project, Taliesin Jaffe, he also voices

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Blanca.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:56.280
He tells me at a con secretly, so I think, congrats, man, I go, on what?

01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:58.880
He's like, you got to read it.

01:39:58.880 --> 01:39:59.880
I'm like, what?

01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:00.880
Really?

01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:01.880
He's like, oh, they didn't tell you?

01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:02.880
Like, no.

01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:06.000
I'm like, we can't talk about it.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:10.600
You sign these non-disclosure agreements saying, you know, you're under a gag order until the

01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:11.600
game comes out.

01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:13.120
Oh, I understand completely.

01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:18.680
And in this case, and is the case with many games, you know, nine months, a year, sometimes

01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:23.540
longer, Guild Wars was years worked on that for multiple years.

01:40:23.540 --> 01:40:30.200
But Street Fighter, yeah, unreal, because not only I'm a casual gamer, I'm a casual

01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:34.640
crappy gamer, button masher, I lost a lot of quarters on Street Fighter, but I also

01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:38.880
knew how important and iconic that series is, much less the character.

01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:39.880
Yes.

01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:45.720
So, yeah, my inner geek was definitely tingling.

01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:50.400
That is amazing, because I remember many of them throwing quarter after quarter after

01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:52.360
quarter playing Street Fighter in the arcade.

01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:53.360
Oh, okay.

01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:54.360
Yes.

01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:57.080
Yeah, and then the consoles happened, and then people stopped throwing quarters, because

01:40:57.080 --> 01:41:02.440
nowadays to play a quarter game in the 80s, you'd probably pay like a dollar nowadays

01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:03.440
or something.

01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:04.440
Yeah.

01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:05.440
It's nutty.

01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:09.960
But, you know, there are some reasons to come out, like there's some new Star Wars game

01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:13.720
that's only in arcades that looks amazing.

01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:18.180
They got to give you a reason to come out of your cave once in a while, I suppose.

01:41:18.180 --> 01:41:23.640
But I mean, the Street Fighter thing, even cooler, was getting to, because I had that

01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:27.200
connection to that, and then Disney made Wreck-It Ralph, and said, we're going to have

01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:33.160
cameos for Street Fighter characters and Sonic and all that, and they reached out and they

01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:37.080
knew the fans would want the original voices.

01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:38.080
Good on them.

01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:39.080
Thank you, Disney.

01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:40.440
Thank you, Rich Moore, the director.

01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:47.720
Thank you, everybody working on that, for thinking ahead and thinking to the fans.

01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:53.000
That is a love story, a love letter to the fans of the whole gaming generation.

01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:57.520
Yeah, I remember when me and my co-owner, we went to go see Wreck-It Ralph.

01:41:57.520 --> 01:41:59.280
We were just waiting just to hear your voice.

01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:04.880
We were just screaming in the fears, because like, we know who that is, that is awesome.

01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:07.600
We stayed for the credits just to see your name go up in the credits.

01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:08.600
That's so cool.

01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:09.600
Thank you.

01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:17.120
Yeah, I went with Steve Blum and some other staffers at Anime Nebraska on opening night,

01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:18.120
and oh, man, I teared up.

01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:19.120
It was so sweet.

01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:20.120
It was like, oh, yeah.

01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:22.120
They're like, woohoo.

01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:23.240
Awesome.

01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:27.360
And that was neat, to not only see my name on the credits under additional voices, that's

01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:28.360
what I expected.

01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:31.520
I didn't think it would say redo Kylie, they're like, what?

01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:37.920
You know, Ken, Ruben Langdon, all the characters got their name in the credits, you know?

01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:41.880
And I know a lot of people get up and leave during the credits, but for years, especially

01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:46.320
after being in the industry, I like seeing who did the additional voices, you know?

01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:48.320
You know, celebs do the main ones.

01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:50.520
I like to say it's like, oh, I recognize that person.

01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:51.520
Oh, yeah.

01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:56.520
And then I'll sit there and cheer, a little inner giggle and clap and all that stuff.

01:42:56.520 --> 01:42:58.880
So, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

01:42:58.880 --> 01:43:02.720
That's like my favorite achievement so far in 15 years in this industry is getting to

01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:05.320
do Ryu on a Disney movie.

01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:06.320
Nice.

01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:07.320
That is impressive.

01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:08.320
So, again, congratulations.

01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:09.320
Thank you.

01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:10.320
Thank you.

01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:14.320
So, besides fighting games, what other type of games do you like to play when you have

01:43:14.320 --> 01:43:16.320
the few minutes to relax?

01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:18.320
Oh, man, a few minutes.

01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:19.320
What?

01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:20.320
What?

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:22.320
I'm so ADD to begin with, too, you know?

01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:25.320
It's just, I put in all sorts of things.

01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:29.320
The latest thing I have that I want to dedicate more time to is Arkham Knight.

01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:33.320
Not only is it a beautiful game, but it's a ton of fun to play.

01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:36.320
All the Arkham games are, you know?

01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:40.320
Fighting games, I still fire up Street Fighter, to be honest.

01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:41.320
There you go.

01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:42.320
It's Soul Calibur.

01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:44.320
It's actually my favorite brawler.

01:43:44.320 --> 01:43:45.320
I love first-person shooters.

01:43:45.320 --> 01:43:46.320
Again, I suck at them.

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:50.320
I'll be the first one to die if you play co-op with me or whatever.

01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:52.320
But, yeah, Call of Duty, Halo.

01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:53.320
Can't wait for the new Halo.

01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:54.320
That's going to be fun.

01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:56.320
I'm not on it, by the way.

01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:57.320
I wish I was.

01:43:57.320 --> 01:43:59.320
Tried out for it.

01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:02.320
But my favorite shooter is actually Left 4 Dead 1 and 2.

01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:03.320
I love that.

01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:05.320
I love it, love it, love it, love it.

01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:07.320
And I love retro stuff, too.

01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:13.320
Going back to the Pac-Man, Galaga, Donkey Kong days, all that stuff.

01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:14.320
Oh, yeah.

01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:17.320
I love playing the old school.

01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:22.320
We were down on Jersey Shore about a few weeks ago and there's a retro cave there.

01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:23.320
I think it's like $5.

01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:26.320
You can play all these arcade machines for like a half hour.

01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:27.320
Oh, that's beautiful.

01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:30.320
And there's arcade themed bars across the country.

01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:33.320
You know, the cover charge and then you go in and it's unlimited play.

01:44:33.320 --> 01:44:38.320
So the people go in there and you see games from all different eras.

01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:41.320
And even like Duck Hunt at the bar and people are holding the thing.

01:44:41.320 --> 01:44:44.320
And like, get that dog.

01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:46.320
But everyone's not ordering drinks right away.

01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:49.320
They're playing games from their childhood.

01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:52.320
And now with Smash Brothers, you can actually go after the dog.

01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:53.320
There you go.

01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:54.320
I'll do that.

01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:56.320
So this is Smash.

01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:57.320
Yeah.

01:44:57.320 --> 01:44:58.320
Yeah, there you go.

01:44:58.320 --> 01:44:59.320
There you go.

01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:00.320
Exactly.

01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:08.320
What kind of advice can you tell aspiring voice actors and actors who want to get into the industry and do this for a living?

01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:10.320
Boy, I tell you.

01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:20.320
If you want to see it all summed up on a great website, D. Bradley Baker, who's done a ton of stuff on cartoons and games and stuff for years,

01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:28.320
has made a beautiful website for beginners and the curious called Iwanttobeavoiceactor.com.

01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:38.320
I'm endorsing it because I firmly believe that every bit of advice that he has on there, it's a wonderful blog to help give some insight to people that want to know.

01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:40.320
It's like, this looks like the coolest job in the world.

01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:42.320
And yes, it is the coolest job in the world.

01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:45.320
I can look like this and still voice buff young dudes.

01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:48.320
So hey, you know, you gotta love that.

01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:50.320
What are you talking about? You are a buff young dog.

01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:54.320
Yeah, I am a buff. Just close your eyes. Pretend.

01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:56.320
The answer lies in the heart of battle.

01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:59.320
Yeah, so advice, man.

01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:01.320
I crossed into it from radio.

01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:03.320
But radio's a different beast now.

01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:07.320
It was tough to get into radio then, 15, 20 years ago.

01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:10.320
Now the internet has changed the way we consume media.

01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:14.320
So, you know, user-generated content and all that stuff.

01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:18.320
But definitely practice. Start getting used to your voice.

01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:21.320
Record it. Read aloud. Ten minutes a day.

01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:24.320
That's the free thing you should be doing every day anyway.

01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:27.320
Overcome shyness.

01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:35.320
You know, understand that it is a business, so you gotta kind of learn a business angle to it.

01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:38.320
Because you gotta network and you gotta market yourself.

01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:41.320
And you have to train. You know, you have to hone your skills.

01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:46.320
Doctors don't just want to be a doctor and suddenly they're carving into your heart and saving your life.

01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:50.320
They have to go to school and learn their craft.

01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:52.320
Same thing with acting.

01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:55.320
If you want to be on the top of your game, absolutely.

01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:58.320
Take acting classes. Not just voiceover classes.

01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:02.320
Sometimes, depending on where you are, there are no voice acting classes.

01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:05.320
So don't throw up your arms and just say, oh, I give up.

01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:08.320
No. Take advantage of any sort of acting class.

01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:12.320
Or ability. Or opportunity, rather.

01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:15.320
You know, theater. Student film.

01:47:15.320 --> 01:47:18.320
But I want to do voiceover. I want to be on camera.

01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:21.320
You never know. Take the journey. Be open-minded.

01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:26.320
Because you might discover along the way that you have an affinity for something else.

01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:31.320
Like directing or something technical behind the scenes. Audio production or whatnot.

01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:35.320
But nowadays you kind of have to be a jack-of-all-trades. Especially because of the internet.

01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:38.320
Voice actors have to know to record themselves at home.

01:47:38.320 --> 01:47:43.320
So you've got to learn some basic stuff. Editing and production skills and all that.

01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:47.320
Learn some techniques and soundproofing.

01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:49.320
Be able to record in your closet.

01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:52.320
Clothing. You don't have to spend a fortune.

01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:55.320
Clothing and boxes are great insulators for sound.

01:47:55.320 --> 01:48:01.320
So if you record in your closet or have a little corner of your apartment or home that's quiet.

01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:09.320
And doesn't have your voice reverberating off the sides of the walls, then that's something to consider as well.

01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:15.320
Ultimately, depending on your goals in voiceover, the most money you can make is commercials.

01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:18.320
That's the most lucrative. Especially a national ad campaign.

01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:21.320
You could stand to make residuals from that.

01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:31.320
I think Carlos Lazroqui, who was the voice of Okiyara Taco Bell years ago, he bought a house with those words.

01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:33.320
Think about that. That's incredible.

01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:36.320
There's no residuals in games and animation and certainly not anime.

01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:43.320
Anime pays. Games are on fire right now.

01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:45.320
And in animation too.

01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:52.320
But in LA, Los Angeles is the hub for the most variety and the most different companies doing that sort of thing.

01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:56.320
But commercial work, radio TV commercials, any major hub.

01:48:56.320 --> 01:48:59.320
We're close to Boston pretty much here.

01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:11.320
So Boston is a great place to go to if you need to go and learn the craft of acting and get into some commercial stuff.

01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:14.320
Once you're trained, then this is the demo phase.

01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:17.320
Now, you can practice at home and record demos and all that.

01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:24.320
As it evolves, you can take different little excerpts and put them in different order and everything.

01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:32.320
But once you start training with the pros and accredited, actual legit VO coaches who have testimonials from students and all that stuff,

01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:39.320
they'll point you in the direction of demo producers who can give you the most bang for your buck.

01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:44.320
And it is expensive. A top notch LA quality demo will run you about 1500 bucks.

01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:47.320
It's a tax write off because we're freelance.

01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:53.320
Anything having to do with equipment purchases, the classes you take, all that's a tax deduction.

01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:55.320
So Uncle Sam treats you back.

01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:58.320
So think of it that way. It's an investment in your craft.

01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:02.320
So train. After you train and get experience, demo.

01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:05.320
After your demo, market it to casting people.

01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:07.320
How do you know where to send it?

01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:09.320
Look it up online. Google is your friend.

01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:11.320
Talk and network with other actors.

01:50:11.320 --> 01:50:14.320
Use the internet to your advantage.

01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:17.320
Join forums and discussion boards, Facebook groups.

01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:26.320
Tons of them are out there featuring tons of voice talent from all over the world who can help you with their own experiences and ideas.

01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:28.320
But everyone's path is unique.

01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:33.320
You can take all the classes in the world, be super talented and still not book a gig.

01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:38.320
But you have to have a thick skin. You have to have passion and determination.

01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:41.320
And you've got to do it for the love.

01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:43.320
Yeah, you want to make a living doing it.

01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:47.320
And that's the end goal. But you're not going to be able to do it overnight.

01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:51.320
The people that do just walk into an audition and suddenly their career is on fire, that's so rare.

01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:53.320
So don't have that to do.

01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:59.320
Just say to yourself, I see myself doing this. I want to do it so bad that I can't imagine doing anything else.

01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:04.320
You take all the rejections from the auditions like it's nothing.

01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:07.320
It just floats off your arms and you're like, whatever.

01:51:07.320 --> 01:51:09.320
Give me the next one. I'm good to go.

01:51:09.320 --> 01:51:17.320
And then, hopefully, after all that, after years of that mental torture and oh my god, I can't believe I'm doing this.

01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:20.320
And your parents and your family and friends going, why don't you get a real job?

01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:25.320
Then maybe, maybe, just maybe, you'll make a little progress.

01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:29.320
Hey, that's motivation. I mean, thank you, man. I appreciate it.

01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:31.320
Yeah, absolutely. Sure thing.

01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:34.320
It's Kyle Aver, ladies and gentlemen. Definitely check him out.

01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:39.320
And Street Fighter. My favorite album is Naruto.

01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:42.320
Gurren Lagann and a few others. Definitely check it out.

01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:44.320
Rock and roll. Thanks a lot, guys.

01:51:44.320 --> 01:51:45.320
No problem.

01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:54.320
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:51:54.320 --> 01:52:00.320
And a big thanks to DJ Rama S from Anime Jam Session for that interview with Kyle Hebert,

01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:04.320
which, you know, given some great advice for aspiring voice actors there in that interview.

01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:08.320
And we love to kind of hear, you know, I know there's a lot of people that aspire to do that sort of stuff,

01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:10.320
so I always love hearing the experts giving some advice.

01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:14.320
So, a big thank you very much to DJ Rama S for that.

01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:19.320
You can hear Anime Jam Sessions Tuesday night live here at the Voice of Geeks Network.

01:52:19.320 --> 01:52:23.320
Check your local listings over at vognetwork.com for your time zone.

01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:29.320
We're going to get into some rapid fire news here, and then we're going to get into list lists coming up in a little bit,

01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:31.320
and I'll tell you what the topic is in just a moment.

01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:38.320
Flaco Jones and Shane stepped out for a minute. They ran to do a dessert run for us. Oink, oink.

01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:44.320
But we're going to get into some rapid fire news, and they should be back about the time we're going to get to list lists.

01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:47.320
So, let's get to rapid fire news with Loki.

01:52:47.320 --> 01:52:50.320
So, they're going to make some more pinball tables.

01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:56.320
What is this? For Zen Pinball or Pinball FX2.

01:52:56.320 --> 01:53:04.320
And with it now, of course, adding to all the different tables that I think we mentioned before in the Balls of Glory set

01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:07.320
with Family Guy, American Dad, and Bob's Burgers.

01:53:07.320 --> 01:53:09.320
Archer. They're going to have an Archer table.

01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:12.320
Oh, fuck, that's awesome. I love Archer.

01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:17.320
So, that would be pretty awesome. I'd have to definitely check that out.

01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:25.320
When is that expected out? Not sure yet, but I guess whenever that Balls of Glory set comes out, that would be pretty epic.

01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:27.320
So, I'll have to check it out.

01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:34.320
Rocket League is getting some DLC, I'm sure, to tie in with the anniversary of Back to the Future.

01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:40.320
Plus, the fact that they're going to have was a Back to the Future 2 date.

01:53:40.320 --> 01:53:43.320
And the fact that's actually when it's coming out.

01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:51.320
October 21st for $1.99, you'll be able to get a DeLorean for Rocket League.

01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:56.320
October 21st, the date that they travel to the future in and Back to the Future 2.

01:53:57.320 --> 01:54:03.320
The same day you can get Pepsi, what's it called? The Pepsi from the movie? Pepsi Perfect?

01:54:03.320 --> 01:54:05.320
I think it's Pepsi Perfect, yeah.

01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:08.320
I will have to try that. Where's that being sold?

01:54:08.320 --> 01:54:10.320
I think, like, online.

01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:12.320
Why don't you just be regular, crappy Pepsi?

01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:14.320
If you didn't already get it, I think you're shit out of line.

01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:17.320
Who cares? I don't. You know, whatever.

01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:23.320
And last but not least, yet another game getting microtransactions.

01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:31.320
They're getting microtransactions, I guess, and it's the only way you can unlock some certain cosmetic and stat-boosting items.

01:54:31.320 --> 01:54:44.320
With that, there's going to be a black market update for $19.99, which introduces, I guess, loot drop safes that can only be opened using an item purchased with real money.

01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:54.320
Whoa, hold on a second. So I have to purchase... do I have to purchase this update for $19.99 and then they want me to buy these safe keys?

01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:56.320
That's kind of what it sounds like.

01:54:56.320 --> 01:55:02.320
Why would I pay money for an update to buy...

01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:06.320
You're going to pay money for the right to buy more. It's like conventions.

01:55:06.320 --> 01:55:09.320
You're going to pay in a free fee to get in and then get all these vendors.

01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:13.320
At least the convention has panels for free, though, once you get in.

01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:16.320
Yeah, that's kind of lame, but all right.

01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:24.320
By the way, this is why I love doing the show live because there's always listeners here ready to correct us when we fuck up the facts or just are kind of clueless.

01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:29.320
Dark Tetsuya says it's a limited edition deal. This is the Pepsi for $20.15 a bottle.

01:55:29.320 --> 01:55:33.320
Sj100Matt says I'll get that Pepsi perfect and dump it out for the bottle.

01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:37.320
So I guess the black market update's free. The game's $20.

01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:41.320
Brad from Pod Culture says it is just real sugar Pepsi.

01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:44.320
So thank you for the listeners at live.vognetwork.com.

01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:47.320
All we need is throwback.

01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:51.320
All right. Moving on to some Nintendo news.

01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:56.320
Some big maintenance for Nintendo's birthday. Well, tomorrow is the day after their birthday, I suppose.

01:55:56.320 --> 01:56:05.320
But Monday, October 19th, from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Pacific time, Nintendo's online services will be down.

01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:09.320
And it's like everything. So you want to play a Wii U game online? Too bad.

01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:16.320
You can't even go shopping on the 3DS or the Wii U tomorrow. It is all going to be down, down, down.

01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:22.320
So, yep, you'll have to. I don't know why. I don't know if it's to patch some type of exploit or something.

01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:28.320
Actually, we have something coming up a little later that perhaps it is patching some type of exploit or what they're doing.

01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:35.320
Some pretty controversial news this week. Star Wars Battlefront announced their season pass.

01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:40.320
It is $50. $50 season pass for a $60 game.

01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:42.320
Fuck that.

01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:51.320
The season pass is going to be good for four expansions, a two-week early access to each piece of DLC, and a shoot-first emote.

01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:57.320
So, you know, because you're going to shoot first on picking up this season pack. I don't know.

01:56:57.320 --> 01:57:03.320
There's also what they call an ultimate edition of Battlefront. It's the deluxe edition with the season pass.

01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:10.320
$120. That is a savings of $0 because the deluxe edition is already $70.

01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:18.320
So, there you go. If you are really into Star Wars Battlefront, have fun with that season pass.

01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:26.320
I don't know. A lot of what I'm hearing about Battlefront is that it's just, or I'm sorry, what I'm hearing about Star Wars Battlefront is that it's just Battlefield with a Star Wars skin.

01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:31.320
But I'm like, isn't that what people wanted? Because, I don't know, it still looks kind of awesome.

01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:39.320
I don't know if I'd play a lot of it and I certainly wouldn't spend $50 on the season pass and I don't even really know all what I'm getting, but I don't know.

01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:42.320
I thought that's what people wanted.

01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:48.320
I think, I don't know. I mean, I wish there was like a single-player campaign instead of just the survival modes.

01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:52.320
Yeah, that part kind of sucks. I will go with you on that.

01:57:53.320 --> 01:58:00.320
Let's see. Also, Square Enix considering doing some localization via crowdfunding.

01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:06.320
That's right. This is a comment from Square Enix Europe CEO Phil Rogers in an interview with Game Informer.

01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:10.320
Localization is a topic that comes up a lot and we understand why it does.

01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:17.320
To a great extent, in a really positive way, we're absolutely humbled that we have this loyal and dedicated fan base that wants to give us the feedback.

01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:21.320
We're constantly working with the teams in Tokyo to show them this and work with them there.

01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:29.320
The simple truth is that in some ways, the development process and the tools, it's not always an easy undertaking to reopen a game and add localization subsequently.

01:58:29.320 --> 01:58:36.320
But I think as we go forward with the way the group is working technically and the way it's now thinking globally, I'm really hoping that in the next 10 years,

01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:43.320
localization is seen as pleasing all our fans because it's truly global and the methods in which we can localize now are vastly improved.

01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:48.320
I think this is why you're seeing more of their games come out worldwide and you don't have that big gap.

01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:55.320
Final Fantasy games used to come out years in advance over there, which is why we missed a bunch in the early days during the Super Nintendo days.

01:58:55.320 --> 01:58:59.320
By the way, he went on to talk about the crowdfunding specifically.

01:58:59.320 --> 01:59:05.320
I would love to try and work with that crowdfunding to find a way because ultimately we want to satisfy the demands of the fans.

01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:09.320
I think also our fans are very rational. They understand and if we explain things, they often go,

01:59:10.320 --> 01:59:17.320
Oh, I get that now. Thanks for explaining. They know it's complex or it's very expensive and it's not as simply, as you say, as using Google Translate.

01:59:17.320 --> 01:59:22.320
You would not want to localize something through Google Translate. That wouldn't work.

01:59:22.320 --> 01:59:29.320
I understand you sometimes have to actually go in and change the size.

01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:35.320
I know that's what made translating a lot of the Super Nintendo games a bitch because they actually had to change the size of the cartridge

01:59:35.320 --> 01:59:39.320
because English text is a different size than Japanese text.

01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:46.320
Anyway, I won't get into all the this's and that's of that. I will move on to Jamie with her rapid fire news.

01:59:46.320 --> 01:59:49.320
I have some news about Super Mario Maker.

01:59:49.320 --> 01:59:54.320
They are doing some different costumes that have been out in Japan already.

01:59:54.320 --> 02:00:01.320
One was Famitsu's Neki, the cat mascot. Another one is Game Center CX's Arino.

02:00:02.320 --> 02:00:12.320
And so now there is going to be one based off of Yukio Sawada's manga called Super Mario-kun with big butt and big eyes.

02:00:12.320 --> 02:00:17.320
It's supposed to be coming out November 6th and I kind of hope we get it here.

02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:25.320
So moving on, they are doing Splatoon All-Star Collection plushies and they are available to pre-order now.

02:00:25.320 --> 02:00:34.320
You can order them via Playasia in the US or I guess no matter where you are in the world, really, you can order them from Playasia.

02:00:34.320 --> 02:00:37.320
They are supposed to be released on December 25th.

02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:44.320
And then, last but not least, there is going to be a new Dead or Alive Xtreme this spring.

02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:52.320
There will be Dead or Alive Xtreme 3 Fortune for PS4 and Dead or Alive Xtreme 3 Venus for Vita.

02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:56.320
It's supposed to be on March 25th.

02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:11.320
Fortune will be 95.04 yen and the collector's edition will be 149.04 and relatively a little bit cheaper for Vita.

02:01:11.320 --> 02:01:21.320
The character roster is supposed to be Marie Rose, Ohonaka, Kasumi, Ayane, Kokoro, Niotengu, Hitomi, Momiji, and Helena.

02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:25.320
So, there you go. Volleyball and boobs.

02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:28.320
I'm sure you're very much looking forward to this, right, DarkSakura?

02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:32.320
I just want Dan to get it so I can laugh about him playing dress-up.

02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:35.320
It's Barbie for boys, right? That's just all it is.

02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:37.320
Yeah, it's funny actually.

02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:43.320
Alright, well, this is about the point in the show where we get to the foogle question of the week.

02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:48.320
But I actually want to talk quickly about tonight's list list, which I hope...

02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:53.320
There must have been a line where Shane and Flaco went. They're not back yet.

02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:55.320
They went to Dunkin Donuts where I had to wait for 30 minutes.

02:01:55.320 --> 02:01:57.320
Was the line really that bad over there?

02:01:57.320 --> 02:02:01.320
Yeah, they finally opened at Dunkin here in NorCal and you know I want my coffee.

02:02:01.320 --> 02:02:05.320
I can't handle the line that's over there right now. It's crazy.

02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:07.320
So, you went there last night though, right?

02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:11.320
Yeah, we were there for about 30 minutes and I got my favorite donut that they carry.

02:02:11.320 --> 02:02:12.320
What was that?

02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:15.320
It was the powdered donut with the chocolate cream.

02:02:15.320 --> 02:02:17.320
Was the line going out the door like it was?

02:02:17.320 --> 02:02:19.320
No, it was going into the bathroom.

02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:22.320
We had people in the men's bathroom with the door open.

02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:24.320
That's strange.

02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:26.320
But they also had the pumpkin donuts. Those were pretty good.

02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:28.320
The pumpkin spice ones.

02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:30.320
And they were like regular cost.

02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:32.320
And the chocolate cakes.

02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:34.320
We're giving them free advertising right now.

02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:36.320
Who the fuck cares? I love it.

02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:38.320
It's the new thing here.

02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:40.320
I bought two bags of coffee as well.

02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:45.320
So, Dan was like, well, they have one in Roseville. I guess we'll get one in Elk Grove next because we have to do everything that Roseville does.

02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:47.320
Probably.

02:02:47.320 --> 02:02:51.320
Anyway, tonight's list list, just so you guys can start thinking about the topic.

02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:59.320
We are going to do for tonight's list list, in celebration of the Nintendo Entertainment System's 30th anniversary, we're going to do a Nest Center topic.

02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:03.320
We were going to do best Nintendo game ever, but we all know the Guardian Legend would win.

02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:05.320
So, that's pretty much a moot point.

02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:09.320
We're going to do the worst Nintendo game they ever made.

02:03:09.320 --> 02:03:11.320
Is tonight's list list.

02:03:11.320 --> 02:03:13.320
So, stay tuned for that. We will get to that shortly.

02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:16.320
But first, the foogle question of the week.

02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:26.320
Every week we visit our Facebook and our Google Plus communities.

02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:30.320
And you take Facebook and Google and you slam those together and you get what everybody?

02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:32.320
Foogle!

02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:34.320
So, let's get to it.

02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:38.320
This week's question, very similar to what we opened the show with tonight.

02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:42.320
We asked our listeners about the 30th anniversary of the Nintendo Entertainment System.

02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:47.320
And, you know, if they have a particular game that they have fond memories of from the NES days.

02:03:47.320 --> 02:03:51.320
What is their one favorite NES game?

02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:53.320
So, let's get to Google Plus first.

02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:58.320
And Retertainment starts us off tonight simply saying Tetris.

02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:01.320
That was an amazing NES game.

02:04:01.320 --> 02:04:07.320
And the music still to this day gets stuck in your head and makes you think of falling bricks.

02:04:07.320 --> 02:04:10.320
ActDeft over on Google Plus says there are so many to choose.

02:04:10.320 --> 02:04:14.320
But if I only have to pick one, it would probably be Kirby's Adventure.

02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:16.320
My first Kirby experience.

02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:18.320
I'm not surprised at all to hear ActDeft picking that one.

02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:20.320
But you know what's interesting about that?

02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:22.320
That was kind of a later Nintendo release.

02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:24.320
Kirby's release was really, it wasn't the last.

02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:26.320
I know Warriors Woods was the last one.

02:04:26.320 --> 02:04:29.320
Or that or StarTropics 2. One of those was the last one.

02:04:29.320 --> 02:04:36.320
But that Kirby was kind of a later release for the NES.

02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:39.320
Let's go over to Facebook where Stephen D. replies and says,

02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:43.320
Zelda, I remember my friend slept over to pull an all-night Zelda-thon

02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:46.320
only to find my brother took the nest to his friend's house.

02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:48.320
We stared at the map that night.

02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:53.320
I also recall being in tears because a dark nut wouldn't die.

02:04:53.320 --> 02:04:56.320
That's right. Some of those things you had to know exactly how to kill them.

02:04:56.320 --> 02:04:58.320
And otherwise you couldn't do it.

02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:03.320
Renji221 responded and said, I think I would have to say Super Mario 3.

02:05:03.320 --> 02:05:07.320
While I don't think it's the best in the series, that would be Mario World.

02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:10.320
I do think it had really good levels and a nice set of power-ups.

02:05:10.320 --> 02:05:13.320
I think for a lot of people those two games are neck and neck.

02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:19.320
Fifth Dream says, it's so hard to pick, but I choose Kid Nicky, Radical Ninja.

02:05:19.320 --> 02:05:21.320
It wasn't the best game and the graphics weren't great.

02:05:21.320 --> 02:05:24.320
But I played it a lot despite dying constantly.

02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:30.320
And the background soundtrack is the most awesome, annoying, repetitive, catchy, and memorable music ever.

02:05:30.320 --> 02:05:33.320
The bosses were pretty silly and really fun to fight.

02:05:33.320 --> 02:05:36.320
I had so much fun playing this and remember it fondly to this day.

02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:39.320
I actually posted a little YouTube there of Kid Nicky. I remember that game.

02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:43.320
Degenerate Johnny said, Metroid.

02:05:43.320 --> 02:05:46.320
Not only was it the NES title I had the most fun playing,

02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:52.320
but the idea of me playing a badass female character helped me get over the cootie phase of my life.

02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:54.320
That's a good way of putting it.

02:05:54.320 --> 02:05:58.320
That was so important what they did there with that game.

02:05:58.320 --> 02:06:00.320
That whole twist ending.

02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:03.320
That was very, very big in gaming.

02:06:03.320 --> 02:06:07.320
Except Guardian Legend went all that from the very get-go of the game.

02:06:07.320 --> 02:06:09.320
That is true, but it did come a few years after.

02:06:09.320 --> 02:06:11.320
A little bit, yeah. But still.

02:06:11.320 --> 02:06:12.320
That's true.

02:06:13.320 --> 02:06:16.320
Cell Agent Why Not replies and says,

02:06:16.320 --> 02:06:20.320
Has to be Metal Gear, hands down, then Super Mario Bros.

02:06:20.320 --> 02:06:27.320
You know, some people, like purists, consider Metal Gear to be trash on the NES

02:06:27.320 --> 02:06:30.320
because it's so different from the MSX version.

02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:34.320
But I also understand, I'm actually not one of those people

02:06:34.320 --> 02:06:38.320
because so many of us got introduced from that version

02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:41.320
which to then hear it's a sub-par version is like,

02:06:41.320 --> 02:06:43.320
my God, this game is amazing.

02:06:43.320 --> 02:06:45.320
So, anyway, there you go.

02:06:45.320 --> 02:06:47.320
SHO 100 Matt says,

02:06:47.320 --> 02:06:49.320
It's so hard to pick one game.

02:06:49.320 --> 02:06:51.320
While you might think I would say Blades of Steel,

02:06:51.320 --> 02:06:53.320
I'm going to go with Super Mario Bros. 3.

02:06:53.320 --> 02:06:56.320
The game had so much depth and challenge behind it

02:06:56.320 --> 02:06:58.320
that you could beat it a dozen or so different ways.

02:06:58.320 --> 02:07:01.320
Not only that, it was featured in one of the big movies from my childhood,

02:07:01.320 --> 02:07:03.320
The Wizard.

02:07:03.320 --> 02:07:05.320
It's so bad.

02:07:05.320 --> 02:07:07.320
Joe G. replied and said,

02:07:07.320 --> 02:07:10.320
Super Mario 3 because it was the first game I ever finished.

02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:12.320
Well, that's important.

02:07:12.320 --> 02:07:14.320
Mako Chan says,

02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:17.320
Mickey Mouse Capade was my favorite and my first game

02:07:17.320 --> 02:07:20.320
besides the one bundled with my system, Mario Bros. and Hogan's Alley.

02:07:20.320 --> 02:07:24.320
My love for it is completely nostalgic as the game itself was annoying

02:07:24.320 --> 02:07:27.320
and many pissed me off half the time,

02:07:27.320 --> 02:07:30.320
but I had so much fun playing it when I was little.

02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:32.320
Silent Tom says,

02:07:32.320 --> 02:07:34.320
The Legend of Zelda, it's the game that has become a part of my life

02:07:34.320 --> 02:07:37.320
and the music is something I always hear in my mind.

02:07:37.320 --> 02:07:39.320
Dark Tetsuya says,

02:07:39.320 --> 02:07:41.320
I'm sure I've told the story about a hundred times,

02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:43.320
so I'll spare you guys and just say The Legend of Zelda.

02:07:43.320 --> 02:07:45.320
Obviously, it was a very special game

02:07:45.320 --> 02:07:48.320
having shipped on a glistening gold game pack,

02:07:48.320 --> 02:07:50.320
which it was.

02:07:50.320 --> 02:07:52.320
I saw a gold game pack today and I got so excited,

02:07:52.320 --> 02:07:54.320
but it wasn't Zelda.

02:07:54.320 --> 02:07:56.320
It was some other NES game they'd released.

02:07:56.320 --> 02:07:58.320
By the way, Flocko and Chain are back in studio and brought food.

02:07:58.320 --> 02:08:00.320
Thank you.

02:08:00.320 --> 02:08:02.320
Dairy Queen!

02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:04.320
Is this really a pumpkin blizzard?

02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:06.320
I'm so excited.

02:08:06.320 --> 02:08:08.320
It's pumpkin pie.

02:08:08.320 --> 02:08:10.320
It's not baby poop, Chain.

02:08:10.320 --> 02:08:12.320
Baby poop blizzard.

02:08:12.320 --> 02:08:14.320
It looks like it.

02:08:14.320 --> 02:08:16.320
Lastly, Master Claw says,

02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:18.320
I know almost everyone has already said this,

02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:20.320
but Super Mario Bros. 3,

02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:22.320
I remember seeing it in trailers for the wizard

02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:24.320
and in the movie itself and knowing I have to have it.

02:08:24.320 --> 02:08:26.320
I remember my parents bringing me to electronics boutique

02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:28.320
and buying it for me

02:08:28.320 --> 02:08:30.320
and many, many years of playing it on my NES.

02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:34.320
It's still one of my three favorite games.

02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:36.320
There it is.

02:08:36.320 --> 02:08:38.320
We're going to do a few more stories here

02:08:38.320 --> 02:08:40.320
and then we're going to get to tonight's list list.

02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:42.320
Worst Nintendo game ever.

02:08:42.320 --> 02:08:44.320
It was a fukou question.

02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:46.320
We didn't get to answer.

02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:48.320
It was the same thing we did at the beginning of the show.

02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:50.320
Yes, you did get to answer.

02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:52.320
You changed your answer?

02:08:52.320 --> 02:08:54.320
I picked two, which wasn't following the rules.

02:08:54.320 --> 02:08:56.320
Now you're going to really not follow it.

02:08:56.320 --> 02:08:58.320
I'm going to delete those two and pick just one

02:08:58.320 --> 02:09:00.320
because I don't know why I didn't say it

02:09:00.320 --> 02:09:02.320
and I didn't hear what the other people said.

02:09:02.320 --> 02:09:04.320
Hopefully someone else called out too because it's amazing.

02:09:04.320 --> 02:09:06.320
Did anybody say Contra?

02:09:06.320 --> 02:09:08.320
I love Contra.

02:09:08.320 --> 02:09:10.320
I played it so much.

02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:12.320
I was able to beat that game with co-op

02:09:12.320 --> 02:09:14.320
in under 20 minutes.

02:09:14.320 --> 02:09:16.320
It was so much fun.

02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:18.320
I started recording my runs on VCR

02:09:18.320 --> 02:09:20.320
just to see, this is what I do.

02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:22.320
Contra is pretty hard.

02:09:22.320 --> 02:09:24.320
I know, but I got so good at it.

02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:26.320
I think that's why I liked it so much.

02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:28.320
Oh, that game is impossible.

02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:30.320
Hello, employer. This is my resume.

02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:32.320
Did you ever see the differences with the Japanese version?

02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:34.320
I had extra animations that weren't in the US release.

02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:36.320
I had no idea.

02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:38.320
Yeah, there's comparisons online. They're pretty cool.

02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:40.320
I love watching the speedruns of it,

02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:42.320
but those guys kill their fingers.

02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:44.320
They just mash, mash, mash, mash to get that.

02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:46.320
You got to get that spread gun at a certain rate

02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:48.320
where it actually shoots straight

02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:50.320
but shoots so much at once

02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:52.320
because something about the number of frames

02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:54.320
that could be on screen, I don't know.

02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:56.320
It was way over my head.

02:09:56.320 --> 02:09:58.320
I didn't even do that stuff.

02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:00.320
They could beat the game in 8 minutes or 10 minutes.

02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:03.320
I don't know about right now,

02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:05.320
but I think I tried to play it

02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:07.320
on an emulator a few years ago,

02:10:07.320 --> 02:10:09.320
and I was still pretty good at it,

02:10:09.320 --> 02:10:11.320
but definitely not like I used to.

02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:13.320
I could still beat it in 20 minutes,

02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:15.320
but not without the Konami code.

02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:17.320
I'd challenge you to come to my house,

02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:19.320
sit down with my NES in the cartridge,

02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:21.320
and run through it.

02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:23.320
Oh my gosh, I would love to try it again,

02:10:23.320 --> 02:10:25.320
especially with a real controller.

02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:27.320
I would borrow somebody's box to stream that.

02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:29.320
I would have to practice for streaming that.

02:10:30.320 --> 02:10:32.320
I would get together with my friend Ken,

02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:34.320
and we would just play that every weekend.

02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:36.320
We were good at the co-op mode, too.

02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:38.320
Even though you had to time things,

02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:40.320
especially on the waterfall level,

02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:42.320
where you're both in sync,

02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:44.320
otherwise you kill each other.

02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:46.320
We still used the Konami code on that,

02:10:46.320 --> 02:10:48.320
but for single player, I would not use the Konami code.

02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:50.320
That was one of the first experiences

02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:52.320
of the dick your friends type of thing

02:10:52.320 --> 02:10:54.320
where you could kill people on purpose.

02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:56.320
That always goes over popular.

02:10:56.320 --> 02:10:58.320
For me, it was one of the first games

02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:00.320
for me. I didn't play a lot of games with friends.

02:11:00.320 --> 02:11:02.320
I didn't have a ton of friends,

02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:04.320
but that one was like,

02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:06.320
oh yeah, let's play this every weekend.

02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:08.320
So much fun.

02:11:08.320 --> 02:11:10.320
You know the biggest dick your friends game was, Battle Toads.

02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:12.320
That's a pretty big one, too.

02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:14.320
Anyhow, let's get back into some news here.

02:11:14.320 --> 02:11:16.320
Loki.

02:11:16.320 --> 02:11:18.320
Apparently the launch for Metal Gear Online

02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:20.320
was a little bit...

02:11:20.320 --> 02:11:22.320
not great.

02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:24.320
Most online games are like that,

02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:26.320
but Konami is saying sorry

02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:30.320
by giving everybody 3000 GP,

02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:33.320
and then they're also extending the XP boost period

02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:35.320
to three weeks instead of two.

02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:38.320
And I wonder if you can use that...

02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:40.320
if you're supposed to use that GP for the insurance

02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:42.320
that they announced the other week, right?

02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:44.320
They have to pay for real money for...

02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:46.320
That's what I was just about to say,

02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:48.320
so I can get the free insurance to block other players

02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:50.320
from taking my shit.

02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:52.320
Which I still don't...

02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:54.320
Yeah.

02:11:55.320 --> 02:11:57.320
Konami saying sorry?

02:11:57.320 --> 02:11:59.320
Are they apologizing with Silent Hills?

02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:06.320
See, that would have been the clickbait headline.

02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:08.320
If VOG Network had a bunch of clickbait headlines,

02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:10.320
that would have been it.

02:12:10.320 --> 02:12:13.320
You won't believe what Konami just apologized for.

02:12:13.320 --> 02:12:15.320
Click here to find out.

02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:17.320
And then it would be a picture of Silent Hill,

02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:19.320
but then when you click in the article,

02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:21.320
it would just say like,

02:12:21.320 --> 02:12:23.320
Konami has pissed a lot of people off over Silent Hill,

02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:24.320
and then the picture under it would be,

02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:26.320
but they talked about Metal Gear this week.

02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:27.320
God.

02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:28.320
All right.

02:12:28.320 --> 02:12:30.320
Well, earlier I talked about some Nintendo data mining,

02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:32.320
and this could be the reason

02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:34.320
that there's some emergency maintenance going on,

02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:35.320
or the likely not.

02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:38.320
But some information was data mined from the Wii U eShop

02:12:38.320 --> 02:12:41.320
about potential coming out games later,

02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:43.320
like games that are on their way out.

02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:46.320
For example, Contra Advance on the Game Boy Advance

02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:48.320
was spotted for Wii U Virtual Console.

02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:51.320
F-Zero Climax on the Game Boy Advance.

02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:53.320
A bunch of Kirby games.

02:12:53.320 --> 02:12:54.320
That should make it.

02:12:54.320 --> 02:12:56.320
Kirby Canvas Curse and Kirby Mass Attack.

02:12:56.320 --> 02:12:58.320
A lot of Zelda games.

02:12:58.320 --> 02:13:01.320
Mega Man additional games.

02:13:01.320 --> 02:13:03.320
Pokemon Mystery Dungeon.

02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:05.320
Pokemon Ranger, Sonic Advance 2 and 3.

02:13:05.320 --> 02:13:07.320
I mean, there's more games than I can really name here.

02:13:07.320 --> 02:13:10.320
But what's also interesting, Wii games on the Wii U.

02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:13.320
Kiki Trick, Kirby's Epic Yarn,

02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:15.320
Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword.

02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:16.320
That would be something to see that.

02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:18.320
That was a later game release.

02:13:18.320 --> 02:13:21.320
Metroid Other M, New Super Mario Brothers Wii,

02:13:21.320 --> 02:13:24.320
Super Paper Mario, Wario Land Shake It Up,

02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:25.320
Xenoblade Chronicles.

02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:27.320
That could be interesting.

02:13:27.320 --> 02:13:30.320
And then Wii U games, apparently spotted,

02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:35.320
included The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess HD.

02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:37.320
And that made a lot of people go,

02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:38.320
huh?

02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:40.320
But apparently, yeah,

02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:42.320
The Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess HD

02:13:42.320 --> 02:13:45.320
was spotted on the Nintendo Update server.

02:13:45.320 --> 02:13:47.320
And so now a lot of people are going,

02:13:47.320 --> 02:13:50.320
is this something that maybe Nintendo is going to be releasing

02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:53.320
to build up hype for the new Zelda game

02:13:53.320 --> 02:13:54.320
or to hold this over?

02:13:54.320 --> 02:13:56.320
Because they'll probably get delayed again.

02:13:56.320 --> 02:13:57.320
I want it.

02:13:57.320 --> 02:13:58.320
I want it bad.

02:13:58.320 --> 02:14:01.320
And I saw a lot of people saying how upset they were

02:14:01.320 --> 02:14:03.320
that that was a game that would be getting HD

02:14:03.320 --> 02:14:04.320
because they all hate it.

02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:05.320
And I don't understand why.

02:14:05.320 --> 02:14:07.320
I thought it was a really good game.

02:14:07.320 --> 02:14:08.320
I thought Twilight Princess was great.

02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:09.320
It was good enough to name my cat after it.

02:14:09.320 --> 02:14:11.320
Yeah, I thought Twilight Princess was great.

02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:16.320
It's my second favorite 3D Zelda game, probably.

02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:17.320
All right.

02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:19.320
Maybe first.

02:14:19.320 --> 02:14:20.320
All right.

02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:21.320
Dark Soccer's got one more story for us

02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:23.320
before we get into tonight's Listless.

02:14:23.320 --> 02:14:26.320
The third annual Day of the Devs is coming back

02:14:26.320 --> 02:14:32.320
on November 7th from 4 to 11th at the Midway in San Francisco.

02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:34.320
So basically it's a celebration of indie games

02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:37.320
and music that's being produced, sorry,

02:14:37.320 --> 02:14:40.320
sponsored by Double Fine and I Am 8-Bit.

02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:45.320
And this year is going to have game makers

02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:48.320
showing off directly to their fans

02:14:48.320 --> 02:14:54.320
who are interested in going hands-on along live music

02:14:54.320 --> 02:14:58.320
from, is it Doseon or Dose One, I guess?

02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:01.320
I don't know.

02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:03.320
But anyway, they're going to have games,

02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:08.320
some of them, Abzu, Adrift with a one in the middle,

02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:12.320
Bad Blood Below, Botolo, Burly Men at Sea,

02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:15.320
that sounds fun, Day of the Tentacle,

02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:21.320
Death's Gambit, Donut Country, Fantastic Contraption,

02:15:21.320 --> 02:15:25.320
Gang Beasts, Nog with a G, Hyper Light Drifter,

02:15:25.320 --> 02:15:28.320
Night in the Woods, Outer Wilds, Overland, Oxenfree,

02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:31.320
Pit People, Rising Thunder, Scale, Secret Legends,

02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:34.320
Sound Self, Spy Party, Spy Party sounds fun,

02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:37.320
Tacoma Thumper, Tilt Brush, Watch Ram,

02:15:37.320 --> 02:15:44.320
What Remains of Edith Finch, Witch Marsh, and many more.

02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:50.320
You can find out about it at dayofthedevs.com.

02:15:50.320 --> 02:15:53.320
Mwahahaha.

02:15:53.320 --> 02:15:56.320
I'm all for these type of events that, you know,

02:15:56.320 --> 02:15:59.320
bring more light on what these hardworking indie folks are doing.

02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:01.320
So why not?

02:16:01.320 --> 02:16:03.320
Alright, let's do this.

02:16:03.320 --> 02:16:05.320
We have not done this in quite some time,

02:16:05.320 --> 02:16:08.320
but we are going to get into a list list.

02:16:11.320 --> 02:16:13.320
Oh, it's been far too long since we've done this,

02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:18.320
so let me explain how this highly scientific process works.

02:16:18.320 --> 02:16:21.320
If you are listening live, unfortunately the podcast folks

02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:23.320
aren't able to participate in this because this is something

02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:25.320
that kind of plays out live.

02:16:25.320 --> 02:16:27.320
But if you want to play along with us,

02:16:27.320 --> 02:16:30.320
you can join our chatroom over at live.vognetworks.com

02:16:30.320 --> 02:16:33.320
As long as you're logged into the VOG Network site

02:16:33.320 --> 02:16:35.320
and you're actually in the chatroom,

02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:39.320
you can actually participate if you're on that live page.

02:16:39.320 --> 02:16:41.320
So we're going to put together a list,

02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:45.320
and it is going to be the definitive list in the scientific process.

02:16:45.320 --> 02:16:47.320
Everybody here in the studio will contribute to the list.

02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:50.320
We're going to name our top three answers

02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:52.320
with your help in the chatroom,

02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:54.320
because sometimes when answers get duplicated and so forth,

02:16:54.320 --> 02:16:57.320
we'll pull answers from the chatroom.

02:16:57.320 --> 02:16:59.320
And then we're going to go around.

02:16:59.320 --> 02:17:02.320
It's a very difficult, but it's a very important part of the process.

02:17:02.320 --> 02:17:07.320
We each go around and eliminate one item that does not deserve to be on the list.

02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:11.320
And then you guys will vote on your number one and your number two answer.

02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:19.320
And again, tonight, what was the worst NES game they ever made?

02:17:19.320 --> 02:17:21.320
So let's get into it.

02:17:21.320 --> 02:17:23.320
I'm going to put that up on the board here.

02:17:23.320 --> 02:17:25.320
I'm having to multitask a little bit here.

02:17:25.320 --> 02:17:28.320
But of course, playing tonight here in the studio, myself, Rob Roberts.

02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:32.320
Dark Sakura, Loki, and Flaco Jones, and Shana Linko.

02:17:32.320 --> 02:17:33.320
So we have five players tonight.

02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:35.320
This is a pretty heavy list.

02:17:35.320 --> 02:17:36.320
We don't usually have five.

02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:38.320
We usually have like three or four.

02:17:38.320 --> 02:17:44.320
So what was the worst NES game they ever made?

02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:45.320
All right, let's go to...

02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:48.320
Showgirls.

02:17:48.320 --> 02:17:50.320
Let's go first to...

02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:52.320
I'll say Dark Sakura is going to go first.

02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:53.320
Dark Sakura, ladies first.

02:17:53.320 --> 02:17:54.320
Me? I don't want to.

02:17:54.320 --> 02:17:55.320
Well, too bad.

02:17:55.320 --> 02:17:56.320
Somebody's got to go first.

02:17:56.320 --> 02:17:57.320
I will bite my butt.

02:17:57.320 --> 02:17:59.320
Dark Sakura, what are you going to put on the list?

02:17:59.320 --> 02:18:02.320
X-Men.

02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:03.320
X-Men.

02:18:03.320 --> 02:18:05.320
Why do you think the X-Men game on NES was terrible?

02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:06.320
The X-Men game was shit.

02:18:06.320 --> 02:18:08.320
It had poor collision detection.

02:18:08.320 --> 02:18:11.320
If you were playing a character that wasn't ranged,

02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:14.320
you'd just get overload so badly.

02:18:14.320 --> 02:18:17.320
Plus the whole thing was kind of an overhead view.

02:18:17.320 --> 02:18:19.320
It just really was not good.

02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:20.320
It was the shit.

02:18:20.320 --> 02:18:22.320
The shit as in literal shit.

02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:26.320
Like someone ate it and pooped out a game.

02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:28.320
Someone went to Marvel Comics,

02:18:28.320 --> 02:18:31.320
ate a whole bunch of issues of uncanny X-Men,

02:18:31.320 --> 02:18:35.320
and shat it in a Nintendo cartridge.

02:18:35.320 --> 02:18:38.320
No, tell me how you really feel.

02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:41.320
And I'm keeping my list just sticking with actual licensed stuff

02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:43.320
and not any of the unlicensed stuff.

02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:44.320
Fair enough, fair enough.

02:18:44.320 --> 02:18:46.320
All right, that's not a condition.

02:18:46.320 --> 02:18:48.320
Other people can do whatever they want with the list.

02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:52.320
In fact, we're going to see what Loki is going to put now up on the list.

02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:57.320
I kind of like this game, but it is still pretty bad.

02:18:57.320 --> 02:18:59.320
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

02:18:59.320 --> 02:19:01.320
Yeah, that was kind of bad.

02:19:01.320 --> 02:19:03.320
And because of the water levels.

02:19:03.320 --> 02:19:04.320
You stole one of my answers.

02:19:04.320 --> 02:19:05.320
Yes, that was bad.

02:19:05.320 --> 02:19:07.320
I did beat it though.

02:19:07.320 --> 02:19:10.320
That's an interesting sign that so many people here in the studio are like,

02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:13.320
yeah, dammit, I was going to pick that one as well.

02:19:13.320 --> 02:19:15.320
But not to be confused with the arcade game.

02:19:15.320 --> 02:19:17.320
No, no, not the arcade game.

02:19:17.320 --> 02:19:19.320
The ultra games Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,

02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:21.320
the one where you have four Ninja Turtles you get to play as,

02:19:21.320 --> 02:19:23.320
one one dies.

02:19:23.320 --> 02:19:25.320
Well, you're fucked unless you rest.

02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:28.320
I think you can rescue them too or something like that.

02:19:28.320 --> 02:19:30.320
I don't remember how that works.

02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:32.320
It's been a while, so I don't remember.

02:19:32.320 --> 02:19:34.320
Oh, you're starting fights in chat.

02:19:34.320 --> 02:19:37.320
Act Def says TMNT was hard, but it wasn't bad.

02:19:37.320 --> 02:19:39.320
And Alan Alchemy says, wow, rude.

02:19:39.320 --> 02:19:40.320
I beat it a few times.

02:19:40.320 --> 02:19:42.320
It was fucking hard, but I beat it.

02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:45.320
I beat it too, but I'm just saying, you know, it was, you know.

02:19:45.320 --> 02:19:46.320
All right.

02:19:46.320 --> 02:19:49.320
I'm going to go next and I'm going to apologize to Flaco Jones

02:19:49.320 --> 02:19:52.320
because I think it was something he was considering putting on the list.

02:19:52.320 --> 02:19:54.320
But here's the thing.

02:19:54.320 --> 02:19:56.320
I actually bought this.

02:19:56.320 --> 02:19:57.320
Well, I didn't buy it.

02:19:57.320 --> 02:19:58.320
I convinced my mom to buy it.

02:19:58.320 --> 02:20:02.320
And I was so pissed that this game was so fucking terrible.

02:20:02.320 --> 02:20:04.320
It really was one of the worst I ever played.

02:20:04.320 --> 02:20:09.320
And it's such an important series as well for gaming.

02:20:09.320 --> 02:20:14.320
I can't believe they fucked up Super Pitfall so fucking bad.

02:20:14.320 --> 02:20:16.320
Have you played it?

02:20:16.320 --> 02:20:17.320
It's god awful.

02:20:17.320 --> 02:20:21.320
They made Pitfall Harry into like this blue hard hat Hector.

02:20:21.320 --> 02:20:22.320
I don't know.

02:20:22.320 --> 02:20:23.320
I did play it though.

02:20:23.320 --> 02:20:27.320
And it's just like, yeah, it was awful, awful, awful, awful.

02:20:27.320 --> 02:20:31.320
I would rather play Pitfall 2 on the Atari 2600.

02:20:31.320 --> 02:20:32.320
All right.

02:20:32.320 --> 02:20:36.320
Flaco Jones up next with your number three answer.

02:20:36.320 --> 02:20:38.320
I decided not to pick that one and I'm glad I didn't.

02:20:38.320 --> 02:20:39.320
I'm glad you didn't either.

02:20:39.320 --> 02:20:44.320
I have Bible Adventures for the NES, which I don't know if a lot of people might have

02:20:44.320 --> 02:20:47.320
seen that back on, again, Games Done Quick.

02:20:47.320 --> 02:20:51.320
But I remember playing this one because I was a very active member of my youth group

02:20:51.320 --> 02:20:52.320
and all that stuff.

02:20:52.320 --> 02:20:58.320
So this was a game that was made just by a Christian video game company.

02:20:58.320 --> 02:21:00.320
And so there were like a few different ventures.

02:21:00.320 --> 02:21:03.320
It was like you played Noah's Ark, Baby Moses, or David and Goliath.

02:21:03.320 --> 02:21:07.320
I remember the Moses one because you run around with Baby Moses like over your head,

02:21:07.320 --> 02:21:10.320
like the way Mario carries a turnip in Mario 2.

02:21:10.320 --> 02:21:13.320
And I think you could even like throw him, which is ridiculous.

02:21:13.320 --> 02:21:16.320
I saw the pictures of like, what was it, I think Noah.

02:21:16.320 --> 02:21:18.320
He's carrying animals that way too.

02:21:18.320 --> 02:21:20.320
Yeah, and he carries like stacks of animals.

02:21:20.320 --> 02:21:21.320
It's so ridiculous.

02:21:21.320 --> 02:21:24.320
It's like, you know, it's, they want to make games to make the Bible cool for kids,

02:21:24.320 --> 02:21:26.320
but they are not necessarily the best at making games.

02:21:26.320 --> 02:21:28.320
But they've made a lot, I think.

02:21:28.320 --> 02:21:30.320
I remember them talking about this on Games Done Quick.

02:21:30.320 --> 02:21:33.320
They made a lot of games and this was like the NES one.

02:21:33.320 --> 02:21:36.320
So that's why I picked that one because I remember playing that as a kid

02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:39.320
and I'm like, this is weird.

02:21:39.320 --> 02:21:40.320
All right, good.

02:21:40.320 --> 02:21:41.320
I do hear that one come up a lot.

02:21:41.320 --> 02:21:42.320
I sure do.

02:21:42.320 --> 02:21:45.320
I do want to clarify in the chat, AkumaJP was asking,

02:21:45.320 --> 02:21:48.320
is it just Famicom, Super Nintendo, I mean, or all Nintendo consoles?

02:21:48.320 --> 02:21:52.320
Since we are celebrating the 30th anniversary of the NES in America tonight,

02:21:52.320 --> 02:21:54.320
we are keeping it to NES.

02:21:54.320 --> 02:21:57.320
I suppose if somebody wants to put a Famicom game on the list,

02:21:57.320 --> 02:22:00.320
it wouldn't be off limits, but I don't think anyone in here

02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:03.320
has especially fond memories of Famicom games.

02:22:03.320 --> 02:22:07.320
Maybe Jamie with the vault, but I have a feeling those games will avoid her list.

02:22:07.320 --> 02:22:08.320
But we'll see.

02:22:08.320 --> 02:22:13.320
Tigerclaw posted me a link to a game called That Damn Level,

02:22:13.320 --> 02:22:15.320
which is, it's a...

02:22:15.320 --> 02:22:16.320
Oh, Mario Maker thing, right?

02:22:16.320 --> 02:22:17.320
No, no.

02:22:17.320 --> 02:22:22.320
It's an independent game based on the level from Ninja Turtles.

02:22:22.320 --> 02:22:26.320
You cruel bastards.

02:22:26.320 --> 02:22:27.320
All right.

02:22:27.320 --> 02:22:29.320
Shane Alinko with your number three answer.

02:22:29.320 --> 02:22:31.320
I just had to come up with this off the top of my head

02:22:31.320 --> 02:22:36.320
because low-key taking Ninja Turtles just threw my list out of whack.

02:22:36.320 --> 02:22:38.320
So I'm going to say Snake, Rattle, and Roll

02:22:38.320 --> 02:22:41.320
because I had fond memories of it when I was a kid,

02:22:41.320 --> 02:22:46.320
but then when I saw you play it on the Rare Replay collection,

02:22:46.320 --> 02:22:50.320
I don't know if I was given drugs as a kid

02:22:50.320 --> 02:22:52.320
or if I was just really dumb.

02:22:52.320 --> 02:22:55.320
But it was such a bad-looking game.

02:22:55.320 --> 02:22:59.320
It's like, oh, I'm this snake that gets longer but attacks jumping feet.

02:22:59.320 --> 02:23:01.320
I think that's Tiara's favorite NES game.

02:23:01.320 --> 02:23:02.320
Is it really?

02:23:02.320 --> 02:23:05.320
It's another one of those games that doesn't make a whole lot of sense

02:23:05.320 --> 02:23:06.320
until you like...

02:23:06.320 --> 02:23:09.320
I don't think it holds up either.

02:23:09.320 --> 02:23:14.320
Maybe if I was like five or six again when it came out the first time,

02:23:14.320 --> 02:23:15.320
I'd still like it.

02:23:15.320 --> 02:23:19.320
But since I'm not, it's pretty awful.

02:23:19.320 --> 02:23:20.320
All right.

02:23:20.320 --> 02:23:21.320
Well, this is a pretty interesting list so far.

02:23:21.320 --> 02:23:24.320
So far, the list consists of X-Men, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,

02:23:24.320 --> 02:23:28.320
Super Pitfall, Bible Adventures, and Snake, Rattle, and Roll.

02:23:28.320 --> 02:23:29.320
Let's get to number two answers.

02:23:29.320 --> 02:23:32.320
Dark Sakura, what is the worst NES game they ever made?

02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:36.320
Okay, since we are going off the beaten path,

02:23:36.320 --> 02:23:39.320
I am going to go ahead and name Cheetah Men 2.

02:23:39.320 --> 02:23:41.320
And that's men plural.

02:23:41.320 --> 02:23:43.320
Cheetah Men 2.

02:23:43.320 --> 02:23:45.320
I hope I spelled this right, but does it really matter?

02:23:45.320 --> 02:23:46.320
Let's be honest.

02:23:46.320 --> 02:23:47.320
Cheetah Men 2.

02:23:47.320 --> 02:23:50.320
It's basically some game that hardly anyone's ever heard of.

02:23:50.320 --> 02:23:55.320
It's completely unreleased, and it even actually plays like it's unfinished.

02:23:55.320 --> 02:23:59.320
It's a side-scrolling platformer.

02:23:59.320 --> 02:24:03.320
It's just shit, but it had to be on the list because it's so shitty.

02:24:03.320 --> 02:24:06.320
Actually, if you want to see a really good review of it,

02:24:06.320 --> 02:24:08.320
Angry Video Game Nerd did one.

02:24:08.320 --> 02:24:09.320
All right.

02:24:09.320 --> 02:24:10.320
Yeah.

02:24:10.320 --> 02:24:15.320
Cheetah Men 2 is like the things don't even touch you and you die.

02:24:15.320 --> 02:24:17.320
It's that bad.

02:24:17.320 --> 02:24:18.320
All right.

02:24:18.320 --> 02:24:19.320
Fair enough.

02:24:19.320 --> 02:24:22.320
Let's go to Loki with your number two answer.

02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:26.320
My number two answer is going to be Back to the Future 2 and 3

02:24:26.320 --> 02:24:28.320
because they did both movies into one game.

02:24:28.320 --> 02:24:31.320
And I remember reading about Back to the Future, the first game,

02:24:31.320 --> 02:24:34.320
and I was like, oh, hey, that looks pretty cool.

02:24:34.320 --> 02:24:38.320
And I played this game, and I'm like, wow, this game is really stupid.

02:24:38.320 --> 02:24:42.320
And you have to play all the way through Back to the Future 2

02:24:42.320 --> 02:24:45.320
to get to Back to the Future 3, and then I found a code for it,

02:24:45.320 --> 02:24:48.320
and Back to the Future 3 is still fucking lame.

02:24:48.320 --> 02:24:50.320
So it was just, I don't know.

02:24:50.320 --> 02:24:53.320
Yeah, you think like, oh, it's going to be awesome, like two movies in one.

02:24:53.320 --> 02:24:55.320
It was like some side-scrolling thing,

02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:59.320
and the hoverboard looks stupid, and the whole thing was just garbage.

02:24:59.320 --> 02:25:01.320
And it had nothing to do with the movie.

02:25:01.320 --> 02:25:03.320
Pretty much, yes.

02:25:03.320 --> 02:25:05.320
All right, my number two answer,

02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:07.320
and I feel like I'm going to take somebody's answer

02:25:07.320 --> 02:25:09.320
because this one was really bad,

02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:11.320
and it was one of the launch titles for the NES,

02:25:11.320 --> 02:25:14.320
and this makes it particularly worrisome.

02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:18.320
But you know, in the 80s, they had to show us the good

02:25:18.320 --> 02:25:20.320
that video games could do

02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:23.320
and the edutainment purposes of video games,

02:25:23.320 --> 02:25:26.320
which is why we had such a popular, iconic character

02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:30.320
like Donkey Kong Jr. teaching us math.

02:25:30.320 --> 02:25:35.320
That's right, Donkey Kong Jr. math is my number two answer.

02:25:35.320 --> 02:25:38.320
And if you've never seen it, it was basically like

02:25:38.320 --> 02:25:41.320
they kind of took one of the boards from Donkey Kong Jr.

02:25:41.320 --> 02:25:45.320
and made math equations out of it, and it was number one.

02:25:45.320 --> 02:25:48.320
I only knew about that game because of Animal Crossing.

02:25:48.320 --> 02:25:51.320
That's right, it was one of the games Animal Crossing.

02:25:51.320 --> 02:25:53.320
Yes, I think that's where a lot of us played it

02:25:53.320 --> 02:25:54.320
and got very upset.

02:25:54.320 --> 02:25:56.320
That's the game that's coming to Virtual Console,

02:25:56.320 --> 02:25:57.320
that they have to get the trademark.

02:25:57.320 --> 02:25:59.320
Problem, right?

02:25:59.320 --> 02:26:01.320
Hey, look, you can learn things on your Wii U

02:26:01.320 --> 02:26:02.320
about long division.

02:26:02.320 --> 02:26:04.320
Actually, I think it was all addition subtraction,

02:26:04.320 --> 02:26:07.320
but it was garbage, so there it is.

02:26:07.320 --> 02:26:10.320
Donkey Kong Jr. math is my number two pick.

02:26:10.320 --> 02:26:12.320
Flaco Jones, you're next, your number two pick.

02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:14.320
All right, I keep going back and forth.

02:26:14.320 --> 02:26:16.320
I don't think I'm going to mention the game I mentioned earlier.

02:26:16.320 --> 02:26:17.320
I don't know.

02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:19.320
I'll do a different one.

02:26:19.320 --> 02:26:20.320
Yes, no, maybe I'll save that one.

02:26:20.320 --> 02:26:21.320
I'll save that one for last.

02:26:21.320 --> 02:26:25.320
Okay, so this pick is Top Gun.

02:26:25.320 --> 02:26:27.320
Was anyone able to beat that game?

02:26:27.320 --> 02:26:28.320
Yes.

02:26:28.320 --> 02:26:31.320
How do you land on the aircraft carrier after the first level?

02:26:31.320 --> 02:26:32.320
The first level I can land.

02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:34.320
After that, I can't land anymore.

02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:37.320
How do you fucking refuel in that game?

02:26:37.320 --> 02:26:38.320
I can refuel.

02:26:38.320 --> 02:26:39.320
I can get that every once in a while.

02:26:39.320 --> 02:26:42.320
But what sucks is if you fail to refuel,

02:26:42.320 --> 02:26:44.320
you still got to fly around until you die.

02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:47.320
Well, you're not going to make it, but just fly around for a while.

02:26:47.320 --> 02:26:49.320
You had the sex in that game.

02:26:49.320 --> 02:26:51.320
You had the sex with the refuel.

02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:52.320
What was the same as the aircraft thing?

02:26:52.320 --> 02:26:53.320
It was the same as landing.

02:26:53.320 --> 02:26:57.320
You had to be like, left, left, left, right, right, right, up, down, pull up, up.

02:26:57.320 --> 02:26:59.320
And it's like, nope, too late, couldn't do it.

02:26:59.320 --> 02:27:00.320
The plane flies away.

02:27:00.320 --> 02:27:02.320
I'm like, oh, good, I'm going to die, but I still got to play.

02:27:02.320 --> 02:27:05.320
Darsakra, you said you can actually do it?

02:27:05.320 --> 02:27:06.320
You could beat that game.

02:27:06.320 --> 02:27:08.320
It's been ages, but yeah, I beat it when I was 11.

02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:12.320
I swear, I get so close on level two to land on the aircraft carrier.

02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:15.320
And it says, pull up.

02:27:16.320 --> 02:27:22.320
I watched one of those videos that have the play throughs on them

02:27:22.320 --> 02:27:24.320
that you would buy on VHS.

02:27:24.320 --> 02:27:29.320
And it had the tips on how to hook up to the aircraft carrier

02:27:29.320 --> 02:27:31.320
and how to refuel and everything.

02:27:31.320 --> 02:27:34.320
And once I wrote down the numbers that you had to have

02:27:34.320 --> 02:27:38.320
to get the nose up just right and the wings just right,

02:27:38.320 --> 02:27:40.320
then I aced it every time.

02:27:40.320 --> 02:27:41.320
I can see you having the numbers help.

02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:42.320
I guess it never went that far.

02:27:42.320 --> 02:27:43.320
I just got so mad.

02:27:43.320 --> 02:27:44.320
I was like, screw this game forever.

02:27:44.320 --> 02:27:47.320
Once you had the numbers, then it was like, oh, okay.

02:27:47.320 --> 02:27:49.320
Let's do the research for Zelda.

02:27:49.320 --> 02:27:51.320
I can't do that on the Top Gun. I got so angry.

02:27:51.320 --> 02:27:54.320
Even though I honestly didn't have too much of a fun time with it,

02:27:54.320 --> 02:27:55.320
I just beat it to prove I could.

02:27:55.320 --> 02:27:56.320
All right.

02:27:56.320 --> 02:27:58.320
Darsakra, we need to see how much you can remember.

02:27:58.320 --> 02:28:01.320
You have some pretty lofty gaming accomplishments here.

02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:03.320
I'm like, I would like to see you do Mega Man blindfolded.

02:28:03.320 --> 02:28:04.320
That would be a lot of fun.

02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:06.320
I don't think I could do that anymore.

02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:08.320
I mean, shoot, do you want to know how many times?

02:28:08.320 --> 02:28:10.320
You'd be surprised what comes back with muscle memory.

02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:11.320
Oh my God.

02:28:11.320 --> 02:28:13.320
But do you want to know how many times it took me to do that

02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:14.320
the first time?

02:28:14.320 --> 02:28:15.320
That's true.

02:28:15.320 --> 02:28:17.320
Is I actually had to play through that level

02:28:17.320 --> 02:28:19.320
something like 10 times.

02:28:19.320 --> 02:28:22.320
They blindfolded me and I did it again.

02:28:22.320 --> 02:28:24.320
When I played the Mega Man collection on that,

02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:26.320
because that just came out a long ago.

02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:27.320
Timing on that one's bad, by the way.

02:28:27.320 --> 02:28:28.320
Is it?

02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:29.320
It is. The timing's off.

02:28:29.320 --> 02:28:30.320
Okay, because it took me a couple tries,

02:28:30.320 --> 02:28:32.320
but then I was finally able to do the Quick Man thing.

02:28:32.320 --> 02:28:35.320
But I was surprised how much would just be muscle memory.

02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:37.320
I knew things to fall down.

02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:38.320
We compared it.

02:28:38.320 --> 02:28:41.320
We took the actual cartridge versus the collection.

02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:43.320
And yeah, timing is off in Quick Man's stage.

02:28:43.320 --> 02:28:44.320
Interesting.

02:28:44.320 --> 02:28:46.320
All right, s2100matt says,

02:28:46.320 --> 02:28:49.320
Clearly Flaco wants Konami to apologize for Top Gun.

02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:50.320
Possibly.

02:28:50.320 --> 02:28:52.320
s2100matt says, I still have muscle memory

02:28:52.320 --> 02:28:54.320
for some classic DDR step charts,

02:28:54.320 --> 02:28:56.320
even after not playing DDR for years.

02:28:56.320 --> 02:28:58.320
Oh yeah, every time I hear like Orion 7-8,

02:28:58.320 --> 02:28:59.320
I hear it just in my mind,

02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:02.320
duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh.

02:29:02.320 --> 02:29:03.320
You just hear the step patterns in your mind.

02:29:03.320 --> 02:29:05.320
Anyway, nerd, nerd, nerd.

02:29:05.320 --> 02:29:06.320
All right, speaking of nerd,

02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:10.320
Shane, what is your number two worst NES game ever?

02:29:10.320 --> 02:29:13.320
So I'm going to explain why it is before I say what it is.

02:29:13.320 --> 02:29:14.320
Okay.

02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:18.320
So this game is terrible

02:29:18.320 --> 02:29:21.320
because it's way too difficult for what it should be.

02:29:21.320 --> 02:29:25.320
And for the license it is, it also should not be difficult.

02:29:25.320 --> 02:29:27.320
And it also scared me as a kid.

02:29:27.320 --> 02:29:30.320
So my number two game is Mickey Mousecapades.

02:29:30.320 --> 02:29:35.320
Didn't somebody say that was their favorite game earlier?

02:29:35.320 --> 02:29:37.320
Oh no, that's fighting words.

02:29:37.320 --> 02:29:39.320
So what was it about Mickey Mousecapades

02:29:39.320 --> 02:29:41.320
you just, it was too frustrating.

02:29:41.320 --> 02:29:42.320
It was scary and frightening.

02:29:42.320 --> 02:29:43.320
Why was it scary?

02:29:43.320 --> 02:29:45.320
I don't know, a lot of games scared me when I was a kid.

02:29:45.320 --> 02:29:48.320
My number one game also scared me as a kid.

02:29:48.320 --> 02:29:50.320
I think you get scared easy.

02:29:50.320 --> 02:29:54.320
It was, and I love Silent Hill and stuff like that.

02:29:54.320 --> 02:29:56.320
That's not nearly as scary as Cat in the Hat

02:29:56.320 --> 02:29:59.320
and picks up the mix-up,

02:29:59.320 --> 02:30:03.320
which is a scarring game for me.

02:30:03.320 --> 02:30:05.320
Didn't I find footage on YouTube of that and you started crying?

02:30:05.320 --> 02:30:06.320
I did not like it.

02:30:06.320 --> 02:30:08.320
I did not like it.

02:30:08.320 --> 02:30:11.320
But yeah, it wasn't very fun.

02:30:11.320 --> 02:30:13.320
It's a Mickey game.

02:30:13.320 --> 02:30:15.320
It should be not super difficult.

02:30:15.320 --> 02:30:17.320
But as a kid that game was just so hard.

02:30:17.320 --> 02:30:19.320
And why are they throwing stars?

02:30:19.320 --> 02:30:21.320
When did Mickey and Minnie start throwing stars?

02:30:21.320 --> 02:30:23.320
When they became ninjas.

02:30:23.320 --> 02:30:24.320
But they weren't ninjas.

02:30:24.320 --> 02:30:26.320
And Minnie was so frustrating.

02:30:26.320 --> 02:30:31.320
Alright, anyhow, folks in chat predicting that will be an early elimination in the next round.

02:30:31.320 --> 02:30:33.320
But we can't, we're not there yet.

02:30:33.320 --> 02:30:36.320
So far the list contains X-Men, Cheetahmen 2, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,

02:30:36.320 --> 02:30:37.320
Back to the Future 2 and 3,

02:30:37.320 --> 02:30:42.320
Super Pitfall, Donkey Kong Jr. Math, Bible Adventures, Top Gun, Snake Rattle and Roll, Mickey Mousecapades.

02:30:42.320 --> 02:30:45.320
We've got room for five more for now, so let's get to it.

02:30:45.320 --> 02:30:49.320
Dark Sakura, the worst NES game they ever made.

02:30:49.320 --> 02:30:50.320
Don't hate me, please.

02:30:50.320 --> 02:30:52.320
I'm gonna, but what is it?

02:30:52.320 --> 02:30:53.320
Castlevania 2, Simon's Quest.

02:30:53.320 --> 02:30:56.320
Oh, fuck! You're going for the jugular!

02:30:56.320 --> 02:30:59.320
Damn! No way! No way!

02:30:59.320 --> 02:31:01.320
What? Okay, but why?

02:31:01.320 --> 02:31:06.320
Because it broke the mold of Castlevania games and not in a good way.

02:31:06.320 --> 02:31:15.320
It was like trying to play a Castlevania RPG that didn't want to be an RPG and didn't want to be a Castlevania game.

02:31:15.320 --> 02:31:17.320
It really was just...

02:31:17.320 --> 02:31:21.320
I feel like that's what led us to Symphony of the Night.

02:31:21.320 --> 02:31:25.320
No, I think Metroid led its way to Symphony of the Night.

02:31:25.320 --> 02:31:30.320
This one, you're walking around outside and you're talking to villagers and shit.

02:31:30.320 --> 02:31:34.320
And even if it did, it took the few good qualities from it.

02:31:34.320 --> 02:31:37.320
It was hard as fuck, first of all.

02:31:37.320 --> 02:31:44.320
And then the only good thing about it was what a terrible night to have a curse.

02:31:44.320 --> 02:31:46.320
The music, though.

02:31:46.320 --> 02:31:47.320
The music was great.

02:31:47.320 --> 02:31:50.320
I mean, I'm just saying going strictly gameplay...

02:31:50.320 --> 02:31:51.320
It's alright.

02:31:51.320 --> 02:31:54.320
I have a feeling this is the round where we're all gonna kick each other in the balls.

02:31:54.320 --> 02:31:56.320
So, you know, metaphorically.

02:31:56.320 --> 02:31:58.320
Well, I mean, it just don't...

02:31:58.320 --> 02:32:03.320
It was a big disappointment to me because Castlevania was fantastic.

02:32:03.320 --> 02:32:06.320
Castlevania 3 was fantastic.

02:32:06.320 --> 02:32:11.320
Every Castlevania game, even Dracula X on the Super Nintendo,

02:32:11.320 --> 02:32:17.320
which was no way as good as the PC Engine version, was better than this.

02:32:17.320 --> 02:32:21.320
You are entitled to your opinion even when you are extremely wrong.

02:32:24.320 --> 02:32:25.320
Hearts.

02:32:25.320 --> 02:32:26.320
Girl.

02:32:26.320 --> 02:32:27.320
Alright, anyway.

02:32:27.320 --> 02:32:30.320
My number one will not be popular either, but we'll see.

02:32:30.320 --> 02:32:32.320
Loki, here it is, your number one answer.

02:32:32.320 --> 02:32:34.320
The worst NES game they ever made.

02:32:34.320 --> 02:32:38.320
Okay, so, like, all these games have been mentioned have been games I actually played,

02:32:38.320 --> 02:32:43.320
and I actually played this too because we rented a ton of fucking games back in the NES days.

02:32:43.320 --> 02:32:46.320
And this game was so fucking weird.

02:32:46.320 --> 02:32:49.320
And I guess it makes sense because what the hell are you gonna do in a type of game like this

02:32:49.320 --> 02:32:54.320
that's based off this license, but the worst game I probably played was Barbie.

02:32:54.320 --> 02:32:56.320
The Barbie game.

02:32:56.320 --> 02:32:58.320
And it was fucking weird.

02:32:58.320 --> 02:33:03.320
Just like shoes and shit bouncing up and down, like purses, and like, I don't know.

02:33:03.320 --> 02:33:07.320
It was a weird fucking hard game for girls, I guess, to play.

02:33:07.320 --> 02:33:10.320
And it's just, I don't know, it's silly.

02:33:10.320 --> 02:33:12.320
Alright, there it is.

02:33:12.320 --> 02:33:15.320
Barbie is the worst video game they ever made.

02:33:15.320 --> 02:33:18.320
It is kind of shit though, I have to be honest.

02:33:18.320 --> 02:33:20.320
I mean, it had some impossible jumps and so forth.

02:33:20.320 --> 02:33:22.320
Alright, we'll see.

02:33:22.320 --> 02:33:27.320
Alright, my number one pick for the worst NES game they ever did make.

02:33:27.320 --> 02:33:29.320
You ready? Because not everybody's gonna agree with me.

02:33:29.320 --> 02:33:32.320
But I think this game is super fucking overrated,

02:33:32.320 --> 02:33:35.320
and it's one of those games when you sit there and you play it again, you're like,

02:33:35.320 --> 02:33:37.320
this game is trash.

02:33:37.320 --> 02:33:42.320
And what's also huge about this game is that it's the game that everybody remembers

02:33:42.320 --> 02:33:45.320
around a particular peripheral they made for the NES,

02:33:45.320 --> 02:33:49.320
even though there were way better games that used the same peripheral,

02:33:49.320 --> 02:33:54.320
which is why Duck Hunt is the worst video game on the NES.

02:33:55.320 --> 02:33:58.320
Duck Hunt is the worst. No, come on!

02:33:58.320 --> 02:34:01.320
Who actually sat there and played the game the way it meant to be played?

02:34:01.320 --> 02:34:03.320
It was just everybody sitting in front of the TV,

02:34:03.320 --> 02:34:06.320
you couldn't kill the dog who was a total twat,

02:34:06.320 --> 02:34:08.320
everybody wanted to kill the damn dog and you couldn't.

02:34:08.320 --> 02:34:11.320
No, I played it the right way. I didn't just go up to the TV and hold my gun there.

02:34:11.320 --> 02:34:13.320
I'm just saying...

02:34:13.320 --> 02:34:15.320
I would play the clay pigeon a lot.

02:34:15.320 --> 02:34:17.320
Yeah, clay pigeon game was fun too.

02:34:17.320 --> 02:34:19.320
I'm just saying Hogan's Alley was a better light gun game.

02:34:19.320 --> 02:34:21.320
I do love Hogan's Alley, but Duck Hunt's awesome.

02:34:21.320 --> 02:34:23.320
No it's not.

02:34:24.320 --> 02:34:26.320
Overrated. Overrated.

02:34:26.320 --> 02:34:29.320
I was only happy when the dog was announced for Smash Brothers

02:34:29.320 --> 02:34:31.320
so I could kick its ass.

02:34:31.320 --> 02:34:33.320
That was really all it was.

02:34:33.320 --> 02:34:36.320
Some folks in chat getting really mad at me for that answer.

02:34:36.320 --> 02:34:38.320
Well, all I have to say is...

02:34:40.320 --> 02:34:43.320
No one actually disagreed with me over Castlevania, by the way.

02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:47.320
They know better than to disagree with you.

02:34:47.320 --> 02:34:50.320
I love Castlevania 2. It's like one of my favorite Castlevania games.

02:34:50.320 --> 02:34:53.320
I know. I think all four of us will be eliminating Castlevania.

02:34:53.320 --> 02:34:55.320
That's what happens. That's what happens.

02:34:55.320 --> 02:34:57.320
We'll see. We'll see.

02:34:57.320 --> 02:35:00.320
Moving on though. Flaco Jones, your number one answer.

02:35:00.320 --> 02:35:02.320
I keep going back and forth.

02:35:02.320 --> 02:35:05.320
I was going to pick Ten Yard Fight, but it's a sports game, so who cares?

02:35:05.320 --> 02:35:08.320
So I'm going to pick the game I talked about at the beginning with Shane, which is Trojan.

02:35:08.320 --> 02:35:10.320
Which Shane likes, I guess.

02:35:10.320 --> 02:35:13.320
I don't know why I'm picking a game to argue with Shane about.

02:35:13.320 --> 02:35:17.320
I just remember everybody associating it with condoms.

02:35:17.320 --> 02:35:19.320
That's all I remember.

02:35:19.320 --> 02:35:21.320
Just because it's called Trojan?

02:35:21.320 --> 02:35:25.320
Yeah, Trojan's always been... I don't know. Whatever.

02:35:25.320 --> 02:35:27.320
I don't know what to do.

02:35:27.320 --> 02:35:31.320
It's another game that I just kind of got as a hand-me-down, because I did most of my games.

02:35:31.320 --> 02:35:33.320
So I just played it, and I was like,

02:35:33.320 --> 02:35:37.320
this game is so weird. You've got to kneel down and swing your sword a bunch of times to kill things.

02:35:37.320 --> 02:35:42.320
I did kind of like the mode where you get to fight your friend, but even that was just so weird.

02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:45.320
You got to jump using the up button. They didn't have a dedicated jump button.

02:35:45.320 --> 02:35:48.320
It's always so bothersome in a game like that.

02:35:48.320 --> 02:35:50.320
But there's some cool power-ups you get.

02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:52.320
But I just couldn't get very far in it.

02:35:52.320 --> 02:35:54.320
The graphics look kind of lame.

02:35:54.320 --> 02:35:56.320
It's a Capcom game, right?

02:35:56.320 --> 02:36:00.320
Yeah, so it's like when you've got Mega Man and Bionic Commando, and then you have this.

02:36:00.320 --> 02:36:05.320
Sometimes they make that one choice in the game that just ruins the whole fucking thing.

02:36:05.320 --> 02:36:10.320
I was really going to go for Blood and put Rygar on my list, because he didn't have a fucking save chip.

02:36:10.320 --> 02:36:13.320
How can you beat Rygar? You can't.

02:36:13.320 --> 02:36:14.320
Dan can.

02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:16.320
Well, Dan's insane.

02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:18.320
I don't think you can save on Trojan, either.

02:36:18.320 --> 02:36:21.320
No, you have to play straight through Trojan, too. I just couldn't do it.

02:36:21.320 --> 02:36:28.320
Alright. Anyway, here we go. One more space on the list here, and it's going to belong to Shane Alinko.

02:36:28.320 --> 02:36:30.320
Shane, what is the worst NES game they ever made?

02:36:30.320 --> 02:36:36.320
Okay, again, this game's there because terrible choice for what they're doing with the license.

02:36:36.320 --> 02:36:41.320
It was really hard, and it scared me even more than Mickey Mouse paid.

02:36:41.320 --> 02:36:45.320
My number one choice is Bart vs. the Space Mutants.

02:36:47.320 --> 02:36:48.320
Such a bad game.

02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:50.320
I actually don't remember Bart vs. the Space Mutants.

02:36:50.320 --> 02:36:51.320
It's not good.

02:36:51.320 --> 02:36:52.320
What happened in that one?

02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:57.320
Aliens were trying to take over, and in the first stage, you had to color things not purple,

02:36:57.320 --> 02:36:59.320
because they're a machine to take over the world.

02:36:59.320 --> 02:37:03.320
They had to have purple things, so you would spray paint over that with red.

02:37:03.320 --> 02:37:07.320
And then the second stage is, you've got to collect hats, because their new machine requires hats.

02:37:07.320 --> 02:37:08.320
Wow.

02:37:08.320 --> 02:37:10.320
Yeah, it was really bad.

02:37:10.320 --> 02:37:15.320
I remember Bart and the Nightmare, the Bart dream nightmare, but that was Super Nintendo.

02:37:15.320 --> 02:37:17.320
That wasn't quite as bad.

02:37:17.320 --> 02:37:19.320
But it was kind of crap.

02:37:19.320 --> 02:37:21.320
All right, wow, there it is.

02:37:21.320 --> 02:37:25.320
I'm going to read through this list, but I want to acknowledge some of our chat room comments here.

02:37:25.320 --> 02:37:28.320
I was trying to see what they were saying back towards the beginning.

02:37:28.320 --> 02:37:29.320
Did we get some people yelling answers?

02:37:29.320 --> 02:37:33.320
Silver Surfer was shouted out in the chat room there.

02:37:33.320 --> 02:37:35.320
The Adventures of the Link.

02:37:35.320 --> 02:37:37.320
Non-silon-occupied Caprica.

02:37:37.320 --> 02:37:39.320
I don't think that was actually a game, though.

02:37:39.320 --> 02:37:42.320
Not that kind of list list tonight.

02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:45.320
Even Flaco was like, wait a minute, you're doing a list list?

02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:47.320
You don't have silly answers?

02:37:47.320 --> 02:37:51.320
I was like, well, you know people are going to go for blood by putting a game that's considered good on the list.

02:37:51.320 --> 02:37:54.320
I honestly can't remember a serious answer list list.

02:37:54.320 --> 02:37:56.320
I don't know why.

02:37:56.320 --> 02:38:00.320
It must have happened. I've only been listening for eight years.

02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:02.320
Maybe before that, Flaco.

02:38:02.320 --> 02:38:04.320
Anyway, be thinking about this, guys.

02:38:04.320 --> 02:38:08.320
Here it is. Here's the list as it stands now, but we have one more very important round.

02:38:08.320 --> 02:38:10.320
So far, here is the list.

02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:25.320
X-Men, Cheetahmen 2, Castlevania II, Simon's Quest, Bible Adventures, Top Gun, Trojan, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Back to the Future 2 and 3, Barbie, Snake, Rattle and Roll, Mickey Mouse Capades, Bart vs. the Space Mutants, Super Pitfall, Donkey Kong Jr. Math, and Duck Hunt.

02:38:25.320 --> 02:38:30.320
Let's just, you know, I realize there's a few controversial choices on here, but I think we did a pretty good job.

02:38:30.320 --> 02:38:33.320
I think this is a pretty good list that we got so far.

02:38:33.320 --> 02:38:39.320
But here we go. Here is that round. You gotta do it. It's part of the process.

02:38:39.320 --> 02:38:41.320
Now it's time for the elimination round.

02:38:41.320 --> 02:38:43.320
Dark Sakura, ladies first.

02:38:43.320 --> 02:38:46.320
Which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:38:49.320 --> 02:38:54.320
I am going to take off...

02:38:57.320 --> 02:38:59.320
For Tiara, I'll take off Snake, Rattle and Roll.

02:38:59.320 --> 02:39:03.320
For Tiara, she's taken off Snake, Rattle and Roll.

02:39:03.320 --> 02:39:04.320
They're all pretty bad.

02:39:04.320 --> 02:39:07.320
It has been stricken from the list. It wasn't that bad, Shane.

02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:11.320
It wasn't that bad. At least that wasn't one of the ones that scared you.

02:39:11.320 --> 02:39:22.320
Alright. Do remember though, in a revision to the listless rules we made a couple years ago, if a host loses two of their answers, the other will get immunity and cannot be removed.

02:39:22.320 --> 02:39:26.320
So if one of Shane's other answers disappears, the third will get immunity.

02:39:26.320 --> 02:39:31.320
Let's see what happens though. Up next is Loki. Loki, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:39:31.320 --> 02:39:32.320
I'd say Simon's Quest.

02:39:32.320 --> 02:39:36.320
Simon's Quest. I think Dark Sakura knew she was losing that one.

02:39:36.320 --> 02:39:37.320
I'm just keeping it real.

02:39:37.320 --> 02:39:41.320
I'm just keeping it real. Alright, there it is. It has been stricken from the list.

02:39:41.320 --> 02:39:43.320
Castlevania II, Simon's Quest has been removed.

02:39:43.320 --> 02:39:45.320
Ooh, that means it's my turn.

02:39:46.320 --> 02:39:49.320
Which one am I going to remove from this?

02:39:49.320 --> 02:40:03.320
I'm really tempted to take one of Shane's off, but I think I'm going to go for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles because Alan got really offended, so I feel like if I don't remove that...

02:40:03.320 --> 02:40:06.320
I kind of like how Dark Sakura did hers for Tiara. I'm doing this one for Alan.

02:40:06.320 --> 02:40:11.320
So I'm taking Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles off the list. It has been removed from the list.

02:40:11.320 --> 02:40:16.320
Flaco Jones, three down, two to go. Flaco, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:40:16.320 --> 02:40:17.320
Goodbye, Duck Hunt.

02:40:17.320 --> 02:40:18.320
Duck Hunt.

02:40:18.320 --> 02:40:19.320
Duck Hunt!

02:40:19.320 --> 02:40:20.320
Yeah!

02:40:20.320 --> 02:40:21.320
I knew I was going to lose that one.

02:40:21.320 --> 02:40:22.320
I'm so glad it was still there.

02:40:22.320 --> 02:40:27.320
Alright, Duck Hunt has been removed from the list wrongfully by Flaco Jones.

02:40:27.320 --> 02:40:31.320
Alright, Shane, I just want to point out Flaco's list is still intact, but...

02:40:31.320 --> 02:40:32.320
I'm taking off Trojan.

02:40:32.320 --> 02:40:33.320
I knew it!

02:40:33.320 --> 02:40:34.320
Trojan!

02:40:34.320 --> 02:40:35.320
I knew it!

02:40:37.320 --> 02:40:40.320
It's like, it's pretty easy. It's softball.

02:40:40.320 --> 02:40:42.320
Why did you choose? Are you a big fan of Trojan?

02:40:42.320 --> 02:40:45.320
Yes, I loved Trojan when I was a kid. That was a fun game.

02:40:45.320 --> 02:40:46.320
Why?

02:40:46.320 --> 02:40:47.320
I wouldn't like it now.

02:40:47.320 --> 02:40:48.320
Alright.

02:40:48.320 --> 02:40:51.320
But I was like five, so lots of things were fun at five.

02:40:51.320 --> 02:40:57.320
This is, this is, everybody lost one answer. That's pretty good for five people. Everybody lost one.

02:40:57.320 --> 02:41:00.320
I know, I expected some people to go down to just one answer.

02:41:00.320 --> 02:41:02.320
I thought I was going to take Mickey Mouse campaigns off.

02:41:02.320 --> 02:41:04.320
Why? It was terrible.

02:41:04.320 --> 02:41:08.320
Because then I would have to hear it from Alan. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is not that bad.

02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:14.320
Well, there's no way anyone's going to defend Back to the Future 2 and 3 or Barbie the game, because they're both fucking terrible.

02:41:14.320 --> 02:41:25.320
Alright, so here we go. It is about time for you to vote. Remember, when you do vote at vognetwork.com, you click on your number one answer, then your number two answer.

02:41:25.320 --> 02:41:26.320
So here it is.

02:41:26.320 --> 02:41:42.320
The list now contains X-Men, Cheetah Men 2, Back to the Future 2 and 3, Barbie, Super Pitfall, Donkey Kong Jr. Math, Bible Adventures, Top Gun, Mickey Mousecapades, Bart vs. the Space Mutants.

02:41:42.320 --> 02:41:53.320
Vote now at live.vognetwork.com. You do have to be a registered member of the site, but it's free, and I swear we will not sell you to some, you know, Nigerian Prince Lottery scheme.

02:41:53.320 --> 02:42:01.320
I'm not going to do that, so go ahead and sign in and click your number one, then your number two answer, and be sure to answer that.

02:42:01.320 --> 02:42:06.320
And we will get to the top answers in just a little bit, probably after the mailbag.

02:42:06.320 --> 02:42:09.320
But for now, oh, it's actually time for the mailbag. Let's get to it.

02:42:09.320 --> 02:42:16.320
Dark Soccer's going to dive into our mailbag. Participate at orangelaungeradio.com, where I think we actually got quite a few emails tonight. I'm excited.

02:42:16.320 --> 02:42:18.320
And they're all sticky.

02:42:18.320 --> 02:42:20.320
I'm excited for one of them that I heard about.

02:42:20.320 --> 02:42:22.320
Oh boy, alright, let's get to it.

02:42:22.320 --> 02:42:28.320
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com if you want to send us an email. We have three of them tonight, so let's get to it, Dark Soccer.

02:42:28.320 --> 02:42:33.320
This is titled Power Portals with a Z. Thank you, Canada.

02:42:34.320 --> 02:42:43.320
I'm planning on getting my dad into Ingress on his 5C, even though it's only a 16GB model. So is mine, don't worry about it. Mine's a 5S, though.

02:42:43.320 --> 02:42:54.320
As for me, can you recommend the game on devices dependent on WiFi? No, it just says recommend the game on devices dependent on WiFi.

02:42:54.320 --> 02:43:01.320
I really can't, just to be fair. Which, by the way, I don't know when this turned into the Ingress podcast. I'm not sure how I feel about that.

02:43:01.320 --> 02:43:10.320
But I would say no. WiFi, you have to be able to go out to places of interest. In fact, if you're on a really strict data plan, don't do it either.

02:43:10.320 --> 02:43:17.320
You have to be able to have enough data. It eats up a lot of data. It does eat up a lot of data, so just be mindful.

02:43:17.320 --> 02:43:31.320
While it's obviously not his demographic, has Shane seen the Fisher-Price MMPR Imaginext line, including the 2-foot tall Megazord playset?

02:43:31.320 --> 02:43:42.320
Yes, clearly he has. Interesting. Also weird that the current Monster slash Halloween-themed LEGO minifigure series blind bags are perpetually sold out.

02:43:42.320 --> 02:43:50.320
Finally, while it's not exactly cave quality, have any of you checked out Shootie Skies? Fairly serious megalomania vibe there.

02:43:50.320 --> 02:43:54.320
And that comes from Robert M. No, I have not.

02:43:54.320 --> 02:43:58.320
Yeah, I can't say I've played that one either.

02:43:58.320 --> 02:44:00.320
So the answer is no.

02:44:00.320 --> 02:44:04.320
Alright, moving forward. Kind of long email.

02:44:04.320 --> 02:44:10.320
Gotta say I'm with you on Rock Band 4, Rob. I was expecting and hoping for a lot more from Rock Band 4.

02:44:10.320 --> 02:44:17.320
Not only removing keys and skimming on character creation, like you mentioned, but also taking out Pro Guitar and even online.

02:44:17.320 --> 02:44:24.320
I can see their reasoning. Their data and polls suggested that most of the features they removed were the less used ones.

02:44:24.320 --> 02:44:28.320
It's still kind of disappointing to compare Rock Band 3 and Rock Band 4.

02:44:28.320 --> 02:44:36.320
I'm still enjoying the game as the basic gameplay is still great, but I keep thinking, maybe I should just toss in Rock Band 3 instead.

02:44:36.320 --> 02:44:42.320
I was just going to say, just quickly, there was not enough additions to make up for the subtractions.

02:44:42.320 --> 02:44:49.320
And that's the problem. So big fucking deal, they added this solo thing that's kind of, I don't really care for the solo thing at all, actually, the way they did it.

02:44:49.320 --> 02:44:58.320
I preferred it the old way. I did play a little more Rock Band 4 this week, and to be fair on some of my criticisms last week,

02:44:58.320 --> 02:45:05.320
I did find that this time, if I was able to go into DLC that I knew I'd bought, even if it said $1.99, I was able to download it for free.

02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:08.320
So I got the rest of my No Doubt album and some of the other things I knew I had.

02:45:08.320 --> 02:45:14.320
But it's still, I can't say it's a better game than Rock Band 3.

02:45:14.320 --> 02:45:19.320
So again, if you need the Rock Band experience on a current console, okay, great. I mean, Rock Band is still a good game.

02:45:19.320 --> 02:45:26.320
I would have still recommended Rock Band 1 and 2, but it's just, it's a little disappointing. I was expecting a little more. That's all.

02:45:26.320 --> 02:45:34.320
As for the DLC issue, I was having similar issues on PS4. Some song packs not showing up properly or not downloading or whatever.

02:45:34.320 --> 02:45:39.320
At the very least, they've been working pretty hard on fixing that stuff.

02:45:39.320 --> 02:45:44.320
Just in the week that the game's been out, I've had several songs go from not working to working.

02:45:44.320 --> 02:45:51.320
Sucks to have to keep checking back given the volume of songs to scroll through, but that's also probably what's taking them so long.

02:45:51.320 --> 02:46:00.320
There's a thread on their forum where you can communicate any DLC issues you have, and I suggest going in there if you're finding stuff that's not working.

02:46:00.320 --> 02:46:09.320
I agree that I wish there were some easier way to find the songs you own, but sadly I think that's the problem with PSN and Xbox Live.

02:46:09.320 --> 02:46:12.320
Not so much something Harmonix could have changed.

02:46:12.320 --> 02:46:25.320
If there's a silver lining that the game has been getting decent enough reviews, Harmonix has said that they consider Rock Band 4 to be a platform, and they are game to add in new features as time goes on.

02:46:25.320 --> 02:46:31.320
So hopefully enough people are picking up the game to make that worth their while. That comes from Andy R.

02:46:31.320 --> 02:46:42.320
Thank you for the email, Andy R. Hey, Diablo 3 got fixed. Destiny got fixed. That's this weird thing about where we're at with gaming these days.

02:46:42.320 --> 02:46:50.320
So you know what? Maybe they can make some patches and make Rock Band 4 get some more of those pluses to make up for some of the minuses.

02:46:51.320 --> 02:46:54.320
Alright, last email. It's a little bit of a long one, but I'll read it.

02:46:54.320 --> 02:47:01.320
Hello, OLR. And if this is actually your real legitimate name, I am sorry for sitting on air, but it looks like a nickname.

02:47:01.320 --> 02:47:14.320
So, James Nighthawk here. I've been listening for about six months now after hearing about the show from Rob while guesting with the crazy chaps on Koopa Club, and I've been meaning to email to say hi.

02:47:14.320 --> 02:47:19.320
Recently someone suggested on your show that Rob's superpowers should be making people start podcasts.

02:47:20.320 --> 02:47:27.320
Well, I just wanted to say that you guys at OLR are in no small part responsible for myself starting my own podcast this summer.

02:47:27.320 --> 02:47:33.320
I am a songwriter and music producer by trade. I have been an active member of Songwriting Forum for years.

02:47:33.320 --> 02:47:45.320
It was after listening to OLR Koopa Club and a few other indie podcasts that I realized that it is a passion and personality that really matter to giving a podcast a unique edge.

02:47:45.320 --> 02:47:55.320
I have listened to bigger budget podcasts for years from the likes of the BBC and such, but the smaller indie podcasts seem to allow a freedom of expression that really appeals to me.

02:47:55.320 --> 02:48:06.320
Can I just jump in real quick? First off, if he's a songwriter, I don't think he's going to mind at all. I'm pretty sure I saw a tweet from this person this week, and I don't think they're going to mind at all that you said their name.

02:48:07.320 --> 02:48:17.320
I was going to say also shout out to Koopa Club. I was supposed to guest on their show again this past week, but Jeremy got sick, so I guess we're rescheduling that.

02:48:17.320 --> 02:48:23.320
They were on a little hiatus, and they're kind of doing a different format now. So yeah, shout out to them.

02:48:24.320 --> 02:48:38.320
I also want to say to that comment is that I really agree. I think part of that is when you're doing a podcast for the BBC or even something like IGN or whatever, you have to remember that whatever you're saying kind of reflects on your company.

02:48:38.320 --> 02:48:47.320
So I think even though you can have a No Whole Bards podcast or whatever, you still have that in the back of your mind that you're representing your company.

02:48:47.320 --> 02:48:54.320
Whereas here on OLR, my day job has nothing to do with the gaming industry. If it did, I probably wouldn't be able to do this show for you guys.

02:48:54.320 --> 02:49:01.320
But because my day job has nothing to do with this, I can speak freely. You know what I mean?

02:49:01.320 --> 02:49:11.320
If I say something like, you know, such and such sucks, I don't represent my company when I say that. But it's why I don't do a podcast on corporate training or something. You know what I mean?

02:49:11.320 --> 02:49:13.320
It's a big reason why I don't actually mention where I work.

02:49:13.320 --> 02:49:14.320
Sure. I understand.

02:49:14.320 --> 02:49:18.320
Other than that, I call it low cat and you guys have to deal with that.

02:49:18.320 --> 02:49:29.320
Here's what makes OLR matter to me. Rob's adoration for games and his energy. Jamie's dry but warm random nature. Okay. Thank you. And Loki's glorious rants.

02:49:29.320 --> 02:49:36.320
The games news itself, I have often already heard or read. It's what you guys have to say about the news that interests me.

02:49:36.320 --> 02:49:46.320
Anyway, very quick plug, I started my podcast called Songwriter Select, where we give a songwriter's view on popular music and aim to inspire and inform musicians.

02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:57.320
The early feedback we were getting seems to be validating my view that people want a slant, a personal edge to the topics at hand, just like you guys do for video games.

02:49:57.320 --> 02:50:02.320
And musicians listening, do check us out. We actually have a few in our chat room right now.

02:50:02.320 --> 02:50:07.320
I do not mind a cheap plug at all, especially when you're going to be so kind to say as we played a part in the inspiration of that.

02:50:07.320 --> 02:50:14.320
I think that is truly the best compliment somebody can give this show, is that your show inspired me to start my own show.

02:50:14.320 --> 02:50:15.320
Happy for the plug.

02:50:15.320 --> 02:50:16.320
Yeah, happy to be here.

02:50:16.320 --> 02:50:22.320
That all said, I am of course a big gamer. Thanks to Rob for replying to my tweet earlier this week about Rock Band 4.

02:50:22.320 --> 02:50:25.320
Please do keep OLR updated with your views on the game.

02:50:25.320 --> 02:50:37.320
I have been on the Rock Band wagon since Rock Band 1. I really really want the disc imports to be confirmed before I jump on Rock Band 4.

02:50:37.320 --> 02:50:40.320
I think our writer here is from the UK.

02:50:40.320 --> 02:50:44.320
Yes, it's the tweet I was thinking of earlier this week.

02:50:44.320 --> 02:50:46.320
Two quick Rock Band questions.

02:50:46.320 --> 02:50:56.320
One, how is the frame rate? In Rock Band 2 and 3, when playing as a band, it chugged a fair bit, which is annoying as a smooth note chart helps me concentrate.

02:50:56.320 --> 02:51:01.320
I, going to be honest, haven't played the full band yet, but remember they removed some instruments in Rock Band 4.

02:51:01.320 --> 02:51:06.320
So you won't have the same band that you had in Rock Band 3, because there's no keyboards now.

02:51:06.320 --> 02:51:09.320
Maybe we should stream some stuff. I'll sing live.

02:51:09.320 --> 02:51:14.320
Well, that's quite the offer. I don't have a freaking microphone, but maybe I can get one.

02:51:14.320 --> 02:51:15.320
Do you?

02:51:15.320 --> 02:51:17.320
I think I might have the ones that'll work.

02:51:17.320 --> 02:51:20.320
Yeah, I'll have to see if it'll work, but if it does, yeah, heck yeah.

02:51:20.320 --> 02:51:22.320
Actually, no, ours might be Xbox.

02:51:22.320 --> 02:51:24.320
Anyway, but we'll figure that out.

02:51:24.320 --> 02:51:29.320
But, yeah, as far as the frame rate goes, it's smooth for me.

02:51:29.320 --> 02:51:36.320
I also have a high refresh rate TV, and we are on the next gen system, so I would hope that's not an issue, but I haven't noticed any problems there.

02:51:36.320 --> 02:51:44.320
Two, I have read about vocals being scored differently in Rock Band 4, so long as you are in key and on a note from the chord, you aren't marked down.

02:51:44.320 --> 02:51:48.320
If this works, this is music to my ears. Again, bad pun, sorry.

02:51:48.320 --> 02:52:00.320
Often with bands like Queen, which I have all the DLC for, bless you forever, the harmonies and the melodies are at the same level in the audio mix, so it's hard to know which is which.

02:52:00.320 --> 02:52:06.320
When singing, I would be scored low for singing the wrong vocal line, even though it was perfectly in key.

02:52:06.320 --> 02:52:08.320
Any reports on this first hand?

02:52:08.320 --> 02:52:13.320
I have not first hand, but I've heard second hand that what you're saying is correct.

02:52:14.320 --> 02:52:16.320
That it would still be that way?

02:52:16.320 --> 02:52:22.320
By the way, the only reason I don't have Queen songs in Rock Band is because I have Sing Star Queen, just saying.

02:52:22.320 --> 02:52:25.320
Because then you get the music videos, too.

02:52:25.320 --> 02:52:30.320
But, yeah, as far as I know, that is the case, is what I'm hearing, too.

02:52:30.320 --> 02:52:33.320
I don't know if anybody in chat has insight on that as well.

02:52:33.320 --> 02:52:34.320
Ready for the end?

02:52:34.320 --> 02:52:35.320
Yeah.

02:52:35.320 --> 02:52:39.320
Anyway, sorry for the longish email, I tried to be concise, you were fine.

02:52:39.320 --> 02:52:42.320
And blessed wonderful grammar.

02:52:42.320 --> 02:52:47.320
Much love and thanks for the podcast, which I download here each Monday.

02:52:47.320 --> 02:52:52.320
I will listen live one day, but being in England, that is some crazy late night antics right there.

02:52:52.320 --> 02:52:54.320
And it comes from James Nighthawk.

02:52:54.320 --> 02:52:57.320
Well, we do a couple times a year try to do the show at noon.

02:52:57.320 --> 02:53:01.320
And usually it's because we have some other type of commitment, like the last time was what?

02:53:01.320 --> 02:53:03.320
We were going to San Francisco, that was when Victoria moved away, right?

02:53:03.320 --> 02:53:04.320
It was.

02:53:04.320 --> 02:53:06.320
And then we ate chicken hearts.

02:53:06.320 --> 02:53:08.320
Right, we did a show at noon, so we get to San Francisco in time.

02:53:08.320 --> 02:53:17.320
So sometimes, and we'll call that our UK show, because it would be timed to be only 8 o'clock at night over in the UK as opposed to, what time is it on in the UK now?

02:53:17.320 --> 02:53:19.320
It's 8 hours later than us.

02:53:19.320 --> 02:53:21.320
So it's 2am in the morning is when it starts.

02:53:21.320 --> 02:53:24.320
So unfortunately it's just, you know, time zones kind of suck.

02:53:24.320 --> 02:53:26.320
But that's why we love the podcast.

02:53:26.320 --> 02:53:28.320
Time zones are shite.

02:53:28.320 --> 02:53:30.320
They're total shite.

02:53:30.320 --> 02:53:32.320
Thank you, thank you for the email.

02:53:32.320 --> 02:53:35.320
And long emails are perfectly fine, especially from first time emailers.

02:53:36.320 --> 02:53:38.320
So, thank you. That's it.

02:53:38.320 --> 02:53:40.320
You get one pass.

02:53:40.320 --> 02:53:44.320
Participate at Orangeloungeradio.com.

02:53:44.320 --> 02:53:47.320
Akuma JP in chat says no UK show.

02:53:47.320 --> 02:53:50.320
Akuma JP doesn't like the UK shows because he's in Japan.

02:53:50.320 --> 02:53:53.320
So when we do the noon shows, that's like 2 in the morning for him.

02:53:53.320 --> 02:53:55.320
But it's like lunchtime for him right now or something.

02:53:55.320 --> 02:53:56.320
Yeah, it is.

02:53:56.320 --> 02:53:58.320
So maybe we need to do the Jcast.

02:53:58.320 --> 02:53:59.320
Yeah, maybe.

02:53:59.320 --> 02:54:02.320
God, then we'd have to be up till 2 in the morning to do the Jcast.

02:54:02.320 --> 02:54:04.320
We'll do it Saturday, Sunday morning.

02:54:04.320 --> 02:54:05.320
You know what?

02:54:05.320 --> 02:54:07.320
We do it playing global.

02:54:07.320 --> 02:54:09.320
We're just going to do the 24 hour show.

02:54:09.320 --> 02:54:13.320
We have to one up our marathon show and do a complete start to finish 24 hour show.

02:54:13.320 --> 02:54:15.320
What do you say, Loki?

02:54:15.320 --> 02:54:18.320
I'd be fine with it, but my wife wouldn't.

02:54:18.320 --> 02:54:20.320
Nelly should be on the show too.

02:54:20.320 --> 02:54:21.320
We'll do it at your house.

02:54:21.320 --> 02:54:22.320
Yeah, they'll never have that.

02:54:22.320 --> 02:54:23.320
Alright.

02:54:23.320 --> 02:54:26.320
Let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:54:26.320 --> 02:54:29.320
It is about that time to get a little bit angsty.

02:54:32.320 --> 02:54:52.320
FU to just certain issues and night terrors.

02:54:52.320 --> 02:54:53.320
Alright.

02:54:53.320 --> 02:54:58.320
Loki, let's see how vague I can be about this.

02:54:58.320 --> 02:55:07.320
FU to situations in my life that would cause a therapist to basically summarize, say, you're

02:55:07.320 --> 02:55:10.320
fucked.

02:55:10.320 --> 02:55:12.320
Okay.

02:55:12.320 --> 02:55:13.320
My view of the week.

02:55:13.320 --> 02:55:14.320
You know what?

02:55:14.320 --> 02:55:16.320
I had a pretty damn good weekend.

02:55:16.320 --> 02:55:18.320
It's hard for me to be upset about anything.

02:55:18.320 --> 02:55:20.320
FU to the fact that, oh, I know.

02:55:20.320 --> 02:55:24.320
FU to the fact that I was really going to try and do some live streams last week and

02:55:24.320 --> 02:55:27.320
then I went out and did shit like every single night last week.

02:55:27.320 --> 02:55:28.320
So this week I got to work.

02:55:28.320 --> 02:55:32.320
And FU to the fact that I've let my living room become a total disaster and I need to

02:55:32.320 --> 02:55:33.320
clean this week.

02:55:33.320 --> 02:55:34.320
I'm going to do that too.

02:55:34.320 --> 02:55:35.320
So FU to cleaning.

02:55:35.320 --> 02:55:36.320
Flaco.

02:55:36.320 --> 02:55:41.320
FU not playing enough Splatoon this week and their ranking system is so hard.

02:55:41.320 --> 02:55:42.320
It's so mean.

02:55:42.320 --> 02:55:45.320
But I love it still.

02:55:45.320 --> 02:55:46.320
Alright.

02:55:46.320 --> 02:55:48.320
And Shane Alinko.

02:55:48.320 --> 02:55:54.320
FU to the, oh, to insomnia and how hot it is in here right now.

02:55:54.320 --> 02:55:56.320
I turned on the AC.

02:55:56.320 --> 02:55:57.320
What more do you want?

02:55:57.320 --> 02:56:00.320
Turn on three ACs.

02:56:00.320 --> 02:56:04.320
I will turn on all the ACs just for you.

02:56:04.320 --> 02:56:05.320
Alright.

02:56:05.320 --> 02:56:07.320
FU to Shane.

02:56:07.320 --> 02:56:08.320
He's never happy.

02:56:08.320 --> 02:56:11.320
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys and then we're going to quickly open

02:56:11.320 --> 02:56:12.320
up the Skyline.

02:56:12.320 --> 02:56:16.320
We're already after nine o'clock so I am going to only have it open for a little bit.

02:56:16.320 --> 02:56:18.320
So let's go over to Loki next.

02:56:18.320 --> 02:56:25.320
So Valve is apparently removing some Steam games off of their service that are Linux

02:56:25.320 --> 02:56:29.320
titles that don't support SteamOS.

02:56:29.320 --> 02:56:33.320
And apparently these are being pulled because they're not meeting the standards or they're

02:56:33.320 --> 02:56:35.320
incompatible with the system.

02:56:35.320 --> 02:56:40.320
And so you would need to fix that if that's the case.

02:56:40.320 --> 02:56:44.320
The games are no longer available for purchase but if you do own the game you can still download

02:56:44.320 --> 02:56:46.320
and play it.

02:56:46.320 --> 02:56:49.320
And I guess they were saying one of the games affected by it was Star Made and it was removed

02:56:49.320 --> 02:56:53.320
due to a Java requirement.

02:56:53.320 --> 02:56:56.320
So that kind of sucks.

02:56:56.320 --> 02:57:00.320
So they're not just removing it because they're mad that the games, you know, don't work on

02:57:00.320 --> 02:57:01.320
them.

02:57:01.320 --> 02:57:09.320
Yeah, basically they don't want a game advertised as having SteamOS support if it has an outside

02:57:09.320 --> 02:57:17.320
launcher, installer, flash, anything else that's required to run the game.

02:57:17.320 --> 02:57:18.320
Alright.

02:57:18.320 --> 02:57:25.320
Well lastly tonight, this could be interesting, a Wii U emulator has been released for Windows

02:57:25.320 --> 02:57:26.320
10.

02:57:26.320 --> 02:57:29.320
That's right, you can now emulate the Wii U on Windows 10.

02:57:29.320 --> 02:57:31.320
Nintendo is not going to like that.

02:57:31.320 --> 02:57:33.320
It's called Cemu?

02:57:33.320 --> 02:57:35.320
I don't know if that's how you pronounce it.

02:57:35.320 --> 02:57:36.320
Cemu?

02:57:36.320 --> 02:57:37.320
I don't know.

02:57:37.320 --> 02:57:38.320
Cemu?

02:57:38.320 --> 02:57:39.320
Wii U?

02:57:39.320 --> 02:57:40.320
Cemu?

02:57:40.320 --> 02:57:41.320
Ceman?

02:57:41.320 --> 02:57:42.320
I don't know.

02:57:42.320 --> 02:57:50.320
It has Wii U titles at a resolution of 1920x1080, but it's still very much a work in progress.

02:57:50.320 --> 02:57:56.320
There's no audio, some games crash, but some games like NES Remix actually run.

02:57:56.320 --> 02:58:00.320
But then other games like Super Mario 3D World don't work so well.

02:58:00.320 --> 02:58:04.320
And as you can understand, Nintendo's going to be a little bit pissed off about this because

02:58:04.320 --> 02:58:09.320
the Wii U is kind of current hardware and if an emulator comes out it's just going to

02:58:09.320 --> 02:58:13.320
you know, probably drive more piracy and so on, so that's not going to end up being a

02:58:13.320 --> 02:58:14.320
healthy thing.

02:58:14.320 --> 02:58:20.320
So, I could see that Nintendo's going to try real hard to shut this one down, but the question

02:58:20.320 --> 02:58:22.320
will be, legally, can they?

02:58:22.320 --> 02:58:27.320
I mean, at least when the NES and Super Nintendo emulators came out, it was kind of a while

02:58:27.320 --> 02:58:29.320
after those consoles had sunsetted.

02:58:29.320 --> 02:58:32.320
You know, even though there is the Virtual Console and so forth.

02:58:32.320 --> 02:58:35.320
This one for a current system, I don't know.

02:58:35.320 --> 02:58:36.320
We'll see.

02:58:36.320 --> 02:58:37.320
Alright.

02:58:37.320 --> 02:58:43.320
Anyhow, we are going to open up the Skype line 1-877-GAME-OLR or our user name on Skype,

02:58:43.320 --> 02:58:45.320
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:58:45.320 --> 02:58:46.320
But you know what?

02:58:46.320 --> 02:58:50.320
I think it's about time we check in with our list list segment.

02:58:50.320 --> 02:58:52.320
Let's quickly get to this list list tonight.

02:58:54.320 --> 02:58:58.320
I'm going to be honest, a lot of ties across the board because there weren't a lot of votes tonight.

02:58:58.320 --> 02:59:00.320
Where are our listeners?

02:59:00.320 --> 02:59:02.320
I'm sad.

02:59:02.320 --> 02:59:05.320
I was going to beg them all to vote in my movie poll article.

02:59:05.320 --> 02:59:07.320
Alright, well, you still should.

02:59:07.320 --> 02:59:12.320
While you're logged in, voting for this, go rank the movies in my latest Fall Movie Preview.

02:59:12.320 --> 02:59:13.320
Thank you.

02:59:13.320 --> 02:59:15.320
Alright, well, you know what?

02:59:15.320 --> 02:59:19.320
It's the show where every gamer has a voice, but only when you use them.

02:59:19.320 --> 02:59:20.320
So here it is.

02:59:20.320 --> 02:59:23.320
Your top three as determined by the listeners.

02:59:23.320 --> 02:59:26.320
The worst NES game they ever made.

02:59:26.320 --> 02:59:27.320
We have two ties.

02:59:27.320 --> 02:59:30.320
So for number three, we have a tie.

02:59:30.320 --> 02:59:33.320
Back to the Future 2 and 3.

02:59:33.320 --> 02:59:37.320
And Cheetahmen 2 for the worst NES game they ever made.

02:59:37.320 --> 02:59:38.320
That's like a freeway tie.

02:59:38.320 --> 02:59:39.320
I know, right?

02:59:39.320 --> 02:59:43.320
And at number two, we also have a tie.

02:59:43.320 --> 02:59:48.320
Tied for the number two worst game they ever did make.

02:59:48.320 --> 02:59:53.320
Bart vs. the Space Mutants and Barbie.

02:59:54.320 --> 03:00:00.320
But the number one, according to the chatters and our listeners, and this is it,

03:00:00.320 --> 03:00:05.320
this is the worst NES game they ever made.

03:00:05.320 --> 03:00:07.320
Bible Adventures.

03:00:07.320 --> 03:00:09.320
Yes!

03:00:09.320 --> 03:00:12.320
Bible Adventures is the worst.

03:00:12.320 --> 03:00:15.320
I didn't even get a single damn answer on the list there.

03:00:15.320 --> 03:00:19.320
With all those ties, I thought, oh, there's no way none of mine are getting up there.

03:00:20.320 --> 03:00:21.320
I'm just surprised.

03:00:21.320 --> 03:00:23.320
Anyone actually knew Cheetahmen enough to vote for it?

03:00:23.320 --> 03:00:24.320
There you go.

03:00:24.320 --> 03:00:26.320
Apparently somebody else suffered through it.

03:00:26.320 --> 03:00:28.320
I think games done quick for exposure.

03:00:28.320 --> 03:00:29.320
All right, so there it was.

03:00:29.320 --> 03:00:30.320
The list.

03:00:30.320 --> 03:00:33.320
Thank you guys that participated in that tonight.

03:00:33.320 --> 03:00:34.320
Appreciate it.

03:00:34.320 --> 03:00:35.320
All right.

03:00:35.320 --> 03:00:37.320
I think actually, too, what happened is the votes were really spread out.

03:00:37.320 --> 03:00:40.320
I think a lot of the people that did vote were all voting for different things.

03:00:40.320 --> 03:00:41.320
So...

03:00:41.320 --> 03:00:43.320
Don't downgrade my victory, Rob.

03:00:43.320 --> 03:00:44.320
That kind of played...

03:00:44.320 --> 03:00:45.320
No, I...

03:00:45.320 --> 03:00:47.320
I think Bible...

03:00:47.320 --> 03:00:49.320
Yeah, if they were still spread out, how come you didn't get any?

03:00:49.320 --> 03:00:50.320
Ah, fuck off.

03:00:50.320 --> 03:00:51.320
All right.

03:00:51.320 --> 03:00:54.320
I honestly thought Barbie would be number one, but...

03:00:54.320 --> 03:00:55.320
I thought so, too.

03:00:55.320 --> 03:00:57.320
Bible Adventures in the top three doesn't spread out at all.

03:00:57.320 --> 03:00:58.320
I thought X-Men would be up there, too.

03:00:58.320 --> 03:00:59.320
Yeah, yeah.

03:00:59.320 --> 03:01:00.320
All right, let's get to...

03:01:00.320 --> 03:01:02.320
Will somebody eliminate a duck hunt?

03:01:02.320 --> 03:01:03.320
That would have won it.

03:01:03.320 --> 03:01:04.320
All right.

03:01:04.320 --> 03:01:05.320
Nope.

03:01:05.320 --> 03:01:07.320
1877 Game O-L-R, username on Skype.

03:01:07.320 --> 03:01:08.320
Orange Lounge Radio.

03:01:08.320 --> 03:01:10.320
Now I'm looking at it, and it's open.

03:01:10.320 --> 03:01:12.320
Sorry, I want to make sure we got the list out there, though.

03:01:12.320 --> 03:01:13.320
So, hey, we got a call coming in.

03:01:13.320 --> 03:01:14.320
Let's get to it.

03:01:14.320 --> 03:01:15.320
Hi, on Orange Lounge Radio.

03:01:15.320 --> 03:01:16.320
Who's this?

03:01:16.320 --> 03:01:17.320
Hey, this is Akdeft.

03:01:17.320 --> 03:01:18.320
Yeah, hey, Akdeft.

03:01:18.320 --> 03:01:19.320
How you doing?

03:01:19.320 --> 03:01:22.320
Pretty fine, pretty fine, actually.

03:01:22.320 --> 03:01:23.320
What's on your mind?

03:01:23.320 --> 03:01:24.320
Really great.

03:01:24.320 --> 03:01:25.320
I'm sorry?

03:01:25.320 --> 03:01:26.320
All right.

03:01:26.320 --> 03:01:27.320
Go ahead.

03:01:27.320 --> 03:01:28.320
Oh.

03:01:28.320 --> 03:01:34.320
Like I say, I was saying, I'm really feeling like...

03:01:34.320 --> 03:01:35.320
Sorry.

03:01:35.320 --> 03:01:38.320
Really great right now.

03:01:38.320 --> 03:01:39.320
Do you...

03:01:39.320 --> 03:01:40.320
Sorry.

03:01:40.320 --> 03:01:45.320
You do remember the Dance Fighting Hertz in the Go campaign, right?

03:01:46.320 --> 03:01:47.320
Yes.

03:01:47.320 --> 03:01:48.320
Did it make it?

03:01:48.320 --> 03:01:49.320
Yeah, actually.

03:01:49.320 --> 03:01:53.320
Even last week, it was really, really far from its goal.

03:01:53.320 --> 03:02:06.320
It had at least like over 100,000 still to get funded, and this week was really amazing

03:02:06.320 --> 03:02:13.320
because every day it was going up like 20,000 a day or 25,000.

03:02:13.320 --> 03:02:26.320
So, earlier today, they got to their goal of 436,000 thousand dollars.

03:02:26.320 --> 03:02:35.320
So, right now, they're at 450,000 or 51,000 actually.

03:02:35.320 --> 03:02:36.320
So, wait.

03:02:36.320 --> 03:02:37.320
They're 9,000 short?

03:02:37.320 --> 03:02:38.320
No, no, no.

03:02:38.320 --> 03:02:39.320
They actually...

03:02:39.320 --> 03:02:40.320
Sorry.

03:02:41.320 --> 03:02:42.320
Sorry.

03:02:42.320 --> 03:02:44.320
I'm getting really started.

03:02:44.320 --> 03:02:45.320
Sorry.

03:02:45.320 --> 03:02:46.320
Sorry.

03:02:46.320 --> 03:02:47.320
Yeah.

03:02:47.320 --> 03:02:48.320
Okay.

03:02:48.320 --> 03:02:55.320
They're right now at 450,000 K. Yeah.

03:02:55.320 --> 03:03:01.320
So, they actually got or they surpassed their goal.

03:03:01.320 --> 03:03:04.320
That was 436,000.

03:03:04.320 --> 03:03:05.320
Oh, 436.

03:03:05.320 --> 03:03:06.320
I thought for some reason...

03:03:06.320 --> 03:03:07.320
I guess I just misheard the number.

03:03:07.320 --> 03:03:08.320
Okay.

03:03:08.320 --> 03:03:09.320
So, they did make it after all.

03:03:09.320 --> 03:03:13.320
That's the thing with the crowdfunding campaigns that usually the most money is made at the

03:03:13.320 --> 03:03:15.320
very beginning and the very end.

03:03:15.320 --> 03:03:21.320
Very little of it is made in the middle unless you have some huge presence, a huge interview

03:03:21.320 --> 03:03:25.320
or some exposure breaks through or something really kind of pushes that campaign a little

03:03:25.320 --> 03:03:27.320
bit in the middle.

03:03:27.320 --> 03:03:29.320
So, yeah.

03:03:29.320 --> 03:03:31.320
I'm glad though that everybody rallied at the end.

03:03:31.320 --> 03:03:34.320
I think a lot of times too what happens towards the end is that everybody's like,

03:03:34.320 --> 03:03:37.320
oh shit, this is my last chance to help the game out.

03:03:37.320 --> 03:03:39.320
Procrastinators, right?

03:03:39.320 --> 03:03:40.320
Yeah, basically.

03:03:40.320 --> 03:03:41.320
They think so.

03:03:41.320 --> 03:03:44.320
Most people want it right now, but at the same time, I can procrastinate.

03:03:44.320 --> 03:03:46.320
I'll wait till the last possible minute and then I'll do it.

03:03:46.320 --> 03:03:47.320
Right?

03:03:47.320 --> 03:03:49.320
And there's still three days to go.

03:03:49.320 --> 03:03:53.320
So, hopefully they get some of their stretch goals.

03:03:53.320 --> 03:03:54.320
Yeah.

03:03:54.320 --> 03:04:02.320
They're pretty much like 25,000 for Mac and Linux versions.

03:04:02.320 --> 03:04:12.320
Though, if they get 546,000, they'll make another character, a new character for the

03:04:12.320 --> 03:04:13.320
game.

03:04:13.320 --> 03:04:15.320
So, hopefully they'll make it though.

03:04:15.320 --> 03:04:17.320
It seems like kind of far fetched right now.

03:04:17.320 --> 03:04:18.320
Yeah.

03:04:18.320 --> 03:04:20.320
With a few days to go, you're going to have a lot of people to jump in there right at

03:04:20.320 --> 03:04:24.320
the end to make sure they get their copy of the game and help things move along and get

03:04:24.320 --> 03:04:25.320
to the stretch goals.

03:04:25.320 --> 03:04:31.320
So, I feel like there's a good chance at depth, but happy to hear they made their goal.

03:04:31.320 --> 03:04:34.320
So, them fighting herds coming out soon, right?

03:04:34.320 --> 03:04:35.320
Yeah.

03:04:35.320 --> 03:04:39.320
Coming out for Steam and hopefully in 2017, I think.

03:04:39.320 --> 03:04:40.320
Yeah.

03:04:40.320 --> 03:04:41.320
But, yeah.

03:04:41.320 --> 03:04:51.320
Hopefully, again, this game will not only be popular among My Little Pony fans, but

03:04:51.320 --> 03:04:55.320
hopefully for all fighting games fans in general.

03:04:55.320 --> 03:04:59.320
Well, it sounds like, too, if you like Skullgirls, there'll probably be a lot here for you because

03:04:59.320 --> 03:05:00.320
it's the same engine, right?

03:05:00.320 --> 03:05:01.320
Yeah.

03:05:01.320 --> 03:05:02.320
Yeah.

03:05:02.320 --> 03:05:03.320
So, there'll be other stuff there for fighting game fans.

03:05:03.320 --> 03:05:08.320
Now, we just have to have it show up at EVO.

03:05:08.320 --> 03:05:14.320
Actually, the original game, Fighting is Magic, was going to make it at EVO, I think, last

03:05:14.320 --> 03:05:15.320
year.

03:05:15.320 --> 03:05:16.320
Really?

03:05:16.320 --> 03:05:17.320
Yeah.

03:05:17.320 --> 03:05:21.320
Remember they had that poll, that fun donation poll?

03:05:21.320 --> 03:05:22.320
Oh, that's right.

03:05:22.320 --> 03:05:24.320
Yes, I do remember that.

03:05:24.320 --> 03:05:28.320
Yeah, that's when Melee got into EVO last year.

03:05:28.320 --> 03:05:35.320
Actually, Fighting is Magic had the first place, but Mane6 said they couldn't have a

03:05:35.320 --> 03:05:42.320
final build of the game made for EVO, so they dropped out of the donation drive.

03:05:42.320 --> 03:05:43.320
Got it.

03:05:43.320 --> 03:05:44.320
Got it.

03:05:44.320 --> 03:05:45.320
All right.

03:05:45.320 --> 03:05:46.320
Makes sense.

03:05:46.320 --> 03:05:49.320
Well, Act F, anything else you want to share with the listeners tonight?

03:05:49.320 --> 03:05:50.320
Not really.

03:05:50.320 --> 03:05:52.320
That's all for tonight, I think.

03:05:52.320 --> 03:05:53.320
Nope.

03:05:53.320 --> 03:05:54.320
I appreciate it.

03:05:54.320 --> 03:05:55.320
All right.

03:05:55.320 --> 03:05:56.320
You take care, buddy.

03:05:56.320 --> 03:05:57.320
Hey, take care, too.

03:05:57.320 --> 03:05:59.320
Thanks for having me.

03:05:59.320 --> 03:06:00.320
Bye.

03:06:00.320 --> 03:06:04.320
I would have asked Act F about Ines's memory, but you know he's going to say something about

03:06:04.320 --> 03:06:05.320
Kirby.

03:06:05.320 --> 03:06:06.320
I can just answer that for him.

03:06:06.320 --> 03:06:09.320
He actually did answer the question over on our Fugu Question of the Week as well.

03:06:09.320 --> 03:06:10.320
All right.

03:06:10.320 --> 03:06:15.320
Do you have any last minute stories, Loki?

03:06:15.320 --> 03:06:17.320
Wait to see if any other calls come in.

03:06:17.320 --> 03:06:19.320
1877 game OLR, username on Skype, Orange on Trio.

03:06:19.320 --> 03:06:22.320
Did you guys talk about Allison Road canceling their Kickstarter and going-

03:06:22.320 --> 03:06:23.320
You know what?

03:06:23.320 --> 03:06:24.320
No, I don't think that came up.

03:06:24.320 --> 03:06:26.320
Did you want to- I did remember reading about this, though.

03:06:26.320 --> 03:06:29.320
I don't have it in front of me, but I know they got picked up by the people who make

03:06:29.320 --> 03:06:30.320
the Worms game, I think?

03:06:30.320 --> 03:06:31.320
Yeah, Team 17.

03:06:31.320 --> 03:06:32.320
Yeah, Team 17.

03:06:32.320 --> 03:06:33.320
So they got picked up by them.

03:06:33.320 --> 03:06:35.320
It didn't look like they were going to make their Kickstarter.

03:06:35.320 --> 03:06:36.320
No.

03:06:36.320 --> 03:06:38.320
It looked like they were pretty far off from it.

03:06:38.320 --> 03:06:42.320
I don't know how much time they had left, but it is hard to tell because it's in British

03:06:42.320 --> 03:06:43.320
Pounds, I think.

03:06:43.320 --> 03:06:44.320
Yeah, yeah.

03:06:44.320 --> 03:06:48.320
I don't know if that was part of the problem, but yeah, they weren't going to make their

03:06:48.320 --> 03:06:51.320
Kickstarter, but now they're getting in front of the more traditional route because they

03:06:51.320 --> 03:06:54.320
have a studio behind it, which they said is good for them.

03:06:54.320 --> 03:06:55.320
Well, trying to-

03:06:55.320 --> 03:06:59.320
You got to spin it in a nice way when you fail your Kickstarter, right?

03:06:59.320 --> 03:07:04.320
But, to be fair, with all due respect to the makers of Allison Road, I think what had a

03:07:04.320 --> 03:07:10.320
lot of people excited about PT was the involvement of Guillermo del Toro and Hideo Kojima, so

03:07:10.320 --> 03:07:12.320
it's kind of like you're trying to-

03:07:12.320 --> 03:07:13.320
Piggyback on that?

03:07:13.320 --> 03:07:17.320
You're kind of trying to piggyback on a game that everybody's pissed off is not happening,

03:07:17.320 --> 03:07:20.320
so I think that was always going to be an uphill battle of sorts.

03:07:20.320 --> 03:07:24.320
Well, hopefully with Team17's backing, I mean, hopefully they see the talent in that

03:07:24.320 --> 03:07:27.320
little demo, because I think a lot of people did see that Allison Road demo and went, wow,

03:07:27.320 --> 03:07:29.320
this is pretty cool.

03:07:29.320 --> 03:07:34.320
So, hopefully Team17 can give them the more traditional backing they need to make the

03:07:34.320 --> 03:07:37.320
game they envision, and then they can make a killing on the sales.

03:07:37.320 --> 03:07:39.320
See what I did there?

03:07:39.320 --> 03:07:41.320
A killing on the sales.

03:07:41.320 --> 03:07:42.320
All right.

03:07:42.320 --> 03:07:44.320
But we have no idea when the game's coming out, right?

03:07:44.320 --> 03:07:45.320
Not even October 2016.

03:07:45.320 --> 03:07:47.320
I would imagine it'd be so far away.

03:07:47.320 --> 03:07:52.320
I think starters alone take two years, and maybe go in the traditional route, would that

03:07:52.320 --> 03:07:54.320
make it faster or longer?

03:07:54.320 --> 03:07:55.320
I don't know.

03:07:55.320 --> 03:07:56.320
Probably the same.

03:07:56.320 --> 03:08:00.320
The only new stuff that I saw this week that I watched a video on was that trans-pacific

03:08:00.320 --> 03:08:07.320
partnership thing, that secret thing that they're drafting up of a guest that's basically

03:08:07.320 --> 03:08:14.320
going to fuck over everybody as far as consumer rights and copyright and fair use and all that.

03:08:14.320 --> 03:08:16.320
I do remember reading about this vaguely.

03:08:16.320 --> 03:08:19.320
Let me come back to this real quick, because we do have another call coming in, but I want

03:08:19.320 --> 03:08:20.320
to revisit that topic in just a minute.

03:08:20.320 --> 03:08:21.320
But let me get to the phone.

03:08:21.320 --> 03:08:22.320
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

03:08:22.320 --> 03:08:23.320
Who's this?

03:08:23.320 --> 03:08:24.320
Hey, everybody.

03:08:24.320 --> 03:08:25.320
It's Rama.

03:08:25.320 --> 03:08:26.320
Hey, Rama.

03:08:26.320 --> 03:08:27.320
Thanks for the interview.

03:08:27.320 --> 03:08:28.320
Hey, no problem.

03:08:28.320 --> 03:08:29.320
Anything for you guys.

03:08:29.320 --> 03:08:30.320
Aw, I was actually sorry.

03:08:30.320 --> 03:08:33.320
I texted you, and I'm like, you're not keeping this for yourself?

03:08:33.320 --> 03:08:39.320
Well, you know, I try to, you know, whenever I get the opportunity to interview voice actors

03:08:39.320 --> 03:08:41.320
who have done a lot of gaming stuff.

03:08:41.320 --> 03:08:42.320
Yeah.

03:08:42.320 --> 03:08:48.320
I'll do an audio copy of the interview and hook you guys up, because it's going to be

03:08:48.320 --> 03:08:51.320
a while before we put the video interview up on our YouTube page.

03:08:51.320 --> 03:08:52.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:08:52.320 --> 03:08:53.320
No, I appreciate it.

03:08:53.320 --> 03:08:54.320
I definitely appreciate it.

03:08:54.320 --> 03:08:55.320
Yeah.

03:08:55.320 --> 03:08:56.320
So what's on your mind?

03:08:56.320 --> 03:09:00.320
I was actually thinking about the hardest Nintendo game I've ever played by Refleak.

03:09:00.320 --> 03:09:04.320
Can't think of any, because most of the time it was a couple of Super Nintendo games.

03:09:04.320 --> 03:09:07.320
I just found myself throwing the controllers left and right.

03:09:07.320 --> 03:09:11.320
But my thing is about the whole Nintendo NX.

03:09:11.320 --> 03:09:17.320
The way they're talking reminds me of the TurboGrafx-16 and the Turbo Express Portable.

03:09:17.320 --> 03:09:18.320
Interesting.

03:09:18.320 --> 03:09:24.320
Where the Portable played the exact same games from the exact same cards as the 16, huh?

03:09:24.320 --> 03:09:25.320
Yeah.

03:09:25.320 --> 03:09:26.320
That's a good point.

03:09:26.320 --> 03:09:28.320
I hope the screen's bigger.

03:09:28.320 --> 03:09:29.320
It should be.

03:09:29.320 --> 03:09:30.320
It should be.

03:09:30.320 --> 03:09:31.320
Oh, no, no, no.

03:09:31.320 --> 03:09:38.320
There's nothing quite as hard on your eyes as playing the Portable, the Turbo Express.

03:09:38.320 --> 03:09:41.320
I think there's still so many unknown factors, though.

03:09:41.320 --> 03:09:43.320
Let's say it is a portable system and a console.

03:09:43.320 --> 03:09:46.320
Does that mean that the games they make are going to be different?

03:09:46.320 --> 03:09:50.320
Because when you play at home, would it be a dual-screen experience?

03:09:50.320 --> 03:09:53.320
Whereas when you're on the go, it's a one-screen experience?

03:09:53.320 --> 03:09:56.320
There's so many questions about it that I still have.

03:09:56.320 --> 03:09:59.320
But again, this is all coming from the rumor mill anyway.

03:09:59.320 --> 03:10:02.320
So this could all be for nothing, you know?

03:10:02.320 --> 03:10:06.320
Yeah, because for a while they were saying it was going to be an Android-powered console.

03:10:06.320 --> 03:10:08.320
I'm like, pfft, that ain't gonna happen.

03:10:08.320 --> 03:10:09.320
No.

03:10:09.320 --> 03:10:13.320
I mean, I could see where maybe Nintendo would make it easier for that, but I don't know.

03:10:13.320 --> 03:10:14.320
Android-powered console?

03:10:14.320 --> 03:10:15.320
PAX console?

03:10:15.320 --> 03:10:16.320
Yep.

03:10:16.320 --> 03:10:17.320
Yeah.

03:10:17.320 --> 03:10:23.320
And I know when the NX comes out, everybody's going to want the backwards compatibility,

03:10:23.320 --> 03:10:28.320
and they're saying that it's going to be much more powerful than the Xbox One and the PS4.

03:10:28.320 --> 03:10:29.320
I'll just say this.

03:10:29.320 --> 03:10:31.320
If you notice, PS1...

03:10:31.320 --> 03:10:33.320
I mean, what am I saying?

03:10:33.320 --> 03:10:34.320
I'm sorry.

03:10:34.320 --> 03:10:35.320
I'm tired.

03:10:35.320 --> 03:10:41.320
The X64, Xbox One, they went X64 straight up PC processing.

03:10:41.320 --> 03:10:47.320
The way they built these consoles out, these consoles literally have a 10-year lifespan.

03:10:47.320 --> 03:10:56.320
So if the NX comes out, it's going to be a PC-based console where the parts can be pulled off the shelves.

03:10:56.320 --> 03:11:03.320
And I can see it being, if not powerful, just as powerful as the current next-gen consoles,

03:11:03.320 --> 03:11:07.320
because to be perfectly honest, when it comes to price point, you could actually go to New

03:11:07.320 --> 03:11:12.320
Egg or Micro Center and build a PC with the same specs as the One or the PS4.

03:11:12.320 --> 03:11:13.320
No, you can't.

03:11:13.320 --> 03:11:14.320
And it will run you about...

03:11:14.320 --> 03:11:22.320
You remember that the PS4 has all that GDDR4, was it, the graphics card memory in it.

03:11:22.320 --> 03:11:25.320
It runs a lot faster than your standard RAM.

03:11:25.320 --> 03:11:27.320
I mean, that's not something you can just pull off the shelf.

03:11:27.320 --> 03:11:34.320
Plus, I mean, the price points of those consoles are pretty high as it is, and Nintendo's going to want to keep a low price point.

03:11:34.320 --> 03:11:39.320
And if you're throwing in like a second screen device as well, it's just going to be pricey.

03:11:39.320 --> 03:11:42.320
That's why I think they may try to sell them separately.

03:11:42.320 --> 03:11:52.320
There may be like an NX brand for both, but that the handheld would be one $200 purchase, and then the console's another $200 purchase.

03:11:52.320 --> 03:11:59.320
So really, it's like $400 or even maybe $500 for the combo, but they're going to disguise it as two cheaper purchases.

03:11:59.320 --> 03:12:03.320
That could be a thing. I'm not saying it will be, but that could be how they do it.

03:12:03.320 --> 03:12:07.320
I can see that, because to be perfectly honest, one of the things that turned me off from getting a Wii U is the GamePad.

03:12:07.320 --> 03:12:11.320
I'm like, I don't mind the console, but I don't know if I want the GamePad.

03:12:11.320 --> 03:12:16.320
I mean, if I could play all the games without the GamePad, then why do I need it?

03:12:16.320 --> 03:12:21.320
Yeah, but some games it's like, you know, Splatoon is built with the GamePad.

03:12:21.320 --> 03:12:30.320
Whether we think it's that useful or not, you know, they would have to go back and make massive changes to the game to make it completely without the GamePad, and I just don't see that happening.

03:12:30.320 --> 03:12:33.320
Yeah, you're probably right about that.

03:12:33.320 --> 03:12:36.320
Except they do have a mode that runs off the GameChat, so you know.

03:12:36.320 --> 03:12:39.320
You could stick to a tablet or something for a secondary screen, you know?

03:12:39.320 --> 03:12:44.320
Yeah. Alright. Well, Rama, any other thoughts on your mind before we let you go?

03:12:44.320 --> 03:12:54.320
It's October. It's 40 degrees out. I am sitting here with my space heater under the desk. What the hell?

03:12:54.320 --> 03:13:00.320
It's hot in the studio. We have the light off in the studio and just the kitchen light on behind us. It's like really hot. I don't know if it's because there's five of us.

03:13:00.320 --> 03:13:02.320
It's 63 degrees. We could crack a window.

03:13:02.320 --> 03:13:08.320
I do have a window cracker. I mean, it's all the way over there, but here's the other thing. I didn't want to keep that window open because the sound traveled the neighbors.

03:13:08.320 --> 03:13:09.320
Because the evil dead outside?

03:13:09.320 --> 03:13:11.320
Yes, the evil dead and the neighbors.

03:13:11.320 --> 03:13:12.320
And the spiders.

03:13:12.320 --> 03:13:16.320
Alright. Anyway, I'm going to let you go, Rama. Thanks for calling.

03:13:16.320 --> 03:13:17.320
Hey, no problem, dude.

03:13:17.320 --> 03:13:18.320
Alright, take care.

03:13:18.320 --> 03:13:19.320
Alright, bye.

03:13:19.320 --> 03:13:23.320
Bye. Alright, there it is. That's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

03:13:23.320 --> 03:13:27.320
I wanted to quickly go back to what Loki was saying, though, before we wrap it up here tonight.

03:13:27.320 --> 03:13:30.320
Loki, you were talking about the whole partnership on the streaming?

03:13:30.320 --> 03:13:35.320
Yeah, basically it's a secret deal that's going on that only got leaked out by WikiLeaks.

03:13:35.320 --> 03:13:41.320
And that's the only way we found out about it. It's basically going to make, first off, those types of leaks legal.

03:13:41.320 --> 03:13:48.320
It's also going to make, if you infringe on copyright, and this could be anything from modding a game,

03:13:48.320 --> 03:13:54.320
you could be held criminally for that, including jail time and unlimited penalties as far as monetary.

03:13:54.320 --> 03:13:55.320
That's too much.

03:13:55.320 --> 03:14:03.320
They would increase the copyright to basically match what the US has, which is the life of the creator plus 70 years.

03:14:03.320 --> 03:14:09.320
It's just basically going to fuck everybody over. It's pretty much going to kill the modding scene.

03:14:09.320 --> 03:14:17.320
You can't circumvent DRM in any fashion that's illegal, even if you do it just on a personal level.

03:14:17.320 --> 03:14:18.320
That won't happen.

03:14:18.320 --> 03:14:28.320
It will happen because, think about it, this is being drafted by 151 companies, or 150-some companies, to serve themselves.

03:14:28.320 --> 03:14:33.320
And this is being done in secret, without the public knowledge, except it got leaked out.

03:14:33.320 --> 03:14:36.320
Remember SOPA? That's the exact same thing that happened with that whole thing.

03:14:36.320 --> 03:14:40.320
Once people got educated on it, they put their foot down.

03:14:40.320 --> 03:14:47.320
We'll see, but they're already on their final draft, apparently, of this, and so it just has to be ratified by these countries.

03:14:47.320 --> 03:14:48.320
Alright.

03:14:50.320 --> 03:14:54.320
Okay, I guess that's going to wrap it up here for another episode of Orange Andrea.

03:14:54.320 --> 03:14:59.320
We're almost like 9-20, so we're a little long tonight, and especially the podcast listeners are going to be like,

03:14:59.320 --> 03:15:03.320
wow, this is a super long show, because the interview and our usual break is actually a part of it.

03:15:03.320 --> 03:15:05.320
So, I do want to go ahead and wrap things up.

03:15:05.320 --> 03:15:09.320
Thank you guys for sticking with us for an extra long edition of Orange Lounge Radio.

03:15:09.320 --> 03:15:14.320
Hey, if you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please tell a friend or two, or 17, about the show.

03:15:14.320 --> 03:15:17.320
Help us spread the word, because, you know, as we've joked about earlier in the show,

03:15:17.320 --> 03:15:22.320
we don't have the backing of the BBC or IGN or one of those big companies,

03:15:22.320 --> 03:15:26.320
so we could definitely use word-of-mouth support and tell a friend.

03:15:26.320 --> 03:15:30.320
And that's, yeah, that's the best thing you could do for our show.

03:15:30.320 --> 03:15:32.320
Really would appreciate it and help out.

03:15:32.320 --> 03:15:35.320
Well, five-star review on iTunes or Stitcher Radio or wherever you found this show.

03:15:35.320 --> 03:15:37.320
That goes a long, long way as well.

03:15:37.320 --> 03:15:40.320
You know, if we were sponsored by CNN, they'd just tell us to lie to everyone.

03:15:42.320 --> 03:15:46.320
All right, let's go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

03:15:46.320 --> 03:15:48.320
First off, I want to thank our guests for being here.

03:15:48.320 --> 03:15:50.320
Flaco Jones, thank you for being here tonight.

03:15:50.320 --> 03:15:51.320
You're welcome.

03:15:51.320 --> 03:15:52.320
Always good to have you here.

03:15:52.320 --> 03:15:53.320
I love being here.

03:15:53.320 --> 03:15:54.320
Good job on List List.

03:15:54.320 --> 03:15:55.320
We love having you.

03:15:55.320 --> 03:15:56.320
I've never won before.

03:15:56.320 --> 03:15:57.320
It makes me so happy.

03:15:57.320 --> 03:15:58.320
Yay.

03:15:58.320 --> 03:15:59.320
I won List List.

03:15:59.320 --> 03:16:00.320
And you'll never win again.

03:16:00.320 --> 03:16:01.320
No, never again.

03:16:01.320 --> 03:16:02.320
I plan to.

03:16:02.320 --> 03:16:04.320
Enjoy all the Bomb Corp you're going to play this week, I'm sure.

03:16:04.320 --> 03:16:05.320
Yeah.

03:16:05.320 --> 03:16:07.320
I just love that game.

03:16:07.320 --> 03:16:08.320
And Yoshi.

03:16:08.320 --> 03:16:09.320
And Splatoon.

03:16:09.320 --> 03:16:10.320
There's not enough time in the game.

03:16:10.320 --> 03:16:11.320
There's a lot of good stuff out right now.

03:16:11.320 --> 03:16:12.320
I know.

03:16:12.320 --> 03:16:13.320
It's a fun time to be a gamer.

03:16:13.320 --> 03:16:14.320
So many good games this year.

03:16:14.320 --> 03:16:15.320
So much better than last year.

03:16:15.320 --> 03:16:16.320
Well, thank you for being here.

03:16:16.320 --> 03:16:17.320
Do you have anything you want to plug?

03:16:17.320 --> 03:16:18.320
Uh, yeah.

03:16:18.320 --> 03:16:21.320
How about Flaco's fall movie preview?

03:16:21.320 --> 03:16:24.320
If you're still logged in from voting on List List, go on there and rank the movies.

03:16:24.320 --> 03:16:25.320
There you go.

03:16:25.320 --> 03:16:26.320
Like six people have so far.

03:16:26.320 --> 03:16:30.320
If you're listening to the podcast, just log in, make an account, rank the movies.

03:16:30.320 --> 03:16:31.320
It's fun.

03:16:31.320 --> 03:16:32.320
It's points.

03:16:32.320 --> 03:16:33.320
It's points.

03:16:33.320 --> 03:16:34.320
There's no prizes this month so far.

03:16:34.320 --> 03:16:35.320
I don't think there's going to be a prize this month.

03:16:35.320 --> 03:16:36.320
No prize this month.

03:16:36.320 --> 03:16:37.320
But who cares?

03:16:37.320 --> 03:16:38.320
The prize is winning.

03:16:38.320 --> 03:16:39.320
But we're going to try and bring one back next month.

03:16:39.320 --> 03:16:40.320
We're going to do any points now.

03:16:40.320 --> 03:16:41.320
We're going to do prizes more often.

03:16:41.320 --> 03:16:42.320
Prizes are fun, aren't they?

03:16:42.320 --> 03:16:43.320
Prizes are fun.

03:16:43.320 --> 03:16:45.320
I wouldn't know because I can't win any.

03:16:45.320 --> 03:16:47.320
You know, that happens.

03:16:47.320 --> 03:16:48.320
It happens.

03:16:48.320 --> 03:16:49.320
It's okay.

03:16:49.320 --> 03:16:50.320
I used to dominate.

03:16:50.320 --> 03:16:51.320
I dominated for like the first year of vlog.

03:16:51.320 --> 03:16:52.320
You get perks in other ways.

03:16:52.320 --> 03:16:55.320
Your eternal prize is you get to guess on a level or whatever you want.

03:16:55.320 --> 03:16:56.320
Yay.

03:16:56.320 --> 03:16:57.320
Oh, that's so fun.

03:16:57.320 --> 03:16:58.320
All right.

03:16:58.320 --> 03:17:00.320
Let's get to Shane Alenko.

03:17:00.320 --> 03:17:02.320
Thanks for being here.

03:17:02.320 --> 03:17:03.320
Welcome.

03:17:03.320 --> 03:17:05.320
And glad you got to bring up Power Rangers at least once.

03:17:05.320 --> 03:17:06.320
Not enough.

03:17:06.320 --> 03:17:07.320
All right.

03:17:07.320 --> 03:17:08.320
To be honest.

03:17:08.320 --> 03:17:09.320
All right.

03:17:09.320 --> 03:17:10.320
Well, do you have a final thought for our listeners tonight?

03:17:10.320 --> 03:17:12.320
Should be something Power Rangers related.

03:17:12.320 --> 03:17:13.320
Wednesdays.

03:17:13.320 --> 03:17:14.320
Am I right?

03:17:14.320 --> 03:17:15.320
Oh, man.

03:17:15.320 --> 03:17:16.320
I miss Kyle.

03:17:16.320 --> 03:17:17.320
Kyle is so good.

03:17:17.320 --> 03:17:18.320
There it is.

03:17:18.320 --> 03:17:19.320
Play bomb course.

03:17:19.320 --> 03:17:22.320
Shane, I have a story for you.

03:17:22.320 --> 03:17:23.320
Okay.

03:17:23.320 --> 03:17:27.320
Last Monday, I was sitting in and out near my house.

03:17:27.320 --> 03:17:32.320
And I heard the Power Rangers sound go off and had to look at my phone and make sure

03:17:32.320 --> 03:17:34.320
it wasn't you texting me.

03:17:34.320 --> 03:17:38.320
And then I heard it again and I'm looking around going, who the fuck has that?

03:17:38.320 --> 03:17:42.320
There's a person at work that I used to sit in the air that had that as their text to

03:17:42.320 --> 03:17:44.320
him as well as like, that's so cool.

03:17:44.320 --> 03:17:46.320
Is it the one that actually goes beep, beep, beep, beep, beep?

03:17:46.320 --> 03:17:47.320
Yeah.

03:17:47.320 --> 03:17:49.320
Not like mine, which is like a five hour song.

03:17:49.320 --> 03:17:52.320
That's what Shane's text sound is on my phone.

03:17:52.320 --> 03:17:53.320
How appropriate.

03:17:53.320 --> 03:17:54.320
I thought so.

03:17:54.320 --> 03:17:56.320
You know what Shane's text message alert is?

03:17:56.320 --> 03:17:57.320
It's the whole dollar on you, Shane.

03:17:57.320 --> 03:18:01.320
You know what Shane's text message alert is on my phone?

03:18:01.320 --> 03:18:02.320
Same one everybody has.

03:18:02.320 --> 03:18:04.320
You know what yours is on my phone?

03:18:04.320 --> 03:18:05.320
What?

03:18:05.320 --> 03:18:06.320
Spice Girls or something, right?

03:18:06.320 --> 03:18:07.320
No.

03:18:07.320 --> 03:18:08.320
It was Enkindle this.

03:18:08.320 --> 03:18:09.320
Oh, that's right.

03:18:09.320 --> 03:18:10.320
It's Blasto.

03:18:10.320 --> 03:18:11.320
That's right.

03:18:11.320 --> 03:18:12.320
I thought you had an Ab Fab one for me at one point.

03:18:12.320 --> 03:18:13.320
Sweetie darling.

03:18:13.320 --> 03:18:14.320
Lacroix.

03:18:14.320 --> 03:18:15.320
Sweetie Lacroix.

03:18:15.320 --> 03:18:16.320
All right.

03:18:16.320 --> 03:18:18.320
Final thought for us, StarkSaga.

03:18:18.320 --> 03:18:21.320
I should probably give you a different text sound.

03:18:21.320 --> 03:18:22.320
Okay.

03:18:22.320 --> 03:18:25.320
My final thought for the night is I should probably give anybody a different text sound.

03:18:25.320 --> 03:18:28.320
And thank you again, Sinister Creature Con.

03:18:28.320 --> 03:18:29.320
Yay.

03:18:29.320 --> 03:18:32.320
And I look forward to GamerX and whatever other cons.

03:18:32.320 --> 03:18:35.320
I'm going to go to MagFest and whatever other cons are coming up that I'm going to end up

03:18:35.320 --> 03:18:36.320
going to.

03:18:36.320 --> 03:18:37.320
GamerX.

03:18:37.320 --> 03:18:38.320
Last but not least, Loki, your final thought tonight.

03:18:38.320 --> 03:18:41.320
My final thought is I'm working on a Halloween costume.

03:18:41.320 --> 03:18:43.320
Going to be a Lego minifig.

03:18:43.320 --> 03:18:46.320
So I haven't decided yet on which minifig I'm going to do.

03:18:46.320 --> 03:18:50.320
I'm kind of tossed up between either Loki, which would be a lot harder because I have

03:18:50.320 --> 03:18:54.320
to do a paper craft helmet and scepter, or Deadpool.

03:18:54.320 --> 03:18:55.320
All right.

03:18:55.320 --> 03:18:56.320
So one of those.

03:18:56.320 --> 03:18:57.320
Deadpool.

03:18:57.320 --> 03:18:58.320
Hit Loki.

03:18:58.320 --> 03:18:59.320
I want to do Loki, though.

03:18:59.320 --> 03:19:01.320
Hit Loki up on Twitter and let him know.

03:19:01.320 --> 03:19:03.320
Have fun playing Ingress, by the way.

03:19:03.320 --> 03:19:04.320
All right.

03:19:04.320 --> 03:19:05.320
All right.

03:19:05.320 --> 03:19:06.320
All right.

03:19:06.320 --> 03:19:07.320
That's going to do it.

03:19:07.320 --> 03:19:09.320
We will be back in seven days.

03:19:09.320 --> 03:19:14.320
And I believe in seven days, I have to make sure and confirm all that this week, but I

03:19:14.320 --> 03:19:18.320
believe we're actually going to have here in studio live with us somebody new here in

03:19:18.320 --> 03:19:19.320
SAC who also does a podcast.

03:19:19.320 --> 03:19:21.320
We're going to talk to him next week.

03:19:21.320 --> 03:19:23.320
So look forward to that.

03:19:23.320 --> 03:19:25.320
We'll be back in seven days to do it all again.

03:19:25.320 --> 03:19:26.320
Have a great week, everybody.

03:19:26.320 --> 03:19:27.320
Good night.
