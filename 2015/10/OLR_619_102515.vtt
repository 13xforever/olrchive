WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
This week we go back to the future with a nod to Mattel's still unreleased hoverboard, the most stylish time machine, and even a classic video game.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
All this and the actual news of late October 2015 along with your calls, comments, and more starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Great Scott

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
Indeed, see that's my cue to throw the toilet paper for the movie's ice watch. Alright, anyway.

00:39.000 --> 00:43.000
Hi everybody, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:43.000 --> 00:52.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 619 of our show, October the 25th of 2015.

00:52.000 --> 01:03.000
My name is Rob Roberts, you can follow me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, and joining me here in studio to talk about the latest and greatest in video games, video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Hi.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
How are you?

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
I'm alive.

01:11.000 --> 01:19.000
How does it feel to be in the future? Because you know that's what Jason was referencing in the intro, we have some news around that this week, and lots of people talking about that this week.

01:19.000 --> 01:28.000
Because that day, in case you hadn't heard, because it wasn't just like everywhere, that day that Marty McFly travels to the future actually happened this week.

01:28.000 --> 01:36.000
As opposed to all the Tumblr memes that have said that for the past four years, that every day is the day that Marty McFly arrives, that day actually happened this past week.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
It feels like a struggle.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Every day is a struggle.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Because of all the people who want to hold us back.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
You need your-

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
Embrace the future.

01:47.000 --> 01:57.000
That's right, and will deny me my hoverboard, and my flying car, and so forth. Why is that that in every perception of the future, there's flying cars?

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Because traffic sucks.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
Traffic does.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
But imagine this.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
Traffic is worse.

02:02.000 --> 02:14.000
If you had flying cars that have to figure out a way to put lanes up there, just if you want your example of what shit would be with flying cars, look at the fifth element.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.000
Or like Star Wars. I think they sometimes show like on Course Con, they have like-

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Yeah.

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Yeah.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
No.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
But I know what you mean, the fifth element, because he was the taxi driver, and so they had a lot of traffic shots and that, so.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
Yeah. Or that episode of Doctor Who with all of the cars in the tunnel.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Mm-hmm.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
And the cat people and the kittens.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Yeah, that.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
Also welcome, everybody, to the future. Tech master, Loki!

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Hello.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Hey, Loki, how are you doing?

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Good, multi-sasking.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
Good. Yes, I see. You were actually playing Minecraft during the show.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Yeah.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
Are you trying to build something during the show? Is there something extremely important going on in Minecraft?

02:52.000 --> 02:59.000
No, this is basically what is the equivalent of gaming masturbation, just because there is no point to this game in survival mode, so.

02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
Yeah, but some would argue that there is a point to masturbation, Loki.

03:03.000 --> 03:12.000
True, but there's really no point to this, you know, game in survival mode. I mean, so I'm just basically down in my mind, hacking at the wall.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
So that would be more like a video game nap. It's just a video game nap.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Maybe, yeah, nap. That works.

03:17.000 --> 03:24.000
It might feel good, and then you're gonna regret that you just wasted the whole day doing it. I think that would be a little more appropriate.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
All right, say hello as well to our chat room, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
vog.network.com, and if you're listening live, you should participate with us and chat.

03:33.000 --> 03:43.000
live.vog.network.com, and where Tigerclaw is reminding us in our chat room, we still have four years till we get to the year of Blade Runner, which is 2019.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
So we have-

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Guess what? The cars won't still be flying.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
We are two years from the running man.

03:49.000 --> 03:56.000
They might not be flying, but they might be driving themselves. I feel like we're getting closer and closer to that whole thing.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
Google's doing one, supposedly Apple's doing one. I don't know, rumors.

04:02.000 --> 04:11.000
Of course, there's the whole Tesla thing this week where now it's not just cruise control, but now it's cruise drivable and things like that.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
I feel like in four years, it just might be the whole kit and caboodle where the cars are just driving themselves.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.000
I can't be the only one that's disappointed that there's not Tesla coil in every Tesla car.

04:22.000 --> 04:35.000
I'm just saying, I was promised giant Tesla coils for Command and Conquer Red Alert, and I expect giant Tesla coils being able to destroy my enemies with.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
You demand it. Brad from Pod Culture says, get back to me when kit is a reality.

04:40.000 --> 04:47.000
Yes, what year was that? But that was present day, right? Knight Rider? Wasn't that present day? Wasn't it in the future?

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
That was the 80s.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
It was like a James Bond-esque kind of thing.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
That was the 80s.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
Yes, that was the 80s.

04:53.000 --> 05:06.000
But why couldn't we have combined Knight Rider and Magnum P.I. and have kit have been in a Ferrari Testarossa and the Hoth have a huge porn stash?

05:06.000 --> 05:13.000
Maybe there should have been a crossover. We're going to talk about an interesting video game crossover a little later on, just to shift it back to games a little bit, though.

05:13.000 --> 05:23.000
But I did want to say, with this whole fact that Knight Rider was the 80s, and everybody's celebrating Back to the Future this week, and the fact that we are living in the future.

05:23.000 --> 05:30.000
I think anybody that saw the Jem and the Holograms movie this week would rather be living in the past. Just saying.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
One of my friends actually liked it.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
Really?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
And I was like, no.

05:34.000 --> 05:42.000
Here's the thing. I think the Metacritic is what, not that I let Metacritic run my life, but I'm curious. So I think it was like a 29% on Metacritic.

05:42.000 --> 05:52.000
And it's like, okay, well, I've seen worse. There's worse movies. I feel like Mall Cop 2 probably had a lower Metacritic rating than Jem.

05:52.000 --> 05:57.000
And maybe that should be the tagline. Jem and the Holograms. Hey, Adam Sandler's not in it.

05:57.000 --> 06:09.000
But it's still just, it's a complete violation of my childhood.

06:09.000 --> 06:23.000
Believe me. Believe me. I loved the Jem 80s cartoon. And I feel like I heard, read this somewhere, that they took somebody else's script and was like, oh, we have this Jem license we're going to use, or we're going to lose if we don't use it.

06:23.000 --> 06:31.000
So we're just going to insert Jem into this existing script that has nothing to do with Jem. And I think that's, yeah, what they got didn't really work.

06:31.000 --> 06:37.000
I was hoping, when I heard they were making a movie out of Jem, I was hoping it was going to be more like the Josie and the Pussycats movie.

06:37.000 --> 06:45.000
Which, if you haven't seen it, is like, it's one of those like, it's so bad, cheesy, over the top, it's kind of great.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.000
I think that Josie and the Pussycats knows what it is.

06:48.000 --> 06:55.000
Yeah, come on, Josie and the Pussycats opens with a boy band singing their number one hit, Back Door Lover. That's funny.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.000
And it's one of those things that kids don't get.

06:58.000 --> 07:02.000
That's like 21 Jump Street stuff, you know, where that movie knows what it is.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Exactly.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
It's a parody of, you know, it's its own movie, but it's also a parody of the genre.

07:08.000 --> 07:17.000
Parker Posey was in it. I mean, that's instant, like, that's an instant plus 15 on the Metacritic at least. Parker Posey's in it, therefore it lifts it up a little bit. Come on.

07:17.000 --> 07:24.000
Alan Alchemy in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says, Space Channel 5 is in Josie and the Pussycats.

07:24.000 --> 07:36.000
That's right, because there was, the whole like, brand insertion and commercialization was a big thing, and I seem to remember like, Sega and Dreamcast are some of those brands that show up, because that was, you know, about the time.

07:36.000 --> 07:44.000
Kaijuto in chat says, I was a huge Gem fan and I don't care. The minute I found out it was live action, I was always already out and didn't care.

07:44.000 --> 07:54.000
Yeah, and I think most people are just like, I do not consider this canon. It's just I'm turning my back on it. It's not what they say it is. And there's that.

07:54.000 --> 08:06.000
Anyway, how did we get on movies and TVs? We're supposed to be a video game show, but hey, you know what? I know a lot of you guys, when you're playing video games, you're probably watching movies on your second monitor. At least I'm told that's what a lot of people do.

08:06.000 --> 08:19.000
I can't do that. Do you guys, let me ask that a little bit here for part of our kickoff topic, because I feel like the kickoff topic I have is ground we've tread before, but let me ask this real quick is, do you guys multitask when you play games?

08:19.000 --> 08:22.000
Let me start with Loki, because I think the answer is going to be pretty obvious here.

08:22.000 --> 08:35.000
No, normally I don't. And that's the funny thing is, well, at least I don't intend to. But usually the wife is watching something stupid on TV, and so it's kind of hard to ignore it.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
So you multitask not by choice?

08:38.000 --> 08:52.000
Not by choice, yes. It's forced upon my eyes as I'm playing a game, usually like Mario Maker or something like that on a second screen. Unless, of course, I have the TV, in which case, no, there are no distractions.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
And how was Grey's Anatomy this week?

08:54.000 --> 09:04.000
We're already done with Grey's Anatomy, in fact, which she's done with her other stupid ABC family movie or show about some kid that was accused of murder of his aunt or some stupid thing like that.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.000
And now we're on to classic episodes from Roseanne, which isn't so bad.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
That's not so bad. I would watch that one.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Roseanne, it's a good show.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
Yeah, there you go. At least you and the wife can compromise once in a while.

09:14.000 --> 09:20.000
I should be concerned that she aspires to be Roseanne, so that...

09:20.000 --> 09:28.000
But Jamie's the one that goes around going, Dan! Coffee!

09:28.000 --> 09:35.000
No, it's usually Dan playing in the front room and me playing on my computer. We don't do movies. God, that's like not normal.

09:35.000 --> 09:43.000
I was just gonna tell Loki real quick, though, I would be worried for when Fuller House comes out, because that's gonna be the one that I know your wife is gonna be there day one.

09:43.000 --> 09:50.000
I would watch that. I like Fuller House. I mean, it was okay. I just think it's gonna be, no, here's the one I'm fucking worried about, okay?

09:50.000 --> 10:02.000
It's the fact that they're announcing, hey, guess what? We're gonna do another Gilmore Girls series. I'm like, fuck no. Fuck no. I am not fucking listening to that shit.

10:02.000 --> 10:10.000
I don't understand how they talk like that. It's just they talk so quick. God, it's like how I hear the conversations.

10:10.000 --> 10:16.000
The way they talk in that show is not the way people really talk, and it bothers me a lot.

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
Kinda like robots set to 1.5 speed or something like that.

10:19.000 --> 10:27.000
SSJ100Matt says, does listening to great podcasts from the VoG network, cheap plug, while playing games count as multitasking?

10:27.000 --> 10:38.000
Sort of, and that I can do, actually, especially during MMOs. I actually get a lot of my podcasts listening in while I'm grinding in an MMO, and I count Diablo as an MMO.

10:38.000 --> 10:46.000
Because in an MMO, even though the music can be amazing, like Final Fantasy XIV, one of the greatest soundtracks in all of games, let alone an MMO,

10:46.000 --> 10:53.000
once you've heard the song literally 5,000 times, you're kinda ready to turn it down and listen to something else.

10:53.000 --> 11:06.000
So yes, and I think that's a great plug for podcasts in general, is that they make a great kind of background music when you're doing gaming or what have you that doesn't take your visual attention away.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.000
Jamie, I know you started to kind of answer this question a little bit because you said Dan would be in the front room, you'd be in the back.

11:12.000 --> 11:18.000
Do you ever multitask while you're playing a game? Do you do the game on one monitor or something else on the second monitor?

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
I'll chat with Becky sometimes.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Chat.

11:22.000 --> 11:30.000
So I'll keep my chat stuff open, or I'll probably have an FAQ if it's a hard puzzle or something.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
But I pretty much give the game my attention and just chat on the side.

11:34.000 --> 11:42.000
What's interesting about the chat, I think I would say that's about as far as I go with it too, is that I'll either have Google Hangouts, which is what I use these days,

11:42.000 --> 11:47.000
I have Google Hangouts open on another window and I'll do the chat thing, kind of like that.

11:47.000 --> 11:54.000
But I find that with a lot of games, especially if it's an MMO and I happen to have people on, I can chat within the game.

11:55.000 --> 12:03.000
Or like Battle.net has several games that are all tied together that are all pretty popular that you can kind of chat in between the games.

12:03.000 --> 12:09.000
I was catching up with a few people from WoW last night. I just loaded up Battle.net just for the sake of it.

12:09.000 --> 12:17.000
Actually now that I have the full build of Hearthstone, not Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, so I was installing that in Diablo 3 the other day.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Nice.

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
And just chatting with folks from the guild.

12:21.000 --> 12:29.000
Yeah, because obviously I played WoW pretty hardcore for a few years. I was doing the podcast for a while that was about nothing but WoW.

12:29.000 --> 12:40.000
And I found that Battle.net, while I'm playing Diablo, or the rare occasion I'm playing Heroes of the Storm, a great way to talk to some of my old friends from WoW who are still playing.

12:40.000 --> 12:44.000
There's this couple we used to raid with who lives up in Canada, and I can still keep in touch with them.

12:44.000 --> 12:49.000
And then some of you guys know Gemet. I see him online once in a while and I'll talk to him or whoever else from those days.

12:49.000 --> 12:59.000
I kind of like, as much as I hated the real ID and all that stuff in Battle.net at first, the concept of the chat client that goes across multiple games, I really liked.

12:59.000 --> 13:09.000
Steam, I would be a fool to leave out. Steam obviously is another huge way that people can communicate across games.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
It's a lot easier than using Tails.

13:11.000 --> 13:17.000
Yeah, you've beeped me on Steam, DarkSagra. Certainly. There you go.

13:17.000 --> 13:27.000
I tend to, for folks in the free company, because I hate that you can't chat while you're in an instance, so I just use Steam for that.

13:27.000 --> 13:31.000
Oh, there you go. That works. Steam is a really good workaround for all that kind of stuff.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.000
I don't have to keep typing slash Tails slash Tails.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
I think you do slash T as a shortcut, just so you know.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
I still hate having to do slash anything.

13:39.000 --> 13:50.000
Quick side tangent before I get to our chat room, and this will be totally random, but tonight I made DarkSagra before the show try this pumpkin pie soda, which I couldn't stand.

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
I had it last night, but Alan's dying to know. What did you think of it?

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
It's like cream soda with pumpkin aftertaste.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
See, I didn't like it.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
But not good cream soda, and not good pumpkin.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.000
Okay, I think she's drinking it just because.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
It doesn't suck.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Cream soda, yuck.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
I love all things pumpkin, but I do not like that.

14:09.000 --> 14:23.000
I love cream soda a lot, to the point that I'll drink almost any kind of cream soda, but it's novel. I've had it once, and I'm vaguely thirsty, but I think that what's about to come out of the oven is going to be infinitely better than this.

14:23.000 --> 14:26.000
Yes, DarkSagra's baking during OLR tonight.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.000
I didn't make it from scratch. Fuck that.

14:30.000 --> 14:36.000
Alright, Dartusuya is asking, let me guess, is it a Jones soda? No, it's some random store brand that they happen to have.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
I think it'd taste good if it was a Jones soda.

14:38.000 --> 14:48.000
Yeah, let's see, Zippo25 in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I can play games while I watch movies, but not watch movies while I play games.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
That's an interesting way to put it.

14:52.000 --> 15:02.000
I can't even do Netflix in games, because I'll keep wanting to watch whatever it is, and I can't focus on the game. I can't do both at the same time. I just can't.

15:02.000 --> 15:08.000
Let's see, Kaijuto in chat says, the new Diablo is Zelda Triforce Heroes. It's the shit.

15:08.000 --> 15:19.000
You know, I didn't pick that up this week, surprisingly, and I'll tell you why in a little bit. I've been playing something else, but I'm very curious about that, Triforce Heroes.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.000
I want to hear more feedback from my friends about that game.

15:23.000 --> 15:30.000
Let's see, Brad from Pod Culture says, the Jones soda pumpkin pie was kind of nasty, too, when they all drank it on Pod Culture.

15:30.000 --> 15:40.000
And Tigerclaw talking about Triforce Heroes says, the only thing is all three players share the hearts. If any one person dies, you restart the level.

15:40.000 --> 15:45.000
Ouch. I bet that doesn't get annoying whatsoever, I'm sure.

15:45.000 --> 15:56.000
Okay, so Halloween's this week. Happy Halloween to all of our OLR listeners, and I hope whatever it is you're doing this weekend will be safe for you.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.000
Halloween makes me miss Radiscoll and Devil Doll.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Why is that?

16:01.000 --> 16:08.000
Just because the second episode that they did was a Halloween one. It was called Halloweeny. It was funny.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Random.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
I know.

16:11.000 --> 16:18.000
So I'm going to ask you guys, how do you plan to celebrate Halloween, and is there any gaming involved? Will you be doing any special Halloween gaming?

16:18.000 --> 16:27.000
I'll start. I am absolutely going to, and I think a lot of people will be doing this, but I will be playing the PT demo on Halloween.

16:27.000 --> 16:32.000
Hopefully I'll be able to squeeze in between some other stuff I'm doing on Halloween, because I'm kind of busy.

16:32.000 --> 16:37.000
Rocky Horror, obviously, is also a really big Halloween thing, and I'm hosting that here in SAC on Halloween.

16:37.000 --> 16:45.000
So I've got to make sure I can kind of squeeze that in, but I do plan to do a stream, hopefully, of PT on Halloween, because you've got to.

16:45.000 --> 16:51.000
And I'm sure a lot of people are going to be doing it, those that haven't lost it from their PlayStation 4s. I've got to do PT.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
So what about you guys for Halloween?

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Going to the Bay Area.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Yeah.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
See the mills.

16:58.000 --> 17:04.000
Any, well I guess, yeah I'll be going to that too, at least making a cameo, but any gaming at that?

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
I'm sure there'll be some gaming.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
Because we all met playing music-based games, so.

17:08.000 --> 17:14.000
And then, I don't know, it depends on when we come back, what else we're going to do.

17:14.000 --> 17:19.000
But hey, it's a half day, so I'm sure I'll find something to do.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Is there any?

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
Maybe some, my favorite of the Silent Hills.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Might have to happen.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Which is?

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
Three.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Three is my favorite.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
So you can play with the Heather Beam?

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
Heather Beam!

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
Because it's funny for the Heather Beam, like, it's her Japanese voice.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
So it makes me laugh. Heather Beam!

17:38.000 --> 17:39.000
So.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.000
Alright.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Loki, how about you for Halloween?

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
No, I'm not doing anything.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
You're not doing anything? I thought you were going to go to this elaborate costume and all this stuff?

17:46.000 --> 17:51.000
Oh, well I'm making the costume, yeah, that's for work though, but that's not for Halloween, that's just for like the day before.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
That's just for work, I see.

17:53.000 --> 17:57.000
So, any gaming? If you're not going to do anything, are you going to do any gaming at all for Halloween? Scary game?

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
No.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.000
Do you scare your kids?

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
No, they'll probably go trick or treating.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
And then I'll eat their candy.

18:03.000 --> 18:07.000
That's like the advantage of being a parent.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
That's the trick.

18:09.000 --> 18:14.000
You know, I did just remember the other thing I'm probably going to have going on when I get back that night.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Is working on my Grey Warden staff.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
Oh, yeah, for your cosplay you're doing for gamer acts.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Yeah, I've got all of this stuff ready to put together.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
Nice.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
And Victoria is making the costume.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
Awesome.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
But I have to build-

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
Who did my Joker costume, by the way, if you saw it on-

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
I have to build my staff and that's going to be the fun part.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Okay.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
And I've got to modify my boots.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
That'll be fun.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
It'll be a neat costume.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
Awesome.

18:35.000 --> 18:38.000
Well, I know you want to go tend to the little pumpkin rolls.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Well, hold on, hold on before you go.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
Before you go.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Okay, well good.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
They're cooling for a bit.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
Then while they cool, I want to get into our gaming weeks.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.000
Okay.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.000
Because of course we like to start off the show talking about the types of video games that we've been playing this week.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
So, Dark Soccer-

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Mind games.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
How was your gaming week?

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
It was all right.

18:54.000 --> 19:00.000
I've been playing some more Happy Home Designer, Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
Now I have to design Town Hall, so that's interesting.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
Do you need the amiibo cards for that?

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
Because I saw a ton of them yesterday and I was like, maybe I should be buying these for Jamie.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
Because I don't think these are like super easy to find right now.

19:11.000 --> 19:14.000
I have a small pack of them that came with it, but I don't know.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
I haven't opened the cards.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
Oh, okay.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.000
So if you find any of the neat cards, like the kitty cats or any of them-

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Aren't they all blind reveals?

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Yeah, I guess they are.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
So just buy me a pack and I'll thank you for them.

19:24.000 --> 19:28.000
All right, well, BRB, I have to go back to Chico where I saw them.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
They have them at the Toys R Us near my house.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
Oh yeah, that's good.

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
But I think I'm worth $6 in a trip to Chico.

19:35.000 --> 19:41.000
I downloaded Diablo 3 and Heroes of the Storm, so I'm going to be trying to get into that.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
Although a lot of my coworkers play Hearthstone 2.

19:44.000 --> 19:49.000
I'm like, no more Magic games, no more.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
We've been playing Super Mario 3D World.

19:51.000 --> 19:59.000
Dan's playing through Super Mario 2 Advance on the Wii U, playing the Virtual Console version.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Oh, right.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
And we got Tank, Tank, Tank.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
So we're probably going to be playing that tonight.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.000
Really? I didn't like that game on the Wii U at all.

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
Well, Dan just found it and got super excited and bought it.

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
Oh, so they have that free, like the free to play version.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
It's just really a demo.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
We've got the game, the game game.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
Okay, wow.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Oh yeah, Dragon Age Inquisition.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
I'm back to actually playing through two new side-by-side playthroughs.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.000
Because I'm comparing the Templar playthrough with the Mage playthrough.

20:32.000 --> 20:41.000
And I'm also trying to finish Origins, but it's kind of hard to go back and play Origins after playing Inquisition with how pretty it is.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
Yeah, same.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
And how much better the game plays, oh my god.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
That's why I was never able to beat Origins.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Origins is like a clusterfuck for fighting.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
Yeah.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.000
I really like the combat in Dragon Age 2.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
I like the combat in Inquisition a whole lot better too.

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
So I was playing that and I started Beginner's Guide.

21:05.000 --> 21:12.000
Which is really just a game dedicated to the games of this other person who I think stopped making games.

21:12.000 --> 21:18.000
So it's basically this person's old levels and everything and someone walking through and talking about game design.

21:18.000 --> 21:22.000
And it's by the folks that did the Stanley parable, so it's pretty neat.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Nice.

21:23.000 --> 21:26.000
And I bought Elder Scrolls Online.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
But I haven't started it yet.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.000
It's 20 bucks on the Humble sale, I think it's over though.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
Oh wow, okay.

21:32.000 --> 21:35.000
I got the Capcom Humble bundle.

21:35.000 --> 21:40.000
And I played Final Fantasy XIV for a little bit, so it's kind of...

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
You've been busy.

21:41.000 --> 21:47.000
Busier than usual, but I've got crap ton of other stuff I need to get done, so probably going to be slow.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
In the rush to Halloween.

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
Loki, how was your gaming week besides the Minecraft you're playing right now?

21:51.000 --> 21:55.000
I did play Minecraft earlier this week as well, so there's that.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
What else did I play?

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Minecraft Story Mode.

21:58.000 --> 22:02.000
Not because I'm just obsessed with Minecraft or something, but because I wanted to check it out.

22:02.000 --> 22:06.000
See what exactly they're going to do for a story-based Minecraft game.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
And it was okay.

22:08.000 --> 22:14.000
I was asking Rob earlier how the other Telltale games are as far as, are they pretty linear?

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
Do they have a lot of stuff that you have to do, like puzzle solving?

22:17.000 --> 22:26.000
Because I'm coming into it thinking, oh hey, I used to play these old PC adventure games and stuff from LucasArts a while back.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
Is this anything like this?

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
And it seemed pretty linear.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
It's entertaining, I guess.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
It was short.

22:33.000 --> 22:36.000
I finished the first episode in about two hours, maybe.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
If that.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
And there wasn't really a whole lot of interaction other than just dialogue.

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
And the rest is kind of just watching it and there's a few quick time events.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
That's about it, I mean.

22:47.000 --> 22:55.000
Yeah, I kind of found the Telltale games to not be, at least the ones I've played, like Walking Dead and Jurassic Park even I played.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
I didn't find those games to be super linear.

22:58.000 --> 23:03.000
I imagine Minecraft, because it's geared towards kids, might be a little more linear than the others.

23:03.000 --> 23:09.000
But I also didn't find it to be as rich as maybe like the King's Quest games and stuff used to be.

23:09.000 --> 23:12.000
It was very different than that, I think.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
Yeah, I don't know. It was okay.

23:14.000 --> 23:18.000
I mean, I was just kind of curious to see how they would kind of throw a story into that.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
And of course they have different characters, not Steve or anything.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
Right.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
My son kept going, like, you know, is Steve in that?

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
I'm like, no, he's not in this game.

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
And it's like, why isn't he in there? Why isn't Steve in there?

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Because Steve died.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Because Steve's not in the game.

23:32.000 --> 23:35.000
Although he should make a cameo. I think that they should do that.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.000
I kind of got, I don't know.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.000
I was getting a little bit annoyed with Patton Oswalt's voice acting, though, in the game.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
But whatever. It was okay.

23:46.000 --> 23:51.000
Whether I'm going to pick up the rest of the episodes, I'm interested.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
But it's not something that I'm going to make a priority right now.

23:53.000 --> 23:56.000
Especially since they discount that stuff, like, all the time.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
So I may just wait for it to be discounted.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
But it was okay.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
I mean, I guess it's worth five bucks.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
Which is what I paid for it.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
And then you can play it through it again.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
And there's different, you know, dialogue things that can happen and stuff.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
Sure.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
I tried Super Time Force a little bit.

24:12.000 --> 24:15.000
I didn't really get past the demo or the tutorial portion.

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
I just kind of got sick of it.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
It was mainly just killing time while Minecraft Story Mode was downloading.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
And then, what else?

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
I...

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
Let's see.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
I mentioned Minecraft already.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
I started playing Final Fantasy VI again.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Just a little bit.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
Because I actually started Final Fantasy VII.

24:34.000 --> 24:38.000
And then it just did not look good anymore.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.000
I mean, it was awesome on PlayStation 1.

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
But, oh my god.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
Now it just kind of...

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
It did not hold up too well.

24:47.000 --> 24:54.000
Or maybe I just don't like it the way that they kind of up-rezzed everything for this update for the PC version.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
So maybe that's the thing that bothers me about it.

24:56.000 --> 25:00.000
But, other than that, I mean Final Fantasy VI is amazing.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
So, I started that.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
I don't know if I'll finish it or not.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
But, it's a fun game.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
And then Ingress.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
I played Ingress and got to level 6.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
I hit level 2.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Did you really? Congrats.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
Yeah.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
I don't know if I need to finish all the tutorial stuff in that.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
No, you don't. I never did.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Do you get a badge for that or something?

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
No, I don't think so.

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
They had to suspend the verify thing because they didn't have the resources for it.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
But, I was going to ask real quick about Final Fantasy VII.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Whatever happened to the...

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
Remember last year at the PlayStation experience?

25:34.000 --> 25:38.000
They announced Final Fantasy VII, but it was just the PC version on PlayStation 4.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
And everybody was like, fuck off. That's not what we asked for.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.000
And then, Sony finally delivered it at E3.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
It was like, okay, okay. We were just fucking with you. Here it is.

25:45.000 --> 25:48.000
But, I thought that PC thing was still coming.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
Like, is that not happening now because of the other remake?

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
I hope not.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
I hope it's not coming.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
I don't like the PC version that well.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
I just don't think it looks that great.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Put up just the regular version of the game.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
Have it play on the PlayStation 4. Done.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
You know what I mean?

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
Because they have it out there already as a title.

26:07.000 --> 26:13.000
Hell, just make it so we can play PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 games.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
Hell, it'll all have itself for PlayStation 1 games.

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Because, shit.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
If a fucking PSP can play PlayStation 1 games,

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
the fucking PlayStation 4 has the power to be able to emulate PlayStation 1 games.

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
I really feel like that's an unlock we're gonna get at this PlayStation experience.

26:27.000 --> 26:33.000
I just really feel like, you know, the Christmas season's a good time to announce something like that.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
I just, I really hope that's the mic drop.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
Because, like, that would be great.

26:37.000 --> 26:42.000
Because, like, I have a few games from that that I got.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
You know, I purchased, like, some older PlayStation 1 games.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
I mean, it'd be nice. Or even PlayStation 2 games.

26:47.000 --> 26:54.000
Like, I've got, like, Katamari that's just sitting there that, you know, I had to boot up my PlayStation 3 to be able to play that stuff.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
It's stupid.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
I don't want to have to do that.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
But, um, alright.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
So, Ingress, though. I'm playing lots of Ingress.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
Not so much the last couple days.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
Because I've been really trying to focus on having to work on my costume.

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
Which hasn't happened.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Because I've been super tired.

27:14.000 --> 27:17.000
Like, today I was trying to even do the show role and I fell asleep.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Because I was exhausted.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
I wonder why your stories went up later than usual.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.000
So, yeah. I was doing that while my kids were napping.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
And, like, I just passed out.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Because I'm so tired.

27:29.000 --> 27:34.000
So, unfortunately, last night was going to be one of the times I had to work on that.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
And it just didn't happen.

27:36.000 --> 27:41.000
But, ideally, I'm going to be a Lego minifigure of Loki.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
Because that would be funny.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.000
Not yourself, but...

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
But Loki from Marvel Superheroes.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
Or Lego Marvel Superheroes.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
Nice.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
And if I don't have enough time, then it'll have to be something else.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
I look forward to the pictures.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
Yeah. So, it'll be something Lego related.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
I'm going to work on it tonight.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
I'm going to try.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Alright. As far as my gaming week goes.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Mostly the same games.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Diablo 3.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
I don't remember if I mentioned it last week.

28:07.000 --> 28:10.000
I've now hit Paragon, like, 330.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
In my adventures in Diablo 3 and playing with Alan.

28:13.000 --> 28:17.000
I have surpassed the Paragon level of my non-seasonal characters.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.000
Which would be all the previous seasons.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
And pre that seasonal stuff combined.

28:21.000 --> 28:25.000
Because your seasonal XP dumps into the main pool every time a season ends.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
So, I've now surpassed that point.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.000
So, that should tell you about how much Diablo I've been playing lately.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
However, also, you kind of get more experience now.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
Because the K'Nai's Cube, which gives you the power of three more legendaries.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
Allows you to do much harder content.

28:39.000 --> 28:42.000
And so you're getting more XP through that harder content.

28:42.000 --> 28:45.000
To be fair, this doesn't necessarily mean the hours I've spent have been more.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
But certainly my character's power is greater.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
So, that's been fun.

28:50.000 --> 28:53.000
Also, I've been playing a little bit of Final Fantasy XIV.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
But not a lot. I'm still kind of on a lull.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
I know they had some announcements today.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.000
We didn't really get them into the show role.

28:59.000 --> 29:02.000
But they talked a little bit about what they're going to be doing with Patch 3.1.

29:02.000 --> 29:06.000
And there's going to be a mini-game that involves the minions.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
That's pretty cool.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
And two new dungeons. So, that'll be nice.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
They're going to be updating Gold Saucer, I think, with some other games.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
So, that's cool.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
Let's see.

29:16.000 --> 29:24.000
I also, at a gathering of about eight people, actually got to play some Jackbox Party Pack 2.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
I'd already played it a little bit last week.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
But only with just a few people.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
So, I think I got to play it more the way it was intended.

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
In a room full of people.

29:32.000 --> 29:36.000
And we only really had the time to just play a couple of the games.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
We didn't play everything.

29:38.000 --> 29:43.000
But we played Quiplash XL, which was hilarious.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.000
And we had a lot of fun with that.

29:45.000 --> 29:49.000
And when you have eight people, there's a lot of prompts.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
Because each prompt, I guess it's like, I don't know, Family Feud style.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Where it matches up two people at a time.

29:54.000 --> 29:58.000
So, if you have eight people, and each person is answering two questions.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.000
I mean, it's something like fifteen prompts or something you're going through and voting on.

30:01.000 --> 30:03.000
But it's really funny.

30:03.000 --> 30:09.000
Especially with the right group of people that are all kind of on that same sense of humor where we're all going to hell.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
So, I had a good time playing that.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
We also played Earwax.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Which was okay.

30:16.000 --> 30:24.000
I'm not sure the formula works totally compared to some of the other Jackbox games.

30:24.000 --> 30:30.000
Just because it's weird that you really have no control over the sound effects that you can have in your pool.

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
Like, it would be a little more interesting if it was Cards Against Humanity style or something.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Where you had a hand of sound effects.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.000
And then the ones you didn't use, you could use in the later round or something like that.

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
I don't know. This thing might be a little more interesting with that.

30:41.000 --> 30:44.000
But it's weird. You can't really preview the sound effects too.

30:44.000 --> 30:49.000
But again, when you have so many people and everybody's in that same sense of humor.

30:49.000 --> 30:53.000
So, every single prompt is responded to as some sort of fart noise.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
There is still some humor to be found in that.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
So, I didn't think the game was bad or anything.

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
It's not as strong as the other Jackbox games.

31:01.000 --> 31:06.000
Which, earlier last week, myself, Allen, and Shane were all playing Bomb Corp.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
That one is really cool.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
That one, I think, is the reason to check out the pack.

31:11.000 --> 31:16.000
Because it's something very, very different from a lot of the stuff you saw in Jackbox 1.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
And the sense of humor is really great.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
And the retro style graphics.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
It's a really fun game to play together.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
Bomb Corp, I think, is my favorite out of those that I've played.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
Anyhow, other games I've played this week.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.000
Dragon Quest Heroes on PlayStation 4.

31:31.000 --> 31:35.000
I actually bought that because I was on the fence about getting it.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
I wasn't sure if I wanted it.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
Because I thought, ah, but I really want a main Dragon Quest game.

31:40.000 --> 31:41.000
I'd rather play that.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
But then, I was watching some Twitch streams and I was like,

31:44.000 --> 31:49.000
oh, it's Dynasty Warriors or Hyrule Warriors, if you will, meets Dragon Quest.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
I'm like, what the hell. I'll do it.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.000
So I ended up buying it.

31:52.000 --> 31:55.000
And I've actually sunk quite a few hours in that game.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
It's fun. I'm having a good time with it.

31:58.000 --> 32:05.000
There's something very zen and fulfilling about just the utter button mashing

32:05.000 --> 32:09.000
where you're just taking out slime after slime and skeleton

32:09.000 --> 32:13.000
and cute little bat things and all the other creatures in Dragon Quest.

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
It's really cool that in this game they've kind of blended

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
some of the different Dragon Quest worlds together.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.000
Because there's characters that appear from like four, five, six,

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
I think seven and eight, all show up.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
So I think that was kind of cool.

32:26.000 --> 32:30.000
So, yeah, I'm enjoying Dragon Quest Warriors more than I thought I would.

32:30.000 --> 32:34.000
Even though the game doesn't have a lot of depth to it.

32:34.000 --> 32:39.000
I mean, I guess you can set your controls two different ways.

32:39.000 --> 32:43.000
And I chose to do the easy way, which is like you just hit square over and over,

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
mix in some triangle, and you're doing all these crazy-ass combos.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
So, you know, I chose to, I guess, make the game a little more simpler.

32:50.000 --> 32:54.000
But they do some other JRPG stuff in it.

32:54.000 --> 33:00.000
Like, use the item drops you get at the Alchemist to create this accessory

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
that you can use.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
And then you can combine accessories to make the super accessory.

33:04.000 --> 33:07.000
And, you know, a lot of those JRPG grindy things you've come to expect.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
They're all there.

33:08.000 --> 33:12.000
JRPG grindiness is why I love Dragon Quest.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
So I'm having a good time.

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
Just the character design is great, as it always is in Dragon Quest games.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
And the music, of course.

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
Which is very interesting.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
And I know we talked about this a little bit last week.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
But I found it very interesting that right there on the title screen,

33:26.000 --> 33:31.000
there's a little, it says, press options for more info on streaming stuff.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Or I don't know what's the streaming information.

33:33.000 --> 33:36.000
And it actually said, when you press start, it's this whole, like, legal thing

33:36.000 --> 33:40.000
that's like, you know, you do not have permission to stream

33:40.000 --> 33:43.000
just for the purposes of listening to the music.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
This is copyright.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
Such and such.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
Like, they don't want people to just stream the music only.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
And they, it's so weird.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.000
Like, all the weird copyright stuff that's in that game.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.000
I know we dipped into it a little bit last week.

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
But to kind of see it firsthand in the game was kind of strange.

33:59.000 --> 34:03.000
So I have a feeling publishers are going to get more control

34:03.000 --> 34:06.000
over what you can and can't stream in, like, a future PlayStation 4 update.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
I wouldn't be surprised if maybe when streaming's on,

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
they could disable the music somehow.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
I feel like Square would have wanted to do that on this.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.000
I don't know.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
So, anyhow, yeah, I've been playing a lot of fun games this week.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
That was my gaming week.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.000
So, some housekeeping before we get into some news.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.000
I don't have a lot, really, to announce here.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
I don't think we're going to be here Thanksgiving weekend.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
I think Dark Saga said she's going to be out of town.

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
And I don't think we're going to be here Thanksgiving weekend

34:31.000 --> 34:32.000
because most of you guys probably won't be either.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.000
But otherwise, we're still here every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific,

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
at the Voice of the Geeks Network.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
voggenetwork.com.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.000
Although, Bobby was not on tonight.

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
He had some other stuff to take care of tonight, so he was not able to be live.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
But he'll be back next week, as will we.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
So, let's get into some gaming news.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
Loki.

34:53.000 --> 34:59.000
So, Sony has confirmed that they don't have any first-party titles coming for the Vita.

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
And I can't say that I'm surprised

35:01.000 --> 35:04.000
because they haven't had a lot of first-party titles since...

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
God, what was the last one they had for that?

35:06.000 --> 35:10.000
Was it that Media Molecule game? I think the paper one.

35:10.000 --> 35:11.000
I don't remember what it's called now.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.000
Tearaway.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.000
Tearaway, yes.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.000
Which they ended up putting on the PlayStation 4.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
Yes, exactly.

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
So, that was the last one I think that they did for that console.

35:19.000 --> 35:24.000
They're basically allowing the third parties to basically shine on that.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
And that's it.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
They're focusing on the PlayStation 4.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
Shine or do the work for our dying console?

35:30.000 --> 35:31.000
Uh...

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
Yeah.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
And sorry to the Vita fans,

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
because no one is going to ruffle some feathers with that comment,

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
but at the same time, come on.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
If Sony themselves is like,

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
eh, we're not really interested in developing for it,

35:40.000 --> 35:41.000
what does that tell you?

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
It's on its way out.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
They're just not making the money back on it.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
You've seen the writing on the wall for a while with that console.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.000
They're not making the money back on it.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.000
And that's fine.

35:48.000 --> 35:52.000
I think that third parties should be able to do well on it.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
But this kind of pisses me off more

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
that we don't have something like PlayStation Mobile again

35:57.000 --> 36:00.000
where you could easily publish to it

36:00.000 --> 36:03.000
and be able to put a lot of those indie titles out there.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
Because that'd be awesome to be able to...

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
You want a PlayStation Ouya?

36:06.000 --> 36:10.000
I want a PlayStation that just has, you know,

36:10.000 --> 36:13.000
the same kind of app store like an Android

36:13.000 --> 36:16.000
or maybe not so much like Android or iOS

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
because there's a lot of shit on there.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
But maybe like Steam.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
I mean, Steam has a lot of shit on there too,

36:22.000 --> 36:25.000
but it's a lot less, I think,

36:25.000 --> 36:28.000
because there's a little bit of a barrier of entry to that.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.000
But I'd like to see something like that,

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
that at least has, there's a way to get your content out there.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
So I think that was a pretty cool idea.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
It's just it wasn't something that was promoted.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
It's like they have these programs where they're like,

36:40.000 --> 36:43.000
eh, we're just not gonna really do anything with it.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
Like they'll announce it and they'll get all excited about it

36:45.000 --> 36:48.000
and they're like, eh, oh, yeah, we do have that, don't we?

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Oh, well, fuck it. It's gone.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.000
I'd be really curious to see that post-mortem expose

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
on the PlayStation Vita in like five years

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
from all the insiders on what the fuck happened.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
But here's the other weird thing, though.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
You know, we say all this,

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
but then every week here on the show,

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
I'm reading Japanese release dates,

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
and there's something on the Vita every week in Japan.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.000
Granted, it's not Sony,

37:11.000 --> 37:14.000
but maybe that whole third parties are gonna carry it thing

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
is working overseas in a way it's not working here.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
I think it's just the difference in culture

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
because you have a lot of people that are taking mass transit,

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
you know, to places and they have time to kill

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
and it's time to play these games.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
It's more of a portable, you know,

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
it seems to be more conducive to like portable gaming.

37:32.000 --> 37:35.000
But people here seem to just use their phones.

37:35.000 --> 37:38.000
Yeah, they use their phones for that,

37:38.000 --> 37:41.000
but I just don't think it's like, I don't know,

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
I don't think that you can get the same experience with it

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
without the buttons and everything.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.000
I don't want to play, I have Minecraft on my phone,

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
I bought it, I don't want to play it

37:49.000 --> 37:54.000
because it doesn't support a controller, which is stupid.

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
So I don't want to play it that way.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
Akuma JP in chat who happens to be in Japan says,

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Bingo, Loki.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.000
I'm assuming what you're saying about why it's succeeding in Japan

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
where it's not doing so well here in America.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
But it's not like we don't have mass transit.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.000
They tried like to make this console,

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
it was way too expensive when it came out.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.000
They have like, oh, look, it's gonna have like mobile in it,

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
you can get mobile data plans through AT&T,

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
which it was like, ooh, 3G.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
Oh, by the way, it can't really do anything over that,

38:22.000 --> 38:25.000
other than just you can do the asynchronous,

38:25.000 --> 38:28.000
you know, game multiplayer or some shit like that,

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
like Ghost Racing.

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
It's like, no one wanted to do that.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.000
They wanted to have it where you can play like actual people

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
over the internet and stuff like that.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.000
And maybe now that's something that they can do.

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
I would love to see them put out another portable console

38:43.000 --> 38:46.000
that wasn't shit, I don't know.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
Well, Bonds006 in chat says,

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
Dear Sony, the Vita just had to take away almost 30 years

38:51.000 --> 38:53.000
of Ninty handheld presence.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
That was a huge uphill battle.

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
Yeah, but I don't think Nintendo is necessarily insurmountable either.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.000
I mean, when we get into some of the NX predictions

39:02.000 --> 39:05.000
about how Nintendo is really going to make an ecosystem

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
out of their dominant handheld in their system,

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
that's gonna be very interesting, you know,

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
if those rumors pan out or whatever.

39:11.000 --> 39:14.000
But, I mean, Nintendo is not insurmountable

39:14.000 --> 39:18.000
because, let us not forget, the 3DS,

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
there was a moment where people were questioning

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
if the 3DS was gonna make it.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.000
And Nintendo really pushed out some of those first-party things

39:25.000 --> 39:27.000
that people were really hoping for.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
I think it was like when a Mario Kart game came out.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.000
Yeah, like Mario Kart and Animal Crossing

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
and the new Super Mario Brothers.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
Yeah, it kind of all came out all at once

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
to really pull that console up.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Sony had an opportunity to strike,

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
and they kind of did with the PSP,

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
but I'm not sure they ever really supported the PSP in the same way.

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
Well, Sony, that's the thing,

39:49.000 --> 39:52.000
the problem was they put it to like,

39:52.000 --> 39:55.000
oh, we're gonna have these other companies

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
port over our games to that console,

39:57.000 --> 39:58.000
and that was the problem.

39:58.000 --> 40:01.000
They were like, oh yeah, we're gonna have Call of Duty,

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
and we're gonna have Resistance,

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
and I was like, fuck yes, mobile Call of Duty?

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
That's gonna be amazing.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
And then the Resistance game came out

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
by the same developer of the Call of Duty game,

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
and it was terrible.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
It was fucking garbage.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
And I was like, uhhhh,

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
I'm not sure if I want to play this Call of Duty game,

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
and then the Call of Duty game comes out,

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
oh, it's fucking terrible too.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
It's like, why did you do that?

40:25.000 --> 40:29.000
Why did you entrust your most popular franchises to garbage?

40:29.000 --> 40:32.000
And I have to do the research,

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
but I think it might be the same company

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
that put out the last Tony Hawk game too.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Maybe, I don't know.

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
I don't know about that, but

40:41.000 --> 40:44.000
yeah, you can't do that.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.000
You can't just have this first-party title

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
that's gonna really carry the console,

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
and just shuffle it off to some company

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
that might be able to do it.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
DungeonBuster in chat says,

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
nice hardware, but kind of hard to break

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
Nintendo's vice-like grip without the kind of

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
third-party title glut that have driven

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Nintendo's handhelds.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
So interesting when you compare that to the situation

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
that Wii U's been in, though.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
It's so, I mean, like, I don't know,

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
it's so crazy to me.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Also, in chat,

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
Oh, IkumaJP kind of clarifying what was said,

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
or no, saying bingo again for Loki, saying,

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
the Vita has bells and whistles,

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
but most we don't need.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
And I can hear that,

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
because, yeah, I have a 3G Vita.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.000
Why? Why do I fucking have a 3G Vita?

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
I really, I mean, I only bought it

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
because it was on sale on Amazon.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
It ended up being just as much as like a Wi-Fi one would

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
and it had a game with it or whatever.

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
But, like, there really was no fucking reason

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
to have a 3G Vita.

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
No, there wasn't. It didn't do anything.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
I was not going to pay for that data plan.

41:45.000 --> 41:48.000
Why didn't it do online gaming over 3G?

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
I think that scared AT&T

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
and all these, because, you know,

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
as everything in voice is going

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
unlimited minutes, unlimited minutes,

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
we're seeing these mobile companies

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
start to gouge the shit out of data,

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
which we all know is not that expensive,

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
but like fucking Verizon or somebody this week,

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
didn't they just come out and say,

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
well, we'll let you keep your grandfathered

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
but now we're going to charge you, like,

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
something like, it's up to like 40 bucks a month now

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
for Verizon's unlimited data plan,

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
if you want to stay on it.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
So it's like, these wireless companies

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
know that data is their bread and butter,

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
so I think they were afraid of all that multi-player gaming stuff.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Well, here's the worst part about those companies.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
They'll have their advertised rates.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
Oh, but there's a line access fee

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
that's like $20 that you have to pay

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
in order to have access

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
to all that high-speed data and everything.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
So that, yeah, that was the thing with Verizon.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Like, I was like, hey, well, shit, that's 40 bucks a month,

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
you know, or whatever.

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
You know, that's like, you know, what I'm paying now,

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
plus it's, you know, unlimited minutes,

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
so hell, I'm going to do that.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
And they're, oh, yeah, but it's also got,

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
there's this access fee that you have to pay.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Like, well, that wasn't advertised here.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Oh, yeah, but there's that small asterisk

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
that you didn't see there.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Geez. It's okay.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
It ended up with my employee discount.

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
It's like 10 bucks more than I was paying before.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
Um, AkumaJP says,

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
When he was in the dump at the time, remember the PlayStation 3

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
was not selling and people were letting go.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
That's why Allgame win third party.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Tigerklonchat says,

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Those that are grandfathered in with unlimited data

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
isn't really unlimited. The minute you reach

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
a certain cap, they will throttle your connection

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
even if it's still unlimited.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Yeah, I know, because I have AT&T

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
and it's the same thing where, you know,

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
I'll get a nasty text like,

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
I don't know if I should be admitting this,

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
but like six or seven days into the month,

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
I'll get my text that says you're

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
almost at your bandwidth cap

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
and you're gonna get throttled.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
And I guess they probably do throttle me,

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
but I don't, I actually don't notice it.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
What I've read is that they throttle during peak times.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
But peak times are

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
probably when I'm driving to and from work

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
and I'm not really using much data outside

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
of maybe Waze. You know what I mean?

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Uh, yeah, I don't use much, okay,

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
well, I do use a lot of data now just because

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
of stupid Ingress, but, um, aside

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
from that, I'm not, because

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Ingress is the most expensive free game I've ever played.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Why? What the fuck is it doing

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
that's using so much data? Pinging

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
where I'm at? I mean, uh, the portal

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
pictures, the maps. The pictures

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
are so fucking tiny. There's no way

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
that that's like a big data

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
thing that's like sucking, what,

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
like a one megabyte picture?

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
Whoo! I mean, there's no way

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
that that shit is fucking taking up all

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
that bandwidth. Cache that

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
shit. I mean, come on.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Whatever, but yeah, I use

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
about a hundred, it's about a hundred megs, I think,

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
an hour, maybe, that you

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
play that for no

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
reason. Yep, I know, I know.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Anyway, uh,

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
so we got on a bit of a tangent there,

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
but, uh, no, I really hope

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
the system does well. I mean, I think it's

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
pretty nice. It's a little,

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
ergonomically, it could use a little bit

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
of help, but it was nice that they had the dual

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
analog sticks and everything. The back touch

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
thing was absolutely fucking not

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
necessary at all. Um,

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
it could have used maybe a second set of, um,

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
rear trigger, or, you know, rear

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
shoulder buttons. That would have been nice.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Um, that's

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
about it. The front facing camera,

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
totally not fucking necessary. Actually,

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
a camera at all on those fucking devices,

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
not fucking necessary. Even the 3DS.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
Yeah. The 3D picture thing is kinda

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
cool. Um, it was cool for

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
a minute. For a minute, yeah, and then, like,

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
I don't know, it was just kinda lame. What games

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
use it?

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
That people actually play? Don't give me that

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
AR games and all that. The people don't use it.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
No, the AR cards too.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Both systems. The AR cards. That was

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
fucking stupid. No one needs that.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
Alright. Well, moving

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
on. Maybe things should just go back to the

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
way they used to be. At least that's where Square

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Enix might be headed. Uh, interesting

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
because they released their annual

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
report, which, you know, we're getting to the end of the

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
financial year for various companies.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
So Square Enix put out their annual

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
report about, you know, where the money's made and all

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
that. And an interesting passage

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
from their annual report, and this is

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
a quote from that, says,

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Well, at the same time, have new customers enjoyed the

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
IP as though it were brand new? By not

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
only optimizing single pieces of IP

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
for single platforms, but also rolling

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
out IP in a multidimensional manner to meet the

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
needs of the modern market, we believe we can

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
deliver exciting new experiences.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
So, interesting because

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
they basically say, they're gonna go back

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
and reinvent stuff they did on old consoles

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
for new technology. So, like

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Chrono Trigger on the Oculus Rift.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
Who's ready for it? Yeah.

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
Obviously, I'm jumping into conclusion here.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Come on, that's a franchise you haven't touched in a while.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
I could think that would do well.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Hell yes. Oh my god, that's a great one.

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
Good answer.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Dark Sakura, is there a classic Square Enix

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
franchise you'd like to see them reinvent

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
for the newer technology that's out there?

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
No. No. Actually,

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
yes, I do have one. And I would...

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Day one. Day one.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
Ur-guys. Ur-guys would be good.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
No, no, not ur-guys.

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Super Mario fucking RPG.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Super Mario RPG.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Might be difficult. Why would it be difficult?

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Because of the whole Nintendo.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
Unless... Come on, Nintendo.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Come on. You know.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Let's get your tinfoil

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
hats, everybody. Get the aluminum foil out of your

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
kitchen drawer. You ready, everybody? Get them

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
out. Get them out. Make your hat. Put it on.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Here we go. Here we go. Here goes

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Rob justifying how Super Mario

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
RPG could be in the remakes right now.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
Here's how it is. Do you remember

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
a couple months ago, there was a rumor floating

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
around that Nintendo

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
for the NX was

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
majorly in bed with a third-party

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
publisher. And some people were speculating

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
that publisher was Square Enix.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
What if...

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
What if...

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Nintendo's letting them do a new Super Mario

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
RPG as a launch title for NX?

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
That'd be cool, but I don't think that's gonna happen.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
As

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
quick as you were to fanboy about that, you should just miss that.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
I think they would do like a Dragon

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
Quest game or something like that.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Because they could kind of publish

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
first-party stuff. 12's already been announced for 3DS

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
and PlayStation 4, so unless...

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
It would be cool. I would be down with that.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
But I don't think that would be something that

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
most... It's not gonna get

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
the casual audience to come over to the NX.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
It would get the hardcore

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
fans of RPGs and stuff to come over.

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Unless they make it

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
approachable enough for them.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
As fun as tinfoil hat

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
moments are, I think in reality, that

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
moved on to the Mario and Luigi series

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
that you see on handhelds. I know it's not

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
the same, but that's kind of

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
you know, where things are at.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
Come on, you can do it all epic and shit like

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
fucking Kingdom Hearts and stuff.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
ActDeft in chat says

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
I'm surprised it hasn't appeared in the Wii U virtual

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
console. You know,

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
me too, although I'm sure it's rights.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Again, agreements, sign-offs,

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
things like that. Licenses

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
that expired and so on. That's why it doesn't

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
show up on virtual console.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
But anything is possible. Dare to dream, you guys.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
Dare to dream.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Let's see,

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
what else do I want to say on that whole thing about

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
the remakes and so forth.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
So Dark Soccer, you're against it, right?

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
I just don't care.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
You don't care, or you don't want them to do it?

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
If they want to do it, they can do it. It doesn't mean we have to buy it.

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
Well, they're

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
going to want to make things that hopefully you buy, though,

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
Dark Soccer. They don't want to just make something to make

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
it, because making games costs a lot of money.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
If I don't want it, somebody else out there

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
might want it, so it doesn't really matter what I think.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
Can someone like, I know

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
this isn't Square Enix, but can someone like maybe

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
get a hold of Namco Bandai and say, hey, you know

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
what, can you guys just stop sucking for

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
a second and actually just make a good

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
new Ridge Racer game? I mean, it's kind

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
of sad that we don't have a Ridge Racer

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
game launching a new

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
console platform. It's been a long time

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
since like, what, the

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
PlayStation, well, the PlayStation

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
Vita had a Ridge Racer title.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
That's where it kind of went downhill. It was like,

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
fucking, oh hey, yeah, it's like

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
30 bucks for this demo, and then you

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
got to buy all the tracks and all the cars.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
Now, fuck that shit. I'm talking about just

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
like, a good Ridge Racer game to

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
launch a platform.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
Maybe they should upscale R4.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
I'd be down to that.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
Well, the chat room's here to correct me when I

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
misspeak, and act-deft in chat says

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
it is on the Wii Virtual Console.

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
Mario RPG, I guess, is on the Wii, which you could launch

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
into backwards compatibility

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
mode on the Wii U,

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
which I...

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
That's a whole other thing. No wonder I forgot.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
How convoluted is that? That I have to

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
launch into the Wii backwards compatibility

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
to see the stuff that's on the Wii.

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
It's so crazy that the Wii could run that, but

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
the Wii U, I can't

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
emulate that Super Nintendo game.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Hold on, let me pull out my old ass

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
cell phone that can emulate that

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
game. Just perfectly fine.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Well,

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
back to what I was saying,

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
is that I think that

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
there are going to be people out there who want

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
to get it. For me, I'm not their

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
target audience when it comes to this.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
So, if they put out something

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
and I want it badly enough, then yeah, I'll get it,

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
but chances are, I already

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
have it. This is going to be for the

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
people who didn't hold on to their

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
original consoles, or

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
don't have some of these old games who are,

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
you know, super nostalgic for them.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
Um...

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
I don't think I'm their target

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
audience for this, so...

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
Sometimes, I like the idea

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
of a remake, though. I'm

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
okay with a remake outside

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
of the original, you know what I mean? Like, it doesn't

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
always have to play just like the

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
pure original. Like, I'm okay with a remake once

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
in a while. Now, if they updated and re-released

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
Do Prism, or Threads of Fate,

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
or The Guardian Legend. I'm talking about

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
Squeenix.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
They couldn't

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
redo The Guardian Legend and have it be the same

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
thing. Square Enix could

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
I don't know, give somebody

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
a handy and get the rights to it somehow, come on.

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
I want a sequel that plays the

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
same, but the first game was perfect as it is.

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
It's fair. Alright, well, by the way,

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
trying something new now that Twitter has polling

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
built into it, and I know we can do polls

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
at VOG Network, too, with the live

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
audience, but I thought, oh, I see this feature on

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
Twitter, let's try this. Ask a question

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
in advance, we can gather some responses.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
So, we asked our listeners over at Twitter.com

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
slash OLR before tonight's show,

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
Square Enix saying they plan

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
to remake more old IPs.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
Is this good news or bad news?

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
82% says good news.

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
This is good news. Only 18%

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
saying it was bad news. Thanks to

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
you guys for responding over there. That's

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
a pretty big majority there saying

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
that's good news.

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
I'm fine with it.

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
I understand why people

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
say bad to that. I totally

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
get it, because it takes the resources away from

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
inventing on new stuff, but again,

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
I think once in a while the reimaginings can be

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
pretty good. I don't

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
want them to be on mobile phones.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
A lot of the bad sentiment comes from that.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
There are new things though that Square Enix

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
came up with that have been really good.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
Seriously. Well, don't forget

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
that Square Enix

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
has the IDOS stuff and the stuff that they

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
make here in the States.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
The recent Tomb Raider reboot, for example,

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
one could argue that's

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
a reimagining of a classic IP

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
that worked out very well.

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
Rise of the Tomb Raider is something we're all

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
looking forward to, right?

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Generally, the public is.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
I think that might be an example of

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
where this could be exactly the type of thing they're

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
talking about, right? Taking an old

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
thing and making it

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
relevant for the newer consoles.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
I don't know.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
Just a thought on that.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
To register participation

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
for this week's episode of Orange Under Radio at

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
bognetwork.com, use the passphrase

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
coffee.

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
Dungeon Buster says, also, Square Enix

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
needs money to make new things too.

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Deus Ex and Tomb Raider

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
can't do it alone.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
All right. Well, let's move on

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
to some more news here, and

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
we'll get more of your thoughts here later in the show.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
For now, Dark Soccer.

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
We have some shady business going down at Harmonix.

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Ooh.

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
What happened is

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
that some of the Rock Band 4 developers

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
went onto Amazon

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
and gave their game five-star reviews

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
without identifying themselves as having

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
worked on the game.

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
Three

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
in question were Matthew

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
Nordhaus,

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
Jane Tan, and

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
Chris Foster.

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
Basically gave themselves five-star reviews

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
and just, you know,

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
pretty much said, oh, the game's great.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
We're doing this with our family. Well,

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Harmonix has come back out after they got,

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
you know, outed on Reddit.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
They said,

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
and this is the official statement, that they

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
have clarified their internal policy

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
about posting reviews on our

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
own products on retail sites.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
And we've asked that existing reviews be

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
edited to identify Harmonix employees

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
or be removed entirely.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
Um,

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
so they're like, ugh, they caught us.

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
So, here's a

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
smack done on it. And one of

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
the people who did it, he went

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
on and said, I added the

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
review half in jest, as you might be able to tell

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
from the tone of the original. In hindsight,

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
it's probably important that I know that I worked on the game

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
and worked for Harmonix.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
Um, so

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
they've gone back and said, oops, we

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
are bad. But still,

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
they should have known better. Yeah, I

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
think that's a dangerous thing to

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
mess with. I worry because these people

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
have been, like, individually identified,

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
which kind of sucks for them because I just,

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
I just think of all the crimes

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
in the world you can commit,

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
this is not, I mean, I don't know. And

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
people would be like, Rob, ethics,

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
dah, dah, dah, dah. And I'm like, okay, yeah, but we're

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
talking about Amazon reviews,

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
people. But it's about ethics in

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
video games. Don't. But

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
the thing is, we're not

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
talking about some type of, like, payola

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
thing where,

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
you know, a reputable

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
website published this huge review

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
or whatever. Like, shouldn't you fucking

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
take Amazon reviews with a big

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
grain of salt anyway?

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Like, that's my whole thing, is I'm almost like,

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
I wouldn't, I don't know, I wouldn't take them that

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
seriously. So,

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
I don't know. But I

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
also, at the same time, I see, like,

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
you get in this really dangerous place, you put

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
your company in an odd place when you do something

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
like this, and I worry for

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
those guys, because I think they just did, like,

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
a silly thing, and I would hate, like,

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
now that this is all just being dragged

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
out there, because there's no other gaming news going

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
on, that something, you know, is going to

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
happen to these guys. And I just really hope not, because I just

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
think of all the crimes in the world, is

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
leaving an Amazon review really the

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
biggest breach of ethics you can think of? I

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
don't know. Maybe I'm just, maybe I'm just

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
naive, but I don't pay attention to any of that stuff

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
anyway. It's like Yelp reviews.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
I, I take

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
Yelp reviews with a huge grain of salt,

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
because either people

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
had a bad experience,

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
and they raised the place

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
all the time on Yelp, or

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
they had a good experience, or

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
know the owner, or

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
a friend or family or whatever, and

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
leave a five-star review. There's, like, nothing in the

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
middle. I, you know,

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
I don't know, you can't trust that stuff. You just

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
can't. It's all extremes on one end

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
or the other. I don't know. But

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
also, to be fair to harmonics,

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
I mean,

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
is this really the first or the last

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
time this stuff has happened? I don't

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
think it is. I know it's not the

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
first time, and it definitely won't be the last time.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Because I know we had stuff,

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
wasn't it actually with a Telltale

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
game that came out? Like, there was some positive

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
reviews on Metacritic or something in the user reviews,

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
I want to say.

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
It was one of the ones that was kind of, was it

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Jurassic Park? Or one of the ones that wasn't

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
as well received to see others got

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
some review. I don't remember. Don't quote me

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
on that. But it was something out

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
there I seem to remember.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Going to our chat room over at

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
live.vog.network.com

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
Tigerhonchat says,

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
it's especially bad if the game a developer worked

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
on was bad from the beginning,

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
and they try to put a positive review on it.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Let's see.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Bonds006 says, I was waiting for

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
anti-Yelpers.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Let's see.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Cial says,

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
oh sorry, that was a comment on the

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
last story.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Bonds006 also says, so is that

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
a ban hammer or not for in-house

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
workers? Well, you know Amazon's

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
trying to take, because they want

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
their reviews to be taken seriously, Amazon's

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
trying to take steps

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
kind of against that whole thing. Didn't they come out this

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
week and say they were going to sue people that

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
were leaving, like, they were

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
being paid to leave five star

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
reviews on products? I mean,

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
another reason why you can't trust these reviews

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
in the first place. I don't know.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
I mean, it's not a review, but I know that

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
EA, I think, had told its

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
employees to vote against,

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
it was either EA or

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Comcast that tried to vote against, you know,

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
them as the worst company in America.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Oh, gosh.

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Uh, yeah.

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
You know, I mean, and getting your employees

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
to vote and your friends and stuff to vote, like,

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
I think here locally, I'm sure every

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
town does this. Don't you have some type

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
of newspaper or TV station

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
that does a best of the town

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
type of competition?

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Because I know it happens here in Sacramento. There's some type of, like,

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
best of Sacramento. I don't remember who does

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
it. It's one of the local TV stations,

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
I think. And, like, I've actually

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
gotten a little thing with my

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
receipt that says, vote for us

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
in this competition, dah, dah, dah, dah, and go to this

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
website and vote for us so we can win

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
and all this stuff. So, I mean,

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
it's not that different

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
from the podcast awards, all things

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
considered.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
Anyway.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Uh, Brad from Pod

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Culture, and I think this is probably the right way to do it,

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
says, I always throw out the top

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
and the lowest scores, and I

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
read the middle stuff. It's probably

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
the way to do it. Or, you

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
can really only trust your friends. I think that's

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
another thing for me.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
We'll get into this topic again a little more

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
later on in our FUGL Question of the Week,

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
but for now, let's move on with some more

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
stories. Loki. Alright.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
So, Microsoft is gonna focus now

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
on, primarily,

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Xbox Live usership.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
And I think the reason for this is because not only

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
do they not

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
gonna be kinda struggling a little bit

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
with console sales, but, hey,

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Xbox Live, that could be on, you know,

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Windows and

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
on, you know,

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
the Xbox consoles,

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
maybe even Windows Phone. So, of course,

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
they wanna, you know, strive to have more Xbox

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Live users, you know,

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
maybe more spending that way,

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
and they don't necessarily need to sell

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
the brand new consoles, because, hey, you have got a lot

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
of people who have Xbox 360s still.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
You know, I'm actually

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
finding myself in kind of that predicament where

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
it's like, you know, my Xbox Live

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
membership is running up,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
I think, early next year, and I

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
really haven't played anything on Live

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
that justifies me continuing that, since

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I don't have an Xbox One, so,

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
I'm probably not.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
But, yeah,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
apparently, they're saying that

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
they're not using console

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
shipments as their primary metric

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
for success, but they've,

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
they're focusing more on

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
engagement, leading to choose

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Xbox Live usership as its

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
statistic for that,

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
and basically indicating that

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
they have 39 million Xbox Live

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
users right now.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
And they're trying to get it up.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Usership, I guess, up is

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
up 28%.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Well, I suppose this is a nice

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
way to put a spin on a situation

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
that otherwise might not

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
be all good news for Microsoft.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
I mean, maybe they're kind of,

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
this sounds to me like,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
and you might disagree, but it just kind of sounds

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
to me like they're just kind of,

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
I don't want to say throwing in the towel, but they're kind

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
of admitting that if they keep

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
comparing themselves to Sony PlayStation

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
numbers, that number is looking

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
more and more insurmountable. Or maybe, like,

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
maybe it's just like PR spin

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
for investors type thing, like, oh, well

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
we're not really, it's cool,

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
we're not really competing against you,

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Nintendo, we're not really competing

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
against you, we're on our own

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
thing, we're just going to look at, you know,

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Xbox Live usership,

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
which is way higher, because we've got way more people

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
than PlayStation Plus, that's what they're probably

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
looking at. Well, and to

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
be fair, on the flip side, I mean,

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
yeah, they still make

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
quite a bit of money from Xbox

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Live, I mean, it's what, 50, 60 bucks a year?

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Well, yeah, and think about, you know,

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
manufacturing consoles. Over five years, that's as much

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
as a console. How much are you making per console? I mean, you're

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
probably losing money on each console, so

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
I mean, yeah, might as well

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
have as much usership as you can.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
And the other thing, you know, is, I've

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
been reading that they've been pretty

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
shy on talking numbers

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
of units sold, it's

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
more difficult each time

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
when those NPD numbers come out to see

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
what are you guys selling? Interesting.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Especially now that the new rules

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
were that I don't think they have to even

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
divulge that stuff. Yeah.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
An anonymous

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
chat in our chat, 648

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
says, I'm sticking with the PlayStation 4

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
and the PC at this point.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Maybe that's what

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Microsoft needs to do more of, is

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
how to differentiate themselves more

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
from the PlayStation 4, and I guess, I mean,

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
to be fair, I do feel like that's been

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
a big tone of theirs this year, is really

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
pushing those exclusive

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
games that are only going to

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
be on Xbox One this holiday, like

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
you know, the

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Rare Replay and

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Tomb Raider and

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Halo 5, I keep wanting to say Crackdown

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
but that got pushed back, so not

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Crackdown, but you know,

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Gears of War, that whole thing.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
So, you know, that's what

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Microsoft's kind of trying to do, is how to differentiate

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
themselves. To be fair, their lineup for first party

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
titles is way better than Sony's right now.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
I mean, that's just, this holiday

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
they've knocked it out of the park. Sony,

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
nope, they have

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
not. I mean, they have Uncharted, which

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
that's not even coming out this year. The Uncharted

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Collection, sorry, a collection of old

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
games does not make a blockbuster

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
you know,

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
first party lineup for the holiday. Oh,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
but you've got those exclusives

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
with Destiny and

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
fucking Call of Duty. I'm sorry, that doesn't

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
sell consoles either.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Bonds006

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
in chat says, so these companies who in the past

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
shouted from the hills about

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
MPD stats are now trying to hide

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
underperforming products in a number

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
maze.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Let's see, some comments on the Wii U actually

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
in chat, Dungeon Buster saying

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
I haven't really felt compelled to get an Xbox

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
One yet, but I'm actually leaning

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
more towards a Wii U.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Well, I don't, you know, again, I

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
think, especially now that we're years

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
into the Wii U's cycle,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
there's so many games now that

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
you're missing out on. I honestly, if you're thinking

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
about a Wii U, I might still hold off

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
on that, just because, you know,

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
you're going to invest into a Wii U right now, then all

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
of a sudden, oh hey, NX, fuck the Wii

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
U, we're done with that, you know, because I can see

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
that totally happening, and just

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
maybe give it a few more months until we

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
start hearing the E3 news and kind of see what

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
their plan is with that. Wait for a price drop

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
or E3. Because, yeah, because

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
I'm worried that if you jump in right now,

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
eh, I mean, Zelda's

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
going to be cool, and god, I hope it's still coming out in

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
the Wii U, but like, eh,

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
I don't know. They may

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
try to pull that, you know, shit where

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
they did that with, was it the

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
GameCube and the Wii, you know, oh hey,

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Zelda, it's on the Wii now.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Yeah, a lot of people think that could be

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
where it's headed, we'll see.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Well, anyhow, Xbox Live, you know,

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
for better or for worse, is a place where,

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
you know, you can get called nasty things

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
by all sorts of strangers, and

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
soon, this could be coming to PC. Okay,

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
it's not really the same thing, it's

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
actually a little bit different, but here's the deal.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Blizzard has actually

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
been shown that

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
they are going to be testing some

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
voice chat systems in

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
their Battle.net client.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
So, right now, voice chat

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
is going to be in beta when Overwatch

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
goes into beta testing, which I

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
believe is in days, I think that

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
is on Tuesday, when the Overwatch

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
beta starts, although

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
really only the people in the super special

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
secret Blizzard club are going to be in that at first,

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
and then they'll start rolling that out to more and more

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
people, I'm sure, as time goes on.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
So, Overwatch is going to

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
get those betas, that'll start

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
being streamed on Twitch, for sure.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
That'll be the big, the people that always

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
pimp Blizzard products on Twitch

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
will get those beta keys, so that

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
they start streaming it, and it's all going to be

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
positive, because they're already really into Blizzard stuff.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
So, that'll, you'll see that on Tuesday,

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
probably.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
But, anyhow, as part

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
of the Overwatch beta FAQ,

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Blizzard is calling this new system Battle.net

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
voice chat. So, it's

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
not Overwatch voice chat, it's

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Battle.net voice chat.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
And they say, with voice chat still in its early

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
development and testing stages, it's too

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
early to say which Blizzard games will be

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
supported and when. So, that could

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
be very interesting, because, you know, not only will

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
you possibly be able to talk to each

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
other in Overwatch, but you'll

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
be able to, maybe, I would say

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
if it's a Battle.net voice chat

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
thing, maybe you'll be able to talk to somebody

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
in World of Warcraft, while

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
you're playing Diablo, or something like that.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
You could actually talk across those channels.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Now, something to note,

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
is that

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
World of Warcraft did have

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
voice chat in it, I think still does.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Nobody used it

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
right after it first came out.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
And everybody went back to using TeamSpeak

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
and Ventrilo, or Skype

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
even, than using the built-in.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Why? Because the options on the

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
built-in voice chat were extremely limiting

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
to the point it was useless.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Because you couldn't control volume

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
very well at all. I remember it was very

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
hard to hear. The quality

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
was really bad. I don't know if

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
it was trying to share processing with the

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
game itself, or what, but

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
it just had so many problems.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
So, I hope if they're building this voice

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
chat into Battle.net, maybe it's

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
running on a separate process,

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
or a separate application.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
If I'm playing Diablo with

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
say, Shane or somebody

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
over Skype, and

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
we're both on Skype, and playing Diablo,

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
it's fine. It's a great experience.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
All Blizzard needs to do

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
is to build that Skype-like thing

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
into the Battle.net client, and they'll

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
be fine.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
But that could be interesting. That could also

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
be very doom-impending

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
for TeamSpeak and

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Ventrilo type of stuff, if

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
it takes off very well and is of

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
good quality.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
We'll see.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Let's see, going to our chatroom over at

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
live.vognetwork.com

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
bonds006 says, and there goes

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
the already fucked up PC chatrooms, adding

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
voice. I know where that will go.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
I'm hoping that

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
it's something where you have a lot of control

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
over it, where it's limited to just

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
your friends. Because I would

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
not want to play an Overwatch

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
match at all, and get

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
voice chat. And I have a feeling

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Blizzard doesn't want to go there with it either, because they know

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
what's going to happen if they just enable voice chat.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Because people can be really mean in Heroes

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
of the Storm, for god's sake.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
God, people are so rude in those

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
types of games sometimes.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
I can't imagine they're just going to open up

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
voice chat for everybody. But,

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
if I'm in a party, like let's say

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Grandpa, myself,

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
and Nextifer or something all want to play

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Heroes of the Storm together, we should be able to

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
hit a button and open up

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
a voice chat channel very easy.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Be nice.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Anyway.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Cial from our chatroom says, third-party chat will

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
never die. I suppose I could

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
see where there's still always kind of a use for a

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
third-party chat. When I'm

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
playing Wii U,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
if I'm playing Splatoon on Wii U,

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
I still have to use Skype.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
There's no voice chat there, so

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
I guess that's true. But no, I don't think

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
third-party voice chat will ever die.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
But it'll take a big hit, I think, if some of

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
these games go to it. I don't know. That's what I think.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Anyhow, let's move on. Dark Soccer.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Well,

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
this is probably the big reason

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
why we've seen a lot of crackdown on

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
ads for YouTube. You know,

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
why they've really been trying to get rid of the

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
ad blockers and whatnot. Google

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
announced that YouTube

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Red is coming out, which is an

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
ad-free subscription service

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
for YouTube.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
It will start on the 28th

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
of October for $9.99

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
a month, and will

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
let you watch YouTube without ads.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Meanwhile, some of us

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
who remain unnamed are

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
using the specific

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
ad block for YouTube, and

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
not getting ads either.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
But they're supposed to be doing a 30-day

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
trial right

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
after it launches, so you can see

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
if you like it.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Okay, I mean, you can also play videos

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
in the background while using

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
apps on

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
your smartphone when you're running

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
it through the smartphone app.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
I think that was a really stupid

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
name to pick, because

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
surely you all know about

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
RedTube.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
You're pure and innocent. Have you heard about

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
RedTube?

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
No, but there's more

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
cinnamon buns.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
There are definitely some buns on RedTube,

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
let me tell you. I don't need to know

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
about that, la la la la la. Among other

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
body parts. So I just

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
think that was a really clueless

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
name to pick. But also kind of puts their branding

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
in competition with Brand Red.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Oh, I didn't even think about that.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Interesting.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Well, I've also found

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
it very interesting. I don't know if you guys, either

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
of you, have heard about this. The way they're kind of like

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
strong-arming some of their biggest

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
content creators to basically accept the

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
deal, or if we're

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
going to lock all your videos private

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
and all this shit.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
I don't know how I feel about

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
that. I feel

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
like because YouTube doesn't have a lot

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
of competition in that space, they can

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
kind of get away with that shit.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Because where else are those content creators

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
going to go? Where else are they going to

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
go to put up videos like that

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
on a mass scale to be discovered

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
and make the kind of money they do on YouTube now?

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
And I feel like Google

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
or YouTube kind of knows that

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
and is why they can strong-arm them into

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
this deal, but there's a part of me that feels

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
like, is that

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
totally legal, what they're doing?

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Aren't they kind of begging to be

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
sued?

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
But they probably

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
can't be because I'm sure

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
part of the agreement you make when you

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
agree to cash the check from YouTube is

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
you're not going to sue us over contract

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
change. The other fun thing too is that they're blocking

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
specific games

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
from YouTube as well. So for example,

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
because these

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
companies, I guess, haven't

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
taken the agreement yet

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
in some Japanese companies, games

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
like Attack on Titan, Hatsune

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Miku, Project Mirai 2,

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
BlazBlue Chrono Phantasma,

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
they are not able to be seen

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
in the US. Any videos that get

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
content ID matched for those,

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
they are blocked in the US because

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
the companies that make those games

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
have not taken the deal for YouTube

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Red.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
I just,

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
how can this be legal?

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
I just still do what the fuck

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
they want. But, you know,

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
and now what's interesting is that, you know, Twitch

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
is making more of a play for the on-demand

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
gaming type of stuff.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
So, I mean, some of these games I'm sure you could

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
find on Twitch, no problem.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
I just think it's, like, pretty ballsy of

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
them to say, hey, we're going to offer

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
ad-free, um,

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
ad-free

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
usage for 999 a month and people are like,

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
I just, I've been using

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
an ad block. I don't, maybe

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
it's just me. I, I,

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
would you guys pay for content

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
that you look at on YouTube?

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Because there's a lot of, and I say, I've

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
created YouTubes

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
and I wouldn't want people to have to pay to watch

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
what I've done. Nope. And, and, and, if they're

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
going to try to do this shit where it's like, hey, this

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
PewDiePie's got a fucking exclusive

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
new video series that's behind

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
this paywall of YouTube Red,

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
I guess I'm just never going to see it

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
because that's what's going to end up happening.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Or is someone just going to fucking

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
dump that shit and fucking re-upload it on

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
their channel or, I'm just sorry,

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
it's just, you,

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
you've been giving this out

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
for free for so long,

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
it's going to get pretty hard to give,

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
make people pay for it now.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Imagine if Facebook started charging

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
999 a month for, you know,

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
something. Don't start another copy

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
paste post on everybody's wall. I'm just saying,

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
you know, I'm not paying for this.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Period. I'm not going to pay for it.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
If I don't want to watch ads,

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
then I will just use ad block. I would

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
pay for it if there was something worth paying

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
for. I pay for Netflix

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
because they've got some fucking

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
great original series that you can

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
watch very conveniently and easily.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Orange is the New Black, I mean, the new

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
season aside, the first two seasons were really good.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
I, Sense8 was

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
fucking amazing.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Gracie and Frankie or whatever that

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
show is called with the broads from 9 to 5.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
I like that show a lot.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
And, you know, there's a lot of really

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
good Netflix original stuff, so I

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
don't mind paying for that stuff. But now this pool

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
is getting really diluted because everybody wants

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
money for their content,

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
but it's like, you know, you've got to have

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
really good exclusive content for me.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Yeah, exactly. And that's the thing, too, is like...

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
I would not fucking pay for

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
PewDiePie and Tyler

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
Oakley and The Drunk Chef.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
I'm not going to pay for that.

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
I have no problem with them doing their thing. That's fine.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
But, like, I'm kind of,

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
I'm not worried for them, but, like, they're

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
literally making it difficult to

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
do their thing on YouTube.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Now they're making them sign these deals

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
to be on this, you know, YouTube Red type stuff.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Game companies

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
are being blocked from having their content

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
on the service. Other game companies

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
are fucking blocking people from using it

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
or taking their ad revenue because

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
they want to do their shit. It's like, it's

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
getting so fucking complicated.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
This is great for indies.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
I'm telling you that much because indie guys are like,

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
what the fuck is going on? Just play my game.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
I would love it if you played my game. I'm not going to

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
do anything. You play my game? Cool.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
We're done. That's it. You know what would have

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
shut YouTube up is if these

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
big creators, their bread

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
and butter, the creators,

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
had banded together and said,

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
no, shove it.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Like, we're going to go to this

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
other site unless you give us

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
a better deal type of thing or, you know, you give

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
the user more freedom. They really should have, but unfortunately

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
that didn't happen. We're going to go to this other site.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Which site? Yeah, which site?

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Somebody in chat said Daily Motion, but it's just,

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
I know that's a video site, but it's not, you know,

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
I don't know, it's not the kind of thing, but now is the time

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
for those types of sites to strike.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Somebody could make,

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
you know, these big creators an offer

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
and possibly siphon some of the content. But the Content ID,

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
though, it's just, it's greed by this publisher,

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
by these publishers. I mean,

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
and don't get me wrong, I think it's cool to

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
protect artists' rights

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
and stuff like that, but that's not what they're doing.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
They're just protecting publisher

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
rights and wanting to be able to

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
sell that content at a premium.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Instead of like, hey,

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
this song was licensed for this video game

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
and it just happens to be in the background

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
of this video of the video game because

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
it's part of the video game.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
Oh, but let's copyright strike these because

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
god damn it, you didn't license that

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
song to be played on your channel.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
It's way too complicated. It shouldn't be this complicated.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Bonds006 in chat says,

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
the companies that once all supported

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
CISPA are now getting forced to

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
their knees by YouTube.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
YouTube will now be the new grandfather

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
of online free media.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
So.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Bonds006 says

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
YouTube already has them by the balls. It's YouTube's way

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
to get the fuck out. And I know I've called this out

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
before, as I'm sure a lot of you guys have too,

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
as part of the problem with YouTube

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
is that there isn't, this is why

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
competition, and I'm not usually

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
the type to get up there and go like

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
rah rah rah capitalism.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
But in this such

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
of a narrow, and don't get me started on political

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
stuff, don't read too much into what I just said.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
When we don't have

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
any type of competitor for YouTube

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
that competes with them on that level,

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
this is what happens.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
You know what I mean? Like this is why there needs

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
to be that type of competition and this is why

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
and I've kind of said this about

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Twitch too, right? Twitch was so

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
dominant that, you know, when

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
their rules went into place, they needed some competition

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
to get them worried. Enter YouTube,

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
ironically enough,

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
to kind of mix that up a little bit. And I think

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
really, based on what we've been hearing out of TwitchCon

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
TwitchCon and all this stuff, it's making Twitch

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
better, because they're having to

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
you know, make sure that they involve themselves

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
to make themselves the better option. And I

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
really want to see the same thing happen to YouTube.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
And from a gaming standpoint, maybe

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
that will happen, is that these games that are blocked

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
from YouTube, well shit on the PlayStation 4,

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
you're one button press from going over to Twitch.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Well it's just like the YouTube gaming stuff.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
I've never launched the YouTube gaming app.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
I don't fucking care.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
I can find gaming videos just fine on YouTube.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Like,

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
how could you not find gaming videos

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
on YouTube? That's impossible.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
I don't understand

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
how people are having such a difficult

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
time in finding gaming videos

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
that they need to create a separate app for that.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
It's just like,

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
I don't get it. It's like,

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
shit, I can't find any cat pictures

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
on Reddit. If only we had a separate

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Reddit for cats.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
I think there is a separate Reddit for cats.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
I'm sure there is, but I'm just saying that

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
it's impossible to not

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
like, this was never, you

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
came up with a solution for a problem that didn't

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
exist, is what it is.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Isn't that called capitalism?

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
It's not capitalism.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
It's just, it's useless.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
It's just like, the whole thing was that they were trying to compete with Twitch.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Just like capitalism. I would say

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
that's more the other extreme end

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
of it, right? When the corporations are people,

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
right? We know what you want.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
How many times has

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
that been nails on a chalkboard to you?

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
When a gaming company gets up there and goes,

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
this is what the gamers want.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
They want microtransactions and all this other stuff,

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
and you're like, fuck a whole lot of you.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
Because that's so, like you're

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
sitting there going, no, it is not what I want, actually.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
What gamers want is for you to get your head out of your

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
ass and actually look around.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
The fucking end.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
It's not about what you want, it's about what we

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
want. And if we don't want what you're

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
doing, we're gonna go somewhere else. And you know what

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
gamers want? Fuckery.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Another fucking Super Mario RPG.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
That is what gamers want.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
So if that is not what you're

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
bringing me, get off the stage.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
You know what we want?

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
What? Zillion three.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
What do we want?

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Guardian Legends sequel. When do we want it?

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Now. Yesterday.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
SSG100 Matt says, someone

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
needs the capital and the infrastructure to handle

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
a massive amount of data like YouTube.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
On top of that, said business

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
needs to find profit in that.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Where is the immediate profit in a YouTube competitor?

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
You know what though, guys?

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
YouTube

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
didn't start in a day

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
and Facebook started somewhere.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
And MySpace looked like

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
it was never gonna go away. You know who's evil enough to compete

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
with Google? Facebook.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
They've got the capital,

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
they've got the resources. Unfortunately

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
it wouldn't be very good, but

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
I'll take competitors

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
as long as they're competing. Maybe that'll fix

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
something.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Alright.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Anyhow, let's move on. Maybe they

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
can come up with their own service and they'll be called

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
F-Tube.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Yeah?

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Yeah, F-Tube?

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
release dates and some video games that you

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
may or may not be streaming to YouTube, but pretty soon.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Release dates for games.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Loki. Starting in the US.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
So this week we've got

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Divinity Original Sin Enhanced Edition

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
coming out on Playstation 4 and

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Xbox One.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
A game called Halo 5 Guardians.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
That's coming out on Xbox

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
One this week. Also the Limited

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Edition. Fuck, is that

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
really this week? That is this week.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
That is Tuesday. I feel

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
like I have to

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
buy it, but I don't

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
want to because I've got all these other games I need to be.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Then don't buy it right now. But it's Halo.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
You can buy it, just not right now.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
I gotta...

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
I need it.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
What kind of gamer am I

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
if I don't own the newest thing?

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Rob.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Can you eat Halo 5?

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Can you breathe it?

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
How much barbecue sauce can you

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
drink it? Technically, does it put a roof over your

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
head? Technically, you can

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
eat Halo 5. Oh wait, no, that's Call of Duty

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Black Ops 3, I'm thinking. Sorry.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
They're doing a promotion with

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Carl's Jr. apparently for that.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
If I duct tape a lot of the discs

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
together, I could make a box

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
to live in out of Halo 5.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Don't fucking challenge

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
me, woman. It's not needed for survival.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
You could hollow out an original Xbox

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
and could have a family of four live in that,

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
but you know, that's not...

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Anyways, so Minecraft

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Story Mode, the season pass disc

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
is coming out as well. If you want

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
to just jump into all of

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
those episodes, that's on

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4,

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Xbox 360, and Xbox One.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
WWE 2K6

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
coming out on PlayStation 3,

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, and

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Xbox One as well.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Lords

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
of the Fallen complete edition.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
That'll be the following week, actually.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
And

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
that'll be it.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
OK, so Alan Alchemy in chat

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
said I had to show Jamie what he bought

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
this week. Speaking of, I want

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
it. I need it. Look at this.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Yeah. Mass Effect Monopoly

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
something he bought this week.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Although, doesn't that look like it's based on

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Mass Effect 2? Kind of. Yeah.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
But yet, it

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
says copyright 2015, so I guess

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
it's newer. I did miss one. Dark

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Ciders 2, the definitive

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
edition coming on PlayStation

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
4 and Xbox One.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Just in time for Halloween.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Also, MX vs ATV Supercross

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Encore on PlayStation 4.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
And do you know

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
why he bought Monopoly Mass Effect?

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Because it was there. Yeah, because he fucking wanted it.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Cue the American flag and the theme.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
I

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
honestly, I knew about it, and

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
I hate playing Monopoly.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
I really hate playing Monopoly.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
I don't even play

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
all the five other different collector's

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
versions of Monopoly that we have. Yeah,

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
but this has a space hamster as one of

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
the tokens. You know what?

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
IDGAF.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
I

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
might have gotten the Mass Effect

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
risk, but

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
I'm not...

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
That's kind of expensive. I didn't

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
care.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
I'm actually

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
really getting a lot more into Dragon Age

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
than Mass Effect until Andromeda

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
comes out. Until Andromeda's out, yeah.

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
So, I'm content.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Fair enough.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Alright, let's go over to Japan and check out

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
some of the releases in Japan this week. God Eater

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Resurrection on the PlayStation 4,

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
a regular and a crossplay pack.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Also, NBA 2K16

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
makes its way to Japan, getting

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
its release on the 29th.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
Heading over to

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
the Wii U, I think, is still kind of

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
dry this week. They get Lego

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
Jurassic World on November 5th, but that's

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
still a couple weeks away. On the

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Vita this week, I would expect that we'll probably

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
see God Eater over there, too. Yep,

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
we sure do, because that's that crossplay.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Alias Carnival, Sacrament

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
is out this week.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
Heart no Kuni, no Alice Wonderful

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Twin World, a new version. Also,

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
Love Revenge, regular and

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
limited edition, Raishi,

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
and Yomawari. Those are

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
all Vita releases.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
More than any other system I'm going to read this week.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Like, that was like, what, one, two, three,

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
four, five, six releases

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
on the Vita this week in Japan.

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
It is such a different story.

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
It just blows my mind.

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
On the Nintendo 3DS this week

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
over in Japan,

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
looks like actually nothing

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
on the 3DS this week. There's some new

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
cases, but that's really it.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Otherwise, Disney Magic Castles,

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
which you have to look forward to in two weeks.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
But, you know, they love

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Disney in Japan almost as much as we

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
love it here, so Disney releases are a pretty big deal

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
over there, too. Alright,

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
let's go to the UK, Dark Sakura.

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
On the 27th, we have Darksiders

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
which is attached to the Death

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Initive edition.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
I'm sorry, I'm full of

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
pumpkin cinnamon roll.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
It's coming on PlayStation 4

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
and Xbox One.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
We have Halo 5 Guardians for Xbox One

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
and WWE 2K16

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
on everything else.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
On the 30th, Lands End comes out on

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Android and Shin Megami Tensei

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Devil Survivor 2

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
on 3DS.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
And I'll go ahead and say it on the 31st,

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
we have Five Nights at Freddy's 4, the final

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
chapter.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
On PC. In the UK.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Oh, I was like, wait a minute.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
I was like, I had to look at it again, because

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
I was like, didn't you guys get that too?

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
I guess not.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
But don't we get that, isn't that RPG

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
a Halloween thing in the US? I think it is.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
I felt like that was what was being targeted.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
Maybe.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Alright.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
This looks like the same shit we got.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Alright, well moving on,

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
game of the week.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
By the way, AkumaJP in chat says

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
I am not kidding. You can get murdered

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
if you say bad things about Disney here.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
I

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
wish it was like that here.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
No, I'm just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
But, yeah, no,

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
here, here we have to defend

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
ourselves for being big kids

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
when we're too into Disney a little bit.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
I don't know, I think actually it's a lot less.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
I think everybody in

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
their 30s and 40s kind of grew up with

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
all that, so it's kind of less

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
than probably what it used to be. Fuck that,

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
I didn't get to.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
It was still around you.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
It was on the gummy bears on TV

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
and stuff. But I didn't get to go to Disneyland

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
or Disney World even.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
And I think, honestly, neither did I.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
And I did watch Song of the South at least six times in a row

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
as a kid. I think we made up for lost time.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
I think that's what happened with me in Disneyland.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
That's what I have a feeling of.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
And by the way, the reason why I bring that up is because

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
it was in Alabama and we

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
did have Song of the South on

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
VHS. Now

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
that you can't find it at all anywhere.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
So, of course, I

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
also lived where the Black Cauldron was

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
also banned. Oh

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
jeez, Black Cauldron is like one of those like

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
and it's butchered up anyway. If it had

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
been like the full thing, that

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
would have been badass. Well, it was

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
most of the fairy tales

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
are kind of butchered up. I mean, in Cinderella

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
didn't they chop the

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
superstitious foot off? Yeah, she cut

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
off her toes. Yeah, they didn't do that in Cinderella.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
But in the Black Cauldron, they actually

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
had more footage

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
that they cut out to make it less

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
dark. And it made

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
the story not make sense. Because Island

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Wii was great. I thought of you today and I

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
probably shouldn't be saying this now because you'll probably go, gee, thanks

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
for telling me. But I heard that Don Bluth

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
was at some convention here in Sac today. Yeah, I know about that.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
Okay, you knew. Yeah, it was like Sac Con

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
I thought of you when I saw that because I was like

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
what Don Bluth stans do I know? Oh, Jamie.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Well, because Don Bluth

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
before he had his major studio

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
animated the

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Don't Walk Away scene in Xanadu.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
I should have had a copy of Dragon's

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Lair autographed. That would have been

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
cool. I would have just taken

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
my copy of Xanadu.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Here, sign this.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
I'm the one that likes it. Legit.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Me and three other people.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Alright.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Let's see. Loki.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Alright, so

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
oddly enough

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
Vivendi has been investing

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
quite a bit in Ubisoft.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
They made, I guess,

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
161 million dollar

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
investment last week and now another

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
111 million dollars

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
this week. And I guess

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
because of that, the

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
stock went up from

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
6.6% to

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
10.39%.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
But

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
of course, it's kind of making them a little bit

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
uneasy. Basically,

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
the CEO

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Yiz Gamat

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
basically said that the investment is

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
unsolicited and unwelcome.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
And, you know, they're

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
not sure what exactly

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
their intention is on purchasing

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
all this stock. It was like a hostile

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
takeover, you know, what the case may be

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
in that. But

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
yeah, interesting to see. I know

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
recently what Activision

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
had to pay a bunch of money just to get rid of

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Vivendi off of

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
their books, basically.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
So now the

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
alien is looking for another creature

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
to suck dry.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
Look out!

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Alright.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
One more story for you guys.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
It's about sports games, which I don't talk about

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
a lot on this show. But, you know,

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
it's an important part of what drives

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
the industry and sells

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
consoles and so forth. And if you weren't

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
aware, there's some really interesting stuff

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
going on in the basketball world.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
You know, 2K

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
Games makes

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
an NBA series. They have

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
the NBA 2K series.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
And EA has their own NBA Live series.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
And if you weren't aware, NBA

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
Live last year was not

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
good. In fact, it was

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
really bad. Well, NBA Live was like

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
postponed for a few years because it

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
originally leaked out even. They put it

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
out and then pulled it back really fast.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
And someone had bought one of those versions

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
and it was just shit.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
And then they took a couple years

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
off to fix it and then

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
released it and it was still shit. And then

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
the following year, well, it's better this year.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Still shit.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
Well, both these basketball games came out

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
this past month and

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
NBA 2K actually

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
sold 1 million units.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
NBA 2K16 sold a million units.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
It came out in the middle of the month. Biggest

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
selling sports game launch this generation.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
So, I mean, huge launch.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Did very well.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
EA's NBA Live sold

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
8,000

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
units.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
Oh, shit. Compared to 1 million.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
Yeah, that ain't coming back.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Only

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
8,000

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
people in the entire

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
country. See, Square Enix, this

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
right here is a disappointment in sales.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
Not 3 million from Tomb Raider.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
8,000. You know

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
which game sold more than 8,000

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
units? Earth Defense Force

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
fucking sold more than 8,000 units.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
I think President Cat sold more

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
units than this game did.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
That's something.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
And, you know, if you think about it, like,

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
you know, either

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
it's just that 2K has established themselves

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
as this dominant franchise and people are like,

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
I don't need two basketball games. I got this one.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
Or, it's just

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
the EA's kind of

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
what the series has done before this.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
The reputation just, it's ruined.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
It's absolutely ruined and people don't.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
And it's bad because NBA 2K, I think, has done some

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
shit recently that's been kind of like,

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
eh, you know.

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
I don't follow too much. I know that

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
they're live scanning. The face scanning

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
thing's not working out, but it never has.

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
I

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
don't know. But, yeah, the point,

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
you only have two options, really.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
I think they should just get, I don't

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
know how long into that exclusive deal that

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
NBA, or, I don't even

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
know if NBA works that way if they have, like, an

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
exclusive deal between those two companies or if

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
other companies can make NBA games.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
I hope that they didn't pay for a long

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
licensing

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
period because, eh, it's not going to work out.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Well, but, you know, they're swimming

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
in buckets of money because of Madden, so.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Well, yeah, but, I mean, they could be

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
having more buckets of money if their game didn't

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
suck.

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
That is very true.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
Alright. Let's

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
take a trip down memory lane, you guys.

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Dark Soccer's going to step into the gaming vault

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
and find a game

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
that she thinks, hey, you guys should be

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
playing this this week. We're going to go back

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
to a time when the only basketball

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
game that mattered was Double Dribble.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
And I had low standards. Remember

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
when Konami fucking made

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
games like Double Dribble?

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Maybe we'll get Double Dribble Pachinko someday.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Alright. Moving on,

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Dark Soccer's going to step into the gaming vault and find a game she

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
thinks, hey, you should play this this week.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
You, you dumb kid.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Alright. What is the classic

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
game of the week, Dark Soccer?

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Super high impact.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Now, I have to say

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
why I picked this game.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
I was like, did we go all sports ball this week? What happened?

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
My brothers and I played the shit

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
out of this game. And we

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
we would, there's like this little guitar

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
thing that plays after you pick your play.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
We used to make that sound

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
like we were growling at each other.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
And we used to try to, like, tackle each other

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
until the other person would explode.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
This game is so over the top.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
And it was actually one of the

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
precursors to the NFL

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Blitz series. You remember how

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
kind of oddball that one was.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Anyway, super high

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
impact. It was the sequel

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
to High Impact. This one

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
came out by Midway in 1991.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
And

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
it was just a football game running

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
on a JAMA harness.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
And it had one button

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
and an 8-way joystick. Ooh.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Um, so anyway, with this

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
particular game, you had

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
a, basically your button

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
was like, your pass, your

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
action, your, all of

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
this, you know, it was the

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
one way to decide what happened. Which I

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
honestly didn't care for that so much on the arcade one.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Which I did play that a few times.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Um.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
But the thing about this

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
one, it was just really over

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
the top. Um.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
You could tackle

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
somebody until they would

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
explode into a mass of body parts.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
You had

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
the hit meter or something.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
What was it called? It was

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
the hit-o-meter, the

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
whack-o-meter or something.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
And so you'd get, uh,

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
like a thumbs up or a

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
you know, a rank like awesome

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
if you sacked somebody

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
badly enough. It was just really over the top.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
And like,

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
they'd say little insults at each other

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
before each play and everything. It was

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
just, just really a silly

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
game. Um.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
But it was, actually for me, who's always

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
hated football, it was

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
a fun game. It was just really

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
fun. It was easy to play. You could

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
pick your, your plays and everything.

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
And, now the version that

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
I had was the Super Nintendo

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
version that, in my, and now

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
that I recall this,

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
it really did keep

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
a lot of stuff from the

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
arcade version. Maybe not some of the

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
digitized, uh,

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
characters that were in it.

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Like some of the pop-up people that would show up.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Like the manager or the referee.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
They were all

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
I switched to the Super Nintendo version.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Uh, audio here.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
They were all like, you know, pixel people. They weren't, you know,

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
actually, uh,

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
rendered. Um, but it

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
really had a lot of the same stuff.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
It had really clean

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
graphics for a Super Nintendo

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
sports game. And it

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
was pretty fun.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
See, there's somebody going in

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
until they explode. Um,

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
and then,

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
oh, here's this,

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
this is, it was just a fun game. That's the only thing I can

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
say about it. The Super Nintendo and

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Genesis version came out

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
in 1993 and

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
it was put out by,

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
you know, I had it in

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
here and I don't have it now.

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Um, I want to say it was put out by Acclaim.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
That was it.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
That's the, what is it called, the hit meter?

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Yeah. So, um,

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
I'll just leave it there. It, you know,

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
it paved the way for the NFL Blitz

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
series, which was, you know, another one

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
in the same line. And

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
that's it.

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
We just don't have

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
fun games like that. You know, sports games

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
like that. They all take themselves too seriously.

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
We need more sports games where people explode into body parts.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Exactly, or you get

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
something else. Or like in Blades

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
of Steel where it was all about the fighting

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
sub-game where two people get in a fight. You need

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
the over the top, I mean, like now what we

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
have, Mutant League and what was the

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
other football game that's out on Steam right

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
now? Um, you know,

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
they just don't have that fun anymore.

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Right.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Alright there, touchdown!

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
But that's

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
the SNES version. It has all the same stuff

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
from the arcade version. Yeah. Um,

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
you know, a little, a little,

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
uh, I'd say, uh,

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
panned down, but not, you know, not that bad.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
And the sad thing is, is that, I

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
tried to find more information about

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
this game and it really, I guess,

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
kind of fell off into obscurity.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Um, not too many people, I guess,

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
cared about it. But for me,

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
like I said, I hate football.

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
I hate football games. I love this fucking

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
game. So, that's it.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Uh, super high impact. There it is, your

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
classic game of the week. Super high impact.

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Uh, Dark Tetsuya's Blitz is definitely one of my

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
favorite sports games ever. As

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
200 Matt says, super high impact is the XFL

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
of football games. Yes!

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Without being a bad business

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
decision.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
Alright.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
Well that is gonna do it

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
for this first part of, uh,

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
Orange Lounge Radio. But don't go anywhere

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
guys, cause we have plenty more show to come

username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
We're gonna talk about rapid fire news

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
tonight, uh, some LucasArts,

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
some Grand Theft Auto, and some beer.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
We'll do all of that when we come

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
back with more after this break of

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
Welcome back everybody

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
to Orange Lounge Radio

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Live tonight, October

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
the 25th of 2015 with episode

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
619 of our show

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
already in progress. We're gonna get back

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
into some news here, uh, in a bit.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
First though, I thought, uh, I thought you guys would get

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
a kick out of, um, my story about

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
what I did yesterday. So I went on

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
another, uh, adventure with my

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
friend Shane, which, you know, he's been on the show

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
before. He's not here this week, but he was on the past couple weeks.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
And, uh, we decided randomly, we were

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
gonna take a trip to Chico yesterday, which, um,

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
Chico's a town, it's a college town, it's

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
about two hours north of here where we tape our show

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
in Sacramento. And I actually lived

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
there for like three years, cause I went to school at Chico

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
State. And, um, that's actually

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
where the radio station there was where I first

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
got into this whole thing. So, uh, there's that.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
But, uh, we went there

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
for a couple reasons. A,

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
I wanted Mongolian

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
BBQ at a place up there I hadn't

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
eaten at in like over a decade.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
And it's still as good as I remember it, just for the record.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Um, so it was totally

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
worth it. Uh, and then B,

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
uh, we thought we'd do some

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
Ingress up there cause I wanted some

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
unique portals from places I hadn't been yet

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
and Shane is playing more and more.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
So we decided to go play at a graveyard over there.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
But C, the most important

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
uh, thing is that we were also

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
uh, kinda doing some of the shopping.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Uh, cause you know, uh, Shane

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
he's talked about his Power Ranger

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
uh, addiction here on the show

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
and the toys and stuff that he buys with that.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Um, and so we had not

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
gone to the stores in Yuba City, which is

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
on the way. Yuba City's like halfway there. And then

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Chico is like fully north. So we went to the store

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
in Yuba City in Chico. And

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
uh, there's something about that Toys R Us

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
in Chico. I don't know if we happen to have any listeners

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
up there, but I gotta say that Toys R Us is like

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
trapped in a time machine somehow.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
And Shane got really excited when he saw

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
that at this Toys R Us

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
they still had like in their

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
aisle with video games. Like had the

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
PS4 games. They had like the laminated

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
one sheet. And you'd have to

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
take the pull slip if you wanted the game

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
and actually go take it up to the front

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
counter cause I don't know how long

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
the Toys R Us got rid of that. But for some

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
reason the store that's trapped in time

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
still had that. And on top of

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
all that stuff, believe it or not, they had

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
one of the toys that Shane was missing

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
at this Toys R Us that time

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
forgot two hours north of

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
Major Metropolis. So you better take me

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
there. And they had

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
tons of amiibo. That's where I saw

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
the Animal Crossing amiibo cards. I was like

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
should I get some for Jamie cause

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
I'm not gonna play that game. And then I

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
just saw, I saw like

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
easily like 40 Shulk amiibo.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
I mean I already have one at this point but

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
there was easily like 40 Shulk amiibo

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
like in all the I guess

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Toys R Us. Why didn't you bring me one? I didn't know

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
you wanted one. I kind of

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
don't wanna buy one. There you go.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
I did and

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
bring you back to video games. I did end up

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
getting amiibo for myself. So I got

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
the blue and pink yarn Yoshi

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
to finish my collections. I have all three yarn

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Yoshis cause they're kinda cute.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
And I finally got an adult link

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
cause believe it or not I didn't have one cause

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
I was really mad at amiibo when they first came out.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
And now that I'm finally getting over it

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
I wanted to go back and get some of the ones

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
I missed out on. So I actually found

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
a link thank God still

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
at one of these stores that time forgot so I was able to

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
buy it. So there you go.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Going to our chatroom

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
over at live.vognetwork.com

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
Tigerclaw in chat says

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
speaking of Power Rangers, the Power Rangers movie

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
just cast an Asian actor as the Black Ranger

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
and a Black actor for the Blue Ranger.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
I think yeah, I think they're

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
trying to be kinda diverse in their casting

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
of the folks which is cool.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
I think kids want to see themselves represented

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
in the Power Rangers so why not?

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
Sounds fun.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Let's see. Also going to

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
I think they're just talking about

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
amiibo in chatroom

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
and finding the different amiibo out there.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Somebody recommending that PodCulture

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
joins a local amiibo group.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Brad from PodCulture

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
saying he just picked up a link online.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Is that local group like an

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
amiibo anonymous?

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Yeah, amiibo addicts anonymous. Something like that.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
Probably.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
I guess I need to join. I think I'm up to

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
37 amiibo. It's pretty gross.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
Like, Loki, you could bring your Wii U

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
back and I would have more stuff for you to

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
unlock. Yeah, I haven't

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
played Mario Maker this week.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
I need to bring yours over to my house, Rob.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Yeah? Yeah. I can do that.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Please do that and then we can hang out. There we go.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
It'll be fun. I just need a carrying case.

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
And of course, I'll leave it to Bobby Blackwolf

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
to storm into the chatroom and make the

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
mandatory comment that goes with that.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
37 amiibo? In a row?

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
You know what's sad is that

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
reference is getting more and more dated.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Didn't that movie come out in like 1997

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
or something? Like, it's...

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
That reference is getting dated.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
Don't buy any amiibo on the way out.

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
Oh god, it was 1994.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Try not to

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
buy any amiibo on your way out to the parking lot.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Alright, let's go over some

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
rapid fire news.

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Some quick gaming headlines this week. Loki.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
So this actually made me pretty excited.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
The fact that they're going to be bringing back

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
Day of the Tentacle, which I think was one of the

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
greatest LucasArts

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
games that they kind of

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
did a sequel to, you know, kind of when they started

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
doing the new games.

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
I love that game. And actually, the...

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Not really a remake.

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
I guess it's more of a remaster.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
The remaster looks nice. There's not a whole

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
ton of difference other than it's not pixelated.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
So, I mean,

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
it's a good game, so I definitely would recommend

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
checking it out when it comes out.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
They don't really have a

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
date yet when it's coming out, but apparently

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
you would have been able to check it out earlier

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
this week, or last week,

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
during Indicade, which was at

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
LA, and they were running a

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
preview build of that, so...

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Pretty cool. And I'll be coming out

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
later on. And then

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
with this, Rockstar

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
is adding some new

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
modes to Grand Theft Auto online,

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
including their Lowrider

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
update, which

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
allows you to do all sorts of cool customization

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
of Lowriders and stuff. It's starting

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
to get to

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
kind of what they had in San Andreas,

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
where you can do all the

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
different

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
hydraulics and that kind of fun stuff.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
But they're going to be

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
adding some new adversaries.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
I guess

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Keep the Pace

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
is a new game. I guess it's sort of similar

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
to Speed, the movie, where

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
you have to stay above the minimum velocity or you

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
explode, which is awesome.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
Offense Defense, which is an

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
asymmetrical mode, with people

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
running towards the end of a route, while

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
protectors are trying to stop them.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
That kind of sounds actually

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
like the...

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
What was that one that... It was like the...

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
The jet game

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
we played in there was really fun, where

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
there's... That was one of my favorite

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
modes in Grand Theft Auto online.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
I can't remember what the hell it's called now, but

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
you have people running

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
to get to the end of this

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
checkpoint, and there's

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
people in jets firing at you.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
It's awesome. It's so

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
intense. I really need to go back and play

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
that. And then, of course, they also

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
have a new scene creator with

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Rockstar Editor. It allows you to set

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
up different scenarios. You can place props

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
from a catalog of more than 200, and

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
save four settings for

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
different scenes and stuff

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
like that. So, awesome.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
Have that check it out.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
And let's see...

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
Last but not least, Tony Hawk,

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
Pro Skater 5. What a mess that

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
shit was. And you may

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
remember that it's also supposed to be coming out

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
on the last gen systems.

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Supposed to have been sometime

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
in November. However,

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
they're putting it on an

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
indefinite hold. Maybe

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
because they're making their money

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
back with that game, and

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
they're saying, we're working closely with

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
our developers to address the issues identified

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
by the community, like everything.

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
Our development resources

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
are fully focused on fixing the content

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
updates for PlayStation 4 and

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
Xbox One, so we have decided to delay the

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
release of the PlayStation 3 and

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
Xbox 360 versions. Yeah, probably because your

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
game's still broken, so you probably want to fix it before you

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
put out the game.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
We will update the community when we have more information

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
about the release date. If there's a release date.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
I don't think there's much of a point at this point

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
to releasing the last gen. I don't think

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
they're going to release it. Yeah, I think it's going to go the way

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
the Mortal Kombat had to do the same thing.

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
Mortal Kombat was a fine game.

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Yeah, it was fine.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
They had to

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
compromise too much to get it to run on the old

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
systems, I bet. Anyhow,

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
speaking of having to compromise some things

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
to get it to work, Batman

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
Arkham Knight on the PC.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:02.000
It's finally happening. That's right.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
Batman Arkham Knight on the

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
PC coming out on October

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
28th. That will be at 10 AM Pacific

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
time, re-released for the

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
PC. There will also be a patch at that time

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
that brings the PC version fully up to

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
date with content that has been released

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
for console, with the exception of any

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
console exclusives.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
So, that only took, what, like

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
four months for them to fix all the issues?

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
So, hmm.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
Well, at least they fixed it,

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
I guess. Better late than never.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
Hey, as we mentioned in the top

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
of the show, in Jason's intro,

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
Back to the Future week was this week, and there

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
was some little things that

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
happened in celebration on the 21st,

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
including in Rocket League,

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
which I always forget to mention

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
this in my gaming week, but usually once a week

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
I get invited to play in some Rocket League game,

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
just randomly online, and that game is

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
always a lot of fun. And so

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
in Rocket League, there is a

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
DeLorean that you can now drive

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
around in the game. It's available

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
for $1.99 on Steam

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
and the PlayStation 4.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
The tires apparently flip up in

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
the car as well, so that's

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
cute. Also,

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
you may remember there was a

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
reference to the game Wild Gunman.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
You remember that game was one of the

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
laser games? That was actually in

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
Back to the Future Part II, because it was

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
something that, as part of the plot,

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Marty kicked ass

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
at the game. Yeah, Cafe 80s, right?

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
So they actually,

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
in a tongue-in-cheek sort of way,

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
in Europe, they released

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
the Wild Gunman

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
version to

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
Wii U Virtual Console in Europe. I don't know why

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
we didn't get it here, but they got it over

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
there in Europe. Dude, it would be awesome if they made

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
a Cafe 80s in that style

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
of Back to the Future II, just like all that

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
retro futuristic shit. Patent

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
pending. That would be awesome. Don't we

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
have that in the form of coin-op downtown

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
except a bar? No, but I'm talking about

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
with the fucking TV monitors and shit

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
with fucking Ronald Reagan. Loki won't say

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
that he wants the fashion.

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
He wants the fashion from Cafe

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
80s. You know who does not?

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Me, because I paid a lot of money in

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
Aquanet, okay? Hey, but

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
hey, you can buy those Nike shoes soon

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
for $9,000. Yeah, fuck that.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
No one's buying that shit.

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
Well, it'll be a lot cheaper

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
to get a hoverboard in

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
Star Trek Online, that is.

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
Unfortunately, it's only until October 26th.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
I don't know why this is a limited time thing,

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
but just before they roll out season

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
11 in Star Trek Online,

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
you can get a hoverboard.

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
That's totally not canon.

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Yeah, I know, but they

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
made it kind of look like it.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
It says Flyer

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
Future or something on it. They made it

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
just different enough, but I think it's a cute

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
little wink and nod to Back to the Future.

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
So, there it is.

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
So, you can check that out in Star

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
Trek Online, but you better hurry before tomorrow.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
Alright, also

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
of very important news, you know we gotta

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
update you on Splatfest

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
here at OLR.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
We don't, because they inform you of that

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
shit every time we fucking log into that game.

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
Well,

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
anyway, the next Splatfest

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
is happening on October 30th,

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
beginning 9 o'clock. I don't know who's gonna

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
play in this, because everybody's gonna be busy on Halloween.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
But, here it is, you guys.

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Pirates versus

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
Ninjas.

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
This is, uh, it's a pretty big

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
debate. The epic battle.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
The battle to end all battles. I can't

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
pick. I don't know which team to pick.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
I really don't. I'm leaning

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
Team Ninja solely because

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
they have a better color. They have the purple and the ninjas

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
or, I'm sorry, the pirates kind of have that

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
yucky green. But,

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
I do really like to pirate music.

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
So, I feel like, you know, we should show some

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
piracy pride. And Weebl and Bob had the

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
pirate ninja. But you'd like to not get

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
caught by the companies pirating the music

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
so you have to act like a ninja. So you have to act like a ninja

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
when you do it. That's true. That's very true.

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
But, Disney has the Pirates

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
of the Caribbean ride.

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Then again, there was that movie,

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
Three Ninjas. I don't know. I just, I can't decide.

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:58.000
I can't decide.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.000
You have to

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
figure out which one's going to be

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
not as popular

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
because the least

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
popular one always wins. Pirates.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000
You think? You think more

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
people will choose ninja? Do you get free t-shirts or anything

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
for these things?

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:16.000
In-game. Yeah, but I

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
never received anything for planes.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
I didn't get a t-shirt that had planes on it.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
You don't get the t-shirt.

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
Okay, when you do the Splatfest,

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
you have a Splatfest shirt

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
that has the team logo on it

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
or whatever it is. But you have to turn that in

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
when Splatfest is done. And as a reward,

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
depending on how well you did, you get snails

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
which will modify your existing gear to

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
give it more slots and stuff.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
That's what the Splatfest is for.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
That's why they do them every other week.

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Okie doke. Alright.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
There it is.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
Alright, and now everybody in chat

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
is telling me which team to pick. You don't own

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
me. You don't run my life.

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Alright, I'll consider it.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Alright, moving on. Dark Saga.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Well, we have

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
a thing that

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
I would like to try except it's only in the UK.

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
And that's Fallout Beer.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
It's going to be available on Amazon

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
UK and

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
the case will go

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
for roughly £30.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
£29.99.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
It will be shipping

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
on November 9th.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
Somebody in the UK better send me some.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
Even though it is

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
a Pilsner.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
I will forgive it because I need to try Fallout Beer.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
And there's a new

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
Bomberman game. And everyone's super excited

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
except it's

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
for cell phone.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
So, yeah.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
That's not as exciting but at least

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
it's not another Pachinko machine.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
Thank you, Konami.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
I wish Hudson would come back to life.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
And last but not least, there's a

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
fan mod out there for

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
the new Resident Evil HD.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
And it brings back the old voice

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
acting. Apparently they had

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
to go through something like

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
over 500 different audio files

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
to find and replace them with the originals.

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
Where's

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Barry?

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
That's awesome.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
You were almost a Jill sandwich.

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
That's my favorite.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
Yeah. I should have brought

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
back that old thing for fortune cookie.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
You should have but

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
it's alright. You have something Halloween appropriate.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
It's somewhere. Yeah.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
Alright. If that is it

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
for rapid fire news, which I believe it is,

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
we are going to get into the

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
Google question of the week.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
Every week

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
we go to Facebook and we go to

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
Google Plus.

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
And you combine those together, you get

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
FOOGLE.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
And yes, believe it or not, people are still

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
on Google Plus.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
Because we do get answers over on Google Plus

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
to our question of the week. And I'm going to start there

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
tonight. Which the question of the week we

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
asked about, you know, it has to do with that whole

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
issue that Dark

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
Soccer brought up earlier where we had some of the

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
nice employees that were leaving reviews

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
on Amazon. But you know,

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
they weren't the first. They're not going to be the last.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
So we wanted to ask, knowing

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
that the above happens,

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
do you let user reviews sway you

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
one way or another when buying a

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
video game product? What about

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
when compared to critic reviews? Is one or

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
the other both likely to

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
sway you or neither?

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
ActDeft replied and said,

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
wait, people read Amazon

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
product reviews in a serious manner?

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
That's what I said.

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
You know, I do quite often.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Especially if I'm buying something or trying to

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
decide between... But when you know this happens,

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
that people are sandbagging the reviews one way or another?

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Well yes, not if they're sandbagging the reviews.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
I mean, you can tell.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Well, ActDeft continues, for real though, it's all

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
sorts of shady considering that you may not read

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
the reviews, but you'll look at the rating and hit

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
hits and think, this is a good product based

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
on that one. It may be not.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
Granted, most people that want Rock Band will

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
probably just buy it and ignore the reviews

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
like most people do with any big triple A game.

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
Retertainment says, between

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
fake Amazon reviews, Twitch streamers

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
getting paid off, and newspaper reviewers not

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
playing the game in full before writing a review.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Who can you trust? Answer.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
The fine people at ORL.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:10.000
That's not...

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
That is actually what he typed. ORL.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
Who's ORL?

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Or really? Or really?

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
I know that

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
was a typo, but it was an extremely funny one.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
I'm sorry. When Loki rants about

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
something, you know it's legit.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
Now when do I get paid? Come on, positive statements

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
of the internet's gotta be worth some internet dollars, right?

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
I'm sorry, but you forfeit

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
the dollars by misspelling the name of the

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
show. I guess this

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
pumpkin cinnamon roll I was gonna pay you with

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
will have to go to somebody else.

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
Sorry. Alright.

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
And lastly, Martin

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
replied over on Google Plus and said,

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
I trust Amazon reviews for physical

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
products, but do not for games.

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
I do trust certain video game reviewers

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
and you get a sense of whether a game is

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
for you from Twitch streamers and

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
quick looks. Alright, let's

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
go over to Facebook where we had quite a few answers.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
I'm gonna read some here. Alan Alchemy said,

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
I tend to trust aggregates more

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
simply because even if all critics are

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
awful, when 200 of them all lean

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:08.000
in the same direction, it's not really a coincidence.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
When a movie is 8% on

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Rotten Tomatoes, even if it's a trash genre

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
to begin with, like a teen slasher,

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
I'm not gonna act like it's secretly good and they're

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
all being haters. Then I'll look at the reader

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
review aggregate score and see if they're widely

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
different, or if it's for a niche game I'd probably

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
buy anyway. TigerClaw

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
says, I don't really let critic or user reviews

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
dictate to me whether a product is good or bad.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
We've all been in situations where a

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
product had great reviews. We had a bad

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
experience with it. Or a product you had a

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
great experience with, but everyone else gave it bad reviews.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
So it's really up to your decision

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
if you want it that bad. You believe

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
in it, you buy it.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000
Bryce H. says, I don't let user

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
reviews sway me one way or the other. I'd rather

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
try it first hand or watch somebody else.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
What's bad for one person may be good for

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
another. CriticalMyth

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
says, positive user reviews

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
rarely sway me. Negative

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
user reviews can if they make specific

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
points that touch on items that

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
would affect my enjoyment of the game.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Same thing with pro reviews though.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Fabrice A. said, I

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
read several reviews from several sources,

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
both user reviews and professional reviews,

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
and then I compare all the pros and cons

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
from every review. That gives me a

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
solid impression of a game.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
Andy R. says, I tend to trust critic reviews

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
a slight bit above user reviews, but

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
at this point I've been around the block enough that I rarely

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
use the user or critic reviews to

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
sway my purchases. I feel like

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
I can usually get a grasp on whether I'll enjoy a game

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
based on factors like who is making

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
it or preview materials. Plus

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
I tend to stick to franchises I've enjoyed

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
in the past. Dark Charger

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
says, neither. I usually know prior

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
to any review whether I'm going to buy it or not.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
I know what I like. Occasionally there will be

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
great reviews for a game that I was not originally

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000
considering. I may give that game a second

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
look and have discovered some great games this way.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Jordan T. says,

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
I usually try to get a feel for an average

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
of what a game is scoring in reviews.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
With a secondary interest in the extreme positive

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
and especially negative comments,

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
just see what people zero in on.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
After that, assuming I don't have previous experience

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
with the game or IP, I'll check out gameplay

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
footage to see if it's something I think I would like.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
Justin H. says,

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
I admit somewhat shamefully that I love

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
both user and critic reviews.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
I use Metacritic to discover games I wouldn't play

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
otherwise, specifically for older games

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
and indie games. Reviews have also

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
helped me avoid buying games that turn out to be not

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
as good as perceived, like the first person

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
shooter Brink or Reboot of Thief.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Reviews are just a tool,

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
however, and I will buy games with bad reviews

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
if I have a genuine interest in playing them regardless.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
And lastly, Master Claw

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
says, I find most user reviews completely

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
worthless. They're usually poorly written

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
to a point of being unintelligible and they're

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
never moderate. They're always like, OMG

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
this game's awesome. Best game ever.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
Five stars. Or,

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
this game sucks balls. I'd give it zero

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
stars if I could. I never played it, but I know

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
it sucks. I wish sites like Amazon

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
would allow filtering out

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
of unverified user reviews.

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
There it is. Comments

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
from our Facebook and Google Plus pages.

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
Thank you guys. A very big

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
variety. I was not expecting

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
such a huge variety, but

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
it's really all over the map. Some people saying

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
nah. Some people saying yeah, I kind of do.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
Especially a lot of people

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
saying reviews

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
can kind of give that

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
second chance. I guess

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
now in this day and age, I'm kind of

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
on that team where I am looking at the

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
streaming of the game to see if it's something I would like.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
That's what I did with Dragon Quest Heroes.

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
I originally was like, eh, it's

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
a side game. I don't think it's something I'm going to like.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
But then I watched some of the streams and I was like,

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000
well okay, I'll try it.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
So I got it.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
Anyway, there you go.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
Some of the answers

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
from our Facebook and Google Plus communities.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Alan Alchemy saying

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
Amazon does have verified purchase

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
on the top reviews. That's true,

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
but I don't think they filter the star score

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
by only the verified reviews.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
I don't think there's a way

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
to do that. At least not that I know of.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
I think that might be what the listener was complaining about there.

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Tigerclaw

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
saying yeah, watching a Twitch stream

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
of a game is a good way to see how the game is like

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
and that will help you on your purchasing decision.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
I kind of agree. You have those resources

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
out there. Whether it be Twitch, YouTube,

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
whatever it is you use to look at the

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
actual video from a game, I think

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
is a great way to kind of know what you're getting into.

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
Alright, let's move on.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
Back into some other news. Loki.

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
So we kind of touched on this last week with

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
Overkill

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
adding some microtransactions

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
to Payday 2. Basically

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
what they were doing originally is that

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
they were starting to get the

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
safe drops at the end of matches

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
and so when you would get

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
the safe, in order to

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
get what was inside of it, which contained

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
cosmetic items, many of which

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
would actually add stat bonuses,

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
you would actually have to pay real money

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
for the drills. So you had to pay

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
$2.50 to purchase a

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
drill to open the safe.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
Well now, they're kind of

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
stepping back a little bit

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
instead of just having that be

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
the only way you get drills.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
They're not really getting rid of the microtransactions

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
but they're also going to start having

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
drills drop as part of post

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
match rewards as well.

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
Because before

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
it used to be the only way to get those would be

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
to buy them.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
So now they're just going to drop as well.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
So you may not have to buy them, but it's still

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
shit.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
Yeah, not

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
a lot of happy people out there with

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
this whole thing, how this is

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
panned out there with Payday.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Yeah, and the community doesn't seem to enjoy it too much

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
based on what I've seen.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Well, if you don't like it, don't buy the

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
game, that'll send a message. Do you think that'll

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
actually happen or people just won't be able to resist?

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
I think

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
people can probably resist opening

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
those.

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
For $2.50 for just a random

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
cosmetic item, I think that

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
would be, that's not kind of worth it.

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
Yeah, but if the game doesn't sell well, that'll really tell

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
them. I mean, 8,000 copies of your game

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
sold is going to send a message. But I think that Payday

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
sold more than 8,000 copies.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
I'm just saying. They re-released it so many times

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
I think it's doing just fine.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
Alright.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
Well, we've

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
been talking a lot about remakes tonight,

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
reimaginings, and this is interesting.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
This is a

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
story that's been floating around where

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
Mega Man 3 is being

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
remade by a fan in the Unreal

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
Engine 4. And I'm totally

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
going to mispronounce this name, so I apologize.

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
But, André

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
de Jaeger, I hope I said that right.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
But he's been working on this, just

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
toying around in Unreal

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
excuse me,

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
remaking Mega Man 3.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
And I gotta say, it looks great

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
when you look. He's just got a little

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
clip of the Gemini Man stage in

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
this. I don't know where the music comes

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
from. I don't know if he remade the music or if he's like

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
using an overclocked mix or something. There's

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
so many Mega Man fan mixes

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
out there you can only imagine.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
But let me show, just to the folks in

02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000
studio here, if I can

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
if I can

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
if it'll work.

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
You can

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
kind of see what that looks like there.

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
Looks great, huh?

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
The background leaves

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
a little bit to be desired, but yeah, the rest

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
of it looks great. Yeah, and then you get into the segments

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
like where it's all the colored blocks, like that looks really

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
good, huh? Yeah, it is.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
So,

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
I just, you know, again, I think there's a lot of

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
people that would really like something like that.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
So,

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
alright.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
I played it again.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
Anyway, I don't know.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000
Here's the thing when it comes to remakes, especially like this.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
A lot of people that do like

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
speed runs and things that perfect

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
the game, kind of expect

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
the game to run in certain

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
ways. And when you remake a game like this,

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
I'm not sure everything's gonna be down to the

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
nanosecond, if that makes sense.

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
And that can really bother some people, but I think

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
if you're okay with that, I think this looks

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
great. Like, you know,

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
this is, this looks even

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
better than Mighty No. 9, to be honest.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
And it's just one guy!

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
Just blows my mind how Capcom doesn't want

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
to do anything like that.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
So.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
bonds006 in chat says, Jamie does not

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
sound impressed.

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
That's alright. Well, they did that sort of

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
with Mega Man powered up

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
M, I think that's what it was called,

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
or Mega Man powered up, that was on PSP.

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
Oh yeah, that looked really good, yeah.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
I mean, they did it in a weird art style

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
where it's like giant head Mega Man, you know,

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
but it was kind of

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
like that. And how level editor was

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
kind of cool. No love for that

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
though, I mean, I don't understand why they'll do that

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
for console. You know, somebody

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
posted in my Facebook, I don't remember if it was

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
Rama or Joe or somebody, but somebody posted

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
my Facebook that somebody remade

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
like Mega Man 1

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
within Mario Maker.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000
And they, now obviously it

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
doesn't look exactly

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
like Mega Man, but it's like a lot of the same

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
elements they kind of put

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
in Mario Maker, and I was really impressed, I

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
gotta say. They did this whole YouTube where

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
they used some remixed Mega

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
Man themes kind of in the background to give it a little

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
flair, and obviously they used the Mega Man

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
amiibo as well. What? They didn't even make like

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
the music, you know, with, you know, the

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
the note blocks. That would have been

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
a little complicated to do all of that.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
Nah, just kidding. I just thought that was really

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
cool as well. There's so much

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
fan love for Mega Man out there.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
It's just like, Capcom, make a new one.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
You never will, but alright.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Anyhow, Dark Saga.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Well,

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
you know, we've

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
talked about many different

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
studios in the past and about them going to

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
certain locations. This one

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
is actually pretty cool because

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
it kind of affects my old stomping grounds.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
And Exile is opening

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
a new studio in

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
New Orleans. They're the

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
group that gave us

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
Bard's Tale 4, for example.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
But they are going to be

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
opening up

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
the studio. They're supposed to

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
create about 50 new jobs over

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
the next five years.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
So,

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
they're basically going to be

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
setting up there, trying to also

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
have a long-term goal of creating

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
110 new jobs

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
in Louisiana itself.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
And,

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
I just think it's

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
good that they're looking to invest in the area,

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
especially given that parts

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
of the state are still recovering. I mean,

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
Katrina was a while back. Sure.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
But not everything is recovered. That's going to take

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
a generation to recover from. Yeah.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
So, I think this is great.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
I think this is really good, and that means

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
that, you know, folks that I know

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
in the area, that's

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
less distance

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
that have to move to find work in the industry.

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
Yeah. Good deal.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
It's always nice to hear about jobs being made

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
as opposed to layoffs.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
So, Loki, what do you have for us?

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
Well, I have layoffs for you.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
God damn it, Loki.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
No, but anyways,

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
Rovio, they've laid off

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
213 people. God damn it, Loki.

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000
Sorry.

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
But it's fewer than

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
what was originally announced, because they announced

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
260, and that was back in August.

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:02.000
But they're restructuring

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.000
the company to focus on

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
key areas like games media

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
and consumer products.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:10.000
And of course, you know, they have the

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Angry Birds movie coming out in

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:14.000
May. So,

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
yeah. The first round, I guess,

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
you know, they

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:20.000
laid off 110 employees back in

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.000
December, and now this

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:24.000
213 is going to be

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:26.000
I think a reduction of about

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
36% originally from their

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
numbers that they were working with.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
That

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:34.000
sucks, but, you know. It does, but how

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
often have we seen this in the smartphone day

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:38.000
and age where, you know, this company has their

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:40.000
one breakthrough game, and then all of a

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
sudden it's like they're bloated beyond control

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:44.000
and then, oh, surprise,

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.000
the future releases didn't

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
catch on in the same way, so we have to

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
lay everybody off. I mean, this has happened like time and time

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:52.000
again, right? Yeah.

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
Is Zynga even still around at this point?

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:56.000
Yeah, they are. Are they?

02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:58.000
What are they making these days? Is there

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:00.000
Farmville 3?

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
I don't know. I don't know.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
But then, you know, Rovio has Angry Birds

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:06.000
and I don't know. What else did they do?

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:08.000
Yep.

02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:10.000
And then there was

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
the OMG Pop or whatever,

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
the drawing game

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:16.000
on the phone that was huge, and then Zynga

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.000
bottom, and then nobody wanted to play it anymore.

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
It's Candy Crush.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
And all the others. What else have they done?

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
Soda Crush. Oh,

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:26.000
Candy Crush 2, Electric Boogaloo.

02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:28.000
What else? Yeah, and like other Crush

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:30.000
games. Like, I have a coworker that plays

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
that kind of stuff, and I'm like,

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
what are you playing? And she's,

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:36.000
I don't even know, it's like some

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.000
game. And it's

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
basically Candy Crush, but

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
it just kind of proves, like, it's not Candy

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Crush, it was just one of the other

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.000
millions of those games out there.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Like, the market's so saturated with like, oh,

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:50.000
hey, Candy Crush worked out

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:52.000
really well, let's make a bunch of those.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
I start playing Brandy Lush.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:56.000
I just drink a lot.

02:09:56.000 --> 02:09:58.000
I'm playing like, you know, it's like Jewel Crush

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.000
2, or, I don't know.

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000
It's...

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:04.000
ActDeft in chat says

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.000
crush all the things. Oh, be careful,

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
I believe that word is trademarked.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
Patent pending. Copyright.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:14.000
Anyhow.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
Hey, some fun news

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
out of the indie scene. Apparently,

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Goat Simulator and

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:22.000
I Am Bread are

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:24.000
combining forces for some

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
crossover DLC. And there's

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:28.000
actually a trailer that

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
shows, through the power of love,

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
a goat and bread

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
going on a date together

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:36.000
to...

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:38.000
Goat Simulator will be

02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:40.000
getting a playable piece of bread,

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:42.000
and I Am Bread is gonna get a mode called

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.000
Rampage. So these

02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:46.000
two games have literally gotten in bed

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:48.000
together for DLC, but this is great.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:50.000
I don't like I Am Bread, but I Am Bread is so frustrating

02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000
and hard that I don't like

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:54.000
that game anymore. I am frustrated.

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
I kinda wish...

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:58.000
I'm glad Goat Simulator is getting more

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:00.000
DLC. Please bring it to the console, because

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
I can't purchase it on console.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
It doesn't run well on my PC, and that's

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.000
my big problem. I would love to purchase

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:08.000
your game. I like all the DLC and stuff.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.000
I can't, though, because you don't

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.000
offer it. I have money

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:14.000
in my hand. Gonna give it to you,

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:16.000
but you're not letting me. And some bread. I have more bread,

02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:18.000
if that's what you want. You're not letting me.

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:20.000
So, yeah.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
There you go.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
So, uh, congrats to those guys.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
That looks like it'll be fun.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
Alright, let's go to our

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:30.000
mailbag!

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Every week, Dark Soccer dives into our

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:40.000
mailbag, and if you want to email us,

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
participate at Orangelauntrader.com

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:44.000
is how you can participate with the show.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.000
We had some good emails last week, um, so

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
hopefully, this week can live up to it.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000
We have two emails tonight, right, Dark Soccer?

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:52.000
Alright, let's get to it!

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
Hello, LR. Please forgive me if I'm about to sound like

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:56.000
a high and mighty bragging douche butt.

02:11:56.000 --> 02:11:58.000
But you are!

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:00.000
I mean, let's, let's be, sorry, I don't even

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:02.000
know who this is yet, or what it is, but

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:04.000
anytime you're gonna say, sorry if I'm gonna do this butt,

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
you're, I'm gonna do it. You are gonna be that.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:08.000
You are gonna do it. But it's okay! I like how this

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000
field says, I don't mean to sound racist, but

02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:12.000
yeah, you're racist.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:14.000
And, I, you know what, I'll,

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:16.000
I have definitely been a whiny douche on this

02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:18.000
show, have we all, so, have your moment,

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:20.000
emailer, have your moment. You know what,

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
though, I think that the word douche is the best

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
insult ever. Yeah? You know why?

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.000
Why? Because, first of all, if you look at an

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:28.000
actual douche...

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
I'd rather not. Number one...

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
Especially as a gay man, it's really not something

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
I just, I have zero interest in it whatsoever.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
Number one... What?

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
It's unnecessary. And number two,

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000
it actually can cause harm.

02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.000
That's the best insult ever.

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Now I'll continue.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:46.000
I think

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
I heard, I actually think I owe Becky

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
rent on that one, because she

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:52.000
mentioned that to me once. I see.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:54.000
Pretty good. I don't,

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
okay, I just don't understand why people make such a

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
big deal about beating Contra on the

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
default three lives.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
It's really, really not that difficult.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Compared to those NES games that are

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
actually hard, like Ninja Gaiden

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
or Battletoads or many others,

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
I would say that anyone with at least some

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
gaming skill could do it if they actually

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
try. Personally, I can do it

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
every time without continues.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
Why aren't you special?

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Hearts, YYR,

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
hearts. Oh, it's YYR?

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
Yes. Sound the hipster alarm.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
Better grow that beard and put on some lumberjack

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
clothes. That's right. I got some

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
flannel for you. I've got some horn-rimmed glasses

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
somewhere. Let's watch some Portlandia

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
and listen to some indie bands. Listen to some vinyl.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
All you need are decent

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
timing and reflexes, a bit of

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
memorization, some knowledge

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
of how the game works, for example, keeping

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
in mind that random enemies can pop out

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
along the ground at any time, and

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
to get comfortable. People, stop

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
messaging me while I'm reading the email.

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
Seriously. Shut it off.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
No, it's the chat.

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
The thing pops every time I get a message

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
and it's freaking distracting.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
You need to turn that off.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
I can't, not with what I have.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Where was I? Okay.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
A hipster douche vinyl.

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
And to get comfortable with the game's weapons.

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Knowing where the best weapons are

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
helps with quite a bit,

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
but if you're decent at mashing the B button,

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
you can get comfortable with the default weapon as well.

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
And that can help even more.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
The game gives you a generous number of extra

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
lives, and if you count those, you actually

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
have closer to 10 by the end.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
And most of all, playing by yourself

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
helps a lot too. You play with yourself

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
and that helps. Do you play with

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
yourself a lot, YPR?

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
You might have thought otherwise, but not having

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
to worry about keeping the same pace as

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
your partner is a huge load off your shoulders.

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
Imagine playing with yourself as a huge load.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
Jamie!

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:54.000
I can't help it.

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
I'm in that mood tonight.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
It's not as much as you would think.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
With at least another partner, you normally get a

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
huge load button.

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
A little extra advice

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
will... the whole point is to take off

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
a huge load. He needs to get the huge load off.

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
Please finish

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
this damn email.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
That's kind of not really how it works, but okay.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
A little extra advice to...

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Am I in the Horde house? What happened?

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Josh! A little extra advice

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
to anyone who wants to try.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
The R powerup is not a weapon.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
It makes the shots fired by your current weapon

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
move faster. Every weapon has a maximum

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
number of shots allowed on the screen at a time

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
so the faster they're gone, the sooner you can

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
fire more. The S plus R

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
combination is in almost every way

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
the best weapon in the game. In Stages 2

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
and 4, don't forget that ducking makes you

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
invincible against bullets

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
and jumping is almost

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
always a bad idea.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
Also in those levels, the round

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
targets are mandatory, but all others are

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
optional. Against the Stage 4 boss,

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
any homing bubbles that appear

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
would be your first priority, and the snowfield

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
will move forward slowly and be ready

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
to jump over the sudden turrets.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
And I think if you're playing single player

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
if you push up on Player 2

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
controller, you can hit

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
the targets in the middle even if you're ducking

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
if I remember correctly.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
When moving through Stage 8,

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
stop moving forward as

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
soon as you encounter the next mouth

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
unless doing so is impossible.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
Destroying them when at a time will prevent

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
you from being overwhelmed.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
When fighting the head or the

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
heart, the distance between you and the target

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
is so short that your shots

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
disappear almost instantly, so the

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
faster you can mash the buttons, the faster you can

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
consider yourself a hero. Against

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
the heart, make sure to take out the two

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
pods on the floor first. Makes

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
things much easier. I would encourage anyone

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
to try Contra on 3 lives even if

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
you never played it back then. Try it with

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
30 lives first just to get the hang of it, then

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
give it a shot. You're capable of more than you

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
think. Then

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
try the even more challenging

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
sequel, Keep the Trigger Pulled

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
Aaron YYR.

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
That Battle Toads is way harder

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
than even

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
you know, that Battle Toads was definitely

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
controller breaking rage

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
fury type of stuff and there

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
was no 30 lives code in that game so

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
you were just fucked if you

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
couldn't get the pattern down.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Ninja Gaiden was really, I own Ninja

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Gaiden and I don't think I ever beat it.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
I could only get like to like the next

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
to last stage I think was as far as I could get.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
It was, it was

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
brutal. Yes.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
So last email? Yep.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
This comes from Rissimo.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
Hi there. I just wanted to say

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
thanks to all three of you for giving me such

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
great ear candy over the years.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
I found OLR by reading Joystick

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
Mini Moons ago. It was the

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
infamous Katamari tobacco.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
Oh, I don't know what

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
you're talking about. What Katamari

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
tobacco?

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
I have heard every single episode

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
since then. I never get to listen

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
live so I

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
used to download the episodes from Loki's PSP

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
portal and followed you to Justin TV

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
and now I stream Epps from Stitcher.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
I've gotten many friends to listen

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
since then and they love you just as

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
well. Thanks again for your dedication and

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
I hope you continue to bless us with your banter

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
for many more years.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
Aww, thank you. That's, no question

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
or anything. That's it? Just a

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
I just called to say I love you?

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
I just called to say

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
I love

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
OLR.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
Aww, I'm feeling warm and fuzzy now.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
That's great. Thank you. It was like a little

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
e-hug. I appreciate that. You feel all squishy.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
And then I'm thinking in my mind

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
how long ago was that Katamari thing?

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
Wasn't that like 2007 when that happened?

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
Or 2008? I don't even remember. It was a long time ago.

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
It was ages ago.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
Joystick's been closed for a while now

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
so not that long I guess in retrospect.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
Let's take a look, shall we?

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
So

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
I think, I want to say it was like 2008?

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
I could be

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
wrong. It was sometime

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
long ago

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
in a galaxy far, far away.

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Still, that would have been just like

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
that's still like

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
seven years ago. That person's been listening for seven years.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
Supposedly every week. I'm sorry.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
Wow, I know that. I feel like there's

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
a long list of things I should apologize for you. March 16, 2007.

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
2007!

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Thank you, Wikipedia.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
We're actually a part of a beautiful Katamari Wikipedia page.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
Are we really?

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
We are. Oh my god.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Why?

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
We don't even have our own Wikipedia

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
article anymore. Yep, we're under

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
PlayStation 3 and Wii development.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
A March 16, 2007 post at

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Orange Launch Radio reported that Namco Bandai

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
announced beautiful Katamari to retailers.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
Well, I was like,

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Namco Bandai didn't announce it.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
That was, but okay.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
But they did,

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
that's how we had discovered it was through the retail channels.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Yes, that is correct.

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
So

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
there was a PlayStation 3 version, okay.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
But we don't, for some reason, we don't have

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
our own Wikipedia article anymore.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
Because some douche figured

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
that we didn't need one. Even though

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
we won, and you know, whatever, I'm just

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
saying, I'm just saying, we won

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
the very first podcast award.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
We are the longest running video

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
game podcast that exists, period.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
If there was another

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
one, we would know of it by now. There's others

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
that have been running a very long time, ten plus

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
years, and many kudos to them, but

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
we are the longest, for what it's worth.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Let's see, what else? What else

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
makes this notable? I guess that's it.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
Me. You.

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
Me.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
We're also part of the

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
guitar hero encore rock the 80s.

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
What?

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
Wikipedia page.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
How? Did we break the news on that or something?

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
I don't even remember.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
That was a long time ago.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
We do have a link as well

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
on Takeo

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
Mitsumiro,

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Muratsu.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
Is that the dude who

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
is OrangeLounge?

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
Under his, like, name, maybe?

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
I don't know. I'm just

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
going in, something about Jumping

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
Flash 2.

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
Let's take a look here.

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
That's cool

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
if we're cited in Jumping Flash 2, I

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
guess. How does that work?

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Jumping Flash 2 is a great game.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
They linked to

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
Tetsuya, posted something, I guess.

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
Huh.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
It's an article

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
on our, or it was an

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
article. It's not linked there anymore

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
for some reason. Wow.

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
Oh, yeah. As 200 Matt says, the VOG Network

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
was also mentioned in the Disney Infinity Wiki

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
at one point. That's right, because the

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
E3 thing got the price point for those figures.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
There's a post of us on Dailymotion

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
doing what?

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
It was actually going back to when we were

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
on the news about podcasting.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
Oh, God.

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Was that the one where, was that the clip with Loki?

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
Oh, it's so much fun.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
KCRA, yeah. Oh, yeah.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
With an old-ass iPod.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
Yes.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
That was before iPhones, wasn't it?

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
That clip was before the iPhone,

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
if I'm not mistaken.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Yup.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
I think you guys,

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
I think we should

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
do that clip.

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
How long has it been since we

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
played this clip? No.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
Yes, I think the whole conversation

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
with them, that's what they picked.

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
No, we're right after a shooting.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
It's

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
9 years old. This story is 9 years

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
old from July of 2005.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
No, this is,

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
oh my God, it's over 10 years old at this point.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
The governor

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
is one of the many people joining the

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
podcasting craze.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
It's becoming a web craze.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
Brian Hickey tonight shows us how

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
people are using podcasting to

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
inform, entertain, and share their thoughts

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
with the world.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
Apparently your thought is only 10 seconds

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
known.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
It's called Dance Dance Revolution, or DDR, a popular

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
game that has a fanatic following.

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
It started off tiny and it's

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
grown. Oh my gosh.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
I hate hearing

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
myself. That's phrasing.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
That's you talking about the prior email.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
Phrasing.

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
Check out also

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
the gigantic HDTV I used

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
to have. This is the place I lived

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
with the extra for a moment.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
Hello everybody

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
once again.

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
Welcome to another episode

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
of our podcast.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
From their apartment in Rancho Cordova using

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
Revolution... We didn't all live together.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
Just from their apartment.

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
We didn't all live together. Can you imagine

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
if all three of us, I mean I guess Loki and I

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
lived together for a while. We made it work.

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
Where would I put Dan?

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
And look how young we all are. I'm like

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
oh my god I had so much hair.

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
Girl.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
Oh my god that was

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
the old

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
We basically give the news for video games

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
popular culture.

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
Basically what gamers really want to know.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
Oh my god.

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
The developers record their programs

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
then send them to a number of websites

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
now hosting the shows.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
Now anyone can create, edit and

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
air their ideas, concerns, music

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
and all things audio to anyone

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
else willing to download it.

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
It's a much

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
more flexible way of

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
spreading the information. With nothing

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
more than an MP3 player and a set of headphones

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
you can listen to it anywhere.

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
Now people can talk about

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
things they like to talk about

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
other people can join in

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
and listen to and it's really open

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
and lots of people can get into it.

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
I love how they just interviewed

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
some dude with an iPod and it was

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
like iPod owner. That was actually

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
the little thing that said it was an iPod

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
owner. A number of websites are now

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
hosting the podcast for free.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
The newest and biggest database to adopt

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
the technology is Apple's iTunes.

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
You just click on the podcast

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
tab, type a topic in the search

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
feature and a list of available

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
podcasts are at your fingertips.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
Free for you, free for the producers,

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
free speech for everyone.

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
It's so much fun.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
It's great that you know just anybody out there

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
who really has a desire to want to be heard

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
you have an outlet for your voice to get out there

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
so podcasting is just wonderful.

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
Ian Rancho Cordova, Brian Hickey

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
KCRA 3 reports.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
Yeah fuck that.

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
Recently Governor Schwarzenegger began providing

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
his weekly radio. Yes everybody

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
reminder, he really was the governor.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
That actually happened.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
He really was the governor of California.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
The goobernator.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:54.000
As a podcast it can be

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000
downloaded so you can listen to it

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
in your car as you walk or even as you're

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
pumping iron in the gym.

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
Oh news.

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
Oops I almost started it over again. Sorry about that.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
There we go. That's a clip from my KCRA

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
bootleg there

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
from our YouTube channel.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
By the way I also want to point out

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
in that story did you notice

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
even though they had all of us

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
sort of in that interview

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
they never said the name of the show.

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
They never said it was called

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
Orange Lawns Radio ever in that entire clip.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
They show a picture of it

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
when he's talking about oh iTunes has it

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
they show a picture of him subscribing to it

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
in iTunes with the really old

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
art like

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
even the one before the one

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
you did I mean it was really old.

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
We were in the four corners

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
I was in one corner

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
the chakra was in one corner Loki was in one corner

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
and then the fourth corner was the ferret.

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
And SSA 100 Matt says Loki's field

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
gypped from his five minutes of fame. No that's not the only time

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
I've been on the news. We also did a guitar

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
hero thing. I wasn't on that.

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
I gave an honest opinion about

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
like on a scale of 1 to 10

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
how do you rate them. It's about like an 8 or 9

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
and then Miss

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
Miss One Up here has to go it's an

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
11.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Fuck that shit.

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
Say thanks.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
I was looking.

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
It's a million.

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
It's a million.

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
I was looking

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
just looking for

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
orange on radio and wiki and found

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
my page on the Wikipedia

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
and I don't ever remember saying this

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
but it does sound like something I'd say.

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
I'm controlling the apocalypse.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
You're all fucked.

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
Wait but that wasn't on Wikipedia

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
that's the orange on radio. On our wiki.

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
Yeah so I haven't read my page.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
That's a separate thing that the which

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
honestly I don't even know how to edit it.

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
I think maybe I changed one thing on there

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
one time but that's been like a group

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
of like three or four people that still

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
still keep that like classic game

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
list up to date and I think the list list gets

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
updated every time we do that game. Oh my god it's my

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
old MySpace page.

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
I didn't even think this existed anymore.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
Wait you still have a MySpace page? Apparently I do.

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
There is a link to your MySpace

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
on the Wikipedia. Oh my god.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
What song

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
is auto playing in the background?

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
Oh my god.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
Dark Saga is horrified.

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
I would like to read my quotes from the page.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
Oh yes what's that?

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
It says um

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
I can't for the life of me

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
get the hooker to have sex with me.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
I remember that. That was you talking

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
about like Grand Theft Auto or something.

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
Of course it's so much fun.

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
Ow my foot why'd I shoot myself

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
in the foot oh my god it hurt so bad.

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
Yes that was you

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
being you were a game company

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
talking about something.

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
I don't remember what I was talking about.

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
Bomb Burger.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Wait hold on

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
because I actually I actually

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
have this

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
clip.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
God damn.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
Ow my foot.

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
Why did I shoot myself in my foot?

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
Oh my god it hurt so bad.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
Oh my god my

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
No I need

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
that for walking.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
Wait and I have this other one it says Loki on

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
babies. I'm a little worried.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
What this

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
could be. Somebody once told me

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
what having a baby felt like.

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
Giving birth sucks and I'm never going to do it.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
It's why they cut open your stomach and

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
pull the damn kid out. It's just like what the hell

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
is the point? It's like trying to shove a piano

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000
through a door when there's a perfectly good

02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000
window right there.

02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:32.000
I mean

02:29:32.000 --> 02:29:34.000
I don't see the point.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
And that's why

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
men will never have babies.

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
The genius of Loki on Orange Lums

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Radio. I don't even remember what the hell

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
that was in regards to.

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
And then we were talking about

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
the Mega Man 2 jingle thing that they

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
had like an app where you can

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
whenever you click an icon

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
do the Mega Man 2 jingle and it's like

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
hamburger and then

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
mailman.

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
In the early days of apps or anything

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
gaming related.

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
That's kind of a

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
lame list. I've said more interesting things

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
since then.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
For the record I would like to point out

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
that I have birthed no children.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
Just saying.

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
Alright.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
I don't even know

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
how we got on that tangent. Oh it was the

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
love letter. Just sent us down memory lane

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
so thank you for that. You even get

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
to hear clips from before you were even listening

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
probably recently so there you go.

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
Alright. Thank you for your emails.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Participate at OrangeLumsRadio.com

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
is the place where you can send us

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
emails as well. Let's

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
now take this opportunity to get into

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
the FUs of the week.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
FU to

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
medical issues.

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
That's it. I'll leave it there.

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
There's so many things I don't even

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
remember on this thing like bucket rolled.

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
Anyways.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
I guess FU to just being really

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
tired and not having a chance to work on

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
my costume because I'm worried that I'm gonna run out of time

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
very fast. So

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
I need to start tonight.

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
I gotta cut something tonight.

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
For the costume.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
My FU of the week goes

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
to those delicious

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
pumpkin cinnamon rolls that

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
Jamie brought to the show tonight because they were so

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
Trader Joe's. They were so freaking

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
good but now I just feel so fat

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
after having eaten two of them.

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
I'm having eater's remorse.

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
Oh well.

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
There it is.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
The FUs of the week.

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
Yep. In fact they already have episode six

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000
nineteen classic game of the week already

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
in there so. They're

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
good. What can I say? They're fast. They are

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
fast. Alright.

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
Let's get to it. Don't you have to put

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
a spoiler alert on it though because the podcast doesn't

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
no I'm just kidding. Oh I didn't say what it was.

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
I just said it was there. I'm just. No I'm

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
on the wiki. It's fine. Alright.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
Just a couple more stories for you guys then the

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
phone calls one eight seven seven

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
game OLR or username on Skype

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
All one word. Let's do these last

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
couple stories. Loki. So someone decided

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
to make a Zelda maker on

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
PC. Of course this is not officially

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
endorsed by Nintendo.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
It is kind of cool to check out. They do

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
have an alpha release you can

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
download and make some levels

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
for. I

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
I don't know. It looked interesting

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
and I kind of watched the video of it.

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
I think this is going to get

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
taken down before you know it. Yeah now that

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
it's on all these new sites Nintendo's

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
lawyers will be at work Monday morning

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
which I hate to say but it's true. You guys all

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
know it's true. Yeah so

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
if you check it out

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
looking to see where the download is for that

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
basically

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
if you look for user dream mix

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
on YouTube there's a link of

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
one of the videos they have legends all that maker

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
Alpha zero point zero

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
one release and you can go download it

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
so it looks interesting.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
Yeah it looks it's again

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
it's very interesting what a small little independent

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
group can accomplish.

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
So strange to me how

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
they can do that. But anyway

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
I mean sorry it's

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
it's not strange to me they can do it but

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
it's strange how it's

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
this small little team can do it yet you

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
know when it comes to a big company they're

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
they're pressed for resources and so forth

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
it's just I don't know it just

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
blows my mind sometimes.

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
Anyhow

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
lastly before we get to the Skype

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
line this is the story

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
I'm sure you've all been waiting for

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
in fact actually

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
is more when I heard it was one of those things where

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
gosh this didn't already happen

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
Hideo Kojima

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
has officially parted ways with

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
Konami in fact it happened

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
on October 9th and due to a

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
clause apparently in the

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
parting arrangement there he's

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
not allowed to work again until December

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
there was allegedly

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
some type of cheerful but emotional

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
goodbye departure ceremony that about

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
100 people went to and

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
Hideo Kojima did not comment on

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
this because of a legally binding agreement

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
with the former employer

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
but this is where things got really fucking weird

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
because Kojima can't

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
comment but Konami did

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
after the New Yorker ran that piece about

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
Hideo Kojima and

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
Konami decided to reply on

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
Tokyo Sports which got translated

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
saying that Kojima

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
is still an employee of Konami he's

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:36.000
just on vacation

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
currently Kojima is listed as a

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
company employee at Konami

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
currently Kojima and the development team are finished

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
developing Metal Gear Solid 5 and taking

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
a long time off from work because the

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
development time for console games is so long and fatigue

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
builds up it's common for employees to

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
take extended periods of time off when

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
development is finished

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
so would that vacation

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
be up in say I don't know December?

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:02.000
We'll see

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
Tigerclaw in chat says maybe

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
something got lost in the translation

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
you know here's the thing

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
Konami's PR stuff

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
is in the goddamn toilet right now

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
and if

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
this hadn't happened after what

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
has been an actual comedy

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
of errors one after another

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
coming out of Konami then

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
I would probably go okay there is

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
probably some type of miscommunication going on

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
and you know something weird is going on

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
but after everything

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
that's come out of Konami over the past

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
year between the PT debacle

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
and the removal

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
and the fact that nothing's coming out except

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
for mobile and pachinko

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
and all this stuff it's like okay

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
Konami needs

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
like

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
they need more than PR they need

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
CPR at this point they need a

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
lot of help getting their image

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
back up and I don't even know if it's recoverable

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
at this point and so yeah when I

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
hear that Kojima's left Konami

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
I kind of tend to believe it because there's

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
that big part of me that's like that didn't already

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
happen

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
SSG-100 Matt

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
says how stupid do they think we are

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
just stop Konami

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
Akdev says we're still together guys we're definitely not lying

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
and Dark Tetsuya says

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Konami go home you're drunk

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
I think that's the most succinct way

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
to put it it's kind of it's

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
it's not kind of sad it's very sad

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
but it is what it is

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
sounds like

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
one too many egos kind of drove that company

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
into the ground and it will never be

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
the company that brought us double

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
dribble anymore

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
anyhow on that note I should probably open

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
up the Skype line I didn't even have Skype open

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
yet like I actually don't even have the application

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
open since Bobby was not

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
on tonight we didn't do the call

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
before OLR so I don't even have the

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
application open I'm trying to launch it right now

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
but it's taking

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
it forever so I'm going to ask Loki

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
if he has any last minute stories while I try to get

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
Skype up and running my wife wants me to build

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
a catio for my cat

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
I think you should do it

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
I want one for Midna well like here's the thing

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
it's like yeah it's basically like an outdoor space

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
she already has the garage I already put a fucking

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
door in our garage door so she can

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
go out in the garage and she's

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
been hanging out in there now she wants

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
to go outside I mean I could do that

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
but like

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
I'm going to be

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
spending money to build this thing that's a

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
fucking monstrosity for this cat

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
and the cat won't appreciate it

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
I mean you just kind of know

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
in the back of your head the cat would never use it

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
no the cat would use it she'd love

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
she loves outdoors in fact but she's just

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
scared like the other day like we had

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
a Comcast over and I told

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
him like it's cool

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
oh no not Comcast it was

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
the air conditioning guy he was over to

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
kind of check the system for the you know the

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
heater and everything and

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
I told him like yeah it's cool you

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
can go out the back but just make sure you close the door

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
because the cat you know will get out

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
oh she's scared of outside but just make sure

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
you close it because I don't want the door open so

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
he leaves and leaves the fucking door open when

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
he leaves and so I come out there

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
to go close the door and I

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
was seeing the cat walking around

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
alright let's get to the phones I finally

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000

as an ipod owner

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000

02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:52.000
enough to use it get an ipod

02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:54.000

everything like whatever options you're

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.000
supposed to have it just shows up in two or three

02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000
really big buttons in front of you

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:02.000
you can't fuck it up you know

02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:04.000
you can't do all the cool things that you want to do

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:06.000
on like a real phone and it's kind of

02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:08.000
pricey but who kills

02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:10.000

I want a tweet I want one button tweet

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:14.000
I know some people that really liked those

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:16.000
ipods that were like the

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:18.000
iphone without the phone because that

02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:20.000
way there were a lot of people I knew that

02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:22.000
would have like the android phone but then they

02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.000
the ipod touch that's it the ipod touch

02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.000
that's what this is that I'm talking

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:28.000
to you on it's an ipod touch from five years

02:39:28.000 --> 02:39:30.000
ago I think you can skype on it

yeah oh yeah I mean the

02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.000
ipod touch the last one they did was equivalent

02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:36.000
to what a 4 an iphone 4

02:39:36.000 --> 02:39:38.000
or something I think yeah so I that's

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:40.000
you know skype is certainly on there

02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:42.000
it's nice I like it

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:44.000

ice trucker territory

fuck you to

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:10.000
guns man I just took my

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
fucking super gun course so I could get super guns

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
and there were people in that

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:16.000
fucking course and dude it's super guns man

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
like you guys are from America so you don't

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:20.000
own guns you know

02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:22.000
I don't own a gun shit like the big

02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:24.000
game guns

02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000
you know I'm talking your big bolt action

02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:28.000
Winchester's and shit yeah I did not know

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:30.000
there was such a thing as a super gun

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:32.000
but I'm just gonna assume

02:40:32.000 --> 02:40:34.000
I thought super guns were for playing video games

02:40:34.000 --> 02:40:36.000
that's a really big gun

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000
and then you can get a gun

02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.000
I saw women in this class man that

02:40:40.000 --> 02:40:42.000
there's no way they can hold a gun and shoot it

02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000
and they get to go buy them now

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:46.000
well now now now aim

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:48.000
knows no gender

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.000
no physics don't know no gender

02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:52.000
either man fucking gravity works the same

02:40:52.000 --> 02:40:54.000
everyday all the time the same

02:40:54.000 --> 02:40:56.000
no days off man

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.000
Dungeon Buster in chat

02:40:58.000 --> 02:41:00.000
says super gun is that the one

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:02.000
Saddam had you know those weapons of mass

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.000
destruction I don't know I somehow

02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:06.000
don't think Canada would have them if

02:41:06.000 --> 02:41:08.000
that were the case actually if you want to have some

02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000
historical facts for you that in the

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:12.000
1980s when Iraq was

02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.000
still considered an ally

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.000
of the United States there was a Canadian man

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.000
a Canadian man doctor

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:20.000
fuck I don't know Fongoli whatever but he was

02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.000
Canadian and he was building the fucking

02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:24.000
super gun in Iraq it was just a

02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:26.000
big rifle big fucking

02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:28.000
bullets essentially they said they took the

02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000
Canadian the genius of the Canadian and they

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000
gave him the unlimited wealth of the

02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000
American Federal Trade Bank thingy

02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000
whatever it's called and then the

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:38.000
fucking this is really racist but it's true

02:41:38.000 --> 02:41:40.000
the Israelis didn't like it so they killed

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
them

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
we never got to see the fucking super Canadian

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:46.000
gun all we get all we get is the

02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000
fucking gay little jerk off arm in

02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:50.000
space that jerks off the space shuttle

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
watch it watch it

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
you don't have to make a space shuttle just

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
fucking jerk it off now hold on hold on

02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:58.000
because this is the

02:41:58.000 --> 02:42:00.000
thing is that you guys in Canada

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:02.000
know how to build big guns

02:42:02.000 --> 02:42:04.000
so is all your politeness and all that

02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.000
it's hiding something isn't it I knew it

02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:08.000
all this time

02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:10.000

02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.000

02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:38.000
there's a whole lot of people that

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:40.000
are lining up to move to Canada

02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:42.000
Donald Trump somehow actually gets elected

02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:44.000
so I'm just oh I want Donald Trump

02:42:44.000 --> 02:42:46.000
to get elected he needs if

02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:48.000
there's anything right now that's

02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:50.000
going to save you if Donald Trump gets elected

02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:52.000
it's our Justin Trudeau I think you could

02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.000
be in power for the next 20 years

02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000
all right anyway what did you call

02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000
you did not call in to talk about guns or politics

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:00.000
what you want to talk about tonight

02:43:00.000 --> 02:43:02.000
I don't even

02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:04.000
know anymore man

02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:06.000
have you been playing video

02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000
games at all dude yeah I was just playing

02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000
check it out man I was just playing

02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:12.000
some Grand Theft Auto I'm like oh that's

02:43:12.000 --> 02:43:14.000
cool you can't really see it on

02:43:14.000 --> 02:43:16.000
the screen over here and I was actually

02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.000
calling to ask if there's any players out

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:20.000
there that would like to play Grand Theft Auto with me

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
on the Xbox

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.000
360 my name is Jim Salley also at

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:26.000
Xbox is there a way for people

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:28.000
to just give me money in

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:30.000
Grand Theft Auto 5 Loki can

02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:32.000
you give Jim Salley money

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:34.000
I think there's

02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.000
maybe a way to do that

02:43:36.000 --> 02:43:38.000
most likely

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
you would have to just like

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
I don't know

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
it'd be an agreement with somebody to like

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:46.000
put a bounty on them well actually

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:48.000
no that wouldn't work either cause you

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.000
lose half the money then right

02:43:50.000 --> 02:43:52.000
yeah I don't know if there's a way to give money

02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:54.000
you

02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:56.000
normally can't like you can

02:43:56.000 --> 02:43:58.000
throw bets maybe

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:00.000
you can throw bets for

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.000
you know like different races or something

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:04.000
like that just bet a bunch of money and then have someone

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
win I mean that's one way to do it

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
I think there's a way to also like after missions

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
you are able to split up

02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:12.000
the

02:44:12.000 --> 02:44:14.000
taking from that and you're supposed to be able to give

02:44:14.000 --> 02:44:16.000
extra money but I think they cut out a lot of

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
that too because people are using that to

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:20.000
when they're modding the game they would cheat that

02:44:20.000 --> 02:44:22.000
way and you know give millions of dollars

02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:24.000
I don't know

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
I don't remember if I have much money in the Xbox

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:28.000
360 version anymore

02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.000
there's

02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:32.000
gotta be someone out there that can help me out

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:34.000
and listen Jim Sally

02:44:34.000 --> 02:44:36.000
needs your help everybody you need to help him out

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:38.000
if you know the answer shout it out and chat

02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.000
I mean Rockstar's answer is gonna be just buy

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:42.000
the fucking shark cards but

02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:44.000
yeah

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
exactly

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
that's how I feel as well

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:50.000
so now I'm gonna get onto the phone just do missions

02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:52.000

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000

02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:16.000
way through to all the different levels and stuff

02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:18.000

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:46.000
at the heavens

02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:48.000
but I see a bear

02:45:48.000 --> 02:45:50.000
you point your gun to Jesus so you don't shoot nobody

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:52.000
but for my students

02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:54.000

he did have it running on the TV

02:46:44.000 --> 02:46:46.000
he might have been doing that multitasking thing

02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:48.000
I need to go back and play

02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:50.000

I think I still have it on 360

02:46:58.000 --> 02:47:00.000

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
traffic but I'll look here real quick

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
actdeft is mentioning in chat

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:50.000
them's fightin' herds got funded

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:52.000
that was the game he called in to talk about last week

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:54.000
but they had hit their funding

02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:56.000
point at that point

02:47:56.000 --> 02:47:58.000
but they were in that last push to hit some stretch goals

02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:00.000
and I think they got a couple of them after all

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
so congrats

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:04.000
ummm

02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:06.000
let's see

02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:08.000
I was looking at some tweets over at

02:48:08.000 --> 02:48:10.000
twitter.com slash OLR

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000
um at James Nighthawk

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:14.000
was thanking Dark Soccer for reading the email

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:16.000
on OLR last week

02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:18.000
glad to hear you're a fellow fan of good grammar

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:20.000
in emails too

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:22.000
not only is she a fan, she demands it

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:24.000
it's an expectation, it has to happen

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:26.000
that's right

02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:28.000
YYR at the end of the show last week

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.000
was letting us know about a massive

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
Dragon Age sale on Xbox

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:34.000
I mean obviously this is over by now

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:36.000
but I'll just mention Inquisition was 20 bucks

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:38.000
Dragon Age 2 5, Origins 3 74

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:40.000
don't know if I love it

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:42.000
where should I start?

02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:44.000
where should somebody start with the Dragon Age series if they want to get into it

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:46.000
I think they should just go to Inquisition at this point

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:48.000
myself

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:50.000
you can start

02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:52.000
Inquisition without knowing much in the background

02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:54.000
but you would probably

02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:56.000
have it start off with whatever the

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
default official canon is

02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:00.000
however

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:02.000
if you really

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:04.000
do want the story beginning to end

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:06.000
you have to go Origins, DA2

02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000
I mean

02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:10.000
Awakenings is a good one

02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:12.000
I actually

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:14.000
I'd say in order of my favorite

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:16.000
games I would go Inquisition, DA2

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:18.000
Origins, and then Awakening

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000
I'm actually one of those people

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:22.000
who is not the biggest fan of the first Dragon Age

02:49:22.000 --> 02:49:24.000
except for Alistair

02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:26.000
but there was a lot of people that didn't like

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
Dragon Age 2

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
I love Dragon Age 2, I freaking think it's fun

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
fair enough

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
I would say

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
just having been in similar shoes

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
you're totally ok starting Inquisition without

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
having necessarily played everything

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
else, so it's fine

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
and in fact I think the battle

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
system is a lot more accessible

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:48.000
I think playing the old games to get

02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.000
through the story can be a bit of a

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
slog

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
it is a good story if you can tolerate it

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:56.000
but it's kind of like Mass Effect

02:49:56.000 --> 02:49:58.000
the best Mass Effect game

02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:00.000
is

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000
I say it's tied between 2 and 3

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
but 2 really is

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000
the peak of the series, but I think 3

02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000
is much better than a lot of people give it credit for

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.000
because I love the multiplayer in 3 and all that

02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:12.000
and so it's like, yeah you gotta play Mass Effect

02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000
but you do kinda have to

02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:16.000
push through Mass Effect 1 because

02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:18.000
the story is still really good even if the

02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:20.000
Mako scenes will drive you up a fucking wall

02:50:20.000 --> 02:50:22.000
but it's still worth playing

02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:24.000
alright

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
let's see, DungeonBuster in chat says

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
not a fan of Dragon Age 2 myself, but lore wise

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
it's useful, it was fun playing a

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
smart ass mage in that one

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
so apparently there's a rumor that

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
Final Fantasy DS

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
will be coming to arcades next month

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
oh yeah, I'd heard that, yeah

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
good, more stuff in arcades to play

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
except that'll probably just be Japan, not here, right?

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
yeah, probably

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
I would like to see it come to consoles someday

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
hopefully

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
get on it, get on that

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
remake a game you just put out

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000
for consoles

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
alright, that's gonna do it

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
the phones aren't lighting up and it's about 9 o'clock

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
here on the west coast, I think we're gonna go ahead and wrap

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
up for the night, but I do want to thank you

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
guys for tuning in to Orange Laundry Radio

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
remember as we say every week, if you enjoyed the show

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000
please tell a friend, or 5

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000
or 15, about Orange

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.000
Laundry Radio, we are the show where every gamer

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000
has a voice, but a lot of people out there

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.000
we're not notable enough to be on Wikipedia

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.000
so we have to really

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:24.000
rely on your voices and word of mouth

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
to help us get out there

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
and we really appreciate it, so

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000
that goes a long way

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.000
leave us a fake 5 star review on Amazon

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.000
leave us a real one on

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:36.000
iTunes or Stitcher Radio

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.000
or wherever it is that you found this program

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000
all that stuff goes a very long way

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
time to go around and get everybody's final thought

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000
I guess I'll start

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.000
my final thought is

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000
I need a nap after how delicious

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:50.000
those pumpkin rolls were

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.000
so BRB nap

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
except, ooh I want to play more Dragon Quest Heroes

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.000
so maybe no nap

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:58.000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:00.000
according to this quiz, I'm

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:02.000
Princess Aurora

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:04.000
from Sleeping Beauty

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.000
and before we get to Loki's final thought

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000
I want to say AkumaJP says, Dissida is on

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
handheld console though, that is true

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
I'm talking about the arcade one, yeah I understand

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:14.000
that that one is, we want the new shiny one

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:16.000
on Playstation 4, alright, just making sure

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000
we clarify that there, anyway

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:20.000
last but not least, Loki, your final thought

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:22.000
my final thought is I need to work on my costume

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000
and also Ultimate Spiderman

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000
because Spiderman is one of the greatest cartoons

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:28.000
that they have for Marvel Spiderman

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.000
I mean, the writing is great

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
it's just great

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000
great, that does it

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:36.000
for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:38.000
thank you guys so much for listening tonight, appreciate it

we will be back in 7 days to do it

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
all over again

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
have a great week everybody, and Happy Halloween

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:46.000
