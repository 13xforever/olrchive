Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This week we go back to the future with a nod to Mattel's still unreleased hoverboard, the most stylish time machine, and even a classic video game.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
All this and the actual news of late October 2015 along with your calls, comments, and more starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Great Scott

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Indeed, see that's my cue to throw the toilet paper for the movie's ice watch. Alright, anyway.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hi everybody, welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 619 of our show, October the 25th of 2015.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:03,000
My name is Rob Roberts, you can follow me on Twitter at Skie, S-K-I-E, and joining me here in studio to talk about the latest and greatest in video games, video gaming, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hi.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
How are you?

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm alive.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
How does it feel to be in the future? Because you know that's what Jason was referencing in the intro, we have some news around that this week, and lots of people talking about that this week.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Because that day, in case you hadn't heard, because it wasn't just like everywhere, that day that Marty McFly travels to the future actually happened this week.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
As opposed to all the Tumblr memes that have said that for the past four years, that every day is the day that Marty McFly arrives, that day actually happened this past week.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It feels like a struggle.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Every day is a struggle.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Because of all the people who want to hold us back.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You need your-

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Embrace the future.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That's right, and will deny me my hoverboard, and my flying car, and so forth. Why is that that in every perception of the future, there's flying cars?

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Because traffic sucks.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Traffic does.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But imagine this.

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Traffic is worse.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If you had flying cars that have to figure out a way to put lanes up there, just if you want your example of what shit would be with flying cars, look at the fifth element.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Or like Star Wars. I think they sometimes show like on Course Con, they have like-

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
No.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But I know what you mean, the fifth element, because he was the taxi driver, and so they had a lot of traffic shots and that, so.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yeah. Or that episode of Doctor Who with all of the cars in the tunnel.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Mm-hmm.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And the cat people and the kittens.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yeah, that.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Also welcome, everybody, to the future. Tech master, Loki!

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hello.

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hey, Loki, how are you doing?

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Good, multi-sasking.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Good. Yes, I see. You were actually playing Minecraft during the show.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yeah.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Are you trying to build something during the show? Is there something extremely important going on in Minecraft?

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
No, this is basically what is the equivalent of gaming masturbation, just because there is no point to this game in survival mode, so.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah, but some would argue that there is a point to masturbation, Loki.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:12,000
True, but there's really no point to this, you know, game in survival mode. I mean, so I'm just basically down in my mind, hacking at the wall.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So that would be more like a video game nap. It's just a video game nap.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Maybe, yeah, nap. That works.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It might feel good, and then you're gonna regret that you just wasted the whole day doing it. I think that would be a little more appropriate.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
All right, say hello as well to our chat room, because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
vog.network.com, and if you're listening live, you should participate with us and chat.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:43,000
live.vog.network.com, and where Tigerclaw is reminding us in our chat room, we still have four years till we get to the year of Blade Runner, which is 2019.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So we have-

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Guess what? The cars won't still be flying.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
We are two years from the running man.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
They might not be flying, but they might be driving themselves. I feel like we're getting closer and closer to that whole thing.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Google's doing one, supposedly Apple's doing one. I don't know, rumors.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Of course, there's the whole Tesla thing this week where now it's not just cruise control, but now it's cruise drivable and things like that.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I feel like in four years, it just might be the whole kit and caboodle where the cars are just driving themselves.

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I can't be the only one that's disappointed that there's not Tesla coil in every Tesla car.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm just saying, I was promised giant Tesla coils for Command and Conquer Red Alert, and I expect giant Tesla coils being able to destroy my enemies with.

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You demand it. Brad from Pod Culture says, get back to me when kit is a reality.

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yes, what year was that? But that was present day, right? Knight Rider? Wasn't that present day? Wasn't it in the future?

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That was the 80s.

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It was like a James Bond-esque kind of thing.

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That was the 80s.

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yes, that was the 80s.

69
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But why couldn't we have combined Knight Rider and Magnum P.I. and have kit have been in a Ferrari Testarossa and the Hoth have a huge porn stash?

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Maybe there should have been a crossover. We're going to talk about an interesting video game crossover a little later on, just to shift it back to games a little bit, though.

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:23,000
But I did want to say, with this whole fact that Knight Rider was the 80s, and everybody's celebrating Back to the Future this week, and the fact that we are living in the future.

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I think anybody that saw the Jem and the Holograms movie this week would rather be living in the past. Just saying.

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
One of my friends actually liked it.

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Really?

75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And I was like, no.

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Here's the thing. I think the Metacritic is what, not that I let Metacritic run my life, but I'm curious. So I think it was like a 29% on Metacritic.

77
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And it's like, okay, well, I've seen worse. There's worse movies. I feel like Mall Cop 2 probably had a lower Metacritic rating than Jem.

78
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And maybe that should be the tagline. Jem and the Holograms. Hey, Adam Sandler's not in it.

79
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But it's still just, it's a complete violation of my childhood.

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Believe me. Believe me. I loved the Jem 80s cartoon. And I feel like I heard, read this somewhere, that they took somebody else's script and was like, oh, we have this Jem license we're going to use, or we're going to lose if we don't use it.

81
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So we're just going to insert Jem into this existing script that has nothing to do with Jem. And I think that's, yeah, what they got didn't really work.

82
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I was hoping, when I heard they were making a movie out of Jem, I was hoping it was going to be more like the Josie and the Pussycats movie.

83
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Which, if you haven't seen it, is like, it's one of those like, it's so bad, cheesy, over the top, it's kind of great.

84
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I think that Josie and the Pussycats knows what it is.

85
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah, come on, Josie and the Pussycats opens with a boy band singing their number one hit, Back Door Lover. That's funny.

86
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And it's one of those things that kids don't get.

87
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That's like 21 Jump Street stuff, you know, where that movie knows what it is.

88
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Exactly.

89
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's a parody of, you know, it's its own movie, but it's also a parody of the genre.

90
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Parker Posey was in it. I mean, that's instant, like, that's an instant plus 15 on the Metacritic at least. Parker Posey's in it, therefore it lifts it up a little bit. Come on.

91
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Alan Alchemy in our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com says, Space Channel 5 is in Josie and the Pussycats.

92
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That's right, because there was, the whole like, brand insertion and commercialization was a big thing, and I seem to remember like, Sega and Dreamcast are some of those brands that show up, because that was, you know, about the time.

93
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Kaijuto in chat says, I was a huge Gem fan and I don't care. The minute I found out it was live action, I was always already out and didn't care.

94
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yeah, and I think most people are just like, I do not consider this canon. It's just I'm turning my back on it. It's not what they say it is. And there's that.

95
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Anyway, how did we get on movies and TVs? We're supposed to be a video game show, but hey, you know what? I know a lot of you guys, when you're playing video games, you're probably watching movies on your second monitor. At least I'm told that's what a lot of people do.

96
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I can't do that. Do you guys, let me ask that a little bit here for part of our kickoff topic, because I feel like the kickoff topic I have is ground we've tread before, but let me ask this real quick is, do you guys multitask when you play games?

97
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Let me start with Loki, because I think the answer is going to be pretty obvious here.

98
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:35,000
No, normally I don't. And that's the funny thing is, well, at least I don't intend to. But usually the wife is watching something stupid on TV, and so it's kind of hard to ignore it.

99
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So you multitask not by choice?

100
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Not by choice, yes. It's forced upon my eyes as I'm playing a game, usually like Mario Maker or something like that on a second screen. Unless, of course, I have the TV, in which case, no, there are no distractions.

101
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And how was Grey's Anatomy this week?

102
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We're already done with Grey's Anatomy, in fact, which she's done with her other stupid ABC family movie or show about some kid that was accused of murder of his aunt or some stupid thing like that.

103
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And now we're on to classic episodes from Roseanne, which isn't so bad.

104
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That's not so bad. I would watch that one.

105
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Roseanne, it's a good show.

106
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yeah, there you go. At least you and the wife can compromise once in a while.

107
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I should be concerned that she aspires to be Roseanne, so that...

108
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But Jamie's the one that goes around going, Dan! Coffee!

109
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,000
No, it's usually Dan playing in the front room and me playing on my computer. We don't do movies. God, that's like not normal.

110
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I was just gonna tell Loki real quick, though, I would be worried for when Fuller House comes out, because that's gonna be the one that I know your wife is gonna be there day one.

111
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I would watch that. I like Fuller House. I mean, it was okay. I just think it's gonna be, no, here's the one I'm fucking worried about, okay?

112
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's the fact that they're announcing, hey, guess what? We're gonna do another Gilmore Girls series. I'm like, fuck no. Fuck no. I am not fucking listening to that shit.

113
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I don't understand how they talk like that. It's just they talk so quick. God, it's like how I hear the conversations.

114
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The way they talk in that show is not the way people really talk, and it bothers me a lot.

115
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Kinda like robots set to 1.5 speed or something like that.

116
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:27,000
SSJ100Matt says, does listening to great podcasts from the VoG network, cheap plug, while playing games count as multitasking?

117
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Sort of, and that I can do, actually, especially during MMOs. I actually get a lot of my podcasts listening in while I'm grinding in an MMO, and I count Diablo as an MMO.

118
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Because in an MMO, even though the music can be amazing, like Final Fantasy XIV, one of the greatest soundtracks in all of games, let alone an MMO,

119
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
once you've heard the song literally 5,000 times, you're kinda ready to turn it down and listen to something else.

120
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So yes, and I think that's a great plug for podcasts in general, is that they make a great kind of background music when you're doing gaming or what have you that doesn't take your visual attention away.

121
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Jamie, I know you started to kind of answer this question a little bit because you said Dan would be in the front room, you'd be in the back.

122
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Do you ever multitask while you're playing a game? Do you do the game on one monitor or something else on the second monitor?

123
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'll chat with Becky sometimes.

124
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Chat.

125
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So I'll keep my chat stuff open, or I'll probably have an FAQ if it's a hard puzzle or something.

126
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But I pretty much give the game my attention and just chat on the side.

127
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What's interesting about the chat, I think I would say that's about as far as I go with it too, is that I'll either have Google Hangouts, which is what I use these days,

128
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I have Google Hangouts open on another window and I'll do the chat thing, kind of like that.

129
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But I find that with a lot of games, especially if it's an MMO and I happen to have people on, I can chat within the game.

130
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Or like Battle.net has several games that are all tied together that are all pretty popular that you can kind of chat in between the games.

131
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I was catching up with a few people from WoW last night. I just loaded up Battle.net just for the sake of it.

132
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Actually now that I have the full build of Hearthstone, not Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, so I was installing that in Diablo 3 the other day.

133
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Nice.

134
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And just chatting with folks from the guild.

135
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Yeah, because obviously I played WoW pretty hardcore for a few years. I was doing the podcast for a while that was about nothing but WoW.

136
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And I found that Battle.net, while I'm playing Diablo, or the rare occasion I'm playing Heroes of the Storm, a great way to talk to some of my old friends from WoW who are still playing.

137
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
There's this couple we used to raid with who lives up in Canada, and I can still keep in touch with them.

138
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
And then some of you guys know Gemet. I see him online once in a while and I'll talk to him or whoever else from those days.

139
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I kind of like, as much as I hated the real ID and all that stuff in Battle.net at first, the concept of the chat client that goes across multiple games, I really liked.

140
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Steam, I would be a fool to leave out. Steam obviously is another huge way that people can communicate across games.

141
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's a lot easier than using Tails.

142
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Yeah, you've beeped me on Steam, DarkSagra. Certainly. There you go.

143
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I tend to, for folks in the free company, because I hate that you can't chat while you're in an instance, so I just use Steam for that.

144
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Oh, there you go. That works. Steam is a really good workaround for all that kind of stuff.

145
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I don't have to keep typing slash Tails slash Tails.

146
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I think you do slash T as a shortcut, just so you know.

147
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I still hate having to do slash anything.

148
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Quick side tangent before I get to our chat room, and this will be totally random, but tonight I made DarkSagra before the show try this pumpkin pie soda, which I couldn't stand.

149
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I had it last night, but Alan's dying to know. What did you think of it?

150
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's like cream soda with pumpkin aftertaste.

151
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
See, I didn't like it.

152
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But not good cream soda, and not good pumpkin.

153
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Okay, I think she's drinking it just because.

154
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It doesn't suck.

155
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Cream soda, yuck.

156
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I love all things pumpkin, but I do not like that.

157
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I love cream soda a lot, to the point that I'll drink almost any kind of cream soda, but it's novel. I've had it once, and I'm vaguely thirsty, but I think that what's about to come out of the oven is going to be infinitely better than this.

158
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yes, DarkSagra's baking during OLR tonight.

159
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I didn't make it from scratch. Fuck that.

160
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Alright, Dartusuya is asking, let me guess, is it a Jones soda? No, it's some random store brand that they happen to have.

161
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I think it'd taste good if it was a Jones soda.

162
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yeah, let's see, Zippo25 in chat over at live.vognetwork.com says, I can play games while I watch movies, but not watch movies while I play games.

163
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
That's an interesting way to put it.

164
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I can't even do Netflix in games, because I'll keep wanting to watch whatever it is, and I can't focus on the game. I can't do both at the same time. I just can't.

165
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Let's see, Kaijuto in chat says, the new Diablo is Zelda Triforce Heroes. It's the shit.

166
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You know, I didn't pick that up this week, surprisingly, and I'll tell you why in a little bit. I've been playing something else, but I'm very curious about that, Triforce Heroes.

167
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I want to hear more feedback from my friends about that game.

168
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Let's see, Brad from Pod Culture says, the Jones soda pumpkin pie was kind of nasty, too, when they all drank it on Pod Culture.

169
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And Tigerclaw talking about Triforce Heroes says, the only thing is all three players share the hearts. If any one person dies, you restart the level.

170
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Ouch. I bet that doesn't get annoying whatsoever, I'm sure.

171
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Okay, so Halloween's this week. Happy Halloween to all of our OLR listeners, and I hope whatever it is you're doing this weekend will be safe for you.

172
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Halloween makes me miss Radiscoll and Devil Doll.

173
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Why is that?

174
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Just because the second episode that they did was a Halloween one. It was called Halloweeny. It was funny.

175
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Random.

176
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I know.

177
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,000
So I'm going to ask you guys, how do you plan to celebrate Halloween, and is there any gaming involved? Will you be doing any special Halloween gaming?

178
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'll start. I am absolutely going to, and I think a lot of people will be doing this, but I will be playing the PT demo on Halloween.

179
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Hopefully I'll be able to squeeze in between some other stuff I'm doing on Halloween, because I'm kind of busy.

180
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Rocky Horror, obviously, is also a really big Halloween thing, and I'm hosting that here in SAC on Halloween.

181
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:45,000
So I've got to make sure I can kind of squeeze that in, but I do plan to do a stream, hopefully, of PT on Halloween, because you've got to.

182
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And I'm sure a lot of people are going to be doing it, those that haven't lost it from their PlayStation 4s. I've got to do PT.

183
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
So what about you guys for Halloween?

184
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Going to the Bay Area.

185
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yeah.

186
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
See the mills.

187
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Any, well I guess, yeah I'll be going to that too, at least making a cameo, but any gaming at that?

188
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm sure there'll be some gaming.

189
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Because we all met playing music-based games, so.

190
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And then, I don't know, it depends on when we come back, what else we're going to do.

191
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
But hey, it's a half day, so I'm sure I'll find something to do.

192
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Is there any?

193
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Maybe some, my favorite of the Silent Hills.

194
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Might have to happen.

195
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Which is?

196
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Three.

197
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Three is my favorite.

198
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So you can play with the Heather Beam?

199
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Heather Beam!

200
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Because it's funny for the Heather Beam, like, it's her Japanese voice.

201
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
So it makes me laugh. Heather Beam!

202
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
So.

203
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Alright.

204
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Loki, how about you for Halloween?

205
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
No, I'm not doing anything.

206
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You're not doing anything? I thought you were going to go to this elaborate costume and all this stuff?

207
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Oh, well I'm making the costume, yeah, that's for work though, but that's not for Halloween, that's just for like the day before.

208
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That's just for work, I see.

209
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
So, any gaming? If you're not going to do anything, are you going to do any gaming at all for Halloween? Scary game?

210
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
No.

211
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Do you scare your kids?

212
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
No, they'll probably go trick or treating.

213
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And then I'll eat their candy.

214
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
That's like the advantage of being a parent.

215
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
That's the trick.

216
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You know, I did just remember the other thing I'm probably going to have going on when I get back that night.

217
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Is working on my Grey Warden staff.

218
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Oh, yeah, for your cosplay you're doing for gamer acts.

219
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yeah, I've got all of this stuff ready to put together.

220
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Nice.

221
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
And Victoria is making the costume.

222
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Awesome.

223
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
But I have to build-

224
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Who did my Joker costume, by the way, if you saw it on-

225
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I have to build my staff and that's going to be the fun part.

226
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Okay.

227
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And I've got to modify my boots.

228
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
That'll be fun.

229
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It'll be a neat costume.

230
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Awesome.

231
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Well, I know you want to go tend to the little pumpkin rolls.

232
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Well, hold on, hold on before you go.

233
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Before you go.

234
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Okay, well good.

235
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
They're cooling for a bit.

236
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Then while they cool, I want to get into our gaming weeks.

237
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Okay.

238
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Because of course we like to start off the show talking about the types of video games that we've been playing this week.

239
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So, Dark Soccer-

240
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Mind games.

241
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
How was your gaming week?

242
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It was all right.

243
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I've been playing some more Happy Home Designer, Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer.

244
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Now I have to design Town Hall, so that's interesting.

245
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Do you need the amiibo cards for that?

246
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Because I saw a ton of them yesterday and I was like, maybe I should be buying these for Jamie.

247
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Because I don't think these are like super easy to find right now.

248
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I have a small pack of them that came with it, but I don't know.

249
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I haven't opened the cards.

250
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Oh, okay.

251
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So if you find any of the neat cards, like the kitty cats or any of them-

252
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Aren't they all blind reveals?

253
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Yeah, I guess they are.

254
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
So just buy me a pack and I'll thank you for them.

255
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
All right, well, BRB, I have to go back to Chico where I saw them.

256
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
They have them at the Toys R Us near my house.

257
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Oh yeah, that's good.

258
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But I think I'm worth $6 in a trip to Chico.

259
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I downloaded Diablo 3 and Heroes of the Storm, so I'm going to be trying to get into that.

260
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Although a lot of my coworkers play Hearthstone 2.

261
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm like, no more Magic games, no more.

262
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
We've been playing Super Mario 3D World.

263
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Dan's playing through Super Mario 2 Advance on the Wii U, playing the Virtual Console version.

264
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Oh, right.

265
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And we got Tank, Tank, Tank.

266
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
So we're probably going to be playing that tonight.

267
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Really? I didn't like that game on the Wii U at all.

268
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Well, Dan just found it and got super excited and bought it.

269
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Oh, so they have that free, like the free to play version.

270
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's just really a demo.

271
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
We've got the game, the game game.

272
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Okay, wow.

273
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Oh yeah, Dragon Age Inquisition.

274
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm back to actually playing through two new side-by-side playthroughs.

275
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Because I'm comparing the Templar playthrough with the Mage playthrough.

276
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And I'm also trying to finish Origins, but it's kind of hard to go back and play Origins after playing Inquisition with how pretty it is.

277
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah, same.

278
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And how much better the game plays, oh my god.

279
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
That's why I was never able to beat Origins.

280
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Origins is like a clusterfuck for fighting.

281
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Yeah.

282
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I really like the combat in Dragon Age 2.

283
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I like the combat in Inquisition a whole lot better too.

284
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
So I was playing that and I started Beginner's Guide.

285
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Which is really just a game dedicated to the games of this other person who I think stopped making games.

286
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So it's basically this person's old levels and everything and someone walking through and talking about game design.

287
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And it's by the folks that did the Stanley parable, so it's pretty neat.

288
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Nice.

289
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And I bought Elder Scrolls Online.

290
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
But I haven't started it yet.

291
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's 20 bucks on the Humble sale, I think it's over though.

292
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Oh wow, okay.

293
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I got the Capcom Humble bundle.

294
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
And I played Final Fantasy XIV for a little bit, so it's kind of...

295
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You've been busy.

296
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Busier than usual, but I've got crap ton of other stuff I need to get done, so probably going to be slow.

297
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
In the rush to Halloween.

298
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Loki, how was your gaming week besides the Minecraft you're playing right now?

299
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I did play Minecraft earlier this week as well, so there's that.

300
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
What else did I play?

301
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Minecraft Story Mode.

302
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Not because I'm just obsessed with Minecraft or something, but because I wanted to check it out.

303
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
See what exactly they're going to do for a story-based Minecraft game.

304
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
And it was okay.

305
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I was asking Rob earlier how the other Telltale games are as far as, are they pretty linear?

306
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Do they have a lot of stuff that you have to do, like puzzle solving?

307
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Because I'm coming into it thinking, oh hey, I used to play these old PC adventure games and stuff from LucasArts a while back.

308
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Is this anything like this?

309
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And it seemed pretty linear.

310
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's entertaining, I guess.

311
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It was short.

312
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I finished the first episode in about two hours, maybe.

313
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
If that.

314
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
And there wasn't really a whole lot of interaction other than just dialogue.

315
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And the rest is kind of just watching it and there's a few quick time events.

316
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
That's about it, I mean.

317
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Yeah, I kind of found the Telltale games to not be, at least the ones I've played, like Walking Dead and Jurassic Park even I played.

318
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I didn't find those games to be super linear.

319
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I imagine Minecraft, because it's geared towards kids, might be a little more linear than the others.

320
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
But I also didn't find it to be as rich as maybe like the King's Quest games and stuff used to be.

321
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It was very different than that, I think.

322
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Yeah, I don't know. It was okay.

323
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I mean, I was just kind of curious to see how they would kind of throw a story into that.

324
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And of course they have different characters, not Steve or anything.

325
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Right.

326
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
My son kept going, like, you know, is Steve in that?

327
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm like, no, he's not in this game.

328
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
And it's like, why isn't he in there? Why isn't Steve in there?

329
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Because Steve died.

330
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Because Steve's not in the game.

331
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Although he should make a cameo. I think that they should do that.

332
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I kind of got, I don't know.

333
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I was getting a little bit annoyed with Patton Oswalt's voice acting, though, in the game.

334
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
But whatever. It was okay.

335
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Whether I'm going to pick up the rest of the episodes, I'm interested.

336
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
But it's not something that I'm going to make a priority right now.

337
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Especially since they discount that stuff, like, all the time.

338
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So I may just wait for it to be discounted.

339
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
But it was okay.

340
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I mean, I guess it's worth five bucks.

341
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Which is what I paid for it.

342
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
And then you can play it through it again.

343
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
And there's different, you know, dialogue things that can happen and stuff.

344
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Sure.

345
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I tried Super Time Force a little bit.

346
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I didn't really get past the demo or the tutorial portion.

347
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I just kind of got sick of it.

348
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
It was mainly just killing time while Minecraft Story Mode was downloading.

349
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
And then, what else?

350
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I...

351
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Let's see.

352
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I mentioned Minecraft already.

353
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I started playing Final Fantasy VI again.

354
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Just a little bit.

355
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Because I actually started Final Fantasy VII.

356
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
And then it just did not look good anymore.

357
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I mean, it was awesome on PlayStation 1.

358
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
But, oh my god.

359
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Now it just kind of...

360
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It did not hold up too well.

361
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Or maybe I just don't like it the way that they kind of up-rezzed everything for this update for the PC version.

362
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
So maybe that's the thing that bothers me about it.

363
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
But, other than that, I mean Final Fantasy VI is amazing.

364
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So, I started that.

365
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I don't know if I'll finish it or not.

366
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
But, it's a fun game.

367
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
And then Ingress.

368
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I played Ingress and got to level 6.

369
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I hit level 2.

370
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Did you really? Congrats.

371
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yeah.

372
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I don't know if I need to finish all the tutorial stuff in that.

373
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
No, you don't. I never did.

374
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Do you get a badge for that or something?

375
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
No, I don't think so.

376
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
They had to suspend the verify thing because they didn't have the resources for it.

377
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
But, I was going to ask real quick about Final Fantasy VII.

378
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Whatever happened to the...

379
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Remember last year at the PlayStation experience?

380
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
They announced Final Fantasy VII, but it was just the PC version on PlayStation 4.

381
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
And everybody was like, fuck off. That's not what we asked for.

382
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
And then, Sony finally delivered it at E3.

383
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
It was like, okay, okay. We were just fucking with you. Here it is.

384
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
But, I thought that PC thing was still coming.

385
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Like, is that not happening now because of the other remake?

386
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I hope not.

387
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I hope it's not coming.

388
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I don't like the PC version that well.

389
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I just don't think it looks that great.

390
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Put up just the regular version of the game.

391
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Have it play on the PlayStation 4. Done.

392
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
You know what I mean?

393
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Because they have it out there already as a title.

394
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Hell, just make it so we can play PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 games.

395
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Hell, it'll all have itself for PlayStation 1 games.

396
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Because, shit.

397
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
If a fucking PSP can play PlayStation 1 games,

398
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
the fucking PlayStation 4 has the power to be able to emulate PlayStation 1 games.

399
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I really feel like that's an unlock we're gonna get at this PlayStation experience.

400
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I just really feel like, you know, the Christmas season's a good time to announce something like that.

401
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I just, I really hope that's the mic drop.

402
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Because, like, that would be great.

403
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Because, like, I have a few games from that that I got.

404
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
You know, I purchased, like, some older PlayStation 1 games.

405
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I mean, it'd be nice. Or even PlayStation 2 games.

406
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Like, I've got, like, Katamari that's just sitting there that, you know, I had to boot up my PlayStation 3 to be able to play that stuff.

407
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It's stupid.

408
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I don't want to have to do that.

409
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
But, um, alright.

410
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
So, Ingress, though. I'm playing lots of Ingress.

411
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Not so much the last couple days.

412
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Because I've been really trying to focus on having to work on my costume.

413
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Which hasn't happened.

414
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Because I've been super tired.

415
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Like, today I was trying to even do the show role and I fell asleep.

416
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Because I was exhausted.

417
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I wonder why your stories went up later than usual.

418
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
So, yeah. I was doing that while my kids were napping.

419
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
And, like, I just passed out.

420
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Because I'm so tired.

421
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
So, unfortunately, last night was going to be one of the times I had to work on that.

422
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
And it just didn't happen.

423
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
But, ideally, I'm going to be a Lego minifigure of Loki.

424
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Because that would be funny.

425
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Not yourself, but...

426
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
But Loki from Marvel Superheroes.

427
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Or Lego Marvel Superheroes.

428
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Nice.

429
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
And if I don't have enough time, then it'll have to be something else.

430
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I look forward to the pictures.

431
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Yeah. So, it'll be something Lego related.

432
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I'm going to work on it tonight.

433
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I'm going to try.

434
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Alright. As far as my gaming week goes.

435
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Mostly the same games.

436
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Diablo 3.

437
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I don't remember if I mentioned it last week.

438
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I've now hit Paragon, like, 330.

439
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
In my adventures in Diablo 3 and playing with Alan.

440
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I have surpassed the Paragon level of my non-seasonal characters.

441
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Which would be all the previous seasons.

442
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
And pre that seasonal stuff combined.

443
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Because your seasonal XP dumps into the main pool every time a season ends.

444
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
So, I've now surpassed that point.

445
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
So, that should tell you about how much Diablo I've been playing lately.

446
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
However, also, you kind of get more experience now.

447
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Because the K'Nai's Cube, which gives you the power of three more legendaries.

448
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Allows you to do much harder content.

449
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
And so you're getting more XP through that harder content.

450
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
To be fair, this doesn't necessarily mean the hours I've spent have been more.

451
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
But certainly my character's power is greater.

452
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
So, that's been fun.

453
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Also, I've been playing a little bit of Final Fantasy XIV.

454
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
But not a lot. I'm still kind of on a lull.

455
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I know they had some announcements today.

456
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
We didn't really get them into the show role.

457
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
But they talked a little bit about what they're going to be doing with Patch 3.1.

458
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,000
And there's going to be a mini-game that involves the minions.

459
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
That's pretty cool.

460
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And two new dungeons. So, that'll be nice.

461
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
They're going to be updating Gold Saucer, I think, with some other games.

462
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
So, that's cool.

463
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Let's see.

464
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I also, at a gathering of about eight people, actually got to play some Jackbox Party Pack 2.

465
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I'd already played it a little bit last week.

466
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
But only with just a few people.

467
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So, I think I got to play it more the way it was intended.

468
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
In a room full of people.

469
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And we only really had the time to just play a couple of the games.

470
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
We didn't play everything.

471
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
But we played Quiplash XL, which was hilarious.

472
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
And we had a lot of fun with that.

473
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
And when you have eight people, there's a lot of prompts.

474
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Because each prompt, I guess it's like, I don't know, Family Feud style.

475
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Where it matches up two people at a time.

476
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
So, if you have eight people, and each person is answering two questions.

477
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I mean, it's something like fifteen prompts or something you're going through and voting on.

478
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
But it's really funny.

479
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Especially with the right group of people that are all kind of on that same sense of humor where we're all going to hell.

480
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
So, I had a good time playing that.

481
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
We also played Earwax.

482
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Which was okay.

483
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I'm not sure the formula works totally compared to some of the other Jackbox games.

484
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Just because it's weird that you really have no control over the sound effects that you can have in your pool.

485
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Like, it would be a little more interesting if it was Cards Against Humanity style or something.

486
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Where you had a hand of sound effects.

487
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
And then the ones you didn't use, you could use in the later round or something like that.

488
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I don't know. This thing might be a little more interesting with that.

489
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
But it's weird. You can't really preview the sound effects too.

490
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
But again, when you have so many people and everybody's in that same sense of humor.

491
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
So, every single prompt is responded to as some sort of fart noise.

492
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
There is still some humor to be found in that.

493
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
So, I didn't think the game was bad or anything.

494
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It's not as strong as the other Jackbox games.

495
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Which, earlier last week, myself, Allen, and Shane were all playing Bomb Corp.

496
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
That one is really cool.

497
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
That one, I think, is the reason to check out the pack.

498
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Because it's something very, very different from a lot of the stuff you saw in Jackbox 1.

499
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
And the sense of humor is really great.

500
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
And the retro style graphics.

501
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
It's a really fun game to play together.

502
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Bomb Corp, I think, is my favorite out of those that I've played.

503
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Anyhow, other games I've played this week.

504
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Dragon Quest Heroes on PlayStation 4.

505
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I actually bought that because I was on the fence about getting it.

506
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
I wasn't sure if I wanted it.

507
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Because I thought, ah, but I really want a main Dragon Quest game.

508
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I'd rather play that.

509
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
But then, I was watching some Twitch streams and I was like,

510
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
oh, it's Dynasty Warriors or Hyrule Warriors, if you will, meets Dragon Quest.

511
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I'm like, what the hell. I'll do it.

512
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
So I ended up buying it.

513
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
And I've actually sunk quite a few hours in that game.

514
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
It's fun. I'm having a good time with it.

515
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:05,000
There's something very zen and fulfilling about just the utter button mashing

516
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
where you're just taking out slime after slime and skeleton

517
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
and cute little bat things and all the other creatures in Dragon Quest.

518
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
It's really cool that in this game they've kind of blended

519
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
some of the different Dragon Quest worlds together.

520
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Because there's characters that appear from like four, five, six,

521
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I think seven and eight, all show up.

522
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
So I think that was kind of cool.

523
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
So, yeah, I'm enjoying Dragon Quest Warriors more than I thought I would.

524
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Even though the game doesn't have a lot of depth to it.

525
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I mean, I guess you can set your controls two different ways.

526
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
And I chose to do the easy way, which is like you just hit square over and over,

527
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
mix in some triangle, and you're doing all these crazy-ass combos.

528
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
So, you know, I chose to, I guess, make the game a little more simpler.

529
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
But they do some other JRPG stuff in it.

530
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Like, use the item drops you get at the Alchemist to create this accessory

531
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
that you can use.

532
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And then you can combine accessories to make the super accessory.

533
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And, you know, a lot of those JRPG grindy things you've come to expect.

534
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
They're all there.

535
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
JRPG grindiness is why I love Dragon Quest.

536
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
So I'm having a good time.

537
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Just the character design is great, as it always is in Dragon Quest games.

538
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And the music, of course.

539
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Which is very interesting.

540
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
And I know we talked about this a little bit last week.

541
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
But I found it very interesting that right there on the title screen,

542
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
there's a little, it says, press options for more info on streaming stuff.

543
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Or I don't know what's the streaming information.

544
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
And it actually said, when you press start, it's this whole, like, legal thing

545
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
that's like, you know, you do not have permission to stream

546
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
just for the purposes of listening to the music.

547
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
This is copyright.

548
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Such and such.

549
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Like, they don't want people to just stream the music only.

550
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
And they, it's so weird.

551
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Like, all the weird copyright stuff that's in that game.

552
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I know we dipped into it a little bit last week.

553
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
But to kind of see it firsthand in the game was kind of strange.

554
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
So I have a feeling publishers are going to get more control

555
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
over what you can and can't stream in, like, a future PlayStation 4 update.

556
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I wouldn't be surprised if maybe when streaming's on,

557
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
they could disable the music somehow.

558
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I feel like Square would have wanted to do that on this.

559
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I don't know.

560
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
So, anyhow, yeah, I've been playing a lot of fun games this week.

561
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
That was my gaming week.

562
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,000
So, some housekeeping before we get into some news.

563
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I don't have a lot, really, to announce here.

564
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I don't think we're going to be here Thanksgiving weekend.

565
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I think Dark Saga said she's going to be out of town.

566
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And I don't think we're going to be here Thanksgiving weekend

567
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
because most of you guys probably won't be either.

568
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
But otherwise, we're still here every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific,

569
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

570
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
at the Voice of the Geeks Network.

571
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,000
voggenetwork.com.

572
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Although, Bobby was not on tonight.

573
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,000
He had some other stuff to take care of tonight, so he was not able to be live.

574
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
But he'll be back next week, as will we.

575
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So, let's get into some gaming news.

576
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Loki.

577
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,000
So, Sony has confirmed that they don't have any first-party titles coming for the Vita.

578
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
And I can't say that I'm surprised

579
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
because they haven't had a lot of first-party titles since...

580
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
God, what was the last one they had for that?

581
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Was it that Media Molecule game? I think the paper one.

582
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I don't remember what it's called now.

583
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Tearaway.

584
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Tearaway, yes.

585
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Which they ended up putting on the PlayStation 4.

586
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Yes, exactly.

587
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
So, that was the last one I think that they did for that console.

588
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
They're basically allowing the third parties to basically shine on that.

589
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And that's it.

590
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
They're focusing on the PlayStation 4.

591
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Shine or do the work for our dying console?

592
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Uh...

593
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Yeah.

594
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
And sorry to the Vita fans,

595
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
because no one is going to ruffle some feathers with that comment,

596
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
but at the same time, come on.

597
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
If Sony themselves is like,

598
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
eh, we're not really interested in developing for it,

599
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
what does that tell you?

600
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
It's on its way out.

601
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
They're just not making the money back on it.

602
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
You've seen the writing on the wall for a while with that console.

603
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
They're not making the money back on it.

604
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And that's fine.

605
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I think that third parties should be able to do well on it.

606
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
But this kind of pisses me off more

607
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
that we don't have something like PlayStation Mobile again

608
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
where you could easily publish to it

609
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
and be able to put a lot of those indie titles out there.

610
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Because that'd be awesome to be able to...

611
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
You want a PlayStation Ouya?

612
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I want a PlayStation that just has, you know,

613
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
the same kind of app store like an Android

614
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
or maybe not so much like Android or iOS

615
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
because there's a lot of shit on there.

616
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
But maybe like Steam.

617
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I mean, Steam has a lot of shit on there too,

618
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
but it's a lot less, I think,

619
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
because there's a little bit of a barrier of entry to that.

620
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
But I'd like to see something like that,

621
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
that at least has, there's a way to get your content out there.

622
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
So I think that was a pretty cool idea.

623
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
It's just it wasn't something that was promoted.

624
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
It's like they have these programs where they're like,

625
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
eh, we're just not gonna really do anything with it.

626
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Like they'll announce it and they'll get all excited about it

627
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
and they're like, eh, oh, yeah, we do have that, don't we?

628
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Oh, well, fuck it. It's gone.

629
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I'd be really curious to see that post-mortem expose

630
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
on the PlayStation Vita in like five years

631
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
from all the insiders on what the fuck happened.

632
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
But here's the other weird thing, though.

633
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
You know, we say all this,

634
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
but then every week here on the show,

635
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I'm reading Japanese release dates,

636
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
and there's something on the Vita every week in Japan.

637
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Granted, it's not Sony,

638
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,000
but maybe that whole third parties are gonna carry it thing

639
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
is working overseas in a way it's not working here.

640
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I think it's just the difference in culture

641
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
because you have a lot of people that are taking mass transit,

642
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
you know, to places and they have time to kill

643
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
and it's time to play these games.

644
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
It's more of a portable, you know,

645
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
it seems to be more conducive to like portable gaming.

646
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
But people here seem to just use their phones.

647
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Yeah, they use their phones for that,

648
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
but I just don't think it's like, I don't know,

649
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I don't think that you can get the same experience with it

650
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
without the buttons and everything.

651
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
I don't want to play, I have Minecraft on my phone,

652
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I bought it, I don't want to play it

653
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
because it doesn't support a controller, which is stupid.

654
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
So I don't want to play it that way.

655
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Akuma JP in chat who happens to be in Japan says,

656
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Bingo, Loki.

657
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I'm assuming what you're saying about why it's succeeding in Japan

658
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
where it's not doing so well here in America.

659
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
But it's not like we don't have mass transit.

660
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
They tried like to make this console,

661
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
it was way too expensive when it came out.

662
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
They have like, oh, look, it's gonna have like mobile in it,

663
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
you can get mobile data plans through AT&T,

664
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
which it was like, ooh, 3G.

665
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Oh, by the way, it can't really do anything over that,

666
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
other than just you can do the asynchronous,

667
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
you know, game multiplayer or some shit like that,

668
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
like Ghost Racing.

669
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
It's like, no one wanted to do that.

670
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
They wanted to have it where you can play like actual people

671
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
over the internet and stuff like that.

672
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,000
And maybe now that's something that they can do.

673
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I would love to see them put out another portable console

674
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
that wasn't shit, I don't know.

675
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Well, Bonds006 in chat says,

676
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Dear Sony, the Vita just had to take away almost 30 years

677
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
of Ninty handheld presence.

678
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
That was a huge uphill battle.

679
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Yeah, but I don't think Nintendo is necessarily insurmountable either.

680
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I mean, when we get into some of the NX predictions

681
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
about how Nintendo is really going to make an ecosystem

682
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
out of their dominant handheld in their system,

683
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
that's gonna be very interesting, you know,

684
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
if those rumors pan out or whatever.

685
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
But, I mean, Nintendo is not insurmountable

686
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
because, let us not forget, the 3DS,

687
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
there was a moment where people were questioning

688
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
if the 3DS was gonna make it.

689
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
And Nintendo really pushed out some of those first-party things

690
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
that people were really hoping for.

691
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I think it was like when a Mario Kart game came out.

692
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Yeah, like Mario Kart and Animal Crossing

693
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
and the new Super Mario Brothers.

694
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Yeah, it kind of all came out all at once

695
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
to really pull that console up.

696
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Sony had an opportunity to strike,

697
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,000
and they kind of did with the PSP,

698
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
but I'm not sure they ever really supported the PSP in the same way.

699
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Well, Sony, that's the thing,

700
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
the problem was they put it to like,

701
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
oh, we're gonna have these other companies

702
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
port over our games to that console,

703
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
and that was the problem.

704
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,000
They were like, oh yeah, we're gonna have Call of Duty,

705
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
and we're gonna have Resistance,

706
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
and I was like, fuck yes, mobile Call of Duty?

707
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
That's gonna be amazing.

708
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
And then the Resistance game came out

709
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
by the same developer of the Call of Duty game,

710
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
and it was terrible.

711
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
It was fucking garbage.

712
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
And I was like, uhhhh,

713
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I'm not sure if I want to play this Call of Duty game,

714
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
and then the Call of Duty game comes out,

715
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
oh, it's fucking terrible too.

716
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
It's like, why did you do that?

717
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Why did you entrust your most popular franchises to garbage?

718
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
And I have to do the research,

719
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
but I think it might be the same company

720
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
that put out the last Tony Hawk game too.

721
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Maybe, I don't know.

722
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I don't know about that, but

723
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
yeah, you can't do that.

724
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
You can't just have this first-party title

725
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
that's gonna really carry the console,

726
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
and just shuffle it off to some company

727
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
that might be able to do it.

728
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
DungeonBuster in chat says,

729
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
nice hardware, but kind of hard to break

730
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Nintendo's vice-like grip without the kind of

731
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
third-party title glut that have driven

732
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Nintendo's handhelds.

733
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
So interesting when you compare that to the situation

734
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
that Wii U's been in, though.

735
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
It's so, I mean, like, I don't know,

736
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
it's so crazy to me.

737
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Also, in chat,

738
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Oh, IkumaJP kind of clarifying what was said,

739
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
or no, saying bingo again for Loki, saying,

740
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
the Vita has bells and whistles,

741
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
but most we don't need.

742
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
And I can hear that,

743
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
because, yeah, I have a 3G Vita.

744
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Why? Why do I fucking have a 3G Vita?

745
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I really, I mean, I only bought it

746
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
because it was on sale on Amazon.

747
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
It ended up being just as much as like a Wi-Fi one would

748
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
and it had a game with it or whatever.

749
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
But, like, there really was no fucking reason

750
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
to have a 3G Vita.

751
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
No, there wasn't. It didn't do anything.

752
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I was not going to pay for that data plan.

753
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Why didn't it do online gaming over 3G?

754
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I think that scared AT&T

755
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
and all these, because, you know,

756
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
as everything in voice is going

757
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
unlimited minutes, unlimited minutes,

758
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
we're seeing these mobile companies

759
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
start to gouge the shit out of data,

760
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
which we all know is not that expensive,

761
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
but like fucking Verizon or somebody this week,

762
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
didn't they just come out and say,

763
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
well, we'll let you keep your grandfathered

764
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
but now we're going to charge you, like,

765
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
something like, it's up to like 40 bucks a month now

766
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
for Verizon's unlimited data plan,

767
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
if you want to stay on it.

768
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
So it's like, these wireless companies

769
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
know that data is their bread and butter,

770
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
so I think they were afraid of all that multi-player gaming stuff.

771
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
Well, here's the worst part about those companies.

772
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
They'll have their advertised rates.

773
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Oh, but there's a line access fee

774
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
that's like $20 that you have to pay

775
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
in order to have access

776
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
to all that high-speed data and everything.

777
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
So that, yeah, that was the thing with Verizon.

778
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Like, I was like, hey, well, shit, that's 40 bucks a month,

779
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
you know, or whatever.

780
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
You know, that's like, you know, what I'm paying now,

781
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
plus it's, you know, unlimited minutes,

782
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
so hell, I'm going to do that.

783
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
And they're, oh, yeah, but it's also got,

784
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
there's this access fee that you have to pay.

785
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Like, well, that wasn't advertised here.

786
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Oh, yeah, but there's that small asterisk

787
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
that you didn't see there.

788
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Geez. It's okay.

789
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
It ended up with my employee discount.

790
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
It's like 10 bucks more than I was paying before.

791
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Um, AkumaJP says,

792
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
When he was in the dump at the time, remember the PlayStation 3

793
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
was not selling and people were letting go.

794
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
That's why Allgame win third party.

795
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Tigerklonchat says,

796
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Those that are grandfathered in with unlimited data

797
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
isn't really unlimited. The minute you reach

798
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
a certain cap, they will throttle your connection

799
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
even if it's still unlimited.

800
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Yeah, I know, because I have AT&T

801
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
and it's the same thing where, you know,

802
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
I'll get a nasty text like,

803
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I don't know if I should be admitting this,

804
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
but like six or seven days into the month,

805
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I'll get my text that says you're

806
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
almost at your bandwidth cap

807
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
and you're gonna get throttled.

808
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
And I guess they probably do throttle me,

809
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
but I don't, I actually don't notice it.

810
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
What I've read is that they throttle during peak times.

811
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
But peak times are

812
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
probably when I'm driving to and from work

813
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
and I'm not really using much data outside

814
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
of maybe Waze. You know what I mean?

815
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Uh, yeah, I don't use much, okay,

816
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
well, I do use a lot of data now just because

817
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
of stupid Ingress, but, um, aside

818
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
from that, I'm not, because

819
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Ingress is the most expensive free game I've ever played.

820
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Why? What the fuck is it doing

821
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
that's using so much data? Pinging

822
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
where I'm at? I mean, uh, the portal

823
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
pictures, the maps. The pictures

824
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
are so fucking tiny. There's no way

825
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
that that's like a big data

826
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
thing that's like sucking, what,

827
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
like a one megabyte picture?

828
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Whoo! I mean, there's no way

829
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
that that shit is fucking taking up all

830
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
that bandwidth. Cache that

831
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
shit. I mean, come on.

832
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Whatever, but yeah, I use

833
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
about a hundred, it's about a hundred megs, I think,

834
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
an hour, maybe, that you

835
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
play that for no

836
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
reason. Yep, I know, I know.

837
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Anyway, uh,

838
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
so we got on a bit of a tangent there,

839
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
but, uh, no, I really hope

840
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
the system does well. I mean, I think it's

841
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
pretty nice. It's a little,

842
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
ergonomically, it could use a little bit

843
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
of help, but it was nice that they had the dual

844
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
analog sticks and everything. The back touch

845
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
thing was absolutely fucking not

846
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
necessary at all. Um,

847
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
it could have used maybe a second set of, um,

848
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
rear trigger, or, you know, rear

849
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
shoulder buttons. That would have been nice.

850
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Um, that's

851
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
about it. The front facing camera,

852
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
totally not fucking necessary. Actually,

853
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
a camera at all on those fucking devices,

854
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
not fucking necessary. Even the 3DS.

855
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Yeah. The 3D picture thing is kinda

856
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
cool. Um, it was cool for

857
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
a minute. For a minute, yeah, and then, like,

858
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I don't know, it was just kinda lame. What games

859
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
use it?

860
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
That people actually play? Don't give me that

861
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
AR games and all that. The people don't use it.

862
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
No, the AR cards too.

863
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Both systems. The AR cards. That was

864
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
fucking stupid. No one needs that.

865
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Alright. Well, moving

866
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
on. Maybe things should just go back to the

867
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
way they used to be. At least that's where Square

868
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Enix might be headed. Uh, interesting

869
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
because they released their annual

870
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
report, which, you know, we're getting to the end of the

871
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
financial year for various companies.

872
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
So Square Enix put out their annual

873
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
report about, you know, where the money's made and all

874
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
that. And an interesting passage

875
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
from their annual report, and this is

876
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
a quote from that, says,

877
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Well, at the same time, have new customers enjoyed the

878
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
IP as though it were brand new? By not

879
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
only optimizing single pieces of IP

880
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
for single platforms, but also rolling

881
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
out IP in a multidimensional manner to meet the

882
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
needs of the modern market, we believe we can

883
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
deliver exciting new experiences.

884
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
So, interesting because

885
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
they basically say, they're gonna go back

886
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
and reinvent stuff they did on old consoles

887
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
for new technology. So, like

888
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Chrono Trigger on the Oculus Rift.

889
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Who's ready for it? Yeah.

890
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
Obviously, I'm jumping into conclusion here.

891
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Come on, that's a franchise you haven't touched in a while.

892
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I could think that would do well.

893
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Hell yes. Oh my god, that's a great one.

894
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Good answer.

895
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Dark Sakura, is there a classic Square Enix

896
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
franchise you'd like to see them reinvent

897
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
for the newer technology that's out there?

898
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
No. No. Actually,

899
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
yes, I do have one. And I would...

900
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Day one. Day one.

901
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Ur-guys. Ur-guys would be good.

902
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
No, no, not ur-guys.

903
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Super Mario fucking RPG.

904
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Super Mario RPG.

905
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Might be difficult. Why would it be difficult?

906
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Because of the whole Nintendo.

907
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Unless... Come on, Nintendo.

908
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Come on. You know.

909
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Let's get your tinfoil

910
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
hats, everybody. Get the aluminum foil out of your

911
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
kitchen drawer. You ready, everybody? Get them

912
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
out. Get them out. Make your hat. Put it on.

913
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Here we go. Here we go. Here goes

914
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Rob justifying how Super Mario

915
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
RPG could be in the remakes right now.

916
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Here's how it is. Do you remember

917
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
a couple months ago, there was a rumor floating

918
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
around that Nintendo

919
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
for the NX was

920
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
majorly in bed with a third-party

921
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
publisher. And some people were speculating

922
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
that publisher was Square Enix.

923
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
What if...

924
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
What if...

925
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Nintendo's letting them do a new Super Mario

926
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
RPG as a launch title for NX?

927
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
That'd be cool, but I don't think that's gonna happen.

928
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
As

929
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
quick as you were to fanboy about that, you should just miss that.

930
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I think they would do like a Dragon

931
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Quest game or something like that.

932
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Because they could kind of publish

933
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
first-party stuff. 12's already been announced for 3DS

934
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
and PlayStation 4, so unless...

935
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
It would be cool. I would be down with that.

936
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
But I don't think that would be something that

937
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
most... It's not gonna get

938
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
the casual audience to come over to the NX.

939
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
It would get the hardcore

940
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
fans of RPGs and stuff to come over.

941
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Unless they make it

942
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
approachable enough for them.

943
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
As fun as tinfoil hat

944
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
moments are, I think in reality, that

945
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
moved on to the Mario and Luigi series

946
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
that you see on handhelds. I know it's not

947
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
the same, but that's kind of

948
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
you know, where things are at.

949
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Come on, you can do it all epic and shit like

950
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
fucking Kingdom Hearts and stuff.

951
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
ActDeft in chat says

952
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I'm surprised it hasn't appeared in the Wii U virtual

953
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
console. You know,

954
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
me too, although I'm sure it's rights.

955
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Again, agreements, sign-offs,

956
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
things like that. Licenses

957
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
that expired and so on. That's why it doesn't

958
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
show up on virtual console.

959
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
But anything is possible. Dare to dream, you guys.

960
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Dare to dream.

961
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Let's see,

962
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
what else do I want to say on that whole thing about

963
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
the remakes and so forth.

964
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
So Dark Soccer, you're against it, right?

965
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I just don't care.

966
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
You don't care, or you don't want them to do it?

967
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
If they want to do it, they can do it. It doesn't mean we have to buy it.

968
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Well, they're

969
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
going to want to make things that hopefully you buy, though,

970
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Dark Soccer. They don't want to just make something to make

971
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
it, because making games costs a lot of money.

972
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
If I don't want it, somebody else out there

973
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
might want it, so it doesn't really matter what I think.

974
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Can someone like, I know

975
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
this isn't Square Enix, but can someone like maybe

976
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
get a hold of Namco Bandai and say, hey, you know

977
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
what, can you guys just stop sucking for

978
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
a second and actually just make a good

979
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
new Ridge Racer game? I mean, it's kind

980
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
of sad that we don't have a Ridge Racer

981
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
game launching a new

982
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
console platform. It's been a long time

983
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
since like, what, the

984
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
PlayStation, well, the PlayStation

985
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Vita had a Ridge Racer title.

986
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
That's where it kind of went downhill. It was like,

987
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
fucking, oh hey, yeah, it's like

988
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
30 bucks for this demo, and then you

989
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
got to buy all the tracks and all the cars.

990
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
Now, fuck that shit. I'm talking about just

991
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
like, a good Ridge Racer game to

992
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
launch a platform.

993
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Maybe they should upscale R4.

994
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I'd be down to that.

995
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Well, the chat room's here to correct me when I

996
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
misspeak, and act-deft in chat says

997
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
it is on the Wii Virtual Console.

998
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Mario RPG, I guess, is on the Wii, which you could launch

999
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
into backwards compatibility

1000
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
mode on the Wii U,

1001
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
which I...

1002
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
That's a whole other thing. No wonder I forgot.

1003
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
How convoluted is that? That I have to

1004
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
launch into the Wii backwards compatibility

1005
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
to see the stuff that's on the Wii.

1006
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
It's so crazy that the Wii could run that, but

1007
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
the Wii U, I can't

1008
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
emulate that Super Nintendo game.

1009
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Hold on, let me pull out my old ass

1010
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
cell phone that can emulate that

1011
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
game. Just perfectly fine.

1012
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Well,

1013
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
back to what I was saying,

1014
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
is that I think that

1015
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
there are going to be people out there who want

1016
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
to get it. For me, I'm not their

1017
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
target audience when it comes to this.

1018
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
So, if they put out something

1019
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
and I want it badly enough, then yeah, I'll get it,

1020
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
but chances are, I already

1021
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
have it. This is going to be for the

1022
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
people who didn't hold on to their

1023
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
original consoles, or

1024
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
don't have some of these old games who are,

1025
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
you know, super nostalgic for them.

1026
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Um...

1027
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I don't think I'm their target

1028
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
audience for this, so...

1029
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Sometimes, I like the idea

1030
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
of a remake, though. I'm

1031
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
okay with a remake outside

1032
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
of the original, you know what I mean? Like, it doesn't

1033
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
always have to play just like the

1034
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
pure original. Like, I'm okay with a remake once

1035
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
in a while. Now, if they updated and re-released

1036
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Do Prism, or Threads of Fate,

1037
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
or The Guardian Legend. I'm talking about

1038
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Squeenix.

1039
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
They couldn't

1040
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
redo The Guardian Legend and have it be the same

1041
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
thing. Square Enix could

1042
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I don't know, give somebody

1043
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
a handy and get the rights to it somehow, come on.

1044
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
I want a sequel that plays the

1045
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
same, but the first game was perfect as it is.

1046
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
It's fair. Alright, well, by the way,

1047
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
trying something new now that Twitter has polling

1048
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
built into it, and I know we can do polls

1049
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
at VOG Network, too, with the live

1050
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
audience, but I thought, oh, I see this feature on

1051
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Twitter, let's try this. Ask a question

1052
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
in advance, we can gather some responses.

1053
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
So, we asked our listeners over at Twitter.com

1054
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
slash OLR before tonight's show,

1055
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Square Enix saying they plan

1056
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
to remake more old IPs.

1057
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Is this good news or bad news?

1058
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
82% says good news.

1059
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
This is good news. Only 18%

1060
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
saying it was bad news. Thanks to

1061
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
you guys for responding over there. That's

1062
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
a pretty big majority there saying

1063
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
that's good news.

1064
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I'm fine with it.

1065
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I understand why people

1066
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
say bad to that. I totally

1067
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
get it, because it takes the resources away from

1068
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
inventing on new stuff, but again,

1069
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I think once in a while the reimaginings can be

1070
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
pretty good. I don't

1071
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
want them to be on mobile phones.

1072
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
A lot of the bad sentiment comes from that.

1073
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
There are new things though that Square Enix

1074
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
came up with that have been really good.

1075
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Seriously. Well, don't forget

1076
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
that Square Enix

1077
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
has the IDOS stuff and the stuff that they

1078
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
make here in the States.

1079
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
The recent Tomb Raider reboot, for example,

1080
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
one could argue that's

1081
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
a reimagining of a classic IP

1082
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
that worked out very well.

1083
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Rise of the Tomb Raider is something we're all

1084
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
looking forward to, right?

1085
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Generally, the public is.

1086
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
I think that might be an example of

1087
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
where this could be exactly the type of thing they're

1088
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
talking about, right? Taking an old

1089
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
thing and making it

1090
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
relevant for the newer consoles.

1091
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I don't know.

1092
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Just a thought on that.

1093
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
To register participation

1094
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
for this week's episode of Orange Under Radio at

1095
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
bognetwork.com, use the passphrase

1096
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
coffee.

1097
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Dungeon Buster says, also, Square Enix

1098
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
needs money to make new things too.

1099
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Deus Ex and Tomb Raider

1100
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
can't do it alone.

1101
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
All right. Well, let's move on

1102
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
to some more news here, and

1103
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
we'll get more of your thoughts here later in the show.

1104
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
For now, Dark Soccer.

1105
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
We have some shady business going down at Harmonix.

1106
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Ooh.

1107
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
What happened is

1108
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
that some of the Rock Band 4 developers

1109
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
went onto Amazon

1110
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
and gave their game five-star reviews

1111
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
without identifying themselves as having

1112
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
worked on the game.

1113
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Three

1114
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
in question were Matthew

1115
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Nordhaus,

1116
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Jane Tan, and

1117
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Chris Foster.

1118
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Basically gave themselves five-star reviews

1119
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
and just, you know,

1120
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
pretty much said, oh, the game's great.

1121
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
We're doing this with our family. Well,

1122
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Harmonix has come back out after they got,

1123
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
you know, outed on Reddit.

1124
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
They said,

1125
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
and this is the official statement, that they

1126
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
have clarified their internal policy

1127
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
about posting reviews on our

1128
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
own products on retail sites.

1129
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
And we've asked that existing reviews be

1130
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
edited to identify Harmonix employees

1131
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
or be removed entirely.

1132
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Um,

1133
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
so they're like, ugh, they caught us.

1134
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
So, here's a

1135
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
smack done on it. And one of

1136
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
the people who did it, he went

1137
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
on and said, I added the

1138
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
review half in jest, as you might be able to tell

1139
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
from the tone of the original. In hindsight,

1140
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
it's probably important that I know that I worked on the game

1141
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
and worked for Harmonix.

1142
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Um, so

1143
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
they've gone back and said, oops, we

1144
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
are bad. But still,

1145
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
they should have known better. Yeah, I

1146
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
think that's a dangerous thing to

1147
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
mess with. I worry because these people

1148
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
have been, like, individually identified,

1149
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
which kind of sucks for them because I just,

1150
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I just think of all the crimes

1151
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
in the world you can commit,

1152
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
this is not, I mean, I don't know. And

1153
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
people would be like, Rob, ethics,

1154
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
dah, dah, dah, dah. And I'm like, okay, yeah, but we're

1155
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
talking about Amazon reviews,

1156
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
people. But it's about ethics in

1157
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
video games. Don't. But

1158
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
the thing is, we're not

1159
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
talking about some type of, like, payola

1160
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
thing where,

1161
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
you know, a reputable

1162
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
website published this huge review

1163
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
or whatever. Like, shouldn't you fucking

1164
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
take Amazon reviews with a big

1165
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
grain of salt anyway?

1166
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Like, that's my whole thing, is I'm almost like,

1167
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I wouldn't, I don't know, I wouldn't take them that

1168
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
seriously. So,

1169
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I don't know. But I

1170
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
also, at the same time, I see, like,

1171
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
you get in this really dangerous place, you put

1172
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
your company in an odd place when you do something

1173
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
like this, and I worry for

1174
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
those guys, because I think they just did, like,

1175
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
a silly thing, and I would hate, like,

1176
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
now that this is all just being dragged

1177
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
out there, because there's no other gaming news going

1178
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
on, that something, you know, is going to

1179
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
happen to these guys. And I just really hope not, because I just

1180
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
think of all the crimes in the world, is

1181
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
leaving an Amazon review really the

1182
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
biggest breach of ethics you can think of? I

1183
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
don't know. Maybe I'm just, maybe I'm just

1184
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
naive, but I don't pay attention to any of that stuff

1185
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
anyway. It's like Yelp reviews.

1186
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I, I take

1187
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Yelp reviews with a huge grain of salt,

1188
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
because either people

1189
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
had a bad experience,

1190
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
and they raised the place

1191
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
all the time on Yelp, or

1192
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
they had a good experience, or

1193
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
know the owner, or

1194
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
a friend or family or whatever, and

1195
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
leave a five-star review. There's, like, nothing in the

1196
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
middle. I, you know,

1197
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
I don't know, you can't trust that stuff. You just

1198
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
can't. It's all extremes on one end

1199
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
or the other. I don't know. But

1200
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
also, to be fair to harmonics,

1201
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I mean,

1202
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
is this really the first or the last

1203
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
time this stuff has happened? I don't

1204
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
think it is. I know it's not the

1205
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
first time, and it definitely won't be the last time.

1206
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Because I know we had stuff,

1207
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
wasn't it actually with a Telltale

1208
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
game that came out? Like, there was some positive

1209
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
reviews on Metacritic or something in the user reviews,

1210
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I want to say.

1211
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
It was one of the ones that was kind of, was it

1212
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Jurassic Park? Or one of the ones that wasn't

1213
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
as well received to see others got

1214
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
some review. I don't remember. Don't quote me

1215
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
on that. But it was something out

1216
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
there I seem to remember.

1217
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Going to our chat room over at

1218
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
live.vog.network.com

1219
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Tigerhonchat says,

1220
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
it's especially bad if the game a developer worked

1221
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
on was bad from the beginning,

1222
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
and they try to put a positive review on it.

1223
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Let's see.

1224
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Bonds006 says, I was waiting for

1225
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
anti-Yelpers.

1226
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Let's see.

1227
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Cial says,

1228
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
oh sorry, that was a comment on the

1229
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
last story.

1230
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Bonds006 also says, so is that

1231
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
a ban hammer or not for in-house

1232
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
workers? Well, you know Amazon's

1233
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
trying to take, because they want

1234
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
their reviews to be taken seriously, Amazon's

1235
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
trying to take steps

1236
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
kind of against that whole thing. Didn't they come out this

1237
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
week and say they were going to sue people that

1238
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
were leaving, like, they were

1239
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
being paid to leave five star

1240
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
reviews on products? I mean,

1241
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
another reason why you can't trust these reviews

1242
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
in the first place. I don't know.

1243
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
I mean, it's not a review, but I know that

1244
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
EA, I think, had told its

1245
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
employees to vote against,

1246
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
it was either EA or

1247
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Comcast that tried to vote against, you know,

1248
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
them as the worst company in America.

1249
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1250
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Oh, gosh.

1251
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Uh, yeah.

1252
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
You know, I mean, and getting your employees

1253
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
to vote and your friends and stuff to vote, like,

1254
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I think here locally, I'm sure every

1255
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
town does this. Don't you have some type

1256
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
of newspaper or TV station

1257
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
that does a best of the town

1258
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
type of competition?

1259
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Because I know it happens here in Sacramento. There's some type of, like,

1260
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
best of Sacramento. I don't remember who does

1261
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
it. It's one of the local TV stations,

1262
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I think. And, like, I've actually

1263
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
gotten a little thing with my

1264
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
receipt that says, vote for us

1265
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
in this competition, dah, dah, dah, dah, and go to this

1266
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
website and vote for us so we can win

1267
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
and all this stuff. So, I mean,

1268
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
it's not that different

1269
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
from the podcast awards, all things

1270
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
considered.

1271
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Anyway.

1272
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Uh, Brad from Pod

1273
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Culture, and I think this is probably the right way to do it,

1274
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
says, I always throw out the top

1275
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
and the lowest scores, and I

1276
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
read the middle stuff. It's probably

1277
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
the way to do it. Or, you

1278
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
can really only trust your friends. I think that's

1279
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
another thing for me.

1280
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
We'll get into this topic again a little more

1281
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
later on in our FUGL Question of the Week,

1282
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
but for now, let's move on with some more

1283
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
stories. Loki. Alright.

1284
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
So, Microsoft is gonna focus now

1285
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
on, primarily,

1286
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Xbox Live usership.

1287
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
And I think the reason for this is because not only

1288
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
do they not

1289
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
gonna be kinda struggling a little bit

1290
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
with console sales, but, hey,

1291
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Xbox Live, that could be on, you know,

1292
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Windows and

1293
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
on, you know,

1294
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
the Xbox consoles,

1295
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
maybe even Windows Phone. So, of course,

1296
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
they wanna, you know, strive to have more Xbox

1297
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Live users, you know,

1298
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
maybe more spending that way,

1299
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
and they don't necessarily need to sell

1300
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
the brand new consoles, because, hey, you have got a lot

1301
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
of people who have Xbox 360s still.

1302
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
You know, I'm actually

1303
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
finding myself in kind of that predicament where

1304
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
it's like, you know, my Xbox Live

1305
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
membership is running up,

1306
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I think, early next year, and I

1307
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
really haven't played anything on Live

1308
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
that justifies me continuing that, since

1309
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I don't have an Xbox One, so,

1310
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I'm probably not.

1311
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
But, yeah,

1312
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
apparently, they're saying that

1313
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
they're not using console

1314
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
shipments as their primary metric

1315
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
for success, but they've,

1316
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
they're focusing more on

1317
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
engagement, leading to choose

1318
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Xbox Live usership as its

1319
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
statistic for that,

1320
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
and basically indicating that

1321
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
they have 39 million Xbox Live

1322
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
users right now.

1323
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
And they're trying to get it up.

1324
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Usership, I guess, up is

1325
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
up 28%.

1326
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Well, I suppose this is a nice

1327
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
way to put a spin on a situation

1328
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
that otherwise might not

1329
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
be all good news for Microsoft.

1330
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I mean, maybe they're kind of,

1331
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
this sounds to me like,

1332
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
and you might disagree, but it just kind of sounds

1333
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
to me like they're just kind of,

1334
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I don't want to say throwing in the towel, but they're kind

1335
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
of admitting that if they keep

1336
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
comparing themselves to Sony PlayStation

1337
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
numbers, that number is looking

1338
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
more and more insurmountable. Or maybe, like,

1339
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
maybe it's just like PR spin

1340
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
for investors type thing, like, oh, well

1341
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
we're not really, it's cool,

1342
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
we're not really competing against you,

1343
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Nintendo, we're not really competing

1344
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
against you, we're on our own

1345
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
thing, we're just going to look at, you know,

1346
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Xbox Live usership,

1347
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
which is way higher, because we've got way more people

1348
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
than PlayStation Plus, that's what they're probably

1349
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
looking at. Well, and to

1350
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
be fair, on the flip side, I mean,

1351
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
yeah, they still make

1352
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
quite a bit of money from Xbox

1353
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Live, I mean, it's what, 50, 60 bucks a year?

1354
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Well, yeah, and think about, you know,

1355
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
manufacturing consoles. Over five years, that's as much

1356
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
as a console. How much are you making per console? I mean, you're

1357
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
probably losing money on each console, so

1358
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I mean, yeah, might as well

1359
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
have as much usership as you can.

1360
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
And the other thing, you know, is, I've

1361
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
been reading that they've been pretty

1362
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
shy on talking numbers

1363
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
of units sold, it's

1364
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
more difficult each time

1365
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
when those NPD numbers come out to see

1366
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
what are you guys selling? Interesting.

1367
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Especially now that the new rules

1368
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
were that I don't think they have to even

1369
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
divulge that stuff. Yeah.

1370
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
An anonymous

1371
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
chat in our chat, 648

1372
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
says, I'm sticking with the PlayStation 4

1373
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
and the PC at this point.

1374
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Maybe that's what

1375
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Microsoft needs to do more of, is

1376
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
how to differentiate themselves more

1377
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
from the PlayStation 4, and I guess, I mean,

1378
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
to be fair, I do feel like that's been

1379
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
a big tone of theirs this year, is really

1380
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
pushing those exclusive

1381
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
games that are only going to

1382
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
be on Xbox One this holiday, like

1383
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
you know, the

1384
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Rare Replay and

1385
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Tomb Raider and

1386
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Halo 5, I keep wanting to say Crackdown

1387
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
but that got pushed back, so not

1388
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Crackdown, but you know,

1389
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Gears of War, that whole thing.

1390
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
So, you know, that's what

1391
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Microsoft's kind of trying to do, is how to differentiate

1392
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
themselves. To be fair, their lineup for first party

1393
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
titles is way better than Sony's right now.

1394
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I mean, that's just, this holiday

1395
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
they've knocked it out of the park. Sony,

1396
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
nope, they have

1397
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
not. I mean, they have Uncharted, which

1398
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
that's not even coming out this year. The Uncharted

1399
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Collection, sorry, a collection of old

1400
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
games does not make a blockbuster

1401
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
you know,

1402
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
first party lineup for the holiday. Oh,

1403
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
but you've got those exclusives

1404
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
with Destiny and

1405
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
fucking Call of Duty. I'm sorry, that doesn't

1406
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
sell consoles either.

1407
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Bonds006

1408
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
in chat says, so these companies who in the past

1409
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
shouted from the hills about

1410
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
MPD stats are now trying to hide

1411
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
underperforming products in a number

1412
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
maze.

1413
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Let's see, some comments on the Wii U actually

1414
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
in chat, Dungeon Buster saying

1415
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I haven't really felt compelled to get an Xbox

1416
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
One yet, but I'm actually leaning

1417
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
more towards a Wii U.

1418
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Well, I don't, you know, again, I

1419
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
think, especially now that we're years

1420
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
into the Wii U's cycle,

1421
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
there's so many games now that

1422
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
you're missing out on. I honestly, if you're thinking

1423
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
about a Wii U, I might still hold off

1424
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
on that, just because, you know,

1425
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
you're going to invest into a Wii U right now, then all

1426
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
of a sudden, oh hey, NX, fuck the Wii

1427
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
U, we're done with that, you know, because I can see

1428
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
that totally happening, and just

1429
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
maybe give it a few more months until we

1430
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
start hearing the E3 news and kind of see what

1431
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
their plan is with that. Wait for a price drop

1432
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
or E3. Because, yeah, because

1433
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I'm worried that if you jump in right now,

1434
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
eh, I mean, Zelda's

1435
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
going to be cool, and god, I hope it's still coming out in

1436
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
the Wii U, but like, eh,

1437
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I don't know. They may

1438
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
try to pull that, you know, shit where

1439
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
they did that with, was it the

1440
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
GameCube and the Wii, you know, oh hey,

1441
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Zelda, it's on the Wii now.

1442
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Yeah, a lot of people think that could be

1443
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
where it's headed, we'll see.

1444
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Well, anyhow, Xbox Live, you know,

1445
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
for better or for worse, is a place where,

1446
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
you know, you can get called nasty things

1447
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
by all sorts of strangers, and

1448
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
soon, this could be coming to PC. Okay,

1449
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
it's not really the same thing, it's

1450
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
actually a little bit different, but here's the deal.

1451
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Blizzard has actually

1452
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
been shown that

1453
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
they are going to be testing some

1454
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
voice chat systems in

1455
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
their Battle.net client.

1456
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
So, right now, voice chat

1457
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
is going to be in beta when Overwatch

1458
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
goes into beta testing, which I

1459
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
believe is in days, I think that

1460
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
is on Tuesday, when the Overwatch

1461
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
beta starts, although

1462
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
really only the people in the super special

1463
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
secret Blizzard club are going to be in that at first,

1464
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
and then they'll start rolling that out to more and more

1465
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
people, I'm sure, as time goes on.

1466
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
So, Overwatch is going to

1467
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
get those betas, that'll start

1468
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
being streamed on Twitch, for sure.

1469
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
That'll be the big, the people that always

1470
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
pimp Blizzard products on Twitch

1471
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
will get those beta keys, so that

1472
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
they start streaming it, and it's all going to be

1473
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
positive, because they're already really into Blizzard stuff.

1474
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
So, that'll, you'll see that on Tuesday,

1475
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
probably.

1476
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
But, anyhow, as part

1477
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
of the Overwatch beta FAQ,

1478
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Blizzard is calling this new system Battle.net

1479
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
voice chat. So, it's

1480
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
not Overwatch voice chat, it's

1481
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Battle.net voice chat.

1482
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
And they say, with voice chat still in its early

1483
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
development and testing stages, it's too

1484
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
early to say which Blizzard games will be

1485
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
supported and when. So, that could

1486
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
be very interesting, because, you know, not only will

1487
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
you possibly be able to talk to each

1488
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
other in Overwatch, but you'll

1489
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
be able to, maybe, I would say

1490
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
if it's a Battle.net voice chat

1491
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
thing, maybe you'll be able to talk to somebody

1492
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
in World of Warcraft, while

1493
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
you're playing Diablo, or something like that.

1494
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
You could actually talk across those channels.

1495
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Now, something to note,

1496
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
is that

1497
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
World of Warcraft did have

1498
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
voice chat in it, I think still does.

1499
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Nobody used it

1500
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
right after it first came out.

1501
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
And everybody went back to using TeamSpeak

1502
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
and Ventrilo, or Skype

1503
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
even, than using the built-in.

1504
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Why? Because the options on the

1505
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
built-in voice chat were extremely limiting

1506
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
to the point it was useless.

1507
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Because you couldn't control volume

1508
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
very well at all. I remember it was very

1509
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
hard to hear. The quality

1510
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
was really bad. I don't know if

1511
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
it was trying to share processing with the

1512
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
game itself, or what, but

1513
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
it just had so many problems.

1514
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
So, I hope if they're building this voice

1515
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
chat into Battle.net, maybe it's

1516
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
running on a separate process,

1517
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
or a separate application.

1518
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
If I'm playing Diablo with

1519
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
say, Shane or somebody

1520
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
over Skype, and

1521
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
we're both on Skype, and playing Diablo,

1522
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
it's fine. It's a great experience.

1523
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
All Blizzard needs to do

1524
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
is to build that Skype-like thing

1525
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
into the Battle.net client, and they'll

1526
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
be fine.

1527
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
But that could be interesting. That could also

1528
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
be very doom-impending

1529
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
for TeamSpeak and

1530
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Ventrilo type of stuff, if

1531
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
it takes off very well and is of

1532
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
good quality.

1533
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
We'll see.

1534
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Let's see, going to our chatroom over at

1535
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
live.vognetwork.com

1536
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
bonds006 says, and there goes

1537
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
the already fucked up PC chatrooms, adding

1538
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
voice. I know where that will go.

1539
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
I'm hoping that

1540
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
it's something where you have a lot of control

1541
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
over it, where it's limited to just

1542
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
your friends. Because I would

1543
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
not want to play an Overwatch

1544
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
match at all, and get

1545
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
voice chat. And I have a feeling

1546
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Blizzard doesn't want to go there with it either, because they know

1547
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
what's going to happen if they just enable voice chat.

1548
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Because people can be really mean in Heroes

1549
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
of the Storm, for god's sake.

1550
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
God, people are so rude in those

1551
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
types of games sometimes.

1552
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I can't imagine they're just going to open up

1553
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
voice chat for everybody. But,

1554
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
if I'm in a party, like let's say

1555
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Grandpa, myself,

1556
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
and Nextifer or something all want to play

1557
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Heroes of the Storm together, we should be able to

1558
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
hit a button and open up

1559
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
a voice chat channel very easy.

1560
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Be nice.

1561
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Anyway.

1562
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Cial from our chatroom says, third-party chat will

1563
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
never die. I suppose I could

1564
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
see where there's still always kind of a use for a

1565
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
third-party chat. When I'm

1566
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
playing Wii U,

1567
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
if I'm playing Splatoon on Wii U,

1568
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
I still have to use Skype.

1569
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
There's no voice chat there, so

1570
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
I guess that's true. But no, I don't think

1571
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
third-party voice chat will ever die.

1572
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
But it'll take a big hit, I think, if some of

1573
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
these games go to it. I don't know. That's what I think.

1574
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Anyhow, let's move on. Dark Soccer.

1575
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Well,

1576
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
this is probably the big reason

1577
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
why we've seen a lot of crackdown on

1578
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
ads for YouTube. You know,

1579
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
why they've really been trying to get rid of the

1580
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
ad blockers and whatnot. Google

1581
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
announced that YouTube

1582
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Red is coming out, which is an

1583
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
ad-free subscription service

1584
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
for YouTube.

1585
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
It will start on the 28th

1586
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
of October for $9.99

1587
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
a month, and will

1588
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
let you watch YouTube without ads.

1589
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Meanwhile, some of us

1590
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
who remain unnamed are

1591
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
using the specific

1592
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
ad block for YouTube, and

1593
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
not getting ads either.

1594
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
But they're supposed to be doing a 30-day

1595
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
trial right

1596
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
after it launches, so you can see

1597
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
if you like it.

1598
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Okay, I mean, you can also play videos

1599
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
in the background while using

1600
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
apps on

1601
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
your smartphone when you're running

1602
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
it through the smartphone app.

1603
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I think that was a really stupid

1604
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
name to pick, because

1605
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
surely you all know about

1606
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
RedTube.

1607
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
You're pure and innocent. Have you heard about

1608
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
RedTube?

1609
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
No, but there's more

1610
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
cinnamon buns.

1611
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
There are definitely some buns on RedTube,

1612
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
let me tell you. I don't need to know

1613
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
about that, la la la la la. Among other

1614
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
body parts. So I just

1615
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
think that was a really clueless

1616
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
name to pick. But also kind of puts their branding

1617
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
in competition with Brand Red.

1618
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Oh, I didn't even think about that.

1619
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Interesting.

1620
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Well, I've also found

1621
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
it very interesting. I don't know if you guys, either

1622
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
of you, have heard about this. The way they're kind of like

1623
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
strong-arming some of their biggest

1624
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
content creators to basically accept the

1625
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
deal, or if we're

1626
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
going to lock all your videos private

1627
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
and all this shit.

1628
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I don't know how I feel about

1629
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
that. I feel

1630
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
like because YouTube doesn't have a lot

1631
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
of competition in that space, they can

1632
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
kind of get away with that shit.

1633
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Because where else are those content creators

1634
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
going to go? Where else are they going to

1635
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
go to put up videos like that

1636
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
on a mass scale to be discovered

1637
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
and make the kind of money they do on YouTube now?

1638
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
And I feel like Google

1639
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
or YouTube kind of knows that

1640
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
and is why they can strong-arm them into

1641
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
this deal, but there's a part of me that feels

1642
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
like, is that

1643
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
totally legal, what they're doing?

1644
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Aren't they kind of begging to be

1645
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
sued?

1646
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
But they probably

1647
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
can't be because I'm sure

1648
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
part of the agreement you make when you

1649
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
agree to cash the check from YouTube is

1650
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
you're not going to sue us over contract

1651
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
change. The other fun thing too is that they're blocking

1652
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
specific games

1653
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
from YouTube as well. So for example,

1654
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
because these

1655
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
companies, I guess, haven't

1656
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
taken the agreement yet

1657
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
in some Japanese companies, games

1658
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
like Attack on Titan, Hatsune

1659
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Miku, Project Mirai 2,

1660
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
BlazBlue Chrono Phantasma,

1661
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
they are not able to be seen

1662
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
in the US. Any videos that get

1663
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
content ID matched for those,

1664
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
they are blocked in the US because

1665
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
the companies that make those games

1666
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
have not taken the deal for YouTube

1667
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Red.

1668
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
I just,

1669
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
how can this be legal?

1670
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I just still do what the fuck

1671
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
they want. But, you know,

1672
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
and now what's interesting is that, you know, Twitch

1673
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
is making more of a play for the on-demand

1674
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
gaming type of stuff.

1675
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
So, I mean, some of these games I'm sure you could

1676
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
find on Twitch, no problem.

1677
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I just think it's, like, pretty ballsy of

1678
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
them to say, hey, we're going to offer

1679
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
ad-free, um,

1680
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
ad-free

1681
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
usage for 999 a month and people are like,

1682
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I just, I've been using

1683
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
an ad block. I don't, maybe

1684
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
it's just me. I, I,

1685
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
would you guys pay for content

1686
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
that you look at on YouTube?

1687
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Because there's a lot of, and I say, I've

1688
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
created YouTubes

1689
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
and I wouldn't want people to have to pay to watch

1690
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
what I've done. Nope. And, and, and, if they're

1691
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
going to try to do this shit where it's like, hey, this

1692
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
PewDiePie's got a fucking exclusive

1693
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
new video series that's behind

1694
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
this paywall of YouTube Red,

1695
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
I guess I'm just never going to see it

1696
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
because that's what's going to end up happening.

1697
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Or is someone just going to fucking

1698
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
dump that shit and fucking re-upload it on

1699
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
their channel or, I'm just sorry,

1700
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
it's just, you,

1701
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
you've been giving this out

1702
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
for free for so long,

1703
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
it's going to get pretty hard to give,

1704
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
make people pay for it now.

1705
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Imagine if Facebook started charging

1706
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
999 a month for, you know,

1707
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
something. Don't start another copy

1708
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
paste post on everybody's wall. I'm just saying,

1709
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
you know, I'm not paying for this.

1710
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Period. I'm not going to pay for it.

1711
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
If I don't want to watch ads,

1712
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
then I will just use ad block. I would

1713
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
pay for it if there was something worth paying

1714
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
for. I pay for Netflix

1715
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
because they've got some fucking

1716
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
great original series that you can

1717
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
watch very conveniently and easily.

1718
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Orange is the New Black, I mean, the new

1719
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
season aside, the first two seasons were really good.

1720
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
I, Sense8 was

1721
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
fucking amazing.

1722
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Gracie and Frankie or whatever that

1723
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
show is called with the broads from 9 to 5.

1724
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
I like that show a lot.

1725
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
And, you know, there's a lot of really

1726
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
good Netflix original stuff, so I

1727
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
don't mind paying for that stuff. But now this pool

1728
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
is getting really diluted because everybody wants

1729
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
money for their content,

1730
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
but it's like, you know, you've got to have

1731
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
really good exclusive content for me.

1732
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Yeah, exactly. And that's the thing, too, is like...

1733
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
I would not fucking pay for

1734
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
PewDiePie and Tyler

1735
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Oakley and The Drunk Chef.

1736
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
I'm not going to pay for that.

1737
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
I have no problem with them doing their thing. That's fine.

1738
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
But, like, I'm kind of,

1739
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
I'm not worried for them, but, like, they're

1740
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
literally making it difficult to

1741
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
do their thing on YouTube.

1742
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Now they're making them sign these deals

1743
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
to be on this, you know, YouTube Red type stuff.

1744
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Game companies

1745
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
are being blocked from having their content

1746
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
on the service. Other game companies

1747
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
are fucking blocking people from using it

1748
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
or taking their ad revenue because

1749
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
they want to do their shit. It's like, it's

1750
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
getting so fucking complicated.

1751
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
This is great for indies.

1752
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I'm telling you that much because indie guys are like,

1753
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
what the fuck is going on? Just play my game.

1754
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I would love it if you played my game. I'm not going to

1755
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
do anything. You play my game? Cool.

1756
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
We're done. That's it. You know what would have

1757
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
shut YouTube up is if these

1758
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
big creators, their bread

1759
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
and butter, the creators,

1760
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
had banded together and said,

1761
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
no, shove it.

1762
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Like, we're going to go to this

1763
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
other site unless you give us

1764
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
a better deal type of thing or, you know, you give

1765
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
the user more freedom. They really should have, but unfortunately

1766
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
that didn't happen. We're going to go to this other site.

1767
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Which site? Yeah, which site?

1768
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Somebody in chat said Daily Motion, but it's just,

1769
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
I know that's a video site, but it's not, you know,

1770
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
I don't know, it's not the kind of thing, but now is the time

1771
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
for those types of sites to strike.

1772
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Somebody could make,

1773
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
you know, these big creators an offer

1774
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
and possibly siphon some of the content. But the Content ID,

1775
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
though, it's just, it's greed by this publisher,

1776
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
by these publishers. I mean,

1777
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
and don't get me wrong, I think it's cool to

1778
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
protect artists' rights

1779
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
and stuff like that, but that's not what they're doing.

1780
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
They're just protecting publisher

1781
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
rights and wanting to be able to

1782
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
sell that content at a premium.

1783
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Instead of like, hey,

1784
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
this song was licensed for this video game

1785
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
and it just happens to be in the background

1786
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
of this video of the video game because

1787
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
it's part of the video game.

1788
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
Oh, but let's copyright strike these because

1789
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
god damn it, you didn't license that

1790
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
song to be played on your channel.

1791
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
It's way too complicated. It shouldn't be this complicated.

1792
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Bonds006 in chat says,

1793
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
the companies that once all supported

1794
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
CISPA are now getting forced to

1795
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
their knees by YouTube.

1796
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
YouTube will now be the new grandfather

1797
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
of online free media.

1798
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
So.

1799
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Bonds006 says

1800
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
YouTube already has them by the balls. It's YouTube's way

1801
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
to get the fuck out. And I know I've called this out

1802
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
before, as I'm sure a lot of you guys have too,

1803
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
as part of the problem with YouTube

1804
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
is that there isn't, this is why

1805
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
competition, and I'm not usually

1806
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
the type to get up there and go like

1807
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
rah rah rah capitalism.

1808
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
But in this such

1809
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
of a narrow, and don't get me started on political

1810
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
stuff, don't read too much into what I just said.

1811
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
When we don't have

1812
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
any type of competitor for YouTube

1813
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
that competes with them on that level,

1814
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
this is what happens.

1815
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
You know what I mean? Like this is why there needs

1816
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
to be that type of competition and this is why

1817
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
and I've kind of said this about

1818
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Twitch too, right? Twitch was so

1819
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
dominant that, you know, when

1820
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
their rules went into place, they needed some competition

1821
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
to get them worried. Enter YouTube,

1822
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
ironically enough,

1823
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
to kind of mix that up a little bit. And I think

1824
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
really, based on what we've been hearing out of TwitchCon

1825
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
TwitchCon and all this stuff, it's making Twitch

1826
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
better, because they're having to

1827
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
you know, make sure that they involve themselves

1828
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
to make themselves the better option. And I

1829
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
really want to see the same thing happen to YouTube.

1830
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
And from a gaming standpoint, maybe

1831
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
that will happen, is that these games that are blocked

1832
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
from YouTube, well shit on the PlayStation 4,

1833
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
you're one button press from going over to Twitch.

1834
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Well it's just like the YouTube gaming stuff.

1835
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I've never launched the YouTube gaming app.

1836
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
I don't fucking care.

1837
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
I can find gaming videos just fine on YouTube.

1838
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Like,

1839
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
how could you not find gaming videos

1840
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
on YouTube? That's impossible.

1841
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
I don't understand

1842
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
how people are having such a difficult

1843
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
time in finding gaming videos

1844
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
that they need to create a separate app for that.

1845
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
It's just like,

1846
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
I don't get it. It's like,

1847
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
shit, I can't find any cat pictures

1848
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
on Reddit. If only we had a separate

1849
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Reddit for cats.

1850
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
I think there is a separate Reddit for cats.

1851
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
I'm sure there is, but I'm just saying that

1852
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
it's impossible to not

1853
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
like, this was never, you

1854
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
came up with a solution for a problem that didn't

1855
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
exist, is what it is.

1856
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Isn't that called capitalism?

1857
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
It's not capitalism.

1858
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
It's just, it's useless.

1859
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
It's just like, the whole thing was that they were trying to compete with Twitch.

1860
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Just like capitalism. I would say

1861
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
that's more the other extreme end

1862
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
of it, right? When the corporations are people,

1863
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
right? We know what you want.

1864
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
How many times has

1865
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
that been nails on a chalkboard to you?

1866
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
When a gaming company gets up there and goes,

1867
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
this is what the gamers want.

1868
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
They want microtransactions and all this other stuff,

1869
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
and you're like, fuck a whole lot of you.

1870
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Because that's so, like you're

1871
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
sitting there going, no, it is not what I want, actually.

1872
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
What gamers want is for you to get your head out of your

1873
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
ass and actually look around.

1874
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
The fucking end.

1875
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
It's not about what you want, it's about what we

1876
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
want. And if we don't want what you're

1877
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
doing, we're gonna go somewhere else. And you know what

1878
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
gamers want? Fuckery.

1879
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Another fucking Super Mario RPG.

1880
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
That is what gamers want.

1881
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
So if that is not what you're

1882
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
bringing me, get off the stage.

1883
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
You know what we want?

1884
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
What? Zillion three.

1885
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
What do we want?

1886
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Guardian Legends sequel. When do we want it?

1887
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Now. Yesterday.

1888
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
SSG100 Matt says, someone

1889
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
needs the capital and the infrastructure to handle

1890
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
a massive amount of data like YouTube.

1891
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
On top of that, said business

1892
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
needs to find profit in that.

1893
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Where is the immediate profit in a YouTube competitor?

1894
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
You know what though, guys?

1895
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
YouTube

1896
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
didn't start in a day

1897
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
and Facebook started somewhere.

1898
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
And MySpace looked like

1899
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
it was never gonna go away. You know who's evil enough to compete

1900
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
with Google? Facebook.

1901
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
They've got the capital,

1902
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
they've got the resources. Unfortunately

1903
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
it wouldn't be very good, but

1904
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
I'll take competitors

1905
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
as long as they're competing. Maybe that'll fix

1906
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
something.

1907
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Alright.

1908
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Anyhow, let's move on. Maybe they

1909
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
can come up with their own service and they'll be called

1910
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
F-Tube.

1911
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Yeah?

1912
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Yeah, F-Tube?

1913
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some

1914
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
release dates and some video games that you

1915
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
may or may not be streaming to YouTube, but pretty soon.

1916
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Release dates for games.

1917
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Loki. Starting in the US.

1918
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
So this week we've got

1919
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Divinity Original Sin Enhanced Edition

1920
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
coming out on Playstation 4 and

1921
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Xbox One.

1922
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
A game called Halo 5 Guardians.

1923
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
That's coming out on Xbox

1924
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
One this week. Also the Limited

1925
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Edition. Fuck, is that

1926
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
really this week? That is this week.

1927
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
That is Tuesday. I feel

1928
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
like I have to

1929
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
buy it, but I don't

1930
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
want to because I've got all these other games I need to be.

1931
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Then don't buy it right now. But it's Halo.

1932
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
You can buy it, just not right now.

1933
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
I gotta...

1934
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I need it.

1935
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
What kind of gamer am I

1936
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
if I don't own the newest thing?

1937
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Rob.

1938
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Can you eat Halo 5?

1939
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Can you breathe it?

1940
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
How much barbecue sauce can you

1941
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
drink it? Technically, does it put a roof over your

1942
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
head? Technically, you can

1943
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
eat Halo 5. Oh wait, no, that's Call of Duty

1944
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Black Ops 3, I'm thinking. Sorry.

1945
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
They're doing a promotion with

1946
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Carl's Jr. apparently for that.

1947
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
If I duct tape a lot of the discs

1948
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
together, I could make a box

1949
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
to live in out of Halo 5.

1950
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Don't fucking challenge

1951
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
me, woman. It's not needed for survival.

1952
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
You could hollow out an original Xbox

1953
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
and could have a family of four live in that,

1954
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
but you know, that's not...

1955
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Anyways, so Minecraft

1956
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Story Mode, the season pass disc

1957
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
is coming out as well. If you want

1958
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
to just jump into all of

1959
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
those episodes, that's on

1960
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4,

1961
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Xbox 360, and Xbox One.

1962
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
WWE 2K6

1963
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
coming out on PlayStation 3,

1964
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, and

1965
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Xbox One as well.

1966
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
Lords

1967
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
of the Fallen complete edition.

1968
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
That'll be the following week, actually.

1969
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
And

1970
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
that'll be it.

1971
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
OK, so Alan Alchemy in chat

1972
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
said I had to show Jamie what he bought

1973
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
this week. Speaking of, I want

1974
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
it. I need it. Look at this.

1975
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Yeah. Mass Effect Monopoly

1976
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
something he bought this week.

1977
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Although, doesn't that look like it's based on

1978
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Mass Effect 2? Kind of. Yeah.

1979
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
But yet, it

1980
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
says copyright 2015, so I guess

1981
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
it's newer. I did miss one. Dark

1982
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Ciders 2, the definitive

1983
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
edition coming on PlayStation

1984
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
4 and Xbox One.

1985
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Just in time for Halloween.

1986
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Also, MX vs ATV Supercross

1987
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Encore on PlayStation 4.

1988
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
And do you know

1989
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
why he bought Monopoly Mass Effect?

1990
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Because it was there. Yeah, because he fucking wanted it.

1991
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Cue the American flag and the theme.

1992
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
I

1993
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
honestly, I knew about it, and

1994
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
I hate playing Monopoly.

1995
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
I really hate playing Monopoly.

1996
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
I don't even play

1997
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
all the five other different collector's

1998
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
versions of Monopoly that we have. Yeah,

1999
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
but this has a space hamster as one of

2000
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
the tokens. You know what?

2001
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
IDGAF.

2002
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
I

2003
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
might have gotten the Mass Effect

2004
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
risk, but

2005
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
I'm not...

2006
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
That's kind of expensive. I didn't

2007
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
care.

2008
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I'm actually

2009
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
really getting a lot more into Dragon Age

2010
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
than Mass Effect until Andromeda

2011
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
comes out. Until Andromeda's out, yeah.

2012
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
So, I'm content.

2013
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Fair enough.

2014
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Alright, let's go over to Japan and check out

2015
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
some of the releases in Japan this week. God Eater

2016
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Resurrection on the PlayStation 4,

2017
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
a regular and a crossplay pack.

2018
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Also, NBA 2K16

2019
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
makes its way to Japan, getting

2020
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
its release on the 29th.

2021
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Heading over to

2022
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
the Wii U, I think, is still kind of

2023
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
dry this week. They get Lego

2024
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Jurassic World on November 5th, but that's

2025
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
still a couple weeks away. On the

2026
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Vita this week, I would expect that we'll probably

2027
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
see God Eater over there, too. Yep,

2028
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
we sure do, because that's that crossplay.

2029
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Alias Carnival, Sacrament

2030
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
is out this week.

2031
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Heart no Kuni, no Alice Wonderful

2032
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Twin World, a new version. Also,

2033
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Love Revenge, regular and

2034
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
limited edition, Raishi,

2035
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
and Yomawari. Those are

2036
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
all Vita releases.

2037
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
More than any other system I'm going to read this week.

2038
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Like, that was like, what, one, two, three,

2039
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
four, five, six releases

2040
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
on the Vita this week in Japan.

2041
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
It is such a different story.

2042
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
It just blows my mind.

2043
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
On the Nintendo 3DS this week

2044
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
over in Japan,

2045
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
looks like actually nothing

2046
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
on the 3DS this week. There's some new

2047
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
cases, but that's really it.

2048
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Otherwise, Disney Magic Castles,

2049
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
which you have to look forward to in two weeks.

2050
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
But, you know, they love

2051
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Disney in Japan almost as much as we

2052
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
love it here, so Disney releases are a pretty big deal

2053
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
over there, too. Alright,

2054
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
let's go to the UK, Dark Sakura.

2055
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
On the 27th, we have Darksiders

2056
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
which is attached to the Death

2057
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Initive edition.

2058
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
I'm sorry, I'm full of

2059
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
pumpkin cinnamon roll.

2060
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
It's coming on PlayStation 4

2061
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
and Xbox One.

2062
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
We have Halo 5 Guardians for Xbox One

2063
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
and WWE 2K16

2064
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
on everything else.

2065
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
On the 30th, Lands End comes out on

2066
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Android and Shin Megami Tensei

2067
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Devil Survivor 2

2068
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
on 3DS.

2069
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
And I'll go ahead and say it on the 31st,

2070
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
we have Five Nights at Freddy's 4, the final

2071
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
chapter.

2072
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
On PC. In the UK.

2073
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Oh, I was like, wait a minute.

2074
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
I was like, I had to look at it again, because

2075
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
I was like, didn't you guys get that too?

2076
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I guess not.

2077
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
But don't we get that, isn't that RPG

2078
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
a Halloween thing in the US? I think it is.

2079
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
I felt like that was what was being targeted.

2080
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Maybe.

2081
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Alright.

2082
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
This looks like the same shit we got.

2083
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Alright, well moving on,

2084
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
just a couple more stories for you guys than the classic

2085
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
game of the week.

2086
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
By the way, AkumaJP in chat says

2087
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
I am not kidding. You can get murdered

2088
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
if you say bad things about Disney here.

2089
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
I

2090
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
wish it was like that here.

2091
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
No, I'm just kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

2092
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
But, yeah, no,

2093
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
here, here we have to defend

2094
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
ourselves for being big kids

2095
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
when we're too into Disney a little bit.

2096
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
I don't know, I think actually it's a lot less.

2097
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
I think everybody in

2098
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
their 30s and 40s kind of grew up with

2099
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
all that, so it's kind of less

2100
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
than probably what it used to be. Fuck that,

2101
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
I didn't get to.

2102
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
It was still around you.

2103
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
It was on the gummy bears on TV

2104
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
and stuff. But I didn't get to go to Disneyland

2105
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
or Disney World even.

2106
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
And I think, honestly, neither did I.

2107
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
And I did watch Song of the South at least six times in a row

2108
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
as a kid. I think we made up for lost time.

2109
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
I think that's what happened with me in Disneyland.

2110
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
That's what I have a feeling of.

2111
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
And by the way, the reason why I bring that up is because

2112
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
it was in Alabama and we

2113
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
did have Song of the South on

2114
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
VHS. Now

2115
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
that you can't find it at all anywhere.

2116
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
So, of course, I

2117
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
also lived where the Black Cauldron was

2118
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
also banned. Oh

2119
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
jeez, Black Cauldron is like one of those like

2120
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
and it's butchered up anyway. If it had

2121
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
been like the full thing, that

2122
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
would have been badass. Well, it was

2123
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
most of the fairy tales

2124
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
are kind of butchered up. I mean, in Cinderella

2125
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
didn't they chop the

2126
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
superstitious foot off? Yeah, she cut

2127
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
off her toes. Yeah, they didn't do that in Cinderella.

2128
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
But in the Black Cauldron, they actually

2129
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
had more footage

2130
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
that they cut out to make it less

2131
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
dark. And it made

2132
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
the story not make sense. Because Island

2133
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Wii was great. I thought of you today and I

2134
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
probably shouldn't be saying this now because you'll probably go, gee, thanks

2135
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
for telling me. But I heard that Don Bluth

2136
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
was at some convention here in Sac today. Yeah, I know about that.

2137
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Okay, you knew. Yeah, it was like Sac Con

2138
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

2139
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
I thought of you when I saw that because I was like

2140
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
what Don Bluth stans do I know? Oh, Jamie.

2141
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Well, because Don Bluth

2142
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
before he had his major studio

2143
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
animated the

2144
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Don't Walk Away scene in Xanadu.

2145
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I should have had a copy of Dragon's

2146
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Lair autographed. That would have been

2147
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
cool. I would have just taken

2148
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
my copy of Xanadu.

2149
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Here, sign this.

2150
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
I'm the one that likes it. Legit.

2151
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Me and three other people.

2152
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Alright.

2153
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Let's see. Loki.

2154
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Alright, so

2155
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
oddly enough

2156
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Vivendi has been investing

2157
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
quite a bit in Ubisoft.

2158
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
They made, I guess,

2159
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
161 million dollar

2160
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
investment last week and now another

2161
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
111 million dollars

2162
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
this week. And I guess

2163
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
because of that, the

2164
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
stock went up from

2165
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
6.6% to

2166
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
10.39%.

2167
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
But

2168
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
of course, it's kind of making them a little bit

2169
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
uneasy. Basically,

2170
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
the CEO

2171
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Yiz Gamat

2172
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
basically said that the investment is

2173
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
unsolicited and unwelcome.

2174
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
And, you know, they're

2175
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
not sure what exactly

2176
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
their intention is on purchasing

2177
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
all this stock. It was like a hostile

2178
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
takeover, you know, what the case may be

2179
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
in that. But

2180
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
yeah, interesting to see. I know

2181
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
recently what Activision

2182
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
had to pay a bunch of money just to get rid of

2183
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Vivendi off of

2184
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
their books, basically.

2185
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
So now the

2186
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
alien is looking for another creature

2187
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
to suck dry.

2188
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
Look out!

2189
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Alright.

2190
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
One more story for you guys.

2191
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
It's about sports games, which I don't talk about

2192
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
a lot on this show. But, you know,

2193
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
it's an important part of what drives

2194
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
the industry and sells

2195
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
consoles and so forth. And if you weren't

2196
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
aware, there's some really interesting stuff

2197
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
going on in the basketball world.

2198
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
You know, 2K

2199
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Games makes

2200
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
an NBA series. They have

2201
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
the NBA 2K series.

2202
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
And EA has their own NBA Live series.

2203
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
And if you weren't aware, NBA

2204
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Live last year was not

2205
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
good. In fact, it was

2206
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
really bad. Well, NBA Live was like

2207
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
postponed for a few years because it

2208
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
originally leaked out even. They put it

2209
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
out and then pulled it back really fast.

2210
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
And someone had bought one of those versions

2211
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
and it was just shit.

2212
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
And then they took a couple years

2213
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
off to fix it and then

2214
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
released it and it was still shit. And then

2215
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
the following year, well, it's better this year.

2216
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Still shit.

2217
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Well, both these basketball games came out

2218
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
this past month and

2219
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
NBA 2K actually

2220
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
sold 1 million units.

2221
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
NBA 2K16 sold a million units.

2222
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
It came out in the middle of the month. Biggest

2223
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
selling sports game launch this generation.

2224
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
So, I mean, huge launch.

2225
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
Did very well.

2226
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
EA's NBA Live sold

2227
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
8,000

2228
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
units.

2229
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Oh, shit. Compared to 1 million.

2230
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Yeah, that ain't coming back.

2231
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Only

2232
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
8,000

2233
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
people in the entire

2234
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
country. See, Square Enix, this

2235
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
right here is a disappointment in sales.

2236
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Not 3 million from Tomb Raider.

2237
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
8,000. You know

2238
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
which game sold more than 8,000

2239
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
units? Earth Defense Force

2240
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
fucking sold more than 8,000 units.

2241
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
I think President Cat sold more

2242
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
units than this game did.

2243
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
That's something.

2244
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
And, you know, if you think about it, like,

2245
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
you know, either

2246
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
it's just that 2K has established themselves

2247
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
as this dominant franchise and people are like,

2248
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
I don't need two basketball games. I got this one.

2249
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Or, it's just

2250
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
the EA's kind of

2251
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
what the series has done before this.

2252
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
The reputation just, it's ruined.

2253
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
It's absolutely ruined and people don't.

2254
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
And it's bad because NBA 2K, I think, has done some

2255
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
shit recently that's been kind of like,

2256
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
eh, you know.

2257
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
I don't follow too much. I know that

2258
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
they're live scanning. The face scanning

2259
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
thing's not working out, but it never has.

2260
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
I

2261
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
don't know. But, yeah, the point,

2262
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
you only have two options, really.

2263
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
I think they should just get, I don't

2264
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
know how long into that exclusive deal that

2265
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
NBA, or, I don't even

2266
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
know if NBA works that way if they have, like, an

2267
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
exclusive deal between those two companies or if

2268
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
other companies can make NBA games.

2269
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
I hope that they didn't pay for a long

2270
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
licensing

2271
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
period because, eh, it's not going to work out.

2272
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Well, but, you know, they're swimming

2273
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
in buckets of money because of Madden, so.

2274
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Well, yeah, but, I mean, they could be

2275
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
having more buckets of money if their game didn't

2276
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
suck.

2277
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
That is very true.

2278
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Alright. Let's

2279
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
take a trip down memory lane, you guys.

2280
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Dark Soccer's going to step into the gaming vault

2281
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
and find a game

2282
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
that she thinks, hey, you guys should be

2283
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
playing this this week. We're going to go back

2284
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
to a time when the only basketball

2285
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
game that mattered was Double Dribble.

2286
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
And I had low standards. Remember

2287
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
when Konami fucking made

2288
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
games like Double Dribble?

2289
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Maybe we'll get Double Dribble Pachinko someday.

2290
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Alright. Moving on,

2291
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Dark Soccer's going to step into the gaming vault and find a game she

2292
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
thinks, hey, you should play this this week.

2293
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
You, you dumb kid.

2294
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Alright. What is the classic

2295
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
game of the week, Dark Soccer?

2296
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Super high impact.

2297
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Now, I have to say

2298
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
why I picked this game.

2299
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I was like, did we go all sports ball this week? What happened?

2300
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
My brothers and I played the shit

2301
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
out of this game. And we

2302
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
we would, there's like this little guitar

2303
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
thing that plays after you pick your play.

2304
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
We used to make that sound

2305
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
like we were growling at each other.

2306
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
And we used to try to, like, tackle each other

2307
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
until the other person would explode.

2308
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
This game is so over the top.

2309
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
And it was actually one of the

2310
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
precursors to the NFL

2311
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Blitz series. You remember how

2312
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
kind of oddball that one was.

2313
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Anyway, super high

2314
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
impact. It was the sequel

2315
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
to High Impact. This one

2316
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
came out by Midway in 1991.

2317
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
And

2318
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
it was just a football game running

2319
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
on a JAMA harness.

2320
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
And it had one button

2321
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
and an 8-way joystick. Ooh.

2322
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Um, so anyway, with this

2323
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
particular game, you had

2324
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
a, basically your button

2325
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
was like, your pass, your

2326
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
action, your, all of

2327
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
this, you know, it was the

2328
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
one way to decide what happened. Which I

2329
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
honestly didn't care for that so much on the arcade one.

2330
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Which I did play that a few times.

2331
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Um.

2332
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
But the thing about this

2333
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
one, it was just really over

2334
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
the top. Um.

2335
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
You could tackle

2336
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
somebody until they would

2337
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
explode into a mass of body parts.

2338
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
You had

2339
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
the hit meter or something.

2340
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
What was it called? It was

2341
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
the hit-o-meter, the

2342
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
whack-o-meter or something.

2343
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
And so you'd get, uh,

2344
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
like a thumbs up or a

2345
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
you know, a rank like awesome

2346
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
if you sacked somebody

2347
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
badly enough. It was just really over the top.

2348
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
And like,

2349
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
they'd say little insults at each other

2350
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
before each play and everything. It was

2351
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
just, just really a silly

2352
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
game. Um.

2353
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
But it was, actually for me, who's always

2354
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
hated football, it was

2355
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
a fun game. It was just really

2356
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
fun. It was easy to play. You could

2357
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
pick your, your plays and everything.

2358
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
And, now the version that

2359
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
I had was the Super Nintendo

2360
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
version that, in my, and now

2361
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
that I recall this,

2362
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
it really did keep

2363
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
a lot of stuff from the

2364
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
arcade version. Maybe not some of the

2365
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
digitized, uh,

2366
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
characters that were in it.

2367
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
Like some of the pop-up people that would show up.

2368
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Like the manager or the referee.

2369
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
They were all

2370
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
I switched to the Super Nintendo version.

2371
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Uh, audio here.

2372
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
They were all like, you know, pixel people. They weren't, you know,

2373
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
actually, uh,

2374
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
rendered. Um, but it

2375
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
really had a lot of the same stuff.

2376
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
It had really clean

2377
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
graphics for a Super Nintendo

2378
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
sports game. And it

2379
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
was pretty fun.

2380
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
See, there's somebody going in

2381
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
until they explode. Um,

2382
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
and then,

2383
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
oh, here's this,

2384
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
this is, it was just a fun game. That's the only thing I can

2385
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
say about it. The Super Nintendo and

2386
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Genesis version came out

2387
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
in 1993 and

2388
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
it was put out by,

2389
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
you know, I had it in

2390
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
here and I don't have it now.

2391
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Um, I want to say it was put out by Acclaim.

2392
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
That was it.

2393
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
That's the, what is it called, the hit meter?

2394
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Yeah. So, um,

2395
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
I'll just leave it there. It, you know,

2396
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
it paved the way for the NFL Blitz

2397
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
series, which was, you know, another one

2398
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
in the same line. And

2399
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
that's it.

2400
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
We just don't have

2401
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
fun games like that. You know, sports games

2402
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
like that. They all take themselves too seriously.

2403
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
We need more sports games where people explode into body parts.

2404
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Exactly, or you get

2405
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
something else. Or like in Blades

2406
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
of Steel where it was all about the fighting

2407
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
sub-game where two people get in a fight. You need

2408
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
the over the top, I mean, like now what we

2409
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
have, Mutant League and what was the

2410
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
other football game that's out on Steam right

2411
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
now? Um, you know,

2412
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
they just don't have that fun anymore.

2413
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Right.

2414
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Alright there, touchdown!

2415
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
But that's

2416
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
the SNES version. It has all the same stuff

2417
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
from the arcade version. Yeah. Um,

2418
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
you know, a little, a little,

2419
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
uh, I'd say, uh,

2420
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
panned down, but not, you know, not that bad.

2421
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
And the sad thing is, is that, I

2422
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
tried to find more information about

2423
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
this game and it really, I guess,

2424
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
kind of fell off into obscurity.

2425
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Um, not too many people, I guess,

2426
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
cared about it. But for me,

2427
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
like I said, I hate football.

2428
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
I hate football games. I love this fucking

2429
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
game. So, that's it.

2430
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Uh, super high impact. There it is, your

2431
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
classic game of the week. Super high impact.

2432
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Uh, Dark Tetsuya's Blitz is definitely one of my

2433
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
favorite sports games ever. As

2434
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
200 Matt says, super high impact is the XFL

2435
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
of football games. Yes!

2436
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
Without being a bad business

2437
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
decision.

2438
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Alright.

2439
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Well that is gonna do it

2440
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
for this first part of, uh,

2441
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000

username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

We'll do all of that when we come

01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
back with more after this break of

2452
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.

2453
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Welcome back everybody

2454
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
to Orange Lounge Radio

2455
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Live tonight, October

2456
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
the 25th of 2015 with episode

2457
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
619 of our show

2458
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
already in progress. We're gonna get back

2459
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
into some news here, uh, in a bit.

2460
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
First though, I thought, uh, I thought you guys would get

2461
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
a kick out of, um, my story about

2462
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
what I did yesterday. So I went on

2463
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
another, uh, adventure with my

2464
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
friend Shane, which, you know, he's been on the show

2465
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
before. He's not here this week, but he was on the past couple weeks.

2466
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
And, uh, we decided randomly, we were

2467
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
gonna take a trip to Chico yesterday, which, um,

2468
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Chico's a town, it's a college town, it's

2469
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
about two hours north of here where we tape our show

2470
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
in Sacramento. And I actually lived

2471
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
there for like three years, cause I went to school at Chico

2472
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
State. And, um, that's actually

2473
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
where the radio station there was where I first

2474
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
got into this whole thing. So, uh, there's that.

2475
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
But, uh, we went there

2476
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
for a couple reasons. A,

2477
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
I wanted Mongolian

2478
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
BBQ at a place up there I hadn't

2479
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
eaten at in like over a decade.

2480
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
And it's still as good as I remember it, just for the record.

2481
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Um, so it was totally

2482
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
worth it. Uh, and then B,

2483
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
uh, we thought we'd do some

2484
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Ingress up there cause I wanted some

2485
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
unique portals from places I hadn't been yet

2486
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
and Shane is playing more and more.

2487
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
So we decided to go play at a graveyard over there.

2488
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
But C, the most important

2489
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
uh, thing is that we were also

2490
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
uh, kinda doing some of the shopping.

2491
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Uh, cause you know, uh, Shane

2492
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
he's talked about his Power Ranger

2493
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
uh, addiction here on the show

2494
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
and the toys and stuff that he buys with that.

2495
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Um, and so we had not

2496
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
gone to the stores in Yuba City, which is

2497
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
on the way. Yuba City's like halfway there. And then

2498
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Chico is like fully north. So we went to the store

2499
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
in Yuba City in Chico. And

2500
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
uh, there's something about that Toys R Us

2501
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
in Chico. I don't know if we happen to have any listeners

2502
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
up there, but I gotta say that Toys R Us is like

2503
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
trapped in a time machine somehow.

2504
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
And Shane got really excited when he saw

2505
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
that at this Toys R Us

2506
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
they still had like in their

2507
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
aisle with video games. Like had the

2508
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
PS4 games. They had like the laminated

2509
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
one sheet. And you'd have to

2510
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
take the pull slip if you wanted the game

2511
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
and actually go take it up to the front

2512
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
counter cause I don't know how long

2513
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
the Toys R Us got rid of that. But for some

2514
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
reason the store that's trapped in time

2515
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
still had that. And on top of

2516
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
all that stuff, believe it or not, they had

2517
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
one of the toys that Shane was missing

2518
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
at this Toys R Us that time

2519
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
forgot two hours north of

2520
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Major Metropolis. So you better take me

2521
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
there. And they had

2522
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
tons of amiibo. That's where I saw

2523
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
the Animal Crossing amiibo cards. I was like

2524
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
should I get some for Jamie cause

2525
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
I'm not gonna play that game. And then I

2526
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
just saw, I saw like

2527
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
easily like 40 Shulk amiibo.

2528
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
I mean I already have one at this point but

2529
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
there was easily like 40 Shulk amiibo

2530
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
like in all the I guess

2531
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Toys R Us. Why didn't you bring me one? I didn't know

2532
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
you wanted one. I kind of

2533
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
don't wanna buy one. There you go.

2534
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
I did and

2535
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
bring you back to video games. I did end up

2536
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
getting amiibo for myself. So I got

2537
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
the blue and pink yarn Yoshi

2538
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
to finish my collections. I have all three yarn

2539
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Yoshis cause they're kinda cute.

2540
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
And I finally got an adult link

2541
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
cause believe it or not I didn't have one cause

2542
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
I was really mad at amiibo when they first came out.

2543
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
And now that I'm finally getting over it

2544
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
I wanted to go back and get some of the ones

2545
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
I missed out on. So I actually found

2546
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
a link thank God still

2547
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
at one of these stores that time forgot so I was able to

2548
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
buy it. So there you go.

2549
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Going to our chatroom

2550
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
over at live.vognetwork.com

2551
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Tigerclaw in chat says

2552
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
speaking of Power Rangers, the Power Rangers movie

2553
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
just cast an Asian actor as the Black Ranger

2554
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
and a Black actor for the Blue Ranger.

2555
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
I think yeah, I think they're

2556
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
trying to be kinda diverse in their casting

2557
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
of the folks which is cool.

2558
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
I think kids want to see themselves represented

2559
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
in the Power Rangers so why not?

2560
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
Sounds fun.

2561
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Let's see. Also going to

2562
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com

2563
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
I think they're just talking about

2564
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
amiibo in chatroom

2565
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
and finding the different amiibo out there.

2566
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Somebody recommending that PodCulture

2567
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
joins a local amiibo group.

2568
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Brad from PodCulture

2569
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
saying he just picked up a link online.

2570
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Is that local group like an

2571
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
amiibo anonymous?

2572
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Yeah, amiibo addicts anonymous. Something like that.

2573
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Probably.

2574
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
I guess I need to join. I think I'm up to

2575
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
37 amiibo. It's pretty gross.

2576
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Like, Loki, you could bring your Wii U

2577
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
back and I would have more stuff for you to

2578
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
unlock. Yeah, I haven't

2579
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
played Mario Maker this week.

2580
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
I need to bring yours over to my house, Rob.

2581
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Yeah? Yeah. I can do that.

2582
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Please do that and then we can hang out. There we go.

2583
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
It'll be fun. I just need a carrying case.

2584
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
And of course, I'll leave it to Bobby Blackwolf

2585
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
to storm into the chatroom and make the

2586
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
mandatory comment that goes with that.

2587
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
37 amiibo? In a row?

2588
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
You know what's sad is that

2589
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
reference is getting more and more dated.

2590
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Didn't that movie come out in like 1997

2591
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
or something? Like, it's...

2592
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
That reference is getting dated.

2593
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
Don't buy any amiibo on the way out.

2594
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Oh god, it was 1994.

2595
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Try not to

2596
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
buy any amiibo on your way out to the parking lot.

2597
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Alright, let's go over some

2598
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
rapid fire news.

2599
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Some quick gaming headlines this week. Loki.

2600
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
So this actually made me pretty excited.

2601
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
The fact that they're going to be bringing back

2602
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Day of the Tentacle, which I think was one of the

2603
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
greatest LucasArts

2604
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
games that they kind of

2605
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
did a sequel to, you know, kind of when they started

2606
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
doing the new games.

2607
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
I love that game. And actually, the...

2608
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Not really a remake.

2609
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
I guess it's more of a remaster.

2610
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
The remaster looks nice. There's not a whole

2611
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
ton of difference other than it's not pixelated.

2612
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
So, I mean,

2613
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
it's a good game, so I definitely would recommend

2614
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
checking it out when it comes out.

2615
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
They don't really have a

2616
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
date yet when it's coming out, but apparently

2617
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
you would have been able to check it out earlier

2618
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
this week, or last week,

2619
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
during Indicade, which was at

2620
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
LA, and they were running a

2621
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
preview build of that, so...

2622
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Pretty cool. And I'll be coming out

2623
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
later on. And then

2624
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
with this, Rockstar

2625
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
is adding some new

2626
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
modes to Grand Theft Auto online,

2627
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
including their Lowrider

2628
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
update, which

2629
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
allows you to do all sorts of cool customization

2630
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
of Lowriders and stuff. It's starting

2631
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
to get to

2632
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
kind of what they had in San Andreas,

2633
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
where you can do all the

2634
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
different

2635
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
hydraulics and that kind of fun stuff.

2636
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
But they're going to be

2637
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
adding some new adversaries.

2638
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
I guess

2639
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Keep the Pace

2640
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
is a new game. I guess it's sort of similar

2641
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
to Speed, the movie, where

2642
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
you have to stay above the minimum velocity or you

2643
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
explode, which is awesome.

2644
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Offense Defense, which is an

2645
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
asymmetrical mode, with people

2646
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
running towards the end of a route, while

2647
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
protectors are trying to stop them.

2648
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
That kind of sounds actually

2649
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
like the...

2650
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
What was that one that... It was like the...

2651
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
The jet game

2652
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
we played in there was really fun, where

2653
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
there's... That was one of my favorite

2654
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
modes in Grand Theft Auto online.

2655
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
I can't remember what the hell it's called now, but

2656
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
you have people running

2657
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
to get to the end of this

2658
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
checkpoint, and there's

2659
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
people in jets firing at you.

2660
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
It's awesome. It's so

2661
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
intense. I really need to go back and play

2662
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
that. And then, of course, they also

2663
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
have a new scene creator with

2664
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Rockstar Editor. It allows you to set

2665
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
up different scenarios. You can place props

2666
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
from a catalog of more than 200, and

2667
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
save four settings for

2668
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
different scenes and stuff

2669
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
like that. So, awesome.

2670
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Have that check it out.

2671
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
And let's see...

2672
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Last but not least, Tony Hawk,

2673
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Pro Skater 5. What a mess that

2674
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
shit was. And you may

2675
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
remember that it's also supposed to be coming out

2676
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
on the last gen systems.

2677
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Supposed to have been sometime

2678
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
in November. However,

2679
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
they're putting it on an

2680
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
indefinite hold. Maybe

2681
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
because they're making their money

2682
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
back with that game, and

2683
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
they're saying, we're working closely with

2684
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
our developers to address the issues identified

2685
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
by the community, like everything.

2686
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Our development resources

2687
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
are fully focused on fixing the content

2688
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
updates for PlayStation 4 and

2689
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Xbox One, so we have decided to delay the

2690
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
release of the PlayStation 3 and

2691
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
Xbox 360 versions. Yeah, probably because your

2692
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
game's still broken, so you probably want to fix it before you

2693
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
put out the game.

2694
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
We will update the community when we have more information

2695
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
about the release date. If there's a release date.

2696
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
I don't think there's much of a point at this point

2697
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
to releasing the last gen. I don't think

2698
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
they're going to release it. Yeah, I think it's going to go the way

2699
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
the Mortal Kombat had to do the same thing.

2700
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Mortal Kombat was a fine game.

2701
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Yeah, it was fine.

2702
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
They had to

2703
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
compromise too much to get it to run on the old

2704
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
systems, I bet. Anyhow,

2705
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
speaking of having to compromise some things

2706
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
to get it to work, Batman

2707
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Arkham Knight on the PC.

2708
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,000
It's finally happening. That's right.

2709
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Batman Arkham Knight on the

2710
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
PC coming out on October

2711
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
28th. That will be at 10 AM Pacific

2712
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
time, re-released for the

2713
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
PC. There will also be a patch at that time

2714
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
that brings the PC version fully up to

2715
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
date with content that has been released

2716
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
for console, with the exception of any

2717
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
console exclusives.

2718
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
So, that only took, what, like

2719
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
four months for them to fix all the issues?

2720
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
So, hmm.

2721
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Well, at least they fixed it,

2722
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
I guess. Better late than never.

2723
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
Hey, as we mentioned in the top

2724
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
of the show, in Jason's intro,

2725
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
Back to the Future week was this week, and there

2726
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
was some little things that

2727
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
happened in celebration on the 21st,

2728
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
including in Rocket League,

2729
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
which I always forget to mention

2730
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
this in my gaming week, but usually once a week

2731
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
I get invited to play in some Rocket League game,

2732
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
just randomly online, and that game is

2733
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
always a lot of fun. And so

2734
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
in Rocket League, there is a

2735
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
DeLorean that you can now drive

2736
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
around in the game. It's available

2737
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
for $1.99 on Steam

2738
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
and the PlayStation 4.

2739
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
The tires apparently flip up in

2740
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
the car as well, so that's

2741
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
cute. Also,

2742
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
you may remember there was a

2743
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
reference to the game Wild Gunman.

2744
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
You remember that game was one of the

2745
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
laser games? That was actually in

2746
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
Back to the Future Part II, because it was

2747
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
something that, as part of the plot,

2748
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Marty kicked ass

2749
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
at the game. Yeah, Cafe 80s, right?

2750
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
So they actually,

2751
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
in a tongue-in-cheek sort of way,

2752
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
in Europe, they released

2753
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
the Wild Gunman

2754
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
version to

2755
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Wii U Virtual Console in Europe. I don't know why

2756
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
we didn't get it here, but they got it over

2757
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
there in Europe. Dude, it would be awesome if they made

2758
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
a Cafe 80s in that style

2759
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
of Back to the Future II, just like all that

2760
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
retro futuristic shit. Patent

2761
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
pending. That would be awesome. Don't we

2762
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
have that in the form of coin-op downtown

2763
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
except a bar? No, but I'm talking about

2764
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
with the fucking TV monitors and shit

2765
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
with fucking Ronald Reagan. Loki won't say

2766
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
that he wants the fashion.

2767
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
He wants the fashion from Cafe

2768
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
80s. You know who does not?

2769
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Me, because I paid a lot of money in

2770
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Aquanet, okay? Hey, but

2771
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
hey, you can buy those Nike shoes soon

2772
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
for $9,000. Yeah, fuck that.

2773
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
No one's buying that shit.

2774
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
Well, it'll be a lot cheaper

2775
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
to get a hoverboard in

2776
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Star Trek Online, that is.

2777
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
Unfortunately, it's only until October 26th.

2778
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
I don't know why this is a limited time thing,

2779
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
but just before they roll out season

2780
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
11 in Star Trek Online,

2781
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
you can get a hoverboard.

2782
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
That's totally not canon.

2783
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Yeah, I know, but they

2784
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
made it kind of look like it.

2785
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
It says Flyer

2786
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Future or something on it. They made it

2787
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
just different enough, but I think it's a cute

2788
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
little wink and nod to Back to the Future.

2789
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
So, there it is.

2790
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
So, you can check that out in Star

2791
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Trek Online, but you better hurry before tomorrow.

2792
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Alright, also

2793
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
of very important news, you know we gotta

2794
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
update you on Splatfest

2795
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
here at OLR.

2796
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
We don't, because they inform you of that

2797
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
shit every time we fucking log into that game.

2798
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Well,

2799
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
anyway, the next Splatfest

2800
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
is happening on October 30th,

2801
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
beginning 9 o'clock. I don't know who's gonna

2802
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
play in this, because everybody's gonna be busy on Halloween.

2803
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
But, here it is, you guys.

2804
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
Pirates versus

2805
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Ninjas.

2806
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
This is, uh, it's a pretty big

2807
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
debate. The epic battle.

2808
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
The battle to end all battles. I can't

2809
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
pick. I don't know which team to pick.

2810
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
I really don't. I'm leaning

2811
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Team Ninja solely because

2812
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
they have a better color. They have the purple and the ninjas

2813
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
or, I'm sorry, the pirates kind of have that

2814
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
yucky green. But,

2815
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
I do really like to pirate music.

2816
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
So, I feel like, you know, we should show some

2817
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
piracy pride. And Weebl and Bob had the

2818
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
pirate ninja. But you'd like to not get

2819
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
caught by the companies pirating the music

2820
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
so you have to act like a ninja. So you have to act like a ninja

2821
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
when you do it. That's true. That's very true.

2822
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
But, Disney has the Pirates

2823
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
of the Caribbean ride.

2824
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
Then again, there was that movie,

2825
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Three Ninjas. I don't know. I just, I can't decide.

2826
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
I can't decide.

2827
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
You have to

2828
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
figure out which one's going to be

2829
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
not as popular

2830
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
because the least

2831
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
popular one always wins. Pirates.

2832
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
You think? You think more

2833
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
people will choose ninja? Do you get free t-shirts or anything

2834
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
for these things?

2835
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
In-game. Yeah, but I

2836
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
never received anything for planes.

2837
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
I didn't get a t-shirt that had planes on it.

2838
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
You don't get the t-shirt.

2839
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Okay, when you do the Splatfest,

2840
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
you have a Splatfest shirt

2841
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
that has the team logo on it

2842
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
or whatever it is. But you have to turn that in

2843
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
when Splatfest is done. And as a reward,

2844
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
depending on how well you did, you get snails

2845
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
which will modify your existing gear to

2846
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
give it more slots and stuff.

2847
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
That's what the Splatfest is for.

2848
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
That's why they do them every other week.

2849
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Okie doke. Alright.

2850
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
There it is.

2851
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Alright, and now everybody in chat

2852
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
is telling me which team to pick. You don't own

2853
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
me. You don't run my life.

2854
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Alright, I'll consider it.

2855
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Alright, moving on. Dark Saga.

2856
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Well, we have

2857
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
a thing that

2858
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
I would like to try except it's only in the UK.

2859
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
And that's Fallout Beer.

2860
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
It's going to be available on Amazon

2861
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
UK and

2862
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
the case will go

2863
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
for roughly £30.

2864
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
£29.99.

2865
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
It will be shipping

2866
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
on November 9th.

2867
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
Somebody in the UK better send me some.

2868
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Even though it is

2869
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
a Pilsner.

2870
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
I will forgive it because I need to try Fallout Beer.

2871
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
And there's a new

2872
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Bomberman game. And everyone's super excited

2873
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
except it's

2874
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
for cell phone.

2875
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
So, yeah.

2876
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
That's not as exciting but at least

2877
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
it's not another Pachinko machine.

2878
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Thank you, Konami.

2879
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
I wish Hudson would come back to life.

2880
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
And last but not least, there's a

2881
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
fan mod out there for

2882
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
the new Resident Evil HD.

2883
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
And it brings back the old voice

2884
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
acting. Apparently they had

2885
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
to go through something like

2886
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
over 500 different audio files

2887
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
to find and replace them with the originals.

2888
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Where's

2889
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Barry?

2890
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
That's awesome.

2891
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
You were almost a Jill sandwich.

2892
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
That's my favorite.

2893
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Yeah. I should have brought

2894
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
back that old thing for fortune cookie.

2895
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
You should have but

2896
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
it's alright. You have something Halloween appropriate.

2897
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
It's somewhere. Yeah.

2898
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Alright. If that is it

2899
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
for rapid fire news, which I believe it is,

2900
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
we are going to get into the

2901
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Google question of the week.

2902
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Every week

2903
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
we go to Facebook and we go to

2904
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Google Plus.

2905
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
And you combine those together, you get

2906
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
FOOGLE.

2907
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
And yes, believe it or not, people are still

2908
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
on Google Plus.

2909
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Because we do get answers over on Google Plus

2910
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
to our question of the week. And I'm going to start there

2911
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
tonight. Which the question of the week we

2912
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
asked about, you know, it has to do with that whole

2913
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
issue that Dark

2914
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Soccer brought up earlier where we had some of the

2915
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
nice employees that were leaving reviews

2916
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
on Amazon. But you know,

2917
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
they weren't the first. They're not going to be the last.

2918
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
So we wanted to ask, knowing

2919
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
that the above happens,

2920
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
do you let user reviews sway you

2921
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
one way or another when buying a

2922
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
video game product? What about

2923
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
when compared to critic reviews? Is one or

2924
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
the other both likely to

2925
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
sway you or neither?

2926
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
ActDeft replied and said,

2927
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
wait, people read Amazon

2928
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
product reviews in a serious manner?

2929
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
That's what I said.

2930
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
You know, I do quite often.

2931
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Especially if I'm buying something or trying to

2932
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
decide between... But when you know this happens,

2933
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
that people are sandbagging the reviews one way or another?

2934
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Well yes, not if they're sandbagging the reviews.

2935
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
I mean, you can tell.

2936
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Well, ActDeft continues, for real though, it's all

2937
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
sorts of shady considering that you may not read

2938
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
the reviews, but you'll look at the rating and hit

2939
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
hits and think, this is a good product based

2940
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
on that one. It may be not.

2941
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
Granted, most people that want Rock Band will

2942
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
probably just buy it and ignore the reviews

2943
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
like most people do with any big triple A game.

2944
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Retertainment says, between

2945
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
fake Amazon reviews, Twitch streamers

2946
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
getting paid off, and newspaper reviewers not

2947
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
playing the game in full before writing a review.

2948
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Who can you trust? Answer.

2949
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
The fine people at ORL.

2950
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:10,000
That's not...

2951
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
That is actually what he typed. ORL.

2952
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
Who's ORL?

2953
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Or really? Or really?

2954
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
I know that

2955
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
was a typo, but it was an extremely funny one.

2956
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
I'm sorry. When Loki rants about

2957
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
something, you know it's legit.

2958
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Now when do I get paid? Come on, positive statements

2959
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
of the internet's gotta be worth some internet dollars, right?

2960
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
I'm sorry, but you forfeit

2961
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
the dollars by misspelling the name of the

2962
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
show. I guess this

2963
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
pumpkin cinnamon roll I was gonna pay you with

2964
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
will have to go to somebody else.

2965
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Sorry. Alright.

2966
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
And lastly, Martin

2967
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
replied over on Google Plus and said,

2968
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
I trust Amazon reviews for physical

2969
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
products, but do not for games.

2970
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
I do trust certain video game reviewers

2971
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
and you get a sense of whether a game is

2972
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
for you from Twitch streamers and

2973
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
quick looks. Alright, let's

2974
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
go over to Facebook where we had quite a few answers.

2975
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
I'm gonna read some here. Alan Alchemy said,

2976
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
I tend to trust aggregates more

2977
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
simply because even if all critics are

2978
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
awful, when 200 of them all lean

2979
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
in the same direction, it's not really a coincidence.

2980
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
When a movie is 8% on

2981
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Rotten Tomatoes, even if it's a trash genre

2982
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
to begin with, like a teen slasher,

2983
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
I'm not gonna act like it's secretly good and they're

2984
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
all being haters. Then I'll look at the reader

2985
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
review aggregate score and see if they're widely

2986
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
different, or if it's for a niche game I'd probably

2987
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
buy anyway. TigerClaw

2988
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
says, I don't really let critic or user reviews

2989
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
dictate to me whether a product is good or bad.

2990
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
We've all been in situations where a

2991
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
product had great reviews. We had a bad

2992
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
experience with it. Or a product you had a

2993
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
great experience with, but everyone else gave it bad reviews.

2994
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
So it's really up to your decision

2995
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
if you want it that bad. You believe

2996
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
in it, you buy it.

2997
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
Bryce H. says, I don't let user

2998
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
reviews sway me one way or the other. I'd rather

2999
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
try it first hand or watch somebody else.

3000
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
What's bad for one person may be good for

3001
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
another. CriticalMyth

3002
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
says, positive user reviews

3003
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
rarely sway me. Negative

3004
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
user reviews can if they make specific

3005
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
points that touch on items that

3006
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
would affect my enjoyment of the game.

3007
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Same thing with pro reviews though.

3008
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Fabrice A. said, I

3009
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
read several reviews from several sources,

3010
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
both user reviews and professional reviews,

3011
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
and then I compare all the pros and cons

3012
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
from every review. That gives me a

3013
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
solid impression of a game.

3014
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Andy R. says, I tend to trust critic reviews

3015
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
a slight bit above user reviews, but

3016
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
at this point I've been around the block enough that I rarely

3017
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
use the user or critic reviews to

3018
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
sway my purchases. I feel like

3019
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
I can usually get a grasp on whether I'll enjoy a game

3020
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
based on factors like who is making

3021
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
it or preview materials. Plus

3022
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
I tend to stick to franchises I've enjoyed

3023
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
in the past. Dark Charger

3024
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
says, neither. I usually know prior

3025
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
to any review whether I'm going to buy it or not.

3026
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
I know what I like. Occasionally there will be

3027
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
great reviews for a game that I was not originally

3028
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
considering. I may give that game a second

3029
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
look and have discovered some great games this way.

3030
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Jordan T. says,

3031
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
I usually try to get a feel for an average

3032
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
of what a game is scoring in reviews.

3033
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
With a secondary interest in the extreme positive

3034
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
and especially negative comments,

3035
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
just see what people zero in on.

3036
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
After that, assuming I don't have previous experience

3037
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
with the game or IP, I'll check out gameplay

3038
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
footage to see if it's something I think I would like.

3039
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Justin H. says,

3040
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
I admit somewhat shamefully that I love

3041
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
both user and critic reviews.

3042
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
I use Metacritic to discover games I wouldn't play

3043
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
otherwise, specifically for older games

3044
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
and indie games. Reviews have also

3045
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
helped me avoid buying games that turn out to be not

3046
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
as good as perceived, like the first person

3047
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
shooter Brink or Reboot of Thief.

3048
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Reviews are just a tool,

3049
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
however, and I will buy games with bad reviews

3050
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
if I have a genuine interest in playing them regardless.

3051
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
And lastly, Master Claw

3052
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
says, I find most user reviews completely

3053
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
worthless. They're usually poorly written

3054
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
to a point of being unintelligible and they're

3055
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
never moderate. They're always like, OMG

3056
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
this game's awesome. Best game ever.

3057
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Five stars. Or,

3058
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
this game sucks balls. I'd give it zero

3059
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
stars if I could. I never played it, but I know

3060
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
it sucks. I wish sites like Amazon

3061
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
would allow filtering out

3062
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
of unverified user reviews.

3063
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
There it is. Comments

3064
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
from our Facebook and Google Plus pages.

3065
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Thank you guys. A very big

3066
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
variety. I was not expecting

3067
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
such a huge variety, but

3068
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
it's really all over the map. Some people saying

3069
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
nah. Some people saying yeah, I kind of do.

3070
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Especially a lot of people

3071
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
saying reviews

3072
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
can kind of give that

3073
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
second chance. I guess

3074
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
now in this day and age, I'm kind of

3075
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
on that team where I am looking at the

3076
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
streaming of the game to see if it's something I would like.

3077
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
That's what I did with Dragon Quest Heroes.

3078
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
I originally was like, eh, it's

3079
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
a side game. I don't think it's something I'm going to like.

3080
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
But then I watched some of the streams and I was like,

3081
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
well okay, I'll try it.

3082
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
So I got it.

3083
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Anyway, there you go.

3084
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Some of the answers

3085
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
from our Facebook and Google Plus communities.

3086
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Alan Alchemy saying

3087
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Amazon does have verified purchase

3088
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
on the top reviews. That's true,

3089
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
but I don't think they filter the star score

3090
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
by only the verified reviews.

3091
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
I don't think there's a way

3092
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
to do that. At least not that I know of.

3093
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
I think that might be what the listener was complaining about there.

3094
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Tigerclaw

3095
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
saying yeah, watching a Twitch stream

3096
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
of a game is a good way to see how the game is like

3097
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
and that will help you on your purchasing decision.

3098
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
I kind of agree. You have those resources

3099
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
out there. Whether it be Twitch, YouTube,

3100
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
whatever it is you use to look at the

3101
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
actual video from a game, I think

3102
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
is a great way to kind of know what you're getting into.

3103
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Alright, let's move on.

3104
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Back into some other news. Loki.

3105
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
So we kind of touched on this last week with

3106
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Overkill

3107
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
adding some microtransactions

3108
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
to Payday 2. Basically

3109
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
what they were doing originally is that

3110
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
they were starting to get the

3111
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
safe drops at the end of matches

3112
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
and so when you would get

3113
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
the safe, in order to

3114
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
get what was inside of it, which contained

3115
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
cosmetic items, many of which

3116
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
would actually add stat bonuses,

3117
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
you would actually have to pay real money

3118
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
for the drills. So you had to pay

3119
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
$2.50 to purchase a

3120
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
drill to open the safe.

3121
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
Well now, they're kind of

3122
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
stepping back a little bit

3123
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
instead of just having that be

3124
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
the only way you get drills.

3125
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
They're not really getting rid of the microtransactions

3126
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
but they're also going to start having

3127
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
drills drop as part of post

3128
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
match rewards as well.

3129
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
Because before

3130
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
it used to be the only way to get those would be

3131
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
to buy them.

3132
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
So now they're just going to drop as well.

3133
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
So you may not have to buy them, but it's still

3134
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
shit.

3135
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Yeah, not

3136
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
a lot of happy people out there with

3137
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
this whole thing, how this is

3138
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
panned out there with Payday.

3139
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Yeah, and the community doesn't seem to enjoy it too much

3140
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
based on what I've seen.

3141
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Well, if you don't like it, don't buy the

3142
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
game, that'll send a message. Do you think that'll

3143
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
actually happen or people just won't be able to resist?

3144
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
I think

3145
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
people can probably resist opening

3146
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
those.

3147
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
For $2.50 for just a random

3148
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
cosmetic item, I think that

3149
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
would be, that's not kind of worth it.

3150
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Yeah, but if the game doesn't sell well, that'll really tell

3151
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
them. I mean, 8,000 copies of your game

3152
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
sold is going to send a message. But I think that Payday

3153
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
sold more than 8,000 copies.

3154
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
I'm just saying. They re-released it so many times

3155
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
I think it's doing just fine.

3156
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Alright.

3157
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Well, we've

3158
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
been talking a lot about remakes tonight,

3159
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
reimaginings, and this is interesting.

3160
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
This is a

3161
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
story that's been floating around where

3162
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
Mega Man 3 is being

3163
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
remade by a fan in the Unreal

3164
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Engine 4. And I'm totally

3165
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
going to mispronounce this name, so I apologize.

3166
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
But, André

3167
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
de Jaeger, I hope I said that right.

3168
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
But he's been working on this, just

3169
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
toying around in Unreal

3170
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
excuse me,

3171
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
remaking Mega Man 3.

3172
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
And I gotta say, it looks great

3173
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
when you look. He's just got a little

3174
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
clip of the Gemini Man stage in

3175
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
this. I don't know where the music comes

3176
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
from. I don't know if he remade the music or if he's like

3177
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
using an overclocked mix or something. There's

3178
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
so many Mega Man fan mixes

3179
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
out there you can only imagine.

3180
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
But let me show, just to the folks in

3181
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
studio here, if I can

3182
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
if I can

3183
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
if it'll work.

3184
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
You can

3185
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
kind of see what that looks like there.

3186
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Looks great, huh?

3187
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
The background leaves

3188
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
a little bit to be desired, but yeah, the rest

3189
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
of it looks great. Yeah, and then you get into the segments

3190
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
like where it's all the colored blocks, like that looks really

3191
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
good, huh? Yeah, it is.

3192
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
So,

3193
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
I just, you know, again, I think there's a lot of

3194
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
people that would really like something like that.

3195
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
So,

3196
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
alright.

3197
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
I played it again.

3198
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Anyway, I don't know.

3199
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Here's the thing when it comes to remakes, especially like this.

3200
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
A lot of people that do like

3201
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
speed runs and things that perfect

3202
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
the game, kind of expect

3203
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
the game to run in certain

3204
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
ways. And when you remake a game like this,

3205
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
I'm not sure everything's gonna be down to the

3206
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
nanosecond, if that makes sense.

3207
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
And that can really bother some people, but I think

3208
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
if you're okay with that, I think this looks

3209
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
great. Like, you know,

3210
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
this is, this looks even

3211
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
better than Mighty No. 9, to be honest.

3212
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
And it's just one guy!

3213
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Just blows my mind how Capcom doesn't want

3214
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
to do anything like that.

3215
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
So.

3216
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
bonds006 in chat says, Jamie does not

3217
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
sound impressed.

3218
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
That's alright. Well, they did that sort of

3219
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
with Mega Man powered up

3220
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
M, I think that's what it was called,

3221
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
or Mega Man powered up, that was on PSP.

3222
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
Oh yeah, that looked really good, yeah.

3223
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
I mean, they did it in a weird art style

3224
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
where it's like giant head Mega Man, you know,

3225
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
but it was kind of

3226
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
like that. And how level editor was

3227
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
kind of cool. No love for that

3228
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
though, I mean, I don't understand why they'll do that

3229
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
for console. You know, somebody

3230
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
posted in my Facebook, I don't remember if it was

3231
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
Rama or Joe or somebody, but somebody posted

3232
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
my Facebook that somebody remade

3233
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
like Mega Man 1

3234
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
within Mario Maker.

3235
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
And they, now obviously it

3236
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
doesn't look exactly

3237
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
like Mega Man, but it's like a lot of the same

3238
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
elements they kind of put

3239
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
in Mario Maker, and I was really impressed, I

3240
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
gotta say. They did this whole YouTube where

3241
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
they used some remixed Mega

3242
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
Man themes kind of in the background to give it a little

3243
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
flair, and obviously they used the Mega Man

3244
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
amiibo as well. What? They didn't even make like

3245
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
the music, you know, with, you know, the

3246
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
the note blocks. That would have been

3247
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
a little complicated to do all of that.

3248
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
Nah, just kidding. I just thought that was really

3249
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
cool as well. There's so much

3250
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
fan love for Mega Man out there.

3251
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
It's just like, Capcom, make a new one.

3252
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
You never will, but alright.

3253
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Anyhow, Dark Saga.

3254
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Well,

3255
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
you know, we've

3256
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
talked about many different

3257
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
studios in the past and about them going to

3258
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
certain locations. This one

3259
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
is actually pretty cool because

3260
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
it kind of affects my old stomping grounds.

3261
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
And Exile is opening

3262
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
a new studio in

3263
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
New Orleans. They're the

3264
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
group that gave us

3265
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Bard's Tale 4, for example.

3266
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
But they are going to be

3267
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
opening up

3268
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
the studio. They're supposed to

3269
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
create about 50 new jobs over

3270
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
the next five years.

3271
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
So,

3272
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
they're basically going to be

3273
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
setting up there, trying to also

3274
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
have a long-term goal of creating

3275
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
110 new jobs

3276
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
in Louisiana itself.

3277
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
And,

3278
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
I just think it's

3279
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
good that they're looking to invest in the area,

3280
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
especially given that parts

3281
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
of the state are still recovering. I mean,

3282
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Katrina was a while back. Sure.

3283
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
But not everything is recovered. That's going to take

3284
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
a generation to recover from. Yeah.

3285
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
So, I think this is great.

3286
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
I think this is really good, and that means

3287
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
that, you know, folks that I know

3288
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
in the area, that's

3289
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
less distance

3290
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
that have to move to find work in the industry.

3291
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
Yeah. Good deal.

3292
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
It's always nice to hear about jobs being made

3293
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
as opposed to layoffs.

3294
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
So, Loki, what do you have for us?

3295
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Well, I have layoffs for you.

3296
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
God damn it, Loki.

3297
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
No, but anyways,

3298
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
Rovio, they've laid off

3299
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
213 people. God damn it, Loki.

3300
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Sorry.

3301
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
But it's fewer than

3302
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
what was originally announced, because they announced

3303
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
260, and that was back in August.

3304
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
But they're restructuring

3305
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
the company to focus on

3306
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
key areas like games media

3307
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
and consumer products.

3308
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
And of course, you know, they have the

3309
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Angry Birds movie coming out in

3310
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:14,000
May. So,

3311
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
yeah. The first round, I guess,

3312
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
you know, they

3313
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
laid off 110 employees back in

3314
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
December, and now this

3315
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
213 is going to be

3316
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
I think a reduction of about

3317
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
36% originally from their

3318
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
numbers that they were working with.

3319
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
That

3320
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
sucks, but, you know. It does, but how

3321
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
often have we seen this in the smartphone day

3322
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
and age where, you know, this company has their

3323
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
one breakthrough game, and then all of a

3324
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
sudden it's like they're bloated beyond control

3325
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
and then, oh, surprise,

3326
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:46,000
the future releases didn't

3327
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:48,000
catch on in the same way, so we have to

3328
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
lay everybody off. I mean, this has happened like time and time

3329
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:52,000
again, right? Yeah.

3330
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Is Zynga even still around at this point?

3331
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
Yeah, they are. Are they?

3332
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
What are they making these days? Is there

3333
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Farmville 3?

3334
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,000
I don't know. I don't know.

3335
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:04,000
But then, you know, Rovio has Angry Birds

3336
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,000
and I don't know. What else did they do?

3337
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Yep.

3338
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
And then there was

3339
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:12,000
the OMG Pop or whatever,

3340
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,000
the drawing game

3341
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
on the phone that was huge, and then Zynga

3342
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
bottom, and then nobody wanted to play it anymore.

3343
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
It's Candy Crush.

3344
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
And all the others. What else have they done?

3345
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
Soda Crush. Oh,

3346
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Candy Crush 2, Electric Boogaloo.

3347
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:28,000
What else? Yeah, and like other Crush

3348
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:30,000
games. Like, I have a coworker that plays

3349
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
that kind of stuff, and I'm like,

3350
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
what are you playing? And she's,

3351
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,000
I don't even know, it's like some

3352
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,000
game. And it's

3353
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
basically Candy Crush, but

3354
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
it just kind of proves, like, it's not Candy

3355
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Crush, it was just one of the other

3356
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,000
millions of those games out there.

3357
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Like, the market's so saturated with like, oh,

3358
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:50,000
hey, Candy Crush worked out

3359
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:52,000
really well, let's make a bunch of those.

3360
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
I start playing Brandy Lush.

3361
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
I just drink a lot.

3362
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
I'm playing like, you know, it's like Jewel Crush

3363
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
2, or, I don't know.

3364
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,000
It's...

3365
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:04,000
ActDeft in chat says

3366
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
crush all the things. Oh, be careful,

3367
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
I believe that word is trademarked.

3368
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
Patent pending. Copyright.

3369
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Anyhow.

3370
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Hey, some fun news

3371
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
out of the indie scene. Apparently,

3372
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
Goat Simulator and

3373
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
I Am Bread are

3374
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,000
combining forces for some

3375
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
crossover DLC. And there's

3376
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:28,000
actually a trailer that

3377
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
shows, through the power of love,

3378
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
a goat and bread

3379
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
going on a date together

3380
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
to...

3381
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
Goat Simulator will be

3382
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
getting a playable piece of bread,

3383
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
and I Am Bread is gonna get a mode called

3384
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Rampage. So these

3385
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
two games have literally gotten in bed

3386
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
together for DLC, but this is great.

3387
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
I don't like I Am Bread, but I Am Bread is so frustrating

3388
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
and hard that I don't like

3389
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
that game anymore. I am frustrated.

3390
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
I kinda wish...

3391
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
I'm glad Goat Simulator is getting more

3392
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
DLC. Please bring it to the console, because

3393
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
I can't purchase it on console.

3394
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
It doesn't run well on my PC, and that's

3395
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
my big problem. I would love to purchase

3396
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
your game. I like all the DLC and stuff.

3397
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
I can't, though, because you don't

3398
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
offer it. I have money

3399
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
in my hand. Gonna give it to you,

3400
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
but you're not letting me. And some bread. I have more bread,

3401
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
if that's what you want. You're not letting me.

3402
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
So, yeah.

3403
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
There you go.

3404
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
So, uh, congrats to those guys.

3405
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
That looks like it'll be fun.

3406
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
Alright, let's go to our

3407
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
mailbag!

3408
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Every week, Dark Soccer dives into our

3409
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
mailbag, and if you want to email us,

3410
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
participate at Orangelauntrader.com

3411
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
is how you can participate with the show.

3412
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
We had some good emails last week, um, so

3413
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
hopefully, this week can live up to it.

3414
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
We have two emails tonight, right, Dark Soccer?

3415
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Alright, let's get to it!

3416
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
Hello, LR. Please forgive me if I'm about to sound like

3417
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
a high and mighty bragging douche butt.

3418
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
But you are!

3419
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
I mean, let's, let's be, sorry, I don't even

3420
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
know who this is yet, or what it is, but

3421
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
anytime you're gonna say, sorry if I'm gonna do this butt,

3422
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
you're, I'm gonna do it. You are gonna be that.

3423
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
You are gonna do it. But it's okay! I like how this

3424
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
field says, I don't mean to sound racist, but

3425
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
yeah, you're racist.

3426
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
And, I, you know what, I'll,

3427
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
I have definitely been a whiny douche on this

3428
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
show, have we all, so, have your moment,

3429
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
emailer, have your moment. You know what,

3430
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
though, I think that the word douche is the best

3431
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
insult ever. Yeah? You know why?

3432
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
Why? Because, first of all, if you look at an

3433
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
actual douche...

3434
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
I'd rather not. Number one...

3435
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
Especially as a gay man, it's really not something

3436
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
I just, I have zero interest in it whatsoever.

3437
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
Number one... What?

3438
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
It's unnecessary. And number two,

3439
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
it actually can cause harm.

3440
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
That's the best insult ever.

3441
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Now I'll continue.

3442
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
I think

3443
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
I heard, I actually think I owe Becky

3444
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
rent on that one, because she

3445
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
mentioned that to me once. I see.

3446
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Pretty good. I don't,

3447
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
okay, I just don't understand why people make such a

3448
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
big deal about beating Contra on the

3449
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
default three lives.

3450
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
It's really, really not that difficult.

3451
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Compared to those NES games that are

3452
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
actually hard, like Ninja Gaiden

3453
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
or Battletoads or many others,

3454
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
I would say that anyone with at least some

3455
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
gaming skill could do it if they actually

3456
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
try. Personally, I can do it

3457
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
every time without continues.

3458
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Why aren't you special?

3459
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Hearts, YYR,

3460
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
hearts. Oh, it's YYR?

3461
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Yes. Sound the hipster alarm.

3462
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
Better grow that beard and put on some lumberjack

3463
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
clothes. That's right. I got some

3464
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
flannel for you. I've got some horn-rimmed glasses

3465
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
somewhere. Let's watch some Portlandia

3466
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
and listen to some indie bands. Listen to some vinyl.

3467
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
All you need are decent

3468
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
timing and reflexes, a bit of

3469
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
memorization, some knowledge

3470
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
of how the game works, for example, keeping

3471
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
in mind that random enemies can pop out

3472
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
along the ground at any time, and

3473
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
to get comfortable. People, stop

3474
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
messaging me while I'm reading the email.

3475
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
Seriously. Shut it off.

3476
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
No, it's the chat.

3477
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
The thing pops every time I get a message

3478
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
and it's freaking distracting.

3479
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
You need to turn that off.

3480
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
I can't, not with what I have.

3481
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Where was I? Okay.

3482
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
A hipster douche vinyl.

3483
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
And to get comfortable with the game's weapons.

3484
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Knowing where the best weapons are

3485
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
helps with quite a bit,

3486
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
but if you're decent at mashing the B button,

3487
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
you can get comfortable with the default weapon as well.

3488
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
And that can help even more.

3489
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
The game gives you a generous number of extra

3490
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
lives, and if you count those, you actually

3491
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
have closer to 10 by the end.

3492
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
And most of all, playing by yourself

3493
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
helps a lot too. You play with yourself

3494
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
and that helps. Do you play with

3495
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
yourself a lot, YPR?

3496
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
You might have thought otherwise, but not having

3497
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
to worry about keeping the same pace as

3498
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
your partner is a huge load off your shoulders.

3499
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Imagine playing with yourself as a huge load.

3500
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
Jamie!

3501
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:54,000
I can't help it.

3502
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
I'm in that mood tonight.

3503
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
It's not as much as you would think.

3504
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
With at least another partner, you normally get a

3505
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
huge load button.

3506
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
A little extra advice

3507
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
will... the whole point is to take off

3508
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:08,000
a huge load. He needs to get the huge load off.

3509
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,000
Please finish

3510
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:12,000
this damn email.

3511
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
That's kind of not really how it works, but okay.

3512
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:16,000
A little extra advice to...

3513
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Am I in the Horde house? What happened?

3514
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Josh! A little extra advice

3515
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
to anyone who wants to try.

3516
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
The R powerup is not a weapon.

3517
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
It makes the shots fired by your current weapon

3518
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
move faster. Every weapon has a maximum

3519
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
number of shots allowed on the screen at a time

3520
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
so the faster they're gone, the sooner you can

3521
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
fire more. The S plus R

3522
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
combination is in almost every way

3523
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
the best weapon in the game. In Stages 2

3524
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
and 4, don't forget that ducking makes you

3525
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
invincible against bullets

3526
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
and jumping is almost

3527
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
always a bad idea.

3528
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
Also in those levels, the round

3529
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
targets are mandatory, but all others are

3530
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
optional. Against the Stage 4 boss,

3531
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
any homing bubbles that appear

3532
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
would be your first priority, and the snowfield

3533
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
will move forward slowly and be ready

3534
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
to jump over the sudden turrets.

3535
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
And I think if you're playing single player

3536
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
if you push up on Player 2

3537
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
controller, you can hit

3538
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
the targets in the middle even if you're ducking

3539
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
if I remember correctly.

3540
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
When moving through Stage 8,

3541
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
stop moving forward as

3542
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
soon as you encounter the next mouth

3543
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
unless doing so is impossible.

3544
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
Destroying them when at a time will prevent

3545
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
you from being overwhelmed.

3546
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
When fighting the head or the

3547
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
heart, the distance between you and the target

3548
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
is so short that your shots

3549
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
disappear almost instantly, so the

3550
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
faster you can mash the buttons, the faster you can

3551
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
consider yourself a hero. Against

3552
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
the heart, make sure to take out the two

3553
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
pods on the floor first. Makes

3554
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
things much easier. I would encourage anyone

3555
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
to try Contra on 3 lives even if

3556
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
you never played it back then. Try it with

3557
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
30 lives first just to get the hang of it, then

3558
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
give it a shot. You're capable of more than you

3559
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
think. Then

3560
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
try the even more challenging

3561
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
sequel, Keep the Trigger Pulled

3562
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Aaron YYR.

3563
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
That Battle Toads is way harder

3564
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
than even

3565
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
you know, that Battle Toads was definitely

3566
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
controller breaking rage

3567
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
fury type of stuff and there

3568
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
was no 30 lives code in that game so

3569
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
you were just fucked if you

3570
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
couldn't get the pattern down.

3571
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Ninja Gaiden was really, I own Ninja

3572
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Gaiden and I don't think I ever beat it.

3573
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
I could only get like to like the next

3574
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
to last stage I think was as far as I could get.

3575
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
It was, it was

3576
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
brutal. Yes.

3577
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
So last email? Yep.

3578
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
This comes from Rissimo.

3579
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
Hi there. I just wanted to say

3580
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
thanks to all three of you for giving me such

3581
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
great ear candy over the years.

3582
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
I found OLR by reading Joystick

3583
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
Mini Moons ago. It was the

3584
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
infamous Katamari tobacco.

3585
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
Oh, I don't know what

3586
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
you're talking about. What Katamari

3587
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
tobacco?

3588
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
I have heard every single episode

3589
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
since then. I never get to listen

3590
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
live so I

3591
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
used to download the episodes from Loki's PSP

3592
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
portal and followed you to Justin TV

3593
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
and now I stream Epps from Stitcher.

3594
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
I've gotten many friends to listen

3595
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
since then and they love you just as

3596
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
well. Thanks again for your dedication and

3597
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
I hope you continue to bless us with your banter

3598
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
for many more years.

3599
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Aww, thank you. That's, no question

3600
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
or anything. That's it? Just a

3601
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
I just called to say I love you?

3602
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
I just called to say

3603
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
I love

3604
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
OLR.

3605
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
Aww, I'm feeling warm and fuzzy now.

3606
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
That's great. Thank you. It was like a little

3607
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
e-hug. I appreciate that. You feel all squishy.

3608
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
And then I'm thinking in my mind

3609
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
how long ago was that Katamari thing?

3610
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
Wasn't that like 2007 when that happened?

3611
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Or 2008? I don't even remember. It was a long time ago.

3612
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
It was ages ago.

3613
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Joystick's been closed for a while now

3614
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
so not that long I guess in retrospect.

3615
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
Let's take a look, shall we?

3616
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
So

3617
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
I think, I want to say it was like 2008?

3618
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
I could be

3619
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
wrong. It was sometime

3620
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
long ago

3621
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
in a galaxy far, far away.

3622
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
Still, that would have been just like

3623
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
that's still like

3624
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
seven years ago. That person's been listening for seven years.

3625
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
Supposedly every week. I'm sorry.

3626
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
Wow, I know that. I feel like there's

3627
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
a long list of things I should apologize for you. March 16, 2007.

3628
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
2007!

3629
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
Thank you, Wikipedia.

3630
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
We're actually a part of a beautiful Katamari Wikipedia page.

3631
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
Are we really?

3632
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
We are. Oh my god.

3633
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Why?

3634
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
We don't even have our own Wikipedia

3635
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
article anymore. Yep, we're under

3636
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
PlayStation 3 and Wii development.

3637
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
A March 16, 2007 post at

3638
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Orange Launch Radio reported that Namco Bandai

3639
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
announced beautiful Katamari to retailers.

3640
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
Well, I was like,

3641
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Namco Bandai didn't announce it.

3642
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
That was, but okay.

3643
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
But they did,

3644
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
that's how we had discovered it was through the retail channels.

3645
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Yes, that is correct.

3646
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
So

3647
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
there was a PlayStation 3 version, okay.

3648
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
But we don't, for some reason, we don't have

3649
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
our own Wikipedia article anymore.

3650
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Because some douche figured

3651
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
that we didn't need one. Even though

3652
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
we won, and you know, whatever, I'm just

3653
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
saying, I'm just saying, we won

3654
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
the very first podcast award.

3655
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
We are the longest running video

3656
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
game podcast that exists, period.

3657
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
If there was another

3658
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
one, we would know of it by now. There's others

3659
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
that have been running a very long time, ten plus

3660
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
years, and many kudos to them, but

3661
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
we are the longest, for what it's worth.

3662
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
Let's see, what else? What else

3663
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
makes this notable? I guess that's it.

3664
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Me. You.

3665
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
Me.

3666
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
We're also part of the

3667
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
guitar hero encore rock the 80s.

3668
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
What?

3669
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
Wikipedia page.

3670
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
How? Did we break the news on that or something?

3671
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
I don't even remember.

3672
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
That was a long time ago.

3673
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
We do have a link as well

3674
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
on Takeo

3675
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Mitsumiro,

3676
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Muratsu.

3677
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Is that the dude who

3678
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
is OrangeLounge?

3679
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
Under his, like, name, maybe?

3680
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
I don't know. I'm just

3681
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
going in, something about Jumping

3682
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
Flash 2.

3683
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Let's take a look here.

3684
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
That's cool

3685
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
if we're cited in Jumping Flash 2, I

3686
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
guess. How does that work?

3687
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
Jumping Flash 2 is a great game.

3688
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
They linked to

3689
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Tetsuya, posted something, I guess.

3690
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
Huh.

3691
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
It's an article

3692
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
on our, or it was an

3693
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
article. It's not linked there anymore

3694
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
for some reason. Wow.

3695
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
Oh, yeah. As 200 Matt says, the VOG Network

3696
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
was also mentioned in the Disney Infinity Wiki

3697
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
at one point. That's right, because the

3698
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
E3 thing got the price point for those figures.

3699
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
There's a post of us on Dailymotion

3700
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
doing what?

3701
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
It was actually going back to when we were

3702
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
on the news about podcasting.

3703
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
Oh, God.

3704
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Was that the one where, was that the clip with Loki?

3705
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Oh, it's so much fun.

3706
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
KCRA, yeah. Oh, yeah.

3707
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
With an old-ass iPod.

3708
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
Yes.

3709
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
That was before iPhones, wasn't it?

3710
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
That clip was before the iPhone,

3711
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
if I'm not mistaken.

3712
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Yup.

3713
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
I think you guys,

3714
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
I think we should

3715
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
do that clip.

3716
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
How long has it been since we

3717
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
played this clip? No.

3718
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
Yes, I think the whole conversation

3719
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
with them, that's what they picked.

3720
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
No, we're right after a shooting.

3721
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
It's

3722
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
9 years old. This story is 9 years

3723
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
old from July of 2005.

3724
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
No, this is,

3725
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
oh my God, it's over 10 years old at this point.

3726
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
The governor

3727
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
is one of the many people joining the

3728
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
podcasting craze.

3729
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
It's becoming a web craze.

3730
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

3731
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
Brian Hickey tonight shows us how

3732
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
people are using podcasting to

3733
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
inform, entertain, and share their thoughts

3734
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
with the world.

3735
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Apparently your thought is only 10 seconds

3736
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
known.

3737
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
It's called Dance Dance Revolution, or DDR, a popular

3738
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
game that has a fanatic following.

3739
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
It started off tiny and it's

3740
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
grown. Oh my gosh.

3741
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
I hate hearing

3742
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
myself. That's phrasing.

3743
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
That's you talking about the prior email.

3744
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Phrasing.

3745
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
Check out also

3746
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
the gigantic HDTV I used

3747
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
to have. This is the place I lived

3748
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
with the extra for a moment.

3749
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
Hello everybody

3750
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
once again.

3751
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Welcome to another episode

3752
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
of our podcast.

3753
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
From their apartment in Rancho Cordova using

3754
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Revolution... We didn't all live together.

3755
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
Just from their apartment.

3756
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
We didn't all live together. Can you imagine

3757
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
if all three of us, I mean I guess Loki and I

3758
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
lived together for a while. We made it work.

3759
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
Where would I put Dan?

3760
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
And look how young we all are. I'm like

3761
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
oh my god I had so much hair.

3762
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Girl.

3763
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
Oh my god that was

3764
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
the old

3765
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
We basically give the news for video games

3766
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
popular culture.

3767
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Basically what gamers really want to know.

3768
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
Oh my god.

3769
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
The developers record their programs

3770
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
then send them to a number of websites

3771
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
now hosting the shows.

3772
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
Now anyone can create, edit and

3773
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
air their ideas, concerns, music

3774
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
and all things audio to anyone

3775
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
else willing to download it.

3776
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
It's a much

3777
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
more flexible way of

3778
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
spreading the information. With nothing

3779
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
more than an MP3 player and a set of headphones

3780
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
you can listen to it anywhere.

3781
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
Now people can talk about

3782
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
things they like to talk about

3783
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
other people can join in

3784
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
and listen to and it's really open

3785
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
and lots of people can get into it.

3786
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
I love how they just interviewed

3787
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
some dude with an iPod and it was

3788
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
like iPod owner. That was actually

3789
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
the little thing that said it was an iPod

3790
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
owner. A number of websites are now

3791
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
hosting the podcast for free.

3792
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
The newest and biggest database to adopt

3793
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
the technology is Apple's iTunes.

3794
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
You just click on the podcast

3795
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
tab, type a topic in the search

3796
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
feature and a list of available

3797
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
podcasts are at your fingertips.

3798
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
Free for you, free for the producers,

3799
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
free speech for everyone.

3800
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
It's so much fun.

3801
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
It's great that you know just anybody out there

3802
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
who really has a desire to want to be heard

3803
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
you have an outlet for your voice to get out there

3804
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
so podcasting is just wonderful.

3805
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
Ian Rancho Cordova, Brian Hickey

3806
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
KCRA 3 reports.

3807
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
Yeah fuck that.

3808
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
Recently Governor Schwarzenegger began providing

3809
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
his weekly radio. Yes everybody

3810
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
reminder, he really was the governor.

3811
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
That actually happened.

3812
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
He really was the governor of California.

3813
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
The goobernator.

3814
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
As a podcast it can be

3815
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
downloaded so you can listen to it

3816
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
in your car as you walk or even as you're

3817
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
pumping iron in the gym.

3818
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
Oh news.

3819
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
Oops I almost started it over again. Sorry about that.

3820
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
There we go. That's a clip from my KCRA

3821
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
bootleg there

3822
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
from our YouTube channel.

3823
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
By the way I also want to point out

3824
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
in that story did you notice

3825
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
even though they had all of us

3826
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
sort of in that interview

3827
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
they never said the name of the show.

3828
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
They never said it was called

3829
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
Orange Lawns Radio ever in that entire clip.

3830
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
They show a picture of it

3831
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
when he's talking about oh iTunes has it

3832
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
they show a picture of him subscribing to it

3833
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
in iTunes with the really old

3834
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
art like

3835
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
even the one before the one

3836
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
you did I mean it was really old.

3837
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
We were in the four corners

3838
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
I was in one corner

3839
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
the chakra was in one corner Loki was in one corner

3840
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
and then the fourth corner was the ferret.

3841
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
And SSA 100 Matt says Loki's field

3842
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
gypped from his five minutes of fame. No that's not the only time

3843
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
I've been on the news. We also did a guitar

3844
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
hero thing. I wasn't on that.

3845
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
I gave an honest opinion about

3846
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
like on a scale of 1 to 10

3847
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
how do you rate them. It's about like an 8 or 9

3848
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
and then Miss

3849
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
Miss One Up here has to go it's an

3850
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
11.

3851
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
Fuck that shit.

3852
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
Say thanks.

3853
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
I was looking.

3854
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
It's a million.

3855
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
It's a million.

3856
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
I was looking

3857
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
just looking for

3858
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
orange on radio and wiki and found

3859
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
my page on the Wikipedia

3860
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
and I don't ever remember saying this

3861
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
but it does sound like something I'd say.

3862
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
I'm controlling the apocalypse.

3863
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
You're all fucked.

3864
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
Wait but that wasn't on Wikipedia

3865
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
that's the orange on radio. On our wiki.

3866
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
Yeah so I haven't read my page.

3867
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
That's a separate thing that the which

3868
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
honestly I don't even know how to edit it.

3869
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
I think maybe I changed one thing on there

3870
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
one time but that's been like a group

3871
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
of like three or four people that still

3872
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
still keep that like classic game

3873
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
list up to date and I think the list list gets

3874
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
updated every time we do that game. Oh my god it's my

3875
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
old MySpace page.

3876
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
I didn't even think this existed anymore.

3877
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
Wait you still have a MySpace page? Apparently I do.

3878
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
There is a link to your MySpace

3879
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
on the Wikipedia. Oh my god.

3880
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
What song

3881
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
is auto playing in the background?

3882
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
Oh my god.

3883
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
Dark Saga is horrified.

3884
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
I would like to read my quotes from the page.

3885
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
Oh yes what's that?

3886
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
It says um

3887
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
I can't for the life of me

3888
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
get the hooker to have sex with me.

3889
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
I remember that. That was you talking

3890
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
about like Grand Theft Auto or something.

3891
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
Of course it's so much fun.

3892
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Ow my foot why'd I shoot myself

3893
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
in the foot oh my god it hurt so bad.

3894
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
Yes that was you

3895
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
being you were a game company

3896
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
talking about something.

3897
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
I don't remember what I was talking about.

3898
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
Bomb Burger.

3899
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
Wait hold on

3900
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
because I actually I actually

3901
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
have this

3902
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
clip.

3903
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
God damn.

3904
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
Ow my foot.

3905
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
Why did I shoot myself in my foot?

3906
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Oh my god it hurt so bad.

3907
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Oh my god my

3908
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
No I need

3909
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
that for walking.

3910
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
Wait and I have this other one it says Loki on

3911
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
babies. I'm a little worried.

3912
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
What this

3913
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
could be. Somebody once told me

3914
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
what having a baby felt like.

3915
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
Giving birth sucks and I'm never going to do it.

3916
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
It's why they cut open your stomach and

3917
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
pull the damn kid out. It's just like what the hell

3918
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
is the point? It's like trying to shove a piano

3919
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
through a door when there's a perfectly good

3920
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
window right there.

3921
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
I mean

3922
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
I don't see the point.

3923
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
And that's why

3924
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
men will never have babies.

3925
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
The genius of Loki on Orange Lums

3926
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
Radio. I don't even remember what the hell

3927
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
that was in regards to.

3928
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
And then we were talking about

3929
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
the Mega Man 2 jingle thing that they

3930
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
had like an app where you can

3931
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
whenever you click an icon

3932
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
do the Mega Man 2 jingle and it's like

3933
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
hamburger and then

3934
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
mailman.

3935
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
In the early days of apps or anything

3936
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
gaming related.

3937
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
That's kind of a

3938
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
lame list. I've said more interesting things

3939
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
since then.

3940
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
For the record I would like to point out

3941
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
that I have birthed no children.

3942
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
Just saying.

3943
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Alright.

3944
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
I don't even know

3945
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
how we got on that tangent. Oh it was the

3946
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
love letter. Just sent us down memory lane

3947
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
so thank you for that. You even get

3948
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
to hear clips from before you were even listening

3949
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
probably recently so there you go.

3950
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
Alright. Thank you for your emails.

3951
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000

3953
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
emails as well. Let's

3954
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
now take this opportunity to get into

3955
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
the FUs of the week.

3956
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:59,000
FU to

3957
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:01,000
medical issues.

3958
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:03,000
That's it. I'll leave it there.

3959
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:05,000
There's so many things I don't even

3960
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
remember on this thing like bucket rolled.

3961
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
Anyways.

3962
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
I guess FU to just being really

3963
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
tired and not having a chance to work on

3964
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
my costume because I'm worried that I'm gonna run out of time

3965
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,000
very fast. So

3966
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
I need to start tonight.

3967
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
I gotta cut something tonight.

3968
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
For the costume.

3969
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
My FU of the week goes

3970
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:27,000
to those delicious

3971
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,000
pumpkin cinnamon rolls that

3972
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:31,000
Jamie brought to the show tonight because they were so

3973
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
Trader Joe's. They were so freaking

3974
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:35,000
good but now I just feel so fat

3975
02:31:35,000 --> 02:31:37,000
after having eaten two of them.

3976
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
I'm having eater's remorse.

3977
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
Oh well.

3978
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
There it is.

3979
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
The FUs of the week.

3980
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
Yep. In fact they already have episode six

3981
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
nineteen classic game of the week already

3982
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
in there so. They're

3983
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
good. What can I say? They're fast. They are

3984
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
fast. Alright.

3985
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
Let's get to it. Don't you have to put

3986
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
a spoiler alert on it though because the podcast doesn't

3987
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
no I'm just kidding. Oh I didn't say what it was.

3988
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
I just said it was there. I'm just. No I'm

3989
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
on the wiki. It's fine. Alright.

3990
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
Just a couple more stories for you guys then the

3991
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
phone calls one eight seven seven

3992
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
game OLR or username on Skype

3993
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

3994
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
All one word. Let's do these last

3995
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
couple stories. Loki. So someone decided

3996
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
to make a Zelda maker on

3997
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
PC. Of course this is not officially

3998
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
endorsed by Nintendo.

3999
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
It is kind of cool to check out. They do

4000
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
have an alpha release you can

4001
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
download and make some levels

4002
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
for. I

4003
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
I don't know. It looked interesting

4004
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
and I kind of watched the video of it.

4005
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
I think this is going to get

4006
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
taken down before you know it. Yeah now that

4007
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
it's on all these new sites Nintendo's

4008
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
lawyers will be at work Monday morning

4009
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
which I hate to say but it's true. You guys all

4010
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
know it's true. Yeah so

4011
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
if you check it out

4012
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
looking to see where the download is for that

4013
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
basically

4014
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
if you look for user dream mix

4015
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
on YouTube there's a link of

4016
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
one of the videos they have legends all that maker

4017
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
Alpha zero point zero

4018
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
one release and you can go download it

4019
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
so it looks interesting.

4020
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
Yeah it looks it's again

4021
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
it's very interesting what a small little independent

4022
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
group can accomplish.

4023
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
So strange to me how

4024
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
they can do that. But anyway

4025
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
I mean sorry it's

4026
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
it's not strange to me they can do it but

4027
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
it's strange how it's

4028
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
this small little team can do it yet you

4029
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
know when it comes to a big company they're

4030
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
they're pressed for resources and so forth

4031
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
it's just I don't know it just

4032
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
blows my mind sometimes.

4033
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
Anyhow

4034
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
lastly before we get to the Skype

4035
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
line this is the story

4036
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
I'm sure you've all been waiting for

4037
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
in fact actually

4038
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
is more when I heard it was one of those things where

4039
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
gosh this didn't already happen

4040
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
Hideo Kojima

4041
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
has officially parted ways with

4042
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
Konami in fact it happened

4043
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
on October 9th and due to a

4044
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
clause apparently in the

4045
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
parting arrangement there he's

4046
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
not allowed to work again until December

4047
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
there was allegedly

4048
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
some type of cheerful but emotional

4049
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
goodbye departure ceremony that about

4050
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
100 people went to and

4051
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
Hideo Kojima did not comment on

4052
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
this because of a legally binding agreement

4053
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
with the former employer

4054
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
but this is where things got really fucking weird

4055
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
because Kojima can't

4056
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
comment but Konami did

4057
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
after the New Yorker ran that piece about

4058
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
Hideo Kojima and

4059
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
Konami decided to reply on

4060
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
Tokyo Sports which got translated

4061
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
saying that Kojima

4062
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
is still an employee of Konami he's

4063
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
just on vacation

4064
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
currently Kojima is listed as a

4065
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
company employee at Konami

4066
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
currently Kojima and the development team are finished

4067
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
developing Metal Gear Solid 5 and taking

4068
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
a long time off from work because the

4069
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
development time for console games is so long and fatigue

4070
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
builds up it's common for employees to

4071
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
take extended periods of time off when

4072
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
development is finished

4073
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
so would that vacation

4074
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
be up in say I don't know December?

4075
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:02,000
We'll see

4076
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
Tigerclaw in chat says maybe

4077
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
something got lost in the translation

4078
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
you know here's the thing

4079
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
Konami's PR stuff

4080
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
is in the goddamn toilet right now

4081
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
and if

4082
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
this hadn't happened after what

4083
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
has been an actual comedy

4084
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
of errors one after another

4085
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
coming out of Konami then

4086
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
I would probably go okay there is

4087
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
probably some type of miscommunication going on

4088
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
and you know something weird is going on

4089
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
but after everything

4090
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
that's come out of Konami over the past

4091
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
year between the PT debacle

4092
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
and the removal

4093
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
and the fact that nothing's coming out except

4094
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
for mobile and pachinko

4095
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
and all this stuff it's like okay

4096
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
Konami needs

4097
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
like

4098
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
they need more than PR they need

4099
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
CPR at this point they need a

4100
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
lot of help getting their image

4101
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
back up and I don't even know if it's recoverable

4102
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
at this point and so yeah when I

4103
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
hear that Kojima's left Konami

4104
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
I kind of tend to believe it because there's

4105
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
that big part of me that's like that didn't already

4106
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
happen

4107
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
SSG-100 Matt

4108
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
says how stupid do they think we are

4109
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
just stop Konami

4110
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
Akdev says we're still together guys we're definitely not lying

4111
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
and Dark Tetsuya says

4112
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Konami go home you're drunk

4113
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
I think that's the most succinct way

4114
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
to put it it's kind of it's

4115
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
it's not kind of sad it's very sad

4116
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
but it is what it is

4117
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
sounds like

4118
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
one too many egos kind of drove that company

4119
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
into the ground and it will never be

4120
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
the company that brought us double

4121
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
dribble anymore

4122
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
anyhow on that note I should probably open

4123
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
up the Skype line I didn't even have Skype open

4124
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
yet like I actually don't even have the application

4125
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
open since Bobby was not

4126
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
on tonight we didn't do the call

4127
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
before OLR so I don't even have the

4128
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
application open I'm trying to launch it right now

4129
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
but it's taking

4130
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
it forever so I'm going to ask Loki

4131
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
if he has any last minute stories while I try to get

4132
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
Skype up and running my wife wants me to build

4133
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
a catio for my cat

4134
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
I think you should do it

4135
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
I want one for Midna well like here's the thing

4136
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
it's like yeah it's basically like an outdoor space

4137
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
she already has the garage I already put a fucking

4138
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
door in our garage door so she can

4139
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
go out in the garage and she's

4140
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
been hanging out in there now she wants

4141
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
to go outside I mean I could do that

4142
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
but like

4143
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
I'm going to be

4144
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
spending money to build this thing that's a

4145
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
fucking monstrosity for this cat

4146
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
and the cat won't appreciate it

4147
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
I mean you just kind of know

4148
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
in the back of your head the cat would never use it

4149
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
no the cat would use it she'd love

4150
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
she loves outdoors in fact but she's just

4151
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
scared like the other day like we had

4152
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
a Comcast over and I told

4153
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
him like it's cool

4154
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
oh no not Comcast it was

4155
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
the air conditioning guy he was over to

4156
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
kind of check the system for the you know the

4157
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
heater and everything and

4158
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
I told him like yeah it's cool you

4159
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
can go out the back but just make sure you close the door

4160
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
because the cat you know will get out

4161
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
oh she's scared of outside but just make sure

4162
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
you close it because I don't want the door open so

4163
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
he leaves and leaves the fucking door open when

4164
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
he leaves and so I come out there

4165
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
to go close the door and I

4166
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
was seeing the cat walking around

4167
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
alright let's get to the phones I finally

4168
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000

02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
iphone without the phone because that

4201
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000

fucking super gun course so I could get super guns

4226
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
and there were people in that

4227
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
fucking course and dude it's super guns man

4228
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
like you guys are from America so you don't

4229
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
own guns you know

4230
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
I don't own a gun shit like the big

4231
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
game guns

4232
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
you know I'm talking your big bolt action

4233
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
Winchester's and shit yeah I did not know

4234
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
there was such a thing as a super gun

4235
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
but I'm just gonna assume

4236
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
I thought super guns were for playing video games

4237
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:36,000
that's a really big gun

4238
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:38,000
and then you can get a gun

4239
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
I saw women in this class man that

4240
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
there's no way they can hold a gun and shoot it

4241
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
and they get to go buy them now

4242
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
well now now now aim

4243
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
knows no gender

4244
02:40:48,000 --> 02:40:50,000
no physics don't know no gender

4245
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
either man fucking gravity works the same

4246
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
everyday all the time the same

4247
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
no days off man

4248
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,000
Dungeon Buster in chat

4249
02:40:58,000 --> 02:41:00,000
says super gun is that the one

4250
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
Saddam had you know those weapons of mass

4251
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
destruction I don't know I somehow

4252
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
don't think Canada would have them if

4253
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
that were the case actually if you want to have some

4254
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
historical facts for you that in the

4255
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
1980s when Iraq was

4256
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
still considered an ally

4257
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
of the United States there was a Canadian man

4258
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
a Canadian man doctor

4259
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
fuck I don't know Fongoli whatever but he was

4260
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Canadian and he was building the fucking

4261
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
super gun in Iraq it was just a

4262
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
big rifle big fucking

4263
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
bullets essentially they said they took the

4264
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
Canadian the genius of the Canadian and they

4265
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
gave him the unlimited wealth of the

4266
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000
American Federal Trade Bank thingy

4267
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000
whatever it's called and then the

4268
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
fucking this is really racist but it's true

4269
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
the Israelis didn't like it so they killed

4270
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
them

4271
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
we never got to see the fucking super Canadian

4272
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
gun all we get all we get is the

4273
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
fucking gay little jerk off arm in

4274
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
space that jerks off the space shuttle

4275
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
watch it watch it

4276
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
you don't have to make a space shuttle just

4277
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
fucking jerk it off now hold on hold on

4278
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
because this is the

4279
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
thing is that you guys in Canada

4280
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
know how to build big guns

4281
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
so is all your politeness and all that

4282
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000

are lining up to move to Canada

4300
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:42,000

02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:54,000
be in power for the next 20 years

4307
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
all right anyway what did you call

4308
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
you did not call in to talk about guns or politics

4309
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
what you want to talk about tonight

4310
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:02,000

4312
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:06,000

4313
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,000
games at all dude yeah I was just playing

4314
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:10,000
check it out man I was just playing

4315
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:12,000
some Grand Theft Auto I'm like oh that's

4316
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,000
cool you can't really see it on

4317
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
the screen over here and I was actually

4318
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
calling to ask if there's any players out

4319
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:20,000
there that would like to play Grand Theft Auto with me

4320
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,000
on the Xbox

4321
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:24,000
360 my name is Jim Salley also at

4322
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:26,000
Xbox is there a way for people

4323
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:28,000
to just give me money in

4324
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,000
Grand Theft Auto 5 Loki can

4325
02:43:30,000 --> 02:43:32,000
you give Jim Salley money

4326
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
I think there's

4327
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:36,000
maybe a way to do that

4328
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:38,000
most likely

4329
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:40,000
you would have to just like

4330
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:42,000
I don't know

4331
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
it'd be an agreement with somebody to like

4332
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:46,000
put a bounty on them well actually

4333
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:48,000
no that wouldn't work either cause you

4334
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
lose half the money then right

4335
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
yeah I don't know if there's a way to give money

4336
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
you

4337
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:56,000
normally can't like you can

4338
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
throw bets maybe

4339
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:00,000
you can throw bets for

4340
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:02,000
you know like different races or something

4341
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:04,000
like that just bet a bunch of money and then have someone

4342
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,000
win I mean that's one way to do it

4343
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:08,000
I think there's a way to also like after missions

4344
02:44:08,000 --> 02:44:10,000
you are able to split up

4345
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
the

4346
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:14,000
taking from that and you're supposed to be able to give

4347
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
extra money but I think they cut out a lot of

4348
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
that too because people are using that to

4349
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
when they're modding the game they would cheat that

4350
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
way and you know give millions of dollars

4351
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
I don't know

4352
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
I don't remember if I have much money in the Xbox

4353
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:28,000
360 version anymore

4354
02:44:28,000 --> 02:44:30,000
there's

4355
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
gotta be someone out there that can help me out

4356
02:44:32,000 --> 02:44:34,000
and listen Jim Sally

4357
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
needs your help everybody you need to help him out

4358
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
if you know the answer shout it out and chat

4359
02:44:38,000 --> 02:44:40,000
I mean Rockstar's answer is gonna be just buy

4360
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:42,000
the fucking shark cards but

4361
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
yeah

4362
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:46,000
exactly

4363
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
that's how I feel as well

4364
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:50,000
so now I'm gonna get onto the phone just do missions

4365
02:44:50,000 --> 02:44:52,000

4366
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
gang stuff I don't know it's been

4367
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:56,000
a while since I played that alright

4368
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:58,000
I thought you played the Grand Theft Auto everyday guy

4369
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:00,000
weren't you the Grand Theft Auto officer?

4370
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:02,000
I haven't played it in like almost a year

4371
02:45:02,000 --> 02:45:04,000

02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
wanted to show you I did such a good job on my gun

02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
course I may be the first Canadian ever

4375
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:12,000
outside of the military to get

4376
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:14,000
perfect scores on every single gun exam all the

4377
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:16,000
way through to all the different levels and stuff

4378
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:18,000
they put me on the cover of

4379
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,000
the hunting manual for the

4380
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
entire province wanna see it?

4381
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:24,000

I got it right here hold on a second

4383
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:28,000
even though this is radio I will do my

4384
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,000
best to describe it to everybody so we're

4385
02:45:30,000 --> 02:45:32,000

4386
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000

4387
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
orange you are covered in orange

4388
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
and he's pointing at the ground going

4389
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,000
hey

4390
02:45:40,000 --> 02:45:42,000
why am I pointing at the cover?

4391
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
yeah my gun is pointed

4392
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,000
at the heavens

4393
02:45:46,000 --> 02:45:48,000
but I see a bear

4394
02:45:48,000 --> 02:45:50,000
you point your gun to Jesus so you don't shoot nobody

4395
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:52,000
but for my students

4396
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,000
point that gun to Jesus

4397
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:56,000
see so I say point

4398
02:45:56,000 --> 02:45:58,000
the gun to Jesus

4399
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:00,000
and look I say look see

4400
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000

4414
02:46:30,000 --> 02:46:32,000
that's the final course

4415
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:34,000
bye Jim Sally thanks for the call

4416
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:36,000
always a pleasure to hear

4417
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,000
from Jim Sally here at Orange

4418
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:40,000
Lounge radio

4419
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:42,000
playing some Grand Theft Auto

4420
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:44,000
he did have it running on the TV

4421
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
he might have been doing that multitasking thing

4422
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
I need to go back and play

4423
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:50,000
it's been a while but you know

4424
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:52,000
Jim Sally needs a friend do it for Jim Sally

4425
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:54,000
do it

4426
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:56,000
I can go back and play it on 360

4427
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
I think I still have it on 360

4428
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:00,000
I have to double check

4429
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
I don't think I sold it

4430
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:04,000
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype

4431
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
Orange Lounge Radio all one word if you want to give us a call

4432
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
Skype line is open

4433
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
if you didn't figure it out from that last call

4434
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:12,000
Loki while we wait is there any other

4435
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
last minute stories you want to get out here?

4436
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:16,000
uhhhh

4437
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:18,000
nope I don't have anything

4438
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:20,000
alrighty then

4439
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
well then

4440
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
this is the last

4441
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:26,000
call for calls over at 1877 Game OLR

4442
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,000
username on Skype Orange Lounge

4443
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:30,000
Radio if no one else is going to

4444
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
call then I guess we're going to be wrapping things

4445
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:34,000
up here I was looking at some

4446
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:36,000
comments in our chat over at live.vognetwork.com

4447
02:47:36,000 --> 02:47:38,000
chat room always lights

4448
02:47:38,000 --> 02:47:40,000
up during a uhhh

4449
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
we had that Twitter poll

4450
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
that kind of ended up getting on my Twitter

4451
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
traffic but I'll look here real quick

4452
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
actdeft is mentioning in chat

4453
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,000
them's fightin' herds got funded

4454
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,000
that was the game he called in to talk about last week

4455
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:54,000
but they had hit their funding

4456
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:56,000
point at that point

4457
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:58,000
but they were in that last push to hit some stretch goals

4458
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,000
and I think they got a couple of them after all

4459
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
so congrats

4460
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:04,000
ummm

4461
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:06,000
let's see

4462
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:08,000
I was looking at some tweets over at

4463
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:10,000
twitter.com slash OLR

4464
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
um at James Nighthawk

4465
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:14,000
was thanking Dark Soccer for reading the email

4466
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:16,000
on OLR last week

4467
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:18,000
glad to hear you're a fellow fan of good grammar

4468
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:20,000
in emails too

4469
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:22,000
not only is she a fan, she demands it

4470
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
it's an expectation, it has to happen

4471
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:26,000
that's right

4472
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:28,000
YYR at the end of the show last week

4473
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,000
was letting us know about a massive

4474
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
Dragon Age sale on Xbox

4475
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:34,000
I mean obviously this is over by now

4476
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:36,000
but I'll just mention Inquisition was 20 bucks

4477
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:38,000
Dragon Age 2 5, Origins 3 74

4478
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
don't know if I love it

4479
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
where should I start?

4480
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:44,000
where should somebody start with the Dragon Age series if they want to get into it

4481
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:46,000
I think they should just go to Inquisition at this point

4482
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:48,000
myself

4483
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:50,000
you can start

4484
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:52,000
Inquisition without knowing much in the background

4485
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:54,000
but you would probably

4486
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:56,000
have it start off with whatever the

4487
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
default official canon is

4488
02:48:58,000 --> 02:49:00,000
however

4489
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:02,000
if you really

4490
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:04,000
do want the story beginning to end

4491
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
you have to go Origins, DA2

4492
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
I mean

4493
02:49:08,000 --> 02:49:10,000
Awakenings is a good one

4494
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
I actually

4495
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
I'd say in order of my favorite

4496
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,000
games I would go Inquisition, DA2

4497
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:18,000
Origins, and then Awakening

4498
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
I'm actually one of those people

4499
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
who is not the biggest fan of the first Dragon Age

4500
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:24,000
except for Alistair

4501
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:26,000
but there was a lot of people that didn't like

4502
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:28,000
Dragon Age 2

4503
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
I love Dragon Age 2, I freaking think it's fun

4504
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:32,000
fair enough

4505
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:34,000
I would say

4506
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
just having been in similar shoes

4507
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:38,000
you're totally ok starting Inquisition without

4508
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
having necessarily played everything

4509
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
else, so it's fine

4510
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:44,000
and in fact I think the battle

4511
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
system is a lot more accessible

4512
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:48,000
I think playing the old games to get

4513
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:50,000
through the story can be a bit of a

4514
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:52,000
slog

4515
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
it is a good story if you can tolerate it

4516
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:56,000
but it's kind of like Mass Effect

4517
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
the best Mass Effect game

4518
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:00,000
is

4519
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
I say it's tied between 2 and 3

4520
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
but 2 really is

4521
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
the peak of the series, but I think 3

4522
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
is much better than a lot of people give it credit for

4523
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,000
because I love the multiplayer in 3 and all that

4524
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
and so it's like, yeah you gotta play Mass Effect

4525
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,000
but you do kinda have to

4526
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:16,000
push through Mass Effect 1 because

4527
02:50:16,000 --> 02:50:18,000
the story is still really good even if the

4528
02:50:18,000 --> 02:50:20,000
Mako scenes will drive you up a fucking wall

4529
02:50:20,000 --> 02:50:22,000
but it's still worth playing

4530
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
alright

4531
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
let's see, DungeonBuster in chat says

4532
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
not a fan of Dragon Age 2 myself, but lore wise

4533
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
it's useful, it was fun playing a

4534
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
smart ass mage in that one

4535
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:34,000
so apparently there's a rumor that

4536
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:36,000
Final Fantasy DS

4537
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,000
will be coming to arcades next month

4538
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
oh yeah, I'd heard that, yeah

4539
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:44,000
good, more stuff in arcades to play

4540
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,000
except that'll probably just be Japan, not here, right?

4541
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:48,000
yeah, probably

4542
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
I would like to see it come to consoles someday

4543
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
hopefully

4544
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
get on it, get on that

4545
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:56,000
remake a game you just put out

4546
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:58,000
for consoles

4547
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:00,000
alright, that's gonna do it

4548
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:02,000
the phones aren't lighting up and it's about 9 o'clock

4549
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:04,000
here on the west coast, I think we're gonna go ahead and wrap

4550
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:06,000
up for the night, but I do want to thank you

4551
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:08,000
guys for tuning in to Orange Laundry Radio

4552
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:10,000
remember as we say every week, if you enjoyed the show

4553
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
please tell a friend, or 5

4554
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
or 15, about Orange

4555
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
Laundry Radio, we are the show where every gamer

4556
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
has a voice, but a lot of people out there

4557
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:20,000
we're not notable enough to be on Wikipedia

4558
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
so we have to really

4559
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
rely on your voices and word of mouth

4560
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
to help us get out there

4561
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:28,000
and we really appreciate it, so

4562
02:51:28,000 --> 02:51:30,000
that goes a long way

4563
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:32,000
leave us a fake 5 star review on Amazon

4564
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:34,000
leave us a real one on

4565
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,000
iTunes or Stitcher Radio

4566
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:38,000
or wherever it is that you found this program

4567
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,000
all that stuff goes a very long way

4568
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
time to go around and get everybody's final thought

4569
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,000
I guess I'll start

4570
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,000
my final thought is

4571
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:48,000
I need a nap after how delicious

4572
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:50,000
those pumpkin rolls were

4573
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:52,000
so BRB nap

4574
02:51:52,000 --> 02:51:54,000
except, ooh I want to play more Dragon Quest Heroes

4575
02:51:54,000 --> 02:51:56,000
so maybe no nap

4576
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:58,000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight

4577
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:00,000
according to this quiz, I'm

4578
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:02,000
Princess Aurora

4579
02:52:02,000 --> 02:52:04,000
from Sleeping Beauty

4580
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:06,000
and before we get to Loki's final thought

4581
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
I want to say AkumaJP says, Dissida is on

4582
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
handheld console though, that is true

4583
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
I'm talking about the arcade one, yeah I understand

4584
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:14,000
that that one is, we want the new shiny one

4585
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:16,000
on Playstation 4, alright, just making sure

4586
02:52:16,000 --> 02:52:18,000
we clarify that there, anyway

4587
02:52:18,000 --> 02:52:20,000
last but not least, Loki, your final thought

4588
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:22,000
my final thought is I need to work on my costume

4589
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:24,000
and also Ultimate Spiderman

4590
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:26,000
because Spiderman is one of the greatest cartoons

4591
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:28,000
that they have for Marvel Spiderman

4592
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,000
I mean, the writing is great

4593
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:32,000
it's just great

4594
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:34,000
great, that does it

4595
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:36,000
for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio

4596
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:38,000
