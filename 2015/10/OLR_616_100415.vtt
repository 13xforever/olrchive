00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
One year and one week later after Jackbox Games kickstart and release they're back to talk about doing it all over again with the Jackbox Party Pack 2

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
Join us to ask questions along with your comments, calls, and more which all starts right now on the show where every gamer has a voice

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:36.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

00:36.000 --> 00:44.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio tonight with episode number 616 for October the 4th of 2015

00:44.000 --> 00:56.000
My name is Rob Roberts or on Twitter I'm at Skie and I am here with you every week in Studio N7 in lovely Sacramento, CA with my co-hosts

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
Say hello over there to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers

01:00.000 --> 01:07.000
Hello, how are we fighting about? Is there a cookie that we're fighting over?

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
No, I wish I had a cookie

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
I wish I had a cookie too, sorry there are no cookies to be found here

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
There are pumpkin chocolate chip cookies at the grocery store

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Yum

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
I told Becky she needs to make us some

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Sorry DarkSakura, our cookie is in another castle

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Well fuck that cookie, I'll make a cookie

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
Alright, also say hello to TechMasterLoki

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Hi, I'm here

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Hi, you're here, how you doing?

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Doing alright

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Two weeks in a row of perfect attendance everybody

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
Let's put it on the board

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
Number of weeks without an absence too, there we go

01:39.000 --> 01:42.000
I feel like I should have one of those little white tote board thingies

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
You know, with the changing numbers

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
Anyway, myself, DarkSakura, and Loki here with you all of course to talk about

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
You know what, no extra guests here in studio tonight

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
But that's okay because we always are joined by you guys in our chat room

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
Where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
Again that's live.vognetwork.com

02:08.000 --> 02:13.000
And SSG100Matt in our chat room saying everyone gets a star today

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
And I'm assuming that is a gold star there in the chat room

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
Appreciate it

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
I don't recognize any other type of star

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
That's right, you don't ever see people handing out silver stars

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
It's like

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Here's your bronze star

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
You know what, what if I like the color green?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
Do I get a green star? Like how does that work?

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
We're orange lounge radio, should we have orange stars?

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Come on people, think outside the gold box

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Alright, no I'm kidding

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
We appreciate all the gold stars

02:36.000 --> 02:39.000
Raginator in chat, I love this one

02:39.000 --> 02:42.000
Says, two, two weeks without absence

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Ah, ah, ah

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
That's a good quote

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
Raginator made a funny joke

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
Oh my god, this is going to be an amazing show tonight you guys

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
I'm so excited

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
Seattle chat says warp star

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
I like that

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
Although Starboard Power Coupling is on Thursday nights on the network

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Anyway

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
We're here to talk about video games

03:01.000 --> 03:05.000
And we actually do have a guest that's going to be joining us via the Skype line

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
In about 15 minutes here live with us

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
And we're really excited to welcome back to the show this week

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Jackbox Games

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
And Steve-o is going to be joining us this week from Jackbox Games

03:15.000 --> 03:19.000
To talk all about the Jackbox Party Pack Part 2

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
And we are very excited to talk about this upcoming release

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Because I don't know if y'all played Part 1

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
But that was a lot of fun

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
And you know

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
In the interest of transparency

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
We here at OLR

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
We've made it no secret that we kind of

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
Alright sometimes we're a little partial to Jackbox Games

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
And it's not just because they'll come on the show

03:37.000 --> 03:41.000
But I grew up loving those things like You Don't Know Jack

03:41.000 --> 03:44.000
And you know the things that Berkley Systems used to do back in the day

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Which you know if you trace their history

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
You know basically went from one company to another

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Acrophobia and all this stuff

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
So I'm really happy to have them on the show

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Talk about what they're doing these days

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Because I really feel like they've kind of had a renaissance of sorts

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
In the past couple years

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
With the relaunch of You Don't Know Jack

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
And all these other things that they're doing online

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
So we'll be talking to them live

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
And if you want to join us in our chat room

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Over at live.vognetwork.com

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
You can actually ask questions along with the interview

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
It's interactive like that

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Very excited about that

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
Meanwhile though we are going to get to a kickoff topic here in studio

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Because we do of course talk about

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
What's going on in gaming and gaming culture every week

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Here at Orange Launch Radio

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
And tonight's kickoff topic

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
I want to talk about

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
A little bit of a real life experience

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
That I had today

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
And I want to get Dark Soccer and Loki's opinion on this

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
As well as you guys in our chat room

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
And today I went shopping

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Which you know

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Everybody goes shopping once in a while right

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
But today I went shopping to a lot of different places

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Because my buddy Shane

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Who calls into the show quite often

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Who you know was a guest on Horde House

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
I'm sure a lot of you know him by now

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Shane has this fascination

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
Shall we say with Power Rangers dolls

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Which you know I get it

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Everybody's got their thing right

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
You know what if you collect amiibo

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
You have no right to talk

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
To talk down to Shane about what he's collecting

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
So he loves his Power Rangers things

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
And he actually like

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
He does that thing where he kind of tracks

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Like the different stores and what they're getting

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
And I think there's like a forum that he's posting to

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
So long story short

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
We had to go to like Target

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Over on this side of town

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
And the Walmart over here

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
And Best Buy

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
All to look for basically Power Rangers dolls

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
And amiibo

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Which was something that I was looking for

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
Because you know they've had the recent reprinting

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Of some of the hard to get amiibo

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
So I was looking for some of that

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
At these different stores

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
Well the reason why I bring up going shopping

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
To all these different stores is

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
I'm really noticing

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
And I feel like we've talked about this on the show

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
A couple years ago

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
When this was first starting to take place

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
But now that we've had new games come out

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Like Lego Dimensions last week

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
Shelf space being made for Guitar Hero

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
Skylanders

05:49.000 --> 05:50.000
Amiibo

05:50.000 --> 05:53.000
I am really feeling the toy-splosion

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
That's happening in the video game world

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
And I mean

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
When I was at Toys R Us

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
I'm telling you

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Like one whole wall

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
Dedicated to the Lego Dimensions

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
And because you know what the Lego Dimensions is

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
It's the starter pack

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
But it's not just the starter

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
It's starter pack for Wii U

06:10.000 --> 06:11.000
Starter pack for Xbox 360

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
For the one

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
For the PlayStation 4

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
And then it's level packs

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Like you know

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Portal 2

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Back to the Future

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Simpsons

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
Fun packs

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Which is like more vehicles

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Fun packs which are like characters

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
And then they have like

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Team packs

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Or something like that

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Which are a few characters

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Yeah

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
And then

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
Okay so

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
That's just Lego Dimensions

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
Now add to that

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
The fact that Skylanders has a new game this year

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Everybody's going fucking nuts over Amiibo

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
Guitar Hero and Rock Band are now making a space

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Which I

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I know that isn't really toys

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
But it's still that odd peripheral space

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
That everybody said was dead

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
Cause remember this show goes back to

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Dance Dance Revolution right

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
So when we started this show

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Cause if you didn't know

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
Myself, Loki, Dark Sakura

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
We all met playing Dance Dance Revolution

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
And look at me now

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
You would never have noticed that

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
You would know that Loki has a strange affinity

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
For Eurodance music but

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
It is true

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
But anyway

07:12.000 --> 07:13.000
Some of it I mean

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
Some of it

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
But anyway

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
You know at that point

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
I remember we would have conversations about

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
DDR saved peripherals

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
Peripherals were a joke

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
In gaming for the longest time in the 90s right

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
Because

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
What do we love to quote from the wizard

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
The power glove

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
It's so bad right

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Cause it really was bad

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Did you guys play with the power glove?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
It was bad

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
And smelled funny

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Yeah it did kind of smell funny

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
And then the U-Force

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
It didn't

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
Remember the magazine ads for the U-Force

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
Making it look like you would actually be playing pun

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
It didn't fucking work like that

07:44.000 --> 07:45.000
It did not

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
Work like that whatsoever

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
The power pad

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
They made what like two games for the power pad

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
And that was okay

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
So it's like

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Peripherals were kind of in this weird dead place

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Where they didn't really make them

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
During the Super Nintendo era

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
Yes

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
I love the Super Scope

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
I know the Super Scope

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
But like what there was like one Super Scope game

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
Maybe I think there was a second more obscure one

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
I mean like there were not a lot of games

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
Well Super Scope 6 and then of course

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
The robot game

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
Cause really those are the only two games that you needed

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Still what a weird ass

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
I mean think about it

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
Battle Clash

08:13.000 --> 08:14.000
What a weird ass concept

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
That the Super Scope was to begin with

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Who had the idea to put a fucking bazooka

08:18.000 --> 08:19.000
Like

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Hey we need a zapper gun

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
But that's too small

08:22.000 --> 08:23.000
Let's have a bazooka

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
I'm not knocking

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
That peripheral

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Because it was awesome

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
But I'm just saying

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
It was really weird

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000
When you kind of go back and think about it

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
Why couldn't we just do the zapper again?

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
No?

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Bazooka?

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
I don't know

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
But anyway

08:36.000 --> 08:37.000
So all these peripherals come and go

08:37.000 --> 08:38.000
But now it seems like

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
I don't even know if it's a renaissance

08:40.000 --> 08:41.000
Or if it's just the fact that

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Disney and Lego

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Which are huge entertainment companies

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
And toy makers are now seeing these big dollar signs

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Thanks to what Activision did with Skylanders

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
So now they're flooding with all this

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
But what is up with the toy splosion?

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
And how does this make you feel

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
When you go to the video game section

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
At let's say Toys R Us or Target

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
And over half

09:02.000 --> 09:03.000
Excuse me

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Over half of it

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
I mean

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
And that's not

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Look at the square footage

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
Video games themselves

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
Don't take up much space

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
And a lot of that is shifting digital

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
And that might be part of this as well

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
But over half that shelf space

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Are the toys

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
And the peripherals

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
And things that we

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
Like ten years ago

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
You could not have guessed that this was going to happen

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
You could not have guessed

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
And that's pretty nice for

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
Companies like GameStop

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
That are fearing that it's going to go all digital

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Because it's not

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
There's no way they can

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
If they have all this crap that they have to sell

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
So

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
I don't know

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
So far

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
Prior to this year

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
It was pretty easy for me to avoid all that stuff

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Because I'm like

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Fuck that

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
I'm not really going to invest in Disney Infinity

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
Or

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Skylars

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Because just Skylars

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
I don't really give a shit about that

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Disney Infinity

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
It was expensive

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
I tried it a little bit

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
And then just kind of like

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
It's not my age demographic

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
But then again

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
There's the Lego game

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
And I

10:01.000 --> 10:04.000
That might be my Achilles heel right there

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
The thing about that Lego game for me

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
And I finally took the plunge

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
And I bought that Lego Dimensions

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
It is the tie-ins that they're tying in with

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Are so random

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
But awesome

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Like Portal 2

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
Simpsons

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
That Midway arcade thing

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
Ghostbusters

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
Back to the Future

10:22.000 --> 10:23.000
That's the thing

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Doctor Who

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
That's what finally sold me on it

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Is that it wasn't just Disney movies

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Or this made up universe

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Which Skylanders is

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
But it was like

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
Really awesome things

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
Like all in kind of a giant blender

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
What do you think of all this

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
Dark Soccer?

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
I mean

10:37.000 --> 10:38.000
You kind of used to collect this stuff

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
I mean

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
The Dreamcast game with a dish

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Hello?

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Well

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
But I was also

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
I was super into Cardcaptor Sakura

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
When I got that

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
And I came really close to getting the Sakura Taisen one as well

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
But you know

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
I had this big thing for collector's editions

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
Like back when we had a bunch more disposable income

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
Now we've got the income for it

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
But it's not so disposable

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
If that makes sense

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Sure

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
And Dan and I were looking at it

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
And we're like

11:04.000 --> 11:05.000
Well you know what

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
We could get this

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
And spend

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
$150

11:08.000 --> 11:14.000
Or I could get Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
For $50

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
And you ended up with Animal Crossing

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Well there was that

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
We were actually going to get the Wii U Pro Controller

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
And then we looked at Lego Dimensions

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
And then did the math on it

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
And I ended up getting a game

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
With the Amiibo reader

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
The Amiibo card reader

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Because I need all of the Animal Crossing cards

11:34.000 --> 11:35.000
And that's more important

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Which is funny

11:36.000 --> 11:37.000
For me personally

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
And I'm not slamming your decision

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
But for me personally

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
I have zero interest in that Happy Home Designer thing

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Yeah

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
I have no interest in it

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
But that's cool

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
How much of the last Animal Crossing game did I play?

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Yeah I know

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
You played a lot of it

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
You played a lot more than I did

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
That's for sure

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
And now I get to design everyone's freaking homes

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
And they better love me for it

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
Let me go to the chat room

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
Which is lighten up over at live.vognetwork.com

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Kaijuto in chat says suckers

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
And they mash all that stuff in

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
To sucker you to buy a cheap mediocre game

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
And Bobby Blackwolf defending his actions

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Saying I'm a sucker

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
But I am having too much fun being a sucker

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
You know I gotta say though

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
And I really truly feel this way

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Like I enjoy Legos anyway

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
So the fact that they kind of made a game around it

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Their games are pretty good though

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Like I wasn't like Lego Marvel

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
I was like yeah Lego games are pretty good

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
You know and they're pretty good

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
But I

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
It's just they're good I don't know

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
I really truly love the Amiibo figures themselves

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Like and I know I've gone on rants about Amiibo

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
And that's all about the distribution

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
And now that that's finally calming its tits a little bit

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
And it's getting a little easier to find

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
You know some of the things you want

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
Especially if you're willing to pay just like

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Four or five more bucks to get it from a Japanese import

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Which is totally easy

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
You know I'm getting those figures a lot easier

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
And I gotta say I really just as a nerd

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
Who was raised on the Legend of Zelda and Mario Brothers

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
I just love those little figures

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
And if they didn't do anything with the game

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
I would be kind of okay with that

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Because let's be real they don't do that much

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Like Amiibos aren't

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
I mean it's cool that they have a little extra

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
And it's usually just something

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Just a little extra something like a Mario Maker

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
And one extra little costume

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Mario Kart and an extra costume

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
I'm not buying those figures for the costume

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
I thought that for Splatoon I'm like

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
Oh maybe I've got this you know Bowser

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
I'm gonna try using this

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Oh sorry that only works with the Splatoon Amiibos

13:26.000 --> 13:30.000
I'm like well then why would I buy those?

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
That's stupid

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
Wat meme in our chat room

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
Wat says

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
I'm holding out for the Montgomery Ward exclusive

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
One could only hope

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
That a store like Montgomery Ward

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Where I believe

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
What was it we bought at Montgomery Ward

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
I think my Super Nintendo came from Montgomery Ward

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
I bought Killer Instinct there

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
Did you?

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
I believe that is where my mom bought my Super Nintendo

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
For Christmas was at a Montgomery Ward

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Which has been leveled many years ago

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
And became a target

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
I believe the sales person said

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Oh yeah our biggest selling game

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
On Super Nintendo right now is Drakken

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
And then my mom bought Drakken

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Which I was like

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
What the hell is this game

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
When I played it

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
Well I mean luckily that was the packing game

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
And I played that like ten times more

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
But then

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Wasn't it nice to have packing games all the time

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Yeah remember those days

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Then I went back to Drakken like a year after I had the Super Nintendo

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
And I was like what the fuck was I missing

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
This game was awesome

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Then they did a sequel, Dragon's View

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
That game was tight

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
That game was awesome

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
So thank you Montgomery Ward salesman

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
For introducing me to a game I probably would have

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Never figured out otherwise

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Cialan Chat says

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
I want the Samus amiibos

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Just to let Nintendo know

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
That the series still needs love

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Raginator in chat over at

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
Live.vognetwork.com says

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
Seeing as I am a diehard

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Magic player, the actual collectible card game

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Back in the day, I can't say

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
Shit about Skylanders, amiibo

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
And so forth, you know that's a good comparison

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Is that there's always

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
Been a space for collectibles

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Even in the gaming world

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Right, I mean board game

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
People right, aren't there usually like

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
Several editions of a game

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Or even a game like

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
What Dominion has all these

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
Like it seems like there's like fifty different

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Probably I'm exaggerating but like

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
All these different booster packs and things like that

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
For that game, or hell Cards Against Humanity

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Right, how many people

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Are like oh, if you go to PAX East

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
You gotta get me the exclusive cards

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
For my Cards Against Humanity game

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Because they add something to the game

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
Whereas amiibos just add like a

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
Costume to the game and it doesn't really matter

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
It's just kind of an excuse

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
To sell DLC

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
But more expensive and it's

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Less valuable

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
So like if someone tried to say hey

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
I'll tell you what

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
You know Mario Kart, do you want a really cool

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
Koopa hat, that's gonna be

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Twelve dollars

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
You'd probably say fuck you, I am not buying that

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
But since they're selling it with a statue

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Sure

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
We'll do that

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
And maybe I'll get to use it

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
In another game someday

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Maybe, maybe

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Alright, well we're

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Going to get to our interview here shortly but

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
Before we get into our gaming weeks real quick

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
We'll at least probably get Dark Soccer's out here

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
And then we'll move into

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Our interview tonight, so

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
We always like to start off the show after our kickoff topic

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
Talking about our gaming weeks

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
Kinda busy, yeah

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
I of course played Dragon Age Inquisition

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
I

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
What else, I got

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Although I haven't had a chance to start it yet

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
What else

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Oh yeah, we got our Wii U

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Which you know we

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Like a whole lot and we borrowed

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Super Mario 3D World

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
And Dan and I started that together

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
Cause you know we can play co-op and

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
You know we fussed each other for you know

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
Knocking each other

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Into enemies and what not, it was still pretty fun

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
And

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Something else but I don't remember so

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
I'll just say that's it

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Alright, Loki

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
How was your gaming week?

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
I did play a lot of stuff

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
I started off trying out Ingress

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
So I've been playing that

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
I'm so proud

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
I'm so happy

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
So I'm level 3 now in Ingress cause I captured

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Two portals today and

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
It's basically just kind of

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
It's kind of gaming in that

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Space between other things

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
I guess if that makes sense

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
Just taking my kids to the park

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Instead of just sitting there

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Bored while I'm pushing them on the swing

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
I can hack a portal and push them

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
On the swing, it's multitasking

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
It's like foursquare really

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
That's why I always kind of like you know we always

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Just check in, we go places, it's kind of like that

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
Except now you can kind of, you can literally like

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Piss on something for your team

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
And be like it's mine

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
I claim this in the name of Spain

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
I don't know if like I'd be going down like to

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
Oh I gotta go to some event or something in San Francisco

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Or something, I don't know if I'd do that but you know

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
I don't know, it's something to do

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
While I'm waiting for things

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
I guess if that makes sense

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
So I don't know

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
And then let's see what other

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Brief thing can I get into

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Played a little bit of Lego Marvel Super Heroes

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
Because my son is still playing that

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
I think he's like 220 hours now

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
In that game

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
It's like you were with Minecraft at one point

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
I think he spent

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
More time in that game

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
So I'm looking forward to getting whatever the next

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Lego Avengers

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
I love this comment from Bobby Blackwolf in chat

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Loki gets a Wii U and then starts playing Ingress

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
That's great

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
I can't play Ingress at home

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
So it's just when I'm out

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Ingress is an outdoor game

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
It is

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
And it got me to go walking one lunch

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
See that's what the game does to you

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
It's crazy

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
But anyway, I don't want to turn this into an Ingress show

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
Somebody suggested that I do one

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
I'm still thinking about it

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
Super Mario Maker

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
I made a level called

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Jigsaw's Castle of Carnage

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
And no one has passed it

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
Except for me

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
It's incredibly hard

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
I know Bobby was talking about this on his show

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
Earlier tonight

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
All the levels are just torture porn

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
And I don't mean that

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
In a Jigsaw movie kind of way

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
It's all just

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Everybody wanting to be asshole Mario

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
It's not asshole Mario

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
I have hidden blocks

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
It's not trolling you

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
It's just genuinely difficult

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
I guess

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
It's not incredible

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
I passed it after about 50 tries

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
It's just torture

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
There's a mistake in it too

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
I accidentally missed one of the pits

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
It has a block covering

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
I'm like ah shit

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
I gotta fix this and pass the game again

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
If I want to edit it

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
That's staying there

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
I played Splatoon

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
And I actually figured out how to play that finally

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
And enjoying it now that I have the paint roller

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
At this point though I can't use my other Amiibo stuff

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
For unlocking costumes

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Still trying to figure out what I'm using that for

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
I think that's about it

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
That's about it for your gaming week huh?

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
We are actually going to go to

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
Our interview because it's about 6.30

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
So we are going to actually give

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Steve-O a call

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
With Jackbox Games

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
And he is actually the editorial director

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Over at Jackbox and tonight

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
We are going to be talking about the Jackbox Party Pack

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
Part 2 and I'm really excited

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
To welcome to the show Steve-O

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Are you there Steve?

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
I am can you hear me?

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
We can hear you just fine welcome to Orange Launch Radio

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Thank you for having me on

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
Thank you so much for being here

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
I don't know if you heard earlier in the show

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
We admit that we are a little partial

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
To Jackbox Games

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
Just because you guys come on the show

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Just because I love

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Game Show Games

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
I was talking about this with Mike last time we were here

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
When he was here

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
I don't want to necessarily repeat the conversation

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
I was so bummed when 1 vs 100

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Went off of Xbox Live

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
I feel like you guys are making games

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
That help fill that gap if that makes sense

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
Oh yeah definitely

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
In fact as we

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
We are constantly trying to come up with

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
New ideas for games

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
The 1 vs 100 idea

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
Something that really keeps coming up with us

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
Something like that

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
That we might try to do someday

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
That is very similar to that but not that obviously

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
We wouldn't steal the idea

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
No you would never steal it

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
No no

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
Because you can play our games

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
On streams and there are hundreds of people watching

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
Since your phone is your controller

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
You can have a lot of people playing

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
I wouldn't be surprised

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
If we make something like the 1 vs 100

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Kind of style of game sometimes

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
Inspired by

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
We'll say inspired

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
How has that streaming

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
Thing been going

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
Because I noticed

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
You guys noticed early on

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
With some of your earlier fibage

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
And some of the games you put out

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
During this renaissance period

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Ever since the newer You Don't Know Jack games

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
You guys are putting out more things

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
On the networks

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
I noticed that the streaming

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
Has really been a big part

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
For you guys

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
So much so that I noticed in Quiplash

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
It seemed like you made some decisions

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
In the game such as enabling streaming mode

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
And doing these things that

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
Kind of catered towards live streamers

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
Have you been surprised that that has been

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Such a huge part of the games?

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Absolutely, in fact

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
We knew it was the thing

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
But we didn't realize with our games

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
How popular it would become

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
When we first did the first fibage

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
That's when we noticed

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
We saw people playing

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
They were giving comments

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
It would be great if the host had

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
A little bit more control over certain things

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Such as

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
Well

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
There were things like time issues

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
People are playing on a stream

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
And they're not really live

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
15 seconds delayed because of the stream

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
How does that work?

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Are they still seeing all the information they need

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
On their phone or on their controller

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
In case they can't see

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
They're not synced up with what's on the screen

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
We had an issue

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
At the beginning where

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Any of the people

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Who had logged in to play the game

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
Could actually hit the start button and start the game

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
So people

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Out in the world were pressing

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Start and not everybody had gotten in yet

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
So we sort of tailored that to be

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Only the first person to log in

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
That would be the host or whoever is running the stream

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Only the person who is running the stream

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
Can push the start button now

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
Stuff like that that we heard feedback on

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
And now we're really starting to integrate

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
Damn those trolls

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
It made the game even better

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Even trolls can teach you a thing or two sometimes

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
Even though we shouldn't admit that

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
I noticed some of your games

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
Are tailored now to more and more people

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
For example

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
A lice water went up to 100 people

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
And I'm noticing in one of these games

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
That's in the Jackbox Party Pack

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Bomb Corps

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
How many people can participate

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
Not necessarily play but participate

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
In Bomb Corps, tell us about that

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Because that seems like it has to be done

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
With a streaming audience in mind

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Because I know I can't hold 10,000 people in my living room

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
Well actually

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
There's a couple of games

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
In the Party Pack

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
The Party Pack 2

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
That we've integrated this

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
Audience feature

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
And so what the audience feature is

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
Is sort of like

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
You're not actually a player in the game

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
But you are participating in some way

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
So for instance in Quiplash

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
The audience

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
There's 8 core players

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Up to 8 core players

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
But as many as 10,000 people can join

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Because they can vote on their favorite answers

25:00.000 --> 25:02.000
And actually affect the outcome of the game

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
So

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
We have games

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
Like lice water

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
Goes up to actually 100 players

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
That could actually play it

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
As a player

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
But now we're starting to find

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
This other little area which is called the audience

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
Where it's sort of like a

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
It's like partial participation in the game

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
While you're viewing it

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
And when you're

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
When you're not like a full time player in the game

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
You know our servers

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
The way our architecture is sort of set up

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
We can sort of support more of a

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
Semi player if you will

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
So the people who are watching on streams

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
Aren't just passively watching our games now

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
We can get 10,000 people in

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
And actually have some sort of effect on the game

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
It is this really fascinating

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
Trend I'm seeing with games

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
Not just from you guys

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
But I was at TwitchCon for a little bit

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
And I was talking about that on the show last week

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
And I know you guys were there too

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
I noticed there were actually games being made

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
With Twitch in mind

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
And there was this one game being shown

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Where they could add obstacles and things

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
And I remember in the Tomb Raider collection

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
That was one of the earliest ones I remember

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
That would really affect things

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
It sounds like you guys are kind of taking that as well

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Where you're playing with the world

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
And they can impact the game

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
I mean how is

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
How was TwitchCon for you guys

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
And all that?

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
I wasn't out there

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
We were out there

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
My coworkers were out there

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
And yeah it's definitely

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
And the Twitch folks

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
Are very interested in what we're doing too

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
So they're being very

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
Open to sort of

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
Helping us get our stuff

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
Optimized for

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
Twitch

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
So I think we have a good working relationship

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
With them that's kind of building right now

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
But I was out at PAX Prime

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
Not too long ago

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
And we actually did a

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Talk with the folks

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
Who do iDAR

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
I don't know if you're familiar with that

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
It's a game where audience participation is there

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
People are

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
Sending hashtags through Twitter

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
And they're sort of

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Adding bombs and all sorts of things

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
To the game

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
The way we do it is a little bit different

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
You're either voting on a winner

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Or you're playing along with the questions

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
The trivia questions

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
There's a lot of different ways

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
Integrating this sort of concept

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
Of like hey people are

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Enjoying just watching games

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
Wouldn't it be cool if we could actually give them

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
A little bit of participation too

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
Let's talk a little more about some of the games

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
That are going to be in the Jackbox Party Pack

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
In case you guys have missed it

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
Or out there listening

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
I know on your blog and through your various

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Social media streams which also includes

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
A live stream, you guys do your own live streams

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
On Fridays right?

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
2 o'clock central on Fridays, tune in

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
There you go, you can play along with people

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Who make the games

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
You have 5 games that you've announced on your blog

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
That are going to be included in this game

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
Fibbage 2, Earwax,

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Idiots, which I love that name

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
Quiplash XL and

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
Bomb Core

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Now I got to ask a tough question

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
That I think a lot of folks are going to be thinking

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
And I got to ask it

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
Why did you pass on a You Don't Know Jack game

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
For this collection? I was a little surprised to see that

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Well, you know

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
We're not killing

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
You Don't Know Jack

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
Oh yeah

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
I just noticed

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
It was passed on for this

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
So I was just kind of surprised

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
Because I was expecting that to be a game

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
Not that I'm disappointed

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
One of the things

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
What we learned when we were watching

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
People play the Jackbox

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Party Pack 1, the original

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Was that the games like

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Fibbage and Drawfold

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Were super streamable

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
And that's what we were

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Kind of, a lot of the games that we were trying

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
To make for this version were

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
Sort of tailored a little bit more toward that

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
And while You Don't Know Jack is streamable

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
For sure

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
It's limited to four players

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
And it's really hard

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
With the timing of the questions

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
The way the game is kind of set up now

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
To really get an audience that's on a 15 second

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Delay kind of involved in it

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
So the games that we saw

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
That were really big hits from the

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Jackbox Party Pack 1

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
Like Fibbage, like Drawfold

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
We saw that those were games that people were

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
You know, they were able to

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Create their own sort of content

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
On their phone slash controller device

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
And Fibbage, it's your entering

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Lies, in Drawfold

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
You're drawing things that are funny

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
So we kind of tried to go

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
A little bit more in that direction with this

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Party Pack 2

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
And so, you know, like I said

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
You Don't Know Jack is not dead

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
The five games in this pack

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
I think people are going to enjoy

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
From the perspective of

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
They're great party games

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
They're great for your controller

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
They're great for streams, or your phone is a controller

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
They're great for streams

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
And I think when we do You Don't Know Jack again

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
We'll definitely try to

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
Make some changes that make it a little bit more

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Fitting with the kind of way we're doing things now

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
Okay, you know what, now I'm glad I asked

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
That question because what you're saying is making a lot of sense

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
See, I thought you might be being that

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
Band coming out on stage not wanting to play

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
Their hit single, I thought maybe that was what was

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
Going on, but no, I'm glad I asked that because what you say

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
There makes a lot of sense, you're right

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
The streams are more of that party

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
Streaming thing, whereas You Don't Know Jack, the timing is so important

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
That makes a lot of sense

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
Although if you throw your bras and panties

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
Up on stage, we might

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Go ahead and make one

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
Well, if you insist

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
Alright, anyway

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Loki, get on that

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
Alright, anyway

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
I hope you take like, you know

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
X-Men Underoos or something

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Take? That would

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
That would complete my collection

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Awesome

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
See why we like having them on the show

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
Alright, let's talk about some of these games that are in the Party Pack

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
I want to start with Bomb Corps

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
Because to me, when I looked at Bomb Corps

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
I was like, alright, this looks really different

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
For Jackbox, but I'm like

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
I'm here for this, this is the kind of retro

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Looking thing, tell us a little more about

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Bomb Corps and where this idea came from

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
And how it fits into the pack

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Yeah, so, you know, what we wanted to do

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
Was like, since you use

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
Your phones as controllers

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
Or your tablet or your laptop

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
We have this ability to send secret information

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
So that's something that doesn't

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
You know, you don't get on a

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
When you're using just a standard game controller

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
So everybody, the fact that everybody could get

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
You know, sort of secret information that not everybody else had

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
We tried to

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
We were coming up with ideas that would

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
You know, really play to that

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
So with Bomb Corps

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
It's funny that you say Bomb Corps

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
Because we went back and forth on this

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Is it, like, when it's

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
C-O-R-P period, is it corp?

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
Or corp, Bomb Corp?

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
We don't even know, we're going with corp

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
But you can call it corp if you want

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
I don't know, but then I also think

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
An actual, like, core of the bomb

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
I don't know, I thought maybe it was a double entendre

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
Because I notice you guys like puns

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
No, I thought that might

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
I thought that might have been the thing, but alright

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
Yeah, no, but anyway

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
I got, yes, so

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
The idea kind of came from this idea of

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
You know, how can we

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Leverage this idea of, like, everybody

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Has different information, so in Bomb Corp

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
You get, each

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Player gets a little bit of information as to how

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
To diffuse a bomb

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
If the timer's ticking down

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
And you kind of have to do a co-op

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Work together to diffuse the bomb

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
So, you know, I might say

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
You might say, oh, I've got rule number one

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
You know, don't cut any red wires

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Unless they're next to white wires

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
And then the second person has a different rule and says

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Don't cut anything about red wire, you know

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
So, or, only player three

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
Can cut wires, so it's

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
It starts off a little simple

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
And then it gets really, really complicated

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
Or really not complicated, it gets more challenging

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
There you go

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
Now, I'm just thinking, though, if I were the

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
I mean, you're gonna have those Lokis

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Or the assholes of the party who lie about the direction

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
I don't do that

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
Well, you know what

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Fine, we all know it's Jamie that does that

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Who would say, oh, I made a mistake

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
It's Irene that would do that

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
That's true, Irene

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
Oh, come on, I'm the person in Maniac Mansion

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
Who just gets sick of the game, goes and blows up everything

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
Yeah, maybe

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
I pushed the red button in the pool

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
It's always Irene that's drawing the penis

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
In those games, it's all

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
It's like, okay, hmm, yeah, I wonder who did that

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
It's always Irene

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
Well, some of our games actually call for drawing up penises

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
So that's good

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
I think I actually saw on your Twitter account

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
Somebody lucked out and got the room code

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
D-N-I-S or something like that

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
It cracked me up

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
Yeah, you know, we actually go through

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
We actually go through an exhaustive process

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
Every time, it's like, what do we need to add

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
To this list that's not gonna get us in trouble

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
You know, and so

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
There's like an hour every time

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
We put out a game, it's like, alright, here's the

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
Existing list, is there anything else we've missed

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
You know, there's always something

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
You know, V-U-V-A

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Bulba or something, I don't know

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
There's always something that we're like, well

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
That's okay, we'll leave it or we take it out

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Are you telling me that Jackbox Games

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
Has a list of four letter words that goes around

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
The office, hey, if anybody can think of

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
Another four letter word that's not on the list

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
It's an hour long brainstorm

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
Every product, yeah

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
Let Steve and HR know by five o'clock Friday

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
Yeah

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
I mean, you know, mostly you're trying to get

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
The sort of, the really bad, like racist stuff

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
Anything that could be a derogatory term

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Out of there, but then there's always one

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
That comes up and you're like, how did we

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
Miss that, like the penis one you just said

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
So

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
Alright, anyway

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
But the point, I was gonna say about BombCorp

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
If you, you know

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
The thing is, if you decide to blow everything up

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
And you decide not to play along, we think that

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
The moment where everyone blows up is pretty

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
Funny anyway and never gets old, so there you go

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
It's the Magroober experience

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
It is the Magroober kind of thing, yeah

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
And I'm gonna say that from now on

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
When I say the BombCorp

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
I'm gonna just say it that way when I'm plugging it

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
Right here on this show

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
Let's talk about some of the other newer games

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
I'm familiar with Fibbage and Quiplash

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
Although I'm sure there's lots of new features

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
We'll go back to those if we have time

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
By the way, if you guys have questions for Steve

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
Please, by all means, ask away in our chatroom over at

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
Live.vognetwork.com

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
I wanna talk about some of these other newer games that are in it

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Earwax, we were joking around

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
On the show last week because we thought this was a pretty

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
Funny concept, so this is a game all around

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
Sound effects

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
And you just string sound effects

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
It's like charades but with sound effects

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
Tell us more about Earwax

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
Okay, yeah, so that was one of the things

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
When we started with Party Pack 2

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
We really wanted to get a game with sound effects

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Because we had

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
Fibbage where you're typing in answers

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
And Quiplash 2 and we had Drawful where you were drawing

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
Things and we were like, what else can we do?

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
Well, we could submit sounds

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
And so we

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
Tried a whole bunch of different ways of

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
Doing it and what ended up being really the funniest

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
To us was this idea of

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
You get a prompt and it's

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
The prompt could be like

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
Retirement home

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
Love affair or something like that

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Please God no

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
And then you have a car

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
A handful of sound effects

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
When I say a handful of sound effects on your phone

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Or your tablet, you'll have a list

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
Of sound effects that are kind of like the cards in your hand

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
And you don't hear them

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Necessarily, you just see the description of them

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
And you kind of are trying to put

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Together a one-two punch

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Two sound effects back to back

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
That best fit

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
That prompt that you got

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
So everyone submits their two sounds

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
And then you go through

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
A reveal to hear everyone's sounds

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
Back to back and it's usually pretty funny

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
And then there's a judge for each round

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
The judge is actually the person

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Who picks the card in the first place

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
Old folks, retirement home, love affair, whatever

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
And then the person who's the judge

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
Gets to pick which one they like the best

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
That sounds

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
What's most interesting

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
About that to me is

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
Who's the person at the office that had to compile

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
All those sound effects

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
They've got a dream job, I'm telling you

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
Right, well Andy Poland is our

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
You know, our audio music guru

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
And I will say

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
That many, many of those sound effects

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Obviously, we already had in our big giant

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Database of sound effects that we use for all our games

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
But with the help of

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Some interns

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
By the way, in BombCorp

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
You are an intern

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Working at BombCorp

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
So we got to have a lot of fun with our interns

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Our actual interns

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
During the summer

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
But anyway, I'm going off on a tangent

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
We had interns help us organize

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
The sound effects, but it's all Andy

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
When you hear a nice long fart sound effect

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Andy Poland made that at some point

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
In his bathroom or near his bathroom

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
Oh my god

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
That's amazing, I love that

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
You passed it on to the interns too

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Fantastic

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Let's talk a little bit about Bidiots

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Which is my favorite name of any game there

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
And I'm sure you guys must all have to

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
Brainstorm these names for the games as well

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
And somehow

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Some genius comes up with this

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
But let's talk about Bidiots

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
So actually what you're drawing on your phone

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
And then the other players bid

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
On the art, like what is valuable

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
Or funniest, or how does that work?

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
Yeah, so

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
You're given

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
Kind of like our game Drawful

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
You're given a prompt

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
And you draw

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
This thing as best you can

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
And it's probably not going to be that

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Your drawing's not going to be that great

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
But you get two drawings

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
And you draw two drawings within a minute and a half or so

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
And then you submit them

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
And they become pieces of art in this art auction

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
And then once you've submitted all your art

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
And everyone's submitted all their drawings

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Everyone becomes a bidder at this auction

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
So it becomes much more

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Of a fast paced

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
You know, just like you're at a real auction

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
And you get some secret information

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
On your phone

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Or on your device, whatever controller you're using

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
That tells you

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
Certain things are worth a certain amount of money

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
There's a little bit of vagary there

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
So you kind of

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
Have an idea of what some things might be worth

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
And what they might not

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
And the other thing is

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
It might say, well, the drawing of

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
Bananas

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Bananas playing volleyball

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
Or whatever

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Might be worth a lot

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Or might be worth

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
$3,200

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
And then you see an image up on screen

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
And it looks like it might be bananas

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
And it looks like there might be a ball

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
And the thing is

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
Obviously, for the purposes of the game

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
We've given everybody very similar drawings

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
So, you know

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
You may be thinking that this is a very valuable

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
Bananas playing volleyball

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
When in fact it's bananas

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Doing the limbo or something like that

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
And it was only worth $900

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
So the idea is that you're bidding

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
You're trying to guess what each thing's worth

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
And then at the end of the game

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
However much money you have left

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
Plus the profit you've made on

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
Basically what the art pieces

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
Were valued at

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
Minus what you paid for them

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
That's the profit you make off of

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
And so at the end of the game you're trying to have the most profit

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Awesome. Well, these games sound like a lot of fun

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
I love that, you know, it could have been tempting

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
To probably just make

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Sequels to everything

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
In Party Pack 1

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
And I'm sure that would have been a lot of fun too

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
And you do have sequels, essentially, to fun games

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
But you have a little bit of that but mixed with these new ideas

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
And I think that sounds like it's going to be

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
A lot of fun. I'm looking forward to playing it myself

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
I want to get to some of the questions

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
In our chatroom over at

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
live.vognetwork.com

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
You know, we're a little bit delayed here

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
So we're just now getting a question on the sound effect thing

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
And we have a question from Matt in our chatroom

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
So when someone actually farts in the office

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
Do you all just blame it on Andy?

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
Like the dog, since Andy's the sound guy

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
We actually

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Well, no, I'll tell you why

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
Because Andy, we're in Chicago

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
And Andy is actually in Michigan

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
So we have him

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
On an iPad

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
On a robotic

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
You might have seen

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
These things, but it's like

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
A stand with a wheel

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
And it's got his face on it

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
So he comes to meetings

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
And he moves around the office

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
It's like a robot

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
So to answer that specific question

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
No, we would not expect

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
It would have been Andy that farted

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
Because he's a state away

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
He's on his segue

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
But we do have

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
A lot of us have sound effects

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
At the ready at our desks

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
To play at any moment during the day

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
That's amazing

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
Of course, I know actually a lot of companies

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
The working remotely

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
And all that is being more and more a thing

41:38.000 --> 41:40.000
So I'm not surprised to hear that at all

41:40.000 --> 41:42.000
Let's see, Tigerclaw in our chatroom

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
Over at live.vognetwork.com saying

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
It must be a challenge to come up with all

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
The trivia in the game

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Considering those questions get outdated

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
Faster after people play through it

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
Multiple times

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
Sure, that's a risk

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
That just means people are enjoying your game too much

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
That they wore out all the questions

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
So let's come up with new questions

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
For these games

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
Quiplash, the first version

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
Was out just a few months ago

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
And now here we are coming up on

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
Quiplash XL

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
Where do all these prompts come from?

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
How do you do it?

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
Well, thank you

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
We have a great staff

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Of writers that we have on staff

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
It's a little bit different for each game

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
Quiplash

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
The prompts are

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
The challenge with those is not

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
Having too many that are similar

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
To each other

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
Because in Quiplash XL we have a thousand

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
Prompts

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
You're going to be hard pressed

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
To get through all of them

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
And some of those are from the original

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Quiplash

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
We've added on to the original

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
So the challenge there is

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
Man, we've already

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
Asked about

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
What

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Pat Sajak's

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Breath smells like

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
Before

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
So we can't do what

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Alex Trebek's breath smells like

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
So you get a lot of that kind of thing

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
So that's the challenge there

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
Those are a little bit easier to come up with

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
Because they're not based on facts

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
Now if you talk about something like Fibbage

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Those are all sort of wacky

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
News of the weird

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
Kind of things

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
So you're kind of beholden to

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Criminals and people out there

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Just continuing to do stupid things

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
And getting in the news

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
Which luckily they do

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
So that's kind of

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
With Fibbage it's sort of like you're constantly

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Scouring the daily news

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
Updates to see what

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Stupid person has done another stupid thing

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
Or has created some

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
Completely useless

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
House made out of whatever

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
Florida Man

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
Yeah, Florida Man

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
Was everywhere on Facebook this week

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Of the guy who lit his gas tank on fire

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
Trying to kill a spider

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
Oh yes, exactly

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
And in fact those things go around the office

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
And they're sent out and they're like

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Fibbage 3, here's stuff

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
For Fibbage 3

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
You guys must have so much fun

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
At the office passing all this stuff around

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
I mean, it must be just kind of like

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
Being a part of the game all day

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
That's amazing

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
Yeah it's interesting and the thing is

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
When you're doing something like a party pack

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
You've got

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Five mini teams

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
Out of a small group of people

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
So some people aren't

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Even working on certain games

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
So you might be working on

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Two or three and somebody else might be working on

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Two or three, you might overlap on one

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
But we keep a constant

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
Slack thread going at work

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
So everybody kind of

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
Gets a little bit of insight into what's going on

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
In all the other games, even if they're not on the team

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
You kind of still feel a part of it

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
So I think that's a really cool thing about where we work

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
Alright, let me get one more question here and then we'll

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
Wrap up because I know we've had you on for

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
Way longer than we usually say

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
It's going to be 15, 20

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Watmeme is in our chat

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
And I have a feeling he might know this is a loaded question

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
So this might be a good one to ask here

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
Watmeme in chat says, ask Steve-O

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
What would be his dream version of

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
You Don't Know Jack?

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
I think I know who that is, but I'm not going to out him

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
I have a feeling I know who it is too

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
But that's okay, I know this is a loaded question

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
So please answer

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Well the fact that he called me Steve-O

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
The only people who call me Steve-O

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
Are the people who work at Jackbox

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Because when I first started

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
At the company back when it was Jellyvision

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
There were like five Steves

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
So they had to give every Steve a little slightly different thing

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
And I got lucky, I got Steve-O

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
There were some really weird ones

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
So everywhere else I'm just Steve

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
At Jackbox, I'm Steve-O

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
So I know this is somebody who either

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Been watching our streams or works anyway

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
I'm also going to say

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
Without telling people your full name

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
Your last name is not O

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
So it's not like they just used the last initial

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
Right, there's not even an O in it

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Yeah, exactly

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
Yeah, no

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
My dream version of You Don't Know Jack

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
You know, it's kind of hard to

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
Put my, you know, we did the TV show

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
Did you know we did a TV show of You Don't Know Jack?

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Yeah, I did, I was probably, I think I was the one guy

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
That watched it

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
Oh, you were him?

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Oh, thank you

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
I was it with Paul Reubens, how could you not?

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Because that was, was that before or after

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
The infamous, I think that was after

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
It was after, he was like resurrecting

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
His career, he was doing that movie

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Blow with Johnny Depp at the time

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
That's right, that's right

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
I remember getting a Christmas card from him

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
And it had him and Johnny Depp and a bunch of

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
Women from the show

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
It was strange

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
And there's supposed to be a new Peewee movie, but anyway

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Yeah, so my point is

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
We tried it as a TV show, we thought it'd be great

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
Because it's kind of like a TV show that you play

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
But it, you know, it didn't work out that well

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
It was, it had its, it didn't have its

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
It had its qualities, but

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
But like, as far as like the ideal

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
Version of You Don't Know Jack

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
I think if we could get it so that

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
You could play with more than four people

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
That you could stream it and that

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
The great thing is

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
That we still have Cookie, you know, our

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
Tom Gottlieb who plays Cookie Masterson

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
You know, it just would not be

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
The same without him, so thankfully

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
We still have him, he's been around

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
Ever since, you know, You Don't Know Jack volume 3

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Even before that, but he was

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
The host of that, so it would have to have

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Cookie Masterson, it would have to have

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
Support for more than four players

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
And I already have ideas

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
For the next version, but I don't want to

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
Give them all away here, plus I'll probably

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Bring it all to work and people will be like, no

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
So, hahaha

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Act Deft in chat is suggesting a one versus

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
100 You Don't Know Jack hybrid would be

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
The best thing ever

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
That's a direct quote, best thing ever

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
Oh, ever? Ever

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
In that case we'll get right on it

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
Apparently better than this program

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
Or pornography even, who knew

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
But there you go, Steve-o

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
I want to thank you so much for being on the show

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Let's talk one more time everything

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
People need to know about Jackbox Party Back

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Jackbox Party Back 2 is out

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
What, it's out this, like next week

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
Right, it's like ten days away, nine, right?

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
Yes, October 13th, so that's Tuesday

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
Tuesday, October 13th

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
Xbox One, PlayStation 3

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
4, Steam

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
Amazon Fire TV, Google Play

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
There you go, but

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
No Wii U, Steve-o?

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
No Wii U?

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
You're speaking the language of Ben Jacobs

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Our beloved programmer

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Who is in love

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
With all things Nintendo

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
We all love Nintendo, but

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
Right now it's not the right platform for us

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
I understand, I understand, I'm just being

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
Twitter, because I know you guys have got to get those tweets

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
Once in a while, what about Wii U?

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
But anyway, I understand, no, you guys are

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
Obviously supporting an awful lot there between all these different systems

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
And uh,

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
$24.99 local currency, right?

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
$24.99 American

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
And yeah, it's

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
I mean, I don't

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
I try not to sound like too sales pitchy

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
When I say this, but like, the work that we put

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
Into each of these games, we feel like we could

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Sell each one of these five games for like

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
You know, $15 a piece

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
So the fact that you get five of them for $24.99

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
I mean, you can't afford not to buy

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Okay, there, I did it, I went

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
I went all file, I went all sales pitch

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
It's $5 a game, $5 a game

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
Yeah, $5 a game, there you go

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Alright, well Steve-o, best of luck to all you guys at Jackbox Games

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
And you guys are welcome back anytime

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
To announce whatever it is you might be working

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
On next, I assume inevitably

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Someday this will be so successful

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
We might be here in a few months

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
Talking about Jackbox Party Pack 3

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
We will call you from our yacht

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
Sounds good, I look forward to it

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
Alright, thanks for having me on guys

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Alright, take care, thanks so much for being here

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
Alright, bye

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Alright, that was Steve from Jackbox Games

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Of course, as they call him around the office

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
Steve-o, and if you want to read more about what Jackbox is up to

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Jackboxgames.com

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
They're on Twitter as well

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Over at Jackbox Games

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
And they're on Facebook

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Hey, you know where? Jackbox Games, there it is

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
And I know I'll be picking up Jackbox Party Pack 2

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
On next day, I can't promise that I'm going to live stream

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
Because I don't need you all messing with my game

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
But no, maybe I will

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Maybe I will do something

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
I think that bomb game with everybody involved

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Will be a lot of fun

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Bomb Corp, will be a lot of fun to play with everybody

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
To register participation

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
For this week's episode of Orange On Radio

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
At vognetwork.com

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Use the passphrase, bacon

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
Alright, we're going to move right back

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Into the show

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
And start to get into some news

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
I'm going to talk about my own gaming week though

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
I didn't really get a chance to get to my gaming week

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
But I don't have a whole lot to add

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
Because I bought stuff, I bought Lego dimensions

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
But I haven't played it yet

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
So this week, what I've actually been playing

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
I've been playing an awful lot of Diablo 3

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
I finally passed Paragon level 200

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
For the season

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
That'll tell you how much I've been playing Diablo 3

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
But once I finish the set bonus

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
For my Demon Hunter, oh my gosh

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
I just mow things down

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
I've been having a lot of fun with that

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
I finally got around to playing

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
And if Cody is out there listening, or even Extover

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
They're going to be both so proud of me that I finally got around to this game

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
On the Xbox One

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
I finally played Ori and the Blind Forest

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
I picked that up in a sale

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
A couple months ago

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
Finally decided to sit down and play this game

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
And I've got to say

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
It's got a really moving intro

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Just in the beginning

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Just in the first 10 minutes of the game

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
I was like, oh god, it's going to be one of those types of games

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
That really kind of moves you with the story

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Even though the narrator kept reminding me

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Of one of the dragons in Final Fantasy 14

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
If you've played Heaven's Word

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
You'll know what I'm talking about

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
If you haven't, don't worry about it

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
It sounds like the narrator in Ori and the Blind Forest

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Ori and the Blind Forest is a Metroidvania

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
To use that term

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
It's one of those types of games

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
It's obviously a different type of setting

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
And the character is very different

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
And the fact that you have this ability

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
Where you can kind of consistently jump up a wall

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
In the very beginning of the game

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
It's like one of the first abilities you get

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Causes the level design to be very different

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Because you have a lot of curvatures

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
And branches and nature

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
And other ways that kind of prevent you from just jumping

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Up all the walls

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
So in that way it kind of makes the design of the game

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
A lot different from games I've seen before

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
And the art direction of the game

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
Is great

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
It's a beautiful game

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
And so yeah, I've got to say

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
I am really enjoying Ori and the Blind Forest

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
The one little drawback

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Where I'm at so far

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Is that the difficulty of the game goes up really fast

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
And you start getting into

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
If you think

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
Loki makes asshole Mario Maker levels

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Wait until you play some of these things

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
In Ori and the Blind Forest

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
There's some really tough parts of the game

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Granted, you can save your game

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Essentially at any time

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
And I thought that was also an interesting mechanic

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
If you have enough energy

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Which you collect from exploding plants

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
And inanimate objects

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
And monsters as you kill them as well

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
You get a little bit of energy

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
You can create a save point anywhere

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
So that makes getting through some of these excruciatingly difficult parts

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
A little bit easier

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
Unless of course you create your save portal

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
At a horrible place

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
But I really enjoyed

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
Ori and the Blind Forest

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
And I want to play more of it in this coming week

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
So that was pretty much my gaming week

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Diablo 3 and Ori and the Blind Forest

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
Housekeeping tonight

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
We do not have any shows off planned

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
But remember

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
DarkSakura and I

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Will be, we should start promoting this

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
DarkSakura and I will be at

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
GamerX or GX3 is what they're calling it

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Because they want to make sure the message is out there

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
That everybody games

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
You don't have to be gay to enjoy GamerX

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
But it helps, no I'm just kidding

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
Everybody will enjoy it

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
No matter what

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
If you're a part of the quilt bag or you're not

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
You're going to have a good time there

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
We will be there

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
We have a panel that DarkSakura and I will be on

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
I'm actually moderating it

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
Podcast Cross Zone 3

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
Really excited about that

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
And I totally forget the time and the moment

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
I can't remember if it's Friday or Saturday night

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
But we are actually going to be there

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
And DarkSakura and I still have to figure out how this is even going to work

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
VOG Network, if you haven't heard

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
Is a sponsor of GX3

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
We helped pitch in for the Kickstarter

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
I've always been a fan

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
Of this concept

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
So we pitched in

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
For people somewhere at the convention

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
So this is, I believe

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
The first time

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
Maybe because Bobby has done some of those Atlanta meetups

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
But this is going to be the first time

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
We've actually had a table at a show

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
And you can come by and say hi

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
And we're going to figure out

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
I don't know if we're going to have a classic game available

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
Or if we're actually going to be recording bits

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
For use on air

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Which I think is going to be a big part of what we're doing

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
We're working on a top secret project behind the scenes

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
So we're going to be doing a lot of interviews

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
And nerds alike

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
Getting their viewpoints

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
So we'll be there at GX3

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
That's in San Jose December 11th and 12th

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
That weekend

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
I also take bribery in the form of fan art of my characters

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
In Dragon Age

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
There you go

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
Bobby Blackwell says

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
We've never had a table

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
And using that in quotes

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
We've actually had to turn down tables out there

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
Because I'm only one person and don't want to be tied to a table

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
The good news is

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
We're going to have more people

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
I know myself and DarkSoccer are going to be there for sure

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
And we might enlist the help of some of our friends

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
To help us man the table

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
Or we'll man the table

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
Or whatever the table when we're not there

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
So we'll work on it

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
Anyhow, that's all I have to announce

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
We are ready to get into some news

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
So let's start it off

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
With what's going on in the gaming world this week

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Loki

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
So Microsoft has purchased Havoc Physics

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
The middleware

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
For calculating physics and animation

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
From Intel and they've used it on a bunch of their games

55:38.000 --> 55:40.000
So what's this mean?

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
Don't know yet

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
But I know that one of the big games that uses that

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
That's coming up soon will be Crackdown 3

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
And of course they've used it recently

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
In Destiny, Dragon Age

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
Inquisition, Call of Duty, Advanced Warfare

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
A lot of the major games end up using that

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
And

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Basically they've

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
Asserted that they're going to continue to innovate

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
For the benefit of the

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Development partners and part of this innovation

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
Will include building more complex

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
More complete

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
Cloud service

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Which they're kind of demonstrating

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
With Crackdown 3

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
Having everything fully destructible

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
So

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Is this going to create interesting scenarios

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
Where the Havoc Engine might be used

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
On a Playstation game and I know I've seen that happen

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Before

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
I don't know if they're going to lock it down to just one

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
Platform and stuff, I think it's just another revenue

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Source for them

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
Maybe more of a thing to kind of

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Sell their servers

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
And stuff like that

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
I don't know

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
I hope not

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
That would be kind of dickish

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
Tigerclaw in chat says

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
Havoc has been in a lot of games

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
That we played

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Havoc is out there a lot

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
I think if they did lock it down that there would probably

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
Be an alternative that would come about

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Gotcha

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
That's true

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Somebody will inevitably

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Copy it I suppose

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Just like all those Minecraft clones

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
Except Minecraft still exists on so many platforms

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
And they're still supporting it

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
Just because Microsoft owns it

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
Doesn't mean they'll cut off support completely

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
They know where the money is

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
As many platforms as possible

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
What meme in our chat is saying

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Gotta say Xbox is killing it

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
Since Phil Spencer took over

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
You know I agree

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
I totally do

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
I don't know if I would go so far as to say killing it

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
But definitely like

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
Turn that shit around

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
Would be maybe the phrase I would use

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
Because I'm sorry

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
But it was not going well under

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
Don Mattrick and I'm sure he's a fine person

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
And I hope I don't miss out on a potential

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Coffee date someday because of my big mouth

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
But I'm just saying

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
All that razz on the

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
Xbox one

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
Was under his leadership

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
But yeah when Phil Spencer took over

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
Focusing on the positive

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
You know you really sense that turn around

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
And one thing I really enjoy about Phil Spencer

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
Is that he kind of admits

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
About the competition, you get the sense

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
From Phil Spencer that he plays games

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
Like he is a gamer

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
He plays games, okay yeah he's a business guy too

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
But like he'll acknowledge like yeah

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
Sony, Nintendo, doing good stuff

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
You know we're trying to offer our own stuff

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Over here that we think is really good

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Each generation has their kind of fails

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
I mean there's PlayStation 3 kind of

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Botched the launch

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
You know Xbox One

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
Sort of botched the launch at first

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
But so did PlayStation 3

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
PlayStation 3 as I mentioned

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
And then Wii U

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
That's true

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
Everybody gets their turn at the fuck up table

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
But everybody

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
Does awesome things too

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
As much as we razz the companies

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
When they do things not so well

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Things should get called out when they're done well too

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Even with Wii U

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
I know a lot of Nintendo fanboys would fight me

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
And with good reasons because there are

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
A lot of great

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Exclusive experiences on Wii U

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
And in fact I was just asked the other day

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
About what console should I get

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
And I said did you consider Wii U

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Did you give it some serious consideration

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Because you know there's some great games on it

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
And maybe you'll decide well it doesn't have Call of Duty

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
So I don't really want it

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
But you know you gotta at least consider it at this point

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
So anyway sorry we went on a tangent

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Here over at live.vognetwork.com

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
Anyhow let's move on to another story

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Speaking of Wii U I swear this was not all set up

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
For a transition but

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Splatoon of course being one of those games

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
That are really swinging the people over to the Wii U

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
And apparently Splatoon has been hacked

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
Because you know what they say

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Because the hacker's gonna hack

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
Hack hack hack

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
Well apparently a Splatoon hacker

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
Was online and can like

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Screw up your save file

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
If your character won't load up when you're going

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
In the main plaza

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
And I guess it's like an

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
Octoling that will carry

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
The Hydra Splatling

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
So obviously it's a hacker because the thing hasn't released

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Yet and what happens to get

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Around this don't leave the room until

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
They're gone because returning

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Back to the base is what screws up the save

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
File and there's a character in the game

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Whose name is K and it has numbers in it

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
But nobody's gotten the full name

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
But you worry that something like this is

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Probably spread around

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Pretty quickly so

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Be careful

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Some folks actually found out that it's kinda

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Easy to play as an Octoling in

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Online matches

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
There's a whole YouTube video that walks you through

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
It that you do a text modification to the player

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
ID in the save file

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
I'm obviously not gonna get into the details here

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I'm just gonna say it's out there

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
But I guess this is all gonna be

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Patched by the time the next Splatfest

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Comes out because that's when they'll do an update to the game

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
And certainly this is gonna get

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
This is gonna get sewed right up

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
So that doesn't happen anymore

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
By the way the theme has been announced for the next Splatfest

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Friday October 9th

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
At 9pm for 24 hours

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
It will be

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Planes versus

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Cars

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Do you prefer to travel by plane

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Or do you prefer to travel by car

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
I think it should be three teams

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Planes, trains and automobiles

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
There you go there's no team train

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Japan always does things differently

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Maybe they'll have team train

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Or Europe will get something else

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
But anyway I'm gonna be team plane

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Just because

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I like car trips too but you know

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Planes take me to places like Hawaii

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
That the car doesn't get me to so

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
I'm gonna be team plane for that one

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Just in case you wanna be playing with me

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
But keep in mind Rob you have to take the car to get to the plane

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
That is true

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Well you could take transit you could take a train to get to the plane

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
But you could also take a bus

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
You could

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Or a van

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
You could take the train to the plane that will take you to the rain in Spain

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
The automobile is more versatile

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
I would go with the automobile

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Yes but they don't serve you alcoholic

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Beverages in the automobile

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
In fact it's against the law

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
They don't know what I'm doing in the backseat

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
That's not true though

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
In limos they do serve you

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Hell yeah

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Yeah but it's not team limo

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Limo is a type of car so

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Whatever whatever alright

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Let's move on Dark Soccer what do you have for us

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
I have some crap

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Anyway

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
We all like our humble bundles don't we

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
And now we have the

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Humble Monthly Bundle

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Woo

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
So they are doing a

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
And I'm quoting a highly curated bundle

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Of favorite games once a month

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
It's gonna be

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
The Humble Monthly Bundle costs 12 bucks a month

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
And it will show games

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
That have been in the various weekly ones

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
And some that haven't been featured

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
And of course 5% of the subscription

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Goes to charity

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
So like right now

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
We have Legend of Grimrock 2

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
In there right now

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
You can just go to

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
HumbleBundle.com

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
monthly and have a look at it

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
I guess it shouldn't be too surprising

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
That you know with the Loot Crate

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
What the Dollar Shave

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Club There's a Pusheen one now

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Oh for Loot Crate

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
No not well Loot Crate

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
But it's a Pusheen

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Oh like a Pusheen of the Month Club

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
I remember when the Blank of the Month Club

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Was something that you would read about

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Speaking of planes like in SkyMall Magazine

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Or like just something they would

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Advertise on TV or the

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Columbia House get 12 CDs

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
For a dollar and then they're gonna send

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
You the CDs of the month and if you don't like them

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Send it back like it seems like that whole thing is

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Back like big time like it

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
If I could send the games back

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
You'd get different games because a lot of them I probably already have

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Yeah that's the one problem with Humble Bundle

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
But when you consider your charity

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
There's always a good element of it too

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
To throw in there

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Feel like you're doing a little bit of good with the games

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
I don't know I'll have to look into it

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
I might actually jump on this

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Might be a good way to force myself to play some games

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
That I wouldn't usually play

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Let's travel around the world and check out some

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Release dates some things that we'll be playing

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
A little sooner than

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Perhaps what is coming up in the Humble Bundle next month

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Starting in the US

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Loki

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Alright so starting off we've got

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Dragon Age Inquisition Game of the Year edition

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Yes the one on the DLC

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
I'll get another one

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
That's on Playstation 4 and Xbox One

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Here's your chance to get it on another platform

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
That could be that's what I do

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
No because I can't mod other platforms

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Disgaea 5

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Alliance of Vengeance on Playstation 4

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Dengeki

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Bunko Fighting Climax

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
On Playstation 3 and Vita

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Did you say Bunko Fighting Climax

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Yeah Dengeki Bunko

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Bunk that's the game my mom would play

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
That's with a C not a K

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.000
I'm like how do you do Bunko Fighting?

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Do the dice get up and attack each other?

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000
That's what I saw in my mind

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Bunko Fighters

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Grandma's gonna throw down

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Cause she didn't get the roll she wanted

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Sorry Loki

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
There's a little known game called Rock Band 4

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
That's coming out this week as well

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
On Playstation 4 and Xbox One

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
And if you want to get it with some instruments

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
They have all those available for you as well

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Transformers Devastation

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
The Platinum Games

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Transformers

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
That's coming out on Playstation 4

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
And Xbox One as well

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Ride on Playstation 4

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000
I guess Devastation is also on Playstation 3 and Xbox 360

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Farming Simulator 16 on Vita

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
I thought I've seen that before but I guess

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
It's been delayed again

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
Gotta wait for that

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Man

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
As if we're not in the fourth quarter already

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Alright

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
And then the next thing I've got

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Let's see

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Brace yourself winter is coming

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
And then finally on

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
I guess this is Sunday or Friday

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Chibi Robo Ziplash on 3DS

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
I think it's the one with the amiibo

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Oh yes they have one with an amiibo

01:05:56.000 --> 01:06:00.000
And then Uncharted the Nathan Drake collection on Playstation 4 is coming

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000
And Sid Meier's Civilization Beyond Earth Rising Tide

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
So that's an expansion for an expansion

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Oh no it's an expansion for the new game

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
That's right

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
And that's it

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Alright

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
By the way in chat over at live.vognetware.com

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Dark Tetsuya says Bunko Fighters

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Is that another dream game?

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Nah I don't think we could

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Officially put it on the dream game list

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
But if like YYR hears this

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
And like that's my next game

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
I'm not gonna complain

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
So I'm just saying

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Alright anyway

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Let's travel to Japan and look at the Playstation 4

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Where this week FIFA 16

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Gets its release in regular and deluxe edition

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
On October the 8th

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Also Grand Theft Auto 5 gets a price reduction

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
It moves into the best hit series

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
And the Uncharted collection is out this week

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
In Japan as well

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Moving over to the Wii U

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Nada

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
In fact their next release

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
I don't think they have anything until November actually

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
In Japan

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
For the Wii U so you might not be reading those dates

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
For a while

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
But on the Playstation Vita

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Actually this is the first week in a while we don't have anything on the Vita

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
We have a

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
Neptune vs. Zombie Gundam

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Gekkei Jigen Tag Blank

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
comes out next week

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
But that's on the 15th

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
So this is finally a quiet week on the Vita in Japan

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Could that be because

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
They're expecting a big reception to

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Guru Guru Chibi Robo

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
In regular and amiibo set over in Japan

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
That is releasing on October the 8th as well

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
I hear this is gonna be the last Chibi Robo game they do

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Well if it sells well

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Then of course they'll do another one

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
I think they kind of made that

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
I don't wanna say a threat but it was a threat

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Like on Twitter like you know

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Well if it doesn't sell well

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
I'm kind of fine with that

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Anyway also on the 3DS

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
A price reduction for Simogami Tensei 4

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
As it moves into the Atlas Best collection

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
So that is what you have to look forward to

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
In Japan this week

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Let's go over to the UK

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
With Dark Sakura

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
On October 6th we have Prison Architect

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
For Mac and for PC

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Blackband 4 comes out on

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Xbox One and Playstation 4

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Skyhill comes out on Mac and PC

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
And then on October 8th

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
We have Bridge Constructor Stunts

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
For Android

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
That's it

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Alright just a few more stories for you guys

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
And then the classic game of the week

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Loki?

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Alright I'm surprised well

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Bridge Constructor that's kind of what people do in that

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Anyways it just makes stunts so I'm surprised it took them this long

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
To actually release something like that

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Criterion

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
They're working on

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Possibly a successor to Burnout

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
And that makes me happy

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Because I want more Burnout

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
And this is coming from a Twitter conversation

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
They're saying you know

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
What they're working on

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Two things first the game is a multiplayer sports game

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Coming spring of 2016

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Which I remember that's that like

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
I think there's like an off-road

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Racing sports thing

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
That they've got coming

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
And then the other one

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
It says then we make a driving game

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
What sort of driving game you ask?

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
A spiritual successor

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
Speed traffic and crashing lots and lots

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Of crashing

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Yes please

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
That's what I need in my Burnout

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Game is just big fiery

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Car crashes

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
I don't understand why no one would fund

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Or like

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Put money towards another Burnout game

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
I mean come on

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
How well of these Need for Speed games have done

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Not very good

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I bet if they went to Kickstarter they'd get it

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
If it was like fucking Burnout and said Need for Speed

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Way better

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Alright

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Speaking of crowdfunding

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Maybe Criterion

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
And those employees aren't doing this

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
But Cave is thinking about it

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
You want some shooters on the Playstation 4

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Some more shooters

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Cave is thinking about

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Getting some crowdfunding

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
They're asking on Facebook

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Could we get $300,000 to $500,000

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
To do

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Actually that's the Steam port

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
But a million would allow them to do a Playstation 4 port

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
And they're saying for 3 million

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
They'll do a new game as well

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
To a console

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
So I don't know

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
That seems like an awful lot of money

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
But then again

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
If they're selling it for $20 a pop

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
They would have to get what

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
15,000 people

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
To get on board

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
That's a lot of money for

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I don't know

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
I can't imagine an arcade game

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Having that kind of budget

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
It would depend

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
On

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
It's also like how into

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
These types of games are you

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Maybe we say that we dismiss it

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Because we're not super into shooters

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
But you know some people really love their bullet hell games

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
I'm not even thinking necessarily the genre

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
I'm just thinking of how complex of a game it is

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
I mean yeah I understand there's bullet patterns

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
And all that stuff but really how much

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
How many art assets are you talking there

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
I mean the level design

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
I just don't see that as being a very in depth

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Game that would require 3 million

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Dollars to

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
Make another one of

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
I mean I just don't know

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Well that's fair

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Well we are going to take a trip down memory lane

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
With Dark Sakura

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
And Dark Sakura is going to step into the gaming vault

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
And find a game that she thinks

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
You kids should check out this game this week

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
It is the classic game

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Of the week with Dark

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Sakura

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
I think this is kind of an

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Obscure pick this week but I don't know that's just me

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
It was one of my favorites that I had

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Alright so what is the classic

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Game of the week this week?

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
The game is SNK Gals Fighter

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
It was a one on one

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Fighting game that

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Came out on the Neo Geo Pocket Color

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
In 2000

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
I played the stew out of this game

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Just because I really liked it and it was really funny

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
So this was for the

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Queen of Fighters tournament

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
That was organized by a Miss X

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Who is really

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Yori Yagami dressed up in drag

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
So that they could

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Win the K talisman that grants any

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
Wish so

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
It's really just like a little

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Sd fighter it's really cute

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
And it's very similar to how

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
The King of Fighters

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
R1 and R2 played but a little bit faster

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
So it was

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Honestly like I said one of my

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Favorite games ever that came out on

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
The Neo Geo Pocket Color

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
You could play as

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
Mai Shiranui from

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
Fatal Fury 2

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
You had Athena from Psycho Soldier

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Yuri from Art of Fighting 2

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Leona from King of Fighters 96

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Shirmi from King of Fighters 97

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Also the namesake of my cat

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Nakoru from Samurai

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Shiki from

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Samurai Shodown 64

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
And Akari from The Last Blade

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
You also had hidden characters

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
You had Whip and you had

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Yuki Kushinata who was

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Kyo's girlfriend

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
In King of Fighters 97 and it's the only fighting

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Game she's actually been playable in

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
And of course your boss is Miss X

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Who is Yori from

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
King of Fighters

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
So it was

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
I mean

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
There's not really so much to say about it

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
It is really just a

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
A little fighting game

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
But a lot of the little stuff

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
The you know attacks

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
In it were really just made comical

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
You uh

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
For a chibi pocket version

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Of the game cause you know a lot of the pocket

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Versions of fighting games were straight up

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Bad like if you played Mortal Kombat

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
On the original Game Boy it's really

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Bad but this

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
You know again I haven't played this

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
But this looks like okay

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
It's a chibi cartoony like you know

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Amped up silly I guess

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Version of the game but it looks

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
Surprisingly fluid for a pocket game

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Oh yeah it was really good

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
I mean it was surprisingly good

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
And you know

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Even with the limitations

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Of the system at the time it was

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Very solid I played

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
I probably played through this game for

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Until I beat it with everybody

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
And I always forget that

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Athena in this game is the same Athena

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
From the NES game

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
It's like a soldier

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Crazy

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
There it is

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
And that's actually the outfit

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
That she's wearing in that one

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
Is her King of Fighters 99 outfit

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
So there you go

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
That's all I have to say

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
This is the only version of this game ever that's been out

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
And it's just

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Really cute and very funny

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
So you get

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
You know little cameos

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
From some of the other characters of course

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
From the various SNK series

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
In endings and backgrounds

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
And whatnot

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
Well you know sometimes she picks

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
A mainstream game but sometimes she picks

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
A more obscure game that hey maybe you hadn't

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Heard of this and considering it was only on the Neo Geo Pocket

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Color I'm going to assume a lot of people

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
Probably never heard of this so there it is

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
SNK Gals Fighters

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
I didn't even know about this game

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
I love that she just drew a picture and now she's singing

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Karaoke as one of her moves

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Yeah if you want to borrow it

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Did Leona just strap dynamite to her?

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
Wow

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
She has the earring bomb but they changed it for the game

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
For this one

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
So it's just really cute

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
It's kind of fun

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
If you're interested in borrowing it I would be more than happy

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
To lend you a Neo Geo Pocket Color in the game

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Sweet

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Bring your own batteries

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
I like dark soccer she gives me stuff

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Which I still need to bring over some of my

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Super Famicom, not my Super but my

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
Actually I do have a few Super Famicom cartridges

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
And my Famicom cartridges

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
I don't even think I talked yet on the show

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
About what I bought, no that's okay

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
Because we'll talk about that at the start of part B

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Let that be our teaser

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
I have a few

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
We are going to take a break and we'll talk about that

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
We're going to talk about the FUGL Question of the Week

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Which has to do with multiplayer games

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Since we had Jackbox on tonight and they really

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Excel at doing those multiplayer games

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Thought we would have a question about that tonight

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
So we're going to talk that with you guys

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Your phone calls and 1877 game OLR

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
And emails which I think

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
There's quite a few emails tonight

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Dark soccer is going to be busy during the email segment

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Yay! So we'll get to all that

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
When we come back after this break with more

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Of Orange Lounge Radio right after this

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
Welcome back everybody

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
To Orange Lounge Radio

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
We are live tonight with our

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
616th episode, it's the second half

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
For this October the 4th

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
Of 2015 and I

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
Can't believe it's already October

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Where's this year gone? And 616?

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Didn't we just celebrate episode 600?

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
Oh my gosh where'd this year go

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
At least the good news is now that it's

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
October it is officially time

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
For Pumpkin All the Things

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
And I'm very excited about the Pumpkin All the Things

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Time of year

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000
You know I got my pumpkin spice latte

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.000
I love all of them actually

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:00.000
I had those pumpkin latte M&M's they were great

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000
You know what else is also a good season for?

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
If you happen to like that kind of thing

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Root vegetables

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Oh because this is the time of year where a lot of those

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Are in season and so forth

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Which pumpkin kind of is

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
Well we have an amazing cafe at work

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
And I'll just leave it here

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
I've been having some stomach problems so I haven't been able to

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Eat a lot of heavy crazy foods

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
They had one that was like rutabaga

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
And beets and parsnips and carrots

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
And everything and I am enjoying

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
Carrot ginger soup

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
Yeah ginger is amazing

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
It's a great spice

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
I feel weird calling it a spice but you know it's a great flavor

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
Well it's also really good if you

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Have stomach problems

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
I love ginger beer and you can't get it

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
At every store but like

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Bathmo

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Oh my god I have to tell you

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
This is completely off topic

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
That's okay we do that here at OLR and you the most

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
They're opening a total wine by my house

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Total wine gets frivolous

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Oh so you're going to be a total lush

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
Yep and I will get you ginger beer

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
When I go get my frivolous

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
My favorite is that there is a total wine

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
It's over by for you SAC people which is I know

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
A very small percentage of our audience

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
There's a big mall there's a total wine

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
Not far from there but the hilarious

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Thing on the back side of

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
The plaza the side that's by Chick-fil-A

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
For those that happen to know the area

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
No it says

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
On the sign still circuit city

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
How long

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Has circuit city been gone

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
And it's still on the sign

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
Where total wine is

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
That's the building they converted

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Oh my gosh drives me crazy

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
It's still in the shape of the big plug

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Who remembers the commercials

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
That was always the cool part of the store

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
But that one is the one they use for the Halloween

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Store right they rent out that building once in a while

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
I think so and it was also like stupid

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Prices or something I don't know

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
It's called stupid prices

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
It's a recent history

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
We're local there it is

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
Once in a while I'll get those tweets

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
That are like it's so weird to hear about

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
Local things on OLR I forget they're in my neighborhood

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
That actually happened to me on Tumblr by the way

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
I was posting I was like

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
Yeah we got like 10 minutes of rain

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
You know it was a few days ago and

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
I was like I wish we had more and then I tagged

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
At Sacramento and one of

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
The people who follows me is like oh my god

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
I live in Santa Clara

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Yeah and I can speak Bay Area too

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
That's the good news there's a lot of people there

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
I met my friend Brian the pagan

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Jew on

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Hi Free Looking Brian

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
But you know that's how I met my friend that way

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
And he and his husband

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Razi

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
But I feel fortunate through OLR

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
If we can have a cheesy moment for a minute

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
I feel fortunate through OLR that I do feel like

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
I know people

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
And I have acquaintances if not friends

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
Like in almost every major

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
City in America because

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Of you know Twitter

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Podcasting and things that have happened

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
Because of this show and I'm so thankful for that

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
Anyway not to get too warm and fuzzy

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
But it's just a reality it's how I feel

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
I can't help the feels

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
Let's land back into reality for a minute

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Here though because at the end of part A

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Dark Soccer was teasing this about Loaning Me

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Games so I suppose it's time we talk

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
About another big purchase I made today

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
I was really I needed retail

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
I didn't need retail therapy but it's one of those things that you don't

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Realize you need it until you're doing it

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
I bought a Retron 5 today

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
And I've been talking about doing that

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
For a while

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
But I finally did it today

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
And I did it because

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Well the Retron 5 will play the NES

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
The Super Nintendo, the GBA

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Famicom and

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
Genesis, did I say Genesis?

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
But those are the five

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Systems it does, sadly it will not do Neo Geo

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Pocket Color

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
It also will not do like

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
Super Game Boy and add on games

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
So because I do recall reading a review

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
Where it won't do Sonic and Knuckles

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Interesting

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
Like any of the add on type games

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
Well that's okay and part of the reason I did it

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
And I know there's mixed reviews on

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Retron I know I'm going into it with that

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
But the HDMI support

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
I think is pretty cool and

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Will help me a lot in streaming

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Wink wink nudge nudge

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
So that was you know and the price is actually

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Cheaper where I got it than it was on Amazon

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
And how often do you see that so

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Yeah and Tigerclaw on chat

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Even saying you need to do some games

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
For the Retron 5 on Twitch and that's the plan

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
And SSJ with that same comment

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
About the add on games

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
So yeah

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
There you go

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
And AkumaJP is reminding me

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
Not to mention international in regards to

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Our audience, that's true

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Like I actually

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
AkumaJP I feel fortunate that if I went to

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Japan some day

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
He could help me out in some of the culture shock

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
And getting to different places I needed to go

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Same thing if I were to ever

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
Go overseas into what we've

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Affectionately called on the other show

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Hoard House, Londonland or not

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
Londonland

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
With Raven and EJ

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
On Girls Gone Wow

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
And Syl from the Geek Card

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
And Razorbug and Robface and all the

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
People I know over there it's like

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
And Pika Uno could totally take me to Disneyland

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Although I hope they didn't

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Up the prices at Disney Paris

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Like they did here in the US

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
Recently because that sucked

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
The prices at Disneyland went up today

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Did you hear about that Dark Sakura?

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
There is no longer a premium pass at Disneyland

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Well Dan and I actually had a

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
Conversation about it

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Well prepare to pay a lot more money

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
If you're gonna get the passes

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Well part of the reason though is that the passes are probably cheap

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
When the parks weren't getting a lot of attention

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
Now that you know the Disney parks

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Are crazy popular

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
They can

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
I've heard that this is a move to

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Weed out the crowds

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
That's what we were saying

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
You would think wouldn't Disney want the crowds

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
But yes of course they do

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
But to a certain limit

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
And I think Disney has kind of hit that limit

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
When they have to turn people away

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
They've kind of hit the limit

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
I think that could be a big part of it

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
But anyway

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
We're getting a little bit off base

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
We're getting a little bit off base

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
But yeah

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
We will

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
I'm sure have to start a Disney podcast someday

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
When I can afford to go to Disneyland again

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Yet I say I can't afford Disneyland

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
And I'm like ooh I just bought a Red Tron 5

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
But Disneyland gets a lot more expensive than that

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
That won't even buy

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
That won't even buy

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
Like a two day park hopper anymore

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
When I spend on that Red Tron 5

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
I didn't see if they still have the SoCal discount

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
I didn't see anything about that

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
So we just need to talk to Marissa

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
I just want to be clear

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
I do love Disneyland

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
I love it and I miss it

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
I haven't been in over a year

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
But it's getting expensive yo

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
To do Disney

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
I really want to go before Big Thunder is gone

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
But still

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
I'm not going to be able to help it when they open Star Wars Land

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
I do want to see that

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
I'm not even that big of a Star Wars fan

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
But I just want to see how Disneyland does Star Wars

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
I want them to migrate the bucket of meat

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
Hopefully

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
I would think that would be a great fit at California Adventure

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
If they could do the bucket of meat

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
At some Wall-E themed place

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
So if they open Star Wars Land

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Does that mean they're going to move Star Tours

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
I don't know

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
I would think logically

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Yes you move Star Tours over there

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Have a new Star Tour and then you close the old one

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
And use it for something else

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
But a lot of Star Wars is already injected into Tomorrowland

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Because they're Star Tours

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
I believe I heard Space Mountain

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Is going to have a Star Wars type theme

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
No they can't

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
It's a rock and roller coaster

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
If it's a temporary thing

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
It's not permanent

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
Remember the rock and roller coaster

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
It's going to be like that

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
Dan and I were actually talking about

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
Maybe sometime in the next year or so

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Going to Disney World

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
So we can do Mission 1

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
Or Mission 2, whatever it's called

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
But then the Captain EO Theater

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
So how's Ingress in Disneyland?

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
Insane

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
There's like 500 portals in one park

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
And it's always constantly flipped

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000
That's a great place to just AP farm

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
I am loving this you guys

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Loki, within the scope of a week

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
Within the scope of a week has gone from

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000
I hate Ingress, you're dumb for playing it

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000
I just didn't get it

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.000
And I still don't really get it

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000
But it's kind of something to kill time

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
So how many portals do you think there are at Disneyland?

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
I love it

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
If I'm going to have to

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000
I don't normally go on the roller coaster

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000
So I have to have something to do while I'm sitting there

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Alright, I'm going to curb all the Disney chat

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Although Bobby Black Wolf is screaming in chat

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
And I say screaming because it's all in caps

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Come to Disney World instead

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
I've been giving that some serious thought

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
And if I could get the time away from work

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
I would love, love, love

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
To go to Dragon Con

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
I'm using my quotey fingers like really early

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
And go to Disney World on like Monday, Tuesday

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
And then go to Dragon Con

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
I would love to do that

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000
What I would like to do is fly into Orlando

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Or close to it

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Go to Disney World and then rent a car

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000
And drive up the Florida coast

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:03.000
And spend like another week in Mobile with my family

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000
And then come home from Mobile

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000
That would be perfect

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Bobby Black Wolf is saying two days isn't enough for Disney World though

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Good point, good point

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
Alright, anyway

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
We'll get into travel talk later

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
We got to get into some rapid fire news

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
So let's get to it

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
Traveling around quickly looking at what happened in the gaming world this week

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
With these quick stories, Loki

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000
I'm not surprised but Super Mario Maker has already sold a million copies

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.000
I mean it makes sense because it looked awesome

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:37.000
And they said already over 2 million courses have been made

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:40.000
And it's been played 75 million times

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
And I want DLC

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:47.000
I'm wondering if they do like a DLC pack that's like Zelda 2 Adventures of Link

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Because it is kind of side scroller

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000
It would be kind of nice to have like non-Mario themes

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
I don't know

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
Hopefully

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.000
I just have a feeling we've only seen the beginning of what they're going to do with Mario Maker

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Oh I think we have

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
If Splatoon and Mario Kart 8 are any example

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000
I'm loving this Nintendo that understands DLC

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
I never thought I'd say that but I really am

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
Yeah

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
And then along with that

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Speaking of community created things

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Battlefield 4 they have a new outbreak map that's coming out

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:23.000
That's being designed I guess by the community

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000
They've got

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
It looks kind of cool

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.000
It's like a jungle type environment

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:35.000
And you can drive boats on the river and stuff like that

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
So that's kind of cool

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Maybe a free update that will be coming out soon

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
And then

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Amiibos

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Nintendo is bringing back some of the more rare Amiibos

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Apparently the Captain Falcon, Fox, Greninja, Little Mac

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Lucario and Shulk are going to be coming back

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000
I may have picked up a Captain Falcon and a Little Mac

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000
We found the Fox by the way

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
The Fox McCloud

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Nice yeah

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
They are out there

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000
So those will be coming back

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000
Select retailers soon

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000
And then along with that there's going to be some new

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Animal Crossing Amiibos

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000
Including they've got

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000
Celeste

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.000
Mr. Rosetti, Kix and Blathers

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000
And I'm assuming those are going to be for

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000
I don't know

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
Rosetti is kind of fun

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Yeah some of those Amiibo I would have to have

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
What about Tom? Do they have Tom Nook?

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
I know they have his kids

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000
Timmy and Tommy

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000
But I don't know if they have

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000
They were annoying

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000
Here's the thing

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
I'm kind of not feeling the

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000
Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000
All the Amiibo stuff

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000
That's cool that Jamie likes it

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000
It seems like that would be more something like

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
For like

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
I don't know

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000
Animal Crossing

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
Like

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
Imagine if you will

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Instead of having random animals in your town

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000
You buy the Amiibos for the animals

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000
You want to live in your town

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Alright

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Anyhow we'll

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000
Keep on moving with some more stories here

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Because we can probably debate these Animal Crossing

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Amiibo for some time

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
I say this now that I'm not going to get any

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000
And then watch my shelf will suddenly

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Where did you get the Blathers from?

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000
I bought it because I could

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
They're out

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
No I meant for non-Animal Crossing

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
I don't know when that is planned

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
For non-Animal Crossing characters

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
I'd rather pick up a bunch of those

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Than just buying a bunch of the figures

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Alright

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
Moving on, speaking of Mario Maker

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Japan getting another piece

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Of DLC announced

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
We have yet to have one announced

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
But another character in Japan

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
It's Game Center CX's Arino

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Who will have the suit and tie

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
So again this is one of those

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000
Amiibo suits

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000
That's used in the 8-bit version of the game

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
You can't really use it in the other levels

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000
But that's still kind of cool

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
That's going to be some DLC

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.000
Can't wait to see what's coming out here

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.000
Do you think we'll get that here? Because I don't think we will

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:17.000
Well I'm kind of wondering if we will get that here

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Or at least some sort of update because

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
Aren't we going to be playing those levels

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Since we do play levels from Japanese players

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
I guess that's true

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000
So wouldn't we have those suits?

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000
That's a good thought I didn't think about

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000
That we could essentially play a Japanese level

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:33.000
That would have those suits whether they're out here or not

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.000
That's a very good point

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:37.000
Unless they're just going to filter those out for us

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.000
Oh yeah like maybe what is

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.000
The Game Center person for us

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000
Or for them will become a different personality for us

01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Well no I'm not

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.000
Oh maybe I don't know I just thought maybe

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Everybody with DLC here

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000
Maybe Jeff Keighley is going to be a suit in Mario Maker

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.000
Reggie Fils-Aime

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000
I would love that

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000
My buddy is ready

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000
I'm seriously

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000
Why didn't they put him in Smash

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000
I mean come on that would have been so perfect

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000
I missed out

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
You never know

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000
They make the Mii

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000
With Reggie a lot in the

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000
I don't want the Mii I want actually

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000
Reggie and the Mii is cool

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000
You can make whoever you want but like I want

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Actually to have officially

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
Supported Reggie in there

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Mii Fighters aren't good enough

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000
No it's not good enough

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Moving on

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
What used to be the Best Buy

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Theater in Times Square

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000
Which was also once the Nokia

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Theater it is now a Sony

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
Sponsored theater and so now

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000
It is the PlayStation Theater

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Not to be confused with a place

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000
That will actually like have PlayStation

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Experiences and so forth but being in

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
Times Square isn't that it's a theater

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:51.000
It will be live performances and

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
It will occasionally though have events that

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Will showcase Sony PlayStation

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
Type events and you can bet that if

01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:59.000
Sony has big announcements to make they may consider

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000
Using this in New York City

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000
So we'll see

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000
You can also see that the official PlayStation

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Twitter account actually tweeted some pictures of the

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000
Inside of the theater looks very

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:11.000
Nice in there let's hope this branding sticks

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.000
They have a guy from

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:15.000
Doing No Man's Sky you know kind of the spokes works in there

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
On

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:19.000
Colbert's show and

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.000
He had a PewDiePie

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
On his show

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
One of the things that he was saying though

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
He's all

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Is this game coming out soon?

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Because it's got to be coming out soon if you're on my

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000
Show so I'm wondering like

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000
If they're going to be announcing something soon

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Because it is true they've been doing

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000
The whole

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000
They've been doing that ever since

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
E3 and stuff but they've been doing talk show

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Circuit where they're showing off the game

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:47.000
It's kind of usually

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
Yeah I thought it was supposed to be this holiday

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000
That that game was out

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:53.000
Maybe surprise would be

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:55.000
I'd like a surprise please

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000
Speaking of not to be too tangenty

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000
But apparently Colbert

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
Had PewDiePie on

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:03.000
And very respectful

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Sort of interview but in the Colbert way

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Colbert still took his digs

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
In the way only he can do

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.000
But a lot of people comparing and contrasting

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.000
To how Jimmy Kimmel kind of came off

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:15.000
Like an uninformed ass

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Which is also his shtick

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
I mean being an ass

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
Is kind of how he got famous from the man show

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
I mean right because that was his first

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
Big show was the one he did with Adam Carolla the man show

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
And they were kind of asses on that show

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
And that was what it was

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
But anyway people really

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
Giving kudos to Colbert and I got to say

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
I haven't watched a lot of episodes of his show

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
But I've always loved Stephen Colbert

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
And you know my love of Stephen Colbert

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
I watch a lot of the highlights thankfully

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
To the internet because I don't stay up to watch

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
Those shows but like I watch a lot of the highlights

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
And yeah I mean he's doing a great job

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
There's yeah and

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
I might be partial because I've loved him ever since

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
Strangers with Candy and even a little bit of

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
Exit 57 so I think it's cool that

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
They really do need to have Strangers with Candy come back

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
I don't think it can now

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
Why?

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
I don't know oh Bobby Blackwolf correcting me

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Kimmel's first big show is

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
Win Ben Stein's Money I forgot about that

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
That's right

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Oh yeah

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
That was before the Man Show I think it was

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Was he the first host though?

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
I thought they had a woman on but maybe she was later

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Because he wasn't always

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
The host of Win Ben Stein's Money

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
That came later wasn't it?

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
That show was awesome Yeah that show was a good show

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
I gotta say I need more Ben Stein

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
Where is Ben Stein?

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
He started going really political

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
He kind of went down that Margaret Cho route

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Where she got less funny and more political

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
And I think that's kind of what happened with Ben Stein

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
So I don't know

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
Bobby Blackwolf says

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
That Ben's doing Clear Eyes ads

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
And Mega Man X400 says

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
The best game show host

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
Was the mean British lady

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
On weakest link

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
Anne Robinson

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Yes

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
Which village is missing their idiot?

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
It's time to find out

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
Who is the weakest link?

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
Goodbye

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
That show is so fucking rad

01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:08.000
Why is that gone?

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
Have you seen

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Because we have basic cable

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
And occasionally I turn it on TV

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
Because I don't actually watch TV I just get it

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
Because it's $10 cheaper with cable for some stupid reason

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
So we have basic cable

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
And occasionally I'll turn it on and see what shows

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Are on and there's like this game show

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
With a bomb and so you have to

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
Answer these questions and the answer is

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Whatever when you cut and if they get it wrong

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
They get sprayed with some sort of

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
It's yogurt

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
It's dog urine

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
It's like really disgusting

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
Stuff

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
It was on Fox and I think it did so horribly

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
They moved it to one of the off brand

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
FX or something

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
It wasn't even that it was on one of the local channels

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
Because that's all I get

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
Maybe Fox kept it

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
I haven't watched TV in a while

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
What happened to TV?

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
Fox cancels Firefly

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
But keeps the bomb blowing up

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
Rabbit poop in people's faces

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Firefly is too intelligent

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
For the audience that is Fox

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
So that's why

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
They have to

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
Put that crap on there

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Hey rapid fire news

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
Where we talk about this news rapidly

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
And don't go on tansions

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
Hey Google and Microsoft

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
I'm sorry Rob have you met us?

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
No

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
Who are you people and what are you doing in my house?

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
Google and Microsoft

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Hey they used to be going

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Head to head to each other over different patents

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
Because you know everybody loves to fight about patents

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
But Google and Microsoft

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Agreeing to a truce

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
There were 20 lawsuits

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Between the two companies

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
They have all been

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Settled essentially

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Ending the five year dispute

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
This has to do with phones

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Xbox video playback

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Now they're going to actually come together

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
And on certain patent matters

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
They will actually brand together

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Building a royalty free video format

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
That prevents these legal skirmishes

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
In the future

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
So that's always nice to see people resolve their differences

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
And all this patent

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Crap get weeded out

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
That's nice

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
How about you Dark Soccer what do you have?

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
Eh nothing I give up

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
No I'm kidding

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Stop

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
So Nvidia has decided to rebrand

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
Grid

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
All in capitals as Geforce now

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
So basically it's their version of cloud gaming

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
To give you 1080p

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
60 frames per second

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
60 frames per second gaming

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
Over the internet blah blah blah

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
So yeah rebranding that's all

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
If you see a change that's why

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
Also the game

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
That pretty much started it all when it comes to fighting games

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Is

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Now on Playstation Network

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
It's karate champ

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
So I mean how's that

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
For a slice of 1984 right?

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
That takes me back to Straw Hat Pizza

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
Straw Hat Pizza

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Which is still around I guess

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Which I've never been to

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Really? Yeah

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
It's not bad but they used to be everywhere and then they just kind of fizzled

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Do you think there's good pizza in Alabama?

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
No

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
I bet you'd be surprised

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Didn't you say there was like a sushi place you loved in Alabama?

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
I thought there was

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Yeah but they opened it like well after I moved

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
Did you know there's a place

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Sorry to do tangents but that's what we do here at OLR

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
Since I've been informed

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Did you know that there's a sushi place

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
Near here called Nemo Sushi

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
And the little logo

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Is actually an orange fish

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
That has white stripes on it

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
And I'm like

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
I could go there and eat little Nemo

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
Why would you call your restaurant

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Why would you call your restaurant

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
Nemo Sushi

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
You're gonna eat Nemo

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
See I would've if I was gonna do one called Nemo Sushi

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
It would be a little boy in pajamas

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
And you could sit on beds and eat sushi

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Fair enough, alright sorry

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
I still want to go to that Ninja Sushi

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
I apologize for the tangent

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
But it was important

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
This tangent was brought to you by fish

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
I'll never forget we went to a place called Taka's Sushi

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Just because we were like

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
Because of the name BeatMania2DX LOL

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
I don't even know if that place is still there

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
They have the sakura roll which I had to eat

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
You had a sakura roll at Taka's Sushi

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
A sakura roll

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
So anyway

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
There's been leaks

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Of new Street Fighter 5 characters

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
There's one called Lara

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
And I'm trying to

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
It was actually shared by

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
Famitsu

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
But I'm trying to see exactly what her style is

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
It looks like she's a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
And then

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
There was also announced

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Nekali and Rashid

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
And then they also confirmed

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Zangief

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Yay, Street Fighter 5

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Excellent

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
Done

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
Alright well then let's go to our

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
FOOGLE question of the week

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Each week we take Facebook

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
And Google Plus and we slam those

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Words together and you get FOOGLE

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
Of course you can follow us

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
At Facebook.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
Or Google.com slash

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
Plus OrangeLoungeRadio

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
And tonight we thought we would ask

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
About multiplayer games

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
Since you know Jackbox Games

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Was on the show tonight

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
And they specialize really in multiplayer party games

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
We thought we'd ask about your favorite

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
Multiplayer game to have people

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
All in one place to play

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
And we were really looking for

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
In one room type of stories

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
Because yeah you can play everything online today

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
Including you know the Jackbox games

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
But I think it's

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Kind of fun to talk about having people

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
Over and getting the party on that way

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
So let's go to Facebook

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
Where Master Claw starts us off tonight

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Saying Super Smash Brothers Melee

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Mario Kart 64 and GoldenEye 007

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Saw the most couch multiplayer

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
In my house

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
I haven't had many friends IRL since then

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Aww that's sad though

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
You always answer our questions

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
If you listen to this show you must be a good guy

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
You should have lots of friends IRL

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
Maybe you just don't have friends that play video games

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
But you'd be surprised

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
I'm sometimes talking to play Mario Kart with you

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Bryce H. replies

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
And says Mario Kart 8

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
And Just Dance

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
See I don't, so people

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Really do the Just Dance with lots of people around

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
I would think I'd be a little scared to do that

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
Oh come on you did the Abba Dance

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
With me and Tiara

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
That was a private moment

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Tiara was here wasn't she?

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
That was a private moment

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
I was a private dancer

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
You weren't dancing for money

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
I didn't know that was anything except a laugh

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
Didn't I get sushi? I don't know

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
I don't know

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
Degenerate Johnny says

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
Although I would have loved to say We Dare for the Wii

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
I couldn't find good swinger couples

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
To play with me, Sy

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
So I guess I'll have to stick with Super Smash Brothers

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Oh Degenerate Johnny

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
Ragenator says

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
When I was in college

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
My college campus had a 4 slot Neo Geo MVS

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
A few of us really got into playing the crap

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Out of Samurai Shodown 4

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Amakusa's Revenge

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
Granted only 2 people could play at a time

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
In terms of non-video gaming

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
I used to love Magic the Gathering the actual card game

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Sadly I can't afford to constantly get new cards

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
Nowadays plus card shops are a pain to get to

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
For my neighborhood anyway

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
So I have to settle for the Steam incarnations of Magic

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
You know I was wondering if somebody would reply with an arcade game

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Because you know

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Arcade games were definitely a multiplayer experience

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
All in the same place many years ago

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:36.000
Hence how Dark Sakura, Loki, and myself met

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
Actually was playing DDR

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
I wonder if anybody said DDR

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
So I guess maybe dance games would be included

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Didn't I just say just dance?

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
That must be a thing with age

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
In my 20s I must not have been as inhibited as I am now

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Alright Silent Tom

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Says my favorite multiplayer game

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
Is the best of the Rock Band games

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
I get

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
Excuse me Rock Band games

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
A game my wife, her and her best friend and her hubby have

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
Get together and have some drinks

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
And have a great time

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
And ER also saying Rock Band

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
Back in college we played that game a ton

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
We also played a lot of fighting games

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
Which just aren't the same online

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
SSG100Matt says my friends and I

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
During my middle and high school years

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Would always play the Mario Party games together

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Primarily Mario Party 2

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
We played the hell out of that game

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
And would always get into playful arguments

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
About setting off Bowser parades

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Star stealing and coin stealing

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
We also had developed calluses on the palms of our hands

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
And had several broken N60 games

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
To be fair those things are really easy to break

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
Hitstun says nothing beats a big game of Bomberman

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
It's easy to pick up and play

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
So it's great for parties

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
It's about time we get a Bomberman game on current consoles

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
Who owns that IP now?

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
Oh yeah

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
It's Konami

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
Nevermind

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
What you weren't a fan of Bomberman Zero

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Or whatever that was on the

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
Oh god

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Anyway

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
Dark Tetsuya says

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
I'm gonna say Para Para Paradise

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Because even though it wasn't technically multiplayer

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
If you get a bunch of nerds in a room

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
That know the routine to a given song

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
They're all probably gonna do it

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
In blatant disregard to the sign

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Forbidding such activity

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Okay you're right I was totally wrong on what I said about dancing

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
Yeah it's hilarious when they

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
Forbid that type of thing it's like what is this

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
Footloose or something?

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
Dancing is foreboden

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
Here at Golfland

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
Lastly on Facebook

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
MegamanX400

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
Our pal from Video Game Realness

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Podcast says

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
Hands down the game my friends and I have played the most

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Even since high school has been Smash Brothers

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Each iteration has provided

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
Hours of replayable fun

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
As everyone's skill levels improved

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
We all shifted over time and performance

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
So it kept things interesting and competitive

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
For us

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.000
Those are the answers from Facebook

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
But let us not forget Google Plus

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
Where we have ActDeft saying Super Smash Brothers

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
They never failed to deliver

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
On the local multiplayer department

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
Retertainment says

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
Seen it since all you really needed to play it

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:06.000
Was a DVD player

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
Oh god they really drilled that series

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
Into the ground though with all the scenes

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
Have you seen the Twilight seen it?

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
That's nothing but trivia questions

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
On the Twilight games oh lord

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
Sent it on fire

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
And lastly

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
MartinD replies and says

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
Maybe a weird answer here but probably

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Tekken 3 is still the game I played

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
The most with my friends back in the day

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
A lot of fun

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Also any FIFA game is a lot of fun to play

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
Against friends not really into the party games

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
I don't think Tekken 3 is a weird answer

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
Irene and I used to play the shit out of that game

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
And it was all about Panda

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
I worked in an Amco arcade when that was out

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
I still am proud of the day

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
That I went in and the guys had been there

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Like almost all day practicing King

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
And I decided to just take

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
You know go back and forth with Jen and Julia

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
On the left

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:56.000
AkumaJP giving an old school answer

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
In our chat room saying

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
If it doesn't have to be multiplayer my friend and I

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
Played the shit out of Shinobi on the Genesis

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
4 person turn by turn

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Yeah I mean

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
Sometimes a multiplayer gaming experience

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Was passing that controller around

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
And everybody kind of doing the part of the game

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
That they're best at or you suck

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
And can't get past this part let me take care of it

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Bomberman 2 with the multitap

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
On the SNES

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
That was pretty awesome

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Yeah they really haven't had a new one in a while

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
The last one I can think of was that

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
They had one on the Xbox 360

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
And I think it was on PlayStation 3 as well

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
But not zero

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
Not zero there was like on the network

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
Nintendo network

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
The online download

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
Yeah there was Bomberman live

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
Alright

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
Anyhow that does it for the Fugu question of the week

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
But we've got some more news and your phone calls

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
Here in a little while

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
In the meantime Loki

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
Yeah so it kind of makes me wonder you know with

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
You know the decision for

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
Konami going into this whole

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
More so into the Pachinko

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
And you know on mobile games

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
Division maybe it's not the greatest thing

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
Sega, Sammy for example

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
They're cutting 200 jobs

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
In its Pachinko division

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
Based on poor sales

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
So

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
They're putting, soliciting voluntary retirement

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
For 200 jobs

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
And I guess they're saying that there was

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
An extraordinary loss

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
And that basically

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
The poor sales of

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
Pachinko machines like

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Pachinko slot

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
Hokuto no Ken Tomo

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
Or Fist of the North Star

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
And Bayonetta's Pachinko slot

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
Not even hitting half the sales

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
They were expected to

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
I hope Bayonetta isn't

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Like gone forever

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
I have this really bad feeling it is

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
I'm going to try not to think negative thoughts

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
And just hope that she shows up in Smash Brothers

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
And gets an amiibo

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
But I just feel like it's not going to happen

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
So I guess there isn't

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Tons and tons of money

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
Could it be over saturation of the market?

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
I mean because I can't imagine

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
Well I don't know

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
There's probably a ton of Pachinko slot

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
Parlors or arcades or whatever

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
In Japan so

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
Do they maybe have too many?

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
I mean I don't know

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Why it wouldn't perform as well

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
Alan Alchemy in chat over at

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
Live.FogNetwork.com says

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
They need to port Bayonetta to PC

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
God damn it

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Maybe the first one

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
But the second one they can't

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
That game would not have happened if not for Nintendo

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
And I don't see Nintendo

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
I mean unless there's something in the contract

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
Where like after five years they can do it

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
Like maybe what happened was Zombie U

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
And I still believe we can

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
Yeah so anyway

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
Moving on

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
Let's get to another story here

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
Although a masked bishop joined our chat room

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
Apparently just to say Bomberman 64 was amazing

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Oh yeah the old school Bomberman's were all awesome

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
But then Bomberman 0 happened

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
And we all wondered what the hell happened

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
Alright anyhow

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
Let's move on to some updates on the

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
Xbox One console

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
You know PlayStation 4 got its big update

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
And I know Xbox One's right around the corner

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
It's supposed to be the big backwards compatibility one right

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
But also some other features that are

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
Supposed to be in the Xbox One update

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Cortana was originally

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Going to I believe be a part of this

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
However will not

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Be making a debut until

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
Early next year

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
According to Major Nelson

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
Unfortunately that is not going to be a part of this

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
Roll out however

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
Folks in the dashboard preview program later

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
This fall will be able to actually use

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
Cortana but I gotta be honest

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
I don't ever use this voice search

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
Stuff it doesn't seem to work

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
And I can't get the microphone to work on my laptop

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
So it's just like normally I do that

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
If I don't want to find Photoshop

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
Digging through the menus I just type Photoshop

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
Really I've never had any problem

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
With Siri

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
I wasn't going to use it anyway

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
Siri's a little different because you know that's in the palm of your hand

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
And that is I will say that's convenient

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
For Siri's going to be on the Apple TV

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
Remind me in 20 minutes I don't think

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
I would ever use it on Apple TV to be honest

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
But I do use Siri for

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
Remind me in 20 minutes to check the oven

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
I use Siri to text you from my watch

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
Do you really? Yeah I do

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
When I'm on my way to the show I'll just tell Rob

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
This and then I even have my punctuation

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
But see those are all portable

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Things and just on something

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
That's on your like set top

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
Box I don't see a lot of use for it

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
I will say the thing that Apple

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Is doing and maybe Microsoft's doing this

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
With Xbox One I don't realize it

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
Is that the Apple thing will

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
Tell you this movie's on Hulu

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
Or this movie's on Netflix and so on

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
That's useful because there's so many freaking services

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
Now I don't know what movie is where

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
Like where do I get to watch old

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
Episodes of Strangers with Candy with Stephen Colbert

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Because it's not on Netflix but it is on Hulu

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
That type of search is really useful

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
That's actually going to be on Apple TV

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
Right that's what I'm saying that's one thing that I think will be

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
Good on Apple TV but I don't

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
Think it's planned for Microsoft's

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Thing if it is then I guess that's something

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
I might use I like I just turned on

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
The microphone just for the fuck of it to see if

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
You know what would happen with

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
Cortana and he said there is

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
An eclipse try to open something

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
I'm like I don't know what you

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Cortana just told you there's an eclipse

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
Yeah so there's an eclipse period and it's like

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Trying to open something I'm like okay

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Thank you for that information tell her to divide by

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
Zero and see if she makes funny like Siri does

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Alright anyhow also

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
Some things that have been added to

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
The Xbox beta app in

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Windows 10

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
So this is kind of related

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Party text chat available for the

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Xbox beta app members

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
Reading and replying to messages directly from

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
Notifications

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Alert activity alert notifications

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Like if somebody else is on Xbox

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Add you as a friend or whatever

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
And then activity feed sharing you can share within

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
The activity feed so

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
Cool

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Some additions there to Xbox

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
And I'm sure the

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Big software update for everybody

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
I think that was supposed to go live in October right?

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
With the big backwards compatibility and all that

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
I think that was coming up very soon

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
Alright meanwhile Dark Soccer what do you have for us?

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
Actually I was talking to

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
Ikuma JP real quick

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
And I had like a total brain translation error

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
But

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
But

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Siri would be Shiri

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
In Japan which means butt

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
So I wonder if you'd be like

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
Hey butt

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
Hey butt you're a butt

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
I'm just

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
Trying to help

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
You can friend my butt

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
Anyway

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
So Twisted Pixel

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
We know them right?

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
Splosion Man

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Well you know that they

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
Were acquired by Microsoft in

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
2011 well they're going solo

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
They have

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
Had an amicable split

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
And they are going

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
On to expand their relationships

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
They're going to see other companies

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
They're going to

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
Be a poly

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
Poly gaming

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
They want to live the life of a single company for a while

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
They're gonna be swinging

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Do those things they didn't get to experience five years ago

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Exactly so they've had an

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Enrollment

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
Of sorts I guess

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
They still had to work with the prenup

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
But you know

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
That means Splosion Man on Playstation 4 soon enough right?

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
Maybe

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Could be

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
But

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
The Microsoft General Manager

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
John Needham said

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
I can't wait to see what this talented team creates next

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
And that's it

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
We'll see

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Alright

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
Logie

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
Alright so in October

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
We're going to be getting some

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
New Playstation Plus games

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Including Broken Age

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Super Meat Boy

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
On Playstation 4

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Playstation 3 Beginning Chariot

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
Kickbeat, Kung Fu Rabbit

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
And also Unmechanical Extended

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
And Vita, Broken Age

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
Kickbeat, Kung Fu Rabbit

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
And Super Meat Boy

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Also in October

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
The Drive Club

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
Demo or whatever that was

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
Will be leaving as well

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
So be sure to download it

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Before October 6

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
And then

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
Along with that

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Wait why are they getting rid of it?

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
That seems so weird

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
There was this big hype up about the

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
Release of Drive Club on Playstation Plus

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
It was something they had launched

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
Took forever to get

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
And now they're going to pull it?

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Was it that bad?

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
I thought

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Some people really enjoyed it

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
But I found it hard to play that

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
After playing Forza Horizon 2

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
No thank you

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
And then along with that

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Of course Super Meat Boy is going to have

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
Different music though on Playstation 4

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
And the Vita release

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
That's just because

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
The original

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Audio designer has decided

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
Not to license the music for the new versions

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Of the game so they're going to be getting other

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Music

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
For the game

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
There sounds like some very interesting

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
Drama there because you know they're not

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
In specifics but it's very much

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
Like a I'm not going to work with them

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Again type of thing

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Very interesting drama there

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
They're basically replacing the soundtrack

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
They have different musicians

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
Including

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Some of the artists that worked on

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
The Binding of Isaac, Rebirth

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
Hotline Miami and Plants vs. Zombies

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Hotline Miami

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
Had a sick soundtrack though

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
It would be kind of cool to hear how it

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
It's going to be weird

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
I kind of thought some of the best

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
Stuff in Super Meat Boy was the music

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
The music was so good and fit the game

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
Not to say that the new soundtrack

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
Will be bad it's just

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
It's going to have big shoes to fill

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
It's going to almost feel like a different game

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
It's going to be a very interesting kind of

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
I don't know

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
Experiment

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
I guess for lack of a better word

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
In how important is the soundtrack

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
To a game

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
We'll see

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
The games will be up for download

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
On October 6th

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
I could also see

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
That maybe the whole social aspect

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
And the fact that the game will be shared everywhere

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Maybe the guy

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
I don't know maybe it's just more of a personal thing

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
Between him and the other makers

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
I don't necessarily want to make stuff up

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
The fact that that music is going to be streamed everywhere

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
It has been streamed everywhere for a long time

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
I guess that's true

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
There's a lot of YouTube videos with all that

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Alright

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Well moving on it's a little bit of a slower news week

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
So we're having to dig deep a little bit here

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
So we're talking about website launches tonight

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
But I think this is interesting

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
It's about a topic I think a lot of people

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Have an opinion about certainly

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
And that is game reviews

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
And you guys know Metacritic

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
And Metacritic is often controversial

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
Well there's a new site

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
That's been launched this week

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
That's picking up some exposure on some gaming blogs

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
Called Open Critic

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
And Open Critic is

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
Trying to focus on video games

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
But they're doing some different things with it

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Such as they'll be just a simple score average

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Not weighted differently from different websites

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
And apparently you can actually

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Go in there as a user and whitelist

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Different outlets

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
To only see reviews from

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
So that way if you think a particular

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Website is shit

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
And you don't like their reviews

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
You can just basically

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
Blacklist them and they don't actually show up in the scores

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
That you see

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
And that's a very interesting concept

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
Because even with movies it's like

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:37.000
Well maybe you agree with Cisco but you don't agree with Ebert

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Type of thing you know

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:41.000
Or whoever the, who do they have these days

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.000
There's nobody that compares to Cisco and Ebert now

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:45.000
Is it Roper and some other dude

01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:47.000
But anyway you know there tends to be

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Probably certain outlets that you agree with more than others

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000
You know like vognetwork.com

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Wink wink

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:55.000
Anyhow

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:57.000
It's going to be interesting to see how that goes

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Also apparently one other big twist

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Is going to be displaying non-numerical scores

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Because

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
You know some websites have said

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
We're no longer giving games a score

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
And so open critic is still somehow

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
Going to rate that

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
I don't know if that's using words

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
Or how they're going to do that or if they're just

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Assigning a score based on how the review reads

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
That could be very interesting and controversial

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
But anyway I thought that was just

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Worth bringing up

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Not that I usually will give these websites

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Free plugs but

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
I do often times have conversations about

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
You know the importance of video game reviews

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
Is Metacritic helping or harming

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
The developing of games because we've heard about

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
The whole bonuses tied to Metacritic scores and all that

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
So it's interesting that somebody wants to

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
Come in and shake that up a little bit

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
So

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Very interesting

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
Alright

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Let's move on with the mailbag

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
Tonight Dark Soccer

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
Going to dive into the mailbag

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Head first and pull out some emails

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
That she believes are worthy of reading

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
On the show, there's actually quite a bit

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
So I should shut up and let her get to it but I will say

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
If you want to email us for a future week

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
You know I was just told today

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
That on the Facebook

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
The email address has been wrong for like

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
How long ago did we switch the email address?

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
I don't know

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
I totally forgot to change Facebook, it has now changed

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
If you see the wrong email floating around out there

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
Please let me know, I'll fix it

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Whatever the

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
I've got an email

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
That I think is in

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
Braille?

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
Oh yes, I saw

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
That one, there's like a bunch of coded

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
Text or whatever

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
We don't, do we

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Do we have a cipher or something

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
To crack the code?

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
Nope, moving on

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
I guess unintelligible

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
Garball is what we got for an email this week

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
I'll

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
See if I can look at it later this week and translate it

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
But it better be good, I swear to god

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
If I translate it, it's like

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Oh my god, Becky, stop sending me pictures of cookies

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Is she listening?

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
No, I just messaged

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
I just put on Facebook, Becky cookies

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
And she's like, well I'm actually making some right now

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
And I'm like, I'm coming over after the show

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
If I translate that message and it's butt butt fart

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
I'm going to be very upset, I'm just saying

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
I will be

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
But if it's butt fart fart

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
Then we're fine

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
I just wanted to say hey butts

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
Hello LR

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
It's your friendly neighborhood alleged

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
Word murderer with an opinion and a serious

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Question, god this is a long email

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
Stop it, YYR

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
I personally believe that the Vita's commercial

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
Failure in the US is almost entirely due to

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
The rise of smartphone gaming and

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
The resulting change in market

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
Conditions, heck the 3DS

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
Was almost a failure for the same reason

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
Have we forgotten that it sold

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Miserably during its first year or so

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
It wasn't until Nintendo dropped the price

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
And a steady stream of high quality games

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
Released that it began to sell well

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
Without both of those things it would have flopped

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
Just as hard, the casual games that kept

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
The Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS popular

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
Even when Nintendo wasn't

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
Releasing the gold

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
Gold the movie adaptations

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
The games featuring

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Popular toys or kids characters

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
And so on

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
Have almost all moved to phones and tablets

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Today's market has

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
Changed without both a low price tag

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
And a continuous stream of quality games

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
The market is done with you and therefore

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
It was done with the Vita very quickly

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Speaking of continuous what's left in the

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
Pipeline for the 3DS

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
Most of my friends already seem to have abandoned theirs

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
If and when Nintendo releases a new portable

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
The market for them will be even tougher

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
Than it was this time

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
I wish them good luck, I really do and for the record

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
I love my Vita

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
Which, by the way

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
I picked up

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
My Vita again for like the first time

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
In ages when Happy Home Designer came out

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
Not my Vita, my DS

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
I haven't played my American one

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Since Pixel Poops

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
You should lend it to us

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
I also got that Japanese one and then

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
Akuma sent me that game from Japan

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
And I have some other stuff to play on that

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
But I haven't played the American one since Pixel Poops

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
You should lend it to us

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
I might be talked into that

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
I'll lend you a Neo Geo Pocket Color

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
Alright, now I'd like to pose a question

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
To the panel, the chatters and really

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
Everyone listening

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
I thought of this when talking with Amy

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
This week about pop music

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
According to statistics

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Everybody eventually ages out of pop music

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
They're no longer interested in new stuff

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
They're perfectly content to go back

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
And listen to the years with the music they

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Already enjoyed for the rest of their lives

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
And never look forward again

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
On average this happens in their early to mid 30's

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
Though for women it happens a bit later

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
Than it does for men

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Do you think this will also happen with all of us

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
In video games?

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
I asked this question because I'm starting to think

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
That this process has already begun for me

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
I managed to get a PS4 about a month ago

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
With The Last of Us for $275

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
Figured I'd need it eventually for Shenmue 3

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
So why not?

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
I hooked it up and downloaded the cross buy games

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
I already owned

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
Since that weekend it has never been turned on

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
Not even once

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
While this is likely partially due to

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
My current most played console

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
It feels odd to me

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
I haven't yet purchased Super Mario Maker

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
In fact I feel absolutely zero need to buy it

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
Any time soon even though 12 year old me

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
Would have put in 100 hours already

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:23.000
My Xbox 360, Xbox One, 3DS and Wii U

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
Backlogs have gotten so long that I feel like

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
I just don't need it

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
So what am I playing right now?

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
Sonic Adventure 2 on 360

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
I'm having more fun with it than I've had

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
With anything else I've played this year so far

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
Despite the fact that I 100% destroyed it

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
When it came out almost 15 years ago

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
Now I have access to over 35 years

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
Of video games on demand

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
At my fingertips

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
And sometimes I feel like I'd be perfectly content

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
Just playing what's come out already

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
Never looking forward again

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
What are your thoughts on this?

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
And do you think you'll personally reach this point?

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
I'd also love to know what the listeners think

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
And if this doesn't become a future foogle question

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
I hope they'll respond via email or in some other way

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
Looking to spare Rob

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
From the year old jokes

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
YYR

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
You know what? I actually think this is a great question

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
But I'm gonna say that

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
And I would pose this to our chatters

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
If we do have any quick responses

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
I'll read those out on air

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
But are video games gonna go the way

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
Where as you get older you're not gonna be able to appreciate

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
The new stuff like you appreciate the old stuff

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
But see I would actually say that I'm not sure

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
What you said at the very beginning

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
Is even accurate

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
That we don't understand pop music today

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
I mean for me personally

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
And everybody's different

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
And that's the first thing to remember

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
But for me personally

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
There is some newer music that I actually really enjoy

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
Some of it I don't understand

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
At all

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
Like One Direction

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
That's not music

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
But you know

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Younger girls would disagree with you

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
There's a difference between

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
Cookie cutter pop

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
And actual pop music

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
I do but I also think a lot of it's relative

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
Music is music

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
But like the new Church's album

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
Is what I've been listening to

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
Like non-stop

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
It's so fucking good that just came out like last week

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Or me and Mystery Skulls

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
But is Church's really pop music?

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
I don't know

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
The new Carly Rae Jepsen album

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
And I feel so embarrassed saying that

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
Because I know how tacky

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
That Call Me Maybe got

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
But her new album with new stuff is actually really cool

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
I really like it

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
But I am also

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
So looking forward to

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
The 20 year anniversary

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
And if you know me you know why

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
Of Jagged Little Pill

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
With demos from the 90's that have been unreleased until now

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
Like I cannot wait for that

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
And I listen to ABBA all the time

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
So I kind of get both sides of it

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
So for video games it's actually

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
Kind of similar

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
Like there's some new stuff

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
I don't really understand and I'm not sure

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
I'm ever going to and for me that would be stuff like

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
A lot of sports games

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
Madden, that's just a train

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
I'm never going to be able to get on

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
Call of Duty for me

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
But I understand for Loki

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
He's got to play them all and that's cool

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
And I only play them for a little bit now

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
I really need to go back to Advanced Warfare

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Why did I buy the season pass if I'm not going to play online?

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
But

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
There's some games

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
That take me a while to understand

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
And appreciate later

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
I think Minecraft is the quintessential example

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
I didn't get Minecraft at first

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
What so ever

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
And it wasn't until the 360 version

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
Came out that framed the game a little differently

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Where I was totally on board

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
And I was like okay I understand Minecraft

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
This game is an awful lot of fun

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
But Minecraft was always bigger with I think a younger

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
Generation before I got it

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
And this isn't even unique to video games

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Because Snapchat

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
Do you know how popular Snapchat is?

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
And I didn't understand it

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
At all

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
Until Alan finally sat me down and was like

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
This is why people use it

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
And you can create stories

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
And it's just a fun way for you to look

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
And you can send people messages and all this stuff

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
I just thought it was a way to send people dick pics

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
I thought it was just for dick pics and nothing else

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
But no apparently there's this whole other

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Like it's huge

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
People use Snapchat to communicate like a lot

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
But

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
But anyway

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
I kind of think that analogy

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
Kind of works

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
For a lot of different things

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
But I also don't necessarily

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
Think it's accurate to say that for

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
All people you're not going to be

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
Into necessarily newer pop music

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
And newer things

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
It can also be that like a lot of pop music nowadays is cookie cutter

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
I mean granted a lot of pop music back in

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
The 80's was cookie cutter too but for some reason

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
It's just I don't know

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
Because it's age!

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
Well now also you have like at least back then

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
It was more like

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
You actually had to sing it nowadays

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
So you can sample and just

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
Throw your voice through a computer

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
And

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
I know I might be weird

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
And you guys are going to disagree with me

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
I see that in some ways as another instrument

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Like you know

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
We kind of laugh at some of the people

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
Who overuse it

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
But like with like Cher's Believe

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
That is a great pop song

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
And it just would not be the same without the

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
Do you believe in like

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
The way it sounds like a computer

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
The major autotune

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
The obvious autotune

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
Ok but here's the thing

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
You can make fun of that but then on the other hand

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
Ok I'm going to watch this

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
You can go to Kate Bush

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
And what she did

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
She did like this whole like reimagining

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
Of some of her pop songs and in some of it

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
She uses that whole like

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Autotune stuff as art

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
I need to get that

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
And you can't fucking tell me that Kate Bush

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
It's not

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Kate Bush is like progressive rock

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
Imogen Heap with

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Hide and Seek

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
Everybody knows that song from the Dear Sisters

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
See that was like

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
Autotune as an instrument in a way

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
So it's like

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
Church's does the same thing

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
So I'm not necessarily

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
I don't necessarily subscribe to the fact that autotune is always bad

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
Do some people abuse it? Sure

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Or Lord

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
Well all the background singing and

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
Instrumentation was her

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
So my favorite Lord meme

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
Will always be the whole like where she posted

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
The thing on her Instagram that says

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
It was graffiti that says Lord help me

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
And it was spelled L-O-R-D-E

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
And she just put as the caption I'm on my way

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
That's cute

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
Anyway

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
Darktitsuyu in chat says

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
I do kind of miss the stuff we listened to

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
Back in the early 2000's when we did the original

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
Show. You know it doesn't seem

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
I've been trying to see if they make Eurodance

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Kind of like that and I feel like it's more

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
Evolved into like that

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
The trance and the Euro vocal trance

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
Which isn't bad by any means

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
I love that stuff and I listen to a lot of stuff

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
On Spotify

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
Is there any more from what's that artist

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
That kind of partnered up with Paul Terry there for a little bit

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
Orbitribe?

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
Oh I have no idea I have to check

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
Spotify. I just know Armin Van Buren

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
I swear to God is putting out a compilation every week

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
And a podcast

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
He's got a great ear

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
I could listen to any of those mixes he does

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
It's great

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
On a tangent I guess I got away a little bit

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
From the original question

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
I don't even remember what the original question was

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
Okay the original question was

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Pop music we tend to not

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
Listen to the new stuff and focus on the stuff we

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
Enjoyed as kids. Is that going to be the same situation

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
With video games?

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
I am just saying

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
To be honest although I completely see your point

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
Your analogy is not always true

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
So therefore no

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
I think I'm pretty interested in

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
Games coming out now

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
Just there's only certain games I want

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
I think now it's like

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
I don't have Blockbuster and stuff where I could rent

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
Games for five bucks and just play everything

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
Now it's just kind of more selective

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
About it

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
I kind of have a better idea what my tastes are

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
And also you know it used to be that

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
The only exposure on

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
What a game is was from looking at the box

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
Hmm does this look interesting?

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
I guess we'll rent it

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
I don't have like now where the internet

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
You see trailers, you watch the impressions of it

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
You hear people talk about it, read the reviews

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
I mean there's a lot to it

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
You know what's interesting though?

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
And to give YYR the benefit of the doubt

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
I just saw this comment in chat

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
And I'm sorry

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
You're going to think I'm yelling at you and I swear I'm not

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
I respect your opinion. Kasan in our chat room

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
Says I can't think of

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
Three good music videos from the 90s

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
And I'm sitting here about to flip a table

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
I'm like what? What are you talking about?

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
There wasn't three good videos from the 1990s

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
Oh my god like some of the greatest music

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
Videos were from the 1990s

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
Like you know

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
I for one think Alanis

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Ironic was a fantastic

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
Video at the time. Madonna did

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
So many great videos in the 90s like Ray of Light

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
That Jamiroquai

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
Virtual Insanity was so cool

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
All Gorillaz videos?

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
That was...

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
I mean my god there's a ton of good stuff

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
How many other Michael Jackson videos?

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
So I kind of look at that comment and go

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
What the fuck are you?

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
Again you're welcome to your opinion

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
And that goes to show that YYR to your point

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
I think the opposite might be true

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
Most of the time

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
Not all the time

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
But I think the opposite

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
And what I mean by that is I think people today

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
Who grew up on PlayStation 2

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
Like don't know a world

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
With anything older than a PlayStation 2 or 3

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
I think those people

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
Have a much harder time

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
Going back to NES

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
Atari 2600

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
And appreciating the value of those games

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
The way that we can

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
Most of the time

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
Not saying all the time because certainly there's gonna be

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Like that 18 year old that listens to OLR

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
That says whoa you're wrong

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
My son refers to anything that

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
Is 8-bit as Minecraft

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
So he's just like

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
So that game looks like Minecraft

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
So that comment kind of made me think

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
Because I'm sitting here going what are you talking about

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
And I'm thinking well maybe

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
He doesn't have that same perspective

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
That I do because I lived it

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
You know and if you're younger

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:06.000
You didn't have the emotional attachment to those videos

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
The way maybe that I do

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000
And so I think with video games

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
To YYR's point that's very true

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
So YYR I actually think

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:16.000
The complete opposite of what you said is what's true

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:18.000
If that makes sense

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Anyway

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:22.000
There you go and now everybody in chat is like

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
Naming off great 90s music videos

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:26.000
Smashing pumpkins oh my god

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.000
So many amazing 90s music videos

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
Sabotage by Beastie Boys

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:32.000
Smack My Bitch Up by Prodigy

02:13:32.000 --> 02:13:34.000
Remember the big twist in that video

02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:36.000
And that was a controversial one I got banned from MTV

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
Anyway I just want to say

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:40.000
I'm not yelling at you

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:42.000
Your point just kind of made me go

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:44.000
What? For a minute

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
So anyway

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:48.000
Let's move on next email

02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:50.000
There are still a few

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:52.000
So next email comes

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
From Robert M

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Do any of you yet know whether

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:58.000
The bases of Lego Dimensions

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Figures slash builds are able

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
To store data such as studs collected

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
Alternate builds, experience levels

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
And so on nope

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
I do not know the answer I will in a week

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:10.000
But I'm sure we have some people in our chat

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Who have played the game who know that

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:14.000
Do the Lego Dimensions characters save

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
Information

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
Cause Amiibos can do that right

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:20.000
Amiibos do it Skylanders do it

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
I'll give some information cause you can take them to different

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
Does it? Okay

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Maybe somebody in chat can

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.000
Fill us in with a little more information on how that works

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
Cause even though I bought it today I haven't played it yet

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:32.000
So Brad from Pop Culture

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:34.000
Jumping in to say the vehicles do

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
There you go

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:40.000
Alright

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
There's the best answer I can get for now

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
Alright next email

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
Eating's Grey and Way Allutation

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:48.000
Says sorry Jamie it's been a while since I've

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:50.000
Messed with Grandpa by using Pig Ladin

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:52.000
Oh I already know who this is

02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:54.000
I couldn't help myself by the way I just

02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:56.000
Caught up on all OLR episodes and I'm

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:58.000
Happy to hear Rob is thinking about bringing back

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:00.000
That Wednesday show out from

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:02.000
Hiatus

02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:04.000
Quickly it's not just my decision

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
To make that clear

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
It's something that Extra for myself

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
And Grandpa are all talking about

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
And even inviting

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000
If Shane wants to be a part of it he certainly can

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Although if he doesn't then we respect that too

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Not to get too

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Tangeny sorry I'm interrupting

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
Darkseiders email but I think people want to know

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
Right now really for us

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
We're all kind of burned out on online games

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Like you know I don't even

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
Really play Final Fantasy 14 these days

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
Just because there's a real lull

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
Between content patches

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
I don't think Grandpa's playing anything but maybe

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
Heroes of the Storm I'm playing Diablo 3 granted

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
But we need to find a new focus

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
And once that's

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
What the three of us have to sit down and figure out

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
So it's almost like starting a new podcast

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
And we realize

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
There's a lot of people out there

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
Who really don't care what we talk about

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Because they're tuning in to hear Grandpa and Extra for

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
Gang up on me which is fine

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
But once we figure out what that

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
Supposed topic of the show is going to be

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
And how that format is going to work

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
It'll be back in some form

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
Which reminds me I need to talk to you about something

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
Okay

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
Anyway

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
I know you guys

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
Have been wiping on that difficult boss

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
Known as real life but I'm confident

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
That you guys will pull through as you always do

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
As long as Rob keeps up with his heels

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
And Grandpa keeps his drink on

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
Because he's better at DPS when he's drunk

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Extra is perfect the way he is tanking

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
And spanking

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
I will pass that message along

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:32.000
And Grandpa is back from

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
His big NBA trip

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
He went over

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
He gallivanted across Europe and had beer from all over

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
And supposedly under the guise of education

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
Yeah

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
So anyway

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
A little bit of news came out

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
Last week on Digital Card Gaming front

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
As some of you might have heard

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
In Spring 2014

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Wizards of the Coast slash Hasbro filed a lawsuit

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
Against Cryptozoic Entertainment

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
The lawsuit stated that

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
Cryptozoic's digital card game released

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
Hex Shards of Fate

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Infringed on Wizards of the Coast

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
Hasbro's card game Magic the Gathering

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
In regards to copyright, trade dress, and patent claims

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
I remember this

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
Well I'm happy to say that the lawsuit has been settled

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
As of Thursday of last week

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
Link below

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
HexTCG.com slash press dash release dash settlement

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
However

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
Those who have read the press release

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
May have noticed the word license

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
Has shown up twice

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
Although details of the settlements are unknown

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
The appearance of the word license

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
Make the story a little interesting

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
For me at least

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
Regardless I'm glad to know that the matter has been settled

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
And I hope that this

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
Bit news will ease

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
The concerns of would be hex players

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
Who might have been put off by the lawsuit

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
My question to you guys

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
In chat is this

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
We all know that copyright laws are extremely out of date

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
I understand that we're all not lawyers and senators

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
As far as I know

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
But imagine if you could change those laws

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
How would you change them in accordance

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
To the technological age we live in today

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
I'm not a lawyer

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
It'd have to be revamped

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
With all due respect

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
That is such a deep question

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
I'm not sure I can think of an answer on the spot

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
About how to fix it

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
I want a politician to tell me how they're going to do it

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
And I'm going to nod and say that sounds good

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
How would you do it?

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
I would think it would be a lot harder

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
To trademark

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
Very vague, broad

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Things

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
That seems to be a lot of the problem

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
Is just the broadness

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
That people can actually patent

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
And the fact that

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
I don't want to say you can't patent ideas

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
Because I realize that defeats the purpose

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
But I gotta say

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
Since you're listening to old episodes of OLR

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
I really truly think

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
We have what? 616 episodes of the show we've done

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
If there's like 10 OLR episodes

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
You must listen to before you die

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
That episode that Kyle Ward was on

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
A couple months ago

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
And sorry I don't remember the number off the top of my head

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
I need to crowd source that one for a minute

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
Dark Tetsuya what number was that?

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
That is one of the 10 episodes you need to hear of OLR

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
Because

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
Kyle talking about

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
What he went through with his game

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
And what he realized about these various

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
Patents that Konami actually owned

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
We were sitting here going

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
Thank you 596

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
I knew it was right before 600

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
That is one of the 10 I truly feel

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
I can't believe you can actually Google our episodes

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
Would you guys agree with me?

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
I think that's really one of the 10 best episodes we ever did

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
And just that insight

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
That he really gave us into that

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
And kind of how the sausage is made

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
Sort of thing

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
I really think kind of plays into exactly why you're seeing the word license

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
I think Wizards of the Coast

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
Or whatever had some type of patent

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
In this thing that had

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
Hex by the balls that they couldn't get out of

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
And so they had to license it

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
And I don't think the fans

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Should lash out at Hex for this

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
I think the fans should take their case to

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
Wanting this patent law reformed

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
And how was a patent granted

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
For this in the first place

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
Question mark

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
I think the rules about what we do

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
And what we don't patent

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Need to be more clearly defined

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
I can see them with patenting the rules of the game

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
Or something like that

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
And if they're copying the exact rules of the game

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
Then there could be issues

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
But I think general

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
Patents for just like

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
Arrows scrolling up a screen

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
Or method to blah blah blah

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
I think they should be granted

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
For a couple years and then that's it

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Make your money off of it

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
And then it goes public domain

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Kind of like how medicine is

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
When you find a drug that's patented for what

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
7 years and you get to make it

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
And then that's it

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
Then it can go generic after that

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Because that 7 years is long enough

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
Especially with an idea like arrows

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
Scrolling up the screen

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Look how long DDR lasted

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
It's really not around anymore

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
It is not the cultural thing it was

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000
When we first started doing OLR

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000
You know so I think these ideas

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000
Kind of have their cycle

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:03.000
And then they kind of come and go

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:05.000
And look what happened with the plastic instruments and all that

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:07.000
Well you know who's pushing for all that

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.000
Copyright stuff to be extended out

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Disney

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:11.000
Absolutely

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
Well because they're scared as hell what's going to happen

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
When Mickey Mouse goes in the public domain

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
I mean I could

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
I could put a picture

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
I mean I guess I could do this today under parody law

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
Technically but I could sell a shirt

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
Of me pooping on Mickey Mouse

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
I could sell a shirt

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:29.000
And there's nothing they could do to stop me

02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:31.000
Once Mickey Mouse is in the public domain

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.000
That's what they're afraid of

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.000
You want to charge like $200

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000
For me to go to Disneyland

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:39.000
I'm going to make my own Disneyland

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:41.000
I could have a picture of a shirt

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
I could have a picture of a shirt with Mickey Mouse

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
On it that says I love dick

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
And there's nothing they could do about it

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
Now they can because I can't sell that shirt

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:51.000
I mean I could do it under parody

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:53.000
If I put it onto my Twitter account they can't do anything

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:55.000
But if I sell a shirt with Mickey Mouse

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
That says I love dick they could sue me

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
But they won't once

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
Mickey goes in the public domain so you're right

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
Disney is scared as hell of that stuff

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
Banksy just did it with Dismaland

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:07.000
Oh that's right

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:09.000
But he didn't use the characters exactly

02:22:09.000 --> 02:22:11.000
And you could kind of say that's parody

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:13.000
It was parody it was also a political statement

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
But yeah

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
Boy did we get on a tangent with that email

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
We do that here at OLR don't we

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
Alright

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
P.S. Rob I'm happy to

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000
Know that you're starting to fulfill the first

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000
Part of your new years resolution

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
In regards to streaming yes I did watch the

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:31.000
Broadcasting of your stream from yesterday

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:33.000
However I've yet to see

02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.000
That platinum that you were hoping

02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:37.000
To get on Diablo 3 PS4

02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:39.000
Which was the second part of your new years

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:41.000
Resolution lol

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
It's all good Rob not all of us are meant to achieve

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
Platinum status in games

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000
Snuggles and huggles to you all

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
Not so sincerely degenerate Johnny

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000
I've got three months left

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:53.000
Here's what's going to do me in I'm not going to have

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
The vacation time over the holidays like I had

02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:57.000
Last year because of the job switch so

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:59.000
I don't know we'll see we'll see

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
I'm also actually considering

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.000
Doing like a weekly twitch again

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:05.000
Because you know how I was

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:07.000
Playing hot to full boyfriend

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:09.000
I'm actually just thinking about doing just

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
Jamie fucks around in Dragon Age

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
And cheats

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
As long as you kind of like give commentary and talk

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:17.000
Through it it could be very interesting

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
I just like playing the game

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000
And like answering people

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000
We talked about this last week though where it's just different

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.000
Depending on the stream you know I did a Diablo 3

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:27.000
You guys have to tell me what you think of this I don't think

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:29.000
Anybody saw it but it's on my archive

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.000
Twitch TV slash Rob Roberts

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:33.000
Maybe I'll do it again tonight if I have time

02:23:33.000 --> 02:23:35.000
I was playing some Diablo 3 yesterday because for me

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
PC streaming is the easiest but

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:39.000
Using that new game show software I actually

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:41.000
Set up different camera things

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:43.000
So that like when I was in between stages

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.000
It was my little cam you could see my cam

02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:47.000
And the Diablo screen I would kind of talk to the camera

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:49.000
And then I could even click a button

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:51.000
And it would make the screen even smaller and you would

02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000
See the chat room and I would respond to chat comments

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
Although there weren't a lot yesterday because it was Saturday afternoon

02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:57.000
But then when I actually went into the Rift

02:23:57.000 --> 02:23:59.000
And I was doing heavy game playing

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:01.000
I clicked another button and made the game full screen

02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000
And I just talked over it and I thought that was

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
Like I like being able to switch between

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:07.000
Them I think is even better

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:09.000
Than just a static image that's what I would like

02:24:09.000 --> 02:24:11.000
To do more of in the future but that game show right now

02:24:11.000 --> 02:24:13.000
Is kind of limiting on

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
Some features but

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000
Anyway I'll get into that at a later time

02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000
I gotta let Jamie finish the email

02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:21.000
Hey OLR Delvin here

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
From Video Game Realness, long time listener

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
First time emailer Delvin is

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:27.000
Awesome and he's my podcasting buddy

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000
On a seasonal show, reading is fundamental

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000
Did you know I did a show on RuPaul's Drag Race?

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000
We do a podcast

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
The listeners might not

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000
And knowing is half the battle

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000
This past weekend

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
Was the start of a League of Legends

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.000
World Championship and I have been watching

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
A fair amount of it

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:47.000
Despite being terrible at the game

02:24:47.000 --> 02:24:49.000
I have been playing League of Legends for a few years now

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:51.000
Also have friends who have played it

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
Since the game first came out

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
To see where the game started

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:57.000
And what it has become over the past few years

02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000
Is incredibly mind boggling in a good way

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000
As far as the esports scene

02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000
For the game goes, it started out as friends

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000
Who were good at the game, made teams

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.000
And competed at local or national events

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000
And now has grown into a full fledged sport

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:11.000
Having managers, sponsors, drafts

02:25:11.000 --> 02:25:13.000
And large amounts of viewers and teams

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:15.000
That have become full on brands

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
And household names among the gaming community

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:19.000
I'm curious to know

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:21.000
What is OLR's thoughts on esports

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:23.000
Mainly League of Legends has become

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:25.000
And do you see it as good or bad for gaming?

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.000
Your pal, Delvin, Video Game Realness

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:29.000
P.S. For those who don't know

02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:31.000
Rob has a long lost brother who plays League of Legends

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:33.000
Professionally for Cloud9 Gaming

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:35.000
Under the name LemonNation, look it up

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
I'm not really good at them, therefore I don't really have much of an interest in them

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:09.000
But it's not that I want to see these games tank

02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:11.000
Because I don't

02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:13.000
I don't carry that negativity

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:15.000
And I think the money that gets poured into this stuff

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.000
I mean, A. It's exposure for gaming

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:19.000
It's more of a positive image for gaming

02:26:19.000 --> 02:26:21.000
That it's not all necessarily

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.000
Just like guns blazing

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
And Doom and Mortal Kombat

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000
Ripping heads off of bodies and stuff

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000
It kind of gets a little more into that

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000
Strategical side of games

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000
So I like that that's kind of what's out there

02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000
More and more in the populace

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:37.000
And with TBS taking on some Counter-Strike

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:39.000
Next year and so forth

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:41.000
A little more of the

02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:43.000
Strategical and the actual game side of things

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:45.000
But I personally

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.000
It's hard

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
I try to watch it and I'm just kind of like

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:51.000
I don't understand what the fuck's going on

02:26:51.000 --> 02:26:53.000
But I did

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:55.000
Shane and I watched on Twitch a little bit of the

02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:57.000
Heroes of the Storm stuff

02:26:57.000 --> 02:26:59.000
A lot of my co-workers play that

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:01.000
Which is basically

02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:03.000
League of Legends dumbed down

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:05.000
For people like me

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:07.000
Blizzard is A plus

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
Pro at dumbing games down

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
And making them accessible and that's not a bad thing at all

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
That's just what they do

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
And they're going to do it with the Team Fortress thing

02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:17.000
And the first person shooter with this game they're making now

02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:19.000
Overwatch

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
Anyway

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:23.000
Shane and I did watch some of that

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:25.000
I was kind of into it

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:27.000
Because at least I understand this game

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:29.000
But do I get caught up in the celebrity

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:31.000
Of it all and that end of it?

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:33.000
Not really

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:35.000
That I'm not really so into

02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000
And I'm not sure I understand

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.000
That yet

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:41.000
And that's what I struggled with a little bit at TwitchCon

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:43.000
As well is that

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:45.000
I guess I'm surrounded by a lot of famous people

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.000
But they're just

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.000
Other con-goers to me

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:51.000
I'm not really caught up in that celebrity

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:53.000
But at the same time

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.000
They have no idea what the fuck I'm doing

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:57.000
With a podcaster that I'm part of

02:27:57.000 --> 02:27:59.000
The longest running video game podcast on the internet

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:01.000
They don't know that

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
It's this interesting kind of like other side

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:05.000
I don't know how to phrase it

02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:07.000
But yeah

02:28:07.000 --> 02:28:09.000
I guess that's my very long winded thoughts on that

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:11.000
Overall I think it's a good thing

02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:13.000
It presents a good image

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.000
For video gaming and gaming culture

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
But I have a really hard time

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:19.000
Getting wrapped up in the celebrity

02:28:19.000 --> 02:28:21.000
And especially over that particular game

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
It's just not one I'm thrilled about

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
But I don't want you to take that as like a negative

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:27.000
That I hate it because I don't

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:29.000
Okay cool

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
It's just like football

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:33.000
I don't hate football, it's just not for me

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:35.000
I like hockey though

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:37.000
And I bet SSJ100Matt's happy to hear that

02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:39.000
I like hockey, that I understand

02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:41.000
So there you go

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000
That's my thoughts on the email

02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000
I don't know if you guys have something to add

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000
Or if anybody in chat is saying anything on that

02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:49.000
Seattle in chat says

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
The only Blizzard game I really really want to play

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
And maybe Starcraft 2

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:55.000
I love Diablo 3

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:57.000
But like I'm terrible at Starcraft 2

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
I am terrible at it

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:01.000
I will say when I've watched the professional Starcraft 2 stuff

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:03.000
I'm just like how do they fucking know what to do so fast

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:05.000
But then I think back to

02:29:05.000 --> 02:29:07.000
When you and I

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:09.000
All of us here

02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:11.000
Used to play

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:13.000
DDR back at Roseville Golfland

02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:15.000
And we were doing songs like Orion 7-8

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:17.000
With the note chart that's just all the arrows

02:29:17.000 --> 02:29:19.000
Smashed together

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
Like that's how fast your feet are moving right?

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:23.000
And like when people would watch us

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:25.000
Play that they were probably like

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
How the hell do they move their feet that fast

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
How do they read that

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:31.000
I can't do that anymore

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:33.000
But it was practice

02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:35.000
And a real love of the game

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:37.000
And just playing it over and over and over again

02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:39.000
And so I get it

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
That's what they're doing in Starcraft 2

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:43.000
Is that they know all the keyboard shortcuts

02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:45.000
And that crazy shit because they really love the game

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:47.000
And they learned it

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.000
So anyway

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
That's my thoughts

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:53.000
My long winded thoughts as usual

02:29:53.000 --> 02:29:55.000
I don't know if you guys want to add anything

02:29:55.000 --> 02:29:57.000
And that was it for email

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:59.000
That's it for email that was a long email segment tonight

02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:01.000
But very good you guys did a very good job tonight

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:03.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.000
And now

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:07.000
That that is over it is time

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
To get a little bit angsty

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.000
Here at OLR with a segment we call

02:30:11.000 --> 02:30:13.000
The FUs of the Week

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:15.000
And why do we get so angry here at OLR?

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:17.000
Well we have issues

02:30:31.000 --> 02:30:35.000
A major FU to my digestive system

02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:37.000
I'm sure people remember a couple weeks ago

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:39.000
I was out sick

02:30:39.000 --> 02:30:41.000
Like sick sick

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:43.000
Like quarantine sick

02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000
And it turns out that I still have a problem

02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:47.000
They actually don't know that because I blamed it

02:30:47.000 --> 02:30:49.000
On the Jewish holiday that was going on at the time

02:30:49.000 --> 02:30:51.000
Well I mean that's originally why I was going to be out

02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000
But it turned out that I ended up being told

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
Don't go out among people

02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:57.000
Gotcha

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:59.000
So I still have the problem

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:01.000
For the last week or so

02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:03.000
I haven't been able to eat more than about

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:05.000
600 calories worth of stuff a day

02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:07.000
Oh my gosh

02:31:07.000 --> 02:31:09.000
And I've had to go a few days without any coffee

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000
Which is difficult

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000
So I

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
Yeah, screw it

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000
I hate it

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
I like pie and I'm going to eat pie tonight and if it makes me sick

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:21.000
Oh well

02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000
Pie is awesome

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000
Loki, how about you?

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000
I guess my FU of the Week is going to be going

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000
To

02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
Just

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:33.000
I don't know

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:35.000
Not being able to find the right font for my stupid

02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.000
Games logo

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:39.000
Because I know what it is

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.000
Try Papyrus

02:31:41.000 --> 02:31:43.000
Or Comic Sans

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:45.000
Don't you fucking dare

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:47.000
Or the best thing I've ever seen called

02:31:47.000 --> 02:31:49.000
Comic Papyrus

02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:51.000
Actually I'll show you a funny one

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:53.000
Is Comic Slab

02:31:53.000 --> 02:31:55.000
It's basically Comic Sans

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:57.000
But done with a slab serif

02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:59.000
So it's kind of funny

02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:01.000
We'll see

02:32:01.000 --> 02:32:03.000
I will

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:05.000
Check those out I guess

02:32:05.000 --> 02:32:07.000
So that's what I've been working on this week

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
And wasting so much time doing so

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:11.000
By the way I have like a million fonts now and none of them

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:13.000
Seems to be good enough

02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.000
My FU of the Week

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:17.000
Goes to Shane for being an enabler

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:19.000
And just watching me spend all that money today

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:21.000
And not trying to do anything

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:23.000
To stop it

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:25.000
That's fair, right?

02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:27.000
Alright, there it is

02:32:27.000 --> 02:32:29.000
The FU of the Week segment

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:31.000
By the way, Hitstun in chat over at

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:33.000
Live.vognetwork.com saying

02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000
That Hitstun has finished

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
Loki's castle level and saying

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000
My FU of the Week goes to Jigsaw's Castle of Carnage

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:41.000
So there you go Loki, somebody beat him

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:43.000
There you go

02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:45.000
How many tries did it take you Hitstun?

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:47.000
I just want to know

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:49.000
Alright, anyhow

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:51.000
Let's get to a couple more news stories and then we'll get to the Skype line

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
Which I'm only going to leave open for a little bit tonight

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:55.000
So if you want to get through you better be fast

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000
And I'll let you know when that's open here in just a moment

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:59.000
Now Hitstun says 20 tries

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:01.000
That's still really good

02:33:01.000 --> 02:33:03.000
Yeah, it's better than I did

02:33:03.000 --> 02:33:05.000
So Jeremy's level is from Koopa Club

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:07.000
He did some, I swear to god

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.000
I died like 70 times on one of them

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:11.000
I will have to try this

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:13.000
And I was cursing his name in 7 different languages

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
More news stories, Loki

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
Alright, so beat Takashi

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
Is going to be in the new Yakuza game

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:21.000
That's pretty cool

02:33:21.000 --> 02:33:23.000
Let's see

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
Apparently

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:27.000
I'm not really sure who

02:33:27.000 --> 02:33:29.000
Is supposed to be in the actual game here

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
Did you watch the little trailer thing?

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
Nope, I did not

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:35.000
Okay, so someone posted on Twitter

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
Just the back of his head

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:39.000
And said, guess who's going to be in the next Yakuza game

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.000
And I was like, oh it's Kitano Takashi

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
And I only knew it from the back of his head

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
But I knew that he also did a bunch of Yakuza movies

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:47.000
Like that was his thing

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:49.000
And then I saw the little trailer and it's totally his voice

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.000
So

02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.000
Neat

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:55.000
Cool

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:57.000
That's all I got

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
I just thought you'd enjoy that because I know you were a big fan of Takashi's castle

02:33:59.000 --> 02:34:01.000
I was

02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:03.000
I really wish they'd bring

02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.000
I just

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000
That's what I want

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
I want like a channel of just

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:11.000
Subtitled

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:13.000
Japanese game shows

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000
Is that like a thing that can happen?

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000
Because I know

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
It's got to be out there

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000
Because they used to record that stuff for our Japanese class

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
So I think they have like a local channel

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:25.000
In San Francisco or something

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
They've got to have

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:29.000
Because we used to watch

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:31.000
Furuhata

02:34:31.000 --> 02:34:33.000
Oh god I love Furuhata

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:35.000
There is a channel in the bay area

02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:37.000
That does all Japanese TV

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:39.000
Mostly like dramas and game shows

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:41.000
That's what I want

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:43.000
Japanese game show channel

02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:45.000
And I need to watch

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000
More Silent Library because that was also funny

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:49.000
That was the closest thing I had to a Japanese game

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
Was that the MTV?

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
It was

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:55.000
It was so stupid

02:34:55.000 --> 02:34:57.000
It was like a Japanese game show

02:34:57.000 --> 02:34:59.000
It was really stupid

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000
That show kind of got it

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:03.000
When they try to bring that stuff over here

02:35:03.000 --> 02:35:05.000
Like with the hole in the wall

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:07.000
They lose it's charm

02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:09.000
They're like

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
Oh that's what they did

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
And they just make a really terrible knock off

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
It doesn't have the same

02:35:15.000 --> 02:35:17.000
I don't know

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:19.000
Like seriousness

02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:21.000
Perfect example

02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:23.000
Like some of the cooking competition shows

02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:25.000
In Iron Chef Japan

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
It was very serious

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
And very artful

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
Iron Chef America is like

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:33.000
The pompousness

02:35:33.000 --> 02:35:35.000
And grandstanding of it all is what made that show

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:37.000
Great and when they brought it to the US

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:39.000
It was kind of like I'm his cousin

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:41.000
I do things differently

02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000
Woo

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:45.000
It's sort of

02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:47.000
It's still good but it lost

02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:49.000
That charm to it

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:51.000
Agree

02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:53.000
She links us to

02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:55.000
Actually a pretty awesome movie called Outrage

02:35:55.000 --> 02:35:57.000
That has

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.000
Takeshi in it

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.000
Very cool

02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:03.000
Alright well one more story for you guys

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.000
About and some of you might have heard about this

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
But did you know there was an unreleased

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000
And unfinished South Park game

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000
It was apparently cancelled

02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000
It was on the Xbox

02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000
The first Xbox

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:17.000
I almost said the Xbox one

02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:19.000
But I made the first Xbox

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:21.000
And yeah if you actually watch some of the video

02:36:21.000 --> 02:36:23.000
I mean this is a very early build

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:25.000
I mean half the town is not even finished

02:36:25.000 --> 02:36:27.000
But it moves around in a 3D

02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000
Environment which is very interesting to see

02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.000
And it's not at all like

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:33.000
South Park 64

02:36:33.000 --> 02:36:35.000
Yeah it kind of looks a little more like South Park 64

02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:37.000
But with better polygons

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
And so forth

02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:41.000
But it looks like they even had some cut scenes

02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:43.000
That were in there and some of the voice acting was done

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.000
There was a workable combat system in place

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
Cartman can actually fight dogs

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:49.000
In one part of it

02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:51.000
So that's kind of neat

02:36:51.000 --> 02:36:53.000
Buzz Monkey was the studio that made

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
The game and it was eventually snapped up

02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:57.000
By Zynga and became a part of that collective

02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000
But the game never happened

02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000
And I don't know if that's because I think it was a little late

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000
In the Xbox's life that this was being put

02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:05.000
Together and maybe they decided not to do it

02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:07.000
But we still have the fractured

02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:09.000
Butthole which I

02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:11.000
I will never get over that title

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:13.000
That is still coming

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:15.000
I think I'm going to make that my goal this week

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
To go back and play signature

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:19.000
Because I never finished it on Xbox

02:37:19.000 --> 02:37:21.000
And I need to go play it

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:23.000
And finish it before I get to the fractured

02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000
Butthole

02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:27.000
Now when they release that are they going to include the first game

02:37:27.000 --> 02:37:29.000
With that too because I think that's coming out on PlayStation 4

02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.000
Because that would be pretty cool if they did

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
I don't think that's part of the plan

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.000
Because it's a different studio doing it too

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:37.000
That's too bad

02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:39.000
I think the game itself will be different

02:37:39.000 --> 02:37:41.000
But as long as, I mean if Trey and Matt are still involved

02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:43.000
They'll have that same humor

02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:45.000
Which is usually on point

02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:47.000
It depends what season it is

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:49.000
Sometimes it's on point, sometimes it's

02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
I miss a lot of South Park

02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
It's one of those shows I forget is on

02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:55.000
Because it's so infrequent that there's new episodes

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:57.000
And then when you happen to see it on TV

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:59.000
It's like oh god this episode is ages old

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:01.000
But then when you remember

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
Oh yeah there's a new South Park on you watch it

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:05.000
Most of the time it's really

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:07.000
Really funny and on point

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
I just don't like the multi story arcs

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
They do the four episode long

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:13.000
God, one of them they did was awful

02:38:13.000 --> 02:38:15.000
It was Imaginationland

02:38:15.000 --> 02:38:17.000
I didn't like that one at all

02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000
I liked that, that was fine

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:21.000
Some of the other ones are coming

02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:23.000
Exactly, anyway

02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:25.000
Phone lines are open

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
1-877-GAMELR or our username on Skype

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:29.000
OrangeLoungeRadio

02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:31.000
If you want to give us a call

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:33.000
We'll be happy to have you on the show

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:35.000
We're only going to keep this open for a little bit

02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:37.000
So if you want to call

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.000
Try to get in now

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
It's almost 9 o'clock here on the west coast

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
Which means midnight on the east coast

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
And lucky us we have a call coming in already

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
So let's get to it

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
Hi you're on OrangeLoungeRadio, who's this?

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
Hey guys it's Jason

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
Hey Jason, oh my gosh are you driving right now?

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
I am hands free

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
I have my headset in my phone

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
I am in the high country of California

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
Just about to hit Truckee here

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
Probably about the time this call is going to be over

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
No I know you're a good boy

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
And you wouldn't drive

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
And have the hands and all that

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
But I can hear that rushing wind sound

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
Of the car

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
So sad you came right through Sacramento

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
But couldn't stop by tonight because you're on a schedule

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
I understand

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
I'm already a little bit behind because I am

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
A wonderful procrastinator

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
And we'll just leave it at that

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
As long as you waved when you went by Sacramento

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
I absolutely did

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
I saw all the buildings and I was like I think it's that way

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
You

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
You felt my presence

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
As long as that's the case I'm happy

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
What's on your mind tonight? You must be listening in the car

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
What's up?

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
I am here with your weekly

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
Twitch report

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
I think I mentioned

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
Last week that I am

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
Predominantly a variety

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
I follow variety streams

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
The

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
Extent of esports and streaming for me

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
Is I watched a couple of the internationals

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
And then I follow a couple of

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
Speedrunners which are definitely

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
Kind of in the middle ground but they still have their personality

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
That they put into it

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
But I am predominantly a variety caster

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
But I still kind of pay attention to

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
Trends

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
Twitch really likes putting the top games

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
In your face especially on the mobile app

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
That being the default view so you see this kind of stuff

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
And the obvious

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
Trends like variety casters still have

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
Their

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
Trope caliber expectations

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
Everybody's breaking out the scary

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
Games for October

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
Have we covered

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
Until dawn?

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
Whoa what do you mean by covered

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
Because sorry I just dropped my phone

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
Literally while you were talking

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
Was there anything

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
I'm not actually sure how old the game is

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
It's less than a year and a half

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
Because it's modern consoles

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
Was there

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
With Five Nights at Freddy's

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
Kind of

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
Spearheading the fear

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
Of the games and that kind of stuff

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
And everybody trying to be into this space

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
That series

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
Until Dawn

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
Stoma

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
What are some of the newer ones I can't even think of

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
Me personally I follow some stuff with Fatal Frame 5

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
I'll tell you where we're at

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
With Until Dawn is that

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
That game actually only came out probably about six weeks ago

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
It's not an incredibly old game

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
It's been out for about a month

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
And actually I think that was the last livestream

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
I did for my Playstation 4

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
It made me play it

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
And yeah

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
It is another one of those scary games

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
And it's like I just knew

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
Do you want to walk left or walk right

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
And I'm like great

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
Which direction is going to get my head chopped off

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
And which one is going to get me to safety

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
I kind of can't deal with that type of pressure

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
It's scary

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
But yeah

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
You know what's interesting

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
Is I really think Sony wrote that game off

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
I really do

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
They originally wrote that game off

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
And I think it has to do with the performance

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
Of The Order

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
And I don't know what those games have in common

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
Besides the fact that they were both early showcased games

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
For Playstation

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
But I don't think Sony has thrown a lot of oomph behind that game

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
But I think

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
Because of livestreaming

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:15.000
In large part

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
I think that game is doing a whole lot better

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
And unfortunately we lost Jason

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
And knowing where he is in California right now

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
If he's coming through Truckee

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
I'm in the mountain ranges of California right now

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
And so I'm actually trying to call him back

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
I don't usually do this

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
But for Jason who does a lot of favors for OLR

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
I will make phone

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
I think we have him back

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
Hi Jason are you back with us

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
Maybe

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
Jason I know you're in the high country in California right now

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
So your signal probably sucks

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
But I'm hoping you understand me

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
So I was just saying that Until Dawn

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
I actually think it's kind of gained that cult status

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
In a way

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
In a big way

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
But I bet that game is doing better than they expected

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
And I actually think livestreaming

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
Absolutely plays into that

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
Because that game does lend itself pretty well

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
Because you know there's people out there going

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
And it's like participating with a bad movie

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
Don't go back there

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
Don't go back there

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
People in the live feed or whatever can scream

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
Don't go left, don't go left

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
And either the person is an idiot and goes left

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
And gets their head chopped off or whatever

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
So anyway

02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000
Did you have some thoughts on that you wanted to try and get out

02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:25.000
I was mostly curious about how old it is

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:28.000
Because of the variety rounds that it's making right now

02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:32.000
Like I said I didn't think it was too particularly old

02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:38.000
And it's strange to think that with the prime season

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:40.000
That applies to the theme of the game

02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:42.000
That they would already kind of like set it aside

02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:44.000
But I really hope that they've seen successes with it

02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:47.000
Because the sheer amount of play time

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:53.000
I think I saw it at number 25 on the top games on Twitch

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
And you know that kind of stuff

02:43:55.000 --> 02:44:00.000
It only takes one influential streamer to crack the top 20

02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:04.000
But certainly with the rotation

02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:06.000
People saving it closer to Halloween

02:44:06.000 --> 02:44:08.000
And all that kind of stuff

02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000
That's a big deal to have that

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:16.000
I'm not hearing anything about scary game lineups this year

02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:18.000
You're cutting out a little bit again

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:21.000
But I think especially this really is that time of year for scary game streaming

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:24.000
And yeah I think Until Dawn is going to be a part of that

02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:26.000
I don't know if you heard, not to shift things radically

02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:29.000
But I don't know if you heard the Jackbox interview earlier in the show

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:32.000
But they were talking a little bit about how streaming is really kind of

02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:35.000
And almost I kind of feel like in that interview

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:40.000
Is a part of the reason why You Don't Know Jack isn't a part of this second box

02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:44.000
Is that well we wanted to focus on games that were better for streaming

02:44:44.000 --> 02:44:46.000
And multiplayer and so forth

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
And that was kind of a, like it made a lot of sense when he said it

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:51.000
And I was like wow that's kind of neat

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:54.000
So, anyway

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:56.000
I think unfortunately Jason is cutting out again

02:44:56.000 --> 02:44:58.000
So I'm going to have to go ahead and end the call

02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:00.000
And just hope that he has a safe drive

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:02.000
On his way back there

02:45:02.000 --> 02:45:05.000
And hopefully he'll be able to hear this on the podcast feed or something else later

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
But I am going to go ahead and open up the Skype line again

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
At 1877 Game OLR

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
Or username on Skype Orange Lounge Radio

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
You know we don't often get called from moving vehicles

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
So that one was a little bit special

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
But anyway it is lighting up again

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
So let's get to the next call

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
Hi you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
Hello Rob

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
Hey it's Marissa, how are you?

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
I'm good, how are you?

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
Good, great to hear from you, what's on your mind my friend?

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
I feel very rude

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
Because I only had the opportunity to tune in just now

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
But I'm always happy to hear the show

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
That's okay, it's a long show

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
It's a long commitment to listen to the whole show, I understand

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
That's true

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
Yeah I was out and about also

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
But you were talking about scary games

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
And actually Chris and I have been playing

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
The Walking Dead game together

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
And slowly and surely we've been learning

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
That I'm the more depraved one

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
Based on our decisions

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
So you let that person live

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
You're an asshole

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
We learn new things about each other

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
So in other words

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
With the difficult choices you make in that game

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
For instance, there's some scenes

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
In that game where it's like, do you want to save

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000
This person or this person

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
And so you probably, you know, save a person

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
And so Chris will probably

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
You know, be like, why would you want to save that person?

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
Right, you guys kind of get into those type of arguments

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
I've learned that I am a cold ass

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
Motherfucker

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
And my boyfriend

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
Is a sweet, thoughtful man

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
That's what I have learned

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
Like why would you let that person

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
Live, he was an asshole anyway

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
You know

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
He was dead weight, you gotta keep moving honey

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
Now I'm sure you are sweet and thoughtful

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
Aplenty in real life

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
But it's just the video games bring out

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
The worst in you, which is fine

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
It happens to me too

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
Yeah, don't defend the media's position, right?

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
Exactly

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000
Actually

02:46:53.000 --> 02:46:55.000
I did have some

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
Some news too, it's not directly

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
Game related, but for anybody that likes

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
Sci-fi or on the video

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
Game side, for anyone that

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
Really enjoyed The Scarecrow

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
Scarecrow

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
I've had a long day

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
Scarecrow

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
Not the most recent

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
But the previous Batman games

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
Is played by Dino Andrade

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
I'm part of an audio

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
Podcast or radio drama

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
With our friend Ben, who has called in a few times

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
He also hosts the show Port Center

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
On YouTube

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
And we're releasing one a month

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000
It's called Jump Leads, it was based on a popular webcomic

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000
So I'm excited to announce

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
That for anybody that likes Red Dwarf

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000
And Doctor Who

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
And everything British and fun

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
I feel like I've known Dino

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
Online forever

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
We've followed each other on Twitter

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000
Since the beginning

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000
I missed him at Dragon Con

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
Because you never know what the schedule

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
Is actually going to be

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
I've got to message him offline

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
Now that things have calmed down a bit

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
Hopefully with convention season

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
And try to get him on the show

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
He's one of the best voice actors here

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
At Orange Launch Radio

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
Have you guys talked about the strike?

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
We brought it up last week

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
I wasn't sure if I wanted to go there with you

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
But since you said it

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
I'm going to go there

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
I actually did repost

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
The thing with the terms of the strike

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
And the link to vote on it

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
On my public Facebook

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
My understanding is that

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
They've gone radio silent on that

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
We know it's a possibility

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
We don't know if it's actually happening

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
Or not yet, right?

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
Yeah, it's been pretty quiet

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
And you know

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
It's funny because out of all the nuances

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
Of the whole argument

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
The only thing that I find the most interesting

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
Were people talking about other sides of the industry

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
Not perhaps being fairly compensated

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000
And why should you worry about the actors

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000
First, and I kind of thought

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
So you're saying that everyone should just be equally

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000
Screwed?

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
You know what?

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000
I think a lot of the concerns

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000
And I'm not going to be one to get into the money

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000
Because I don't know how that all works

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
But as far as the whole

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
Having certain rules

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
Like going into the studio and screaming

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
For four hours on end

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
What's funny is that when you helped us out

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
And we got Greg

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
And those guys on the show

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
The fact that they were talking about

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
Oh, does your agent make sure that you only get the two

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
It kind of dawned on me

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
Oh yeah, not everybody gets that

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:28.000
So kind of setting those sort of

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:30.000
What are essentially safety

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:32.000
Safe working conditions

02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:34.000
I think is more than fair

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:36.000
So for that side of things

02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:38.000
And again, I'm not going to get into the money things

02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:40.000
I just don't know

02:49:40.000 --> 02:49:42.000
But as far as those safety conditions

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:44.000
That seems awfully reasonable

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:46.000
It is, you know I did

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:50.000
I've done things where I've blown out my voice

02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:52.000
I didn't have certainly any protections like that

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
People think that

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
This is a problem that just doesn't affect just acting

02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:00.000
But any career where there's some sort of artistic end to it

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:03.000
They think because you get some sort of satisfaction out of it

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
That it's okay

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
Or it's not a big deal

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
Well yeah, it's not okay if you scream once

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
But if you scream for four hours

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
You can ruin your instrument

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
And video games

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000
For actors it can be

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
One of the most rewarding

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
Because of the amount of dialogue

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:24.000
And story can also be one of the most grueling

02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.000
But you know

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
On the money thing

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
Regardless of the specifics

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:32.000
People deserve to be compensated

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:34.000
Fairly for their time

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:36.000
No matter what their job is

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.000
Of course

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
This also goes out to all my friends

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
That are graphic designers

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:44.000
People that work in fields

02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:46.000
That involve computers

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:48.000
Or musicians or photographers

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:50.000
Where people go

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:52.000
My nephew is good with computers

02:50:52.000 --> 02:50:54.000
So I'll just have them do it

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000
You want things done right

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.000
You need skilled, hardworking people

02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.000
And I've heard most often

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:02.000
The argument about how

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
Certain sides of the video game industry

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
Aren't fairly compensated

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:08.000
Well everybody should be then

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:10.000
I know what to tell you

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:12.000
There's a lot of people

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:14.000
There's a lot of people out there that say

02:51:14.000 --> 02:51:16.000
Well if the voice actors just go on strike

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000
And do it for free

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.000
But you are right in that regard

02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:22.000
That well you'll get what you pay for

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:24.000
And we'll be back in the era of 90's CD-ROM games

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
When the acting wasn't quite what it is today

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:28.000
If that makes sense

02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:30.000
Well you know that's

02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:32.000
That's kind of affected

02:51:32.000 --> 02:51:34.000
The industry as a whole

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:36.000
I mean again it's not just voice acting

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:38.000
That's been affected by this proliferation of

02:51:38.000 --> 02:51:40.000
Competition for jobs on the internet

02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000
And driving down of prices

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000
But you know that aside

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.000
It is interesting when I see people that say that

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000
Well I'll just do it for really cheap

02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:50.000
And then I'm going to get this great exposure

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:52.000
And this great gig

02:51:52.000 --> 02:51:54.000
Well that's wonderful but

02:51:54.000 --> 02:51:56.000
That sustaining career that you want

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:58.000
Isn't going to be there for you then

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:00.000
At the end of the day

02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:02.000
So you're like

02:52:02.000 --> 02:52:04.000
Oh I'll do this thing really cheap right now

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:06.000
And that's going to give me all the exposure I need

02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:08.000
And that's going to skyrocket me to the top

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
When I'm going to do what I love for a living

02:52:10.000 --> 02:52:12.000
But if you do that then that career isn't going to exist

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:14.000
Well I hope they can

02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:16.000
I hope they can all work it out

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:18.000
I hope they can hug it out

02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:20.000
And figure this stuff out

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:22.000
And you have some support in chat

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000
In our chatroom over at live.fognetwork.com

02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:26.000
I'm definitely with Marissa on this one

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:28.000
And Dungeon Buster says that could be the future

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.000
Without skilled voice actors

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:32.000
Not even the 90's look up

02:52:32.000 --> 02:52:34.000
Chaos Wars voice acting on Google or YouTube

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:36.000
Classic 90's bad acting

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:38.000
Resident Evil nuff said says Raginator

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:40.000
Anyway

02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:42.000
You know what? This is easy

02:52:42.000 --> 02:52:44.000
So you deserve to be played less

02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:46.000
Yeah but I

02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:48.000
I mentioned this last week on the show

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:50.000
When I've done Rocky Horror and emceed that show

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:52.000
And I'm on stage for maybe 20-30 minutes

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.000
And I'm kind of yelling

02:52:54.000 --> 02:52:56.000
Then I come in

02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:58.000
By the way I have a show I should plug this

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:00.000
Because I didn't earlier

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:02.000
But for those that do happen to be local here in Sacramento

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:04.000
I am going to be hosting Rocky Horror at the Colonial

02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:06.000
On Saturday at I think 10.30 pm

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:08.000
As part of the 9th annual Sacramento Horror Film Festival

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:10.000
I've been fortunate enough to be asked back to do that

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:12.000
But when I come in here next week

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:14.000
You guys should fully expect

02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:16.000
Hi everybody this is Rob Roberts

02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:18.000
Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio

02:53:18.000 --> 02:53:20.000
I just smoked four packs and came on air

02:53:20.000 --> 02:53:22.000
That's what it's going to be

02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:24.000
Yeah and sometimes you know

02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:26.000
This can be complete BS

02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:28.000
But to me it always seems that

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:30.000
When I run my voice ragged

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:32.000
It makes me more vulnerable to sickness

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:34.000
Yeah and I'm worried about that

02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:36.000
Because there's something going around

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.000
Anytime you wear your body down

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:40.000
You're making it more vulnerable to sickness

02:53:40.000 --> 02:53:42.000
Anyway Marissa I hate to do this

02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:44.000
But I got to wrap up so we can wrap up the show

02:53:44.000 --> 02:53:46.000
Because we're running a little long

02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:48.000
Thank you so much for the call

02:53:48.000 --> 02:53:50.000
It's always good to hear from you

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:52.000
Alright take care

02:53:52.000 --> 02:53:54.000
Alright I think that is actually going to do it for the skype line tonight

02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:56.000
Because I know Jamie wants to go get pie

02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:58.000
And I have some other things I want to take care of around here

02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:00.000
We are after midnight on the east coast

02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:02.000
So I want to go ahead and move to wrap things up

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:04.000
But I do want to check in and make sure

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:06.000
Are there any last minute stories or things we want to bring up here?

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:08.000
Crowdfunding started for them's fighting herds

02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:10.000
So if you want to back that

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:12.000
You can check that out on Indiegogo

02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:14.000
That's right I remember hearing about that a couple weeks ago

02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:16.000
They're already at about

02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:18.000
Just over halfway

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:20.000
About 200,000 from goal

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:22.000
With 17 days left

02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:24.000
Nice

02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:26.000
Alright

02:54:26.000 --> 02:54:28.000
If that's it for last minute stories

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:30.000
There was one other thing I saw

02:54:30.000 --> 02:54:32.000
They have more

02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:34.000
They have more footage

02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:36.000
Of an unreleased Nintendo 64 game

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:38.000
It was a sequel to the Neo Geo

02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:40.000
Shooter Viewpoint

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:42.000
Called Viewpoint 2064

02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:44.000
Yeah

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:46.000
It's kind of random

02:54:46.000 --> 02:54:48.000
I guess it was from a prototype

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:50.000
Cartridge that someone bought on eBay

02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:52.000
I'm liking all these

02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:54.000
Unreleased games

02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:56.000
Unearthed prototypes

02:54:56.000 --> 02:54:58.000
It's always kind of fun to see what we might have missed out on

02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:00.000
Alright

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:02.000
Well we're going to wind down here for another week here at Orange Lounge Radio

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.000
But hey I want to really thank you guys

02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:06.000
For tuning in and listening to our show

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:08.000
Whether it be live or in the podcast forum

02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:10.000
We really appreciate it

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:12.000
And thank you guys so much for participating

02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:14.000
If you liked what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio

02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:16.000
Please consider telling a friend or two

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:18.000
About the show because word of mouth is really all we have

02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:20.000
We'd appreciate a tweet

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:22.000
You want to tweet? Hey guys listen to OLR

02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:24.000
We would love that so much, thank you so much

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.000
And a five star review

02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.000
On iTunes or Stitcher Radio

02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:30.000
I know all your favorite podcasts ask you

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:32.000
But we're all asking you for a reason

02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.000
Because it goes a long way

02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:36.000
So we really appreciate that

02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.000
And that is going to bring us to a close

02:55:38.000 --> 02:55:40.000
Here at another week of Orange Lounge Radio

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:42.000
Great show tonight everybody

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:44.000
Thank you Steve-O from Jackbox Games

02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:46.000
For coming on the show tonight

02:55:46.000 --> 02:55:48.000
And I want to thank Evan over at Jackbox Games

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:50.000
For helping to arrange that

02:55:50.000 --> 02:55:52.000
So thank you very much

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:54.000
Big thanks to Jackbox Games

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.000
For supporting the show

02:55:56.000 --> 02:55:58.000
Best of luck with Jackbox Party Pack 2

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:00.000
I know I will be there checking that out

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:02.000
As will I'm sure most of us here in studio

02:56:02.000 --> 02:56:04.000
And our listenership out there

02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:06.000
So it's time to go around

02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:08.000
And get everybody's final thought

02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.000
Tonight here on the show

02:56:10.000 --> 02:56:12.000
Darce Agro we haven't heard from you in a little bit

02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:14.000
We'll start with you, what's your final thought here tonight?

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:16.000
I'm Mrs. Marissa

02:56:16.000 --> 02:56:18.000
Me too, I haven't been to Southern California

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:20.000
In a long time

02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:22.000
Let's just go, except I feel depressed going down

02:56:22.000 --> 02:56:24.000
And also not going to Disneyland

02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:26.000
It's that whole new job time off thing

02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:28.000
I can't get time off until December

02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:32.000
Let's all just meet up at the Bravo Cheese Farm

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:34.000
There you go, meet halfway

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:36.000
Alright

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.000
Let's see, my final thought tonight

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:40.000
I want to wish a happy early

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:42.000
500th episode of Bobby Black Wolf

02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:44.000
Because next week is his 500th episode

02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:46.000
So tonight was $4.99

02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:48.000
And I just want to make sure I did not forget

02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:50.000
To give him his kudos where it's due

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:52.000
Bobby Black Wolf is

02:56:52.000 --> 02:56:54.000
A big reason why O.L.R. is still going

02:56:54.000 --> 02:56:56.000
After all these years because there was a period of time

02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:58.000
Where we were going to

02:56:58.000 --> 02:57:00.000
Not be a live show anymore

02:57:00.000 --> 02:57:02.000
And Bobby helped save that

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:04.000
So we were able to do live

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:06.000
We were going to be a dead show

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:08.000
I don't know if we were going to be dead

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:10.000
But it would just be a very different show

02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:12.000
So thank you Bobby for keeping it live

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:14.000
Congrats to the discipline it's taken you

02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:16.000
To get all the way to 500 episodes

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:18.000
Last but not least, Loki

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:20.000
Your final thought tonight

02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.000
I don't know

02:57:22.000 --> 02:57:24.000
I'm thinking

02:57:24.000 --> 02:57:26.000
I'm at that awkward point where you decide whether or not

02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:28.000
You're going to make a costume for Halloween

02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:30.000
And you know instead

02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:32.000
Much like my game project

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:34.000
Instead of doing something simple

02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:36.000
It's either extremely complicated or nothing

02:57:36.000 --> 02:57:38.000
In the wise words of one

02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:40.000
Shia LaBeouf

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:42.000
Do it!

02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:44.000
Just do it!

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:46.000
So I guess we're being

02:57:46.000 --> 02:57:48.000
Listened to by Becky and Julian

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:50.000
Oh are we?

02:57:50.000 --> 02:57:52.000
If Mother approves

02:57:52.000 --> 02:57:54.000
Because sometimes we get a little R-rated

02:57:54.000 --> 02:57:56.000
But I guess we can watch our F and Mals

02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:58.000
While Julian's here

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:00.000
We can try

02:58:00.000 --> 02:58:02.000
There you go, so we'll try

02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:04.000
Well I have to know, what game is Julian going to talk about?

02:58:04.000 --> 02:58:06.000
Probably Pirates 101 and Lego something

02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:08.000
That's fine, oh is he playing that new Lego game too?

02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:10.000
No I don't think Dimensions

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:12.000
We should do a show

02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:14.000
Where we can bring the kids on

02:58:14.000 --> 02:58:16.000
My son would love to talk about Minecraft

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:18.000
Or whatever it is, the Lego game

02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:20.000
Bring your kid to OLR

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:22.000
It's just like, alright let's do it

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:24.000
You know what, I just say

02:58:24.000 --> 02:58:26.000
Maybe for April Fools next year we'll just let them host

02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:30.000
He gets kind of shy so

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:32.000
I don't know, we'll see

02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:34.000
That would be funny

02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:36.000
I think the listeners would love that

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:38.000
I think they would love that, so we'll have to make that happen

02:58:38.000 --> 02:58:40.000
In a few weeks, so there you go

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:42.000
S2100Matt says if we've done a drunk show

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:44.000
We could do a kids show

02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:46.000
And ActDef says, OLR

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:48.000
Kid tested, mother approved

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:50.000
I think I just got another text

02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:52.000
Just open that up with the themes from Wonder Shows

02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:54.000
So we get

02:58:54.000 --> 02:58:56.000
LOL Minecraft

02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:58.000
You know what, you can never talk enough Minecraft

02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:00.000
So now I have to go over to Becky's and have a cookie

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:02.000
Alright sounds good, have two cookies

02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:04.000
One for me

02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:06.000
That's going to do it, thank you guys so much

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:08.000
For listening to Orange Lounge Radio

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:10.000
And supporting independent broadcasting

02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:12.000
We'll be back to do it again in seven days

02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:14.000
We'll see you then, have a great week everybody

02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:16.000
Good night

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:44.000
See you next week

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:14.000
Thanks for watching!
