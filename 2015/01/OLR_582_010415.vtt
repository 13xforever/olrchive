WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:18.680
Tonight, January 4th, 2015, we begin our 13th year of broadcasting making 2015 gaming

00:18.680 --> 00:23.000
predictions with our listeners, and Sony apologizes for the holiday attacks with free PS Plus

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
time.

00:24.000 --> 00:32.000
Here's more on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.080
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to an all new year of the

00:36.080 --> 00:38.560
show where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.560 --> 00:46.120
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 582 for this January the 4th

00:46.120 --> 00:47.840
of 2015.

00:47.840 --> 00:53.320
Here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle with myself, Rob Roberts,

00:53.320 --> 00:59.200
and with me as always, my co-hosts, beginning our 13th year of broadcasting, say hello to

00:59.200 --> 01:01.360
DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:01.360 --> 01:02.360
Hi.

01:02.360 --> 01:03.360
Hi.

01:03.360 --> 01:04.360
Lucky 13, can you believe it?

01:04.360 --> 01:05.360
Yerp.

01:05.360 --> 01:09.840
Started in 2002, which to be fair, we haven't turned 13 yet, that'll be in June, but still

01:09.840 --> 01:11.360
it's the 13th year of broadcasting.

01:11.360 --> 01:12.360
It's crazy.

01:12.360 --> 01:13.360
Yerp.

01:13.360 --> 01:14.360
I was just thinking about that earlier today.

01:14.360 --> 01:15.360
The show's a teenager.

01:15.360 --> 01:16.360
Yerp.

01:16.360 --> 01:17.360
It's a brat.

01:17.360 --> 01:18.360
It's a brat.

01:18.360 --> 01:19.360
You're the brat.

01:19.360 --> 01:20.360
So?

01:20.360 --> 01:23.080
But you are a brat who brought cookies to the show tonight, so I can't be a hater.

01:23.840 --> 01:26.640
I'm happy, happy you and Alanversary.

01:26.640 --> 01:27.640
Thank you.

01:27.640 --> 01:28.640
I appreciate that.

01:28.640 --> 01:29.640
Yeah.

01:29.640 --> 01:32.400
Today is Alan and I's 5th anniversary, so thank you for acknowledging that.

01:32.400 --> 01:35.080
It would be Alan and Mai.

01:35.080 --> 01:39.680
Anyway, say hello as well to Tech Matt.

01:39.680 --> 01:40.960
Clearly I'm not the grammar master.

01:40.960 --> 01:43.200
Maybe I'll introduce her as that in the future.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.480
But say hello to Tech Master Loki.

01:44.480 --> 01:45.480
Hi.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.480
Hi, Loki.

01:46.480 --> 01:47.480
How are you?

01:47.480 --> 01:48.480
Eating Chinese.

01:48.480 --> 01:49.480
Yeah, you're eating Chinese, which is funny.

01:49.480 --> 01:53.040
Were you jealous of last week when DarkSakura and I were eating Chinese food?

01:53.040 --> 01:54.640
Because let me tell you, don't be.

01:54.640 --> 01:56.480
It made me sick for like four days.

01:56.480 --> 01:58.160
No, I wasn't jealous of that.

01:58.160 --> 02:01.200
I just wanted something different other than the burgers.

02:01.200 --> 02:06.360
Because I had McDonald's yesterday, and I don't know what it is lately, but McDonald's

02:06.360 --> 02:07.360
has just gone downhill.

02:07.360 --> 02:15.840
They used to be sometimes pretty good, but now it's maybe 10% good, 90% garbage, so I've

02:15.840 --> 02:17.520
just stopped going there.

02:17.520 --> 02:22.800
But my son wanted a happy meal or some garbage, so I had to go buy that.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.840
Oh, I thought DarkSakura was reacting to a happy meal over there, she said.

02:25.840 --> 02:30.640
No, I'm getting sick of autocorrect on my computer, and I'm about to turn the shit off.

02:30.640 --> 02:31.640
On your computer?

02:31.640 --> 02:32.640
That's too much.

02:32.640 --> 02:33.640
I'm on a Mac.

02:33.640 --> 02:34.920
I know, but I didn't realize the computers did autocorrect.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.840
I haven't had a Mac laptop in forever.

02:36.840 --> 02:37.840
But anyway.

02:37.840 --> 02:38.840
Sorry, Loki.

02:38.840 --> 02:40.840
So you got your son garbage food at McDonald's.

02:40.840 --> 02:48.120
Yeah, so he had garbage food at McDonald's, and so I got some as well, and it's garbage.

02:48.120 --> 02:51.220
Like the fries are just terrible, it's like eating cardboard.

02:51.220 --> 02:55.660
So I decided I didn't want to have a burger today, so I just stopped and got Chinese,

02:55.660 --> 02:59.060
and the slowest Asian person ever served us.

02:59.060 --> 03:03.220
It took him 20 minutes to serve me and the person in front of me, who only ordered two

03:03.220 --> 03:04.220
things.

03:04.220 --> 03:06.340
I was like, why are these people employed?

03:06.340 --> 03:08.460
Slow and steady wins the race.

03:08.460 --> 03:09.460
There is no race.

03:09.460 --> 03:10.460
He's not racing.

03:10.460 --> 03:11.460
He's just slow.

03:11.460 --> 03:15.340
All right, going to our chat room, which isn't slow tonight.

03:15.340 --> 03:17.140
There's actually a few of you guys over in chat.

03:17.140 --> 03:23.140
We do tape live, of course, every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, www.vognetwork.com.

03:23.140 --> 03:28.180
It's six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

03:28.180 --> 03:34.860
And of course, if you are listening live, you can participate with our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

03:34.860 --> 03:38.460
And you know when we talk about the whole 13 years of OLR, somebody always inevitably

03:38.460 --> 03:39.620
makes a comment like this.

03:39.620 --> 03:40.620
You ready?

03:40.620 --> 03:44.560
SSG100Matt says, I was 19 when I started listening to OLR.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.560
I'm 31 now.

03:46.960 --> 03:47.960
Yeah, thanks.

03:47.960 --> 03:48.960
Thanks.

03:48.960 --> 03:49.960
Thanks for that.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.600
Thank you for that reminder.

03:51.600 --> 03:56.840
Ragenator in chat says, I'm looking forward to OLR episode 666.

03:56.840 --> 04:01.840
You know what's funny is in the old days of OLR, probably around like episode 69, you

04:01.840 --> 04:06.040
know, we got to episode 69, which for its own reasons was a landmark show.

04:06.040 --> 04:10.120
I think we started making jokes about, well, what's the next big number that this show

04:10.120 --> 04:11.120
will hit?

04:11.120 --> 04:13.360
And that's, oh, episode 666.

04:13.360 --> 04:15.320
And we would say, oh, we'll never make that number.

04:15.320 --> 04:19.760
And I think I even plotted it out and I said, you know, if we were to get to episode 666,

04:19.760 --> 04:22.240
we would have to get to like 2016.

04:22.240 --> 04:24.080
And I was always like, oh, we'll never last that long.

04:24.080 --> 04:29.160
And now I'm looking at it going, actually, we probably will get to episode 666.

04:29.160 --> 04:31.040
So we better plan something really special.

04:31.040 --> 04:33.040
And then 669.

04:37.040 --> 04:42.680
Anyway, let's see other comments in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

04:42.680 --> 04:47.280
Locopoco commenting on the food saying, I only go to McDonald's for fries, always order

04:47.280 --> 04:48.440
them without salt.

04:48.440 --> 04:49.440
So they are fresh.

04:49.440 --> 04:51.920
But then they don't have salt on them.

04:51.920 --> 04:52.920
And yes, I understand.

04:52.920 --> 04:55.040
We'll just put your own salt on it.

04:55.040 --> 04:58.000
However, they have like other seasonings that they throw on there.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
So it's not just salt.

04:59.000 --> 05:03.160
I have it on good authority from friends that used to work at McDonald's and even managed

05:03.160 --> 05:06.240
that if you just ask for fresh fries, they'll give them to you.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.520
Just ask, could I get fresh fries?

05:07.520 --> 05:08.520
And they will.

05:08.520 --> 05:11.600
Usually, usually good customer service trumps, you know, whatever else.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.640
Yeah, but I usually think they don't give a shit.

05:13.640 --> 05:18.400
And so I'm not going to ask that because they're just not going to give a shit.

05:18.400 --> 05:21.920
Or like if you go to In-N-Out, which yes, I am going to rub it in everybody's face as

05:21.920 --> 05:25.240
I live in California and therefore have easy access to In-N-Out.

05:25.240 --> 05:26.240
Sorry not.

05:26.240 --> 05:27.240
Sorry.

05:27.240 --> 05:29.040
Uh, the best way to get the fries there are well done.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.040
Always.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.040
Oh, God.

05:31.040 --> 05:32.040
So good.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.040
So good.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.040
Where?

05:34.040 --> 05:35.040
In-N-Out.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.040
Uh-uh.

05:36.040 --> 05:37.040
What?

05:37.040 --> 05:38.040
Nuh-uh.

05:38.040 --> 05:39.040
Animal style.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.040
Oh, no, no, no.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.040
Because Animal Style has the mayonnaise based thing on it.

05:41.480 --> 05:42.480
It's 1000 island and it has mayonnaise.

05:42.480 --> 05:43.480
Which is amazing.

05:43.480 --> 05:45.920
That's, that's mayonnaise and ketchup basically.

05:45.920 --> 05:48.040
Because the only other way to get it is no salt.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.040
Plain.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.040
No.

05:50.040 --> 05:51.040
Which salt is nasty.

05:51.040 --> 05:52.040
No, no, no, no, no.

05:52.040 --> 05:53.040
You can get light salt.

05:53.040 --> 05:54.040
Anyway.

05:54.040 --> 05:59.360
Uh, Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, OLR retiring after 666 episodes confirmed.

05:59.360 --> 06:02.920
You know, it all has to end someday.

06:02.920 --> 06:04.960
Someday there's going to be a final episode of OLR.

06:04.960 --> 06:08.160
And I'm not saying, you know, we know when that is yet or anything, but.

06:08.160 --> 06:11.000
Well, that's the episode that we're going to have Gabe Newell on, right?

06:11.960 --> 06:14.720
I always kind of have thought in the back of my head.

06:14.720 --> 06:19.840
If we are going to end it on a predetermined date, it should be episode 666.

06:19.840 --> 06:20.840
That ought to be it.

06:20.840 --> 06:24.340
But again, I don't, I don't really think, but then I'm like, well, but then we could

06:24.340 --> 06:28.800
also get to 700 and you know, anyway, so it's always like, there'll always be another goal

06:28.800 --> 06:30.120
right after you cross one goal.

06:30.120 --> 06:31.120
There'll always be another goal.

06:31.120 --> 06:34.000
I think that happens to a lot of podcasters like, whoa, we made a year.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.760
Well, now can we make a thousand will be awesome, right?

06:36.760 --> 06:38.720
Then it'll be like, let's get to a thousand.

06:38.720 --> 06:40.700
How many shows did a thousand episodes?

06:40.700 --> 06:41.700
Maybe a few daily shows.

06:41.700 --> 06:45.760
I'm sure some shows that are taped daily probably made a thousand, but I don't think any weekly

06:45.760 --> 06:48.100
shows have gone that far.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.100
Anyway.

06:49.100 --> 06:52.740
Havoc978 in chat says, OLR will be forever.

06:52.740 --> 06:54.340
Well, we like to think so.

06:54.340 --> 06:55.340
You know what?

06:55.340 --> 06:58.960
It's a great way for me to hang out with Dark Soccer and Loki every Sunday.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.860
And that's probably a big part of the reason why it's gone on so long.

07:01.860 --> 07:03.600
It's just, it's, it's our thing.

07:03.600 --> 07:04.600
It's our hangout time.

07:04.600 --> 07:10.020
Just like some people have church, some people have their weekly D and D games, their weekly

07:10.020 --> 07:14.720
meetup to play Nintendo or PlayStation, their weekly meetup to do whatever.

07:14.720 --> 07:15.720
This is our weekly meetup.

07:15.720 --> 07:20.380
And thank you guys for sharing it with us every week here at Orange Lounge Radio.

07:20.380 --> 07:26.220
Anyhow, I want to get into our kickoff topic for tonight and a happy new year to everybody.

07:26.220 --> 07:30.980
I hope you guys had a great new year's Eve and celebrated well.

07:30.980 --> 07:32.740
I don't know what you did, Dark Soccer.

07:32.740 --> 07:34.700
My new year's Eve sucked, just so you know.

07:34.700 --> 07:38.160
My new year's Eve was awful because I had food poisoning.

07:38.160 --> 07:42.160
And so I had two different things I could have done on new year's Eve and I got to do

07:42.160 --> 07:43.160
neither.

07:43.160 --> 07:45.420
Instead I sat home on the couch by myself.

07:45.420 --> 07:48.960
You had two things that you were able to do on new year's Eve.

07:48.960 --> 07:49.960
Fuck off.

07:49.960 --> 07:55.680
I meant I had two parties I was invited to and I couldn't do either one of them.

07:55.680 --> 07:58.880
Instead I had to sit on the couch and I watched the Anderson Cooper and Kathy Griffin, which

07:58.880 --> 08:00.960
you know, at least that was, that was all right.

08:00.960 --> 08:03.520
But Dark Soccer, I hope your new year's Eve was a little brighter.

08:03.520 --> 08:05.040
What'd you end up doing?

08:05.040 --> 08:06.040
Everyone was sick.

08:06.040 --> 08:07.400
Yeah, including me.

08:07.440 --> 08:08.440
Yep.

08:08.440 --> 08:11.080
You missed a child throwing up neon green.

08:11.080 --> 08:12.080
Ew.

08:12.080 --> 08:15.200
But did he do it at midnight?

08:15.200 --> 08:16.200
She.

08:16.200 --> 08:17.200
Cousin Sophia.

08:17.200 --> 08:18.640
Did she do it at midnight?

08:18.640 --> 08:20.560
Well, a little bit before that.

08:20.560 --> 08:26.520
What happened is Sophia had a coughing fit and she had been sucking on one of those blue

08:26.520 --> 08:27.560
Luden's things.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.440
So when she threw up, it was neon green.

08:29.440 --> 08:30.440
That's disgusting.

08:30.440 --> 08:33.320
Someone might have said, I don't know.

08:33.320 --> 08:35.520
And then Midna started sniffing at it.

08:35.520 --> 08:39.520
Now see people that were 19 when they started listening to the show, aren't going to understand

08:39.520 --> 08:40.520
that joke.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.520
That's why you have the internet.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.520
You can look it up.

08:42.520 --> 08:43.520
All right.

08:43.520 --> 08:44.520
Sorry.

08:44.520 --> 08:45.520
Sorry.

08:45.520 --> 08:50.120
So the cousins had to leave with Sophia and then all that was left was, uh, me and Dan

08:50.120 --> 08:57.480
and his little sister and Becky and Julian and Julian stayed up till midnight and then

08:57.480 --> 09:00.840
they left and then Becky took Dan's iPad instead of her Kindle.

09:00.840 --> 09:05.640
So she had to bring it back because Dan's work gave him the iPad.

09:05.640 --> 09:08.120
So that was really the most exciting thing that happened all night.

09:08.120 --> 09:11.200
Dan was playing out runners on the Sega Genesis when the new year rolled in.

09:11.200 --> 09:14.960
I saw the picture on Facebook, so you guys had like a retro gaming new years, right?

09:14.960 --> 09:17.080
Well, Dan had a retro gaming new years.

09:17.080 --> 09:19.880
I was basically drunk fun.

09:19.880 --> 09:25.360
I found out that, okay, I can drink frivolous all night and be a little tipsy.

09:25.360 --> 09:29.120
I can have maybe a shot of hypnotic and be a little tipsy.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.720
Mixing Frivolo and hypnotic, not a good idea.

09:31.720 --> 09:33.720
Wild delicious.

09:33.720 --> 09:34.720
Oh my God.

09:34.720 --> 09:38.440
I was like, Oh, are you supposed to mix wine with other liquor?

09:38.440 --> 09:40.600
Well, I guess that's what sangria is, isn't it?

09:40.600 --> 09:46.400
But still kinda, yeah, but, um, but, uh, I, I just wanted to see what they tasted like

09:46.400 --> 09:50.680
together cause the two flavors are very complimentary and it was really delicious, but I can't have

09:50.680 --> 09:55.760
like more than one glass of that cause my stomach will be like, no, you're not 19 anymore.

09:55.760 --> 09:59.760
You can't drink like, wait, 19, you're not 21 anymore.

09:59.760 --> 10:02.760
You can't drink like that.

10:02.760 --> 10:03.760
Well, come on.

10:03.760 --> 10:05.440
You did grow up in Alabama.

10:05.440 --> 10:08.240
Like, you know, you, you're, you're taking shots by the time you get your driver's license.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.240
I did have that absence when I was 16.

10:10.240 --> 10:11.240
There you go.

10:11.240 --> 10:12.240
Now the real thing.

10:12.240 --> 10:14.600
Now I'm plotting for dragon con 2015.

10:14.600 --> 10:15.600
Some of these drinks.

10:15.600 --> 10:16.600
Anyway.

10:16.600 --> 10:17.840
Uh, Loki, how was your new year's Eve?

10:17.840 --> 10:22.040
I imagine with the kids, you probably didn't get to do any big noisy parties, but did you

10:22.040 --> 10:23.360
celebrate with them?

10:23.360 --> 10:30.000
Um, well we went to, um, my wife's, um, mother's house and we had food there as we do every

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
year.

10:31.000 --> 10:36.480
And so she made all sorts of things, matzo ball soup and chicken and that was really

10:36.480 --> 10:37.480
good.

10:37.480 --> 10:38.480
Homemade matzo ball soup is amazing.

10:38.480 --> 10:40.800
Homemade matzo ball soup is amazing.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.800
And um, the chicken that she made was great.

10:42.800 --> 10:46.200
It was with, uh, Jack Daniels that she like cooked it in.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.080
So good.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.840
And so, um, yeah, that.

10:49.840 --> 10:56.280
And then everybody kind of went to bed, you know, pretty early cause who cares?

10:56.280 --> 10:59.140
Kids don't, you know, go sleep anyways.

10:59.140 --> 11:04.200
And then, um, then everyone woke up at midnight when all the booming went off.

11:04.200 --> 11:06.800
Sound like someone like exploding stuff.

11:06.800 --> 11:12.000
What are the people even, they don't even sell fireworks, like mortars or something.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.520
It was like super loud and then like it woke up everybody.

11:15.520 --> 11:18.440
I'm like, how is that supposed to celebrate the new year?

11:18.760 --> 11:19.760
Now the kids are awake.

11:19.760 --> 11:20.760
Thank you.

11:20.760 --> 11:21.760
Oh my God.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.760
It's like, why do I even bother?

11:23.760 --> 11:24.760
Wow.

11:24.760 --> 11:29.680
All right, well this is the time of year with the new years that a lot of people start making

11:29.680 --> 11:34.160
their new year's resolutions and look, I know some of you can kind of give or take a lot

11:34.160 --> 11:37.720
of these new year's resolutions, but it is a part of culture that this is something people

11:37.720 --> 11:38.720
do.

11:38.720 --> 11:42.760
And even if you hate new year's resolutions with a passion, I still think as a gamer,

11:42.760 --> 11:48.240
a lot of us tend to make their goals for 2015 like, Oh, there's this XYZ game.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.760
I've never played that I really want to play.

11:50.760 --> 11:55.960
Or, um, there's this other, you know, I want to beat more games in the year or 300 games

11:55.960 --> 11:59.960
that are in my steam library that I have to install and play at some rate, right?

11:59.960 --> 12:02.680
So I actually asked the listeners earlier this week, I was like, what were some of the

12:02.680 --> 12:04.040
resolutions you guys have?

12:04.040 --> 12:06.440
What are some of the new year's gaming resolutions you guys have?

12:06.440 --> 12:10.520
Uh, and some of the answers that came in, uh, ACHP said by resolution the last few years

12:10.520 --> 12:12.440
was to beat two games a month.

12:12.440 --> 12:17.560
It's surprisingly difficult to do, but I succeeded the last two years going to try again this

12:17.560 --> 12:21.080
year, finished geometry wars three today, one down for January.

12:21.080 --> 12:22.080
That's great.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.080
I'm still working on geo wars three.

12:23.080 --> 12:27.320
Uh, and ER said my resolution should be to not buy so many games.

12:27.320 --> 12:30.040
My poor backlog, but I know I'll never keep it.

12:30.040 --> 12:35.760
And do chalk said my resolution is to pour much less time into MMOs.

12:35.760 --> 12:38.920
Time investment likely served better elsewhere.

12:38.920 --> 12:42.880
I w I wish I could say something similar just because you guys all know I'm an MMO addict.

12:42.880 --> 12:44.920
I have another show dedicated to MMOs.

12:44.920 --> 12:47.520
I did cancel my wow account.

12:47.520 --> 12:51.880
I'm sorry to say to my wow playing friends, but now I'm just playing final fantasy 14

12:51.880 --> 12:53.640
twice as much.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.320
So that's not really helping either.

12:55.320 --> 12:57.480
Uh, what about you guys?

12:57.480 --> 13:00.080
What are some of your gaming resolutions?

13:00.080 --> 13:03.600
I don't know if you guys have any dark star or goals if you want to stay away from the

13:03.600 --> 13:07.320
word resolutions, but, uh, Loki, dark soccer, anything for you guys?

13:07.320 --> 13:12.680
I'm going to finish borderlands two on my Mac.

13:12.680 --> 13:15.640
This is a follow up to the discussion that's going on in chat right now.

13:15.640 --> 13:16.640
Isn't it?

13:16.640 --> 13:17.640
Yes.

13:17.640 --> 13:22.360
Which I've been playing on my Mac.

13:22.360 --> 13:23.360
Fair enough.

13:23.360 --> 13:25.680
Uh, so you're gonna, but you're going to be borderlands too.

13:25.680 --> 13:26.680
What about, what about the pre-sequel?

13:26.680 --> 13:29.360
Why don't you just play the whole trilogy sequel yet?

13:29.360 --> 13:34.280
What I promised Dan, I would play through the first two with him before I get the pre-sequel

13:34.280 --> 13:36.280
and by the time I'm ready for the pre-sequel, it'll be cheap.

13:36.280 --> 13:37.280
It'll be on sale.

13:37.280 --> 13:38.280
Yeah.

13:38.280 --> 13:39.280
Really?

13:39.280 --> 13:40.400
And you just need to finish borderlands two before the pre-sequel even makes sense.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.040
Cause it's like, who are these characters?

13:42.040 --> 13:43.040
Yeah.

13:43.040 --> 13:44.040
What are they doing?

13:44.040 --> 13:47.080
Well, I mean, I already have watched Dan play through most of, uh, borderlands two anyway,

13:47.080 --> 13:48.520
so I know all the characters and everything.

13:48.520 --> 13:53.140
Um, it's just that he was usually busy playing multiplayer with his buddies and I never had

13:53.140 --> 13:54.140
a chance to.

13:54.140 --> 13:55.140
Mm hmm.

13:55.140 --> 13:57.440
So, um, Loki, what about you?

13:57.440 --> 14:00.120
Any, any re gaming goals for the year?

14:00.120 --> 14:02.360
Um, how about finish your damn game?

14:02.360 --> 14:03.360
That's one of them.

14:03.360 --> 14:05.360
I was going to say that.

14:05.360 --> 14:06.360
Both of them.

14:06.360 --> 14:07.360
Um, yeah.

14:07.360 --> 14:11.720
Uh, so there, there's that, I do want to finish my games.

14:11.720 --> 14:16.240
Um, I kind of want to finish, um, platinum in Lego Marvel superheroes.

14:16.240 --> 14:22.120
I would have had it done by now, but my damn son wouldn't play any of the levels.

14:22.120 --> 14:23.400
I'm like, you don't have to do anything.

14:23.400 --> 14:27.240
He's like, but yeah, but you need me to do specific things at certain times.

14:27.240 --> 14:30.400
I'm like, not since I've already played through them all already.

14:30.400 --> 14:33.600
I just need you to sit there and hit things and that's it.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.400
And he's like, no, I don't want to do that.

14:35.400 --> 14:36.400
I'm afraid of the levels.

14:36.400 --> 14:37.640
I'm like, fine.

14:37.640 --> 14:41.300
So I can't finish any of them and I don't have time to play it right now while I'm working

14:41.880 --> 14:42.880
on my vlog jam games.

14:42.880 --> 14:51.460
So, um, I don't know, I just want to finish that and then I don't really know what else

14:51.460 --> 14:52.460
I'll play.

14:52.460 --> 14:55.740
I guess get through the other games I bought for my PlayStation 4 that I haven't even played

14:55.740 --> 14:56.740
yet.

14:56.740 --> 15:00.580
Like I have Infamous I've started and then I have Destiny that I haven't touched yet

15:00.580 --> 15:05.300
and I have Watch Dogs that's collecting dust, so there's that.

15:05.300 --> 15:09.960
Even just getting through the backlog of stuff that I have on PC and my Steam library, on

15:10.080 --> 15:17.920
Xbox Live in all the Games for Gold stuff and even with PlayStation on the PlayStation

15:17.920 --> 15:18.920
Plus stuff.

15:18.920 --> 15:23.720
I have tons of things I haven't played yet and I'm still a fucking idiot and keep buying

15:23.720 --> 15:24.960
more things.

15:24.960 --> 15:25.960
I don't know why.

15:25.960 --> 15:28.800
Oh, I know why because I want those things and I need them bad.

15:28.800 --> 15:29.800
They're shiny.

15:29.800 --> 15:30.800
You need them.

15:30.800 --> 15:34.140
It's just like I bought the DLC for, all the DLC for Lego Marvel Super Heroes.

15:34.140 --> 15:35.140
There's no reason to it.

15:35.140 --> 15:39.400
The characters are fucking stupid and it was overpriced, but I did it anyway so that it

15:39.400 --> 15:43.080
would have something different to play as in the game because I'm getting so bored of

15:43.080 --> 15:44.080
it right now.

15:44.080 --> 15:47.520
So my son seriously plays that for hours at a time and just runs around.

15:47.520 --> 15:52.520
Now I showed him one of the levels he can go into and break things.

15:52.520 --> 15:53.520
So my gaming goals.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.960
I need to get some platinum trophies.

15:54.960 --> 15:57.520
I think I have maybe one on all of PlayStation games.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.240
If that, I actually may not have any.

15:59.240 --> 16:02.360
So it's high time I get some platinum trophies and I already know what games I want them

16:02.360 --> 16:03.360
in.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.440
I want them in Diablo 3, Reaper of Souls, because I know it's achievable.

16:05.440 --> 16:06.840
It's not a super hard platinum.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.920
It just takes a little bit of grinding because you have to get one of every class to level

16:09.920 --> 16:11.400
70, but it's doable.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.800
It's like way more than doable.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.120
It's just going to take a little patience.

16:14.120 --> 16:20.360
So I want to get one there and I really think I can get one in Final Fantasy 14, which there's

16:20.360 --> 16:22.960
some, you know, I have to do like a thousand fates and a thousand.

16:22.960 --> 16:26.880
Are they as ridiculous as the ones in Final Fantasy 11?

16:26.880 --> 16:31.680
Well, they're not as bad in 11 now after they implemented the whole fact that you can XP

16:31.680 --> 16:34.560
with a party of people like.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.560
Yeah, at the time it was like, Oh, get me 75.

16:37.280 --> 16:40.880
It's a little easier now, but yeah, I want to get a platinum in Final Fantasy 14, which

16:40.880 --> 16:42.360
I think is definitely achievable.

16:42.360 --> 16:46.240
The hardest one's going to be clearing turn five on PlayStation four, but I know I can

16:46.240 --> 16:47.240
do it.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.240
I know I can do it because I've cleared it on PC.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.280
There's no reason I can't do it on PS4.

16:50.280 --> 16:53.320
So those are some of my immediate goals.

16:53.320 --> 17:00.600
I want to do more with broadcasting like YouTube and live streams because I end up right now

17:00.600 --> 17:05.420
doing a live stream like maybe every two weeks and I want to bump that up to more like maybe

17:05.420 --> 17:09.140
two a week now that I have a little more time because I'm not doing the performance

17:09.140 --> 17:11.900
stuff anymore and I want to do more YouTubes.

17:11.900 --> 17:14.220
I really miss that Let's Remember series I was doing.

17:14.220 --> 17:19.900
I think it's fun to visit really, really old games that define my childhood and kind of

17:19.900 --> 17:22.820
introduce them to people who might've missed them or only seen them for like 30 seconds

17:22.820 --> 17:23.900
or only read about them.

17:23.900 --> 17:25.060
So I really want to bring that back.

17:25.060 --> 17:27.700
So those are some of my goals for 2015.

17:27.700 --> 17:29.100
So I'm really excited about that.

17:29.100 --> 17:31.220
So hopefully I stay on track.

17:31.220 --> 17:32.540
Just a few more from the listenership.

17:32.540 --> 17:37.020
Some answers over here on Google+, Tom W saying, I'm going to play at least 80% of

17:37.020 --> 17:38.020
my Steam library.

17:38.020 --> 17:40.140
I'm currently sitting at 51%.

17:40.140 --> 17:43.780
But does that mean like actually play or just load?

17:43.780 --> 17:47.540
I hope you actually play, you got to beat at least the first level in all of them.

17:47.540 --> 17:52.920
And Martin C replies and says, trying to steer clear from games that are too much of a time

17:52.920 --> 17:55.460
sink since my free time is limited.

17:55.460 --> 18:00.780
I'm going to try to play more story driven games that feel more fulfilling to complete.

18:00.780 --> 18:01.780
Interesting.

18:02.020 --> 18:04.940
Yeah, see, that's kind of like, I'm kind of with you there.

18:04.940 --> 18:10.540
I love games that are big in scope, like Elder Scrolls, you know, you know, five Skyrim or

18:10.540 --> 18:11.540
something like that.

18:11.540 --> 18:12.540
That was awesome.

18:12.540 --> 18:13.540
That game is awesome.

18:13.540 --> 18:15.760
But I think it's like you could spend hundreds of hours in it.

18:15.760 --> 18:20.300
And I kind of like, that's why I like playing some of the Call of Duty games because the

18:20.300 --> 18:22.100
campaign is so short.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.100
It's done.

18:23.100 --> 18:24.100
Cool.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.100
I'm done.

18:25.100 --> 18:26.100
All right.

18:26.100 --> 18:27.100
If I want to play multiplayer, I can do that.

18:27.100 --> 18:28.100
But I don't feel like I haven't completed anything in this.

18:28.100 --> 18:29.100
And it's easy.

18:29.100 --> 18:32.860
If you want me to get all the trophies or whatever, because it's all single player stuff,

18:32.860 --> 18:33.860
sweet.

18:33.860 --> 18:34.860
And that's it.

18:34.860 --> 18:40.060
You know, whereas, you know, if I want to like 100% Skyrim, that's quite a lot of time.

18:40.060 --> 18:45.140
Now, granted, that's enjoyable, but sometimes you just want to play other things.

18:45.140 --> 18:49.020
And I think it's probably way more fulfilling to beat a game that's going to take you, you

18:49.020 --> 18:53.220
know, 60 hours to beat like, I don't know, Dragon Age Inquisition or Skyrim or something

18:53.220 --> 18:58.340
like that, as opposed to, I don't know, something like Flower, which I don't want to diminish

18:58.340 --> 18:59.340
that game.

18:59.340 --> 19:02.320
It's an amazing game in its own right, but it's only a two hour game.

19:02.320 --> 19:05.620
It's an amazing two hour experience and I recommend it for everybody.

19:05.620 --> 19:10.060
But, you know, I think beating a game that takes that like 60 hour investment probably

19:10.060 --> 19:13.980
is worth, you know, especially if you're the guy, like that comment I read earlier, that's

19:13.980 --> 19:19.260
doing two games a month, maybe give yourself more credit if you beat a BioWare game or

19:19.260 --> 19:24.900
something versus, you know, oh, I beat, you know, a game that took me two hours to beat

19:24.900 --> 19:25.900
type of thing.

19:25.900 --> 19:26.900
Like quality over quality.

19:26.900 --> 19:30.100
Well, I don't even want to say quality though, because like, you know, again, a game like

19:30.100 --> 19:32.820
Gone Home was short.

19:32.820 --> 19:35.900
And you know, I know some people even argue if that's a game period, but I think it is

19:35.900 --> 19:40.960
an interactive experience that is absolutely worth experiencing, but it is short.

19:40.960 --> 19:41.960
You know what I mean?

19:41.960 --> 19:47.540
So in terms of, you know, your goals, I don't know if I would use the word quality, but

19:47.540 --> 19:51.700
maybe just, you know, give the number of hours that it took you to beat something a little

19:51.700 --> 19:52.700
more credit, I suppose.

19:52.700 --> 19:53.700
Right?

19:53.700 --> 19:54.700
Yeah.

19:54.700 --> 20:01.620
I remember seeing that, and the whole thing that, you know, Todd McFarland designed characters

20:01.620 --> 20:03.460
and that was pretty sweet.

20:03.460 --> 20:07.380
I thought that was one of the games with gold titles or something.

20:07.380 --> 20:13.940
I thought it's in my library somewhere maybe, but yeah, maybe, I don't know.

20:13.940 --> 20:19.500
I keep staring at, you know, Dragon Age, you know, Inquisition and Far Cry 4, I'm like,

20:19.500 --> 20:21.100
eh, don't want to buy these.

20:21.100 --> 20:24.260
You know, if you want, Loki, if you promise to bring it back next week, you can borrow

20:24.300 --> 20:26.580
my copy of Inquisition just to give it a try and save it your every hour.

20:26.580 --> 20:27.580
I'm not going to time.

20:27.580 --> 20:28.580
It's not good, unfortunately.

20:28.580 --> 20:29.580
Alright, fair enough.

20:29.580 --> 20:35.420
Alright, well, we are going to get into our gaming weeks here shortly, however, I have

20:35.420 --> 20:40.320
one more kickoff topic to get into tonight, and tonight, you know, being that it was a

20:40.320 --> 20:44.180
slower news week, admittedly, we don't have a lot of huge stories tonight, you know, it's

20:44.180 --> 20:49.420
just the way it is, we're going to get into our 2015 predictions tonight, which here at

20:49.420 --> 20:51.300
OLR can sometimes be a little silly.

20:51.300 --> 20:53.300
We're not necessarily that they're always going to be accurate.

20:54.300 --> 20:58.540
But we're going to do that through a highly scientific process known as listless, and

20:58.540 --> 21:00.740
we'll get to that a little later in the show.

21:00.740 --> 21:08.500
But I thought it would be fun to go back and look at our 2014 list and see what came true

21:08.500 --> 21:12.740
and what didn't come true from that list, the 2014 list.

21:12.740 --> 21:18.160
Now the number one answer from the process as voted on by our listeners last year was

21:18.160 --> 21:20.020
from Dark Sakura's original list.

21:20.020 --> 21:22.580
I'm looking at the entire list of 15 answers.

21:22.860 --> 21:26.340
We had five hosts participate last year because we had Jason in studio, and that was during

21:26.340 --> 21:30.700
the period of time that Loki was calling in because of the new baby.

21:30.700 --> 21:33.340
We had Alan in here as well.

21:33.340 --> 21:39.180
So one of Jamie's answers ultimately end up winning the listless, and her answer was gaming

21:39.180 --> 21:41.980
created advances in accessibility.

21:41.980 --> 21:46.820
In other words, there would be some type of gaming advancement that would lead towards

21:46.820 --> 21:52.120
more accessibility for handicapped or, you know, accessible gamers.

21:52.160 --> 21:54.720
So looking at that, what's that?

21:54.720 --> 21:57.080
Which I think has happened in a few different ways.

21:57.080 --> 21:58.080
I wasn't really sure.

21:58.080 --> 22:00.200
I mean, this is kind of a gray area answer.

22:00.200 --> 22:01.760
How do you think it's happened, Dark Sakura?

22:01.760 --> 22:06.760
Because I didn't see anything really clear cut, but I do feel like companies are more

22:06.760 --> 22:07.760
aware.

22:07.760 --> 22:08.760
Definitely.

22:08.760 --> 22:14.180
Improvement in motion control, improvement in voice action activated, and looking in

22:14.180 --> 22:23.940
terms of PC gaming, you've got improved, they're actually, I've run across, I mean, the devices

22:23.940 --> 22:26.060
have been out for a while, but they're really getting a lot more advanced.

22:26.060 --> 22:30.780
You have braille keyboards, you know, all kinds of ways that people are able to actually

22:30.780 --> 22:34.280
interact with their games by getting their dialogue on a braille feedback pad.

22:34.280 --> 22:38.360
You know, I would love to see something like that come out on a console, but I mean, we're

22:38.360 --> 22:39.540
seeing it more and more.

22:39.540 --> 22:41.760
It's slow, but it's still happening.

22:41.760 --> 22:42.760
That's true.

22:43.280 --> 22:46.940
At the end of the day, there's definitely been more of an awareness, even if we haven't

22:46.940 --> 22:53.080
seen like, here is the physical piece of technology that actually made accessibility happen more.

22:53.080 --> 22:56.660
I think we've definitely seen an awareness, and I think a large part of that is thanks

22:56.660 --> 23:01.960
to organizations like AbleGamers and a lot of activism you see out there on the internet,

23:01.960 --> 23:04.380
like trying to make companies more aware.

23:04.380 --> 23:08.840
There are reasons you should have keys be mappable in games and things like this, and

23:08.840 --> 23:10.880
buttons mappable on controllers.

23:10.880 --> 23:14.840
I kind of give that answer half credit.

23:14.840 --> 23:18.520
Even though there was like nothing black and white, we still are in a better spot now,

23:18.520 --> 23:20.080
I think, than we were in 2014.

23:20.080 --> 23:21.080
So there's that.

23:21.080 --> 23:24.920
So, yay us, question mark.

23:24.920 --> 23:28.620
Here's the rest of the answers on Dark Soccer's list from 2014.

23:28.620 --> 23:33.160
This answer was eliminated in the elimination round, but shipping war on the new Mass Effect,

23:33.160 --> 23:37.640
which I think we joked when it was eliminated, that's always going to happen no matter what.

23:37.640 --> 23:39.320
That answer is too safe.

23:39.320 --> 23:44.160
Has there been shipping wars broken out over what little tidbits we've seen to the next

23:44.160 --> 23:45.960
Mass Effect, which is actually nothing.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.300
We've seen nothing of the new Mass Effect.

23:48.300 --> 23:54.400
But there are plenty of shipping wars in Dragon Age, wasn't there?

23:54.400 --> 23:57.080
So I got that half right.

23:57.080 --> 23:58.080
Wrong Bioware franchise.

23:58.080 --> 24:04.560
All right, and Dark Soccer's third answer from the 2014 list was World of Warcraft loses

24:04.560 --> 24:06.760
1 million subscribers.

24:06.760 --> 24:11.120
And we have an answer that panned out to be half true.

24:11.120 --> 24:13.840
Warcraft took a huge dive in subscriptions.

24:13.840 --> 24:15.800
It lost them, but they found them again.

24:15.800 --> 24:16.800
Exactly.

24:16.800 --> 24:19.960
As Pandaria wore on, Warcraft lost a huge amount of subscribers.

24:19.960 --> 24:21.080
I was well over a million.

24:21.080 --> 24:24.640
I want to say they lost more like 2 million across the year.

24:24.640 --> 24:28.600
But when the new expansion came out, they were quick to brag that they got them all

24:28.600 --> 24:30.520
back and they were back over 10 million.

24:30.520 --> 24:35.680
So once again, Dark Soccer's answer gets half credit.

24:36.680 --> 24:37.680
So there you go.

24:37.680 --> 24:38.680
Loki's list.

24:38.680 --> 24:41.400
Loki's list got decimated last year.

24:41.400 --> 24:42.960
He had an answer, get immunity.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.480
But let's take a look back.

24:44.480 --> 24:48.720
He had 3 DS games on the Wii U, which ended up getting eliminated because it was too close

24:48.720 --> 24:50.120
to one of Alan's answers.

24:50.120 --> 24:52.440
So he said 3 DS games on the Wii U.

24:52.440 --> 24:53.440
Didn't happen.

24:53.440 --> 24:54.680
I can't even get half credit for that.

24:54.680 --> 24:55.680
Didn't happen.

24:55.680 --> 24:57.160
Didn't they announce DS games on the Wii U?

24:57.160 --> 24:59.480
I don't think they ever did.

24:59.480 --> 25:04.600
Game Boy games came to the Wii U, but that had started in 2013.

25:04.600 --> 25:08.640
And I think we all saw that that was opening the door to DS games, but we have yet to see

25:08.640 --> 25:10.000
one on Virtual Console.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.360
So unfortunately that didn't end up being true.

25:12.360 --> 25:19.280
Now your answer that ended up getting immunity, Left 4 Dead 3 or Source 2 released.

25:19.280 --> 25:20.280
Also didn't happen.

25:20.280 --> 25:25.440
Yeah, why should I even count Valve on releasing something in a timely fashion?

25:25.440 --> 25:26.920
That was just dumb.

25:26.920 --> 25:32.360
And then also on your list, it said Wii U price cut and I believe you said Mario Kart

25:32.360 --> 25:36.000
8 will flop, leading to a Wii U price cut was what you said.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.120
I don't think I said it would flop, but I don't think...

25:38.120 --> 25:39.120
You did.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.120
I'll go back to the audio.

25:40.120 --> 25:41.120
I don't think I said it was...

25:41.120 --> 25:42.120
No.

25:42.120 --> 25:43.120
I don't think it would have flopped.

25:43.120 --> 25:44.600
I said I don't think it would do enough to...

25:44.600 --> 25:47.220
I don't think it would be enough to sell systems.

25:47.220 --> 25:48.480
And that wasn't necessarily true.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.640
It did sell systems because it's a great game.

25:50.640 --> 25:51.640
Yeah.

25:51.640 --> 25:54.120
And, uh, but no Wii U price cut, surprisingly.

25:54.120 --> 25:59.600
Yeah, that's because they're doing pretty good off of Smash and Super Mario, or Mario

25:59.600 --> 26:01.600
Kart 8.

26:01.640 --> 26:06.360
They've enhanced the value, they've put more in, I mean, like everybody gets a deluxe now

26:06.360 --> 26:09.240
for what you were paying the basic before.

26:09.240 --> 26:14.440
So they've kind of, you know, again, maybe I'd give you a quarter credit on this.

26:14.440 --> 26:15.440
Nah, I wouldn't.

26:15.440 --> 26:16.440
I wouldn't.

26:16.440 --> 26:18.360
They didn't actually cut the price because of, you know, doing bad.

26:18.360 --> 26:23.120
But still, I think what they've kind of done now is that they're, I mean, I don't know,

26:23.120 --> 26:28.560
they're kind of in like a balance right now.

26:28.560 --> 26:32.640
They're not getting any more third party support, but they're not necessarily losing more third

26:32.640 --> 26:33.640
party support.

26:33.640 --> 26:37.640
And the first party's kind of keeping everything afloat right now, but, I mean, as soon as

26:37.640 --> 26:40.360
those first party games aren't coming out, or it's not like...

26:40.360 --> 26:43.280
Because we had a pretty decent release schedule.

26:43.280 --> 26:48.080
We had, you know, Mario Kart 8 and then Smash Brothers, and that was pretty big, and the

26:48.080 --> 26:50.660
Zelda game was alright.

26:50.660 --> 26:55.960
But I'm worried that, you know, if Zelda doesn't come out next year or something like that,

26:55.960 --> 26:58.720
there's not going to be a whole ton to kind of keep it afloat.

26:58.720 --> 27:03.560
I think right now it's just, that's, what's going to happen is once those first party

27:03.560 --> 27:07.200
titles start drying up, or maybe it's not necessarily the releases that people might

27:07.200 --> 27:11.400
want, you know, if it's a Pikmin 4 or something like that, then you might start seeing it

27:11.400 --> 27:12.480
start to waver a bit.

27:12.480 --> 27:17.280
I think it's non-negotiable that a new Zelda will come out next year, and I think that

27:17.280 --> 27:22.280
is, that is orders from the top that Zelda will happen in 2015, it has to.

27:22.280 --> 27:24.400
I think there's intense pressure at Nintendo.

27:24.400 --> 27:28.400
I think other stuff will get delayed to pull those people to work on Zelda if they have

27:28.400 --> 27:29.400
to.

27:29.400 --> 27:33.160
I think Zelda is a must happen for Nintendo in 2015.

27:33.160 --> 27:34.960
And I think it'll be great.

27:34.960 --> 27:38.080
There's no reason to think it won't be amazing.

27:38.080 --> 27:39.840
Nintendo puts out quality shit, so.

27:39.840 --> 27:40.840
It looks fantastic.

27:40.840 --> 27:41.840
Good for them.

27:41.840 --> 27:47.000
Okay, going to Jason's list, now this is interesting because Jason had one of his answers eliminated,

27:47.000 --> 27:51.840
but funny enough, Jason probably was more accurate than any of the rest of us.

27:51.840 --> 27:53.020
Which means he needs to come back.

27:53.020 --> 27:55.840
He's on the road tonight, by the way, if you guys are wondering why he didn't do the intro,

27:55.840 --> 27:57.540
he's on the road tonight.

27:57.540 --> 28:03.820
Jason said, Indy hit get signed or AAA port.

28:03.820 --> 28:05.920
That's kind of, you know.

28:05.920 --> 28:11.700
But Minecraft getting bought by Microsoft, I mean, that's the epitome of that answer

28:11.700 --> 28:12.700
right there.

28:12.700 --> 28:13.700
I think.

28:13.700 --> 28:14.700
I would give Jason credit for that.

28:14.700 --> 28:19.500
I mean, yeah, it was a safe answer, but Microsoft buying Minecraft was huge last year.

28:19.500 --> 28:21.620
That was a big thing.

28:21.620 --> 28:25.620
His next answer was Oculus Rift will run at 4K.

28:25.620 --> 28:28.460
I don't know if this, I would have to ask, I would have to defer to the expert, Bobby

28:28.460 --> 28:29.460
Blackwolf.

28:29.460 --> 28:31.660
I'm not, Loki, are you in tune if this ended up happening?

28:31.660 --> 28:32.660
I don't think it did.

28:32.660 --> 28:37.140
Well, they don't have a final dev kit yet, and we don't know what this final specs are.

28:37.140 --> 28:41.680
I don't think it did, but certainly we've seen progress on the Rift.

28:41.680 --> 28:46.780
And then lastly, and this answer got eliminated by a very angry Alan, who is a fan boy, when

28:46.780 --> 28:49.780
Jason said there will be no release of Half-Life 3.

28:49.780 --> 28:52.340
You want to talk about a safe answer.

28:52.340 --> 28:54.180
That was definitely a safe answer that was on the board.

28:54.180 --> 28:55.180
All right.

28:55.180 --> 28:59.780
And Bobby Blackwolf confirming in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, no 4K, Gear

28:59.780 --> 29:01.740
VR is 1440p.

29:01.740 --> 29:02.900
Okay.

29:02.900 --> 29:07.820
So here was my list, and boy did I, oh my God, I didn't get a single one.

29:07.820 --> 29:09.340
But then again, I was being a little silly.

29:09.340 --> 29:10.780
So here was my list.

29:10.780 --> 29:15.100
F-Zero Boner Party was my number one answer.

29:15.100 --> 29:16.460
And I knew that wouldn't come true.

29:16.460 --> 29:19.660
That was more wishful thinking that there'll be the year of Captain Falcon.

29:19.660 --> 29:24.660
To be fair, I mean, you may have had a mini F-Zero Boner Party when you saw the DLC announcement

29:24.660 --> 29:25.660
for...

29:25.660 --> 29:26.660
Thank you.

29:26.660 --> 29:27.660
You know what?

29:27.660 --> 29:28.660
That's a good...

29:28.660 --> 29:29.660
Thank you.

29:29.660 --> 29:30.660
Thank you for that.

29:30.660 --> 29:31.660
That is a good point.

29:31.660 --> 29:32.660
Thank you.

29:32.660 --> 29:33.660
I think...

29:33.660 --> 29:34.660
And then you probably played it and you realized how crappy it was.

29:34.660 --> 29:38.420
And we got the Captain Falcon amiibo, which I'm seeing more pictures of that one on Twitter

29:38.420 --> 29:39.420
than any other.

29:39.420 --> 29:40.540
And it's all pictures of his ass.

29:40.540 --> 29:46.120
I can't possibly imagine what it is about Captain Falcon's ass that has everybody...

29:46.120 --> 29:49.500
Because he has one now.

29:49.500 --> 29:51.100
That ass.

29:51.100 --> 29:52.100
You're anaconda.

29:52.100 --> 29:53.100
Don't.

29:53.100 --> 29:54.100
You're anaconda.

29:54.100 --> 29:55.100
Okay.

29:55.100 --> 29:56.100
Anyway.

29:56.100 --> 30:00.460
And my next answer was Microsoft jacks the Oculus Rift.

30:00.460 --> 30:04.060
I think I kind of knew in the back of my mind that probably wasn't gonna happen.

30:04.060 --> 30:06.720
But Facebook ended up jacking the Oculus Rift.

30:06.720 --> 30:09.220
So oops on that.

30:09.220 --> 30:10.620
Who would have thought?

30:10.620 --> 30:14.160
And then my number three answer was so morbid.

30:14.160 --> 30:15.800
Not as morbid as Alan's list.

30:15.800 --> 30:22.200
But my number three answer was Ouya goes under, which I think I was in a fair position to

30:22.200 --> 30:23.200
say last year.

30:23.200 --> 30:24.200
They're made out of styrofoam, man.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.800
You can't sink that thing.

30:26.800 --> 30:27.800
You know what?

30:27.800 --> 30:32.960
There are still a lot of indies that really swear by Ouya, and Ouya's definitely out there

30:32.960 --> 30:33.960
to support indies.

30:33.960 --> 30:37.920
So I can't hate on what Ouya's doing at all, and I don't.

30:37.920 --> 30:42.400
But certainly I'm still kind of looking at it going, where's...

30:42.400 --> 30:45.200
How are they gonna turn that thing into profits next year?

30:45.200 --> 30:46.480
I don't know.

30:46.480 --> 30:49.320
But anyway, Ouya is still around.

30:49.320 --> 30:50.480
They did not go under.

30:50.480 --> 30:53.320
All right, Alan's list.

30:53.320 --> 30:56.040
Bethesda confirms Fallout 4.

30:56.040 --> 30:57.400
I was hoping that'd be true, but no.

30:57.400 --> 30:58.400
Yeah, me too.

30:58.400 --> 30:59.400
Me too.

30:59.400 --> 31:00.400
Maybe next year.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.400
Didn't end up happening.

31:01.400 --> 31:02.400
Didn't end up happening.

31:02.400 --> 31:05.480
Nintendo DS titles on the eShop, and they are poorly done.

31:05.480 --> 31:07.440
Also, no DS titles showed up.

31:07.440 --> 31:11.260
We had Game Boy Advance, but we did not get Nintendo DS titles.

31:11.260 --> 31:13.800
So Alan did not end up being correct on that.

31:13.800 --> 31:17.960
And then this answer got eliminated right off the bat, because it was a little morbid.

31:17.960 --> 31:23.920
You might remember last year, he said, a Nintendo godfather of gaming would pass away.

31:23.920 --> 31:24.920
So that didn't happen.

31:24.920 --> 31:25.920
We did have...

31:25.920 --> 31:32.760
Now we had Ralph Baer, who would be the godfather of all gaming, passed away.

31:32.760 --> 31:37.500
So Alan can maybe get half credit for that, because one could argue without Ralph Baer,

31:37.500 --> 31:39.040
you would not have Nintendo at all.

31:39.040 --> 31:43.560
So there you go, even though I guess Nintendo's business was playing cards.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.320
And Awada was kind of sick.

31:46.320 --> 31:47.600
I mean, thank god he made a recovery.

31:47.600 --> 31:48.600
Thank god he made a recovery.

31:48.600 --> 31:53.560
I don't want to be dark or morbid, but he did disappear for a little bit.

31:53.560 --> 31:54.560
Just saying.

31:54.560 --> 31:55.560
Just saying.

31:55.560 --> 31:56.560
Anyway.

31:56.560 --> 31:57.560
So there you go.

31:57.560 --> 32:01.480
So looking at our list of predictions on what came true, not a lot.

32:01.480 --> 32:05.520
So don't give me ideas for games, because that could happen.

32:05.520 --> 32:07.000
I could make that.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
What?

32:08.000 --> 32:09.640
I'm not done with my game yet.

32:09.640 --> 32:10.640
I have a racetrack and everything.

32:10.640 --> 32:11.640
Oh no, there's a chat in here.

32:12.200 --> 32:15.440
Raginator said, I wonder if any would make an F-Zero type game where you race boners

32:15.440 --> 32:17.320
for the vlog jam.

32:17.320 --> 32:18.840
And I said, boner racing?

32:18.840 --> 32:24.400
It'd be people with their flying dongs pulling the bodies along.

32:24.400 --> 32:25.400
How old are you guys?

32:25.400 --> 32:26.400
How old are you guys?

32:26.400 --> 32:29.280
We should call it Cosmic Thrust.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.280
You guys have issues.

32:30.280 --> 32:31.280
All right.

32:31.280 --> 32:32.280
I don't have issues.

32:32.280 --> 32:33.280
Subscriptions.

32:33.280 --> 32:36.720
We will get to our 2015 list a little later on in the show.

32:36.720 --> 32:40.400
We have to get to what little gaming news there is this week, though.

32:40.400 --> 32:45.200
But first, our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing this

32:45.200 --> 32:46.200
week.

32:46.200 --> 32:47.440
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

32:47.440 --> 32:48.840
Dragon Age.

32:48.840 --> 32:49.840
Lots more Dragon Age?

32:49.840 --> 32:50.840
More, more Dragon Age.

32:50.840 --> 32:53.000
Why haven't you beat it yet?

32:53.000 --> 32:54.840
Because I don't want my heart to be broken yet.

32:54.840 --> 32:55.840
I see.

32:55.840 --> 32:57.160
I'm Romancing Solas.

32:57.160 --> 33:00.000
So that should be enough for all the people who've seen all the spoilers.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
I see.

33:01.000 --> 33:04.960
I'm also doing, well, because I like sleep in the morning.

33:04.960 --> 33:07.800
So I play Dragon Age after work.

33:07.800 --> 33:11.480
And I've really just been running around exploring stuff.

33:11.480 --> 33:15.280
Just actually taking scene porn in and killing dragons.

33:15.280 --> 33:17.400
My thing now is killing dragons.

33:17.400 --> 33:19.440
But I'm in a game called Dragon Age.

33:19.440 --> 33:20.440
There are dragons?

33:20.440 --> 33:21.440
Yes.

33:21.440 --> 33:22.440
I'll be damned.

33:22.440 --> 33:23.440
You can kill them.

33:23.440 --> 33:24.440
They give you shit.

33:24.440 --> 33:29.640
But right now I'm only level 21 and the dragon I'm trying to kill is like a level 22 dragon.

33:29.640 --> 33:30.640
Is it that one in the Hinterlands?

33:30.640 --> 33:31.640
He's very annoying.

33:31.640 --> 33:32.640
There's three in the Hinterlands.

33:32.640 --> 33:33.640
Oh, shit.

33:33.640 --> 33:34.640
Not in the Hinterlands.

33:35.320 --> 33:36.320
That was easy.

33:36.320 --> 33:40.600
The three in Empress du Leon is where it is.

33:40.600 --> 33:41.840
There's three of them there.

33:41.840 --> 33:42.840
One of them I could kill.

33:42.840 --> 33:44.080
It was a hard fight, but I could kill.

33:44.080 --> 33:47.400
The other two I'm nowhere near yet.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.240
But I've killed almost all the other easy dragons.

33:49.240 --> 33:51.600
I'm going to go after a couple more.

33:51.600 --> 33:57.480
And I'm just basically kind of doing a really slow, enjoying myself completionist kind of

33:57.480 --> 33:58.480
run.

33:58.480 --> 34:00.600
So I like that I can take my time with it.

34:00.600 --> 34:02.400
I've just been enjoying myself.

34:02.400 --> 34:03.400
Alan's been doing something similar.

34:03.480 --> 34:08.040
I noticed he's been playing Dragon Age with all the hubble around Dragon Age Inquisition.

34:08.040 --> 34:10.640
He decided, you know what, I'm going to start from the very beginning.

34:10.640 --> 34:13.280
So he played all the way through Dragon Age again.

34:13.280 --> 34:16.560
The original Dragon Age Origins and the DLC.

34:16.560 --> 34:18.360
Now he's making his way through Dragon Age 2.

34:18.360 --> 34:22.180
And I think he's at the end of Act 2 right now, he said was the last point I checked

34:22.180 --> 34:23.180
with him.

34:23.180 --> 34:24.180
He was there.

34:24.180 --> 34:25.180
And then he will start Inquisition.

34:25.180 --> 34:26.520
So he's like having a whole month of it.

34:26.520 --> 34:31.720
I found one mission that I wish I had done differently because I like the best ending

34:31.720 --> 34:34.840
of it better than the one I got.

34:34.840 --> 34:39.120
So I'm going to definitely be doing a second playthrough, but I figured my next playthrough

34:39.120 --> 34:43.440
I'm not going to go after Solas because, I mean, I'm going to cry a lot.

34:43.440 --> 34:45.100
I know it's going to happen.

34:45.100 --> 34:51.520
So I'm probably going to romance Cullen next because he's fluffy.

34:51.520 --> 34:56.840
But I also played some Final Fantasy 14, because I'm trying to remember I'm paying for this.

34:56.840 --> 35:02.120
So I played a little bit, I'm just, I really, really, really, really, really, really, really

35:02.120 --> 35:04.120
hate What Does Fuck.

35:04.120 --> 35:08.440
Great, now I can't remember the douchebag's name.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.440
In 14?

35:09.440 --> 35:10.440
In 14.

35:10.440 --> 35:11.440
Um.

35:11.440 --> 35:12.440
Who's the guy who annoys me so much?

35:12.440 --> 35:13.440
Oh, Hildebrand.

35:13.440 --> 35:14.440
Yeah.

35:14.440 --> 35:15.440
Him.

35:15.440 --> 35:16.440
He's like comic relief though.

35:16.440 --> 35:17.440
He's not funny.

35:17.440 --> 35:19.580
He is the antithesis of funny.

35:19.580 --> 35:23.220
I don't find stupid funny.

35:23.220 --> 35:26.740
So you must not watch a lot of Adam Sandler films.

35:26.740 --> 35:28.500
Not really, actually.

35:28.500 --> 35:31.760
And I hated, well, you know, I also hated Seinfeld, so.

35:31.760 --> 35:35.440
But I mean, there's a few things that made me laugh, but I've actually been kind of giggling

35:35.440 --> 35:38.700
over Ultros.

35:38.700 --> 35:39.700
And then.

35:39.700 --> 35:42.780
They do a really good job incorporating like the Final Fantasy 6.

35:42.780 --> 35:46.660
There's like some direct quotes lifted out of 6 that Ultros reuses in 14.

35:46.660 --> 35:47.660
It's great.

35:47.660 --> 35:50.420
It's a great love letter to 6.

35:50.420 --> 35:54.240
But I also, I've got all of my new gifted games downloading.

35:54.240 --> 35:56.960
They were downloading while I was leaving.

35:56.960 --> 36:03.040
And I actually, I did some Borderlands 2 on my pretty shiny MacBook Pro.

36:03.040 --> 36:04.680
And more Fractal.

36:04.680 --> 36:05.800
Because I love Fractal.

36:05.800 --> 36:08.760
It's probably my favorite puzzle game to come out this decade.

36:08.760 --> 36:09.760
Alright.

36:09.760 --> 36:12.840
Loki, how was your gaming week?

36:12.840 --> 36:18.680
Really all I did was I played just like a Marvel Super Heroes.

36:18.680 --> 36:23.440
And I didn't really get anywhere other than buying some DLC that really was overpriced.

36:23.440 --> 36:27.280
But now I have a bunch of characters I don't really give a shit about.

36:27.280 --> 36:29.440
Like all the tertiary characters from Thor.

36:29.440 --> 36:30.440
Whatever.

36:30.440 --> 36:33.260
I don't even know who these guys are.

36:33.260 --> 36:37.840
Some of them I swear were from The Hobbit, but okay.

36:37.840 --> 36:38.840
What else?

36:38.840 --> 36:40.280
That was pretty much it.

36:40.280 --> 36:42.800
Just working on my VoG Jam title.

36:42.800 --> 36:47.160
We do want to use this opportunity to remind people the VoG Jam is going on right now.

36:47.160 --> 36:48.160
Create a game.

36:48.160 --> 36:49.160
Make something, dammit.

36:49.160 --> 36:50.880
The theme is a buggy game.

36:50.880 --> 36:53.680
And the entries are due the next show.

36:53.680 --> 36:56.480
Five o'clock Pacific, eight o'clock Eastern on Sunday the 11th.

36:56.480 --> 37:01.800
So Loki's starting to realize he may have picked too big of a scope for a game to finish

37:01.800 --> 37:02.800
in three weeks.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.960
It's just taking a lot of time.

37:04.960 --> 37:07.600
It's not that I had enough time.

37:07.600 --> 37:12.760
It's just with the kids and everything it's hard to get time to work on stuff.

37:12.760 --> 37:17.300
And I've stayed up late every night trying to do it.

37:17.300 --> 37:21.500
And now that I have this bug in Unity that's making things look really ugly, it's kind

37:21.500 --> 37:24.380
of pissing me off because it puts me even more behind.

37:24.380 --> 37:25.380
You'll get there.

37:25.380 --> 37:26.380
Ask for help.

37:26.380 --> 37:27.380
Maybe somebody can help you.

37:27.380 --> 37:28.380
Crack the code.

37:28.380 --> 37:29.380
It's awesome.

37:29.380 --> 37:32.420
Those guys we had on from Cooking with Unity a couple weeks ago, one of them is participating.

37:32.420 --> 37:33.540
How amazing is that?

37:33.540 --> 37:36.900
So I've seen some of the work you guys are doing on the VoG forums.

37:36.900 --> 37:37.900
It's awesome.

37:37.900 --> 37:39.300
I'm really hoping I can get something done.

37:39.300 --> 37:42.460
I had a little setback because something with my day job came up.

37:42.460 --> 37:48.540
So I have to work on that instead of a game when I have some free time.

37:48.540 --> 37:52.500
So I really encourage people to make things for that and we will be talking about what

37:52.500 --> 37:54.660
got submitted next week on the show.

37:54.660 --> 38:00.300
Remember, your submissions should come to Jam at VoGnetwork.com.

38:00.300 --> 38:03.620
More information is available at VoGnetwork.com in our forums.

38:03.620 --> 38:07.860
Bobby's compiled a special forum for the Jam and there's a whole post there detailing all

38:07.860 --> 38:08.860
the information.

38:08.860 --> 38:09.860
So check that out.

38:09.860 --> 38:12.100
Meanwhile, my gaming week.

38:12.100 --> 38:17.420
So yes, I did play other games because I was sick over New Year's.

38:17.420 --> 38:20.620
So I was going to buy something to make myself feel better.

38:20.620 --> 38:24.340
And I decided to buy something on the Wii U that I've seen a lot of people talking really

38:24.340 --> 38:26.020
fondly about on Twitter and stuff.

38:26.020 --> 38:27.020
So I said, you know what?

38:27.020 --> 38:28.020
I'm going to buy Captain Toad.

38:28.020 --> 38:30.100
There's a lot of people who have been talking very highly of this game so I'm going to check

38:30.100 --> 38:32.100
out this game and see what it's all about.

38:32.100 --> 38:38.740
So I played a little bit of Captain Toad and it's those little levels from Mario 3D World.

38:38.780 --> 38:45.220
You had these special puzzle levels that starred Toad or Captain Toad but he couldn't jump

38:45.220 --> 38:47.180
and he was restricted a little bit.

38:47.180 --> 38:52.820
And some of it was more about spatialness because you would be able to rotate the screen

38:52.820 --> 38:58.900
around and have to figure out what corridor leads to that gem or how do I get to the star

38:58.900 --> 39:01.460
from there to do that without jumping.

39:01.460 --> 39:10.940
And so Captain Toad is kind of a game made up of that whole spatialness and puzzleness.

39:10.940 --> 39:17.620
I got to admit, I'm not loving it like a lot of people seem to that I know on Twitter and

39:17.620 --> 39:18.980
so forth.

39:18.980 --> 39:20.900
But it's cute.

39:20.900 --> 39:25.780
And I think if you realize what type of game you're going to get, I think it's worth looking

39:25.780 --> 39:26.780
at.

39:26.780 --> 39:30.420
Now I will say the game did earn a lot of points with me when I got to this one level

39:30.420 --> 39:33.140
that it was starting to do something really different.

39:33.140 --> 39:36.460
And granted, I haven't beat the game yet, I haven't had enough time.

39:36.460 --> 39:39.620
But if the game is going to do more of that with some of the stages later on, then I can

39:39.620 --> 39:45.380
see where, okay, this is the mine car level is the first time you get in a level that

39:45.380 --> 39:47.220
does something different.

39:47.220 --> 39:53.140
And it's really cool because on the game pad, you see a Pokemon Snap style thing where you're

39:53.140 --> 39:57.940
looking around and you can throw the vegetables at different obstacles that are in the way

39:57.940 --> 39:58.940
and so forth.

39:58.940 --> 40:04.180
But then on the game screen, you just see the static, you know, what you would expect

40:04.180 --> 40:10.060
of Toad in the cart going around, you know, more like a static picture, like if the level

40:10.060 --> 40:11.060
was not interactive.

40:11.060 --> 40:16.540
So I like that kind of, you know, how it worked between the game pad and the television because,

40:16.540 --> 40:20.100
you know, despite the fact that this whole game pad thing is really Nintendo's baby and

40:20.100 --> 40:24.080
their idea, a lot of games aren't using it extensively.

40:24.080 --> 40:28.260
So it was nice to see that kind of taken advantage of in that Captain Toad level.

40:28.260 --> 40:35.540
And I also really liked that because it detected data from Mario 3D Land, you're able to play

40:35.540 --> 40:41.180
some stages from Mario 3D Land as Captain Toad, which is trickier than it sounds because

40:41.180 --> 40:45.660
remember Captain Toad can't jump and he moves very slow.

40:45.660 --> 40:49.780
But it's kind of neat to have to re-approach the levels from that perspective.

40:49.780 --> 40:54.440
So I kind of thought it was a neat little twist to kind of combine the two things there.

40:54.440 --> 41:02.000
But I still think $40 might be a little high for this, which I think was a lot of people's

41:02.000 --> 41:04.940
reservation about this game.

41:04.940 --> 41:11.440
But for what it is, it's still a Nintendo product and you know it has a lot of polish

41:11.440 --> 41:13.960
and a lot of the levels are very vibrant.

41:13.960 --> 41:15.740
The levels are very diverse.

41:15.740 --> 41:18.500
That's a nice thing about it too, is that it's not like you're just playing the same

41:18.500 --> 41:21.080
like planes level over and over.

41:21.080 --> 41:25.560
Like even within the first four stages, you're in these completely different landscapes.

41:25.560 --> 41:29.400
So in that regard, it's kind of neat and there are some different stuff that happens with

41:29.400 --> 41:31.600
the challenges and the double cherries and things like that.

41:31.600 --> 41:37.480
But I don't know, I guess I didn't fall in love with it the way I have other Wii U titles

41:37.480 --> 41:38.480
this year.

41:38.480 --> 41:39.960
Maybe I'm just not far enough into it.

41:39.960 --> 41:41.240
I don't know.

41:41.240 --> 41:45.520
But one thing, and this will be the last thing I'll say about Captain Toad, one thing I did

41:45.520 --> 41:49.600
kind of feel like the game lacks compared to other very strong Nintendo titles for the

41:49.600 --> 41:51.860
year is co-op.

41:51.860 --> 41:55.320
There's really not a lot of reason to sit here and play this game with somebody else

41:55.320 --> 41:56.320
in the same room.

41:56.320 --> 42:00.700
There's nothing around that, unless it's something you unlock later, but you know, if it's behind

42:00.700 --> 42:04.300
a lock and key, then I still consider it kind of not there, is that there's really not a

42:04.300 --> 42:07.200
lot for more than one person to get involved with.

42:07.200 --> 42:11.120
And when that's really Nintendo's strong point is creating these really strong multiplayer

42:11.120 --> 42:15.840
fun games, like look at Mario Kart 8, look at the original Mario 3D World, look at, you

42:15.840 --> 42:20.640
know, Super Smash Brothers Wii U, heck even Bayonetta 2 has an online mode.

42:20.640 --> 42:26.080
You know, when you look at that being really Nintendo's strength, it is kind of a drawback

42:26.080 --> 42:31.600
that Captain Toad is missing what is kind of Nintendo's forte in that regard.

42:31.600 --> 42:37.760
So it's not bad, it's just not, I'm not really getting that same intense love for it I was

42:37.760 --> 42:40.600
seeing a lot of on Twitter and so forth.

42:40.600 --> 42:46.920
Going to the chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, DarkTetsuya says, the minecart level was great,

42:46.920 --> 42:50.960
my brother was playing it and I was helping point out stuff to hit lol, it reminded me

42:50.960 --> 42:54.160
of one of Miyamoto's tech demos back at E3 last year.

42:54.160 --> 42:58.040
And maybe that's, you know, how it got incorporated.

42:58.040 --> 43:03.440
Let's see, those are some of the comments from our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com.

43:03.440 --> 43:11.040
Also, and you'll get a kick out of this, because this was released on Virtual Console, Pokemon

43:11.040 --> 43:15.840
Pinball came out on Virtual Console and I loved that game on Game Boy Advance, the Ruby

43:15.840 --> 43:20.960
Sapphire Pokemon Pinball games, so I had to buy that and I was playing that on Virtual

43:20.960 --> 43:25.380
Console and that's the first, excuse me, that's the first Game Boy Advance game I've played

43:25.380 --> 43:28.520
on Virtual Console and it translates very well.

43:28.520 --> 43:32.520
It's a surprising amount of fun to play on Wii U, it's like playing like a Super Nintendo

43:32.600 --> 43:34.360
game on the TV or something.

43:34.360 --> 43:39.920
So yeah, I like Pokemon Pinball, so that made me happy that that's out.

43:39.920 --> 43:44.400
Otherwise a lot of the same old stuff that I've been playing, more Final Fantasy XIV,

43:44.400 --> 43:50.600
more Diablo III seasonal before the season ends on February 2nd, I think they're saying,

43:50.600 --> 43:51.600
and so on.

43:51.600 --> 43:55.260
All right, let's get into some housekeeping real quick.

43:55.260 --> 44:00.860
We will not be here the week after next, that is Martin Luther King weekend, which would

44:00.860 --> 44:08.500
be January the 18th, we will not be here that weekend, because I will be in Seattle

44:08.500 --> 44:11.820
with Alan, we're doing a late celebration for our anniversary and the holidays and all

44:11.820 --> 44:12.820
that.

44:12.820 --> 44:15.860
Because I'm going to be gone for such a big chunk of the weekend, we're actually not really

44:15.860 --> 44:19.340
going to be able to tape in advance either, so we are just not going to be here that week.

44:19.340 --> 44:23.260
Sorry guys, taking a little break, but you can use the opportunity to catch up on the

44:23.260 --> 44:29.860
backlog of OLR episodes or donate your time to another fantastic independent podcast,

44:29.860 --> 44:33.740
there's so many great ones out there, I'd encourage you to look up.

44:33.740 --> 44:39.000
Of course I'm going to point to those on our family at vognetwork.com, but no matter where

44:39.000 --> 44:43.940
you pull your podcast from, do support other independent broadcasters, there's a lot of

44:43.940 --> 44:45.260
hardworking people out there.

44:45.260 --> 44:48.540
So that's in two weeks, there will be no live show and there will actually not be a podcast

44:48.540 --> 44:52.420
that week either, we will finally be taking our holiday break a little late.

44:52.420 --> 44:56.820
All right, let's go around and get into some news tonight.

44:56.820 --> 45:01.980
What little there is this week, with it being the new year and a lot of companies still

45:01.980 --> 45:06.420
off and people are working and there's not a lot of inertia coming off the Christmas

45:06.420 --> 45:09.820
week, it's slow out there this week, but we have a little bit.

45:09.820 --> 45:12.340
It's not coming out either, I mean it's just slow.

45:12.340 --> 45:13.980
It's just how it is this time of year.

45:13.980 --> 45:14.980
It's time to catch up.

45:14.980 --> 45:19.060
That's right, this is the catch up time of year, absolutely.

45:19.060 --> 45:24.180
And unfortunately one of the things you weren't able to catch up on was being able to be online

45:24.180 --> 45:29.860
on PlayStation Network during this holiday season, because it was being DDOS and that

45:29.860 --> 45:31.140
fun stuff.

45:31.140 --> 45:36.860
Well, there is at least a little bit of an upside there, going to be compensating you

45:36.860 --> 45:38.420
for the time that it was down.

45:38.420 --> 45:44.940
So Sony is offering five extra days of PlayStation Plus, as well as a one time use 10% code for

45:44.940 --> 45:46.980
the PlayStation Store.

45:46.980 --> 45:51.300
And basically saying they wanted to show their appreciation for the user's patience after

45:51.300 --> 45:54.220
the outage last month.

45:54.220 --> 46:01.620
And I guess the 10% off is one time discount off of a total cart purchase in the PlayStation

46:01.620 --> 46:02.620
Store.

46:02.620 --> 46:07.940
So, God I hope that wasn't used when I bought that $1.99 DLC the other day.

46:07.940 --> 46:10.060
No, I think it's coming soon.

46:10.060 --> 46:14.060
I think you have to physically put that in your cart in order, I think you'll know when

46:14.060 --> 46:15.060
you're spending it.

46:15.060 --> 46:16.060
Okay, I guess.

46:16.060 --> 46:17.060
That would have sucked.

46:17.060 --> 46:19.060
Saved 19 cents.

46:19.060 --> 46:20.060
Thanks.

46:20.060 --> 46:22.060
What do you think about that?

46:22.060 --> 46:26.660
Do you think that's a fair compromise for PlayStation being inaccessible over the Christmas

46:26.660 --> 46:27.660
holiday?

46:27.660 --> 46:29.260
I think that's fine.

46:29.260 --> 46:32.260
I mean, they didn't even really have to do this kind of thing, just give us the extra

46:32.260 --> 46:33.260
days.

46:33.260 --> 46:36.300
Okay, you weren't able to get on, so we're going to send it out this many days.

46:36.300 --> 46:39.580
I don't see that as being that difficult.

46:39.580 --> 46:43.500
I know I was kind of the one last week that gave this a little bit of a hard time, and

46:43.500 --> 46:47.420
I didn't want to sound like one of those whiners or gimme gimme, but the fact of the matter

46:47.420 --> 46:52.500
was PlayStation was down for four days, and whether that was because of an outside attack

46:52.500 --> 46:58.540
or not, we still are paying for that time, so I said, all I want is for Sony to come

46:58.540 --> 47:02.100
out and say, hey, something happened, we're going to give you those days back.

47:02.100 --> 47:04.540
And that's what they did, so I'm happy.

47:04.540 --> 47:07.340
They came back and gave even an extra day, they gave five days.

47:07.340 --> 47:13.500
Aren't you glad that the console of your console gaming choice doesn't disable you from playing

47:13.500 --> 47:18.860
games when you can't connect online like one console might have?

47:18.860 --> 47:26.100
Well, actually, if you are building up a library through PlayStation Plus, if you happen to

47:26.100 --> 47:30.300
be past your expiration day, which Christmas probably was expiration day on PlayStation

47:30.300 --> 47:34.420
Plus for a lot of people, if you're past that and it can't re-authenticate your PlayStation

47:34.420 --> 47:37.160
Plus license, you can't play those games.

47:37.160 --> 47:41.020
And Bobby was telling a story on his show tonight, he was trying to play Pinball Arcade,

47:41.020 --> 47:45.620
and the way that Farsight Studios set it up to authenticate the table licenses, because

47:45.620 --> 47:47.720
PlayStation Network was down, he couldn't play that.

47:47.720 --> 47:52.940
So even though Sony came out and made this big deal about, oh, you don't have to be online

47:52.940 --> 47:58.500
to authenticate, because of the way some games are developed, you do.

47:58.500 --> 48:03.900
And some of the biggest, I mean, one might argue that the biggest title on PlayStation

48:03.900 --> 48:08.180
4 this holiday season was Destiny, and that's online only.

48:08.180 --> 48:13.540
So I mean, I don't know, yes and no with that.

48:13.540 --> 48:18.740
But anyway, I don't want to sound like too much, I hate to be that cynical negative gamer.

48:18.740 --> 48:25.300
I mean, things aren't perfect sometimes, but at the end of the day, last week, this is

48:25.300 --> 48:29.420
all I said I wanted, and I think the compensation they're doing is fine.

48:29.420 --> 48:34.700
Maybe, I mean, if I really wanted to nickel and dime things, which I'm not, but I just

48:34.700 --> 48:41.580
want to say, maybe seven days, so that way everybody guaranteed gets a weekend, which

48:41.580 --> 48:46.680
makes up for, oh, this is a time of year when we're away on a holiday break or whatever,

48:46.680 --> 48:51.380
if everybody had that weekend, but five days is enough where you're going to probably get

48:51.380 --> 48:54.100
at least one day out of the weekend.

48:54.100 --> 48:57.340
So I'm not going to sit here and be like, oh, it's not good enough.

48:57.340 --> 48:58.340
It's fine.

48:58.340 --> 49:02.780
I'm happy, I'm not going to cancel PS Plus, I'm still very supportive of Sony and everything

49:02.780 --> 49:03.780
they're doing.

49:03.860 --> 49:10.580
I think this is fine, and the 10% off coupon is nice, but at the same time, it's kind of

49:10.580 --> 49:15.060
like, well, it's not like Sony doesn't stand a profit off of that.

49:15.060 --> 49:19.620
I mean, because if somebody is going to spend money on the PlayStation Store just to utilize

49:19.620 --> 49:24.260
this 10% off coupon that they've got, then they've still spent money on the PlayStation

49:24.260 --> 49:26.500
Store they might not have otherwise.

49:26.500 --> 49:30.840
So I sort of see that as a non-issue.

49:30.840 --> 49:32.880
That's a nice thing.

49:32.880 --> 49:38.840
And for those that buy stuff online anyway and might have a $50 game they were planning

49:38.840 --> 49:43.440
to buy digitally anyway, this is a really nice little reward for that.

49:43.440 --> 49:47.080
But I also see it just like any other coupon you might get in the mail.

49:47.080 --> 49:52.120
It's incentive for you to go and utilize the store and get something you might not have

49:52.120 --> 49:56.840
otherwise because, ooh, I got to get a bargain type of thing.

49:56.840 --> 50:00.960
But I mean, I realize there's a lot of people out there who buy a lot of games digitally.

50:00.960 --> 50:06.680
And so if you're going to stock up on stuff, if you bought two games online digitally in

50:06.680 --> 50:11.400
January and used this 10% off coupon, you could save like 10 bucks, which is nothing

50:11.400 --> 50:12.400
to scoff at.

50:12.400 --> 50:14.720
So this is going to be nice for some people.

50:14.720 --> 50:17.800
So there you go.

50:17.800 --> 50:21.800
Darsakra, I don't know if you have a comment on if you think this is sufficient enough

50:21.800 --> 50:24.520
compensation for the downtime.

50:24.520 --> 50:26.920
What do you think hearing this, what PlayStation is doing with this?

50:26.920 --> 50:30.040
Well, someone in corporate had to think it was sufficient.

50:30.040 --> 50:32.760
So there's always going to be people who are going to bitch.

50:32.760 --> 50:33.760
Yeah.

50:33.760 --> 50:38.320
Oh, we're not going to get this free thing or we don't think we have enough.

50:38.320 --> 50:39.320
Yeah.

50:39.320 --> 50:40.320
Too bad.

50:40.320 --> 50:41.320
Yeah.

50:41.320 --> 50:46.940
And I don't buy the whole, we should get free games out of it because I kind of think PlayStation

50:46.940 --> 50:52.400
Plus is really the leader in giving the free games as it is.

50:52.400 --> 50:54.000
They're way ahead of the competition.

50:54.000 --> 50:58.600
I realize Microsoft's giving away free games too, but let's be real, the bar of the stuff

50:58.600 --> 51:02.240
they've been giving away hasn't quite caught up to PlayStation yet.

51:02.240 --> 51:07.000
It's getting closer, but they were giving away years old games.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.960
And I think a lot of it had to do with that authentication stuff we were talking about

51:09.960 --> 51:10.960
when it first started.

51:10.960 --> 51:16.040
On 360, they couldn't, once you got it, you would have it forever, unlike PlayStation

51:16.040 --> 51:19.520
Plus, where if you lose PlayStation Plus, you lose the game.

51:19.520 --> 51:23.200
And Microsoft didn't have that for a long time, which was affecting the quality of the

51:23.200 --> 51:25.160
games they were giving away, I think.

51:25.160 --> 51:26.800
But now they fixed that, right?

51:26.800 --> 51:32.080
So now that's why the quality on Microsoft's gone up a little bit.

51:32.080 --> 51:34.440
And Rama says, free games, my ass.

51:34.440 --> 51:35.440
That's true.

51:35.440 --> 51:40.840
They're not really free because you are paying that fee for them, but I mean, it was a lot

51:40.840 --> 51:41.840
of games.

51:41.840 --> 51:48.080
I mean, at the end of the day, consumer is free to make their own choice, but as a gamer,

51:48.080 --> 51:52.660
one who uses consoles quite a bit, I found quite a bit of value in the PlayStation Plus

51:52.660 --> 51:53.660
games that came out.

51:53.660 --> 51:58.420
So it's just a bummer when the network's down and can't authenticate those games.

51:58.420 --> 52:05.500
So, all right, moving on to the next story, which has to do with people that get free

52:05.500 --> 52:11.060
games through their own dark methods, which is the Talos Principle.

52:11.060 --> 52:14.940
The Talos Principle, it was revealed this week that if you are one of the people that

52:14.940 --> 52:19.540
illegally downloaded this game, which Bobby last week on the show said was his favorite

52:19.540 --> 52:25.120
game of the year, 2014, if you illegally downloaded or pirated the Talos Principle,

52:25.120 --> 52:29.460
there's going to be an elevator in the game that will trap you in it, and there will be

52:29.460 --> 52:33.180
no way to progress past the elevator.

52:33.180 --> 52:38.320
And of course, this was discovered when somebody went to the forum to complain, help, I'm trapped

52:38.320 --> 52:39.320
in the elevator.

52:39.320 --> 52:43.080
I think they posted a screen cap and said, elevator doesn't work.

52:43.080 --> 52:47.460
And the first response in the thread said, congratulations, you must be the first one

52:47.460 --> 52:52.160
to show to the internet world what Croteam did this time to punish pirates.

52:52.160 --> 52:53.420
You should be proud of yourself.

52:53.420 --> 52:57.140
It'll be all over the internet in about 30 minutes, I'd say.

52:57.140 --> 53:00.860
And sure enough, I think this guy's response ended up being something like, at least I'll

53:00.860 --> 53:03.980
be famous for something, or something a little silly like that.

53:03.980 --> 53:08.600
But yeah, so if you pirated the Talos Principle, you're not going to be able to get past this

53:08.600 --> 53:13.380
particular elevator level that is until the pirates figure out their way around it.

53:13.380 --> 53:20.020
But this is just another entry, and kind of a long-running list of how games are getting

53:20.020 --> 53:23.420
back at pirates, or taking little jabs at them.

53:23.420 --> 53:29.040
Like there was that game dev tycoon game a year or two ago, where it was about making

53:29.040 --> 53:35.140
a game, and in a huge bit of irony, if you pirated that game, then piracy would ultimately

53:35.140 --> 53:39.340
destroy the game that you made, and you would not be able to beat the game, period.

53:39.340 --> 53:42.480
And then of course a lot of people know those stories about like Earthbound on the Super

53:42.520 --> 53:47.140
Nintendo, yes even cartridges had anti-piracy measures in them, the enemies would be super

53:47.140 --> 53:49.920
hard, and then what was it, you'd get to the very last boss in the game and it would delete

53:49.920 --> 53:53.760
your save, something like that was what Earthbound would do.

53:53.760 --> 53:58.320
And then there's other examples of this as well, you see this happening in a lot of games.

53:58.320 --> 54:02.800
But I think a lot of us kinda, I don't know about you guys, but I get a kick out of seeing

54:02.800 --> 54:07.840
the game companies take a little jab at piracy like this, because you know, they gotta sell

54:07.840 --> 54:11.680
the games to be able to afford to pay the people to make them.

54:11.680 --> 54:16.800
So, you know, however you want to justify piracy in your own mind, if you're the type

54:16.800 --> 54:20.200
of person that copies games and doesn't pay for them or whatever.

54:20.200 --> 54:24.440
I bet you're the same person that steals candy from babies!

54:24.440 --> 54:26.440
Pirates.

54:26.440 --> 54:29.800
But the reality is, if they can't pay their employees to make the game, then there's not

54:29.800 --> 54:30.800
going to be a game.

54:30.800 --> 54:33.320
That's, you know, just what it is.

54:33.320 --> 54:37.920
So I always find these little tongue-in-cheek ways of getting back at the pirates kind of

54:37.920 --> 54:38.920
funny.

54:38.920 --> 54:43.760
And then at least it ends up being a demo for the game, and if people decide they like

54:43.760 --> 54:47.040
the game enough, maybe they'll put down the money to buy it.

54:47.040 --> 54:49.040
Nope, they'll just patch it.

54:49.040 --> 54:52.640
Yeah, unfortunately that probably is what'll happen.

54:52.640 --> 54:53.640
Alright.

54:53.640 --> 54:54.640
Nope.

54:54.640 --> 54:56.980
Well, I thought it was a clever little thing anyway.

54:56.980 --> 54:58.400
That is clever.

54:58.400 --> 55:02.720
That's a game in my backlog that I definitely want to get to as the Talos Principle, for

55:02.720 --> 55:03.720
sure.

55:03.720 --> 55:05.900
So, DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

55:05.900 --> 55:07.880
We never get to our backlog, what are you talking about?

55:07.880 --> 55:08.880
I know, right?

55:08.880 --> 55:13.240
Well, there is a little bit of news out of Steamland, and it actually has to do with

55:13.240 --> 55:16.160
two Sega games that are in the same franchise.

55:16.160 --> 55:23.160
Aliens, Colonial Marines, and Aliens vs. Predator are gone through Steam.

55:23.160 --> 55:24.160
Gone!

55:24.160 --> 55:28.600
The chances are that this probably has to do with the licenses expiring, so they need

55:28.600 --> 55:32.520
to renew the licenses before they'll be back for purchase.

55:32.520 --> 55:35.080
But yeah, they are right now gone.

55:35.080 --> 55:38.680
I mean, didn't we have the same thing with Crysis before?

55:38.680 --> 55:45.400
Well, actually, licensed games, a lot of them have disappeared in digital distribution channels

55:45.400 --> 55:46.920
the end of this year.

55:46.920 --> 55:50.000
Scott Pilgrim, the game on console is no longer there.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.000
Uno on Xbox.

55:51.000 --> 55:55.260
Well, you can still get the digital versions on some online sites, like I think Green Man

55:55.260 --> 56:00.320
Gaming still offers them, and you can activate them on Steam, or you can buy the physical

56:00.320 --> 56:01.320
versions.

56:01.320 --> 56:02.320
Yeah.

56:02.320 --> 56:05.640
I mean, Alien Isolation was supposed to be pretty darn good.

56:05.640 --> 56:08.560
Yeah, I'm hearing good things about that, but who's gonna really buy Alien and Colonial

56:08.560 --> 56:09.560
Marines?

56:09.560 --> 56:10.560
Who's gonna be buying that?

56:10.560 --> 56:14.560
I wanted to like that game just because it has Hendrickson in it.

56:14.560 --> 56:22.440
And I'll just listen to him and go, Bishop, or, you know, what was his face in Mass Effect?

56:22.440 --> 56:23.440
I'm here.

56:23.440 --> 56:24.440
Hackett.

56:24.440 --> 56:25.440
Yeah, Hackett.

56:25.440 --> 56:26.440
Commander Hackett.

56:26.440 --> 56:27.440
Admiral.

56:27.440 --> 56:28.440
Admiral, sorry.

56:28.560 --> 56:32.720
I will say, hands down, that Alien Isolation was the scariest game of the year last year

56:32.720 --> 56:34.240
and it's worth checking out.

56:34.240 --> 56:37.040
Scarier than Five Nights at Freddy's?

56:37.040 --> 56:38.480
Scarier than Five Nights at Freddy's?

56:38.480 --> 56:39.880
Scarier than P.T.?

56:39.880 --> 56:41.940
Scarier than Slender Man?

56:41.940 --> 56:42.940
Like scarier than all of that?

56:42.940 --> 56:47.960
Well, you know the first Alien, for the movies that is, was supposed to be a space horror

56:47.960 --> 56:48.960
movie.

56:48.960 --> 56:49.960
Right.

56:49.960 --> 56:55.780
And then, Aliens was more done as an action sci-fi, you know, which honestly, Aliens is

56:55.780 --> 57:00.500
probably one of the best movies of our generation.

57:00.500 --> 57:01.500
Right.

57:01.500 --> 57:06.160
Which is why they still make video games out of it, even though maybe the third and fourth

57:06.160 --> 57:10.580
movie weren't as, you know, legendary as that second movie.

57:10.580 --> 57:15.460
The fact that that movie is so fucking good is why they keep making games out of it.

57:15.460 --> 57:17.380
I will sit and just watch the extended cut.

57:17.380 --> 57:21.900
And I really wanted to watch Resurrection, just to hear the Joss dialogue, but apparently

57:21.900 --> 57:25.740
they just ruined the whole story that he had written.

57:25.740 --> 57:30.940
But I like that there are games that are going back to the feel of the first movie,

57:30.940 --> 57:34.080
having it be kind of a survival horror sort of thing.

57:34.080 --> 57:37.980
And that's why I wanted to play Isolation, but I had too many games and never bought

57:37.980 --> 57:38.980
it.

57:38.980 --> 57:43.660
You know, it's funny, I saw that Alien Resurrection in theaters years and years ago, and you know

57:43.660 --> 57:46.320
I don't get out to movies an awful lot, but that was, I think that movie came out when

57:46.320 --> 57:49.500
I was in college when I went to the movies a little more, and I went and saw that one.

57:49.500 --> 57:52.580
I don't remember hating it, like I thought it was kind of like, okay, it's just a big

57:52.580 --> 57:58.480
silly action movie, which Aliens is not exactly a big silly movie, like it's just a really

57:58.480 --> 57:59.480
good...

57:59.480 --> 58:00.700
It's a hardcore awesome action film.

58:00.700 --> 58:04.420
So it's kind of hard to see a series like that devolve into silly action movies.

58:04.420 --> 58:06.020
It has some of the best ad lib stuff in it too.

58:06.020 --> 58:07.980
Yeah, but I don't remember hating Alien Resurrection.

58:07.980 --> 58:12.180
Well, the thing is that from everyone that's told me that you can see the good movie it

58:12.180 --> 58:16.920
tried to be, except for people going in and changing shit.

58:16.920 --> 58:18.820
And I had two reasons for wanting to see it.

58:18.820 --> 58:20.340
Well, three reasons.

58:20.340 --> 58:21.340
Sigourney Weaver.

58:21.340 --> 58:22.340
Yep.

58:23.100 --> 58:24.340
I love Winona Ryder.

58:24.340 --> 58:25.340
I love her so much.

58:25.340 --> 58:26.340
I really love her.

58:26.340 --> 58:30.060
I mean, she's kind of, ever since that shoplifting incident, really kind of ruined her, didn't

58:30.060 --> 58:31.060
it?

58:31.060 --> 58:32.240
Well, she played Spock's mom and that was awesome.

58:32.240 --> 58:33.240
That was awesome.

58:33.240 --> 58:34.240
I lived for that.

58:34.240 --> 58:37.060
And, well, you should watch the deleted scenes she was in in that too.

58:37.060 --> 58:38.060
Oh, I haven't seen that.

58:38.060 --> 58:39.060
I need to.

58:39.060 --> 58:42.460
But the other thing was script by Joss.

58:42.460 --> 58:44.240
And I like Whedon dialogue.

58:44.240 --> 58:45.240
I'm sorry.

58:45.240 --> 58:49.580
And just, I think it would be heartbreaking to go see it, knowing what it could have been.

58:49.820 --> 58:52.020
Well, it was also a very famous director that did that.

58:52.020 --> 58:55.500
And I, of course I say that and now I can't remember the guy's name, but he had made City

58:55.500 --> 59:00.700
of Lost Children, Delicatessen, and all these very visual movies.

59:00.700 --> 59:02.580
I love City of Lost Children.

59:02.580 --> 59:03.580
Yeah.

59:03.580 --> 59:05.260
It was that, that was the director based on that movie.

59:05.260 --> 59:08.300
They asked him to do Alien Resurrection, a French guy, and I can't remember the guy's

59:08.300 --> 59:09.300
name.

59:09.300 --> 59:10.300
Somebody in chat will yell it out.

59:10.300 --> 59:12.300
That's why I love doing this live.

59:12.300 --> 59:13.300
Who needs Google?

59:13.300 --> 59:16.300
I got a chat room.

59:16.300 --> 59:18.980
So anyway, uh, let's see it.

59:18.980 --> 59:21.460
Look in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

59:21.460 --> 59:24.620
Rageinator says, yeah, I saw Alien Resurrection in theaters too.

59:24.620 --> 59:27.860
Sadly enough, not too long after that, my grandmother was rushed to the hospital and

59:27.860 --> 59:28.860
ultimately died.

59:28.860 --> 59:29.860
Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that.

59:29.860 --> 59:34.940
That kind of sucks when you have to associate something that might've been pretty good with

59:34.940 --> 59:35.940
a really bad memory.

59:35.940 --> 59:38.700
But anyway, I don't want to take this too much to a dark place.

59:38.700 --> 59:43.320
Tiger Claw says you heard about Neil Blomkamp wanting to do an Alien 5.

59:43.320 --> 59:44.320
That looked pretty awesome.

59:44.320 --> 59:46.060
I'm sure there's a lot of people.

59:46.060 --> 59:47.060
That looked pretty awesome.

59:47.060 --> 59:48.060
That want to do an Alien 5.

59:48.060 --> 59:52.140
Well, he was supposed to, I guess, originally, yeah, he was going to do that as his debut.

59:52.140 --> 59:53.140
Jean-Pierre Jeunet.

59:53.140 --> 59:54.140
Thank you.

59:54.140 --> 59:55.140
Thank you.

59:55.140 --> 59:56.140
STR 100 Matt.

59:56.140 --> 59:57.140
Jean-Pierre Jeunet.

59:57.140 --> 59:58.140
Yeah.

59:58.140 --> 01:00:00.100
The, the, uh, was it artwork for that looked pretty sweet.

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:01.100
And that's it.

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:02.200
I knew he did Amelie.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:07.100
So he came after Alien Resurrection, he did Amelie, which is like one of.

01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:08.700
I need to finish that movie.

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:13.340
It's one of, it's honestly like one of the best movies of the last decade.

01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:15.380
I can actually follow most of the dialogue in it too.

01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:16.380
I see.

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:17.380
Oh, really?

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:20.260
And I don't know if you remember, remember when I got a really, really short haircut?

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:21.700
I got her haircut.

01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:25.620
And then Amelie Resurrection just gets really strange when they start trying to blend the

01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:26.620
two genres together.

01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:29.620
It's just, I didn't understand that, but okay.

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:30.980
Oh, Ron Perlman.

01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:34.460
But watching Winona Ryder in that was a lot of fun too.

01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:36.860
Making that safe expression.

01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:40.920
I have a lot of love though for, for Aliens in the first movie.

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:43.340
Actually even liked the third one, so maybe I should see Resurrection.

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:46.380
I was trying to see what else John, that director's done.

01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:49.420
He did a movie called A Very Long Engagement, which I don't remember that movie.

01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:50.420
I've heard of it.

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:52.020
But he did that movie.

01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:55.060
And then he was kind of on a break for a little while.

01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:58.860
He did a movie in 2013 called The Young and Prodigious T.S.

01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:00.120
Spivet.

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.740
Never heard of that.

01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:02.860
Never heard of that.

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:05.620
But Helena Bonham- We just need to get guns back for another

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:06.620
second though.

01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:09.420
Oh my God, Helena Bonham Carter's in that though, and she, she is a queen.

01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:11.140
She is a queen in acting.

01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:15.500
I mean, come on, Helena Bonham Carter, like in every Tim Burton movie, just fucking steals

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:16.500
it.

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:17.500
She left him.

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:18.500
Yeah, I heard about that.

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.220
I think she's going to go for Johnny Depp.

01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:22.220
I don't know.

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:24.260
It's the OLR Hollywood gossip hour.

01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:26.380
This is what happens when there's no gaming news.

01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:30.700
But it started from a second of how awesome the Alien franchise could be.

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:33.100
You want to talk about like, I don't know, that-

01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:34.700
No, I want to talk about Winona Ryder.

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:38.060
I want to talk more about Winona Ryder.

01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:39.060
Winona Ryder?

01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:40.060
Let's talk about that.

01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:41.060
Alright, yes.

01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:42.060
No, Beetlejuice 2.

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:44.820
I'm so fucking psyched to see that whenever the hell that comes out.

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:45.820
That's going to be fantastic.

01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:47.100
Okay, okay, wait.

01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:49.180
Michael Keaton will be in a wheelchair by the time he-

01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:50.180
I don't care.

01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:51.180
It'll still be good.

01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:52.420
That's what CG is for.

01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:54.020
Ranma wins the internet today.

01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:55.020
What?

01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:59.440
No, they're fighting for custody over Johnny Depp.

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:04.620
I'm sorry, but yeah, Tim Burton- Johnny Depp is a maniac pixie girl.

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:08.020
The definitive Burton- Look, I know you want us to talk games, but there's no fucking news

01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:09.320
this week, so deal with it.

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:14.480
The definitive Burton film for me, which is also a Winona Ryder classic and a Johnny

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:19.000
Depp classic, and probably one of my favorite movies ever, is Edward Scissorhands.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
I love that movie.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000
The movie is so fucking good.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.000
I cry every time.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Every time.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Like a little baby.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Every time she's dancing in the-

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.000
If I cry-

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Every time she's dancing in the snow, I cry.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Every time.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.000
If I watch it right now, I'd be crying green tears.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I would-

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I have green mascara too.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.800
We need to do like a Let's React video to watching Edward Scissorhands.

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:33.800
Let's do it.

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:35.400
Isn't that the thing people do on YouTube?

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:36.400
Let's react.

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:37.400
Let's do it.

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:40.760
That's what thousands and millions of people have seen, but you want to see our reaction

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:41.760
to it.

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:42.760
Do the thing.

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:43.760
Do the thing.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.760
Loki, you want to join us for a Let's React to Edward Scissorhands?

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:49.760
I don't get affected that much by Edward Scissorhands.

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:51.960
You wouldn't cry manly tears just a little bit?

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:52.960
I like the movie.

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:56.200
I think it's awesome, but I'm not going to cry over it.

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:59.660
But we need your man tears.

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:02.400
As a proper feminist, I thrive on the tears of men.

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.400
I'm kidding.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.400
I'm kidding.

01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:05.400
That's bad.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:08.400
All right.

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:14.600
Raginator says in chat, the only Burton movie that I cared for was the 1989 Batman.

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:15.600
I prefer-

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:17.960
Speaking of which, the NES game is fucking amazing.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:21.200
I preferred Batman Returns, not the game because the game was kind of crap.

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:25.600
The movie Batman Returns, as much as I understand why people hated the penguin, Catwoman was

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:26.760
just perfection.

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.500
Nobody will ever match Michelle Pfeiffer.

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:30.800
She got the whip scene in one take.

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.800
Amazing.

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:32.800
I love her.

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:34.380
And she was in Grease 2.

01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:36.040
I don't mind Danny DeVito as a penguin.

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.200
I thought it was okay.

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:41.100
And Dungeon Buster says in chat, Vincent Price almost gave him real hands.

01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:42.100
That's right.

01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:46.360
One of Vincent Price's last roles was in that movie.

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:47.360
I know.

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:48.360
Let's just think about Vincent Price for a minute.

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:51.700
We're going to let Loki do the next story because it's his anyway.

01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:55.180
And Rob and I are just going to sit in a corner and eat these chocolate chip cookies and cry.

01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:56.180
That's fine.

01:03:56.180 --> 01:04:00.520
Rob, I hope you have tissues because this is expensive mascara.

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.160
It's Pantone Emerald Green today.

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.160
Hello.

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:04.960
But there's actually Kleenex on the table for the show.

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:05.960
It's like-

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:06.960
I'm sorry.

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:08.720
Next story.

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:09.720
Loki, take us back to games.

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:13.720
Since I didn't read the fine print on this story originally, today I was like, ooh, January,

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:16.200
I'm going to see what new PlayStation Plus games are on there.

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.880
Nope, they're not there yet.

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:20.360
But yes, they will be as of Tuesday.

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.960
And what can you expect on PlayStation Plus for the month of January?

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:24.640
Well, actually some pretty cool stuff.

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:28.840
For example, on PlayStation 4, as we already knew, we're getting Infamous First Light,

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:32.920
which is the standalone expansion for Infamous Second Son.

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:37.680
And then also the indie game is Swapper, will be as part of the PlayStation 4 section.

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:42.400
And then for PlayStation 3, you get Prototype 2 and DuckTales Remastered.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:49.520
And then finally on the Vita, Woah Dave and Duke Nukem 3D Megaton Edition, which that's

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:53.580
awesome that you can play Duke Nukem 3D on your Vita.

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:55.260
There's a reason to have a Vita right there.

01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:57.120
Or a PlayStation TV, I guess.

01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:00.960
Did you know that Duke Nukem 3D is actually now in the current Humble Bundle?

01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:02.440
I did actually hear about that.

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:05.000
I think we're going to talk more about the Humble Bundle that's up right now later in

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
the show.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
But yeah, I noticed that.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000
That's the problem with the Humble Bundles.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.720
I'm starting to own all the games that are on every single one now.

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:12.880
Yeah, but you can actually gift your codes now.

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:18.360
I understand that, but I have my gift code library or whatever is getting about be as

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:19.360
big as my Steam library.

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:20.360
I'm being pointed at.

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.880
You were talking before the show and you probably don't want me to bring this up on air, but

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:23.880
I don't care.

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:26.320
You were talking before the show about your idea about the multiplayer streams that you

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:30.440
and I and maybe Loki can do on Twitch or whatever.

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:31.920
We fucking need to do Duke Nukem.

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:34.800
Oh, no, no, no, not even Duke Nukem Forever.

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:35.800
It can't be that shit.

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.800
It has to be Duke Nukem 3D Deathmatch.

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:38.800
In the bundle, Duke Nukem 3D.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:39.800
Deathmatch.

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:40.800
Deathmatch Duke Nukem 3D.

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:41.800
Where you can put in the voice macros.

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.960
We can get Loki to do that one.

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:43.960
You can put in the voice macros.

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:44.960
I don't remember my PC.

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:47.400
Rob, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:49.740
There are special things about Duke Nukem 3D.

01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:52.240
It was my first land game.

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.240
Mobicon 1995.

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:58.440
Oh, I've told the story about the college dorms and the dial-up and playing Duke Nukem

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:03.640
3D where us little nerds, me and my best friend in the dorms in college.

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:04.640
We were neighbors.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:07.980
We lived right next to each other and adjoining rooms that were next to each other.

01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:13.880
And all the bros, sports player, football guys would love to watch us play.

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:18.960
And they were the biggest drama queens out of anybody I've ever met in my life because

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:21.080
they would be gossiping like, where you at?

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:22.080
Where you at?

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:24.520
And then they'd look and then they would run to the other room and tell my friend where

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:26.600
I'm hiding and where I'm camping so that he could kill me.

01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:27.600
Those bitches.

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:29.520
I'm like you little gossipy bitches.

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:30.520
Those catty bitches.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:31.520
Go out and throw your ball.

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:35.600
I wish I had some of my old maps they made during high school.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.920
There are some pretty awesome maps.

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:41.800
You're probably the type that made a map where somebody would fall an entire mile down the

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:45.000
map for no good reason than you wanted them to do that.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
I did.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Of course you did.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
But no, it wasn't.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.360
It was a great reason because you could do midair battles.

01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:55.280
But yes, I literally, because you hit page down to lower the floor of the map.

01:06:55.280 --> 01:07:00.240
So I put a paperweight on page down and went and had lunch and came back and that was part

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:01.460
of my map.

01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:04.720
The fall was a good five to six minutes long.

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:08.960
But Duke Nukem 3D gave me one of my favorite, favorite insults ever.

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:11.980
Your face, your ass, what's the difference?

01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:17.240
And I still have a WAV file from that back from AOL 2.5 days when you can play WAV files

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:21.500
in chat rooms and it's in my damn WAV file collection.

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.280
You could do that on instant messenger too.

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.280
Yes, you could.

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:27.280
That's what we did before emoticons.

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:28.280
Yeah.

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:29.280
We played WAVs.

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:30.280
Yeah.

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:31.400
You would send the WAV on AOL instant messenger.

01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:33.120
Your face, your ass, what's the difference?

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:35.720
And today we have the smiling pile of poop emoticon.

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:38.480
Oh the smiling pile of poop.

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:39.480
You know what?

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:40.480
What?

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:45.920
I used to have a theme song that would play every time I'd go into a chat room back in

01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:47.760
the Sailor Moon chat room on AOL.

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.160
I'm sure that wasn't annoying whatsoever.

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:52.320
Who remembers Town Square Sailor Moon?

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:53.320
I do.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:59.240
Oh look at this, you gotta love the Google-Fu of the live chatters.

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:00.240
You gotta love this.

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:03.320
Tigerclaw dug this up in like 30 seconds.

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:06.240
Your face, your ass, what's the difference?

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:08.400
Oh yeah.

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:11.520
We also had a really horrible one that we would use, and I know it's not politically

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:18.320
correct but I'm gonna say it anyway, is like, who are you, the poster child for abortion?

01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:19.320
Who was it?

01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:20.320
I don't remember that one, didn't I?

01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:22.560
It was a voice macro that one of my friends made.

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:28.160
Who was it that used to do that during, who was it, it was one of the games we'd play

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:32.760
like a VOG game night or something like that that someone would play those macros through.

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:39.120
That was when we were playing Perfect Dark, and I want to say it was like me and Breslull,

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:43.640
maybe Travis Donovan was in on that too, but I think it was SSGA 100 Matt had one of those

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:47.440
little like adapter things for the Xbox 360 controller so he could drop in those little

01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:51.200
clips while we're trying to play on Xbox, I think it was like a Perfect Dark match we

01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:55.780
were all playing, and SSGA 100 Matt was being a little smart ass, so I think he called into

01:08:55.780 --> 01:09:00.480
the show and talked about it around that time, just go look up the show from whenever Perfect

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:01.520
Dark was released.

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:06.560
For the record, I would never say something like that to somebody.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:07.560
To their face.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:10.920
No, ever, because I don't think that's something they make fun of.

01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:11.920
Alright.

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:14.240
I'm a good girl, dammit!

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:15.240
Mmhmm.

01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:16.240
Alright.

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:22.320
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com,

01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:24.880
use the passphrase, hammer.

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:25.880
Let's move on.

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:29.040
Well, if you're a good girl that wants to be bad, very very very bad, you could play

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:35.200
a very naughty, very graphic, very gory game, such as Mortal Kombat X.

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:37.920
Darsaka, are you looking forward to Mortal Kombat X?

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:38.920
Fuck no.

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:41.680
I thought this would be the type of game that's up your alley.

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:45.960
I don't know, these, I like me some Mortal Kombat, don't get me wrong, it's always been

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:52.760
my favorite fighting franchise because it's a little bit over the top and silly and cartoon

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:59.460
violent, but when I'm seeing the new one and the movies and stuff and the fatality images

01:09:59.460 --> 01:10:03.360
that are coming from the new Mortal Kombat, I'm like, this is starting to get a little

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:04.360
too real for me.

01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:08.920
I mean, I realize it's over the top, but now we're crossing that line into Saw movie territory

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:10.480
and I don't know how that makes me feel.

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:11.480
That's awesome.

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:12.480
Yeah.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.520
I don't know, some of the stuff is, it's gross, but regardless, I'll probably make my mom

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:22.920
play this one too and record it and put it on the internet because it's funny.

01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:27.720
But Mortal Kombat X, some more information came out about this one, and this is thanks

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:33.640
to a Finnish gaming magazine who I guess got to see some more information by taking a trip

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:40.000
to the studios, and one of the new fighters that they unveiled is an older Kung Lao because

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000
this game does take place a little later on in the Mortal Kombat history.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.920
So now you have a Kung Lao who still has the hat with a bunch of spikes on it, but now

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:54.920
a little bit of the gray mustache and beard thing going on there, and they talk about

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:59.200
that some of the differences with the Tempest and Buzzsaw and Hat Trick variations are some

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:01.160
of the biggest ones yet.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:04.940
He uses more spinning attacks and has the ability to set his hat to spin around him

01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:06.560
as a shield of sorts.

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:10.800
And the Buzzsaw variation, his hat is sharpened with razor blade edges and allows the player

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.880
to control the hat that throws more.

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:16.720
And then Hat Trick is an experimental one because you can throw and call back your hat

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:18.560
at any point you want.

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:22.420
This keeps the opponent on their toes because the hat can extend combos.

01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:25.960
Don't forget the fighters in Mortal Kombat X, they're going to have these different variations.

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:27.680
That's part of the game.

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:31.000
They'll be different flavors of the same character.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.800
It's kind of their experimental place that they're going.

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.180
So yeah, that's pretty neat.

01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:41.200
Some other little tidbits on Mortal Kombat X. Ed Boon talking about that the online features

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:43.660
are more complex this time around.

01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:48.000
When you start the game, you get to choose your own alliance from five different options.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.820
The Lin Kuei, the White Lotus, the Brotherhood of Shadows, the Special Force, and the Black

01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:52.820
Dragon.

01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:56.740
And so your team will be gathering battle points for the team, which will decide how

01:11:56.740 --> 01:11:59.900
the game menus look in single and multiplayer.

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:04.980
So every player contributes to the entirety, whether or not you prefer the social aspects

01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:05.980
or playing by yourself.

01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:11.800
That sounds kind of neat, that everybody will be championing a different faction, and whatever

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:14.820
faction is in the lead kind of controls what everybody sees.

01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:22.060
And you're Slytherin, and you're Hufflepuff, and you're Gryffindor.

01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:28.320
Harry has decapitated his opponent, ten points to Gryffindor.

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:31.100
It's extreme quidditch is what this all is.

01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:35.740
Kung Lao's just going to hop on a broom and fly around, and him and Cassie Cage and all

01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:40.740
these other new people that are showing up in the game.

01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:43.820
Have you seen some of the fatalities out of Mortal Kombat X?

01:12:43.820 --> 01:12:48.740
I gotta say, Joystiq ran an article this week talking about, I don't know, it was talking

01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:51.500
about why do we like gory games so damn much or whatever.

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:55.540
And there was some picture that went with the article that's like this new bug queen

01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:58.980
or whatever she is that's one of the new playable characters in the game.

01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:04.940
It was a gif of, and yes I said gif, deal with it, it was a gif of her fatality where

01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:09.900
these bugs fly out and eat Scorpion's head.

01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:14.500
It's not just enough, like in the old games it would have been LOL, his face melted and

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:15.500
that's it.

01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:17.620
But it wasn't enough because now it has to go over the top.

01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:22.020
Not only do the bugs eat away his face, but then they eat so much of his face that his

01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:28.260
jaw snaps off, then his head falls off and rolls on the ground, and if that wasn't enough,

01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:31.540
she takes her heel and stomps out his head.

01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:34.600
She just did a hacky sack with it.

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:41.720
So it's like, and all of this on the Playstation 4 and Xbox One and this generation of gaming's

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:44.640
ultra photorealistic technology.

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:47.600
That's why even I'm starting to take after my mother.

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:48.600
That's gross.

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:49.600
That is so gross.

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:52.360
In this day and age of like indie games and being able to make whatever you want, why

01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:57.120
don't we get like a really, really, really over the top thrill kill type game?

01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:01.360
Like just so beyond tasteful.

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:05.200
Well there's that very controversial.

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:06.200
What is it?

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:07.200
Hatred is the name of that game?

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:10.920
Surely you've heard about this because there's a whole, there's a whole back and forth about

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:11.920
the Steam Greenlight.

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:19.800
Well, it's back now because that's kind of where, that kind of, it's too much for me.

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:20.800
Too much.

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.000
Too much.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:28.120
But I also think the Saw movies and those type of ultra gore movies don't exactly contribute

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:29.880
a lot either and I don't watch them.

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:33.520
So I at least apply that logic consistently.

01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:40.480
Anyway, all right, let's move on and we're going to travel around the world and check

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:41.880
out some release dates here in a minute.

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:46.480
But first, Dark Sakura has something a little different, but you know, there wasn't a lot

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:47.480
of news.

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:48.480
So we have different things.

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:51.400
Well, you know, I talk about science.

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.400
There's nothing wrong with science.

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:53.400
Yeah.

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:59.840
So basically it's not necessarily video game, but it's video game-ish because it's a simulation.

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:05.160
They're actually using data from airport x-ray simulations to help with security and

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:07.760
cancer screening.

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:13.200
Basically for people who use security x-rays over and over again, the machines, they become

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:17.600
adept at recognizing certain patterns, what certain contraband looks like.

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.280
And so it builds up their reaction time.

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:23.520
They could spot it in an instant and they're using the same type of simulation to help

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:29.080
people recognize certain things a lot faster.

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:35.000
Basically they are using the simulations to help them find things that they couldn't

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.800
otherwise in a lab environment.

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:44.960
So now they have it to where they can do all of these different simulations to mimic what

01:15:44.960 --> 01:15:47.880
would have taken that many trials.

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:53.160
So they're actually using the same data to help radiologists read cancer scans, to help

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:55.000
with all kinds of other things.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.760
But they are working with funding coming from the Homeland Security Solutions and the

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:01.480
Army Research Center.

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:06.820
So and he's trying to get work with some of the groups that work with TSA.

01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:10.660
So we could get some benefit out of this, but it's the same reaction time that comes

01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:15.040
from gaming, you know, simulations.

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:16.960
They're basically just focused games.

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:19.240
I guess that is true.

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:20.240
Yeah.

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.240
All right.

01:16:21.240 --> 01:16:24.240
Well, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates, L.O.L.

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:27.120
No, I'm going to stay home and eat these cookies.

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:29.080
I kind of think this is going to be.

01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:30.680
But you know, we do the segment every week.

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:31.680
So let's see.

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:32.680
You never know.

01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:33.680
There might be some really weird, obscure thing.

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:38.000
Didn't we get like Bioshock 2 like the first week of January one year?

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.280
Like didn't we get Bioshock 2 or one of the Bioshock, yeah, Bioshock 2 I think was like

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:43.680
one of the first weeks in January.

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:44.680
Yeah.

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:47.700
And Final Fantasy 13.2 I think a few years ago was like early January, wasn't it?

01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:50.960
So sometimes, sometimes you have something here or there, but I don't know.

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:51.960
Let's see.

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:53.400
Let's check out release dates this week.

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:57.040
Um, sadly, there is not, that's not the case this year.

01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:01.960
There's actually nothing coming out until the end of January as of right now.

01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:08.200
And the last, the next thing that's coming out actually would be Saints Row, Gat Out

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:12.840
of Hell for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and PC.

01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:17.200
Then they're doing the kind of remastered Saints Row 4 with Gat Out of Hell.

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:19.560
That's not coming out though until the end of the month.

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:24.960
In the meantime, nothing.

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:27.840
Traveling over to Japan, it's really the same story.

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:30.200
There's really nothing to report over in Japan.

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:35.200
No real releases until we get to at least January 15th and things don't really pick

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:37.000
up until January the 22nd.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.200
So now's the time to start catching up on your gaming or maybe you're preordering big

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:46.880
releases that are coming out in the year in Japan such as Final Fantasy Type 0 HD, which

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:51.160
is March 19th, 2015 coming out in Japan.

01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:55.760
But as far as January goes in this first week, nothing being released in Japan.

01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:57.160
Dark Sakura, how about the UK?

01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:00.800
Three whole games, at least that they're telling me of.

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.320
Warhammer Quest for Mac and for PC.

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.520
So I guess that's technically one game.

01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:09.480
And then Captain Toad Treasure Tracker will be out on the 8th.

01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:10.640
The other one's going to be on the 7th.

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:11.640
Oh, that's right.

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:14.120
Europe had to wait till this year, but they got a bumped up release.

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:15.120
Sorry Europe.

01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:16.120
Yeah.

01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:19.080
They had to wait, but at least there's some games that you got well before we did.

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:20.080
Yeah.

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:21.520
And at least you're getting a game this week.

01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:23.560
And we bitched about it until we got it.

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:24.560
That's right.

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:25.560
All right.

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:26.560
That's how it works in America.

01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:28.480
We bitch until we get our way.

01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:32.620
Just a couple more stories for you guys then our classic game of the week.

01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:33.960
But first, Loki.

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:34.960
Yes.

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:40.120
So I don't know if I'm not too sad about this, but I guess if you're looking for a cheaper

01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:45.680
option for Kinect for Windows, you're going to be out of luck pretty soon.

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:54.360
The original Kinect adapter, which came out back in 2013, is going to be phased out.

01:18:54.360 --> 01:19:00.400
They're going to be actually only having the version 2, the one that would be coming with

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:01.400
the Xbox One.

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:06.160
Also, the one that's more expensive, that is going to be the one that you're going to

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:07.160
be able to buy.

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:11.400
Now, however, I don't know how many people actually use Kinect for Windows, aside from

01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:14.240
maybe people developing stuff for Kinect.

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:17.680
But you probably want the new sensor anyways, because the old one wasn't as good.

01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:22.600
It's just so much more expensive.

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:23.600
So yeah.

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:24.600
That's that.

01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:25.600
All right.

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:29.840
Well, I don't know how many of you guys are playing the Halo 5 beta.

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:31.320
That's another one of my gaming resolutions.

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:34.280
By the way, finally get a freaking Xbox One, because I really should have bought one over

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:35.360
this holiday season.

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:38.400
But for personal reasons, I was unable to.

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:40.500
Nothing against Microsoft or the Xbox One.

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:43.480
Just had to put my money in other places.

01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:47.600
But I do want to get an Xbox One over the next year, and one of the games I would likely

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:49.560
check out on it is Halo 5.

01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:54.120
I surprisingly have not been hearing a lot about the beta on Twitter.

01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:56.000
Maybe I just follow the wrong crowd.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:59.600
I guess I have a lot more Nintendo fans that I know.

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:05.200
But I know the Halo 5 Guardians multiplayer beta is going on right now on Xbox One.

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:07.240
And they are mixing it up a little bit this week.

01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:09.600
It started on December 29th.

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:13.940
This week, they're going to be adding Breakout, which is round-based, and your Spartan has

01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:15.840
one life each round.

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:18.640
The first team to take five rounds wins the match.

01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:24.580
And there are two maps that you can play Breakout on called Crossfire and a variant named Trench.

01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:28.600
There are some new maps coming to the Slayer playlist, Regret and Eden.

01:20:28.600 --> 01:20:30.400
Regret is a remix of the Truth map.

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:32.980
Eden is a remix of the Empire map.

01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:35.840
Those were both playable in week one.

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:42.480
And thanks to a user vote, you can now wield the Hydra MLS, which is a brand new weapon

01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:44.480
in the Halo universe.

01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:45.480
So there you go.

01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:50.040
That is all the updates on what's going on with the Halo 5 Guardians beta, which looks

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:51.040
pretty.

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:54.040
I need to go look up some YouTubes and live streams and try to see this a little more

01:20:54.040 --> 01:20:55.040
in action.

01:20:55.040 --> 01:21:00.360
I just, you know, again, I skipped out on Xbox One, unfortunately, this time around,

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:02.480
and just didn't get a chance to check this out.

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:04.240
So I don't know.

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:06.720
Have you been hearing anything on the Halo 5 beta, Loki?

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:12.200
Nope, because I'm a marginal Halo fan and I don't have an Xbox One.

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:17.000
Going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com, ActDeaf says, Sky, you follow me and I'm the

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:18.000
right crowd.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Where are you playing?

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.200
Please chatters, you guys can help when we, you know, we don't have time to play everything

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:24.620
or money to play everything.

01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:28.720
So if you guys have played something we haven't, we're dying to know your opinion is the show

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:30.060
where every gamer has a voice.

01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:38.100
So over at live.vognetwork.com, let us know what I might be missing by not checking this

01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:39.100
out.

01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:41.420
All right, let's get to the classic game of the week.

01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:42.420
You know what?

01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:43.420
Who needs Halo 5?

01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:44.900
In fact, who needs Halo 1?

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:47.420
When you've got classics to play.

01:21:47.420 --> 01:21:53.220
That's right, it's time for Dark Soccer to step into the gaming vault and find a classic

01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:57.020
game that she thinks, hey, you should be playing this game this week.

01:21:57.020 --> 01:21:59.860
Forget all this newfangled technology.

01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:02.500
This is the time of year where we catch up on games.

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:05.540
It's time for you to catch up on games that are 10 years old.

01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:09.780
I had to check five times to see if I've done this game before.

01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:12.020
I was shocked that you have never done this game before.

01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:14.300
I've been shocking myself lately.

01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:15.460
Shocked.

01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:17.700
This is really a duh this week, people.

01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:18.700
But I'm all right.

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:20.620
We have to start with the music, though, for the first one.

01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:24.740
Well, it is a game that people need to frickin' check out if they haven't already.

01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:29.700
It's one of the best music games ever and really, a little bit more.

01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:36.340
Do you guys hear this Eurobeat?

01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:39.140
This very specialized Eurobeat.

01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:41.220
The game is Guitar Man.

01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:48.500
Guitar Man is a music game that was done by, I'm going to mispronounce this, but it's Enis,

01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:53.100
I-N-I-S, and it was published by Koei for the PS2.

01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:54.100
Enis!

01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:55.100
Enis!

01:22:55.100 --> 01:23:01.180
Excuse me, I had to burp off the mic.

01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:02.860
All the Enis talk made you burp.

01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:09.380
Oh, Enis, it makes my gastrointestinal tract just inflamed for the Enis.

01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:14.660
Anyway, the game has actually, the artwork is done actually by one of my favorite commercial

01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:21.620
artists, Mitsuru Nakamura, and the music was done by a band called Coil, of course, Japanese

01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:22.620
band.

01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:28.140
It came out on June 21st, 2001 in North America, I'm sorry, in Japan, and in North America

01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:33.500
on February 18th, 2002 in Europe it came out June 21st, 2002.

01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:38.980
It's had a port that came out on PSP called Guitar Man Lives, and in Japan it was Guitar

01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:43.460
Man Live, which I think is a better name, but that came out in 2006.

01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:45.740
So what the hell kind of game is this, huh?

01:23:45.740 --> 01:23:50.980
Well you play as a character named Yuwan, which actually his name made so much more

01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:56.300
sense in the Japanese version, it was Yuichi, which that actually, it's the same thing,

01:23:56.300 --> 01:23:58.100
it just sounds like it makes more sense.

01:23:58.100 --> 01:24:06.060
Anyway, he's kind of bullied on, and the girl he likes doesn't like him, so basically his

01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:08.060
dog teaches him how to play guitar.

01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:10.820
His dog's name is Puma.

01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:13.900
And he eventually becomes the Guitar Man.

01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:20.780
He inherits the last Gitaroo, and so he has to fight these huge creatures that also control

01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:22.900
Gitaroos.

01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:29.300
You have different kind of bars that move around for a center location, and so you move

01:24:29.300 --> 01:24:34.140
the analog controller in conjunction with these bars you have to go, and you tap certain

01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:35.860
buttons at certain times.

01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:41.700
You've got five different phases, and you've got a life bar.

01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:45.620
So the better you do, the more you take off of the other person.

01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:48.580
The worse that you do, the more life you lose.

01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:55.900
So you've technically got, the three main phases are charge, attack, and guard, where

01:24:55.900 --> 01:25:01.300
you have to follow a trace line with the analog stick, and then you have red phase bars so

01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:05.860
that you can press buttons at the end of the phases, so that you time it when it hits the

01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:06.860
screen.

01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:07.860
Basically it's all rhythm.

01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:13.100
In charge you get notes that restore your health, and in attack that's when you actually

01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:15.340
start attacking the other guys.

01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:22.540
You also have the harmony and the end phase, and really, it's hard to really describe the

01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:24.140
game as something that you'll just have to see.

01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:25.580
Can I play the other song though?

01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:26.580
Yes please.

01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:28.300
Oh, I put up the Sandbone Trio I think.

01:25:28.300 --> 01:25:30.300
Yes, that is the other song that we're going to hear.

01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:31.780
The Sandbone Trio is like my second favorite song.

01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:32.780
The Born To Be Bone song.

01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:33.780
Turn it up a touch.

01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:34.780
Such a good song.

01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:43.500
The soundtrack for this game is a maze, anyway.

01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:46.220
And by the way, AkumaJP in chat says it's pronounced Ani-Sue.

01:25:46.220 --> 01:25:47.220
Ani-Sue?

01:25:47.220 --> 01:25:48.220
Mm-hmm.

01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:49.220
Okay.

01:25:49.220 --> 01:25:50.220
Thank you.

01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:51.220
I still like anus!

01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:52.220
You would.

01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:55.260
Shut up, what do you try to say?

01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:56.260
Anyway...

01:25:56.260 --> 01:25:57.260
Is that a gay joke?

01:25:57.260 --> 01:25:59.180
No, maybe you just have...

01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:01.180
You could be a proctologist, Rob.

01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:03.460
One day, Rob, you could be a proctologist.

01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:04.460
Classic game.

01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:05.460
Talk about it.

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:09.140
And there's also Master's Mode once you've beaten the game once, where it's a lot harder,

01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:13.180
you have a lot more complex notes, the trace line becomes more difficult, and you take

01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:16.820
more damage from mistakes, then you get Versus Mode that you can play up to four player,

01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:22.260
where you play each other in two teams doing the guitaros parts and the opponents parts.

01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:30.020
The PSP version has Duet Mode, where you can play cooperatively via the ad hoc in two new

01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:34.500
levels where you get Metal Header and Tota Passion.

01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:39.700
So the characters in the game, like I said, you have Yuwan or Yuichi, who is the guitar

01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:40.700
man.

01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:48.180
You have Puma, who turns into something called Puma AC30, and he's like a big kind of weird

01:26:48.180 --> 01:26:49.660
patchwork robot dog.

01:26:49.660 --> 01:26:58.380
You have Pico, who's the girl that Yuwan wants, and Kazuo, who's the guy who likes to take

01:26:58.380 --> 01:26:59.380
Pico away.

01:26:59.380 --> 01:27:08.220
Then you've got all the bad guys, so the main bad guy is Zoe, who is trying to take over

01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:11.420
the universe through capturing all the guitaros.

01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:16.100
You've got your bad guys, like the one that the music we played last was The Flying O,

01:27:16.100 --> 01:27:20.860
which is a giant UFO that makes everyone para-para into death.

01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:26.500
This one is the sand bone trio, so there are three skeletons named Carrot, Pine, and Soda

01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:31.620
that play their own ribs for the musical instruments, you know, all kinds of different ones.

01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:32.700
That ain't weird or anything.

01:27:32.700 --> 01:27:35.700
And you have your backup band, who show up randomly in different levels.

01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:40.700
So you get Norin, who wears a rabbit suit, Yung, who wears a monkey suit, and Yasuda

01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:44.420
Sun, who wears a panda suit.

01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:50.380
The soundtrack, the CD came out in 2001, has the majority of the songs in it, and it's

01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:52.900
missing most of the background music, though.

01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:59.060
But it does have some of the Master Mode versions, it has also the remixes of some of the songs.

01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:04.300
As far as other versions, there was one called Guitar Man 1, that was a trial release of

01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:11.020
the game, but it also had a demo of the para-para stage, and cinematic scenes that were only

01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:15.260
exclusive to that version, and a game where you could play Puma trying to eat donuts falling

01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:17.780
from the sky.

01:28:17.780 --> 01:28:21.500
Then of course there was Guitar Man Live, or in Japan it was Guitar Man Live, that was

01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:22.500
the PSP version.

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:28.900
It had extra goodies, and that came out in Japan on June 8th, 2006, Europe September

01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:32.980
26th, 2006, and in North America November 14th, 2006.

01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:34.980
So that's the one we actually got after Europe.

01:28:34.980 --> 01:28:39.100
See Europe, you get some before us, but we bitch until we get it.

01:28:39.100 --> 01:28:40.100
And that's it.

01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:45.180
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, a true classic for music game fans,

01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:47.060
which we all are here at OLR.

01:28:47.060 --> 01:28:48.060
I suck at it.

01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:51.420
Guitar Man, there you go.

01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:56.580
Then you would probably not like Hatsune Miku, which to me plays very similar.

01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:59.620
Like obviously they have their differences, but I do feel like it's probably the most

01:28:59.620 --> 01:29:02.540
similar thing to Guitar Man that's out there, is Hatsune Miku.

01:29:02.540 --> 01:29:04.020
I don't know if you'd care for that.

01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:07.500
I love Hatsune Miku though, that game's a lot of fun, I need to get the new one that

01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:08.900
just came out.

01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:10.820
But anyway, we're gonna take a break.

01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:16.340
We got more OLR coming up, including our 2015 predictions, that's right, listless returns

01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:20.280
tonight, and you guys will help us come up with a definitive list in our chatroom over

01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:28.000
at live.vognetwork.com, but we will do all that and some more news, scraping what little

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:32.840
pieces of news there are together, and your calls, most importantly, in the mailbag, when

01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:42.640
we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.

01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:47.160
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live on this Sunday evening, January the 4th

01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:54.640
of 2015, with episode number 582 of our show, In Progress, and we've been talking a little

01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:57.360
bit about what little gaming news there is this week.

01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:02.880
We talked about the Sony PlayStation hack apology thing earlier, and the piracy being

01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:06.980
combated in Talos Principle, we talked a little bit about that earlier, talked a little bit

01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:10.000
about an update on the VoG jam, they were talking about that in the chatroom during

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.240
the break, and Loki actually working on his game during the show, and you said you fixed

01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:15.240
the bug.

01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:18.760
Yeah I fixed it, I had to copy paste everything from the project that I was working on into

01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:20.080
a new project, then it fixed it.

01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:21.360
That's so weird that that would do it.

01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:22.360
And what was the problem you were having?

01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:23.360
You were having some textures?

01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:29.800
It seems in between, my maps are a bunch of 3D objects right now, and I may just fuse

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:34.640
them all together later, but right now it's a bunch of 3D objects, and so in between the

01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:39.840
seams were showing, and it wasn't doing that before as my screenshot, and they're still

01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:48.120
kind of showing, but it's way less noticeable now, it's very, I can deal with that much

01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:55.320
showing, that's fine, but before it was just like really horrible from far away.

01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:58.160
Good on you though, troubleshooting while we're trying to do a show, that's great, love

01:30:58.160 --> 01:30:59.160
it.

01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:00.160
Thanks for the break.

01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:05.880
We also derailed into movie chat, which by the way, we derailed into talking about Winona

01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:15.120
Ryder and how underrated she is, I know right, but this reminded me of a Twitter thing that

01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:19.560
had come up earlier, and I was talking on Twitter, and it was Tiger Claw or somebody

01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:24.760
had brought it up talking about, it is the year 2015, and a lot of people are talking

01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:29.760
about, oh it's the year of Back to the Future 2, and you talk about Slow News Week, you

01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:33.840
have a lot of these websites like Buzzfeed and so forth are having to live on the, here's

01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:38.560
20 things that Back to the Future 2 got wrong about the year 2015 and all this stuff.

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:40.680
It just started, there's still time.

01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:44.880
There's still time for hoverboards and auto-tying shoelaces right, but here's the funny thing

01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:47.180
about that, I was like, oh I have a really funny story about that, you know what that

01:31:47.180 --> 01:31:48.180
story is?

01:31:48.180 --> 01:31:51.920
I've never seen Back to the Future Part 2, yep, that's my funny story, I've never seen

01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:52.920
Back to the Future Part 2.

01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:54.720
You're not missing anything, it was really awful.

01:31:54.720 --> 01:32:00.300
Now here's the weird thing, here's what makes that story weird, I've seen Part 1, and I've

01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:04.240
seen Part 3, I've never seen Part 2.

01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:08.600
I was like that well into adulthood, I didn't see the second one until I moved out here.

01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:09.600
Oh interesting.

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:10.600
Yep.

01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:11.880
Yeah no, I never got around to seeing the second one.

01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:16.740
I remember we saw the third one, like one of those like rainy day or substitute teacher

01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:17.740
type of things.

01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:21.560
Like you remember when they would just show you a movie in class, even though you're supposed

01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:24.600
to be learning, they show you a movie because clearly something's going on behind the scenes

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:25.600
you're not supposed to know about.

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:26.600
Oh no.

01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:27.600
So it's like, just shut them up, we're just gonna show a movie.

01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:31.040
We wouldn't get a movie, we would get The Reel to Reel by Seba Gygi.

01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:32.840
What is that?

01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:38.120
It was, it's a research facility, they used to put out educational films, and so we had

01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:42.600
the, they'd bring out the projector and make us watch science stuff.

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:46.960
That, okay, we had something like that in our physics class.

01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:50.920
We had that all the way through elementary school and then in middle school.

01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:54.880
My physics teacher in high school was a crazy bastard, but I mean that in the best possible

01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:55.880
way.

01:32:55.880 --> 01:32:56.880
He was, he was so awesome.

01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:59.560
He wore a Star Trek uniform to work every single day.

01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:00.760
That's what kind of a badass he was.

01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:01.760
Okay that's cool.

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:05.560
And during recess he always played music that he would blast on these loudspeakers, it was

01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:12.440
like this big orchestral type epic thing, and it was always timed precisely to end right

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:13.760
when the bell would ring.

01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:19.560
Like the music would go, doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo, and then the bell, brrrr.

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:22.200
Like he, like you, he made a science out of this.

01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:25.560
And the greatest thing about him, like this guy, you know, I'm a, I'm a teacher of sorts

01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:28.800
now and I gotta say this guy is an inspiration in certain ways.

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:32.640
I mean even though I just called him a crazy bastard, again I say that with the utmost

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:36.920
respect of this that I take after that a little bit.

01:33:36.920 --> 01:33:43.440
But um, oh my god, this guy, he used to deliver jokes in the most deadpan way ever.

01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:45.680
Like he was a teacher on Strangers with Candy.

01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:48.460
He was like Mr. Noblitt or something like that, I swear to god.

01:33:48.460 --> 01:33:49.460
So that guy was amazing.

01:33:49.460 --> 01:33:55.240
Going to the chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com, Tigerclaw saying, Sky, you must see Back to

01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:56.560
the Future Part II.

01:33:56.560 --> 01:33:58.780
PushyPixels saying, Rob, seriously?

01:33:58.780 --> 01:33:59.780
You need to see it.

01:33:59.780 --> 01:34:02.480
Fifth Dream saying, I saw it in the theater.

01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:07.520
Alright, look, I'll try, you know, why don't we do a Dark Soccer and Rob Let's React to

01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:11.000
Back to the Future Part II YouTube.

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.000
I'll tell you what.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:13.840
But hey, Michael J. Fox in drag.

01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:15.800
I've got the whole trilogy on Blu-ray.

01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:17.280
I'll bring it next week, yes.

01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:18.280
Nice.

01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:19.280
Alright.

01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:20.280
I've got it too.

01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:21.280
I mean, you know who I married.

01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:22.280
Hey, I don't have it.

01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:24.280
So some of you need to just bring it over.

01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:27.600
That reminds me, I just need to watch Tron again.

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:32.060
But I have all the Star Trek Next Generation movies on Blu-ray thanks to my high school

01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:33.060
physics teacher.

01:34:33.060 --> 01:34:34.060
Alright.

01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:35.060
Not really.

01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:37.060
But I did watch a lot of Next Generation in high school.

01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:42.060
Anyway, we had a lot, we had to watch a lot of rapid fire news go by before we get to

01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:45.020
our 2015 predictions list list tonight.

01:34:45.020 --> 01:34:46.780
Let's get into some rapid fire news.

01:34:46.780 --> 01:34:48.380
Loki, the Dark Sakura.

01:34:48.380 --> 01:34:52.140
I would like to derail this real quick since you just mentioned Star Trek The Next Generation.

01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:53.140
Oh sure.

01:34:53.140 --> 01:34:58.660
I just thought I would pitch a game idea real quick because I think it's hilarious.

01:34:58.660 --> 01:35:01.340
And since I'm not going to be able to work on something like that.

01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:05.900
But you know, I know they've had like, you know, red shirts type of game where, you know,

01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:09.220
you're basically playing kind of as the crew members that are expendable.

01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:15.180
But imagine if you will, kind of combining the Star Trek Next Generation with say, it

01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:16.180
wasn't Six Feet Under.

01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:20.020
What was that one where she was the Grim Reaper?

01:35:20.020 --> 01:35:21.020
Yep.

01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:22.060
Whatever that one is.

01:35:22.060 --> 01:35:26.780
But basically where the object of the game is you have to kill those people on their

01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:30.140
away missions using like the environment or something like that.

01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:34.900
Like you are, you know, the Grim Reaper that has to kill the red shirts on their way.

01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:38.540
I think it would be an interesting game where you play, well, maybe, and maybe you're saying

01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:41.980
this is what's already been done, where you play as the red shirt, but you're having to

01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:46.340
deal with like, you don't want to go into these situations, but you have to, and you

01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:50.500
have a completely incompetent boss who keeps sending you into these death missions and

01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:51.820
death traps.

01:35:51.820 --> 01:35:55.140
And maybe at the end of the game, you find like out like some like weird twists.

01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:57.940
Like the boss has been out to like purposely kill you the whole time.

01:35:57.940 --> 01:35:59.900
Cause there's something, I don't know, involving your family.

01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:05.900
Like a game called, I wear a red shirt, Zach Brannigan, anyway, I like those ideas.

01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:06.900
Those are good ideas.

01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:07.900
Those are good.

01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:08.900
All right.

01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:09.900
How about some rapid fire news though?

01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:11.140
Back to games that actually exist.

01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:12.140
Okay.

01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:18.380
So there's a rumor that apparently the data for a duck hunt amiibo is on the Smash Brothers

01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:19.380
disc.

01:36:19.380 --> 01:36:24.020
And I guess there is some video that came out kind of showing, um, that they hacked,

01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:27.660
I don't know if they hacked, you know, the near field communication or did something

01:36:27.660 --> 01:36:34.580
to where it tricked it, allegedly to believe that there was a amiibo that, you know, doesn't

01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:35.980
exist yet.

01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:42.360
And apparently a menu came up, um, showing like the duck hunt figures.

01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:47.620
I don't know if that's true or not, but, um, I could see them putting out an amiibo and

01:36:47.620 --> 01:36:51.980
I could definitely see that the game would support, um, characters that aren't out yet.

01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:55.940
I mean, I know they did the same thing with like, was it Disney infinity and stuff supporting

01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:57.420
characters that weren't out yet.

01:36:57.420 --> 01:36:58.940
Um, but they were planned.

01:36:58.940 --> 01:37:04.660
So I can see that I'm pretty sure Nintendo has an amiibo plan for every single character

01:37:04.660 --> 01:37:05.740
in Smash Brothers.

01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:08.340
I'm pretty sure that's the thing that's going to happen.

01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:12.700
So but, um, except maybe Pac-Man because of the licensing issues.

01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:15.980
But then again, if they got mega man and Sonic, I don't see why they won't have a Pac-Man

01:37:15.980 --> 01:37:16.980
amiibo.

01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:17.980
I'm sure they would.

01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:18.980
Yeah, they could.

01:37:18.980 --> 01:37:22.260
Um, so I don't know, I guess we'll have to wait and see.

01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:25.360
I'm sure that, you know, that'll be another one of those intended directs where they announced

01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:26.360
more amiibo figures.

01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:27.600
Hooray!

01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:28.600
Hooray!

01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:30.080
Um, this is kind of cool.

01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:35.720
There's going to be some idea factory RPGs now coming to PC.

01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:41.580
And with this, they're going to have Hyperdimension Neptunia Rebirth 1 and Hyperdimension Neptunia

01:37:41.580 --> 01:37:47.760
Rebirth 2, which were both originally out at least over here on the Vita.

01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:52.820
And then, um, Fairy Fencer F, which was a PlayStation 3 title that's coming out over

01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:55.320
here as well on Steam.

01:37:55.320 --> 01:38:01.360
So, um, no exact date when those are going to be available, but they should be coming

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:02.360
soon.

01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:05.260
So, um, I'll have to wait and see for those.

01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:10.320
And then last but not least, there is a code that's been released for Pokemon Omega Ruby

01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:16.200
and Alpha Sapphire, uh, for, uh, Super- was it Superior?

01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:24.200
Um, it's, I guess, an unlocked code that was on the last Pokemon Get TV.

01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:30.960
And the code, I guess, is redeemable after January 29th and available for use up through

01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:34.160
November 30th, 2015.

01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:39.920
And I guess the code is just Pokemon 497 and it'll unlock, I guess, a character?

01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:41.320
I don't know.

01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:45.720
I think Superior or whatever, Superior is the Pokemon.

01:38:45.720 --> 01:38:46.720
I think is the deal.

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:48.000
So they're saying-

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:49.000
I don't know.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:53.180
When even Shane is on this show saying it was, uh, really not a good Pokemon game, that

01:38:53.180 --> 01:38:57.060
really makes me go, well, I have concerns, but then again, we had a caller call in and

01:38:57.060 --> 01:38:58.060
say, no, he's wrong.

01:38:58.060 --> 01:38:59.180
It's the best game of the year.

01:38:59.180 --> 01:39:03.140
So I suppose there's, uh, two sides to all that.

01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:04.140
So I don't know.

01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:05.140
Cool.

01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:06.140
I guess.

01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:07.140
I'm not a Pokemon fan.

01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:09.180
So yeah, that means little to me.

01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:10.180
All right.

01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:11.180
Uh, DarkStalker.

01:39:11.180 --> 01:39:12.180
How about you?

01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:14.180
I'm busy cooking.

01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:16.100
Those cookies you brought are so good.

01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:17.100
Curse you.

01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:18.500
No, bless me.

01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:19.500
Delicious cookies.

01:39:20.060 --> 01:39:25.220
Um, so there is a, um, an extension to my Nintendo.

01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:30.380
Now this isn't an extension for the Digital Deluxe promotion, but you can redeem your

01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:34.220
vouchers for it through April.

01:39:34.220 --> 01:39:36.820
Basically the program's being extended through April 1st.

01:39:36.820 --> 01:39:42.620
Um, but the actual ability to purchase it ended at the end of the year.

01:39:42.620 --> 01:39:44.820
So that's a correction on that one.

01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:47.700
In other news, Mighty Eat Number 9 is almost finished.

01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:52.260
And we had a message that came out from, uh, Inohune that said, happy new year, we're

01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:54.320
almost done.

01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:57.420
So get ready.

01:39:57.420 --> 01:40:02.380
And last but not least, um, there's another character in Tekken 7 who is not as controversial

01:40:02.380 --> 01:40:04.060
as Lucky Chloe.

01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:08.580
Um, his name is, uh, Shaheen.

01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:16.460
He is a Saudi Arabian soldier and, um, he actually was created based on feedback, um,

01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:22.300
from, uh, the game designer asking, what do you most want to see in the next Tekken game?

01:40:22.300 --> 01:40:25.860
And a lot of people said they wanted a Middle Eastern character.

01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:30.580
And I have to say, you know, he's got some of the stereotypical stuff on him, but he's,

01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:34.300
uh, actually pretty handsome, has a sword, looking pretty hardcore.

01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:38.380
I would, you know, honestly, it's not a fighting game unless you have a bunch of people that

01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:40.780
fill the tropes of different characters.

01:40:40.780 --> 01:40:42.380
I mean, who cares?

01:40:42.380 --> 01:40:43.380
It's a fighting game.

01:40:43.380 --> 01:40:44.380
Who stereotypes the game?

01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:49.340
You know, you're not, we can't talk realism about, you know, a game that has a fighting

01:40:49.340 --> 01:40:55.020
bear in it or a game that has, you know, a wooden robot thing that you fight.

01:40:55.020 --> 01:40:56.020
I mean, it's just, come on.

01:40:56.020 --> 01:41:02.860
If Street Fighter can have a Turkish oil wrestler, then I think having a rather subdued and well-dressed

01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:06.900
stylish Saudi man is perfectly fine for Tekken 7.

01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:07.900
Absolutely.

01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:12.900
I think if you can have a Turkish oil wrestler, then you can have Lucky Chloe.

01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:13.900
Why not?

01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:16.180
I didn't have a problem with Lucky Chloe.

01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:20.540
I don't, I don't know why people, people, people just want to get mad to get mad.

01:41:20.540 --> 01:41:22.660
Like sometimes I think that's the purpose of Twitter.

01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:23.660
And don't get me wrong.

01:41:23.660 --> 01:41:25.540
Like I've had a lot of very positive interactions on Twitter.

01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:29.420
I met a lot of great people on Twitter, but sometimes I think like people just have Twitters.

01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:31.020
They can complain about something.

01:41:31.020 --> 01:41:34.300
And it's like, if there was nothing else going on in the world, it's just, I need to complain

01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:36.180
about something on fricking Twitter.

01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:37.180
And it's so easy.

01:41:37.180 --> 01:41:38.180
I'm on the internet.

01:41:38.180 --> 01:41:39.180
Yeah.

01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:40.180
I have to say something about this.

01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:41.180
I'm on the internet.

01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:42.180
Fuck you all.

01:41:42.180 --> 01:41:43.180
Oh my God.

01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:44.180
Listen to me be wrong.

01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:45.180
I don't care.

01:41:45.180 --> 01:41:46.180
Just listen.

01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:48.340
And it's so easy to tag people.

01:41:48.340 --> 01:41:52.940
Like it is so easy to tag like, you know, at Lady Gaga, you're fat.

01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:53.940
I hate you.

01:41:53.940 --> 01:41:55.940
And it's like, but she can like actually, I don't know.

01:41:55.940 --> 01:41:58.860
Why do you think I hardly spend any time on Twitter anymore?

01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:02.420
I'd rather be on Tumblr and just repost whole blogs and make fun of them.

01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:04.100
So you have my whole issue with Tumblr too.

01:42:04.100 --> 01:42:08.540
Lately Tumblr has just been Dragon Age romance, the blog.

01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:09.540
Yeah.

01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:10.940
All right.

01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:13.580
Let's get to the foogle question of the week.

01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:24.940
You take Facebook, you take Google Plus, you slam them together, you get foogle.

01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:30.140
Every week we ask our listeners that support us on social networks a question every week,

01:42:30.140 --> 01:42:34.860
which by the way, you may start to see us using social networking more outside of just

01:42:34.860 --> 01:42:35.860
Sunday.

01:42:35.860 --> 01:42:39.180
Um, you may have noticed a little experiment where I actually snuck a question in earlier

01:42:39.180 --> 01:42:41.220
in the week that I used in the intro of the show.

01:42:41.220 --> 01:42:45.300
Um, that might be a direction we start kind of going in more and more throughout the year.

01:42:45.300 --> 01:42:46.940
It's just something I'm experimenting with a little bit.

01:42:46.940 --> 01:42:49.260
So, uh, don't just follow us on Sunday.

01:42:49.260 --> 01:42:52.340
Keep an eye out because you might see more questions throughout the week as there's more

01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:53.340
gaming news.

01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:55.900
Like I would like to do something every day, but there's really just not been the news

01:42:55.900 --> 01:42:56.900
to necessitate it.

01:42:56.900 --> 01:43:00.620
But we'll be asking you guys about the big stories more frequently so we can get your

01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:04.660
comments on the show more frequently than just the section.

01:43:04.660 --> 01:43:08.540
But all that aside, we did ask in our official foogle question of the week this week, tonight

01:43:08.540 --> 01:43:11.140
we are making our 2015 predictions.

01:43:11.140 --> 01:43:14.140
So what are your 2015 gaming predictions?

01:43:14.140 --> 01:43:15.700
Maybe we'll use some of these on this list.

01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:16.700
Let's see.

01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:20.300
I read the Hayes says 2015 will be a great year with all the upcoming games.

01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:24.820
I predict more remakes and revivals, which is great because I missed out on stuff last

01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:25.820
gen.

01:43:25.820 --> 01:43:30.460
I also want old franchises with great ideas to come back, such as the spiritual revival

01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:31.940
of clock tower.

01:43:31.940 --> 01:43:35.780
Well, the good news for you is that, uh, that's a pretty safe bet.

01:43:35.780 --> 01:43:40.140
There's definitely going to be some more, uh, uh, remakes and revivals.

01:43:40.140 --> 01:43:42.540
I just hope final fantasy 12 is one of them.

01:43:42.540 --> 01:43:43.540
All right.

01:43:43.540 --> 01:43:47.300
Uh, rageinator says, this is a bit of a cop out answer, but I predict that I'll buy a

01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:49.460
shit ton of steam games.

01:43:49.460 --> 01:43:52.620
Also one of the safest predictions I've ever heard, but that's all right.

01:43:52.620 --> 01:43:57.800
I also like how often people use the word shit ton.

01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:01.060
As in a shit ton of smiling piles of poopy mote icons.

01:44:01.060 --> 01:44:03.820
Uh, Andy R says half life three will release.

01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:04.820
Haha.

01:44:04.860 --> 01:44:10.140
By the way, uh, Guillermo R says valve will quietly cancel steam machines.

01:44:10.140 --> 01:44:11.140
Ooh.

01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:15.660
Nintendo will announce a 2d Metroid co-developed by chair entertainment, as well as a Wemo

01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:18.220
enabled port of the infinity blade trilogy.

01:44:18.220 --> 01:44:22.780
Oh God, I think that's a real wild stab of the dark, but I hope you're fucking right.

01:44:22.780 --> 01:44:23.780
I really do.

01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:24.780
That would be amazing.

01:44:24.780 --> 01:44:27.460
Uh, Sony will stay quiet about the last guardian.

01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:28.460
That's a little more safe.

01:44:28.460 --> 01:44:34.700
Oculus rift will finally come out and no man's sky will be awesome in it.

01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:38.140
And fifth dream on Facebook says virtual reality will finally begin making its way into the

01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:41.380
mainstream near the end of the year and beginning of the next soon.

01:44:41.380 --> 01:44:46.740
It won't be a joke or thought of as a fad anymore and just become the way a lot of people

01:44:46.740 --> 01:44:47.740
game.

01:44:47.740 --> 01:44:51.540
As a by-product, there will be a reboot of the lawnmower movies, lawnmower man movie

01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:53.180
series in 2017.

01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:54.180
Okay.

01:44:54.180 --> 01:44:55.180
Maybe not.

01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:56.180
I hope so.

01:44:56.180 --> 01:44:57.340
No, I'm both of those.

01:44:57.340 --> 01:44:58.340
Yeah.

01:44:59.220 --> 01:45:03.660
I'm totally fine with the first part of the lawnmower man sequel was God damn terrible

01:45:03.660 --> 01:45:04.660
though.

01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:05.660
I mean, don't get me wrong.

01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:11.300
The lawnmower man, you know, his adventures through the mind's eye videos, um, was fantastic,

01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:16.860
but yeah, I could totally see a reboot of that make crazy and creepy.

01:45:16.860 --> 01:45:22.260
Uh, I'm, I am so curious to see what happens when things like Oculus rift and uh, you know,

01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:25.780
project Morpheus, whatever it ends up actually being called, you know, all these things come

01:45:25.780 --> 01:45:26.780
out.

01:45:26.780 --> 01:45:27.780
I'm, I'm very curious to see what happens.

01:45:28.220 --> 01:45:29.220
All right.

01:45:29.220 --> 01:45:34.020
Uh, act deft, uh, over on Google plus says, Loki's game gets finished.

01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:35.020
Seriously speaking though.

01:45:35.020 --> 01:45:38.340
I expect a major gaming company to go under this year.

01:45:38.340 --> 01:45:40.500
Sad, but maybe true.

01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:45.780
I'm sure there's at least two, like I, I imagine the sun will come out tomorrow.

01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:50.140
I think there's two big Japanese ones we're all looking at, but maybe we'll get into that

01:45:50.140 --> 01:45:52.500
in our official predictions here in a minute.

01:45:52.540 --> 01:45:58.140
Uh, redertainment says, and the answer is the Witcher three gets delayed again, pushing

01:45:58.140 --> 01:45:59.540
back the release to holiday.

01:45:59.540 --> 01:46:04.020
Ooh, that would be, uh, that would be pretty, uh, interesting if that happened, uh, price

01:46:04.020 --> 01:46:10.020
cut on the Wii U in time for holiday, no price cut on PS4 or Xbox one.

01:46:10.020 --> 01:46:17.620
I, I, did they really make good on the threat to up the price of Xbox one $50 again?

01:46:17.620 --> 01:46:21.620
Like did the price of Xbox one go back up by 50 bucks?

01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:25.140
I think that was, I don't, I don't think that was a smart decision on Microsoft's part,

01:46:25.140 --> 01:46:27.380
but anyway, maybe it, maybe it'll just be, I think it did.

01:46:27.380 --> 01:46:29.980
I can confirm.

01:46:29.980 --> 01:46:34.740
I think if, if they did make that $50 price drop permanent, which I can't believe they

01:46:34.740 --> 01:46:38.460
didn't, then Sony would be under a lot of pressure to match it.

01:46:38.460 --> 01:46:39.740
Um, but we'll see.

01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:40.740
I don't know.

01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:41.740
We'll see.

01:46:41.740 --> 01:46:43.220
Uh, it's, it's a, it's a fair prediction.

01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:46.940
And then, uh, redertainment says the last guardian is teased at E3, no release date

01:46:46.940 --> 01:46:50.980
or full trailer, just a short video with ominous music behind it.

01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:55.020
Mirrors Edge 2 gets a release date sometime in 2016.

01:46:55.020 --> 01:46:57.020
All right.

01:46:57.020 --> 01:47:00.340
Um, let's see, uh, there you go.

01:47:00.340 --> 01:47:04.140
Those are some of the answers from our Facebook and Google plus communities.

01:47:04.140 --> 01:47:08.780
We are really close to our list lists for tonight, but first we have a couple more stories

01:47:08.780 --> 01:47:09.780
for you guys.

01:47:09.780 --> 01:47:10.780
Loki.

01:47:10.780 --> 01:47:11.780
Yeah.

01:47:11.780 --> 01:47:17.960
It's still saying that $399.99 are, um, so I don't remember which bundle that was, but

01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:20.720
it doesn't look like that they've dropped it down.

01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:21.720
Eh, whatever.

01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:22.720
Okay.

01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:24.720
Uh, so let's see.

01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:30.240
So let's talk a little bit about, um, well, the Xbox one actually, ironically enough,

01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:34.220
that, um, and this is something that they've been working on for a while, especially after

01:47:34.220 --> 01:47:39.480
they decided, hey, you know what, we're not going to make the Kinect as, um, something

01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:41.440
that you need to have in the system.

01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:48.720
And because of that, um, they were freeing up the extra, um, CPU power that was, I guess,

01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:49.720
for that.

01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:55.840
So I can't remember how much they were saying, um, they're saying right now they've allowed

01:47:55.840 --> 01:48:01.520
developers access to 50 to 80% of the seventh processing core.

01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:08.600
And I'm seeing that this should increase the performance of, uh, titles compared to their

01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:09.640
PlayStation four counterparts.

01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:13.960
Because you may remember there's been quite a disparaging, uh, difference between some

01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:18.460
of these, you know, titles on Xbox one, not running as high of a resolution as the ones

01:48:18.460 --> 01:48:22.520
on PlayStation four or lower frame rate or something to that effect.

01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:26.960
I mean, if that's a big deal for you, then I don't know.

01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:29.240
I guess this is cool that they're going to have the extra stuff.

01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:34.720
And then also, um, I know at some point they're supposed to be adopting, was it a DirectX

01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:41.680
12, was that, I think, I don't know, that's supposed to be pushing, uh, visuals up as

01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:42.680
well.

01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:47.520
And, um, so let's allow them to do a little bit more with the system and also on PC.

01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:48.520
All right.

01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:52.380
Well, uh, you know, we were talking a minute ago about the Wii U and the types of things

01:48:52.380 --> 01:48:57.180
we might see this year, but, uh, it looks like Mario, a 3d Mario title will not be among

01:48:57.180 --> 01:48:59.240
the offerings on the Wii U this year.

01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:04.480
Uh, this was confirmed by Nintendo of America's Bill Trennan, who said in an interview and

01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:07.640
the interview was, whoa, the interview, sorry, my keyboard tray just broke.

01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:08.640
That was scary.

01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:12.680
Uh, uh, he said in this interview that the, uh, company does not have a sequel to super

01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:15.000
Mario 3d world plan for release this year.

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:19.880
So that's not going to be on the 3ds or the Wii U, uh, but of course there is Mario maker

01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:25.560
coming on the Wii, uh, Wii U, excuse me, and Mario party 10, uh, the exact quote, Mario

01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:28.440
games release more frequently, but we don't have a new Mario game this year.

01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:29.920
So it's not an annual event.

01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:33.680
The teams focus on how they can recreate the gameplay experience or introduce new ideas

01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:37.240
to those games, which is what they did with NES remix, for example.

01:49:37.240 --> 01:49:38.240
So there you go.

01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:41.760
And you know, with the Zelda game coming out this year, I think that's where the focus

01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:42.760
is.

01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:46.120
So I'm not too shocked to hear there's not a mainline Mario game coming out.

01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:51.200
However, what I want to know is, does this also rule out Mario galaxy?

01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:55.880
Because I would think that that is the series that really needs another game.

01:49:55.880 --> 01:50:01.000
And I think that a lot of people want to see on Wii U or is that the 2016 plan?

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.360
I don't know, but I would think a Mario galaxy game would be a good one.

01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:06.960
I don't think they're going to have another Mario game next year, just because they've

01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:09.120
got a Zelda game coming out of the beach.

01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:10.600
I think that they would be kind of...

01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:12.240
But that would also be a power Christmas.

01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:15.040
Yeah, it would be, but then what do you bring for next year?

01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:16.040
That's the problem.

01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:20.080
It's like, so they got to space it out so that they have one, you know, core franchise

01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:24.720
title that, you know, it's a Mario or Zelda title that's really going to bring in, you

01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:28.640
know, people interests in the console that may not have the console already.

01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:33.680
So I don't think, I mean, cause honestly, like, you know, when they were pitching Pikmin

01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:36.520
three or whatever, it's just not a system seller.

01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:40.240
Some people like that game, but it's not something like, Oh my God, I got to get a Wii U for

01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:41.240
that.

01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:42.240
You know, I don't know.

01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:46.520
I just think that we'll have to see what else that they have beyond Zelda.

01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:48.240
Star Fox is definitely a positive.

01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:49.240
So I mean, that'll help.

01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:50.240
Yeah.

01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:51.240
We're not hearing a lot about that.

01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:55.880
I think I would be willing to, I could see Star Fox being delayed to next year, but I

01:50:55.880 --> 01:50:56.880
don't know.

01:50:56.880 --> 01:50:57.880
We'll see.

01:50:58.120 --> 01:50:59.720
I think they're going to have to have some spring titles.

01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:02.400
I mean, there's Mario maker and I would hope Star Fox is in there too.

01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:05.360
Maybe there'll be a direct or something that gives more information.

01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:09.360
Maybe Star Fox is like that summer title, like the June type of release.

01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:10.360
At least I hope so.

01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:11.360
I hope so.

01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:15.040
I think there's a lot of us that are really, uh, you know, we're, we're hoping for Nintendo

01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:19.120
and you know, they had a really good year this year and, um, you know, if they can keep

01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:23.980
that inertia going in the face of increasing competition from the Sony and Microsoft exclusives

01:51:23.980 --> 01:51:27.600
that start dropping next year, cause there's going to be some big ones between, you know,

01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:31.440
Halo five is obviously going to be Microsoft's big thing next year.

01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:35.000
Uh, Sony's got uncharted four and you know, these other things that they were pitching

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.440
at their own conference.

01:51:36.440 --> 01:51:42.640
Um, I, I, uh, I, I, I really cheering for Nintendo and I hope they can, uh, hope they

01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:43.640
can pull through.

01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:44.640
All right.

01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:49.800
Well, we're making a lot of bold predictions right now, so let's make some more in a segment

01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:51.600
we call listless.

01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:58.440
I hope y'all know this game by now cause we just played it two weeks ago to do the

01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:02.080
VOG jam theme, but here's the way listless works.

01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:07.720
We are going to create a list with our hosts here in studio and joining us tonight for

01:52:07.720 --> 01:52:09.040
the 2015 predictions.

01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:14.000
You guys really got a kick out of his predictions last year, so he is back joining us a special

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.000
tonight.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Say hello to Alan.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:17.000
Hello.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Hi Alan.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:19.000
How are you?

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:20.000
I'm good.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:21.000
How's dragon age going?

01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:22.400
Good.

01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:23.400
Can you chat?

01:52:23.400 --> 01:52:24.400
Hear me okay?

01:52:24.400 --> 01:52:25.400
All right.

01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:31.560
Um, I'm, I just started the legacy DLC for dragon age two, which for inquisition is very

01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:32.560
important.

01:52:32.560 --> 01:52:33.560
Oh, okay.

01:52:33.560 --> 01:52:34.560
No spoilers.

01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:35.560
OMG spoilers.

01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:36.560
Okay.

01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:37.560
OMG.

01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:39.920
Uh, what, anything else of gaming that you want to point out that you've been up to lately?

01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:42.480
Diablo three forever.

01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:44.680
You broke paragon 120 now, right?

01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:50.240
130 and I'm doing torment five, but not very well.

01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:51.240
It's a struggle.

01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:52.240
It's a struggle.

01:52:52.240 --> 01:52:53.240
It's a struggle.

01:52:53.240 --> 01:52:54.240
The struggle is real.

01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:55.240
Uh, what else?

01:52:55.240 --> 01:52:57.960
Any, any used to cohost a podcast and all that fun, so you're not doing anything like

01:52:57.960 --> 01:52:58.960
that right now.

01:52:58.960 --> 01:52:59.960
No projects for people to follow.

01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:00.960
No.

01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:01.960
Just your sassy tweets.

01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:02.960
Yes.

01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:03.960
All right.

01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:04.960
That works.

01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:05.960
That works.

01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:06.960
All right.

01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:07.960
Well, Alan's going to be joining us with his predictions tonight.

01:53:07.960 --> 01:53:09.720
Um, sadly, Jason was with us last year, but he's on the road driving back today.

01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:14.320
Uh, so I'll be curious to see what, uh, cause he, he was the most accurate last year.

01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:17.200
So it'll be a hoot and a holler and let the list turns out this year.

01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:18.200
So, um, okay.

01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:22.120
Anyway, let's get back to the music here while I explain the way listless works.

01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:23.120
All right.

01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:27.080
So we are going to build a list and the way that we are going to build the list is each

01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:31.380
host, uh, and Alan, our, our special cohost tonight, we'll go around and give their top

01:53:31.380 --> 01:53:32.600
three answers.

01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:36.800
Then the difficult round comes where we each eliminate one answer from the list that will

01:53:36.800 --> 01:53:41.920
leave a list of eight that you, the listeners, the live chatters, the live folks can vote

01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:47.940
on in our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:50.660
You must be logged into the site to see it.

01:53:50.660 --> 01:53:54.500
If you're not logged in, you will not see a pop up right under the chat, but we're going

01:53:54.500 --> 01:53:56.340
to put up the board right now.

01:53:56.340 --> 01:54:01.740
What is the official OLR quote 2015 in video gaming prediction?

01:54:01.740 --> 01:54:03.340
So we did it last year and it was a lot of fun.

01:54:03.340 --> 01:54:05.620
So we're going to do it again right now.

01:54:05.620 --> 01:54:09.380
Um, okay, so here we go.

01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:10.660
We're going to go around and build this list.

01:54:10.660 --> 01:54:12.100
I do want to warn you guys in advance.

01:54:12.100 --> 01:54:17.940
If you're expecting some very hardcore, serious, very, very Michael patcher analyst, serious

01:54:17.940 --> 01:54:22.800
predictions, you're listening to the wrong show.

01:54:22.800 --> 01:54:26.740
Our predictions tend to be a little bit tongue in cheek.

01:54:26.740 --> 01:54:28.780
So take with that.

01:54:28.780 --> 01:54:29.780
What do you know?

01:54:29.780 --> 01:54:33.380
If you firmly put your tongue into your cheek, it looks like you're sucking on something

01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:34.380
like what?

01:54:34.380 --> 01:54:35.380
A lollipop.

01:54:35.380 --> 01:54:36.380
Cookie.

01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:37.380
Okay.

01:54:37.380 --> 01:54:38.380
Jawbreaker.

01:54:38.380 --> 01:54:39.380
Okay.

01:54:39.380 --> 01:54:40.380
We're going to start tonight with Loki.

01:54:40.660 --> 01:54:44.540
If please, if you have predictions, you think are worthy of the list, put them in the chat

01:54:44.540 --> 01:54:45.540
room.

01:54:45.540 --> 01:54:48.980
Uh, we also have the predictions that came in VR frugal question of the week earlier.

01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:53.220
Uh, usually if a host gets an answer stolen, which happens sometimes two people think the

01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:54.220
same thing.

01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:59.340
We'll turn to our chat room and so forth to help us fill in, uh, those extra spots.

01:54:59.340 --> 01:55:01.020
So, uh, here we go.

01:55:01.020 --> 01:55:04.180
And SSJ 100, Matt telling people, if you don't have a vog account, you can register in like

01:55:04.180 --> 01:55:06.100
five seconds, then you can vote on the list list.

01:55:06.100 --> 01:55:07.100
That's absolutely right.

01:55:07.100 --> 01:55:08.100
All right.

01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:09.100
We're gonna start with Loki tonight.

01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:14.500
What is your number three answer for the official OLR 2015 and video gaming prediction?

01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:19.420
Oh, it's unfortunate, but my game won't be out next year or this year.

01:55:19.420 --> 01:55:23.460
I mean, yeah, it's 2015.

01:55:23.460 --> 01:55:30.180
Rob just wheezed, I just wheezed because I love the, this is basically his, his way of

01:55:30.180 --> 01:55:32.220
announcing he's already delayed his game.

01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:33.220
No, I haven't.

01:55:33.220 --> 01:55:35.820
I'm just like, I'm, I'm being realistic here.

01:55:35.820 --> 01:55:40.020
You know, I hope that I'm wrong and I hope I can prove myself wrong, but I just don't

01:55:40.020 --> 01:55:41.660
think it's going on his wall.

01:55:41.660 --> 01:55:45.500
He has a big banner that says the mentor and it's Gabe Newell and he kisses his fingers

01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:48.420
and presses it to his lips and says, no game this year.

01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:52.700
I'm doing it for you.

01:55:52.700 --> 01:56:04.580
Loki's game gets delayed kissing his Gavin, uh, scroll going, I learned from you pop up.

01:56:04.740 --> 01:56:06.940
Don't listen to the, what the rest of them say.

01:56:06.940 --> 01:56:07.940
It's our time.

01:56:07.940 --> 01:56:08.940
Okay.

01:56:08.940 --> 01:56:10.680
We weren't, we were working on this in our time.

01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:12.420
Just bring me another say me time.

01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:13.420
Bring me another sale.

01:56:13.420 --> 01:56:15.460
Big pop me time valve time.

01:56:15.460 --> 01:56:17.460
All right.

01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:20.000
I will go next with my number three answer.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:24.660
My number three answer on the list will be, okay, look, this is the thing that nobody

01:56:24.660 --> 01:56:30.640
wants to hear, but we had an answer similar to this earlier that some company is going

01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:33.020
to go under this next year.

01:56:33.020 --> 01:56:38.060
And as much as you guys don't want to hear it, my answer is Konami gets bought.

01:56:38.060 --> 01:56:39.060
That's right.

01:56:39.060 --> 01:56:42.100
Konami, who we have to thank probably for this show's existence.

01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:45.340
I'm going out on the line and saying, Konami gets bought.

01:56:45.340 --> 01:56:49.660
Look, I know they have a big casino business and all this other stuff that they're making

01:56:49.660 --> 01:56:54.220
money from now, but let's be real, Konami ain't quite in the same shape that it was

01:56:54.220 --> 01:56:55.220
before.

01:56:55.220 --> 01:56:58.980
So, uh, I'm, I'm going to be so bold as to say, Konami gets bought.

01:56:58.980 --> 01:57:02.700
They get bought by Capcom and then they can be mediocre together.

01:57:02.700 --> 01:57:07.860
Just I'm just, I'm just, I'm just being a salt snake and street fighter.

01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:08.860
I'm down with that.

01:57:08.860 --> 01:57:09.860
That's right.

01:57:09.860 --> 01:57:10.860
That's right.

01:57:10.860 --> 01:57:11.940
Street fighter versus metal gear.

01:57:11.940 --> 01:57:12.940
Let's hear it.

01:57:12.940 --> 01:57:13.940
Let's hear.

01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:14.940
All right.

01:57:14.940 --> 01:57:15.940
Konami gets bought.

01:57:15.940 --> 01:57:16.940
I'm putting that up on the board.

01:57:16.940 --> 01:57:17.940
All right.

01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:18.940
Dark Sakura, you're up next.

01:57:18.940 --> 01:57:19.940
What is your number three?

01:57:19.940 --> 01:57:28.020
The black Wolf in chat says like Capcom can afford.

01:57:28.020 --> 01:57:32.540
I would love to see yacht club games by Capcom or, or what's the company making mighty number

01:57:32.540 --> 01:57:33.540
nine.

01:57:33.540 --> 01:57:34.540
All right.

01:57:34.540 --> 01:57:35.540
Anyway, I'm all laughing aside.

01:57:35.540 --> 01:57:38.200
Dark Sakura, what is your number three answer?

01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:42.780
Mind controlled game as in, well, they've got the technology now to where they can use

01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:49.500
nerve, uh, your nerves to control like, you know, external lens and prosthetics and everything.

01:57:49.500 --> 01:57:54.020
And they're working on, um, you know, wiring the brain where, you know, they're, they can

01:57:54.020 --> 01:57:56.500
give vision to people who are blind.

01:57:56.500 --> 01:58:01.300
It just seems to me that it's probably not going to happen, but I think sometime in the

01:58:01.300 --> 01:58:05.440
future, we're going to have that technology to where someone can use their nerve impulses

01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:07.740
or something to control a figure in a game.

01:58:07.740 --> 01:58:13.260
So maybe we'll say, um, could we go so far as to say consumer mind control game?

01:58:13.260 --> 01:58:14.260
Possibly.

01:58:14.260 --> 01:58:15.260
Okay.

01:58:15.260 --> 01:58:17.180
I'm going to just put that on there because I think some might argue that that game already

01:58:17.180 --> 01:58:20.260
exists in these very, like kind of what you were saying there.

01:58:20.260 --> 01:58:24.340
So I think if we say consumer mind control game, then we can definitely say this doesn't

01:58:24.340 --> 01:58:26.300
exist yet, but may later.

01:58:26.300 --> 01:58:27.300
May later.

01:58:27.300 --> 01:58:28.300
All right.

01:58:28.300 --> 01:58:29.540
Uh, let's see.

01:58:29.540 --> 01:58:31.460
Going to our list here.

01:58:31.460 --> 01:58:33.420
So far, we got Loki's game gets delayed.

01:58:33.420 --> 01:58:36.020
Konami gets bought and consumer mind controlled game.

01:58:36.020 --> 01:58:37.020
Thank you.

01:58:37.020 --> 01:58:38.020
Chat rooms.

01:58:38.020 --> 01:58:39.020
Comcept.

01:58:39.020 --> 01:58:40.020
That's what I was thinking of.

01:58:40.020 --> 01:58:41.020
Comcept.

01:58:41.020 --> 01:58:42.020
Comcept will buy them both.

01:58:42.020 --> 01:58:43.020
They'll overtake the earth.

01:58:43.020 --> 01:58:44.020
Alan alchemy.

01:58:44.020 --> 01:58:45.020
We are to you now.

01:58:45.020 --> 01:58:46.700
Last year, your number three answer was a bit of a shocker.

01:58:46.700 --> 01:58:49.100
So I'm, I'm very curious what you have in store for us this year.

01:58:49.100 --> 01:58:51.740
I have one grim, serious one.

01:58:51.740 --> 01:58:52.740
Okay.

01:58:53.220 --> 01:58:55.660
I have backups now that it's going to come later.

01:58:55.660 --> 01:58:56.940
I do have backups.

01:58:56.940 --> 01:59:00.860
Most of them are too safe.

01:59:00.860 --> 01:59:02.140
So that's kind of the mood I'm in.

01:59:02.140 --> 01:59:03.140
All right.

01:59:03.140 --> 01:59:07.500
Um, let's see.

01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:14.900
Yet another three D S Q and enhancement of the two DS and enhancement or a smaller version

01:59:14.900 --> 01:59:18.480
of the one that came out that has the removable face plates.

01:59:18.480 --> 01:59:21.940
They're going to redo that before the year is up and may not be out, but it'll be announced.

01:59:21.940 --> 01:59:24.420
I think they should make a transformer three DS.

01:59:24.420 --> 01:59:26.340
That's both a three DS and a two DS.

01:59:26.340 --> 01:59:27.580
There you go.

01:59:27.580 --> 01:59:28.820
And the new three DS doesn't count.

01:59:28.820 --> 01:59:31.020
I was going to say, isn't the new three DS already?

01:59:31.020 --> 01:59:32.020
No, it doesn't count.

01:59:32.020 --> 01:59:33.100
It's out in Japan.

01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:37.340
So I'm including that one with the second thumb stick and the, and the customized little.

01:59:37.340 --> 01:59:40.420
So if they release that in the U S it doesn't count because it's all right, but they need

01:59:40.420 --> 01:59:43.000
to announce in Japan.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:44.420
Another one, yet another something else.

01:59:44.420 --> 01:59:48.580
Yet another three DS skew, no four DS predictions.

01:59:48.580 --> 01:59:51.140
It will bend time.

01:59:51.140 --> 01:59:54.700
All right.

01:59:54.700 --> 01:59:56.040
It has three screens.

01:59:56.040 --> 01:59:57.040
You guys has three.

01:59:57.040 --> 01:59:58.040
All right.

01:59:58.040 --> 01:59:59.580
So our list so far, Loki's game gets delayed.

01:59:59.580 --> 02:00:03.940
Konami gets bought consumer mind controlled game and yet another three DS skew.

02:00:03.940 --> 02:00:05.940
All right.

02:00:05.940 --> 02:00:07.300
Let's go to the number two answers.

02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:10.440
Loki, what are you gonna put on the list?

02:00:10.440 --> 02:00:13.820
This is so not going to happen next year, but I'm just going to throw it out there anyways

02:00:13.820 --> 02:00:18.460
because I would, you know, was ill prepared and didn't prepare beforehand.

02:00:18.460 --> 02:00:22.940
But I'm just going to make a bold announcement that, uh, Microsoft is going to announce,

02:00:22.940 --> 02:00:24.480
Hey, you know what?

02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:30.540
Now is the time for Minecraft two electric boogaloo.

02:00:30.540 --> 02:00:33.460
I almost put that on my list.

02:00:33.460 --> 02:00:36.940
Uh, Microsoft says they go all in and they say Minecraft two.

02:00:36.940 --> 02:00:37.940
Yeah.

02:00:37.940 --> 02:00:38.940
E three.

02:00:38.940 --> 02:00:43.620
I think, I think it's even so bold as to announce it at E3 Minecraft two and they bring out

02:00:43.620 --> 02:00:48.660
some hoity-toity developer who's working on it, who took over for the guy who just bought

02:00:48.660 --> 02:00:53.500
Beyonce's mission.

02:00:53.500 --> 02:01:02.700
They have Lars Von Trier is the artistic director for Minecraft two.

02:01:02.700 --> 02:01:08.300
It's really badly lit and nobody's wearing makeup and the blocks of despair won't stop

02:01:08.300 --> 02:01:09.300
crying

02:01:09.300 --> 02:01:15.700
Wow.

02:01:15.700 --> 02:01:18.900
Lars Von Trier is Minecraft two.

02:01:18.900 --> 02:01:19.900
I love it.

02:01:19.900 --> 02:01:20.900
All right.

02:01:20.900 --> 02:01:21.900
Uh, there it is.

02:01:21.900 --> 02:01:22.900
It's on the list.

02:01:22.900 --> 02:01:24.220
Let's go to the next answer.

02:01:24.220 --> 02:01:28.140
See, the sad thing is half our chatters probably don't even understand how funny that really

02:01:28.140 --> 02:01:29.140
is when he just did.

02:01:29.140 --> 02:01:30.140
All right.

02:01:30.140 --> 02:01:32.460
Anyway, but for the half to do that to do all right.

02:01:32.460 --> 02:01:38.580
My number two answer, you know what this we've seen in the past year that third party support

02:01:38.580 --> 02:01:40.660
has really been hurting the Wii U.

02:01:40.660 --> 02:01:46.660
And so what I'm going to say is going to happen in 2015 EA is going to buckle under the pressure

02:01:46.660 --> 02:01:51.860
of the society and the tweets and all that stuff EA is going to release a Wii U game

02:01:51.860 --> 02:02:04.000
and it tanks EA releases a Wii U game finally and it tanks, but not counting all the stuff

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:05.000
they've already released.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:08.380
I realized they had like four in the window, but let's be real.

02:02:08.380 --> 02:02:14.500
So by definition, they would be releasing a third party game on the Wii U, so that would

02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:16.140
tank anyways by default.

02:02:16.140 --> 02:02:17.140
Oh, stop.

02:02:17.140 --> 02:02:21.340
I know that their Wii U version of mass effect three is the definitive one.

02:02:21.340 --> 02:02:24.060
It's the best one out there.

02:02:24.060 --> 02:02:25.260
I own it.

02:02:25.260 --> 02:02:26.260
I own it.

02:02:26.260 --> 02:02:27.260
All right.

02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:28.260
Uh, it's just the comic.

02:02:28.260 --> 02:02:31.020
The pro they should have just put out the goddamn trilogy and the no DLC and then a

02:02:31.020 --> 02:02:32.020
multiplayer.

02:02:32.020 --> 02:02:34.060
They had just put out the goddamn trilogy on Wii U.

02:02:34.060 --> 02:02:36.620
It would have been fine because then it would have been the same price.

02:02:36.620 --> 02:02:41.620
It wasn't anyway, nerd rage, dark soccer.

02:02:41.620 --> 02:02:43.300
What's your number two answer.

02:02:43.300 --> 02:02:49.800
We have an entire year full of, uh, dragon age inquisition DLC that includes something

02:02:49.800 --> 02:02:54.100
that was much like Citadel for mass effect.

02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:58.820
I personally am looking forward to the egg hunt DLC and I'm not going to spoil anything

02:02:58.820 --> 02:02:59.820
from that.

02:02:59.820 --> 02:03:00.820
All right.

02:03:00.820 --> 02:03:04.980
A year full of dragon age inquisition DLC.

02:03:04.980 --> 02:03:08.500
Talk about a safe answer.

02:03:08.500 --> 02:03:10.060
BioWare DLC.

02:03:10.060 --> 02:03:11.060
Get out, get out.

02:03:11.060 --> 02:03:12.060
All right.

02:03:12.060 --> 02:03:15.460
The thing is that they had said that they weren't going to be able to do DLC for frostbite

02:03:15.460 --> 02:03:16.460
or something.

02:03:16.460 --> 02:03:18.420
I think they're going to figure it out.

02:03:18.420 --> 02:03:19.420
Oh, it's a miracle.

02:03:19.420 --> 02:03:21.340
They already said, oh, it can't be modded.

02:03:21.340 --> 02:03:22.820
Yeah, I can.

02:03:22.820 --> 02:03:23.820
People are already doing it.

02:03:23.820 --> 02:03:24.820
It's a miracle.

02:03:24.820 --> 02:03:25.820
Okay.

02:03:25.820 --> 02:03:27.920
I see where your answer comes from because they've gone on record saying they're not

02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:28.920
going to do it.

02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:29.920
Then they're going to come back and say JK.

02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:31.740
And what's the first character mod that came out?

02:03:31.740 --> 02:03:39.020
A softer Cassandra with makeup and without her scar because dude, bros are gross.

02:03:39.020 --> 02:03:40.500
Do we have nudie mods yet?

02:03:40.500 --> 02:03:41.500
No.

02:03:41.500 --> 02:03:45.420
Someone's trying to do one for solace to make him look like his original concept where he

02:03:45.420 --> 02:03:46.420
had the black dreads.

02:03:46.420 --> 02:03:53.300
Actually, there is, um, if, if a NPC that you can romance has a tasteful sex scene where

02:03:53.300 --> 02:03:57.020
it shows them like you get to see Dorian's butt, sorry for spoilers.

02:03:57.020 --> 02:04:00.980
People have found a way to take that skin and force it over his clothes in the real

02:04:00.980 --> 02:04:01.980
game.

02:04:01.980 --> 02:04:04.940
And there's also the fly cam is available now.

02:04:04.940 --> 02:04:08.260
I mean, the, which basically you can see the dudes have no junk.

02:04:08.260 --> 02:04:09.260
That's it.

02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:10.260
All right.

02:04:10.260 --> 02:04:13.020
Well, uh, Alan, it's time for your number two choice.

02:04:13.020 --> 02:04:16.140
What is your number two 2015 gaming prediction?

02:04:16.140 --> 02:04:23.560
Punishing abject silence from valve on anything except financials.

02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:27.940
No controller, no DLC for Dota two, nothing.

02:04:27.940 --> 02:04:29.660
No steam machines.

02:04:29.660 --> 02:04:32.500
You're going to go with the guy who says the steam machines don't happen, but they could

02:04:32.500 --> 02:04:35.580
have updates on a team fortress too.

02:04:35.580 --> 02:04:41.980
Well, yeah, I mean, but as far as like a, like an, uh, an announcement as to like no

02:04:41.980 --> 02:04:47.180
fucking three that's or, or, well, yeah, but also no left for dead three, no source to

02:04:47.180 --> 02:04:52.860
no can no new controller yet another year of Jack and shit from, from valve aside from

02:04:52.860 --> 02:04:55.300
our steam store made a lot of money.

02:04:55.300 --> 02:04:56.300
That's it.

02:04:56.300 --> 02:04:57.300
That's all we're getting.

02:04:57.300 --> 02:04:58.700
All right.

02:04:58.740 --> 02:04:59.740
Fair enough.

02:04:59.740 --> 02:05:00.740
Fair enough.

02:05:00.740 --> 02:05:01.740
All right.

02:05:01.740 --> 02:05:06.660
Let's get now to the number one answers, hopefully going to be a little more, a little more out

02:05:06.660 --> 02:05:07.660
of the safe zone.

02:05:07.660 --> 02:05:08.660
We'll see.

02:05:08.660 --> 02:05:09.660
We'll see.

02:05:09.660 --> 02:05:10.660
All right.

02:05:10.660 --> 02:05:11.660
Loki, one more item for the board.

02:05:11.660 --> 02:05:12.660
What is it going to be for you?

02:05:12.660 --> 02:05:13.660
Since we've already heard the rumors.

02:05:13.660 --> 02:05:16.380
I'm just going to go with it anyways, that there will be a new console that will enter

02:05:16.380 --> 02:05:19.540
the market to compete with the other consoles.

02:05:19.540 --> 02:05:20.540
From a new company?

02:05:20.540 --> 02:05:21.540
From another company.

02:05:21.540 --> 02:05:22.540
Yes.

02:05:22.540 --> 02:05:26.260
So, but you're not talking something like Ouya, you're talking something like big from

02:05:26.260 --> 02:05:31.700
like Samsung or somebody enters in a big way with a console on the level of PlayStation

02:05:31.700 --> 02:05:32.700
four, Xbox one.

02:05:32.700 --> 02:05:33.700
All right.

02:05:33.700 --> 02:05:34.700
Fair enough.

02:05:34.700 --> 02:05:35.700
That's a bold prediction.

02:05:35.700 --> 02:05:36.700
Sure is.

02:05:36.700 --> 02:05:39.260
I mean, that, that may be their intention.

02:05:39.260 --> 02:05:43.480
Will it go the way you do you ever maybe, but there will be someone that will at least

02:05:43.480 --> 02:05:44.480
make the attempt.

02:05:44.480 --> 02:05:46.180
All right.

02:05:46.180 --> 02:05:51.260
My number one answer is going to be, uh, you know, and some of you may say that's never

02:05:51.260 --> 02:05:53.140
going to happen and that might be true.

02:05:53.140 --> 02:05:57.060
So maybe this one is just wishful thinking a little bit, but not my number one answer

02:05:57.060 --> 02:06:02.500
is one of those DDOS brats gets the death penalty.

02:06:02.500 --> 02:06:03.500
That's my number one answer.

02:06:03.500 --> 02:06:04.500
That's a little much.

02:06:04.500 --> 02:06:09.600
I'm not saying, I didn't say it was because of the DDOS thing.

02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:11.620
I just said, they're going to get the death penalty.

02:06:11.620 --> 02:06:13.840
We're setting an example of this guy.

02:06:13.840 --> 02:06:17.420
So there it is set an example.

02:06:17.420 --> 02:06:18.420
So there it is.

02:06:18.420 --> 02:06:20.380
One of the DDOS brats gets the death penalty.

02:06:20.380 --> 02:06:21.380
That's my number one.

02:06:21.380 --> 02:06:26.580
We already have a precedent of a hacker getting, um, more punishment than the crimes that they

02:06:26.580 --> 02:06:27.580
exposed in the hack.

02:06:27.580 --> 02:06:32.180
And to, and to, and to elaborate also, and when I said, yes, it will not be just another

02:06:32.180 --> 02:06:33.180
Android console.

02:06:33.180 --> 02:06:36.620
It will be a console console, not an Android console.

02:06:36.620 --> 02:06:37.620
All right.

02:06:37.620 --> 02:06:38.620
Fair enough.

02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:41.560
And again, I'm not saying they got the death penalty because of the DDOS.

02:06:41.560 --> 02:06:46.460
It's just, you know, how long until someone dies over the shit is all I'm saying.

02:06:46.460 --> 02:06:49.220
How long, how long?

02:06:49.220 --> 02:06:52.260
Bonds 006 says, wow, Rob, a bit harsh there.

02:06:52.260 --> 02:06:53.260
Nope.

02:06:53.260 --> 02:06:54.260
Nope.

02:06:54.260 --> 02:07:02.260
How dare you take away my PlayStation during Christmas.

02:07:02.260 --> 02:07:04.660
But maybe, maybe they just happened to murder somebody too.

02:07:04.660 --> 02:07:06.640
I mean, they already have a record of crime.

02:07:06.640 --> 02:07:11.380
Now I just picture you as a Mrs. White.

02:07:11.380 --> 02:07:13.980
I hated them so much.

02:07:13.980 --> 02:07:17.100
Flames on the side of my face.

02:07:17.100 --> 02:07:24.460
Yes, because you know, it's, it's such a slippery slope, you know, uh, executing code to, you

02:07:24.460 --> 02:07:32.140
know, use a system, you know, a, a bunch of, um, you know, computers to flood a site and

02:07:32.140 --> 02:07:33.140
murder.

02:07:33.140 --> 02:07:34.140
Yeah.

02:07:34.140 --> 02:07:38.420
It's pretty similar, pushy pixels and chat saying, remind me not to pirate anything around

02:07:38.420 --> 02:07:39.420
to Rob.

02:07:39.420 --> 02:07:43.780
And fifth dream says we get to punch you once for every request you sent the server.

02:07:43.780 --> 02:07:45.340
I love that idea.

02:07:45.340 --> 02:07:48.900
Punch them in the Dick one time for every request that they sent to the server.

02:07:48.900 --> 02:07:49.900
You know what?

02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:55.060
They could be, they could be genetically female, uh, then punched them in the hoo-ha once every

02:07:55.060 --> 02:07:56.060
time.

02:07:56.060 --> 02:07:59.060
Ha, we didn't send a request to the server.

02:07:59.060 --> 02:08:00.060
Other computers did.

02:08:00.060 --> 02:08:05.660
So ha, no Dick punches for me, genital punching, genital punching for everybody.

02:08:05.660 --> 02:08:09.780
That was the name of my band in high school.

02:08:09.780 --> 02:08:15.620
I don't really like this new punch out game from Nintendo.

02:08:15.620 --> 02:08:18.220
We you presents little Mac gentle to punch.

02:08:18.220 --> 02:08:19.220
All right.

02:08:19.220 --> 02:08:22.740
Uh, dark Sakura, your number one answer.

02:08:22.740 --> 02:08:28.780
Mass Effect four will be surprisingly good and still piss people off because it won't

02:08:28.780 --> 02:08:29.780
be out next year.

02:08:29.780 --> 02:08:30.780
Hold on.

02:08:30.780 --> 02:08:32.140
I'm writing that down.

02:08:32.140 --> 02:08:33.140
Mass Effect four is good.

02:08:33.140 --> 02:08:35.220
It will still piss people off.

02:08:35.220 --> 02:08:36.220
Yes.

02:08:36.220 --> 02:08:42.100
What a Jamie list we have here with dragon age and Mass Effect mind control and mind

02:08:42.100 --> 02:08:43.100
control.

02:08:43.100 --> 02:08:44.100
At least bizarre tech.

02:08:44.100 --> 02:08:45.100
All right.

02:08:45.100 --> 02:08:46.100
There it is.

02:08:46.100 --> 02:08:47.380
It's added there to the list.

02:08:47.380 --> 02:08:50.220
Alan alchemy, your number one answer.

02:08:50.220 --> 02:08:52.100
The very last entry on the list.

02:08:52.100 --> 02:08:56.460
I want an opportunity once the chat has voted at the end of the show to read off quickly

02:08:56.460 --> 02:08:57.980
mice throw away ones.

02:08:57.980 --> 02:08:58.980
Sure.

02:08:58.980 --> 02:08:59.980
Got some good stuff here.

02:08:59.980 --> 02:09:00.980
Sure.

02:09:00.980 --> 02:09:01.980
Should I do the grim serious one?

02:09:01.980 --> 02:09:02.980
Absolutely.

02:09:02.980 --> 02:09:03.980
All right.

02:09:03.980 --> 02:09:12.220
This year there will be, uh, within the industry lit litigation from a woman or women about

02:09:12.220 --> 02:09:13.220
a social issue.

02:09:13.220 --> 02:09:14.220
Oh no.

02:09:14.220 --> 02:09:15.220
What?

02:09:15.220 --> 02:09:18.380
Like an IGN reporter was like, Oh yeah, these dudes at such and such company said that if

02:09:18.380 --> 02:09:23.100
I gave them their phone number, they'd let me preview a game like actual, like it's going

02:09:23.100 --> 02:09:27.820
to come out and there will be damages over rewarded.

02:09:27.820 --> 02:09:29.300
Sorry.

02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:30.420
It's depressing how likely that is.

02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:33.220
If you don't want to, if you don't want to put it, I'll, I'll put it on the line.

02:09:33.460 --> 02:09:34.460
I'm fine with it.

02:09:34.460 --> 02:09:40.020
It's yeah, it's, uh, it's, it's as, as sick as the answer you put up last year.

02:09:40.020 --> 02:09:45.060
So actual journalism scandal over, uh, yeah.

02:09:45.060 --> 02:09:46.620
Over sex for secrets.

02:09:46.620 --> 02:09:51.460
Or it could be, um, like a racial thing or like gay thing, but just something.

02:09:51.460 --> 02:09:54.740
Or could I just say an actual ethics and journalism debate?

02:09:54.740 --> 02:10:01.800
Well, yeah, but my, my thing that makes it, my point is that it's at actual goes to litigation.

02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:06.400
Like there's an act where it's civic court, like someone is sued by a person or groups

02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:07.840
of people over an issue like this.

02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:08.840
Okay.

02:10:08.840 --> 02:10:13.000
So I'm going to say on the board, actual journey journalism scandal to litigation over sex

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:14.000
for secrets.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:15.000
Yes.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:16.000
All right.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:17.000
There it is.

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:18.000
It's up on the board.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:23.080
We can always rely on Alan to give us something depressing and humbling, uh, to ruin our new

02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:24.080
year.

02:10:24.080 --> 02:10:25.080
There it is.

02:10:25.080 --> 02:10:26.080
Thank you, Alan.

02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:27.280
Uh, here it is the list.

02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:29.840
Let's go through the answers that are on the list.

02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:32.560
And then we get to the eliminations.

02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:34.200
Loki's game gets delayed.

02:10:34.200 --> 02:10:37.200
Konami gets bought consumer mind controlled game.

02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:38.840
Yet another 3DS skew.

02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:44.480
Microsoft announces Minecraft to EA releases a Wii U game and a tanks a year full of dragon

02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:49.440
age inquisition DLC, punishing silence from valve on anything but financials new console

02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:50.740
that enters the market.

02:10:50.740 --> 02:10:53.200
One of these DDoS brats gets the death penalty.

02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:54.200
Mass Effect four is good.

02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:59.040
It will still piss people off and actual journalism scandal to litigation over sex

02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:00.040
for secrets.

02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:05.120
All right, here's the round that nobody likes, but it must be done as part of scientifically

02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:06.120
the process.

02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:10.640
Loki, since you were first, I'm starting with you tonight, which of these is not worthy

02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:11.640
of the list?

02:11:11.640 --> 02:11:12.640
I cannot be getting bought.

02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:13.640
They're not going to get bought.

02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:17.960
And because they have Metal Gear Solid five coming out and then they've also got silent

02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:21.520
Hills that probably will be out later this year.

02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:23.560
I'm pretty confident that they'll be fine.

02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:25.040
You and your fucking realism.

02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:26.040
All right.

02:11:26.040 --> 02:11:27.040
It is stricken from the list.

02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:32.120
Konami gets bought is stricken from the list of Capcom getting a lot of, a lot of chat

02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:35.000
room people, not a fan of that answer.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:38.680
So I think a lot of people very happy you eliminated that from the list.

02:11:38.680 --> 02:11:39.680
All right.

02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:40.680
Uh, I'm up next.

02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:42.760
Uh, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:11:42.760 --> 02:11:47.760
I am going to say, um, I, uh, sorry.

02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:52.800
Uh, no, no, I'm so close to taking one of yours off Jamie, but I'm actually going to

02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:55.120
go ahead and eliminate one of Loki's a revenge vote.

02:11:55.120 --> 02:11:58.840
I'm going to eliminate Loki's game gets delayed because he's not allowed to delay it.

02:11:58.840 --> 02:11:59.840
There it is.

02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:00.840
Now it's gone.

02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:01.840
It is stricken from the list.

02:12:01.840 --> 02:12:07.200
Well, now you can't, it's gone stricken from the list.

02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:11.760
Dark soccer gets by unscathed that I almost went for one of her answers, but I decided

02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:12.760
on that one.

02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:13.760
All right.

02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:14.760
My answers are great.

02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:15.760
All right.

02:12:15.760 --> 02:12:16.760
Dark soccer.

02:12:16.760 --> 02:12:17.760
Which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:21.840
Um, don't, don't hurt yourself.

02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:24.960
I make a career out of hurting myself over here.

02:12:24.960 --> 02:12:27.920
Um, get a workman's comp issue away.

02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:33.160
I'm going to say the EU releasing the game that tanks because people buy EU shit anyway.

02:12:33.160 --> 02:12:35.400
EA releasing a Wii U game that tanks.

02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:36.960
You are eliminating that from the list.

02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:37.960
Yeah.

02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:38.960
And sorry.

02:12:38.960 --> 02:12:41.560
I mean, that was the only one that really just, and there goes my list.

02:12:41.560 --> 02:12:43.280
They've done good.

02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:44.800
They've done games that haven't tanked.

02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:45.800
All right.

02:12:45.800 --> 02:12:46.800
All right.

02:12:46.800 --> 02:12:48.600
Well, I still think that was accurate, but whatever.

02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:53.440
This just means y'all just gave immunity to one of these DDoS brats gets the death penalty

02:12:53.440 --> 02:12:54.440
is now immune.

02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:55.440
I had a plan.

02:12:55.440 --> 02:12:56.440
I had a plan.

02:12:56.440 --> 02:13:01.040
So Alan may not remove that answer because no host may have their list completely eliminated.

02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:05.120
So Alan, that one aside, which of these is not worthy of the list?

02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:11.400
Hmm, I'm sorry.

02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:13.320
I'm reading, I'm reading out off the screen.

02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:15.920
I'm trying to pick between two.

02:13:15.920 --> 02:13:22.920
Uh, I am going to eliminate the mass effect for one just cause I don't think we're getting

02:13:22.920 --> 02:13:24.420
it this year.

02:13:24.420 --> 02:13:28.680
And of course people will have a problem with the content Bioware can't win for losing.

02:13:28.680 --> 02:13:30.020
So all right.

02:13:30.020 --> 02:13:33.120
So yeah, I got to admit that was 2016.

02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:36.160
I would say so because I think that's when we're really going to have assets to look

02:13:36.160 --> 02:13:38.160
at for Mass Effect.

02:13:38.160 --> 02:13:39.160
All right.

02:13:39.160 --> 02:13:40.160
Well, sorry, Jamie.

02:13:40.160 --> 02:13:41.160
Sorry, Jamie.

02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:42.160
But it's okay.

02:13:42.160 --> 02:13:43.580
Hey, at least you still have two answers on the board.

02:13:43.580 --> 02:13:44.580
I get one.

02:13:44.580 --> 02:13:48.620
But yours is, but your answer is honestly beautiful.

02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:49.620
It's a precious angel.

02:13:49.620 --> 02:13:50.620
It's a sweet snowflake.

02:13:50.620 --> 02:13:52.460
Well now don't influence the vote, Jamie.

02:13:52.460 --> 02:13:53.460
Don't influence the vote.

02:13:53.460 --> 02:13:54.460
All right.

02:13:54.460 --> 02:13:55.460
Here it is.

02:13:55.460 --> 02:13:56.460
Your list that is left to vote on.

02:13:56.460 --> 02:13:57.860
I was just petting your ego.

02:13:57.860 --> 02:13:58.860
And well, thank you.

02:13:58.860 --> 02:13:59.860
I appreciate that.

02:13:59.860 --> 02:14:00.860
That's always nice to have.

02:14:00.860 --> 02:14:01.860
Uh, here it is.

02:14:01.860 --> 02:14:06.160
The list of the answers you may vote on Microsoft announces Minecraft two new console enters

02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:07.160
the market.

02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:09.860
One of these DDoS brats gets the death penalty.

02:14:09.860 --> 02:14:14.180
Remember mind controlled game a year full of dragon age inquisition DLC yet another

02:14:14.180 --> 02:14:19.900
three DS skew punishing silence from valve on anything but financials and actual journalism

02:14:19.900 --> 02:14:22.620
scandal to litigation over sex for secrets.

02:14:22.620 --> 02:14:23.620
How did that one get by?

02:14:23.620 --> 02:14:24.620
Look at that.

02:14:24.620 --> 02:14:26.440
Alan's list because we expect it.

02:14:26.440 --> 02:14:32.860
The controversial always Alan alchemy is list escapes completely unscathed to look at that.

02:14:32.860 --> 02:14:33.860
So there it is.

02:14:33.860 --> 02:14:34.860
It is your turn to answer.

02:14:34.860 --> 02:14:38.680
You're going to click on your number one and then click on your number two.

02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:39.880
Those votes are weighted.

02:14:39.880 --> 02:14:43.720
So think carefully before clicking, you click on your number one and you click on your number

02:14:43.720 --> 02:14:47.320
two answer and then you're going to click answer at the bottom of the screen and that

02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:52.520
will submit the votes for the official tabulation and we will tabulate those votes and get the

02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:59.320
answer for the official OLR 2015 video gaming prediction after a little bit here on OLR.

02:14:59.320 --> 02:15:02.760
Um, Alan, I'm sure you're probably stepping out at this point to go play more games.

02:15:02.760 --> 02:15:06.000
Oh, you wanted to read some of your rejects.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.440
Should I do that now or should I do it after the voting?

02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:09.440
Why not?

02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:10.440
Hold on one sec.

02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:11.440
It's too late.

02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:13.880
The list, the top three is coming from these eight, so it's too late now.

02:15:13.880 --> 02:15:14.880
Okay.

02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:20.000
The only bummer is if one of these, uh, ends up, uh, uh, being better, but we'll see elder

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:24.680
scrolls online and wild star together become free to play a little bit too.

02:15:24.680 --> 02:15:26.000
That was on my list.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:27.000
Okay.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:31.520
That was my extra answer is that elder scrolls online doesn't make its console release.

02:15:31.520 --> 02:15:35.340
It just similar gets just evaporated.

02:15:35.340 --> 02:15:37.080
Elder scrolls online just evaporates.

02:15:37.080 --> 02:15:38.080
Yeah.

02:15:38.120 --> 02:15:44.760
And then Loki covered this one, but I was going to say Microsoft, Microsoft announces

02:15:44.760 --> 02:15:48.720
officially what they're doing with Minecraft and once everyone sees it, no one will care

02:15:48.720 --> 02:15:49.720
that they bought it.

02:15:49.720 --> 02:15:50.720
They'll love it.

02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:51.720
They'll immediately fickle game.

02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:52.920
We'd be like, yes, I want it.

02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:53.920
It's so good.

02:15:53.920 --> 02:15:55.760
They won't care where it comes from because that's what happens.

02:15:55.760 --> 02:15:56.760
Okay.

02:15:56.760 --> 02:15:59.600
But yeah, that's a very positive answer compared to your negativity.

02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:01.920
And then you'll like this one is just for you.

02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:08.840
Some shade, um, polygon at some point over the year posts an editorial masked as news

02:16:08.840 --> 02:16:13.040
that is as dire and catastrophic as it is pretentious.

02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:14.040
But see, that's too safe.

02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:15.040
Yeah.

02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:16.040
Obviously will happen.

02:16:16.040 --> 02:16:17.040
That's that.

02:16:17.040 --> 02:16:18.040
That's going to happen every week.

02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:19.600
That's, that's, that's a given.

02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:20.600
So there you go.

02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:23.240
That's a little, little, little more, uh, rainbows and unicorns.

02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:24.240
Those are my spares.

02:16:24.240 --> 02:16:25.240
AKA throwaways.

02:16:25.240 --> 02:16:26.240
That's good.

02:16:26.240 --> 02:16:27.240
That's a good list.

02:16:27.240 --> 02:16:28.240
Thank you.

02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:29.240
You're always a good time.

02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:30.240
You're Lars Von Trier Minecraft though.

02:16:30.240 --> 02:16:31.240
That was better than anything.

02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:32.240
That's my favorite.

02:16:32.240 --> 02:16:36.800
The creepers are a metaphor for incest.

02:16:36.800 --> 02:16:37.800
Soundtrack by Bjork.

02:16:37.800 --> 02:16:38.800
And she's just crying.

02:16:38.800 --> 02:16:39.800
Bjork crying.

02:16:39.800 --> 02:16:44.320
Isn't that already a Bjork album?

02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:49.960
No, it's like Bjork's beatboxing album is Minecraft.

02:16:49.960 --> 02:17:00.040
You know, it is morning and everything is precious.

02:17:00.040 --> 02:17:01.040
Minecraft two.

02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:02.840
Bye.

02:17:02.840 --> 02:17:03.840
Bye.

02:17:03.840 --> 02:17:06.240
Thank you for blessing the show with your presence.

02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:07.240
I appreciate it.

02:17:07.240 --> 02:17:08.240
All right.

02:17:08.240 --> 02:17:10.080
And not just because it's our five year anniversary.

02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:11.080
All right.

02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:12.080
Now you too.

02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:13.080
All right.

02:17:13.080 --> 02:17:16.320
Let's get to the mailbag every week.

02:17:16.320 --> 02:17:17.400
You guys send us emails.

02:17:17.400 --> 02:17:21.280
Now it's your chance to take over the show for a little bit.

02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:23.000
Participate at orangelaungeradio.com.

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:27.840
If you want to participate with our mailbag segment, again, that's participate at orangelaungeradio.com

02:17:27.840 --> 02:17:30.960
where you can send your emails and dark soccer will dive into the mailbag head.

02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:38.200
First and find the email finds the emails that she believes are worthy of reading on

02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:39.600
the show tonight.

02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:40.600
Dark soccer.

02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:42.640
What is in the mailbag?

02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:48.440
First one comes from Robert M. I can't really give a proper top three since most of my leisure

02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:51.800
time lately seems to be watching let's play videos and trying to sleep.

02:17:51.800 --> 02:17:54.800
But here's what comes to my, this sounds like my husband.

02:17:54.800 --> 02:17:58.800
Best 2003 13 steam purchase rogue legacy 2013.

02:17:58.800 --> 02:17:59.800
Okay.

02:17:59.800 --> 02:18:00.800
Yeah.

02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:05.120
I'm glad I finally tricked this one out even though I still haven't made it much further

02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:06.120
than the first boss.

02:18:06.120 --> 02:18:10.760
It runs great for me except some more visually demanding traits like nearsighted or nostalgic

02:18:10.760 --> 02:18:13.040
on my 2009 Mac book.

02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:15.400
Gaming on a Mac.

02:18:15.400 --> 02:18:17.800
Y'all shut up.

02:18:17.800 --> 02:18:22.560
Smartest early access zombie survival strategy unturned.

02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:28.360
In a store crammed with such titles, the Canadian roadblocks originated unturned with its simplistic

02:18:28.360 --> 02:18:33.560
look, making it stand out and run on more systems than the more realistic looking games

02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:39.160
only asked an entirely optional $5 for bonus content as opposed to the usual 20 to 40.

02:18:39.160 --> 02:18:43.040
Its current build still doesn't always run great on my laptop though.

02:18:43.040 --> 02:18:45.080
And then what am I doing with my life?

02:18:45.080 --> 02:18:47.020
Smash champs for mobile.

02:18:47.020 --> 02:18:53.760
This game is explicitly a rip off or a take on of, um, a competitive fruit ninja where

02:18:53.760 --> 02:18:58.240
you go training, uh, where you, what, Oh, nevermind.

02:18:58.240 --> 02:19:03.640
I was misreading it with you training, fighting animal characters, but I can't seem to stop

02:19:03.640 --> 02:19:06.120
clicking in to take my turns.

02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:09.720
It has this charm, but it's, uh, but it's not certainly one I would put on a proper

02:19:09.720 --> 02:19:11.460
game of the year list.

02:19:11.460 --> 02:19:17.960
Certainly not next to threes and uh, monument valley and that's from Robert M. All right.

02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:21.000
Those are, that was a kind of a creative way of doing a top three.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Appreciate that.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:23.000
Yep.

02:19:23.240 --> 02:19:23.760
All right.

02:19:23.760 --> 02:19:25.320
Um, next up.

02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:26.320
Yep.

02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:32.920
Hello, well, our it's cool that balloon fight came up as a classic game of the week, but

02:19:32.920 --> 02:19:36.680
other than tons of virtual console and related releases, it seems you guys believe nothing

02:19:36.680 --> 02:19:39.040
else has been done with the franchise.

02:19:39.040 --> 02:19:43.540
I guess none of you played a wonderful Nintendo land on Wii U because if you had, you'd certainly

02:19:43.540 --> 02:19:45.040
have remembered balloon trip breeze.

02:19:45.040 --> 02:19:46.600
I did not play.

02:19:46.600 --> 02:19:48.600
I forgot.

02:19:48.600 --> 02:19:50.560
Like a lot of Nintendo land side.

02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:51.560
I, I forgot.

02:19:51.560 --> 02:19:52.560
Sorry.

02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:54.120
I don't have a Wii U.

02:19:54.120 --> 02:19:56.880
It wasn't as strong of a launch title as Wii sports, just saying.

02:19:56.880 --> 02:19:57.880
That's right.

02:19:57.880 --> 02:19:58.880
Now that he's saying that.

02:19:58.880 --> 02:19:59.880
Oh yeah, duh.

02:19:59.880 --> 02:20:01.260
That was a, that was a thing in Nintendo land.

02:20:01.260 --> 02:20:02.800
It's a high good observation.

02:20:02.800 --> 02:20:06.440
It's a high definition re-imagining of the classic one player endurance test featuring

02:20:06.440 --> 02:20:10.600
23 stages of challenging game play and charming visuals.

02:20:10.600 --> 02:20:14.800
There are items to collect and it means to battle and of course balloons to pop.

02:20:14.800 --> 02:20:15.920
It's really great.

02:20:15.920 --> 02:20:20.000
And one of the many reasons that anyone with Wii U should track down a cheap used copy

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:25.720
of Nintendo land, but not worth it finding a new un-purchased copy, right?

02:20:25.720 --> 02:20:26.720
No.

02:20:26.720 --> 02:20:31.280
Um, also because I didn't get in the top games of the year thing, I wanted to mention two

02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:35.680
indie games that are my top three of 2014 but slipped under the radar for most people.

02:20:35.680 --> 02:20:42.160
Bike Rider DX2 Galaxy on Nintendo 3DS is a sequel to 2013's most popular Japanese e-shop

02:20:42.160 --> 02:20:43.160
download.

02:20:43.160 --> 02:20:46.560
It's a very simple game where you move forward automatically, press A to jump and try to

02:20:46.560 --> 02:20:48.020
reach the goal.

02:20:48.020 --> 02:20:51.780
There are also pickups that allow you to float, fly, glide, drill through rocks, and more.

02:20:51.780 --> 02:20:56.540
So it's Rainbow Unicorn Attack, or Robot Unicorn Attack.

02:20:56.540 --> 02:21:00.620
Any game developer should take note that it's basically a clinic on both level design and

02:21:00.620 --> 02:21:05.060
how to introduce new gameplay features throughout a game's levels, of which it has many.

02:21:05.060 --> 02:21:09.620
It costs a whopping $2.99 and if anyone listening to this downloads it and winds up hating it,

02:21:09.620 --> 02:21:11.660
I will pay them back.

02:21:11.660 --> 02:21:13.040
Really?

02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:16.940
It's the best value on the e-shop and one of the 3DS's best games.

02:21:16.940 --> 02:21:20.480
And then TXK is Jeff Minter's latest game.

02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:24.780
If you don't know what it is, I will say that it's a perfectly tuned version of Tempest

02:21:24.780 --> 02:21:28.060
2000 from the creator of Space Giraffe.

02:21:28.060 --> 02:21:31.980
If you don't know what either of those are, I'll just say that if you like arcade style

02:21:31.980 --> 02:21:36.580
shooting, hard and fast electronic music, and pretty visuals, then grab a Vita, drop

02:21:36.580 --> 02:21:40.540
ten bucks on this game and turn off the lights, plug in some good headphones, and feed your

02:21:40.540 --> 02:21:43.420
head to a hundred levels of bliss.

02:21:43.420 --> 02:21:49.100
I hadn't realized that it came out until it was released as a PS Plus download in October,

02:21:49.100 --> 02:21:51.380
and then quickly bought it before it became free.

02:21:51.380 --> 02:21:54.820
It was worth every cent, plus way more, and now is the best gaming experience I've had

02:21:54.820 --> 02:21:56.140
in 2014.

02:21:56.140 --> 02:22:00.500
If you don't own a Vita, but do own or will own a PS4, it's coming next year.

02:22:00.500 --> 02:22:06.540
A VoG Jam Jam Reggae YYR.

02:22:06.540 --> 02:22:07.540
I like that.

02:22:07.540 --> 02:22:08.540
VoG Jam Jam Reggae.

02:22:08.540 --> 02:22:09.540
Yay!

02:22:09.540 --> 02:22:10.540
Good, some good picks!

02:22:10.540 --> 02:22:11.860
I like that.

02:22:11.860 --> 02:22:13.260
Okay.

02:22:13.300 --> 02:22:20.140
And this one here is from Andy R. Let me move a bit.

02:22:20.140 --> 02:22:23.660
Just chiming in with my picks for favorite games last year.

02:22:23.660 --> 02:22:27.900
Three, Altilier, Escha, and Loggy.

02:22:27.900 --> 02:22:31.420
I'm a huge fan of the series in general, but this entry especially grabbed me.

02:22:31.420 --> 02:22:34.940
The combat has always been refined from the previous entries.

02:22:34.940 --> 02:22:38.820
And the alchemy system, one of the big draws of the series, is especially engaging thanks

02:22:38.820 --> 02:22:42.900
to a focus on using skills and abilities during the alchemy rather than the ingredient focus

02:22:42.940 --> 02:22:45.620
system of some of the past games.

02:22:45.620 --> 02:22:51.660
Two, Tales of Hearts R. Just a wonderful game, the combat is fast and fun, with a system

02:22:51.660 --> 02:22:55.660
that lets you ping pong enemies all over the battlefield if you're good.

02:22:55.660 --> 02:22:57.980
I also really enjoyed the characters.

02:22:57.980 --> 02:23:01.900
I was happy that the game actually went full bore on the romance, something a lot of JRPGs

02:23:01.900 --> 02:23:04.260
seem to leave in the implied area.

02:23:04.260 --> 02:23:09.100
One, Guilty Gear XRD.

02:23:09.100 --> 02:23:12.820
Only just came out in December, but I love it already.

02:23:12.860 --> 02:23:17.740
And I've been a fan of this series for a while, but Absence really made the heart grow fonder.

02:23:17.740 --> 02:23:23.420
It's been forever since we had a proper sequel, pretty much since the PS2, as the only PS3

02:23:23.420 --> 02:23:26.060
release, was a port with a few balance changes.

02:23:26.060 --> 02:23:30.100
And this game kicks the franchise back into gear, haha, in a major way.

02:23:30.100 --> 02:23:33.740
For the last few games, if I'm not playing this game, I'm probably thinking about this

02:23:33.740 --> 02:23:34.740
game.

02:23:34.740 --> 02:23:36.140
For the last few weeks, sorry.

02:23:36.140 --> 02:23:39.860
Also one disappointment, Super Smash Brothers on the 3DS.

02:23:39.860 --> 02:23:41.540
Not the Wii U, that version is fine.

02:23:41.580 --> 02:23:46.660
I really don't feel the 3DS version, it feels incredibly subpar compared to the Wii U version,

02:23:46.660 --> 02:23:49.580
to the point where I almost sold it back to buy it on the Wii U.

02:23:49.580 --> 02:23:53.460
It just feels like there's much less single player content, the main mode Smash Run is

02:23:53.460 --> 02:23:55.980
just crap in my opinion.

02:23:55.980 --> 02:24:01.180
And I've yet to play the 3DS version online with 4 people, and have the match not lag

02:24:01.180 --> 02:24:02.460
a ton.

02:24:02.460 --> 02:24:04.780
Like everyone is moving at half speed lag.

02:24:04.780 --> 02:24:09.100
As I've said, Wii U version is good, although obviously not one of my top 3, just the 3DS

02:24:09.100 --> 02:24:11.100
version feels like a waste of 40 bucks.

02:24:11.140 --> 02:24:13.300
Thanks and have a happy new year, Andy R.

02:24:13.300 --> 02:24:16.940
I get the sense that Andy R kinda likes JRPGs a little bit.

02:24:16.940 --> 02:24:17.940
No.

02:24:17.940 --> 02:24:18.940
No.

02:24:18.940 --> 02:24:19.940
You don't say.

02:24:19.940 --> 02:24:20.940
No, thanks for the email though.

02:24:20.940 --> 02:24:21.940
Appreciate it.

02:24:21.940 --> 02:24:22.940
Heyyyyy.

02:24:22.940 --> 02:24:24.940
Sorry, no one saw the hand move, open.

02:24:24.940 --> 02:24:26.940
Um, hola.

02:24:26.940 --> 02:24:28.940
This is your friendly neighborhood Mexican act-deafed.

02:24:28.940 --> 02:24:29.940
Hola.

02:24:29.940 --> 02:24:30.940
Hi.

02:24:30.940 --> 02:24:36.020
I wanted to participate in last week's show, but it has some stuff to do, but I wanted

02:24:36.020 --> 02:24:38.780
to weigh in with my picks for best games of 2014.

02:24:38.860 --> 02:24:42.820
I will try to make this short, but sorry if gush for some of them.

02:24:42.820 --> 02:24:47.660
I will, however, not rank them in top 3, but rather best games based in my experience with

02:24:47.660 --> 02:24:48.660
them.

02:24:48.660 --> 02:24:50.900
Sleeper Hit of the Year, Lethal League.

02:24:50.900 --> 02:24:55.700
This game combines a simple game like Pong at Smash Brothers Mechanics and Jet Set Radio's

02:24:55.700 --> 02:24:58.380
style and gives us a really fun game.

02:24:58.380 --> 02:25:02.260
I think it's only on Steam right now, got it during the sale, but hopefully it does

02:25:02.260 --> 02:25:05.940
get a console release since this game deserves everyone's attention.

02:25:05.980 --> 02:25:11.140
The Does of the Year, or my obvious picks, Smash Brothers 3DS slash Wii U, Mario Kart

02:25:11.140 --> 02:25:15.420
8, Bayonetta 1 and 2, all Wii U I know, but in consideration of what the other consoles

02:25:15.420 --> 02:25:19.220
had to offer, Nintendo offered all I wanted.

02:25:19.220 --> 02:25:20.220
Surprises of the Year.

02:25:20.220 --> 02:25:22.020
First, Captain Toad Treasure Tracker.

02:25:22.020 --> 02:25:25.840
I love the Captain Toad levels in Super Mario 3D World, but I was worried that the Treasure

02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:28.300
Tracker wasn't going to be that great.

02:25:28.300 --> 02:25:33.260
I was surprised that they gave lots of life of a somewhat simple concept.

02:25:33.260 --> 02:25:34.260
It's really awesome.

02:25:34.660 --> 02:25:35.660
Second, Hearthstone.

02:25:35.660 --> 02:25:39.700
Granted, I don't play a lot, but that game is really well done and quite entertaining.

02:25:39.700 --> 02:25:42.100
I seriously cannot wait for the Android version.

02:25:42.100 --> 02:25:46.060
And finally, my game of 2014 is Shovel Knight.

02:25:46.060 --> 02:25:47.060
That game is freaking amazing!

02:25:47.060 --> 02:25:48.060
Those are all in caps.

02:25:48.060 --> 02:25:49.060
Those are all in caps.

02:25:49.060 --> 02:25:51.380
It is a great game.

02:25:51.380 --> 02:25:52.380
It's near perfection.

02:25:52.380 --> 02:25:57.700
Many complain about not being fresh and the game being short, but that's what makes it

02:25:57.700 --> 02:25:58.700
good for me.

02:25:58.700 --> 02:26:02.020
It's everything great from the NES era and put into a single game.

02:26:02.020 --> 02:26:06.300
That game offers replayability by giving us achievements, new games plus, and tons

02:26:06.300 --> 02:26:07.300
of cheats.

02:26:07.300 --> 02:26:10.700
I own the game on Wii U, 3DS, and Steam, and I'll purchase the Playstation version when

02:26:10.700 --> 02:26:11.840
it comes out.

02:26:11.840 --> 02:26:17.060
This is my Mass Effect slash Grand Theft Auto, but it's definitely worth the money I'm throwing

02:26:17.060 --> 02:26:21.060
to Yacht Club games, and the hype is definitely there.

02:26:21.060 --> 02:26:22.060
And the music.

02:26:22.060 --> 02:26:23.060
By God, the music.

02:26:23.060 --> 02:26:24.060
It was really good.

02:26:24.060 --> 02:26:25.700
Well, that's it for me.

02:26:25.700 --> 02:26:27.420
There were a lot of good games in 2014.

02:26:27.420 --> 02:26:31.980
Hopefully 2015 can live up to the hype with Amplitude Mighty No. 9, Overwatch, Splatoon,

02:26:31.980 --> 02:26:38.180
and Zelda, and all the other games that may come and may even not know about.

02:26:38.180 --> 02:26:42.020
Until next time, Deft is Ka-Brown.

02:26:42.020 --> 02:26:43.020
Great email.

02:26:43.020 --> 02:26:44.020
Good list.

02:26:44.020 --> 02:26:45.020
Yes.

02:26:45.020 --> 02:26:46.020
And the last.

02:26:46.020 --> 02:26:47.020
The last.

02:26:47.020 --> 02:26:48.020
The last.

02:26:48.020 --> 02:26:49.020
The final.

02:26:49.020 --> 02:26:51.680
Hey, OLR crew, and Happy New Year to all.

02:26:51.680 --> 02:26:54.660
By the way, this comes from AZHP, by the way.

02:26:54.660 --> 02:27:00.300
AZHP here, done with, sorry, with a yearly reminder for all the OLR me to check out Awesome

02:27:00.300 --> 02:27:06.300
Games Done Quick, which we mentioned during last segment, the last part.

02:27:06.300 --> 02:27:08.860
It started this morning and runs until Saturday.

02:27:08.860 --> 02:27:12.380
Speed gamers from all over the globe have gathered in Washington, D.C. to raise money

02:27:12.380 --> 02:27:17.580
for the Prevent Cancer Foundation, which you should always, always look for anything other

02:27:17.580 --> 02:27:22.700
than the Susan G. Komen Foundation for your cancer donations, because Komen is evil.

02:27:22.700 --> 02:27:24.060
Okay, right.

02:27:24.060 --> 02:27:25.780
Moving on.

02:27:25.780 --> 02:27:28.900
Last year, they raised over $1 million throughout the week.

02:27:28.900 --> 02:27:34.180
They already topped $100,000 today, and not counting donations, but that counts from going

02:27:34.180 --> 02:27:38.820
through the different store things, so not the individual contributions.

02:27:38.820 --> 02:27:43.500
It's been less than 12 hours and they've already raised $125,000.

02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:46.700
It's pretty crazy, but let's try and break last year's record and make this the most

02:27:46.700 --> 02:27:50.660
successful charity marathon yet and prove that gamers can do good sometimes.

02:27:50.660 --> 02:27:52.300
Yours truly, AZHP.

02:27:52.300 --> 02:27:53.300
P.S.

02:27:53.300 --> 02:27:58.380
The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time run record was broken earlier this week by Joden Stone,

02:27:58.380 --> 02:28:05.340
who beat Cosmo's record of 18.10 by 3 seconds to bring it to an exceptionally low 18.07.

02:28:05.340 --> 02:28:12.100
People are estimating that an absolutely perfect run could reach 17.59, so it's ridiculously

02:28:12.100 --> 02:28:13.900
optimized.

02:28:13.900 --> 02:28:19.060
And this guy got into speed running only two years after watching AGQD 2013, so it's never

02:28:19.060 --> 02:28:20.300
too late to get into the game.

02:28:20.300 --> 02:28:21.300
Who knows?

02:28:21.300 --> 02:28:22.300
You could be a world record holder someday, too.

02:28:22.300 --> 02:28:23.300
That's right.

02:28:23.300 --> 02:28:28.140
The record, the Banjo one that they did today, only missed the record by four seconds.

02:28:28.140 --> 02:28:29.140
Oh, wow.

02:28:29.140 --> 02:28:30.140
Yeah.

02:28:30.140 --> 02:28:31.900
It was a really, really solid run.

02:28:31.900 --> 02:28:32.900
That's awesome.

02:28:32.900 --> 02:28:36.220
And it's funny, AZHP took my last story, because I was going to tell you guys about this.

02:28:36.220 --> 02:28:39.140
It was on my list of things to tell you about tonight anyway.

02:28:39.140 --> 02:28:43.700
They pick a really good time of year to do it because they can get a lot of coverage

02:28:43.700 --> 02:28:47.140
because there's not a lot of other gaming news going on this year, so this is a great

02:28:47.140 --> 02:28:48.580
thing to be reporting on.

02:28:48.580 --> 02:28:51.620
So I guess the only other thing I would add to this that AZHP didn't already say in his

02:28:51.620 --> 02:28:56.300
email is that there is a Humble Bundle to go along with this, and it had come up a little

02:28:56.300 --> 02:28:57.660
earlier in the show.

02:28:57.660 --> 02:29:02.340
So another way, and they're sending all their money that they make on this Humble Bundle,

02:29:02.340 --> 02:29:04.780
you know, with the tips and all that.

02:29:04.780 --> 02:29:08.780
You can just choose to have all your money go to that same Prevent Cancer Foundation,

02:29:08.780 --> 02:29:10.340
which is really cool.

02:29:10.340 --> 02:29:12.540
You can choose how the money is split.

02:29:12.540 --> 02:29:18.420
Just to throw out there, the stuff that you get for free, Duke Nukem 3D Megaton Edition,

02:29:18.420 --> 02:29:25.060
Shadow Warrior Classic Redo, Oddworld Abe's Odyssey, Volgar the Viking, and then for $6,

02:29:25.060 --> 02:29:30.020
there's a Twitch Turbo subscription, Shantae Risky Revenge Director's Cut, Speedrunner's

02:29:30.020 --> 02:29:34.900
Early Access, how appropriate for this, and Speedrunner's YouTuber packs.

02:29:34.900 --> 02:29:40.780
And then lastly, $10 or more will get you a scapegoat 2 and an XSplit premium 3-month

02:29:40.780 --> 02:29:41.780
subscription.

02:29:41.780 --> 02:29:46.020
You can also, if you're willing to toss in $30, there's like t-shirts, buttons, stickers,

02:29:46.020 --> 02:29:50.380
a lot of extra stuff with that as well, so lots and lots and lots of good stuff there

02:29:50.380 --> 02:29:53.860
that you can also help contribute to the same charity.

02:29:53.860 --> 02:29:57.500
Even though I don't think this money counts towards what they're tabulating on their Twitch

02:29:57.500 --> 02:30:02.580
channel, I'm not sure if it's all together, but certainly still counts.

02:30:02.580 --> 02:30:06.500
They're doing great stuff with that charity, so props to them.

02:30:06.500 --> 02:30:10.020
And fuck cancer, I think very important to say.

02:30:10.020 --> 02:30:11.020
Fuck cancer.

02:30:11.020 --> 02:30:12.020
All right.

02:30:12.020 --> 02:30:15.040
This is your last call to vote in tonight's List List.

02:30:15.080 --> 02:30:18.000
Get your points by voting in tonight's List List now.

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:23.400
This is your last chance, last call for List List votes, live.vognetwork.com.

02:30:23.400 --> 02:30:27.800
You only have about a minute and a half left because it, well, maybe five minutes, depending

02:30:27.800 --> 02:30:29.120
on how this segment goes tonight.

02:30:29.120 --> 02:30:32.560
It is time for the FUs of the Week.

02:30:45.040 --> 02:30:48.400
This is fucked up.

02:30:48.400 --> 02:30:53.400
I had something I was really angry about earlier today, but I don't remember what it is.

02:30:53.400 --> 02:31:02.520
So FU two days off not having an extra four hours each day, and my days on being short

02:31:02.520 --> 02:31:03.520
four hours.

02:31:03.520 --> 02:31:06.560
They should just move those around.

02:31:06.560 --> 02:31:10.000
Come on, doctor, change time and space for me.

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:11.000
That's a fair request.

02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:12.920
Loki, your FU of the Week.

02:31:12.920 --> 02:31:14.760
I guess FV did.

02:31:14.760 --> 02:31:19.720
Children that don't sleep because our son was up for like three hours last night.

02:31:19.720 --> 02:31:20.720
So that's fun.

02:31:20.720 --> 02:31:23.040
And also my new schedule is kind of weird.

02:31:23.040 --> 02:31:28.160
I have to go in an hour and 45 minutes or hour and 15 minutes later in the morning.

02:31:28.160 --> 02:31:30.160
So I don't know how that's going to work.

02:31:30.160 --> 02:31:34.280
I just know there's going to be more traffic both to and from work.

02:31:34.280 --> 02:31:35.280
So that's kind of lame.

02:31:35.280 --> 02:31:36.280
Yeah.

02:31:36.280 --> 02:31:37.280
Tomorrow's going to be a crappy.

02:31:37.280 --> 02:31:38.480
And my lunch is 15 minutes shorter.

02:31:38.480 --> 02:31:42.720
So it's like, yeah, everybody goes back to work tomorrow.

02:31:42.720 --> 02:31:44.280
So it's going to be a really crappy commute.

02:31:44.800 --> 02:31:45.800
So good luck, everybody.

02:31:45.800 --> 02:31:46.800
That's why I'm going to leave early.

02:31:46.800 --> 02:31:47.800
There you go.

02:31:47.800 --> 02:31:49.320
That's why I'm glad Monday's my day off.

02:31:49.320 --> 02:31:50.320
Lucky you.

02:31:50.320 --> 02:31:52.320
And I live eight minutes from work.

02:31:52.320 --> 02:31:53.320
Right.

02:31:53.320 --> 02:31:58.720
Well, the FU for me is that FU to having to go back to work tomorrow and it's just been

02:31:58.720 --> 02:32:02.440
very exhausting lately, but at least have Seattle look forward to in a couple of weeks.

02:32:02.440 --> 02:32:05.040
I've got to make the money somehow.

02:32:05.040 --> 02:32:10.680
So FU to deadlines that sneak up on you out of nowhere.

02:32:10.680 --> 02:32:11.680
That's my other.

02:32:11.680 --> 02:32:12.680
I do have another one.

02:32:12.680 --> 02:32:13.680
All right, fine.

02:32:14.080 --> 02:32:16.960
Is everyone having the plague for my new year's party, Rob?

02:32:16.960 --> 02:32:21.520
Hey, look, blame the Chinese food I ate on not only Sunday, but Tuesday.

02:32:21.520 --> 02:32:23.520
It didn't make me sick and Dan finished mine off.

02:32:23.520 --> 02:32:28.000
I think it was it was just that my stomach was already kind of because I ate a lot of

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:29.000
that.

02:32:29.000 --> 02:32:34.800
But then I made eight Panda Express on Tuesday and that I see you've had overload.

02:32:34.800 --> 02:32:35.800
The end.

02:32:35.800 --> 02:32:36.800
Yeah.

02:32:36.800 --> 02:32:37.800
Over by the way.

02:32:37.800 --> 02:32:38.800
Fifth dream.

02:32:38.800 --> 02:32:39.800
I got your fun link and I'm going to watch it when I get home.

02:32:39.800 --> 02:32:40.800
It's fake Bjork.

02:32:40.800 --> 02:32:41.800
Oh God.

02:32:41.800 --> 02:32:43.040
All right.

02:32:43.400 --> 02:32:52.120
So it is time, everybody, to get the definitive list that you guys have all voted on tonight.

02:32:52.120 --> 02:32:53.120
That's right.

02:32:53.120 --> 02:32:54.120
We have tabulated the votes.

02:32:54.120 --> 02:32:56.920
And yes, I actually have the votes tonight.

02:32:56.920 --> 02:33:02.480
We have tabulated your votes and we have your answers for the definitive list.

02:33:02.480 --> 02:33:03.480
Here it is.

02:33:03.480 --> 02:33:06.480
The official O.L.R. 2015 predictions.

02:33:06.480 --> 02:33:11.520
Number three, Microsoft announces Minecraft two.

02:33:11.520 --> 02:33:14.720
Microsoft announces Minecraft two is the number three winner.

02:33:14.720 --> 02:33:19.560
And for number two tonight, we have a tie O.M.G.

02:33:19.560 --> 02:33:21.400
It's a tie for the number two answer.

02:33:21.400 --> 02:33:29.600
Number two answer is yet another 3DS skew and punishing silence from Valve on anything

02:33:29.600 --> 02:33:32.480
but financials is the number two.

02:33:32.480 --> 02:33:33.480
Yay.

02:33:33.480 --> 02:33:34.480
Alan for tying twice.

02:33:34.480 --> 02:33:35.480
There you go, Alan.

02:33:35.480 --> 02:33:36.480
Alan tied with himself.

02:33:36.480 --> 02:33:37.780
Tied himself.

02:33:37.780 --> 02:33:38.960
There it is.

02:33:38.960 --> 02:33:45.160
And the number one answer, and might I say a bit by a landslide, the number one answer

02:33:45.160 --> 02:33:50.360
tonight for your top 2015 prediction.

02:33:50.360 --> 02:33:56.000
One of those DDoS brats gets the death penalty is the official O.L.R.

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:57.000
Wishful thinking.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:01.360
See, aren't you glad I left that one alone?

02:34:01.360 --> 02:34:07.040
I think it's a little bit of wishful thinking on everybody's part there.

02:34:07.120 --> 02:34:12.560
It's just taking that off because no one would have voted for Konami being sold, so damn.

02:34:12.560 --> 02:34:15.320
You need to strategize a little better next time.

02:34:15.320 --> 02:34:16.800
So there it is.

02:34:16.800 --> 02:34:21.400
The death penalty coming to one of those DDoS brats in 2014.

02:34:21.400 --> 02:34:24.200
Ah, love it, love it, love it.

02:34:24.200 --> 02:34:25.200
All right.

02:34:25.200 --> 02:34:27.240
Thank you guys for participating with that.

02:34:27.240 --> 02:34:28.380
That was a lot of fun.

02:34:28.380 --> 02:34:33.020
And just like we did this year, assuming this show is still going next year, I don't see

02:34:33.020 --> 02:34:34.060
why it wouldn't be.

02:34:34.100 --> 02:34:38.580
We will revisit these predictions and see how far we've come.

02:34:38.580 --> 02:34:40.220
All right.

02:34:40.220 --> 02:34:41.220
There it is.

02:34:41.220 --> 02:34:42.660
Nobody going for the dark answer.

02:34:42.660 --> 02:34:46.660
Like Alan Alkley brought up kind of a darker answer and interesting.

02:34:46.660 --> 02:34:47.660
And people not doing...

02:34:47.660 --> 02:34:51.260
I would have thought the Dragon Age Inquisition is a very safe bet, but nobody opting...

02:34:51.260 --> 02:34:53.940
Well, it was on the board, but it was a little low.

02:34:53.940 --> 02:34:54.940
So yeah.

02:34:54.940 --> 02:34:55.940
There you go.

02:34:55.940 --> 02:34:56.940
All right.

02:34:56.940 --> 02:34:58.180
I just think no one cares anymore.

02:34:58.180 --> 02:35:02.580
At least no one cares to follow the whole, you know, gate problems.

02:35:02.580 --> 02:35:03.580
The ethics stuff.

02:35:04.100 --> 02:35:06.100
Let's just leave all that fuckery in 2014.

02:35:06.100 --> 02:35:12.900
Occasionally I'll go into, was it the subreddit that was a Kotaku in action that follows that

02:35:12.900 --> 02:35:13.900
kind of stuff.

02:35:13.900 --> 02:35:14.900
Fuck, I'm sorry.

02:35:14.900 --> 02:35:15.900
Well, no, no.

02:35:15.900 --> 02:35:16.900
That's what they just call it.

02:35:16.900 --> 02:35:17.900
It's, you know...

02:35:17.900 --> 02:35:18.900
No, no.

02:35:18.900 --> 02:35:19.900
I know, but I'm still saying I'm sorry.

02:35:19.900 --> 02:35:22.580
And it's just, it's just ridiculous stuff.

02:35:22.580 --> 02:35:27.700
And it's, you know, like with Polygon and everything, I just, I don't read that site

02:35:27.700 --> 02:35:33.180
anymore and they've just kind of gone in a different direction that I don't care to follow.

02:35:33.180 --> 02:35:36.460
It's too much drama in, in game reporting, I guess.

02:35:36.460 --> 02:35:41.380
In general, across the board, can we just leave being mean to each other in 2014?

02:35:41.380 --> 02:35:43.100
Can we just leave that in 2014?

02:35:43.100 --> 02:35:45.420
Like, I don't care.

02:35:45.420 --> 02:35:49.260
Can we just leave the being mean to each other in 2014, please?

02:35:49.260 --> 02:35:50.260
Please?

02:35:50.260 --> 02:35:51.260
Thank you.

02:35:51.260 --> 02:35:53.360
That should have been one of my answers.

02:35:53.360 --> 02:35:55.980
People stop being fucking mean, but, oh yeah, it's the internet.

02:35:55.980 --> 02:35:57.540
Oh, Rob, you're such a hippie.

02:35:57.540 --> 02:35:59.340
Nobody's ever going to get along on the internet.

02:35:59.340 --> 02:36:00.340
Can we...

02:36:00.860 --> 02:36:06.100
I know, I'm saying, Black Wolf says 2015, I'm saying, can we leave the meanness in 2014?

02:36:06.100 --> 02:36:11.060
Can we leave it behind and have 2015 be a year where people are like, oh, I don't know

02:36:11.060 --> 02:36:16.580
civil and can have like actual debate without making it so fucking personal?

02:36:16.580 --> 02:36:17.580
God.

02:36:17.580 --> 02:36:18.580
All right.

02:36:18.580 --> 02:36:22.300
Anyway, there it is.

02:36:22.300 --> 02:36:24.340
Moving on.

02:36:24.340 --> 02:36:28.420
Black Wolf says, no, leave it in 2015 and civility can be in 2016.

02:36:28.420 --> 02:36:29.860
You are part of the problem, sir.

02:36:29.860 --> 02:36:30.860
All right.

02:36:30.860 --> 02:36:31.860
Just kidding.

02:36:31.860 --> 02:36:34.460
Awesome Games Done Quick was going to be my last story, but seeing as we had an emailer

02:36:34.460 --> 02:36:37.940
already report on that, I will just plug it again.

02:36:37.940 --> 02:36:41.020
Check that out, you know, after this show is done, because you can always watch their

02:36:41.020 --> 02:36:43.260
entire archive at any point.

02:36:43.260 --> 02:36:50.020
Let's get into your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:36:50.020 --> 02:36:51.260
Please give us a call.

02:36:51.260 --> 02:36:54.940
You can talk about your predictions if you want, maybe something in the news that we

02:36:54.940 --> 02:36:56.500
missed tonight.

02:36:56.500 --> 02:36:59.420
Anything you want to talk about, the time is now to give us a call.

02:36:59.420 --> 02:37:04.540
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

02:37:04.540 --> 02:37:05.980
Let me check in anyway.

02:37:05.980 --> 02:37:09.460
Loki, any last minute stories tonight or even Dark Sakura?

02:37:09.460 --> 02:37:10.460
No.

02:37:10.460 --> 02:37:12.100
I like pie.

02:37:12.100 --> 02:37:14.820
I had a feeling pie is tonight's last minute story.

02:37:14.820 --> 02:37:16.420
There it is.

02:37:16.420 --> 02:37:20.500
While we wait and see if our Skype line lights up here, let me go to our Twitter at twitter.com

02:37:20.500 --> 02:37:21.500
slash OLR.

02:37:21.500 --> 02:37:26.420
I don't think we got a lot of like questions or discussion topics tonight, but we did get

02:37:26.420 --> 02:37:30.620
like act deaf tweeted us, listening to at OLR and heard this was the classic game of

02:37:30.620 --> 02:37:35.900
the week, taking a picture of his guitar room man there, which I retweeted and some people

02:37:35.900 --> 02:37:37.700
fans of that as well.

02:37:37.700 --> 02:37:40.780
Kamui, I'm totally going to mispronounce this name.

02:37:40.780 --> 02:37:41.780
I'm so sorry.

02:37:41.780 --> 02:37:44.900
Kamui Arikado says, awesome game.

02:37:44.900 --> 02:37:45.900
Yes, I agree.

02:37:45.900 --> 02:37:46.900
Awesome game.

02:37:46.900 --> 02:37:49.860
Soutor says, I love this game on my PSP.

02:37:49.860 --> 02:37:52.180
Awesome soundtrack for metal heads.

02:37:52.700 --> 02:37:56.420
Soutor also saying, I totes agree.

02:37:56.420 --> 02:37:57.420
I love that word.

02:37:57.420 --> 02:37:58.420
Totes agree.

02:37:58.420 --> 02:38:01.180
Good way to abbreviate totally on Twitter too.

02:38:01.180 --> 02:38:04.420
Totes agree on Manly Tears and Edward Scissorhands.

02:38:04.420 --> 02:38:05.420
Thank you.

02:38:05.420 --> 02:38:06.420
Thank you.

02:38:06.420 --> 02:38:08.340
It's a movie with sad parts.

02:38:08.340 --> 02:38:09.860
It's a fairy tale for everybody.

02:38:09.860 --> 02:38:10.860
All right.

02:38:10.860 --> 02:38:15.220
I just realized that CES is coming up really soon.

02:38:15.220 --> 02:38:16.220
It is.

02:38:16.220 --> 02:38:18.420
It's like, I already have people that have left for Vegas to go.

02:38:18.420 --> 02:38:19.900
I think it is like this coming week.

02:38:19.900 --> 02:38:20.900
Is it next week?

02:38:20.900 --> 02:38:21.900
I think it's next week.

02:38:22.620 --> 02:38:24.460
Yeah, it's coming up real soon.

02:38:24.460 --> 02:38:25.780
It's always right in the beginning of the year.

02:38:25.780 --> 02:38:27.460
I would love to go.

02:38:27.460 --> 02:38:30.900
It's just, I have a lot of trips coming up this year.

02:38:30.900 --> 02:38:35.780
I guess I could have taken Alan to CES for an anniversary trip.

02:38:35.780 --> 02:38:38.700
I'm like, oh, by the way, we're going to go to this convention that I'm going to write

02:38:38.700 --> 02:38:42.420
about for VOC, but I guess vacation means vacation.

02:38:42.420 --> 02:38:46.420
We're going to relax for a few days in Seattle and go to all the tourist traps.

02:38:46.420 --> 02:38:47.420
Yay.

02:38:47.420 --> 02:38:48.620
But we do have a call coming in, so let's get to it.

02:38:48.620 --> 02:38:49.620
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:38:49.620 --> 02:38:50.620
Who's this?

02:38:52.620 --> 02:38:53.620
Hi, Aaron.

02:38:53.620 --> 02:38:55.020
Hey, this is Regineer.

02:38:55.020 --> 02:38:56.020
There you are.

02:38:56.020 --> 02:38:57.020
Hey, buddy.

02:38:57.020 --> 02:38:58.020
What's up?

02:38:58.020 --> 02:38:59.020
Not much.

02:38:59.020 --> 02:39:01.020
I'll have to make this call short and sweet.

02:39:01.020 --> 02:39:02.020
That's fine.

02:39:02.020 --> 02:39:03.780
I'm a little bit under the weather.

02:39:03.780 --> 02:39:06.140
I've stopped packing my air for a minute.

02:39:06.140 --> 02:39:07.140
Feel better.

02:39:07.140 --> 02:39:08.860
Well, isn't it like below 30 out there?

02:39:08.860 --> 02:39:12.820
It's like some ungodly degrees out there in the Northeast right now, isn't it?

02:39:12.820 --> 02:39:13.820
I don't know.

02:39:13.820 --> 02:39:16.500
I haven't been outside all day.

02:39:16.500 --> 02:39:20.860
I've been mostly sleeping all day.

02:39:20.860 --> 02:39:30.700
But anyway, both you and Bobby were mentioning both in chat and on the show that Capcom and

02:39:30.700 --> 02:39:35.260
Konami really haven't been doing all that well financially speaking.

02:39:35.260 --> 02:39:41.700
That being said, do you think it would behoove them to release some of the classic games?

02:39:41.700 --> 02:39:42.700
No.

02:39:42.700 --> 02:39:50.100
Not so much on consoles because they've been doing that all along, especially on Xbox Live

02:39:50.100 --> 02:39:57.180
and PC, but at least on the PC space.

02:39:57.180 --> 02:40:04.060
In all seriousness, we pick on Konami and Capcom a little bit because they're easy targets.

02:40:04.060 --> 02:40:09.060
We all miss Mega Man and are a little irritated that Mega Man seemed to just kind of disappear

02:40:09.060 --> 02:40:13.340
over on the Capcom side and that a lot of games in general seem to be disappearing over

02:40:13.340 --> 02:40:14.340
there.

02:40:14.340 --> 02:40:18.260
And then on the Konami side, a lot can be said similarly about, I don't know, the music

02:40:18.260 --> 02:40:19.380
games, for one.

02:40:19.380 --> 02:40:22.620
Castlevania, for another, has really seemed to fall on the wayside.

02:40:22.620 --> 02:40:28.820
But in all seriousness, Konami still does have a very strong business in the casino

02:40:28.820 --> 02:40:32.020
realm and a lot of the other things they do outside of gaming.

02:40:32.020 --> 02:40:34.860
Pachinko, don't forget, is still a huge thing.

02:40:34.860 --> 02:40:38.100
We don't see it here, but it's still a huge industry in other parts of the world.

02:40:38.100 --> 02:40:42.540
Konami still does very well there.

02:40:42.540 --> 02:40:46.060
As much as we joke about it here on the show, I don't necessarily really think that either

02:40:46.060 --> 02:40:53.660
of those companies are going to just go under or fall belly up, but I still think acquisition

02:40:53.660 --> 02:40:55.740
is not completely out of the picture.

02:40:55.740 --> 02:41:00.380
I mean, sometimes these acquisitions happen and they kind of surprise us, so I never leave

02:41:00.380 --> 02:41:01.880
that stone unturned.

02:41:01.880 --> 02:41:08.180
That all being said, what you bring up about retro releases, especially on PC, well, you

02:41:08.180 --> 02:41:12.140
know another Japanese company is having a lot of luck with it, it seems, and that's

02:41:12.140 --> 02:41:13.420
Square Enix.

02:41:13.420 --> 02:41:17.460
And it really seems that Square Enix has really made a push this year.

02:41:17.460 --> 02:41:22.340
I never thought we would see Final Fantasy 13, nevertheless the whole trilogy, show up

02:41:22.340 --> 02:41:23.580
on Steam.

02:41:23.580 --> 02:41:30.540
And now it's not just PC, it's iOS and it's Android as well.

02:41:30.540 --> 02:41:36.920
It's all of these mobile platforms where you're seeing Final Fantasy 3, 4, 5, 6, I mean you're

02:41:36.920 --> 02:41:41.020
just seeing lots and lots of games in their archive that people really remember that they're

02:41:41.020 --> 02:41:42.740
really pushing out there.

02:41:42.740 --> 02:41:47.660
And as far as I know, doing pretty well with, I can't imagine those games are very expensive

02:41:47.660 --> 02:41:51.040
to make because they've all been ports of other stuff.

02:41:51.040 --> 02:41:54.860
So it can't be like that expensive for them to do.

02:41:54.860 --> 02:41:57.620
So I would think they're doing pretty well with that.

02:41:57.620 --> 02:42:02.640
So could Konami and Capcom be successful with a similar deal?

02:42:02.640 --> 02:42:09.400
I would think so, especially, you know, just straight up ports of some of the NES classics.

02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:14.860
Like I don't know, Gradius, Contra, I think a lot of people would end up buying iOS ports

02:42:14.860 --> 02:42:19.460
of those, even if they're not even that good, because I still think, like how can you fucking

02:42:19.460 --> 02:42:21.400
play Contra without a controller?

02:42:21.400 --> 02:42:27.080
I don't know, but if somebody would spend the 99 cents to try and find out, it still

02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:31.560
makes Konami a lot of money at the end of the day.

02:42:31.560 --> 02:42:36.960
I don't see what there is to lose in those avenues, but that doesn't necessarily mean

02:42:36.960 --> 02:42:38.800
they're going to explore it.

02:42:38.800 --> 02:42:43.700
But I would think with Square Enix going down that path, maybe they'll follow.

02:42:43.700 --> 02:42:49.700
But as far as all the Mega Man games on PC, I don't know about that one.

02:42:49.700 --> 02:42:50.700
That might be a bit of a stretch.

02:42:50.700 --> 02:42:54.620
There was a Mega Man game on PC years ago, though.

02:42:54.620 --> 02:42:56.740
It had nothing to do with the rest of the Mega Man games.

02:42:56.740 --> 02:43:01.180
It was like, it was like three bosses and a couple Wileys Castle.

02:43:01.180 --> 02:43:02.180
I remember it.

02:43:02.180 --> 02:43:03.500
It was like an old PC game.

02:43:03.500 --> 02:43:04.860
You could play it in like CGA mode.

02:43:04.860 --> 02:43:05.860
Oh, God.

02:43:05.860 --> 02:43:06.860
Yeah.

02:43:06.860 --> 02:43:07.860
Yeah.

02:43:07.920 --> 02:43:08.920
It just kind of disappeared.

02:43:08.920 --> 02:43:09.920
I bought that.

02:43:09.920 --> 02:43:10.920
I did, too.

02:43:10.920 --> 02:43:11.920
It was pretty awesome.

02:43:11.920 --> 02:43:12.920
It ran like shit on my old computer.

02:43:12.920 --> 02:43:13.920
That is true.

02:43:13.920 --> 02:43:14.920
I can confirm it.

02:43:14.920 --> 02:43:16.760
Maybe with a built-in DOS box.

02:43:16.760 --> 02:43:19.100
That is a perfect candidate for GOG.

02:43:19.100 --> 02:43:21.080
But would Capcom ever get involved in a site like that?

02:43:21.080 --> 02:43:22.080
I don't know.

02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:23.080
I don't know.

02:43:23.080 --> 02:43:25.600
Yeah, I agree with you wholeheartedly.

02:43:25.600 --> 02:43:30.680
I'm no programmer by any means, no.

02:43:30.680 --> 02:43:39.220
Between me and everyone else on the bug community, probably Black Wolf knows probably the most

02:43:39.220 --> 02:43:41.340
from what I can tell.

02:43:41.340 --> 02:43:48.380
But even with that being said, I don't see re-releasing stuff on PC would be all that

02:43:48.380 --> 02:43:49.380
hard.

02:43:49.380 --> 02:44:00.500
And now that Council Lists can't play my previously purchased downloadable content, if the real

02:44:01.320 --> 02:44:07.960
releases were available on Steam, I would buy that stuff up in Heartbeat.

02:44:07.960 --> 02:44:09.200
You know me.

02:44:09.200 --> 02:44:12.120
I buy games left and right.

02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:13.120
Right.

02:44:13.120 --> 02:44:16.120
Well, I think a lot of us do when it comes to Steam.

02:44:16.120 --> 02:44:22.660
But anyway, again, as much as I don't think the entire Capcom, Mega Man, all eight games

02:44:22.660 --> 02:44:25.840
are going to come out for PC any time soon, or really ten, I guess, ten games are going

02:44:25.840 --> 02:44:28.520
to come out for PC any time soon.

02:44:28.520 --> 02:44:33.580
Remember, DuckTales HD was a thing, and a lot of people really liked it.

02:44:33.580 --> 02:44:36.140
And it did pretty good.

02:44:36.140 --> 02:44:42.020
Maybe that is the ray of hope that we need as far as some of these retro titles go.

02:44:42.020 --> 02:44:44.380
Just remember to buy this stuff if you like it.

02:44:44.380 --> 02:44:47.860
Don't frickin' pirate it and all that stuff, and that's going to send a message that we

02:44:47.860 --> 02:44:48.860
want more of it.

02:44:48.860 --> 02:44:49.860
So, all right.

02:44:49.860 --> 02:44:51.860
Well, RageNator, thanks for the call.

02:44:51.860 --> 02:44:52.860
And my fingers are crossed.

02:44:52.860 --> 02:44:55.180
I know you're a Steam fan and would like to see some of these classics on Steam.

02:44:55.180 --> 02:44:56.180
I hope it happens.

02:44:56.180 --> 02:44:57.180
Oh, definitely.

02:44:57.840 --> 02:44:58.840
Well, have a good one.

02:44:58.840 --> 02:44:59.840
All right?

02:44:59.840 --> 02:45:00.840
You, too.

02:45:00.840 --> 02:45:01.840
Feel better.

02:45:01.840 --> 02:45:02.840
All right.

02:45:02.840 --> 02:45:03.840
Thanks.

02:45:03.840 --> 02:45:04.840
All right.

02:45:04.840 --> 02:45:05.840
Bye.

02:45:05.840 --> 02:45:06.840
TigerClanChat, Mega Man PC came out in 1990.

02:45:06.840 --> 02:45:07.840
Let's see.

02:45:07.840 --> 02:45:11.080
BlackWolf in chat says, I'm not a programmer, but I don't think making this old code not

02:45:11.080 --> 02:45:15.240
made for current hardware, work on current hardware shouldn't be hard.

02:45:15.240 --> 02:45:16.640
Newsflash, it's not easy.

02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:22.560
Well, isn't it interesting that somebody put out an NES emulator on the iOS marketplace?

02:45:22.560 --> 02:45:26.600
That was one of the stories we read last week, and it got taken down swiftly.

02:45:27.020 --> 02:45:32.620
So, you know, it kind of depends on what level of a port they want to do.

02:45:32.620 --> 02:45:33.620
Okay.

02:45:33.620 --> 02:45:34.620
An emulator?

02:45:34.620 --> 02:45:35.620
Sure, it's going to take a little more.

02:45:35.620 --> 02:45:36.620
No, no, no.

02:45:36.620 --> 02:45:41.060
I'll go with Mega Man PC not being able to run on, you know, on current PCs.

02:45:41.060 --> 02:45:42.060
How about...

02:45:42.060 --> 02:45:44.860
1-877-GAMO-LR, username on Skype, orange launch radio.

02:45:44.860 --> 02:45:46.860
What about Mega Man 9 and Mega Man 10?

02:45:46.860 --> 02:45:48.500
No, why not?

02:45:48.500 --> 02:45:49.500
Those are more modern.

02:45:49.500 --> 02:45:50.500
Yeah.

02:45:50.500 --> 02:45:52.860
It should be a little bit easier, the port over, I would think.

02:45:52.860 --> 02:45:53.860
I would think.

02:45:53.860 --> 02:45:59.440
And then, you know, something like DuckTales HD especially takes a lot, a lot of work,

02:45:59.440 --> 02:46:04.000
and any time they're going to go back and actually change textures, you know, you're

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:09.200
talking about basically redoing the game in a new language, and so yeah, that's going

02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:10.440
to take work.

02:46:10.440 --> 02:46:16.480
So a lot more work than just the turning around of the other titles.

02:46:16.480 --> 02:46:22.460
I think another example is that Final Fantasy VI iOS port, I think a lot of the flak that

02:46:22.460 --> 02:46:27.340
game's getting and that port's getting is that it was obviously outsourced.

02:46:27.340 --> 02:46:31.840
And so sometimes that's how companies make these things happen is that they do them on

02:46:31.840 --> 02:46:37.040
the super cheap, that they don't have their usual teams working on them, they send them

02:46:37.040 --> 02:46:41.240
to other companies, and in some cases, like Final Fantasy VI, kind of think you get what

02:46:41.240 --> 02:46:43.320
you pay for a little bit, so.

02:46:43.320 --> 02:46:49.020
But Final Fantasy VI also didn't have any prior, you know, I don't think it was ever

02:46:49.020 --> 02:46:54.640
out on PSP, I don't think they redid it at all for DS or anything else that's modern,

02:46:54.640 --> 02:47:00.240
they probably had to go back and basically take that engine they had built for iOS for

02:47:00.240 --> 02:47:03.640
that Final Fantasy...

02:47:03.640 --> 02:47:08.820
There was another, there was a Final Fantasy game that was only on iOS that is like in

02:47:08.820 --> 02:47:13.780
five episodes or something and the first one's free, but that engine is clearly what five

02:47:13.780 --> 02:47:17.520
and six are running in, so they just took those games and like remade them in that engine.

02:47:17.540 --> 02:47:19.540
So, but anyway.

02:47:19.540 --> 02:47:27.020
1-877-GAME-OLR, our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, if you want to give us a call.

02:47:27.020 --> 02:47:28.260
Call our show, dammit.

02:47:28.260 --> 02:47:31.820
You know, I think this is an interesting, worthy comment here from chat.

02:47:31.820 --> 02:47:35.540
Kaijuto says, I'm burned out on retro crap.

02:47:35.540 --> 02:47:37.540
Let's get new and innovative.

02:47:37.540 --> 02:47:39.540
Duh, Dragon Age.

02:47:39.540 --> 02:47:42.700
I think there's a time and a place for retro crap.

02:47:42.700 --> 02:47:47.420
And to this day, and you know I always harp on this whenever I get the opportunity to,

02:47:47.420 --> 02:47:54.140
I think Game Room on Microsoft's Xbox 360 and PC died way before it should have.

02:47:54.140 --> 02:47:55.140
Way before it should have.

02:47:55.140 --> 02:47:59.640
And it's so irritating to then turn around and see them make a documentary on 2600, which

02:47:59.640 --> 02:48:02.200
to be fair I haven't watched and I need to.

02:48:02.200 --> 02:48:03.200
Maybe I'll do that tonight.

02:48:03.200 --> 02:48:04.540
I still really need to watch that.

02:48:04.540 --> 02:48:09.440
But it's like they had a chance to bring back Atari 2600 stuff and it was kind of cool and

02:48:09.440 --> 02:48:15.080
then they let it go for like three months and they pulled the plug and it was very sad.

02:48:15.080 --> 02:48:16.080
Anyway.

02:48:16.740 --> 02:48:18.460
And yeah, Black Wolf says the documentary is good.

02:48:18.460 --> 02:48:19.780
It's only a little over an hour.

02:48:19.780 --> 02:48:20.900
Yeah, I know it's pretty short.

02:48:20.900 --> 02:48:23.480
That's why I really need to make the time to watch it.

02:48:23.480 --> 02:48:25.060
So I'll have to do that at some point.

02:48:25.060 --> 02:48:29.020
I still have an Xbox Gold subscription so I should be able to get it on my 360.

02:48:29.020 --> 02:48:33.020
I just have to hook up my 360 because I disconnected it when I moved some things around here in

02:48:33.020 --> 02:48:34.020
the studio.

02:48:34.020 --> 02:48:35.020
So.

02:48:35.020 --> 02:48:36.020
Alright.

02:48:38.020 --> 02:48:42.620
Last call for calls, 1877 game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:48:42.620 --> 02:48:43.620
Oh, there it is.

02:48:43.620 --> 02:48:44.620
We've got one more call coming in.

02:48:44.620 --> 02:48:45.620
Let's get to it.

02:48:46.160 --> 02:48:47.160
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:48:47.160 --> 02:48:48.160
Who's this?

02:48:48.160 --> 02:48:49.160
It's me.

02:48:49.160 --> 02:48:50.160
We're only DJ Rama.

02:48:50.160 --> 02:48:51.160
Hey, Rama.

02:48:51.160 --> 02:48:52.160
I like that shirt.

02:48:52.160 --> 02:48:54.160
Is that like a Ninja Turtle shirt you're wearing?

02:48:54.160 --> 02:48:55.160
Even better.

02:48:55.160 --> 02:48:56.720
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Android.

02:48:56.720 --> 02:48:58.160
Oh, my God.

02:48:58.160 --> 02:48:59.160
That's cute.

02:48:59.160 --> 02:49:00.160
I like that.

02:49:00.160 --> 02:49:01.160
What's up, buddy?

02:49:01.160 --> 02:49:02.160
Yes.

02:49:02.160 --> 02:49:03.160
I'm kind of pissed right now.

02:49:03.160 --> 02:49:04.160
Why?

02:49:04.160 --> 02:49:10.080
Nobody's calling in and it seems like if nobody calls in, then I call in and everyone loses

02:49:10.080 --> 02:49:11.080
their mind.

02:49:11.080 --> 02:49:12.080
So you know what?

02:49:12.080 --> 02:49:14.960
I'm here to fill in the gap, keep things going till there's no dead air.

02:49:15.500 --> 02:49:16.500
So I'm here to help you all out.

02:49:16.500 --> 02:49:17.500
I'm a player five.

02:49:17.500 --> 02:49:18.500
Well, gee, thank you.

02:49:18.500 --> 02:49:19.500
I mean, we couldn't have talked.

02:49:19.500 --> 02:49:20.500
No.

02:49:20.500 --> 02:49:24.780
We can always talk amongst ourselves, but I appreciate you calling, Rama.

02:49:24.780 --> 02:49:27.580
It's always more fun with friends.

02:49:27.580 --> 02:49:28.580
And you know what?

02:49:28.580 --> 02:49:33.460
I know some people listen to this show and I know some people say, it's the same damn

02:49:33.460 --> 02:49:35.220
people who call in every week.

02:49:35.220 --> 02:49:38.980
And my response to that is, I would love to have you on the show too.

02:49:38.980 --> 02:49:40.300
Just give us a call.

02:49:40.300 --> 02:49:41.660
It's open for everybody.

02:49:41.660 --> 02:49:42.660
Or email us.

02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:43.960
And here's the thing.

02:49:43.960 --> 02:49:46.520
There have been times I do not call in at all.

02:49:46.520 --> 02:49:50.600
I let everybody else call in and see what's on their mind.

02:49:50.600 --> 02:49:54.480
And it's like, how long does it take to pick up the phone?

02:49:54.480 --> 02:49:55.480
This is what's bothering me.

02:49:55.480 --> 02:49:56.480
This is what's up.

02:49:56.480 --> 02:49:57.480
You know, that's all it is.

02:49:57.480 --> 02:49:58.480
I know.

02:49:58.480 --> 02:49:59.480
It's all right though.

02:49:59.480 --> 02:50:00.480
It's probably a slower.

02:50:00.480 --> 02:50:03.800
I haven't looked at the listener numbers for tonight, but I imagine with everybody going

02:50:03.800 --> 02:50:06.160
back to work tomorrow, it's probably a little lower than usual anyway.

02:50:06.160 --> 02:50:07.160
So no biggie.

02:50:07.160 --> 02:50:08.160
Pretty much.

02:50:08.160 --> 02:50:09.160
So what's on your mind though?

02:50:10.160 --> 02:50:12.300
I picked up another video game over the weekend.

02:50:12.300 --> 02:50:18.100
I picked up a couple of them to help with some awesome friends I have around this country.

02:50:18.100 --> 02:50:19.100
What's that?

02:50:19.100 --> 02:50:21.100
Let me go grab them real quick.

02:50:21.100 --> 02:50:25.260
Because you probably won't believe one of the games that I got.

02:50:25.260 --> 02:50:30.100
And the other one, you probably wouldn't be too surprised that I got in the first place.

02:50:30.100 --> 02:50:36.220
As you all know, a particular remake just happened to come out a few weeks ago.

02:50:36.220 --> 02:50:37.220
There it is.

02:50:37.280 --> 02:50:40.280
That's 2.5 HD Remix on PS3.

02:50:40.280 --> 02:50:41.280
Yeah, I got mine too.

02:50:41.280 --> 02:50:44.600
I didn't pick that up, and I really need to, but the reason why I didn't pick it up is

02:50:44.600 --> 02:50:49.040
because I didn't finish the frickin' first one, and I'm not going to play the second

02:50:49.040 --> 02:50:50.480
one until I finish the first one.

02:50:50.480 --> 02:50:51.480
Because by then it'll be on sale.

02:50:51.480 --> 02:50:53.960
Do you know anything special about this copy though?

02:50:53.960 --> 02:50:54.960
Is that a Japanese one?

02:50:54.960 --> 02:50:55.960
No, it's a pin, Rob.

02:50:55.960 --> 02:50:57.960
This is the limited edition with the Disney pin.

02:50:57.960 --> 02:50:58.960
Oh!

02:50:58.960 --> 02:50:59.960
Oh, holy shit.

02:50:59.960 --> 02:51:00.960
Nice.

02:51:00.960 --> 02:51:04.760
And I just lucked out on that because a friend of mine ordered two copies by accident because

02:51:04.760 --> 02:51:09.940
when I went to go to Target to get mine, they said they had it in store, I go to pick

02:51:09.940 --> 02:51:14.060
it up, I'm dealing with six people trying to ask them for the game, and they had no

02:51:14.060 --> 02:51:15.060
more.

02:51:15.060 --> 02:51:17.260
And when I went home, they still had it in stock, and I'm like, you know what, I'm not

02:51:17.260 --> 02:51:18.260
dealing with it today.

02:51:18.260 --> 02:51:19.260
Yep.

02:51:19.260 --> 02:51:20.260
You know what happened to us?

02:51:20.260 --> 02:51:21.260
What?

02:51:21.260 --> 02:51:22.260
They lost our order.

02:51:22.260 --> 02:51:25.740
No, they sent it to the old house even after we changed our address.

02:51:25.740 --> 02:51:26.740
Oh no.

02:51:26.740 --> 02:51:27.740
And so...

02:51:27.740 --> 02:51:31.660
That actually happened to my copy of, remember when Activision was giving out free copies

02:51:31.660 --> 02:51:34.100
of Guitar Hero Van Halen?

02:51:34.440 --> 02:51:35.440
Yeah.

02:51:35.440 --> 02:51:36.440
That happened to me!

02:51:36.440 --> 02:51:41.560
Well, we ended up talking to the seller and everything, and we got our copy shipped to

02:51:41.560 --> 02:51:42.560
us.

02:51:42.560 --> 02:51:43.560
Nice.

02:51:43.560 --> 02:51:46.080
And it arrived in time for opening presents.

02:51:46.080 --> 02:51:47.080
That is awesome.

02:51:47.080 --> 02:51:54.080
Now, the second game that I picked up, I like to call it Grand Theft Hacking, but from that

02:51:54.080 --> 02:51:58.440
title, though, I think you know which game I'm talking about.

02:51:58.440 --> 02:52:01.240
Grand Theft Hacking, I keep thinking Grand Theft Hacking.

02:52:01.240 --> 02:52:02.240
Watch Dogs.

02:52:02.240 --> 02:52:03.240
Oh, Watch Dogs.

02:52:03.380 --> 02:52:04.380
Yeah, so the PlayStation 3.

02:52:04.380 --> 02:52:05.380
Nice.

02:52:05.380 --> 02:52:06.380
Of course, of course.

02:52:06.380 --> 02:52:09.380
Hey, guess how much I paid for this?

02:52:09.380 --> 02:52:10.380
$9.99.

02:52:10.380 --> 02:52:11.380
Higher.

02:52:11.380 --> 02:52:12.380
Uh, $19.99.

02:52:12.380 --> 02:52:15.020
Crossed 25 with shipping.

02:52:15.020 --> 02:52:16.020
That's not bad.

02:52:16.020 --> 02:52:17.020
Not bad.

02:52:17.020 --> 02:52:20.820
It seems that select targets were getting rid of it, and a friend of mine posted a picture

02:52:20.820 --> 02:52:25.860
of the game, and I'm like, I will pay you money to send this to me, because I know for

02:52:25.860 --> 02:52:28.720
a fact if I check my target, it'll be retail price.

02:52:28.720 --> 02:52:32.020
And I checked, sure enough, this game was $59.

02:52:32.800 --> 02:52:38.040
And after playing two hours of this game, I tell you what, I feel sorry for anyone who

02:52:38.040 --> 02:52:39.800
paid retail price for this.

02:52:39.800 --> 02:52:40.800
I do.

02:52:40.800 --> 02:52:47.160
I'm gonna tell you, this is not the best time of year to get video games, because with everybody

02:52:47.160 --> 02:52:52.280
that gets gift cards over the holiday season, they want to go to the stores and spend all

02:52:52.280 --> 02:52:57.200
that money, so there's usually not a lot of sales early on this time of year.

02:52:57.200 --> 02:53:00.640
You're gonna have to wait for probably like President's Day, things like that, where you're

02:53:00.660 --> 02:53:03.700
gonna start to see some sales again to get people back in the stores.

02:53:03.700 --> 02:53:08.420
But yeah, these first few weeks of January, really crappy time to get games, because they

02:53:08.420 --> 02:53:10.820
know people want to burn those gift cards they got.

02:53:10.820 --> 02:53:18.560
Well, see, if I'm buying anything, it won't be video games, it'll be technology to keep

02:53:18.560 --> 02:53:23.420
the podcast and my crew going to conventions and doing other cool stuff.

02:53:23.420 --> 02:53:28.020
That's right, which is a necessity for a convention-focused show like your guys's.

02:53:28.080 --> 02:53:31.240
You know, we had a big convention here in Sacramento this weekend, and just none of

02:53:31.240 --> 02:53:33.880
us got around to getting out, but SacAnime was this weekend.

02:53:33.880 --> 02:53:35.880
Why did y'all not go to SacAnime?

02:53:35.880 --> 02:53:38.480
I know people, I would have gotten y'all a hookup.

02:53:38.480 --> 02:53:39.480
You know what's funny?

02:53:39.480 --> 02:53:43.520
And I know people through the stuff I used to do with Rocky, I know people involved with

02:53:43.520 --> 02:53:46.560
that stuff too, and it's just, I don't know why we don't go, well, I know why we don't

02:53:46.560 --> 02:53:50.240
go to the summer one, because the summer one is always the same weekend as Dragon Con and

02:53:50.240 --> 02:53:53.800
PAX, so it's like, sorry, SacAnime, there's just so much going on.

02:53:53.800 --> 02:53:55.160
I don't know why we don't go to the winter one.

02:53:55.160 --> 02:53:56.160
I don't have an excuse.

02:53:56.220 --> 02:53:58.220
I really should have fucking gone, and I didn't.

02:53:58.220 --> 02:53:59.220
I just, I don't know.

02:53:59.220 --> 02:54:04.540
I honestly, honest to God, I just forgot until one of my Facebook friends, actually, several

02:54:04.540 --> 02:54:09.220
of my Facebook friends were like, LOL, I was at SacAnime today, and I was like, aw, fuck.

02:54:09.220 --> 02:54:13.140
Yeah, because one of my friends who's also a voice actor, he went, he posted a picture

02:54:13.140 --> 02:54:19.700
of him and Peter Cullen, and I'm just like, oh, you bastard.

02:54:19.700 --> 02:54:20.700
Yeah.

02:54:20.700 --> 02:54:24.180
They're getting a lot of big names there right now, because again, this isn't a big time

02:54:24.200 --> 02:54:28.320
of year for cons, but celebs still want to get paid, so they can get some really good

02:54:28.320 --> 02:54:29.320
talent.

02:54:29.320 --> 02:54:33.760
And what's interesting is there's also another convention going on this weekend, too, I have

02:54:33.760 --> 02:54:37.920
friends that are staffing and working right now, Otacon Vegas.

02:54:37.920 --> 02:54:41.680
Oh, I didn't know that was this weekend, interesting.

02:54:41.680 --> 02:54:42.680
Wow.

02:54:42.680 --> 02:54:43.680
All right.

02:54:43.680 --> 02:54:47.760
Well, Rama, does Anime Jam Session come back from hiatus this week, or are you off on the

02:54:47.760 --> 02:54:48.760
week?

02:54:48.760 --> 02:54:49.760
No, we're still hibernating.

02:54:49.760 --> 02:54:57.540
We're going to be back next week, live episode, January 13th, and we're doing what you missed

02:54:57.540 --> 02:55:02.140
in the last two weeks in the fuckery that is anime and cosplay and other pop culture

02:55:02.140 --> 02:55:03.140
stuff.

02:55:03.140 --> 02:55:04.140
Well, good.

02:55:04.140 --> 02:55:06.140
I look forward to hearing about SacAnime on that, since I didn't go.

02:55:06.140 --> 02:55:10.020
Well, I think I'd be able to recruit someone to talk to us about SacAnime, but some of

02:55:10.020 --> 02:55:14.860
the other news we've been picking up, oh, yeah, it'll be quite fun.

02:55:14.860 --> 02:55:19.060
But Rama, Yaya Han went to SacAnime, come on.

02:55:19.060 --> 02:55:21.160
I'm glad I didn't go.

02:55:21.160 --> 02:55:24.520
You can't wait, so that means it's called Silicon.

02:55:24.520 --> 02:55:27.880
Oh, you people, you people, all right.

02:55:27.880 --> 02:55:29.960
Anime Jam Session, Tuesday nights here on VOG.

02:55:29.960 --> 02:55:30.960
All right.

02:55:30.960 --> 02:55:31.960
Take care, buddy.

02:55:31.960 --> 02:55:32.960
Yeah, you stay fabulous, Rob.

02:55:32.960 --> 02:55:33.960
Thank you.

02:55:33.960 --> 02:55:34.960
I will.

02:55:34.960 --> 02:55:35.960
Stay black.

02:55:35.960 --> 02:55:36.960
I will.

02:55:36.960 --> 02:55:37.960
I'll try.

02:55:37.960 --> 02:55:38.960
All right.

02:55:38.960 --> 02:55:39.960
Bye.

02:55:39.960 --> 02:55:40.960
Bye.

02:55:40.960 --> 02:55:41.960
There it is.

02:55:41.960 --> 02:55:42.960
I'm going to go ahead and close up the Skype line.

02:55:42.960 --> 02:55:43.960
Thank you guys so much for calling.

02:55:43.960 --> 02:55:46.320
If you didn't get through and you wanted to, well, you should have called a little faster,

02:55:46.320 --> 02:55:47.320
too.

02:55:47.320 --> 02:55:52.860
You can always email us, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com, but it is after midnight on the East Coast,

02:55:52.860 --> 02:55:55.380
about time for us to wrap up here on the West Coast.

02:55:55.380 --> 02:55:59.940
Thank you guys so much for tuning into the show and listening to our show.

02:55:59.940 --> 02:56:02.700
We hope you enjoyed it, despite the fact it was a little more of a slow news week, but

02:56:02.700 --> 02:56:06.540
you know, I think some of you like the tangents, so there was plenty of those for you this

02:56:06.540 --> 02:56:07.540
week.

02:56:07.540 --> 02:56:11.260
If you like what you heard here at Orange Lounge Radio, please help us spread the word,

02:56:11.260 --> 02:56:16.300
because we don't have a big magazine or website or big radio network or something.

02:56:16.300 --> 02:56:18.480
We don't have any backing from any of that.

02:56:18.480 --> 02:56:23.520
We are a homegrown show in our 13th year, if you can believe it.

02:56:23.520 --> 02:56:25.960
So word of mouth is all we got, word of mouth.

02:56:25.960 --> 02:56:32.120
Tell a friend or five about the show, a five-star rating on a network like iTunes or Stitcher,

02:56:32.120 --> 02:56:35.600
on which, by the way, we haven't gotten a five-star rating in a very long time on either

02:56:35.600 --> 02:56:39.140
of those networks, so we would really appreciate it if you take a few seconds to, wherever

02:56:39.140 --> 02:56:42.040
you learned about this show, go leave us a nice review.

02:56:42.040 --> 02:56:46.120
It goes a long way in helping for visibility, and we really deeply appreciate each one we

02:56:46.120 --> 02:56:47.120
get.

02:56:47.120 --> 02:56:51.340
It is time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:56:51.340 --> 02:56:52.500
Dark Soccer, I'll start with you tonight.

02:56:52.500 --> 02:56:54.340
Your final thought?

02:56:54.340 --> 02:56:56.460
I want ice cream.

02:56:56.460 --> 02:56:57.820
Yummy.

02:56:57.820 --> 02:57:04.100
My final thought tonight is support indie broadcasting, and also, I've got a lot of

02:57:04.100 --> 02:57:08.680
work to do, speaking of indie stuff, for VOG with loading the shows and all that stuff,

02:57:08.680 --> 02:57:13.040
before I go to bed early, so I can get up for work early and go to work early, yay early

02:57:13.040 --> 02:57:15.040
work, blah.

02:57:15.040 --> 02:57:16.820
Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:57:16.820 --> 02:57:20.300
I'll be damn lucky if I finish my VOG gym project by Sunday, but...

02:57:20.300 --> 02:57:21.300
You can do it.

02:57:21.300 --> 02:57:22.300
I will try.

02:57:22.300 --> 02:57:23.540
At least get one stage playable.

02:57:23.540 --> 02:57:24.540
At least get something.

02:57:24.540 --> 02:57:25.540
At least get a little something.

02:57:25.540 --> 02:57:26.540
I'll try.

02:57:26.540 --> 02:57:27.540
All right, there it is, guys.

02:57:27.540 --> 02:57:31.500
That is gonna do it, and as one of our emailers said tonight, we've got a lot of great stuff

02:57:31.500 --> 02:57:36.060
in gaming to look forward to this year, lots of great games on the way, things we might

02:57:36.060 --> 02:57:39.500
not even know about yet that we're gonna hear about at E3 and so forth, but it's gonna be

02:57:39.500 --> 02:57:42.700
an exciting year, and thanks for choosing to start it off with us.

02:57:42.700 --> 02:57:43.820
We really appreciate it.

02:57:43.820 --> 02:57:44.820
Have a great week, everybody.

02:57:44.820 --> 02:57:45.820
Happy gaming.

02:57:45.820 --> 02:57:49.080
We'll be back to do it again next week when everybody's back at work, and hopefully we

02:57:49.080 --> 02:57:50.300
have a little more news.

02:57:50.300 --> 02:57:52.960
If not, Winona Ryder chat for three hours.
