This week, Nintendo started the first full week of the year off with news of a partnership allowing their flagship series characters to be used in a non-Nintendo game. There's plenty of other movement as we progress into 2015, and we'll tell you more along with your comments, calls, and emails right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

Orange Lounge Radio

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio, live on this January 11th of 2015, episode number 583 of our show.

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And we are here to talk about video games, gaming culture, and the gamer lifestyle over the next three hours with you guys, all our live participants and podcast participants, and us here in studio. My name is Rob Roberts, and joining me as always, say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

5
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And is that your final word on the matter?

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
No.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
How are you?

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm in recovery.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
In recovery? Are you hungover?

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
No, I had a bad migraine yesterday, so my head has that weird numb feeling today.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Oh, those are no fun.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yeah, so I have a sinus infection. I am taking antibiotics. I'm going to have great skin in about another few days.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You sound really good for having a sinus infection, so you must be a couple days into meds.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It hurts, but I've been on the antibiotics for about a week now, so I do mostly better, but it's just like, oh, come on, I had the flu, then it's a sinus infection, what's next, pneumonia?

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Don't ask.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Actually, that is what happened last time I had a major sinus infection.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Be careful what you wish for. You better knock on wood. Well, if you need me to turn down some lights here in Studio N7, just let me know.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's fine.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Luckily, it's not a TV show.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Just get me Pinkberry later.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Why don't you do OLR like a video? Why don't you do like a feed of stuff? To be fair, we used to do a long time ago.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Because, no.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But that would involve extra lighting, which is going to make an ace even worse.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Because, no. That's why. Because, no.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Because it's Orange Lingerino, not Orange Lingerino.

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
No.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Also here tonight, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Hi.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Hi, how are you, Loki?

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Tired.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Tired? Yeah, I see you got an ample, ample supply of Red Bull here in the studio tonight.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's the only thing that's keeping me awake.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
If you ever want to start drinking coffee, let me know. We got a coffee maker.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I drink coffee too, but...

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Oh, do you?

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I don't like it.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yeah?

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Blasphemy.

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Like the white mochas and crap.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh, Starbucks. Like the, you know.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Oh, I want a mochaccino, and I want soy, and I want three pumps sugar-free vanilla.

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh, fuck that shit.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay, Mr. Non-Fat Latte.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Which is my actual order, just so you know.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Just kidding.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
See, I can, I could go to any Starbucks and order, I could go anywhere and order Rob a drink as long as it has caramel and is non-fat.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Is that, okay, is that so bad? Non-fat milk is not, is not so bad.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's like milk flavored water.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I know, I know, but...

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I wholly agree.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But if you have the whole, like, my body doesn't like dairy things and it's a good way to save on fat, then I don't think it's so bad.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The drinks turn off, it has coffee in it still, it's the most important part.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The coffee melts some butter and pours it inside.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You know, I actually...

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That's how you get fat.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
No, that's bulletproof coffee. Fat is good for you.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Fat is good for you.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
A little fat is good for you. Like, fat in, like, peanuts is good, but fat in french fries from McDonald's is not so good for you.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Well, they're not really food anyways.

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Eating, eating whole foods that has not been processed is better for you than eating food that's been extra processed.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But frappuccinos have been processed, as delicious as they are.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That's okay, I'll still get my Americano.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Alright, uh, look, we have our chatters, the live chat room every week.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We only have them if they bring me coffee.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Over at the Voice of Geeks Network, vognetwork.com, we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And if you are listening live tonight, first off, thank you, you've chosen us over the Golden Globes.

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And I hope that, I hope that it made...

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You made the smart choice.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah, you made the right choice, so I hope that didn't make you go, oh shit, and turn this off and go turn the Golden Globes on.

70
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Anything you need to see will be on YouTube tomorrow.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Although if you're listening to this on Monday, it's too late.

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's too late, you missed it.

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Haha, you're stuck with us for three hours.

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Alright, anyway, let's see, going to our chat room over at live.vognetwork.com.

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Alan Alchemy says, Sky wants to get a sinus infection in the days before his Seattle trip.

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So don't, don't breathe on me, Jamie.

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
My response is that sinus infections are not contagious.

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's bacteria because of the weirdness in my nose from the flu.

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Fifth Dream in chat says, Starbucks, I'd like a coffee, what's that?

80
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
No, no, no, I'm sorry, that would be Dutch Brothers.

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
No, no, no, Starbucks says, I'd like coffee, do you want it triple burnt?

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I prefer Dunkin Donuts where I get my sugar scoops with a side of coffee.

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
If I'm going to go anywhere, if I'm going to go anywhere for froufrou coffee, I will go to Dutch Brothers.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Do you even have any of those in Sacramento?

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah, there's like five of them.

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Where? All over the place.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Any near me without giving my address away on air?

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Um, there's one on Garfield.

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Oh, well shit, I did not, alright.

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
There's one by my house.

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I was checking Odie and Nirmal this whole time.

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But, but obviously if I'm going to get like actual coffee at a chain, I'm going to go to Pete's.

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah, Pete's is pretty good. Anyway, uh, let's see, Alan Alchemy in chat says,

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Non fat milk for when you don't want coffee black, but also don't want to be farty, bloaty, all fucking day just for some caffeine.

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Thank you. Thank you, Alan Alchemy.

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You have an eloquence with words that sometimes me hosting a radio show for 13 years, I fail with.

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm a milk. I'm a milk latte.

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's okay. It's okay.

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's okay. Alan really likes that stuff. I'm not, I'm not big on that.

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Act Deft and chat says he's watching the Golden Globes while listening to OLR.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
No. No.

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
As long as they're muted.

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Please. I'll put on the mask if I have to and chain you to the wall.

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Make your choice. All right. Uh, anyway, uh, let's get into our show tonight and we'll talk about our gaming weeks, the types of games we've been playing this week.

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But obviously this was a big week over the voice geeks network.

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Uh, we had the vog game jam going on this week, uh, which was the effort to get more people to create things.

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Uh, and we picked a theme a few weeks ago on the show, which was a buggy game through our highly scientific listless process.

108
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Um, a few of you have submitted games. Uh, I saw about seven emails come in, which to be honest, I only thought there was going to be like maybe three.

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:59,000
So the fact that even like we got seven, uh, and that's just the people that remembered to actually send in an official email, which is what you were supposed to do before the deadline for the thing on the forums.

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But I have a feeling we're going to get even more than that in the coming days, uh, because there's a lot of people that weren't able to finish their stuff.

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Like I saw like YYR on Twitter, which is funny enough, YYR kind of inspired this whole idea and he wasn't able to finish his thing just because of IRL stuff, but I'm pretty sure he'll end up submitting something late.

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Um, and Loki, I know your project was extremely ambitious and the deadline has come and gone and...

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I tried and I was super stressed out and tired this entire week.

114
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You tried, Goldstar, you tried.

115
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I just like, you know, try working eight hours after sleeping, only a couple hours a day for two weeks.

116
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yeah. But what's interesting is that, you know, seeing what you have on YouTube and hearing about, I haven't, I haven't seen what you have built in Unity right now, but it seems like you've actually got a game.

117
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's just not to that level that you wanted it to be at right now.

118
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Well, you have a car that can drive around a track.

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Yeah. I've got, I've got that. I've got checkpoints and I just don't have it all hooked together, I guess. And I don't have levels.

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Well, and it's not necessarily a racing game on top of that. Um, that's the funny part about it. It's more like, um, sort of like a WarioWare type of game because basically each level, as I mentioned before, is, um, it's broken in a different way.

121
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And so it's, you know, one level you may have to race to the finish line, you know, in the quickest time. Another level, it may be, oh crap, you have to survive for a certain amount of time or other things that get thrown your way.

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And just, but that sounds very ambitious because you're trying to, you have to, that you have to build each one of those, those different criteria instead of taking just one of them and getting your project.

123
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I see why you didn't finish.

124
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Yeah, I even tried. I was like, okay, well maybe I just scrapped something together real quick, but yeah, it just, it wasn't.

125
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yeah. Um, which, um, you know, and then YYR is in chat room saying that, you know, it was a week to come up with the idea and then a couple of hectic weeks of work.

126
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You know what? I can't pick on YYR because I'm in the same boat is that, you know, I was unable to finish my project because I had my day job stuff come into play, which, you know, I don't make apologies for that.

127
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The day job pays for this. So stuff with that will always come first as policy. I don't talk about, and as you can imagine with a lot of the crap that happened on Twitter in 2014, you can see why I'm not always up front.

128
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Heaven forbid I say something that pisses the wrong person off on this program. So I, I don't really talk about my day job on air, but, um, you know, I had to basically say, I'm not going to get done with the project cause I have the day job in the way, but is, does that mean it was a total failure?

129
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:48,000
No, I don't think so at all because I feel more empowered now than I did a few weeks ago. Um, making a game really felt unattainable. It really did. Like I just like, you know, I can play them and I can comment on them and I can make silly games and games and other games.

130
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But this whole unity thing, I was like, Oh, that's for people that studied computer science in college. That's for, that's for people that have more background than I do.

131
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But I think something I learned through this whole process and I, I think the, you know, once again, the cooking with unity guys who were on about a month ago on the show for this, and I think Loki for this in large part.

132
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I think a lot of you for this as well as that, you know, helping to show that unity is something you can do. So I did download install unity. I had an idea. I started to do some very basic motion things, but unfortunately that's only as far as I could get.

133
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:30,000
My idea was stupid simple though. And I do want to finish it at some point. And in a nutshell, um, my idea was taking and everybody knows the fly swatter game and Mario paint, right? Everybody knows that game. Everybody loves that game.

134
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Uh, I was going to take that concept and reverse it basically that you're the fly and you're trying to dodge all the swatters. Uh, and that was, that was, you know, and I wanted to keep, I wanted to keep it like Atari 2,600 level basic.

135
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Um, and I kinda was fleshing that out when, uh, in one of the very, very early cooking with unity videos, which I was using to really help me, uh, learn the thing we, they were talking about.

136
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You could kind of have like a consistent motion, but you can also have that be altered with what the game pad does. So I wanted the flies movement to be very erratic and difficult to control.

137
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And then that would kind of be the, the bugginess of the game as well as, you know, the fact that it was literally about a bug. So that was my idea. And it was really funny as Loki was like, I could build that in like an hour.

138
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You want me to just do my, do your game for you? And I'm like, wait, no, no, that's not the point. I should have just jacked my idea. I'm like, that's not the point.

139
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That would have, that would have ruined the whole thing. So unfortunately, you know, I don't have anything to present today, but I feel still like there was a success.

140
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:47,000
We've, we've crossed a point that we might not have otherwise. So I'm, I'm happy with that in that regard, but focusing less on the negative of, of me and focusing on the positive of you guys.

141
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm, I'm really happy to see what was submitted out there. And the fact that so many of you participated and funny enough, I saw that the Cooking with Unity guys were participating too.

142
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I don't know what it was they were doing. I didn't watch it because I wanted to be surprised, but I saw that they have several videos chronicling the whole thing from start to finish.

143
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Yeah, that's pretty awesome. I was listening to it while I worked on my game.

144
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Oh, that's so amazing. So what I did do, and here's what I can do because I didn't finish, but I am still, you know, the voice you hear on this show.

145
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And one thing I did promise to do anyway, I'm going to go through each and every game and live stream it and do some playing and some, you know, tongue in cheek feedback, which means obviously I'm not going to be overly harsh to people that have worked very hard to create games.

146
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But I will give, you know, my own sassy commentary on whatever it is you guys have created and, you know, try to at least bring a little attention to the great stuff that you guys did.

147
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And maybe encourage some more people to check them out because it looks like there's some pretty intricate stuff out there.

148
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I have to do it again.

149
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I know. Well, here's the thing. Here's, here's my thing. I refuse to do another game jam. And I haven't even talked to Bobby about this, but this is the way it is in my mind right now.

150
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I will not do another game jam until I finish this one. Period. So you all can do, I will not do another game jam until I finish this one. It's very important. I want to at least do it.

151
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Finishing something is the hardest thing you can do.

152
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It is.

153
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yeah. Since the last 10%, but I haven't even gotten to the last 10% yet. And so, yeah.

154
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm hoping maybe in about a month when things calm down a little bit, because like, honestly, here's the, if I could have, and you know what's funny when Bobby and I were talking about this earlier, what should the day be?

155
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What should the day be? The original time I had suggested was Martin Luther King weekend, which is this next weekend, because then Monday was off work and I could have spent that day playing all the submissions.

156
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Well, now Alan and I are going to Seattle, so that wouldn't have worked either. But if I could have gotten two more weeks, somehow out of that, I could have finished.

157
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So my personal goal is to try and finish it in two weeks. That's my goal, because obviously it won't happen this next weekend with Seattle and everything.

158
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:07,000
But now that things at work have calmed down significantly, I'm hoping in that next week I can finish it, because it's supposed to be a simple concept. So we'll see.

159
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Here it is.

160
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:25,000
All right. Let's see. Going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com. Let's see. PushyPixels in chat says, that's not a great idea. You should do all the jams and make pong first. It helps.

161
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:34,000
No, I don't want to sound like I'm saying, I'm just saying for me personally, I feel awfully stupid endorsing this whole thing when I couldn't even finish myself.

162
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:49,000
But I do, I still feel like I accomplished something. I came out ahead, but it wasn't as much as I would have wanted to do. But I got a paycheck that keeps the show going. That's something that I accomplished.

163
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Anyway. And yyr in chat says, the 80-20 rule, the last 20% of the game takes 80% of the effort. Isn't that the truth?

164
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Well, god damn it. Considering the two that I've worked on, the first few percentages, that's taken a lot of effort, so I can't imagine what the last...

165
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yeah. We'll see. Maybe it depends on the way you did it. Let's see. And some folks in chat, some more comments. BlackWolf says, I learned a lot about the new UI in 4.6. So that's good.

166
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And PushyPixels says, it's great you guys set this thing up. So thank you. Again, I'm loving that there's more participation than I really would have expected.

167
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I honestly would have been blown away if we got three entries. I figured, okay, we'd probably have Bobby, yyr, and we'll have that fringe person I didn't know about that they'll actually end up submitting something.

168
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Like that's what I figured would be the participation in the game jam. But to see all these other people too, and including, there's been more, there's been people that have said,

169
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I listen to OLR, and I've never really participated with the show, but I wanted to do this. That was totally unexpected.

170
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Well that didn't want to impress everybody, so I was like, well I can't just release this, I gotta do something cool.

171
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
See, that's the part where we get stuck.

172
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It is, yeah, because I went back...

173
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I wasn't afraid to put out a shitty game, because honestly if I could have finished the game that simple, and still is important, I want to finish, so that still is important to me, just to say I did it. I did this.

174
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I made this in, because believe me, my first idea was to just do, oh I'll just do something in ZZT, that's my comfort zone, or I'll make something silly in Commodore 64 basic, that's my comfort zone.

175
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But then, Unity seemed more and more like something I could actually do, so there's that.

176
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Anyway, I don't want to spend the whole show talking about coulda, woulda, shoulda, let's focus on the positive, is the fact that so many of these people participated.

177
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm going to play all these games in the coming week, and I'm excited to. There's a really diverse, from what I'm seeing in the screenshots and the titles and emails, a lot of people interpreted that buggy game in various ways.

178
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It seems like most people actually did games about bugs, but certainly it wasn't limited to that. We had, like, Bobby did a moon buggy type of game.

179
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I saw something about a Tetris submission. Again, I haven't played it yet, but there's some type of Tetris submission that's supposed to be buggy, so I'm looking at that, so lots of neat stuff that I can't wait to play.

180
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Alright, let's see, I would like to get into a couple other stories here. More to come on the Jam in the coming weeks.

181
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:42,000
We will not be here live next week, as I've mentioned a few times on the show, and there will actually be no show at all this next week because it's kind of our late holiday break.

182
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
We were here through the holidays, but we're going to take a break next week because I'm going to Seattle.

183
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,000
But in two weeks, we'll be back on the show, and I will give you all my impressions on all the games I played at that point.

184
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So we'll revisit this Jam, at least here on OLR, in a couple weeks. I imagine Bobby will get around to playing everything. He's already played some of them, it sounds like.

185
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,000
He'll probably talk about his impressions on Bobby Blackwell's show next week when we're not here, so you have all that to look forward to.

186
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:18,000
They're not done talking about the VoG Jam just yet, and I know there's going to be more late entries too. It's not just me and Loki. I think YYR still wants to get involved there and so forth.

187
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yeah, go late Jam!

188
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The late Jam!

189
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Alright, let's talk about this. This is another kickoff topic I wanted to get into tonight before we get into our gaming weeks and so forth.

190
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And this is that type of story that's been making the rounds on Facebook and Twitter and all that.

191
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Because I've seen a similar story like this about a dude who goes into a Burger King and there's some screaming kid in there that's screaming about wanting to have a pie.

192
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So what does he do? He buys all the pies so the little screaming, disobedient child can't have any. I know I've seen that story on Facebook before, right?

193
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You guys all know that story I'm talking about? I know I've seen it.

194
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Oh yes.

195
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Yes, right? So this is something similar that happened that has to do with gaming. And there is a Nintendo fan out there that I don't believe has a name. I think his name is Harry. That's it.

196
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Although, that's it. This bitter fan bought 100 Rosalina and Luma amiibo figures just so you couldn't.

197
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:32,000
So he bought all these Rosalina and Luma amiibos in bulk so that way they would be off shelves and that you couldn't have them.

198
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:43,000
The reason why? Quote, I do not appreciate Rosalina appearing in almost every recent Mario game to date. The fact Nintendo promotes her so much and people praise her is just disgusting.

199
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I hate her fans too. I know for a fact her amiibo will be among one of the most popular which is why I took the time to wait and pre-order over 100 of her.

200
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I do not want her fans to be happy. It just crushes me Nintendo from the good days went to this shit for character designs.

201
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:14,000
By the way, this person who has spent $4,000 so far is going to be buying more figures such as Lucina, Palutena, Robin, and Zero Suit Samus are also on the list.

202
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Why do I just have a feeling that this guy has some sort of Nintendo sex dungeon that he's lined these all up on the walls for?

203
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I mean, because I seriously, yes, I hate them so much. I put them up on my walls.

204
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And I just happen to notice, just a casual observation, I don't know if y'all notice this too, I just happen to notice that all those characters this guy apparently has a hate boner for happen to be women.

205
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Is that just a coincidence, right? It can't be that this guy hates women in video games. Surely that can't be it, right?

206
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It pretty much stinks of misogyny.

207
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Hmm. Hmm. Well, now here's another side of this, though, is that is this even real? I mean, because I'm of the mindset where I'm like, okay, it's cute and all that this is on Reddit and making the rounds, but I want to see the receipts.

208
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I want to see I want to see your box full of 100 Rosalina and Luma dolls that's not sitting in the GameStop box, waiting to go on the shelf. I want to see

209
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Where did he order them from?

210
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Apparently Amazon or something like that, but I want to see in your hate dungeon. I want to see your 100 Rosalina. I want to see the receipts because I kind of don't buy this story.

211
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Or I see you burning them because, you know, I get to see this guy, you know, buying a bunch of this stuff and flipping it.

212
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Well, and the other thing is, what an idiot. I mean, not just for the reasons we've already talked about, but what a way to send a message to Nintendo that people just hate Rosalina by making sure she sells out.

213
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
What a way to send that message to Nintendo, you dumbass.

214
00:21:49,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm sure those 100 features that you took off the shelves will be so hard to like manufacture in like a day or two. I mean, it's just, it's stupid. It's not affecting anybody. If you bought all of them, then that would be affecting something, but you bought 100. That's nothing.

215
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Yeah, there's still a whole bunch of Rosalina amiibos on Amazon right now.

216
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
That's like a few cases.

217
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:26,000
And YYR says, you know, and is absolutely right, 100 units is barely a blip on the radar. So I think this thing really just kind of spread around because there's a lot of us kind of looking at this going, what a dummy, if it's even real. And again, I'm just questioning.

218
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:35,000
He's just creating an all female amiibo fight club is what he's doing. It's just getting, he's training them all. He's going to have them fight against each other.

219
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Like actually train them in Super Smash Brothers?

220
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Yes, they're all going to fight each other.

221
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Which by the way, isn't now I don't profess to be a Smash Brothers expert, but my understanding is Rosalina is like top tier, right? Isn't Rosalina like a top tier Smash Brothers character right now? Like she's kind of really good in the game. I don't know. Anyway, let's see.

222
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:06,000
That's why I don't want to talk about this guy. He probably wants attention and he's getting it. Well, here's the nice thing. I haven't said his name. That name I did say was an alias that some of these websites have come up with.

223
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
So I don't know what this guy's name is, nor do I care to know and spread it around on the show.

224
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And I think what he'll probably will do, look out for this, is that if he really did order a hundred of these, if he did, watch for the eBay posting by the Rosalina doll that the dude with the hate boner hat.

225
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:36,000
He'll try to, that's, isn't that the capitalist way to do it? He'll try to spin it and sell those things for a profit because that market is still out there.

226
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Yeah, it's just like the people that, you know, back, you know, my son is grounded, so I'm selling his guitar hero controller and it sells for like $500 and it's like, so it's worth $10 selling for like $500.

227
00:23:49,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Yeah. So anyway, I think we can all agree that this guy is a bit of a moron and, you know, unless, now if the goal out of this was to create a story, a fake story that would go viral, then congrats you won because here is the entire internet sharing it on Facebook and talking about it.

228
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:26,000
So if that was the goal, then good job. But, uh, I have a feeling there's probably like half a hint of truth to it. I think somebody out there really does have the hate boner for, um, all these female characters, which you probably need to have examined for a completely different reason related to buying all the amiibo.

229
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,000
But I, I don't, I don't believe that all the amiibo have been purchased. Just because they've been pre-ordered as well doesn't mean they've been purchased.

230
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:45,000
So just throwing it out there. But if you show me all the dolls lined up in your hate basement, then I guess we can have a conversation. Come on the show and let's, let's talk about it. Let's talk about your many issues if you'd like.

231
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:56,000
All right. Anyhow, uh, let's get into our gaming weeks, the types of video games we have been playing this week. Uh, let's go around the room and check in. Dark Soccer, what have you been playing this week?

232
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Uh, Little Borderlands. Um, I've been playing, uh, Fractal. Um, I actually got back in Final Fantasy XIV and a little bit of Dragon Age. Um, I actually forced myself to play it when I had a raging headache, just because I hadn't played any in a few days.

233
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I'm still putting off the, the heartbreaking step on my heart, rip it out, throw it across a cow field full of shit part of the game. Because-

234
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
No spoilers.

235
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Because of my romance option.

236
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Although I can kind of piece it together what's happening here. It's kind of, kind of obvious, but anyway.

237
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Well, are you going to romance them?

238
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Probably not.

239
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Okay then.

240
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Some of the listeners might be though.

241
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Well, if, trust me, it's, it's-

242
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I would think anyone that has that much care over it's probably already played through the game. That's my thought. But anyway, so there you go. Uh, Loki, how about you? How was your gaming week?

243
00:25:51,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Um, really all I played is, uh, just a little bit of, um, League of Marvel Superheroes. Just because my son wants me to play with him.

244
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Although, the last few days while he's been playing I've been sleeping on the couch trying to catch up on some of my sleep.

245
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:15,000
But, uh, I did get a little bit of it in and I managed to get him to play a level so I could finally 100% that level.

246
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:24,000
But, how's he going to play it when he goes to bed so I can, you know, because I'm at 75% complete with the game so I'll just platinum it. It's super easy.

247
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And then we'll be done with that. Well, as far as I'm concerned, I'll be done with it.

248
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
And then I was just working on my game job, so.

249
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Yeah. Alright.

250
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Uh, my gaming week was a little slow this week. Um, obviously, if I didn't have time to work on the project I didn't really have a lot of time to play games either.

251
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,000
So that really ended up being the case. I haven't played any role. There's one new game that I played this week and it's not really even a new game.

252
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Uh, so what I will mention is that, uh, and some of you have probably seen this by now.

253
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
But, uh, Wednesday night after Horde House I finally gave in to all the people that are like,

254
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Rob, when are you going to fucking play Five Nights at Freddy's and do the livestream?

255
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So Shane came over and it took us like 30 minutes just to set up my other studio.

256
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I have this studio here, N7, then I have the satellite studio that I actually do all my computer gaming in and livestreaming.

257
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:21,000
And I set that all up for the external sound which was harder to do than you'd think because I had to get it to be a decent volume.

258
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
So finally after 30 minutes of setting that up we were able to play a little bit of Five Nights at Freddy's.

259
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:33,000
So I finally played that game for the first time and it's all chronicled on YouTube, uh, over on my YouTube channel Rob Roberts Plays.

260
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
And did the game scare me? Yep. Yep. I got tricked into a couple jump scares.

261
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Uh, that frickin' Chica or whatever her name is got me twice during the livestream.

262
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And, uh, what a silly game.

263
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:53,000
But, you know, I gotta say, uh, an extraordinarily, I mean, this goes back to, you know, to bring it full circle with the game jam.

264
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
What an extraordinarily simple concept, really.

265
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Um, you know, watching these security cameras and making sure that the monsters don't really get closer to your room.

266
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Where you're, uh, where you're, um, you know, uh, gonna get eaten if they get to you and you don't shut the door or whatever in time.

267
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:20,000
The one thing I never really truly understood, the one thing I never really truly understood about the game was, what's the point of the cameras?

268
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Because you just want to make sure they don't get in the doors.

269
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,000
So couldn't you just sit there the entire time and just check the lights, check the lights, check the lights.

270
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
And then finally, if you see somebody in the room, like, about to come in the room, just shut the door.

271
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Like, I never really understood what the advantage is to cycling through the different cameras.

272
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
You don't really seem to slow them down or anything by doing that.

273
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I don't think they can move when the camera's on them.

274
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Yeah, but considering there's more than one, there's always at least one person that should be moving.

275
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
So why not always check the doors?

276
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Now, I think there's something to do specifically with the Fox character, where starting on night three, he will run into your room and you may not have time to see him if you don't check the camera.

277
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:10,000
But one guy, and this is always interesting, depending on what game I stream, I sometimes get people that have no idea, you know, of the podcast I do or who I am.

278
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Just people that like to watch streams of people playing the game.

279
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And one guy came into the room and was like, yeah, all I ever do is I check Pirate's Cove, which is where Foxy hides out.

280
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I go Cove, light, light, and just repeat.

281
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
That was my strategy and that's how I get all the way to like the end of night five.

282
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
And I'm like, well, that kind of makes the game a little silly at that point, doesn't it?

283
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Like, it kind of takes all the point out of it.

284
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So I just feel like, and I'm sure the chat room is yelling at me here, so I'm going to go to them in a minute here over at live.vognetware.com.

285
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:46,000
It just seems to me that, like, there's something wrong with the balance of the game if it's that easy.

286
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:53,000
But I don't know. But there is, I will say this, then Shane was trying to explain to me, oh, there's all this lore behind the game.

287
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:01,000
You got to go watch these game theory YouTubes about how it's all a parallel to this guy that killed all these people at a Chuck E. Cheese.

288
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
And then it leads into the second game and you find out all this stuff.

289
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
And I'm just like, wow, there is, like, people really read a lot into this game.

290
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,000
But it does seem like the designer has left little hints in the game.

291
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Like, that game theory thing I watch does make an awful lot of sense, even if they backtrack on a lot of it when they talk about the second game.

292
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
But anyway, I didn't think it was very interesting.

293
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Going to the chat room over at live.vognetware.com, VidPower says,

294
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Foxy will run at you full speed if you don't check on the cameras on him.

295
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Actf says, and Foxy is a must to watch for the camera.

296
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Actf says, that's my strategy, although I do check the door cams just in case.

297
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
And the lore is actually quite fascinating.

298
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Kaijuto says, if you use too much power, you are fucked, so you need to check the cams to make sure you use power when they're close.

299
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Okay, but didn't the cams use power too?

300
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I thought, or can you just unlimited use the camera? The cameras don't really use any power.

301
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
If that's the case, then that makes a little more sense.

302
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
And I thought, I thought that might have been it.

303
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And Alan Alchemy in chat says, these are probably things they fixed in part two and three.

304
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
My understanding is that the mechanic is totally different in part two, that there is no door.

305
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:16,000
That there's just the front that they can, like, jump, but you put a mask on instead.

306
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Like, they totally changed it in two, and I'm sure they'll change some of the basic stuff in three as well.

307
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Well, because two's supposed to be a prequel, so.

308
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Yeah, well, but again, that's never really explicitly stated.

309
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Yeah, it is.

310
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
That's just the whole game theory stuff.

311
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
No, it's the date on the check. Remember, the unit said that in game theory.

312
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Oh, alright, alright, alright.

313
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Your paycheck's a different date.

314
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
So that's only if you beat it that you really find that out, that it's prequel.

315
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Yeah.

316
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
There's that.

317
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Alright.

318
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
And then Act F says, no, cams do drain the energy.

319
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
That was the, the cams don't drain the energy?

320
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I thought, alright, anyway.

321
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Why don't we just shut down some of the cameras and, like, put the energy.

322
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,000
How about we just shut down all the cameras, put all the energy into the doors, and done.

323
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
So, you know what, I will say this much.

324
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
As much as it sounds like I'm talking negative about the game, I'm really not.

325
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I'm just biased because I don't really like the jump scare stuff because I'm such a baby.

326
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
But I will say this, you know, massive kudos to the developer because, as I understand,

327
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:15,000
it's just one guy with a pretty crazy simple concept that I'm sure is making buku bucks.

328
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
This, this thing, well, maybe not a ton of ton of it, but it's always, like, number one

329
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
on the iOS store for iPad and all that stuff.

330
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I know he's doing well there and I see a ton of let's plays on this on Steam and stuff.

331
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:33,000
He's got to be doing well with this game with what is a pretty simple idea fleshed out.

332
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
So, good for him. Good for him.

333
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
And people...

334
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,000
It'll be 100% better whatever Miyamoto's coming up with with his Project Watch.

335
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I'm telling you, it's like one dude making this game.

336
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I can tell it's going to be way better than watching Rob the Robot storm something.

337
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I don't know.

338
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Rob the Robot could be really creepy in a Five Nights at Freddy's game.

339
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
You never know. You never know.

340
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Alright, so you think that's what Miyamoto's working on as a Five Nights at Freddy's ripoff?

341
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Because I'm sure those are all incoming.

342
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Just like the Minecraft ripoffs, now that Five Nights at Freddy's is number one on the iOS store,

343
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I'm sure it's just a matter of time if it's not already happening before all the poorly made knockoffs start flowing in.

344
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
You know, three nights at Thelma's.

345
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I'm sure all these freaking knockoffs are just about to happen.

346
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Three Thursdays at Thelma's.

347
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Alright.

348
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Five Tuesdays with Maureen.

349
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
That's kind of dark.

350
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Alright, let's get into, now that we're done with our gaming week, some quick housekeeping.

351
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Follow us on Facebook. Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.

352
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
We're also on Twitter. Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

353
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
And as a reminder, there is no show at all next week, January 18th.

354
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
We are taking the week off. A late holiday break.

355
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:58,000
But a happy Martin Luther King observance day to those of you in the States, because we'll be missing that.

356
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
And maybe see some of you in Seattle.

357
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I don't know how many listeners we have up there, but if any are up there, I will be in your neighborhood.

358
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Yes, even when it's not PAX.

359
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
But I love Seattle.

360
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I've been there a few times. You know, we all went to Seattle.

361
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
That was the one road trip we all took together, although it was really a fly trip.

362
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
There was a limo involved.

363
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
That's right, there was a limo involved.

364
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
That was our diva trip to PAX.

365
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
That was a really fun time, though.

366
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:35,000
That wasn't just us. That was when we were with the All Games Network and there was really kind of a convergence of all those indie podcasters there at PAX.

367
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
You know, Bobby was involved, too, and a lot of other people with the network. That was a lot of fun.

368
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
So we had some great Seattle memories of that.

369
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:47,000
And then I went five years ago, funny enough, with Grandpa from Hoard House.

370
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:53,000
And this was long before his persona on that show was established and any of that before he was a podcaster and all that.

371
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
We went to Seattle together and had a great old time.

372
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
So I'm looking forward to going back and going to all the tourist traps and all the fun stuff.

373
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
But I'm going to tell you what, that football game better not get in the damn way.

374
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Because that's something I realized last night is, oh shit, the Seahawks are in the playoffs now.

375
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Which I'm happy for. I've been everything, but it's going to make the town crazy on Saturday.

376
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
No thank you. No thank you.

377
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Alright, so no show. We will be back with a show two weeks from tonight on January 25th.

378
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Hopefully for those of you that have a little podcast void next week, I hope you will fill the time with some other hardworking indie podcasters out there.

379
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Of which there are lots and lots and lots of hardworking folks out there that will have shows for you next week.

380
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
So check them out.

381
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Alright, let's get into some gaming news and what has been going on in the industry this week.

382
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Not as busy of a week as we were expecting coming off of the holiday, but still a few big stories here and there nonetheless.

383
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Starting with Loki.

384
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Yes, so PlayStation Now is starting up a subscription program, which is kind of cool.

385
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I mean, since the pricing of it was really ridiculous in the first place.

386
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Although it is a little bit on the pricey side, so don't give up your membership to Gamefly anytime soon.

387
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,000
But apparently you can choose from some different subscription plans, including one month for $19.99.

388
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Or three months for $14.99, which ends up being about $15 a month.

389
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And with that you get basically unlimited streaming for all the games that are on the service.

390
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,000
So I think they have about 100 right now.

391
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
So it's all of them, not just select games. That's pretty rad.

392
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Yeah, it's all of them. All you can play.

393
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:44,000
It's cool, I guess, if you really can dedicate a lot of time to get your money's worth out of it.

394
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:51,000
But I think it sounds like a great deal, but how much are you really going to be playing each month?

395
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
For $15 a month, that's pretty expensive.

396
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I don't know, just imagine spending that on Steam games. You'd probably get a lot further with your money.

397
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I'm of a couple mindsets about this. I actually think this is the feature a lot of people have been asking for.

398
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I think some people are struggling with the price, so you really have to ask, is it a fair price?

399
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I have a hard time hating on the price, honestly.

400
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Games are always going to be a little more expensive than movies, so that's why it's about twice the cost of Netflix.

401
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Twice the cost of Netflix, isn't it? Not even that, though. I'm kind of okay with that.

402
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Because, yes, there's a place for Gamefly too. Gamefly can do more things, and comparable services.

403
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Here's my thing.

404
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,000
The immediacy of what this is going to be able to provide is that you will not have to wait.

405
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:57,000
If you want to play any game in this virtual library right now, you're going to be able to do that.

406
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
That's hard to hate. I do think there's a lot of value with that.

407
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:10,000
The fact that, yeah, you're paying for this, but that's going to be 150 games right now, whenever you want.

408
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:19,000
The only thing that's a little bit of a negative is it's 150 games, of which maybe 10 are good and 140 are filler.

409
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
That's a little more of the concerning part.

410
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
One positive I see is that, one, you can play that on your PlayStation 4.

411
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:32,000
A lot of these, you can't play PlayStation 3 games on your PlayStation 4, so it gives you that.

412
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
But just looking at the titles that they have on there, a lot of these I already have in my PlayStation Plus library.

413
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
So if you have a PlayStation 3, it's kind of like, why do you need this?

414
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Because PlayStation Plus, if you've had it for a while and have gotten these games, like I know Infamous I got from the whole PlayStation Network deal.

415
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Red Faction Collection, I've had, god, those games have been so cheap.

416
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Darksiders I've gotten before. Saints Row 2, Bioshock Infinite.

417
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:08,000
I mean, there's a ton of these games I already have, so it wouldn't make any sense for me to do this service.

418
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:16,000
And I think if you boil it down to what you want to actually play, you can probably go buy these games cheaper.

419
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:23,000
You won't get hundreds of games, but you can probably go out there and buy these games you use for a lot cheaper than paying $15 a month.

420
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
You get a game a month or something, or a couple of games a month.

421
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Now, Bobby's being very adamant in chat and is showing the receipts here by linking to this list here from the PlayStation forums about how it is not everything that's on the service now.

422
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:45,000
There is a distinctive list between what you can rent and what is actually included when you subscribe to all games.

423
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Such as, for example, I notice, I'm just looking at the list real quick, Final Fantasy XIII is on both lists, but XIII-2 is not included in the subscription list.

424
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
So, there's that. I mean, there are some games that are missing.

425
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:11,000
So now, now that further refines the question, I think, to, you know, is the $15 a month or whatever worth it for these specific games?

426
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:18,000
And you really have to kind of look at that list of what's available and say, do I want to be able to play these all for a month for $15?

427
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
And here's the other thing that's about that, too, is if you notice, like, I'm...

428
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Whatever it is. Sorry, maybe not $15. What was the amount again? $18?

429
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
It was $19.99 a month for $24.99 for three months.

430
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Okay, then is this worth $20 for a month?

431
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I just think it's not, just because of the amount of...

432
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
First off, the amount of stuff that they've already given away for free on PlayStation Plus.

433
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
So, if you're like me and you just grab everything regardless of...

434
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Because I had a Vita at one time, I still grab stuff for the Vita, because someday I may get a Vita again.

435
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I just want to have that stuff in my library.

436
00:40:52,000 --> 00:41:02,000
So, I've got a ton of these between this and my Xbox, you know, games with gold stuff and with my Steam library, which has got most of these games already.

437
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,000
There's not much for me to play on this, and on top of that, I just...

438
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I don't know, I just don't see it being worthwhile to pay that kind of fee.

439
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I'll notice, or I did notice that there are no EA games on that list, because those are part of that, you know, EA package thing that you pay $30 a year.

440
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:27,000
And, hey, $30 a year doesn't sound so bad now when you compare it to $19.99 a month.

441
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Well, but again, it's what games, because I'm sure the EA list is much more...

442
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And if you're not a sports game fan, that's even less.

443
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Yeah, true. I would just look at what games you want to play and what games they're offering.

444
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:47,000
And honestly, you might be better off just saying, okay, hey, if there's only like a handful of games you want to play, go buy them.

445
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I mean, because you might end up, or rent them.

446
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Here's the thing, though, is that, you know, as well, and I'm trying to kind of remain a little bit hopeful about this, is that, okay, maybe that's the way this looks now.

447
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:07,000
But surely Sony plans to add to this, you know, and we know that PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 1, these are things that Sony wants to be able to offer on PlayStation Now.

448
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
It's things they've talked about being available on PlayStation Now that we haven't seen yet.

449
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I want to see...

450
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
So I imagine in the next year, this will be further enhanced with PS1 and PS2 games, which would be great.

451
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Well, that's cool.

452
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Especially if there's trophy support.

453
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:27,000
That's cool and all, but what I would like to see is just my fucking games that I have in my library being able to be streamed over PlayStation Now.

454
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Because I see Saints Row 4 on there, I see Saints Row 2, I see, you know, Darksiders.

455
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
And these are games you bought digitally.

456
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
These are games that I have, well, I didn't buy them, but they're games that they gave to me, you know, digitally, so...

457
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Oh, oh, alright.

458
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
You know, Saints Row III are just all these different games on here.

459
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I would love to be able to play those on my PlayStation 4 instead of having to, you know, break out the PlayStation 3 to play these games.

460
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Since you obviously can stream that, and it's obviously tied to the PlayStation Network, so don't tell me you can't tell that,

461
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
oh, I'm sorry, our systems don't talk to each other, you know, we can't figure out what you purchased.

462
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I would like to see some of that, that would be great.

463
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:11,000
But I would, I do also think that, you know, if you look at something like Netflix, where all the license and rights semantics aside,

464
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:16,000
because I know Netflix used to have more on it that they don't have because, you know, it's like an EA thing, right?

465
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Where they wanted to go off and make their own thing.

466
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,000
But, you know, Netflix has now been enhanced with things like Orange is the New Black and, you know, kind of their own programming.

467
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
So I'm curious to see what Sony's going to enhance this with in the future.

468
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Maybe right now this doesn't look like the most attractive deal, although again, I suppose it depends on what sort of PS3 games you're into.

469
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I don't know, I have to admit, for 20 bucks, being able to play it on demand, eh, there is a lot in this list I think I could probably get 20 bucks worth out of at least for one month.

470
00:43:48,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Would I do a continuing thing? Not right now, but I'd be very curious to see what Sony might do month to month to make people that jump on early on want to stay subscribed.

471
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
And that could even be things like exclusives.

472
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I wouldn't shut the door on the fact that Sony might offer something exclusive to folks on PlayStation Now that maybe you can't get anywhere else.

473
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:21,000
That could be the PlayStation 1 and 2 games, because right now they're not selling 1 and 2 games on the PlayStation 4 save VIB, no, not even Vibram is on 4 yet.

474
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
You had to buy that on 3. So, it'd be interesting.

475
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I don't know, I'm not jumping into this yet, because like I said, I've got my Steam library, and I've got libraries that are starting to get to the size of Steam on the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Marketplace.

476
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
So, I just don't need extra games.

477
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:50,000
yyrinchat says, I think it's most worth it to people that never owned a PS3 or an Xbox 360.

478
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
It's worth noting that many of the subscription games are not PlayStation 3 exclusives.

479
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:03,000
He brings up a good point. There are a lot of people that kind of skipped the last generation or owned a Nintendo Wii in their household who might be PS4 owners now.

480
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
So, that's an interesting point. Could be a catch-up type of thing.

481
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Brad from Pod Culture says, make it $15 a month, include Plus as a part of it, and I would be sold. More like an Amazon Prime model.

482
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:29,000
I don't think Sony would put it that low. I suppose anything's possible, but I like that idea of one package for both, and surely Sony's got to be thinking it too.

483
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:38,000
Like, what about a PlayStation Plus Plus? What would you call that? PlayStation Plus Gold, or PlayStation Plus Platinum, something like that.

484
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Where maybe you have a Plus account that's further enhanced with this, that's a package deal. I'm sure that's something they've got to be thinking.

485
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I just don't think it's ever going to get that low. I mean, it'd be great if it could. I'm just being realistic.

486
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,000
You know, no one would get me to maybe get in on that. They do their own version of, like, Game Room.

487
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Oh, don't get me started. Don't get me started. Bad memories. Bad memories. I'm so upset. Alright, anyhow.

488
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
So, there you go. What if Nintendo did that, with all their virtual console games?

489
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Oh my god, they should. Oh my god, they're sitting on a gold mine. They could totally do that, but then again, Nintendo's making pretty good money just selling piecemeal right now.

490
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Well, yeah, they're selling ROMs for $5 a piece.

491
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:25,000
People aren't demanding it from Nintendo the same way they have been of Sony.

492
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:33,000
They do a little bit. I'm not saying people don't demand that from Nintendo, but Nintendo also doesn't have the streaming thing. That's the big difference.

493
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
PlayStation's now doing the streaming thing and is selling these individual stream games.

494
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:47,000
And so people, you know, because we all know Netflix and Amazon Prime and Hulu and all that stuff, people think, well, I'm used to paying one fee to access all that.

495
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Why is PlayStation using a different model? So I think that's how Nintendo's been able to avoid it a little bit.

496
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Even if Nintendo can stream a virtual console game, there's like a few megs.

497
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Like on any internet, even crappy DSLers, it's like, okay, let's buffer that. Oh, done. Games downloaded.

498
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I'm actually not disagreeing with you, but I also feel like there's more that Nintendo could do to virtual console that they're not doing, such as internet play.

499
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:22,000
I still do that because those are such low, you know, little itty bitty ROMs. I still, I don't know why this is not a thing.

500
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:31,000
And I've said this on the show before. Why don't you have games that are two player games that you can play against each other?

501
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Like, I don't know, what are some big NES classics that were like head to head? Like the original Mario Brothers even, right? It was kind of a head to head game, right?

502
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Why can't you have that where you're playing it on the TV and on the gamepad, you can see video of the person you're playing against?

503
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
How hard? Privacy.

504
00:47:51,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Okay, but make it friends. You only get, make it, if you're playing with strangers, it's an avatar. And if you're playing with friends, it's video. Done.

505
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
No.

506
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Why not?

507
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I wouldn't want to be on video.

508
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Who cares? It's fine.

509
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Then shut it off. Make it optional. You don't have to stream video, but you can.

510
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:16,000
It's probably because they don't have a way to like, they don't have a very good system as far as being able to play with friends on things.

511
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I mean, Mario Kart, I mean, they have it, it seemed like for me, at least on the Wii, because I don't have a Wii U, that it was very much like each game kind of handled that differently as far as being able to play with your friends.

512
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,000
So, maybe they just don't have a good system, or they don't have a system in place for that.

513
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I mean, I don't think you can start up like a party like you can on PlayStation or Xbox.

514
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Start up a party with people and they're okay, we're gonna launch, you know, this game.

515
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:50,000
We're gonna launch, you know, Mario Kart or something and it boots into that with everybody joining the game and, you know, all playing together.

516
00:48:50,000 --> 00:49:00,000
YYR in chat says, don't worry, Nintendo will catch up to Xbox 360 PS3 as far as network features by the time the next generation of consoles is released.

517
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
I look forward to it.

518
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,000
YYR also says, hey kid, send me a friend code if you want to see my dick. I guess there's that.

519
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:13,000
But, I mean, at some point you have to put the onus for that not on the company, but on the predator.

520
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
And I understand that Nintendo had some issues with that and that's why they shut off PictoChat.

521
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:23,000
But at the same time, how hard is it, you know, hey kid, let me get your cell phone number and I'll text you pictures of my dick.

522
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Or, hey kid, how about your Skype name? And, you know, we can look at dicks.

523
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Yeah, in PictoChat, they have to draw pictures of their dick, so it was a little bit more difficult.

524
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Well, you could actually send pictures in PictoChat, remember? Because I always used to send pictures of the cat.

525
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
No, that wasn't PictoChat. That was the other one, Swap Note.

526
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Oh, sorry. Swap Note was the thing they disabled. That was the thing I missed.

527
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Swap Note was awesome, and I sent 3D pictures of the cat all the time to my friend list.

528
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:57,000
But see, that's the thing though, it's like PictoChat. That was a brilliant, brilliant idea for, like, the DS.

529
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Everybody at Expos, I went to her.

530
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
It's like this moment of brilliance, and then it's like they don't ever do anything with it.

531
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,000
It's just like, hey, this is a really great idea. Cool, keep having those.

532
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I know, I know.

533
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
It's like, well, just don't stop now.

534
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I know.

535
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:20,000
My point is, is that Nintendo, I understand Nintendo's really, really, really overcautious about, you know, their image in the media,

536
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:27,000
and they don't want the media reporting on these things about, like, you know, all these dicks we're seeing on a child's 3DS in the Swap Note application,

537
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:32,000
but it's like, well, check the kid's phone. It's probably there too. Check the kid's email.

538
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I mean, unfortunately, we need to focus on getting this act of predators doing this to children to stop.

539
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
You know what I mean?

540
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,000
They're going to find a way to do it no matter what, you know, it's going to be cell phones or Nintendo.

541
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,000
That's not the core issue.

542
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Maybe if people would stop supporting sensationalized news reporting.

543
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
There is that too. There is that too. Anyhow.

544
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:08,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange On Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase IDEA.

545
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Alright, let's move on. We've got to talk about some other things, and this is actually some pretty big news from Nintendo this week.

546
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:24,000
By the way, speaking of things Nintendo swore up and down they would never do, and now we're seeing them dip their toe in the water with this, kinda.

547
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:31,000
This was some very surprising, very big news that came out this week, and you might have missed it because it has to do with cell phone gaming.

548
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:37,000
You might have just glossed it over and not paid it any attention, but I'm telling you, this is huge.

549
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:42,000
There's a game series out there you may or may not have played. It's available on iPhones and Androids and all that.

550
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,000
It's called Puzzle and Dragons. I think this game's awful. I've tried playing it. I think it's stupid.

551
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I think there's far better games out there on the mobile phones. I would rather play Trivia Crack, honestly, which is also kind of stupid.

552
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:01,000
That is a game I've also been playing this week, by the way. A lot of Trivia Crack. But it's a good micro game.

553
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:08,000
It's a good game you can play for five seconds, then move on, right? I'm not a big fan of Puzzle and Dragons, but I can't deny this game is huge.

554
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:15,000
It's kind of like Bejeweled meets Pokemon. I'm really oversimplifying it, but that's kind of what it is.

555
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:30,000
This game series is really big in Japan. Apparently, in some of the Asian regions, it's even bigger than it is here. It's a huge deal.

556
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:43,000
And GungHo is the company that actually creates this game. Well, GungHo has actually announced that there is going to be a Super Mario edition of Puzzle and Dragons.

557
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:59,000
It's going to be on the 3DS in Japan this April. But I still think there's something very interesting here, where you've got Nintendo partnering up with a company that is most well-known for cell phone gaming.

558
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Granted, it's being made for the 3DS, but like I said, it's the big toe.

559
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:19,000
But they did something similar, though. It wasn't that. It was the Square Enix, almost like a Mario Party-type game. But they teamed up with them to do a version of that with Mario.

560
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Now, as far as an American release, even though in the original announcement, GungHo America said it would be happening through Nintendo, a Nintendo spokesperson told another outlet that Puzzle and Dragons Super Mario Bros. Edition is a Japanese-only announcement.

561
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
So right now, the America release of this is still in flux.

562
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Yeah, until they announce it at E3.

563
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Right. The Match 3 game has local multiplayer and StreetPass functionality. By the way, the original Mobile Puzzle and Dragons has 6 million downloads in North America.

564
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Wow, that's a lot.

565
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Is it because it's free?

566
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Yes, I'm sure.

567
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Oh my god! There's 6 million downloads of a free game! That's unheard of! Oh, wait.

568
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I'm one of those downloads and I deleted it a long time ago.

569
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Yeah, of course. There's no way to lose in that scenario. You try it, you hate it, then you delete it. It's not that impressive.

570
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Now, there has been a Puzzle and Dragons already released for 3DS. This Puzzle and Dragons Z that had 1.5 million units sold in Japan. That's still pretty good. This is the first time that they're involving the Mario stuff.

571
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Just to say, Act F to say Fortune Street is the game you're trying to think of?

572
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Yes, that was the game I was thinking of. Fortune Street.

573
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:46,000
And Rama says Puzzle and Dragons is pretty fun. They actually have a DC Comics version of that game. I guess that makes sense because Marvel has the Puzzle Quest thing, so it's DC lined up with somebody else. Very interesting.

574
00:54:46,000 --> 00:55:04,000
So, we will see. Also, of note, apparently Nintendo's stock really liked, the investors really liked this news. The stock went way, way, way up at the end of the week this week after that announcement came up.

575
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:12,000
But, they're not making a mobile game. They're putting a mobile game onto the 3DS. That's dumb. That's like putting Angry Birds on the 3DS.

576
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:20,000
I think because people are looking at this going, Nintendo's partnering with a mobile phone company. If this game's successful, could the reverse happen?

577
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:33,000
They're not and they won't because there's been several mobile games that have been popular that have come to the 3DS and that's it. People will buy it because there's Mario in it. That's it.

578
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I mean, you know, just like Angry Birds, still okay. Doodle Jump kind of. But, it's not news. If they were going to put out that version on mobile, that would be a big story. This is just kind of like, eh, whatever.

579
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Well, it'll be interesting to see if that happens later on. I don't think it's outside the realm of all possibility and I think that's why investors are really taking to this news.

580
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Is that if GungHo is going to be spending the time making this game, that perhaps it will be something on mobile devices. And that could be huge. Huge!

581
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Because all we have Nintendo-wise on mobile devices right now is what? A Pokédex? Which, the Pokémon company is a second party, so it's a little different.

582
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Yeah, they won't because it's going to cheapen their brand if they put it out as a free-to-play game. That's the way they see it.

583
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Alright, well we will see what develops. I still think this is a pretty big news, all things considered.

584
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
DarkStalker, what do you have for us?

585
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Well, I've been a little bit lax in some of my UK news as of late, so I do have something for our folks overseas.

586
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:46,000
The BBC is actually looking for developer studios to do video games based on some of its more popular series.

587
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:55,000
They are visiting a London Mobile Games event later on in this month to look for developers.

588
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:05,000
They want to do things for Doctor Who and Sherlock. They also are wanting to look into some of the past and future IPs as well.

589
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:15,000
They're going to be doing two breakfast sessions on Tuesday, January 20th and Wednesday, January 21st, both between 9 to 10 AM.

590
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:23,000
And they're informal, they just want to meet people, and it's going to be held at BBC Worldwide at 33 Foley Street, London.

591
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:32,000
So if any of our developer friends happen to be over there, let us know how that goes. We want to know.

592
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,000
I have something else for our British fans too.

593
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,000
What?

594
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
I need you all to vote for Michelle Visage to win Celebrity Big Brother.

595
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Oh my god, Rob.

596
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:51,000
No, this is very important. I need you all to vote for Michelle Visage, and I know you all don't like Katie Hopkins, and I completely understand why,

597
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:58,000
but if she's the only one that's going to put that little celebrity blogger, I won't even say his name because it offends me,

598
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:06,000
if she's the only one that will put that guy in his place, then I think you should keep her around too, as disgusting as a lot of the stuff is that she says outside the house.

599
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
But at the end of the day, Michelle Visage should win.

600
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Just a very important note, this is a life or death scenario that I need our British listeners to get involved with.

601
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Rob. Rob.

602
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
What?

603
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Rob. Rob. Rob.

604
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:30,000
What? What? Oh, oh, oh. You can all wank about Doctor Who and Sherlock and the potential games, but heaven forbid I bring up the British show I like and.

605
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:45,000
No, I was like, I was like, I want them to do a Top Gear racing game, but with like all of the commentary done by Jeremy What's His Face, because he's so dry and funny.

606
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:52,000
He'd like make comments like, you know, just how badly people drift and stuff. I just want nothing but a game of him shitting on the player.

607
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Top Gear was a racing game. I used to love that game. It was on the Super Nintendo.

608
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Then, of course, we talk about British narrators and I my mind, it goes instantly to Stephen Fry, who is also in the news this last week.

609
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I'm sure you saw a little bit about that. That was that was interesting, although I don't think it's as big of a deal as people were making it out to be.

610
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:18,000
But whatever. Anyway, sorry, Jamie, I took a very legitimate game develop story and turn it into gossip, but, you know, it happens.

611
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Let's move on with some more news, Loki.

612
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:31,000
So apparently the avatars on Xbox are going to be getting a makeover.

613
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:36,000
They're possibly going to be coming back, I guess, to the Xbox One.

614
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:43,000
And I don't know exactly. I guess they're going to show it off as part of like Windows 10 maybe.

615
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:49,000
And cool, I guess I saw my I have my 3D printed avatar.

616
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,000
So now that's not going to be accurate anymore.

617
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
I don't know. I don't know what I think about that.

618
00:59:53,000 --> 01:00:01,000
And also, you know what, I'm kind of curious to see how that's going to look, because remember, I think they kind of showed something similar with was it Mass Effect three?

619
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
You know, like all the Mass Effect games got better and better.

620
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,000
But sometimes your character looked weirder and weirder as it like enhanced it.

621
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,000
If you know what I mean, because she's she's the one to ask about those mods and things like that.

622
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:19,000
That's pretty accurate. Like, you know, just like some of them I've seen, like, you know, hey, wait, I used to be a different skin color.

623
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Oh, like how it would import look how big her eyes are.

624
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Oh, yeah. The imports of your character from one into two were always awful.

625
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:33,000
And it's like Mike, like my character looked great in one. And then when I imported him into two, it was like, why is he so surprised?

626
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:41,000
And then why is like completely different for a lot of the subjects? They changed the they added more vertices in the facial structure.

627
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I follow you now. Yeah. The import from game to game was horrible.

628
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:50,000
You were better off just recreating Shepard the way you wanted him or her to look in each game.

629
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
And I got to be honest, I got to be honest. You know what?

630
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
They're trying to make avatars a thing, but it's important and relevant. I'm so sorry.

631
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,000
I'm so sorry to interrupt. Important and relevant. The same thing is happening in World of Warcraft.

632
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:08,000
OK, because they took all the old characters. Right. And they they took like dwarves and humans and gave them new models. Right.

633
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:15,000
OK, I can tell you my character when they did that looks awful. Awful. Like, I hate the way she looks now.

634
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
I have to see if my character is any different.

635
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Oh, so that's the one downside to these upgrades is that they're usually downgrades in high definition.

636
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Yeah. Basically, they're saying that they're going to ensure that avatars are not only gorgeous, but also highly performant across a wide scale of devices and work with designers, animators and artists and blah, blah, blah.

637
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:46,000
You know, to be honest, any of the avatar kind of features I've seen didn't do a whole ton of the avatar stuff with the actual mainstream games.

638
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,000
I saw a lot of the stuff that supported avatars coming out of like the Xbox indie games.

639
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Yeah, that's true.

640
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:57,000
And a lot of that seemed to be a little bit more interesting than, say, you know, the official stuff.

641
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Yes, like the baby launching game that was on it. Wasn't it your avatar that was giving birth or something like that? Or were you the baby? I don't know.

642
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I seem to remember avatars were in that baby launching game that was on the 360.

643
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
That's awesome, though.

644
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Which next to Bungie ferret tossing is an all time great on the Xbox Live indie games.

645
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,000
There's lots of great indie games, but that's what I'm saying. I don't know.

646
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I guess it's cool that they're coming back, but it's just it didn't really take off like the Miis did. And even the Miis are kind of stupid. Like, they shouldn't really upgrade those.

647
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:37,000
But the Miis are still around and they're very much used in a lot of the Nintendo games.

648
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,000
They're fighters in Smash Bros. Wii.

649
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I understand that.

650
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Or Smash Bros. for Wii U.

651
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:49,000
I understand that. And I would love to see an enhanced version, especially the ones where people make designs out of the parts to make different things on their faces and things.

652
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Drawing penises and that kind of stuff. And then just having to try to translate that into something more realistic would be hilarious.

653
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:01,000
All right. Well, speaking of Nintendo and games that will probably incorporate the Miis one way or another.

654
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Star Fox for Wii U is a thing, and they are saying it will be playable at E3 2015, which I extract from that means it won't be out any sooner in Japan or the US.

655
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,000
So those hoping for a spring release for Star Fox, haha, looks like it's going to be more like holiday.

656
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Now, Miyamoto didn't talk a lot about what, you know, Star Fox outside anything that was already said at the last E3 and in between there.

657
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:28,000
But it will utilize both the Wii U gamepad and the TV.

658
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I would think that Wii U gamepad would be like a radar. Would make sense? I don't know. I mean, I don't know. Again, we'll see.

659
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
They're going to fly with tilt controls.

660
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,000
We'll see. We'll see.

661
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Now, Miyamoto was also asked, when will we get a new F-Zero game?

662
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
First off, thank you somebody for confronting him and asking him. I appreciate that.

663
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
So he punched him in the face and flipped him off.

664
01:03:51,000 --> 01:04:00,000
No, that's not what happened. What happened, Miyamoto said, they need to find the right controller interface for the game.

665
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Why? Does your controller have buttons? Yes. Does your controller have a joystick? Yes.

666
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
You have the right interface for F-Zero.

667
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Yeah, considering Mario Kart 8 was not just, if you've been listening to OLR, Mario Kart 8 was not only my favorite Wii U game last year, it was my favorite game period last year.

668
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:29,000
So I have a hard time understanding why a driving game like F-Zero could not be done on the Wii U.

669
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Wow, that's a whole ton of, that's like a big, you know, heaping snow shovel full of bullshit right there.

670
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I agree. Look, I love Miyamoto, but that's a bullshit answer.

671
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,000
This is why I need to interview these people. Remember how I interviewed, remember when I was talking to James?

672
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
So what do you think about it in the groove? You know, that kind of stuff.

673
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
So are you going to make a new F-Zero? We need to find the right controller.

674
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I'd be like, I'm sorry, that doesn't make any fucking sense.

675
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
When you spend all this money on your controller, it has a fucking screen.

676
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
And you wonder why you don't get asked to do interviews with Miyamoto.

677
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,000
What about, you know, your controller has buttons. What else do you want in there?

678
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Do you need a pedal so I can cycle my car around?

679
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I have two mindsets of this. I have two mindsets of this.

680
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:18,000
One, that answer I don't accept because aren't they selling F-Zero on Virtual Console, like the original?

681
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
So there is an F-Zero game on Wii U.

682
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Now I understand, you probably want to argue with me, well it's different in the controls because it's just emulated.

683
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, I get that. But an F-Zero game exists on the Wii U, so you can't say it can't be done.

684
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:37,000
But here's the other thing I have with that, and that I think is the real answer.

685
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:43,000
I think, because obviously there is a successor to the Wii U being worked on right now,

686
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,000
and I'm not even talking about some of those other articles that have been around the internet this week and all that stuff.

687
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:54,000
It's just not only is Sony and Microsoft planning what's next, obviously Nintendo's planning what's next as well.

688
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:04,000
We all know that. So maybe something to do with controls, which certainly the same thing could be said about the Wii and the Wii U,

689
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:10,000
but maybe there's something else that Nintendo has in store for their next console,

690
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:15,000
that they're going to come out and have F-Zero as a launch title or as close to it,

691
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:22,000
that, oh, this was the better controls suited for F-Zero that Miyamoto was talking about a couple years ago.

692
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Unless it's VR, I don't give a fuck what the hell he's talking about.

693
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:32,000
There's literally, unless part of the console is going to be that fucking cabinet that swivels around, I just don't care.

694
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:37,000
It doesn't make any sense that, oh, well, I'm sorry, we just don't have the right control scheme for that.

695
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:43,000
That makes no sense. That's, no. I'm sorry. I just don't buy that for a second.

696
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:52,000
YYR in chat with all caps says, the Wii U game pad literally has every control method ever conceived for use in a video game.

697
01:06:52,000 --> 01:07:00,000
That is why I think what I just said there, the second half of that, I think that's what it is.

698
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:07,000
I think that there's not going to be an F-Zero on the Wii U because they're already planning it for the successor console,

699
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:20,000
which, to be fair, if the next Nintendo console is going to be equivalent of the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and perhaps even a small step above in power,

700
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I think a, you know, blow your panties off, F-Zero, HD, neon, flashy, high-speed game could be awesome.

701
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,000
I think Akdeft has the right idea here. Powerglow 2.0.

702
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
And maybe that's just it. Maybe that's it. Powerglow 2.0. That's what it is.

703
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
You're just going to, you're going to grab that fake steering wheel and it's so bad.

704
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,000
All right, well, we'll see. All right, moving on. Dark Sakura.

705
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Well.

706
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:55,000
How would you control your eraser and F-Zero? Dark Sakura?

707
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Telepathy.

708
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Ah. Maybe that's the new Nintendo console. You're going to control it with your mind.

709
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I think things and they happen.

710
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
I would, you know.

711
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
I am a biotic god.

712
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Honestly, I mean, I guess it was sort of like, I forget the game because I never actually played that one when I'd go to, was it the Virtual World?

713
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:21,000
But they had the Mars Racing game or whatever that was kind of like that. But I always played the Battletech ones.

714
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I kind of fear.

715
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,000
But one of those would be cool.

716
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I kind of fear Dark Sakura's Telepathy F-Zero game, though, because I just worry that, you know, people are going to walk in and it's going to be like,

717
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Rob, why, why whenever you play F-Zero is it just it's not even racing. The camera's just panning around Captain Falcon's butt the whole time.

718
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
What is?

719
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,000
That wouldn't be me. No, no, no, no, no. That wouldn't. I'm not the Captain Falcon fangirl.

720
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:49,000
You'd be, you would walk in the house and be, I was thinking that, too.

721
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:58,000
For me playing that game, it would actually be telling other people how awful they drive and get off my road.

722
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Coming to the Nintendo Wii U 2.

723
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Dark Sakura's aggressive driver.

724
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
You need to play Grand Theft Auto 5. You can flip people off in the game.

725
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
When you're driving by.

726
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,000
But I don't like the Grand Theft Auto games.

727
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,000
You just haven't played the right one yet.

728
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
All right. Anyway.

729
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
You mean any of them?

730
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Dark Sakura, sorry to derail you. Not sorry.

731
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Pfft. Bitch. Okay.

732
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Rob. Rob. Rob. Rob. Rob. Rob. Rob. Rob.

733
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
What?

734
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Hearts.

735
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:30,000
So 3D Afterburner 2 is going to be coming out on Nintendo 3DS.

736
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Yay.

737
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
On January 15th. Yay.

738
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Thanks Sega for giving us a release date.

739
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,000
It's in the second batch of 3D classics.

740
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Among others, we have 3D Fantasy Zone, 3D Outrun, 3D Fantasy Zone 2, and 3D Thunder Blade.

741
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Which means I will have these.

742
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Because. Fantasy Zone.

743
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Fantasy Zone is the best Sega game ever.

744
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
I thought Space Harrier was the best Sega game ever.

745
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:06,000
What is my favorite 3 order of games?

746
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Uh. The Guardian Legend.

747
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Space Harrier.

748
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Uh. Mass Effect.

749
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Garrett.

750
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Fantasy Zone.

751
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
And then Space Harrier.

752
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
I was going to say Final Fantasy 7.

753
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
No.

754
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
But only the scene where Aerith gets stabbed. Over and over again.

755
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Did you see what got put on my Facebook?

756
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Yes.

757
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
It was the Aerith sword sharpener.

758
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Yes I did.

759
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
I need one of those for real.

760
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
I did.

761
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
They just need to make those.

762
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:37,000
I want someone to get like the little guy who is like the knife holder and have it be turned into Aerith.

763
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:42,000
So Dark Sakura talking about Afterburner. I have it.

764
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
And this is how F-Zero can fit in the picture too. You ready?

765
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
World exclusive here on Orange Lounge Radio.

766
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,000
I have deduced based on Miyamoto's comments and Dark Sakura's mouth.

767
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
I have deduced. Because she has telepathy powers. Remember?

768
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I have deduced.

769
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
It's because I'm psycho and have ESPN.

770
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:02,000
I have deduced what it will be on the Wii U too. You ready? You ready?

771
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
It's going to be a chair.

772
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,000
And the chair can go 360 degrees.

773
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Just like the Afterburner cabinets. Right?

774
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
Where you can flip upside down.

775
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,000
And the F-Zero cabinets. Which were badass.

776
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:22,000
It's going to be a chair that will flip upside down and drop you on your ass.

777
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Can we get like a long winded Peter Molyneux video where they're talking about,

778
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:36,000
you know, up until now we've never considered about the crucial aspect of playing video games.

779
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Where is he?

780
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Where is Peter Molyneux right now?

781
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Because somebody needs to check and make sure he's not in Nintendo headquarters.

782
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,000
And if he's there, he needs to be removed from the building.

783
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
He needs to be against a white backdrop.

784
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Because, you know, it's just like him talking with his name in the bottom there.

785
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,000
Just talking about how essential the chair is.

786
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
I don't know. It's just...

787
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
It's going to be something stupid.

788
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,000
It's going to be like, we came up with this brand new controller.

789
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:07,000
You take this little, you know, it's a ball on a string and you swing it around to go faster and you move it.

790
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,000
It's going to be crap.

791
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,000
It's going to be crap.

792
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:13,000
If Peter Molyneux is in a partnership with Nintendo, I will shut off the press conference.

793
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Because, you know, I ain't getting invited. So I will shut off the press conference.

794
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
When he walks up, I'll just shut it off.

795
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,000
I hope that they would do a new, like, Virtual Boy.

796
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
But, I don't know, VR...

797
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
But, see, that's the one thing.

798
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,000
It's like, if you wait too long, people are just going to do it better.

799
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Alright, we'll see.

800
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

801
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
Although, I think, again, we're in a slow period of the year.

802
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
There's probably not a lot to talk about.

803
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Let's check in anyway and see what will be released in a store near you soon.

804
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Nothing.

805
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Nothing in the US this week.

806
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Yeah, unfortunately not until, I think, the end of this month.

807
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Unless, you know, I haven't seen any new announcements of things.

808
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:01,000
But, yeah, I don't think anything is coming out of here physically until, like, the 27th.

809
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Well, believe it or not, it's a pretty similar story over in Japan.

810
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,000
There are some releases coming up on the 20th of January.

811
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:11,000
But that's not this week.

812
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Oh, wait, no, I lied.

813
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
There is one release I found for this week.

814
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
You ready?

815
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:20,000
It's Bioshock Infinite, the complete edition for the PlayStation 3 in Japan.

816
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
That is out on the 15th of January.

817
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,000
So, there's one game to look forward to this week.

818
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Which is really just a repackaging of a game that's been out for a while.

819
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Actually, it's not the 27th, it's the 20th.

820
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
And that would be that Saints' Rogue, Gad out of Hell.

821
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Which I am totally interested in playing.

822
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Despite the fact that the last two Saints' Rogue games pissed me off.

823
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Because they weren't as good as they could have been.

824
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:46,000
But I still will play everything and support the franchise because I'm stupid.

825
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Oh, one other game.

826
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
There is one other game in Japan this week.

827
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Hooray, on the 15th.

828
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:56,000
On the 3DS this week, Kenka Banchao 6, Soul and Blood.

829
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:02,000
And this seems like one of those... I don't know what the hell kind of game this is.

830
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
It's like a fighting, manga, sim...

831
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
I like how that guy had laser eyes.

832
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
I think it's based on a series over there though.

833
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Because obviously it's the sixth game.

834
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
But there's a scene where they're playing volleyball.

835
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
And I'm like, is this Top Gun? What is this?

836
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,000
What is it? Tennis? And then they fight each other.

837
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
That's interesting.

838
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Well, that's how...

839
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
War's gotten a whole lot more dramatic.

840
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
That's right. Dark Soccer, how about the UK?

841
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Nothing this week. I'll go ahead and do next week.

842
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:34,000
On 19th of January we have Black Guards 2 for PC.

843
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
And on the 23rd, Saints Row, get out of hell.

844
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
On a bunch of shit.

845
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,000
Alright. First big, big release of the year.

846
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys.

847
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,000
So Captain Toad Treasure Tracker is not a big release then, huh?

848
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,000
That was bumped up and actually came out a little sooner.

849
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:53,000
Yeah, it came out on the 8th.

850
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
But no, I think it was bumped up sooner.

851
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
I think they ended up getting it at the end of December.

852
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
I don't think it actually... I think it came out actually sooner than January.

853
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
I think. I could be wrong.

854
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
It could be.

855
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
But we had it in the States a long time ago.

856
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
So we always do. So whatever.

857
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,000
You know what? Everybody in the UK, I will trade places with you.

858
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
You can come over here and get your games early.

859
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
And I can live somewhere with free healthcare.

860
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Why don't you just go to Canada?

861
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
It's a lot closer.

862
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Poutine.

863
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Alright, now you're weighing the options.

864
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Alright, just a couple more stories for you guys in the classic game of the week.

865
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,000
But first, Loki.

866
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:34,000
So apparently, originally it was thought that there was a leak to when Kingdom Hearts 3 would be coming out.

867
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,000
According to Bill Farmer, who does the voice acting for Goofy in the game.

868
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,000
He said that the game was due out in 2015.

869
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:47,000
However, Square Enix went to correct saying there was a goof.

870
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
The release date for Kingdom Hearts 3 remains unannounced.

871
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
It's coming out next year. Come on.

872
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
I mean, it's probably coming out next year.

873
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
But they just haven't announced it yet.

874
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
And see, they didn't say it wasn't coming out.

875
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
They just said it remains unannounced.

876
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I don't think it is coming out next year.

877
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
I think Final Fantasy XV is their tentpole for next year.

878
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,000
That's cool. I'm down with that.

879
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
I'd rather play Final Fantasy XV.

880
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,000
I think XV is going to make it next year, finally.

881
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
And then I think Kingdom Hearts 3 is 2016.

882
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Why would they dump both the same year?

883
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,000
That's a lot of Square power for a year.

884
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:24,000
I mean, hey, if they do it, I will be very happy.

885
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,000
But it just seems like XV, especially with XV having a demo coming out in April,

886
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
seems to be a lot more ready for prime time than Kingdom Hearts 3,

887
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
which we've seen very little out of.

888
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:37,000
I mean, yes, I understand there's voice acting and all this other stuff.

889
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
But this guy, who knew?

890
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,000
It might have been like a side story thing that's going to end up coming out.

891
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Like a prequel movie to the game or something that might come out.

892
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
And just because he thinks it's due out in 2015,

893
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
just because he doesn't know too much about the development

894
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,000
aside from that he's done his voice acting and that's it.

895
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:01,000
I mean, there's a lot of stuff that could be delayed for various reasons.

896
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,000
So I would say that it's definitive.

897
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:09,000
And blanketing 2015, that's still very plausible

898
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
because it could come out at the end of the year.

899
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
You could have Final Fantasy come out in the summer

900
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:18,000
and then have Kingdom Hearts for fourth quarter or something.

901
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
We'll see, we'll see.

902
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,000
All right, well, one more story for you guys here for this first half of the show.

903
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
And this is about Loki's favorite character, Tingle.

904
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
And we almost had a Tingle resurgence this past year, apparently,

905
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
because Hyrule Warriors, the team that made that game,

906
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
they wanted to put Tingle in the game.

907
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Tecmo Koei actually wanted to put Tingle in the game.

908
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,000
But Eiji Aonuma said no.

909
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Include a different character besides Tingle.

910
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
And the quote,

911
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Actually, Tingle was a character we kind of considered and sort of went back and forth on.

912
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:58,000
We really wanted to include him, but Mr. Aonuma suggested that it might be good to include some other character.

913
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Well, that's sad.

914
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Why not both?

915
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Porque no los dos? Why not both?

916
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
I just don't understand why they...

917
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
...resources, blah, blah, blah.

918
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
It would have been funny to do him, like, all realistic.

919
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Just have, like, some guy in, like, you know, tights or whatever, just fighting.

920
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
But he kind of has, like, the Tingle...

921
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
And Loki volunteers to do the mocap.

922
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

923
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:29,000
I wonder if this means, uh, what this could mean for Tingle's presence or lack thereof in the Wii U version of the game.

924
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Oh, you'll get a new Tingle game before you'll get a new F-Zero game.

925
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Oh, fuck you. All right.

926
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
That was cold.

927
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Hey, I don't like it any more than you, okay?

928
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:45,000
All right. You know what? Let's travel back to a time when this was all a little bit simpler.

929
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,000
There was no arguing for characters to be in or not in certain games.

930
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,000
You just took what you got and that was it. There was no internet forum to complain about it on.

931
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
It's the classic game of the week.

932
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Every week Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game where she thinks,

933
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Hey, you should be playing this. And if you're not, well...

934
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Then get a PC Engine.

935
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,000
That's right. Get a PC Engine so you can play it. There's a big hit. Dark Sakura.

936
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:13,000
What is this week's classic game of the week?

937
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:18,000
It is a semi-little known game called Psychic Storm.

938
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:25,000
It came out, um, in 1992. It was put out by Telnet Japan and Alpha System.

939
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:31,000
It was a super CD-ROM too, so you can play it on an American Turbo Duo.

940
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:38,000
First of all, Psychic Storm is really just a basic virtual, not virtual, vertical shooter.

941
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:46,000
It starts in a place called New Hong Kong City where there are these insect-like aliens trying to take over.

942
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:52,000
And so the people who they have to get to pilot these...

943
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,000
They're kind of like ships, but they're kind of buggy too.

944
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
This would have been perfect for the bug theme, I guess.

945
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,000
But they're psychically bonded to their ships.

946
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:08,000
They have Alex who has the Vulcan Gun Laser, Char with the Psycho Shell,

947
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Joe has a short-ranged Hell Flame, and Natasha has the Ion Laser, which she was always my favorite to play.

948
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:23,000
They also can transform. So Alex can turn into a huge butterfly or something.

949
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:28,000
They get a bunch of, you know, enemies will drop power-ups. It's the usual type of thing.

950
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:34,000
Some orbs can actually bring back your... fill up your life bar, that type of thing.

951
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:39,000
You also have, of course, bombs that you have to use very, very sparingly.

952
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:45,000
And of course it has two-player simultaneous mode where you can actually combine your transformations.

953
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,000
And transformations are what I'm getting into now.

954
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:55,000
With your transformations, they actually can take up to 15 seconds to do your transform.

955
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:02,000
And the game actually gives you time to do them, but in some cases, as I found out the first time I played the game,

956
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:10,000
if you pull off a transformation on a boss battle at just the right time, you can actually completely avoid the boss battle and just kill it by transforming.

957
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:15,000
So basically, you do a Sailor Moon dance and the boss is impressed to death.

958
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Sorry, I popped my neck.

959
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:30,000
It also, you know, they've got the different weapons and then they have their different psychic attacks that, you know, take over the whole screen.

960
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Although one of them... back when we first played this game, my husband thought they said, I get pissed off.

961
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:41,000
It actually said Psychic Storm, but my husband thought they said, I get pissed off.

962
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
So from then forward, this game be called...

963
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Because they sound so similar.

964
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Well, it was the accent.

965
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
I know.

966
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:55,000
But since then, my husband has referred to this game as, I get pissed off.

967
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:05,000
It really is, I mean, as far as shooters go, I'd have to say it's pretty generic except that the level and character designs are actually really neat.

968
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
And it has a pretty decent soundtrack.

969
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
I mean, it actually follows along some different genre.

970
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:19,000
And I sadly do not have too much more actual information about this game or its release because I couldn't find anything.

971
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
I found very little.

972
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:27,000
But... so a lot of actually what I am giving you is just from having played the game.

973
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:38,000
It does have some little elements of very bad voice acting in it, as in badly recorded voice acting.

974
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:47,000
But I'd have to say that it's probably a solid... I'd give it a solid 8 out of 10 if I were going to rate it.

975
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:52,000
It's a fun game. It's good to sit down and put an hour into it and beat the game.

976
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
It's not super, super difficult.

977
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
But it's got enough challenge in it to keep it interesting.

978
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:02,000
So, I mean, it's no spriggin' but, I mean, if you're looking at PC Engine games.

979
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
But Psychic Storm is a really good solid game.

980
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
And they get pissed off.

981
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Alright.

982
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
There it is. Your classic game of the week.

983
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Psychic Storm, or I get pissed off on the PC Engine.

984
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
PC Engine Duo.

985
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Considering there was a lot of people last week who absolutely recognized the classic game of the week.

986
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,000
In fact, I think you saw a few tweets on it, like, I love that game and so forth.

987
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:30,000
You kind of went from something very well known to something probably very few people have even played.

988
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,000
You know, if I don't do something obscure every so often, I cease to be a mess of myself.

989
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:37,000
That is part of the charm of the classic game of the week segment.

990
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Well, I've done games that, like, you only know them if you're a collector.

991
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Sure.

992
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:47,000
And some games I've done, I think, are games that are on my wish list.

993
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:50,000
I do have this game, though. I do legit have this game.

994
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Alright. Well, maybe for a future game stream at some point we'll check this out, like this guy's doing.

995
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,000
I have to hook up the streaming stuff and then get the PC Engine out of storage.

996
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
And then find the game again.

997
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Dig it all up.

998
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
Alright, there it is. Your classic game of the week.

999
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Psychic Storm on the PC Engine.

1000
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Very good pick from Dark Soccer.

1001
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:17,000
I could actually re-crap now. I forgot the name of that emulator that I used to play.

1002
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,000
That I could play my turbo games on.

1003
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Alright, don't go crazy now.

1004
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Alright, we're going to take a break, guys, though.

1005
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,000
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, we've got more news for you guys.

1006
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:33,000
The Fugu Question of the Week. Some news about Nintendo quitting the market.

1007
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Alright, at least in one part of the world we'll talk about what that's all about.

1008
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,000
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio, right after this.

1009
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1010
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Live on this Sunday night, January the 11th of 2015.

1011
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Episode number 583 of our show in progress.

1012
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
A reminder, no show next week.

1013
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,000
584 will be here in two weeks.

1014
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:07,000
During the break, Loki's showing me what he had put together so far for his Game Jam project.

1015
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Kind of his concept for the start of the game.

1016
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
It looks fine. I see where some of that stuff is bugging you.

1017
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Like when you... I don't want to spoil things.

1018
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:21,000
But you can definitely see that stitching in the world map that was bugging you crazy.

1019
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
I don't care about it anymore yet. It's not so bad.

1020
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:28,000
It's buggy. It's part of the atmosphere.

1021
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Now that maybe some of these other people have freed up,

1022
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
not working on their games as much now because they're done,

1023
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,000
you should see if you get any help.

1024
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:39,000
I'm okay. I can do it. It's a sick start.

1025
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,000
You're such a boy. You won't stop and ask for directions.

1026
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,000
If I need help, I will. Otherwise, I'm just going to look up the answer.

1027
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
That's the only way we'll learn how to do it.

1028
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:50,000
If I look up the answer or figure it out myself.

1029
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Yeah, fair enough.

1030
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Alright, let's get into some rapid fire news.

1031
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Also in this segment, of course, the FUGO Question of the Week,

1032
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
our mailbag coming up, the FUs of the Week,

1033
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,000
and your phone calls at 1-877-GAMO-LR

1034
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio.

1035
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000
But not yet. We've got a few segments to get to before we get to calls.

1036
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Let's do some rapid fire news, starting off with Loki.

1037
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Alright, so there's a small rumor that the GTA 5 PC retail copies won't be Steam compatible,

1038
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
although I think that's a bunch of bullshit.

1039
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Apparently, this is coming from a NeoGaf user.

1040
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Or they said that they...

1041
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Well, that's credible.

1042
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
No, I'm sorry. I thought it was from the user.

1043
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
It's actually they were talking about...

1044
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:37,000
It's like, how many references deep is this?

1045
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Anyways, somebody says that a listing on Green Man Gaming

1046
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:45,000
says that it has the other DRM logo on the GTA 5 page.

1047
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,000
What the thought is, though, is that it's not actually other DRM.

1048
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
It's just that it's tied in with Rockstar Social Club,

1049
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,000
so you kind of need a Social Club account.

1050
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:01,000
But they're saying that they have to log into their Rockstar Social Club account,

1051
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:04,000
and it won't be able to integrate with Steam,

1052
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,000
which doesn't make any sense to me,

1053
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
because I know that, granted, out of four,

1054
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
you have to log in with your Social Club account,

1055
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
and that works just fine.

1056
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,000
And also, Max Payne 3, hello,

1057
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
that also had Rockstar Social Club,

1058
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:23,000
so that whole argument gets thrown out the window.

1059
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
I think, honestly, it's going to have Steam support,

1060
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
and it'll be just fine.

1061
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,000
It wouldn't make any sense that they'd be selling versions of it on Steam

1062
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
and not sell it at retail,

1063
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
which is basically going to be a Steam key anyway,

1064
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
so it doesn't make any sense.

1065
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,000
But whatever, that's what they're reporting,

1066
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,000
so we'll see in a couple weeks here when it comes out on the 27th.

1067
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Now, of course, with any release of Saints Row,

1068
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:53,000
they always do some lavish pre-order incentive or special editions,

1069
01:27:53,000 --> 01:28:01,000
so they have a version of the game that's going to be coming with a Ouija board.

1070
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:06,000
They're calling it Ouija, but it's a Ouija board.

1071
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:11,000
I think the actual name Ouija, like O-U-I, is trademark.

1072
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Yeah, it's Hasbro.

1073
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:18,000
But, yeah, so you can get that with a special edition that's available at Game, I guess.

1074
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,000
So you can talk to your friends in hell, or make some new ones.

1075
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Exactly.

1076
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Through the power of...

1077
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,000
How is a Ouija board powered by the spirits, I guess,

1078
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:32,000
through the spirits that live in your bedroom and watch you touch yourself at night?

1079
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,000
They want to make contact with you.

1080
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:40,000
Please stop touching yourself at night.

1081
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:43,000
I don't want to see that anymore.

1082
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:46,000
But, yeah, you can get that.

1083
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
There's basically...

1084
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:53,000
It doesn't say what the price is of it, but it looks cool.

1085
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,000
I guess, apparently, if you...

1086
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
There's a contest that goes along with it.

1087
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:01,000
If you take a picture of yourself using the Ouija board,

1088
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:05,000
then you would be able to win a night on a haunted...

1089
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Or was it a tour on a haunted town or something like that

1090
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
with some UK spirit medium guy?

1091
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Maybe they'll make one out of rubber called the squeegee board.

1092
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
The squeegee board? Yeah.

1093
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Great for washing windows and contacting the dead.

1094
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:24,000
And that should be coming out next week on the 20th in North America

1095
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,000
and the 23rd internationally.

1096
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,000
I, on the other hand, am not playing on buying a special edition.

1097
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
I will pick up the version that's on PlayStation 4

1098
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,000
because I've only beaten the game three or four times already.

1099
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:42,000
And, and, seriously, what the fuck?

1100
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,000
I've played the game over 40 hours

1101
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,000
and yet I don't have the achievement for playing it over 40 hours.

1102
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,000
That's a long time.

1103
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
That's not a long time.

1104
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:55,000
And it's just not giving it to me, whatever.

1105
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,000
And anyways, there's another big game right around the corner

1106
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
and that's Witcher 3 Wild Hunt.

1107
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:05,000
And they've released the PC specs for the game.

1108
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:08,000
So if you're looking to see what, you know,

1109
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,000
if your computer can run it, and I was trying to figure out if mine can,

1110
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:15,000
I don't, eh, might be able to, I don't know.

1111
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Then you can check it out and see if it'll run on your system.

1112
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:25,000
But looks like rather modest specs.

1113
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
So, cool.

1114
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
That's it.

1115
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Alright.

1116
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:35,000
I guess, I upgraded my computer just last year,

1117
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:37,000
so I'm thinking Witcher 3 won't be a problem for me.

1118
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,000
No, no, they're basically...

1119
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Other people may have some issues.

1120
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:44,000
The minimum they're saying that you need a Core i5 2500K

1121
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
and then, what is it?

1122
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,000
They're saying AMDY is a Phenom 2 X4940,

1123
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
which I have no fucking clue how long I sold.

1124
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Some people are going to be left out in the cold with those specs.

1125
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I know my graphics card can run that

1126
01:30:57,000 --> 01:31:01,000
because it's higher spec than what the minimum is.

1127
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:04,000
As far as the high end, though, not so much.

1128
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Well, let's talk about the awesome games done quick marathon.

1129
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
I don't know how many of you guys watched any part of that.

1130
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
I unfortunately didn't watch any of it.

1131
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Oh my gosh.

1132
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I know, I wanted to.

1133
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,000
A lot of it's on YouTube.

1134
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,000
I just haven't got a chance to yet.

1135
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,000
I will watch it.

1136
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:21,000
The Ocarina bit last night was a great finale.

1137
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:24,000
They were still streaming some this morning too, but just like random stuff.

1138
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Yeah, they do like a little extended finale, I think.

1139
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Yeah, some of the Hoard House guys like Extrofer gets really into that.

1140
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Shane was getting into it this year.

1141
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
A lot of my friends on Twitter get into that.

1142
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Flaco.

1143
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Yeah, definitely Flaco.

1144
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
It's all for a good cause.

1145
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,000
It was all for the Prevent Cancer Foundation.

1146
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:43,000
They ended up raising, just to conclude this year,

1147
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:49,000
since it is over now, they have actually raised over $1.1 million.

1148
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:54,000
My understanding is last check, it was actually up to $1.3 million.

1149
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,000
I wonder if it even got higher because, you know, there's still,

1150
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,000
thanks to the YouTube and the Humble Bundle, there's still some figures,

1151
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
I think, coming in.

1152
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,000
So I'm not sure what they're at now.

1153
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Did I buy the Humble Bundle?

1154
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
I don't even remember now, but I probably should buy it.

1155
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Oh my gosh, I just looked just now.

1156
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,000
They're up to $1.5 million as of right this moment.

1157
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
No, it's over.

1158
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
I've missed out on a bunch of games I already have.

1159
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Whoops.

1160
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,000
Whoops at you.

1161
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:18,000
That's all right.

1162
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,000
I had pretty much everything in the bundle.

1163
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
That's why I didn't buy it right away.

1164
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,000
But it was for charity.

1165
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Yeah, but I don't, how many copies of games do I need, really?

1166
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
All right.

1167
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Well, congrats to the great, what a great way to kick off the year.

1168
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
A bunch of people that really, really love those games.

1169
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Doing a good thing for charity.

1170
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,000
Let's carry that tone throughout 2015, please,

1171
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:40,000
and none of the fuckery that brought down last year, please.

1172
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,000
So congrats to the awesome games done quick, guys.

1173
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Let's talk about Far Cry 4, which is not being handled as quick.

1174
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:52,000
There's some issues, apparently, with Far Cry 4 and the Xbox One.

1175
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,000
Apparently, there was some rumors out there that DRM issues

1176
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:00,000
were causing legitimate digital copies of Far Cry 4 to stop functioning.

1177
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Apparently, the game at one point was delisted,

1178
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,000
although Microsoft says the delisting was an accident.

1179
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Microsoft quickly fixed it.

1180
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
But some players were complaining of issues,

1181
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,000
even after they had deleted and redownloaded the game,

1182
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,000
that the game basically wasn't working.

1183
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
So some folks were thinking,

1184
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,000
oh, the delisting was to fix whatever the issue was,

1185
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:26,000
although Microsoft, in a statement, says that the problems

1186
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
had nothing to do with any sort of hidden DRM,

1187
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:32,000
but there is no explanation as to what really happened.

1188
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,000
They say, as far as the DRM goes,

1189
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:38,000
quote, if customers own the rights to a game,

1190
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,000
they can visit their download history and initiate a redownload

1191
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,000
whenever they please, even if the game has been delisted from the Xbox Store

1192
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
and is no longer available for purchase,

1193
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:50,000
which is pretty much a canned answer that has nothing to do with a specific scenario.

1194
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Lastly, since we've been talking about game jams and dev stuff,

1195
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Steam Dev Days was happening about a year ago at this time,

1196
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
but there was no second year.

1197
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,000
It did not happen this year. It's not happening.

1198
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Basically, a representative from Steam saying,

1199
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:15,000
quote, Steam Dev Days was a great way to brief a large number of Steam developers.

1200
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
This year, our focus will be a bit different,

1201
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:21,000
so we're planning a larger than usual presence at GDC.

1202
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
So there will not be a Steam Dev Days this year,

1203
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,000
but we will certainly consider doing it again in the future.

1204
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:30,000
So, you know, last year, Steam also had the Steam Box thing,

1205
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,000
which never did end up coming out. I guess they'll be coming out this year.

1206
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
But they had the whole Steam Dev Days to go with that.

1207
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:41,000
This year, it sounds like they're going to be kind of rolling that over into GDC this year,

1208
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:47,000
which, by the way, there is rumor that Steam will unveil the finalized Steam controller design.

1209
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,000
It's been early stuff.

1210
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,000
But the finalized design will show up in March at the Game Developers Conference.

1211
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
March is going to be a very interesting month,

1212
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:58,000
because you have literally GDC and PAX East at the same time.

1213
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,000
They do overlap a little bit this year,

1214
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:04,000
as opposed to being really close to each other as they were in years past.

1215
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,000
So, there you go.

1216
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:12,000
We'll see what comes out of GDC in just a couple months.

1217
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Even though we don't usually get the big game announcements like you get at E3,

1218
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:21,000
there's usually a little something here and there as far as,

1219
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,000
here's a new something that developers will have to work with.

1220
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:26,000
So we'll see.

1221
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1222
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
A few things.

1223
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:34,000
There is actually a notice for Steam.

1224
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Double Dragon Trilogy is going to be on Steam,

1225
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
and good old games.

1226
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:45,000
So those should be up on January 15th.

1227
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,000
But ask yourself, do you really want to play Double Dragon 3?

1228
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Do you really?

1229
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Because I bet you don't.

1230
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
I've already got it.

1231
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,000
I don't know, ask Dan. He's the one who plays it.

1232
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Also now, Thetrthym Final Fantasy Curtain Call is getting Xenogears DLC.

1233
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:07,000
So you can get all of your Xenogears music stuff on that you would ever, ever want to.

1234
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:18,000
And then, last but not least, Elder Scrolls Arena is going to be free on PC.

1235
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,000
You just go to elderscrolls.com slash arena,

1236
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
and you can download it for free.

1237
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,000
For free.

1238
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:31,000
You can check out where all the lore upon lore upon lore in Skyrim and Oblivion and all that came from.

1239
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Yup.

1240
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Know your roots.

1241
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
There it is.

1242
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Hitstun, what do you know about the Double Dragon Trilogy, arcade or NES versions?

1243
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,000
My thought is it's arcade.

1244
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,000
I think so.

1245
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
Because a different company developed the NES versions.

1246
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
So it's the arcade versions.

1247
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:51,000
And the iOS versions, and I think it's on Android too, are based on arcade.

1248
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:55,000
It's just a port of the mobile phone stuff for PC.

1249
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000
I think.

1250
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,000
That's what I was getting from what I was reading anyway.

1251
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Alright, well let's see what I get in reading your responses to the FUGL Question of the Week.

1252
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Every week we ask a question of our Facebook and Google communities.

1253
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,000
You put those words together, you get FUGL.

1254
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:23,000
And we ask our communities a question each week and read some of our favorite answers here on the air.

1255
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Although this week's question being pretty short, I think we'll get a lot of answers in tonight.

1256
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:33,000
And since the news is a little bit light this week, I thought we'd do some more talk about the year,

1257
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:35,000
kind of looking forward to what's going on.

1258
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:37,000
So we asked the listeners this week,

1259
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:42,000
although some of the biggest releases of 2015 will surely be revealed at upcoming expos and conferences,

1260
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,000
like the E3, the GDC, the PAXes and so forth,

1261
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:50,000
we want to know what game at the moment are you most looking forward to in 2015?

1262
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
Starting on Google Plus tonight, Rettertainment says,

1263
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:57,000
I'm most looking forward to hearing anything about The Last Guardian.

1264
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Failing that mirrors edge.

1265
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:03,000
Act Deft responded, Kirby and the Rainbow Curse.

1266
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:07,000
But if I have to pick something not Kirby, Splatoon.

1267
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:11,000
This game looks really interesting and I really want to see how Nintendo makes this work.

1268
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Also, Overwatch is another game I really want to try out.

1269
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Prince Peach Fuzz over on Google Plus says,

1270
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:26,000
Metal Gear Solid 5, with a little exclamation point,

1271
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,000
meaning we caught his attention apparently with that question.

1272
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Let's see, looking at some of the answers over on Facebook.

1273
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
There's a lot of answers on Facebook.

1274
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
Monty Boggs says,

1275
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:39,000
After playing the Halo 5 beta, it's become my most anticipated game at the moment.

1276
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Let's see, Andy R. said,

1277
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:45,000
IAVT Colorful, it's a rhythm game coming to the Vita,

1278
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:48,000
featuring one of the newer Vocaloids, IA,

1279
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,000
which is like Hatsune Miku is a Vocaloid.

1280
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
Ursa Being Slurpy said,

1281
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:56,000
It's a tie between Witcher 3 and The Division.

1282
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
AZHP says,

1283
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Metal Gear Solid 5, I replayed Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3 on the HD collection.

1284
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,000
I was reminded how crazy and dumb that game series is,

1285
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
with regards to story and weird easter eggs.

1286
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,000
I can't wait to see what Kojima has done this time.

1287
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Fifth Dream says,

1288
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Final Fantasy Type 0 HD is what I'm waiting for most.

1289
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Cial says,

1290
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Bravely Second.

1291
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Renji221 says,

1292
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Right now I'd have to say Batman Arkham Knight from the gameplay they've shown so far.

1293
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Guillermo R. says,

1294
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,000
If the new Zelda decides to show up in 2015, then that's it for me.

1295
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Oh, and Final Fantasy XV, with the demo coming out March,

1296
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
it should come out before the year is over, right?

1297
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Am I stupid to hope it'll actually get finished?

1298
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,000
If you are, Guillermo, then call me stupid right there with you.

1299
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Tigerclaw says,

1300
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,000
There are many games coming out this year,

1301
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:45,000
but I think two of my most anticipated games have to be the new Star Fox on Wii U

1302
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
and Batman Arkham Knight.

1303
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Last but not least,

1304
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Red the Haze says,

1305
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Yakuza 5.

1306
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
I know it's an older PS3 game,

1307
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
but I love how you have a gritty gangster crime drama,

1308
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:58,000
with a teen girl idol who has random dance battles with people as combat.

1309
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Dance battles are made by the people who make the Hatsune Miku Project D.Va games.

1310
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
That does sound awesome, actually.

1311
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,000
I think Yakuza is a series I'd like to see.

1312
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Yakuza is a series I really need to get into that I haven't been playing enough of.

1313
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Clearly, if that's what the series is all about.

1314
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:16,000
That's not what the series is all about.

1315
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
They just do some silly things from time to time.

1316
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
I'm okay with silly things from time to time.

1317
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
How about you guys?

1318
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Most anticipated games of 2015?

1319
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,000
I would like to see, basically, a Crackdown.

1320
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
That looks awesome.

1321
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,000
I would like to see No Man's Sky.

1322
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:41,000
As far as beyond that, it's whatever else we haven't heard of yet.

1323
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:45,000
I'd love to try out a virtual reality thing,

1324
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
whether it be the Oculus Rift,

1325
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
or if it's the Morpheus,

1326
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:51,000
or something else.

1327
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:53,000
That would be kind of fun.

1328
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:56,000
That's what I'm more interested in is the VR stuff,

1329
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
what they're going to do with that.

1330
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
But yeah, Crackdown.

1331
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
I've got to have some Crackdown.

1332
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,000
That might be a thing, because that's something that

1333
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Microsoft really pimped out last year,

1334
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:10,000
so I would assume this E3, they're going to show the gameplay.

1335
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Well, even Quantum Break looked pretty awesome.

1336
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
That's true, that's still a thing.

1337
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Check that out.

1338
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,000
I don't remember what Sony had, aside from Uncharted,

1339
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:21,000
but I just don't care about that series.

1340
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:23,000
So I don't remember what else they had.

1341
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Street Fighter V, which obviously is more Capcom,

1342
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
but there was a bunch of stuff there.

1343
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:31,000
I know they had tons of E3, I just don't remember.

1344
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
The show was huge, too.

1345
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:35,000
I still don't remember what...

1346
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Honestly, I'm more interested...

1347
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
The order is right around the corner.

1348
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
That doesn't look that great.

1349
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
I'm more interested in the stuff that they haven't talked about yet.

1350
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Like, hey, Saints Row 5.

1351
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:49,000
And let's have a good Saints Row 5,

1352
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
because I don't know what the fuck they could possibly do now

1353
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,000
with Saints Row, aside from time travel.

1354
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000
I think it's hit the peak of ridiculousness

1355
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
that it could possibly hit.

1356
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
DarkSakura, what about you?

1357
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
What's your most anticipated game of 2015?

1358
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
I honestly don't know.

1359
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Probably more Dragon Age DLC.

1360
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
Well, I was gonna say...

1361
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Silent Hills.

1362
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Oh, Silent Hills. That's a good one.

1363
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
Oh, I can't believe none of our listeners said that.

1364
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:18,000
But then again, there's no guarantee it'll be this year, right?

1365
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,000
I don't care.

1366
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
PT Part 2.

1367
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
I actually...

1368
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
Well, I was gonna say, DarkSakura, I may be helping you with an answer.

1369
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:29,000
I'm hopeful that Mass Effect Don't Call It 4 is this year.

1370
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Yeah, but I'm really trying not to get my hopes up, so...

1371
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
I would think no later than Spring 2016.

1372
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:39,000
I don't want my hopes to get up and then have my heart broken.

1373
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
I understand, I understand.

1374
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Save that if we can't have more info on Mass Effect Don't Call It 4.

1375
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Final Fantasy XV for me, which some of the other listeners already said.

1376
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
I definitely...

1377
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
And I'm of the mindset that that'll be this year.

1378
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
I don't wanna play Pretty Boy Road Trip the game.

1379
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Pretty Boy Road Trip is one very small part of a much larger game.

1380
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
I know, I know.

1381
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
I think we're focusing too much on that.

1382
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Huh. You alright?

1383
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Yeah, I just...

1384
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:11,000
There was something I did have on a list, but for the life of me, I cannot remember what it is right now.

1385
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:15,000
What about going to our chatroom over at live.vognetwork.com

1386
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Tigerclaw says, what about Battlefront 3?

1387
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Do you think that'll come out this year?

1388
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
You know when I first looked at that, I thought it said Battle Toads.

1389
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
That's a huge rumor.

1390
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Battlefront 3 will come out when Star Wars comes out.

1391
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
They're gonna time it with that release, I'm guessing.

1392
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
Zelda also would be another one.

1393
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
Or Zelda Wii U. Did anybody say Zelda Wii?

1394
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Oh no, I think we did have at least one or two listeners that said that.

1395
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
That might be one.

1396
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
Absolutely, Zelda Wii U. I can't wait to see more on that.

1397
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Especially if they're going the Skyrim route with it.

1398
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Isn't that the second thing, a DLC coming for Mario Kart 8 sometime soon?

1399
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Oh yeah, the Animal Crossing.

1400
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
March, I think, is when that's due.

1401
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Why is it so long? I mean...

1402
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
I think they just wanna stretch it out as long as they can.

1403
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
That's ridiculous.

1404
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
I know, a little silly.

1405
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
Maybe that's around the time they're going to announce an Animal Crossing Wii U game.

1406
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Maybe.

1407
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Or...

1408
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
That's the time that they're gonna release more Amiibos

1409
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
that are gonna coincide with the DLC.

1410
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
Ah, maybe.

1411
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
So right around the time they'll have Animal Crossing Amiibos

1412
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
they go along with, you know,

1413
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Animal Crossing and Mario Kart.

1414
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
We'll see.

1415
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Alright.

1416
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Let's get back into some news.

1417
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
And your calls in a little while here at 1877 Game OLR.

1418
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
But first, we've got a little bit of news to get through.

1419
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Loki.

1420
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
Yes, Nintendo has decided to end distribution of its hardware and software in Brazil.

1421
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
They're saying due to the high import tariffs.

1422
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
And starting January 2015,

1423
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Gaming do Brazil,

1424
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
a wholly owned subsidiary of...

1425
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
I'm not even gonna pronounce that.

1426
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
It's not.

1427
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
It's not.

1428
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
It's not.

1429
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
It's not.

1430
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
It's not.

1431
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Yeah, and I'm just gonna save a video.

1432
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
I'm not even gonna pronounce that, too hard for me.

1433
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
stands at home

1434
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
We'll no longer distribute products in Brazil.

1435
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
And despite the changes in Brazil,

1436
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
There'll be a distributor for

1437
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
There'll be a distributor for Latin America

1438
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:03,000
And will be remaining, committed to the brand

1439
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
and the region.

1440
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
So, kind of sucks.

1441
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
But, I guess, you know,

1442
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
They're saying it's just so ridiculous

1443
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
you know, At the price of systems

1444
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:15,000
it's like several thousand...

1445
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
over a hundred dollars more than what it is in other places.

1446
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Yeah, apparently the fees are really high.

1447
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
I'm hearing they have a lot of problems

1448
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
with the digital distribution network there, too.

1449
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Like, it doesn't work with any of the banks

1450
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
in Brazil.

1451
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
So, I guess, like, there's no eShop content

1452
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
like at all in Brazil.

1453
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Which, you know, is a huge source of money

1454
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
for Nintendo, probably even more so

1455
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
in other territories.

1456
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Where it might be harder to just walk into a GameStop

1457
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
and get a game.

1458
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
So, that's probably another strike

1459
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
against why Nintendo is ceasing

1460
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
operations in Brazil.

1461
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
I would love to hear, you know, I know we have listeners throughout the world

1462
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
so, you know, it's hard for us to sit here

1463
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
and comment what's going on in another country

1464
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
but if you happen to be in Brazil

1465
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
and have any insight on this, let us know.

1466
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Because I know we used to have a guy in Argentina

1467
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
and in Chile that listened.

1468
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
I think he's kind of moved on

1469
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
to other things now, but I'm hoping maybe

1470
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
we've got some other people in South America

1471
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
who might give some insight as to what's going on.

1472
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
So...

1473
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Let's see, looking in our chatroom

1474
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
over at live.vognetwork.com

1475
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Act F saying eShop isn't available in Brazil

1476
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
as far as I know. Dungeon Buster says

1477
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Brazil's tariffs are nuts.

1478
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Apparently on launch, a Playstation 4 was

1479
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
$1800 because of taxes.

1480
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
Yeah, it's a little nuts.

1481
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:33,000
It's not going to lead to good business in the country, that's for sure.

1482
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Alright, well let's move on to this.

1483
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
You know, this is kind of big news

1484
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
and I'm not seeing a lot of people talk about this

1485
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
but I think this is kind of big because you know

1486
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
last year we had a lot of

1487
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
run-ins with Let's Plays

1488
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
and the legality of that

1489
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
and what is acceptable on

1490
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
YouTube and so forth. You might remember

1491
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Nintendo got into a lot of these issues and so on.

1492
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Well Microsoft this week

1493
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
coming out with kind of a clarification

1494
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
on their policy on

1495
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
how they view the Let's Plays

1496
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
and the streams and all this other stuff.

1497
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
So with Microsoft's new policy

1498
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
you will now have, if you're

1499
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
a content creator such as me

1500
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
or what have you, any of you other folks

1501
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
that do Twitches or YouTubes, you have a

1502
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
quote, personal, non-exclusive, non-

1503
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
sub-licensable, non-transferable,

1504
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
revocable, limited license to use

1505
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
things like gameplay footage, screenshots

1506
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
and music. But as long

1507
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
as you don't

1508
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
do any, you know, you can't

1509
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
promote bad things

1510
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
in your stream like piracy and all that stuff

1511
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
and do offensive content.

1512
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Also what else is interesting

1513
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
is that you are not able to

1514
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
profit off the content created

1515
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
except for

1516
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
YouTube and Twitch ads

1517
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
which is the most common

1518
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
way that folks are making money off of it.

1519
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
So I'm assuming what they don't

1520
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
want you to make money off of is more like the

1521
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
you know, whatever the product placement or other

1522
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
other things outside of the ads

1523
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
that you may come across.

1524
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
You can't sell or otherwise

1525
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
earn any compensation from your item

1526
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
including through advertisements in the item.

1527
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
You can't charge money in exchange

1528
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
for your item posted on a site that requires

1529
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
a subscription or other fees to view

1530
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
the item or posted on a page

1531
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
you use to sell other items or services

1532
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
even if they have nothing to do with the

1533
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
game content or Microsoft. You also

1534
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
can't use game content in an

1535
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
app that you sell in an app store which

1536
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
makes it so like if you're a let's play

1537
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
you can't make an app that

1538
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
is all your content on iOS and make

1539
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
money off that if it's Microsoft stuff.

1540
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
But you are able to do YouTube

1541
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
and Twitch which is kind of the most common thing

1542
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
that most people are into as well.

1543
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Now even though this is for

1544
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Microsoft Studios and the things that

1545
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
are Microsoft, it does

1546
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
exclude Minecraft because

1547
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
Mojang does their own thing

1548
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
even though there was the purchase

1549
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
with Microsoft buying them

1550
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Minecraft has their own set of rules

1551
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
from 2013 that are still in effect.

1552
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
And if you are curious

1553
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Red vs. Blue which is created by

1554
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
Rooster Teeth, they have a separate agreement

1555
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
with Microsoft that is

1556
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
between them.

1557
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
There you go. If you're

1558
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
curious for more information about how that

1559
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
all works, xbox.com

1560
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
slash en dash us

1561
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
slash developers slash rules

1562
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
or I'm sure if you Google

1563
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Xbox game content usage rules

1564
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
I'm sure you can find much more

1565
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
about this. So there you go.

1566
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
What do you think about that? What do you think about Microsoft's

1567
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
rules? It's

1568
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
nice that they put it out there so that

1569
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
at least there's something that

1570
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
say there ever was a copyright

1571
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
strike you'd be like

1572
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
refer to this type of thing.

1573
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Kind of

1574
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
like how they have with Minecraft.

1575
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
But

1576
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
I don't know. I think it's fair.

1577
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
I don't see that. I don't think that's

1578
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
a really bad thing and I think Nintendo

1579
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
they had something where it was kind of

1580
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
hey, do what you want now.

1581
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
I mean, at least

1582
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
it's tricky. Like where is

1583
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
the balance? Where is the balance with this stuff?

1584
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
And I think they're trying to find a decent balance

1585
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
between like okay, you can make a little

1586
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
bit of money off of it but you can't be like

1587
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
keeping things behind locked doors and

1588
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
selling subscriptions of stuff that's based off

1589
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
things we made. But a little light

1590
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
ad revenue like the YouTube and Twitch stuff

1591
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
is okay and I think

1592
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
I think that's as close of a

1593
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
compromise that's fair as we're probably going to

1594
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
see for a long time. And

1595
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
as a content creator I'm kind of okay with

1596
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
that because I've been having to do a lot of thinking about this.

1597
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
You know, yeah, game makers

1598
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
they make

1599
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
these videos

1600
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
without it you wouldn't have the videos

1601
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
so they kind of, you know, they do deserve

1602
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
a little bit of it.

1603
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
And I have seen other

1604
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
let's plays that are nothing

1605
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
but captures from the game.

1606
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
And I'm kind of always like

1607
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
well, when you're making money off that

1608
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
but the people

1609
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
that do the commentary and the jokes

1610
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
and have a little more, you know, with it

1611
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
okay, then you're at least adding something

1612
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
to it, you're making it a little more Mystery Science

1613
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Theater or whatever. There should

1614
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
be, you know, a little room for you to

1615
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
make some money off that.

1616
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Just to pay to keep it going

1617
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
if nothing else. Pay for your time.

1618
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Which I can

1619
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
assure you, creating content as I have on YouTube

1620
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
I'm not even getting that much. I think I've made

1621
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
be made in all, off all the

1622
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
videos I've done in the past year, I think I've made

1623
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
a dollar. I think I've made a dollar.

1624
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
I've gotten one check from Google.

1625
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Have you really? How much?

1626
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
Well, the minimum is a hundred bucks.

1627
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
What? How'd you get a hundred bucks?

1628
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
What are you doing that I'm not doing?

1629
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
I'm not doing anything. Well, aside from

1630
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
I just did a few

1631
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
videos, mainly

1632
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
the one that had the most revenue

1633
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
was I did a thing on how to

1634
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
side load stuff for the Ouya

1635
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
and so that video keeps getting watched.

1636
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
And then there was one that was like

1637
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
I had one that got Disney Infinity

1638
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
early and I kind of did like a

1639
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
real quick unboxing

1640
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
type thing. But that's it. I mean that's

1641
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
really all I've done. But it's just that

1642
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
those videos are out there. None of my stuff really has gone viral.

1643
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,000
I think the video I have with the most views is like

1644
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
I have a Diablo 3

1645
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
barbarian video

1646
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
that I just randomly did and for some

1647
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
reason that has more views than anything else I've done.

1648
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Some wacky reason. I don't

1649
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
like really keep track

1650
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
of that very much but like

1651
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
I'm gonna see

1652
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
I'm trying to see what my AdSense is back

1653
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
up to again cause

1654
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
it takes a long time for it to get paid out

1655
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
especially since I don't

1656
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
put any of my videos.

1657
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Someday I will but it's just I don't have time.

1658
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
What do we got here?

1659
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Oh, hey!

1660
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
That's not bad.

1661
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Yeah, so the last time it was like

1662
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
$111 and I got $61

1663
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
sitting there.

1664
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
They're not gonna send me a paycheck.

1665
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
Woo!

1666
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Yeah, you know when they paid me out the $111?

1667
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
That was back in 2013.

1668
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
Okay, so I'm

1669
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
it's not like I'm

1670
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
making a ton of money off of this like

1671
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
over the course of a few years.

1672
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Hey, extra money is money.

1673
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
So, can not do it.

1674
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
Even the official

1675
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Playstation account actually tweeted out

1676
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
cause I got on that SharePlay thing

1677
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
right when it first came out and I had a Final Fantasy 14

1678
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
video and Playstation saw it and tweeted it

1679
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
and even my Diablo 3 video

1680
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
had more views than that.

1681
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Which kind of surprised me.

1682
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
I thought the Final Fantasy one would be the most popular.

1683
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
I'm not sure I have that one monetized.

1684
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
I don't monetize all my stuff by default.

1685
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Just the stuff that I'm pretty sure

1686
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
there's studio clearance on.

1687
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
I usually use that Let's Play.

1688
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
There's like a wiki out there that shows which creators

1689
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
are okay with it and which aren't.

1690
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
I haven't really put anything up that's worth

1691
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
something like that would actually be good to

1692
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
repost like in a comment section.

1693
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Yeah.

1694
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
It's okay per here.

1695
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Not that that always

1696
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
helps on YouTube cause they

1697
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
pulled my

1698
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
video on Super Hexagon

1699
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
even though it's pretty clear

1700
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
they're fine with the

1701
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Let's Play monetization.

1702
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Alright, let's move on.

1703
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
DarkSakura, I think we're over to you.

1704
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Yes, I believe so.

1705
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
Well, I have to

1706
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
say that I was right.

1707
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
The real Shepard was

1708
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
always a lady.

1709
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Actually, as it was

1710
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
stated from the developer

1711
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Jonathan Cooper who

1712
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
was the

1713
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
I believe the one that did the first

1714
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
animation test for what would become

1715
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Commander Shepard used a female

1716
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
model. Very clearly a female

1717
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
model. Actually something

1718
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
pulled from

1719
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
a previous game but it

1720
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
was what began and in fact

1721
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
I watched the little running animation very

1722
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
clearly female. But it

1723
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
was a motion capture

1724
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
taken from the game Jade Empire

1725
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
of a female character and that's what became

1726
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Commander Shepard.

1727
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
I mean, they always had

1728
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
the intention of letting you choose

1729
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
but she started

1730
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
life that way.

1731
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
I realized

1732
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
that for some people FemShep

1733
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
is the only Shep in Headcanon

1734
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
although I certainly appreciate

1735
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
the fact that I can have man on man

1736
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Shep. That's my

1737
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
personal thing. But it's

1738
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
interesting though that sometimes characters may

1739
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
start one way and they completely change

1740
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
when they're in development which I don't think it's

1741
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
fair to say in this scenario anything necessarily

1742
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
changed. But I do know

1743
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
one that I had come across not that long ago

1744
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
since I was getting really back into Final Fantasy 13

1745
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
because of the PC release

1746
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Fang, who's my favorite character in the game

1747
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
started as a male

1748
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
and was

1749
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
originally a male character

1750
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
that was going to be

1751
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
the character of Fang.

1752
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
And somewhere along the line

1753
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
Fang changed to a female

1754
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
and I really can't picture it any other way.

1755
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
Fang is just a badass chick

1756
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
my favorite character by far

1757
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
in that game. I don't know

1758
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
I have a hard time picturing it as male although I go

1759
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
that would make an awesome gender swap

1760
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
cosplay.

1761
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
Why can't we have German Shepherd Shepard?

1762
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
I want German Shepherd Shepard

1763
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
because I think that would be awesome.

1764
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Only out of Silent Hill, the dog ending

1765
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
except it's not the dog ending

1766
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
it's the whole game.

1767
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Well my femshep was Sherry Shepherd

1768
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
so

1769
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
as seen on the view

1770
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
maybe Sybil Shepherd

1771
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Shepard's pie

1772
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Dark Soccer isn't speaking

1773
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
but she has a look on her face that basically says

1774
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
please stop

1775
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
which means we have to keep going

1776
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
I will stuff you in an anatomic body.

1777
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Yeah by the way what she's not

1778
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
saying but I'm not gonna promise that

1779
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
I won't murder everybody after that.

1780
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
She's been spending the last hour of the

1781
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
show on the Five Nights at Freddy's

1782
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Wiki ever since I brought it up in part A

1783
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
she's been reading. I didn't make it that

1784
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
far into just because I got

1785
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
motion sick every time Foxy would

1786
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
run because

1787
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
I didn't pay enough attention to the diva.

1788
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
If you don't pay enough attention

1789
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
to Foxy, Foxy

1790
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
will run at you and if you don't slam the door like

1791
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
immediately you will die.

1792
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
With that

1793
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
mouth.

1794
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
The little noise they make.

1795
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Foxy got me with one

1796
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
percent of my battery left by the way.

1797
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Well because he also drains your battery if he

1798
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
touches your door. He goes to your door

1799
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
he'll drain one percent then six percent then

1800
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
eleven. Oh geez. Yeah if

1801
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
you let it happen so he'll actually drain your battery.

1802
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
But what was I gonna

1803
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
say? Did you ever get the

1804
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Golden Freddy? No I didn't survive

1805
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
that far. I did get the Golden Freddy on my second

1806
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
playthrough. Oh wow. And

1807
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
you hear this giggling if you look at the

1808
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
poster. And that's actually

1809
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
slowed down for their regular laugh.

1810
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
So ugh creepy. Anyway sorry.

1811
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Mass Effect.

1812
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
Unless we get a Five Nights at Shepherds

1813
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
crossover maybe. Who knows.

1814
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
I can't

1815
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,000
just imagine that. But it's

1816
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
the Volus that slowly

1817
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
runs. Waddling

1818
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
toward you.

1819
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Going.

1820
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
That breathing noise.

1821
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
This one needs to die.

1822
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
That's a Hanar. Oh my god

1823
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
the Hanar would be Chica.

1824
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Alright anyway.

1825
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Let's see we got some

1826
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
more stories here Loki.

1827
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Alright. Sorry I was being distracted

1828
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
by German Shepherd again.

1829
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
So Nintendo

1830
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
talk about

1831
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
the change of heart. You remember

1832
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Nintendo at one time was kind of

1833
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
barring the use of Smash

1834
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Brothers in fighting game tournaments and stuff.

1835
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
And now they're supporting

1836
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
and sponsoring Apex 2015.

1837
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
That's going to include

1838
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
different games including

1839
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Ultra Street Fighter 4

1840
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
Smash Brothers

1841
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and

1842
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Pokemon. And

1843
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
it's pretty awesome. The tournament is going to run from

1844
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
January 30th through February

1845
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
1st 2015.

1846
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,000
In New Jersey.

1847
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
And they're also going to stream it on Twitch.

1848
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
So.

1849
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Cool.

1850
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
That's probably a pretty awesome sponsor.

1851
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
That's quite the turn around for Nintendo.

1852
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
I guess they listen to feedback.

1853
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
A lot of feedback.

1854
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
Yeah these type of things help

1855
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
promote your game.

1856
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
You should let people do that.

1857
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Alright.

1858
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Let's see moving on.

1859
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Speaking of Nintendo. Those GameCube

1860
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
adapters highly sought after

1861
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
devices and I'm surprised it took this

1862
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
long for us to be talking about a

1863
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
third party GameCube adapter.

1864
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
And now even though

1865
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
the official GameCube adapter

1866
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
has not been discontinued

1867
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
good luck freaking finding it anywhere.

1868
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
It's not really showing up anywhere.

1869
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
So third parties have

1870
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
come in to fill in the gap

1871
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
about the

1872
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
GameCube adapters and

1873
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Mayflash is the company that's putting one of these together.

1874
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
A GameCube controller adapter.

1875
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
You can get it for $20.

1876
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
It's available on PlayAsia but

1877
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
I'm sure there's some other websites as well.

1878
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
What happens, this is

1879
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
very similar to the Nintendo GameCube

1880
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
adapter but shaped a

1881
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
little differently and there's a switch on the side

1882
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
to let you swap between Wii U

1883
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
and PC. That's kind of

1884
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
cool. So you can actually use

1885
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
your GameCube controller on the PC

1886
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
with that which

1887
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
could be pretty cool for playing some of your Steam Library

1888
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
games. So.

1889
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Now granted nobody's gotten their hands on this

1890
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
yet so we don't know if it's

1891
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
as responsive and so forth but

1892
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
I mean this is a pretty hard thing to

1893
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
screw up, right?

1894
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
You would say that. It shouldn't be that

1895
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
hard to just turn wires

1896
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
into other wires.

1897
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
Right? Well it's not as simple

1898
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
as that but yeah.

1899
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Let's see, Rama says at least

1900
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,000
these third party ones are PC compatible.

1901
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
Hitstun says that Mayflash

1902
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
adapter is not bad. But

1903
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Kaijuto says, I don't do third party

1904
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
electronics. Fuck that. And I can

1905
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
understand where some people want to keep it

1906
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
you know, with the official stuff

1907
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
because Nintendo ain't going to support one of these

1908
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
if your system gets all screwed up because

1909
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
of it. As

1910
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
little complicated as I believe these

1911
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
devices to be but it makes sense.

1912
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
So. Well hopefully

1913
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Nintendo will, I mean, I

1914
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
I don't understand the way they work sometimes

1915
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
is that they really thrive on this hard to

1916
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
get shit and it's getting old.

1917
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
It's getting old, it's getting frustrating.

1918
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
Sometimes it's hard to love you Nintendo. Sometimes

1919
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
it's really hard. Really hard.

1920
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
I already told you I'm over this amiibo

1921
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
shit. I was at this point

1922
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
where I was like, oh I gotta get Mega Man. I really

1923
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
want to get Pit. No, I'm done.

1924
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
I'm over the amiibo shit. I'm over it.

1925
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
It's too much of a game.

1926
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
It's like if I give my

1927
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
money I should be able to get, it's just

1928
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
what a mess.

1929
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
Anyway, let's get into

1930
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
the mailbag and the game of

1931
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
reading your emails because you send them to us

1932
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
every week.

1933
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com if you want to

1934
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
participate by sending us an email.

1935
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Dark Soccer is going to dive into the mailbag

1936
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
over at ParticipateAtOrangeLoungeRadio.com

1937
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
and read whatever

1938
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
emails may be awaiting us tonight.

1939
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
All one of them. All one of them.

1940
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
Save

1941
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
this for a show with a light

1942
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
mailbag as the scenario

1943
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
is a little lengthy and particularly

1944
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
weird while you have good timing.

1945
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Yes you do. Maybe I'm obsessed with survival

1946
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
type games but here's an obviously

1947
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
hypothetical situation for you.

1948
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
None of you know each other yet and do not have

1949
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
the families you currently have

1950
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
and you happen to be

1951
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
most comfortable sleeping unclothed.

1952
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
What?

1953
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
You just get home at night, play some games

1954
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
watch some TV, have dinner, then throw

1955
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
all your clothes in the hamper or washing machine

1956
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
take off any watches and jewelry and drift off

1957
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
to sleep only in your bedsheets.

1958
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
What?

1959
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
One comfortably warm spring night you

1960
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
turn in and in the morning

1961
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
or what you judge to be morning

1962
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
you wake up in an unfamiliar place still naked

1963
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
apparently nowhere near any known civilization.

1964
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
Neither alcohol nor medication

1965
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
are involved. Nonetheless you have no idea

1966
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
where you are or how you got there.

1967
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
You wake up to one of three

1968
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
scenarios. One you are in the middle

1969
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
of the massive grassy field. There's nothing

1970
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
as far as you can see except for gently rolling

1971
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
hills of dirt and grass

1972
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
spotted by dandelions and maybe some loose

1973
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
stones. There don't seem to be any type of

1974
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
wildlife around but there might be burrows

1975
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
or shallow dens in the soil.

1976
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
What?

1977
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Two. You have a very active imagination

1978
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
my friend.

1979
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Two. You are in a surprisingly dense

1980
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
forest with tall trees partially

1981
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
obscuring the sunlight. You can hear birds

1982
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
in the trees and little else. Nobody's

1983
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
expecting

1984
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
you to be able to tear trees down with your

1985
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
hands but branches, leaves and possibly

1986
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
fruits are accessible just

1987
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
pretty high out of your immediate reach

1988
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
save of course what's fallen on the forest floor.

1989
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
What?

1990
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Guys you know when chat says is this an email

1991
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
or is this a perv sex

1992
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
thing? Three.

1993
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
You wake up on the

1994
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
main floor of a long abandoned mid-sized

1995
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
suburban house with the windows and doors

1996
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
boarded from the outside. There's no

1997
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
electricity, water or gas and what furniture

1998
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
is left is deteriorated but somewhat usable.

1999
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
The stairs to the basement

2000
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
have collapsed and you cannot see what is down there

2001
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
but you know you are there alone.

2002
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
All you can see between the boards over

2003
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
the windows is a grassy field to the east

2004
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
and a dense forest to the west.

2005
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Given what you know from gaming

2006
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
TV and most importantly reality

2007
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
which scenario would each of

2008
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
you prefer to be in and why?

2009
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
What?

2010
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
And only

2011
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
slightly disturbed Robert

2012
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
M. This okay this is no no

2013
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
I'm not even this is what you need to do Robert

2014
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
M. like seriously you need to go download

2015
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Twine and start your text adventure

2016
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
game because you've got a script

2017
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
going here you clearly have an

2018
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
active imagination for this stuff

2019
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
just go make your game why didn't you

2020
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
did you send in something for the game jam I don't think you did

2021
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
so now's the time to start. Now

2022
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
that Rob's tirade is over I have an answer. What was number two

2023
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
again? I wasn't. That was being in the

2024
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
dense forest. That's not my tirade

2025
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
I'm not saying like I'm not like

2026
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
anti this but I'm just saying you

2027
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
go go I would vote for number two

2028
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
if it were me. Okay. Because

2029
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
in a forest where

2030
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
you can hear wildlife you have the

2031
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
potential if you need to make something to protect

2032
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
yourself you can

2033
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
find leaves

2034
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
or you know

2035
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
you can make shelter

2036
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
in the woods you can find food

2037
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
but it is much easier to find. In scenario

2038
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
three you are in a shelter already it's

2039
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
like fuck I don't have to make a shelter done

2040
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
but you don't have food

2041
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
yeah but you can go outside and

2042
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
I gotta say I'm for scenario

2043
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
one because it sounds like TLC

2044
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,000
is naked and afraid which by the way

2045
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
which by the way

2046
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
the Golden Globes

2047
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
were at the competition tonight

2048
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
tonight was the gay Mormon show on

2049
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
TLC that was tonight

2050
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
oh my god

2051
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
that just pisses me off. No it looks

2052
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
you know what there comes a point where you go this just looks like

2053
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
a fucking train wreck I have to see it. That is naked and afraid

2054
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
what you've never heard of naked and afraid

2055
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
oh my god

2056
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
well thank you emailer now I can explain

2057
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
to Loki what naked and afraid is all about

2058
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
I'm going back to the wiki

2059
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
there's a show on TV

2060
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
and this show should be mixed with Five Nights at Freddy's

2061
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
quite honestly no there's a show

2062
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
where they take two people

2063
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
and they're naked in the middle

2064
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
of nowhere and yes they film it

2065
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
they use the blur boxes right so you don't see nothing

2066
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
you can't see on basic cable and

2067
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
they just they have to survive for like I think it's

2068
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
like three days or something like that out in the wilderness

2069
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
and you know you watch

2070
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
them go crazy and they're afraid of all

2071
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
the sounds they hear out in the wilderness which is probably

2072
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
just the camera man and all that

2073
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
that's the show that is seriously a dumb ass

2074
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
show that might be on

2075
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
Discovery Channel not TLC maybe somebody

2076
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
will correct me in chat well I'm glad that this is the new discovery

2077
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
where they don't make up shit anymore

2078
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
ha ha ha ha

2079
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
discovered our lies

2080
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
oh no

2081
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
now the chat room is just

2082
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
going off on this email take it as a compliment

2083
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
though Robert M let's see

2084
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
actdeft says Five Nights

2085
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
Five Nights at Robert M's

2086
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
let's see

2087
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
says this guy is like a porn version of saw

2088
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
SSG 100 Matt says

2089
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
this feels like an SAT question

2090
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
and fifth dream says PT

2091
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
the email

2092
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
you are standing in front of a house there is a

2093
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
mailbox here

2094
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
PS you're naked

2095
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
I'm sorry it would be even freakier

2096
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
though is it if you like went to bed like

2097
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
you normally do like in pajamas

2098
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
or whatever you wear to bed

2099
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
and then just we're naked anyway

2100
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
that would be freakier

2101
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
hello is this a sex dream

2102
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
hello

2103
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
where's my hot person to bang

2104
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
where are they

2105
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
um

2106
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
you know what Robert M it sounds

2107
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
like you're really going to have to go with your gut

2108
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
because literally each one of us voted for a different answer

2109
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
so you're really going to have to just kind of go with your gut

2110
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
and maybe make all three of your

2111
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
interesting scenarios

2112
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
but the way that he described them

2113
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
they technically should be in the same universe

2114
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
so you get a random scenario with each awakening

2115
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
because the house seems like

2116
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,000
it's stuck between the edge of the forest

2117
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:54,000
and the field

2118
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
so I think it's the same location

2119
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,000
just different parts of it

2120
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,000
but I'm still naked right

2121
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:02,000
sexy times

2122
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:04,000
la la la

2123
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,000
la la

2124
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
la la la

2125
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
is Zachary Quinto there is he naked

2126
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:16,000
did you know that toy chica

2127
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:18,000
is really weird looking

2128
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:20,000
alright

2129
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:22,000
act deaf

2130
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:24,000
act deaf in chat says

2131
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
press x to call for sex

2132
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
uh fifth dream says

2133
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
this is me three nights a month go to bed clothed

2134
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
wake up at least half naked

2135
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:34,000
well that sounds like another scenario for a game

2136
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
where did my pants go

2137
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000

2138
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:40,000
like an oh well our dream game in the making

2139
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000

2181
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,000
well I would be

2182
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:20,000
disturbed if I woke up to a donkey

2183
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000

I'm tired actually no I'm not tired now

2188
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
I'm super wide awake

2189
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
hooray red bull hooray coffee hooray pizza

2190
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
yeah why'd I do that now

2191
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
I won't be able to sleep

2192
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,000
work out my game

2193
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
it didn't work out my game too

2194
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
my FU of the week

2195
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
goes to oh my god just last week

2196
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:48,000
just all of it

2197
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,000
no there was some good things from last week

2198
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:52,000
I can't really complain

2199
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,000
my super busy week

2200
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:56,000
but I am thankful

2201
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
for this upcoming weekend I'm going to have the best

2202
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,000
weekend ever this weekend so I'm excited

2203
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:02,000
I'm so excited I can't hide it

2204
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
there it is FU of the week

2205
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
just a couple more stories

2206
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:08,000
for you guys and then the phone call

2207
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:10,000
time 1877 game OLR

2208
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:12,000
or our username on skype

2209
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:14,000
orange lounge radio but first lowkey

2210
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,000
alright so layoffs

2211
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
have hit Codemasters they're saying it's part of

2212
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:20,000
their strategic realignment

2213
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
with I don't know what exactly that means

2214
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
making more

2215
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
racing games is that part of the alignment

2216
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
because that's what they're great at

2217
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:30,000
but yeah small number

2218
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
of roles have been proposed as being

2219
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
a risk of redundancy so they

2220
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,000
are removing that redundancy

2221
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:38,000
they've cut 30 jobs

2222
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:40,000
well

2223
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,000
that's a shitty way to start off the new year

2224
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,000
talking about layoffs already

2225
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,000
unfortunately

2226
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
this is also a common time for that to happen

2227
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
yeah and at the same time while it is

2228
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:52,000
unfortunate that they're cutting

2229
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
jobs if you have jobs that are redundant

2230
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
at your company maybe sometimes

2231
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
it's

2232
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
you're paying people to work

2233
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
and if they're not

2234
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
working as hard as they could be

2235
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
maybe

2236
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
slim your company down

2237
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
make it more profitable

2238
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
fifth dream in chat says that means

2239
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:14,000
we fired people because we needed money

2240
02:12:14,000 --> 02:12:16,000
that's a

2241
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
well I mean I don't know

2242
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
they put out some

2243
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
decent racing games I just don't know if they're like

2244
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
top top top tier

2245
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
alright well I got news

2246
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
well not really news more like rumors

2247
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:30,000
on another popular game

2248
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,000
series raise your hand if you like

2249
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
C-man

2250
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
raise your hand everybody do you like C-man

2251
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:38,000
really Rob you do

2252
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:40,000
I do I love C-man

2253
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,000
it's a great game and of course

2254
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
I'm talking about the Sega

2255
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
created game from the

2256
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
Dreamcast system which

2257
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
we talked about many times on this show before

2258
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
of course that's what I'm talking about

2259
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
and let's say there's a lot of fans

2260
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
of C-man out there on the internet

2261
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
web including Devolver Digital

2262
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
you know the indie publisher

2263
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Devolver Digital right

2264
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
the CEO Fork Parker on

2265
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Twitter just basically told

2266
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Sega we want to make a new game

2267
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
in the series and then went directly

2268
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
to the creator of C-man

2269
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
saying we want to

2270
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:16,000
do this and

2271
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,000
apparently the creator replied

2272
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
asking about formats

2273
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
so this shows that

2274
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
maybe there's a chance

2275
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
I would love to see them have it

2276
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:28,000
honestly because

2277
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
Devolver is awesome so

2278
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
I'm all down for that

2279
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
I love this because Fork actually went to

2280
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Utsido and said hi if you still

2281
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,000
own the rights to C-man then let's make a new one

2282
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:40,000
and Utsido replied and said

2283
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
hi for smartphone and

2284
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Fork Parker replied saying maybe PC and

2285
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
smartphone so I thought it was interesting

2286
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:48,000
for smartphone like maybe they're

2287
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
already making one for smartphone who knows

2288
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
so hmm

2289
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
anyway

2290
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
by the way if you didn't know and Dark

2291
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:58,000
Sakura has surely covered this in a previous classic

2292
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,000
game of the week because we love this game but

2293
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
in C-man you

2294
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
had a microphone and you actually would

2295
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
interact with the fish

2296
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:08,000
with the dude's face on the screen that was

2297
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Leonard Nimoy so I mean that

2298
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:12,000
that alone was awesome right there that you

2299
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
could talk to Leonard Nimoy and he would

2300
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
say things that didn't make sense basically

2301
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
so and they could friend his

2302
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
butt and you could friend his butt like that one very

2303
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
popular YouTube we played oh I don't even remember

2304
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
the name of the guy who did that that was

2305
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
one of my favorite YouTubes by the way

2306
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:28,000
an official sequel was released for the

2307
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
PlayStation 2 in 2007

2308
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
in 2002 Nintendo was

2309
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
apparently interested in resurrecting the series for

2310
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
3DS but nothing ever came of that so

2311
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
good luck Devolver Digital we hope you can do it

2312
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,000
and spread C-man

2313
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,000
all over the world that is

2314
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:44,000
what we hope you guys are able to do

2315
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,000
from all of us here at OLR

2316
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
so

2317
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
SSU100Matt is interested in this

2318
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
only if Leonard Nimoy voices it apparently

2319
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:54,000
over at live.vognetwork.com

2320
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,000
let's see

2321
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:58,000
and Kaijuto saying hopefully they can get

2322
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
Leonard Nimoy that would be awesome

2323
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
so

2324
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
there you go let's open the phones

02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000

which you know they make Skype on like every

2332
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
single device out there like your smartphone like if you don't

2333
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
want to actually dial it up you could probably use

2334
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
Skype to do it it is so easy to call our

2335
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000

talk about anything we've talked about you want to talk about your love

2337
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
of C-man or anything else that we've talked

2338
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
about in the show tonight

2339
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
you can certainly do so

2340
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
let's do that oh we got some

2341
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
calls coming in let's get to it

2342
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
hello you're on Orange Lounge Radio who's this

2343
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
this is Max hey Max how you doing

2344
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
yeah I'm doing good

2345
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
just

2346
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
yeah just figured I'd call in

2347
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
and see how this whole thing works

2348
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
that was really fast I guess you guys have

2349
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
probably been waiting longer than I could hear on the

2350
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
on the stream there is a little bit of

2351
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
a buffer but there's also a little trick too

2352
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
where sometimes I open it up a little bit before

2353
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
we're actually ready for the calls for just that reason

2354
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
excellent excellent well what's on your mind

2355
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
buddy not much

2356
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
man it's been it's been a good show I

2357
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
we we finished a

2358
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
project for the for the bog jam

2359
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
and that was a lot of fun and I

2360
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
I've just been having a blast playing the entries

2361
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
that have been rolling in so

2362
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
so you've actually checked out some of the

2363
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
entries that people were posting in the chat and so forth

2364
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
see I've played none of them yet I'm gonna

2365
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
wait and live stream it all but

2366
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
is there any particular standouts

2367
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
so far that you've noticed

2368
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
I pretty much like everything that I've played so far

2369
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
my my personal favorite right now

2370
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
is a hitstunz game

2371
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
skeleton hunter yeah

2372
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
it just it just feels it felt so

2373
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
much like when you it was

2374
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
it it's like the perfect buggy

2375
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
game it just felt so much like

2376
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
you had just gone to a rental store in the

2377
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
eighties and picked up the

2378
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
NES cart that's not the right shape

2379
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
you're like why is this the wrong shape and then you

2380
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
you take it home and you you play through it anyway

2381
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
even though it's terrible yeah what what what did

2382
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
what did color dreams put out on the NES

2383
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
this time it's

2384
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
just it's just a it's just a platformer but like

2385
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
like it it works like all the stuff

2386
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
in the game works except for it also

2387
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
there's a lot of things that that

2388
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
you don't expect like you can stand on pretty much

2389
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
anything including projectiles and they'll still hurt you

2390
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
but you can just stand on them and and

2391
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
like and there's

2392
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
there's times when you can get to the edge of the

2393
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
screen when you're not supposed to and it'll wrap

2394
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
to the left hand side of the screen and you'll suddenly

2395
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
be somewhere else and and and you

2396
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
have to kind of like work through that stuff and there's

2397
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
it's just it's just really great I really liked

2398
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
it well I know he he was really gung-ho

2399
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
about the idea right from he was there the night we

2400
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
picked the thing in listless he was very excited

2401
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
about it now we were we were

2402
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
honored to have you guys from cooking with

2403
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
unity participate not only that you

2404
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
guys like taped the whole darn thing

2405
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
so not only can we play your game we

2406
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
can just watch you make it on

2407
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
youtube yeah yeah we we we recorded

2408
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
just shy of 12 hours

2409
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
for the for the game and it was we showed

2410
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
everything on the show except for one thing that we

2411
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
kept as a surprise which was just which I'm

2412
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
not going to say because I want you guys to play so

2413
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
so a little little surprising can you give

2414
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
us a brief overview of what your game's about

2415
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
yeah yeah yeah what

2416
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
we did is we made a

2417
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
first person shooter just a really basic one

2418
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
kind of doom style with like sprite characters

2419
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
and stuff and then what we did

2420
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
is we made it so that's not actually the game

2421
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
the game is you have to find

2422
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
bugs in the game and mark them

2423
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
and so like the walls all

2424
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
can randomly not work and so

2425
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
if you find a wall that you can walk through you can

2426
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
right click it and you'll mark it as a bug

2427
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
and then like enemies can have the wrong

2428
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
AIs and power ups can like

2429
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
not power you up they can do the opposite

2430
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
and so you have to find all the things that don't

2431
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
work mark them and then complete the level and it

2432
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
gives you a score out of what

2433
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
bugs you found and what things you marked

2434
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
erroneously so you basically made like

2435
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
QA tester the game type of thing exactly

2436
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
exactly wow that is so

2437
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
clever I'm just I am really

2438
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
blown away like that these

2439
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
things we're talking about what you did

2440
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
and what Hitstun did and what all our listeners

2441
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
that are participating in this did I am just so

2442
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
blown away by the mere fact that

2443
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
this wouldn't exist if we

2444
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
hadn't you know had the idea

2445
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
so cool I'm glad you said the words

2446
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
man just throw it out there

2447
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
do more of these it's great so cool

2448
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
well and there's still more to come too

2449
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
I'm still very gung ho on completing

2450
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
my own idea and I know there's others out there

2451
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
that feel very similar I'm still gonna work on mine

2452
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
I just I need to sleep cause I haven't

2453
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
done that you know almost

2454
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
in a few days and like I had to go to work

2455
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
like early in the morning and work like a

2456
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
nine hour day it's just it's about balance

2457
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
I just have to like maybe I think

2458
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
tomorrow I will just go to bed

2459
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
early and then just kind of

2460
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
sleep for a little bit well Max

2461
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
we gotta say a big thank you to all you guys at Cookie

2462
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
with Unity because that episode that

2463
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
where we had you guys on we were talking about all that

2464
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
that was really a huge motivator

2465
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
and so I would argue that none of these games

2466
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
would exist without that either so you

2467
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
guys get a huge huge credit in

2468
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
making this all happen well

2469
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
thank you I think that's probably undeserved but thank you

2470
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
I do think that just

2471
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
you guys organizing this was awesome

2472
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
and thank you for inviting me on the show like that came out of

2473
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
nowhere and it was truly a pleasure

2474
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
as far as the other two

2475
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
games I just wanted to mention real quick

2476
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Umbria 4 I haven't played it much at all

2477
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
but it's a text based adventure game and

2478
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
I think I ate the first person I saw

2479
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
and so I have to play more of that game

2480
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
I just have to have enough time to dig into it

2481
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
and I also want to try out VG War

2482
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
just because it's a card game and I love card games

2483
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
like it's literally a card game you print out it's awesome

2484
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
that is so cool

2485
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
that is so cool so

2486
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
a bit of the inspiration

2487
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
behind a lot of this is actually playing

2488
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
the games you guys made I love how

2489
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
full circle this is all coming this is so cool

2490
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000

2543
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
always those rumors that E3 is gonna

2544
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
move to Vegas although LA

2545
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
LA is not gonna let that

2546
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
happen without a huge fight so but

2547
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
anyway but I digress

2548
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
what's on your mind tonight buddy yeah

2549
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
I just wanna talk a little bit more about

2550
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
CES you know it's always you know

2551
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
oh yeah CES of course

2552
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
happening just this past week even though

2553
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
usually not a lot of game content

2554
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
out of CES but sometimes I mean

2555
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
y'all know I still talk

2556
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
about game room and that was something

2557
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
that had come out of CES so sometimes you get a few things

2558
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
here and there did you go and check it out

2559
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
indeed indeed yeah I totally

2560
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
checked it out and yeah

2561
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
like it was interesting

2562
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
cause the main theme I guess the main

2563
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
trend this year was actually

2564
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
VR gaming there was

2565
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
quite a bit of demos

2566
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
from a lot of the

2567
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
companies kind of showing off their headsets

2568
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
and they're

2569
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
mobile they're like

2570
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
forward walking things that you can

2571
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
you know walk on while you

2572
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
wear the headsets

2573
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
what did you think did you actually get hands on

2574
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
with like some of the big ones like the Oculus

2575
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
or some of these other ones or what happened

2576
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
no I didn't actually

2577
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
get a chance to go hands on

2578
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
there was a

2579
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
there was only like one demo

2580
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
for each of those

2581
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
and there was a pretty huge line but

2582
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
I watched a lot of people

2583
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
play and you know

2584
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
it was really

2585
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
interesting though it was

2586
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
so like the guy was

2587
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
standing on this it was almost like

2588
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
it looked like a treadmill

2589
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
but it was like a stationary

2590
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
platform

2591
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
and the guy was wearing like really

2592
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
like special shoes

2593
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
that kind of like slide on it

2594
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
this guy was at E3 too

2595
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
they had like it looked like they were

2596
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
actually at Kickstarter they were actually

2597
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
in like the run and gun game like

2598
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
they couldn't do demos

2599
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
for us like with us in them because

2600
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
of insurance purposes or whatever but I totally

2601
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
know what you're talking about they were at E3 as well

2602
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
oh okay okay yeah it was like the

2603
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
the Virtuix Omni

2604
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
or something something like that

2605
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
I thought that was

2606
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
kind of interesting I never saw the guy

2607
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
like strafe left and right so I thought that was

2608
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
interesting but yeah he was just kind of

2609
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
doing his thing

2610
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
it looked intense it looked like the

2611
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
it looked like the gym of the future

2612
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
it was an intense workout or as we always say

2613
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
on OLR it's one step closer to the

2614
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
holodeck

2615
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
right right right

2616
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
it was crazy

2617
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
well you know Sony was there too

2618
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
there wasn't you know it's not really

2619
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
not too many games there

2620
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
most of the time it's always like there are

2621
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
other electronics but they were demoing

2622
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
things like the order

2623
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
1888 was like the main

2624
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
thing they were they were demoing and

2625
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
they had a few stations set up for

2626
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
playstation now I guess

2627
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
since they just announced their

2628
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
their monthly

2629
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
the subscription stuff right right right

2630
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
right but yeah

2631
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
it was other than that

2632
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
the only

2633
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
other gaming stuff

2634
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
I thought was amusing

2635
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
so you know

2636
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
that shoe company

2637
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
Skechers you probably

2638
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
saw or you may have not seen that

2639
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
news so they have these

2640
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
shoes that like it's almost

2641
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
like it's you know that

2642
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
old like toy from

2643
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
like the 80s Simon

2644
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
yeah it's so

2645
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
they put this like

2646
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
contraption on their shoes and it's

2647
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
called like the Skechers game

2648
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
kicks and it's basically a giant

2649
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,000
Simon like

2650
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
toy like on your

2651
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
sneakers and so

2652
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
it lights up and like you could

2653
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
like sit down and like play Simon

2654
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
I saw a picture

2655
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
of that somewhere out there and I thought

2656
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
that was crazy I didn't realize that was Skechers I wear

2657
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
I actually enjoy like not to endorse a

2658
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
product I'm not being paid to endorse but I will say

2659
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
I do usually wear Skechers

2660
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
shoes one of my favorite ones I'm wearing them right now

2661
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
and Loki's wearing them right now so

2662
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
the fact that they're putting out a pair that has

2663
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
Simon on it's kind of dumb

2664
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
it is kind of dumb

2665
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
but you know what it's no dumber than

2666
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
Pumps remember

2667
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
that was really dumb

2668
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
but you know what I totally want though

2669
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
Nike Back to the Future shoes that are gonna

2670
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
self lace yeah you know Pumps really

2671
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
are stupid because they do awful things to your feet

2672
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
and your posture just saying

2673
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
don't wear the high heels I love those things

2674
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
as a kid I love those Pumps

2675
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
you missed the joke

2676
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
put your hand over your head you might catch it

2677
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
well I wore those Pumps

2678
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
as a kid too but anyway

2679
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
and I've seen you

2680
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
trace across the stage in them too

2681
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
that's right I wasn't the rock you

2682
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
wore a picture show for how long? I think I've worn

2683
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
a pair of Pumps in my life anyway

2684
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000

02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
it's kinda expensive it's like

2725
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
$75 what

2726
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
that's too much money is that

2727
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
an official Square product or is that like a knock

2728
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
off something no yeah it's official

2729
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
huh well Rob

2730
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
but it's only sold in Japan

2731
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
so that's why it's so expensive because

2732
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
it's also really big I want one

2733
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
it's so cute yeah that's like as big

2734
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
as like his face is as big as your face

2735
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
that is yeah huge chocobo

2736
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
alright that's adorable though I want to hug

2737
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
it I'm hugging it you can't

2738
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
see me but I'm hugging my computer screen right

2739
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
now that fat chocobo is so adorable

2740
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
alright well anyways

2741
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
uh something related to

2742
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
importing and especially because

2743
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
of the of Nintendo

2744
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
retiring the Wii U and its market

2745
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
of Brazil

2746
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
it's like already has been

2747
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
said it's because of taxes and

2748
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
import fees that's something

2749
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
that I have talked about before

2750
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
in OLR but still

2751
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
it's something worth bringing up

2752
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
again because

2753
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
it's something really that

2754
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
affects every single

2755
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:26,000
gamer in Latin America

2756
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:28,000
from Mexico to Argentina

2757
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:30,000
so it's something that

2758
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:32,000
that everyone in Latin America can

2759
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
relate to Brazil so it's not

2760
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
something that surprises

2761
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
us even

2762
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
for a company just

2763
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
to say no we're not selling

2764
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
our product there because it's

2765
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
way too expensive especially with

2766
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
Nintendo and their finances

2767
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
right now so it's pretty obvious

2768
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
right

2769
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
we have heard the stories

2770
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
of the PS4 selling for

2771
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
way over like four times

2772
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
the time

2773
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
sorry the cost in the US

2774
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
like here even

2775
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
it basically costs not

2776
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
double but

2777
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
it costs at least half more

2778
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
what it should cost in the

2779
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
US well and you've talked about this before

2780
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
on the show about like living in Mexico

2781
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
you you know will

2782
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
pay more just like in many

2783
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
ways funny enough like your fat chocobo

2784
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
that you have there is like even in the US

2785
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
I'm gonna pay more money for that because

2786
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
I have to get it from Japan so I gotta

2787
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
pay those import fees and everybody

2788
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
along the way from Square Enix

2789
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
in Japan to me here in the States

2790
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
everybody along the way that little fat chocobo

2791
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
passes through is gonna want their cut

2792
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
yeah exactly that's

2793
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
the point I have the

2794
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
the fortune

2795
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
or the luck

2796
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
sorry of living

2797
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
next to the US

2798
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
so I get my stuff delivered

2799
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
in a PO box over there

2800
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
in the border city next to us

2801
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
but

2802
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
so yeah I have the luck of that

2803
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
but I have other friends

2804
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
who live

2805
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
live very

2806
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
deep in the country or even

2807
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
South American friends that

2808
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
that have to pay import fees

2809
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
so even if I had ordered

2810
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
this like from eBay because

2811
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
it's also there and have

2812
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
send it directly

2813
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
to Mexico I have to pay more

2814
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
fees I have to pay a more

2815
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
expensive shipping fee and even

2816
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
import fees because of

2817
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
how much it costs and the size

2818
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
and the

2819
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
sorry and the weight and all that

2820
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
and it would have been way

2821
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
more expensive to get it

2822
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
now 5th Dream in chat is yelling

2823
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
smuggler with little face there

2824
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
but you know and I'm sure he's just teasing

2825
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
but I mean don't aren't you

2826
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
kinda left with no other choice

2827
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
yeah it's basically that

2828
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
or just pay way

2829
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
more for it because it's really

2830
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
it's really crazy how

2831
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
how taxes work here

2832
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
because for every single

2833
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
thing you have to pay something more

2834
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
almost so

2835
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
for me to get something like this

2836
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
I seriously have to

2837
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
to do some loopholes

2838
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
to the law to get it

2839
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
so yeah well we have to pay taxes

2840
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
too on everything we buy with the

2841
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
sales tax usually unless I live

2842
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
in Oregon or something but even then

2843
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
something's being taxed be it income property

2844
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
etc etc

2845
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
but wow I mean yeah I mean

2846
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
I know it's sometimes with the

2847
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
trade and stuff it's very interesting

2848
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
how that all works and complicated

2849
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
you know and like you said

2850
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
Mexico may have it a little

2851
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
bit easier because of its closer proximity

2852
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
to the US than a place like

2853
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
Brazil but at the end of the day

2854
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
it's still

2855
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
the same is that there's all these taxes

2856
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
and yeah crazy crazy

2857
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
it is and

2858
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
there are many people here that

2859
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
that do a lot of stuff to get

2860
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
like

2861
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
video game things, anime

2862
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
things just to

2863
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
to

2864
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
to maintain a hobby

2865
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
it's really something you have to

2866
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
be careful of

2867
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
in terms of

2868
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
expenses because

2869
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
yeah you can pay probably

2870
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
a lot cheaper price

2871
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
than what you would pay in a regular

2872
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
store here and I can

2873
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
make many many examples

2874
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
of it

2875
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
but like I said especially with

2876
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
this Chicago plush

2877
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
I paid $75

2878
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
which converted to

2879
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
pesos it's something

2880
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
around the 1000 pesos mark

2881
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
but like I said

2882
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
I would have paid probably

2883
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
like 1500 pesos

2884
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
1500 pesos

2885
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
just to have it brought over

2886
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
here directly

2887
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
and especially because it would have

2888
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
taken way longer and it's

2889
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
like way

2890
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
way more

2891
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
of a hassle

2892
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
I have the experience of a

2893
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
beta memory card 64 gigabytes

2894
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
that they don't sell in the

2895
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
US

2896
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
it took around two

2897
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
months to get here

2898
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
directly

2899
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
yeah

2900
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
well you know what

2901
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
thank you I think this all serves

2902
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
as a humble reminder is that gamers

2903
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
are everywhere but access to

2904
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
games a lot of times depends on

2905
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
where you're fortunate enough to be

2906
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
so a humble reminder

2907
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
there that some people have to pay

2908
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
a little more to play the games that some of us take

2909
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
for granted thank gosh though for PC

2910
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,000
and all that that PC and digital distribution

2911
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
really cuts a lot out of it doesn't it

2912
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
yeah and I have called

2913
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
also about this on Steam

2914
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
the Steam sells here the games

2915
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
way cheaper than in the US

2916
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
so well not all the

2917
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
games but most games on Steam

2918
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
so that helps a lot

2919
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
but still building

2920
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
a PC or buying PC parts here

2921
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
it's expensive but in the long term

2922
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
yeah it's way better you can't play Nintendo

2923
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
games on PC well not legally

2924
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
alright well you take

2925
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000

2929
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
alright bye

2930
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
if I didn't have a trip to Seattle

2931
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
coming up this weekend I'd be checking my wallet right now

2932
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
do I have $75 in the car

2933
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
could I do it?

2934
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
cause I kinda want it dark soccer I want that fat chocobo

2935
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
if I buy one it's for me

2936
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
can you buy two?

2937
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
well you remember

2938
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
you remember Julie had that

2939
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
rappy oh yes I remember the rappy

2940
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
she paid like $105

2941
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
but rappies are really cute too

2942
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
that's basically fantasy

2943
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
star online's version of a fat chocobo in a way

2944
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
in a way

2945
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
anyway one more call for calls

2946
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
1877 game OLR

2947
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
username on skype orange lounge radio

2948
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
we don't usually do more than three calls but

2949
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
we have a little extra time on tonight's show just because the news

2950
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
ran a little faster tonight isn't that weird

2951
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
we had like literally no news the past couple weeks

2952
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
we ran longer of course we had some list lists

2953
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
and some other segments to fill time

2954
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
but we will try to take a couple more calls

2955
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
1877 game OLR username on skype orange lounge radio

2956
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
Loki let me check in with you again

2957
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
to see if you have any other last minute stories

2958
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
no I don't have any last minute stories

2959
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
I'm working on my game now

2960
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
I guess we covered it all any progress on your game?

2961
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
what are you working on right this minute what are you trying to do?

2962
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
right this minute I'm trying to

2963
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
set up something that

2964
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
when I get on the starting line

2965
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
in this one spot that it stops for a second so that I can do

2966
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
a countdown and then it lets me go

2967
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
so I'm trying to figure out how to turn off

2968
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:34,000
the acceleration on my car script

2969
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to cheat

2970
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
by having it hold down the handbrake

2971
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
so it can't move

2972
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
because hey it works

2973
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
but it's just

2974
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
it's not exactly the way you should do it

2975
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
alright well we have some stories sent to us

2976
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
from folks on Twitter

2977
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
I always love to hear from folks on Twitter

2978
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
over at Twitter.com slash OLR

2979
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
and Jason or username

2980
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
I am Jason C. sent us a tweet

2981
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
and the headline on this is

2982
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
EB Games is removing all copies

2983
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
of Elder Scrolls Online from stores

2984
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
uh oh

2985
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
Spaghetti-O although I believe this is Australia

2986
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
but let me look

2987
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
I'm looking at this story here

2988
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
that says all copies of

2989
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
Elder Scrolls Online including the prepaid cards

2990
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
are to be sent back to the publisher

2991
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
everything relating to the game

2992
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
would be removed by January 13th

2993
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
now they did issue an update to this

2994
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
and EB Games said on their Facebook page

2995
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
that this removal is part of a normal stock recall

2996
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
which would

2997
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
include numerous video games

2998
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
so

2999
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
the source apparently

3000
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
had said that other titles mentioned in the list

3001
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
are excess stock however

3002
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
whereas Elder Scrolls Online was

3003
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
all stock including the prepaid

3004
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
cards you know what that normally means

3005
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
because the last time I saw

3006
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
something like that where they recalled the stock

3007
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
it's because it's going free to play

3008
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
it was DC Universe and you know

3009
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
what else is very interesting

3010
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
is on Hoard House this week

3011
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
plug plug for my other show on Wednesdays

3012
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
on Hoard House this week we talked about that they were

3013
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
getting rid of the six month subscription plan

3014
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
that was already

3015
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
going away you could no longer get the six month

3016
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
subscription plan and some folks were

3017
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
taking that as a sign that the game was getting

3018
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
ready for free to play

3019
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
that's two

3020
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
that's two signs now

3021
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
just because that's what happened

3022
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
last well with DC Universe

3023
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
they recalled the stock they gave us

3024
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
basically like a window of like

3025
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
you have to return it by this date

3026
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
but it was shortly

3027
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
it was right after they announced it was going free to play

3028
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
but if they're anticipating that it's going

3029
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
free to play they may do the same thing

3030
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
or just maybe it's just not

3031
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
selling and they have an opportunity

3032
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:42,000
to send it back and get

3033
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
reimbursed for it because they're just not

3034
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
selling copies

3035
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
very interesting well thank you for the tip there

3036
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
Jason it looks like those of you that have

3037
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
wanted to play Elder Scrolls Online but didn't want to pay

3038
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
to do it well you might get

3039
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
your chance here coming soon we'll see

3040
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
anyway since the Skype line isn't ringing again I think

3041
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
everybody who wanted to get through did get through thank you

3042
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
to those that called in if you think of something

3043
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
after the fact you want to get in touch with us later

3044
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000

02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:14,000
just uh you know

tell us how tell us how the

3050
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
the game Mormon show went tonight or the golden

3051
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
globes why not let us know

3052
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
we'd prefer though if you keep

3053
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
it about video games but I suppose anything

3054
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
is going to turn into a tangent here on

3055
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:28,000
olr but I think that's what you guys appreciate

3056
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,000
don't play all the vogjam entries that's right

3057
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:32,000
check out the vogjam entries if nothing

3058
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,000
else there's uh now they're kind of a

3059
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:36,000
little bit all over the place

3060
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
so what we're going to do in the coming days at

3061
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
vognetwork we're going to do an article

3062
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:42,000
for the site that will summarize where you

3063
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:44,000
can check them all out now some of them

3064
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
are very easily accessible at vognetwork.com

3065
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
they've been added to the arcade a couple

3066
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:50,000
I know at least hitstun's game that

3067
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
Max was talking about and Bobby

3068
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
Blackwolf's game he participated too

3069
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
uh I know at least those two are right

3070
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
there on the vog website so very easy to

3071
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
find uh the rest are there's a lot

3072
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
of them plugged in the forums but we

3073
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
will um have an article in this

3074
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
coming week that will kind of compile everything

3075
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
for you uh with one place to go

3076
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
and then of course as I said I'm going to go through and play

3077
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
them all at least the ones that I can stream

3078
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
because I just realized I think one of the I think

3079
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
one of the entries we got was a card game

3080
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
so that might be a little harder to do

3081
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
uh but well you never

3082
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
I might be able to YouTube it

3083
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
try to get dark soccer over

3084
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
here we'll play a card game it'll be fun

3085
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
we'll put it on YouTube

3086
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
like the vogjam entry that's a card game

3087
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
that we got not a piece of meat

3088
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000

and I gotta say there was a really really

3102
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
kind one on iTunes this week

3103
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
that was so awesome and I wish I had it

3104
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
in front of me but of course now that I'm thinking

3105
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
about it I don't have the review up in front of me

3106
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
I'll see if I can get it while we're doing our

3107
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
final thoughts here but yeah

3108
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
I really appreciate that stuff and we all do

3109
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000

3110
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000

3111
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
a friend or two about the show and you're still wondering

3112
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
what you can do to help us out those

3113
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000

3114
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000

3115
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000

3117
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
about Orange Lawns Radio that stuff really

3118
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:34,000

3119
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:36,000

3120
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
week reminder we're taking a little

3121
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
holiday break a late holiday but we will

02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000

3124
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:46,000
and hopefully all of us here

3125
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:48,000
in studio and all of you out there will get to play

3126
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:50,000
some more games catch up on that

3127
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
backlog and we'll really start to kick

3128
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
off 2015 and hopefully you've all played

3129
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
the VoG Jam games at that point we can talk about those

3130
02:41:56,000 --> 02:41:58,000
too in the meantime

3131
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
since we're getting close to the end of the

3132
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
show here it's time to go around and get everybody's

3133
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
final thought for the night

3134
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,000
Loki I know you're working hard over there on your game

3135
02:42:06,000 --> 02:42:08,000
but what is your final thought tonight?

3136
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,000
I want an Oculus Rift

3137
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:12,000
I'm looking at them on eBay

3138
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
that still surprises me you haven't played one yet

3139
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
yeah I understand

3140
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
DK2 would be nice

3141
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000

02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000

02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
totally going to mispronounce this

3145
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000

3146
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
S-E-R-E

3147
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000

3150
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:38,000

3151
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
